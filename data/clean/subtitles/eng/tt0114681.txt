everything is part
of a big master plan
but sometimes its
well its hard to read
i mean its like if you get too close
to the screen
all you can see
is a bunch of little dots
you dont see the big picture
until you stand back
but when you do
everything comes into focus
hi my name is suzanne maretto
no wait im sorry
suzanne maretto
is my married name
my own name
is suzanne stone
thats my professional name
suzanne stone
its not like i have any negative
feelings about the name maretto
maretto is the name after all
of my husband
who i loved very very much
um heh
sorry
its also the name of his parents
joe and angela maretto
and of his lovely and talented
sister janice maretto
who have been like
a second family to me
and who i regard
as i do my own family
particularly since
my recent tragedy
and who just through knowing
and being related to them
have given me what i think is
a very valuable insight
into the different kinds
of ethnic relationships
that are part of the very things
that ive been trying to explore
as a member
of the professional media
first impressions in one word
you really want to know
wet
four letters begins with c
larry its a girl
youve never seen
one of them huh
cold
cold cold cold
yeah
what did you think of suzanne
when you met her
i just didnt get the suzanne thing
i mean all the girls around town
thought larry was really cute
i mean they all used to hang out
at the restaurant on the nights
when my dad would let larry
and his dopey rock band play there
just uh you know
oh susie q
oh susie q
im comin to you
i love you
my susie q
i love the way you walk
i love the way you talk
i like the way you walk
i like the way you talk
susie q
say go back home
laura risley i remember
she really
peggy holden
i mean shes kind of a slut
but i mean he couldve had anybody
basically is what im saying
but i dont know suzanne blond
i dont know
well yeah sure
i couldve said some things
well to tell you the truth
i did say some things
yeah its my brother
but in a very subtle way
larry what do you think
of angela raguzzo
shes all right
shes hot
why
she wants you to ask her out
look sis dont try and fix me up
with people its embarrassing
all right
what do you think of
dana defalco
you want me to go out with a girl
whose fathers in the mob
who says hes in the mob
everybody
everybody so
dont you want a little excitement
i got all the excitement i can take
oh with who the ice maiden
you dont know
what youre talking about
i dont
no
okay
inform me
well its none of
your business
but suzanne she looks you know
very fragile and delicate right
mmhm
but when were
when were
i mean when im
look i dont even know why im telling you this
details are too graphic
but let me just tell you
shes like
shes like a volcano
you mean
people come from miles around
just to watch her explode
hehhehheh
is that it
very funny
like mount st helene
very funny hahaha
man when he says to me
im gonna marry her
wait a minute you what
you what i said
and then he says
im telling you sis
shes it
shes the golden girl of my dreams
oh god
and i did one of these
which i regretted right away
because you know he looked at me
with that kind of doggy look
that guys get
im just kidding im kidding
she cant even bowl
yes yes
let me tell you something all right
yeah
shes like shes like uh
a delicate china doll
larry you ever try kissing a doll
you know they dont kiss back
shes like one of those porcelain
figurines that mom collects
she is so pure and delicate
and innocent
you just have to look at her
and you wanna take care of her
for the rest of your life
yeah i can see that
so
anyway so when she suzanne
says to me
if youre actively seeking a career
in the professional ice skating field
in the spotlight so to speak
i think you have to maximize
your positive features
mm sure
so what im saying
is that a qualified
plastic surgeon
could just snip away those little
beauty spots or facial blemishes
whatever you call them
youd see how much better youd feel
you know commenting about
my face and stuff i you know
i knew where she was going
miss fixerupper
i believe that mr gorbachev
you know the man who
ran russia for so long
i believe he would be in power today
if hed done what people suggested
and had that big purple thing
taken off his forehead
i firmly believe that
i hope to interview him
well discuss that
along with other more pertinent
international things you know
im telling you sis shes gonna be
the next barbara walters
oh is that right
well barbara does have
many admirable qualities
a wide range of knowledge
of current events
and a sympathy
for peoples feelings
which is a trait so many people have
who are of the jewish persuasion
isnt she something else
so yeah that was it
i mean a done deal finite
he was a goner
the point is that for instance
connie chung
who is married i believe
to maury povich the wellknown
interviewer doesnt say
hello this is connie povich
with the news now does she
and i dont think she would be
embarrassed by it
because shes already pretty ethnic
when you think about it
or to take another example
someone who doesnt have
an ethnic bone in her body
theres jane pauley
who i strongly relate to
because you know
we have similar physical traits
although i dont have to struggle with
the weight problem like she does
and she also
to the best of my knowledge
has never identified herself
audiencewise
as jane trudeau
even though her husband
mr trudeau
is a prominent cartoonist
of some kind
and not as so many people believe
the expresident of canada
so what im saying is this
there are some people
who never know who they are
or who they wanna be
until its too late
and that is a real tragedy
in my book
because i always knew who i was
and who i wanted to be
always
okay who wants to be on tv
there she is
oh look at whos looking at herself
just look at that
suzanne look there
look there come here
look at the camera
see
look at what a darling
oh sweetheart
cant you get it focused
better than that
and were back with the families
of suzanne and larry maretto
mr stone
mr stone
at first i have to admit we
we didnt think too much of it
the relationship
i mean here was our daughter
a college graduate
junior college yes but with
good grades and a degree in
electronic journalism
exactly
and here was
this young man
a good boy obviously
but still a boy
whose education was
limited to high school
and i remember saying to her
honey
im worried that you dont know
what youre getting into with this kid
dad im not a little girl any more
i know that sweetheart
all im saying is that we come
from pretty different backgrounds
for all you know his family could be
mixed up with the mafia or something
im sorry joe
no problem earl
i was just being
no no no i understand
oh i understand please
of course she just laughed at me
dad dont worry
well i have to worry
thats what dads do
if you ask me id say that larry
appealed to a side of her
that you wouldnt ordinarily know
was there
it was a kind of a what uh
a wild side
well not wild but uh
wild
i thought he would marry
i dont know
you know like
a nice italian girl
but like the guy
in the godfather says
this is america okay
the melting pot
anyway one day larry comes over to me
he says
im gonna tell you something pop
shes going places
shes got goals
you know shes studying stuff
shes sending out résumés
all the time
did i show you what
she gave me for my birthday
you can be the one
the one what
well the one anything thats the point
its selfmotivation
its from that guy on tv
the millionaire
with all the houses and yachts
you know
sounds pretty serious larry
serious pop i sold my drums
you sold your drums
yep
and he did he sold his drums
and he turned himself right around
just for her
the veil suzanne wore
she had copied
from a picture in a magazine
the exact same one
maria shriver wore at her wedding
larry was uh
he was so proud you know
because suzanne
she designed the wedding rings
all by herself
you want me to describe them
for you
they were round and gold
i mean big fucking deal
come on suze lets go
ill still never find a guy like you
dad
suze
what
we got a postcard
from suzanne
every single day that
they were on their honeymoon
and it very much surprised us
that they went to florida
because suzanne was never
one to lie around the beach
but larry was very much
into boating and fishing
and i think she just wanted
to make him happy
thats a pretty little lady
you got there
yes sir
weve been married for four days
and uh 18 hours
i wouldnt let her
out of my sight for very long
well she cant go in the sun
its not good to tan
when youre on tv
tv what show is she on
have i ever seen her
not yet but you will
hi honey
suzanne
did you miss me
hm
did you dream about me baby
suzanne
ahem it mustve been
a pretty successful honeymoon
because when they came back
they were
radiant
exactly radiant
larry took money he was saving
in case he wanted to go to college
he put a down payment
on that condo over at the heights
and he bought her
that pretty little mustang
yeah
yeah
hi
how are you
good good good
come in
hey mom
so you thought larry changed a lot
after he and suzanne were married
totally it was like suddenly
you know he went from van halen
to jerry vale overnight
i dont know she didnt have any
well she thought she had taste but
barquettes with leek chiffonade
this is the dish that they serve
in johnny carsons
favorite restaurant in hollywood
well hey if its good enough
for johnny
well was that
some meal or what
oh
i say julia childs
better watch her back
or shell be looking
for another job huh
oh larry
well i wont be doing this
every night
im planning to start this exercise
class so i can get rid of a few pounds
from where your feet
hehhehheh
on tv the camera adds five pounds
is that true
i didnt know that
did you know that joe
no
talking about exercise
i gotta go
hey
i gotta rehearse
i got a rehearsal at some godawful
hour all the way over in norwalk
what are you rehearsing dear
janice has a job
in the ice follies
theyre going on tour in september
hey sis thats fabulous
thanks
im just one of the chorus
you know now but
well actually i do skate
this one medley
its kind of a you know
salute to great tv shows
i skate the peggy lipton part in
the mod squad number you know
peggy lipton
yeah
i get to wear a blond wig
and everything you know
how exciting
yeah theyre talking about like
well maybe a tv special
this year so
now listen hang on everybody
because well weve got
a pretty important announcement
ourselves to make
and i think congratulations
are in order
larry
oh honey
wait wait wait cut cut cut
its not that
youre not
no im not pregnant for gods sake
oh
suzys got a job
what
over at wwen the tv station
the first woman they ever hired
isnt that right
thats right
yep our suze is on her way now
and nothing is gonna stop her
oh honey im proud of you
thats great
were proud of you
great great
so how are the newlyweds
oh theyre doing great
thanks sal
yeah cute kids
arent they just
yeah
did you like the barquettes
the what
with the leek chiffonade
was it okay
we never did them before
but she showed us this recipe
in a book so pfft no problem
i never told anyone
even joe
so she couldnt cook
there are worse crimes
as we all know
youre not anybody in america
unless youre on tv
on tv is where we learn
about who we really are
because whats the point
of doing anything worthwhile
if nobodys watching
and if people are watching
it makes you a better person
marry me mary say yes
i thought she was like
a goddess of some kind
like lady di
before she dumped the prince
and went nudist and everything
suzanne bought me this dress
which i hope to fit someday
suzanne maretto was
a beautiful human being
with real dreams and aspiritions
suzanne used to say
opportunity is always knocking
if you arent listening
its knuckles get sore
and it moves to another house
something like that
she said that even
on her honeymoon
she had larry take her to this hotel
in florida where there was gonna
be this kind of convention
of all these bigshot tv people
that shed read about
in a magazine
which of course she didnt tell
larry because she didnt want
to maybe hurt his feelings
about her attending to her career
while they were bonding sexually
so to speak
so the german reporter
says to the hungarian editor
of course shes always smiling
she gets faxed at least
10 times a day boom
thank you thank you
i know thats a silly joke
but it does illustrate
our central thesis today
which is here and now in the
fastmoving computer age
its the
in our fastmoving computer age
its the medium of television
that joins together
our global community
and it is the
it is the television journalist
who serves as messenger
bringing the world
into our homes
and our homes into the world
thank you
thank you very much
thanks a lot
the point is miss
stone
miss stone
suzanne
suzanne stone
thats a good name
now thats a name
you can remember
the point is suzanne
if you want it bad enough
youll get it
but you gotta really want it
you gotta be able to do things
that ordinary people wouldnt do
mm
you see what im saying
hm i think so
how about another of those
oh um i dont know about that
sweetheart
yes
give us another all around okay
okay heh heh
anyway
when i was at the network
there was this gal from some
10watt station in the midwest
where she did the weather

in her best donna karan
dressforsuccess knockoff
blond hair all done up
in a french twist
and an audition tape
in her imitation leather briefcase
along with a letter of introduction
from her station manager
and it says
please give your
most serious consideration
to the bearer of this letter
miss soandso
who is of moderate intelligence
who has some experience
in broadcasting
and more importantly
who can suck your cock
until your eyes pop out
and you know
who that gal is today
who
is that true
its true
and here comes
the best part
yes
this is the best part
about 10 years ago im at
some tv conference somewhere
and i run into that station manager
and i congratulate him
on his letterwriting skills

the guy who used to be on tv
i think he was dan rathers
uncle or something
it was like a hairball puked up
by some demon from hell
there wasnt much to do
most of the time she just sat
over there and worked on her file
her idea file
she had so many ideas
this is the presentation on that idea
with me going to movie theaters
talking to the people coming out
to see what they really think
an actual um ahem
vox populi if you know the term
heres the memo on that childrens
show with me as the hostess
and the live instudio animals
if you could look it over tonight
give me your thoughts in the morning
a couple of pages
outlining that concept
for interviewing everyday citizens
like mailmen
school crossing guards
to inform our citizenry on what kind
of services are available to them

uptotheminute weather report
this is your wwen
weather person saying

i never really gave a rats ass
about the weather
until i got to know mrs maretto
now i take it very serious
if it rains
or theres lightning or thunder
or if it snows
i have to jack off
uh hm
oh right sorry
no values any more
nowhere to turn
wasting away
right down on you
wasting away
suffer more somebody still
found release locked away
right down on you
wasting away
todays guest mrs maretto
is a representative of our local
television station wwen
onair correspondent
im sorry
well actually
im an onair correspondent
well thats fine
anyway mrs maretto has asked
to have a few words with you
and i know that while im gone
you will give her your best attention
heres my best attention
did you say something russell
no mr finlaysson i didnt
i didnt
well first of all
i would like to thank you all
for extending me the courtesy
of your time and attention
i got something to extend
and i would like to say
that i hope youll all be as excited
about the project im here
to propose to you as i am
first of all i want to ask
have any of you actually ever
been on television before
not counting home video
of course
no one
i was
whats your name
lydia mertz
and how did it happen
that you made this appearance
oh it was down
at bensons electronics
they have this video camera
in the window
and when you walk by
they take your picture
well lydia this may come
as a surprise
but that is how some of our most
famous personalities started out
just seeing what they look like
accidentally
is that true
absolutely
now i am producing
a television documentary
about kids just like yourselves
because it is teenagers like you
who are the future of our nation
and after all i used to be
a teenager myself once
back in the dark ages
heh heh
so i would like to find out
about your way of life
how you feel
about your education
how you feel about
things like peer pressure
how you feel about drugs
um rap music
pussy
do we have to get permission slips
from our parents for this
no no that wouldnt be necessary
hey when did your folks learn
to read and write
hey read this shitface
all right all right
all right all right all right
i am going to put this list
on your bulletin board
and any of you
who think this project
would be as meaningful
as i know it can be
just put their names on it
and i would also like
to thank you all
for your interest
everything settled then
yes
well then lets give
mrs maretto our thanks
and a round of applause
thank you thank you
sign up
suzanne
id never really signed up
for anything before
except an afterschool
weight watchers program
which i was asked to leave anyway
because they said i wasnt motivated
and because i gained 11 pounds
in three weeks
but this was different
because it turned out to be
the most important thing
i ever did
now heres some advice
russell dear
that nice mrs maretto
is married to a boy
whose father is a pillar of
the italianamerican community
and if he knew
how you had insulted
his only beloved daughterinlaw
he would make one phone call
and a man would show up in the middle of
the night and turn you into a eunuch
you know what a eunuch is
russell of course you dont
but you can find it in the dictionary
if you dont know how to spell it
look it up
under nutless wonders
so im thinking
there must be some simple way
for you to make it up
to mrs maretto
for your offensive behavior
what do you think hm
wow a eunuch
suffer more somebody still
found release locked away
built up high
right down on you
wasting away
i have to say
that the staff at wwen
responded with total enthusiasm
to my project
and gave me excellent support
both editorially and technically
i think they could sense
immediately
that i was onto something important
in a sociological sense
she mustve taped god knows
how many hundreds of hours
with these three dorky kids
who from what ive seen
would have a major struggle
just reciting the days of the week
in proper order
forget about social insights
here ill show you
this is teens speak out project
tape one take one
no no no
im suzanne stone
and these are
all right now lets just say
something in general about ourselves
like what
like what do you plan to do
with your future lydia
i dont exactly have a plan
well you must have
aspirations of some kind
what
a dream a life goal
i can tell you lydias big life goal
yeah
its to fuck
the new kids on the block
thats a dirty lie
russell
i dont wanna hear language
like that it is offensive
and it is unsuitable for broadcast
under fcc regulations
you got that
yeah
anyways it was mötley crüe
all right lydia
just for your information
what about you james
james
james
huh
i think you get the point that its not
mike wallace eat your heart out
but i have to say
ive never seen more persistence
i uh i once said to her
what about
what about we call it a night
uh
just need to get this reel
cleaned up
an hour maybe two
you go ahead ill lock up
dont you have that nice husband
waiting at home for you
well he knows how much
this means to me
he works fulltime at his dads
restaurant so he gets home real late
well suzanne i sure pity
the person who says no to you
no one ever does
why are you tying her up again
why is she tied up again
just leave her alone
untie yourself
leave her alone
if she runs away
as scripture says god is the light
ouch fucker
and that light friends is heaven
heaven is waiting for you
james
james
see nobody ever
called me that before
all anyone ever called me was
jimmy or jimbo or other stuff
my mom told me
that i was named jimmy
after this old movie star
she liked
named jimmy dean
but
well when anyone ever asked me
i always said that i was named jim
after jim morrison of the doors
because you know
he had this great kind of life
like just traveling around
and writing his songs
and having women beg him
to do it to them
even to take his uh
organ out onstage
the kind of life that i always
thought id like to have
i bet he jumps her
all the time you know
like after dinner just bang
right on the kitchen table
fucking during even
yeah maybe both
those skinny bitches they cant
get enough of it you know
theyre always wanting it
thats a medical fact
yeah
its because the nerves in their body
are all bunched up in their snatch
you know what i mean theyre all right
up in there so theyre all whack
i dont think thats true
what are you a doctor
shes a perfectly nice person
you think shes gonna make you
a big movie star huh lydia
just to be on tv
will be something nice
it will be something different
i got something different
for you right here all right
youre a disgusting pig

you know what we should do
we should get some money out of her
what makes you think shes got any
what are you shitting me
her husband
mr fuckingbigcock
owns a fucking guinea restaurant
all right
look at the car she drives
look at her fucking fingernails
big red sculpted glossy nails

new york
well for instance and im suddenly
called on some foreign assignment
like a royal wedding
or a revolution in south america
you cant run from place

or say youve already had the baby
and youve got this blubber

hi ed wake up george
lets hit it
hi everybody
this is suzanne stone with your
latenight signoff weather report
from the wwen weather center
i dont think i need to tell you
that today was a hot one
that old mercury
zoomed on up to 91
thats a recordbreaking temperature
for this date
tomorrow promises to be
more of the same
with relevant numbers
way up in the 90s
humidity to match and maybe
just a hint of a breeze or two
wont be much help with this heat
the kind of heat
that makes me want to head for that
swimming hole with my friend james
strip off everything
including my panties
which you can see through
anyway
poke my soft pink tongue
in his mouth
slide my hand way up
the inside of his leg
until hes so hot
that he rolls over on top of me
and im yelling james
his name
james
what are you doing to me
with your big fat hard
oh jesus
listen to me larry okay
so she finishes
her little docudrama
whatever the fuck it is
she sends it off to someone in new york
and while shes waiting
for an answer
you should forgive the expression
knock her up
knock her up and then
whoa whoa whoa los angeles
what does los angeles got to do with it
a course in what
advanced media
advanced bullshit larry
look im sorry
youre my brother okay
i know you love her and you want
her to succeed and all that
but sometimes man
you just gotta say no
what do you mean how
no thats how
comes to the right of the key
throws up a hook shot
its good
and the score is again tied
here in the first half at the palace
with the ball skeeter jones
brings the ball to the
suzanne
bounce pass to meadows
yeah
jump shot on the way bingo
unbelievable play
what are you doing
just sitting here
waiting for you
larry i asked you to please
keep your feet off the coffee table
we gotta talk about
some things suzanne
what kind of things
i think you know
what kind of things
no no i dont
larry cant this wait
until tomorrow im really tired
no
what
no i dont think it can wait no
sit down
were gonna talk about this stuff
the thing is i think we got
this great future ahead of us
i just want to make sure we both
understand what the priorities are
i think pops gonna let me
take over managing the restaurant
and i got a lot of exciting ideas
like introducing
some new menu items
and bringing in some
live music on the weekends
and maybe
maybe even one night a week
open house for
local singers and comics
which you with your tv background
you could help me with
you know maybe
shooting the acts
and then maybe
selling the tapes
which you could edit yourself
back to the performers
i talked to my folks about it
and they thought itd be a great idea
great idea really
and believe me suze i am not
selling short what youre doing now
i mean the weather report stuff
which youre really good at
but lets face facts
its probably not gonna
lead to any big network offers
now this way
we could be working together
in both our respective fields
doing what a family
is supposed to be doing
a family thats what
im talking about suze huh
what do you think
um
ill think about it
its true that the road
my husband and i chose to travel on
was paved
with many speed bumps
larry said he would never stand
in my way whatever happened
but the word failure
is not part of my vocabulary
my commitment to my career
or my marriage or whatever
has always been 110 percent
regardless of how fast i was growing in my
vocation i would never leave larry behind
the word divorce
was never mentioned
tada what do you think
oh wow
like the color
yeah
it doesnt make me look fat
no
i think im gonna get it
oh jesus hehhehheh
mr maretto is going to
mr maretto pfft yeah right
let me tell you something lydia
no no you wouldnt understand
maybe i would
well you grow up you know
you think its all gonna be
like a fairy tale
like youre sleeping beauty and
along comes this prince charming
and he looks at you
and its nighttime
and he smiles at you
and kisses you
yeah i know that story
and then
then you wake up
and its daylight
and you look at him
its just when you work all day
trying to perfect yourself
and create something meaningful
you expect support
does anyone say did you have a good shoot
or hows the editing
or anything of that nature
i guess not
no
i mean the point is
larry is a nice guy you know
but he just doesnt know
a thing about television
lets get out of here
mrs maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff
like this ankle bracelet
for instance
and a bottle
of real expensive perfume
a scent she called it
which im saving
for a special occasion
no one ever really
bought me stuff before
except my moms boyfriend
chester
who got me for my birthday
when i was 12
a bottle of something called
garden of eden body oil
which he said would be good
for my skin
and which he wanted
to show me how to use
which i let him do
he did other things for a while
when i was 13
i got this mild case of tb
and he wasnt so interested
any more
you just have to block that
out of your memory
like some scary tv movie
where you change the channel
and you pretend
like it never happened
the whole thing
will be like a bad dream
yeah anyway my mom keeps
this gun hidden up in her closet
because of all
the sexfiend killers around
and one time i told him
if he didnt leave me alone
id get it out
and id shoot him
i mean he didnt give me
any more trouble or anything
now i guess i wish
i hadnt told her all that
because maybe it put some ideas
in her mind or something
i dont know
i just told her stuff id never told
anyone because she was my friend
she was my only real friend
where are you going
oh i told you hon
pop and i are going up
to the trade show in freeport
were leaving from the restaurant
i told you
yeah right right
look are you gonna be okay
sure
suze will you think about
what we talked about
i have been
thats great hon
because i believe
i got something here
thats really gonna work
and you know who i want
with me by my side dont you
who
who my best girl thats who
my beautiful little lady
look i left the phone
number on the fridge
and dont forget
to lock the garage
bye
hi
you know what im thinking larry
why dont we get some artificial
plants for the restaurant
good idea
we dont have to water them
exactly
come on liddy
i cant do this mrs maretto
yeah of course you can
you just have to let your natural
sense of rhythm take over
nothing is wrong
i dont think i have one of those
yeah she really stinks at this
here
watch me watch me
watch my hips
you can do that
cant you
i cant do that
of course you can
you just have to move

oh yeah
it was like i was
in one of those
okay you know
those great movies
where everyone is coming out
of their graves
with like
half their faces missing
and their eyes hanging out
and their lips falling off
you know those
i think ill get sick
and theyre all walking around
like real slow like this
theyre all walking like this
and kind of grunting
come on now
oh this will be great
and theyre all looking
for the same thing
for regular live people
to eat their flesh
and drink their blood and all
come on james
smile smile
and they cant help themselves
because theyre dead
and thats just what happens
thats what i felt like
you gotta tell me
whats wrong please
james do you think about me
when were not together
all i do is think about you
when im not with you
im not alive
mrs maretto
youre the best thing
that ever happened to me
i cant do this any more
what
i cant go home every night
and have him try to touch me
and all the time
im just thinking about you
about us
and when i push him away
he has this temper
what do you mean
does he hurt you
oh
there were these women
you know
on the sally jesse raphael show
the other day
they were all wearing disguises
so their husbands couldnt find them
they were living in shelters and
i thought i could live in one of them
if they let me bring walter with me
i could live in one of them
someplace in another state
where no one even knows who i am
look couldnt you
just get a divorce
and then
but then he would get the condo
and hed get the car
and hed take walter from me
hed take walter
listen
i know you think
im just a kid but
i could never do
anything bad to you
or ever hurt you
a guy that does that
to someone like you
doesnt deserve to live
thats the truth
he doesnt deserve to live
no i suppose youre right
he doesnt
oh fuck i love this song
dont you love this song
i dont know
whoo
big wheels keep on turnin
carry me home to see my kin
singin songs
about the southland
i miss alabamy once again
and i think its a sin yes
sweet home alabama
where the skies are so blue
mrs maretto used to let me
drive around in her car
even though i didnt even have
a learners permit
because she said when
shed be living in california
and doing her tv shows
shed make me her assistant
and id have to drive her
around places
and help her answer
her personal fan mail
i guess this is the
most exciting time of my life
it was like living
in a really great movie
except it was kind of xrated
on account of all the sex stuff
you know
hey oh dont stop
you didnt answer my question
what question was that
did you talk to russell
uh yeah i did
well what did he say
he wants a thousand dollars
is that all
and some cds
oh come on
did you get the gun
no not yet
why not
i dont know i guess i thought
youd ask lydia or
i cant ask liddy
you have to ask liddy
dont you understand
i guess so but i thought
do you want me to keep
doing what i was doing
yeah please
okay
then you have to do
what you have to do
oh god
so when will it happen
ow oh come on please dont
i just want to know when
lets just do this
i dont know
whenever jesus
oh
look if you dont know i guess
ill have to find somebody who does
oh mrs maretto
you have to understand this
no i think i do understand
obviously youre not the mature
individual that i thought you were
no
actually i just had a thought
maybe a better way to go
on the whole thing
whats that
russell
what about him
russells enough of a man
to take charge of the situation
well
he looks at me in a certain way
i think hed be very appreciative
of what i could do for him
what do you think
i think we could probably do it
next week
is that soon enough
would you really do that for me
james
anything
and then we can be together
and you can sleep over
and we could do
anything we wanna do
anything
yeah

and that concludes
our broadcast day at wwen
your community access station
serving little hope
and the greater
hope county area
you dont have to talk to those
people if you dont want to
thats what surprised me
that he didnt put up
much of a fight
i mean for a guy
with such a mean temper
when i was standing in the hall
with the gun
i was trying to keep
from being too nervous
by thinking about mrs maretto
and how wed be together
for the rest of our lives
let us take leave of our brother
living in california
florida somewhere
lying around on beaches
where everyone goes topless
and working on her tv show
when the love of christ
which conquers all things
destroys even death itself
amen
all by myself
dont wanna be
all by myself
anymore
all by myself
dont wanna live
all by
i just knew
i dont know why i knew
i just i just knew
it was like a light just went off
in my head and i knew shed
i knew she just got rid of him
just got in her way
anyway um
so um
yeah and then i didnt see her again
that was the last time i saw her
suzanne
im sorry could we
could we stop for a second
what do you want liddy
just to talk
look im really busy right now
what do you want to talk about
what were gonna do
we
you and me and jimmy
im scared
theres nothing to be scared about
you and i and jimmy are gonna
stay miles away from each other
thats what were gonna do
well hes here
here shit where
across the street
jesus christ get in here
get in here quick
now you listen to me
you tell james to stay away all right
what is the matter with you people
dont you watch mystery theater
he says that he needs to see you
and that hes dying of love
tell him to call a doctor
and russell wants
his money and his cds
oh really you tell russell
if he doesnt keep his mouth shut
hes gonna be playing his cds
in the gas chamber
suzanne
what else what do you want
just to be like before
like we were
lydia we cant be
like we were
we have to forget
we ever knew each other
go on get out of here
what about the tv show
in california and everything
oh jesus liddy get real
god
what happened
what did she say
did you tell her i love her
yes i did
she said you were sick
and you needed to see a doctor
ed ed
hello suzanne
look
hows it going
ed im real unhappy i havent been able
to give you an exclusive on everything
pardon
i mean
theres all these news markets
just clamoring for attention
and i have to consider
future possibilities
of course you know
i understand absolutely
good good
ed i need to collect my tapes
with the publicity ive decided
to finish my documentary
well theres gonna be
a slight problem
problem
the cops took them
what do you mean
they came and they took them away
why would they do that
they said it was standard procedure
but those tapes belong to me
well technically speaking suzanne
those tapes actually belong to us
i mean to the station
until such time
ill show you the section that piqued
the cops interest you might say
today were talking about
sexually transmitted diseases
and teenage attitudes
toward them
would anyone like to start it off
personally im against them
lets see if we can be
more specific
what do you think of
when i say the word aids
queers
perversion
the old hershey highway
settle down children
what about you liddy
supposing you were in a sexual
relationship with a student
would you expect that person
to wear a condom
i dont know i mean
i guess it would depend on you
know what kind of person he was
yeah a blind person
how about you james
are you personally concerned
about aids
oh um
well in my present situation
well in the relationship
i got going
i dont worry
about that type of thing
shes not that kind of person
shes very clean
thats the piece geraldo used
with some minor editing
and itwas on first edition
and american justice
we made a few bucks on this one
and got a nice credit
in the holy spirit
i want you to bow down
arms straight up
thank you jesus
thank you for my life
think a little bit about your life
think about what you can part with
a dollar ten dollars
a hundred dollars
how important is jesus
in your life
as you can imagine
i was shocked
beyond comprehension
i mean to think that these
disadvantaged youngsters
who i had taken under my wing
and spent my time with
and who would only stand
to ultimately benefit
from my media savvy
to think that they might be
responsible for this heinous crime
it simply boggles one
with disbelief
of course i realized
and i hope
this doesnt sound callous
that the upside to all this
assuming justice prevailed
is that i would have
an extremely marketable commodity
something that even pbs
would take an interest in
which would mean
a smaller audience
but a much larger prestige factor
want to tell us about it
i got nothing to tell
your friend
russell told us plenty
like what
he said your dick
was bigger than your brain
heh heh oh yeah
he really said that
i dont think he meant it
as a compliment
fucking amateurs
who
listen as career criminals
you guys flunk out of kindergarten
your prints are on the gun
your pal left a trail of clam shells
all over the murder scene
you boys did everything
but leave a business card
theres larry marettos blood
all over those shoes you wore
yeah
and pieces of larrys brains
he used to beat her up all the time
uhhuh
he said he was gonna kill her
im sure he did
we were going to california
because
she said i had real potential
in tv because of my voice
doing what with your voice
sports
like being a sports announcer
so when did you
start banging her
it wasnt like that
what was it like
it was just
we were
you were what
in love
we were in love
how many times how many times
did you do it you and mrs maretto
i dont know
lots i guess
where
in her bed
in her and her dead husbands bed
yeah sometimes
where else
in her car
in her car
yeah
and once at school
jesus christ at school huh
yeah in the back of the gym
and once late at night at the station
where she does her weather reports
and twice at the motel
on piedmont
oh and the back of
russells truck heh
and the movie theater
on hayworth
oh a couple times
at her parents house
when they were away
on some vacation or something
and
also in the field
behind the gas station
but uh
probably where you get your
doughnuts and coffee and stuff
its close
suzanne
hi liddy
is it my imagination
or is that diet working huh
you lost a few pounds
in there hahaha
i dont know i havent
been eating much lately
whats this
about talking to the police
i just figured that russell
would tell them everything so
look no ones gonna believe
anything russell or jimmy say
theyre just a couple of punks
they wouldnt be in this deep shit
if they kept their mouths shut
theres no evidence
that were involved
i wasnt anywhere
near the house
and if they did find out anything you
know whod be in trouble dont you
you would heh heh
what do you mean
if you hadnt gotten
your mothers gun
larry would still be alive
wouldnt he
but you asked me to
no i didnt
no jimmy did
dont you remember that
but you asked jimmy and you
told russell that youd pay
no i dont think so
now you listen to me
i never gave russell any money
do you understand
the way i remember it was your
plan all along you and jimmy
you had this fixation about me
and you were getting a kick out it
like people with your
sexual problems tend to do
russell went along with you because russell
is basically an evil little fucking scumbag
who ill bet you were having some kind of
sex with in spite of your lesbian tendencies
wait a minute
wait for what
i thought we were friends
well okay then
hm
can you take some advice
from a friend
you keep your fucking mouth shut
its their word against mine
who are they
a bunch of 16yearold losers
who grew up in trailers
whose parents sit around drinking
and screwing their cousins
im a professional person
for chrissake
i come from a good home
who do you think
a jury would believe
thank god we still have
legal procedures in this country
the court has wisely ruled this is
a clear case of police entrapment
the tapes were found to be inadmissible
evidence in the courtroom
my client was granted bail
in the amount of 200000
which was steep but at least
she will be able to assist us
in the preparation of her defense
do you have a statement you have
something youd like to say
suzanne suzanne
please say something
i just wanna say
its nice to live in a country
where life liberty
and all the rest of it
still stand for something
thank you
what are you gonna do now
im gonna go home
and walk my dog thank you
how are you gonna
address the questions
will you take the stand
in your defense
suzanne did you get those kids
to kill your husband
i loved larry maretto
with all my heart
but the fact is
my husband had
a serious cocaine problem
there
ive said it
i finally said it
i believe that while
i was making my documentary
teens speak out
james and russell
became acquainted
with my husband
without me knowing
and got him addicted to drugs
and became his main supplier
and when he tried
to break free of them
or maybe when he told them
that he was thinking
of turning them in to the law
they killed him
i had no intention
of revealing this dark side
of my late husbands character
because i wanted to spare
his parents the pain
but i just dont have a choice
any more
i have to defend myself
with the truth
there were times when
and i know someday
when my fight is over
i will be joining my husband
in the heaven that
he so fervently believed in
and that was the last time that we
the last time we saw her
and that
that pretty well brings us
up to date
until your phone call
which i must say
wasnt entirely unexpected
since in the last few days a number
of interesting offers for my story
have been literally pouring in
from the networks
and some major movie studios
i totally understand why well be
keeping this meeting confidential
until such time as we may come
to a mutually beneficial agreement
and i have to admit
that i really do enjoy
this spystory aspect of our first
rendezvous if i may call it that
because i think that being
a good investigative reporter
is very much like
being a kind of secret agent
i hope you enjoy
viewing this document
which i believe could serve
as the first draft
that you hollywood people
are so richly rewarded for
well i guess thats a wrap
come on walter
suzanne
yes
finally the famous
suzanne maretto
oh
how nice to meet you
ow heh
did you come all the way
from hollywood
i came a long distance to see you
whos this
oh
this is walter
walter hi walter
i dont know why
but i thought that youd be older
running a big studio
and everything
well i am older
come on out i want to
show you something
okay
i brought my tape
lets go lets go
for a walk come on
whoa
where are we going
to show you
what
whoa
it has to do with your story
it is so funny
i dont see why
we have to go here
yeah
and this is for you
thank you very much
youre welcome
it looks good thanks mrs maretto
marettos
i understand
thank you
ill be here
every day for life
plus 30 years if i live that long
russell copped a plea
and got only 16 years
i miss him
he was my friend
and lydia too she was okay
mostly mrs maretto
and the weird thing is
now its hard for me to even
remember what she looked like
you know
except when i dream about her
which i do every night
i dream im at a baseball game
and im way up
in the broadcasting booth
and im calling all the plays
and shes sitting right next to me
with her hand on my leg
feeling me up
i can hardly wait
to get to sleep at night
suzanne used to say that youre
not really anybody in america
unless youre on tv
because whats the point
of doing anything worthwhile
if theres nobody watching
so when people are watching
it makes you a better person
so if everybody was on tv
all the time
everybody would be better people
but if everybody was on tv
all the time
there wouldnt be
anybody left to watch
thats where i get confused
anyhow theyre flying me
to go on oprah next weekend
i hope shes gonna give me
some diet tips
and phil donahue called too
to tell you the truth
im kind of nervous about that one
because i honestly cant follow
what hes saying most of the time
theres some others too
that i cant really remember offhand
but its really something when you think
that im the one whos gonna be famous
suzanne would die if she knew
end sticks
when i look out my window
many sights to see
and when i look in my window
so many different people to be
then its strange
so strange
you got to pick up every stitch
must be the season
of the witch
must be the season
of the witch yeah
must be the season
of the witch
oh when i look
over my shoulder
what do you think i see
some other cat lookin over
his shoulder at me
and hes strange
sure is strange
you got to pick up every stitch
you got to pick up
every stitch yeah
beatniks are out to make it rich
oh no
must be the season
of the witch
must be the season
of the witch yeah
must be the season
of the witch
you got to pick up every stitch
the rabbits runnin in the ditch
beatniks are out to make it rich
