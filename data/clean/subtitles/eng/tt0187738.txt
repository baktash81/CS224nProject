or undergone any ear

with some unusual results
on your blood test

a very rare phenotype 
one we haven t
encountered before 
what  what are you
talking about 
  who are you  no 
  sit down  please 
what is this 
this is a good news bad news
scenario  jared 
good news for us   
bad news   
   for you 
forget what you think
you know  
vampires exist 
my name is blade 
i was born half human 
half vampire 
they call me
 the daywalker  
i have all their strengths 
none of their weaknesses 
except for the thirst 
20 years ago i met a man
that changed that 
whistler 
he taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay 
taught me the rules 
gave me the weapons
to hunt with 
silver  garlic 
sunlight 
two years ago
he was attacked 
they took him 
and turned him into
the thing i hate most 
i should have
finished him off 
now i m hunting him 
i will find him 
and nothing will stand
in my way 
daywalker s here 
stop him 
where is he 
hey 
no  no 
take me to him  and i ll
consider you a loose end 
catch you later 
old man    look at what
they ve done to you 
let s go home 
lock up your daughters 
boys and girls 
the dark knight returns 
  need a toke of the smokage  b 
  later 
cut the lights 
you found him 
you didn t kill him 
give me a hand 
i got a bad feeling
about this  b 
listen to his breathing 
he s already dying  he s in pain 
why don t you just put him
out of his misery right now 
they had him on stasis
in a halfway house 
i m giving him an accelerated
retro viral detox 
like a heroin addict 
make him go cold turkey
in one night 
shit ain t
going to work  man 
i say you kill the motherfucker
right now 
get out 
if there s anything left
of you in there  whistler 
listen up 
in the morning those blinds
are going to open
whether you re cured   
or not 
hey  man 
i didn t mean to call him  
listen to me  blade 
you re going to have
to finish me off 
no 
give me
that damn gun 
now walk away 
stubborn son of a bitch 
how do you feel 
like hammered shit 
how d you find me 
i started out in moscow 
then romania 
  they kept moving you around 
  how long was i gone 
  months 
  too long 
years 
they tortured me
almost to death 
and then let me heal
in a vat of blood
so they could go
at it again 
sorry sons of bitches
could have at least
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it 
where s my arc welder 
what s up  nice to meet you 
i heard a lot about you 
i m josh  you can call me  scud  
everybody does 
tell me something  skid  
no  man  it s  scud  
like  stud  
whatever 
  what are you doing here 
  the pimpmobile 
just a little aftermarket
modification 
  nitrous oxide and shit like that 
  oh  yeah 
you gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping 
the whole package will crank
that betty up  maybe 300 horsepower 
you ll burn the thing out
before your next oil change 
where did you dig up
this shitbird  anyway 
what the fuck
is your problem  poppy 
my problem is i ve been
sucking blood clots for two years 
i get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life s work 
we jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass 
  our operation 
  yeah 
our operation  i built
this operation  you ass wipe 
motion sensors 
lt s on three  gentlemen 
human 
body temperature  50 
i d guess suckhead 
fried  they re using
magnesium flares 
they ve got your security
system scoped out 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
i don t trust you  
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
cool outfit 
guard lights 
we represent the ruling body
of the vampire nation 
they are offering you
a truce 
they want to meet
with you 
scud 
take off your mask 
my name is asad 
this is nyssa 
you have been our most
feared enemy 
but now there s something else
loose on the streets 
something worse
than you 
what s so funny 
they tell stories about blade
as the bogeyman 
frankly 
i m disappointed 
you hear that  b 
she s disappointed 
he agreed
to come along so easily 
come on  b  show her 
pretty please 
semtex 
enough explosives
to level a city block 
you still disappointed 
the guards look human 
they re probably familiars 
you sure about this 
well  if i m not   
the true power
of the vampire nation lies here 
father 
blade  this is
overlord eli damaskinos 
it has been said 
 be proud of your enemy
and enjoy his success  
in that regard 
i should thank you 
  for what 
  eliminating deacon frost 
you did us a favor 
karel kounen 
  you re human 
  barely  i m a lawyer 
european health consortium 
as you may know 
vampirism is   
a horrible virus  carried
in the saliva of predators 
in 72 hours  it spreads through
the human bloodstream 
creating new
parasitic organs 
like cancer 
cancer with a purpose 
unfortunately 
viruses evolve  too 
we ve encountered
a new one 
we dubbed it
the reaper strain 
and like any good pathogen 
it appears to have found a carrier 
there   
jared nomak 
born a vampire 
but an anomaly like you 
unlike the rest of us 
however 
he feeds on not just humans 
but vampires as well 
  looks like he was doing me a favor 
  you re missing the point 
their vampire victims
don t die   
they turn 
they become carriers 
you ve got to understand 
these things are like crack addicts 
they need to feed daily 
nomak s been up for 72 hours 
by our estimates  there are already
a dozen reapers 
there ll be hundreds
before the week is out 
thousands within a matter of months 
do the math 
wait  let me get
this right 
you want me
to hunt them    for you 
when they are finished
with us 
who do you think
they ll turn on next 
your precious humans 
not one of them
will be left 
we spent two years training
a small tactical unit  
the bloodpack 
we want you to lead them 
two years 
we ve been training
to hunt you 
so  b man 
what do you think 
sounds like a plan 
what do you really think 
they re going to fuck us
the first chance they get 
so  we ain t
gonna do this  right 
we ll play along for now 
they ll take us in deeper
than we ve ever been 
get a chance to see
how their world really ticks 
i had enough of their world 
they re just shitting bricks
because they re no longer
top of the food chain 
damn  man 
i m really worried about him 
i know he s
your friend and all 
but i think you should
watch him 
nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night 
looking to get
hooked up 
maybe 
what do you have 
no problem 
horse  hawaiian lce 
whatever you need 
whatever i need 
i like that 
what if i need you 
so  so sweet 
they are ready
whenever you are  daywalker 
blade 
meet the bloodpack 
lighthammer 
verlaine 
priest 
snowman 
chupa 
and reinhardt 
hey  um   
me and the gang
were wondering   
what was that 
can you blush 
here we go 
oh  i get it 
i see now 
you ve been training for two years
to take me out 
and now  here i am 
ooh  so exciting 
isn t it 
okay  here s your chance 
come on 
what are you waiting for 
here i am 
right here in front of you 
adolf here gets the first shot 
come on 
what are you looking at her for 
you need permission 
maybe you need
a little bit of incentive 
okay  i can help
with that 
what s the matter 
missed that 
it s okay 
i can do it again 
come on 
what  do you need a manual 
  do it 
  kill the bastard 
now you ve got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head 
silver nitrate  rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it 
i ll have
the detonator with me 
and you   if you so much
as look at me wrong  
from now on
we work as a unit 
you ll be taking
orders from me 
any questions 
good 
you want to catch the hunter 
you start with the prey 
we ll target all the night places
where vampires congregate 
blood banks  safe houses 
the bigger the better 
so    what s first 
the house of pain 
where s the entrance 
i don t see any signs 
no vampire glyphs 
no  because of you 
we ve had to rethink our habits 
tighten our security 
have a closer look 
nice 
 38   45
and 9mm caliber 
all with foil capsules
at the tip
filled with silver nitrate 
and garlic extract 
this hyper velocity
stake gun
spits out a silver stake
at 6 000 feet per second 
since you suckers
don t like sunlight 
we ve modified the gun s
entry light with a uv filter 
pop it open  
instant uv light 
filter s on 
no problem 
yo  b  check this out 
it s got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system 
the vials are filled with
an anti coagulant called edta 
one punch with this  you ll blow
your target up like a balloon 
the cartridge ejects 
automatic reload 
nice 
  let s go 
  you won t pass for one of us 
  like i give a shit 
  no  he s right 
why don t you post up
on the roof over there 
cover our backs 
so the bloodpack s calling
the shots now  huh 
great 
better curb that dog of yours
or we ll do it for you 
keep pushing  asshole 
i ya  i against i
flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind
two of a kind 
but one won t survive
my images reflect
in the enemy s eye
and his images reflect
in mine the same time
i ya  i ya  i against l
flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind
two of a kind 
but one won t survive
survive  survive
