vampires exist
my name is blade
i was born half human
half vampire
they call me
the daywalker
i have all their strengths
none of their weaknesses
except for the thirst
20 years ago i met a man
that changed that
whistler
he taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay
taught me the rules
gave me the weapons
to hunt with
silver garlic
sunlight
two years ago
he was attacked
they took him
and turned him into
the thing i hate most
i should have
finished him off
now im hunting him
i will find him
and nothing will stand
in my way
daywalkers here
stop him
where is he
hey

consider you a loose end

theyve done to you

give me a hand
i got a bad feeling
about this b
listen to his breathing
hes already dying hes in pain
why dont you just put him
out of his misery right now
they had him on stasis
in a halfway house
im giving him an accelerated
retroviral detox
like a heroin addict
make him go cold turkey
in one night
shit aint
going to work man
i say you kill the motherfucker
right now

if theres anything left
of you in there whistler

i started out in moscow
then romania
they kept moving you around
how long was i gone
months
too long
years
they tortured me
almost to death
and then let me heal
in a vat of blood
so they could go
at it again
sorry sons of bitches

fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it
wheres my arc welder

of the vampire nation
they are offering you
a truce
they want to meet
with you
scud
take off your mask
my name is asad
this is nyssa
you have been our most
feared enemy
but now theres something else
loose on the streets
something worse
than you
whats so funny
they tell stories about blade
as the bogeyman
frankly
im disappointed
you hear that b
shes disappointed
he agreed
to come along so easily
come on b show her
pretty please
semtex
enough explosives
to level a city block
you still disappointed
the guards look human
theyre probably familiars
you sure about this
well if im not
the true power
of the vampire nation lies here
father
blade this is
overlord eli damaskinos
it has been said
be proud of your enemy
and enjoy his success
in that regard
i should thank you
for what
eliminating deacon frost
you did us a favor
karel kounen
youre human
barely im a lawyer
european health consortium
as you may know
vampirism is
a horrible virus carried
in the saliva of predators
in 72 hours it spreads through
the human bloodstream
creating new
parasitic organs
like cancer
cancer with a purpose
unfortunately
viruses evolve too
weve encountered
a new one
we dubbed it
the reaper strain
and like any good pathogen
it appears to have found a carrier
there
jared nomak
born a vampire
but an anomaly like you
unlike the rest of us
however
he feeds on not just humans
but vampires as well
looks like he was doing me a favor
youre missing the point
their vampire victims
dont die
they turn
they become carriers
youve got to understand
these things are like crack addicts
they need to feed daily
nomaks been up for 72 hours
by our estimates there are already
a dozen reapers
therell be hundreds
before the week is out
thousands within a matter of months
do the math
wait let me get
this right
you want me
to hunt them for you
when they are finished
with us
who do you think
theyll turn on next
your precious humans
not one of them
will be left
we spent two years training
a small tactical unit
the bloodpack
we want you to lead them
two years
weve been training
to hunt you
so bman
what do you think
sounds like a plan
what do you really think
theyre going to fuck us
the first chance they get
so we aint
gonna do this right
well play along for now
theyll take us in deeper
than weve ever been
get a chance to see
how their world really ticks
i had enough of their world
theyre just shitting bricks
because theyre no longer
top of the food chain
damn man
im really worried about him
i know hes
your friend and all
but i think you should
watch him
nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night
looking to get
hooked up
maybe
what do you have
no problem
horse hawaiian lce

now youve got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head
silver nitrate rigged to go off

ill have
the detonator with me
and you if you so much
as look at me wrong
from now on
we work as a unit
youll be taking
orders from me

well target all the night places
where vampires congregate
blood banks safe houses
the bigger the better
so whats first
the house of pain

weve had to rethink our habits
tighten our security
have a closer look
nice
38 45
and 9mm caliber
all with foil capsules
at the tip
filled with silver nitrate
and garlic extract
this hypervelocity
stake gun
spits out a silver stake
at 6000 feet per second
since you suckers
dont like sunlight
weve modified the guns
entry light with a uv filter
pop it open
instant uv light
filters on
no problem
yo b check this out
its got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system
the vials are filled with
an anticoagulant called edta
one punch with this youll blow
your target up like a balloon
the cartridge ejects
automatic reload
