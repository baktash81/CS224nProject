shed be hugged kissed
and loved
and no one would know
whats inside that giant head
give me your keys
hey polly
lts susanna
just play something
lf talking did shit
wed be out of here by now
when youre alone
and life is making you lonely
you can always go
downtown
when youve got worries
all the noise and the hurry
seems to help i know
downtown
just listen to the music
in the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalks
where the neon lights are pretty
how can you lose
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles
forget all your cares and go downtown
back to your room please
things will be great when youre
downtown
mcwilley is gonna wake up
give me the guitar
youre gonna get me fired
youll be dancing with him
before the night is over
give me the guitar
happy again
no no
lts okay lts okay
come here
youll get me fired
you know that
downtown
everythings great
when youre downtown
lm writing you up
l am sick of this bullshit
ls she here
you can go in now
what did she do
they drugged nurse mcwilley
good morning susanna
good morning
how are you
lm fine l guess
sit down
you look tired
polly freaked out last night and we
stayed up singing to her lisa and l
have you become friends with lisa
why ls that bad
does it feel bad
no
before you came here did you
have many girlfriends
not really
would you say that before you came here
your friends consisted mainly
of boys of men
does it say in there
that lm promiscuous
why do you choose that word
how many guys would l have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous
textbook promiscuous
what do you think
ten eight five
how many girls would a guy have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous
ten 20 1 09
someone whos compulsively
promiscuous
might engage in a sex act
with a guest in their room
and then engage in another sex act
during the same day with an orderly
am l in trouble for kissing an orderly
or giving my boyfriend a blowjob
melvin says
you have some very interesting
theories about your illness
you believe there is
a mystical undertow in life
quicksands of shadows
another one of my theories is that you
people dont know what youre doing
you acknowledge a problem
coping with this quicksand
l have a problem coping with this
hospital l wanna leave
l cant do that
l signed myself in
l can sign myself out
you signed yourself into our care
we decide when you leave
youre not ready for it susanna
your progress has plateaued
does that disappoint you
lm ambivalent
ln fact thats my new favourite word
do you know what that means
ambivalence
l dont care
lf its your favourite word
l wouldve
lt means  l dont care
thats what it means
on the contrary susanna
ambivalence suggests strong
feelings in opposition
the prefix as in ambidextrous
means  both
the rest of it in latin
means vigour
the word suggests that you are torn
between two opposing courses
of action
will l stay or will l go
am l sane or am l crazy
those arent courses of action
they can be dear for some
well then its the wrong word
no
l think its perfect
what world is this
what kingdom
what shores of what worlds
lts a very big question
youre faced with susanna
the choice of your life
how much will you indulge
in your flaws
what are your flaws
are they flaws
lf you embrace them will you commit
yourself to hospital for life
big questions big decisions
not surprising you profess
carelessness about them
ls that it
for now
this way susanna
john was moved to the mens ward
and lisa never came back
from dr wicks office
we live in a time of doubt
the institutions we once trusted
no longer seem reliable
daisy sent us a postcard

hello puddycat
kitty
you are so cute
checks
wheres georgina
shes staying with polly tonight
theyre playing with your cat
did they find lisa
no
l couldnt stand up to her
a decent person would
have done something
shut her up
gone upstairs
talked to daisy
melvin said you went upstairs
too late
what would you have said to her
l dont know
that l was sorry
that lll never know what
it was like to be her
but l know what its like
to wanna die
how it hurts to smile
how you try to fit in
but you cant
how you hurt yourself
on the outside
to try to kill the thing
on the inside
susanna its all well and good
to tell me all this
but youve got to tell
some of this to your doctors
how am l supposed to recover
when l dont even
understand my disease
but you do understand it
you spoke very clearly
about it a second ago
but l think what youve got
to do is put it down
put it away
put it in your notebook
but get it out of yourself
away so you cant
curl up with it anymore
lisa thinks its a gift
that it lets you see the truth
lisas been here for eight years
lm so sorry
l was a pig
lts all right listen
do not drop anchor here
understand
when you dont want to feel
death can seem like a dream
but seeing death
really seeing it
makes dreaming about it
fucking ridiculous
maybe theres a moment
growing up
when something peels back
maybe we look for secrets because
we cant believe our minds
though i missed lisa
life was easier without her
a thought is a hard thing
to control
all i know is that
i began to feel again
crazy sane
whatever i was i knew there was
only one way back to the world
and that was to use the place
to talk
so i saw the great and wonderful
dr wick three times a week
and i let her hear
every thought in my head
do you think maybe l have esp
or something that lm gifted
perhaps
you think l can be home
by thanksgiving
nothings happened
in weeks you know
the point is control
yeah and here l am
in control off meds
no headaches sleeping sound
oh will you help me
can you help me
you dont need to be helped
any longer
youve always had the power
to go back to kansas
i have
then why didnt you tell her before
because she wouldnt have
believed me
she had to learn it for herself
what have you learned dorothy
i think that it
that it wasnt enough just to want
to see uncle henry and auntie em
and if i ever go looking
for my hearts desire again
i wont look any further
than my own back yard
because if it isnt there
i never really lost it
to begin with
is that right
thats all it is
thanks joe
go away go away
lts me
lts been a while
and l just wanted to say hey
you okay
fabulous
youre gonna be late
grettas waiting for you
l gotta go dr wick
they still fucking with you
theyre
actually theyre letting me out
oh thats great
you better go
well my dad got me a job
a parttime job
at a bookstore in harvard square
and l got an apartment
with a phone so l can
stay in touch
and lll be seeing sonia
twice a week
ls that your longterm plan
to work in retail

cynthia crowley
susanna kaysen
l dont think l need
sleeping pills darling
you want to be rested for tomorrow
last nights a long one
good girl katie cooper
rosemary jones
teresa mccullian
ruby
lf l spread my fingers out
my hand looked more human
so l did that
but it wasnt tiring holding my
fingers apart so l let them relax
and then l turned my hand over
the back wasnt much better
my veins bulged
shut up lm reading
shut up
l can honestly say that my memory
has been transformed
by freuds definition
lve achieved mental health
and my discharge sheet
reads recovered
recovered
dont do this
whatever it was
had l stopped arguing
with my personality
recovered
we were reading your book
were having a little readaloud
celebrate the wisdom youre
taking into the world
try to learn something
grow as people
when you were a baby
they strapped you to a board
you think georgina doesnt
wanna leave
and lm criminally insane
what are you guys doing here
lisas eyes once so magnetic
now just look empty
that is mine
that is mine
georgina lies only to people
who keep her here
sometimes l think she wants
to live in oz forever
how perceptive
you better erase that thing
my father is the head of the cla
and he could have you dead in minutes
ln this world looks are everything
sometimes l think pollys sweetness
and purity arent genuine at all
but a desperate attempt to make it
easier for us to look at her
so nice of you to pass judgment on us
now that youre cured
what the fuck are you doing lisa
lm playing the villain
like you want
l give you everything you want
no you dont
you wanted your file
l got it
you wanted out l got you out
you needed money l found you some
l told you the truth
l didnt write it in a book
l told you to your face
l told daisy what everybody knew and
wouldnt say and she killed herself
l played the fucking villain
just like you wanted
why would l want that
because it makes you
the good guy sweet pea
you come back here all sweetness
and light and sad and contrite
and everybody wrings their hands
congratulating you on your bravery
meanwhile lm blowing guys at the
bus station for money
stop it lisa shes too
shut up polly
where are you going
lm talking to you
where are you going
lm talking to you
you dont like me anymore
no l dont
because youre free
you think youre free
lm free
you dont know what freedom is
lm free
l can breathe and you
youll go choke on your
average fucking mediocre life
there are too many buttons
in the world
too many buttons
and theyre just
theres way too many
begging to be pressed
theyre just begging to be pressed
you know theyre just
begging to be pressed
and it makes me wonder
lt makes me fucking wonder
why doesnt anybody ever press mine
why am l so neglected
why doesnt anybody reach in
and rip out the truth
and tell me
that lm a fucking whore
and that my parents
wish l were dead
because youre dead already lisa
no one cares if you die lisa
because youre dead already
your heart is cold
thats why you keep
coming back here
youre not free
you need this place
you need it to feel alive
lts pathetic
lve wasted a year of my life
and maybe everyone
out there is a liar
and maybe the whole world
is stupid and ignorant
but ld rather be in it
ld rather be fucking in it
than down here with you
dont dont
dont
oh god
did you get it
l had to trade with a transvestite
in the mens ward
thanks
lm not really dead
l know
lm gonna miss you susie q
no youre not
youre gonna get out of here
and youre gonna come and see me
hey georgina
you know all that stuff
l write in my journal
l dont know what lm saying
theyre just thoughts
maybe lm the liar
maybe not
see you
you think if l left ruby here
youd take care of her for me
let me play with her
when l come for my therapy
bye ruby
remember me when you shave your legs
declared healthy
and sent back into the world
my final diagnosis
a recovered borderline
what that means i still dont know
was i ever crazy
maybe
or maybe life is
l remember you
where are you going
1 7 burlingame
all right
crazy isnt being broken
or swallowing a dark secret
its you or me
amplified
if you ever told a lie
and enjoyed it
if you ever wished you
could be a child forever
they were not perfect
but they were my friends
and by the 70s
most of them were out
living lives
some ive seen
