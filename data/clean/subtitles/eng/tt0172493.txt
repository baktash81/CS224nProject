they re building a new
disneyland in florida 
lf l could have any job 
l d be a professional cinderella 
you could be snow white 
polly could be minnie mouse and then   
   she d be hugged  kissed
and loved   
   and no one would know
what s inside that giant head 
give me your keys 
hey  polly 
lt s susanna 
just play something 
lf talking did shit 
we d be out of here by now 
when you re alone
and life is making you lonely
you can always go
downtown
when you ve got worries
all the noise and the hurry
seems to help  i know
downtown
just listen to the music
in the traffic in the city
linger on the sidewalks
where the neon lights are pretty
how can you lose 
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles
forget all your cares and go downtown
back to your room  please 
things will be great when you re
downtown
mcwilley is gonna wake up 
give me the guitar 
you re gonna get me fired 
you ll be dancing with him
before the night is over
 give me the guitar 
 happy again
no  no 
lt s okay  lt s okay 
come here 
you ll get me fired 
you know that 
downtown
everything s great   
    when you re downtown
l m writing you up 
l am sick of this bullshit 
ls she here 
you can go in now 
 what did she do 
 they drugged nurse mcwilley 
 good morning  susanna 
 good morning 
how are you 
l m fine  l guess 
sit down 
you look tired 
polly freaked out last night and we
stayed up singing to her  lisa and l 
have you become friends with lisa 
why  ls that bad 
 does it feel bad 
 no 
before you came here  did you
have many girlfriends 
not really 
would you say that before you came here 
your friends consisted mainly   
   of boys  of men 
does it say in there
that l m promiscuous 
why do you choose that word 
how many guys would l have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous 
textbook promiscuous 
what do you think 
ten  eight  five 
how many girls would a guy have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous 
ten  20  1 09 
someone who s compulsively
promiscuous   
   might engage in a sex act
with a guest in their room   
   and then engage in another sex act
during the same day with an orderly 
am l in trouble for kissing an orderly
or giving my boyfriend a blowjob 
melvin says   
   you have some very interesting
theories about your illness 
you believe there is
a mystical undertow in life 
  quicksands of shadows   
another one of my theories is that you
people don t know what you re doing 
you acknowledge a problem
coping with this quicksand 
l have a problem coping with this
hospital  l wanna leave 
l can t do that 
l signed myself in 
l can sign myself out 
you signed yourself into our care 
we decide when you leave 
you re not ready for it  susanna 
your progress has plateaued 
does that disappoint you 
l m ambivalent 
ln fact  that s my new favourite word 
do you know what that means 
ambivalence 
l don t care 
lf it s your favourite word 
l would ve  
lt means    l don t care   
that s what it means 
on the contrary  susanna 
ambivalence suggests strong
feelings in opposition 
the prefix  as in ambidextrous   
   means    both   
the rest of it  in latin 
means   vigour   
the word suggests that you are torn   
   between two opposing courses
of action 
will l stay or will l go 
am l sane or am l crazy 
those aren t courses of action 
they can be  dear  for some 
well  then  it s the wrong word 
no 
l think it s perfect 
  what world is this 
what kingdom 
what shores of what worlds   
lt s a very big question
you re faced with  susanna 
the choice of your life 
how much will you indulge
in your flaws 
what are your flaws 
are they flaws 
lf you embrace them  will you commit
yourself to hospital for life 
big questions  big decisions 
not surprising you profess
carelessness about them 
ls that it 
for now 
this way  susanna 
john was moved to the men s ward 
and lisa never came back
from dr  wick s office 
we live in a time of doubt 
the institutions we once trusted
no longer seem reliable 
daisy sent us a postcard

you re just jealous  lisa   
   because l got better 
because l was released 
because l have a chance 
and a life 
they didn t release you
because you re better 
they just gave up 
you call this a life 
taking daddy s money  buying your
dollies and your knickknacks 
eating his fucking chicken 
fattening up like a prize heifer 
you changed the scenery 
but not the situation   
   and the warden makes house calls 
and everybody knows 
everybody knows that he fucks you 
what they don t know   
   is that you like it 
 you like it 
 shut the fuck up 
man  it s cool  lt s okay 
lt s fucking fine 
a man is a dick is a man
is a dick is a chicken

whatever 
you like being mrs  randone 
probably all you ve ever known 
have fun in florida 
has she come down yet 
no 
but she s been playing
that shit all morning 
why does my heart go on beating 
why do these eyes of mine cry 
don t they know
it s the end of the world
it ended when you said
goodbye
daisy 
oh  my god 
what an idiot 
 yes  l need an ambulance 
 make it a hearse 
daisy randone  she killed herself 
23 vicar street 
yes  please hurry 
you pressed her buttons 
now you re taking her money 
l didn t press shit 
she was waiting for an excuse 
pack up 
we have to go 
all right 
we have to go 
now we have money 
don t be stupid 
all right  fine 
be stupid 
we should send someone
for a litter box 
can l pet the kitty 
be careful 
 hello  puddy cat 
 kitty 
you are so cute 
checks 
where s georgina 
she s staying with polly tonight 
they re playing with your cat 
did they find lisa 
no 
l couldn t stand up to her 
a decent person would
have done something 
shut her up 
gone upstairs 
talked to daisy 
melvin said you went upstairs 
too late 
what would you have said to her 
l don t know 
that l was sorry 
that l ll never know what
it was like to be her 
but l know what it s like
to wanna die 
how it hurts to smile 
how you try to fit in 
but you can t 
how you hurt yourself
on the outside   
   to try to kill the thing
on the inside 
susanna  it s all well and good
to tell me all this 
but you ve got to tell
some of this to your doctors 
how am l supposed to recover   
   when l don t even
understand my disease 
but you do understand it 
you spoke very clearly
about it a second ago 
but l think what you ve got
to do is put it down 
put it away 
put it in your notebook 
but get it out of yourself 
away  so you can t
curl up with it anymore 
lisa thinks it s a gift 
that it lets you see the truth 
lisa s been here for eight years 
l m so sorry 
 l was a pig 
 lt s all right  listen 
do not drop anchor here 
understand 
when you don t want to feel   
    death can seem like a dream 
but seeing death   
   really seeing it   
   makes dreaming about it
fucking ridiculous 
maybe there s a moment 
growing up   
    when something peels back 
maybe we look for secrets because
we can t believe our minds 
though i missed lisa 
life was easier without her 
a thought is a hard thing
to control 
all i know is that
i began to feel again 
crazy  sane 
whatever i was  i knew there was
only one way back to the world   
   and that was to use the place   
    to talk 
so i saw the great and wonderful
dr  wick three times a week   
   and i let her hear
every thought in my head 
do you think maybe l have esp
or something  that l m gifted 
perhaps 
you think l can be home
by thanksgiving 
nothing s happened
in weeks  you know 
the point is control 
yeah  and here l am 
in control  off meds   
   no headaches  sleeping sound 
oh  will you help me 
can you help me 
you don t need to be helped
any longer 
you ve always had the power
to go back to kansas 
i have 
then why didn t you tell her before 
because she wouldn t have
believed me 
she had to learn it for herself 
what have you learned  dorothy 
i think that it   
    that it wasn t enough just to want
to see uncle henry and auntie em   
   and if i ever go looking
for my heart s desire again   
   i won t look any further
than my own back yard 
because if it isn t there   
   i never really lost it
to begin with 
 is that right 
 that s all it is 
thanks  joe 
go away  go away 
lt s me 
lt s been a while   
   and l just wanted to say hey 
you okay 
fabulous 
you re gonna be late 
gretta s waiting for you

good girl  katie cooper 
rosemary jones 
teresa mccullian 
ruby 
   lf l spread my fingers out 
my hand looked more human 
so l did that 
but it wasn t tiring holding my
fingers apart  so l let them relax   
   and then  l turned my hand over 
the back wasn t much better 
my veins bulged   
shut up  l m reading 
shut up 
   l can honestly say that my memory
has been transformed    
by freud s definition 
l ve achieved mental health 
and my discharge sheet
reads   recovered  
recovered   
don t do this 
  whatever it was      
   had l stopped arguing
with my personality 
recovered   
we were reading your book 
we re having a little read aloud   
   celebrate the wisdom you re
taking into the world 
try to learn something 
grow as people 
when you were a baby 
they strapped you to a board 
you think georgina doesn t
wanna leave   
   and l m criminally insane 
what are you guys doing here 
   lisa s eyes  once so magnetic 
now just look empty   
that is mine 
that is mine 
  georgina lies only to people
who keep her here 
sometimes l think she wants
to live in oz forever   
 how perceptive 
 you better erase that thing 
my father is the head of the cla 
and he could have you dead in minutes 
   ln this world  looks are everything 
sometimes l think polly s sweetness
and purity aren t genuine at all   
   but a desperate attempt to make it
easier for us to look at her   
so nice of you to pass judgment on us
now that you re cured 
what the fuck are you doing  lisa 
l m playing the villain 
like you want 
 l give you everything you want 
 no  you don t 
you wanted your file 
l got it 
you wanted out  l got you out 
you needed money  l found you some 
l told you the truth 
l didn t write it in a book 
l told you to your face 
l told daisy what everybody knew and
wouldn t say  and she killed herself 
l played the fucking villain 
just like you wanted 
why would l want that 
because it makes you
the good guy  sweet pea 
you come back here  all sweetness
and light and sad and contrite   
   and everybody wrings their hands 
congratulating you on your bravery 
meanwhile  l m blowing guys at the
bus station for money 
stop it  lisa  she s too  
shut up  polly 
where are you going 
l m talking to you 
where are you going 
l m talking to you 
you don t like me anymore 
no  l don t 
because you re free 
you think you re free 
l m free 
you don t know what freedom is 
l m free 
l can breathe  and you   
   you ll go choke on your
average fucking mediocre life 
there are too many buttons
in the world 
too many buttons 
and they re just    
there s way too many 
begging to be pressed 
they re just begging to be pressed 
you know  they re just
begging to be pressed 
and it makes me wonder 
lt makes me fucking wonder 
why doesn t anybody ever press mine 
why am l so neglected 
why doesn t anybody reach in
and rip out the truth   
   and tell me
that l m a fucking whore   
   and that my parents
wish l were dead 
because you re dead already  lisa 
no one cares if you die  lisa   
   because you re dead already 
your heart is cold 
that s why you keep
coming back here 
you re not free 
you need this place 
you need it to feel alive 
lt s pathetic 
l ve wasted a year of my life 
and maybe everyone
out there is a liar 
and maybe the whole world   
   is stupid and ignorant 
but l d rather be in it 
l d rather be fucking in it   
   than down here with you 
don t  don t 
don t 
oh  god 
did you get it 
l had to trade with a transvestite
in the men s ward 
thanks 
l m not really dead 
l know 
l m gonna miss you  susie q 
no  you re not 
you re gonna get out of here   
   and you re gonna come and see me 
hey  georgina 
you know all that stuff
l write in my journal   
   l don t know what l m saying 
they re just thoughts 
maybe l m the liar 
maybe not 
see you 
you think if l left ruby here
you d take care of her for me 
let me play with her
when l come for my therapy 
bye  ruby 
remember me when you shave your legs 
declared healthy   
   and sent back into the world 
my final diagnosis  
a recovered borderline 
what that means  i still don t know 
was i ever crazy 
 maybe 
or maybe life is 
l remember you 
where are you going 
1 7 burlingame 
all right 
crazy isn t being broken   
    or swallowing a dark secret 
it s you or me   
   amplified 
if you ever told a lie   
   and enjoyed it 
if you ever wished you
could be a child forever 
they were not perfect   
   but they were my friends 
and by the  70s   
   most of them were out   
    living lives 
some i ve seen
