the imminent arrival
of your bouncing
badass baby brother
start tight and then go wide
stamp date and time
mark 42 autonomous
prehensile propulsion suit test
initialise sequence
jarvis drop my needle
dashing through the snow
in a one horse open sleigh
oer the fields we go
laughing all the way
bells on bob tails ring

oh what fun it is to sing
a sleighing song tonight

little bit
cool it will you jarvis
come on i aint scared of you
im the best
as always sir a great pleasure
watching you work
i guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas
i didnt think it could get any worse
then i had to go and turn on the tv
thats when he happened
some people call me a terrorist
i consider myself a teacher
america
ready for another lesson
in 1864 in sand creek colorado
the us military waited
until the friendly cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting
waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land
39 hours ago
the ali ai salem air base in kuwait
was attacked
i i i did that
a quaint military church
filled with wives and children
of course
the soldiers were out on manoeuvres
the braves were away
president ems
you continue to resist my attempts
to educate you sir
and now youve missed me again
you know who i am
you dont know where i am
and youll never see me coming
now that we seem to be back
lets recap some
of the frightening developments
american airwaves were hijacked
the nation remains on high alert
all attempts to find the mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful
central to my administrations
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource
i know him
as colonel james rhodes
the american people
will soon know him
as the tron patriot
and how is president ems responding
by taking the guy
they call war machine
and giving him a paint job
the same suit
but painted red white and blue
look at that and they also
renamed him iron patriot
you know
just in case the paint was too subtle
it tested well with focus groups
all right
i am iron patriot it sucks
listen war machine
was a little too aggressive
all right
this sends a better message
so whats really going on
with the mandarin
seriously can we talk about this guy
its classified information tony
okay there have been nine bombings
nine
the public only knows about three
but heres the thing
nobody can id a device
theres no bomb casings
you know i can help
just ask
i got a ton of new tech
i got a prehensile suit
i got bomb disposal
it catches explosions in midair
whens the last time
you got a good nights sleep
einstein slept three hours a year
look what he did
people are concerned about you tony
im concerned about you
youre going to come at me like that
no look im not trying to be a dick
tator
do you mind signing my drawing
if richard doesnt mind
are you all right with this dick
yeah fine with me
whats your name
erin
i loved you in a christmas story
by the way
listen the pentagon is scared
after new york aliens come on
they need to look strong
stopping the mandarin is a priority
but its not
its not superhero business
no its not quite frankly
i get it
its american business
thats why i said i got it
are you okay
i broke the crayon
are you okay mr stark
take it easy tony
how did you
get out of the wormhole
wait a minute tony
what did you say
tony
sorry
im just checking on the suit
okay
check the heart
is it the brain
no sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity
okay so i was poisoned
my diagnosis is that youve
experienced a severe anxiety attack
me
come on man this isnt a good look
open up
sorry i gotta split
badge
badge
come on badge
badge guys
i put a memo in the toilet come on
tony has got them in his basement
theyre wearing party hats
this is an asset that we can put to use
uhhuh
so youre suggesting that i replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots
thank you
what im saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability
we should start
phasing it out immediately
what
excuse me bambi
you should be wearing
did you just say that
security yes
happy okay
i am thrilled that you are now
the head of security okay
it is the perfect position for you
thank you
however
i do appreciate it
since youve taken the post
you dont have to thank me
weve had a rise in
staff complaints of 300
thank you
its not a compliment
its not
it is a compliment
clearly somebodys
trying to hide something
i yes
excuse me
ms potts your 400 is here
thank you
did you clear this 4 00 with me
happy well talk about this later
but right now i have to go deal with
this very annoying thing
how so
i used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time
so its a little awkward
i dont like the sound of that
pepper
killian
you look great
you look really great
god you look great
what on earth have you been doing
nothing fancy
just five years in the hands
of physical therapists
and please call me aldrich
uh you were supposed to be
issued a security badge
happy its okay were good
yes
are you sure okay
yes stand down
im going to linger right here okay
thank you
its very nice to see you killian
hey guy
merry christmas
after years dodging
the presidents ban
on immoral biotech research
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline
its an idea we like to call extremis
im gonna turn your lights down
regard the human brain
uh wait hold on hold on
thats
thats the universe my bad
but if i do that
thats the brain
strangely mimetic though
wouldnt you say
wow thats amazing
thanks its mine
what
this youre inside my head
its a
its a live feed
come on up ill prove it to you
come on
now pinch my arm
i can take it pinch me
what is that
its the primary somatosensory cortex
its the brains pain centre
but this is what i wanted to show you
now extremis harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here
this is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind
our entire dna in fact
is destined to be upgraded
wow
oh wait
uh
hello
is this forehead of security
what
you know look
i got a real job what do you want
im working
ive got something going on here
what harassing interns
let me tell you something
do you know what happened
when i told people
i was iron mans bodyguard
they would laugh in my face
i had to leave
while i still had a shred of dignity
now i got a real job
im watching pepper
whats going on fill me in
for real
yeah
all right so shes meeting
up with this scientist
rich guy handsome
right
i couldnt make his face at first right
you know im good with faces
oh yeah youre the best
yeah
well so i run his credentials
i make him
aldrich killian
we actually met the guy back in
where were we in 99
the science conference
um
switzerland
right right exactly
killian no
i dont remember that guy
of course you dont remember
hes not a blond with a big rack
at first it was fine
they were tanking business
but now its like getting weird
hes showing her his big brain
his what
big brain
and she likes it
here let me show you
hold on see
look at what you watching them
flip the screen
and then we can get started
im not a tech genius like you
just trust me get down here
flip the screen
then i can see what theyre doing
i cant
i dont know how to flip the screen
dont talk to me like that any more
youre not my boss
all right
i dont work for you
and i dont trust this guy
hes got another guy with him
hes shifty
relax
seriously
im just asking you
to secure the perimeter
tell them to go out
for a drink or something
you know what you should take more
of an interest in whats going on here
this womans the best thing
that ever happened to you
and youre just ignoring her
a giant brain
yeah
theres a giant brain
theres a shifty character
im gonna follow this guy im gonna
run his plates and im gonna
you know
if it gets rough so be it
i miss you happy
yeah i miss you too
but the way it used to be
now youre off with the superfriends
i dont know
whats going on with you any more
the worlds getting weird
hey
i hate to cut you off
do you have your taser on you
why
i think theres a gal in hr
whos trying to steal some printer ink
you should probably go over there
and zap her
yeah nice
imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its dna
that would be incredible
hmm
unfortunately to my ears
it also sounds highly weaponisable
as in enhanced soldiers
private armies and tony is
tony tony
you know i invited tony to join aim
13 years ago
he turned me down
but something tells me
now theres a new genius on the throne
who doesnt have to
answer to tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego
its gonna be a no aldrich
as much as id like to help you
well i cant say that
im not disappointed
but then
as my father used to say
failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph
thats very deep
hmm
and i have no idea what it means
no me neither
he was kind of an idiot my old man

take away everywhere
that theres been a mandarin attack

it predates any known mandarin attack
the incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide

that you had to speak to tony
i think that my boss
is working for the mandarin
so if you still want to talk about it
i suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe
your boss works for the mandarin
you think
but tony says youre a botanist so
that figures what i actually am
is a biological dna coder
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank
but sure you can call me a botanist
this boss of yours
does he have a name
yeah aldrich killian
well we took the house down
sir but theres no sign of a body

i dunno later
hey kid give me a little space

what happened
i guess this guy named
chad davis used to live roundabouts
he won a bunch of medals in the army
and one day folks said he went crazy
and made you know a bomb
then he blew himself up right here
six people died right
yeah
including chad davis
yeah yeah
yeah that doesnt make sense
think about it
six dead only five shadows
yeah
people said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven
except the bomb guy
he went to hell
on account of he didnt get a shadow
thats why theres only five
do you buy that
its what everyone says
you know what
this crater reminds me of

i decided not to let my injury beat me
will you please state
your name for the camera
ellen brandt
okay so the injections
are administered periodically
addiction will not be tolerated
and those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the programme
once misfits cripples
you are the next iteration
of human evolution
everybody before we start
i promise you looking back at your
life there will be nothing as bitter
as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego
today is your glory
lets begin
we gotta get out of here
we gotta get out of here
get her out
get them out of here
a bomb is not a bomb
when its a misfire
the stuff doesnt always work
right pal
its faulty
but you found a buyer didnt you
sold it to the mandarin
got you pal
what happened
fun fact
before he built rockets for the nazis
the idealistic wernher von braun
dreamed of space travel
he stargazed
do you know what he said when
the first v2 hit london
the rocket performed perfectly
it just landed on the wrong planet
see we all begin wideeyed
pure science
and then the ego steps in
the obsession
and you look up
youre a long way from shore
you cant be too hard on yourself
maya
i mean you gave your research
to a think tank
yeah but killian built that think tank
on military contracts
thats exactly what we used to do
so dont judge yourself
thank you pepper
i really appreciate that
hi good evening come on in
good evening
maya run
hi pepper
so you want to tell me why you
were at starks mansion last night
im trying to fix this thing
i didnt know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up
oh i see so you were trying
to save stark when he threatened us
ive told you killian we can use him
pepper pepper pepper
look if we want to launch product
next year i need stark
he just lacked a decent incentive
now he has one
this is support team bluezero
sending coordinates for a suspected
mandarin broadcast point of origin
copy
nobody move
oh support bluezero
unless the mandarins next attack
on the us
involves cheaplymade sportswear
i think you messed up again
yes youre free uh
if you werent before
its of course
yes maam
iron patriot on the job
happy to help
no need to thank me maam
its my pleasure
savin
ive acquired the patriot armour
if you want this suit
youre going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it
thats the plan colonel
harley tell me whats happening
give me a full report
yeah im still eating that candy
do you want me to keep eating it
how much have you had
two or three bowls
can you still see straight
sort of
that means youre fine
give me jarvis
jarvis how are we
its totally fine sir
i seem to do quite well for a stretch
and then at the end of the sentence
i say the wrong cranberry
and sir you were right
once i factored in
available aim downink facilities
i was able to pinpoint
the mandarins broadcast signal
what are we talking
far east europe north africa
iran pakistan syria
where is it
actually sir its in miami
okay kid im gonna have
to walk you through
rebooting jarviss speech drive
but not right now
harley where is he really
just look on the screen
and tell me where it is
um it does say miami florida
okay first things first i need
the armour where are we at with it
uh its not charging
actually sir it is charging
but the power source is questionable
it may not succeed
in revitalising the mark 42
whats questionable about electricity
all right
its my suit and i cant im not gonna
i dont wanna
oh god not again
tony
are you having another attack
i didnt even mention new york
right and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it

youre a mechanic right
right
you said so
yes i did
why dont you just build something
okay

theyre made by americans
based on a japanese recipe

although the guns are all fake
because those wankers
wouldnt trust me with the real ones
what
hey do you fancy either of the birds
heard enough
youre not him
the mandarin the real guy
where
wheres the mandarin
where is he
whoa whoa whoa
hes here hes here but hes not here
hes here but hes not here
what do you mean
its complicated
hey its complicated
it is
its complicated
uncomplicate it
ladies out
get out of the bed
get into the bathroom
sit
ew
oh jesus
my name is trevor
trevor slattery
what are you
what are you a decoy
youre a double right
what you mean like an understudy
no absolutely not
dont hurt the face
im an actor
you got a minute to live
fill it with words
its just a role
the mandarin see its not real
then how did you get here trevor
well i um had a little
problem with um substances
and i ended up doing things
no two ways about it
in the street
that a man shouldnt do
next
then
they approached me
about the role
and they knew about the drugs
what did they say
theyd get you off them
they said theyd give me more
they gave me things
they gave me this palace
they gave me plastic surgery
they gave me things
did you just nod off
hey
no and a lovely speedboat
and the thing was he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions
he
killian
killian
he created you
he created me
custommade terror threat
yes yes
his think tank thinked it up
the pathology of a serial killer
the manipulation
of western iconography
ready for another lesson
blah blah blah
no
of course it was my performance
that brought the mandarin to life
your performance
where people died
no they didnt
look around you
the costumes green screen
honestly i wasnt on
location for half this stuff
and when i was
it was movie magic love
im sorry but i got a best friend
whos in a coma
and he might not wake up
so youre gonna have
to answer for that
youre still going down pal
you under
okay trevor what did you tell him
i didnt tell him anything
nothing
no
you should have pressed
the panic button
well i panicked but then i handled it
ah
okay
its just like old times huh
oh yeah with zip ties
its a ball
it wasnt my idea
okay so you took killians card
i took his money
and here you are 13 years later
in a dungeon
no
yeah
no youre in a dungeon
im free to go
yeah
a lot has happened tony
but im close
extremis is practically stabilised
im telling you it isnt
im on the street
people are going bang
theyre painting the walls
maya youre kidding yourself
then help me fix it
did i do that
yes
i remember the night not the morning
is this what
youve been chasing around
you dont remember
i cant help you
you used to have a moral psychology
you used to have ideals
you wanted to help people
now look at you
i get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul
get me out of here
come on
you know what my old man
used to say to me
one of his favourite of many sayings
the early bird gets the worm but
the second mouse gets the cheese
youre not still pissed off
about the switzerland thing are you
how can i be pissed at you tony
im here to thank you
you gave me the greatest gift
that anybodys ever given me
desperation
if you think back to switzerland
you said youd meet me
on the rooftop right
well for the first 20 minutes
i actually thought youd show up
and the next hour
i considered taking that
onestep shortcut to the lobby
if you know what i mean
honestly im still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse
but as i looked out over that city
nobody knew i was there
nobody could see me
no one was even looking
i had a thought that would
guide me for years to come
anonymity tony
thanks to you
its been my mantra ever since
right
you simply rule
from behind the scenes
because the second
you give evil a face
a bin laden a gaddafi a mandarin
you hand the people a target
youre something else
you have met him i assume
yes sir laurence oblivier
i know hes a little
over the top sometimes
its not entirely my fault
he has a tenden
hes a stage actor
they say his lear was
the toast of croydon wherever that is
anyway the point is
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky
subtlety has kind of had its day
whats next for you in your world
well i wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me
desperation
now this is live
im not sure if you can tell
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept extremis
or just give up
and if it gives up
i have to say
the detonation is quite spectacular
but until that point
its really just a lot of pain
we havent even talked salary yet
what kind of perk package
are you thinking of
let him go
hold on hold on
maya
i said let him go
what are you doing
1200 ccs
a dose half of this size im dead
its times like this my temper
is tested somewhat
maya give me the injector
if i die killian
what happens to your soldiers
what happens to your product
were not doing this okay
what happens to you
what happens if you go too hot
the good news is
a highlevel position
has just been vacated
you are a maniac
no im a visionary
but i do own a maniac
and he takes the stage tonight
once we get the patriot installed
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown
well thats great
but the last time i looked
there was somebody inside of it
afternoon gentlemen
hello colonel
step aside
oh
well get you out of there
dont worry
youll damage the armour
yes i will
but you can fix it right

the clean slate protocol sir
screw it its christmas
yes yes
okay so far

as christmas morning began
my journey had reached its end
you start with something pure
something exciting
then come the mistakes
the compromises
we create our own demons
oh
great to see you oh bloody hell
as promised i got pepper
sorted out it took some tinkering
but then i thought to myself
why stop there
of course there are people who
say progress is dangerous
but ill bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel
and now neither will i
let me tell you
that was the best sleep
id had in years
its okay its okay
its okay
no look
so if i were to wrap this up
tie it with a bow or whatever
i guess id say my armour
it was never a distraction
or a hobby
it was a cocoon
and now
im a changed man
you can take away my house
all my tricks and toys
one thing you cant take away
i am iron man
you know and thank you
by the way for listening
plus something about just
getting it off my chest
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in
i mean this is what gets people sick
you know
wow i had no idea
you were such a good listener
to be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone
it just cuts the weight of it in half
you know its like a snake
swallowing its own tail
everything comes full circle
and the fact that youve been able to
help me process
are you with me
sorry i was yeah
we were at uh
are you actively napping
i was i i drifted
where did i lose you
elevator in switzerland
so you heard none of it
im sorry im not that kind of doctor
im not a therapist
its not my training
so
i dont have the
what the time
temperament
you know what
now that i think about it
