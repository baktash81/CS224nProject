what does that even mean 
doesn t matter 
i said it because he said it 
so  now  he was famous
and it s basically getting said
by two well known guys 
i don t  uh   
i m going to start again 
let s track this from the beginning 
  yo listen up here s a story
  about a little guy that
lives in a blue world
  and all day and all night
and everything he sees
  is just blue like him
inside and outside
  blue is his house
with a blue little window
  and a blue corvette
  and everything is blue
for him and himself
  and everybody around
   cause he ain t got nobody     
half hour till the ball drops 
  hey  do you wanna   
  tony stark 
  great speech  man 
  i got you  pal 
i gave a speech  how was it 
  edifying 
  unintelligible 
  really 
  mmm hmm 
it s my favourite kind 
a winning combo 
  where are we going 
  uh  to town  on each other 
probably back in your room
because i also want to
see your research 
okay  you can see my research 
but that s   
i m not gonna show you my  town  
mr stark 
ho yinsen

your research since year two of mit 
yeah  we re full 
oh  wow  he made it 
he made the cut 
what floor you going to  pal 
well  now  that is
an appropriate question 
the ground floor  actually 
of a proposal
i m putting together myself 
it s a privately funded think tank
called advanced idea mechanics

i thought that was just a theory 
well  it was 
if i m right  we can access the area
of the brain
  that governs repair   
  wow 
   and chemically recode it 
that s incredible  essentially 
you re hacking into the genetic   
   operating system   
     of a living organism 
  exactly 
  yes 
  wow 
is that   
can you

micro repeater
implanting sequence complete 
as you wish  sir

for you to entirely ignore 
which i will 
all right  let s do this 
hi  dum e 
how did you get that cap on your head 
you earned it 
hey  hey 
what are you doing out of the corner 
you know what you did 
blood on my mat  handle it 
sir  may i remind you that you ve been
awake for nearly 72 hours 
focus up  ladies 
good evening 
and welcome to the birthing suite 
i am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival
of your bouncing 
bad ass baby brother 
start tight and then go wide

jarvis  drop my needle 
  dashing through the snow
  in a one horse open sleigh
  o er the fields we go
  laughing all the way
  bells on bob tails ring
crap 
  oh  what fun it is to sing
  a sleighing song tonight
  jingle bells  jingle bells
  jingle all the way
  oh  what fun it is to ride
  in a one horse open sleigh  
all right  i think we got this 
send them all 
probably a little fast 
slow it down 
  slow it down just a   
   little bit 
cool it  will you  jarvis 
come on  i ain t scared of you 
i m the best 
as always  sir  a great pleasure
watching you work 
i guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas 
i didn t think it could get any worse 
then i had to go and turn on the tv 
that s when he happened 
some people call me a terrorist 
i consider myself a teacher 
america 
ready for another lesson 
in 1864  in sand creek  colorado 
the us military waited
until the friendly cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting 
waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land 
39 hours ago 
the ali ai salem air base in kuwait
was attacked 
i    i    i did that 
a quaint military church
filled with wives and children 
of course 
the soldiers were out on manoeuvres 
the braves were away 
president ems 
you continue to resist my attempts
to educate you  sir 
and now you ve missed me again 
you know who i am 
you don t know where i am 
and you ll never see me coming 
now that we seem to be back 
let s recap some
of the frightening developments   
american airwaves were hijacked   
the nation remains on high alert 
all attempts to find the mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful 
central to my administration s
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource 
i know him
as colonel james rhodes 
the american people
will soon know him
as the tron patriot 
and how is president ems responding 
by taking the guy
they call war machine
and giving him a paint job 
the same suit 
but painted red  white and blue 
look at that  and they also
renamed him   iron patriot  
you know 
just in case the paint was too subtle 
it tested well with focus groups 
all right 
 i am iron patriot   it sucks 
listen   war machine 
was a little too aggressive 
all right 
this sends a better message 
so  what s really going on 
with the mandarin 
seriously  can we talk about this guy 
it s classified information  tony 
okay  there have been nine bombings 
  nine 
  the public only knows about three 
but here s the thing 
nobody can id a device 
there s no bomb casings 
you know i can help 
just ask 
i got a ton of new tech 
i got a prehensile suit 
i got bomb disposal 
it catches explosions in mid air 
when s the last time
you got a good night s sleep 
einstein slept three hours a year 
look what he did 
people are concerned about you  tony 
i m concerned about you 
you re going to come at me like that 
no  look  i m not trying to be a dick   
   tator 
do you mind signing my drawing 
  if richard doesn t mind 
are you all right with this  dick 
yeah  fine with me 
  what s your name 
  erin 
i loved you in a christmas story 
by the way 
listen  the pentagon is scared 
after new york  aliens    come on 
they need to look strong 
stopping the mandarin is a priority 
but it s not   
  it s not superhero business 
  no  it s not  quite frankly 
  i get it 
  it s american business 
that s why i said i got it 
  are you okay 
i broke the crayon 
are you okay  mr stark 
take it easy  tony 
how did you
get out of the wormhole 
  wait a minute  tony 
  what did you say 
  tony 
sorry 
i m just checking on the suit 
okay 
check the heart 
is it the brain 
no sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity 
okay  so i was poisoned 
my diagnosis is that you ve
experienced a severe anxiety attack 
  me 
come on  man  this isn t a good look 
open up 
sorry  i gotta split 
badge 
  badge 
come on  badge 
badge  guys 
i put a memo in the toilet  come on 
tony has got them in his basement 
they re wearing party hats 
  this is an asset that we can put to use 
  uh huh 
so  you re suggesting that i replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots 
  thank you 
  what i m saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability 
we should start
phasing it out immediately 
  what 
  excuse me  bambi 
  you should be wearing   
  did you just say that 
  security  yes 
  happy  okay 
i am thrilled that you are now
the head of security  okay 
  it is the perfect position for you 
  thank you 
  however   
  i do appreciate it 
     since you ve taken the post   
  you don t have to thank me 
   we ve had a rise in
staff complaints of 300  
thank you 
it s not a compliment 
it s not   
it is a compliment 
clearly  somebody s
trying to hide something 
  i    yes 
  excuse me 
ms potts  your 4 00 is here 
  thank you 
did you clear this 4   00 with me 
happy  we ll talk about this later 
but right now  i have to go deal with
this very annoying thing 
how so 
i used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time 
so it s a little awkward 
i don t like the sound of that 
pepper 
killian 
you look great 
you look really great 
god  you look great 
what on earth have you been doing 
nothing fancy 
just five years in the hands
of physical therapists 
and please  call me aldrich 
uh  you were supposed to be
issued a security badge 
  happy  it s okay  we re good 
  yes 
  are you sure  okay 
  yes  stand down 
  i m going to linger right here  okay 
  thank you 
it s very nice to see you  killian 
hey  guy 
merry christmas 
after years dodging
the president s ban
on  immoral  biotech research 
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline 
it s an idea we like to call extremis 
i m gonna turn your lights down 
regard the human brain 
uh    wait  hold on  hold on 
that s   
that s the universe  my bad 
but if i do that   
that s the brain 
strangely mimetic  though 
wouldn t you say 
wow  that s amazing 
thanks  it s mine 
what 
this  you re inside my head 
it s a   
it s a live feed 
come on up  i ll prove it to you 
come on 
now  pinch my arm 
  i can take it  pinch me 
what is that 
it s the primary somatosensory cortex 
it s the brain s pain centre 
but this is what i wanted to show you 
now  extremis harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here 
this is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind 
our entire dna  in fact 
is destined to be upgraded 
wow 
oh  wait   
  uh   
  hello 
  is this forehead of security 
  what 
you know  look   
i got a real job  what do you want 
i m working 
i ve got something going on  here 
what  harassing interns 
let me tell you something 
do you know what happened
when i told people
i was iron man s bodyguard 
  they would laugh in my face 
i had to leave
while i still had a shred of dignity 
now i got a real job 
i m watching pepper 
what s going on  fill me in 
  for real 
  yeah 
all right  so  she s meeting
up with this scientist 
  rich guy  handsome 
  right 
i couldn t make his face  at first  right 
you know i m good with faces 
  oh  yeah  you re the best 
  yeah 
well  so i run his credentials 
i make him 
aldrich killian 
we actually met the guy back in   
where were we in  99 
  the science conference 
  um   
  switzerland 
  right  right  exactly 
killian  no   
i don t remember that guy 
of course you don t remember 
he s not a blond with a big rack 
at first  it was fine 
they were tanking business 
but now it s  like  getting weird 
he s showing her his big brain 
  his what 
  big brain 
and she likes it 
here  let me show you 
hold on  see 
look at what  you  watching them 
flip the screen 
and then we can get started 
i m not a tech genius like you 
just trust me  get down here 
flip the screen 
then i can see what they re doing 
i can t 
i don t know how to flip the screen 
don t talk to me like that any more 
you re not my boss 
all right 
i don t work for you 
and i don t trust this guy 
he s got another guy with him 
he s shifty 
  relax 
  seriously 
i m just asking you
to secure the perimeter 
tell them to go out
for a drink or something 
you know what  you should take more
of an interest in what s going on here 
this woman s the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you re just ignoring her 
  a giant brain 
  yeah 
there s a giant brain 
there s a shifty character 
i m gonna follow this guy  i m gonna
run his plates and i m gonna   
you know 
if it gets rough  so be it 
i miss you  happy 
yeah  i miss you  too 
but the way it used to be 
now you re off with the super friends 
i don t know
what s going on with you any more 
  the world s getting weird 
  hey 
i hate to cut you off 
  do you have your taser on you 
  why 
i think there s a gal in h r 
who s trying to steal some printer ink 
you should probably go over there
and zap her 
yeah  nice 
imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its dna 
  that would be incredible 
  hmm 
unfortunately  to my ears 
it also sounds highly weaponisable 
as in  enhanced soldiers 
private armies  and tony is   
tony  tony 
you know  i invited tony to join aim
13 years ago 
he turned me down 
but something tells me
now there s a new genius on the throne
who doesn t have to
answer to tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego 
it s gonna be a no  aldrich 
as much as i d like to help you 
well  i can t say that
i m not disappointed 
but then 
as my father used to say 
 failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph  
  that s very deep 
  hmm 
and i have no idea what it means 
no  me neither 
he was kind of an idiot  my old man 
i m sure i ll see you again  pepper 
happy 
car s ready  if you re ready to go 
yes  i just  um   
god  i forgot my other things  so   
i m just gonna   
i m sorry i m late  i was   
what the   
what is that 
you re wearing this in the house now 
what is that  like  mark 15 
uh  yeah 
something like that 
you know  everybody needs a hobby 
oh  and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room 
just breaking it in 
you know  it s always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag
  at first  so   
well  hey  did you see
your christmas present 
yes  i did  i   
i don t know how i could ve
missed that christmas present

here s a little holiday greeting
i ve been wanting to send
to the mandarin 
i just didn t know
how to phrase it until now 
my name is tony stark
and i m not afraid of you 
i know you re a coward 
so i ve decided
that you just died  pal 
i m gonna come get the body 
there s no politics here 
it s just good old fashioned revenge 
there s no pentagon 
it s just you and me 
and on the off chance you re a man

s h i e l d   fbi and cia intercepts 
initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction 
okay  what have we got here 
the name is an ancient chinese war
mantle meaning  advisor to the king  
south american insurgency tactics 
talks like a baptist preacher 
there s lots of pageantry going on here 
lots of theatre  close 
the heat from the blast was in excess
of 3  000 degrees celsius 
any subjects within 12 5 yards
were vaporised instantly 
no bomb parts found in a three mile
radius of the chinese theatre 
no  sir 
talk to me  happy 
when is a bomb not a bomb 
any military victims 
not according to public record  sir 
bring up the thermogenic
signatures again 
factor in 3 000 degrees 
the oracle cloud
has completed analysis 
accessing satellites
and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now 
take away everywhere
that there s been a mandarin attack 
nope 
that  are you sure
that s not one of his 
it predates any known mandarin attack 
the incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide 
bring her around 
the heat signature
is remarkably similar 
3 000 degree celsius 
that s two military guys 
ever been to tennessee  jarvis 
creating a flight plan for tennessee 
are we still at ding dong 
  we re supposed to be on total   
   security lockdown

why were you
at the house tonight 
what was so important
that you had to speak to tony 
i think that my boss
is working for the mandarin 
so  if you still want to talk about it
i suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe 
your boss works for the mandarin 
you think 
but tony says you re a botanist  so   
that figures  what i actually am
is a biological dna coder
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank 
but sure  you can call me a botanist 
this boss of yours 
does he have a name 
yeah  aldrich killian 
well  we took the house down 
sir  but there s no sign of a body 
  mmm hmm  i see

when can we talk about new york 
maybe never 
relax about it 
what about the avengers 
can we talk about them 
i dunno  later 
hey  kid  give me a little space 
what s the official story here 
what happened 
i guess this guy named
chad davis used to live roundabouts 
he won a bunch of medals in the army 
and one day  folks said he went crazy
and made  you know  a bomb 
then he blew himself up  right here 
  six people died  right 
  yeah 
  including chad davis 
  yeah  yeah 
yeah  that doesn t make sense 
think about it 
six dead  only five shadows 
yeah 
people said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven 
except the bomb guy 
he went to hell 
on account of he didn t get a shadow 
that s why there s only five 
  do you buy that 
  it s what everyone says 
you know what
this crater reminds me of 
no idea  i m not   
i don t care 
that giant wormhole in 
um  in new york 
does it remind you 
that s manipulative 
i don t want to talk about it 
are they coming back  the aliens 
maybe  can you stop 
remember what i told you 
that i have an anxiety issue 
does this subject make you edgy

my breath for a second

well  uh  i think that would be the day
i decided not to let my injury beat me 
will you please state
your name for the camera 
ellen brandt 
okay  so  the injections
are administered periodically 
addiction will not be tolerated 
and those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the programme 
once misfits  cripples   
you are the next iteration
of human evolution 
everybody  before we start   
i promise you  looking back at your
life  there will be nothing as bitter
as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego 
today is your glory 
let s begin 
we gotta get out of here 
we gotta get out of here 
get her out 
get them out of here 
a bomb is not a bomb
when it s a misfire 
the stuff doesn t always work 
right  pal 
it s faulty 
but you found a buyer  didn t you 
sold it to the mandarin 
got you  pal 
what happened 
fun fact 
before he built rockets for the nazis 
the idealistic wernher von braun
dreamed of space travel 
he stargazed 
do you know what he said when
the first v 2 hit london 
 the rocket performed perfectly  
 it just landed on the wrong planet  
see  we all begin wide eyed 
pure science 
and then the ego steps in 
the obsession 
and you look up 
you re a long way from shore 
you can t be too hard on yourself 
maya 
i mean  you gave your research
to a think tank 
yeah  but killian built that think tank
on military contracts 
that s exactly what we used to do 
so  don t judge yourself 
thank you  pepper 
i really appreciate that 
  hi  good evening  come on in 
  good evening 
maya  run 
hi  pepper 
so  you want to tell me why you
were at stark s mansion last night 
i m trying to fix this thing 
i didn t know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up 
oh  i see  so  you were trying
to save stark when he threatened us 
i ve told you  killian  we can use him 
pepper  pepper  pepper 
look  if we want to launch product
next year  i need stark 
he just lacked a decent incentive 
now  he has one 
this is support team blue zero 
sending coordinates for a suspected
mandarin broadcast point of origin 
copy 
nobody move 
oh  support blue zero 
unless the mandarin s next attack
on the u s 
involves cheaply made sportswear 
i think you messed up again 
yes  you re free  uh 
if you weren t before 
it s    of course 
yes  ma am 
iron patriot on the job 
happy to help 
no need to thank me  ma am 
it s my pleasure 
savin 
i ve acquired the patriot armour 
if you want this suit 
you re going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it 
that s the plan  colonel 
harley  tell me what s happening 
give me a full report 
yeah  i m still eating that candy 
do you want me to keep eating it 
  how much have you had 
  two or three bowls 
  can you still see straight 
  sort of 
that means you re fine 
give me jarvis 
jarvis  how are we 
it s totally fine  sir 
i seem to do quite well for a stretch 
and then at the end of the sentence
i say the wrong cranberry 
and  sir  you were right 
once i factored in
available aim down ink facilities
i was able to pinpoint
the mandarin s broadcast signal 
what are we talking 
far east  europe  north africa 
iran  pakistan  syria 
where is it 
actually  sir  it s in miami 
okay  kid  i m gonna have
to walk you through
rebooting jarvis s speech drive 
but not right now 
harley  where is he really 
just look on the screen
and tell me where it is 
um  it does say miami  florida 
okay  first things first  i need
the armour  where are we at with it 
uh  it s not charging 
actually  sir  it is charging 
but the power source is questionable 
it may not succeed
in revitalising the mark 42 
what s questionable about electricity 
all right 
  it s my suit  and i can t    i m not gonna   
  i don t wanna   
oh  god  not again 
  tony 
are you having another attack 
i didn t even mention new york 
right  and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it 
okay  um  uh   
god  what am i gonna do 
just breathe 
really  just breathe 
you re a mechanic  right

  ah 
nessie

there s some guy over here 
they re made by americans 
based on a japanese recipe 
hey 
bloody hell  bloody hell 
don t move 
i m not moving 
you want something  take it 
although the guns are all fake
because those wankers
wouldn t trust me with the real ones 
  what 
  hey  do you fancy either of the birds 
heard enough 
you re not him 
the mandarin  the real guy 
where 
where s the mandarin 
where is he 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
he s here  he s here  but he s not here 
  he s here  but he s not here 
  what do you mean 
it s complicated 
hey  it s complicated 
  it is 
  it s complicated 
uncomplicate it 
ladies  out 
get out of the bed 
get into the bathroom 
sit 
  ew 
  oh  jesus 
my name is trevor 
trevor slattery 
what are you 
what are you  a decoy 
you re a double  right 
what  you mean like an understudy 
no  absolutely not 
don t hurt the face 
i m an actor 
you got a minute to live 
fill it with words 
it s just a role 
 the mandarin   see  it s not real 
then how did you get here  trevor 
well  i  um  had a little
problem with  um  substances 
and i ended up doing things 
no two ways about it 
in the street 
that a man shouldn t do 
  next 
  then 
they approached me
about the role 
and they knew about the drugs 
what did they say 
they d get you off them 
they said they d give me more 
they gave me things 
they gave me this palace 
they gave me plastic surgery 
they gave me things 
did you just nod off 
hey 
no  and a lovely speedboat 
and the thing was  he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions 
 he  
  killian 
  killian 
  he created you 
  he created me 
custom made terror threat 
yes  yes 
his think tank thinked it up 
the pathology of a serial killer 
the manipulation
of western iconography 
ready for another lesson 
blah  blah  blah 
no 
of course  it was my performance
that brought the mandarin to life 
your performance 
where people died 
no  they didn t 
look around you 
the costumes  green screen 
honestly  i wasn t on
location for half this stuff 
and when i was 
it was movie magic  love 
i m sorry  but i got a best friend
who s in a coma
and he might not wake up 
so you re gonna have
to answer for that 
you re still going down  pal 
you under   
okay  trevor  what did you tell him 
  i didn t tell him anything 
  nothing 
no 
you should have pressed
the panic button 
well  i panicked  but then i handled it 
ah   
okay 
it s just like old times  huh 
oh  yeah  with zip ties 
it s a ball 
it wasn t my idea 
okay  so you took killian s card 
i took his money 
and here you are 13 years later 
in a dungeon 
  no 
  yeah 
no  you re in a dungeon 
i m free to go 
yeah 
a lot has happened  tony 
but i m close 
extremis is practically stabilised 
i m telling you it isn t 
i m on the street 
people are going bang 
they re painting the walls 
maya  you re kidding yourself 
then help me fix it 
did i do that 
yes 
i remember the night  not the morning 
is this what
you ve been chasing around 
  you don t remember 
  i can t help you 
you used to have a moral psychology 
you used to have ideals 
you wanted to help people 
now look at you 
i get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul 
get me out of here 
come on 
you know what my old man
used to say to me 
one of his favourite of many sayings   
 the early bird gets the worm  but
the second mouse gets the cheese  
you re not still pissed off
about the switzerland thing  are you 
how can i be pissed at you  tony 
i m here to thank you 
you gave me the greatest gift
that anybody s ever given me 
desperation 
if you think back to switzerland 
you said you d meet me
on the rooftop  right 
well  for the first 20 minutes 
i actually thought you d show up 
and the next hour   
i considered taking that
one step shortcut to the lobby 
if you know what i mean 
honestly  i m still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse 
but as i looked out over that city 
nobody knew i was there 
nobody could see me 
no one was even looking 
i had a thought that would
guide me for years to come 
anonymity  tony 
thanks to you 
it s been my mantra ever since 
right 
you simply rule
from behind the scenes 
because the second
you give evil a face 
a bin laden  a gaddafi  a mandarin 
you hand the people a target 
you re something else 
you have met him  i assume 
yes  sir laurence oblivier 
i know he s a little
over the top sometimes 
it s not entirely my fault 
he has a tenden   
he s a stage actor 
they say his lear was
the toast of croydon  wherever that is 
anyway  the point is 
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky 
subtlety has kind of had its day 
what s next for you in your world 
well  i wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me 
desperation 
now  this is live 
i m not sure if you can tell 
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept extremis
or just give up 
and if it gives up 
i have to say 
the detonation is quite spectacular 
but until that point 
it s really just a lot of pain 
we haven t even talked salary yet 
what kind of perk package
are you thinking of 
let him go 
hold on  hold on 
maya   
i said  let him go 
what are you doing 
1200 ccs 
a dose half of this size  i m dead 
it s times like this my temper
is tested somewhat 
maya  give me the injector 
if i die  killian 
what happens to your soldiers 
what happens to your product 
we re not doing this  okay 
what happens to you 
what happens if you go too hot 
the good news is 
a high level position
has just been vacated

you ve got to let go 
i ll catch you  i promise 
  no 
a shame  i would ve caught her 
eject 
well  here we are on the roof 
mark 42  inbound 
i ll be damned 
the prodigal son returns 
whatever 
you really didn t deserve her  tony 
it s a pity 
i was so close to having her perfect 
okay  okay  wait  wait  wait 
slow down  slow down 
you re right  i don t deserve her 
here s where you re wrong 
she was already perfect 
jarvis 
do me a favour and blow mark 42 
no   
no more false faces 
you said you wanted the mandarin 
you re looking right at him 
it was always me  tony 
right from the start 
i am the mandarin 
i got nothing 
jarvis  subject at my 12 o clock
is not a target  disengage 
what 
oh  what  are you mad at me 
whoo 
honey 
oh  my god 
that was really violent 
you just scared the devil out of me 
i thought you were   
i was dead 
why  because i fell 200 feet 
who s the hot mess now 
it s still debatable 
probably tipping your way a little bit 
why don t you dress
like this at home  hmm 
sport bra  the whole deal 
you know  i think i understand
why you don t want to give up the suits 
what am i going to complain
about now 
well  it s me 
you ll think of something 
  no  don t touch me 
  don t worry about it 
  no  i m gonna burn you 
  no  you re not 
not hot 
am i gonna be okay 
no 
you re in a relationship with me 
everything will never be okay 
but i think i can figure this out  yeah 
i almost had this 20 years ago
when i was drunk 
i think i can get you better 
that s what i do  i fix stuff 
and all your distractions 
uh    i m going to shave them down
a little bit 
jarvis  hey 
all wrapped up here  sir 
will there be anything else 
you know what to do 
the clean slate protocol  sir 
screw it  it s christmas 
yes  yes 
okay  so far 
do you like it 
it ll do 
and so 
as christmas morning began 
my journey had reached its end 
you start with something pure 
something exciting 
then  come the mistakes 
the compromises 
  we create our own demons 
  oh 
great to see you  oh  bloody hell 
as promised  i got pepper
sorted out  it took some tinkering 
but then i thought to myself 
 why stop there  
of course  there are people who
say progress is dangerous 
but i ll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel 
and now  neither will i 
  let me tell you   
   that was the best sleep
i d had in years 
it s okay  it s okay 
it s okay 
no  look 
so  if i were to wrap this up 
tie it with a bow  or whatever   
i guess i d say my armour 
it was never a distraction 
or a hobby 
it was a cocoon 
and now 
i m a changed man 
you can take away my house 
all my tricks and toys 
one thing you can t take away   
i am iron man 
you know  and thank you
by the way  for listening 
plus  something about just
getting it off my chest 
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere  instead of holding this in   
i mean  this is what gets people sick 
you know 
wow  i had no idea
you were such a good listener 
to be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone 
it just cuts the weight of it in half 
you know  it s like a snake
swallowing its own tail 
everything comes full circle 
  and the fact that you ve been able to
  help me process   
  are you with me 
  sorry    i was  yeah 
we were at  uh   
are you actively napping 
i was    i    i drifted 
where did i lose you 
elevator in switzerland 
so  you heard none of it 
i m sorry  i m not that kind of doctor 
i m not a therapist 
  it s not my training 
  so 
  i don t have the   
  what  the time 
temperament 
you know what 
now that i think about it
