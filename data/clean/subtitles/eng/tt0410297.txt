 dostoyevsky

my folks are coming into town 
nothing 
when your father passed away

knowing that he was once
on the same pages   
   reading the same words 
oh  my god

kate  i m going to tell you
what i tell every young doctor 
hopefully  you ll be the first to listen 
on your day off  get as far away
from this place as you can 
go someplace where you feel
most like yourself 
dear ms  forster 
i got your note   
   and i m afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding 
as far as i know  the lake house
has been empty for several years 
maybe your note was intended for
the sandburg house down the shore   
    since no one has lived
in this house for years 
but i m curious about the paw prints  
dear mr  wyler  i m very familiar
with the sandburg cottage   
   and i can guarantee
i never lived there 
i m old fashioned  but i don t think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet 
so let me try again 
i used to live at the lake house 
then i moved 
now i live at 1620 north racine
in chicago 
i d appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any 
oh  by the way  it s 2006 
has been all year  ask anyone 
2006 
what does she mean  2006 
god 
oh  god 
 good morning  mr  wyler 
 morning  mr  wyler 
 morning  sir 
 morning  morning 
hello  mr  wyler 
mr  wyler 
sir 
well  obviously 
i derived my inspiration   
   for the metaphor
of the fugue  the loop   
yeah 
 two hours of that shit  you kidding me 
 what are you talking about 
 he didn t say a word 
 sadistic  bitter  bitter old man 
i think you re being
a little overdramatic 
where are you going 
man  i love that place 
i can t believe that thing s
still running 
yep 
you look like shit 
i missed you too 
hey  forget about him 
 condos 
 riviera estates 
 you re joking 
 i don t believe this 
i come back after four years   
   and i get this in front of me 
 what 
my brother thinking
he s frank lloyd whatever 
 oh  come on 
 dad keeps you hostage   
   in that little
mythmaking factory of his   
   while you haven t built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage 
that s funny you say that  actually 
i have a hamster cage in mind 
a development of them  actually 
prefab  no foundations 
what do you think about that 
see  that s what i m talking about 
you have vision 
speaking of which   
   l d like you to know
i bought a house 
 where 
 on the lake 
a lake house 
so you are making some money 
well  it s a dump 
been abandoned for years  but   
so you got an abandoned 
haunted lake hou   
that s as good a reason as any   
   for selling out and joining
the flabby developers  guild 
 how about this  i even got a dog 
 you got a dog 
he just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere 
 what are we doing here 
 i have to deliver a letter 
it should be here 
1620 north racine 
but   
   there s nothing here 
are we meeting someone 
does somebody live here  what 
yeah 
i thought so 
should we ring the bell 
dear ms  forster 
i went to 1620 north racine 
and it s not there 
it s just a construction site 
from the pictures it looks nice 
but not for another 18 months 
what am i missing here 
maybe you got the address wrong 
because you got the date wrong too 
you really wanna play this game 
if you are truly in the year 2004   
   then   
   be forewarned 
remember that day 
you were not happy  remember that 
i know 
okay  my mystery correspondent 
i get it 
just in case you really are
where and when you think you are   
   you ll need this 
there was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick 
so plenty of rest  lots of fluids 
doctor s orders 
snow  right 
yeah  come to papa 
jackie 
jack 
jack  come on  come on  girl 
come on  come on  jack 
 lmpossible  i know  not possible   
   but it s happening  
okay 
where am i 
very clever 
 the lake house  
the lake house  as you can see 
i  too  am at the lake house   
   but i m getting tired of these games
so i m leaving  okay  bye 
thank you  bye 
maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly 
i m a doctor 
dedicated to curing the sick 
at least  trying to 
i m an architect  i like to build 
and while i wouldn t say
my current project is ideal   
   it allows me to be here  in this place 
and that s enough for now 
but tell me something  if you re working
in a hospital in chicago now   
   where were you before  in my time 
two years ago  in your time   
   i was working
in internal medicine in madison 
tell me about the future 
what s it like in the year 2006 
i m afraid the world s
pretty much the same 
of course  we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars   
   and no one talks anymore
because we can read each other s minds 
but the truth is  man from the past   
   not much has really changed
in 2006 
speaking of the past  though 
i ve been thinking about the paw prints 
 how is that possible 
 well  i think we have the same dog 
oh  yeah  what s yours like 
according to the vet 
mine is eight years old in my time   
   six in yours 
she s skinny  has sad eyes  snores 
and sleeps like a person 
i don t know why  but i call her jack 
hello  jack 
it s nice out here 
let s not go out for dinner 
let s stay here 
 hey 
 we have to eat 
what are you doing 
you re supposed to be asleep 
i ll cook 
i thought you didn t like to cook 
no  i don t like to cook 
is she gonna marry him 
 what do you think 
 i don t know  he s kind of old 
 where are you going 
 okay  he s not that old 
my mom s last boyfriend was bald 
he was nice   
   but my mom didn t marry him 
 no 
 there s always something better
coming around the corner  
that s what she says 
maybe that s what that lady should do 
wait for something better   
   to come around the corner 
 maybe 
but if she s not careful 
she could spend her whole life waiting 
do you want me to bring
anything back with me 
yes  what about
a nice bottle of wine   
   to celebrate 
 what time shall i come back 
 seven o clock 
sorry i haven t made it
to the mailbox lately 
it s been a long week  all night shifts 
good to hear from you 
i thought you left me 
you should know that you re
my only connection to the future 
how come we never talk
about the things we like 
well  let s see 
reading the classics to jack 
 who s his favorite 
 dostoyevsky 
for me  this city 
on a day when the light is so clear   
   that i can touch every detail   
   every brick and window
in the buildings i love 
come on  take a walk with me
this saturday  let me show you 
you re crazy  why are you going
through all this trouble for me 
no trouble  summer s here 
okay  your turn  favorite things 
where to start  okay 
when i smell the flowers
before i see them 
when it starts to rain
just as the picnic is ending 
and i love the smell of jack s paws 
you didn t forget
to mention your husband  did you 
well  of course i love my husband 
who is also a doctor 
plastic surgeon
for small farm animals 
good  i m married too 
i ve got eight children 
and none of them look like me 
 i m worried  kate 
 i would be too 
i m single 
me too 
number 27 
she s a beauty 
my father used to tell me   
   she was the grandma
for all the houses in the city 
he used to take me on walks
like i m taking you now 
 alex 
 kate 
i wish we could have
done this walk together 
so  what do you think 
he sounds like a nice boy 
sounds like a nice boy 
anything else 
 he has wonderful penmanship 
 mother   
   look at the date on the letter 
the date 
 you mean the time thing 
 yes 
 that s just a detail 
 just a detail 
about the   
the other day   
   it was not a good moment 
i was in a hell of a hurry 
of course 
you ve got some nice pieces here 
oh  yeah  music s fine  music helps 
it s like nietzsche says 
  life would be senseless    
  without music  
i guess i told you that  huh 
pour yourself a drink 
can you appreciate
a good wine by now 
you bet 
you know  you ll have to forgive
your father for being curious   
   but where have you been
all these years 
i thought your kerouac days
were behind you 
 i m sorry  what 
 what 
oh  you can come up  if you like 
what are you working on 
oh  i m just   
i m just remembering things 
it s not such an easy job 
let me tell you 
nor is it particularly innocent 
in my case 
your father is writing his memoirs 
 are we in it 
 what do you think 
do you wanna be 
do you 
of course 
you were all a part of your father s life 
why are you talking to me
in the third person 
well  l    i don t   
because i m writing about myself 
i suppose  why  doesn t it suit you 
i thought you might like these 
what are these 
something you ve been working on 
no  they re    they re yours 
from a house i just bought
on the lake 
oh  yes  i heard  they said
some sleazy little condo developer   
   had snapped it up 
oh  come on  indulge your father 
can t you take a little joke 
for god s sake 
come on 
tell me 
where have you been 
i really want to know 
i was trying to forget you 
or forgive you 
did you succeed 
no 
let me know
if you need any help remembering 
oh  yeah  i will 
charging 360  get 1 milligram of epi 
have 300 amio ready in case we need it 
 all clear 
 clear 
hold compression  start bagging 
he s got a rhythm  slow 
 do we have a pulse with that 
 we got a pulse  thready 
 it s getting stronger 
 long days  these days 
i just worked 30 hours straight 
every time i stop to take a breath   
   i realize how isolated
i ve let myself become 
believe me 
you can get a bit desperate 
that one  okay  there you go 
nice move  very nice  nice 
it s not that i m complaining 
i love my work 
and our tour through chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty 
but my heart still misses
the lake house   
   and its trees 
i miss those trees so much 
don t worry  kate 
we ll be together in time 
even if we re far apart 
i ll find a way to be close to you   
   and take care of you 
katerina 
take this 
 you should eat more  you too skinny 
 i m not too skinny 
remember how you used to eat
when you were little 
 with your hands 
 yes  i remember 
now  did you or did you not
write to each other 
 to your father 
 no  to clark gable 
yes  to dad 
i   
what  mom 
before your father   
yeah 
 there was this boy 
did you love him 
yeah 
well  why didn t you marry him 
so that you could ask me
this question someday 
looks smaller 
when did he complete it 
you weren t born yet 
and i was 8 
corbusier meets frank lloyd wright 
you know  dad played cards
with both of them 
 sharing a joint 
 yeah  well   
can t swim 
there should be a stairway
down to the water  a porch  a deck 
here  you re in a   
in a box 
a glass box with a view
to everything that s around you   
   but you can t touch it 
no interconnection
between you and what you re looking at 
i don t know  you know 
he s got this big maple growing   
   right in the middle of the house 
 containment 
containment and control 
this house is about ownership 
not connection 
i mean  it s beautiful  seductive  even 
but it s incomplete 
it was all about him 
dad knew how to build a house 
not a home 
but you know   
   i think he wants us to do
what he couldn t 
but admitting that   
   would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way   
   that he could do more 
and that tortures him 
do you remember
being here with mom 
i remember she tried
to make it work here   
   with us   
   with him 
hey  what about visionary vanguard 
 what about it 
 come on 
you can t convince me you re gonna
be happy building saltboxes for tourists 
nobody s gonna admire you for that 
 admire me for that 
 yeah  visionary vanguard 
that s your idea 
i can t  but you can keep the name 
no  come on 
it s gotta be you and me 
henry  i m sorry  i can t 
i just   
 what 
 i ve got other plans 
you have a girlfriend 
no

kate  have you   
   read persuasion 
what 
 by jane austen 
 i know who it s by 
yeah  it s   
it s my favorite book 
why did you bring something like that up 
what made you bring that up 
i just    a friend of mine gave it
to me recently  and i was wondering   
   what it was about 
it s    it s wonderful 
 yeah 
 yeah 
it s about   
about waiting 
these two people  they   
they    they meet 
they almost fall in love 
but the timing isn t right 
they    they have to part 
and then   
   years later  they   
they meet again 
they get another chance 
you know  but they don t know
if too much time has passed 
if they waited too long  if it s   
   you know 
too late to make it work 
why do you like that 
i don t know 
don t get me wrong 
it s beautiful in a kind of   
 no  it s terrible 
 it s terrible 
 that s terrible 
 it s terrible 
that s   
yeah  it s    that s terrible 
it s a personal question   
   but have you ever been
through anything like that 
 me  no  no  no 
 no 
when i was   
when i was 16   
   i was completely in love
with this guy 
he played guitar   
   and i ran away from home   
   and went to san francisco
so i could go live with him 
yeah  he convinced me
i had a beautiful voice   
   and i dreamed of becoming a singer 
i love san francisco 
yeah  he was   
he was my first love 
probably the only one 
 he must have been a great guy 
 i don t    i don t know  l   
he may have been  it didn t last
long enough for me to find out 
yeah  truth is  l   
i can t even remember
what he looked like 
 really 
 yeah 
then that s too bad 
my dad    my dad showed up  actually 
 you were in trouble 
 he came in 
yeah  i was in trouble 
he yanked me back to chicago 
yeah 
and he was sick  and he   
he had these    these dreams
of me becoming a doctor  you know 
you know  and eventually 
they became my dreams too 
he was right 
you know  l   
i feel good helping people 
then he died

what 
hello 
hey  henry 
what 
you ll let me know if you need anything 
yes  i will 
 hi 
 good afternoon 
i m looking for my father  i don t know
which room he s in  simon wyler 
 mr  wyler  the architect 
 yes 
i m anna klyczynski 
i m the attending for your father 
hey  what happened  how is he 
he s okay  he s had a heart attack 
fortunately  relatively minor 
his vitals are fine and he s stable   
   but it will require an intervention 
he s agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow 
good to see you re taking it easy 
well  you    you didn t need to come 
i m perfectly well 
perfectly all right 
well  you had a heart attack  dad 
i had an episode  for chrissake 
nothing more 
appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective 
well then  i just wanna let you know
i m here if you need anything 
coffee 
what 
you heard me 
coffee 
there s something
i never told you  kate 
you see  it was my father
who built the lake house 
i mean  with his own hands 
and it was a long time ago 
before he was famous   
   when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother 
her name was mary 
and the house was a gift for her 
she was smart and funny 
she could have done anything  but chose
to take care of my brother and i   
   and help him build his career 
you see  the more successful he became 
the more impossible he was to live with 
finally  she just couldn t take
living with him anymore 
she left him 
within a year  she got sick 
unfortunately  she never learned
how to stop loving him 
he wasn t at the funeral 
when i asked him why   
go on  alex  what did he say 
he said   she was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house  
and then he gave me
one of his architect of the year grins 
i hope you appreciate this 
i had to sneak past
three nurses and your attending 
oh  jeez  it s hot 
it s not decaf  is it 
it should be  but it isn t 
that s not bad  thank you   
   son 
 you re welcome 
 where s your brother 
i sent him away 
he wasn t feeling well 
 you know how he is  he worries 
 yeah  i know 
he gets that from your mother 
i m afraid 
she always worried too much 
what are you looking at 
oh  yeah  here  take a gander 
it s a proposal for a museum 
 who is it 
 someone new 
oh  i like the walkways 
where the light falls 
what are the materials 
granite  aluminum 
white panels
are straight out of meier   
   but the interior color coming through
the front windows  that s different 
it s not new 
but it s clean  uncluttered 
i like it 
when was the last time
you were in barcelona 
years ago  with you  mom and henry 
do you remember visiting
casa de la caritat 
the almshouse 
that s right  you mentioned meier 
his barcelona museum stands
in the same area as casa de la caritat 
it drinks the same light 
meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light   
   and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within  but indirectly 
and that was important 
because although light enhances art   
   it can also degrade it  but you know
all that already  you son of a gun 
now  this   
   where do you suppose
this is to be built 
i have no idea 
 oh  but you said you liked it 
 conceptually 
now  come on 
you know as well as i do
that the light in barcelona   
   is quite different
from the light in tokyo 
and the light in tokyo
is different from that in prague 
a truly great structure  one that
is meant to stand the tests of time   
   never disregards its environment 
an architect takes that into account 
he knows that if he wants presence 
he must consult with nature 
he must be captivated by the light 
always the light  always 
hey  i have an emergency 
take my shift  please 
hello 
 mr  wyler 
 yes 
this is dr  klyczynski
at chicago city hospital 
i m afraid i have some
difficult news for you 
i m so sorry  alex 
i wish somehow
i could be there with you   
   that we could sit together and look
out over the water and the light   
   in this house your father built 
i could be a shoulder for you
like you ve been for me 
and tell you that
everything is gonna be okay 
if i could do one thing for you today   
   from here   
   one small  simple thing
from the future   
   i hope this is it 
it won t be published
for a couple of years   
   but i don t think
you should have to wait that long 
i hope it helps you know
how much you were loved 
pick a place  i ll be there  i promise 
tomorrow  what do you say 
but  alex 
it won t be tomorrow for you 
 you re gonna have to wait two years 
 i know  i don t care  i ll wait 
are you sure  i don t know 
i do  i ve never been so sure
of anything in my life 
okay  i ll see you in two years  then 
see you tomorrow  then 
kate   
   where would you like to go 
ii mare 
when were you hoping
to dine with us

what about persuasion 
you told me  they wait

life is not a book  alex 
and it can be over in a second 
i was having lunch with my mother
at daley plaza   
   and a man was killed
right in front of me 
he died in my arms 
and i thought 
 it can t end just like that
on valentine s day  
i thought about all the people
who love him  waiting at home   
   who will never see him again 
and then i thought 
 what if there is no one  
what if you live your whole life
and no one is waiting 
so i drove to the lake house
looking for any kind of answer 
and i found you 
and i let myself get lost 
lost in this beautiful fantasy
where time stood still 
but it s not real  alex 
i have to learn to live
the life that i have got
