what i tell every young doctor
hopefully youll be the first to listen
on your day off get as far away
from this place as you can
go someplace where you feel
most like yourself
dear ms forster
i got your note
and im afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding
as far as i know the lake house
has been empty for several years
maybe your note was intended for
the sandburg house down the shore
since no one has lived
in this house for years
but im curious about the paw prints
dear mr wyler im very familiar
with the sandburg cottage
and i can guarantee
i never lived there
im oldfashioned but i dont think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet
so let me try again
i used to live at the lake house
then i moved
now i live at 1620 north racine
in chicago
id appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any
oh by the way its 2006
has been all year ask anyone
what does she mean 2006
god
oh god
good morning mr wyler
morning mr wyler
morning sir
morning morning
hello mr wyler
mr wyler
sir
well obviously
i derived my inspiration
for the metaphor
of the fugue the loop
yeah
two hours of that shit you kidding me
what are you talking about
he didnt say a word
sadistic bitter bitter old man
i think youre being
a little overdramatic
where are you going
man i love that place
i cant believe that things
still running
yep
you look like shit
i missed you too
hey forget about him
condos
riviera estates
youre joking
i dont believe this
i come back after four years
and i get this in front of me
what
my brother thinking
hes frank lloyd whatever
oh come on
dad keeps you hostage
in that little
mythmaking factory of his
while you havent built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage
thats funny you say that actually
i have a hamster cage in mind
a development of them actually
prefab no foundations
what do you think about that
see thats what im talking about
you have vision
speaking of which
ld like you to know
i bought a house
where
on the lake
a lake house
so you are making some money
well its a dump
been abandoned for years but
so you got an abandoned
haunted lake hou
thats as good a reason as any
for selling out and joining
the flabbydevelopers guild
how about this i even got a dog
you got a dog
he just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere
what are we doing here
i have to deliver a letter
it should be here
1620 north racine
but
theres nothing here
are we meeting someone
does somebody live here what
yeah
i thought so
should we ring the bell
dear ms forster
i went to 1620 north racine
and its not there
its just a construction site
from the pictures it looks nice
but not for another 18 months
what am i missing here
maybe you got the address wrong
because you got the date wrong too
you really wanna play this game
if you are truly in the year 2004
then
be forewarned
remember that day
you were not happy remember that
i know
okay my mystery correspondent
i get it
just in case you really are
where and when you think you are
youll need this
there was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick
so plenty of rest lots of fluids
doctors orders
snow right
yeah come to papa
jackie
jack
jack come on come on girl
come on come on jack
lmpossible i know not possible
but its happening
okay
where am i
very clever
the lake house
the lake house as you can see
i too am at the lake house
but im getting tired of these games
so im leaving okay bye
thank you bye
maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly
im a doctor
dedicated to curing the sick
at least trying to
im an architect i like to build
and while i wouldnt say
my current project is ideal
it allows me to be here in this place
and thats enough for now
but tell me something if youre working
in a hospital in chicago now
where were you before in my time
two years ago in your time
i was working
in internal medicine in madison
tell me about the future
whats it like in the year 2006
im afraid the worlds
pretty much the same
of course we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars
and no one talks anymore
because we can read each others minds
but the truth is man from the past
not much has really changed
in 2006
speaking of the past though
ive been thinking about the paw prints
how is that possible
well i think we have the same dog
oh yeah whats yours like
according to the vet
mine is eight years old in my time
six in yours
shes skinny has sad eyes snores
and sleeps like a person
i dont know why but i call her jack
hello jack
its nice out here
lets not go out for dinner
lets stay here
hey
we have to eat
what are you doing
youre supposed to be asleep
ill cook
i thought you didnt like to cook
no i dont like to cook
is she gonna marry him
what do you think
i dont know hes kind of old
where are you going
okay hes not that old
my moms last boyfriend was bald
he was nice
but my mom didnt marry him
no
theres always something better
coming around the corner
thats what she says
maybe thats what that lady should do
wait for something better
to come around the corner
maybe
but if shes not careful
she could spend her whole life waiting
do you want me to bring
anything back with me
yes what about
a nice bottle of wine
to celebrate
what time shall i come back
seven oclock
sorry i havent made it
to the mailbox lately
its been a long week all night shifts
good to hear from you
i thought you left me
you should know that youre
my only connection to the future
how come we never talk
about the things we like
well lets see
reading the classics to jack
whos his favorite
dostoyevsky
for me this city
on a day when the light is so clear
that i can touch every detail
every brick and window
in the buildings i love
come on take a walk with me
this saturday let me show you
youre crazy why are you going
through all this trouble for me
no trouble summers here

mother

yes
thats just a detail
just a detail
about the
the other day

i was in a hell of a hurry

youve got some nice pieces here
oh yeah musics fine music helps
its like nietzsche says
life would be senseless
without music
i guess i told you that huh
pour yourself a drink
can you appreciate
a good wine by now
you bet
you know youll have to forgive
your father for being curious
but where have you been
all these years
i thought your kerouac days
were behind you
im sorry what
what
oh you can come up if you like
what are you working on
oh im just
im just remembering things
its not such an easy job
let me tell you
nor is it particularly innocent
in my case
your father is writing his memoirs
are we in it
what do you think
do you wanna be
do you
of course
you were all a part of your fathers life
why are you talking to me
in the third person
well l i dont
because im writing about myself
i suppose why doesnt it suit you
i thought you might like these
what are these
something youve been working on
no theyre theyre yours
from a house i just bought
on the lake
oh yes i heard they said
some sleazy little condo developer
had snapped it up
oh come on indulge your father
cant you take a little joke
for gods sake
come on
tell me
where have you been
i really want to know
i was trying to forget you
or forgive you
did you succeed
no

if you need any help remembering
oh yeah i will
charging 360 get 1 milligram of epi
have 300 amio ready in case we need it

hold compression start bagging
hes got a rhythm slow
do we have a pulse with that
we got a pulse thready
its getting stronger
long days these days
i just worked 30 hours straight
every time i stop to take a breath
i realize how isolated
ive let myself become
believe me
you can get a bit desperate
that one okay there you go
nice move very nice nice
its not that im complaining
i love my work
and our tour through chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty
but my heart still misses
the lake house
and its trees
i miss those trees so much
dont worry kate
well be together in time
even if were far apart
ill find a way to be close to you
and take care of you
katerina
take this
you should eat more you too skinny
im not too skinny
remember how you used to eat
when you were little
with your hands
yes i remember
now did you or did you not
write to each other
to your father
no to clark gable
yes to dad
i
what mom
before your father
yeah
there was this boy
did you love him
yeah
well why didnt you marry him
so that you could ask me
this question someday
looks smaller
when did he complete it
you werent born yet
and i was 8
corbusier meets frank lloyd wright
you know dad played cards
with both of them
sharing a joint
yeah well
cant swim
there should be a stairway
down to the water a porch a deck
here youre in a
in a box
a glass box with a view
to everything thats around you
but you cant touch it
no interconnection
between you and what youre looking at
i dont know you know
hes got this big maple growing
right in the middle of the house
containment
containment and control
this house is about ownership
not connection
i mean its beautiful seductive even
but its incomplete
it was all about him
dad knew how to build a house
not a home
but you know
i think he wants us to do
what he couldnt
but admitting that
would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way
that he could do more
and that tortures him
do you remember
being here with mom
i remember she tried
to make it work here
with us
with him
hey what about visionary vanguard

no its terrible

thats
yeah its thats terrible
its a personal question

when i was
when i was 16
i was completely in love
with this guy
he played guitar
and i ran away from home
and went to san francisco
so i could go live with him
yeah he convinced me
i had a beautiful voice
and i dreamed of becoming a singer
i love san francisco
yeah he was
he was my first love
probably the only one
he must have been a great guy
i dont i dont know l
he may have been it didnt last
long enough for me to find out
yeah truth is l
i cant even remember
what he looked like
really
yeah
then thats too bad
my dad my dad showed up actually
you were in trouble
he came in
yeah i was in trouble
he yanked me back to chicago
yeah
and he was sick and he
he had these these dreams
of me becoming a doctor you know

he was right
you know l
i feel good helping people
then he died

you should have said something
how you were with your boyfriend
you know what excuses excuses
you are a coward
im not a coward
oh really
well what about your girlfriend
what i told you already
shes not my girlfriend
hes not my boyfriend either
oh really well what is he then
your brother
we have a comedian whatd you have
a clown for breakfast this morning
wonderful our first fight

and go sing it in san francisco
what
hello
hey henry
what
youll let me know if you need anything
yes i will
hi
good afternoon
im looking for my father i dont know
which room hes in simon wyler
mr wyler the architect
yes
im anna klyczynski
im the attending for your father
hey what happened how is he
hes okay hes had a heart attack
fortunately relatively minor
his vitals are fine and hes stable
but it will require an intervention
hes agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow
good to see youre taking it easy
well you you didnt need to come
im perfectly well
perfectly all right
well you had a heart attack dad
i had an episode for chrissake
nothing more
appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective
well then i just wanna let you know
im here if you need anything
coffee
what
you heard me
coffee
theres something
i never told you kate
you see it was my father
who built the lake house
i mean with his own hands
and it was a long time ago
before he was famous
when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother
her name was mary
and the house was a gift for her
she was smart and funny
she could have done anything but chose
to take care of my brother and i
and help him build his career
you see the more successful he became
the more impossible he was to live with
finally she just couldnt take
living with him anymore
she left him
within a year she got sick
unfortunately she never learned
how to stop loving him
he wasnt at the funeral
when i asked him why
go on alex what did he say
he said she was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house
and then he gave me
one of his architectoftheyear grins
i hope you appreciate this
i had to sneak past
three nurses and your attending
oh jeez its hot
its not decaf is it
it should be but it isnt
thats not bad thank you
son
youre welcome
wheres your brother
i sent him away
he wasnt feeling well
you know how he is he worries
yeah i know
he gets that from your mother
im afraid
she always worried too much
what are you looking at
oh yeah here take a gander
its a proposal for a museum
who is it
someone new
oh i like the walkways
where the light falls
what are the materials
granite aluminum
white panels
are straight out of meier
but the interior color coming through
the front windows thats different
its not new
but its clean uncluttered
i like it
when was the last time
you were in barcelona
years ago with you mom and henry
do you remember visiting
casa de la caritat
the almshouse
thats right you mentioned meier
his barcelona museum stands
in the same area as casa de la caritat
it drinks the same light
meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light
and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within but indirectly
and that was important
because although light enhances art
it can also degrade it but you know
all that already you son of a gun
now this
where do you suppose
this is to be built
i have no idea
oh but you said you liked it
conceptually
now come on
you know as well as i do
that the light in barcelona
is quite different
from the light in tokyo
and the light in tokyo
is different from that in prague
a truly great structure one that
is meant to stand the tests of time
never disregards its environment
an architect takes that into account
he knows that if he wants presence
he must consult with nature
he must be captivated by the light
