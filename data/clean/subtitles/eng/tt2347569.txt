  yes 
  not the   frances 
  ow 
i tried to make a frittata 
but it s really more of a scramble 
this is interesting 
 to praise a work of literature
by calling it sincere   
is now at best a way of saying that 
although it may be given   
no aesthetic or intellectual
admiration   
i wouldn t eat
a domesticated dog 
you say that
just because they re cute 
don t be stupid 
i should sleep in my own bed 
why 
because i bought it 
stay 
but take off your socks 
  it s hairless 
  no  it has fine  curly hair 
there s this house
in westchester  
the basement
is all cornish rexes 
it smells awful 
the top floor is siamese cats 
  i m allergic to cats 
  they re hypoallergenic 
  this is a special frances kitty 
  oh  who knew 
this one s the runt  which is cheaper 
but i think it s the best one anyway 
i figure one runt
and one regular 
i put a hundred dollar
down payment on each cat 
well  80 for the runt
and a hundred for the other one 
  why not just get one cat 
  a cat needs a buddy  if you get one  you need two 
i ll give you  200
to get no cats 
so who will take care of them
if you go away 
i thought we could
get  em together 
and move them back and forth
between our apartments 
no  i thought maybe   
you could move in with me 
oh  wow 
  do you want to move in with me 
  yeah 
yes  i mean 
i do have this other thing 
  what other thing 
  well  i don t know 
i promised sophie
i d stay through the lease   
and she ll probably
want to renew it 
is that bad 
i m sorry  i feel bad 
  can t she find someone else 
  yeah  but it s my friend 
  uh huh 
  i want to move in with you    okay

to move in  you said no 
  but i can t 
  you can  you don t want to 
  who is it

  what 
  i want to pay you for the cats 
i m not gonna take
money from you   
but i am going
to get the cats anyway

a single guy with two cats 
why would i be single 
  with two cats 
  no  i know 
i mean

  it s great 
  i know 
  i love it  put it on my mix 
  aren t these headphones tits 
i just got  em  they re super duper
noise canceling   
so i don t have
to hear lev fuck 
  oh  no 
  all right 
lev and i were talking about getting
a maid to come once a week 
  a maid 
  yeah  it s not that expensive 
it s like 400 bucks a month 
do you know
i m actually poor 
you aren t poor 
there are poor people 
you aren t one of them 
you d feel poor if you had
as little money as i do 
but you re not poor 
that s offensive to actual poor people 
yeah  i guess that s true 
you want  
  you want to hear something hilarious 
  yes 
lev thinks we re gonna
end up married 
i m too tall to marry 
you are 
that s so funny 
why does he think that 
well  i did want to sleep with you
when i first met you 
but now   totally undateable 
i guess we are like a married couple
in a way  we talk  we don t have sex 
yeah  we get along super well 
sophie and i were like that too 
right  but sophie s a girl   
and you re both straight 
so it had less  like   
real world probability 
right  well  
okay  i m done 
i hope i don t have the spins
when i lie down 
just lay on your back
by the edge of the bed   
and put one foot on the floor 
it helps 
good night  then

stupid question  i thought i d ask it 
oh  no  i m   i m a lawyer 
  what do you do 
  that s such a stupid question 
just kidding 
um  it s kind of hard to explain 
because what you do
is complicated 
uh  because i don t really do it 
  i am a dancer  i guess 
  mm 
frances and i
are in the same company 
but rachel s in the main company 
i m an apprentice 
hopefully the touring company soon

rachel and i have
a really cool apartment 
or rachel does 
and i m staying there for six ish weeks

up in the air right now 
i like being alone 
  i just got back from sacramento 
  oh 
oh  andy and janelle
just got back from paris 
six and a half hours
on a plane with a baby 
won t be doing that again soon 
but it was heaven 
do you ever get to paris 
uh  no  not really 
kind of  once 
actually  no 
what s that museum   
with the escalators and tubes 
  the pompidou 
  yeah 
they have this great place
in the sixth 
  oh  it s a little pied a terre 
  literally 
yeah  but it s
a really special place 
yeah  it s just so hard
to get to spend any time there   
since i got the job at the journal   
and the baby 
i d love to go to paris 
i ll bet it s magic 
uh  my friend
from college  abby   
who moved there with her boyfriend
because he works at a bank   
in college  she was one
of the top five group of friends   
but then zoe became closer
to the group and abby moved   
to the outer circle 
sophie and abby
never totally got along   
and then she started
dating paul   
who i always thought
would ve dated any of us   
but    he ended up with abby 
well  if you re ever there   
  we like for it to be used 
  yeah 
i don t see myself
getting there super soon   
but    thanks  thanks 
that is a very sexy dress 
fuck  i sound
like a gay grandmother 
frances  i think you know
one of my colleagues at goldman  
reade  patch  krause 
yeah  i know patch 
  sup  brah  
that s him 
nobody is better   
at anticipating inflection points
than patchy 
his girlfriend  sophie  and i
are the same person with different hair 
not really 
we went to college together   
and we used to take the train into the
city on weekends and make bad decisions 
  you got pregnant 
  what  no 
she s a great lady 
i really like her  so smart 
yeah  i mean   yeah 
i mean  we re all smart 
yeah  but she s   
book smart smart 
she s actually not 
she doesn t really read   
except for work 
which is the funny thing 
she seems like
she reads a lot to me 
  i read way more 
  mm hmm 
i don t know why i m shit talking sophie 
she s basically the best person i know 
  it s kind of crazy though  right 
  mm  yeah 
  which part 
  japan 
japan 
yeah  they re moving to japan
in a couple of weeks 
  wait  what 
  patch got transferred 
it s a really cool position 
he s gonna be   
the director of research
for all the asian markets 
for how long 
indefinitely 
but sophie has a job
at random house 
she quit 
oh 
the pilates thing is nice 
you feel so good 
frances and i do
a lot of yoga  it s good for dance 
it s fun to go with somebody 
to have a friend to go with 
i think i m better looking
than i am in pictures 
nadia  
i want this one moment 
it s   it s what i want
in a relationship   
which might explain
why i am single now  ha  ha 
it s  uh  
it s kind of hard lo  
it s that thing
when you re with someone   
and you love them
and they know it   
and they love you
and you know it   
but it s a party   
and you re both talking
to other people   
and you re laughing
and shining   
and you look across the room   
and catch each other s eyes   
but   but not because
you re possessive   
or it s precisely sexual   
but because   
that is your person
in this life 
and ifs funny and sad 
but only because   
this life will end 
and it s this secret world   
that exists right there   
in public  unnoticed 
that no one else knows about 
it s sort of like how they say
that other dimensions exist   
all around us  but we don t have
the ability to perceive them 
that s  
that s what i want
out of a relationship 
or just life  i guess 
love 
i sound stoned 
i m not stoned 
thanks for dinner  bye 
oh  bye 
where the fuck are you going 
i m kinda wasted 
i was gonna go home  is that okay 
i don t care

myself this morning 
i woke up with this tickle
in my throat 
listen  do you want
to take over nancy s position 
  nancy  who works in the office 
  she 3 pregnant 
oh  no  i don t 
who told you that 
no  i m asking you 
i assumed you re not
keeping on with the company 
  you don t want to be an apprentice for life 
  nope 
you should think about putting
your own stuff together 
  like how 
  like  your own work 
oh  no  i kind of
gave that up after college 
plus  that was basically like   
cheerleaders
doing my choreography 
  i always liked the stuff you did  even for the kids 
  yeah 
you really should think
about taking nancy s position 
it s not a lot of money 
but it s enough to keep you going 
  why would i do that 
  it s just a good day job   
while you figure out whether
you want to choreograph 
  you say it like it s easy 
  no  it s not easy 
but if you work here 
you can use the studio space 
no
