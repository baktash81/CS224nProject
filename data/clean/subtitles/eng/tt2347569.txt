yes
not the  frances
ow
i tried to make a frittata
but its really more of a scramble
this is interesting
to praise a work of literature
by calling it sincere
is now at best a way of saying that
although it may be given
no aesthetic or intellectual
admiration
i wouldnt eat
a domesticated dog
you say that
just because theyre cute
dont be stupid
i should sleep in my own bed
why
because i bought it
stay

theres this house
in westchester
the basement
is all cornish rexes
it smells awful
the top floor is siamese cats
im allergic to cats
theyre hypoallergenic

this ones the runt which is cheaper
but i think its the best one anyway
i figure one runt
and one regular
i put a hundreddollar
down payment on each cat
well 80 for the runt
and a hundred for the other one
why not just get one cat
a cat needs a buddy if you get one you need two
ill give you 200
to get no cats

get em together
and move them back and forth
between our apartments

booksmart smart
shes actually not
she doesnt really read

she seems like
she reads a lot to me
i read way more
mmhmm
i dont know why im shittalking sophie
shes basically the best person i know
its kind of crazy though right
mm yeah
which part
japan
japan

patch got transferred

the director of research
for all the asian markets
for how long
indefinitely
but sophie has a job
at random house
she quit
oh
the pilates thing is nice
you feel so good
frances and i do
a lot of yoga its good for dance
its fun to go with somebody
to have a friend to go with
i think im betterlooking
than i am in pictures
nadia
i want this one moment
its  its what i want
in a relationship
which might explain
why i am single now ha ha
its uh
its kind of hard lo
its that thing
when youre with someone
and you love them
and they know it
and they love you
and you know it
but its a party
and youre both talking
to other people
and youre laughing
and shining
and you look across the room
and catch each others eyes
but  but not because
youre possessive
or its precisely sexual
but because
that is your person
in this life
and ifs funny and sad
but only because
this life will end
and its this secret world
that exists right there
in public unnoticed
that no one else knows about
its sort of like how they say
that other dimensions exist
all around us but we dont have
the ability to perceive them
thats
thats what i want
out of a relationship
or just life i guess
love
i sound stoned
im not stoned
thanks for dinner bye

in my throat
listen do you want
to take over nancys position
nancy who works in the office
she 3 pregnant
oh no i dont
who told you that
no im asking you
i assumed youre not
keeping on with the company
you dont want to be an apprentice for life
nope
you should think about putting
your own stuff together
like how
like your own work
oh no i kind of
gave that up after college
plus that was basically like
cheerleaders
doing my choreography
i always liked the stuff you did even for the kids
yeah
you really should think
about taking nancys position
its not a lot of money
but its enough to keep you going
why would i do that
its just a good day job
while you figure out whether
you want to choreograph
you say it like its easy
no its not easy
but if you work here
you can use the studio space
no
ill get something else
im really close to getting something
a job
