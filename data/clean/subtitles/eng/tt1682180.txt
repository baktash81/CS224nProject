these senses are the fruits
of a lifetime of longing
longing to be rescued
to be completed
just as the skirt needs the wind to billow
im not formed by things
that are of myself alone
i wear my fathers belt
tied around my mothers blouse
and shoes which are from my uncle
this is me
just as a flower does not choose its color
we are not responsible
for what we have come to be
only once you realize this
do you become free
and to become adult
is to become free
happy birthday
happy birthday india
richard no
a family man
devoted husband to his wife evelyn
loving father to his daughter india
he was a model to our town
and of what it means to be a man
who walks through the world
with openness honesty and integrity
india
richard stoker was taken from us
by a cruel twist of fate
india
the reasons for which
are unknown and unknowable
by an accident
nobody would have predicted
it would have been impossible
for even an outstanding architect
like richard
to understand gods
great design
india
india
the guests will be here soon
can you help
mrs mcgarrick in the kitchen
please
dont do this to me india
not today
when they pried open his car
you know his body was burned
to a crisp
terrible accident
poor thing
india was so close to her father
whos gonna look after her
shes still got her mother
her mother look after her
more like the other way around
you know what
this whole accident is so strange
have you heard
all the rumors floating around
you dont think he meant
to drive off the bridge
why did he have to go two states away
i dont know
everything all right
yes mrs mcgarrick
now im wondering
if i kept them in the fridge too long
what do you think
was i too stingy with the paprika
your deviled eggs remind me
of when i was a little girl
well you may be all grown up
but you still get eggshells all over the floor
have you outgrown your shoes
did you find your birthday present yet
i found the box but it was empty
are you sure
did you check
check again
every year i thought it was my father
who left me shoes on my birthday
but all this time its been
tell me what it opens
how would i know
all right
that was my brother
you know originally
they were part of a set of four
but then i broke one as a kid
now im seeing in this house
someone must have let another break
no it wasnt me
when we when we moved in it broke
as the housekeepers were unpacking it
india come and say hello
to your uncle charlie
india come over
see you soon
hello india
come on
she hates to be touched
im her mother
what a curse
you know charlie richard used to say
that we had lost you
to the rest of the world forever
why india youre white as a sheet
is something wrong
yes
my father is dead
how beautiful
richard was so proud of indias hunting
that he stuffed every single thing she killed
what a tragic waste of life
these live particularly deep in the forest
theyd be very hard to catch
i guess richard and india were a good team
its kind of disrespectful him not wearing
black to his own brothers funeral
he must have come back today
from the middle east or something
its just part of a dig
in some old part of istanbul
no i think he was digging for something
quite different gold in indonesia
i really want to thank you
for your words this morning
well you and richard deserve every word
the wines good
there you are come and join us
this is richards brother
hello
hes back
nice to meet you
these are the blooms
good friends of ours
good evening
i didnt know richard had a brother
nice to meet you
were sorry for your loss
how did you know richard
got his doctorate from oxford
when he was 24
stoker sure had the brains
yeah just look at india
hello again
do you want to know why
you feel at a disadvantage right now
because i didnt know
you existed until today
because youre standing below me
you look like my father
i am so sorry
its your loss too
in about 60 seconds
your mothers gonna tell you
that im gonna be
staying here for a while
but i want it to be your decision too
why
because
its important to me
this really is a beautiful garden
the soil
is so soft
good for digging
im not exactly sure what youre driving at
i dont want any trouble
i am the only one
who would know anything about it
i did everything you asked of me
i kept you informed every year
i was your eyes your ears
your hands all this time
youre acting like youre in diapers now
and youve done this to me
ever since you were a child im tired of it
i am tired of it
all right
mrs mcgarrick
mrs mcgarrick
where is she
i havent seen her yet
good morning
encyclopedia of
funerals and mourning
its afternoon
i guess it is
do you think you could
thats my girl thank you
what are you doing today
thought id
draw the curtains stop the clocks
cover the mirrors
and then retire to my room
dont be morbid
get rid of that dress what is that
its my mourning attire
why dont we get out of here
go shopping
we could get some ice cream
in victorian times a widow was expected
to mourn her husband for two years
at least
india
but in ancient china
they built a straw hut beside the grave
and lived there for three years doing nothing
you and me ice cream fresh air
come on all these years
of hunting trips with him
and all im asking for
is one afternoon with me
thats what your father would have wanted
you know your father and i
werent always so distant
i miss when he was
young
passport
united states of america
india
india
mature aroma
you chose a good year
you cant compare it to a younger wine
too tannic
not ready to be open
you should have come with us india
oh the open top
the air it felt so good
we stopped and uncle charlie
got some ice cream for you
one chocolate one vanilla
did i get it right
i like the swirl kind
you can make the swirl yourself
you lazy thing
wheres mrs mcgarrick
shes still not here
what what are we supposed to do
im not much in the kitchen
i can cook a little
no you dont have to do that
id love to
charlie who in the world are you
india would you take these
down to the freezer please
do as your uncle tells you
thank you
thank you india
too cold down there
no
you know there was a time
richard used to cook meals like this
wasnt there india
im sorry of course
that was before you were born
where did you learn to cook like this
charlie
madame jacquin
she ran a michelinstarred restaurant
outside of toulouse called linstitution
a female chef
in her opinion
there was nothing a man could master
that a woman couldnt make
what do you mean
it sounds better in french
did i tell you on the way home
your french accent is perfect
one of the perks of a firstclass education
i could stay locked up in this house
for the rest of my life
yet still speak impeccable french
i know youre not gonna spend
the rest of your life locked up in this house
how do you spend your days
i want to know my brothers wife
oh i dont know where to start
charlie you didnt even touch your food
did you put poison
in the food just for us girls
but india ate everything
practically licked it clean
im glad you enjoyed it
now can i get you anything else
maybe some ice cream
no
no thank you
i mean no thank you
would you like to
play something for us after dinner
i dont think so
would you
india
i mean no thank you
why didnt you tell me i had an uncle
because i barely knew about charlie myself
i mean hes been traveling the world
for as long as ive known your father
you know he used to say to me
what kind of family is family
that never comes home
lets stop talking about richard excuse me
im sorry
the year you were born
what do you want from me
to be friends
we dont need to be friends
were family
it takes time to observe attentively
wait for the moment that our eyes
finally penetrate the inside of the subject
look marv
see that flower
the way it just hangs there
my eyes are penetrating
the inside of you
observe carefully
and youll note that this plant
check out pitts
i want you to really
hey
pitts
yes mr feldman
is there something youd like to share
with the rest of the class
yeah ive got something id like to share
with india
mhs
hes gorgeous
hey
come back
mom
its going to rain
relax
there
curl your fingers
no
watch me you see
im teaching him piano
uncle charlie is a complete beginner
put on some dry clothes
and come play with us
why dont you take a hot shower first
or youll catch a cold come on here
good morning sweetie
charlie cleared off the court yesterday
so were just gonna walk on over
you dont want to come do you
hello india
i took one of richards belts
his whites are a little big
ready
lets go
india
its me
come and give your auntie gin a hug
what time did you get in gwendolyn
around 4
thats right
and when do you fly out
that remains to be seen
id originally planned
to stay for only a day or two
but now im thinking
i should stay a bit longer
spend a little quality time with india
how nice for her
charles
auntie gin
how long have you been here
not long
were so grateful that hes taken time away
from his commitments in europe
europe
yes
evie dear after dinner
i was thinking perhaps you and i could talk
we are talking
alone
about what
like richard for instance
richard
yes evie richard
my nephew your late husband
i dont think ill be forgetting his name
any time soon
of course not i just thought
there might be arrangements to be made
things to be settled
our lawyer has said none of this has anything
to do with you youre not in the will
no dear i mean something entirely different
like for example
maybe we could talk about
your living here with charlie like this
auntie gin isnt shy when it comes
to expressing her opinions about me
like when richard asked me to marry him
what auntie gin might be surprised
to learn is that those opinions
are neither wanted needed or appreciated
evie
you come into my home and attack me
at a time like this
evie
im sure auntie gin didnt mean anything
you didnt mean anything by it did you
no
no of course not evie dear
now would either of you two
like to play something for us after dinner
no thank you
no thank you
good night auntie gin
dont mind evie shes just tired
what was the name of your hotel again
the biltmore
the biltmore
maybe we could have breakfast together
just us girls
oh im not sure
can you take her to the biltmore hotel
ill probably have a headache in the morning
drive carefully
auntie gin stay the night here
you made the evening much nicer
oh thank you dear
but an old woman needs time on her own
to recover good night sweet child
call me
are there any other hotels in town
besides the biltmore
even family ties have no meaning
when food is scarce
this one knows there is no room
for his brother in the hunt
while this sibling rivalry may seem cruel
in the end it is for the best
each day in the hunt
brings the eagle closer to maturity
and chicks of his own
the most patient of predators
the black eagle can circle for hours
waiting for the perfect moment to strike
the fish will provide much needed
nourishment for her growing chicks
i was wondering
if anyone had turned in a cell phone
i think i may have dropped it
when i was checking in
are you absolutely certain
all right oh wait wait
what number do i have to press to dial out
nine yes i thought so
motel
please ring the bell
at night
come on
the mountains are no place
for the faint of heart
the steep terrain and harsh climate
make a challenging climate
for even the strongest of species
wings are freedom
while the eagle prefers to find its own meals
there is nothing wrong in having a little help
any advantage in nature is to be appreciated
and what the left
a hearty meal for the hungry bird
who lived to hunt another day
thirteen pounds
and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet
you said you were staying
at the biltmore hotel
and yet here you are
i even had to call the cab company
prey does not suspect
the hunter is circling high above
and is taken completely by surprise
hey yo yo look whos here
no kidding
is it is it true
is it
middlebend high

youre wearing the nightgown i bought you
tonight i felt like wearing something silk
now that i think about it
i never brushed your hair
did i
you were busy
with what
i dont know
you and your father
were always on your hunting trips
how could i compete with all of those
dead birds you constantly brought home
i saw you in the dining room today
i dont know what you think you saw
but nothing happened
you were so still
i never even heard you there
dad taught me that
hunting
to wait
in silence
we wouldnt need food or drink
we would watch everything
the patterns of tree branches
spreading out
the thousands of shapes clouds make
i could count the number of leaves on a tree
in five hours
i always thought dad liked hunting
but tonight i realized he did it for me
he used to say sometimes
you need to do something bad
to stop you from doing something worse
tomorrow im gonna go
to the hairdresser
after i clean out your fathers study

dear india happy birthday
you are 5 years old today
i wish i could be there for your party
but your uncle is far away in africa
taking pictures for the magazine
dearest india im writing this letter to you
from florence
yesterday i circled michelangelos david
for hours he carries a sling
his belted weapon over his left shoulder
you are my dearest and only niece
my silent and invisible partner
and these are the lessons for you
in our many chapters together
dear india
happy birthday again
ive missed your first teeth coming out
ill never see the holes in your smile or how
they will fill in as you mature into a young lady
greetings from saintètienne where everyone
i meet insists on kissing both cheeks
this custom of hugging and kissing
i think you too would find this uncomfortable
if i found it was you in an embrace
i could make an exception
i wonder if you would too
happy valentines
happy halloween
merry christmas
though i never receive a letter
i see your messages in the stars
or in the music i hear
it is a whistling tune from a lonely man
wandering in a foreign land
i sense things so acutely
until it becomes almost too much
i wonder if for you too
life is made difficult by
the fact that you can hear what others
cannot hear see what they cannot see
i know that someday youll be very special
india and you already are
i know inside you feel some loneliness
because you are the only one
please know that i am with you
as we share the same blood
tonight ill fall asleep as i try to imagine
that youll grow up and take over our name
how i want to meet you
all my love charlie
all my love charlie

of what happened to richard
richard was completely taken with jonathan
that summer jonathan had just learned
how to climb the stairs
lets go again lets go
he couldnt resist climbing any staircase
he came across
its been 20 years since your family
donated this building to crawford
it may look old now
but charlies room is still very comfortable
as you know
he was the one who wanted to stay here
and he insisted on being discharged
on this day

the day i left crawford

i remember
what day was it
it was my 18th birthday
i was waiting
for you
everything ive ever done
for you india
happy birthday india
yes sheriff
i was hungry
so i stopped by rockets for some fries
i bumped into whip at the parking lot
and we decided to go for a walk
at night those woods are dangerous
oh i wasnt scared
not with whip there
hes so strong
i see
so we had a very nice time
and then
and then i went home
i thought whip said
he was heading home too
any idea what time that was
well that was
when did you eat the fries
excuse me
well you said you went there
because you were hungry
and then that is after having a nice time
you would have become even more hungry
and if you went to eat some fries
i could find some people that can remember
what time they saw you
i think i
i think i must have been
i must have been blushing
it was my first time outside with a boy
i didnt want to be seen
it was 830 when you came home
il trovatore was playing on pbs
yeah when i came home
my uncle was watching tv
so i watched it with him
just one moment
il trovatore
what is it its a foreign movie
no no its an opera by verdi
would you like me to write it down
im fine
i do hope whips okay
well his folks are a mess
then again i have a feeling that hell turn up
boys that age
well you know how they are
im sure i do
you will let me know if you hear anything
wont you
will do
okay
well ill be in touch
goodbye sheriff
goodbye sheriff
oh by the way did your housekeeper
ever get in touch after leaving town so quick
no
she didnt
strange how people
can just disappear on you
hell be back
what are we going to do
i think well really love new york
when do we leave
im sorry
tomorrow night
should we do it again
im hungry lets eat first
you know ive often wondered
why it is we have children in the first place
and the conclusion ive come to is
at some point in our lives
we realize things are
theyre screwed up beyond repair
so we decide to start again
wipe the slate clean
start afresh
and we have children
little carbon copies we can turn to and say
you will do what i could not
you will succeed where i have failed
because we want someone
to get it right this time
but not me
personally speaking
i cant wait to watch life tear you apart
india
who are you
you were supposed to love me werent you
come up to my room please
i enjoyed your performance
india go and pack a small bag
well be leaving shortly
i
i came to say goodbye
i cant allow you to do this
why not
there are little things one notices
along the way but one suppresses because
because
why do you think
love
richard loved india
he would never have driven
so far away on her birthday
not unless for some reason he was called
away by someone he couldnt say no to
auntie gin
wanted to speak to me about you
but she never did come back after that night
did she
people disappear
all the time
have me instead
but stay away from my daughter
shes of age
of age for what
to live in this house on her own
while her mother finally travels the world
dont you want to speak french in france
