these senses are the fruits
of a lifetime of longing 
longing to be rescued 
to be completed 
just as the skirt needs the wind to billow   
   i m not formed by things
that are of myself alone 
i wear my father s belt
tied around my mother s blouse 
and shoes which are from my uncle 
this is me 
just as a flower does not choose its color   
   we are not responsible
for what we have come to be 
only once you realize this
do you become free 
and to become adult   
   is to become free 
happy birthday
happy birthday india
richard  no 
a family man   
   devoted husband to his wife  evelyn   
   loving father to his daughter  india 
he was a model to our town   
   and of what it means to be a man
who walks through the world   
   with openness  honesty and integrity 
 india 
 richard stoker was taken from us   
   by a cruel twist of fate 
india 
the reasons for which
are unknown and unknowable 
by an accident
nobody would have predicted 
it would have been impossible
for even an outstanding architect   
   like richard   
   to understand god s
great design 
india 
india 
the guests will be here soon 
can you help
mrs  mcgarrick in the kitchen 
please 
don t do this to me  india 
not today 
when they pried open his car   
    you know  his body was burned   
 to a crisp 
terrible accident 
poor thing 
india was so close to her father 
 who s gonna look after her 
 she s still got her mother 
her mother look after her 
more like the other way around 
you know what 
this whole accident is so strange 
have you heard
all the rumors floating around    
you don t think he meant
to drive off the bridge 
 why did he have to go two states away 
 i don t know 
 everything all right 
 yes  mrs  mcgarrick 
now i m wondering
if i kept them in the fridge too long 
what do you think 
was i too stingy with the paprika 
your deviled eggs remind me
of when i was a little girl 
well  you may be all grown up 
but you still get eggshells all over the floor 
have you outgrown your shoes 
did you find your birthday present yet 
i found the box  but it was empty 
are you sure 
did you check 
check again 
every year i thought it was my father
who left me shoes on my birthday 
but all this time  it s been   
tell me what it opens 
how would i know 
all right 
that was my brother    
you know  originally
they were part of a set of four   
   but then i broke one as a kid 
now i m seeing in this house
someone must have let another break 
no  it wasn t me 
when we    when we moved in  it broke
as the housekeepers were unpacking it 
india  come and say hello
to your uncle charlie 
india  come over 
see you soon 
hello  india 
come on 
she hates to be touched 
i m her mother 
what a curse 
you know  charlie  richard used to say   
   that we had lost you
to the rest of the world forever 
why  india  you re white as a sheet 
is something wrong 
yes 
my father is dead 
how beautiful 
richard was so proud of india s hunting
that he stuffed every single thing she killed 
what a tragic waste of life 
these live particularly deep in the forest 
they d be very hard to catch 
i guess richard and india were a good team 
it s kind of disrespectful  him not wearing
black to his own brother s funeral 
he must have come back today
from the middle east or something 
it s just part of a dig
in some old part of istanbul 
no  i think he was digging for something
quite different  gold in indonesia 
i really want to thank you
for your words this morning 
well  you and richard deserve every word 
the wine s good 
there you are  come and join us 
this is richard s brother 
hello 
 he s back 
 nice to meet you 
these are the blooms 
good friends of ours 
good evening 
i didn t know richard had a brother 
nice to meet you 
we re sorry for your loss 
how did you know richard 
got his doctorate from oxford
when he was 24 
stoker sure had the brains 
yeah  just look at india 
hello  again 
do you want to know why
you feel at a disadvantage right now 
because i didn t know
you existed until today 
because you re standing below me 
you look like my father 
i am so sorry 
it s your loss too 
in about 60 seconds 
your mother s gonna tell you   
   that i m gonna be
staying here for a while   
   but i want it to be your decision too 
why 
because   
   it s important to me 
this really is a beautiful garden 
the soil   
   is so soft 
good for digging 
i m not exactly sure what you re driving at 
i don t want any trouble 
i am the only one
who would know anything about it 
i did everything you asked of me 
i kept you informed every year 
i was your eyes  your ears 
your hands all this time 
you re acting like you re in diapers now   
   and you ve done this to me
ever since you were a child  i m tired of it 
 i am tired of it 
 all right 
mrs  mcgarrick 
mrs  mcgarrick 
where is she 
i haven t seen her yet 
good morning 
encyclopedia of
funerals and mourning
it s afternoon 
i guess it is 
do you think you could    
that s my girl  thank you 
what are you doing today 
thought i d   
   draw the curtains  stop the clocks   
   cover the mirrors
and then retire to my room 
don t be morbid 
get rid of that dress  what is that 
it s my mourning attire 
why don t we get out of here 
go shopping 
we could get some ice cream 
in victorian times  a widow was expected
to mourn her husband for two years 
at least 
 india 
 but in ancient china   
   they built a straw hut beside the grave
and lived there for three years doing nothing 
you and me  ice cream  fresh air 
come on  all these years
of hunting trips with him   
   and all i m asking for
is one afternoon with me 
that s what your father would have wanted 
you know  your father and i
weren t always so distant 
i miss when he was   
   young

india 
mature aroma 
you chose a good year 
you can t compare it to a younger wine 
too tannic 
not ready to be open 
you should have come with us  india 
oh  the open top   
   the air  it felt so good 
we stopped and uncle charlie
got some ice cream for you

you know  there was a time   
   richard used to cook meals like this 
wasn t there  india 
i m sorry  of course 
that was before you were born 
where did you learn to cook like this 
charlie 
madame jacquin 
she ran a michelin starred restaurant
outside of toulouse called  l institution  
a female chef 
in her opinion 
there was nothing a man could master   
   that a woman couldn t make 
what do you mean 
it sounds better in french 
did i tell you on the way home 
your french accent is perfect 
one of the perks of a first class education 
i could stay locked up in this house
for the rest of my life   
   yet still speak impeccable french 
i know you re not gonna spend
the rest of your life locked up in this house 
how do you spend your days 
i want to know my brother s wife 
oh  i don t know where to start 
charlie  you didn t even touch your food 
did you put poison
in the food just for us girls 
but india ate everything 
practically licked it clean 
i m glad you enjoyed it 
now  can i get you anything else 
maybe some ice cream 
no 
 no  thank you  
i mean  no  thank you 
would you like to
play something for us after dinner 
i don t think so 
would you 
india 
i mean  no  thank you 
why didn t you tell me i had an uncle 
because i barely knew about charlie myself 
i mean  he s been traveling the world
for as long as i ve known your father 
you know  he used to say to me 
 what kind of family is family
that never comes home  
let s stop talking about richard  excuse me 
i m sorry 
1994 
the year you were born 
what do you want from me 
to be friends 
we don t need to be friends 
we re family 
it takes time to observe attentively 
wait for the moment that our eyes   
   finally penetrate the inside of the subject 
look  marv   
   see that flower 
the way it just hangs there 
my eyes are penetrating
the inside of you 
observe carefully
and you ll note that this plant    
check out pitts 
i want you to really    
hey 
pitts 
yes  mr  feldman 
is there something you d like to share
with the rest of the class 
yeah  i ve got something i d like to share 
with india 
mhs
he s gorgeous 
hey 
come back 
mom 
it s going to rain 
relax 
there 
curl your fingers 
no 
watch me  you see 
i m teaching him piano 
uncle charlie is a complete beginner 
put on some dry clothes
and come play with us 
why don t you take a hot shower first
or you ll catch a cold  come on  here 
good morning  sweetie 
charlie cleared off the court yesterday 
so we re just gonna walk on over 
you don t want to come  do you 
hello  india 
i took one of richard s belts 
his whites are a little big 
ready 
let s go 
india 
it s me 
come and give your auntie gin a hug 
 what time did you get in  gwendolyn 
 around 4 
that s right 
and when do you fly out 
that remains to be seen 
i d originally planned
to stay for only a day or two   
   but now i m thinking
i should stay a bit longer 
spend a little quality time with india 
how nice for her 
 charles 
 auntie gin 
how long have you been here 
not long 
we re so grateful that he s taken time away
from his commitments in europe 
 europe 
 yes 
evie  dear  after dinner 
i was thinking perhaps you and i could talk 
 we are talking 
 alone 
 about what 
 like richard  for instance 
 richard 
 yes  evie  richard 
my nephew  your late husband 
i don t think i ll be forgetting his name
any time soon 
of course not  i just thought
there might be arrangements to be made 
things to be settled 
our lawyer has said none of this has anything
to do with you  you re not in the will 
no  dear  i mean something entirely different 
like  for example   
   maybe we could talk about
your living here with charlie like this 
auntie gin isn t shy when it comes
to expressing her opinions about me 
like when richard asked me to marry him 
what auntie gin might be surprised   
   to learn is that those opinions
are neither wanted  needed  or appreciated 
 evie   
 you come into my home and attack me   
   at a time like this 
evie   
i m sure auntie gin didn t mean anything 
you didn t mean anything by it  did you 
no 
no  of course not  evie dear 
now  would either of you two
like to play something for us after dinner 
 no  thank you 
 no  thank you 
good night  auntie gin 
don t mind evie  she s just tired 
what was the name of your hotel again 
 the biltmore 
 the biltmore 
maybe we could have breakfast together 
 just us girls 
 oh  i m not sure 
 can you take her to the biltmore hotel 
 i ll probably have a headache in the morning 
 drive carefully 
 auntie gin  stay the night here 
you made the evening much nicer 
oh  thank you  dear 
but an old woman needs time on her own
to recover  good night  sweet child 
call me 
are there any other hotels in town
besides the biltmore 
even family ties have no meaning
when food is scarce 
this one knows there is no room
for his brother in the hunt 
while this sibling rivalry may seem cruel 
in the end  it is for the best 
each day in the hunt
brings the eagle closer to maturity 
   and chicks of his own 
the most patient of predators 
the black eagle can circle for hours   
   waiting for the perfect moment to strike 
the fish will provide much needed
nourishment for her growing chicks 
i was wondering
if anyone had turned in a cell phone 
i think i may have dropped it
when i was checking in 
are you absolutely certain 
all right  oh  wait  wait 
what number do i have to press to dial out 
nine  yes  i thought so 
motel
please ring the bell
at night
come on 
the mountains are no place
for the faint of heart 
the steep terrain and harsh climate
make a challenging climate   
   for even the strongest of species 
   wings are freedom 
   while the eagle prefers to find its own meals 
there is nothing wrong in having a little help 
any advantage in nature is to be appreciated 
and what the left    
   a hearty meal for the hungry bird
who lived to hunt another day 
   thirteen pounds
and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet 
you said you were staying
at the biltmore hotel   
   and yet  here you are 
i even had to call the cab company 
   prey does not suspect
the hunter is circling high above   
   and is taken completely by surprise 
 hey  yo  yo  look who s here

now that i think about it 
i never brushed your hair   
   did i 
you were busy 
with what 
i don t know 
you and your father
were always on your hunting trips 
how could i compete with all of those
dead birds you constantly brought home 
i saw you in the dining room today 
i don t know what you think you saw   
   but nothing happened 
you were so still 
i never even heard you there 
dad taught me that 
hunting 
to wait 
in silence 
we wouldn t need food or drink 
we would watch everything 
the patterns of tree branches
spreading out   
   the thousands of shapes clouds make 
i could count the number of leaves on a tree
in five hours 
i always thought dad liked hunting 
but tonight i realized he did it for me 
he used to say   sometimes
you need to do something bad   
   to stop you from doing something worse  
tomorrow  i m gonna go
to the hairdresser   
   after i clean out your father s study

dear india  happy birthday 
you are 5 years old today 
i wish i could be there for your party   
   but your uncle is far away in africa
taking pictures for the magazine 
dearest india  i m writing this letter to you
from florence 
yesterday  i circled michelangelo s david
for hours  he carries a sling 
his belted weapon over his left shoulder 
 you are my dearest and only niece 
 my silent and invisible partner 
and these are the lessons for you
in our many chapters together 
 dear india 
 happy birthday again 
i ve missed your first teeth coming out 
i ll never see the holes in your smile or how
they will fill in as you mature into a young lady 
greetings from saint ètienne  where everyone
i meet insists on kissing both cheeks 
 this custom of hugging and kissing 
 i think you  too  would find this uncomfortable 
if i found it was you in an embrace 
i could make an exception 
 i wonder if you would  too 
 happy valentine s 
 happy halloween 
 merry christmas 
 though i never receive a letter    
 i see your messages in the stars 
or in the music i hear 
it is a whistling tune from a lonely man
wandering in a foreign land 
i sense things so acutely
until it becomes almost too much 
i wonder if for you  too 
life is made difficult by   
the fact that you can hear what others
cannot hear  see what they cannot see 
i know that someday you ll be very special 
india  and you already are 
 i know inside you feel some loneliness 
 because you are the only one 
please know that i am with you
as we share the same blood 
tonight  i ll fall asleep as i try to imagine
that you ll grow up and take over our name 
how i want to meet you 
 all my love  charlie 
 all my love  charlie

the day i left crawford   
   the day your father had his accident   
   what day was it  do you remember 
yes 
i remember 
what day was it 
it was my 18th birthday 
i was waiting 
for you 
everything i ve ever done 
for you  india 
happy birthday  india 
yes  sheriff 
i was hungry 
so i stopped by rockets for some fries 
i bumped into whip at the parking lot
and we decided to go for a walk 
at night  those woods are dangerous 
oh  i wasn t scared 
not with whip there 
he s so strong 
i see 
so we had a very nice time 
and then 
and then i went home 
i thought whip said
he was heading home too 
any idea what time that was 
well  that was    
when did you eat the fries 
excuse me 
well  you said you went there
because you were hungry 
and then  that is  after having a nice time 
you would have become even more hungry   
   and if you went to eat some fries   
   i could find some people that can remember
what time they saw you 
i think i   
i think i must have been   
i must have been blushing 
it was my first time outside with a boy 
i didn t want to be seen 
it was 8 30 when you came home 
il trovatore was playing on pbs 
yeah  when i came home 
my uncle was watching t v   
   so i watched it with him 
just one moment 
il trovatore 
what is it  it s a foreign movie 
no  no  it s an opera by verdi 
 would you like me to write it down 
 i m fine 
i do hope whip s okay 
well  his folks are a mess 
then again  i have a feeling that he ll turn up 
boys that age    
well  you know how they are 
i m sure i do 
you will let me know if you hear anything 
won t you 
will do 
okay 
well  i ll be in touch 
goodbye  sheriff 
goodbye  sheriff 
oh  by the way  did your housekeeper
ever get in touch after leaving town so quick 
no 
she didn t 
strange how people
can just disappear on you 
he ll be back 
what are we going to do 
i think we ll really love new york 
when do we leave 
i m sorry 
tomorrow night 
 should we do it again 
 i m hungry  let s eat first 
you know  i ve often wondered
why it is we have children in the first place 
and the conclusion i ve come to is   
   at some point in our lives 
we realize things are    
they re screwed up beyond repair 
so we decide to start again 
wipe the slate clean 
start afresh 
and we have children 
little carbon copies we can turn to and say 
 you will do what i could not 
you will succeed where i have failed  
because we want someone
to get it right this time 
but not me 
personally speaking 
i can t wait to watch life tear you apart 
india   
   who are you 
you were supposed to love me  weren t you 
come up to my room  please 
i enjoyed your performance 
india  go and pack a small bag 
we ll be leaving shortly 
i    
i came to say goodbye 
i can t allow you to do this 
why not 
there are little things one notices
along the way  but one suppresses because    
because 
why do you think 
love 
richard loved india 
he would never have driven
so far away on her birthday 
not unless  for some reason he was called
away by someone he couldn t say no to 
auntie gin
wanted to speak to me about you   
   but she never did come back after that night 
did she 
people disappear   
   all the time 
have me instead 
but stay away from my daughter 
she s of age 
of age for what 
to live in this house on her own
while her mother finally travels the world
