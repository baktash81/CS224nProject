why would a guy
put his tongue in my mouth
what
a boy does that because
he wants you to bite it off
go
bye mom
hi

yeah
lets go
pop everyones decorating the house
good
janet wanted to come

great ready one two
pop this is it pull over
the big one there see
lii buy that for you when lm rich
i bet you will
mom and sis would like it
you know what you want for christmas
you want the bike right
its the bike but you think
its too expensive
see i know how you think
speak up if you dont ask for
anything its what you get nothing
okay
theres this guy billy schnar
hes really cute
billy schnar
were the smartest in class
you know who he likes guess
who
melissa thomas you know her
the one with braces and ugly red hair
she thought israel was in europe
you know why he likes her guess
because shes stupid
no because shes got boobs
or it looks like she does
but she doesnt she wears a bra
which squishes her fat together
and makes her look like
she has big boobs
pop lm gonna die
if i dont marry billy schnar
lm gonna die all because
melissa has boobs
thats just way too tragic
even for shakespeare
okay pop so thats why for
christmas ld like a bra
to enhance what i got
which is more than melissa
youre too young
pop you cant negotiate my boobs
too young or not lve got them
lm a woman
its hard to see through my clothes
quiet
the answer is no
keep your mind on books not boys
this is why therapists are wealthy
moments like this
why didnt he just get her the bra
ts certainly cheaper than a bicycle
parents and the damage they can do
sometimes its endless
but she survived
y ou know what they say
that which doesnt kill you
makes you want to die
f she was southern
shed have turned life into a song
since shes from connecticut
she turned it into a memoir
someone wants to publish it
if she clears one hurdle
so she called me for help
thats why this is a tough day
to tell her m leaving her
can always tell when shes nervous
she wears a lot of makeup
and today shes packed on
an extra layer of nervous
forty minutes late
lm not complaining
its just so unlike you
