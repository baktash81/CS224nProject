than anything the rest of your life 
you run to each other 
your bodies  your lips   
   they re coming closer and closer
together  until  finally   
   you kiss 
okay  go 
janet  like this 
i feel weird  bev 
weird  wait till he shoves
his tongue in your mouth 
ann  did you get the lights
for the dining room 
l m looking for them  teresa 
now this is christmas  huh 
yes  it s beautif ul 
have lou look for them 
she wants it up
before leo and bev get back 
i gotta go 
okay  leo 
beverly ann donof rio  your father s
waiting to go buy the tree 
l m coming  mom 
okay  so is christmas 
 this song s giving me a headache 
 wait  before you go with pop 
why would a guy
put his tongue in my mouth 
what  
a boy does that because
he wants you to bite it off 
go 
bye  mom 
hi 
 you ready 
 yeah 
let s go 
 pop  everyone s decorating the house 
 good 
janet wanted to come 
when you re in college 
it ii be her turn 
dreaming of warmth 
dream with the everly brothers 
 good  that s our song 
 great  ready  one  two 
pop  this is it  pull over 
the big one  there  see 
l ii buy that for you when l m rich 
 i bet you will 
 mom and sis would like it 
you know what you want for christmas 
you want the bike  right 
it s the bike  but you think
it s too expensive 
see  i know how you think 
speak up  if you don t ask for
anything  it s what you get  nothing 
okay 
there s this guy  billy schnar 
he s really cute 
billy schnar 
we re the smartest in class 
you know who he likes  guess 
 who 
 melissa thomas  you know her 
the one with braces and ugly red hair 
she thought israel was in europe 
you know why he likes her  guess 
 because she s stupid 
 no  because she s got boobs 
or it looks like she does 
but she doesn t  she wears a bra   
   which squishes her fat together   
   and makes her look like
she has big boobs 
pop  l m gonna die
if i don t marry billy schnar 
l m gonna die all because
melissa has boobs 
that s just way too tragic 
even for shakespeare 
okay  pop  so that s why for
christmas  l d like a bra 
to enhance what i got 
which is more than melissa 
 you re too young 
 pop  you can t negotiate my boobs 
too young or not  l ve got them 
l m a woman 
 it s hard to see through my clothes 
 quiet 
the answer is no 
keep your mind on books  not boys 
this is why therapists are wealthy  
moments like this 
why didn t he just get her the bra 
 t s certainly cheaper than a bicycle 
parents and the damage they can do 
sometimes  it s endless 
but she survived 
y ou know what they say  
 that which doesn t kill you 
makes you want to die   
 f she was southern 
she d have turned life into a song 
since she s from connecticut 
she turned it into a memoir 
someone wants to publish it 
if she clears one hurdle 
so she called me for help 
that s why this is a tough day
to tell her   m leaving her 
  can always tell when she s nervous 
she wears a lot of makeup 
and today  she s packed on
an extra layer of nervous 
forty minutes late 
l m not complaining 
 it s just so unlike you 
 sorry 
we went off to solve the problem 
her problem  mine would have to wait 
 what happened 
 you re cold  lean into the vent 
sorry 
 thanks for driving me to wallingford 
 just make it fast 
if ray doesn t sign 
they won t publish it 
he will 
 i know seeing ray is hard for you 
 seeing ray doesn t bother me 
it should  and i understand 
i won t make myself nuts 
l ii stay calm and be positive 
good 
did i show you the galleys 
it s starting to look
like a real book 
 did you just put spit in my hair 
 yeah  l m fixing it  sorry 
just a little  
okay 
i have a surprise for you 
i finished the dedication 
 of the many men who have come into my
life  there is finally one i trust 
jason  this book is for you

since you re in so much of it 
they wanna be caref ul about lawsuits 
there s a lot about you and drugs and
illegal acts  it s not flattering 
anyway
