  move  move 
  in the car 
let s go 
there s four of you 
you can count  i m impressed 
now drive 
rule one  never change the deal 
the deal was transportation   
for three men with a combined
weight of 254 kilos 
yeah  well this is a new deal 
an extra 80 kilos means   
we will not make your destination
on the gas i have allotted 
so  we ll stop and get more gas 
every stop we make exposes us 
every exposure increases
the risk of getting caught 
an extra 80 kilos means the kony
shock absorbers i installed   
for this job will not give us
the ability   
to outmaneuver any police that
might be chasing us 
which means if there is a chase 
we lose our advantage 
which also increases
the possibility of getting caught 
i don t want to get caught 
you don t want to get caught 
just drive the car  man 
or you re gonna catch a bullet
to the brains 
and who s going to drive 
shoot this asshole  i ll drive 
not without the ignition code 
you won t 
three men  254 kilos

four men robbed

the others were apprehended
early this morning   
when they took a wrong turn
on a one way street in avignon   
and ran into a taxi cab 
the police said  were it not
for the poor driving habits 
the 20 million euros in bearer
bonds would have been cashed

i smell them and my whole childhood

like proust 
you ever read proust 
monsieur frank 
no 
ah  he s fantastic 
memory like a steel trap 
he would have been a great cop 
a real detail man 
milk 
please 
thank you 
i used to have
a memory like proust 
like a filing cabinet up there 
i would see something
and remember it like that 
like  uh  license plates 
i could see a plate and
it was printed in my head 
now i need all the help i can get
remembering   
whose plate goes with whose car 
like uh  this one 
it s mine 
ah  memories 
so  where s the rest of the car 
i was hoping you could tell me 
  it was stolen 
  stolen 
i went down to frejus
to pick up a few things 
when i came out of the market 
it was   
gone 
did you report it 
it s the first on my list
of things to do today 
it s a long walk from frejus 
how did you get home 
i brought him 
i saw him walking
along the dark road 
a risky thing 
picking up a stranger
on a dark road 
he had a kind face 
i didn t see a car outside 
it s in the garage 
  may i see it 
  uh huh 
whew  wow 
ah  pretty nice car for a cook 
hey  some people have a problem
with the germans 
they re too aggressive 
they take up the best beaches
in summer 
they can t cook worth a damn 
i say anyone makes such great cars
can t be all bad 
i would say your intuition
worked out very well   
for monsieur frank  mademoiselle 
worked out for both of us 
bon 
my intuition says
this is probably   
a good time for me
to go file my report 
where s the rest of my car 
oh  yes  i almost forgot 
it was blown to pieces
at a rest stop 
what s left of it
is down at the lab 
they re trying to separate   
what was left of the two cops
in the trunk from the rest of it 
but you wouldn t know anything
about that 
no 
sorry to interrupt 
thank you for the coffee
and    the memories 
come back any time 
would you mind walking me 
no 
you have always been very quiet   
about your business 
monsieur frank 
i appreciate that 
less work for mother 
but this business at the rest stop 
this is not very quiet 
i don t suppose you would like
to tell me something   
besides a stolen car story 
if i had one  i would 
well  may i suggest   
that when the two of you show up
in my office after lunch 
you have one    a better one
than you currently have 
you are the one he wants
to see  not me 
quiet 
please  i have to think 
you were supposed to think
last night 
yeah  well  last night 
i had nightmares 
about a girl who came
into my nice  quiet life 
screwed it all up 
everything she touched broke 
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe 
ok  sorry 
i m still wondering   
if i wanna know everything
or nothing about you 
what 
just the quiet 
i thought you like quiet 
yeah  not this quiet 
are you ok 
no 
good  let s go 
go  go  go 
no  don t stay there 
frank 
come on  give me your hand 
come on 
come on  get in  get in 
no  no 
get in 
lai  look  come on 
you wanna die 
get in 
calm down  ok 
don t worry  you ok 
stay here 
i m coming back 
no  wait  wait 
put it on 
you ok 
sure  ok 
let s go 
frank 
is this your house 
frank 
yeah  guess 
frank 
should mind my own
goddamn business 
simple rule  simple little rule 
there s gotta be some dry clothes
in this house 
don t open the package 
nothing but trouble
if you open the goddamn package 
frank   
what are you doing 
making up for the trouble 
wait  wait 
  why are you making    
  no more questions 
wait  i don t like it
when things get complicated 
you like things simple 
very simple 
i m not so clear about the house 
could you explain 
mmm  one more time 
after i left    
after you left  we went for a walk
on the beach  had a swim 
where again 
past the point 
anyone else swimming at that time 
no 
did you see anybody else swimming 
no  no one 
so  you took a walk 
had a swim on a beach where
no one else was swimming 
past the point 
where you can t see or be seen
from the beach on either side 
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by 
that s the point of a romantic
swim  who wants witnesses 
and then 
then we came back to the house
and found it on fire 
just like that  on fire 
yes 
and the 5 000 rounds of spent ammo
my men found all around the house 
maybe they had the wrong house 
monsieur frank  people with
this kind of firepower   
do not make mistakes
about who they visit 
who would want you this dead 
i don t know 
any problems with a client 
i don t have clients  i m retired 
i live on my army pension 
you know that 
you have all the facts
of who i am and who i was 
you ve had them for years 
any enemies you can think of 
people from the past 
i left the past behind
when i moved here 
hmm  a past like yours 
you never leave behind 
i ll just be a moment 
don t leave 
what are you doing 
computers know everything 
you just need a password 
what  are you nuts 
we re in a police station 
you re always complaining 
except when we make love 
then you say nothing 
uh huh 
aaahh   
la  la  la   
hello 
see 
so  where will you be staying 
i don t know 
my cousin has a small hotel 
thanks  but we ll manage 
without money 
it would be hard  here   
it s not much but at least
you won t go hungry 
thank you 
  where are you going 
  going to see that guy 
good luck 
one minute 
you re not coming 
no 
but he blew up your car 
i ll buy a new one 
  he burned your house 
  i ll rebuild it 
he tried to kill you  
and as far as he now knows 
he succeeded 
look  i m gonna give you
some advice 
i don t know what you were into 
i don t care what you were into 
but whoever wanted you dead
thinks you are dead 
you have a free pass to start over 
here s the advice 
start over 
there are 400 people   
dying in a container on a ship 
my father 
my sisters   
the ship arrives today 
they will make my father a slave 
the only one who knows
the container number is that guy 
you re very good 
what do you mean 
the moment you saw
those pictures in my house 
you were setting me up
to get involved in this 
breakfast  giving the excuse
to the cop to help me 
one lie after another 
not everything is a lie 
name one thing that isn t 
what happened in the house
between us 
that was not a lie 
you were a soldier 
your job was to save people 
past tense 
what does that mean 
it means i got tired of seeing
my best efforts get turned   
into bullshit by the same people
who pay me to do the job 
no one cared 
this time  i care 
hey  thank you 
  bonjour 
  bonjour 
no phone calls for half an hour 
hello  surprise 
sit 
put your hands where
i can see them 
so  before we get to the heart
of the matter 
i have one question for you 
why did you try to kill me 
you lied to me 
you opened the package 
you broke the rules 
your rules 
what did you expect me to do 
recommend you for another job 
what s the ship number 
mr  transporter 
we can both agree i answered
your first question politely 
i won t answer any more 
so i suggest you kill me right now 
and go screw yourself 
i can t find anything 
oh  poor frank   
what did she tell you  we re
smuggling people in containers 
i tell you 
lai is the perfect name for her 
mr  kwai s on the way up 
your father s here  he ll really
get a kick out of this 
i thought your father was
in the container 
yes    i  i mean no 
there are 400 people
in that container 
stay where you are 
she s a real heartbreaker 
isn t she  frank 
ten seconds  two choices 
the information on the paper
or your brains on the desk 
now tell me i m lying 
  nine  eight   
  lai  lai 
give me the gun 
i don t know
what you re talking about 
   five  four  three  two   
one  shoot 
lai 
would i kill my own daughter 
lai 
come on  now 
put it down 
we ll talk 
she thinks we re smuggling people
in containers 
i don t know where you get
these ideas 
stay away 
would you kill your own father 
please  i m begging you 
stop what you are doing 
i do what i do 
i am who i am 
i will never change 
so if you could kill me  kill me 
but if you don t 
get this gun out of my face 
give me 
no 
i know he s innocent 
oh  you have such a good heart 
always interested in saving
innocent people 
well  here s your big chance 
drop your gun   
and you will save one 
  kill him 
  no 
the police are on the way up 
  what now 
  take her 
send in lee 
i need him to wrap something up 
just for the record  there aren t
400 people in that container 
only 395 made it here alive 
frank 
inspector  am i glad you re here 
what is this 
this man used
my partner s daughter here   
trying to blackmail us 
luckily my security got
the drop on him 
i want to press charges 
kidnapping  extortion  assault 
i know this man 
i suppose  in your business 
you have to know all types 
now should i call my lawyer 
we ll handle it 
i ll expect all of you down at
my office to give your statements 
as soon as i contact my lawyer 
we ll be more than happy to oblige 
oh    hmmm   
the doctor said you will have
a headache for a few days   
and then everything will go back
to normal 
where are they 
i think you should be more
concerned with where you are 
what got into you 
you were always so careful 
i ve got to get out of here 
oh    with the charges they filed 
you will not be getting out
for a very long time 
assaulting a distinguished   
member of the international
business community 
kidnapping his daughter 
extortion   
i m sorry  frank 
i would like to help you 
but if you continue
with the same old story 
 i am retired 
living on a pension    
i need fresh  frank 
i need new 
for once i need the truth 
ok 
they re smuggling people 
from asia  through marseilles 
in containers 
you know this for fact 
the girl told me 
you believe her 
yes 
in french we have a saying 
 never believe the cook  
she s not the cook 
oh  i suspected 
you know  frank 
no one is perfect 
so you re saying
you re gonna do nothing 
no  i m saying i m going
to start an investigation 
and in the meantime
the 400 people in that container   
could be dead already 
but what am i supposed to do 
there are laws 
did it ever occur to you   
that sometimes you have to make
your own law 
like you do 
at least with me it doesn t take
twelve months to get the job done 
oh  yes  i know  that s what i
admire about you  frank 
all that army training 
all that sneaking around 
a man like you could probably
resolve this case in how long 
twelve hours 
less 
less  impressive 
you would be the perfect man
for the job 
yes  if i were out 
yes  if you were out 
anybody moves and i kill him 
if this is how you transport 
i m amazed you get any work at all 
come on  give me a hand 
maybe i should go with you 
thanks  but  uh   
i m better alone 
that is a very small boat
to fight a very big war 
yep 
it s a good boat 
frank  here 
you ll need it 
or  maybe not 
shipment s cleared 
here s the paperwork 
take the highway all the way
to the first exit lyon 
go straight to the warehouse 
we ll be right behind you
just in case 
hey  we are ready to go 
lai  dear   
i spent thousands of dollars
for you to go to school   
and learn english 
the least you can do is speak it 
i hate you 
i m still your father 
get her out of here 
give me a minute 
aaaagh

you ll get hit by a truck 
what do you know 
i know she ll never stop
being who she is 
means she ll never be you
or anything like you 
she ll come around 
but you won t be here to see it
