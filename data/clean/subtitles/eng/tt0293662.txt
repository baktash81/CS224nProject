move move
in the car
lets go
theres four of you
you can count im impressed
now drive
rule one never change the deal
the deal was transportation
for three men with a combined
weight of 254 kilos
yeah well this is a new deal
an extra 80 kilos means
we will not make your destination
on the gas i have allotted
so well stop and get more gas
every stop we make exposes us
every exposure increases
the risk of getting caught
an extra 80 kilos means the kony
shock absorbers i installed
for this job will not give us
the ability
to outmaneuver any police that
might be chasing us
which means if there is a chase
we lose our advantage
which also increases
the possibility of getting caught
i dont want to get caught
you dont want to get caught
just drive the car man
or youre gonna catch a bullet
to the brains
and whos going to drive
shoot this asshole ill drive
not without the ignition code
you wont
three men 254 kilos

i used to have
a memory like proust
like a filing cabinet up there

like uh license plates
i could see a plate and
it was printed in my head
now i need all the help i can get
remembering
whose plate goes with whose car
like uh this one
its mine
ah memories
so wheres the rest of the car
i was hoping you could tell me
it was stolen
stolen
i went down to frejus
to pick up a few things
when i came out of the market
it was
gone
did you report it
its the first on my list
of things to do today
its a long walk from frejus
how did you get home
i brought him
i saw him walking
along the dark road
a risky thing
picking up a stranger
on a dark road
he had a kind face
i didnt see a car outside
its in the garage
may i see it
uhhuh
whew wow
ah pretty nice car for a cook
hey some people have a problem
with the germans
theyre too aggressive
they take up the best beaches
in summer
they cant cook worth a damn
i say anyone makes such great cars
cant be all bad
i would say your intuition
worked out very well
for monsieur frank mademoiselle
worked out for both of us
bon
my intuition says
this is probably
a good time for me
to go file my report
wheres the rest of my car
oh yes i almost forgot
it was blown to pieces
at a rest stop
whats left of it
is down at the lab
theyre trying to separate
what was left of the two cops
in the trunk from the rest of it
but you wouldnt know anything
about that
no
sorry to interrupt
thank you for the coffee
and the memories
come back any time
would you mind walking me
no
you have always been very quiet
about your business
monsieur frank
i appreciate that
less work for mother
but this business at the rest stop
this is not very quiet
i dont suppose you would like
to tell me something
besides a stolen car story
if i had one i would
well may i suggest
that when the two of you show up
in my office after lunch
you have one a better one
than you currently have
you are the one he wants
to see not me
quiet
please i have to think
you were supposed to think
last night
yeah well last night
i had nightmares
about a girl who came
into my nice quiet life
screwed it all up
everything she touched broke
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe
ok sorry
im still wondering
if i wanna know everything
or nothing about you
what
just the quiet
i thought you like quiet
yeah not this quiet
are you ok
no
good lets go
go go go
no dont stay there
frank
come on give me your hand
come on
come on get in get in
no no

im coming back
no wait wait

lets go
frank
is this your house
frank
yeah guess
frank
should mind my own
goddamn business
simple rule simple little rule
theres gotta be some dry clothes
in this house
dont open the package
nothing but trouble
if you open the goddamn package
frank
what are you doing
making up for the trouble
wait wait
why are you making
no more questions
wait i dont like it
when things get complicated
you like things simple
very simple
im not so clear about the house
could you explain
mmm one more time
after i left
after you left we went for a walk
on the beach had a swim
where again
past the point
anyone else swimming at that time
no
did you see anybody else swimming
no no one
so you took a walk
had a swim on a beach where
no one else was swimming
past the point
where you cant see or be seen
from the beach on either side
which makes witnesses
a little hard to come by
thats the point of a romantic
swim who wants witnesses
and then
then we came back to the house
and found it on fire
just like that on fire
yes
and the 5000 rounds of spent ammo
my men found all around the house
maybe they had the wrong house
monsieur frank people with
this kind of firepower
do not make mistakes
about who they visit
who would want you this dead
i dont know
any problems with a client
i dont have clients im retired
i live on my army pension
you know that
you have all the facts
of who i am and who i was
youve had them for years
any enemies you can think of
people from the past
i left the past behind
when i moved here
hmm a past like yours
you never leave behind
ill just be a moment
dont leave
what are you doing
computers know everything
you just need a password
what are you nuts
were in a police station
youre always complaining
except when we make love
then you say nothing
uhhuh
aaahh
la la la
hello
see
so where will you be staying
i dont know
my cousin has a small hotel
thanks but well manage
without money
it would be hard here
its not much but at least
you wont go hungry
thank you
where are you going
going to see that guy
good luck
one minute
youre not coming
no
but he blew up your car
ill buy a new one
he burned your house
ill rebuild it
he tried to kill you
and as far as he now knows
he succeeded
look im gonna give you
some advice
i dont know what you were into
i dont care what you were into
but whoever wanted you dead
thinks you are dead
you have a free pass to start over
heres the advice
start over
there are 400 people
dying in a container on a ship
my father
my sisters
the ship arrives today
they will make my father a slave
the only one who knows
the container number is that guy
youre very good
what do you mean
the moment you saw
those pictures in my house
you were setting me up
to get involved in this
breakfast giving the excuse
to the cop to help me
one lie after another
not everything is a lie
name one thing that isnt
what happened in the house
between us
that was not a lie
you were a soldier
your job was to save people
past tense
what does that mean
it means i got tired of seeing
my best efforts get turned
into bullshit by the same people
who pay me to do the job
no one cared
this time i care
hey thank you
bonjour
bonjour
no phone calls for half an hour
hello surprise
sit
put your hands where
i can see them
so before we get to the heart
of the matter
i have one question for you
why did you try to kill me
you lied to me
you opened the package
you broke the rules
your rules
what did you expect me to do
recommend you for another job
whats the ship number
mr transporter
we can both agree i answered
your first question politely
i wont answer any more
so i suggest you kill me right now
and go screw yourself
i cant find anything
oh poor frank
what did she tell you were
smuggling people in containers
i tell you
lai is the perfect name for her
mr kwais on the way up
your fathers here hell really
get a kick out of this
i thought your father was
in the container
yes i i mean no
there are 400 people
in that container
stay where you are
shes a real heartbreaker
isnt she frank
ten seconds two choices
the information on the paper
or your brains on the desk
now tell me im lying
nine eight
lai lai
give me the gun
i dont know
what youre talking about
five four three two
one shoot
lai
would i kill my own daughter
lai
come on now
put it down
well talk
she thinks were smuggling people
in containers
i dont know where you get
these ideas
stay away
would you kill your own father
please im begging you
stop what you are doing
i do what i do
i am who i am
i will never change
so if you could kill me kill me
but if you dont
get this gun out of my face
give me
no
i know hes innocent
oh you have such a good heart
always interested in saving
innocent people
well heres your big chance
drop your gun
and you will save one
kill him
no
the police are on the way up
what now
take her
send in lee
i need him to wrap something up
just for the record there arent
400 people in that container
only 395 made it here alive
frank
inspector am i glad youre here
what is this
this man used
my partners daughter here
trying to blackmail us
luckily my security got
the drop on him
i want to press charges
kidnapping extortion assault
i know this man
i suppose in your business
you have to know all types
now should i call my lawyer
well handle it
ill expect all of you down at
my office to give your statements
as soon as i contact my lawyer
well be more than happy to oblige
oh hmmm
the doctor said you will have
a headache for a few days
and then everything will go back
to normal
where are they
i think you should be more
concerned with where you are
what got into you
you were always so careful
ive got to get out of here
oh with the charges they filed
you will not be getting out
for a very long time
assaulting a distinguished
member of the international
business community
kidnapping his daughter
extortion
im sorry frank
i would like to help you
but if you continue
with the same old story
i am retired
living on a pension
i need fresh frank
i need new
for once i need the truth
ok
theyre smuggling people
from asia through marseilles
in containers
you know this for fact
the girl told me
you believe her
yes
in french we have a saying
never believe the cook
shes not the cook
oh i suspected
you know frank
no one is perfect
so youre saying
youre gonna do nothing
no im saying im going
to start an investigation
and in the meantime
the 400 people in that container
could be dead already
but what am i supposed to do
there are laws
did it ever occur to you
that sometimes you have to make
your own law
like you do
at least with me it doesnt take
twelve months to get the job done
oh yes i know thats what i
admire about you frank
all that army training
all that sneaking around
a man like you could probably
resolve this case in how long
twelve hours
less
less impressive
you would be the perfect man
for the job
yes if i were out
yes if you were out
anybody moves and i kill him
if this is how you transport
im amazed you get any work at all
come on give me a hand
maybe i should go with you
thanks but uh
im better alone
that is a very small boat
to fight a very big war
yep
its a good boat
frank here
youll need it
or maybe not
shipments cleared
heres the paperwork
take the highway all the way
to the first exit lyon
go straight to the warehouse
well be right behind you
just in case
hey we are ready to go
