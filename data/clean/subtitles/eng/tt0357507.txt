to the corinthians  he says 
 we shall not all fall asleep   
   but we will all be changed   
   in an instant  in the blink of an eye  
 when my tongue rejoices 
my body will rest in peace   
   because you will not abandon me
to the grave 
for you  o lord  have delivered
my soul to death   
   my eyes from tears 
my feet from stumbling  
 thou knowest the secrets
