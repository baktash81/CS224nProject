we thank you for our food 
thank you for my mother 
thank you for the roof over our heads
and our new friends 
and   
well  i guess that s all for now 
amen 
that s the word you re looking for  amen 
that s how you stop 
you said you didn t talk much 
but did he do any reading 
 i asked you a question 
 bill  don t 
you  shut your mouth 
stop 
you re hurting your mother  solara 
he said he read every day  did he 
stop it 
your mother would like you to tell me 
i don t know 
yes  okay  yes  yes  he was reading 
 what kind of book was he reading 
 i don t know 
 i don t know  an old leather one 
 and 
i don t know 
it had some kind of thing on the front of it 
 show me 
 i need you to let her go 
show me 
redridge 
shit  he was here the whole night 
where is he 
i don t    i don t   
 i just wanna make sure that you know that   
 i understand 
   there s no acid in there 
that s swamp water 
it doesn t matter 
just take these off  take them off 
 all right  well  let me  all right  just   
 take them off 
 hey 
 all right  you got it  coming off 
 thank you 
 coming off 
you can tell them i made you do it  all right 
all right 
 say it 
 you made me do it 
is that thing loaded 
i don t think it s loaded 
one way to find out 
look  i need that book 
i mean  i want the book and you 
but if you make me choose 
i ll kill you  i ll take the book 
why  why do you want it 
i grew up with it 
i know its power 
and if you read it  then so do you 
that s why they burned them all
after the war 
just staying alive is an act of faith 
building this town
is an even bigger act of faith 
but they don t understand that 
none of them 
and i don t have the right words
to help them  but the book does 
now  i admit
that i ve had to do things 
many  many things  that i hate  to build this 
i confess that 
but if we have that book 
i wouldn t have to 
now imagine 
imagine how different 
how righteous this little world could be
if we had the right words for our faith 
the people would truly understand
why they re here and what they re doing
and they wouldn t need
any of the uglier motivations 
it s not right to keep that book hidden away 
it s meant to be shared with others 
it s meant to be spread 
lsn t that what you want 
with all of my heart and soul 
i always believed that
i d find a place where this book belonged 
where it was needed 
but i haven t found it yet 
i love this guy 
shoot him  please 
what are you standing around for 
take him out  god damn it  take him out 
i don t like being followed 
i wanna come with you 
no  you don t 
i hate it here 
 then change it 
 my mother thinks i ll be safer with you 
i ll take you to where we get our water 
you can have all that you can carry 
i mean  all that we can carry 
carnegie knows
about two more springs up north 
he says he s gonna build more towns 
how d he know about this one 
he d been here when he was young 
in the world before 
i guess everyone else
who knew about it died 
we really better hurry 
i think i left my glasses inside 
just take a look for me  i ll look out here 
okay 
what are you doing 
you are such a liar 
i m not a liar 
you said i could come with you
if you got your water 
i didn t say that  you said that 
besides  the road s no place for you 
it s much worse than you think 
goodbye  solara 
it s nice knowing you  i mean that 
 hey 
 yeah 
fuck you 
have you washed your filthy fucking hands 
twice  with your soap 
put a crew together  we re going after him 
for a fucking book 
it s not a fucking book 
it s a weapon 
a weapon aimed right at the hearts
and minds of the weak and the desperate 
it will give us control of them 
if we wanna rule more than one
small fucking town  we have to have it 
people will come from all over 
they ll do exactly what i tell them
if the words are from the book 
it s happened before 
and it ll happen again 
all we need is that book 
then i want solara 
are you bargaining with me 
is this a deal we re making here 
we lost a lot of men 
you need me more than ever 
now  you say that book s worth the trouble 
well  i believe you 
but i want solara for it 
why not  why not 
let s get the fuck out of here 
stay on the path  it s not your concern 
stay on the path  it s not your concern 
which way are we headed

son of a bitch 
solara

please 
 the lord is my shepherd 
 i shall not want 
 he makes me to lie down in green pastures 
 leads me beside the still waters 
 he restores my soul 
 he leadeth me in the path of righteousness 
for his name s sake 
 yea  though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
 i will fear no evil  for thou art with me  
subtitles by chetan
 that s beautiful 
 you like that 
 did you write that 
 yes  i did 
really 
no  no  no 
no  that was around a long time
before you and i got here  that s for sure 
what did you mean
when you said it s not just any book 
it s the only one 
really 
after the war  people made it their business
to find and destroy
any that the fires didn t get already 
some people said this was the reason
for the war in the first place 
anyway  it s the only one that survived 
how d you get it 
they said that the war
tore a hole in the sky 
you ve probably heard the stories 
yeah 
tore a hole in the sky  sun came down
and burned everything 
everything and everybody 
you were lucky to hole up and hide
in a place like this or underground 
most people weren t lucky 
so  a year later  we started coming out 
and people wandered around 
i  not knowing what i was gonna do 
trying to find a place to survive 
one day  i heard a voice 
it s hard to explain  but it was like it   
like it was coming from inside of me 
but i could hear it
as clear as i can hear you talking to me now 
what did this voice say 
it led me
to a place where i found the book
buried under some rubble 
the voice told me
to carry the book out west 
told me that a path would be laid out for me 
that i d be led to a place
where the book was safe 
told me that i d be protected
against anyone or anything
that stood in my path 
i ve been walking ever since 
and you did all that
because a voice in your head told you to 
yes  i did 
i know what i heard 
i know what i hear 
i know i m not crazy 
and i know i would ve never made it
without help 
 what s that 
 one question too many 
go to bed 
we got an early start in the morning 
hey 
what are you doing 
 i m sorry  i thought you were sleeping

you know  you say you ve been walking
for 30 years  right 
right 
have you ever thought
that maybe you were lost 
nope 
well  how do you know
that you re walking in the right direction 
 we walk by faith  not by sight  
what does that mean 
it means that you know something 
even if you don t know something 
that doesn t make any sense 
doesn t have to make sense  it s faith 
it s faith 
it s the flower of light
in the field of darkness
that s giving me the strength to carry on 
you understand 
is that from your book 
no  it s johnny cash live at folsom prison

but never a bible  well  not until now 
well  may i ask what condition it s in 
it s beat up 
but it will do the job 
 do you think i could see it 
 yes  you may 
 that s it  it s open 
 you there 
do you have anything to write on 
could you get us
some writing paper  please 
and a lot of it 
a whole lot of it 
it can t be 
it   
it s impossible 
it can t be 
pay close attention and write down
everything i say
exactly as i say it 
 the first book of moses 
 called genesis 
 chapter one  verse one 
 in the beginning 
 god created the heavens
 and the earth 
 verse two 
 and the earth was without form
 and void 
 and darkness
 was upon the face of the deep 
 and the spirit of god
 was hovering
 over the face of the waters 
 verse three 
 and god said 
  let there be light  
 and there was light  
where is solara 
out there 
her choice 
i tried to bring her back  she refused 
what did you do when she refused 
 read it 
 what did you do to my daughter 
 read it 
 what did you do to my daughter 
you can start anytime 
i m sorry 
it s been so long  i don t remember 
 you have to 
 i have to  really 
no  no  no  no  you have to  please 
your leg 
it doesn t hurt anymore 
i can smell it 
you worked so hard for that book 
you sacrificed so much  so many men 
more than you could spare 
now all those people who were too scared
to even say your name 
they re downstairs  tearing up the bar
right now  did you know that 
and there s no one there to stop them 
and you re feverish 
i can t imagine what it must feel like
to have what you want so close
 and it might as well be a million miles away 
 stop it 
are you leaving me
