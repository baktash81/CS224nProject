in hard times like these
amen

we didnt do much talking
solara honey eat something
mom give me your hand
close your eyes
mom trust me
dear lord
we thank you for our food
thank you for my mother
thank you for the roof over our heads
and our new friends
and
well i guess thats all for now
amen
thats the word youre looking for amen
thats how you stop
you said you didnt talk much
but did he do any reading
i asked you a question
bill dont
you shut your mouth
stop
youre hurting your mother solara
he said he read every day did he
stop it
your mother would like you to tell me
i dont know
yes okay yes yes he was reading
what kind of book was he reading
i dont know
i dont know an old leather one
and
i dont know
it had some kind of thing on the front of it
show me
i need you to let her go
show me
redridge
shit he was here the whole night
where is he
i dont i dont
i just wanna make sure that you know that
i understand
theres no acid in there
thats swamp water
it doesnt matter
just take these off take them off
all right well let me all right just
take them off
hey
all right you got it coming off
thank you
coming off
you can tell them i made you do it all right
all right
say it
you made me do it
is that thing loaded
i dont think its loaded
one way to find out
look i need that book
i mean i want the book and you
but if you make me choose
ill kill you ill take the book
why why do you want it
i grew up with it
i know its power
and if you read it then so do you
thats why they burned them all
after the war
just staying alive is an act of faith
building this town
is an even bigger act of faith
but they dont understand that
none of them
and i dont have the right words
to help them but the book does
now i admit
that ive had to do things
many many things that i hate to build this
i confess that
but if we have that book
i wouldnt have to
now imagine
imagine how different
how righteous this little world could be
if we had the right words for our faith
the people would truly understand
why theyre here and what theyre doing
and they wouldnt need
any of the uglier motivations
its not right to keep that book hidden away
its meant to be shared with others
its meant to be spread
lsnt that what you want
with all of my heart and soul
i always believed that
id find a place where this book belonged
where it was needed
but i havent found it yet
i love this guy
shoot him please
what are you standing around for
take him out god damn it take him out
i dont like being followed
i wanna come with you
no you dont
i hate it here
then change it
my mother thinks ill be safer with you
ill take you to where we get our water
you can have all that you can carry
i mean all that we can carry
carnegie knows
about two more springs up north
he says hes gonna build more towns
howd he know about this one
hed been here when he was young
in the world before
i guess everyone else
who knew about it died
we really better hurry
i think i left my glasses inside
just take a look for me ill look out here
okay
what are you doing
you are such a liar
im not a liar
you said i could come with you
if you got your water
i didnt say that you said that
besides the roads no place for you
its much worse than you think
goodbye solara
its nice knowing you i mean that
hey
yeah
fuck you
have you washed your filthy fucking hands
twice with your soap
put a crew together were going after him
for a fucking book
its not a fucking book
its a weapon
a weapon aimed right at the hearts
and minds of the weak and the desperate
it will give us control of them
if we wanna rule more than one
small fucking town we have to have it
people will come from all over
theyll do exactly what i tell them
if the words are from the book
its happened before
and itll happen again
all we need is that book
then i want solara
are you bargaining with me
is this a deal were making here
we lost a lot of men
you need me more than ever
now you say that books worth the trouble
well i believe you
but i want solara for it
why not why not
lets get the fuck out of here
stay on the path its not your concern
stay on the path its not your concern

the lord is my shepherd
i shall not want
he makes me to lie down in green pastures
leads me beside the still waters
he restores my soul
he leadeth me in the path of righteousness
for his names sake
yea though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
i will fear no evil for thou art with me
subtitles by chetan
thats beautiful
you like that
did you write that
yes i did
really
no no no
no that was around a long time
before you and i got here thats for sure
what did you mean
when you said its not just any book
its the only one
really
after the war people made it their business
to find and destroy
any that the fires didnt get already
some people said this was the reason
for the war in the first place
anyway its the only one that survived
howd you get it
they said that the war
tore a hole in the sky
youve probably heard the stories
yeah
tore a hole in the sky sun came down
and burned everything
everything and everybody
you were lucky to hole up and hide
in a place like this or underground
most people werent lucky
so a year later we started coming out
and people wandered around
i not knowing what i was gonna do
trying to find a place to survive
one day i heard a voice
its hard to explain but it was like it
like it was coming from inside of me
but i could hear it
as clear as i can hear you talking to me now
what did this voice say
it led me
to a place where i found the book
buried under some rubble
the voice told me
to carry the book out west
told me that a path would be laid out for me
that id be led to a place
where the book was safe
told me that id be protected
against anyone or anything
that stood in my path
ive been walking ever since
and you did all that
because a voice in your head told you to
yes i did
i know what i heard
i know what i hear
i know im not crazy
and i know i wouldve never made it
without help
whats that
one question too many
go to bed
we got an early start in the morning

for 30 years right

have you ever thought
that maybe you were lost
nope
well how do you know
that youre walking in the right direction
we walk by faith not by sight
what does that mean
it means that you know something
even if you dont know something
that doesnt make any sense
doesnt have to make sense its faith
its faith
its the flower of light
in the field of darkness
thats giving me the strength to carry on
you understand
