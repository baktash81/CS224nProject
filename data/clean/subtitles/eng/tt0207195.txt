i just gotta get
seth away from this
this dancer
dancer
its a long story but ill be there soon
save me some mac and cheese

no no way
seth
one second
hang on a second listen
i am really connecting with this girl
she just moved here with her sister from
uzbekistan theyre saving for a condo
nice that hits here
now she does have a serious boyfriend
but shes looking into
good luck with the condo
some dude just demod
a range rover
that cars messed up
this happened in the parking lot
of the imax theater
shark movies bring out
a rough crowd
ill call the insurance company but
youre explaining this to your mother
it could get ugly
yeah
so did you call marissa
i tried her again this morning
she doesnt wanna talk
im sorry i salted your game man
i gotta get to work
ill give you richards number
when we get back hes the best
he did carols divorce
she got everything
thanks thatd be great
youre really considering a divorce
why are you gonna tell jimmy
julie needs to protect herself
i cant believe youre encouraging this
when your husband had an affair
no one gave you
a divorce attorneys number
kirsten that was very uncalledfor
whats uncalledfor is your
500aday coke habit in college
it was just sophomore year
what jimmy did was wrong
spare me you have a guatemalan family
cleaning your house
for less than minimum wage
i have spent this entire weekend
listening to you women judge jimmy
yes he made a big mistake but life is
complicated and none of us is perfect
not even you julie
and what is that supposed to mean
he didnt buy ponies and jewelry
for himself
how interesting that you
should take his side
shower time limo leaves at 6
he did this to give you everything
and now youre just gonna leave him
he lied to me kirsten
you lied to yourself i know jimmy
i know ive heard he still has
your prom photo up on our wall
its all in the past
really
you think its a coincidence that we
ended up living next door to you
im the one who married him
this is my problem not yours
who knew that
when he knocked me up
itd be the best thing
that ever happened to you
hey
hey
your dad let me in
seems like hes doing better
yeah i guess
do you need to get that
its probably just summer calling
about another party at hollys
yes another one of those
so howd it go with the dancer
actually
thats what i wanted to talk about
last night was totally my fault
okay ryan was extremely bummed he
didnt get to make his blockbuster night
i know youre going through a lot
and you didnt need to get stood up
so i apologize
wow thats very
thoughtful
well hes pretty mad at me right now
why dont you help me out
how about another date
hes a good cook
i tell you one good swing
and i love this game
nice drive
so i talked to my friend
the securities attorney this morning
working on the weekend
working for you to keep you out of jail
hes pretty sure he can make it happen
excellent
its contingent upon you
making full restitution
youll lose your license and never be
allowed near an investment account
but little or no jail time
so i gotta pay back everything i lost
and even then there are no guarantees
but its your only option
well thats not an option i mean where
the hell am i gonna find 4 million
your house is valued at 32 you got
26 in equity thats a good start
you want me to sell my house
julie will
shell leave me
julie cares about you and the kids
she wont care about losing the house
if it means keeping you
whose wife are we talking about
no we gotta come up
with something else
this is it this is a gift be grateful
grateful
did you think it would just go away
that there would be no consequences
get real
who are you to tell me to get real
you live in a fantasy land
your wife is rich you live in
a house youve never paid for
you get fired
kirsten wouldnt even notice it
you have no idea what
its like to provide for a family
i think theres more to providing
for a family than money
wanna be there when marissa graduates
you wanna watch kaitlin grow up
you can start over
you can start a new life
i dont want a new life
i want my old one back
but i guess
thats not gonna happen huh
hey
whats up
seth cohen your friendly
neighborhood pimp at your service
i talked with marissa
its totally handled
ill be right back with your drinks
what are you talking about
it turns out that im skilled at getting
a date provided its not for me

be coming over and youll be cooking
whats up man
hey
