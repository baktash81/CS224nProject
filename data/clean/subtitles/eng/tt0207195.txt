i don t think she wants to talk 
  everything with her and her dad

with great authority here 
is that you really need
to be aggressive  okay 
her and luke broke up  you need to go

i ve masterminded this whole debacle 
honey  they re your friends 
please  they re the gatekeepers
of this entire community   
   a community your daughters and i
would like to remain a part of 
this is my chance to go before the firing
squad and plead for a stay of execution 
i was hoping to be able to talk
this weekend 
this is your mess  jimmy 
you clean it up 
and when i get back  we ll figure out
what the hell we re gonna tell our girls 
i m totally crispy 
let s go do something

we left things kind of up in the air 
  you haven t talked since cotillion 
  i haven t talked to anyone  except you

well  some people

not me 
i haven t played video games in  like

   if i didn t know better 
i d swear i was still 16 
hell  i m still 22 
it was the best year of my life 
  yeah  why 22 
  that s when i met kirsten 
  why 16 
  oh  that s when   
   i met kirsten 
  hello 
  marissa 
hey  where are you 
what d i tell you  man 
how much better is this than newport 
i got dragged to a party 
but i m leaving  i m on my way 
i just gotta get
seth away from this   
  this dancer 
  dancer 
it s a long story  but i ll be there soon 
  save me some mac and cheese 
  sure  see you 
  no  no way   
  seth 
one second 
hang on a second  listen 
i am really connecting with this girl 
she just moved here with her sister from
uzbekistan  they re saving for a condo 
nice  that hits here 
now  she does have a serious boyfriend 
but she s looking into   
good luck with the condo 
some dude just demo d
a range rover 
that car s messed up 
this happened in the parking lot
of the imax theater 
shark movies bring out
a rough crowd 
i ll call the insurance company  but
you re explaining this to your mother 
it could get ugly 
yeah 
so did you call marissa 
i tried her again this morning 
she doesn t wanna talk 
  i m sorry i salted your game  man 
  i gotta get to work 
i ll give you richard s number
when we get back  he s the best 
he did carol s divorce 
she got everything 
thanks  that d be great 
  you re really considering a divorce 
  why  are you gonna tell jimmy 
julie needs to protect herself 
i can t believe you re encouraging this 
when your husband had an affair   
   no one gave you
a divorce attorney s number 
kirsten  that was very uncalled for 
what s uncalled for is your
 500 a day coke habit in college 
  it was just sophomore year 
  what jimmy did was wrong 
spare me  you have a guatemalan family
cleaning your house   
   for less than minimum wage 
i have spent this entire weekend
listening to you women judge jimmy 
yes  he made a big mistake  but life is
complicated  and none of us is perfect 
  not even you  julie 
  and what is that supposed to mean 
he didn t buy ponies and jewelry
for himself 
how interesting that you
should take his side 
shower time  limo leaves at 6 
he did this to give you everything 
and now you re just gonna leave him 
he lied to me  kirsten 
you lied to yourself  i know jimmy 
i know  i ve heard  he still has
your prom photo up on our wall 
  it s all in the past 
  really 
you think it s a coincidence that we
ended up living next door to you 
i m the one who married him 
this is my problem  not yours 
who knew that
when he knocked me up   
   it d be the best thing
that ever happened to you 
  hey 
  hey 
your dad let me in 
seems like he s doing better 
yeah  i guess 
do you need to get that 
it s probably just summer calling
about another party at holly s 
yes  another one of those 
  so how d it go with the dancer 
  actually   
   that s what i wanted to talk about 
last night was totally my fault 
okay  ryan was extremely bummed he
didn t get to make his blockbuster night 
i know you re going through a lot 
and you didn t need to get stood up 
  so i apologize 
  wow  that s very   
   thoughtful 
  well  he s pretty mad at me right now 
why don t you help me out 
how about another date 
he s a good cook 
i tell you  one good swing   
   and i love this game 
nice drive 
so i talked to my friend 
the securities attorney  this morning 
working on the weekend 
working for you  to keep you out of jail 
  he s pretty sure he can make it happen 
  excellent 
it s contingent upon you
making full restitution 
you ll lose your license and never be
allowed near an investment account 
  but little or no jail time 
  so i gotta pay back everything i lost 
and even then  there are no guarantees 
but it s your only option 
well  that s not an option  i mean  where
the hell am i gonna find  4 million 
your house is valued at 3 2  you got
2 6 in equity  that s a good start 
you want me to sell my house 
julie will   
  she ll leave me 
  julie cares about you and the kids 
she won t care about losing the house 
if it means keeping you 
whose wife are we talking about 
no  we gotta come up
with something else 
this is it  this is a gift  be grateful 
  grateful 
  did you think it would just go away 
that there would be no consequences 
get real 
who are you to tell me to get real 
you live in a fantasy land 
your wife is rich  you live in
a house you ve never paid for 
you get fired 
kirsten wouldn t even notice it 
you have no idea what
it s like to provide for a family 
i think there s more to providing
for a family than money 
wanna be there when marissa graduates 
you wanna watch kaitlin grow up 
you can start over 
you can start a new life 
i don t want a new life 
i want my old one back 
but i guess
that s not gonna happen  huh 
  hey 
  what s up 
seth cohen  your friendly
neighborhood pimp  at your service 
i talked with marissa 
it s totally handled 
i ll be right back with your drinks 
what are you talking about 
it turns out that i m skilled at getting
a date  provided it s not for me 
you ll have the house to yourself  she ll
be coming over  and you ll be cooking 
  what s up  man 
  hey 
what s the agenda for tonight

no  it s not for me  it s gonna be
water polo guys and their girlfriends 
i don t get the whole
water polo thing down here 
nor do i  a bunch of dudes
who enjoy wearing speedos 
  what do they know about partying 
  i couldn t agree more 
but the girls are hot 
so with the right attitude
and a couple cocktails  it could be fun 
if it s not  we ll make it fun 
life is what you make it 
  that s very wise  donnie 
  tell you what  man 
here s what we ll do  we re gonna go 
i ll call a couple of my boys 
we ll drink their beer  dance with
their honeys and have a good time 
  all right

i don t have turf  but if i did  this would
be it  and summer will be there

i remember as a kid 
if i saw a limousine driving   
   i d always try to see
through the tinted window   
   wondering what kind of life
the people inside lived 
how glamorous and lucky 
who knew  right 
you knew 
you were probably in there 
staring back at me 
which means i ve been
jealous of you since i was 8 
when i met jimmy  i had nothing 
no money 
i don t wanna go back
to being nothing again 
you won t 
you have a family  you have jimmy 
he loves you 
not as much as he loved you 
but i knew that when i married him 
i was winning the lottery 
great guy  great life 
and he was doing the honorable thing

   you ve got a decision to make 
what is it  jimmy 
we can liquidate our assets 
sell the house   
   and start all over with nothing
as a family 
or we can declare bankruptcy   
   keep the house
