belonging to secretary of
commerce christopher bailey
as he was leaving the
secretarys long island estate
mr lister who was
killed instantly in
the blast was scheduled
to testify
in washington on thursday
before a senate committee
a committee investigating what has
come to be called
the bailey scandal
a special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case
as for secretary
bailey he was not
available for any
statement at this time
did you know those guys
offices of his longtime legal
advisor irving gold
in hopes of getting some comment
mr gold youre aware that
district attorney lister
is the second witness
in the bailey
scandal to meet a
sudden and violent end
the first was thomas finney
undersecretary of commerce
who fell to his death from his
15thfloor office
just a month ago
do you think theres a connection
take the money and run noodles
what the hells keeping you here
the only remaining witness
is the man who
rightly or wrongly
has given his name
to this whole affair
secretary bailey
im curious
what does the secretary think
the secretary has no worries
sir if he has no
worries why then has
he retreated to his
place on long island
far from retreating
hes busy preparing
his attack on the questions
he will be asked by the committee
id call them accusations
more than questions sir
the secretary has no worries
but the public does
particularly in
view of the rumours
about rigged contracts bribery
the international
mafia especially
those dealing with
the illegal use
of the transport
union pension funds
could you tell us
anything about that

of these rumours
and allegations against
my organisation

will continue to remain clean
in my entire life
ive fought to keep
the american labour
movement clear

forced speculation
criminal elements
or corrupt politicians if any
mistakes have been made
hes still giving out
the same old bullshit
if any guilt at all exists in this
situation it lies elsewhere

about you in the newspapers
inflammatory words
from a union boss
you still arent gonna stop the
workers or the social movement

good fart about the
socialist workers and

hes gonna do it
with or without you
noodles weve never
liked each other
we put up with each
other for maxs sake
so why dont we just
get together once

and after that
we can go back to being enemies

i got the idea from
your friend max

makes fun of you
he says eve has got
you by the balls
every time you walk past this
place you shit in your pants
youd do anything for
the cops to pick you
up so you wouldnt
have to do this job
is that true huh
well then do it
do it put him in jail put
him in jail not long
just long enough so he can get
the idea out of his mind
if you cant stand being away
from him put yourself there too
better off than being dead
you know what to do
and if you dont i will
get out take a cab

patron saint of the place
and some actress

curled antony

which is my heaven to have
come thou mortal wretch
with thy sharp teeth this knot
intrinsicate of
life at once untie
poor venomous fool
be angry and dispatch
o couldst thou speak
that i might hear thee call
great caesar ass unpolicied
o eastern star
peace peace
dost thou not see my
baby at my breast
that sucks the nurse asleep
o break o break
as sweet as balm
as soft as air as gentle
o antony
nay i will take thee too
what should i stay
in this vile world
so fare thee well
now boast thee death in thy
possession lies a
lass unparalleld
downy windows close
and golden phoebus never be
beheld of eyes again so royal
your crowns awry ill
mend it and then play
hello deborah
arent you gonna say anything
what is someone supposed
to say after
more than 30 years
well how about how you
doing youre looking good
or i was hoping id
never see you again
i never thought i would
theres a difference
yeah at least you recognise
me thats something
actresses have good memories
you want a drink
im having one
margo
yes miss
thats all for now you can go
all right miss
she called you miss
you never got married
no
you live alone
no
where were you
i was out of town
have you been back long
a couple of days
are you staying
that depends
why do you want to see me
two reasons
first i wanted to see if
you did the right thing
turning me down to
become an actress
well
you did youre terrific
age cannot wither her
its like the play
was written for you
what was the other reason
the other reason
is to decide whether i should
go to a party tomorrow night
a party
yeah on long island
a secretary bailey
do you know secretary bailey
no
but i was invited anyway
but if you dont know each
other why were you invited
i dont know
i thought you might know why
me
why me
because you know him
who is it
david
no david
can i come in
no no no just wait outside
david ill call you
okay ill be right here
what does secretary
bailey want from me
you came here to ask me that
why did he send me an invitation
i dont know i dont know
why should why
should i know about your
invitations i dont
know anything i
what do you want
from me why did you
come here i know
nothing nothing
now youre a lousy actress
who is secretary bailey
secretary bailey is
a rich businessman
he came to the united
states as a starving
immigrant and made
a lot of money
in san francisco and los angeles
where hes lived for 30 years
i know all that its all in the
papers what else is there
he married a very wealthy woman
they had a child
she died when the child was born
a few years ago he went
into politics moved here
thats all past history
im not talking
about that im talking about now
right now hes in trouble
why cant you just
tell me youve been
living with him all these years
and that youre his lover
age can wither me noodles
were both getting old
all that we have left
now are our memories
if you go to that
party on saturday
night you wont
have those any more
tear up that invitation
theres an exit back this way
noodles go through it
keep walking
dont turn around
please noodles
im begging you please
are you afraid that ill
turn into a pillar of salt
if you go out that door yes
this is secretary baileys son
his names david just like yours
i must admit this party was a
wonderful idea mr secretary
its a bit like
saying im going up
before the committee
in five days
but my conscience is clear
the most important people
in new york are my guests
its going to be a
night to remember
especially if the house blows up
where are you putting
the next bomb
in the freezer
or in the toilet
you cant even think
straight any more
ill tell you something
theres a waiting
list of people whod
like to send flowers
to your funeral
i can point out 10 of them right
now if youd like me to
yes
but none of them wants
to read my obituary
in front of the committee
as much as you do
you and your union
we just wanna resolve this
situation clean and legal
ive heard that same song from
you for 35 fucking years
who do you think
youre talking to
i helped you to
make a fortune you
and the rest of those parasites
it was a reasonable arrangement
between labour and management
two percent for them and
40 percent for you
you defend them and you
screw them come on
its been the story of your life
think anybody believes
you any more
some
but no one believes
in you any more
because youve made
mistakes and i havent
but thats beside the point
the important thing
right now is that
you and i straighten out these
transfers of authority
now its all as weve agreed
ive had our lawyers draw it up
all you have to do is sign
my last will
youre in no position
to exercise your will
i give up everything
twelve percent will be
set aside for your boy
that way he can be assured
of living to a ripe old age
or not if i dont sign
why dont you take care
of this yourself max
id be very happy for
you tonight if
during all the noise of the
party i heard a shot
maybe you will
please go in
what are you waiting for
i dont understand mr bailey
sit down noodles
make yourself comfortable
im glad you accepted
my invitation
well i was curious
so many important
people in one place
yes well the rats usually
desert a sinking ship
but in my case they appear
to be flocking on board
yeah well i read about your
troubles in the newspapers
but a man in your
position with all
your power and all
your privileges
has to assume a certain
amount of responsibility
a certain amount of risk
whyd you ask me to
come here mr bailey
that invitation doesnt mean a
goddamn thing and you know it
all that counts is what
was in that suitcase
the money and the contract
it didnt say who the
contract was on though
havent you figured that out yet
you mr bailey
i havent had a gun in my
hand for many many years
my eyes arent too good even
with my glasses my hands shake
and i wouldnt wanna
miss mr bailey
cut the bullshit noodles
im already a dead man
at least give me the chance to
settle the debt that i owe to you
ill never make it before the
investigating committee
theyre scared to death ill
implicate the whole bunch of them
they gotta get rid of me
today is as good a day as any
you do it noodles
youre the only person
i can accept it from
you see i found out
where you were
i brought you back here for this
to even the score
between you and me
you can get out through there
it leads right down to the
street nobody will see you
i dont know what
youre talking about
mr bailey you dont
owe me a thing
your eyes were too
full of tears to see
it wasnt me burned
up on that street
it was somebody else
you were too shocked to realise
that the cops were in on it too
that was a syndicate
operation noodles
youre crazy
you said that to me once
before a long time ago
but my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment
i took away your
whole life from you
ive been living in your place
i took everything
i took your money
i took your girl
all i left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me
now why dont you shoot
its true i have killed
people mr bailey
sometimes to defend myself
sometimes for money
and many people
used to come to us
business partners rivals
lovers
some of the jobs we took
and some we didnt
yours is one we would
never touch mr bailey
is this your way of
getting revenge
no
its just the way i see things
its 1025
and ive got nothing left to lose
when youve been betrayed
by a friend you hit back
do it
you see mr secretary
i have a story also
a little simpler than yours
many years ago i had a
friend a dear friend
i turned him in to
save his life
but he was killed
but he wanted it that way
it was a great friendship
it went bad for him and
it went bad for me too
good night mr bailey
i hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing
itd be a shame to see a
lifetime of work go to waste
god bless america
land that i love
stand beside her and guide her
through the night with
a light from above
from the mountains
to the prairies
to the oceans white with foam
god bless america
my home sweet home
