district attorney james lister was
killed in an explosion of a car   
belonging to secretary of
commerce christopher bailey   
as he was leaving the
secretary s long island estate 
mr  lister  who was
killed instantly in
the blast  was scheduled
to testify   
in washington on thursday
before a senate committee 
a committee investigating what has
come to be called
the bailey scandal 
a special team of detectives
has been assigned to the case 
as for secretary
bailey  he was not
available for any
statement at this time 
did you know those guys 
offices of his long time legal
advisor  irving gold   
in hopes of getting some comment 
mr  gold  you re aware that
district attorney lister   
is the second witness
in the bailey
scandal to meet a
sudden and violent end 
the first was thomas finney 
undersecretary of commerce   
who fell to his death from his
15th floor office
just a month ago 
do you think there s a connection 
take the money and run  noodles 
what the hell s keeping you here 
the only remaining witness
is the man who   
rightly or wrongly
has given his name
to this whole affair 
secretary bailey 
  i m curious 
  what does the secretary think 
the secretary has no worries 
sir  if he has no
worries  why then has
he retreated to his
place on long island 
far from retreating 
he s busy preparing
his attack on the questions   
he will be asked by the committee 
i d call them accusations
more than questions  sir 
  the secretary has no worries 
  but the public does 
particularly in
view of the rumours
about rigged contracts  bribery   
the international
mafia  especially
those dealing with
the illegal use   
of the transport
union pension funds 
could you tell us
anything about that 
gentlemen  i deny all
of these rumours
and allegations against
my organisation 
our hands have always been and
will continue to remain clean 
in my entire life 
i ve fought to keep
the american labour
movement clear   
him  i know 
forced speculation 
criminal elements   
or corrupt politicians  if any
mistakes have been made   
he s still giving out
the same old bullshit 
if any guilt at all exists in this
situation  it lies elsewhere 
what s this i ve been reading
about you in the newspapers 
inflammatory words
from a union boss 
you still aren t gonna stop the
workers or the social movement 
listen to me  you
socialist asshole 
we don t give a
good fart about the
socialist workers and
their movements 
we just want you out
of the factory so
we can get the furnaces
working again 
this is the last offer
you re gonna get 
you want to sign it or what 
tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it 
fill her up 
this is my last   
hold it  boys  don t shoot 
it s me  crowning 
  crowning

politician friends of yours

liquor and prostitution and dope

to the idea  pal 
this country is still growing up 
certain diseases it s better to
have when you re still young 
you boys ain t a mild case of
the measles  you re the plague 
and bastards like him are immune 
that s the difference
between us and them 
take it easy 
the difference is that
they re always gonna win

you by the balls 
every time you walk past this

you d do anything for

have to do this job 
is that true  huh

do it  put him in jail  put
him in jail  not long 
just long enough so he can get
the idea out of his mind 
if you can t stand being away
from him  put yourself there too 
better off than being dead

max made fools of us 
noodles  he wanted to die 
did you know his old man
died in the nut house 
max didn t want to
end up the same way 
so he put the idea in our
heads to tip off the cops 
and when they stopped the truck 
max started shooting first   
just to get himself killed 
what is this 
opening night 
fifteen years ago 
who s this 
patron saint of the place 
and some actress 
do you know her 
no 
this proves me base 
if she first meet the
curled antony   
he ll make demand of her 
and spend that kiss   
which is my heaven to have 
come  thou mortal wretch 
with thy sharp teeth this knot
intrinsicate of
life at once untie 
poor venomous fool 
be angry  and dispatch 
o  couldst thou speak   
that i might hear thee call
great caesar ass unpolicied 
  o eastern star 
  peace  peace 
dost thou not see my
baby at my breast   
that sucks the nurse asleep 
o  break  o  break 
as sweet as balm   
as soft as air  as gentle   
o antony 
nay  i will take thee too 
what should i stay    
in this vile world 
so  fare thee well 
now boast thee  death  in thy
possession lies a
lass unparallel d 
downy windows  close   
and golden phoebus never be
beheld of eyes again so royal 
your crown s awry  i ll
mend it  and then play 
hello  deborah 
aren t you gonna say anything 
what is someone supposed
to say after   
more than 30 years 
well  how about   how you
doing  you re looking good  
or   i was hoping i d
never see you again  
i never thought i would 
there s a difference 
yeah  at least you recognise
me  that s something 
actresses have good memories 
you want a drink 
i m having one 
margo 
  yes  miss 
  that s all for now  you can go 
all right  miss 
she called you  miss  
you never got married 
no 
you live alone 
no 
where were you 
i was out of town 
have you been back long 
a couple of days 
are you staying 
that depends 
why do you want to see me 
two reasons 
first  i wanted to see if
you did the right thing   
turning me down to
become an actress 
well 
you did  you re terrific 
 age cannot wither her  
it s like the play
was written for you 
what was the other reason 
the other reason   
is to decide whether i should
go to a party tomorrow night 
a party 
yeah  on long island 
a secretary bailey 
do you know secretary bailey 
no 
but i was invited anyway 
but if you don t know each
other  why were you invited 
i don t know 
i thought you might know why 
me 
why me 
because you know him 
  who is it 
  david 
  no  david 
  can i come in 
no  no  no  just wait outside 
david  i ll call you 
okay  i ll be right here 
what does secretary
bailey want from me 
you came here to ask me that 
why did he send me an invitation 
i don t know  i don t know 
why should     why
should i know about your
invitations  i don t
know anything  i   
what do you want
from me  why did you
come here  i know
nothing  nothing 
now you re a lousy actress 
who is secretary bailey 
secretary bailey is
a rich businessman 
he came to the united
states as a starving
immigrant and made
a lot of money   
in san francisco and los angeles 
where he s lived for 30 years 
i know all that  it s all in the
papers  what else is there 
he married a very wealthy woman 
they had a child 
she died when the child was born 
a few years ago  he went
into politics  moved here 
that s all past history 
i m not talking
about that  i m talking about now 
right now he s in trouble 
why can t you just
tell me you ve been
living with him all these years   
and that you re his lover 
age can wither me  noodles 
we re both getting old 
all that we have left
now are our memories 
if you go to that
party on saturday
night  you won t
have those any more 
tear up that invitation 
there s an exit back this way 
noodles  go through it 
keep walking 
don t turn around 
please  noodles 
i m begging you  please 
are you afraid that i ll
turn into a pillar of salt 
if you go out that door  yes 
this is secretary bailey s son 
his name s david  just like yours 
i must admit  this party was a
wonderful idea  mr  secretary 
it s a bit like
saying   i m going up
before the committee
in five days   
but my conscience is clear 
the most important people
in new york are my guests  
it s going to be a
night to remember 
especially if the house blows up 
where are you putting
the next bomb 
in the freezer   
or in the toilet 
you can t even think
straight any more 
i ll tell you something 
there s a waiting
list of people who d
like to send flowers
to your funeral 
i can point out 10 of them right
now  if you d like me to 
yes 
but none of them wants
to read my obituary
in front of the committee
as much as you do 
you and your union 
we just wanna resolve this
situation  clean and legal 
i ve heard that same song from
you for 35 fucking years 
who do you think
you re talking to 
i helped you to
make a fortune  you
and the rest of those parasites 
it was a reasonable arrangement   
between labour and management 
two percent for them and
40 percent for you 
you defend them and you
screw them  come on 
it s been the story of your life 
think anybody believes
you any more 
some 
but no one believes
in you any more   
because you ve made
mistakes and i haven t 
but that s beside the point 
the important thing
right now is that   
you and i straighten out these
transfers of authority 
now  it s all as we ve agreed 
i ve had our lawyers draw it up 
all you have to do is sign 
my last will 
you re in no position
to exercise your will 
i give up everything 
twelve percent will be
set aside for your boy 
that way he can be assured   
of living to a ripe old age 
or not  if i don t sign  
why don t you take care
of this yourself  max 
i d be very happy for
you tonight if   
during all the noise of the
party  i heard a shot 
maybe you will 
please go in 
what are you waiting for 
i don t understand  mr  bailey 
sit down  noodles 
make yourself comfortable 
i m glad you accepted
my invitation 
well  i was curious 
so many important
people in one place 
yes  well  the rats usually
desert a sinking ship 
but in my case  they appear
to be flocking on board 
yeah  well  i read about your
troubles in the newspapers 
but a man in your
position  with all
your power and all
your privileges   
has to assume a certain
amount of responsibility   
a certain amount of risk 
why d you ask me to
come here  mr  bailey 
that invitation doesn t mean a
goddamn thing  and you know it 
all that counts is what
was in that suitcase 
the money and the contract 
it didn t say who the
contract was on  though 
haven t you figured that out yet 
you  mr  bailey 
i haven t had a gun in my
hand for many  many years 
my eyes aren t too good  even
with my glasses  my hands shake 
and i wouldn t wanna
miss  mr  bailey 
cut the bullshit  noodles 
i m already a dead man 
at least give me the chance to
settle the debt that i owe to you 
i ll never make it before the
investigating committee 
they re scared to death i ll
implicate the whole bunch of them 
they gotta get rid of me 
today is as good a day as any 
you do it  noodles 
you re the only person
i can accept it from 
you see  i found out
where you were 
i brought you back here for this 
to even the score
between you and me 
you can get out through there 
it leads right down to the
street  nobody will see you 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
mr  bailey  you don t
owe me a thing 
your eyes were too
full of tears to see
it wasn t me burned
up on that street 
it was somebody else 
you were too shocked to realise
that the cops were in on it too 
that was a syndicate
operation  noodles 
you re crazy 
you said that to me once
before  a long time ago 
but my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment 
i took away your
whole life from you 
i ve been living in your place 
i took everything 
i took your money 
i took your girl 
all i left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me 
now  why don t you shoot 
it s true  i have killed
people  mr  bailey 
sometimes to defend myself 
sometimes for money 
and many people
used to come to us 
business partners  rivals   
lovers 
some of the jobs we took
and some we didn t 
yours is one we would
never touch  mr  bailey 
is this your way of
getting revenge 
no 
it s just the way i see things 
it s 10 25   
and i ve got nothing left to lose 
when you ve been betrayed
by a friend  you hit back 
do it 
you see  mr  secretary   
i have a story also 
a little simpler than yours 
many years ago i had a
friend  a dear friend 
i turned him in to
save his life   
but he was killed 
but he wanted it that way 
it was a great friendship 
it went bad for him and
it went bad for me too 
good night  mr  bailey 
i hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing 
it d be a shame to see a
lifetime of work go to waste 
  god bless america  
  land that i love  
  stand beside her and guide her  
  through the night with
a light from above  
  from the mountains
to the prairies  
  to the oceans white with foam  
  god bless america  
  my home sweet home
