so its kind of hard for me
to work in the day
then what exactly do you want
would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me

why lll tell you why
yeah
i think youre a lonely person
i drive by a lot and i see you here
i see a lot of people around you
and l see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk
that means nothing
and when i came inside and met you
l saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself
that youre not a happy person
and l think you need something
and if you wanna call it a friend
you can call it a friend
youre gonna be my friend
yeah

travis
i appreciate this betsy
may 26th 400 pm
i took betsy to charles coffee shop
on columbus circle
i had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese
i think that was a good selection
betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish
she couldve had
anything she wanted
fifteen thousand volunteers
in new york alones not bad
but the organizational problems
yeah l know what you mean
i got the same problems
i gotta get organized little things
like my apartment my possessions
i should get one of those signs one
of these days lll get organizized
you mean organized
organizized
organizized its a joke
organeziezd
you mean organizize like those
little signs in offices that say thimk
do you like where you work
weve got some good people and
i think palantines got a good chance
you know you have beautiful eyes
do you like the guy you work with
hes okay
yeah l know
but do you like him
hes funny good at his job hes okay
though he does have a few problems
i would say
he has quite a few problems
his energy seems to go
in the wrong places
when i walked in and i saw
you two sitting there
l could just tell
that there was no connection
whatsoever
and l felt when i walked in
there was something between us
there was an impulse
that we were both following
so that gave me the right
to talk to you
otherwise l never wouldve felt
that i had the right to talk to you
i never wouldve had
the courage to talk to you
and with him
i felt there was nothing
when i walked in i knew l was right
did you feel that way
i wouldnt be here if i didnt
where are you from
upstate
that fellow l dont like him
not that l dont like him
i just think hes silly
i dont think he respects you
i dont believe lve ever met
anyone quite like you
you wanna go to
a movie with me
l have to go back to work now
l dont mean now another time
sure
you know what you remind me of
what
that song
by kris kristofferson
whos that
the songwriter
hes a prophet
hes a prophet and a pusher
partly truth partly fiction
a walking contradiction
you saying that about me
who else would l be talking about
im no pusher
ive never pushed
no just the part
about the contradictions
you are that
i called betsy again at her office
she said maybe wed go to a movie
after work tomorrow
thats my day off
at first she hesitated
but i called her again and she agreed
betsy betsy oh no
betsy what
i forgot to ask her last name
damn l gotta remember
stuff like that
dont worry about anyone
committing themselves
until things start coming in
from california
listen l think we shouldve
waited for the limo
i dont mind the cab
but i mind
going to california without the right
preparation thatll get us in trouble
are you charles palantine
the candidate
yes l am
im a big supporter
i tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you
why thank you
travis
im sure youll win
everybody l knows gonna vote for you
i was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi
but the company said
it was against their policy
theyre a bunch ofjerks
let me tell you l have learned
more about america
from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country
oh yeah

what is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most
well l dont know i dont follow
political issues that closely sir
oh well there must be something
well whatever it is he should
clean up this city here

whatever ever becomes the president
should just
really clean it up
know what l mean
sometimes i go out and i smell it
i get headaches its so bad
and they just like they just
never go away you know

i have a better chance of winning
its academic though hes not
gonna win the primary i am
i see
well one more thing
id like to ask you
how do you feel
your campaign is going
when we came up with our slogan
we are the people
when l said
let the people rule
l felt l was being
somewhat overly optimistic
i must tell you that l am more
optimistic now than ever before
the people are rising to the demands
that l have made on them
the people are beginning to rule
i feel it is a groundswell
i know
it will continue
through the primary and in miami
and l know it will rise
to an unprecedented swell
in november
that bitch goddamn
ill blow her brains out
ill kill her goddamn it lm gonna
get my hands on her ill kill her

a long continuous chain
and then suddenly
there is change
travis this heres easy andy
hes a travelling salesman
how you doing travis
you got a 44 magnum
lts an expensive weapon
thats all right i got money
its a real monster
stop a car at 1 00 yards put a round
right through the engine block
here you go
its a premium highresale weapon
look at that
look at that thats a beauty
i could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in harlem for 500
but l just deal highquality goods
to the right people
how about that
this might be a little too big
for practical purposes
in which case
for you ld recommend
38 snubnosed
look at this
look at that
thats a beautiful little gun
its nickelplated with a snubnose
otherwise the same
as a service revolver
thatll stop anything that moves
the magnum they use that
in africa for killing elephants
that 38 thats a funny gun
some of these guns are like toys
that 38 you go out and
hammer nails with it all day
come back and itll cut
dead centre on target every time
its got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop
you interested in an automatic
its a colt 25 automatic
its a nice little gun
its a beautiful gun
holds six shots in the clip
one shot in the chamber
if youre dumb enough
to put a round there
here look at this
380 walther
holds eight shots in the clip
thats a nice gun
thats a beautiful little gun
look at that
during world war ii they used
this gun to replace the p 38
just given out to officers
aint that a little honey
how much for everything
all together
well only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that
heres a beautiful handmade holster
i had made in mexico
forty dollars
threefifty for the magnum
250 for the 38
one and a quarter for the 25
1 50 for the 380
you take this and wait here

into unemployment and inflation

suffer for the few
now l would lie to you if l told you

dear mr bickle
i cant say how happy
mrs steensma and l were
to hear that you are
well and recuperating
we tried to visit you at the hospital
when we were in new york
to pick up lris
but you were still in a coma
there is no way we can repay you
for returning our lris to us
we thought we had lost her
and now our lives are full again
needless to say
you are something
of a hero around this household
im sure you want to know about lris
shes back in school and working hard
the transition has been
very hard for her
as you can well imagine
but we have taken steps to see
she has never cause
to run away again
in conclusion
mrs steensma and l
would like to again thank you
from the bottom of our hearts
unfortunately we cannot afford
to come to new york again
to thank you in person
or we surely would
but if you should ever
come to pittsburgh
you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home
our deepest thanks
