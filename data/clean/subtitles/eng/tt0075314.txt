beautiful woman i have ever seen

palantine  the man you re volunteering
to help elect president

i don t know what his policies are 
but i m sure he ll make a good one 
 you wanna canvass

how do you feel about
the senator s stand on welfare 
i don t really know his stand on
welfare  but l m sure it s a good stand 
 you re sure of that 
 yeah 
we all work together here 
day and night   
   so l m sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there 
the thing is  l drive a taxi at night 
so it s kind of hard for me   
   to work in the day 
then what exactly do you want 
would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me 
why 
 why  l ll tell you why 
 yeah 
i think you re a lonely person 
i drive by a lot  and i see you here 
i see a lot of people around you   
   and l see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk   
   that means nothing 
and when i came inside and met you   
   l saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself   
   that you re not a happy person 
and l think you need something 
and if you wanna call it a friend 
you can call it a friend 
 you re gonna be my friend 
 yeah 
what do you say 
it s a little hard standing here
and asking you  so    
five minutes  that s all 
just outside  right around here 
i m there to protect you 
come on  just take a little break 
i have a break at 4 00

 all right  4 p m 
 right 
 outside in the front 
 yes 
okay 
oh  my name is travis  betsy 
travis 
i appreciate this  betsy 
may 26th  4 00 p m 
i took betsy to charles  coffee shop
on columbus circle 
i had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese 
i think that was a good selection 
betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish 
she could ve had
anything she wanted 
fifteen thousand volunteers
in new york alone s not bad 
but the organizational problems 
yeah  l know what you mean 
i got the same problems 
i gotta get organized  little things 
like my apartment  my possessions 
i should get one of those signs   one
of these days  l ll get organiz ized  
you mean  organized  
organiz ized 
organiz ized  it s a joke 
o r g a n e z i e z d 
you mean  organiz ize   like those
little signs in offices that say   thimk  
do you like where you work 
we ve got some good people  and
i think palantine s got a good chance 
you know you have beautiful eyes 
do you like the guy you work with 
he s okay 
yeah  l know 
but do you like him 
he s funny  good at his job  he s okay 
though he does have a few problems 
i would say
he has quite a few problems 
his energy seems to go
in the wrong places 
when i walked in and i saw
you two sitting there   
   l could just tell
that there was no connection   
   whatsoever 
and l felt when i walked in 
there was something between us 
there was an impulse
that we were both following 
so that gave me the right
to talk to you 
otherwise  l never would ve felt
that i had the right to talk to you 
i never would ve had
the courage to talk to you 
and with him 
i felt there was nothing 
when i walked in  i knew l was right 
did you feel that way 
i wouldn t be here if i didn t 
where are you from 
upstate 
that fellow  l don t like him 
not that l don t like him 
i just think he s silly 
i don t think he respects you 
i don t believe l ve ever met
anyone quite like you 
you wanna go to   
   a movie with me 
 l have to go back to work now 
 l don t mean now  another time 
sure 
you know what you remind me of 
 what 
 that song   
   by kris kristofferson 
 who s that 
 the songwriter 
 he s a prophet    
he s a prophet and a pusher   
   partly truth  partly fiction 
a walking contradiction  
you saying that about me 
who else would l be talking about 
i m no pusher 
i ve never pushed 
no  just the part
about the contradictions 
you are that 
i called betsy again at her office 
she said maybe we d go to a movie   
   after work tomorrow 
that s my day off 
at first she hesitated 
but i called her again and she agreed 
betsy  betsy  oh  no 
betsy what 
i forgot to ask her last name 
damn  l gotta remember
stuff like that 
don t worry about anyone
committing themselves   
   until things start coming in
from california 
listen  l think we should ve
waited for the limo 
i don t mind the cab 
but i mind   
   going to california without the right
preparation  that ll get us in trouble 
are you charles palantine 
the candidate 
yes  l am 
i m a big supporter 
i tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you

   travis 
i m sure you ll win 
everybody l know s gonna vote for you 
i was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi   
   but the company said
it was against their policy 
they re a bunch ofjerks 
let me tell you  l have learned
more about america   
   from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country 
 oh  yeah 
 that s true 
 can l ask you something  travis 
 sure 
what is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most 
well  l don t know  i don t follow
political issues that closely  sir 
oh  well  there must be something 
well  whatever it is  he should
clean up this city here   
   because this city here s like an
open sewer  lt s full of filth and scum 
sometimes i can hardly take it 
whatever ever becomes the president
should just   
   really clean it up 
know what l mean 
sometimes i go out and i smell it 
i get headaches  it s so bad 
and they just like   they just
never go away  you know 
i think that the president
should just   
   clean up this mess  he should
flush it right down the fucking toilet 
well  l think l know
what you mean  travis 
but it s not gonna be easy 
 we ll have to make radical changes 
 damn straight

go out and get laid 
get drunk  you know  do anything 
you got no choice  anyway 
i mean  we re all fucked 
more or less  you know 
i don t know  that s about
the dumbest thing l ever heard 
it s not bertrand russell 
but what do you want  i m a cabbie 
what do i know 
i don t even know what the fuck
you re talking about 
maybe i don t know either 
don t worry so much  relax 
killer  you re gonna be all right

you re all right 
what do you think of your opponent s
chances in the upcoming primary 
mr  goodman is a fine man 
i would certainly 
if it came to it  prefer him   
   to our opponent
in the other party 
i think that my programmes
are better defined than his 
they re more imaginative 
i have a better chance of winning 
it s academic  though  he s not
gonna win the primary  i am 
i see 
well  one more thing
i d like to ask you 
how do you feel
your campaign is going 
when we came up with our slogan
 we are the people    
   when l said
 let the people rule    
   l felt l was being
somewhat overly optimistic 
i must tell you that l am more
optimistic now than ever before 
the people are rising to the demands
that l have made on them 
the people are beginning to rule 
i feel it is a groundswell 
i know   
   it will continue
through the primary and in miami 
and l know it will rise   
   to an unprecedented swell
in november 
that bitch  goddamn 
i ll blow her brains out 
i ll kill her  goddamn it  l m gonna
get my hands on her  i ll kill her 
shoot  goddamn it  fucker 
i swear if i get my hands on her 
i ll kill that fucking bitch 
 hey  sport 
 hey  sport

 that guy keeps following us 
 don t look at him 
hey  guys 
 you wanna take a walk 
 yeah 
loneliness has followed me
my whole life  everywhere 
in bars  in cars   
   sidewalks  stores  everywhere 
there s no escape 
i m god s lonely man 
june 8th 
my life has taken another turn again 
the days move along
with regularity  over and over   
   one day indistinguishable
from the next 
a long  continuous chain 
and then suddenly   
   there is change 
travis  this here s easy andy 
he s a travelling salesman 
how you doing  travis 
 you got a  44 magnum 
 lt s an expensive weapon 
that s all right  i got money 
it s a real monster 
stop a car at 1 00 yards  put a round
right through the engine block 
here you go 
it s a premium  high resale weapon 
look at that 
look at that  that s a beauty 
i could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in harlem for  500 
but l just deal high quality goods
to the right people 
how about that 
this might be a little too big
for practical purposes 
in which case 
for you  l d recommend   
   38 snub nosed 
look at this 
look at that 
that s a beautiful little gun 
it s nickel plated with a snub nose   
   otherwise the same
as a service revolver 
that ll stop anything that moves 
the magnum  they use that
in africa for killing elephants 
that  38  that s a funny gun 
some of these guns are like toys 
that  38  you go out and
hammer nails with it all day   
   come back and it ll cut
dead centre on target every time 
it s got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop 
you interested in an automatic 
it s a colt  25 automatic 
it s a nice little gun 
it s a beautiful gun 
holds six shots in the clip 
one shot in the chamber 
if you re dumb enough
to put a round there 
here  look at this 
 380 walther 
holds eight shots in the clip 
that s a nice gun 
that s a beautiful little gun 
look at that 
during world war ii  they used
this gun to replace the p 38 
just given out to officers 
ain t that a little honey 
 how much for everything 
 all together 
well  only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that 
here s a beautiful handmade holster
i had made in mexico 
forty dollars 
three fifty for the magnum 
250 for the  38   
   one and a quarter for the  25 
1 50 for the  380 
you take this and wait here 
i ll walk down with you 
how about dope  grass 
hash  coke 
mescaline  downers  nembutal 
tuinal  chloral hydrates 
 how about uppers  amphetamines 
 no  i m not interested in that stuff 
i can get you crystal meth 
nitrous oxide 
how about a cadillac 
a brand new cadillac   
   with the pink slip  two grand 
june 29th

dear mr  bickle 
i can t say how happy
mrs  steensma and l were   
   to hear that you are
well and recuperating 
we tried to visit you at the hospital   
   when we were in new york
to pick up lris   
   but you were still in a coma 
there is no way we can repay you   
   for returning our lris to us 
we thought we had lost her   
   and now our lives are full again 
needless to say   
   you are something
of a hero around this household 
i m sure you want to know about lris 
she s back in school and working hard 
the transition has been
very hard for her   
   as you can well imagine 
but we have taken steps to see   
   she has never cause
to run away again 
in conclusion   
   mrs  steensma and l
would like to again thank you   
   from the bottom of our hearts 
unfortunately  we cannot afford
to come to new york again   
   to thank you in person 
or we surely would 
but if you should ever
come to pittsburgh   
   you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home 
our deepest thanks
