jack walters will be having that
exclusive interview with billy martin 
and you know that could be fireworks 
the best bet for you folks
coming in from jersey 
do whatever you got to do
to use the holland
rather than the lincoln tunnel 
the backup there  at the lincoln 
is already a nightmare 
looking forward to some bright blue
skies all day today  with sunshine
and the highs this afternoon
somewhere in the upper 50s 
especially in the city 
it could get up near 60 
enjoy it while you can  my friend 
old man winter is going to be blowing
on your neck any day now 
lows tonight in the upper 30s
with frost in some of the usually
colder regions upstate 
you re listening to willie craig
on prm fm 93 
and if your clock radio
is set to go off at 7 18

everybody knows that when you invent
or discover something 
you get to name it  like    a napoleon 
  a what

it was named after napoleon 
napoleon invented pastry 
i thought he was a general 
well  you can t fight battles

that s her surprise 
how do you feel about seeing her 
well  i feel   
i should want to see her 
it s been six months
since we ve been down there 
but    she ll just ruin my birthday 
and it s my day  not hers 
well  now  think 
what are our options 
i could make up an excuse
and tell her not to come 
no  i can t do that 
and let s not forget 
it s supposed to be a surprise 
anyway  it s not her 
it s just   
i don t feel up to it 
or her or anything 
how are things going with mike 
  fine 
  good 
no  they re not fine 
what a dumb word that is 
he gave me one of his wham bang
specials this morning 
and i m mad at him 
isn t that right  shouldn t i be mad 
yeah  did you tell him 
  what 
  that you were mad at him 
of course not 
i moaned with pleasure at his touch 
isn t that what every man wants 
i don t know  is it 
don t start that stuff with me 
don t you think you d feel better
if you snapped at mike instead of me 
think about where your anger is going 
i m sorry 
stop apologizing
and tell mike he makes you mad 
tell him he stinks in bed 
does he 
  yes 
  then tell him 
maybe there s something wrong with me 
there s nothing wrong with you 
do you find me attractive 
of course 
would you want to sleep with me 
yes 
then why don t you 
because i love my wife

jeopardizing my marriage

i m dr  elliott  your mother s doctor 
why do you have to be here 
i made mike bring me 
he s identifying the   
my mom wouldn t be dead
if i had gone with her 
you shouldn t feel responsible
for your mother s death 
if you talk about it 
i might be able to help 
do you know who killed her 
  no 
  then you can t help  can you 
not now maybe 
but later  if you want someone
to talk to about all this 
  ask your father to call   
  no  he s not my father 
my father was killed in vietnam 
take this 
you can call me any time 
i m always there all day long 
i m usually there   
ok  doctor  let s talk in here 
call me 
she was picked up by lockman
at the museum 
she spent the afternoon at his place
and was chopped up in the elevator
on the way out 
that girl out there saw the murderer 
that s terrible 
  do you know who it is 
  some broad 
  a woman 
  yeah 
miss blake didn t get
a great look at her face
because she had on these big sunglasses 
is there anything i can do to help 
yeah  when you spoke with mrs  miller   
did she say
she was going to meet anybody 
no 
did she leave your office
with anybody 
no 
what was she seeing you for 
nothing too serious  she had
some problems with her marriage 
and i was helping her work them out 
what kind of problems 
are you married  detective marino 
  yeah 
  children 
two sons 
when was the last time
you had intercourse with your wife 
now what the fuck is it to you 
that s exactly how i feel about
your questions concerning mrs  miller 
hey  look  doctor 
we got a brutally murdered woman here 
who passed the point
of being embarrassed
by anything you might tell me 
i guess you re right 
i m sorry 
but i m not used to discussing
a patient s case with outsiders 
i m not an outsider  i m a cop 
now  let s make it easy for you 
was she looking to get killed 
  you mean  was she suicidal 
  yeah 
  no 
  no 
so why did she pick up
this lockman character 
  he could ve been a killer 
  but he wasn t 
yeah  but the next guy might have been 
you know  if at first you don t succeed 
do you think she wanted to get killed 
don t you  look 
we got some hot pants broad
cruising around for some action 
the guy she picked up went down on her
in a cab  for christ s sake 
i got a blow by blow description
from the cabby 
after she finishes with him 
she comes on to some weirdo
in the elevator 
hey  there s all kinds of ways
to get killed in this city 
if you re looking for it 
well    yes  she did have a problem
about her sexual worth 
and this morning she asked me
if i was attracted to her 
yeah  but you re not a psycho 
you do know something  though 
don t you  doc 
yes  of course 
i do some work at bellevue 
could she have met one of these nuts
at your office 
i mean  some kind of weirdo she could ve
turned on that might have followed her 
the term we use  detective marino 
is not  weirdo  
but a person
suffering from emotional dysfunction
and a problem of maladaption 
and they never come to my office 
are you sure 
how about a new patient 
i mean  how do you know
how nuts they are until you see them 
that s possible 
but it s hardly likely   
doctor 
you re not protecting
one of your patients now  are you 
absolutely not 
well  doc 
you ve got to look at it my way 
see  we got no leads 
except a witness out there
who maybe should take a look
at all your patients
that were around that morning 
and that way  i can be absolutely sure
that my weirdo isn t your
 person suffering
from emotional dysfunctions
and problems of maladaption  
peter  come on  let s go home 
excuse me 
ok  doctor 
i m sorry you re not more cooperative 
which means that
i m just going to have to waste some
time in getting a court order
to check out your appointment book 
i m sorry  too 
but i feel i must protect
the confidentiality of my patients 
of course  we re just two professionals
doing our job 
it s too bad we can t work together 
come on 
thank you very much for your help 
i ll be in touch 
yes  thank you for waiting 
this is the answering service 
  would you care to leave a message 
  yes  i would 
  this is dr  elliott 
  how do you spell that 
e l l i o t t 
what is the message 
would you please say
that i would very much like to see her 
and could she call me at my office 
so  miss blake

at 93 nassau street 
that s right 
tell me  how did you happen to be
in that building
that mrs  miller was killed in 
i was visiting a friend 
and who was that 
well    it s sort of embarrassing 
i d really rather not say 
why

to sign this statement as to exactly
what he saw and when he saw it 
how the hell am i supposed to know
where he is

among other things 
and a foreign correspondent
in the middle east  and   
i did a lot of police reporting 
and i dove on spanish treasure wrecks 
you did a lot
of macho things  then 
this is very common among transsexuals 
you find   
when i speak of transsexuals 
i tend to speak of male to female
because there are a whole lot of more
of them than going the other way 
and an awful lot of them
have real macho backgrounds 
i know a police captain  a west pointer 
a couple of fighter pilots 
they all  you know 
most of them tried real hard 
you were married twice 
you are also the father
of three children 
so  you enjoyed a   
i don t want to say normal  i guess
that s a prejudicial way to put it 
but you enjoyed the traditional role
of father 
you fathered three children 
and you have engaged in
at least two heterosexual relationships 
more than that 
i ve always been a devout heterosexual

miss blake  i ve got some pictures

liz  i ve got some pictures
of that blonde
from a camera i hid
outside elliott s office 
now  we gotta get in  get elliott s
appointment book  and get her name 
that s what the police are for 
come on  let s talk to marino 
fine  you talk to marino 
i m going to find out the blonde s name 
who do you think you are  superman 
you re just a kid  for god s sake 
yeah  i m the kid that saved your life 
all right  look 
let me talk to marino 
if he cops out  then i ll help you 
ok  but you can t mention my name 
mike would kill me 
i m supposed to be   
studying for a french exam 
well  your friend s covering
for you tonight  right 
well  i m your friend  too 
and i ll be the best cover you ever had 
ok 
you sure you going to be ok here 
fine 
well    here you go 
  good night 
  good night 
hey  marino  i gotta talk to you 
  mr  out of town turn up 
  no 
then you better send
for your overnight bags 
hey  come on 
you know i didn t kill that woman 
you re still my best bet 
for your information 
she tried to kill me last night 
really 
is that supposed to be concern
in your voice 
i take a professional interest
in our citizens knocking each other off 
where did this happen 
she followed me from the sheraton
into the subway 
i thought i lost her 
but she was waiting when i got home 
  she tried to slash me 
  any witnesses to this one 
  yes 
  who 
  i can t tell you 
  out of town again 
no  i just promised
i wouldn t say anything 
you know  this has
a familiar ring to it 
look  marino  i m not interested
in your wiseass remarks 
someone s trying to kill me 
and i need help 
i ll help you  i got a nice cell 
you ll be very safe in it 
hey  eddie 
hey  wait a minute  look 
i know the murderer is
one of elliott s patients 
  how do you know that 
  because she came out of his office 
did you see her 
well  no  not exactly 
but i know she came out 
you got to get in there 
get his appointment book 
her name s got to be in it 
i hope you make a better hooker
than you do a detective 
i thought about elliott s appointment
book a long time ago 
  so 
  so   
you can t just walk into some shrink s
joint and start going through his books 
you need a search warrant 
and judges take a long time
before they let you start snooping
around some shrink s office 
of course  that wouldn t prevent
a paranoid murder suspect
from breaking in 
you know  searching for some evidence
to defend her case 
oh  i get it 
you want me to break in for you 
i don t want you to do anything illegal 
you can quote me on that 
but i m booking you tomorrow 
you got it  tomorrow 
i m dr  levy 
how do you do  i m dr  elliott 
what can i do for you  dr  elliott 
you re seeing a patient of mine 
that s right 
i believe she s dangerous 
really  in what way 
she s causing me trouble
because i wouldn t approve
her sex change operation 
what kind of trouble has she caused you 
she s threatened me several times
over the phone 
  she also stole my razor 
  why would she do that 
doctor  did you read about the woman
who was slashed to death in an elevator 
it was on the front page 
i could hardly miss   
kate miller  the victim  was my patient 
you don t think that bobbi
had anything to do with that 
my razor s gone 
kate miller was killed with a razor 
nobody else could have taken it 
doctor  i am not paranoid 
bobbi has threatened me over the phone 
she said she was going to hurt me 
my patient was slashed to death 
and my razor s gone 
now you don t have to be a detective
to figure it out  do you 
come with me  and   
we ll talk to the police 
i ve already been to the police 
but i didn t tell them about bobbi 
i wanted to talk to her first 
i wanted to be absolutely sure
that it was her 
but she wouldn t return my calls 
i was hoping you d be able to help 
yes  i ll help 
i ll talk to her 
if i agree with your diagnosis 
we ll go to the police 
thank you 
please let me know what happens 
do you know why bobbi came to see me
in the first place 
no 
why don t we go to my office 
and we ll try to get in touch with her 
i am late for an appointment now 
why don t you call me at my office
when you ve reached her 
all right 
you sure you ll be at your office 
yes  i m sure 
i ll call you there 
peter miller  i left some super 8 film 
there s four dollars there 
i timed elliott s patients
coming out of his office 
and the fastest was eight seconds 
so i set my camera to go off
every four seconds
so i d be sure to get a good shot
of everybody 
  that s her 
  she must be his last appointment 
we got to get a look in that book 
yeah  i know  marino wants it  too 
only  i can get it for him faster 
no legal red tape  just my ass 
look  i ll get it  nobody cares about
my ass  i m just a grief struck kid 
yeah  but what a kid 
okay  i got an idea 
it was very nice of you to see   
it was nice of you to see me so soon 
i try to keep my nights open
for returning phone calls
or in case a patient
needs some extra help 
i was worried about you 
you ve had a terrible experience 
i know 
i didn t realize   
but i ve been having
these terrible nightmares 
what were they about 
well   
i have to get a cigarette 
i m in this house that i ve never
been to before  visiting a friend 
he s not there 
i m watching tv   
and the doorbell rings 
it s a man 
he s big  dark 
he says his car broke down 
and he needs to use the phone 
i believe him and let him in   
although i know something s wrong 
he closes the door  locks it 
and takes out a razor 
he says he s not going to hurt me 
then he tells me   
what he s going to do to me   
and how much i m going to like it 
all the time he s talking 
i can see the bulge in his pants 
he orders me to strip 
i do it 
keeping one eye on the razor 
he drops his pants   
forces me down  on my stomach 
he spreads my legs 
kneels down behind me   
and rests the cold blade 
forcing it 
i m sorry 
what s the matter 
it s just so dirty 
why do you say that 
look  i know what dirty is 
and this is dirty 
well  why don t you just talk about it 
i m sure it s not as bad as you think 
it s very bad 
and you re talking to an expert on bad 
oh  really 
now what makes you such an expert 
because i m a hooker 
and i have done most of the bad things
you just read about 
do you like doing these things 
  sometimes 
  what do you like about it 
i like to turn men on 
i must do a pretty good job
because they pay me a lot 
do you ever have any sex
that s not paid for 
is that a proposal 
no  it   
it s what we psychiatrists call
a question 
yes 
 yes  what 
yes  i do  for men that turn me on 
what sort of men turn you on 
mature  doctorly type 
like you 
are you sexually attracted to me 
yes  are you 
attracted to you 
yes 
but then 
this isn t a social visit  is it 
you ve come here for help and my job
is to offer you emotional assistance 
how about some sexual assistance 
do you want to fuck me 
  oh  yes 
  well  why don t you 
  because i m a doctor and   
  fucked a lot of doctors 
  and i m married 
  fucked a lot of them  too 
don t you think
we re getting off the point 
do you mind if i take off my coat 
no 
and the rest  too 
now  why would you want to do
a thing like that 
well  because of the size of that cock
in your pants 
i don t think you re so married 
well 
what do you think 
i think you re a very attractive woman 
would you like to touch me 
yes and no  yes  because i m   
well  why don t you 
i told you why 
that s right  you re a married doctor 
i remember now 
  i think you re full of shit 
  you do 
just because i happen to have
personal and professional ethics 
look  doc  i think you re kind of shy 
so    i m going to go powder my nose
and when i come back 
i hope to find your clothes
right next to mine 
and if not  we can just get back
to the mind fuck 
dr  elliott 
dr  elliott 
dr  elliott 
you really are shy  aren t you 
liz 
behind you  liz 
so you had me followed 
that s right 
you ve met betty luce  one of our best
young police    persons 
when i told you i was attacked
on the subway  you thought i was nuts 
well  detective luce told me
she lost you at columbus circle 
i didn t figure there was another blonde
following you  i mean  who would 
yeah  and you wrote me off as a girl
with an overactive imagination 
yeah  something like that 
  and she followed me to elliott s 
  that s right 
thank god 
what s wrong with that guy  anyway 
  he was a transsexual 
  what 
a transsexual 
about to make the final step  but his
male side couldn t let him do it 
male side 
there was dr  elliott 
and there was bobbi 
bobbi came to me
to get psychiatric approval
for a sex reassignment operation 
i thought he was unstable 
and elliott confirmed my diagnosis 
opposite sexes inhabiting the same body 
the sex change operation
was to resolve the conflict 
but as much as bobbi tried to get it 
elliott blocked it 
so bobbi got even 
by killing mrs  miller 
yes  she aroused elliott 
just as you did  miss blake 
you mean  when elliott got turned on 
bobbi took over 
yes  it was like bobbi s red alert 
elliott s penis became erect
and bobbi took control 
trying to kill anyone
that made elliott masculinely sexual 
when elliott came to my office 
it was the first time
i saw bobbi s masculine self 
when he told me that he thought
bobbi had killed mrs  miller 
he was confessing himself 
i immediately called detective marino 
so why the hell didn t you stop me
from going to elliott s 
why  because i was at a football game
with my kids  that s why 
by the time i spoke with dr  levy 
you were already over there 
so you never really thought
i killed mrs  miller 
no  but i had to get into elliott s
office to find out which weirdo did 
so i pressed you into service 
are you kidding 
so i had miss luce there tailing you
to make sure
you didn t get into too much trouble 
thanks 
well  it s always wonderful
to be of some assistance to the police 
are you kidding 
so what s going to happen to elliott 
well 
there s some men and women who think
they re born in the wrong body 
they re called transsexuals 
and all they want to do
is have their sex changed 
how do you do that 
well  if you re a man
that wants to become a woman 
you take female hormones 
what do they do 
well  your skin softens  you grow
breasts  and you don t get hard anymore 
great 
you sure you want to know about this 
yeah  it s giving me some wonderful
new ideas for a science project 
instead of building a computer 
i could build a woman    out of me 
great idea  in that case 
i ll give you all the details 
the next step is surgery 
let me see if i can remember
the exact word that levy told me 
oh  yeah  a penectomy 
what s that 
you know  when they take your penis
and slice it down the middle 
yeah  that s what i thought it was 
then   
castration   
plastic reconstruction and
the formation of an artificial vagina 
a vaginoplasty  to those in the know 
and i thought elliott
just put on a dress 
he did  and a wig  too 
but you see  that s no good in bed 
when you gotta take everything off 
what s going to happen to him now 
well  first he has to recover
from the gun wound 
and then if he s ever sane enough
to get out of bellevue  they ll try him 
and guess who s the star witness 
you 
right  something
i m really looking forward to 
well  i think i m going to stick
to my computer 
that sounds like a very good idea 
look  liz   
i gotta get home and get to work 
i m going to miss having you on my tail 
it made me feel kind of safe 
look  you want to come home with me 
i d love the company 
wouldn t mike mind
