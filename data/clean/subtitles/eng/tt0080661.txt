im always there all day long
im usually there
ok doctor lets talk in here
call me
she was picked up by lockman
at the museum
she spent the afternoon at his place
and was chopped up in the elevator
on the way out
that girl out there saw the murderer
thats terrible
do you know who it is
some broad
a woman
yeah
miss blake didnt get
a great look at her face
because she had on these big sunglasses
is there anything i can do to help
yeah when you spoke with mrs miller
did she say
she was going to meet anybody
no
did she leave your office
with anybody
no
what was she seeing you for
nothing too serious she had
some problems with her marriage
and i was helping her work them out
what kind of problems
are you married detective marino
yeah
children
two sons
when was the last time
you had intercourse with your wife
now what the fuck is it to you
thats exactly how i feel about
your questions concerning mrs miller
hey look doctor
we got a brutally murdered woman here
who passed the point
of being embarrassed
by anything you might tell me
i guess youre right
im sorry
but im not used to discussing
a patients case with outsiders
im not an outsider im a cop
now lets make it easy for you
was she looking to get killed
you mean was she suicidal
yeah
no
no
so why did she pick up
this lockman character
he couldve been a killer
but he wasnt
yeah but the next guy might have been
you know if at first you dont succeed
do you think she wanted to get killed
dont you look
we got some hotpants broad
cruising around for some action
the guy she picked up went down on her
in a cab for christs sake
i got a blowbyblow description
from the cabby
after she finishes with him
she comes on to some weirdo
in the elevator
hey theres all kinds of ways
to get killed in this city
if youre looking for it
well yes she did have a problem
about her sexual worth
and this morning she asked me
if i was attracted to her
yeah but youre not a psycho
you do know something though
dont you doc
yes of course
i do some work at bellevue
could she have met one of these nuts
at your office
i mean some kind of weirdo she couldve
turned on that might have followed her
the term we use detective marino
is not weirdo
but a person
suffering from emotional dysfunction
and a problem of maladaption
and they never come to my office
are you sure
how about a new patient
i mean how do you know
how nuts they are until you see them
thats possible
but its hardly likely
doctor
youre not protecting
one of your patients now are you
absolutely not
well doc
youve got to look at it my way
see we got no leads
except a witness out there
who maybe should take a look
at all your patients
that were around that morning
and that way i can be absolutely sure
that my weirdo isnt your
person suffering
from emotional dysfunctions
and problems of maladaption
peter come on lets go home
excuse me
ok doctor
im sorry youre not more cooperative
which means that
im just going to have to waste some
time in getting a court order
to check out your appointment book
im sorry too
but i feel i must protect
the confidentiality of my patients
of course were just two professionals
doing our job
its too bad we cant work together
come on
thank you very much for your help
ill be in touch
yes thank you for waiting
this is the answering service
would you care to leave a message
yes i would
this is dr elliott

you were a war correspondent
among other things
and a foreign correspondent
in the middle east and
i did a lot of police reporting
and i dove on spanish treasure wrecks
you did a lot
of macho things then
this is very common among transsexuals
you find
when i speak of transsexuals
i tend to speak of male to female
because there are a whole lot of more
of them than going the other way
and an awful lot of them
have real macho backgrounds
i know a police captain a west pointer
a couple of fighter pilots
they all you know
most of them tried real hard
you were married twice
you are also the father
of three children
so you enjoyed a
i dont want to say normal i guess
thats a prejudicial way to put it
but you enjoyed the traditional role
of father
you fathered three children
and you have engaged in
at least two heterosexual relationships
more than that
ive always been a devout heterosexual

mike would kill me
im supposed to be
studying for a french exam
well your friends covering
for you tonight right
well im your friend too
and ill be the best cover you ever had
ok
you sure you going to be ok here
fine
well here you go
good night
good night
hey marino i gotta talk to you
mr outoftown turn up
no
then you better send
for your overnight bags
hey come on
you know i didnt kill that woman
youre still my best bet
for your information
she tried to kill me last night
really
is that supposed to be concern
in your voice
i take a professional interest
in our citizens knocking each other off
where did this happen
she followed me from the sheraton
into the subway
i thought i lost her
but she was waiting when i got home
she tried to slash me
any witnesses to this one
yes
who
i cant tell you
out of town again
no i just promised
i wouldnt say anything
you know this has
a familiar ring to it
look marino im not interested
in your wiseass remarks
someones trying to kill me
and i need help
ill help you i got a nice cell
youll be very safe in it
hey eddie
hey wait a minute look
i know the murderer is
one of elliotts patients
how do you know that
because she came out of his office
did you see her
well no not exactly
but i know she came out
you got to get in there
get his appointment book
her names got to be in it
i hope you make a better hooker
than you do a detective
i thought about elliotts appointment
book a long time ago
so
so
you cant just walk into some shrinks
joint and start going through his books
you need a search warrant
and judges take a long time
before they let you start snooping
around some shrinks office
of course that wouldnt prevent
a paranoid murder suspect
from breaking in
you know searching for some evidence
to defend her case
oh i get it
you want me to break in for you
i dont want you to do anything illegal
you can quote me on that
but im booking you tomorrow
you got it tomorrow
im dr levy
how do you do im dr elliott
what can i do for you dr elliott
youre seeing a patient of mine
thats right
i believe shes dangerous
really in what way
shes causing me trouble
because i wouldnt approve
her sexchange operation
what kind of trouble has she caused you
shes threatened me several times
over the phone
she also stole my razor
why would she do that
doctor did you read about the woman
who was slashed to death in an elevator
it was on the front page
i could hardly miss
kate miller the victim was my patient
you dont think that bobbi
had anything to do with that
my razors gone
kate miller was killed with a razor
nobody else could have taken it
doctor i am not paranoid
bobbi has threatened me over the phone
she said she was going to hurt me
my patient was slashed to death
and my razors gone
now you dont have to be a detective
to figure it out do you
come with me and
well talk to the police
ive already been to the police
but i didnt tell them about bobbi
i wanted to talk to her first
i wanted to be absolutely sure
that it was her
but she wouldnt return my calls
i was hoping youd be able to help
yes ill help
ill talk to her
if i agree with your diagnosis
well go to the police
thank you
please let me know what happens
do you know why bobbi came to see me
in the first place
no
why dont we go to my office
and well try to get in touch with her
i am late for an appointment now
why dont you call me at my office
when youve reached her
all right
you sure youll be at your office
yes im sure
ill call you there
peter miller i left some super8 film
theres four dollars there
i timed elliotts patients
coming out of his office
and the fastest was eight seconds
so i set my camera to go off
every four seconds
so id be sure to get a good shot
of everybody
thats her
she must be his last appointment
we got to get a look in that book
yeah i know marino wants it too
only i can get it for him faster
no legal red tape just my ass
look ill get it nobody cares about
my ass im just a griefstruck kid
yeah but what a kid
okay i got an idea
it was very nice of you to see
it was nice of you to see me so soon
i try to keep my nights open
for returning phone calls
or in case a patient
needs some extra help
i was worried about you
youve had a terrible experience
i know
i didnt realize
but ive been having
these terrible nightmares
what were they about
well
i have to get a cigarette
im in this house that ive never
been to before visiting a friend
hes not there
im watching tv
and the doorbell rings
its a man
hes big dark
he says his car broke down
and he needs to use the phone
i believe him and let him in
although i know somethings wrong
he closes the door locks it
and takes out a razor
he says hes not going to hurt me
then he tells me
what hes going to do to me
and how much im going to like it
all the time hes talking
i can see the bulge in his pants
he orders me to strip
i do it
keeping one eye on the razor
he drops his pants
forces me down on my stomach
he spreads my legs
kneels down behind me
and rests the cold blade
forcing it
im sorry
whats the matter
its just so dirty
why do you say that
look i know what dirty is
and this is dirty
well why dont you just talk about it
im sure its not as bad as you think
its very bad
and youre talking to an expert on bad
oh really
now what makes you such an expert
because im a hooker
and i have done most of the bad things
you just read about
do you like doing these things
sometimes
what do you like about it
i like to turn men on
i must do a pretty good job
because they pay me a lot
do you ever have any sex
thats not paid for
is that a proposal
no it
its what we psychiatrists call
a question
yes
yes what
yes i do for men that turn me on
what sort of men turn you on
mature doctorly type
like you
are you sexually attracted to me
yes are you
attracted to you
yes
but then
this isnt a social visit is it
youve come here for help and my job
is to offer you emotional assistance
how about some sexual assistance
do you want to fuck me
oh yes
well why dont you
because im a doctor and
fucked a lot of doctors
and im married
fucked a lot of them too
dont you think
were getting off the point
do you mind if i take off my coat
no
and the rest too
now why would you want to do
a thing like that
well because of the size of that cock
in your pants
i dont think youre so married
well
what do you think
i think youre a very attractive woman
would you like to touch me
yes and no yes because im
well why dont you
i told you why
thats right youre a married doctor
i remember now
i think youre full of shit
you do
just because i happen to have
personal and professional ethics
look doc i think youre kind of shy
so im going to go powder my nose
and when i come back
i hope to find your clothes
right next to mine
and if not we can just get back
to the mindfuck
dr elliott
dr elliott
dr elliott
you really are shy arent you
liz
behind you liz
so you had me followed
thats right
youve met betty luce one of our best
young police persons
when i told you i was attacked
on the subway you thought i was nuts
well detective luce told me
she lost you at columbus circle
i didnt figure there was another blonde
following you i mean who would
yeah and you wrote me off as a girl
with an overactive imagination
yeah something like that
and she followed me to elliotts
thats right
thank god
whats wrong with that guy anyway
he was a transsexual
what
a transsexual
about to make the final step but his
male side couldnt let him do it
male side
there was dr elliott
and there was bobbi
bobbi came to me
to get psychiatric approval
for a sexreassignment operation
i thought he was unstable
and elliott confirmed my diagnosis
opposite sexes inhabiting the same body
the sexchange operation
was to resolve the conflict
but as much as bobbi tried to get it
elliott blocked it
so bobbi got even
by killing mrs miller
yes she aroused elliott
just as you did miss blake
you mean when elliott got turned on
bobbi took over
yes it was like bobbis red alert
elliotts penis became erect
and bobbi took control
trying to kill anyone
that made elliott masculinely sexual
when elliott came to my office
it was the first time
i saw bobbis masculine self
when he told me that he thought
bobbi had killed mrs miller
he was confessing himself
i immediately called detective marino
so why the hell didnt you stop me
from going to elliotts
why because i was at a football game
with my kids thats why
by the time i spoke with dr levy
you were already over there
so you never really thought
i killed mrs miller
no but i had to get into elliotts
office to find out which weirdo did
so i pressed you into service
are you kidding
so i had miss luce there tailing you
to make sure
you didnt get into too much trouble
thanks
well its always wonderful
to be of some assistance to the police
are you kidding
so whats going to happen to elliott
well
theres some men and women who think
theyre born in the wrong body
theyre called transsexuals
and all they want to do
is have their sex changed
how do you do that
well if youre a man
that wants to become a woman
you take female hormones
what do they do
well your skin softens you grow
breasts and you dont get hard anymore
great
you sure you want to know about this
yeah its giving me some wonderful
new ideas for a science project
instead of building a computer
i could build a woman out of me
great idea in that case
ill give you all the details
the next step is surgery
let me see if i can remember
the exact word that levy told me
oh yeah a penectomy
whats that
you know when they take your penis
and slice it down the middle
yeah thats what i thought it was
then
castration
plastic reconstruction and
the formation of an artificial vagina
a vaginoplasty to those in the know
and i thought elliott
just put on a dress
he did and a wig too
but you see thats no good in bed
when you gotta take everything off
whats going to happen to him now
well first he has to recover
from the gun wound
and then if hes ever sane enough
to get out of bellevue theyll try him
and guess whos the star witness
you
right something
im really looking forward to
well i think im going to stick
to my computer
that sounds like a very good idea
look liz
i gotta get home and get to work
im going to miss having you on my tail
it made me feel kind of safe
look you want to come home with me
id love the company
wouldnt mike mind
