i was funny 
maybe you lost your sense of humor 
i think i have a pretty good sense of humor 
like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop   
   waving warrants  telling me
my boyfriend s a drug dealer 
that was funny 
i laughed my ass off for weeks 
i wrote you letters 
  i made fires 
  i tried to call 
yeah  but my phone was tapped
for six months  that was fun too 
  can i explain 
  let me guess 
you re sorry  you didn t mean to hurt me 
you were trying to protect me   
   and it wasn t your fault 
  it was my fault 
  we re closed 
  the sign said   
well  the sign lied  thanks 
you too  ford 
you don t know how many times i ve played
this out in my head in the last six months 
must be frustrating 
you got balls even coming here 
the feds and the hellions are after you

  ford 
  yeah

to go to the beach this weekend 
lucky for me  luther hates to swim 
henry 
i don t know why
you re buying a new seat  ford 
looks like you haven t
broken in your old one yet 
looks like ford prefers to ride bitch to me 
it looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself  henry 
share one with your friends long enough
and you re liable to catch something 
heard you were in indochina 
some shit like that 
  good food there 
  thailand  actually   
   but the food was great 
thanks for asking 
you re a pretty funny guy  ford

where are my goddamn bikes 
you really want them   
   or what s inside them 
where are they 
  why don t you just cut it out of him

i tell you  the last six months  every time
i took that drive i thought about you 
did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to thailand 
you got to the bottom of this beer

all right 
first met henry about a year ago  i didn t
like him  but he was a paying customer 
i fixed his chopper a couple times 
six months ago  he turns up at your shop   
   with these two bikes 
he asked me if i d mind looking after them 
i figure 
what the hell  right 
so i do 
then i go to move them  they don t start 
so i check the tanks 
they re filled with kilos of crystal meth 
so first thing  i get them out of there 
so that s why that fed mcpherson
raided my shop after you split 
and you dropped off
the face of the earth 
i took off   
   so that you wouldn t get dragged into it 
i split 
now i m the only one involved with henry 
so you left to protect me 
what d you think  you were gonna just
come back and explain everything   
   and then we d just ride off
into the sunset together 
more or less 
well  which is it  more or less 
well  i was actually thinking mexico

yeah  once we re in the clear  i m gonna tell
henry where he can pick up his shit 
of course   
   l m also gonna call that punk
mcpherson and tell him 
arrange a get together with the evidence 
that way everybody gets
what they deserve  right 
henry gets his shit 
mcpherson gets henry   
   and we all go to mexico and get drunk 
as i reported earlier  wallace  a member
of an inglewood motorcycle gang   
    the reapers  was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain 
with the help of an eyewitness 
the fbi has come up with a suspect 
cary ford  a white male
in his late 20s 
ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle   
    wearing orange and black
racing leathers 
if you have any idea
as to his whereabouts   
    please contact the local authorities 
cary ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of junior wallace 
call the sheriff  hal 
ford was just spotted at lone pine 
let s drive a little 
yeah 
heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy 
  dawson s creek  the white boy 
  all right  get me a map 
we gotta make up some time 
  yeah 
  give me ford 
ford  it s for you 
  ford 
  change in plans 
seems your buddy junior s dead 
feds think you did it 
reapers think you did it 
hell  everybody thinks you did it 
you tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away 
i don t take orders  henry 
  never have  never will 
  what s that 
ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold 
you spent too much time in chink land 
ford  what does that mean 
it means i don t wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan 
and by the way  henry   
    chink land  implies china 
i was in thailand  it s a different country 
hey  my phone 
hold it right there 
everybody down on the ground 
quit shooting 
you got the wrong guy 
we ll let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here 
  are you okay 
  i got it under control 
i didn t kill anybody 
shit 
you earl 
loved your french toast 
  down 
  like i said   
   i love a girl who can take care of herself 
  thanks 
you re on the news 
that guy you got in a fight with is dead 
  henry set me up  he wants his drugs back 
  why don t you give them back 
  it s the only insurance i got 
  you were with me last night 
i m your alibi  down  earl 
tell the cops 
right now it ain t the cops
that i m worried about 
not good 
  reapers 
  he s right  shane 
you think we could finish
this conversation later 
all right  once we re in the clear 
you call the cops  agreed 
what should i do with this 
forget what i said about liking women
who can take care of themselves 
sorry  it s gonna get crazy 
you ll be safer here than running with us 
  see you back in l a 
  what am i supposed to do 
hang out with earl 
which way 
which way did you say  old man 
  which way 
  shortcut 
let s catch them 
kill them and bury them 
they re still on us 
shit  there s more of them 
  what are we gonna do  ford 
  where we going 
i m working on it 
which way did they go 
damn  come on 
now can we call the cops 
  no 
  why not 
because it s not just the cops 
it s mcpherson 
mcpherson 
the guy that tore up your shop 
he already thinks i m a drug dealer 
now he thinks i shot junior 
and he has no reason to think otherwise   
   unless i can prove it 
  bad just turned to worse  bent link 
this just keeps getting
better and better 
i got a spare in my toolkit 
he was strangled  by the way 
  who 
  junior  he was strangled with a bike chain 
shit 
henry used the chain off his own bike 
  how do you know that 
  how do you know 
yeah  how did you know that 
well  it s   
it s complicated 
  you turning left  or we going to oregon 
  it s right 
it s right  what    
get the finger out of my face 
i know where i m going 
henry just screwed himself 
  see those scratches and nicks 
  yeah 
well  it picks them up
from the sprocket 
now  no two bikes
got the same chain wear pattern   
   because no two sprockets
are the same 
so we match the chain
used to kill junior with henry s bike   
   and we got him 
like a fingerprint 
try not to move your lips
so much when you think 
now we call the cops  right 
now we call the cops 
  real cute  guys 
  get a room 
  mcpherson  it s f   
  ford  looks like you re trading up 
going from drug trafficking
to first degree murder 
  i was set up 
  in my business i hear that a lot 
  loud  recorder s on 
  who wants to set you up 
henry james 
leader of the hellions 
now  why would he wanna do that 
those drugs you were looking for
belong to henry 
i stashed them the night before you
raided the shop  he wants them back 
tell me where the drugs are 
i might buy that d give henry motive 
  maybe we can work something out 
   maybe  don t cut it  arrest henry   
   then i ll take you to the drugs 
  arrest him  on what grounds 
first degree murder 
  what if i tie the murder weapon to henry 
  big  if  
arrest him 
  get his bike  i ll show you 
  get his bike  okay 
anyone else you d like me to arrest 
ex girlfriend  second grade teacher    
  hold on  i m making a list 
  you re not listening to me 
  henry killed junior 
  i don t know that 
then you can t help me 
well  that didn t fly 
screw it  let s haul ass down
to mexico and don t look back 
as much as i hate to say it 
i agree with him 
  we re going to l a 
  oh  yeah  that makes sense 
i have to get henry s bike 
that will clear me 
they ll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast 
we re not exactly hard
to spot driving these 
  you wanna ditch the bikes 
  no  i d rather be fast than invisible 
come on  wouldn t be any fun
if it was easy  right 
i live my life a quarter mile at a time 
that is the dumbest thing
i ve ever heard 
po po got the highways
blocked from here to l a 
l a
