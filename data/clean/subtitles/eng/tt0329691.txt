henry
i dont know why
youre buying a new seat ford
looks like you havent
broken in your old one yet
looks like ford prefers to ride bitch to me
it looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself henry
share one with your friends long enough
and youre liable to catch something
heard you were in indochina
some shit like that
good food there
thailand actually
but the food was great
thanks for asking

theres this one road that winds up
the coast from bangkok to pattani
its got mountains on one side
ocean on the other
so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it
i tell you the last six months every time
i took that drive i thought about you
did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to thailand
you got to the bottom of this beer
explain away
all right
first met henry about a year ago i didnt
like him but he was a paying customer
i fixed his chopper a couple times
six months ago he turns up at your shop
with these two bikes
he asked me if id mind looking after them
i figure
what the hell right
so i do
then i go to move them they dont start
so i check the tanks
theyre filled with kilos of crystal meth
so first thing i get them out of there
so thats why that fed mcpherson
raided my shop after you split
and you dropped off
the face of the earth
i took off
so that you wouldnt get dragged into it
i split
now im the only one involved with henry
so you left to protect me
whatd you think you were gonna just
come back and explain everything
and then wed just ride off
into the sunset together
more or less
well which is it more or less
well i was actually thinking mexico
youre killing me
get your gear on
not a good time
heading to cabo shanes coming
damn really
yeah
give me 10 minutes all right
come on
move
move man move
damn

i love a girl who can
take care of herself man

so what are you gonna do about henry
we got a plan right
yeah once were in the clear im gonna tell
henry where he can pick up his shit
of course
lm also gonna call that punk
mcpherson and tell him
arrange a gettogether with the evidence
that way everybody gets
what they deserve right
henry gets his shit
mcpherson gets henry
and we all go to mexico and get drunk
as i reported earlier wallace a member
of an inglewood motorcycle gang
the reapers was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain
with the help of an eyewitness
the fbi has come up with a suspect
cary ford a white male
in his late 20s
ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle
wearing orange and black
racing leathers
if you have any idea
as to his whereabouts
please contact the local authorities
cary ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of junior wallace
call the sheriff hal
ford was just spotted at lone pine
lets drive a little
yeah
heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy
dawsons creek the white boy
all right get me a map
we gotta make up some time
yeah
give me ford
ford its for you
ford
change in plans
seems your buddy juniors dead
feds think you did it
reapers think you did it
hell everybody thinks you did it
you tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away
i dont take orders henry
never have never will
whats that
ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold
you spent too much time in chink land
ford what does that mean
it means i dont wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan
and by the way henry
chink land implies china
i was in thailand its a different country
hey my phone
hold it right there
everybody down on the ground
quit shooting
you got the wrong guy
well let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here
are you okay
i got it under control
i didnt kill anybody
shit
you earl
loved your french toast
down
like i said
i love a girl who can take care of herself
thanks
youre on the news
that guy you got in a fight with is dead
henry set me up he wants his drugs back
why dont you give them back
its the only insurance i got
you were with me last night
im your alibi down earl
tell the cops
right now it aint the cops
that im worried about
not good
reapers
hes right shane
you think we could finish
this conversation later
all right once were in the clear
you call the cops agreed
what should i do with this
forget what i said about liking women
who can take care of themselves
sorry its gonna get crazy
youll be safer here than running with us
see you back in la
what am i supposed to do
hang out with earl
which way
which way did you say old man
which way
shortcut
lets catch them
kill them and bury them
theyre still on us
shit theres more of them
what are we gonna do ford
where we going
im working on it
which way did they go
damn come on
now can we call the cops
no
why not
because its not just the cops
its mcpherson
mcpherson
the guy that tore up your shop
he already thinks im a drug dealer
now he thinks i shot junior
and he has no reason to think otherwise
unless i can prove it
bad just turned to worse bent link
this just keeps getting
better and better
i got a spare in my toolkit
he was strangled by the way
who
junior he was strangled with a bike chain
shit
henry used the chain off his own bike
how do you know that
how do you know
yeah how did you know that
well its
its complicated
you turning left or we going to oregon
its right
its right what
get the finger out of my face
i know where im going
henry just screwed himself
see those scratches and nicks
yeah
well it picks them up
from the sprocket
now no two bikes
got the same chainwear pattern
because no two sprockets
are the same
so we match the chain
used to kill junior with henrys bike
and we got him
like a fingerprint
try not to move your lips
so much when you think
now we call the cops right
now we call the cops
real cute guys
get a room
mcpherson its f
ford looks like youre trading up
going from drug trafficking
to firstdegree murder
i was set up
in my business i hear that a lot
loud recorders on
who wants to set you up
henry james
leader of the hellions
now why would he wanna do that
those drugs you were looking for
belong to henry
i stashed them the night before you
raided the shop he wants them back
tell me where the drugs are
i might buy thatd give henry motive
maybe we can work something out
maybe dont cut it arrest henry
then ill take you to the drugs
arrest him on what grounds
firstdegree murder
what if i tie the murder weapon to henry
big if
arrest him
get his bike ill show you
get his bike okay
anyone else youd like me to arrest
exgirlfriend secondgrade teacher
hold on im making a list
youre not listening to me
henry killed junior
i dont know that
then you cant help me
well that didnt fly
screw it lets haul ass down
to mexico and dont look back
as much as i hate to say it
i agree with him
were going to la
oh yeah that makes sense
i have to get henrys bike
that will clear me
theyll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast
were not exactly hard
to spot driving these
you wanna ditch the bikes
no id rather be fast than invisible
come on wouldnt be any fun
if it was easy right
i live my life a quarter mile at a time
that is the dumbest thing
ive ever heard
popo got the highways
blocked from here to la
la
why would he go to the one place
he know i got on lockdown
lets catch him on the interstate
