there s a guy in there
with a paw    
that owes me some money 
a paw 
go get me my money 
okay 
han said 
okane 
han said  okane 
let s go 
you re in the pickup
and delivery business now 
i might call you once a week
or once an hour 
i don t care
if you re sick as a dog    
or in bed with beyonc√© 
i call  you show 
only if you teach me
how to drift 
this ain t a negotiation 
i wasn t negotiating 
what s he doing here 
he s paying me back for
that crumpled beer can    
sitting in my garage 
hope he s not driving 
gaijin 
when is your next race 
i d really like to be there 
why not be in it 
you heard me 
ready to lose another car  han 
i m ready to take that
 86 corolla off your hands 
all right 
put up the  72 skyline 
done 
what do you think 
morimoto  huh 
get him out of here 
we have business to discuss 
your shipment s late 
since when are you
so worried about the details 
when is
the shipment arriving  han 
just sit pretty
and let me handle it 
hey  dad  it s me 
uh  i had to stay after school    
for some extracurricular activities 
so i ll be home a little later 
sir 
you really need to stop
following me around 
what are you doing here 
i thought i d stop by
and ask your boyfriend    
for some drifting lessons 
trust me 
you don t wanna be
a part of this world 
it s good enough for you 
you don t know anything about me 
well  why don t you think i know 
 cause i m a gaijin  an outsider 
let me guess 
you re an army brat
who moved around a lot 
your mama and daddy
was never home 
so you walked around
pissed off all the time 
and now you found your family
with these drift nuts 
zero for one  cowboy 
why can t you go find
a nice japanese girl
like the rest of
the white guys around here 
is everything okay back there 
i can handle dk 
i thought he s yakuza 
his uncle s yakuza 
he s just playing gangster
in his little storage room 
but i need him 
he keeps uncle kamata
from poking around too much 
what do you mean 
well  his uncle gets
a piece of the action    
from everyone on his turf 
we re on his turf 
50  of something is better than
100  of nothing 
so have you raced dk 
why not  is he that good 
what s the point of a race 
to see if i m better
than the other guy 
just proves you re faster 
that s all 
if i were to race 
it would have to be    
for something important 
or why else do it at all 
why are you letting me race 
 cause you re dk s kryptonite 
and you owe me a car 
oh  shit 
what the    
police cars here are
only factory tuned 
you can do better than 180k 
they can t catch you 
so they don t even try 
you know what 
i m beginning to like
this country already 
danny 
you re looking good 
disco 
we gotta catch up 
get you a drink on me  huh 
let s go 
aha  easy now  ladies 
come on 
what s up  how you doing 
hey  baby 
keep your hands off the kid  girls 
he s underage 
ladies  ladies  ladies 
disneyland for grownups  huh 
all these girls  man 
they look like    
what  models 
check it out 
see 
tokyo is the fashion capital    
on this side of the planet 
all right 
now  imagine
you been posing all day 
i mean 
that s a lot of hard work 
not only do you get tired 
but  on top of that 
you wanna have a little fun 
but you can t    
 cause you don t even know
nobody in town 
and most of
the guys around here are    
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one 
so what do you do 
man  you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh 
yeah 
look  man  i don t just think
outside the box 
i tear it up 
that s my thing 
yo 
sean 
the red evo s yours 
what do you mean 
you re representing me now 
what you think  i m gonna
let you roll in a hyundai 
oh  man 
damn it 
my mother 
she s blind in one eye    
and she can drift
better than that 
han  where did you find this guy 
will someone please teach
this guy how to drift 
is that yours 
sure is 
what happened 
i don t know  i found
it this way at the base 
it s got potential 
yeah  maybe  we ll see 
you know  sean 
the japanese have a saying 
 the nail that sticks out
gets hammered  
you re gonna be late 
sean 
come on  man  you broke it 
hey  whoa  whoa 
there must be a misunderstanding 
out of my way  or you re next 
take it easy 
look  man  i don t
do refunds  all right 
okay  let s go  then 
let s go 
touch me again    
here 
try not to break this one 
say  man 
what the hell is
wrong with you  huh 
now everybody s gonna want
exchanges around here 
damn 
not easy saving the day  is it 
maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime 
you re doing all right 
thanks 
hey 
yeah 
sorry about the other night 
your life isn t any of my business 
it s okay 
foul 
  ain t no damn foul 
  that was a foul 
  yo  you in my face 
  that was a foul 
hey  han  sort this wanker out 
a wanker 
what do i look like  a zebra 
so  how did you end up
over here  anyway 
well  you know
those old westerns    
where the cowboys
make a run for the border 
this is my mexico 
why d you let me
race with your car 
you knew i was gonna wreck it 
why not 
 cause it s a lot of money 
i have money 
it s trust and character
i need around me 
you know  who you
choose to be around you    
lets you know who you are 
and one car in exchange
for knowing    
what a man s made of 
that s a price i can live with 
look at all those
people down there 
they follow the rules  for what 
they re letting fear lead them 
what happens if they don t 
life s simple 
you make choices
and you don t look back 
so  if you don t drift to win 
what do you drift for 
you really want to know 
yeah 
okay  let s go 
there s no  wax on 
wax off  with drifting 
learn by doin  it 
the first drifters
invented drifting    
out here in the mountains
by feeling it 
so feel it 
again 
what s in this bag 
you ll see 
how much you got 
keep going  keep going 
i m so good  man  i could
sell rubbers to a monk 
again 
again 
watch it  watch it 
not too early  now 
go  go  go  go 
don t lose it  don t lose it 
hey  twink 
get this man a bunk 
pleasure doing business 
yeah  baby  i told you 
i told you  didn t i 
it s actually not bad 
i didn t even have
to put ketchup on it 
see  i m not a total gaijin 
i hate that word 
it s what they used
to call me when i was a kid 
i thought you were born here 
well   outsider  can mean
many different things 
my mom died when i was 10 
she came out here
from australia    
when she finished high school 
and all i know
about her is that    
she went to work in a hostess bar 
dk s grandmother took me in 
well  my parents
split up when i was three 
me and mom moved around a lot 
mostly  cause of me 
well  it was all  cause of me 
kind of made myself
an outsider  you know 
without even thinking about it 
but i realize now 
outsider or insider 
it doesn t really matter 
all that matters is knowing
what you really want
and going after it 
we used to come up here
when we were kids 
even before we could drive
we d cut class  sneak out 
come up here  and watch
the older kids drift 
things were different back then 
once i got my license 
i practically lived up here 
back then  kids just drove
whatever they had 
you know  we just made do 
no one bothered us 
the day i got my license    
is the day i got
my first speeding ticket 
the day after that 
i won my first race 
i beat this rich kid
by three lengths 
i gotta admit  it felt good 
it felt like    
like everything else
just disappears 
no past and no future 
no problems 
just the moment 
boy needs to chill 
hey  twink 
i m gonna grab another set 
whoa  whoa 
whoa  whoa  another set 
no  look  that was
your third set today 
i mean  them tires ain t cheap 
dk  grab a chair

the matches in gasoline

think anyone would take
a second look at you
