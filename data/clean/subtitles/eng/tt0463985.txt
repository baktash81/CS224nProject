so worried about the details
when is
the shipment arriving han
just sit pretty
and let me handle it
hey dad its me
uh i had to stay after school
for some extracurricular activities
so ill be home a little later
sir
you really need to stop
following me around
what are you doing here
i thought id stop by
and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons
trust me
you dont wanna be
a part of this world
its good enough for you
you dont know anything about me
well why dont you think i know
cause im a gaijin an outsider
let me guess
youre an army brat
who moved around a lot
your mama and daddy
was never home
so you walked around
pissed off all the time
and now you found your family
with these drift nuts
zero for one cowboy
why cant you go find
a nice japanese girl
like the rest of
the white guys around here
is everything okay back there
i can handle dk
i thought hes yakuza
his uncles yakuza
hes just playing gangster
in his little storage room
but i need him
he keeps uncle kamata
from poking around too much
what do you mean
well his uncle gets
a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf
were on his turf
50 of something is better than
100 of nothing
so have you raced dk
why not is he that good
whats the point of a race
to see if im better
than the other guy
just proves youre faster
thats all
if i were to race
it would have to be
for something important
or why else do it at all
why are you letting me race
cause youre dks kryptonite
and you owe me a car
oh shit
what the
police cars here are
only factorytuned
you can do better than 180k
they cant catch you
so they dont even try
you know what

over here anyway
well you know
those old westerns
where the cowboys
make a run for the border
this is my mexico
whyd you let me
race with your car
you knew i was gonna wreck it

cause its a lot of money
i have money
its trust and character
i need around me
you know who you
choose to be around you
lets you know who you are
and one car in exchange
for knowing
what a mans made of
thats a price i can live with
look at all those
people down there
they follow the rules for what
theyre letting fear lead them
what happens if they dont
lifes simple
you make choices
and you dont look back
so if you dont drift to win
what do you drift for
you really want to know
yeah
okay lets go
theres no wax on
wax off with drifting
learn by doin it
the first drifters
invented drifting
out here in the mountains
by feeling it
so feel it
again
whats in this bag
youll see
how much you got
keep going keep going
im so good man i could
sell rubbers to a monk
again
again
watch it watch it
not too early now
go go go go
dont lose it dont lose it
hey twink
get this man a bunk
pleasure doing business
yeah baby i told you
i told you didnt i
its actually not bad
i didnt even have
to put ketchup on it
see im not a total gaijin
i hate that word
its what they used
to call me when i was a kid
i thought you were born here
well outsider can mean
many different things
my mom died when i was 10
she came out here
from australia
when she finished high school
and all i know
about her is that
she went to work in a hostess bar
dks grandmother took me in
well my parents
split up when i was three
me and mom moved around a lot
mostly cause of me
well it was all cause of me
kind of made myself
an outsider you know
without even thinking about it
but i realize now
outsider or insider
it doesnt really matter
all that matters is knowing
what you really want
and going after it
we used to come up here
when we were kids
even before we could drive
wed cut class sneak out
come up here and watch
the older kids drift
things were different back then
once i got my license
i practically lived up here
back then kids just drove
whatever they had
you know we just made do
no one bothered us
the day i got my license
is the day i got
my first speeding ticket
the day after that
i won my first race
i beat this rich kid
by three lengths
i gotta admit it felt good
it felt like
like everything else
just disappears
no past and no future
no problems
just the moment
boy needs to chill
hey twink
im gonna grab another set
whoa whoa
whoa whoa another set
no look that was
your third set today
i mean them tires aint cheap
dk grab a chair
were about to
roast some marshmallows

or the only thing youll
be driving is a wheelchair

the matches in gasoline

doing anything for a buck
