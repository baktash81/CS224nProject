everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do
every day 
so  you enjoy yourself here
at the brotherhood 
the children  i love the children 
they are my heart 
but to tell you the truth 
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day 
but they don t give me money
for fresh ingredients 
and they don t think i know a buttload
of crap about the gospel  but i do 
okay 
today  i saw a man in town 
people were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies 
sometimes i would like
that kind of respect 
who was this man 
well  to tell you the truth 
he was a luchador 
wrestling is ungodly  ignacio 
people cheer for him 
but he is a false idol

i know it is fun to wrestle 
a nice pile drive to the face 
or a punch to the face

not to wrestle your neighbor 
so you ve never wrestled 
me  no  come on  don t be crazy 
listen  i know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies 
and the clothes 
and the free creams and lotions 
but my life is good

i get to wake up every morning

it s the best  i love it 
i get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life 
it s fantastic

but we will let you win 
so where are you taking me 
well  sister  i saw a bum here today 
there were two bums 
and i said to myself 
  let s talk to these guys
about the gospel   
well  where are they 
i don t see them 
they should be coming by 
where is your robe  ignacio 
it was stinky 
but these are my recreation clothes 
 they look expensive 
 thank you 
i mean  yes 
they may have
the appearance of riches 
but beneath the clothes  we find a man 
and beneath a man 
we find his nucleus 
 nucleus 
 yes 
listen  i don t like the way
those guys just looked at you 
hey  can t you see this woman s a nun 
and if you guys

i wanna be a great fighter 
but i can t even beat
a couple of guys in the street 
nacho 
i think i know someone
who can help you 
 the lord 
 no 
he s a water gypsy 
he know wheres to find eagle eggs 
eagle eggs 
i m not listening to you  you re crazy 
nacho  i m telling you  this is for reals 
his eagle eggs possess
magical powers 
you could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived 
in order for you to become empowered
by the eagle 
you must climb that cliff 
find the egg 
crack open one of them 
and then swallow the yolk 
so  what you re saying to me
is if i can eat this yolk 
my moves will become
the best in the whole world 
definitely 
high five 
 summon your eagle powers 
 what do you think i am doing 
eagle powers  come to me 
please 
tag  tag  tag 
those eggs were a lie  steven 
a lie 
they gave me no eagle powers 
they gave me no nutrients 
sorry 
i don t want to get paid to lose 
i want to win 
i need professional help 
i need ramses 
he s the best 
we need to get in
with him and his buddies 
we must learn their ways 
but they are pros 
they only hang out with each other 
then we must go pro 
but going pro is not that easy 
it s political  obviously 
my area  amigo 
you see that guy over there 
his name is señor ramon 
he s ramses  manager
and he owns all of the big arenas 
he s having a party tomorrow night 
we need to go and show him

the wrong idea about you 
like maybe you are a floozy 
ignacio  i was in the kitchen
and there s no food

don t worry  i ll take care of it 
 but when 
 good night 
hey  let go my blouse 
we are wrestlers  too  we are invited

 okay 
hey  what about me 
i don t think i can lift you 
you are too fat 
good luck 
señor ramon 
 who are you 
 i am esqueleto  the luchador 
everybody is a luchador  mi amigo 
i think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro 
ramses  would you like to fight
this man in the ring 
so you want to make a name
for yourself  horseface 
win the battle jam next week 
the winner will fight ramses
in exhibition
in front of 5 000 people 
then you will be a pro 
i forgive you 
come here  soldier 
how did you get up here so fast 
secret tunnels 
some say wrestlers make bad lovers 
that they save themselves for the ring 
huh 
i love you

okay  my friend  this one s yours 
what 
this one yours 
i am singing at the party
i am singing
it s my turn to sing at the party
everyone is dancing
happy party
but ramses is not dancing
he does not dance at the parties
ramses is number one
he knows the secrets of desire
ramses is the one
he puts the people all on fire
ramses
steven 
come here 
that party was lame 
i hate that place 
hey 
take it easy 
it sucks to be me right now 
 how come 
 how come you think 
i used to really like ramses 
i wanted to become him 
but it turns out he s a real douche 
well  win the battle jam this week
and you can fight him yourself 
forget it 
what 
because i can t go on living a lie 
earth to steven 
i m a friar 
i m not for that world 
the orphans  they need me 
and i have forsaken them 
i got no groceries for breakfast
because of you 
i m sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans 
 what did you just say 
 i hate orphans 
 say it again to my face 
 i hate them 
come again 
i hate all the orphans
in the whole world 
i m not listening to you 
you only believe in science 
that s probably why we never win 
we never win because you are fat 
buenos días  sister 
so  what you cooking 
breakfast 
ignacio  you have a responsibility
to these children 
i know 
well  where have you been 
i ve been gone because i had
a lot of church y opportunities lately 
outside of the orphanage 
like what  where were you last night 
to tell you the truth 
i went to a wrestling match 
you went to watch a wrestling match 
kind of 
you are a man of the cloth 
lucha libre  it s a sin 
but why 
because those men fight for vanity 
for money 
for false pride 
yes  it s terrible  terrible 
but is it always a sin to fight 
no 
lf you fight for something noble 
or for someone who needs your help 
only then will god bless you in battle 
you must pray for forgiveness 
excuse me  ignacio 
precious father 
why have you given me
this desire to wrestle
and then made me
such a stinky warrior 
have i focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants 
wait a second 
maybe you want me to fight
and give everything i win
to the little ones who have nothing
so they can have better foods
and a better life 
yeah  maybe that 
okay  if i win tonight at the battle jam 
i will know that you bless my mission
and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you 
i smell cookies 
flame  flame 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
roll  you fool 
flame  flame  flame 
yes  it s true 
i am nacho  the luchador 
who 
maybe you have seen me on tv 
nacho 
no  this is forbidden 
i knew it 
he is not a man of god 
tonight 
i will fight
the seven strongest men in town 
maybe the world 
and i will win
because our heavenly father
will be in the ring with me 
and he and i will win 10 000 pesos 
and with it 
i will buy the orphans a big bus
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that 
i m serious 
nipple twist 
you can t win them all 
nacho 
where are you going 
there is no place for me
in this world  chanchito 
i don t belong out there
and i don t belong in here 
so i m going into the wilderness 
probably to die 
well  you might need this 
my mother gave it to me
before she died 
it was her lucky machete 
you can have it 
i hope to see you again  little chancho 
maybe in the next life 
how did you find me here 
i saw you from the village 
i have some news 
silencio isn t going to be able
to fight ramses 
he got injured 
silencio bruised his bunions 
they are swollen really hard 
he s not gonna be able to fight tonight 
you were second place 
you get to fight ramses 
but i have given up wrestling 
nacho  you are a great fighter 
and you got something
none of these guys have 
the childrens need a real hero 
but i thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world 
not anymore 
i like them 
and they need you  nacho 
okay 
dear sister  i know
you probably hate my guts by now
and already believe that i must have
died long ago in the wilderness 
but you are wrong  i m still alive 
tonight i ll be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived 
the great ramses 
i know you don t like wrestling 
but know that i am leaving
all my monies to the orphans 
and if i die in the ring  know that
i always loved you as a brother in god 
ignacio 
p s  lf we didn t end up taking
our vows of celibacy 
we could maybe get married
and have a family with some niños 
but  you know  whatever 
hug  hug  kiss  kiss 
hug  hug  big kiss 
little hug  kiss  kiss  little kiss 
ramses is the number one 
his legs are number one 
his eyes are number one 
his muscles are number one 
ramses is the number one 
while i was in the wilderness
i wrote a song for encarnación
in my mind 
 shall i sing it for you 
 sure 
when the fantasy has ended
and all the children are gone
something good inside me
helps me to carry on
i ate some bugs
i ate some grass
i used my hand
to wipe my tears
to kiss your mouth
i d break my vow
no  no  no
no  no  no way  josé
unless you want to
then we d break our vows together
encarnación
encarnación
encarnación
encarnación
they are ready for you now 
nacho  nacho  nacho 
maybe we should pray 
dear lord  please bless nacho
with nutrients and strength 
 amen 
 amen
