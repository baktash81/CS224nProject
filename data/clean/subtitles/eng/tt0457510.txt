every day
so you enjoy yourself here
at the brotherhood
the children i love the children
they are my heart

but they dont give me money
for fresh ingredients
and they dont think i know a buttload
of crap about the gospel but i do
okay
today i saw a man in town
people were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies
sometimes i would like
that kind of respect
who was this man

and the clothes
and the free creams and lotions
but my life is good

where is your robe ignacio
it was stinky
but these are my recreation clothes
they look expensive

the appearance of riches
but beneath the clothes we find a man
and beneath a man
we find his nucleus
nucleus

those guys just looked at you
hey cant you see this womans a nun

his eagle eggs possess
magical powers
you could become the greatest fighter

okay my friend this ones yours
what
this one yours
i am singing at the party
i am singing
its my turn to sing at the party
everyone is dancing

he does not dance at the parties
ramses is number one
he knows the secrets of desire
ramses is the one
he puts the people all on fire
ramses
steven
come here
that party was lame
i hate that place
hey
take it easy
it sucks to be me right now
how come
how come you think
i used to really like ramses
i wanted to become him
but it turns out hes a real douche
well win the battle jam this week
and you can fight him yourself
forget it
what
because i cant go on living a lie
earth to steven
im a friar
im not for that world
the orphans they need me
and i have forsaken them
i got no groceries for breakfast
because of you
im sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans
what did you just say
i hate orphans
say it again to my face
i hate them
come again
i hate all the orphans
in the whole world
im not listening to you
you only believe in science
thats probably why we never win
we never win because you are fat
buenos días sister
so what you cooking
breakfast
ignacio you have a responsibility
to these children
i know
well where have you been
ive been gone because i had
a lot of churchy opportunities lately
outside of the orphanage
like what where were you last night
to tell you the truth
i went to a wrestling match
you went to watch a wrestling match
kind of
you are a man of the cloth
lucha libre its a sin
but why
because those men fight for vanity
for money
for false pride
yes its terrible terrible
but is it always a sin to fight
no
lf you fight for something noble
or for someone who needs your help
only then will god bless you in battle
you must pray for forgiveness
excuse me ignacio
precious father
why have you given me
this desire to wrestle
and then made me
such a stinky warrior
have i focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants
wait a second
maybe you want me to fight
and give everything i win
to the little ones who have nothing
so they can have better foods
and a better life
yeah maybe that
okay if i win tonight at the battle jam
i will know that you bless my mission
and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you
i smell cookies
flame flame
no no no no no no no no
roll you fool
flame flame flame
yes its true
i am nacho the luchador
who
maybe you have seen me on tv
nacho
no this is forbidden
i knew it
he is not a man of god
tonight
i will fight
the seven strongest men in town
maybe the world
and i will win
because our heavenly father
will be in the ring with me
and he and i will win 10000 pesos
and with it
i will buy the orphans a big bus
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that
im serious
nipple twist
you cant win them all
nacho
where are you going
there is no place for me
in this world chanchito
i dont belong out there
and i dont belong in here
so im going into the wilderness
probably to die
well you might need this
my mother gave it to me
before she died
it was her lucky machete
you can have it
i hope to see you again little chancho
maybe in the next life
how did you find me here
i saw you from the village
i have some news
silencio isnt going to be able
to fight ramses
he got injured
silencio bruised his bunions
they are swollen really hard
hes not gonna be able to fight tonight
you were second place
you get to fight ramses
but i have given up wrestling
nacho you are a great fighter
and you got something
none of these guys have
the childrens need a real hero
but i thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world
not anymore
i like them
and they need you nacho
okay
dear sister i know
you probably hate my guts by now
and already believe that i must have
died long ago in the wilderness
but you are wrong im still alive
tonight ill be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived
the great ramses
i know you dont like wrestling
but know that i am leaving
all my monies to the orphans
and if i die in the ring know that
i always loved you as a brother in god
ignacio
ps lf we didnt end up taking
our vows of celibacy
we could maybe get married
and have a family with some niños
but you know whatever
hug hug kiss kiss
hug hug big kiss
little hug kiss kiss little kiss
ramses is the number one
his legs are number one
his eyes are number one
his muscles are number one
ramses is the number one
while i was in the wilderness
i wrote a song for encarnación
in my mind
shall i sing it for you
sure
when the fantasy has ended
and all the children are gone
something good inside me
helps me to carry on
i ate some bugs
i ate some grass
i used my hand
to wipe my tears
to kiss your mouth
id break my vow
no no no
no no no way josé
unless you want to
then wed break our vows together
encarnación
encarnación
encarnación
encarnación
they are ready for you now
nacho nacho nacho
maybe we should pray
dear lord please bless nacho
with nutrients and strength
