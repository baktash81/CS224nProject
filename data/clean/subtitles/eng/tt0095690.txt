yeah
ok phoebe
what
im goin upstairs ok
ok
dont go out the porch
wow this place is huge
not bad for a summer cottage
actually the original house
was built in 1880
by a wealthy merchant named elias
montrose for his english bride elizabeth
watch your step
they were married in london
after a whirlwind romance
its gorgeous
what a view
oh id put a telescope right out here
this is where elias would watch his ships
come in and unload their treasures
like what
teas and spices from ceylon
silks pearls sapphires from india
i thought the only things that came
through mystic were lobster and cod
the story has a sad ending
elias returned to mystic
and elizabeth stayed in london
to settle her affairs
on her way here her ship was lost at sea
and old elias spent all the rest
of the days of his life
watching for her ship
they say you can still hear his ghost
walking on this balcony on stormy nights
of course it could be this squeaky board
are you gonna fix it
wouldnt dare
there she is that was gonna be
my wedding present from bill
it used to be called the rose
after his mom
the man is a prince jo
miller lite i take it back  the mans a god
dais he keeps that there
for him and the guys

kat look theres a comet right there

a comet looks like a tadpole its got
a round head and a long blazing tail

to help them determine
their positions at sea

no roads or signposts
or gas stations
where you can ask for directions
hi kat
now well show what its like
to toss around at sea
with the stars your only hope
of getting back home
how would you find your way
if you had made a study of the skies
as ancient seafarers did
you would realise that
at a given date and time
each star marks a particular point in the
a particular
a particular point in the sky
so what you would do is measure
each point each star with a sextant

i worked in a pizza place one summer
up at the cape remember mom

with being a waitress
a noble profession right
certainly a profession at any rate

just what is it you do
chuck
its all right polly

english
i didnt mean your friend

aunt tweedy
you cant even train
your own husband to sleep at home
and dads big frustration in life
is that he cant train me
isnt that right dad
charlie
everyone knows i cant cut the mustard
you listen to me
if you cant train a golden boy like me
theres no way youre gonna train
a dumb portagee
i said thats enough

they were just being themselves
bring home your poor portagee girlfriend
for dinner shake up the family a little
thats not true
im poor and i hate it i admit it
i even thought i was desperate

a hole in the wall
called the mystic pizza
moron
the atmosphere was rustic
the service was oversolicitous
is that good
now i am not a pizza person
i am not particularly
fond of cheesy cuisine
and this pizza is
how shall i say this in a word
superb
i ordered the house speciality
the mystic pizza mystic indeed
exactly the right blend
of cheese and tomatoes and spices
that i cant quite identify
you bet your ass you cant
thats the mystic pizza
in mystic connecticut
i have to give them my highest rating
four stars
and you thought the man was a moron
hello mystic pizza
