  yeah 
  ok  phoebe 
  what 
  i m goin  upstairs  ok 
  ok 
  don t go out the porch 
  wow  this place is huge 
  not bad for a summer cottage 
actually  the original house
was built in 1880
by a wealthy merchant named elias
montrose for his english bride  elizabeth 
watch your step 
they were married in london
after a whirlwind romance 
it s gorgeous 
what a view 
oh  i d put a telescope right out here 
this is where elias would watch his ships
come in and unload their treasures 
  like what 
  teas and spices from ceylon 
silks  pearls  sapphires from india 
i thought the only things that came
through mystic were lobster and cod 
the story has a sad ending 
elias returned to mystic
and elizabeth stayed in london
to settle her affairs 
on her way here  her ship was lost at sea 
and old elias spent all the rest
of the days of his life
watching for her ship 
they say you can still hear his ghost
walking on this balcony on stormy nights 
of course  it could be this squeaky board 
are you gonna fix it 
wouldn t dare 
there she is  that was gonna be
my wedding present from bill 
it used to be called the rose 
after his mom 
the man is a prince  jo 
miller lite  i take it back   the man s a god 
dais  he keeps that there
for him and the guys 
  dais  he s not gonna like that 
  jojo  relax  trust me

bill did not have such a gorgeous body 
  yeah  right 
  no  i mean it 
it would make things so much easier 
i wouldn t think about him all the time 
gosh  you know something  i get really
turned on just looking at his wrists 
  his wrists 
  yes  they re so thick and strong 
  maybe something s the matter with me 
  i think so 
  i think it s called being in love 
  oh  no 
  are you saying i shoulda married him 
  no  she s not 
kat  look  there s a comet  right there 
  no  that s just a shooting star 
  it s thrilling 
a comet looks like a tadpole  it s got
a round head and a long blazing tail 
i know what one looks like 
a sperm  a big sperm 
she s got one on the ceiling 
she goes to sleep every night
with a giant sperm flying over her head 
you know what  ten years from now 
she s gonna be a famous astrologer

to help them determine
their positions at sea

to toss around at sea
with the stars your only hope
of getting back home 
how would you find your way 
if you had made a study of the skies 
as ancient seafarers did 
you would realise that
at a given date and time 
each star marks a particular point in the   
a particular   
a particular point in the sky 
so what you would do is measure
each point  each star  with a sextant

  you still waitressin  at the pizza 
  teresa 
  yes  sir 
  how s your lobster 
it s really delicious 
charlie didn t tell us that
you were in the pizza business  daisy 
mrs windsor and i consider ourselves
pizza connoisseurs 
  really 
  i worked in a pizza place one summer 
up at the cape  remember  mom 
there s nothing wrong
with being a waitress 
a noble profession  right 
certainly a profession  at any rate 
  as opposed to what i do 
  just what is it you do 
  chuck   
  it s all right  polly 
i so rarely get to meet a man of leisure 
much less a close relative 
well  i owe it all to you  dad 
you gave me all the advantages
that you never had 
when dad was my age 
he was a steampipe fitter 
  show her the calluses 
  cut it out  charlie 
who would like more
sour cream on their potato 
oh  i do  please 
  i m so sorry 
  it s all right  teresa 
these portuguese girls
are very hard to train 
i had one once who barely spoke   
  english 
  i didn t mean your friend 
  so what did you mean 
  charles 
i m just clearin  the air  dad 
aunt tweedy   
you can t even train
your own husband to sleep at home 
and dad s big frustration in life
is that he can t train me 
  isn t that right  dad 
  charlie 
  everyone knows i can t cut the mustard 
  you listen to me   
if you can t train a golden boy like me 
there s no way you re gonna train
a dumb portagee 
  i said that s enough 
  ok  so i guess dinner is over 
  dammit  charlie 
  daisy 
charles  charles  you come back here 
dais  look  i m sorry  all right 
but they deserved it 
  i couldn t let  em do that to you 
  me  you did that for yourself 
they were bein  real jerks 
the only jerk at that table was you 
they were just being themselves 
bring home your poor portagee girlfriend
for dinner  shake up the family a little 
  that s not true 
  i m poor  and i hate it  i admit it 
i even thought i was desperate 
but i m not half as desperate as you are 
i would never use you
to get at somebody 
your father didn t cheat his way out of
law school  you did that all on your own 
deal with it  junior 
you re not even good enough for me 
teresa  can you give me a ride 
i wanna go home 
kat

i am not particularly
fond of cheesy cuisine 
and this pizza is   
how shall i say this  in a word   
superb

the mystic pizza  mystic indeed 
exactly the right blend
of cheese and tomatoes and spices
that i can t quite identify 
you bet your ass you can t 
that s the mystic pizza 
in mystic  connecticut 
i have to give them my highest rating 
four stars 
and you thought the man was a moron

maintain your own identity
