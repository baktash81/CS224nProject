  oh grace  this is tina 
  hi  i am tina 
  nice to meet you 
  this is my brother s wife  grace 
we re all in the dining room 
oh my god  she s so pretty 
  hey  guys 
  hey 
this is tina 
she s an old friend 
  actually  we just met an hour ago 
  yeah  i think an hour and a half 
you got quite a charmer here 
he s hiding inside that shell
putting its head in the shell
and its arms and legs 
and when the thing that s
scaring him goes like this   
the turtle doesn t come out so the   
thing that scares the turtle
goes away coz it thinks it s a rock 
  you are a smart girl 
  happy birthday 
yes  you are 
  be careful 
  everyone needs some reassurance 
  everyone s different  dad  you know 
  stop playing with your cake 
  what do you mean 
  i just think it s necessary that   
  everybody has someone to listen to them 
  well  you know  these days   
they need therapy if they stab their toe 
these guys are marines 
they re trained for it 
they re marines but they re still people and   
i don t think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody 
  what do you think they are trained for 
  i think that they re   what 
  they re trained to use deadly force 
  trained to kill 
but nobody can really be
trained to watch someone die 
  just something that  not taught
