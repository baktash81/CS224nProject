the turtle doesnt come out so the
thing that scares the turtle
goes away coz it thinks its a rock
you are a smart girl
happy birthday

everyones different dad you know
stop playing with your cake

everybody has someone to listen to them
well you know these days
they need therapy if they stab their toe
these guys are marines
theyre trained for it
theyre marines but theyre still people and
i dont think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody
what do you think they are trained for

theyre trained to use deadly force
trained to kill

trained to watch someone die
just something that not taught
