that its very existence
remained a secret of time and space
but now in the last few years
of the 20th century
the visitor was returning
the citizens of earth would get an extra
christmas present this year
as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet
scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions
something not
seen on earth for 65 million years
indeed not since the time
that the dinosaurs
disappeared virtually overnight
there were a few who saw this as more
than just a coincidence
but most didnt

just to play music for you
well its time to reach into
the old mailbag here got a letter from
beam me up scotty
okay girls hold it right there
you the blonde get into the light
wait
why dont you just let my sister go
and maybe you and i
can work something out
im not going anywhere
shut up
you got the wrong idea
you into the light
ill give you to five one two no
all right lets try it this way
five four three
okay okay
do you get a lot of dates this way
open your eyes
okay
hey i know what youre thinking but
that youre a cretin
sweetheart you havent seen those
freakedout zombies running around here
yeah i was jumped by one
well you got off lucky
me and this girl pulled into town
this morning
you dont work here
no i drive a truck
i was heading to san diego
with this girl i picked up
we were looking for a gas station
thats when we spotted one of those
whatever they are
looked like it was eating
looked like it was eating a cat
a dead cat
semidead
whod want to eat a live cat
beats the shit out of me
this girl freaked out
took off running
i spotted her about 20 minutes later
looked like one of those things had
what
torn her apart
oh god
larry
oh shit
whats with her
i think shes going to be
sick or something
a guy she knew
same thing might have happened
is it safe around here do you think
yeah
i checked it out
swell
are you all right
my names hector
whats yours
just leave me alone okay
look i i know we got off
on the wrong foot
but considering what the alternative is
i think we should try to get along
what do you say
listen this is no time
for an attitude problem
your little sister seems to be taking this
a lot better than you
thats cause she doesnt know
whats going on
and you do i suppose
whatever is going on isnt just here
its everywhere
she thinks were gonna be rescued
that our dads gonna come back
from honduras
with the goddamn green berets
she could be right
give us a break hector
where did you spend the night last night
i spent the night in the back of my truck
with the girl i picked up
what else do you want to know
skip it
steels gotta be the answer
if sam spent the night
in the lawn storage shed
what
again im an employee i cant
just our way of saying
merry christmas to you from all of
testing one two three four
this is samantha belmont
onethird owner of
the greater los angeles basin speaking
you guys
hey is anybody there
where did you get this
a dime store
beats me it was given to me
yeah well it might be all right
for date night in the barrio
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside
were gonna need
a little more stopping power
date night in the barrio
here are other changes
and heres some other changes
most of you guys had finals this week
huh later
they are history canceled
theyre history theyre cancelled
the legal drinking age is now 10
but you will need id lets be real
ill be taking take requests from all you
teenage comet zombies on the
hit line
thats 5554487
get it 555hits
do you know where the armed forces
reserve centre is at los alamitos
yeah
my dad used to take us there
for target practice
they store automatic weapons there
you know how to use them
come on hector
the mac10 submachine gun
was practically designed for housewives
i got a call
it came in on the hit line
hello
hello
it went dead
did they say they were okay
i dont know
they said they were in the desert
the desert what desert was it
i dont know
shit think
why dont you just pull your gun
on her maybe you can scare it out of her
they said they were like part of
a think tank or research group or something
where was it in this state
i forget
okay lets take it real slow
did they mention a town
some place they were near
like maybe blythe bishop
what about edwards air force base
if i knew id tell you
i didnt expect the call you know
i didnt take notes or something
just try and remember
if you think im not telling you
something on purpose
well if theyll stay put
we can get them
leave anything out
from a psychological standpoint
the radio station represents
a link to normalcy
i dont think theyll wander far
as long as its operating
dr carter id just like to say upfront
im opposed to this
there is no reason for us to bring
those people
or any other survivors back here
what about the disintegration factor
you just want to let that happen
we dont know that
the condition is progressive
i think weve established that audrey
partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect
but progression is steady in any case
drying of the body fluids
get to the point oscar
weve heard this a thousand times
ultimately there is nothing left
but calcium dust
right so there isnt even enough hope
to warrant bringing anybody back here
so what youre saying is
we shouldnt even try
right
we dont want to be caught in the city
after dark well leave tomorrow
and weve had an indication
of some survivors
in san bernardino as well
four maybe five
wait a minute
wait girls just shut up
samantha did they say
anything else anything
yeah they said
be careful on the street
because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit
what happened to doris
is happening to them only slower
and like theyre dangerous
like what happened to larry
youre not going to blame me
because the phone went dead
im not the phone company
nobody is the phone company anymore
what
cops
where were you guys earlier
oh shit my license
oh shit
i know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something
but im really glad to see
the weekend comet sale
everything must go
big savings on tuners turntables
car stereos
also demos of great damaged items
this weekend only henrys
stereo warehouse fourth and alameda
free coffee for the adults
free balloons for the kids
this is for your step mom
you little punk
ahh theyre here theyre here
where
whats wrong
its okay ive got her
youve got her
yeah i got her
sammy sam its only a dream
i know
i know
expand your career
horizons for a clearer view of
is there anything i can do
im fine
interstate technologies
is an equalopportunity employer
looks like the weather is shaping up
for a great weekend
you know its hard to believe that theres
only 11 more shopping days till christmas
good luck finding a parking space within
hitchhiking distance of the malls too
you know how jammed it can get
is she okay
yeah i guess so
come on in have a seat
listen i have to go
to san diego tomorrow
why
my mom
some friends my sister
but you know theyre gone
i know but i still have to find out
i mean you guys know for sure
but i dont know
did you have like a close family
yeah pretty close
and you
not anymore
my real mom hung around until my dad
came back from vietnam then she split
so its been mostly me and sam and dad
and the 3rd special forces
smoke bomb hill fort bragg
but then around about
sixth or seventh grade
it became real obvious
that we werent boys
that we were never going to go
to ranger school
so i guess dad figured there was
nothing more to offer us
so he found us a new mom
and went off looking for a war
what about the em
the guy larry
oh he and i werent going steady
or anything like that
look dont go to san diego okay
i have to
but ill be back
please okay
what will you give me if i come back
texas
could give you florida florida and texas
florida texas and hawaii
hawaii i wanted hawaii
when i come back
ill take you to dinner
your choice
here
great
see this is the problem
with these things
daddy would have gotten us uzis
the car didnt know the difference
so did you make it with him last night
who
the good humor man who do you think
jeez is that whats bugging you
thats no answer man
no i didnt make it with him last night
why are you so weirded out
oh right reg
why should i be weirded out
my sister who swiped every guy
i ever had my eye on
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freakedout world
mom
mother
mom
i dont know who you are out there
but i have a gun
so if i were you
id split while i had a chance
okay
look kid just stay away
we dont want any
shit
get out of here you little freak
lucky for you i like kids
jeez there goes the neighborhood
shit
audrey whats the code
we found survivors
how long will the blood test take
not long
ive talked with some of the others
and weve decided
that it would be more beneficial
to conduct the blood tests in the field
so i want you to go to la
with the rest of the group
whatever the majority wants
you dont seem to hold
majority rule in very high regard
if somethings wrong its wrong
majority rule doesnt have anything
to do with it
but it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group
which is to survive
youll grant me that
the core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility
thats about the twelfth can
youve downed this morning
thirsty
yeah well whatre you gonna do
when your complexion freaks out
dermatologist is dead you know
i know and im getting a rash
or something too
oh god you and your rashes
hey im sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous
so do you like him
come on sam
im just interested
yeah well i guess so
i mean hes nice
there was this new guy at school
paul morgan
he transferred from taft junior
oh i dont hang around
with juniors much
i liked him
i mean he was from taft
but he was nice
kathy said he was probably
gonna ask me out
huh kathy
she was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out some way
to keep her parents from finding out
this is really a lucky break for her
no wonder im breaking out
think we could go home and change
why dont we get a little creative
what
do you have your a
do you have your mastercard on you
no
good cause you dont need it
the stores are open
hey reg which do you like better
this
second one yeah definitely
how come
cause itll stay in style longer
come on
i guess youre right actually
yeah we got to think
of these things you know
well lets do it
you know ive been thinking
dont set any dangerous precedents
what if hectors got
the same problem we have
such as
such as no guys
what
really
i mean what if hectors gay
im sure
think it over
you said he didnt
come on to you last night
so
so that means that the last guy on earth
is either a gentleman or a fag
i mean what are the odds in la
things could be very interesting
around here regina
attention shoppers
i trust youve got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff
whats the matter
lost something
check with lost and found
on the second floor
didnt find this one
you dirty rat
get her boys
woa
bummer
well i think its time
to take the high ground
listen you guys were expecting
some friends here any minute
look you just split now okay
and well tell them not to hurt you
no imagination
look over there
hey
hey
eat glass creeps
how did you like that
you guys are a bunch of wimps
you cant hit anything
hi
get her
knock that shit off
hello out there in television land
all right heres the deal
if bachelorette number one
isnt out here in half a tick
im going to ice bachelorette number two
got it
come on
let her go
im sorry miss i cant have you
holding one of my people hostage
even if you pull the trigger
i can still take him out and you
come on willy she means it
miss youre not getting the point
i cant have you holding
one of my people hostage
youre crazy
im not crazy
i just dont give a fuck
what do you think 20 30 minutes
no more
they could be anywhere by now
lets go back
lets apply a little deductive reasoning
deductive reasoning
where would adolescents
with nothing to do go
see we worked really hard to
get ahead in this business girls
and we dont get shit for it
but we do it
because we know we can work
our way up through the system
and the system works
why just a few days ago
we were only stock boys
now we own the store
the american way
and then this happens
what are you talking about
im talking about you
coming in here and ripping us off
what do you want
you want us to pay for it what
you wouldnt believe
what we want from you
in your worst nightmare
you wouldnt believe
lets play a game
its called scary noises
this is the closest shopping arcade
but the whole area
is an absolute monument
to consumerism
all we can do is hope
check all the fiords
including the basement
isnt that a scary noise
wanna hear it again
gosh the suspense is killing me
lets do it again
an eticket attraction
lets do it again
now wait a minute
i dont think
theres really a bullet in here
no now see there its loaded
i just needed
to be a little more patient
i think this is it girls
i really do
were not with these guys
really like we just met them
an hour ago
i mean look at this stuff
look at this skirt
its ironic of all the great minds
of the world all the great intellects
who should survive or almost survive
im so thirsty
i dont have to see the result
of the blood test
i can guess
what they say about that one
youre right
it would be senseless to take her back
look ill stay and take care of it
then if this hector person shows up
i can run tests on him too
of course it would be out of the question
to let you remain by yourself
ill stay here with you
listen thanks for suggesting
that i wait for hector
i mean i know reggiell probably get him
but id like to have a shot at it
samantha i need you to lie down
hectors not exactly a fox
but considering whats left
hes not bad
he sounds cute is he coming back
yeah
but we should wait for him
at the radio station
thats where hell go
whats that
im going to give you something
for what
well your skins
been a little irritated
yeah a rash
it could be a rash
but it could also be something else
thats one of the main symptoms of
the comet no
see i always get rashes
like when i have a fight with doris
or i break up with a boyfriend
its nerves
and you know the way things have
been going around here lately
im surprised i dont
look like strawberry jello
but if i do have that stuff
this will get rid of it right
yeah
god you had me worried
dont worry just a pinch now
ow
so you guys are like geniuses right
yeah i thought so
we have a couple of
geniuses at my school
yeah
yeah
is
is that it
what did you want me to do oscar
take her out back
and shoot her in the head
i simply meant
i was glad it was painless
i dont think we have to stay around
she didnt think that he was coming back
i feel we can wait
but
i feel the radio station
is the more logical place
listen oscar you were right
about the condition being progressive
but it is also accelerating
apparently
we dont have weeks
we have maybe hours
i dont know
we have a commitment
but i do know i dont have enough
to debate the issue i am not going to be
a party to taking anybody else back
you have to live up to it
what do you expect me to do oscar
go for my gun
of course not
its 450 fm in the pm
im steve labeau
and youre listening to 50000 watts
of rock nroll at the tower of power
over the city of angels
reggie merry christmas
reggie
samantha
hi
hi
did you happen to see two girls
running around here
one is a cheerleader
im not thinking straight
i wrote everything down
but i think i misspelled it
that pad on the table
you need this
no thanks i have one
it seems to be
the perfect christmas gift this year
im going to miss christmas
permanently
i want you to know that
i thought they were talking hypothetically
until they found the first survivors
then they really did it
some of those survivors were just kids
hey wait a minute
whats all this about blood
they think they can generate a serum
a serum
we were exposed not a lot just enough
they left the ventilating ducts wide open
the fans going
very scientific
very stupid
in 36 hours
you will be able to vacuum up
the last of them from the carpet
hey you know what
she was right you are cute
santa claus
hey
have you ever had hepatitis
darned tags
you have a pair of scissors
no have you ever had hepatitis
cute kids
they part of you guys
no theyre survivors just like you are
neat girl huh
if you like the type
come on kids come with me
have you ever had hepatitis
no i had mono once though
caught it from this guy named randy sharp
anemia
no
are you pregnant
no thought i was once though
thats not important
thats what you think
it was the longest three weeks
of my life
you know i cant remember
how much blood were we expected
to get from these people
oh 300 ccs yes thats it
that cant be right if we draw 300 ccs
a day theyll expire altogether
no i dont think so
now that weve
terminated brain functions
i mean theyre braindead
all they can do now
is manufacture blood
well maybe
we arent gonna get anything like 300 ccs
out of those children
no but we will out of that teenager
i hope shes just as healthy as she looks
boy did you see her hair
what id give to have hair like that
what is this place
do you have diabetes
i mean is this some sort of
i dont know underground hospital
or what
youre a very strongwilled young lady
cancer
you have cancer
no i am a cancer
i just want to know where i am
and what im doing here
oops oh gosh
could you hand me that arterial
got it
well its up to the respirators now
why dont we prep the children
when were finished with them
we can start on that girl
theyre so cute
i love working with kids
yeah dont forget the lights
are you taking any medication
have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours
wheres my sister
dr carter may i see you a moment
all right
i mean she should be here by now
shouldnt she
even if hector didnt show up
your sisters dead
what
i realize this comes as a shock
but she had been exposed and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway
it was quite painless
i can assure you
you both have nice strong hearts
are we going to get shots
no
no shots i promise
audrey
theyre not back yet
