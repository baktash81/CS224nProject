that its very existence
remained a secret of time and space 
but now  in the last few years
of the 20th century 
the visitor was returning 
the citizens of earth would get an extra
christmas present this year    
as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet 
scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions 
something not
seen on earth for 65 million years 
indeed  not since the time   
that the dinosaurs
disappeared  virtually overnight 
there were a few who saw this as more
than just a coincidence

every friday night 
a great way to start a super weekend
here in the southland 
get down 
  are you sure this is the radio station 
  yeah  just go on in 
well  don t push 
do you think whatever happened 
happened everywhere 
like in burbank or places like that 
we ll ask the dj 
he does the news  doesn t he 
search me  i always change the channel
when the news comes on 
here s something in here 
so  where is he 
i mean  somebody has to run this stuff 
don t they 
we ve got trouble  not us 
that s the name of the song 
and i m steve labeau
trapped inside your radio 
the guy who really cares about you 
i mean  who else would sit
in this little box every day
just to play music for you 
well  it s time to reach into
the old mailbag here  got a letter from   
beam me up  scotty 
okay  girls  hold it right there 
  you  the blonde  get into the light 
  wait 
why don t you just let my sister go 
and maybe you and i
can work something out 
  i m not going anywhere 
  shut up 
you got the wrong idea 
you  into the light 
i ll give you to five  one  two    no 
all right  let s try it this way 
five  four  three   
okay  okay 
do you get a lot of dates this way 
open your eyes 
okay 
hey  i know what you re thinking  but   
  that you re a cretin 
sweetheart  you haven t seen those
freaked out zombies running around here 
yeah  i was jumped by one 
well  you got off lucky 
me and this girl pulled into town
this morning 
you don t work here 
no  i drive a truck 
i was heading to san diego
with this girl i picked up 
we were looking for a gas station 
that s when we spotted one of those   
whatever they are 
looked like it was eating   
looked like it was eating a cat 
a dead cat 
semi dead 
who d want to eat a live cat 
beats the shit out of me 
this girl freaked out 
took off running 
i spotted her about 20 minutes later 
  looked like one of those things had   
  what 
torn her apart 
oh  god 
  larry 
  oh  shit 
what s with her 
i think she s going to be
sick or something 
a guy she knew   
same thing might have happened 
  is it safe around here  do you think 
  yeah 
i checked it out 
swell 
are you all right 
my name s hector 
  what s yours 
  just leave me alone  okay 
look  i    i know we got off
on the wrong foot 
but considering what the alternative is 
i think we should try to get along 
what do you say 
listen  this is no time
for an attitude problem 
your little sister seems to be taking this
a lot better than you 
that s  cause she doesn t know
what s going on 
and you do  i suppose 
whatever is going on isn t just here 
it s everywhere 
she thinks we re gonna be rescued 
that our dad s gonna come back
from honduras
with the goddamn green berets 
she could be right 
give us a break  hector 
where did you spend the night last night 
i spent the night in the back of my truck
with the girl i picked up 
  what else do you want to know 
  skip it 
steel s gotta be the answer 
if sam spent the night
in the lawn storage shed   
what 
   again  i m an employee  i can t 
just our way of saying
merry christmas to you from all of   
testing  one  two  three  four 
this is samantha belmont 
one third owner of
the greater los angeles basin  speaking 
you guys 
hey  is anybody there 
where did you get this 
a dime store 
beats me  it was given to me 
yeah  well  it might be all right
for date night in the barrio 
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside 
we re gonna need
a little more stopping power 
date night in the barrio 
here are other changes 
and here s some other changes 
most of you guys had finals this week 
huh  later 
they are history  canceled 
they re history  they re cancelled 
the legal drinking age is now 10 
but  you will need id  let s be real 
i ll be taking take requests from all you
teenage comet zombies on the   
hit line 
that s 555 4487 
get it  555 hits 
do you know where the armed forces
reserve centre is at los alamitos 
yeah 
my dad used to take us there
for target practice 
they store automatic weapons there 
  you know how to use them 
come on  hector 
the mac 10 submachine gun
was practically designed for housewives 
i got a call 
it came in on the hit line 
  hello 
hello 
it went dead 
  did they say they were okay 
i don t know 
they said they were in the desert 
  the desert  what desert was it 
  i don t know 
shit  think 
why don t you just pull your gun
on her  maybe you can scare it out of her 
they said they were  like  part of
a think tank or research group or something 
where  was it in this state 
  i forget 
  okay  let s take it real slow 
did they mention a town 
some place they were near 
like maybe blythe  bishop 
  what about edwards air force base 
  if i knew  i d tell you 
i didn t expect the call  you know 
i didn t take notes or something 
just try and remember 
if you think i m not telling you
something on purpose   
well  if they ll stay put 
we can get them 
   leave anything out 
from a psychological standpoint 
the radio station represents
a link to normalcy 
i don t think they ll wander far
as long as it s operating 
dr  carter  i d just like to say upfront 
i m opposed to this 
there is no reason for us to bring
those people 
or any other survivors back here 
what about the disintegration factor 
you just want to let that happen 
we don t know that
the condition is progressive 
i think we ve established that  audrey 
partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect 
but progression is steady in any case 
drying of the body fluids   
get to the point  oscar 
we ve heard this a thousand times 
ultimately  there is nothing left
but calcium dust 
right  so there isn t even enough hope
to warrant bringing anybody back here 
so  what you re saying is 
we shouldn t even try 
right 
we don t want to be caught in the city
after dark  we ll leave tomorrow 
and we ve had an indication
of some survivors   
in san bernardino as well 
four  maybe five 
wait a minute 
wait  girls  just shut up 
samantha  did they say
anything else  anything 
yeah  they said
be careful on the street 
because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit 
what happened to doris
is happening to them  only slower 
and  like  they re dangerous 
like what happened to larry 
you re not going to blame me
because the phone went dead 
i m not the phone company 
nobody is the phone company anymore 
what 
cops 
where were you guys earlier 
oh  shit  my license 
oh  shit 
i know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something 
but i m really glad to see   
    the weekend comet sale 
everything must go 
big savings on tuners  turntables 
car stereos 
also demos of great damaged items 
this weekend only  henry s
stereo warehouse  fourth and alameda 
free coffee for the adults 
free balloons for the kids 
this is for your step mom 
you little punk 
  ahh  they re here  they re here 
  where 
  what s wrong 
  it s okay  i ve got her 
  you ve got her 
  yeah  i got her 
sammy  sam  it s only a dream 
i know 
i know 
   expand your career
horizons  for a clearer view of   
is there anything i can do 
i m fine 
interstate technologies
is an equal opportunity employer 
looks like the weather is shaping up
for a great weekend 
you know  it s hard to believe that there s
only 11 more shopping days till christmas 
good luck finding a parking space within
hitchhiking distance of the malls  too 
you know how jammed it can get 
  is she okay 
  yeah  i guess so 
come on in  have a seat 
listen  i have to go
to san diego tomorrow 
why 
my mom 
  some friends  my sister 
  but you know they re gone 
i know  but i still have to find out 
i mean  you guys know for sure 
but i don t know 
did you have  like  a close family 
yeah  pretty close 
  and you 
  not anymore 
my real mom hung around until my dad
came back from vietnam  then she split 
so it s been mostly me and sam and dad
and the 3rd special forces 
smoke bomb hill  fort bragg 
but then around about
sixth or seventh grade 
it became real obvious
that we weren t boys 
that we were never going to go
to ranger school 
so i guess dad figured there was
nothing more to offer us 
so he found us a new mom
and went off looking for a war 
what about the em   
the guy  larry 
oh  he and i weren t going steady
or anything like that 
  look  don t go to san diego  okay 
  i have to 
but i ll be back 
please  okay 
what will you give me if i come back 
texas 
could give you florida  florida and texas 
florida  texas and hawaii 
  hawaii  i wanted hawaii 
  when i come back 
i ll take you to dinner 
your choice 
here 
great 
see  this is the problem
with these things 
daddy would have gotten us uzis 
the car didn t know the difference 
so  did you make it with him last night 
  who 
  the good humor man  who do you think 
  jeez  is that what s bugging you 
  that s no answer  man 
no  i didn t make it with him last night 
why are you so weirded out 
oh  right  reg 
why should i be weirded out 
my sister  who swiped every guy
i ever had my eye on
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked out world 
mom 
mother 
mom 
i don t know who you are out there 
but i have a gun 
so if i were you 
i d split while i had a chance 
okay 
look  kid  just stay away 
we don t want any 
shit 
get out of here  you little freak 
lucky for you i like kids 
jeez  there goes the neighborhood 
shit 
audrey  what s the code 
we found survivors 
how long will the blood test take 
not long 
i ve talked with some of the others 
and we ve decided
that it would be more beneficial
to conduct the blood tests in the field 
so i want you to go to la
with the rest of the group 
whatever the majority wants 
you don t seem to hold
majority rule in very high regard 
if something s wrong  it s wrong 
majority rule doesn t have anything
to do with it 
but it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group 
which is to survive 
you ll grant me that 
the core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility 
that s about the twelfth can
you ve downed this morning 
thirsty 
yeah  well  what re you gonna do
when your complexion freaks out 
dermatologist is dead  you know 
i know and i m getting a rash
or something  too 
oh  god  you and your rashes 
hey  i m sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous 
so  do you like him 
  come on  sam 
  i m just interested 
yeah  well  i guess so 
i mean  he s nice 
there was this new guy at school 
paul morgan 
he transferred from taft  junior 
oh  i don t hang around
with juniors much 
i liked him 
i mean  he was from taft 
but  he was nice 
kathy said he was probably
gonna ask me out 
huh  kathy 
she was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out some way
to keep her parents from finding out 
this is really a lucky break for her 
no wonder i m breaking out 
think we could go home and change 
  why don t we get a little creative 
  what 
  do you have your a 
do you have your mastercard on you 
  no 
good   cause you don t need it 
the stores are open 
hey  reg  which do you like better 
this 
second one  yeah  definitely 
  how come 
   cause it ll stay in style longer 
  come on 
  i guess you re right  actually 
yeah  we got to think
of these things  you know 
well  let s do it 
  you know  i ve been thinking 
  don t set any dangerous precedents 
what if hector s got
the same problem we have 
  such as 
  such as  no guys 
  what 
  really 
i mean  what if hector s gay 
  i m sure 
  think it over 
you said he didn t
come on to you last night 
so 
so that means that the last guy on earth
is either a gentleman or a fag 
i mean  what are the odds  in la 
things could be very interesting
around here  regina 
attention  shoppers 
i trust you ve got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff 
what s the matter 
lost something 
check with lost and found
on the second floor 
didn t find this one 
you dirty rat 
get her  boys 
woa 
bummer 
well  i think it s time
to take the high ground 
listen  you guys  we re expecting
some friends here any minute 
look  you just split now  okay 
and we ll tell them not to hurt you 
no imagination 
look  over there 
hey 
  hey 
  eat glass  creeps 
how did you like that 
you guys are a bunch of wimps 
you can t hit anything 
hi 
get her 
knock that shit off 
hello out there in television land 
all right  here s the deal 
if bachelorette number one
isn t out here in half a tick 
i m going to ice bachelorette number two 
got it 
come on 
let her go 
i m sorry  miss  i can t have you
holding one of my people hostage 
even if you pull the trigger 
i can still take him out  and you 
come on  willy  she means it 
miss  you re not getting the point 
i can t have you holding
one of my people hostage 
you re crazy 
i m not crazy 
i just don t give a fuck 
  what do you think  20  30 minutes 
  no more 
they could be anywhere by now 
let s go back 
  let s apply a little deductive reasoning 
  deductive reasoning 
where would adolescents
with nothing to do go 
see  we worked really hard to
get ahead in this business  girls 
and we don t get shit for it 
but we do it   
because we know we can work
our way up through the system 
and the system works
why  just a few days ago 
we were only stock boys 
now we own the store 
the american way 
and then this happens 
what are you talking about 
i m talking about you
coming in here and ripping us off 
what do you want 
you want us to pay for it  what 
you wouldn t believe
what we want from you 
in your worst nightmare 
you wouldn t believe 
let s play a game 
it s called  scary noises  
this is the closest shopping arcade 
but the whole area
is an absolute monument
to consumerism 
all we can do is hope 
check all the fiords 
including the basement 
isn t that a scary noise 
wanna hear it again 
gosh  the suspense is killing me 
let s do it again 
an e ticket attraction 
let s do it again 
now wait a minute 
i don t think
there s really a bullet in here 
no  now  see there  it s loaded 
i just needed
to be a little more patient 
i think this is it  girls 
i really do 
we re not with these guys 
really  like  we just met them
an hour ago 
i mean  look at this stuff 
look at this skirt 
it s ironic  of all the great minds
of the world  all the great intellects 
  who should survive  or almost survive 
  i m so thirsty
i don t have to see the result
of the blood test 
i can guess
what they say about that one 
you re right 
it would be senseless to take her back 
look  i ll stay and take care of it 
then if this hector person shows up 
i can run tests on him  too 
of course  it would be out of the question
to let you remain by yourself 
i ll stay here with you 
listen  thanks for suggesting
that i wait for hector 
i mean  i know reggie ll probably get him 
but i d like to have a shot at it 
samantha  i need you to lie down 
hector s not exactly a fox 
but considering what s left 
he s not bad 
  he sounds cute  is he coming back 
  yeah 
but we should wait for him
at the radio station 
that s where he ll go 
what s that 
  i m going to give you something 
  for what 
well  your skin s
been a little irritated 
yeah  a rash 
it could be a rash 
but it could also be something else 
  that s one of the main symptoms of   
  the comet  no 
see  i always get rashes 
like  when i have a fight with doris 
or i break up with a boyfriend 
it s nerves 
and you know  the way things have
been going around here lately 
i m surprised i don t
look like strawberry jell o 
but if i do have that stuff 
this will get rid of it  right 
  yeah 
  god  you had me worried 
don t worry  just a pinch now 
ow 
so  you guys are  like  geniuses  right 
yeah  i thought so 
we have a couple of
geniuses at my school 
  yeah 
  yeah 
is   
is that it 
what did you want me to do  oscar 
take her out back
and shoot her in the head 
i simply meant
i was glad it was painless 
i don t think we have to stay around 
she didn t think that he was coming back 
i feel we can wait 
but   
i feel the radio station
is the more logical place 
listen  oscar  you were right
about the condition being progressive 
but it is also accelerating 
apparently 
we don t have weeks 
we have maybe hours 
i don t know 
  we have a commitment 
  but i do know i don t have enough
to debate the issue  i am not going to be
a party to taking anybody else back 
you have to live up to it 
what do you expect me to do  oscar 
go for my gun 
of course not 
it s 450 fm in the p m 
i m steve labeau 
and you re listening to 50 000 watts
of rock  n roll at the tower of power
over the city of angels 
reggie  merry christmas 
reggie 
samantha 
hi 
hi 
did you happen to see two girls
running around here 
one is a cheerleader 
i m not thinking straight 
i wrote everything down 
but i think i misspelled it 
that pad on the table 
  you need this 
  no  thanks  i have one 
it seems to be
the perfect christmas gift this year 
i m going to miss christmas 
permanently 
i want you to know that
i thought they were talking hypothetically 
until they found the first survivors 
then they really did it 
some of those survivors were just kids 
hey  wait a minute 
what s all this about blood 
they think they can generate a serum 
  a serum 
  we were exposed  not a lot  just enough 
they left the ventilating ducts wide open 
the fans going 
very scientific 
very stupid 
in 36 hours 
you will be able to vacuum up
the last of them from the carpet 
hey  you know what 
she was right  you are cute 
santa claus 
hey 
have you ever had hepatitis 
darned tags 
you have a pair of scissors 
no  have you ever had hepatitis 
cute kids 
they part of you guys 
no  they re survivors just like you are 
  neat girl  huh 
  if you like the type 
come on  kids  come with me 
have you ever had hepatitis 
no  i had mono once  though 
caught it from this guy named randy sharp 
  anemia 
  no 
  are you pregnant 
  no  thought i was once  though 
  that s not important 
  that s what you think 
it was the longest three weeks
of my life 
you know  i can t remember 
how much blood were we expected
to get from these people 
oh  300 ccs  yes  that s it 
that can t be right  if we draw 300 ccs
a day  they ll expire altogether 
no  i don t think so 
now that we ve
terminated brain functions 
i mean  they re brain dead 
all they can do now
is manufacture blood 
well  maybe 
we aren t gonna get anything like 300 ccs
out of those children 
no  but  we will out of that teenager 
i hope she s just as healthy as she looks 
boy  did you see her hair 
what i d give to have hair like that 
what is this place 
do you have diabetes 
i mean  is this some sort of 
i don t know  underground hospital
or what 
you re a very strong willed young lady 
  cancer 
  you have cancer 
no  i am a cancer 
i just want to know where i am
and what i m doing here 
oops  oh  gosh 
could you hand me that arterial   
got it 
well  it s up to the respirators now 
why don t we prep the children 
when we re finished with them 
we can start on that girl 
they re so cute 
i love working with kids 
yeah  don t forget the lights 
are you taking any medication 
have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours 
where s my sister 
dr  carter  may i see you a moment 
all right 
i mean  she should be here by now 
shouldn t she 
even if hector didn t show up 
your sister s dead 
  what 
  i realize this comes as a shock 
but she had been exposed  and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway 
it was quite painless 
i can assure you 
you both have nice  strong hearts 
  are we going to get shots 
  no 
no shots  i promise 
  audrey 
  they re not back yet 
listen  we may have a situation
on our hands here 
i can t locate rogers
anyplace in the compound 
i can t rule out the possibility that
he may already have gone into transition 
we can t wait for audrey 
you re gonna have to start
with the children and that one in there 
we need blood to develop the serum 
we don t have enough for everyone 
we re not robots  doctor  we re not
all going to fall over at one time 
some of us will last a little longer 
while others of us
have more immediate needs 
you re smart 
you can figure that out 
psychology is not an exact science 
but  my god  man 
anybody can add two and two 
i m very sorry about your sister 
it s a tragedy 
it truly is 
and i can understand your hostility 
but no matter how upset you are 
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won t solve anything 
i mean  striking out at inanimate objects
is really quite childish 
even you should be able to realize that 
jerk 
howdy  partner  how you doing 
  who are you 
  the name is hec  hec gomez 
hey  them s real fine duds you got there
