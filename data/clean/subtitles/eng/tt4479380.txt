psychopaths often
inherit the trait
and are incapable of love 
they manage their relationships
with clinical precision 
succeeding
in all walks of life 
psychopaths that can learn
to love are even more rare 
as rare as a black swan 
it s time 
i m not dead yet 
naming a successor is a sign of
strength  not weakness  father 
you ve always had more ambition
than your brother 
 woman  olly is more ambitious
than you think 
 man  there s a difference
between ambition and pride 
he s just trying to impress you 
well  no matter how hard
your brother tries 
he ll always be replaceable 
 woman  boy  does he know
you feel that way 
i don t care 
and neither should you 
 olly  last one of the day 
boys  let s light her up 
stay professional 
  morning

yeah  well  do you blame  em 
no  i mean  i wouldn t wanna
live in that fucking shithole 
well  they want more money 
clearly  alright 
increase the offer 
but if it goes noisy 
that s what you re here for 
grace 
what s a fair price
for that village 
two hundred 
ok  well  if they refuse 
cut their tongues out 
 chuckles 
  is she capable of that 
  of course 
well  if she fucks it up 
it s down to you 
i just need that village
cleared today  alright 
hey  pop  is it unprofessional
to burn him 
my god  olly  you really do

enemy front 
 woman screams 
 man shouts

go  go  go  go  up the hill 
 men shouting 
 man over radio  switch fire
right  switch fire right  out 
  oh  it s just a scratch 
   groans 
you re good 
 men shouting 
 gunfire continues 
they don t want money 
they want a fight 
make a decision  make it now 
kill the men and the boys 
and leave the women
to spread the fear 
 gunshot 
 gunshot 
 screaming 
 screams 
 shouting 
 screaming 
welcome home  thomas 
great to see you  callum 
looking good as always 
you staying for christmas 
i just came
to pick something up 
that s my job  tell me what you
need  i ll organize some tea 
thanks  but i d rather do it
myself  it s in nanna s box 
  well  that is a surprise 
  to me as well 
be nice to have some laughter
in the house 
 thomas  early days 
i plan to keep my flat
but weekend here 
if sophie fancies it 
will she be needing
color charts for the nursery 
you re worse than my mother 
she would have been proud 
somehow i doubt that 
thomas  your parents were   
my parents
were wildly disappointed in me 
your nanna would have approved 
did you fix the windows
in her library 
all done  sir 
we also planted
another 40 acres of oak 
her favorite 
that would be you  sir 
  thank you  callum 
  of course  sir 
having second thoughts 
never 
what is it  then 
did nanna really love grandpa 
in her own way 
could you be any more obtuse 
she had a special way
of seeing the world 
including your grandfather 
for her  it was love 
you understand 
beginning to 
that s why she wanted you
to have that ring 
the great henry buckingham
chopped it off
the maharaja s finger
during the indian mutiny
and bequeathed it to her
upon his passing 
so the story goes 
your nanna did keep her secrets 
guess we ll never know
the truth 
i know she would be pleased 
sophie is a fine choice  thomas 
then it s time 
 man  this just in
from our sources 
red notices have been issued
for three members
of the notorious black swans 
a family owned
private military company
linked to alleged atrocities
in the republic of georgia 
the three are americans
william lewis
and his adult children 
grace and oliver lewis 
the family is reported
to be living in north london 
they re accused
of crimes against humanity
following an alleged massacre
that has only now come to light 
the remote area
where it happened
is known as a corridor for
transnational gas pipelines 
the international
criminal court is demanding
that the uk extradite
the accused to the hague
where they will stand trial 
the prime minister s office
has so far
refused to comment
on the red notices
or whether it plans
to serve them 
but we re waiting for further
updates from number ten 
 gunfire and screaming
on video 
it wasn t
what we hired him to do 
doesn t matter 
he stands trial 
lewis will say we sanctioned it 
well  you re pm 
what do you wanna do 
i mean  we could kick him
into the long grass 
you could do  but you do know
this is not gonna blow over 
mercenaries have been tearing
the arse out of it for decades 
they may have done  but now
every fucker has a mobile phone 
  fair one 
  we could deport him 
no  the yanks
won t eat our shit 
lewis lives here 
he does his business here 
he s been here
for 40 years or so 
he s just bought
the habsburg house 
  what  in hampstead heath 
  yeah 
clearly we re paying him
too much 
well  keeping our hands clean
is a pricey business 
and at that price  i expect them
to be washed of this shite 
there is a difference
between disavowing lewis
and serving him
with a red notice 
he will expect
a level of protection 
no  i cannot be seen
to protect a war criminal 
so do you want me to go round
his house and arrest him 
no  i never said anything
about an arrest 
lewis will have prepared
for that too 
there s a reason we hired him
in the first place 
and there s a reason
i hired you 
natalie  can i grab those notes 
yes  doctor 
  thank you 
  there you go 
  hi  dr hart 
  hi 
surprise 
  surprise 
  first class ticket to paris 
flight s at 1 30 tomorrow 
tom  that s lovely  but   
i rang dr  wells 
she agreed to take your shifts 
i haven t spoken to you
in three weeks 
and the first person you call
is my consultant
to change my schedule 
  yeah 
  tom  that s not ok 
you ve been dying
to go to paris 
i ve been dying
to spend some time with you 
good thing

silly fucker 
hi  james  how s your leg today 
 chatter 
i need everyone out  now 
 olly  yeah  come on 
everyone out  let s go 
 grace sighs 
i just got a message 
the sas is about to move on us 
we can book a g4
out of farnborough 
fly home 
take our chances there 
england is home 
dad  after all these years 
you re still not one of them 
  never will be 
  well  that s true 
i m one of me  so are you 
clements was just
using us anyway 
no  i ve been using him
for my own means 
this government is addicted
to what we do for them 
in three to four hours  they re
gonna break down that door
and they are gonna arrest us 
the last thing they want
is an arrest 
if i d seen that girl
with the phone   
  next time 
   sighs 
there won t be one
unless we do something now 
what would you have us do 
enact the safeguard 
big job 
simulated it six times 
casualties always
a hundred percent 
we re about to get shot
in the back 
anything else from here
is a bonus 
 grace sighs 
ok 
are those pansies 
yeah  yeah  they are 
i m with the heath
and hampstead society 
each year
we select one household
with the finest winter blossoms
and feature it on our website 
thanks 
but we re not interested 
that s a shame  you ve done
such a brilliant job 
i m gonna have to ask you
to leave  i m a bit tired 
are the pansies
more fragrant to you 
no  not really  why 
some women develop
a better sense of smell
when they re pregnant 
that s something
to look forward to 
  if you don t mind   
  how many months are you 
six 
boy or a girl 
they can t tell yet 
you can determine the sex
of a child at three months 
and they re primroses 
not pansies 
red 1  i m compromised out here 
  sitrep on the woman 
  neutralized 
  what about the baby 
  no baby 
just a fake belly rig
concealing an automatic short 
  olivia  who is she 
  she works security for lewis 
there s a 76  probability
that he is on target 
ok 
alpha  to confirm 
this is a hard arrest
on a william lewis
and known associates 
aka the black swans 
under red notice 790274

 man  everest 1
was drawing us in there 
giving grace time to escape 
ok  well

i wanted grace dead 
  so where is she 
  she knew we were coming 
  how 
  i don t know 
the swans weren t split up

 computer chimes 
who installed skype

this came in via our intranet 
should i    should i answer it 
yeah  go on 
i wanna speak
to the ground commander 
major bisset 
special air service 
i m here to negotiate
a peaceful resolution 
thanks to
your assault yesterday 
we re left
with only two options 
which are 
the prime minister
can go on live tv
and admit that
the british government
ordered that clearing op
in georgia 
or he can outfit that
eurocopter you flew in
with extra fuel bladders
and wire 500 million
to an account
of my designation 
that s a lot of money
to organize 
britgaz can manage it 
  why would they pay for it 
  they hired us to do the job 
well  actually 
they hired the sas to hire us 
but those details are best left
for the war crimes tribunal 
in the event
we don t get that ransom 
that s really not my concern 
  my only job is to protect   
  protect british interests 
both military and economic 
ask clements 
i m sure he s lurking
around your control point 
 sighs 
i want
a hundred hostages released
as a show of good faith 
agreed 
but you ll have to come
and get them yourself 
and bring clements 
what you fucking looking at 
 in french 
you know she only wants you
in there so she can kill you 
yeah 
and the only reason i m going
in there is to kill her first 
oh  really 
how you gonna do that 
find out when we get there 
 black swan  this is 1 4 
i have a weeper 
he s hyperventilating 
crying  begging 
starting to lose it

  hmm 
oh  they re not going anywhere 
so why are we here 
you probably thought
that was gonna be you 
actually  i thought
it was gonna be you 
i know that s what
you re here for 
so  let s try this again 
shall we 
  grace lewis 
  george clements 
calm down 
we have a lot to discuss 
no  we don t 
you hired us to do a job 
yeah  you didn t do it properly 
you said clear the village 
and we did 
you fucked up 
you left witnesses 
they were supposed
to spread the fear 
they spread the fear alright 
did it work 
did any other village
ever refuse
to sell you their land
after that 
answer me 
no  the pipeline went through 
low intensity ops 
it s a nasty business 
but it s fucking effective 
your friends
wrote the textbook for it 
well  perhaps
you should have read chapter 10 
 kill kids with mobile phones  
 grace  or the prime minister
could just admit
that he hired us 
 clements 
clearly he ain t gonna do that 
 grace  then clearly
we have to get paid 
payment can be arranged 
britgaz has got   
 grace  a pipeline
in the channel tunnel 
not many people
know about that 
my father did 
if you don t pay us 
and guarantee safe passage 
i will destroy this tunnel
and    everyone in it 
do you understand 
if you well and truly fuck off 
i ll get you your money 
and your safe passage 
agreed 
but i want wire confirmation
in the next 30 minutes 
ok 
  you get that 
  loud and clear 
all call signs 
the device is in position
and the anti tamper triggers
are set 
stand still 
pull the trigger
and i ll detonate 
suicide bomber  are you 
well  we re all
about to get dead anyway 
the ones that survive  enjoy 
not much joy in this job  mate 
we either get we want
or we fuck you up severely 
hijack a train
under 75 meters of rock 
death is the most likely result 
and you and everyone else
in this tunnel
will burn along with us 
drop it 
 newsreader  eurostream
officials have so far
refused to say how many
passengers are involved 
but reports claim
that british  american  french
and dozens
of other foreign nationals
are among the hostages 
 newsreader 2 
sources in whitehall
say the prime minister s
come under increasing pressure
from the presidents
of the united states and france
to resolve the crisis 
so he s called
an emergency session of cobra 
 woman  sir charles whiteside
from britgaz  prime minister 
 prime minister 
thank you for coming 
so what does your board
have to say 
we ve agreed your 500 million 
a bargain  really 
of course  this stays
out of the public domain 
britgaz doesn t pay ransoms 
do we 
understood 
 phone rings 
thank fuck you re still alive 
 chuckles 
grace is gonna blow up
the tunnel 
yeah  yeah  she made
the same threat to clements 
it s not a threat 
i found the device 
  next to a gas pipeline 
  well  can you disarm it 
no  it has anti tamper triggers
all over it 
tell bisset
to get the team in there now 
bisset s dead  mate 
  what 
  grace zapped him 
christ  you have control 
  yeah 
  then launch the er yourself 
clements ordered us to wait out 
what  and let grace
blow up the tunnel 
britgaz just agreed to pay her 
she ll trigger
the device anyway 
this isn t about money 
it s revenge 
yeah  i know 
and if i was in their shoes 
i d be thinking the same thing 
but setting off a bomb in the
channel tunnel  it s suicidal 
she s operating
as if she s already dead 
yeah  well 
if she blows the tunnel 
she d better hope lewis
taught her how to swim out 
that s the real question  mate 
how does she plan to escape 
listen    tom  mate  just  um   
find a way out of there 
alright 
 cause  i ll be honest 
i need your help  mate 
yeah  sophie needs it more 
look  i get that you re in love
and all that 
  i do 
  no  i just got it now 
 phone rings 
yeah  alright  mate 
are you gonna blow the tunnel 
you sound awfully ungrateful
for someone
who just got promoted 
i agreed to help you escape 
but taking
a gas pipeline hostage
was never part of the plan 
declan  you re just a tiny part
of this operation 
actually  no 
i m a mission critical part 
assuming you wanna
get out of there alive 
we re already dead 
and you will be too
if we don t kill this player 
he s one of yours  isn t he 
i ve got him under control 
  the fuck you do  where is he 
  i don t know 
you must be
in contact with him 
yeah  i am 
but i don t know where he is 
let s start with his name 
tom 
look  i did not sign up
for this 
none of us did 
so either you help me kill tom
or i tell clements

 groans 
 newsreader  so we re just
hearing that grace lewis
has claimed responsibility
for hijacking
the eurostream train
and the related explosion
in the channel tunnel 
she has uploaded
a statement online
using various
social media channels 
let s listen in 
by the time you watch this 
i ll be dead 
and i m here to tell you why 
my father taught me
all about these 
this one carries gas
to homes across the uk 
people are always complaining
about the cost
of heating rooms 
heating water  heating pizzas 
for their fat kids
as they sit on their fat asses
mesmerized by reality tv 
they don t know the real cost 
none of you do  until now 
you said clear the village 
and we did 
well  you fucked up 
you left witnesses 
they were supposed
to spread the fear 
they spread the fear alright 
 grace  did it work 
did any other village
ever refuse
to sell you their land
after that 
answer me 
no  the pipeline went through 
low intensity ops 
it s a nasty business 
but it s fucking effective 
your friends
wrote the textbook for it 
 clements  well  perhaps you
should have read chapter 10 
 kill kids with mobile phones  
 grace  or the prime minister
could just admit
that he hired us 
 clements  clearly
he ain t gonna do that 
 grace  well  then clearly
we have to get paid 
 clements  payment can be
arranged  britgaz has got   
 grace  a pipeline
in the channel tunnel 
not many people
know about that 
if you don t pay us 
and guarantee safe passage 
i will destroy this tunnel
and    everyone in it 
 newsreader 
well  grace lewis has made
some extraordinary allegations
against the british government 
if these are proven 
the implications
for the prime minister
and the united kingdom
will be huge 
good luck with the second term 
 coughs 
nicely played 
it s not a game 
yes  it is  and you enjoy it 
always have 
if you were to drop me
right now 
would you think twice about it 
no 
i m the same way 
it s a gift 
a gift we both share 
a gift 
i reckon most people
wouldn t see it that way 
most people are weak
and filled with doubt 
maybe 
but they still   
they still deserve   
 laughs 
love 
i ve never loved anyone
in my entire life 
and neither have you 
that s not true 
not any more 
tom  sophie will eventually
leave you 
 cause she will never understand
who you really are 
she understands now 
you   
are rare  and special 
let me help you embrace
who you really are 
a true black swan 
you re right 
i am 
you ok 
if you ever wanna
talk about it up here   
actually  there s something
i ve been meaning to ask you 
is that why you wanted
to go to paris 
will you marry me 
if i thought
i could make you happy  i would 
but  tom   
you re not meant to be married 
i know that now  and so do you 
  i thought you understood 
  i do 
sophie   
oh  my   
are you    
it s news to me as well 
i love you 
please  marry me 
 newsreader  a red notice
has been issued today
for former sas commander
declan smith 
who s wanted in connection
with the bombing
of the channel tunnel 
at the time of the attack 
smith was a senior member
of the counterterror unit
tasked with resolving
the crisis 
he now stands accused of aiding
and abetting grace lewis 
the main perpetrator 
 newsreader 2 
declan smith is the subject
of an international manhunt
to track him down 
security sources suggest he s
the only surviving recipient
of the ransom
allegedly paid by britgaz
in a failed attempt
to prevent the bombing 
the money  reportedly
half a billion dollars 
is also missing 
a spokesperson for the victims
has been scathing about smith 
telling us they believe he s
sitting on a beach somewhere 
spending the ransom money 
 newsreader 
however  opposition groups
have called him a hero
for what they say
is his battle against
institutional corruption 
they ve repeated the claim 
first made by grace lewis 
that it was
the british government
that ordered a massacre
in the republic of georgia
to pave the way
for a gas pipeline 
 newsreader 2  britgaz  one of
the uk s largest corporations 
has denied those allegations
and expressed its sympathy
for all the victims 
its chairman 
sir charles whiteside 
had refused to make any further
comment until today 
when he phoned in to our studio
for this exclusive interview 
sir charles 
what s your response
to the grace lewis video 
which implies
britgaz was willing
to pay the perpetrators
for their silence 
 sir charles  clearly
the video was constructed
by this grace lewis
in a pathetic attempt
to deflect attention
from her crimes 
 newsreader 2  so you d support
a full investigation
into the attack
and these claims 
 sir charles  yes  as it would
reveal the inconvenient truth 
our own security services
were betrayed 
and this led to a tragic
loss of life and property 
 newsreader 2 
are you referring
to former sas commander
declan smith 
 sir charles  i m aware that
a red notice has been issued
for a man by that name 
and i look forward
to seeing justice done 
 newsreader 2  victims
of the eurostream attack
have speculated that declan
smith is sunning himself
on a private yacht or villa
somewhere  using your money 
 sir charles  we have expressed
our deep condolences
to the victims
but must state very clearly
no ransom was paid 
 newsreader 2  fallout from
the bombing has intensified
as sensational scenes unfolded
in the house of commons today
during prime minister s
questions 
atwood was asked if the bombing
that brought down
the channel tunnel
would bring down
his government 
let s listen in 
 speaker  order  order 
 bangs gavel 
i will have order 
 politician  you re a disgrace 
 speaker  the prime minister 
like every member
who has the floor 
is entitled to be heard 
 politician  let him speak 
 speaker  the prime minister 
 politician 2  resign 
 atwood  thank you  mr speaker 
and  yes  i must confess
to complete disappointment
that my right honorable friend
has used the pmqs
to spread false rumors and
lies about these tragic events 
it s very clear the real
traitor  the real traitor 
is former sas commander
declan smith 
 politician 
will the prime minister   
   politician 3  oh  sit down 
  no  i will not give way 
   politician 4  sit down 
   speaker  order 
 politician  will the prime
minister take responsibility
for this security failure
and resign 
 atwood chuckles  my right
honorable friend  i am 
i am taking responsibility 
i m taking
complete responsibility
for finding declan smith
and holding him to account
in a british court of law 
 sophie  i  dr sophie hart 
take thee 
thomas william buckingham iii 
to be
my lawfully wedded husband 
to have and to hold
from this day forward 
for better  for worse 
in war and peace 
knowing that in war  your crazy
brain is always right 
and i will never wonder what
you get up to in the loo again 
trust me 
you don t want to know 
i  thomas william
buckingham iii
