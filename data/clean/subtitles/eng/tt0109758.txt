but that all change d
when i went to college 
what  di d you take  spanking 101 
well  it wasnt on the curriculum 
 its where i met this professor 
 an d mary ann    
 gilligan s island 
 my favorite show 
im sorry  conversation interruptus 
continuous  please 
no  it was an english professor 
you see  i went to this very small 
conservative school 
and when i was a graduate student 
i wrote a paper on pri de an d preju dice 
in conclusion  it is apparent that elizabeth
exhibite d the qualities of a submissive 
she completely gave herself to her man 
an d in  doing so   
   forgot her own emotional pain 
youre really busy  i shoul d go 
put  down your books 
now take off your sweater 
you took off your clothes in his office 
i coul d never  do that 
even at home  i take off my clothes in the
bathroom  then i jump into be d quickly 
which is weir d  because i live alone 
you see  i was a victim 
i woul d have  done anything he aske d 
an d it wasnt about sex 
he never touche d me 
he seemed to understand
what i was going through 
an d he arrange d for me
to meet a frien d of his   
   who specialize d in erotica 
so a large  black limousine
picked me up at school   
   and took me to a beautiful mansion
with a gigantic iron gate 
i was given a note that said 
 go into the living room   
    take off your clothes 
put on the blindfold  and wait for me  
hello  my beauty 
which one woul d you like 
i nee d to hear what your fantasy is 
im here to create an illusion for you 
only the illusion 
i am a top  a master 
you are a bottom  a submissive 
yet  were not  different 
were in unison to please each other 
just tell me your wishes 
an d welcome to my worl d 
i  di dnt know such a worl d existe d 
its a worl d in which
you have all the choices 
can i choose to be master 
the best submissives usually become
the best masters 
youre a victim in life  i will teach you
to always be in total control 
you will never be a victim again  ever 
never 
ever 
i liked being in control  it felt safe 
but isnt there a happy me dium 
like  i tie you up one night 
you tie me up the next night 
of course  it woul d be nice
not to be in control an d still feel safe 
have you ever 
anyway  diana 
i look forwar d to seeing you all
 during your visit 
my favorite gilligan episo de 
kurt russell as the monkey boy 
 he was cute  even then 
 i love that one  do you remember that 
kurt russell was on the islan d 
no one knew he was there 
follow me 
iii lea d you to our fantasy emporium   
   where you can choose
one of our fantasies 
that soun ds fun 
i ha d a fantasy about skipper once 
remember skipper 
he was chubby  but he was cute 
an d we can also arrange for this fantasy
calle d love with a stranger 
or having sex with a mysterious lover 
a popular fantasy 
especially among women 
no commitment 
no wishing the guy calls the next  day 
no shame or guilt  it wasnt your fault 
you were se duce d 
an d you  di dnt even know his name 
now  if youll follow me 
an d this is another of e dens fantasies 
enjoying the pleasure of total
submissiveness to voice  dominance 
an d being titillate d by comman d
is nothing to be ashame d of 
here we show the secretary
 dominating the boss   
   as one of the most common
comman d fantasies 
mr  van derway  what  do you want 
lts my lunch hour 
do these  documents over again in italics 
 an d give me that letter imme diately 
 no 
what 
 come crawl over here for it 
 crawl 
mr  van derway  i want you to get  down
on your han ds an d knees   
   an d crawl for my letter 
yes  miss perkins 
goo d boss 
as mr  van derway obeys  they both
examine the sha dows of safe  sane   
   an d submissive sexuality 
our next fantasy is popular
with both sexes 
sex in public 
the excitement of getting caught 
how many floors  does it take
you to make love 
in what position  do you make love
in an elevator 
lets see 
it seems our sex in public fantasy
is out of or der 
now  if youll follow me 
well see enactments of the roman bath 
i  do it all the time  its a real kick 
trust me 
 roman baths 
 i once ha d a terrible toothache in rome 
can you tell me
where i can fin d citizen elliot 
were not suppose d to talk about    
i didn t know it at the time  but omar was
actually on my fantasy emporium tour 
if she didn t stop asking me
about her teeth   
   i was gonna have to kill her 
no sign of elliot  but two possible ninas 
how are you  doing 
all right  this islan d is way over the top 
man  what a bunch of o d dballs 
will you lighten up  theyre just
expressing what most people suppress 
 on account of it shoul d be suppresse d 
 why  theyre not hurting anybo dy 
look  there are some things in life
that are just better left un done 
why cant these people think about it   
   instea d of talking an d acting out 
for heavens sake 
it probably gets them past
the game playing 
there was a very interesting scene
over there 
there was a business man 
this secretary came in  
what are you saying 
youre being sucke d in  
 excuse me 
 yes 
 everyones got to keep up with the group 
 im so sorry 
i think the maintenance man has
a little crush on me 
lt  malone had said
to look for strange behavior 
well  here  it was hard to tell 
the rest of the day  i looked for omar 
omar looked for elliot 
my  god  i m good  partner  fred 
concluded that the obvious mrs  randy   
   was  in fact  nina 
he watched her 
hoping she d lead us to omar 
we came up empty 
because elliot was on the other side   
   of the island doing work detail 
so i decided to treat myself to a massage 
tommy  lower 
 lower 
 in fact  no  higher 
what the hell  any way you like 
mistress lisa actually ran a nice place 
she designed all the clothes herself 
her idea was to create these outfits
that were   
   as far away from reality as possible 
our first day on the island 
and we made no progress 
fred took the night shift
and almost got electrocuted 
as for me 
i went to bed quietly with a book 
hey  no panting after 2 00 a m
