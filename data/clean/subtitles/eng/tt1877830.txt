newscaster on tv unbelievable
breaking news this hour everyone
again fourterm incumbent
gotham mayor don mitchell jr
was found murdered last night
inside his home
in the exclusive crest hill district
newscaster 2
exact details of the crime
still have not been released
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway
as police and fbi search
for the brazen killer
and this certainly is not the first time
gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure
in fact in an eerie coincidence
it was 20 years ago this week
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist
dr thomas wayne and his wife martha
were slain during waynes
own mayoral campaign
it was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day
don mitchell jrs political career
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure salvatore maroni
with what to this day remains
the biggest drug bust in gcpd history
i assume you heard about this

my mother worked at the 44 below
just like anni
she used to take me there
when i was a little girl
to the club
yeah
i hid out in the dressing room
while she worked
used to see him there
he scared the shit out of me
and i could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did
then one night
my mother told me who he was
when i was seven
my mother was murdered
strangled
never found out who
probably some creep from the club
anyway social services
came to take me away
and he didnt say a thing
couldnt even look at me
he owes me that money
im sorry
for what i said
oh its all right
chuckles dryly
you assume the worst in people

all anyone cares about in this place

the mayor the commissioner the da
now thomas and bruce wayne

that psychos right
to go after these creeps
i think youd be on his side

thomas and bruce wayne

the riddlers latest
its all about the waynes
listen if i can find
that dickbag kenzie
will you help me
please
come on vengeance
just dont make any moves without me
understand
its a little more dangerous
than you know
romantic music playing
i told you baby
i can take care of myself
thomas im thomas wayne
and i approve this message
triumphant music playing
from a very young age my family
marthas family the arkhams
instilled in both of us
that giving back
is not just an obligation
its a passion
that is our familys legacy
riddler on tv
the waynes and the arkhams
gothams founding families
but what is their real legacy
twenty years ago one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth
he found shocking family secrets
how when martha was just a child
her mother brutally murdered her father
then committed suicide
gunshot
and how the arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up
how martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years
and they didnt want anyone to know
thomas wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter
into a hushmoney agreement
to save his mayoral campaign
raises voice
but when the reporter refused
wayne turned to longtime
secret associate carmine falcone
laughs hysterically
and had him murdered
gunshot
the waynes and the arkhams
gothams legacy of lies and murder
i hope youre listening bruce wayne
this is your legacy too
and gotham needs you to answer
whispering
for the sins of your father
goodbye
club music playing on speakers
do you know who i am
youre bruce wayne
i wanna see carmine falcone
see
scoffs
elevator bell dings
romantic old song playing on speakers
billiard balls clatter
falcone who is this guy
who invented the ball right
must have made a fortune
if you think about it
the concept of it right
briscoe do you know
how much this sweater cost
briscoe no boss
falcone 1183
you know why communism failed right
briscoe no boss
falcone austerity
men laugh
penguin all right all right
falcone chuckles
look at that perfect
penguin
its never gonna be that good again
hey johnny slick
what are you doing here
give us a moment here fellas
penguin come on
see ya champ
come on sweetheart
have a seat
i thought i might hear from you
this uh
riddler son of a bitch is really
stirring things up huh
is it true
what
that reporter business
what do you want to know here kid
did you kill him for my father
look your father was in trouble
this reporter had some dirt
some very
personal stuff about your mother
her family history
everybodys got their dirty laundry
thats just how it is
but he didnt want
none of it coming out
not right before the election
and your father tried
to pay the guy off
but he wasnt going for it
so he came to me
well i never seen him like that
he said carmine
i want you to put the fear of god
in this guy
and when fear isnt enough
oof hmm
your father wanted me to handle it
so i did
i handled it
i know
you thought your father was a boy scout
but youd be surprised
what even a good man like him
is capable of in the right situation
do me a favor
dont lose any sleep over it
this reporter
was a lowlife
he was on maronis payroll
maroni
oh yeah
he could never stand
your father and i had history
and after what happened
with that reporter maroni was worried
that your father would be in my pocket
forever
he would have done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor
you understand
are you saying salvatore maroni
got my father killed
do i know it for a fact
im just saying
it sure looked that way to me
this is what you wanted huh
this little conversation here
exhales ruefully
its been a long time coming huh
i mean you aint a kid no more
melancholy music playing
ekg machine beeping
inhales sharply
rain pattering
sighs
you lied to me
my whole life
i spoke to carmine falcone
he told me what he did for my father
about salvatore maroni
he told you salvatore maroni
had my father killed
why didnt you tell me all this
all these years
ive spent fighting for him
believing that he was a good man
he was a good man
you listen to me
your father was a good man
he made a mistake
a mistake
he had a man killed
why
sighing to protect his family image
his political aspirations
it wasnt to protect the family image
and he didnt have anyone killed
he was protecting your mother
he didnt care about his image
or the campaign any of that
he cared about her
and you
and in a moment of weakness
he turned to falcone
but he never thought falcone
would kill that man
your father should have known
that falcone would do anything
to finally have something on him
that he could use
thats who falcone is
and that was your fathers mistake
but when falcone
told him what hed done
your father was distraught
he told falcone
he was going to the police
that he would confess everything
and that night
your father and your mother were killed
soft music playing
it was falcone
smacks lips
oh i wish i knew for sure
or maybe it was some random thug
on the street
who needed money got scared
and pulled the trigger too fast
if you dont think ive spent every day
searching for that answer
it was my job to protect them
do you understand
i know you always blamed yourself
you were only a boy bruce
i could see the fear in your eyes
but i didnt know how to help
i could teach you how to fight sighs
but i wasnt equipped
to take care of you
you needed a father
and all you had was me
im sorry
dont be sorry alfred
god
i never thought
id feel fear like that again
i thought id mastered all that
i mean
im not afraid to die
i realize now theres something
i havent got past
this fear
of ever going through any of that again
of losing somebody i care about
soft music continues
soft dramatic music playing

bruce
wayne
slowly bruce
wayne
exhales deeply
you know i was there that day
the day the great thomas wayne
announced he was running for mayor
made all those promises
well a week later he was dead
and everybody just forgot about us
all they could talk about
was poor bruce wayne
bruce wayne the orphan
orphan
living in some tower over the park
isnt being an orphan
looking down on everyone
with all that money
dont you tell me
do you know what being an orphan is
its 30 kids to a room
twelve years old and already a drophead
numbing the pain
you wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers
and every winter one of the babies die
because its so cold
but oh no
smacks lips
lets talk about the billionaire
with the lying dead daddy
because at least the money
makes it go down easy
doesnt it
bruce
wayne
hes the only one we didnt get
but we got the rest of em didnt we
all those slick sleazy phony pricks
god
look at you
your mask is amazing
i wish you couldve seen me in mine
aint it funny
all everyone wants to do is unmask you
but theyre missing the point
you and i both know
im looking at the real you right now
my mask allowed me
to be myself completely
no shame
no limits
why did you write me
what do you mean
all those cards
i told you
weve been doing this together
youre a part of this
we didnt do anything together
we did
what did we just do
i asked you to bring him into the light
and you did
were such a good team
were not a team
i never could have
gotten him out of there
im not physical
my strength is up here
i mean i had all the pieces
i had the answers
but i didnt know
how to make them listen
you gave me that
i gave you nothing
you showed me what was possible
you showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence
you inspired me
youre out of your goddamn mind
what
this is all in your head
youre sick twisted
how can you say that
you think youll be remembered
youre a pathetic psychopath
begging for attention
no
youre gonna die alone in arkham
no
no no
a nobody
no
ahhh
this is not how this was supposed to go
ahhh
i had it all planned out
we were gonna be safe here
we could watch the whole thing together
watch what
everything
tense music playing
it was all there
you mean you didnt figure it out
riddler gasps slowly
oh youre really not as smart

bruce wednesday november 6th
siren wailing in distance
the city is underwater
the national guard is coming
martial law is in effect
but the criminal element never sleeps
looting and lawlessness will be rampant
in the parts of the city
no one can get to
i can already see things will get worse
before they get better
and some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can
bella we will rebuild
but not just our city
we must rebuild peoples faith
in our institutions
in our elected officials
in each other
together we will learn
to believe in gotham again
woman speaks indistinctly
helicopter blades whirring
bruce im starting to see now
i have had an effect here
but not the one i intended
vengeance wont change the past
mine or anyone elses
i have to become more
people need hope
to know someones out there for them
the citys angry
scarred
like me
our scars can destroy us
even after
the physical wounds have healed
but if we survive them
they can transform us
they can give us the power
to endure
and the strength to fight
reporter
we are live as you can see
the masked vigilante
atop gotham square garden
helping to save the lives
of hundreds of victims
riddler moaning
and now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured
a mysterious masked man emerges
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight
man isnt that just terrible
him
raining on your parade like that
tutting
what is it they say
one day youre on top
the next
youre a clown
exhales ruefully
well
let me tell you
there are worse things to be
riddler weeping
hey hey hey dont be sad
you did so well
and you know
gotham loves a comeback story
riddler who are you
man well thats the question
isnt it
riddle me this
the less of them you have
the more one is worth
a friend
laughing maniacally
both laughing maniacally
batman youre leaving
gasps
selina jesus
