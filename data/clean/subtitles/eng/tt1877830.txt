to organized crime and drug trafficking

the biggest drug bust in city history

are still rampant

 newscaster on tv  unbelievable
breaking news this hour  everyone 
again  four term incumbent
gotham mayor don mitchell  jr 
was found murdered last night
inside his home
in the exclusive crest hill district 
 newscaster 2 
exact details of the crime
still have not been released 
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway
as police and fbi search
for the brazen killer 
and this certainly is not the first time
gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure 
in fact  in an eerie coincidence 
it was 20 years ago this week
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist
dr  thomas wayne and his wife martha
were slain during wayne s
own mayoral campaign 
it was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day 
don mitchell  jr  s political career
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation 
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure salvatore maroni
with what  to this day  remains
the biggest drug bust in gcpd history 
i assume you heard about this 
 newscaster 2 continues indistinctly 
  yeah 
   video fast forwarding

my mother worked at the 44 below 
just like anni 
she used to take me there
when i was a little girl 
to the club 
yeah 
i hid out in the dressing room
while she worked 
used to see him there 
he scared the shit out of me 
and i could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did 
then one night 
my mother told me who he was 
when i was seven 
my mother was murdered 
strangled 
never found out who 
probably some creep from the club 
anyway  social services
came to take me away 
and he didn t say a thing 
couldn t even look at me 
he owes me that money 
i m sorry 
for what i said 
oh  it s all right 
 chuckles dryly 
you assume the worst in people

hideously scarred 
yeah 
 chuckles lightly 
listen to me

the mayor  the commissioner  the da 
now thomas and bruce wayne

that psycho s right
to go after these creeps 
i think you d be on his side

than you know   
 romantic music playing 
i told you  baby 
i can take care of myself 
 thomas  i m thomas wayne 
and i approve this message 
 triumphant music playing 
from a very young age  my family 
martha s family  the arkhams   
   instilled in both of us
that giving back
is not just an obligation 
it s a passion 
that is our family s legacy 
 riddler on tv 
the waynes and the arkhams 
gotham s founding families 
but what is their real legacy 
twenty years ago  one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth 
he found shocking family secrets 
how  when martha was just a child 
her mother brutally murdered her father 
  then committed suicide   
   gunshot 
   and how the arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up 
how martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years
and they didn t want anyone to know 
thomas wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter
into a hush money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign 
 raises voice 
but when the reporter refused   
   wayne turned to longtime
secret associate carmine falcone
 laughs hysterically 
and had him murdered 
   gunshot 
  the waynes and the arkhams 
gotham s legacy of lies and murder 
i hope you re listening  bruce wayne 
this is your legacy too 
and gotham needs you to answer
 whispering 
for the sins of your father 
goodbye 
 club music playing on speakers 
do you know who i am 
you re bruce wayne 
i wanna see carmine falcone

 scoffs 
 elevator bell dings 
 romantic old song playing on speakers

who invented the ball  right 
must have made a fortune

briscoe  do you know

i thought i might hear from you 
this  uh 
riddler son of a bitch is really   
stirring things up  huh 
  is it true 
  what 
that reporter business 
what do you want to know here  kid 
did you kill him  for my father 
look  your father was in trouble 
this reporter had some dirt 
some very   
personal stuff about your mother 
her family history 
everybody s got their dirty laundry 
that s just how it is 
but he didn t want
none of it coming out 
not right before the election 
and your father tried
to pay the guy off 
but he wasn t going for it 
so  he came to me 
well  i never seen him like that 
he said   carmine 
i want you to put the fear of god
in this guy  
and when fear isn t enough   
oof  hmm 
your father wanted me to handle it 
so i did 
i handled it 
i know 
you thought your father was a boy scout 
but you d be surprised
what even a good man like him
is capable of in the right situation 
do me a favor 
don t lose any sleep over it 
this reporter
was a lowlife 
he was on maroni s payroll 
  maroni 
  oh  yeah 
he could never stand
your father and i had history 
and after what happened
with that reporter  maroni was worried
that your father would be in my pocket 
forever 
he would have done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor 
you understand 
are you saying salvatore maroni
got my father killed 
do i know it for a fact 
i m just saying 
it sure looked that way to me 
this is what you wanted  huh 
this little conversation here 
 exhales ruefully 
it s been a long time coming  huh 
i mean  you ain t a kid no more 
 melancholy music playing 
 ekg machine beeping 
 inhales sharply 
 rain pattering 
 sighs 
you lied to me   
my whole life 
i spoke to carmine falcone 
he told me what he did for my father 
about salvatore maroni 
he told you salvatore maroni   
had my father killed 
why didn t you tell me all this 
all these years
i ve spent fighting for him 
believing that he was a good man 
he was a good man 
you listen to me 
your father was a good man 
  he made a mistake 
  a  mistake  
he had a man killed 
why 
 sighing  to protect his family image 
his political aspirations 
it wasn t to protect the family image 
and he didn t have anyone killed 
he was protecting your mother 
he didn t care about his image
or the campaign  any of that 
he cared about her 
and you 
and in a moment of weakness 
he turned to falcone 
but he never thought falcone
would kill that man 
your father should have known
that falcone would do anything
to finally have something on him
that he could use 
that s who falcone is 
and that was your father s mistake 
but when falcone
told him what he d done 
your father was distraught 
he told falcone
he was going to the police 
that he would confess everything 
and that night 
your father and your mother were killed 
 soft music playing 
it was falcone 
 smacks lips 
oh  i wish i knew for sure 
or maybe it was some random thug
on the street
who needed money  got scared 
and pulled the trigger too fast 
if you don t think i ve spent every day
searching for that answer   
it was my job to protect them 
do you understand 
i know you always blamed yourself 
you were only a boy  bruce 
i could see the fear in your eyes 
but i didn t know how to help 
i could teach you how to fight   sighs 
but i wasn t equipped
to take care of you 
you needed a father 
and all you had was me 
i m sorry 
don t be sorry  alfred 
god 
i never thought
i d feel fear like that again 
i thought i d mastered all that 
i mean 
i m not afraid to die 
i realize now there s something
i haven t got past 
this fear   
of ever going through any of that again 
of losing somebody i care about 
 soft music continues

to take maroni down big 
he d rat out his drops operation

the moment when i would learn the truth 
when i could finally strike back
and expose their lies  
   rats squeaking 
   if you want people to understand

you can t just give them the answers 
you have to confront them 
torture them
with the horrifying questions

 slowly  bruce   
wayne 
 exhales deeply 
you know  i was there that day 
the day the great thomas wayne
announced he was running for mayor 
made all those promises 
well  a week later he was dead 
and everybody just forgot about us 
all they could talk about
was poor bruce wayne 
bruce wayne  the orphan 
orphan 
living in some tower over the park
isn t being an orphan 
looking down on everyone 
with all that money 
don t you tell me 
do you know what being an orphan is 
it s 30 kids to a room 
twelve years old and already a drophead 
numbing the pain 
you wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers 
and every winter one of the babies die
because it s so cold 
but  oh  no 
 smacks lips 
let s talk about the billionaire
with the lying  dead daddy
because at least the money
makes it go down easy 
doesn t it 
bruce   
wayne 
he s the only one we didn t get 
but we got the rest of  em  didn t we 
all those slick  sleazy  phony pricks 
god 
look at you

i wish you could ve seen me in mine 
ain t it funny 
all everyone wants to do is unmask you 
but they re missing the point 
you and i both know
i m looking at the real you right now 
my mask allowed me
to be myself completely 
no shame 
no limits 
why did you write me 
what do you mean 
all those cards 
i told you 
we ve been doing this together 
you re a part of this 
  we didn t do anything together 
  we did 
what did we just do 
i asked you to bring him into the light 
and you did 
we re such a good team 
we re not a team 
i never could have
gotten him out of there 
i m not physical 
my strength is up here 
i mean  i had all the pieces 
i had the answers 
but i didn t know
how to make them listen 
you gave me that 
i gave you nothing 
you showed me what was possible 
you showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence 
you inspired me 
you re out of your goddamn mind 
what 
this is all in your head 
you re sick  twisted 
how can you say that 
you think you ll be remembered 
you re a pathetic psychopath 
  begging for attention 
  no 
  you re gonna die alone in arkham 
  no 
no  no 
a nobody 
no 
ahhh 
this is not how this was supposed to go 
ahhh 
i had it all planned out 
we were gonna be safe here 
we could watch the whole thing together

 tense music playing 
it was all there 
you mean  you didn t figure it out 
 riddler gasps slowly 
oh  you re really not as smart

 bruce  wednesday  november 6th 
 siren wailing in distance 
the city is underwater 
the national guard is coming 
martial law is in effect   
but the criminal element never sleeps 
looting and lawlessness will be rampant
in the parts of the city
no one can get to 
i can already see things will get worse
before they get better 
and some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can 
 bella  we will rebuild 
but not just our city 
we must rebuild people s faith
in our institutions 
in our elected officials 
in each other 
together  we will learn
to believe in gotham again 
 woman speaks indistinctly

vengeance won t change the past 
mine or anyone else s 
i have to become more 
people need hope 
to know someone s out there for them 
the city s angry 
scarred 
like me 
our scars can destroy us 
even after
the physical wounds have healed 
but if we survive them 
they can transform us 
they can give us the power
to endure   
and the strength to fight 
 reporter 
we are live  as you can see 
the masked vigilante
atop gotham square garden
helping to save the lives
  of hundreds of victims 
   riddler moaning 
and now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured 
a mysterious masked man emerges 
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight
