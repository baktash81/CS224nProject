the dream i must have had
but
but
the sensation that ive lost something
lingers for a long time after i wake up
im always searching
for something for someone
this feeling has possessed me
i think from that day
that day when the stars came falling
it was almost as if
as if it were a scene from a dream
nothing more nothing less
than a beautiful view
than a beautiful view
how i wish our words travel
till the edge of the world
without vanishing
then what will those words be
to make promises that wont fade
lets say it on the count of three
your wish may come true
to some degrees
i no longer cannot see
the eyes of this saying
since when and why i dont know
where the point rain starts and ends
where the rainbow begins and ends
place where my life fades
ive always believed that there is
something ive been chasing
one day well go
where all living creatures have never been
unprecedented unexplored sentiments
give them five and kiss your time away
5th dimension teases me
but i still see you
lets make our signal
how to say nice to meet you
and i chase your name
taki taki

emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread
threads dont talk
she means concentrate
1000 years of itomoris history
is etched into our braided cords
listen 200 years ago
here she goes again
sandal maker mayugoros bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area
the shrine and
old documents were destroyed
and this is known as
the great fire of mayugoro
the fire has his name poor mayugoro
so we lost the meaning of our festivals
and only the form lived on

i dont know thanks to mayugoro
whos that
what hes famous
here grandma
whoa mitsuha
mitsuha yotsuha do you know musubi
musubi
musubi is the old term
for calling the local guardian deity
this word has profound meaning
tying thread is musubi
connecting people is musubi
the flow of time is musubi
these are all the gods power
so the braided cords that we make
are the gods art
and represent the flow of time itself
they converge and take shape
they twist tangle
sometimes unravel
break then connect again
musubi knotting thats time
drink
thank you
i want some too
thats also musubi
whether it be water rice or saké
when a person consumes something
and it joins their soul thats musubi
so todays offering
is an important custom
that connects the god and its people
hey i see it
thats the vessel of miyamizu shrines god
beyond this point is the kakuriyo
it means the underworld
im in the underworld
in exchange for returning to this world
you must leave behind
what is most important to you
the kuchikamizake
the kuchikamizake
youll offer it inside the gods vessel
its half of you
half of mitsuha
its twilight already katawaredoki
katawaredoki

tsukasa told me and here i am
tsukasa i asked you to

it has to be some kind of mistake
this person died three years ago
just two three weeks ago she said to me
that the comet would be visible
so

arent you
what did i
lively up there
im sorry we could only get one room
no problem

what do you think about takis story
i liked him
the way he was recently he was always
a nice guy but even more so lately
like he was trying so hard it was cute
what hes saying
doesnt make sense to me
but im sure he met someone
and that someone changed him
that much is for sure i think
worstever itomori comet disaster
that much is for sure i think
worstever itomori comet disaster

braided cords once told me
the cords represent
the flow of time itself

its perigee around 740 pm
and will achieve its maximum brightness
its tonight theres still time
good morning mitsuha
oh
youre not mitsuha are you
you knew grandma
no but watching the way youve behaved
lately triggered some memories
i also remember having
strange dreams when i was a young girl
although now ive forgotten
whose life i was dreaming about
forgotten
treasure the experience
dreams fade away after you wake up
your mother and i
both went through similar phases
maybe those dreams
that the miyamizu family had
were all for what will happen today
grandma listen
a comet will strike itomori tonight
and everyone will die
nobody will believe that what a
surprisingly ordinary reply grandma
i wont let them die
oh what happened mitsuha
your your hair
oh this it looked better before huh
thats it
forget that if nothing is done
everyone will die tonight
so we have to act
why arent you at school

superimposition frequency
yeah those speakers you see everywhere
superimposition frequency

what about you have you
come up with an escape plan
what a bomb
we have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site
broadcast hijacking
the towns wireless system can be
hijacked easily with the startup frequency
so we can broadcast
an evacuation warning from the school
the school is outside the disaster area
so people can evacuate here
its its totally a crime
you do the broadcast
why
youre in the broadcast club
im in charge of explosives
ill go talk to the mayor
in the end the city council
has to evacuate everyone
im his daughter i can persuade him
its a perfect plan
oh whatever its just
a whatif fantasy isnt it
what well
not necessarily do you know
how lake itomori was formed
not necessarily do you know
a meteor crater lake
formed 1200 years ago
a meteor crater lake formed 1200 years ago its a meteor
crater so one did strike this area a thousand years ago
its a meteor crater so one did
strike this area a thousand years ago
oh so thats why
youre right tessie

everyone in town before tonight or
shut your mouth
the comet will split and strike the town
itomori town hall

katsuhiko
what are you doing
sorry mitsuha
its over
it really is splitting apart
look at that  wow
look the comet has split in two
and meteors are falling
nobody predicted this
we have a really mystical sight here
so the comets nucleus split
did tidal forces affect
the comet isnt within the roche limit
so the nucleus itself must have
in the past comet shoemakerlevy 9
broke and collided with jupiter in 1994
at least 21 fragments
im going to go look
they will probably melt
before reaching the ground
and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small
to predict the trajectory
to be witnessing such
a magnificent celestial event and
how fortunate it is
that those of us living in this
day and age are watching this live
hey who are you
who who
who is that
someone dear to me i shouldnt forget
i didnt want to forget
who who who are you
whats your name
its split
so we dont forget when we wake up
lets write our names on each other
i love you

i knew i was refused
you cry when youre happy
you laugh when youre sad
because your heart overtook you
hey

the wind that passed between us
where did it bring the sorrow from
the sky we looked up crying
was kind of awfully clear
usually harsh words of my father
felt somehow warm today
not knowing how to be kind
or smile or talk about dreams
i had to imitate you all
just a bit more a little bit more
would you
just a bit more a little bit more
lets stick together
we are timeflyer we are timeclimber
dont wanna be lost in its hideandseek
you cry when youre happy
you laugh when youre sad
because your heart overtook you
the toy i used to wish for upon the stars
is left lying on the floor
at the corner of my room
i made my hundredth wish today
i will trade them all to one thing some day
talked to a girl whos usually silent
see ya i said after school
its nice for a change to break your habit
especially when you are next to me
just a bit more a little bit more
would you
just a bit more a little bit more
stick together
we are timeflyer i knew who you are
long before even i learned my name
there must be a meaning
to the world without you
but the world without you
is like august with no summer break
like santa claus with no hohohos
how pitiful if such were the world
we are timeflyer we are timeclimber
dont wanna be lost in its hideandseek

dont wanna be lost in its hideandseek
youre a loud cryer wish i could stop ya
