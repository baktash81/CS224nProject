the dream i must have had 
but   
but   
the sensation that i ve lost something
lingers for a long time after i wake up 
i m always searching
for something  for someone 
this feeling has possessed me 
i think  from that day   
that day when the stars came falling 
it was almost as if   
as if it were a scene from a dream 
nothing more  nothing less
than a beautiful view 
than a beautiful view 
how i wish our words travel
till the edge of the world
without vanishing
then what will those words be 
to make promises that won t fade
let s say it on the count of three
 your wish may come true
to some degrees 
i no longer cannot see
the eyes of this saying
since when and why  i don t know
where the point rain starts and ends 
where the rainbow begins and ends
place where my life fades 
i ve always believed that there is
something i ve been chasing
one day we ll go
where all living creatures have never been 
unprecedented  unexplored sentiments
give them five and kiss your time away
5th dimension teases me
but i still see you
let s make our signal
how to say  nice to meet you 
and i chase your name
taki  taki 
don t you remember me 
my name is

in a strange dream lately   
a dream about someone else s life 
i can t remember clearly 
i know  that was   
your previous life 
or maybe your subconscious
linked to the everett multiverse

oh  don t remind me 
i can t stand this town anymore 
it s too small and close knit 
i want to graduate and go to tokyo 
i don t blame you

what s this  you asking about my future 
nothing special  i ll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town 
i d rather do that  too 
you re not ready yet  yotsuha 
listen to the thread s voice 
when you keep spooling like that 
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread 
threads don t talk 
she means   concentrate  
1 000 years of itomori s history
is etched into our braided cords 
listen  200 years ago   
here she goes again 
sandal maker mayugoro s bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area 
the shrine and
old documents were destroyed
and this is known as   
the great fire of mayugoro 
the fire has his name  poor mayugoro 
so we lost the meaning of our festivals 
and only the form lived on 
but even if words are lost 
tradition should be handed down 
that s the important task
we at miyamizu shrine have 
but that foolish son in law   
as if leaving shinto priesthood
and this house weren t enough

 kuchikamizake   do the gods
appreciate saké made that way 
of course they do 
hey  look  it s miyamizu 
oh  i could never do that 
isn t she embarrassed 
i can t believe it 
cheer up  mitsuha  who cares
if a few classmates saw you 
i envy your prepubescent lack of concern 
why not sell lots of kuchikamizake
and use the money to go to tokyo 
where do you get such ideas 
sell them with photos and making of videos

here  grandma 
whoa  mitsuha 
mitsuha  yotsuha  do you know  musubi  
musubi 
musubi is the old term
for calling the local guardian deity 
this word has profound meaning 
tying thread is musubi 
connecting people is musubi 
the flow of time is musubi 
these are all the god s power 
so the braided cords that we make
are the god s art 
and represent the flow of time itself 
they converge and take shape 
they twist  tangle 
sometimes unravel 
break  then connect again 
musubi  knotting  that s time 
drink 
thank you 
i want some  too 
that s also musubi 
whether it be water  rice  or saké 
when a person consumes something
and it joins their soul  that s musubi 
so today s offering
is an important custom
that connects the god and its people 
hey  i see it 
that s the vessel of miyamizu shrine s god 
beyond this point is the  kakuriyo  
it means the underworld 
i m in the underworld 
in exchange for returning to this world 
you must leave behind
what is most important to you 
the kuchikamizake 
the kuchikamizake 
you ll offer it inside the god s vessel 
it s half of you 
half of mitsuha   
it s twilight already     kataware doki

surely you remember that disaster
three years ago  where hundreds died 
died 
died  three years ago

 mitsuha miyamizu 
that s her 
it has to be some kind of mistake 
this person died three years ago 
just two  three weeks ago  she said to me
that the comet would be visible 
so   
you re dreaming right now   
aren t you 
what did i    
lively up there 
i m sorry we could only get one room 
no problem 
how s taki 
he s still reading articles on itomori 
newspapers and magazines
from back then  whatever he can find 
what 
nothing  i didn t know you smoked 
oh  i had quit  but   
what do you think about taki s story 
i liked him 
the way he was recently  he was always
a nice guy  but even more so lately 
like he was trying so hard  it was cute 
what he s saying
doesn t make sense to me   
but i m sure he met someone 
and that someone changed him 
that much is for sure  i think 
 worst ever itomori comet disaster 
that much is for sure  i think 
 worst ever itomori comet disaster 
it was all just a dream 
i recognized the scenery because
i remembered the news from three years ago 
if not that  then    a ghost

gave it to me a long time ago 
i wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm   
who was it 
why don t you go take a bath  too 
yes  no 
someone who makes
braided cords once told me   
the cords represent
the flow of time itself 
the threads twist  tangle  unravel 
and connect again  that s time   
maybe at that place   
 around here  
taki 
taki 
taki 
don t you remember me 
 i have to go somewhere  go back to tokyo

your drawing of itomori    it was good 
they converge and take shape 
they twist  tangle 
sometimes unravel  then connect again   
musubi  knotting  that s time 
there it is 
it s really there 
it wasn t just a dream 
beyond this is the underworld 
it s the saké we brought

before the comet struck    so the mitsuha
i know is from three years ago 
our timelines were out of step

scary 
comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now 
tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7 40 p m  
and will achieve its maximum brightness 
it s tonight  there s still time 
good morning  mitsuha 
oh   
you re not mitsuha  are you 
you knew  grandma 
no  but watching the way you ve behaved
lately triggered some memories 
i also remember having
strange dreams when i was a young girl 
although now i ve forgotten
whose life i was dreaming about 
forgotten   
treasure the experience 
dreams fade away after you wake up 
your mother and i
both went through similar phases 
maybe those dreams
that the miyamizu family had
were all for what will happen today 
grandma  listen 
a comet will strike itomori tonight
and everyone will die 
 nobody will believe that   what a
surprisingly ordinary reply  grandma 
i won t let them die 
oh  what happened  mitsuha 
your    your hair 
oh  this  it looked better before  huh 
that s it 
forget that  if nothing is done 
everyone will die tonight 
so we have to act 
why aren t you at school 
uh    we have to save the town 
the community wireless system 
yeah  those speakers you see everywhere 
 superimposition  frequency 
yeah  those speakers you see everywhere 
 superimposition  frequency

what a cheap fee  deal with it 
what about you  have you
come up with an escape plan 
what  a bomb 
we have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site 
broadcast hijacking 
the town s wireless system can be
hijacked easily with the startup frequency 
so we can broadcast
an evacuation warning from the school 
the school is outside the disaster area 
so people can evacuate here 
it s    it s totally a crime 
you do the broadcast 
why 
you re in the broadcast club 
i m in charge of explosives 
i ll go talk to the mayor 
in the end  the city council
has to evacuate everyone 
i m his daughter  i can persuade him 
it s a perfect plan 
oh  whatever  it s just
a what if fantasy  isn t it 
what  well   
not necessarily  do you know
how lake itomori was formed 
not necessarily  do you know
 a meteor crater lake
formed 1 200 years ago  
 a meteor crater lake formed 1 200 years ago   it s a meteor
crater  so one did strike this area a thousand years ago 
it s a meteor crater  so one did
strike this area a thousand years ago

this is itomori town hall 
an explosion
has occurred at the substation 
there is a danger of further
explosions and forest fires 
residents in the following areas 
please evacuate to itomori high school 
kadoiri district  sakagami district

figure out where it s coming from 
the takayama sensor station called 
the high school 
again  residents in the following areas 
evacuate to itomori high sch    oh 
what are you doing  turn that off 
sayaka 
oh  no 
what have you done  sayaka 
this is itomori town hall 
we are currently looking into the accident 
please don t panic  stay where you are
and await further instructions 
stay put  they said 
what s going on  so we stay put 
come on  you should all evacuate 
the high school is the shelter 
katsuhiko 
what are you doing 
sorry  mitsuha 
it s over 
it really is splitting apart 
look at that    wow 
look  the comet has split in two
and meteors are falling 
nobody predicted this 
we have a really mystical sight here 
so the comet s nucleus split 
did tidal forces affect   
the comet isn t within the roche limit 
so the nucleus itself must have   
in the past  comet shoemaker levy 9
broke and collided with jupiter in 1994 
at least 21 fragments   
i m going to go look 
they will probably melt
before reaching the ground
and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small   
to predict the trajectory   
to be witnessing such
a magnificent celestial event  and   
how fortunate it is
that those of us living in this
day and age are watching this live 
hey  who are you 
who  who 
who is that 
someone dear to me  i shouldn t forget 
i didn t want to forget 
who  who  who are you 
what s your name 
it s split 
so we don t forget when we wake up 
let s write our names on each other 
 i love you 
i can t remember your name with this   
dad

it were a scene from a dream 
nothing more  nothing less
than a beautiful view 
what am i doing here 
i m always searching for something 
this feeling has
possessed me for some time 
i applied because   
the landscapes people live in

so i want to help build landscapes
that leave heartwarming memories

we are time flyer  we are time climber
don t wanna be lost in its hide and seek
i won t let you go  won t never let it go
my hand finally overtook you
you re a loud cryer  wish i could stop ya
but when i saw your tears
i knew i was refused
you cry when you re happy
you laugh when you re sad
because your heart overtook you
hey 
haven t we met 
i thought so  too 
your name is    
your name is    
the wind that passed between us
where did it bring the sorrow from 
the sky we looked up crying
was kind of awfully clear
usually harsh words of my father
felt somehow warm today
not knowing how to be kind
or smile or talk about dreams
i had to imitate you all
just a bit more  a little bit more 
would you   
just a bit more  a little bit more 
let s stick together
we are time flyer  we are time climber
don t wanna be lost in its hide and seek
you cry when you re happy
you laugh when you re sad
because your heart overtook you
the toy i used to wish for upon the stars
is left lying on the floor
at the corner of my room
i made my hundredth wish today
i will trade them all to one thing some day
talked to a girl who s usually silent
 see ya  i said after school
it s nice for a change to break your habit
especially when you are next to me
just a bit more  a little bit more 
would you   
just a bit more  a little bit more 
stick together
we are time flyer  i knew who you are
long before even i learned my name
there must be a meaning
to the world without you
but the world without you
is like august with no summer break
like santa claus with no ho ho ho s
how pitiful if such were the world
we are time flyer  we are time climber
don t wanna be lost in its hide and seek
it s really nothing 
yeah it s really nothing
i m on my way
we are time flyer  we are time climber
don t wanna be lost in its hide and seek
you re a loud cryer  wish i could stop ya
