called castle rock

yeah probably
so what are you pissing and moaning
about verno
i knock
what
you liar you aint got no pat hand
you didnt deal yourself no pat hand
make your draw shitheap
you guys want to go see a dead body
i was under the porch digging you know
we all understood
what vern meant right away
at the beginning of the school year
he had buried a jar of pennies
underneath his house
he drew a treasure map
so he could find them again
a week later his mom cleaned out
his room and threw away the map
vern had been trying to find those pennies
for nine months
nine months man
you didnt know whether laugh or cry
jesus billy we gotta do something
why who cares
we saw him
so
its nothin to us the kids dead
so its nothin to him neither
and who gives a shit if they ever find him
i dont
its that kid theyre talking about
on the radio
brocker or brower or flowers
whatever his name is
the train must have hit him
big fucking deal
we had all followed
the ray brower story closely
since he was a kid our age
three days before he left to pick
blueberries and nobodyd seen him since
i think we should tell the cops
you dont go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car
theyll want to know how we got way out
on back harlow road
they know we dont got no car
its best we just keep quiet
then they cant touch us
but we could make an anonymous call
they trace those calls stupid i seen it
on highway patrol and on dragnet
yeah right
i wish we never boosted
that goddamned dodge
i wish ace had been with us
we couldve said he was in his car
he wasnt
are we gonna tell him
were not going to tell nobody
nobody never you dig me
i know the back harlow road
it comes to a dead end by the royal river
the train tracks are right there
me and my dad fished out there
if they had known you were under there
they wouldve killed you
could he have gotten all the way from
chamberlain to harlow thats really far
sure he probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way
yeah right
and then after dark a train must have
come along and el smako
i bet you if we find him
well get our pictures in the paper
we could even be on tv
sure
well be heroes
i dont know billy will know i found out
hes not going to care
cause its gonna be us that find him
not billy and charlie hogan
and the boosted the car
theyll probably pin a medal on you
you think so
sure
whatll we tell our folks
exactly what you said
well tell our folks
that were tenting in your backfield
you tell your folks
your sleeping at teddys
then we say were going
to the drag races the next day
were rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night
man thats a plan and a half
but if we find the body in south harlow
theyll know we didnt go to the races
well get hided
nobody will care
because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery
it wont make a difference
my dad will hide me anyway
but its worth it
shit yeah

stand back men
paratroopers over the side
no trespassing was enforced
by milo pressman the junkman
and his dog chopper
the most feared and least seen dog
in castle rock
legend had it that milo had
trained chopper not just to sic
but to sic specific parts
of the human anatomy
thus a kid who had illegally scaled
the junkyard fence
might hear the dread cry
chopper sic balls
but right now neither the dread chopper
nor milo
was anywhere in sight
teddys crazy
come on men move it out
he wont live to be 20 i bet
remember the time you saved him
in the tree
i dream about that sometimes
except in the dream i miss him
i just get a few hairs and down he goes
its weird
that is weird
but you didnt miss him
chris chambers never misses does he
not even when
the ladies leave the seat down
race you

over to the pump
im kind of tired go

has got him this time
hes got chambers beat

the crowd goes wild
you guys been watching
the mickey mouse club lately

ive been noticing that the a and the e
are starting to bend around the sides
annettes tits are great
this is a really good time
the most
a blast
vern didnt just mean being off limits
inside the junkyard
or fudging on our folks
or going on a hike up the tracks
to harlow he meant those things but
it seems to me now it was more
and that we all knew it
everything was there and around us
we knew exactly who we were
and exactly where we were going
it was grand
great spit at the fat kid real good
what time is it

and his battling leathernecks
the one ive been thinking about
is kind of different
its about this pieeating contest
the main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody likes named davie hogan
like charlie hogans
brother if he had one
good vern
go on
well this kid hes our age
but hes fat real fat
he weighs close to 180
but its not his fault its his glands
my cousins like that sincerely
she weighs over 300 pounds supposed
to be a hyboid gland or somethin
i dont know about any hyboid gland
but what a blimp
no shit
she looks like a thanksgiving turkey
and you know this one time
shut up vern
right go on its a swell story
all the kids instead of calling him davie
they called him lardass lardass hogan
even his little brother
and sister called him lardass
at school they put this sticker on his back
that says wide load
and they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance
but one day he gets an idea
the greatest revenge idea a kid ever had
is this thing on can you hear me
the next contestant
in the great tricounty pie eat
principal john wiggins
and our celebrity contestant
from klam in portland
the bossman himself bob cormier
from the racks and stacks
its the best on wax
how about another double golden oldie
sound sandwich from klam in portland
its
boss
next a newcomer to the pie eat
but one we expect
great things from in the future
young master david hogan
are you all right young man
lardass how was your trip
i hear you got a big appetite lardass
dont even think about winning this
boy are you fat
dont pay attention to those fools
lardass davie
and now
the one youve all been waiting for
the fourtime champion
our own bill travis
listen i got 10 riding
on you myself billy boy
all right are you ready
hands behind your backs gentlemen
drum roll
hey lardass chow down wide load
go
done
done
done
you better pace yourself
if you want to hold out
come on lardass
lardass lardass
what the audience didnt know was
that lardass wasnt interested in winning
what he wanted was revenge
and right before he was introduced
hed gotten ready for it
principal john wiggins
and our celebrity contestant
from klam in portland
the bossman himself bob cormier
from the racks and stacks
its the best on wax
how about another double golden oldie
sound sandwich from klam in portland
its
done
diving into his fifth pie lardass began
to imagine that he wasnt eating pies
he pretended he was eating cowflops
and rat guts in blueberry sauce
done
slowly a sound started to build
in lardasss stomach
a strange and scary sound
like a log truck coming
at you at 100 miles an hour
suddenly lardass opened his mouth
and before bill travis knew it
he was covered with five pies worth
of used blueberries
the women in the audience screamed
bossman bob cormier took one look
at bill travis and barfed on wiggins
wiggins barfed on the lumberjack
that was sitting next to him
mayor grundy barfed on his wifes tits
but when the smell hit the crowd
thats when lardasss plan
really started to work
girlfriends barfed on boyfriends
kids barfed on their parents
a fat lady barfed in her purse
the donelley twins barfed on each other
the womens auxiliary barfed all over
the benevolent order of antelopes
and lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what hed created
a complete and total barfarama
too cool
that was the best just the best
then what happened
what do you mean
i mean what happened
what do you mean what happened
thats the end
how can that be the end what kind of an
ending is that what happens to lardass
i dont know
maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers
jesus that ending sucks
why dont you make it
so that lardass goes home
and he shoots his father
then he runs away
and he joins the texas rangers
how about that
i dont know
something good like that
i like the ending the barfing was good
but theres one thing
i didnt understand
did lardass have to pay
to get into the contest
no vern they just let him in
great great story
its a great story
i just didnt like the ending
wheres the radio
lets see if we can get some sounds
here
we talked into the night
the kind of talk that seemed important
until you discover girls
all right
mickeys a mouse donalds a duck
plutos a dog
whats goofy
if i could only have one food
for the rest of my life
thats easy pez
cherry flavored pez
no question about it
goofys a dog hes definitely a dog
i knew the 64000 question was fixed
theres no way anybody can know
that much about opera
he cant be a dog
he wears a hat and drives a car
wagon train is a really cool show
but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere
they just keep wagon training

of those lowlife chambers kids

it is
no one asked me if i took the milk money
i just got a threeday vacation
did you take it
yeah i took it you knew i took it
teddy knew i took it
everyone knew i took it
even vern knew i think
maybe i was sorry
and i tried to give it back
you tried to give it back
maybe just maybe
maybe i took it to old lady simons
and told her and the money was all there
but i still got a threeday vacation
because it never showed up
and maybe the next week
old lady simons
had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school
yeah it was brown and it had dots on it
lets just say that i stole the milk money
but old lady simons stole it back from me
just suppose that i told this story
me chris chambers
kid brother to eyeball chambers
do you think anyone
would have believed it
no
you think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags
from the view
if they had taken the money
no way
hell no
but with me
im sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time
anyway she saw her chance
and she took it
i was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back
i just never thought
i never thought that a teacher
who gives a fuck anyway
i just wish
that i could go someplace
where nobody knows me
i guess im just a pussy
no way man
the freight woke up the other guys
and it was on the tip of my tongue
to tell them about the deer but i didnt
that was the one thing i kept to myself
ive never spoken or written of it
until just now
how come you didnt get
some breakfast stuff like
twinkies and pez and root beer
sorry i guess a more experienced shopper
couldve gotten more for your 7 cents
with our stomachs rumbling
we pressed on toward the royal river
the reality of ray brower was growing
and kept us moving despite the heat
for me the idea
of seeing that kids dead body
was starting to become an obsession
gentlemen the royal
god the tracks go way out of the way
we cut across this field right here
well be there in an hour

billy and charlie had managed to keep
their enormous secret for about 36 hours
a personal record for both of them
by noon ace and eyeball had told
their secret to everybody in the gang
i guess for those guys protecting their
mothers good name wasnt a top priority
ace maybe me and charlie shouldnt go
maybe you could go without us
you guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit

but we came all this way

not this way teddy
chris give me a hand
ray browers body was found
but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit
we decided that an anonymous phone call
was the best thing to do
we headed home and although
many thoughts raced through our minds
we barely spoke
we walked all night
and made it back to castle rock
a little past 500 on sunday morning
the day before labour day
wed only been gone two days
but somehow the town seemed different
smaller
see you in school
see you in junior high
penny
i better get home before my mom
puts me on the 10 most wanted list
no hard feelings okay
no way man
as time went on we saw less and less
of teddy and vern
until eventually they became
just two more faces in the halls
it happens sometimes
friends come in and out of your life
like busboys in a restaurant
i heard that vern got married
out of high school had four kids
and is now the forklift operator
at the arsenault lumber yard
teddy tried to get into the army
but his eyes and his ear kept him out
last id heard
hed spent some time in jail
and was now doing odd jobs
around castle rock
im never gonna get out of this town
am i gordie
you can do anything you want man
sure
give me some skin
ill see you
not if i see you first
chris did get out
he enrolled in the
college courses with me
and although it was hard
he gutted it out like he always did
he went on to college
and eventually became a lawyer
last week
he entered a fastfood restaurant
just ahead of him
two men got into an argument
one of them pulled a knife
chris whod always made the best peace
tried to break it up
he was stabbed in the throat
he died almost instantly
dad can we go now
you ready
