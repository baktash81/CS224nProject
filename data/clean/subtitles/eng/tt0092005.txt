    a long time ago   
    but only if you measure it
in terms of years 
i was living in a small town in oregon
called castle rock 
there were only 1 281 people 
but to me it was the whole world 
it s the bossman bob cormier 
it s a beautiful friday morning in portland 
it s 90 klam degrees and getting hotter 
up the ladder with another platter 
it s bobby day with rockin  robin   
    it s boss 
how do you know a frenchman s been
in your backyard 
i m french  okay 
your garbage cans are empty
and your dog s pregnant 
didn t i just say i was french 
  i knock 
  shit 
twenty nine 
twenty two 
piss up a rope 
gordie s out  oi  gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door 
come on  man  deal 
teddy duchamp was the craziest guy
we hung around with 
he didn t have much of a chance in life 
his dad was given to fits of rage 
one time he held teddy s ear to a stove
and almost burned it off 
i knock 
you four eyed pile of shit 
the  pile of shit  has 1 000 eyes 
what 
what s so funny 
i got thirty  what have you got 
sixteen 
go ahead  keep laughing 
you re down to your ride  pal 
chris chambers was the leader of our gang
and my best friend 
he came from a bad family
and everyone just knew he d turn out bad 
including chris 
that s not the secret knock 
i forgot the secret knock  let me in 
vern 
come on  you guys  open up 
man  you guys are not going
to believe this  this is so boss 
wait till you hear this 
you won t believe it  it s unbelievable 
let me catch my breath  i ran all the way
from my house 
 i ran all the way home 
come on  listen to me  this is boss 
 just to say i m sorry 
okay  forget it 
i don t have to tell you nothin  
hold on  you guys  hold on 
what is it  man 
great  you won t believe this  sincerely 
 i ran all the way home 
screw you guys  forget it 
what is it 
can you camp out tonight 
i mean  if you tell your folks
we re gonna tent out in my backfield 
i think so 
except my dad s kind of on a mean streak 
he s been drinking a lot lately 
you got to  sincerely 
you won t believe this  can you  gordie 
yeah  probably 
so what are you pissing and moaning
about vern o 
  i knock 
  what 
you liar  you ain t got no pat hand 
you didn t deal yourself no pat hand 
make your draw  shitheap 
you guys want to go see a dead body 
i was under the porch digging  you know 
we all understood
what vern meant right away 
at the beginning of the school year
he had buried a jar of pennies   
    underneath his house 
he drew a treasure map
so he could find them again 
a week later his mom cleaned out
his room and threw away the map 
vern had been trying to find those pennies
for nine months   
    nine months  man 
you didn t know whether laugh or cry 
jesus  billy  we gotta do something 
why  who cares 
  we saw him 
  so 
it s nothin  to us  the kid s dead
so it s nothin  to him  neither 
and who gives a shit if they ever find him 
i don t 
it s that kid they re talking about
on the radio 
brocker or brower or flowers 
whatever his name is 
the train must have hit him 
big fucking deal 
we had all followed
the ray brower story closely   
    since he was a kid our age 
three days before  he left to pick
blueberries and nobody d seen him since 
i think we should tell the cops 
you don t go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car 
they ll want to know how we got way out
on back harlow road 
they know we don t got no car 
it s best we just keep quiet 
then they can t touch us 
but we could make an anonymous call 
they trace those calls stupid  i seen it
on highway patrol and on dragnet 
yeah  right 
i wish we never boosted
that goddamned dodge 
i wish ace had been with us 
  we could ve said he was in his car 
  he wasn t 
  are we gonna tell him 
  we re not going to tell nobody 
nobody  never  you dig me 
i know the back harlow road 
it comes to a dead end by the royal river 
the train tracks are right there 
me and my dad fished out there 
if they had known you were under there 
they would ve killed you 
could he have gotten all the way from
chamberlain to harlow  that s really far 
sure  he probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way 
yeah  right 
and then after dark  a train must have
come along and  el smako  
i bet you  if we find him 
we ll get our pictures in the paper 
we could even be on tv 
  sure 
  we ll be heroes 
i don t know  billy will know i found out 
he s not going to care 
 cause it s gonna be us that find him 
not billy and charlie hogan 
and the boosted the car 
they ll probably pin a medal on you 
you think so 
sure 
what ll we tell our folks 
exactly what you said 
we ll tell our folks
that we re tenting in your backfield 
you tell your folks
your sleeping at teddy s 
then we say we re going
to the drag races the next day 
we re rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night 
man that s a plan and a half 
but  if we find the body in south harlow 
they ll know we didn t go to the races 
we ll get hided 
nobody will care   
   because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery   
   it won t make a difference 
my dad will hide me anyway 
but it s worth it 
  shit  yeah 
  let s do it  what do you say 
  all right 
  gordie 
sure 
vern 
i don t know 
come on  vern o

  thanks 
two for flinching 
how far do you think it s gonna be 
if we follow the tracks all the way
into harlow  it should be about 20 miles 
sound about right to you 
it might even be 30 
maybe we should just hitchhike 
  no way  that sucks 
  why not 
we could go out to route 7
to the shiloh church   
   then down the back harlow road 
we ll be there by sundown 
that s pussy 
it s a long way 
did your mother ever have any kids
that lived

stand back  men 
paratroopers  over the side 
 no trespassing  was enforced
by milo pressman  the junkman   
    and his dog  chopper 
the most feared and least seen dog
in castle rock 
legend had it that milo had
trained chopper not just to sic   
    but to sic specific parts
of the human anatomy 
thus  a kid who had illegally scaled
the junkyard fence   
    might hear the dread cry 
 chopper  sic balls  
but right now neither the dread chopper
nor milo   
    was anywhere in sight 
teddy s crazy 
come on  men  move it out 
he won t live to be 20  i bet 
remember the time you saved him
in the tree 
i dream about that sometimes 
except in the dream i miss him 
i just get a few hairs and down he goes 
it s weird 
that is weird 
but you didn t miss him 
chris chambers never misses  does he 
not even when
the ladies leave the seat down 
race you 
  no  i don t think so 
  over to the pump 
  i m kind of tired  go 
  you re a dead man  lachance 
it looks like lachance
has got him this time 
he s got chambers beat 
but what s this 
chambers is making his move 
lachance is fading
and it s chambers at the tape 
the crowd goes wild 
you guys been watching
the mickey mouse club lately 
i think annette s tits are getting bigger 
  you think so 
  i think so 
i think he s right 
i ve been noticing that the a and the e
are starting to bend around the sides 
annette s tits are great 
this is a really good time 
the most 
a blast 
vern didn t just mean being off limits
inside the junkyard   
    or fudging on our folks   
    or going on a hike up the tracks
to harlow  he meant those things  but   
    it seems to me now it was more
and that we all knew it 
everything was there and around us 
we knew exactly who we were
and exactly where we were going 
it was grand 
great  spit at the fat kid  real good 
what time is it 
it s a quarter after one 
you d better go get the food 
junkyard opens at 3 00 
chopper ll be here

got wiped out on weed hill in durham 
he said they flipped for beers
and they came up with a goocher   
   just before they got in the car 
and  bang  they all got totalled

no shit 
she looks like a thanksgiving turkey 
  and  you know  this one time   
  shut up  vern 
right  go on  it s a swell story 
all the kids  instead of calling him davie 
they called him lardass  lardass hogan 
even his little brother
and sister called him lardass 
at school they put this sticker on his back
that says   wide load  
and they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance 
but one day he gets an idea 
the greatest revenge idea a kid ever had 
is this thing on  can you hear me 
the next contestant
in the great tri county pie eat   
    principal john wiggins 
and our celebrity contestant 
from klam in portland   
    the boss man himself  bob cormier 
from the racks and stacks
it s the best on wax   
    how about another double  golden oldie 
sound sandwich from klam in portland   
   it s   
  boss 
next  a newcomer to the pie eat 
but one we expect   
    great things from in the future 
young master david hogan 
  are you all right  young man 
  lardass how was your trip 
i hear you got a big appetite  lardass 
don t even think about winning this 
boy are you fat 
don t pay attention to those fools 
lardass  davie 
and now 
the one you ve all been waiting for 
the four time champion 
our own bill travis 
listen i got  10 riding
on you myself  billy boy 
all right  are you ready 
hands behind your backs  gentlemen 
drum roll 
hey  lardass  chow down  wide load 
go 
done 
done 
done 
you better pace yourself 
if you want to hold out 
come on  lardass 
lardass  lardass 
what the audience didn t know  was
that lardass wasn t interested in winning 
what he wanted was revenge 
and right before he was introduced 
he d gotten ready for it 
    principal john wiggins 
and our celebrity contestant
from klam in portland   
    the bossman himself  bob cormier 
from the racks and stacks
it s the best on wax   
    how about another double  golden oldie 
sound sandwich from klam in portland   
    it s   
done 
diving into his fifth pie  lardass began
to imagine that he wasn t eating pies 
he pretended he was eating cowflops   
    and rat guts in blueberry sauce 
done 
slowly  a sound started to build
in lardass s stomach 
a strange and scary sound   
    like a log truck coming
at you at 100 miles an hour 
suddenly  lardass opened his mouth   
    and before bill travis knew it   
    he was covered with five pies worth
of used blueberries 
the women in the audience screamed 
bossman bob cormier took one look
at bill travis and barfed on wiggins 
wiggins barfed on the lumberjack
that was sitting next to him 
mayor grundy barfed on his wife s tits 
but when the smell hit the crowd   
   that s when lardass s plan
really started to work 
girlfriends barfed on boyfriends 
kids barfed on their parents 
a fat lady barfed in her purse 
the donelley twins barfed on each other 
the women s auxiliary barfed all over
the benevolent order of antelopes 
and lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he d created 
a complete and total barfarama 
  too cool 
  that was the best  just the best 
then what happened 
what do you mean 
i mean  what happened 
what do you mean   what happened  
that s the end 
how can that be the end  what kind of an
ending is that  what happens to lardass 
i don t know 
maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers 
jesus  that ending sucks 
why don t you make it
so that lardass goes home   
   and he shoots his father 
then he runs away
and he joins the texas rangers 
how about that 
i don t know 
something good like that 
i like the ending  the barfing was good 
but there s one thing
i didn t understand 
did lardass have to pay
to get into the contest 
no  vern  they just let him in 
great  great story 
it s a great story 
i just didn t like the ending 
where s the radio 
let s see if we can get some sounds 
here 
we talked into the night 
the kind of talk that seemed important
until you discover girls 
all right 
mickey s a mouse  donald s a duck 
pluto s a dog 
what s goofy 
if i could only have one food
for the rest of my life 
that s easy  pez 
cherry flavored pez 
no question about it 
goofy s a dog  he s definitely a dog 
i knew the  64 000 question was fixed 
there s no way anybody can know
that much about opera 
he can t be a dog 
he wears a hat and drives a car 
wagon train is a really cool show   
   but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere 
they just keep wagon training 
god  that s weird 
what the hell is goofy 
not one of us mentioned ray brower 
but we were all thinking about him 
oh  my god 
it s the brower kid 
his ghost is out walking in the woods 
i promise i won t hock
no more dirty books 
i promise i won t say no more bad swears 
i promise i ll eat my lima beans 
two for flinching 
what is it  chris 
maybe it s coyotes 
sounds like a woman screaming 
it s not coyotes  it s his ghost 
don t say that 
teddy  sit down 
i m gonna go look for it 
i want to see the ghost 
don t say that 
i just want to see it 
i just want to see what he looks like 
jesus h  bald headed christ 
maybe we should stand guard 
that s a good idea 
give me the gun 
i ll take the first watch 
23 00 hours 
corporal teddy duchamp stands guard 
no sign of the enemy  the fort is secure 
shut up  teddy 
and keep your eyes peeled 
  cut it out 
  i m trying to sleep 
the dogfaces rested easy   
   in the knowledge that
corporal teddy duchamp   
   was protecting all that was dear to them 
it should have been you  gordon 
are you okay 
you were dreaming 
i didn t cry at denny s funeral 
i miss him  chris 
i really miss him 
i know 
go back to sleep 
maybe you could go
into the college courses with me 
that ll be the day 
why not  you re smart enough 
they won t let me 
what do you mean 
it s the way the people think
of my family in this town 
it s the way they think of me  i m just one
of those low life chambers kids 
that s not true 
it is 
no one asked me if i took the milk money 
i just got a three day vacation 
did you take it 
yeah  i took it  you knew i took it 
teddy knew i took it 
everyone knew i took it 
even vern knew  i think 
maybe i was sorry 
and i tried to give it back 
you tried to give it back 
maybe  just maybe 
maybe i took it to old lady simons
and told her  and the money was all there 
but i still got a three day vacation 
because it never showed up 
and maybe the next week 
old lady simons   
   had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school 
yeah  it was brown and it had dots on it 
let s just say that i stole the milk money 
but old lady simons stole it back from me 
just suppose that i told this story 
me  chris chambers 
kid brother to eyeball chambers 
do you think anyone
would have believed it 
no 
you think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags   
   from the view 
if they had taken the money 
  no way 
  hell  no 
but  with me   
i m sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time 
anyway  she saw her chance
and she took it 
i was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back 
i just never thought   
i never thought that a teacher   
who gives a fuck anyway 
i just wish   
   that i could go someplace
where nobody knows me 
i guess i m just a pussy 
no way  man 
the freight woke up the other guys   
    and it was on the tip of my tongue
to tell them about the deer  but i didn t 
that was the one thing i kept to myself 
i ve never spoken or written of it
until just now 
how come you didn t get
some breakfast stuff like   
   twinkies  and pez  and root beer 
sorry  i guess a more experienced shopper
could ve gotten more for your 7 cents 
with our stomachs rumbling 
we pressed on toward the royal river 
the reality of ray brower was growing 
and kept us moving despite the heat 
for me  the idea
of seeing that kid s dead body   
    was starting to become an obsession 
gentlemen  the royal 
god  the tracks go way out of the way 
we cut across this field right here 
we ll be there in an hour 
i think we should stick to the tracks 
i say we go across the field 
gordie

on your mother s good name   
   you won t tell nobody 
billy and charlie had managed to keep
their enormous secret for about 36 hours 
a personal record for both of them 
by noon  ace and eyeball had told
their secret to everybody in the gang 
i guess for those guys  protecting their
mother s good name wasn t a top priority 
ace  maybe me and charlie shouldn t go 
maybe you could go without us 
you guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit 
i don t see your problem 
we take a bunch of fishing gear 
so if a cop asks us what we re doing 
 we re here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river  look what we found

but we came all this way 
we re supposed to be heroes 
not this way  teddy 
chris  give me a hand 
ray brower s body was found   
    but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit 
we decided that an anonymous phone call
was the best thing to do 
we headed home  and although
many thoughts raced through our minds   
    we barely spoke 
we walked all night
and made it back to castle rock   
    a little past 5 00 on sunday morning 
the day before labour day 
we d only been gone two days 
but somehow the town seemed different   
    smaller 
see you in school 
see you in junior high 
penny 
i better get home  before my mom
puts me on the  10 most wanted list  
no hard feelings  okay 
no way  man 
as time went on we saw less and less
of teddy and vern   
    until eventually they became
just two more faces in the halls 
it happens sometimes 
friends come in and out of your life
like busboys in a restaurant 
i heard that vern got married
out of high school  had four kids   
    and is now the forklift operator
at the arsenault lumber yard 
teddy tried to get into the army 
but his eyes and his ear kept him out 
last i d heard
he d spent some time in jail   
    and was now doing odd jobs
around castle rock 
i m never gonna get out of this town 
am i  gordie 
you can do anything you want  man 
sure 
give me some skin 
i ll see you 
not if i see you first 
chris did get out 
he enrolled in the
college courses with me 
and although it was hard 
he gutted it out like he always did 
he went on to college
and eventually became a lawyer 
last week 
he entered a fast food restaurant 
just ahead of him 
two men got into an argument 
one of them pulled a knife 
chris  who d always made the best peace 
tried to break it up 
he was stabbed in the throat 
he died almost instantly 
dad  can we go now 
  you ready
