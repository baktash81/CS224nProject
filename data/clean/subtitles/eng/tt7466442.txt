  an8 reporter  mr  fischoeder

  an8 i refer all further questions
  an8 to my personal attorney
  an8 and personal cousin 
grover fischoeder 
  an8 my client is innocent
and we re gonna prove it 
  an8 yeah  sure  a bullet
from my brother s gun
  an8   was found in the guy s body 
  uh     chuckles nervously 
  an8 felix  and sure  a lot of
people heard him yelling 
  an8  i m going to kill you  carnie 
  an8  and i m going to bury your body
  an8  where no one can
find it   sure 
  an8   grover  uh    yeah 
  but who among us
  an8 hasn t said those exact words
  an8 while gambling with carnies
on a stormy night  huh 
  an8 uh  no one  we ve
all said those words 
 sighs  maybe we ll
be his one phone call 
oh  the weather 
 forecaster speaking
indistinctly 
teddy  hey  wharfiversary
stuff s still going on 
i heard they re doing
half priced rides
and free popcorn 
yeah  kinda busy out there 
teddy  hmm  people do not
seem to mind going to a park
owned by a murderer 
linda  if only we could
get to the people 
why can t restaurants
move around  you know 
  just hop over the hole 
  huh 
why can t buildings
have little legs 
that d be cute  yeah 
or motors  and wheels 
that s cars 
oh  yeah  that s cars 
 drawling  oh  god 
oh  no 
  oh  boy 
  is dad okay

  oh  no  no  no 
  linda  um   
dad  i don t wanna
stop your flow 
but can you pass the pilaf 
  oh  god 
  that s butter 
you know what  butter s better 
 continues drawling  oh  no 
how you doin  there  big guy 
 sighs  i don t know 
i mean  i held it together
in front of the
kids during dinner 
but i m really worried 
oh  yeah  i couldn t tell 
it s just our landlord s
gonna go to prison 
the bank s gonna
call in our loan 
and then they ll take
our restaurant stuff 
and we will live in
a box on the street 
this is what s gonna happen 
oh  bob  i need you 
the kids need you 
what do you mean  you
and the kids need me
to not go out of business 
no  going out of business
down there is not as bad
as going out of
business in there 
my soft pec 
no  your heart 
look  i know you re
droopy bob right now 
but you know who else
is in there  dreamy bob 
the guy who wanted
to open a restaurant
in the first place 
slap his name on it 
make cuckoo crazy burgers
with wild ingredients 
a new one every day 
i did not say  cuckoo
crazy  burgers 
i would not say that 
you know what i mean 
super funky burgers 
well  no matter what i said 
i think that maybe
dreamy bob is dumb
and droopy bob just kinda
sees things the way they are 
you know what you
gotta do to droopy bob 
um  what 
you gotta punch him in
the nuts  like this 
  ow 
  sorry  sorry  sorry 
but you know what i m
saying  it s like a metaphor 
  like this 
  ow 
stop  it s not a metaphor
if you actually do it 
yes  it is 
i m going to
sleep  good night 
and  hey  who knows 
maybe mr  fischoeder
is innocent 
he gets out  we put
that wink in the bank 
i don t know if he s innocent 
but he is going to prison 
well  at least the
other prisoners
will like his eyepatch 
that s a good look for prison 
you know  conversation starter 
 dramatic music playing 
bye  kids  have fun at school 
gene  i hope we do okay
on that math homework 
i was really wingin  it  four 
i hope so too  good guess 
 gene and tina yelp 
all right  emergency
kid meeting 
what  now  here 
yeah  we gotta talk 
outdoor  before school 
emergency kid meeting 
is this about
whatever s going on
with tina s bangs right now 
i ve been wanting to
fix them all morning 
  wait  what 
  louise  no  listen 
i heard mom and dad
talking last night 
the restaurant is
in big trouble 
  boy trouble  girl trouble 
  all the trouble 
mr  fischoeder
can t go to prison 
if he does  mom and
dad won t be able
to pay the bank 
and then that s it 
no more restaurant 
and what are we gonna do
with mom and dad after school
if there s no more restaurant 
  huh 
  sign them up for sports 
but the good news is 
i think mr  fischoeder
is innocent 
innocent  but what
about how guilty he is 
well  why was he so
relaxed about that hole 
if you had buried a
guy in that exact spot 
wouldn t you be a little
more anxious to fill it in 
or at least go sneak
that sucker out of there
and stick them somewhere else 
like how you re hide
your journal every night 
no  i don t 
so  here s the plan 
we need to skip school   
  no 
  yes 
we need to gather evidence 
talk to witnesses 
we need to start now 
but  louise  if you don t think
mr  fischoeder
did it  who did 
here s what i m thinking 
this was actually a beef
between two carnies 
  beef con carnie 
  louise  mm hmm 
you get your hands
on fischoeder s gun 
you settle your score
with cotton candy dan 
you just got away with murder 
so  what do we do
with that theory 
turn it into a graphic novel 
louise  no  we go talk
to our old pal mickey 
he s a carnie now 
he probably knows all
the carnie gossip 
and i brought all
the gear we ll need 
snacks  gum  night light 
oh  snacks  i m in 
  night light 
  yeah  in case it gets dark 
i thought we were doing
this during school time 
i don t know why i
mentioned the light 
let s just get our
bikes  shall we 
 sighs  fine  i did forget
to do a bunch of homework 
great  so  we have to
get past the back door
without mom and dad seeing us 
stay low  follow my lead 
try to look like alley trash 
gene  or raccoon poop 
 jazzy music playing 
 whispers  we did
that really well 
all right  save
mr  fischoeder 
save the restaurant 
solve a murder 
on three  one  two  three 
all  save mr  fischoeder 
save the restaurant 
solve a murder 
and prove we re not babies 
and chloe barbash is dumb 
okay  let s move 
this is how law and order
should start  every time 
louise  hi  we re
looking for mickey 
  mickey 
  louise  yeah  mickey 
brown hair  used to rob banks 
nice guy  works here now

  dollars 
  and seventy five 
  cents 
  yeah  cents 
louise  where is he working
today  scream i cane 
ah  he s off till second shift

we could probably remind him
about the three seventy five 
he lives in carniapolis 
most of the carnies
live in carniapolis 
that makes sense 
where is carniapolis 
hang a left at the
old dog food building 
but don t go there 
  don t go there 
  the dog food building 
yeah  down past the stadium 
you ll smell it  then go left 
but seriously  don t go there 
uh  is there a reason you
keep saying   don t go there  
  because you shouldn t 
  okey dokey 
just wanted to clarify 
but  um  why should we   
hi  is the park open 
no  i m just here  cause i m
trapped inside this booth 
yes  we re open  all
rides half off today 
the only crime would be
to not take advantage
of these prices 
okay  new sign  i

   we have a  hole  new look  
  bob  mm 
 come on in through the alley

  mm

  linda  mm 
  bob  linda  come  come see

law  they re both laws 
bob  we have to sell
  some burgers today  right

  okay  bob  grab your meat

smells like the most stuff
you can grind up to make food 
tina  oh  look  that
was their slogan 
gene  huh 
tina  this doesn t look
right  no one lives here 
gene  i don t know
why  it s beautiful 
 indistinct yelling 
louise  whoa  you hear that 
tina  huh  they sound cranky 
louise  let s check it
out  tina  oh  okay 
i miss school 
i m feeling suddenly
like i love fractions 
tina  yeah  i wanna learn
about photosynthesis
so badly right now 
if this is carniapolis 
maybe we shouldn t disturb
their scary sounding
carnie time 
i mean  it s a little like
they re deciding who to shiv
and if they see us  they ll be
like   oh  let s shiv them  
but you know  maybe not 
 indistinct yelling continues 
 ominous music plays 
tina  are they playing
a game with duckies 
gene  adorably 
lucky ducky 
lucky ducky  damn 
  kids 
  hi  mickey 
how s it going 
you here to buy drugs 
you don t buy drugs 
i can t even swallow pills 
we have to hide
them in his food 
we  uh  wanted to ask
you some questions 
mickey  your turn 
oh  can you skip me 
we play lucky ducks  but
we play carnie rules 
tina  seems fun 
there s more beer and yelling
than when kids play
it at wonder wharf 
yeah  well  we re
toasting cotton candy dan 
that s why we re also gambling
and pushing each other
and punching each other 
the first shift folks made
a nice little memorial
to put on the pier
in his old spot 
and us second shift folks
are  uh  doing this 
uh huh 
   whispers  just ask him 
   whispers  i will 
but pretty soon  right 
give me a second 
i can t just say 
 hey  mickey  which carnie
killed cotton candy dan  
wait  did you say 
 which carnie killed
cotton candy dan  
 laughs awkwardly 
louise  it did sound
like that  didn t it 
you come in to carniapolis
and accuse a carnie of
killing another carnie 
i think that s
right  is that right 
you know  it s bad enough
that mr  fischoeder
kills one of us 
which is bad boss
alert  am i right 
  yeah 
  but to throw it back on us 
hey  hey  they re just kids 
kid cops  little kid cops 
they have those  you know 
for going into small
spaces and hiding in boxes 
nah  i know these guys 
they re not cops  they re
little burger babies 
   louise growls 
  maybe don t use that word 
what   burger  
sorry  meat patties 
it s just too much 
first fischoeder kills
cotton candy dan  now this 
i may have a tattoo of a dagger
stabbing a heart going
up into his skull
and it says  dead inside  
but i have feelings  you know 
 singing  some lucky
ducks get all the luck
some break their
backs to make a buck
   upbeat music playing 
  and sure  we are a bunch
of shady criminal ish
gents and ladies
 but we did our time  yeah
 we paid for our crimes
 well  most of us 
and our misdemeanors
now we sell fried
dough and wieners
even though we re kinda
sketchy gals and fellas
doesn t mean that fischoeder
 can go and kill us  uh uh 
working here can really be
 a roller coaster
 carnie  hup 
one day you re cleaning vomit
next you re on a missing poster
it s such a drag
to have a boss
 who pays you bad
 who pays us bad
then bumps you off
some lucky ducks
 get all the luck
 oh  yes  they do
 but that s not us  no  sir 
 unlucky schmucks  sing it 
it really stinks
   grunting rhythmically 
  it really sucks
so we ll just play
our lucky ducks
cool  have fun with that 
should we get going 
 singing  some lucky
ducks get all the luck
you ve said your
piece  now listen up
to me  your life 
it seems just fine
you think that s
bad  try being nine
the other day 
things got real crazy
a girl at school
called me a baby
   all gasp 
  what 
yeah 
even though i m small  well 
i can tell you for sure
i m gonna be the one
that solves this frickin  murder
i know you all think
fischoeder s the one
who did it
but i will find the evidence
to get him acquitted
 i m just a kid  all 
it s such a drag
 that s what they
say  to have a boss
 now run along
 who pays you bad
 now go and play
 then bumps you off
 some lucky ducks
 it really stinks
 get all the luck
 it really sucks
 until i show  so
we ll just play
 them what is what
 our lucky ducks
 upbeat music continues 
i m gonna show them
 all what i can do
  carnies vocalizing 
gonna show  em i m much
braver than what you
think that i am 
even though i m small
no matter whatever 
gonna show you all
louise  come on  we
don t need their help 
tina  have a nice day 
see  they re not cops 
cops don t dance
around like that 
they dance like this   grunts 
louise   scoffs  more
like carni crapolis 
gene  i liked it 
i think i m gonna have my
next birthday party there 
tina  oh  good idea 
yeah  the theme s
gonna be  disgruntled  
that s nice 
um    am i being paranoid 
or is that big scary
carnie following us 
 gasps  maybe he
just remembered
that he forgot to murder us 
  oh  god 
  quick  this way 
 all panting 
tina  dead end 
gene  that s worse
than split ends 
uh  tina  why d you
say go this way 
  tina  i didn t 
   all scream 
 gasps  oh  sorry 
didn t mean to scare you 
no  no  of course not 
just following kids into alleys 
everybody loves that 
 chuckles nervously 
is there something
we can do for you 
you were asking who wanted
to kill cotton candy dan 
no  i mean  before 
but not anymore 
we ve moved on 
i got something to tell you 
i didn t wanna
say it back there 
they don t wanna hear
what i gotta say 
we re listening 
but maybe not
making eye contact 
i was there that
night  you know 
the last night anyone saw dan 
  you were 
  yeah 
we were playing lucky
ducky on the wharf 
and sure  dan and
mr  fischoeder
got into a big fight 
mr  fischoeder started
throwing ducks at dan s head 
he kept yelling  duck  
and it was confusing 
i can see that 
anyway  after the
game  i went back
 cause i forgot my stress ball 
and it s just dan 
mr  fischoeder 
and felix fischoeder 
and they re yelling
at each other 
and they re all throwing ducks 
wait  felix was at the game 
no  he wasn t 
mr  fischoeder doesn t
let him play lucky ducky
because felix gives
all the duckies
different voices
and personalities
and it makes it take a while 
that s why it was weird that
he showed up that night 
but nobody back
there wants to hear
that maybe mr  fischoeder
didn t do it 
oh  my god  of course 
felix fischoeder 
it s so felix 
he has access to
mr  fischoeder s gun 
he was fighting with
both mr  fischoeder
and cotton candy dan 
and most importantly 
he has a motive 
he has a motive to
frame his brother 
because he s mad
mr  fischoeder doesn t like
his lucky ducky voices 
no  because i bet you
if mr  fischoeder goes to
jail  felix gets his money 
we gotta go to the cops 
oh  uh  mind if i
don t go to the cops 
i have to pick up
my dry cleaning 
because it s dry now 
  louise  yeah  no problem 
  okay 
louise  let s go 
let s go  let s go 
gene  thank you  scary
carnie  love you  bye 
carnie  bye 
teddy  well  everything

what s this for 
  olive bar

have imported olives 
and they could go there 
  oh  i m not sure   
  while you wait for a burger 
you help yourself to
an imported olive 
okay 
i got these on my way
over  you can pay me later 
  mm 
  mobile bob burger mobile

look for you in robbery 
but they said you

at a dangerous
biker gang headquarters 
and we said   the
one eyed snakes  
and they said   yeah

but i didn t know he
swallowed the damn thing 
and you have that weird
tooth for some reason 
and it matches my scar 
and now everyone thinks

just  cause i did 
unbelievable  you killed
cotton candy andy 
  tina  dan 
  cotton candy andy dan

we were saving the restaurant
and solving a murder 
solving a murder is no
reason to leave school 
okay  department of education 
shush  shush  shush 
i m so annoyed 
how did you find us  how
did you even get in here 
  we saw the kids  bikes 
  ugh  bikes 
and their bikes
were by some stairs 
so  we went up 
and we went into the
little electrical place 
  yay  buttons 
  linda  no 
 both screaming 
yeah  mom 
  no  no cheering 
  sorry 
 singing  diarrhea s
comin  back
   midtempo music playing 
  my family s under attack
it s not so great  i do agree
i ve also got a bad wedgie
thought i could
prove i m not a baby
but now all of us need saving
dropped my hopes into the ocean
sorry if a fish is chokin 
sure  a lot is happening
but i wish i brought
my napkin thing
it might have helped
to calm us down
everybody  hush 
don t make a sound 
but why are you doing all this 
okay  good question 
i ll allow it 
 singing in falsetto 
look  i m not that evil  no
i m not a bad person
so  i killed one carnie
well  it s just
 cause i m determined
to finally get what i
think that i m deservin 
and to turn it into
something worthy
trust me  i m sure
you will agree
would you like to
hear my master plan 
okay  can you answer
faster  cause i asked you
would you like to
hear my master plan 
um  yes 
okay  that s more like it
i m so glad that you asked
you see  i m in the
fischoeder family trust 
because i m in the family 
well  barely 
he s from the bad
part of the family 
he means the poor part 
they re bad because
they re poor 
shut it  shut your front door 
  okay  okay 
  others  yeah 
i said okay 
so  in this family
trust  you see 
you re ineligible
to receive benefits
if you ve been
convicted of a felony 
and every single one
of them has been 
all except for cousin calvin 
because he never got caught 
  yeah  baby 
  grover  shush 
so  i frame him  and boom 
now  if something
unfortunate happens
to calvin and felix 
whom will they suspect 
not me  no  no 
no  why would they 
something unfortunate is
going to happen to us 
uh  yes  surprise 
  oh  poo 
  wait  both of us 
yeah  sorry  you
were so insistent
about going with your
brother to cuba   
  i bought an outfit 
  yes  we know 
but let s just
say your submarine
isn t going to go to cuba 
oh  cancun 
it won t make it out
from under the pier 
  oh  my 
  oh  dear 
did you think that sub
was gonna make it to cuba 
hmm  i think we
might have gotten
a little too excited
about the sub idea 
i mean  isn t it
just an old ride 
yes  it runs on tokens 
but not the best
frame job  right 
i mean  why bury
cotton candy dan
in front of our restaurant
and then wait six years 
belchers  huh  tina  right 
i didn t bury him in
front of your restaurant 
and i didn t wanna
wait six years 
 dramatically  six years 
easy  easy 
maybe we should hold
off on the questions 
i had it all worked
out  a top rate murder 
i shoot mr  carnie
with calvin s gun 
i stick him in a pile of dirt 
or whatever yucky stuff
was near the entrance
to the wharf 
i leave the stupid
foot sticking out 
so someone would
be sure to see it 
but little did i know
that some numbskull
backhoe operator
working for the city was
gonna scoop up that pile
without even checking
for dead carnies 
i come back  i ve got no body 
i didn t know where
they d brought the dirt 
and it s not like i
could go around asking 
 hey  what s the word  did
anyone find any dead guys 
 this tall  kind of a biter  
it was a nightmare 
but thankfully  blessedly 
your stupid pipe burst
and saved the day 
the skeleton was found 
frame job back on 
and it s true what they say 
good things happen
to good people 
wait a second 
is this all about your
silly mega park idea 
  yes 
  calvin  mm hmm 
 singing  this is
about my mega park
my much more efficient
and profitable
than your stupid pier mega park
  an8  it ll have gift shops  oh 
 so many giftshops
 i love giftshops 
 and so much
parking  bob  lin 
and i ll get the best marketers
to do the best marketing
and indoor motion
simulator rides
if you could see my scale models
then you d understand
why cotton candy dan
had to die
  it s gonna be so worth it 
  okay 
because business dreams
are about business 
they re not about dreams 
  that s not true 
  all right then 
i think i got it figured out
i think that this is what i need
you re gonna all get in the sub
and then i ll launch
you in the sea
no  no  i don t
think that s right
no  that s right 
you won t be able to get out
the handle s broken from inside
 then the pier will
be on fire  all  what 
well  you caused
it  then you died
 harmonizing  oh 
that s so careless of us
yeah  what they ll say is this 
metal wheels on metal tracks
will cause a spark 
a little flare
whoops  the drapes 
they catch on fire
and it just gets
worse from there
up it goes into the molehill
which now seems to be quite full
of cute and fluffy  very burny
flammable stuffed animals
  so  they don t come to life 
  i guess not 
and then the molehill
turns into mole hell 
that s what we call dad s back 
  we do 
  oh  oh oh
i have so many
problems with this plan
like what  people on the pier 
gone  i m closing
early  what else 
you would burn in the fire  too 
nope  i made a fuse
out of cooking oil 
sugar and balloon string 
all things you d find
in an amusement pier 
it s gonna go up the stairs 
over the roof of
this stupid room 
and arson investigators
will never suspect a thing
my fuse and my brilliant
flammable stuffed animals idea
gives me just enough time
to get back to the gym 
which is my alibi 
i went there just an hour ago
i said the steam
room was too steamy
i made a pretty damn big show
then i slipped out the window
and that s how i got here now
i just sneak back in
through the window
and boom
i ve been at the gym three hours
i don t know if you have
three hour gym body  sorry 
yeah  it s not believable 
  no  you re too pasty 
   grunts angrily 
also  your mega park is
mega dumb  and so are you 
 grunts angrily 
 sighs  i want to amend
my earlier statement 
  here we go 
  i m not that evil 
but i m feeling evil today
 music ends in flourish 
carnie  closing
the park early

bravest people i know 
louise  it s not true 
also  you don t know
that many people 
bob  hmm 
louise  i ve never been
brave  come on  the ears 
the only reason i got
these in the first place
was because i was scared 
bob  what  linda 
what do you mean 
louise  you know 
you gave them to me
 cause i was scared about
the first day of preschool 
that s not how it happened 
i mean  you were nervous 
and we had this idea
to make you the hat 
your mother made it 
it s sort of in honor of my mom 
your grandmother 
she used to wear this
brightly colored winter hat 
even in warm weather 
it was a little weird 
but it was kinda cute  i guess 
she always said it was
 cause she didn t feel
like doing her hair 
i think she just liked it 
and i had extra material 
so  uh  rabbit ears 
but i made them after your
first day at preschool 
to celebrate  because
you were so brave 
louise  really  i was 
bon and linda  yeah 
bob  do you not
remember it that way 
louise  no 
bob  yeah  you
didn t need them 
linda  you were plenty
brave  with no hat at all 
we were so proud of you 
  you slapped a kid 
  louise  i did 
linda  yeah  probably for
a good reason  let s say 
bob  you remind me
of my mom  louise 
and with the hat 
it s kinda like
you two have met 
i keep forgetting
that you never did 
gene  i wore that bucket
on my head for a while 
any fun stories about that 
bob  no  i don t remember
any  we were concerned 
louise  well  thanks 
for the hat and stuff 
bob  yep  glad we
could clear that up 
  since we re dying 
   all groan 
i mean  since we re
just hanging out 
alive  under the ground 
i m gonna push on the
window with my head 
   thud 
  ow   grunting 
this is not working 
linda  that s it
then  we re goners 
bob  wait  no 
don t you give up 
linda  i m tired  bob 
bob  no  you never give up 
i give up  and then you
say   don t give up  
and i say   okay  
and then we do
that over and over 
and now that i m
saying it out loud 
that can t be fun for you 
oh  god  do you want a
divorce before we die 
i don t deserve you 
linda  nah  i

the new section of pipe is
plastic  we lost a tire

we re really good at parkouring 
or i m really good
at parkouring 
anyway  i found this 
   gasps

the same kind of barrette 
do you want it  it
smells like seaweed 
  jimmy jr  
  yeah 
there s something i
wanted to ask you 
something summer

it was a stupid question

   zeke grunts 
  and my heart was an idiot   
  oh 
  zeke  rolling  rolling 
i m doing parkour off the
locker  jay ju  you see me

zeke  parkour 
uh  what were you saying 
oh  i was saying  i thought
my heart was an idiot

my barrette clace

romance in the world

no romance in the world
