oh no
oh no no no
linda um
dad i dont wanna
stop your flow
but can you pass the pilaf
oh god
thats butter
you know what butters better
continues drawling oh no
how you doin there big guy
sighs i dont know
i mean i held it together
in front of the
kids during dinner
but im really worried
oh yeah i couldnt tell
its just our landlords
gonna go to prison
the banks gonna
call in our loan
and then theyll take
our restaurant stuff
and we will live in
a box on the street
this is whats gonna happen
oh bob i need you
the kids need you
what do you mean you
and the kids need me
to not go out of business
no going out of business
down there is not as bad
as going out of
business in there
my soft pec
no your heart
look i know youre
droopy bob right now
but you know who else
is in there dreamy bob
the guy who wanted
to open a restaurant
in the first place
slap his name on it
make cuckoo crazy burgers
with wild ingredients
a new one every day
i did not say cuckoo
crazy burgers
i would not say that
you know what i mean
super funky burgers
well no matter what i said
i think that maybe
dreamy bob is dumb
and droopy bob just kinda
sees things the way they are
you know what you
gotta do to droopy bob
um what
you gotta punch him in
the nuts like this
ow
sorry sorry sorry
but you know what im
saying its like a metaphor
like this
ow
stop its not a metaphor
if you actually do it
yes it is
im going to
sleep good night
and hey who knows
maybe mr fischoeder
is innocent
he gets out we put
that wink in the bank
i dont know if hes innocent
but he is going to prison
well at least the
other prisoners
will like his eyepatch
thats a good look for prison
you know conversation starter
dramatic music playing
bye kids have fun at school
gene i hope we do okay
on that math homework
i was really wingin it four
i hope so too good guess
gene and tina yelp
all right emergency
kid meeting
what now here
yeah we gotta talk
outdoor before school
emergency kid meeting
is this about
whatevers going on
with tinas bangs right now
ive been wanting to
fix them all morning
wait what
louise no listen
i heard mom and dad
talking last night
the restaurant is
in big trouble
boy trouble girl trouble
all the trouble
mr fischoeder
cant go to prison
if he does mom and
dad wont be able
to pay the bank
and then thats it
no more restaurant
and what are we gonna do
with mom and dad after school
if theres no more restaurant
huh
sign them up for sports
but the good news is
i think mr fischoeder
is innocent
innocent but what
about how guilty he is
well why was he so
relaxed about that hole
if you had buried a
guy in that exact spot
wouldnt you be a little
more anxious to fill it in
or at least go sneak
that sucker out of there
and stick them somewhere else
like how you rehide
your journal every night
no i dont
so heres the plan
we need to skip school
no
yes
we need to gather evidence
talk to witnesses
we need to start now
but louise if you dont think
mr fischoeder
did it who did
heres what im thinking
this was actually a beef
between two carnies
beef con carnie
louise mmhmm
you get your hands
on fischoeders gun
you settle your score
with cotton candy dan
you just got away with murder
so what do we do
with that theory
turn it into a graphic novel
louise no we go talk
to our old pal mickey
hes a carnie now
he probably knows all
the carnie gossip
and i brought all
the gear well need
snacks gum night light
oh snacks im in
night light
yeah in case it gets dark
i thought we were doing
this during school time
i dont know why i
mentioned the light
lets just get our
bikes shall we
sighs fine i did forget
to do a bunch of homework
great so we have to
get past the back door
without mom and dad seeing us
stay low follow my lead
try to look like alley trash
gene or raccoon poop
jazzy music playing
whispers we did
that really well
all right save
mr fischoeder
save the restaurant
solve a murder
on three one two three
all save mr fischoeder
save the restaurant
solve a murder
and prove were not babies
and chloe barbash is dumb

old dog food building
but dont go there
dont go there

indistinct yelling continues
ominous music plays
tina are they playing

and pushing each other
and punching each other
the first shift folks made
a nice little memorial
to put on the pier
in his old spot

but pretty soon right
give me a second
i cant just say
hey mickey which carnie
killed cotton candy dan
wait did you say
which carnie killed
cotton candy dan
laughs awkwardly
louise it did sound
like that didnt it
you come in to carniapolis
and accuse a carnie of
killing another carnie
i think thats
right is that right
you know its bad enough
that mr fischoeder
kills one of us
which is bad boss
alert am i right
yeah
but to throw it back on us
hey hey theyre just kids
kid cops little kid cops
they have those you know
for going into small
spaces and hiding in boxes
nah i know these guys
theyre not cops theyre
little burger babies
louise growls
maybe dont use that word
what burger
sorry meat patties
its just too much
first fischoeder kills
cotton candy dan now this
i may have a tattoo of a dagger
stabbing a heart going
up into his skull
and it says dead inside
but i have feelings you know
singing some lucky
ducks get all the luck
some break their
backs to make a buck
upbeat music playing
and sure we are a bunch
of shady criminalish
gents and ladies
but we did our time yeah
we paid for our crimes
well most of us
and our misdemeanors
now we sell fried
dough and wieners
even though were kinda
sketchy gals and fellas
doesnt mean that fischoeder
can go and kill us uhuh
working here can really be
a roller coaster
carnie hup
one day youre cleaning vomit
next youre on a missing poster
its such a drag
to have a boss
who pays you bad
who pays us bad
then bumps you off
some lucky ducks
get all the luck
oh yes they do
but thats not us no sir
unlucky schmucks sing it
it really stinks
grunting rhythmically
it really sucks
so well just play
our lucky ducks
cool have fun with that
should we get going
singing some lucky
ducks get all the luck
youve said your
piece now listen up
to me your life
it seems just fine
you think thats
bad try being nine
the other day
things got real crazy
a girl at school
called me a baby
all gasp
what
yeah
even though im small well
i can tell you for sure
im gonna be the one
that solves this frickin murder
i know you all think
fischoeders the one
who did it
but i will find the evidence
to get him acquitted
im just a kid all
its such a drag
thats what they
say to have a boss
now run along
who pays you bad
now go and play
then bumps you off
some lucky ducks
it really stinks
get all the luck
it really sucks
until i show so
well just play

our lucky ducks
upbeat music continues
im gonna show them
all what i can do
carnies vocalizing

braver than what you

even though im small
no matter whatever

louise come on we
dont need their help
tina have a nice day
see theyre not cops
cops dont dance
around like that
they dance like this grunts
louise scoffs more
like carnicrapolis
gene i liked it
i think im gonna have my
next birthday party there
tina oh good idea
yeah the themes
gonna be disgruntled
thats nice
um am i being paranoid
or is that big scary
carnie following us
gasps maybe he
just remembered
that he forgot to murder us
oh god
quick this way
all panting
tina dead end
gene thats worse
than split ends
uh tina whyd you
say go this way
tina i didnt
all scream
gasps oh sorry
didnt mean to scare you
no no of course not
just following kids into alleys
everybody loves that
chuckles nervously
is there something
we can do for you
you were asking who wanted
to kill cotton candy dan
no i mean before
but not anymore
weve moved on
i got something to tell you
i didnt wanna
say it back there
they dont wanna hear
what i gotta say
were listening
but maybe not
making eye contact
i was there that
night you know
the last night anyone saw dan
you were
yeah
we were playing lucky
ducky on the wharf
and sure dan and
mr fischoeder
got into a big fight
mr fischoeder started
throwing ducks at dans head
he kept yelling duck
and it was confusing
i can see that
anyway after the
game i went back
cause i forgot my stress ball
and its just dan
mr fischoeder
and felix fischoeder
and theyre yelling
at each other
and theyre all throwing ducks
wait felix was at the game
no he wasnt
mr fischoeder doesnt
let him play lucky ducky
because felix gives
all the duckies
different voices
and personalities
and it makes it take a while
thats why it was weird that
he showed up that night
but nobody back
there wants to hear
that maybe mr fischoeder
didnt do it
oh my god of course
felix fischoeder
its so felix
he has access to
mr fischoeders gun
he was fighting with
both mr fischoeder
and cotton candy dan
and most importantly
he has a motive
he has a motive to
frame his brother
because hes mad
mr fischoeder doesnt like
his lucky ducky voices
no because i bet you
if mr fischoeder goes to
jail felix gets his money
we gotta go to the cops
oh uh mind if i
dont go to the cops
i have to pick up
my dry cleaning
because its dry now
louise yeah no problem

everybody hush

but why are you doing all this
okay good question
ill allow it
singing in falsetto
look im not that evil no
im not a bad person
so i killed one carnie
well its just
cause im determined
to finally get what i
think that im deservin
and to turn it into
something worthy
trust me im sure
you will agree
would you like to
hear my master plan
okay can you answer
faster cause i asked you
would you like to
hear my master plan
um yes
okay thats more like it
im so glad that you asked
you see im in the
fischoeder family trust
because im in the family
well barely
hes from the bad
part of the family
he means the poor part
theyre bad because
theyre poor
shut it shut your front door
okay okay
others yeah
i said okay
so in this family
trust you see
youre ineligible
to receive benefits
if youve been
convicted of a felony
and every single one
of them has been
all except for cousin calvin
because he never got caught
yeah baby
grover shush
so i frame him and boom
now if something
unfortunate happens
to calvin and felix
whom will they suspect
not me no no
no why would they
something unfortunate is
going to happen to us
uh yes surprise
oh poo
wait both of us
yeah sorry you
were so insistent
about going with your
brother to cuba
i bought an outfit
yes we know
but lets just
say your submarine
isnt going to go to cuba
oh cancun
it wont make it out
from under the pier
oh my
oh dear
did you think that sub
was gonna make it to cuba
hmm i think we
might have gotten
a little too excited
about the sub idea
i mean isnt it
just an old ride
yes it runs on tokens
but not the best
frame job right
i mean why bury
cotton candy dan
in front of our restaurant
and then wait six years
belchers huh tina right
i didnt bury him in
front of your restaurant
and i didnt wanna
wait six years
dramatically six years
easy easy
maybe we should hold
off on the questions
i had it all worked
out a toprate murder
i shoot mr carnie
with calvins gun
i stick him in a pile of dirt
or whatever yucky stuff
was near the entrance
to the wharf
i leave the stupid
foot sticking out
so someone would
be sure to see it
but little did i know
that some numbskull
backhoe operator
working for the city was
gonna scoop up that pile
without even checking
for dead carnies
i come back ive got no body
i didnt know where
theyd brought the dirt
and its not like i
could go around asking
hey whats the word did
anyone find any dead guys
this tall kind of a biter
it was a nightmare
but thankfully blessedly
your stupid pipe burst
and saved the day
the skeleton was found
frame job back on
and its true what they say
good things happen
to good people
wait a second
is this all about your
silly megapark idea
yes
calvin mmhmm
singing this is
about my megapark
my much more efficient
and profitable
than your stupid pier megapark
an8itll have gift shops oh
so many giftshops
i love giftshops
and so much
parking bob lin
and ill get the best marketers
to do the best marketing
and indoor motion
simulator rides
if you could see my scale models
then youd understand
why cotton candy dan
had to die
its gonna be so worth it
okay
because business dreams
are about business
theyre not about dreams
thats not true
all right then
i think i got it figured out
i think that this is what i need
youre gonna all get in the sub
and then ill launch
you in the sea
no no i dont
think thats right
no thats right
you wont be able to get out
the handles broken from inside
then the pier will
be on fire all what
well you caused
it then you died
harmonizing oh
thats so careless of us
yeah what theyll say is this
metal wheels on metal tracks
will cause a spark
a little flare
whoops the drapes
they catch on fire
and it just gets
worse from there
up it goes into the molehill
which now seems to be quite full
of cute and fluffy very burny
flammable stuffed animals
so they dont come to life
i guess not
and then the molehill
turns into mole hell
thats what we call dads back
we do
oh ohoh
i have so many
problems with this plan
like what people on the pier
gone im closing
early what else
you would burn in the fire too
nope i made a fuse
out of cooking oil
sugar and balloon string
all things youd find
in an amusement pier
its gonna go up the stairs
over the roof of
this stupid room
and arson investigators
will never suspect a thing
my fuse and my brilliant
flammable stuffed animals idea
gives me just enough time
to get back to the gym
which is my alibi
i went there just an hour ago
i said the steam
room was too steamy
i made a pretty damn big show
then i slipped out the window
and thats how i got here now
i just sneak back in
through the window
and boom
ive been at the gym three hours
i dont know if you have
three hour gym body sorry
yeah its not believable
no youre too pasty
grunts angrily
also your megapark is
megadumb and so are you

i mean you were nervous
and we had this idea
to make you the hat
your mother made it
its sort of in honor of my mom
your grandmother
she used to wear this
brightlycolored winter hat
even in warm weather
it was a little weird
but it was kinda cute i guess
she always said it was
cause she didnt feel
like doing her hair
i think she just liked it
and i had extra material
so uh rabbit ears
but i made them after your
first day at preschool
to celebrate because
you were so brave
louise really i was
bon and linda yeah
bob do you not
remember it that way

bob yeah you
didnt need them
linda you were plenty
brave with no hat at all

a good reason lets say
bob you remind me
of my mom louise

its kinda like
you two have met
