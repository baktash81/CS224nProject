the perfume of decay
making a verse of bacteria
fermented wound
molecular spectacle
plotting a dance without organs
you inspire me 
with my poor spanish 
your spanish is perfect for poetry 
the wood swells and soaks up water
and whatever is in its surroundings 
it is hyrgroscopic 
wood is a hygroscopic material 
here  we can see   
how the presses holding the rings
need several days to   
for the materials to adhere 
so that it lasts 
with a low quality instrument 
it will peel away 
small cracks appear

how many flowers
do you intend to store 
a few hundred  different kinds 
it s for a farm 
  if you need an on site cold storage 
  yes 
we can provide you with the design
and colour of your choice 
here is our cold storage equipment 
especially designed for flowers 
this one is local 
and this one is from the netherlands 
in terms of the technology used 
they look identical 
this one  un ages  the flowers better 
they last around 30  longer 
in here  time stops 
they are all coated
with nano seal
which prevents all kinds of fungi
and other pathogens 
do you have a distributor in medellín 
yes  we do 
careful 
the fridges are assembled here 
those are the cutting machines 
for on site cold storage   
let me think 
i have a client from last year 
what s her name   
let me give you the address of a farm
not far from bogotá 
so you can see how it works 
i heard their sales skyrocketed
when they started using our fridges 
  may i

oh  i know where it is 
i ll prepare the quotes 
i leave you to look around 
we can meet out front

your relationship with your job 
 or leave it   
  hi

your relationship to it 
if you could get some distance

the excavation site
is a little bit further down 
depth   
and the bone measures   
39 centimeters long 
are you in pain 
sometimes  at elevation 
blood pressure can cause a  pop  sound 
it s not a  pop  
not a  pop  
what kind of pillows are you using 
i use different ones
because i travel a lot 
you should use an orthopedic pillow 
  for traveling 
  yes  maybe 
do you sleep well 
i don t sleep 
you don t sleep 
it might be a hallucination 
i don t think so 
does your father  mother 
or any family member
have any medical problems 
mental health issues 
no 
and your husband 
in this town  there are many people
with hallucinations 
maybe i just need something to relax 
a pill 
are you asking me for a xanax 
no  no 
maybe  yes 
that type of drug is quite addictive 
it s not a real cure 
looking at you  i think
you could become addicted to it 
why 
besides   
it will make you lose empathy 
you will no longer be moved
by the beauty of this world 
or the sadness of this world 
jesus is with you 
read it 
do you know salvador dali 
yes 
there s a painting of his
hanging at reception 
i saw it 
salvador dali understood
the beauty of this world 
but   
don t you think he was taking something 
no  i don t think so 
no  i don t think so 
definitely not 
are you okay 
i know where you re staying 
really 
at eduardo s place 
his father used to run a cinema 
his brother is a detective 
are you the anthropologist
from bogotá 
no  i m just passing through 
i live in medellín 
i ve never let this town 
no 
i remember everything 
so i try to limit what i see 
that s why i never watch
movies or tv 
you re missing some good things 
like what 
like sports 
football 
i don t think football
would do me any good 
maybe music 
news 
cooking shows 
miss universe 
there are plenty of stories already 
like this stone   
i hear a man   
he was on his lunch break 
two of his friends punched him
and stole his pendant 
one of them said 
 hey    psst 
let s take his food  too 
it looks delicious  
they took his bag and ran away 
he was beaten up again
for following them 
did you know him 
no 
it happened a long time ago 
but the vibrations   
were embedded here  in this stone 
this stone was part of the rock
he wasd sitting on 
the rocks  the trees  the concrete   
they absorb everything 
i too can feel the vibrations
stored in my body 
i remember everything i ve eaten 
the weather we ve had everyday 
the movement of my hand here 
on this fish 
i realized that   
i have no desire to go anywhere 
experiences are harmful 
they unleash a violent flurry
in my memory 
so i work the land 
i scale fish 
can i 
thank you 
i m jessica 
hernan 
that s the howler monkeys 
their leader is not happy 
he wants to move on 
but the others don t want to 
do you understand monkey language

in a few minutes 
the sun will hit that mountain 
i remember   
in space 
we were searching   
and then i was born 
i m not sure if i understand 
we were in space with the others 
i spotted two lovers 
and then i was born 
these are a good human invention 
what are they 
some pills 
i managed to get them
from a very tough doctor 
i think you would like them 
but aren t they for you 
i don t think they will help me 
i hear this sound 
but now  i want more of it 
it s strange 
i just remember when i was a baby 
my mother s blouse 
my nose was burning 
i heard very loud noises 
and i cried 
do you also remember your dreams 
no 
i   
our kind never dreams 
what happens when you sleep 
nothing 
can you show me 
now 
yes  sleep 
hernan 
do you want water 
no 
how was it 
what 
death 
it s ok 
i just stopped 
the story of that one is my favourite 
really 
sorry 
  want some 
  yes 
i made it myself 
with my own herbs 
it s very strong 
this stuff brings me close
to what you call a dream 
yes 
another good human invention 
even made by you 
may i 
yes 
be careful 
you see the stain in the corner 
it s my blood 
that blade came from a blender 
i was hiding under the bed 
with others 
we could hear everything 
they were searching for us 
they searched for us all night 
i was here 
the cover was also blue 
my mother   
she touched and uncurled my fingers 
one by one 
she put my palm against her lips 
i put my face in the pillow 
i moved my head from side to side 
my nose burns 
the skin was peeling 
the shadows on the ceiling   
you are reading my memory 
i m like a hard disk 
and somehow   
you are an antenna 
it was dark 
it was 4 a m  and i needed to pee
but i couldn t go 
so i went there  under the bed 
i wasn t here  right 
no 
i was 
why are you crying 
they are not your memories 
this sound   
i keep hearing it 
is it yours  too 
yes 
but that was before our time 
let s take his food  too 
it looks delicious 
no  don t do it 
stop it 
you bastards

colombian archaeology
and history institute in bogotá
was notified 
and the positioning of the rock waste
was questioned last week
by santiago andrés gómez 
the pile was left out on
the tunnel s dump 
i didn t see it myself  though 
the rocks may contain
traces of arsenic and copper
that  as a result of rain 
may lead to water contamination
in the area below 
a tomb with the remains of two people 
and the bones
of a not yet identified animal 
no sign of tools 
or they have decomposed 
sadly  one of the skulls was crushed
by the tunnel machince
