jesus didnt come to free us from pain
he came to give us the strength to bear it
maybe he wanted this pain for me
no this was an accident
no it wasnt an accident
jesus chose me for this
jack
ask for the mercy of jesus christ
if it was an accident
why do i have to ask for his mercy
l will have mercy on whom i will have mercy
compassion on whom i will have compassion
dont be so prideful its a sin
the fearful the unbelieving
jack listen to me
murderers warmongers idolaters
and all liars have their part in the lake
jesus came to save us not to damn us
which burneth with fire and brimstone
revelation 21 8
jesus loves you but he also knows
how to punish arrogant sinners like you
as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
revelation 3 1 9
jesus betrayed me
stop this shit or youre going to hell
hell
this is hell
right here
youre damning your soul
ask christ for forgiveness
forgive me
i did everything he asked me to do i changed
i gave him my life and he betrayed me
he put that fucking truck in my hands
made me do his will and kill those people
but he didnt give me
the strength to save them
dont blaspheme you bastard
christ had nothing to do with this
god even knows when a single hair
moves on your head
and you taught me that
were gonna pray for you jack
