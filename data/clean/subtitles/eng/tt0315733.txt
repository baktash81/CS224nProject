get to tap some cheerleader s ass 
show off riding some pickle colored thunderbird 
but what s gonna happen if you shoot
a pregnant woman or an old man

the guilt will suck you down to the bone 
stealing ain t worth it 
going to church  reading the bible

and it s he who gives and he who takes away 
  yeah  right  he doesn t give a shit about us

jesus didn t come to free us from pain 
he came to give us the strength to bear it 
  maybe he wanted this pain for me 
  no  this was an accident 
no  it wasn t an accident 
jesus chose me for this 
jack   
ask for the mercy of jesus christ 
if it was an accident 
why do i have to ask for his mercy 
 l will have mercy on whom i will have mercy 
compassion on whom i will have compassion  
  don t be so prideful  it s a sin 
      the fearful  the unbelieving    
  jack  listen to me 
      murderers  warmongers  idolaters 
   and all liars have their part in the lake    
  jesus came to save us not to damn us 
    which burneth with fire and brimstone  
revelation 21  8 
jesus loves you but he also knows
how to punish arrogant sinners like you

  ask christ for forgiveness 
  forgive me 
i did everything he asked me to do  i changed 
i gave him my life and he betrayed me 
he put that fucking truck in my hands 
made me do his will and kill those people
but he didn t give me
the strength to save them 
don t blaspheme  you bastard

a lot sooner than you think 
let me ask you something 
i want you to be really honest with me  ok 
if i stay   
will i be saved

you re condemning yourself to a terrible death 
your heart won t work anymore 
you ll die  asphyxiated 
it s an awful death  paul  you can t imagine it 
  at least here we can help you to   
  you can help me die better

 how many lives do we live

 they say we all lose 21 grams
at the exact moment of our death 
 everyone 
 and how much fits into 21 grams 
 how much is lost

 how much goes with them 
 how much is gained 
 how much is gained 
 21 grams 
 the weight of a stack of five nickels 
 the weight of a hummingbird 
 a chocolate bar 
 how much do 21 grams weigh  
to maria eladia 
and when loss was burnt 
the maize fields became green again
one last kiss
one only
then i d let you go
hard for you
i ve fallen
but you can break my fall
i m broken
don t break me
when i hit the ground
some devil
some angel
has got me to the bones
you said always and forever
now i believe you  baby
you said always and forever
is such a long  lonely time
too drunk and
still drinking
it s just the way i feel
it s all right
that s what you told me
cos what we had was so beautiful
i feel heavy
like floating
at the bottom of the sea
you said always and forever
now i believe you  baby
you said always and forever
is such a long  lonely time
some devil is
stuck inside of me
i cannot set it free
i wish  i wish i was dead and you were breathing
just so that you could know
some angel is
stuck inside of me
i cannot set you free
