this is a dangerous place
crazy dangerous
but martha and i weve been here before

dr bravestone famed archaeologist
and international explorer
im so glad youve returned
ive been so anxious for your arrival
you talking to me
yes
once again jumanji is in great peril and only you can help
nigel were looking for our friend
have you seen like anyone
ruby roundhouse killer of men welcome to jumanji
killer of men
yeah i i kill guys
im so glad youve returned
ive been so anxious for your arrival
whats with this fella
my dearest mouse surely you remember me
nigel billingsly at your service
hey nigel i thought that was you
hes a what is it called
npc a nonplayer character
hes not a real person
he only has like a limited number of things he can say
my friend carl is just like that
nigel were looking for someone
has anyone else arrived here in jumanji
jumanji is in great peril
its all detailed in the letter i sent you dr bravestone
perhaps you should read it aloud
grandpa eddie
do you have a letter
do i have a letter
check your pockets
why would i have a letter
because nigel wrote you a letter
i didnt get a letter from this guy
but we are in a video game and
were in a video game
were gonna die
we did die
are we in hell
i knew it
oh my god
its all detailed in the letter i sent you dr bravestone
perhaps you should read it aloud
i dont have a letter
how many times i gotta tell you that
oh no eddie its in your hand
where did this come from
you got to pay attention to whats in your hand
perhaps you should read it aloud
dr bravestone
it is my solemn hope that this letter finds you for again
jumanji is in grave danger we need your help at once
whats going on here
its a cutscene
its how we find out the ill explain afterwards
you see our worst nightmare has come to pass
for jurgen the brutal has returned
indeed that most vicious jumanjian conqueror is back
and hes brought with him his savage horde
they descended from their fortress atop mount zhatmire
and made their way south to the avian province
home of the sacred falcon jewel
worn around the neck of the village elder
the falcon is the fertility jewel of jumanji
and it has been guarded by the people
of the avian province for hundreds of years
so long as the jewel can see the sun
the waters will flow and the land will flourish
yeah
many brave souls died that day
but jurgen got what he came for
he stowed the jewel in darkness
hidden from the sun
a drought befell the land
the crops dried out and died
and if the jewel is not returned soon it may be too late
which is why we called for you and your brilliant associates
i understand the enormous weight
that this must carry for you dr bravestone
how this adventure is like no other
since it was jurgen the brutal
who killed your parents
no no no
he killed dr bravestones parents
indeed he did when the doctor was just a boy
oh well thats terrible
i cant say this enough
were in a video game
you must recover the jewel
from jurgen the brutal and show it to the sun
hes making his way north across the desert now
jurgen the brutal is that barbaras boy
and remember the goal is to recover the loot
to wrest it from the hands of the brute
and if you wish to leave the game
you must save jumanji and call out its name
excuse me
who is jumanji
well if i was listening correctly that is her sister
heres your map
find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit
i cant land here so youre going to have to drop in
what
no no nigel
ill get as low as i can
hold on
get ready
what do you mean
we dont have parachutes shouldnt we have
what the hell
good luck
the future of jumanji is in your hands
why did we take a plane if theres nowhere to land
and go
the hell man
where are we
wheres the jungle
what are we doing here
weve got to keep it together okay
keep it together
yes
this is a whole new thing
nobody said wed have to do a whole new thing

we should see mount zhatmire pretty soon
you know gladys and i took a road trip before she passed
we went on a ceramics tour
through the southwest
i lost my restaurant so you could drive around
and look at ashtrays
yes ed
thats what you do when you retire
you explore your interests
i dont have interests
guys like me we dont retire
we work and then we keep working
and then eventually we die
but you retired me
you retired me
its a wonder i lasted as long as i did
what
youre a difficult man ed
you dont abandon your best friend milo
when i lost the restaurant i lost everything
you
yes yes i know he is
what are you talking to my camel
yes im talking to the camel
and he can tell
that youre a pain in the ass
my camels taking your side

they said that we can head down this path here
and make a right
then were in his territory
and they dont wanna go there
because they dont want to die
we dont wanna die either
the worst bravestone of all time
