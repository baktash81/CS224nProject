and they are awfully fast 
faster than a horse  if you can believe that

crazy dangerous 
but martha and i  we ve been here before

dr bravestone  famed archaeologist
and international explorer 
i m so glad you ve returned 
i ve been so anxious for your arrival 
 you talking to me 
 yes 
once again  jumanji is in great peril and only you can help 
nigel  we re looking for our friend 
have you seen  like  anyone   
ruby roundhouse  killer of men  welcome to jumanji 
  killer of men  
 yeah  i   i kill guys 
i m so glad you ve returned 
i ve been so anxious for your arrival 
 what s with this fella 
 my dearest mouse  surely you remember me 
nigel billingsly at your service 
hey  nigel  i thought that was you 
he s a   what is it called 
 npc  a non player character 
 he s not a real person 
he only has  like  a limited number of things he can say 
my friend carl is just like that 
nigel  we re looking for someone 
 has anyone else arrived here in jumanji   
 jumanji is in great peril 
it s all detailed in the letter i sent you  dr bravestone 
perhaps you should read it aloud 
grandpa eddie 
do you have a letter 
 do i have a letter 
 check your pockets 
 why would i have a letter 
 because nigel wrote you a letter 
i didn t get a letter from this guy 
 but we are in a video game  and  
 we re in a video game 
we re gonna die 
 we did die 
 are we in hell 
 i knew it 
 oh  my god 
it s all detailed in the letter i sent you  dr bravestone 
 perhaps you should read it aloud 
 i don t have a letter 
 how many times i gotta tell you that 
 oh  no  eddie  it s in your hand 
where did this come from 
you got to pay attention to what s in your hand 
perhaps you should read it aloud 
 dr bravestone 
it is my solemn hope that this letter finds you  for again    
jumanji is in grave danger  we need your help at once 
 what s going on here 
 it s a cutscene 
it s how we find out the   i ll explain afterwards 
you see  our worst nightmare has come to pass 
for jurgen the brutal has returned 
indeed  that most vicious jumanjian conqueror is back 
and he s brought with him his savage horde 
they descended from their fortress atop mount zhatmire
and made their way south to the avian province 
home of the sacred falcon jewel 
worn around the neck of the village elder 
the falcon is the fertility jewel of jumanji 
and it has been guarded by the people
of the avian province for hundreds of years 
so long as the jewel can see the sun 
the waters will flow and the land will flourish 
yeah 
many brave souls died that day 
but jurgen got what he came for 
he stowed the jewel in darkness 
hidden from the sun 
a drought befell the land 
the crops dried out and died 
and if the jewel is not returned soon  it may be too late 
which is why we called for you and your brilliant associates 
i understand the enormous weight
that this must carry for you  dr bravestone 
how this adventure is like no other 
since it was jurgen the brutal
who killed your parents 
no  no  no 
he killed dr bravestone s parents 
indeed  he did  when the doctor was just a boy 
oh  well  that s terrible 
i can t say this enough 
we re in a video game 
you must recover the jewel
from jurgen the brutal and show it to the sun 
he s making his way north across the desert now 
jurgen the brutal  is that barbara s boy 
and remember  the goal is to recover the loot 
to wrest it from the hands of the brute 
and if you wish to leave the game 
you must save jumanji and call out its name 
excuse me 
who is jumanji 
well  if i was listening correctly  that is her sister 
here s your map 
find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit 
 i can t land here  so you re going to have to drop in 
 what 
 no  no  nigel  
 i ll get as low as i can 
 hold on 
 get ready 
 what do you mean 
 we don t have parachutes  shouldn t we have   
 what the hell  
 good luck 
the future of jumanji is in your hands 
 why did we take a plane if there s nowhere to land 
 and go 
the hell  man  
where are we 
where s the jungle 
 what are we doing here  
 we ve got to keep it together  okay 
  keep it together  
 yes 
this is a whole new thing 
nobody said we d have to do a whole new thing 
and by the way  what the hell happened to bethany 
so  what part of new hampshire is this exactly 
we re not in new hampshire  milo 
that s right  exactly  not new hampshire 
you re starting to get it now 
nope  i don t have the foggiest clue what s going on here 
that guy kept calling me dr braverman 
which is the name of my orthopaedist 
what i m thinking is  i just had another hip surgery
and now i m coming out of it 
hey 
check this out 
okay 
we have to find spencer 
in order to do that  i think we have to start playing the game 
i m sure that s what he did 
we find him  we finish the game and we go home 
ed  you okay

funny thing is  i don t remember knowing

i was a zoologist last time  it s an important job 
maybe if we could get through this a little quicker 
well  another thing is 
they can run up to 45 miles per hour

 the brothers kababik 
the brothers bababik

it s not the moment for it 
 forget it 
 i just did it  i don t know what it was 
look like your stomach is upset 
like you ate something bad 
oh  man 
i m sweating 
stealing makes me very uncomfortable 
which is not ideal for a burglar 
so the fruit is in the tree 
but you can t get to it without going
through the water or whatever that is 
get boiled or eaten by piranhas or something 
 follow the flame  
i think that s how we get there 
but i don t know how i m supposed to make that jump

we should see mount zhatmire pretty soon 
you know  gladys and i took a road trip before she passed 
we went on a ceramics tour
through the southwest 
i lost my restaurant so you could drive around
and look at ashtrays 
yes  ed 
that s what you do when you retire 
you explore your interests 
i don t have interests 
guys like me  we don t retire 
we work  and then we keep working 
and then  eventually  we die 
but you retired me 
you retired me 
 it s a wonder i lasted as long as i did 
 what 
 you re a difficult man  ed 
 you don t abandon your best friend  milo 
when i lost the restaurant  i lost everything 
you   
yes  yes  i know he is 
 what  are you talking to my camel 
 yes  i m talking to the camel 
and he can tell
that you re a pain in the ass 
my camel s taking your side 
and he s not your camel 
he s just giving you a ride 
well  how about the both of you go screw yourselves 
 what did you just say

the camels just stopped 
this is as far as they go 
to get to jurgen s fortress 
they said that we can head down this path here
and make a right 
then we re in his territory 
and they don t wanna go there
because they don t want to die 
we don t wanna die either 
the worst bravestone of all time 
so we have to get across    this 
okay  we can do this  we can do this 
we just have to take our time and make careful decisions 
what are you talking about  it s obvious 
we start on that bridge right there 
then jump to that one that heads to right at 30 degrees 
and then those two that look like two sides of a trapezoid   
geometry 
that s what it s for 
maybe this character s not totally worthless 
 i ll go first
