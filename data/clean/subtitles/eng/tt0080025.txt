john 
but my friends all call me jack

with your pieces on free love  h  g 
free love sells newspapers 
gentleman  the fleet street casanova 
here  here 
i ve got my little experiments
to pay for 
you re the hero of the working class 
free love is all they can afford 
oh  lord 
don t start him on socialism 
we ll have to listen
to a sermon on it

i don t believe in organized religion 
socialism is the path man must tread
on the way to a utopian society 
we ve heard all that  wha s this
great announcement we re here for 
  a cure for gravity 
  i want to wait until we re all here

  good evening  john 
  herbert 
  good evening 
  hello

thank you  no  perhaps a little brandy
to take away the chill 
i m sorry i missed supper  but
a physician s hours are not his own 
  gentlemen 
  good health 
cheers 
what has herbert left for me tonight 
chess must wait 
you re just in time for the surprise 
isn t he  h  g 
the great big whatever it is 
  am i 
  i was waiting for you 
  i am all attention 
  very well 
gentlemen  i have called you here
tonight to bid you farewell 
  farewell 
  where are you going 
  another holiday in scotland 
  no  no  i am traveling   
   but i m not leaving london 
i don t expect to leave my laboratory 
  riddles again 
  gentlemen 
i am talking about traveling
through time 
in a machine constructed
for that very purpose 
what 
  poppycock 
  why 
electric light  courtesy of edison 
a modern prometheus 
good heavens  you were really serious 
i don t believe it  you ve actually
built the bloody thing 
  free love paid for most of it 
  i ve no doubt 
i didn t think practical jokes
was in your line 
twelve years ago  an engineer used
the sun to power a printing press 
my time machine
uses the same power source 
  you can t be serious 
  this thing is propelled by sunshine 
this cup catches
the rays of the sun   
   converting its heat
to electricity here 
electricity does the rest  juxtaposing
fields of energy creating friction 
the result is an ever increasing
series of reactions   
   that literally rotates the machine
out of one time sphere into another 
cruising speed is two years per
minute  go into the past or future 
two years per minute 
acceleration keeps the machine and
occupant outside all time spheres   
   conscious  but vaporized 
  how do you determine direction 
west  you gain yesterdays 
east  you accumulate tomorrows 
balderdash 
go north  you get to glasgow 
the machine is designed
with several safety features 
the reversal rotation lock returns
the machine to its starting date   
   after the completion of a voyage 
if the occupant is injured
during a flight   
   the passenger is returned
to the point of departure 
unless he uses this key
to countermand the device 
without that key 
i s a bloody homing pigeon 
and what  may i ask  is this 
well  john   
   this is the vaporizing equalizer 
without it  the passenger journeys
without the machine   
   and without the machine 
there is no coming back 
well  h g   which is it to be 
the past or the future 
the past  surely 
he ll want to meet cleopatra 
  the future 
  why the future 
i belong there  in three generations 
social utopia will have come to pass 
there ll be no war  crime or poverty 
and no disease either  john 
men will live like brothers 
and in equality with women 
  oh  dear  le s have the past 
  here  here 
i can t agree with you  check 
you astonish me  in the midst of all
your theorizing  you ignore the facts 
we live in a cosmic charnel house 
mankind has not changed in 2000 years 
we hunt  we re hunted  tha s
how it is  how it will always be 
the future will prove you wrong 
the future will tell 
anyway  i have just one question
for myself  when do you leave 
  i m not sure 
  human frailty  at last 
well  to be quite candid   
   i haven t worked up the nerve 
  first time for that 
but i will  all i have to do is set
the date and activate the switches 
and i ll inherit the hope diamond 
  checkmate 
  how does he do it 
  not again 
  every time 
i know how he thinks  tha s all 
  one day i shall win 
  when you learn how i think 
sorry to interrupt  two gentlemen from
scotland yard want a word with you 
what is the meaning of this 
beg pardon  sir 
might we have a word with you 
  the ripper  in this vicinity 
  i m afraid so  sir 
we ve cordoned off the neighborhood 
we re asking for cooperation 
will that be all right  your
housekeeper will sleep better 
  by all means 
  thank you  sir 
wha s happened 
apparently  the ripper
has struck again 
  with your permission  sir 
  please 
  he s not been heard from in years 
  nor in this area

he must have gone out the front 
as we came in 
it doesn t matter  we know who he is 
which is more than before tonight 
we ll round him up  if you come with
me  i ll see that you get home safe 
  there s bound to be an explanation 
  beyond belief 
thank you  dear  tha s my umbrella 
i ve never been so frightened  all the
times i ve put that bag in the closet 
  i wonder he didn t take it with him 
  we d never have known 
  he was always such a gentleman 
  yes  a gentleman 
i wonder where he got to so fast 
the coppers searched high and low 
we were by the door the whole time 
if he fooled them this long 
no surprise he s done it again 
  what did you say 
  we were by the door the whole time 
when you learn how i think 
1979 
what have i done 
i ve turned that bloody maniac
loose upon utopia 
  mr  wells   
  bring me all the housekeeping money 
and any money you have of your own 
i ll make it up to you 
  how much

   in a library  doing research
and never reads the newspaper 
i used to write for a newspaper 
the pall mall gazette 
really  shows how much i know 
you re a reporter 
i wrote articles on whatever struck
my fancy  social issues  mainly

to invite you to lunch like this

exhibit  leave it   
   or face the consequences 
have you got that 
yes  i believe you have 
herbert  you gotta bring the police

that man is crazy 
i could see it in his face 
and he threatened you 
something about leaving
the key to the exhibit 
le s tell the police  if you don t 
i will  but i don t know what to say 
you can t fool around
with a person like that 
 robbins  2340 francisco  
his name is john leslie stevenson 
english  he s a surgeon 
approximately 37 years of age 
flaxen hair  clean shaven   
   and stands well above
6 feet in height 
what makes you say that this 
dr  stevenson   
   is responsible for the death
of the girls 
i just know for a fact he is 
  i see  do you have spiritual powers 
  do i what 
are you a medium or a mystic 
i make no claim to supernatural
gifts of any sort 
if i could reveal the source
of my information  i   
as a matter of fact 
i m also a detective 
i was sent from london on the trail
of stevenson  traveling incognito

   of john leslie stevenson coming
here  british customs has no record   
   of a man by that name leaving 
there s no mention of a mr  holmes

   but since we don t know where he
is  we can t question him 
  can we 
  no
