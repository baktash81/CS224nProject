revert  revert 
just like her mother   so strong 
she should remain
innocent and pure forever 
i can t hold her for long 
i need her mother s help 
no  my elixir  is
too strong for you 
shoo  go away 
my crab shields were weakening 
i nearly upset
nature s balance 
i must stay calm 
when i think
of meeting her again   
this batch should be ready 
no leaks down here 
this door is loose 
i ll fix it later 
if even one creature
got in here   
superb 
i feel the ocean s power
in my very dna 
when this well is full 
the era of the ocean will begin 
an explosion of life
to match the cambrian era 
this revolting era
of man will be over 
better fix this door 
teeth
