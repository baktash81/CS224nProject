the wily old beast
shot out right in front of me
my horse reared
before i could aim off i fell
father
shall we roast the boar here
he was old
his hide is tough it stinks
indigestible
like me old hidetora
would you eat me
youd stick in our throats
thats why i joined the hunt
to reinforce our friendship
i too
i would cement the bonds between
the houses of lchimonji and ayabe
by marrying my daughter
to your son saburo
hold on
thats my own intention
lord lchimonji
the day is propitious
give us your answer
whom will you have for saburo
my daughter or lord ayabes
not an easy choice
two daughters
for one son
a pity jiro my second son
already has a wife
kyoami
entertain us
from the far mountain
from the near mountain
who comes hippetyhopping
showing off his handsome ears
a hare
only one hare kyoami
two i think
hopping here
to be eaten by father
saburo thats rude
hold your tongue
the great lord is tired
let us withdraw until he awakes
this is unlike father
he only pretends to sleep
after saburos insult
how else could he save face
all he did was hunt
in the old days
hed rout an army
and not be winded
its impolite to our guests
kyoami wake him
father worries me
hes barely snoring today
father what is it
are you ill
father
a dream
i had a dream
i was in a strange land
a vast wilderness
i went on and on
but met no one
i called i shouted
but no one answered
i was alone
alone in the wide world
i felt a chill
such stupidity
taros voice pulled me back
i saw my beloved children
taro
jiro
and saburo
father
ive never seen you like this
its not right
quiet saburo
be thankful
we have his affection
im puzzled too
i can scarcely believe my ears
normally all he asks
is our obedience
thats affection enough
all right
ive been considering an idea
and ive reached a decision
i want to tell it to you
now is a good time to do it
while lords fujimaki and ayabe
are with us
bring them
i hidetora lchimonji
was born in that small castle
in the mountains
at that time this entire plain
seethed with constant battle
many lords vied for power
at the age of seventeen
i flew my banner
over that castle
i waged war for 50 years
and at last the plain was mine
i hoisted my colours
over the main castle
i spent more years
fighting lance to lance
with these two gentlemen
now the moment has come
to stable the steeds of war
and give free rein to peace
but old hidetora
is seventy years old
i hereby cede total authority
over all my dominions
to my eldest son t aro
my lord this is so sudden
not at all
ive thought long and hard
there comes a time
to step aside
and pass on the reins
to younger hands
i say to you that time is now
this is my will
taro is now head of the lchimonji
lord of these lands
i will quit the castle keep
and move to the outer tower
i will retain a 30man escort
and the title and insignia
of great lord
but the actual leadership
lies entirely with t aro
i expect all of you to obey
ill obey
but what about me and saburo
what do you intend for us
i give you jiro and saburo
the second and third castles
with their attendant lands
you will support taro
in the first castle
i shall be your guest
visiting each castle in turn
iiving out my remaining years
how hard to be old
i would speak
i respect your wishes
and appreciate your trust
but i beg you to reconsider
why
though i am your eldest
i could never take your place
it is too great a task
i always pray to the god of war
let his life last 1 00 years
even if it means
shaving a bit off mine
what a pretty speech
i cannot use such honeyed words
id be embarrassed
dont be spiteful
you mean that taro
only flatters me
pay no attention to saburo
i feel the same as taro
wed like nothing better
than to stay behind your shield
but its our turn to shield you
from lifes bitter arrows
well said jiro
bring me that quiver
break an arrow in two
can you do it
bundle them
and try again
a single arrow is easily broken
not so three together
whenever taro is in trouble
if you unite your forces
the house of lchimonji will be safe
even in a sheaf
three arrows can be broken
more of your pranks
stop being foolish
its you who are foolish
your plan is absurd
you are either senile or mad
silence
do not insult your father
what madness have i spoken
wherein lies my senility
ill tell you
what kind of world do we live in
one barren of loyalty and feeling
im aware of that
so you should be
you spilled merciless blood
you showed no mercy no pity
we too are children of this age
weaned on strife and chaos
we are your sons
yet you count on our fidelity
in my eyes that makes you a fool
a senile old fool
so thats it
you mean that one day
youll forget im your father
and betray me
more folly
does a traitor betray himself
then you mean your brothers
hes jealous of taros position
is that why you slander me
brother or not watch your step
your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted
the unity of the three sons
is split
the indignity
you scorn your fathers wishes
parents and children
have no place in this world
very well
i cut the bond between us
you are a stranger to me
out of my sight
you mustnt
quiet tango
my mistake
was to love him too well
i spoiled him
its my fault hes arrogant
but its too late for regrets
when flesh is rotten
even our own cut it away
wait my lord
master saburo is blunt
perhaps even disrespectful
but his words are honest
and come from the heart
consider well you will find
he is not wrong
silence
i will speak
begone
i will stay
you disobey me
my duty is to speak my mind
brandish your sword
i wont move
how dare you
revoke this rash decision
your insolence matches his
i will not have it
i banish you both
father
what misery
what will you do now
i grieve for father not myself
the horror ahead of him
tango youre an idiot
why
for defending me
your place is with father
he needs you
theyre following us
wait
why do you run away
soninlaw
soninlaw
hear me out
youre in disgrace
exiled from your lands
lord ayabe and l
witnessed the whole incident
you are an outcast
little more than a beggar
forgive my rudeness
what im trying to say
i cant find the words
the meaning is clear
no lord chooses a beggar
for his daughter
of course not
no now hold on
lord ayabe rejected the marriage
but on my way home
i got to thinking
of your extraordinary conduct
i like the way you spoke up
you have character
youd make a fine soninlaw
i retraced my steps
but you had gone
does my offer interest you
how can i know
then come stay with me
while you think it over
you too t ango
you are honest and loyal
i can use you
will you come
thank you for your generosity
but i cannot accept
whatever disguise i must adopt
i shant abandon the great lord
whats going on
hidetoras concubines
are moving from the keep
please excuse the delay
scandalous
i am now the mistress
they must make way for me
my women
kneeling to taros wife
intolerable
why do you say that
you gave him the castle keep
its only natural
gives away his house
gives away his land
his bounty earns him
a new title
lord of the rice fields
a scarecrow
you call me a fool
no the fool is me
for serving as butt
to your laughingstock
but youre another
for losing your keep
how dare you
kaede
the view is more pleasant
now that this is mine
as i recall
a banner used to hang there
yes fathers banner
also his helmet and armour
where are they
i gave them to fathers men
the armour doesnt matter
but the banner
lord
it belongs with the head
of the house of lchimonji
but father is keeping
his title and insignia
without them you are a shadow
what do you mean
he made it clear
i am now in command
in that case
behave as if you are
you want the banner
ridiculous
you take back what you give
it is lord taros order
see the lord a gourd in the wind
swinging this way
swaying that way
swinging as the breeze blows
so high up
dangling hollow from the tower
isnt it fun
villain ill teach you
see the lord a gourd in the wind
swinging this way
swaying that way
swinging as the breeze blows
so high up
dangling hollow from the tower
what fun what fun
who goes there
its ogura
i have a message
lord t aro is holding
a family gathering
to celebrate the transfer of power
he invites his honoured father
you too lord lkoma
your family gathering
is only us
please fatherinlaw
wont you sit down
i am to sit below you
who am l
the honourable father
of my husband
is that all
is the great lord dead
dont joke
im not joking
i retain my title and my status
have you forgotten
no of course not
you gave full authority to me
did you forget
what do you want
i gave you this castle
i moved out reduced my escort
they may be few in number
but theyre boisterous enough
what is that song
with such goingson
how can i make myself obeyed
they are warriors
unschooled in manners
they like comic songs
comic songs can go too far
that song makes fun of me
my guard was defending my honour
yet you went ahead and killed him
i cannot allow that
this once ill overlook it
but i must have your promise
that it wont happen again
you will sign this
and seal it with your blood
a pledge
this is nonsense
read it
pledge
firstly
l cede to taro takatora
the domains of lchimonji
secondly
l make him sole ruler
of the house of lchimonji
thirdly
though i am taros father
l shall submit to his authority
and act accordingly
l swear by all the deities
may they punish me if i disobey
im to seal this silly thing
with my blood
everything it contains
was proclaimed by you yourself
before witnesses
what does it change
if you sign it
are you a son
what do you mean
is this a sons attitude
the hen pecks the cock
and makes him crow
i will not stay here
fortunately i have another son
thank you you did well
i was born
and raised in this castle
it belonged to my father
i left it to marry you
my father and brothers relaxed
their vigilance after the marriage
and hidetora murdered them
now i am back in my family castle
how i have longed for this day
my mother took her own life
in this very room
father is on his way
my brother sent him packing
he says father grows eccentric
and it would be unwise
to let him stay here
fathers counsellor lkoma
is privy to my brothers plans
this severity is unlike lord t aro
and you lord
why do you do nothing
hes right
you should succeed the great lord
lord taro is a weakling
the stake is large
gamble for it
then you are all willing
to gamble with me
absolutely
dogs turn on a master
who gives up the chase
sound the horn
or become the quarry
how the dogs howl
i must say i find it unfair
born twelve months after taro
so all my life
i must grovel at his feet
crack these bonds
good for you my lord
dont lick your chops yet
listen
taro is easy pickings
his wife lady kaede
is another story
quite true
shed be a perfect match for you
why not steal her
dont be impertinent
first of all theres father
he still has thirty warriors
each one is worth a thousand
hell soon be here
and so will they
any ideas
open the gates
hidetora is here
the great lord is here
i will seek out sue first
tell jiro i want to see him
sue
praise be
to the eternal western paradise
praise be
to the eternal buddha
in 36 trillion manifestations
praise be to amida buddha
i knew youd be here
fatherinlaw
never m ind the ceremony
its been a long time
let me look at you
still the same sad face
when i see you it breaks my heart
its worse when you smile
i burnt down your castle
your father and mother perished
and you look at me like that
look upon me with hatred
it would be easier to bear
go on hate me
i dont hate you
all is decided
in our previous lives
the buddha embraces all things
buddha again
he is gone from this evil world
his guardians are in exile
we cant rely on buddhas mercy
there you are jiro
ive come to be your guest
im disappointed in taro
i already know
its all in my brothers letter
taro wrote to you
he says your guards
were unruly and vulgar
i am to receive you with courtesy
but i cannot let your warriors
inside the castle walls
whats this
im to come in alone
leaving my men to rot outside
my brother is the head of the clan
i have no choice but to obey him
if you dislike his conditions
then it might be best
to go back and apologise
apologise to taro
go back
stop
lord kurogane
lord shirane
what does this mean
lord lkoma
an order from hidetora
we arrived suddenly
the castle is unprepared
withdraw and wait outside
enough is enough
i understand
you too
youre just like taro
you want to be rid of me
im too much trouble
thats not true
if you were alone
id welcome you gladly
the great lord
goes nowhere alone
you renounced your power
you have no need of an escort
only the birds and the beasts
iive in solitude
ive heard enough excuses
open the gates
you neednt worry
its not for my men to enter
but for me to leave
open the gates
now close them
i will not see you again
ever
the villages are deserted
not a grain of rice anywhere
the peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains
my lord
we must go to the third castle
it was your first victory
go back
no lkoma
if i could do that
would i roam the plain hungry
use your head
what kind of welcome would i get
i who banished
the lord of the castle
by order of lord taro takatora
head of the lchimonji clan
i take possession
of this castle
open the gates
without our master saburo
the castle is nothing to us
we leave it to you
we will follow him
and die for him
we hear he is with lord fujimaki
we go to join him
its tango
i have rice bean curd plums
i followed you
and saw how you suffered
though banished
i am still your loyal vassal
is it really tango
hold on
dont take charity from peasants
a samurai will starve
rather than beg
the peasants are presumptuous
burn their villages
wait my lord
dont blame the peasants
rather than disobey taros decree
they fled
what decree
that you are banished
anyone who helps you
will die
now i understand
you tried to warn me of this
your humble servant
laugh tango
wretched hidetora
rejected by his children
driven from his castles
with no place to go
you have a place to go my lord
master saburo has found refuge
with lord fujimaki
go to him
no i cant
how could l
ever face him
listen to me
all saburo wants is your welfare
if im disguised like this
if i followed you so far
its all thanks to him
he sent me to protect you
saburos men gave up the castle
they went to join lord fujimaki
now fujimakis plot is clear
first he takes saburo
then saburos warriors
then your lordship himself
the lchimonji battle each other
and he walks off with your land
thats a lie
hes not that kind of man
we must go to the third castle
but taros general has taken it
ogura he wont touch us
whats that
what do i smell
a very fishy stink
ogura has only a few men
we can beat them easily
my horse
thats it hurry
hell is ever at hand
which you cannot say of heaven
stay behind if youre afraid
and yet
all we did was tell the truth
the enemy
i know call lkoma and ogura
they tricked us
were surrounded overwhelmed
truly
we are in hell
lord taro is slain
what
so be it
a stray shot from the tower
the fortunes of war
the fates are kinder to you
and father
hell commit harakiri
were lost
prepare yourself
farewell my lord
go back
lord
the die is cast do not falter
you chose this path follow it
it leads to absolute leadership
you can no longer turn back
is he mad
and better off for it
what do you mean
my lord come to your wits
in a mad world
only the mad are sane
what do you see
forgive me
excellent the failed mind
sees the hearts failings
the wonder of it
i see on this withered plain
all those i destroyed
a phantom army
one by one they come floating
rising before me
whos there
t ravellers stranded by the storm
let us stay the night
my house is too poor for visitors
we ask nothing special
im sorry i must be alone
why are you diseased
no
then let us come in
i cannot
the one who seeks shelter
is the great lord himself
were coming in
our lord was taken ill
he is wet through
bring something to cover him
im cold
tango
he is himself again
mores the pity
he is better off mad
tango
iisten to me
i hidetora
was attacked by my own sons
i was betrayed by my vassal
thats not the worst
because of me my loyal men
died a useless death
as fate would have it
only i survived
i who should have died
you there woman
i am not a woman
its so dark bring a light
i have no light
i have no need of one
are your eyes so poor
are you lady sues brother
young lord tsurumaru
yes
tsurumaru
its been a long time
lord hidetora
you remember me
how could i forget you
i was only a boy
but could i forget the man
who burned down our castle
who in exchange for my life
gouged out my eyes
i try to be like my sister
to pray to buddha
and rid myself of hatred
but not one day do i forget
not one night do i sleep in peace
i regret i cannot welcome you
as befits the great lord
luckily my sister gave me a flute
i will play for you
lacking anything else i give you
hospitality of the heart
it is the only pleasure
ieft to me
sisterinlaw
here is my brothers hair
he died in battle
unfortunately it falls on me
to bring this unhappy news
ogura
where is my husbands body
in this heat
it was too unsightly
to be displayed
we burned it where it lay
we held funeral rites at a temple
ogura
where are his armour and helmet
youre mocking me
im wearing them
surely you recognise them
of course
but i didnt dream
you would wear them
so soon after his death
you surprise me
i had thought
my brother would be pleased
to see me in his armour
it was stupid of me
forgive me
help me take it off
sisterinlaw
i am about to be naked
lords lkoma and ogura
you have worked well
to further our interests
we appreciate it
these gifts are a token of thanks
theyre also a parting gift
farewell
lord jiro feels it unwise
to keep you in his service
men who betray one master
may betray another
a reasonable point of view
naturally you are disappointed
but bear no grudges
is that clear
good
the lady kaede is here
send her in
my apologies for my harsh words
i am ashamed
the incident is forgotten
they say your father has gone mad
that should please you
what do you mean by that
i spoke frankly
without gilding my thoughts
forgive me if i offended
you must hate my father
for what he did to your family
am i wrong
now its my turn to be frank
you are just as pleased as i am
lord jiro you are now head
of the house of lchimonji
this helmet is rightfully yours
i am not blind
you murdered your brother
and stole his title
prepare to die
no
even now
you deny it
it wasnt i who killed my brother
then who did
speak who was it
it was
kurogane
hypocrite
you gave the order
but wont take the blame
a fine leader
you give in so easily
now i will tell you the truth
lord jiro
i dont care about taros death
what concerns me
is my own future
i wont be a widow
with my hair cropped
nor a nun with my head shaved
this castle was my fathers
i wont leave it
lord jiro
consider my request well
for my part ill say nothing
of your abominable crimes
i wont reproach you
or speak against you
if i did
the kingdom would split
but always remember
i can destroy you
is it a bargain lord jiro
my lord
yes sisterinlaw
sisterinlaw
after what weve just done
by rights
i really should be
your wife
i have a wife sue
ill be merely your concubine
no no
youre mine
no one else shall have you
dont cry kaede
you wont be just a concubine
as long as lady sue is there
ill attend to her
but how
ill repudiate her
thats not what i want
after our ecstasy
i cannot bear it that another woman
has known your touch
such a woman cannot remain alive
well now look where we are
if fortune had run true
tsurumaru would live here
you shelter in the very ruins
of the castle you burned
ignorance is bliss indeed
your helmet
your plumes
dont you look regal
help here come demons
two of them
traitors you must pay
no wait
let us explain
save your breath
i know all about your treachery
die traitor
jiro killed taro
madness saved hidetora
if he recovers his wits
hell be killed too
jiro slew taro our lord is next
we must take him to master saburo
if only we could
mention saburo and he runs away
he doesnt dare face him
on that point hes sane
what about master saburo
would you like to see him
the only way
is to bring saburo here
maybe he can talk sense to him
ill be back as soon as i can
take good care of him
lady kaede leads you by the nose
if you wish to marry fine
but to kill lady sue for that
sometimes killing is necessary
but to kill on a whim
the order is unreasonable
i must refuse
lord kurogane
at the second castle
there is a supply of salt
why
when you bring back her head
salt it first
otherwise in this heat
well be unable to look at it
lady sue is so beautiful
it would be ungracious to her
since you will go personally
there will be no mistake
do it as you see fit
why stay with this mad old man
if the rock you sit on
starts to roll jump clear
or youll go with it
and be squashed
only a fool stays aboard
where am l
what is this place
paradise
think of it
all my life
ive been his nurse
good boy
sweet dreams
i kurogane am back
approach
thank you for being quick
at your service my lady
i have brought the object
as per your instructions
be so kind as to examine it
ill be the first to look
what is this
your joking goes too far
is anything wrong
imagine that
lady sue was a fox in disguise
enough of your tricks
this is a statue from a shrine
clever fox
first becomes human
then turns himself to stone
are you making a fool of me
certainly not
there are many foxes hereabouts
its said they take human form
take care my lord
they often impersonate women
in central asia
a fox seduced king pan tsu
and made him kill 1000 men
in china he married king yu
and ravaged the land
in japan as princess tamamo
he caused great havoc at court
he became a white fox
with nine tails
then they lost trace of him
some people say
he settled down here
so beware my lord beware
this is how you keep our bargain
you conspire with kurogane
to humiliate me
no youre wrong
intolerable
its kuroganes doing
always kurogane
is he your only vassal
hes the villain who killed taro
hes the hero who saved sue
a twoheaded monster
this is your right arm
until the day
i have sues head
you shall not see me again
sister my flute
weve no time to get it
ive had it since boyhood
what shall we do
kurogane said theyll pursue you
ill go back for the flute
your legs are old
im the one to go
were near the ruins
of your castle
go there and pray for your dead
you may never be back again
tsurumaru lets hurry
i see our castle
that is whats left of it
which way sister
over there
where
earth and sky are topsyturvy
i was the fool and made him laugh
now the coin is flipped
dont be mute say something
you speak nonsense
ill speak truth
well see what comes of it
begin old man
a serpents egg
is white and pure
a birds is speckled and soiled
this is a castle
heres a wall
the bird left the speckled egg
for the white
strange
the egg cracks
out comes a snake
empty space above the wall
why
the bird is gobbled by the snake
where am l
who am l
stupid bird
saburo
it hurts
im aworm dont crush me
whod bother to crush a worm
who are you
is someone crying
whos crying
hell
man is born crying
when hes cried enough he dies
saburo has crossed the river
hes now in hachiman field
what can he do with so few men
message from lord saburo
speak
he is here to find his father
that done he will leave in peace
fujimaki is at the border
i dont like it
i didnt want reinforcements
you should be glad
thanks to fujimaki
the enemy is pinned down here
we can rescue your father
from azusa plain
but it looks so aggressive
one false move could mean war
maybe i was too hasty
my worry spurred me on
but my soninlaw will grumble
sitting here we pose no threat
prepare for battle
my lord this is illadvised
let saburo have his father
avoid this war
once he has father
hell accuse me of treason
and attack
we cant give up hidetora
we dont know where he is
there is much unrest in the land
fujimaki and ayabe bide their time
we need to retrench not attack
a message
lady kaede awaits lord jiro
to celebrate
his departure for battle
a warlord
doesnt run to his woman
stay away
when the enemy is assembled
we can go after his lordship
be patient
rest the horses
dismount
weakling
kurogane has swayed you again
no
its no time for war
wars are won by strong leaders
why fear fujimaki and ayabe
your mistake
was to spare hidetora mad or not
to kill him i have to find him
saburo knows where he is
otherwise he wouldnt have come
send him a message
say he can have his father
watch his movements
and send out your assassins
im lost
such is the human condition
this path
i remember
we came this way before
men always travel the same road
if youre tired of it jump
up there
who is it
sue
sister that voice
this ruin was once a castle
it belonged to sues father
i destroyed it
why am i here
why is sue here
and tsurumaru too
is this a dream
no this is hell
hell
the lowest level of hell
mount
message from lord jiro
very good
he says he wont attack
were to leave once we have father
lets go at once
wed give away his wheareabouts
wait till dark
ayabe is on the move
vulture
he smells blood
stay calm my lord
ayabe is watching
so is fujimaki
theyre waiting
dont give them an excuse to attack
he wants father but makes no move
whats his game
shes taking so long
ill go see whats keeping her
no dont
never mind the flute
youre acting like a child
i dont want to be alone again
you wont be alone
this image of the buddha amida
will protect you in my place
sister
i wont be gone long
sister
i found kyoami
crying on azusa plain
wheres our master
forgive me
hes disappeared
you lost him
on the plain
now we cant wait for dark
im going to azusa plain
keep the enemy busy here
ten men follow lord saburo
hes moving
hes heading for azusa plain
gunnery captain
take your men to azusa plain
and lay an ambush
a reward for whoever kills saburo
are you mad
break your word and its war
so be it
it was inevitable
saburo is not our only enemy
so what
if they attack we retaliate
we grab their land
and enlarge our own
fine words
but words dont win wars
wheres the dog eager for prey
kaedes right
youre a mouse
posing as a mastiff
kaede barks and you grovel
silence
stay behind
if you fear to fight desert
if i deserted
where would i go
captain
you have your orders go
message for lord saburo
enemy gunners coming
take care
infantry
forward
thinks hes smart
get ready men
were moving
into the woods
father
what a sky
am i in the other world
is this paradise
why are you so cruel
why pull me from my grave
dont you know me
father
yes
what do you mean by father
wait i remember
i had three sons
are you one of them
yes i am saburo
saburo
saburo its you
i have no face to show you
no words to excuse myself
give me poison to drink
ill swallow it gladly
dont talk like that
i dont hate you father
no sweet lies ive had my fill
does he look like a hypocrite
true soft words often deceive
but my lord look at him
tears like this
can only come from the heart
youll live with us
and forget this bad dream
if only you can forget
my cruelty to you
forgive me
i am a stupid old fool
attack
the enemy is in the woods
our superior strength
is useless there
then well burn them out
charge
attack
pull back
we outnumber them
crush them
ayabe is marching
on the first castle
impossible
hes on the ridge
those troops are a decoy
pull back
forward
thats enough
another cheer
i have so much to say
when were alone and quiet
we will talk father to son
thats all i want
nothing else
he is dead
i know when one is dead
he is dead
you and i live
but saburo
you cant die
i have tales to tell
forgiveness to ask
my son
is this justice
are you gone forever
keep away
it grows dark
senile old fool
its the end
do not call back his spirit
he has suffered enough
lord saburo
victory is ours
the enemy is retreating
with ayabe in pursuit
weve won
alas
it doesnt seem possible
he isnt here to share this
hidetora is also gone
why
are there no gods no buddha
if you exist hear me
you are mischievous and cruel
are you so bored up there
you must crush us like ants
is it such fun to see men weep
enough do not blaspheme
it is the gods who weep
they see us killing each other
over and over since time began
they cant save us from ourselves
dont cry
its how the world is made
men prefer sorrow over joy
suffering over peace
look at them in the first castle
they revel in pain and bloodshed
they celebrate murder
well stay you go to the tower
stop close the gates
wheres lord jiro
whose head is that
saburos or hidetoras
neither
my lord ordered me to
wait kurogane
is lady kaede the master here
i serve you but never her
foxdevil
your scheming has destroyed
the house of lchimonji
such is the vanity of woman
vanity you say
i wanted to avenge my family
