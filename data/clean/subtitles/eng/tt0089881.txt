the wily old beast
shot out right in front of me 
my horse reared 
before i could aim  off i fell 
father  
shall we roast the boar here  
he was old 
his hide is tough  it stinks 
indigestible 
like me  old hidetora   
would you eat me  
you d stick in our throats 
that s why i joined the hunt 
to reinforce our friendship 
i  too 
i would cement the bonds between
the houses of lchimonji and ayabe
by marrying my daughter
to your son saburo 
hold on 
that s my own intention 
lord lchimonji 
the day is propitious 
give us your answer 
whom will you have for saburo 
my daughter or lord ayabe s  
not an easy choice 
two daughters
for one son 
a pity jiro  my second son 
already has a wife 
kyoami 
entertain us 
from the far mountain
from the near mountain
who comes hippety hopping
showing off his handsome ears  
a hare  
only one hare  kyoami  
two  i think 
hopping here
to be eaten by father 
saburo  that s rude 
hold your tongue 
the great lord is tired 
let us withdraw until he awakes 
this is unlike father 
he only pretends to sleep 
after saburo s insult 
how else could he save face  
all he did was hunt 
in the old days
he d rout an army
and not be winded 
it s impolite to our guests 
kyoami  wake him 
father worries me 
he s barely snoring today 
father  what is it  
are you ill  
father   
a dream 
i had a dream 
i was in a strange land 
a vast wilderness 
i went on and on 
but met no one 
i called  i shouted 
but no one answered 
i was alone 
alone in the wide world 
i felt a chill   
such stupidity 
taro s voice pulled me back 
i saw my beloved children 
taro   
jiro   
and saburo 
father 
i ve never seen you like this 
it s not right 
quiet  saburo 
be thankful
we have his affection 
i m puzzled  too 
i can scarcely believe my ears 
normally all he asks
is our obedience 
that s affection enough 
all right 
i ve been considering an idea
and i ve reached a decision 
i want to tell it to you 
now is a good time to do it 
while lords fujimaki and ayabe
are with us 
bring them 
i  hidetora lchimonji 
was born in that small castle
in the mountains 
at that time  this entire plain
seethed with constant battle 
many lords vied for power 
at the age of seventeen 
i flew my banner
over that castle 
i waged war for 50 years
and at last the plain was mine 
i hoisted my colours
over the main castle 
i spent more years
fighting lance to lance
with these two gentlemen 
now the moment has come
to stable the steeds of war
and give free rein to peace 
but old hidetora
is seventy years old 
i hereby cede total authority
over all my dominions
to my eldest son t aro 
my lord  this is so sudden 
not at all 
i ve thought long and hard 
there comes a time
to step aside
and pass on the reins
to younger hands 
i say to you  that time is now 
this is my will 
taro is now head of the lchimonji 
lord of these lands 
i will quit the castle keep
and move to the outer tower 
i will retain a 30 man escort
and the title and insignia
of great lord 
but the actual leadership
lies entirely with t aro 
i expect all of you to obey 
i ll obey 
but what about me and saburo  
what do you intend for us  
i give you  jiro and saburo 
the second and third castles
with their attendant lands 
you will support taro
in the first castle 
i shall be your guest 
visiting each castle in turn 
iiving out my remaining years 
how hard    to be old 
i would speak 
i respect your wishes
and appreciate your trust
but i beg you to reconsider 
why  
though i am your eldest 
i could never take your place 
it is too great a task 
i always pray to the god of war 
 let his life last 1 00 years 
 even if it means
shaving a bit off mine  
what a pretty speech 
i cannot use such honeyed words 
i d be embarrassed 
don t be spiteful 
you mean that taro
only flatters me  
pay no attention to saburo 
i feel the same as taro 
we d like nothing better
than to stay behind your shield 
but it s our turn to shield you
from life s bitter arrows 
well said  jiro 
bring me that quiver 
break an arrow in two 
can you do it  
bundle them   
and try again 
a single arrow is easily broken 
not so three together 
whenever taro is in trouble
if you unite your forces
the house of lchimonji will be safe 
even in a sheaf 
three arrows can be broken 
more of your pranks 
stop being foolish 
it s you who are foolish 
your plan is absurd 
you are either senile or mad 
silence 
do not insult your father 
what madness have i spoken  
wherein lies my senility  
i ll tell you 
what kind of world do we live in  
one barren of loyalty and feeling 
  i m aware of that 
  so you should be 
you spilled merciless blood 
you showed no mercy  no pity 
we too are children of this age 
weaned on strife and chaos 
we are your sons 
yet you count on our fidelity  
in my eyes  that makes you a fool 
a senile old fool 
so that s it 
you mean that one day
you ll forget i m your father
and betray me  
more folly 
does a traitor betray himself  
then you mean your brothers  
he s jealous of taro s position 
is that why you slander me  
brother or not  watch your step 
your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted 
the unity of the three sons
is split 
the indignity 
you scorn your father s wishes  
parents and children
have no place in this world 
very well 
i cut the bond between us 
you are a stranger to me 
out of my sight 
you mustn t 
quiet  tango 
my mistake
was to love him too well 
i spoiled him 
it s my fault he s arrogant 
but it s too late for regrets 
when flesh is rotten 
even our own  cut it away 
wait  my lord 
master saburo is blunt 
perhaps even disrespectful 
but his words are honest
and come from the heart 
consider well  you will find
he is not wrong 
  silence 
i will speak 
begone 
i will stay 
you disobey me  
my duty is to speak my mind 
brandish your sword 
  i won t move 
  how dare you 
revoke this rash decision 
your insolence matches his 
i will not have it 
i banish you both 
father 
what misery 
what will you do now  
i grieve for father  not myself 
the horror ahead of him   
tango  you re an idiot 
  why  
  for defending me 
your place is with father 
he needs you 
they re following us 
wait 
why do you run away 
son in law  
  son in law  
  hear me out 
you re in disgrace 
exiled from your lands 
lord ayabe and l
witnessed the whole incident 
you are an outcast 
little more than a beggar 
forgive my rudeness 
what i m trying to say   
i can t find the words 
the meaning is clear 
no lord chooses a beggar   
for his daughter 
of course not 
no    now hold on 
lord ayabe rejected the marriage 
but on my way home
i got to thinking
of your extraordinary conduct 
i like the way you spoke up 
you have character 
you d make a fine son in law 
i retraced my steps
but you had gone 
does my offer interest you  
how can i know  
then come stay with me
while you think it over 
you too  t ango 
you are honest and loyal 
i can use you 
will you come  
thank you for your generosity 
but i cannot accept 
whatever disguise i must adopt 
i shan t abandon the great lord 
what s going on  
hidetora s concubines
are moving from the keep 
please excuse the delay 
scandalous 
i am now the mistress 
they must make way for me 
my women 
kneeling to taro s wife  
intolerable 
why do you say that  
you gave him the castle keep 
it s only natural 
gives away his house 
gives away his land
his bounty earns him
a new title
lord of the rice fields
a scarecrow  
you call me a fool  
no  the fool is me 
for serving as butt
to your laughing stock 
but you re another
for losing your keep 
how dare you 
kaede   
the view is more pleasant
now that this is mine 
as i recall 
a banner used to hang there 
yes  father s banner 
also his helmet and armour 
where are they  
i gave them to father s men 
the armour doesn t matter
but the banner   
lord 
it belongs with the head
of the house of lchimonji 
but father is keeping
his title and insignia 
without them  you are a shadow 
what do you mean  
he made it clear 
i am now in command 
in that case 
behave as if you are 
you want the banner  
ridiculous 
you take back what you give 
it is lord taro s order 
see the lord  a gourd in the wind
swinging this way
swaying that way
swinging as the breeze blows
so high up
dangling hollow from the tower   
isn t it fun  
villain  i ll teach you 
see the lord  a gourd in the wind
swinging this way
swaying that way
swinging as the breeze blows
so high up
dangling hollow from the tower   
what fun  what fun 
who goes there  
it s ogura 
i have a message 
lord t aro is holding
a family gathering
to celebrate the transfer of power 
he invites his honoured father 
you too  lord lkoma 
your  family gathering 
is only us  
please  father in law 
won t you sit down  
i am to sit below you  
who am l  
the honourable father
of my husband 
is that all  
is the great lord dead  
don t joke 
i m not joking 
i retain my title and my status 
have you forgotten  
no  of course not 
you gave full authority to me 
did you forget  
what do you want  
i gave you this castle 
i moved out  reduced my escort 
they may be few in number 
but they re boisterous enough 
what is that song  
with such goings on 
how can i make myself obeyed  
they are warriors 
unschooled in manners 
they like comic songs 
comic songs can go too far 
that song makes fun of me 
my guard was defending my honour 
yet you went ahead and killed him 
i cannot allow that 
this once i ll overlook it 
but i must have your promise
that it won t happen again 
you will sign this
and seal it with your blood 
a pledge  
this is nonsense 
read it 
 pledge 
 firstly 
 l cede to taro takatora
the domains of lchimonji 
 secondly 
 l make him sole ruler
of the house of lchimonji 
 thirdly 
 though i am taro s father 
 l shall submit to his authority
 and act accordingly 
 l swear by all the deities 
 may they punish me if i disobey  
i m to seal this silly thing
with my blood  
everything it contains
was proclaimed by you yourself
before witnesses 
what does it change
if you sign it  
are you a son  
what do you mean  
is this a son s attitude  
the hen pecks the cock
and makes him crow 
i will not stay here 
fortunately  i have another son 
thank you  you did well 
i was born
and raised in this castle 
it belonged to my father 
i left it to marry you 
my father and brothers relaxed
their vigilance after the marriage 
and hidetora murdered them 
now i am back in my family castle 
how i have longed for this day 
my mother took her own life
in this very room 
father is on his way 
my brother sent him packing 
he says father grows eccentric 
and it would be unwise
to let him stay here 
father s counsellor  lkoma 
is privy to my brother s plans 
this severity is unlike lord t aro 
and you  lord 
why do you do nothing  
he s right 
you should succeed the great lord 
lord taro is a weakling 
the stake is large 
gamble for it 
then you are all willing
to gamble with me  
absolutely 
dogs turn on a master
who gives up the chase 
sound the horn
or become the quarry 
how the dogs howl 
i must say  i find it unfair 
born twelve months after taro 
so all my life
i must grovel at his feet 
crack these bonds 
good for you  my lord 
don t lick your chops yet 
listen   
taro is easy pickings 
his wife  lady kaede 
is another story 
quite true 
she d be a perfect match for you 
why not steal her  
don t be impertinent 
first of all  there s father 
he still has thirty warriors 
each one is worth a thousand 
he ll soon be here
and so will they 
any ideas  
open the gates 
hidetora is here 
the great lord is here 
i will seek out sue first 
tell jiro i want to see him 
sue 
praise be
to the eternal western paradise
praise be
to the eternal buddha
in 36 trillion manifestations
praise be to amida buddha   
i knew you d be here 
father in law 
never m ind the ceremony 
it s been a long time 
let me look at you 
still the same sad face 
when i see you  it breaks my heart 
it s worse when you smile 
i burnt down your castle 
your father and mother perished 
and you look at me like that 
look upon me with hatred 
it would be easier to bear 
go on  hate me 
i don t hate you 
all is decided
in our previous lives 
the buddha embraces all things 
buddha again 
he is gone from this evil world 
his guardians are in exile 
we can t rely on buddha s mercy 
there you are  jiro 
i ve come to be your guest 
i m disappointed in taro 
i already know 
it s all in my brother s letter 
taro wrote to you  
he says your guards
were unruly and vulgar 
i am to receive you with courtesy 
but i cannot let your warriors
inside the castle walls 
what s this  
i m to come in alone 
leaving my men to rot outside  
my brother is the head of the clan 
i have no choice but to obey him 
if you dislike his conditions 
then it might be best
to go back and apologise 
apologise to taro  
go back  
stop 
lord kurogane 
lord shirane 
what does this mean  
lord lkoma 
an order from hidetora 
 we arrived suddenly 
 the castle is unprepared 
 withdraw and wait outside  
enough is enough 
i understand 
you too 
you re just like taro 
you want to be rid of me 
i m too much trouble 
that s not true 
if you were alone 
i d welcome you gladly 
the great lord
goes nowhere alone 
you renounced your power 
you have no need of an escort 
only the birds and the beasts
iive in solitude 
i ve heard enough excuses 
open the gates 
you needn t worry 
it s not for my men to enter 
but for me to leave 
open the gates 
now close them 
i will not see you again 
ever 
the villages are deserted 
not a grain of rice anywhere 
the peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains 
my lord 
we must go to the third castle 
it was your first victory 
  go back   
  no  lkoma 
if i could do that 
would i roam the plain hungry  
use your head 
what kind of welcome would i get 
i  who banished
the lord of the castle  
by order of lord taro takatora 
head of the lchimonji clan 
i take possession
of this castle 
open the gates 
without our master  saburo 
the castle is nothing to us 
we leave it to you 
we will follow him
and die for him 
we hear he is with lord fujimaki 
we go to join him 
it s tango 
i have rice  bean curd  plums   
i followed you
and saw how you suffered 
though banished 
i am still your loyal vassal 
is it really tango  
hold on 
don t take charity from peasants 
a samurai will starve
rather than beg 
the peasants are presumptuous 
burn their villages 
wait  my lord 
don t blame the peasants 
rather than disobey taro s decree 
they fled 
what decree  
that you are banished 
anyone who helps you   
will die 
now i understand 
you tried to warn me of this 
your humble servant 
laugh  tango 
wretched hidetora   
rejected by his children 
driven from his castles 
with no place to go 
you have a place to go  my lord 
master saburo has found refuge
with lord fujimaki 
go to him 
no  i can t 
how could l
ever face him  
listen to me 
all saburo wants is your welfare 
if i m disguised like this 
if i followed you so far 
it s all thanks to him 
he sent me to protect you 
saburo s men gave up the castle 
they went to join lord fujimaki 
now fujimaki s plot is clear 
first he takes saburo 
then saburo s warriors 
then your lordship himself 
the lchimonji battle each other 
and he walks off with your land 
that s a lie 
he s not that kind of man 
we must go to the third castle 
but taro s general has taken it 
ogura   he won t touch us 
what s that  
what do i smell  
a very fishy stink 
ogura has only a few men 
we can beat them easily 
my horse 
that s it  hurry 
hell is ever at hand 
which you cannot say of heaven   
stay behind if you re afraid 
and yet 
all we did was tell the truth 
the enemy   
i know  call lkoma and ogura 
they tricked us 
we re surrounded  overwhelmed 
truly   
we are in hell 
lord taro is slain 
  what  
  so be it 
a stray shot from the tower 
the fortunes of war 
the fates are kinder to you 
and father  
he ll commit hara kiri 
  we re lost 
  prepare yourself 
farewell  my lord 
go back 
lord 
the die is cast  do not falter 
you chose this path  follow it 
it leads to absolute leadership 
you can no longer turn back 
is he mad  
and better off for it 
what do you mean  
my lord  come to your wits 
in a mad world
only the mad are sane 
what do you see  
forgive me 
excellent  the failed mind
sees the heart s failings 
the wonder of it 
i see on this withered plain
all those i destroyed
a phantom army
one by one they come floating
rising before me   
who s there  
t ravellers stranded by the storm 
let us stay the night 
my house is too poor for visitors 
we ask nothing special 
i m sorry  i must be alone 
why   are you diseased  
no 
then let us come in 
i cannot 
the one who seeks shelter
is the great lord himself 
we re coming in 
our lord was taken ill 
he is wet through 
bring something to cover him 
i m cold 
tango   
he is himself again 
more s the pity 
he is better off mad 
tango 
iisten to me 
i  hidetora 
was attacked by my own sons 
i was betrayed by my vassal 
that s not the worst 
because of me  my loyal men
died a useless death 
as fate would have it
only i survived 
i  who should have died 
you there  woman 
i am not a woman 
it s so dark    bring a light 
i have no light 
i have no need of one 
are your eyes so poor  
are you lady sue s brother  
young lord tsurumaru  
yes 
tsurumaru 
it s been a long time   
lord hidetora 
you remember me  
how could i forget you  
i was only a boy 
but could i forget the man
who burned down our castle  
who in exchange for my life
gouged out my eyes  
i try to be like my sister 
to pray to buddha
and rid myself of hatred 
but not one day do i forget 
not one night do i sleep in peace 
i regret i cannot welcome you
as befits the great lord 
luckily  my sister gave me a flute 
i will play for you 
lacking anything else  i give you
hospitality of the heart 
it is the only pleasure
ieft to me 
sister in law 
here is my brother s hair 
he died in battle 
unfortunately  it falls on me
to bring this unhappy news 
ogura 
where is my husband s body  
in this heat 
it was too unsightly
to be displayed 
we burned it where it lay 
we held funeral rites at a temple 
ogura   
where are his armour and helmet  
you re mocking me 
i m wearing them 
surely you recognise them 
of course 
but i didn t dream
you would wear them
so soon after his death 
you surprise me 
i had thought
my brother would be pleased
to see me in his armour 
it was stupid of me 
forgive me 
help me take it off 
sister in law 
i am about to be naked 
lords lkoma and ogura 
you have worked well
to further our interests 
we appreciate it 
these gifts are a token of thanks 
they re also a parting gift 
farewell 
lord jiro feels it unwise
to keep you in his service 
men who betray one master
may betray another 
a reasonable point of view 
naturally you are disappointed 
but bear no grudges 
is that clear  
good 
the lady kaede is here 
send her in 
my apologies for my harsh words 
i am ashamed 
the incident is forgotten 
they say your father has gone mad 
that should please you 
what do you mean by that  
i spoke frankly 
without gilding my thoughts 
forgive me if i offended 
you must hate my father
for what he did to your family 
am i wrong  
now it s my turn to be frank 
you are just as pleased as i am 
lord jiro  you are now head
of the house of lchimonji 
this helmet is rightfully yours 
i am not blind 
you murdered your brother
and stole his title 
prepare to die 
no 
even now
you deny it  
it wasn t i who killed my brother 
then who did  
speak  who was it  
it was   
kurogane 
hypocrite 
you gave the order
but won t take the blame 
a fine leader 
you give in so easily 
now i will tell you the truth 
lord jiro 
i don t care about taro s death 
what concerns me
is my own future 
i won t be a widow 
with my hair cropped 
nor a nun  with my head shaved 
this castle was my father s 
i won t leave it 
lord jiro 
consider my request well 
for my part  i ll say nothing
of your abominable crimes 
i won t reproach you
or speak against you 
if i did 
the kingdom would split 
but always remember 
i can destroy you 
is it a bargain  lord jiro  
my lord   
yes  sister in law  
sister in law  
after what we ve just done  
by rights 
i really should be
your wife 
i have a wife  sue 
i ll be merely your concubine  
no  no 
you re mine 
no one else shall have you 
don t cry  kaede 
you won t be just a concubine 
as long as lady sue is there   
i ll attend to her 
but how  
i ll repudiate her 
that s not what i want 
after our ecstasy 
i cannot bear it that another woman
has known your touch 
such a woman cannot remain alive 
well now  look where we are 
if fortune had run true 
tsurumaru would live here 
you shelter in the very ruins
of the castle you burned 
ignorance is bliss indeed 
your helmet 
your plumes 
don t you look regal 
help  here come demons 
two of them 
traitors  you must pay 
no  wait 
let us explain 
save your breath 
i know all about your treachery 
die  traitor 
jiro killed taro 
madness saved hidetora 
if he recovers his wits 
he ll be killed too 
jiro slew taro  our lord is next 
we must take him to master saburo 
if only we could 
mention saburo and he runs away 
he doesn t dare face him 
on that point he s sane 
what about master saburo  
would you like to see him  
the only way
is to bring saburo here 
maybe he can talk sense to him 
i ll be back as soon as i can 
take good care of him 
lady kaede leads you by the nose 
if you wish to marry  fine 
but to kill lady sue for that  
sometimes killing is necessary 
but to kill on a whim  
the order is unreasonable 
i must refuse 
lord kurogane 
at the second castle
there is a supply of salt 
why  
when you bring back her head 
salt it first 
otherwise  in this heat 
we ll be unable to look at it 
lady sue is so beautiful 
it would be ungracious to her 
since you will go personally 
there will be no mistake 
do it as you see fit 
why stay with this mad old man  
if the rock you sit on
starts to roll  jump clear 
or you ll go with it
and be squashed 
only a fool stays aboard 
where am l  
what is this place  
paradise 
think of it 
all my life 
i ve been his nurse 
good boy 
sweet dreams 
i  kurogane  am back 
approach 
thank you for being quick 
at your service  my lady 
i have brought the object 
as per your instructions 
be so kind as to examine it 
i ll be the first to look 
what is this  
your joking goes too far 
is anything wrong  
imagine that 
lady sue was a fox in disguise 
enough of your tricks 
this is a statue from a shrine 
clever fox   
first becomes human
then turns himself to stone 
are you making a fool of me  
certainly not 
there are many foxes hereabouts 
it s said they take human form 
take care  my lord 
they often impersonate women 
in central asia
a fox seduced king pan tsu 
and made him kill 1 000 men 
in china he married king yu
and ravaged the land 
in japan  as princess tamamo 
he caused great havoc at court 
he became a white fox
with nine tails 
then they lost trace of him 
some people say
he settled down here 
so beware  my lord  beware 
this is how you keep our bargain 
you conspire with kurogane
to humiliate me 
no  you re wrong 
intolerable 
it s kurogane s doing 
always kurogane 
is he your only vassal  
he s the villain who killed taro 
he s the hero who saved sue 
a two headed monster 
this is your  right arm   
until the day
i have sue s head 
you shall not see me again 
  sister  my flute 
  we ve no time to get it 
i ve had it since boyhood 
what shall we do  
kurogane said they ll pursue you 
i ll go back for the flute 
your legs are old 
i m the one to go 
we re near the ruins
of your castle 
go there and pray for your dead 
you may never be back again 
tsurumaru  let s hurry 
i see our castle 
that is  what s left of it 
which way  sister  
over there 
where  
earth and sky are topsy turvy 
i was the fool and made him laugh 
now the coin is flipped 
don t be mute  say something 
you speak nonsense 
i ll speak truth 
we ll see what comes of it 
begin  old man 
a serpent s egg
is white and pure 
a bird s is speckled and soiled 
this is a castle   
here s a wall 
the bird left the speckled egg
for the white 
strange   
the egg cracks 
out comes a snake 
empty space above the wall 
why  
the bird is gobbled by the snake 
where am l  
who am l  
stupid bird 
saburo   
it hurts 
i m aworm  don t crush me 
who d bother to crush a worm  
who are you  
is someone crying  
who s crying  
hell 
man is born crying 
when he s cried enough  he dies 
saburo has crossed the river 
he s now in hachiman field 
what can he do with so few men  
message from lord saburo 
speak 
he is here to find his father 
that done  he will leave in peace 
fujimaki is at the border 
i don t like it 
i didn t want reinforcements 
you should be glad 
thanks to fujimaki 
the enemy is pinned down here 
we can rescue your father
from azusa plain 
but it looks so aggressive 
one false move could mean war 
maybe i was too hasty 
my worry spurred me on
but my son in law will grumble 
sitting here  we pose no threat 
prepare for battle 
my lord  this is ill advised 
let saburo have his father 
avoid this war 
once he has father 
he ll accuse me of treason
and attack 
we can t give up hidetora 
we don t know where he is 
there is much unrest in the land 
fujimaki and ayabe bide their time 
we need to retrench  not attack 
a message 
lady kaede awaits lord jiro 
to celebrate
his departure for battle 
a warlord
doesn t run to his woman 
stay away 
when the enemy is assembled
we can go after his lordship 
be patient 
rest the horses 
dismount 
weakling 
kurogane has swayed you again 
no 
it s no time for war 
wars are won by strong leaders 
why fear fujimaki and ayabe  
your mistake
was to spare hidetora  mad or not 
to kill him i have to find him 
saburo knows where he is 
otherwise he wouldn t have come 
send him a message 
say he can have his father 
watch his movements
and send out your assassins 
i m lost 
such is the human condition 
this path   
i remember   
we came this way before 
men always travel the same road 
if you re tired of it  jump 
up there 
who is it  
sue 
sister  that voice   
this ruin was once a castle 
it belonged to sue s father 
i destroyed it 
why am i here  
why is sue here  
and tsurumaru too  
is this a dream  
no  this is hell 
hell 
the lowest level of hell 
mount 
message from lord jiro 
very good 
he says he won t attack 
we re to leave once we have father 
let s go at once 
we d give away his wheareabouts 
wait till dark 
ayabe is on the move 
vulture 
he smells blood 
stay calm  my lord 
ayabe is watching 
so is fujimaki 
they re waiting 
don t give them an excuse to attack 
he wants father but makes no move 
what s his game  
she s taking so long 
i ll go see what s keeping her 
no  don t 
never mind the flute 
you re acting like a child 
i don t want to be alone again 
you won t be alone 
this image of the buddha amida
will protect you in my place 
sister 
i won t be gone long 
sister 
i found kyoami 
crying on azusa plain 
where s our master  
forgive me 
he s disappeared 
you lost him
on the plain  
now we can t wait for dark 
i m going to azusa plain 
keep the enemy busy here 
ten men follow lord saburo 
he s moving   
he s heading for azusa plain 
gunnery captain 
take your men to azusa plain
and lay an ambush 
a reward for whoever kills saburo 
are you mad  
break your word and it s war 
so be it 
it was inevitable 
saburo is not our only enemy 
so what  
if they attack  we retaliate 
we grab their land
and enlarge our own 
fine words 
but words don t win wars 
where s the dog eager for prey  
kaede s right 
you re a mouse
posing as a mastiff 
kaede barks and you grovel 
silence 
stay behind 
if you fear to fight  desert 
if i deserted 
where would i go  
captain 
you have your orders  go 
message for lord saburo 
 enemy gunners coming 
 take care  
infantry 
forward 
thinks he s smart 
get ready  men 
we re moving
into the woods 
father 
what a sky 
am i in the other world  
is this paradise  
why are you so cruel  
why pull me from my grave  
don t you know me  
  father  
  yes 
what do you mean by  father   
wait    i remember 
i had three sons 
are you one of them  
yes  i am saburo 
saburo  
saburo  it s you 
i have no face to show you 
no words to excuse myself 
give me poison to drink 
i ll swallow it gladly 
don t talk like that 
i don t hate you  father 
no sweet lies  i ve had my fill 
does he look like a hypocrite  
true  soft words often deceive 
but  my lord  look at him 
tears like this
can only come from the heart 
you ll live with us 
and forget this bad dream 
if only you can forget
my cruelty to you 
forgive me 
i am a stupid old fool 
attack 
the enemy is in the woods 
our superior strength
is useless there 
then we ll burn them out 
charge 
attack 
pull back 
we outnumber them 
crush them 
ayabe is marching
on the first castle 
impossible 
he s on the ridge 
those troops are a decoy 
pull back 
forward 
that s enough 
another cheer 
i have so much to say 
when we re alone and quiet 
we will talk  father to son 
that s all i want 
nothing else 
he is dead 
i know when one is dead 
he is dead 
you and i live 
but saburo   
you can t die 
i have tales to tell 
forgiveness to ask 
my son   
is this justice  
are you gone forever  
keep away 
it grows dark 
senile old fool 
it s the end 
do not call back his spirit 
he has suffered enough 
lord saburo 
victory is ours 
the enemy is retreating
with ayabe in pursuit 
we ve won 
alas 
it doesn t seem possible 
he isn t here to share this 
hidetora is also gone 
why  
are there no gods   no buddha  
if you exist  hear me 
you are mischievous and cruel 
are you so bored up there
you must crush us like ants  
is it such fun to see men weep  
enough  do not blaspheme 
it is the gods who weep 
they see us killing each other 
over and over since time began 
they can t save us from ourselves 
don t cry 
it s how the world is made 
men prefer sorrow over joy 
suffering over peace 
look at them in the first castle 
they revel in pain and bloodshed 
they celebrate murder 
we ll stay  you go to the tower 
stop  close the gates 
where s lord jiro  
whose head is that  
saburo s or hidetora s  
neither 
my lord ordered me to   
wait  kurogane 
is lady kaede the master here  
i serve you  but never her 
fox devil 
your scheming has destroyed
the house of lchimonji 
such is the vanity of woman 
vanity  you say  
i wanted to avenge my family
