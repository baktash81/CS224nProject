two oclock
almost two oclock
am or pm
youre not serious
not entirely
its afternoon
i know
what time is your flight
740 to amsterdam
i havent seen you for two weeks
and youre leaving
again this evening
i know ill be gone for
just a few days
god youre a sexy woman
what are you doing
im not doing anything
theyre going to take me
out of here on a gurney
tell me something sexy
i want you to put
your hand up my dress
but youre not
wearing a dress
what does that
have to do with it
its something you
like for me to say
i know but it has to
be real doesnt it
why dont you just tell me what it
is that you want me to do to you
i want you to touch me
you want me to
touch you where
i want you to touch
me down there
you do
i really do
say it more sexy
i want you to touch me
are you wet
yes
you really are
yes
god youre sopping
i know
how did you get yourself
into such a state
from thinking
about you
from thinking about me what
from thinking about your
sweet face between my legs
wait wait wait
i think i should go tidy up
i dont want you to
slow slow slow
how do you know
how to do that
from hanging out
with really nasty girls
youve ruined me
you know that
i hope so
god you have the most luscious
pussy in all of christendom
did you know that
tell me what to do
you know what to do
tell me
what if i shock you
too bad
i want you to
fingerfuck me
what
you heard me
i cant believe you said that
believe it
youre reached a whole new level
of depravity havent you
i thought it didnt mean
that much to girls
depends on the girl
i want you to stick
your finger up me
and find my spot
and push on it
oh my god
god you are luscious
oh my god
illegals
welcome to the united states
do you like it because it
reminds you of somewhere else
thats not why i like it
i like it for itself
it doesnt have
to be like something else
no
do i remind you
of someone else
yes you do
someone you miss
someone who is dead
i dont think i miss things
i think to miss something is to
hope that it will come back
but its not coming back
ive always known that
since i was a girl
you dont think
thats a bit cold
i think truth
has no temperature
mmm
there it goes
follow me please
good morning
i want her to have something that
she wont be
uncomfortable wearing
i dont want to give her
a diamond so big
shed be afraid to wear it
she is probably more
courageous than you imagine
is this a pillow
no its an asscher
look at the corners
lets put it in
the grading box
the pillow has a slight arc
to the sides
it is a modern version
of the oldmine cut
lets look at the color
put it tableside down
so youre looking
through the pavilion
yes theres more
to look through
it appears to be yellow
its nitrogen that
gives it the yellow
the colors start with d
a dstone has no color
so what am i looking at
h
is that still a good color
thats a very good color
the truth is that
anything you can say
about the diamond is
in the nature of a flaw
a perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light
do you see the inclusion
no
it is small what we
would call a feather
yes
i think i see it
so it is graded what
a vs1
some might grade it higher
you might grade it higher
you like this stone
oh
i like that stone
how many carats is it
its expensive
tell me what you see
remember
youre not looking for merit
this is a cynical business
we seek only imperfection
this is a 5carat stone
tell me what you see
the culet seems big
crown and pavilion dont fit
the girdle comes out crooked
very good
but there is no
perfect diamond
en este mundo nada es perfecto
as my father would say
youre sephardic
yes
do you know spain
i do
and spain me
at one time i thought she
would return from the grave
but that is not to be
every country that has driven out the
jews has suffered the same fate
which is
you dont want to hear
we should talk stones
the most valued stone
is the red diamond
from the argyle mines
so very rare
ive seen two in a long life
a prize almost beyond belief
i do want to hear
well i have to say
theres no culture save for
the semitic culture there
the last known culture
before that was the greek
and there will be no
culture after nothing
thats a bold claim
the heart of any culture is to be
found in the nature of the hero
who is that man
who is revered
in the classical world
it is the warrior
but in the western world
it is the man of god
from moses to christ
the prophet the penitent
such a figure was unknown to the
greeks unheard of unimaginable
because there is only a man
of god not a man of gods
and this god is
the god of the jewish people
there is no other god
we see him
what is the word
purloined
purloined in the west
how do you steal a god
the jew beholds
his tormentor dressed
in the vestments
of his own ancient culture
everything bears
a strange familiarity
the fit is always poor and the
hands are always dripping blood
that coat didnt that
belong to uncle haim
what about the shoes
enough i see your look
no more philosophy
the stones themselves
have their own view of things
perhaps they are not
so silent as you think
they were piped
up out of the earth
in a time before
any witness was
but here they are
let me show you
this is a cautionary stone
although i suppose
every diamond is cautionary
a cautionary diamond
of course why not
its not a small thing to wish
for however unattainable
to aspire to the stones
endless destiny
isnt that the meaning
of adornment
to enhance the beauty
of the beloved
is to acknowledge
both her frailty
and the nobility
of that frailty
we announce to the darkness
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives
that we will not
thereby be made less
you will see
afternoon sir
thank you
looking good counselor chris
how you doing
good
wheres reiner
hes in there
you dont have
to worry about it
yeah
but who paid for it
i put the credit card down
so obviously i paid for it
you paid for it
i dont care
but you like it
i do like it
ive never been to barbados are
all the ladies as sexy as you
its a steaming pit
of sexual abandon
i dont believe you
well it used to be
i left
come in
good morning counselor
good morning
malkina
hola guapo
hey
hows laura
incredible
that sounds about right
nice lady
nice lady
i assume that shes not privy to
your newest business venture
shes not
and your lady
uh
yeah
yeah what
i dont know what she knows
i dont want to know
you dont trust her
jesus counselor
shes a woman
i dont mean to
sound that cold
i just mean that where men are
concerned theyve got their own agenda
i always liked smart women but its
been an expensive hobby you know
yeah
do you know what all that stuff is
uh
mostly yeah
anything i dont know i can ask her
which worries me even more
hmm
you never told
me what happened
with you and
the lovely clarissa
ms clarissa of the
extraordinary body
she used to go
around with no bra
those firm nipples in
her blouse or tshirt
i think in the end
it was jealousy that undid us
jealousy
yeah she was getting
more pussy than i was
is that true
i think so
probably yeah
i have to say that for
a girl who liked girls
she took an extraordinary
interest in the male member
she sucked on it so hard it
finally corrected my vision
she left me for this
goodlooking black woman
whoo
had a boyfriend played for the oilers
nice chap nice chap
we met once for drinks
at this club in dallas
to discuss our mutual plight
he was taking it rather
poorly i have to say
women do better
dont they
maybe they have
more practice at it
yeah well my guess
is that in most cases
if you still have the woman
youre weeping over
youll be weeping harder
mmhmm
so is this place secure
who knows
i dont speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere
theres a scrambler on
the phone but still
theres a lot of
smart people out there
of course anybody who
thinks hes the smartest
is on his way
to the slam
would that be me
no no
although i have to
say that i always thought
a law degree was
a license to steal
and that you for one hadnt
really capitalized on it
youre not the straight dude
people think though are you
i guess not
i dont mean the caper i mean you
women like you
all right
do you know what
they like about you
im a good fuck
right
no they can sniff out
the moral dilemma
the paradox
moral dilemma
yeah theyre drawn to it
not sure why
maybe its just that lacking
any moral sense themselves
theyre fascinated
by it in men
men are attracted to flawed
women too of course
but their illusion
is that they can fix them
women dont want
to fix anything
they only want
to be entertained
the truth about
women is you can
do anything to them
except bore them
well
theres nothing about laura
that i would want to fix
maybe not
do you think she knows
things about me
that i dont
know about myself
jesus counselor im not even sure
what sort of question that is
yeah
okay
if you pursue this road
that youve embarked upon
you will eventually
come to moral decisions
that will take you
completely by surprise
you wont see
it coming at all
i dont intend
to take this up as a trade
yeah onetime deal right
which youve heard
a thousand times
no but a few
what usually happens is that
after a couple of deals
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street
and how does that
work out for them
not well
so that would
be a moral issue
not for me
or for your associates
yeah well
they have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure
do you know
what a bolito is
no
a bolo is one of those
skinny neckties
or one of those things
you throw in argentina
yeah right
no in this case
its a mechanical device
and it has this
small electric motor
with this rather
incredible compound gear
that retrieves
a steel cable
batterydriven
and the cable is made
out of some unholy alloy
almost impossible to cut it
and its in a loop
and you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away
no one ever even sees you
and pulling the cable
activates the motor
and the noose
starts to tighten
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero
it cuts the guys head off
yeah well it can
theres nothing he can do
no
jesus
yeah
how long does it take
oh
three four minutes
five maybe
it depends on
your collar size
youre shitting me
nonono
its just that
theres no easy way
to turn the thing off
or reason to
it just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then
it selfdestructs
actually youre probably dead
in less than a minute
from strangulation
no
the wire cuts through
the carotid arteries
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators
and everybody goes home
sweet
yeah sweet
think about it
counselor
so where does all this
beheading shit come from
you never used to see that
i think its blown
in here from the east
meaning the east
yeah
you put nine mexicans
and an arab in a room
and give them each 100
and come back in a few hours
who do you think is gonna
be holding the grand
so you gearing up to do business
with them down the road
the arabs
yeah
no no
whys that
because they dont
need your money
do you have a dog
do i have a dog
yes
no maam
oh
i dont have a dog
okay
these are for me
for you
yes maam
its a diet
a diet
see i probably shouldnt
even be telling you this
i mean ive tried
a couple of times
and i gotta say
it works pretty good
i mean
you dont really eat
when you get hungry you just
pop a couple of these bad boys
i carry a baggy full
around with me
last time
i lost 27 pounds in 30 days
id pretty much
recommend it to anybody
these diets you read about
i know this works
i mean but of course like anything
else you gotta use your head
time before
i woke up in the hospital
but you just gotta
keep your mind
on your business
like anything else
if you wanna lose weight
this is it
after a few days you dont
even want anything else
id absolutely
recommend it to anybody
but you said you
woke up in the hospital
what happened did you get a
systemic reaction or what
no maam it wasnt
anything like that
i was sitting in the street licking
my balls and a car hit me
take care now
you hear
what
yeah well too bad
here you go maam
thank you
enjoy your meal
thank you
i have something to
discuss with you
and im a bit scared
hmm
have you been bad
no
actually i dont have that
much to discuss so
let me just give you this
and tell me what you think
will you
dont leave me hanging here
yes i will
try it
what you didnt know
i knew
but i was scared anyway
thats good
its so beautiful
you are a glory
im a glory
yes
as in glorious
youre a glorious woman
and youre a man
of impeccable taste
sorry i shouldnt
have said that
you cant take it back
here
i intend to love you until i die
me first
not on your life
thats a nice ring
how many carats is it
i dont know
you dont know
no
youve gotta be kidding me
no i dont know
let me see it
no take it off
hmm
its a 35 carat
maybe 38
its a nice stone
its asscher cut
thank you
good color
probably an f or a g
nothing visible
so at least a vs2
wanna know how much
its worth
no
you really dont do you
i really dont
so have you set a date
not yet
i really want to get married in the church
and hes okay with that
he was married before so i
thought that would be a problem
but the church doesnt recognize
other marriages so
are you nervous
a little bit
sometimes i am
so youre a church lady
i go
its important to me
and what about confession
yeah
well maybe not so much
does the priest
ever ask you about sex
he doesnt ask but youre
supposed to tell him everything
and all the nasty shit you did
youre just supposed
to pretend like
youre never gonna
do it again right
i guess
strange
and suppose youve done
something really nasty
he doesnt press you
for the details
i dont think so
youre blushing
uhuh
okay we can change
the subject
well talk about my sex life
youre teasing
just rattling your cage
what a world
do you think
the world is strange
i meant yours
hello
reiner are you there
counselor
i think im in
you cant think counselor
youre in or youre out
all right im in
and thanks
dont thank me yet
i wont say i hope you know what
youre doing because you dont
but money problems
are serious problems
you keep telling yourself its
not as bad as it appears
and then one morning
you realize its worse
am i close
my back is against
the fucking wall man
i believe you
do you have the cash
ill have it thursday
all right
ill call westray
and set it up
counselor
westray
its not dark
enough in here for you
wow
thats a dandy
what happened
confrontation with a doorman
confrontation
jesus
what did you say to him
i think i told him that he was
not to take it personally
but he should go fuck himself
what did he say to that
he said im gonna hurt
you white person
what will you have
ill have a heineken
make it two
i didnt know you
got into donnybrooks
i dont
anyway it was
in another country
and besides
the wretch is dead
no but i sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him
bloody expensive too
you surprise me
counselor
im just a middle man
i know the smallest
crumb can devour us
you learn not to let anything pass
you cant afford to
i should keep that in mind
you might keep that in mind
so fire away
all right
what do you do with the money
what do i do
or what does one do
what do you do
mine goes offshore
we can talk about it if you like
but you cant use my people
all right
okay
let me make a call
all right
what else
you seem unsettled
im all right
uh
whats the buyout
for this whole deal
net net
yeah net net
its hard to put
a cold dollar on it
you dont know what your
expenses are up front
its 625 kilos goes for about
50 an ounce in colombia
and the street value in dallas
can go as high as two grand
is that where its going
dallas
no its going to chicago
dont write that down
were probably
looking at 20 million
maybe a little more
its 21900 ounces
good return on
your investment
did you do that in your head
no i remembered it
but i know someone who could
do that in their head
ill bet youre right
if youre not in
you need to tell me
im all right
its just not our people
you got the money guys
you gotta get money in dollars into
mexico and you gotta get it out
to do that
you need a corporation
you cant go
through the us banks
and even then you have to
have someone on the inside
youd be surprised
at the people
who are in this business
very surprised
you have a corporation
no of course not
you just pay the points
the other option
is cash of course
thats an even bigger headache
for all the obvious reasons
the biggest issue is not that your guy
is gonna fall for some pole dancer
and go south with a
million of your duckets
the biggest issue
is someone is gonna
figure out who he is
and what hes up to
here we go
no youre good
thank you
well cheers
a plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses
is that your normal toast
increasingly
so if the drug wars stop
this will dry up right
lets just say
it will be more than risky
thats the thing
reiner doesnt seem to get
you may have
noticed his lifestyle
has become
increasingly lavish
ive noticed
i dont set foot in his clubs
and i miss the bastard
we used to share
a taste for exotic women
in fact a few times
shared the women themselves
that wouldnt include the
present one would it
now
why would you ask me that
no reason sorry
the answer is no of course
the civil answer
butlsee a murky picture forming
in that mind of yours
how well do you
know malkina
not very well why
because you dont know someone
until you know what they want
is why
ill try and remember that
good
and reiner
reiner
reiner is beyond advising
reiner thinks
nothing bad can happen
and hes in love
you two are going
to open a new club
is that all right
sure why not
what the fuck
do you know how many people were
killed in juãrez last year
no a lot
yeah
i think 3000 is a lot
this is a different species
counselor
they will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog
jesus westray
let me ask you who do you think
killed all those young girls
before
the socalled drug wars
i dont know nobody knows
nobody knows
no
come on counselor
hundreds of girls
thousands most likely
follow the money
if you have so much cash that youre
insulating your house with it
and youve bought all the
clothes and the cars
and the guns you can
find a place to put
and youre morally depraved
beyond all human recognition
what then do you
do with your money
why do they kill them
who knows fun snuff films youll
see those will start turning up
anyway what do you
do with a 15yearold
you just ravaged in
some heinous manner
do you think the drug lords
hired kidnappers
to keep them supplied
with young girls
i think they have kidnappers
on full retainer
i should keep
that in mind too
i cant advise you counselor
but you are advising me
i just need you to be sure
that youre locked in
because i dont know
maybe i should tell you what mickey
rourke told whatshisface
thats my recommendation anyway
counselor dont do it
this arson is
a serious crime
yeah and so is this
i guess im a little
taken aback at the
cautionary nature
of this conversation
good word
cautionary
in scots law it defines
an instrument in which
one person stands as
surety for another
as surety
yes
sounds a bit primitive
it is
the problem being
of course
is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding
what about you
i can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money can you
truth is counselor i can walk
away from all of this in a second
and i mean all of it
youre not gonna believe this but
im going to tell you anyway
i think about my life
i can live in a monastery
scrub the steps clean the
pots try some gardening
youre serious
very
why dont you
in a word women
ive seen it all counselor
its all shit
its all shit
ill be in touch
hey counselor
you want to know why jesus
wasnt born in mexico
no why
couldnt find three wise men
or a virgin
and counselor heres
something else to consider
the beheadings and the mutilations
thats just business
you gotta keep up appearances
its not like theres some
smoldering rage at the bottom of it
lets see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill
i dont know
who
you counselor
you
hey
did you bring cigarettes
they treating you well
oh yeah
peachy

hearing on the 17th

206 miles an hour in what
on that jap bike of his
listen if you could get
his money back
he could pay the fine
and get out of there

how are you man
you see a place like this in the cold
light of day it looks pretty seedy
but you get the right lighting
in here
and some music
some goodlooking girls
and its a whole other world
jesus
were looking
for cash flow here
so how soon do you think
two weeks
three max
yeah
are you gonna
keep the dance floor
yeah a dance floor takes
up a lot of space
but you try and chat
up a girl at a bar
shes supposed to
tell you to fuck off
she doesnt want to
look like a bitch
but you ask a chick to dance
well you got a better shot
you know peterson right
sure
yeah do you know
he speaks portuguese
no
yeah his family was from brazil
so this cousin of
peterson shows up
and we are all out
here on saturday night
and the cousin is
asking peterson
how do you say
may i have this dance
only we get wind of it
and we shut peterson up and we are
coaching him on how to say it
repeat after me i want
to eat your pussy  right
and we work with him till
hes pretty much got it down
i want to eat your pussy
and we send him off
hes this kind of
elegantlooking guy anyway
so he goes off
across the room
and he picks out this really
really greatlooking girl
and he stands in front of her gives
her this little bow and says
i want to eat your pussy
and of course
the table gets pretty quiet
and the girl looks up at him
and says what did you say
and he says it again a little
bow i want to eat your pussy
and she stares at him
for a minute
and then looks
over to see past him
and of course hears these
three guys across the room
all hugging each other and just
weeping weeping with merriment
so she gets up and she takes
petersons cousin by the hand
and she takes him out
to this van in the parking lot
and proceeds to
fuck his brains out
hes gone for an hour we dont
know what the hell is going on
and finally
she leads him back in
and gives him
this big sexy kiss
and she looks over at us to
make sure were all watching
and sends him
back to the table
well were going nuts nuts
peterson is trying to get
the story out of him
and hes jabbering away
and were like whats he saying
whats he saying
its the whole thing its blowjob
its the works the works
jesus were just
fucking flabbergasted
and we are just sitting there
staring at each other
and after a while
peterson gets up
and looks at us
and off he goes
he crosses the floor
to where this
coollooking girl is
sitting by herself
and he gives her a little bow
and announces that he
wants to eat her pussy
well of course
well this time the husband is
coming out of the mens room
and hes about
i dont know 11 feet tall
this guy hit him so hard that
he came out of his loafers
he came out of his loafers
so peterson is lying dead on the
dance floor in his socked feet
anyway
they called an ambulance
and they hauled peterson
off to the hospital
and hes got a concussion
and a broken jaw
jesus
yeah
what did you guys do
nothing we left
we had enough fun
for one evening
anyway the other big
spaceeater is the bandstand

im going to say
you probably noticed it
but that aint
really the problem
the real problem is
his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes
for you to wind up
under the bus
do you know what im saying
anyhow thats how i see it
you take care now you hear
baby
who was that
its an old client
it goes with the territory
im sorry
hi
hi
oh um
bless me father
for i have sinned
and
how long has it been
since your last confession
well ive never been before
this is my first
are you catholic
no
then i cannot
give you absolution
i know
but i just wanted to tell
somebody what i had done
and i thought why not go to
a professional
have you thought about
taking instructions
thats not something
i do very well
i mean in order to
become a catholic
then you could confess
and you will be
forgiven for your sins
what if theyre unforgivable
nothing is unforgivable
oh yeah
well i havent killed anybody
but ive been pretty bad
look we have people here
waiting to go to confession
so im sorry
they can wait
i did
who did you talk to about this
why did i talk to somebody
you said
bless me father
well i asked a friend but she
didnt know i was gonna do it
so were done here then
i havent told you my sins yet
i dont want to hear your sins
there would be no point
were you baptized
i dont know
its possible
your parents never told you
i never knew my parents
they were thrown out of a helicopter
into the atlantic ocean
when i was three
listen
you dont have to do
the whole forgiveness thing
all you have to do is listen
to the sins
women tell you
about sexdont they
i cant talk about that
yeah but every woman who
goes to confess tells you
that shes an adulterer or
fornicator or something
or why else would
she be there
so you must have a very
unusual picture of women
you must think that theyre
just having sex all the time
you really need to go now
if you dont leave i leave
wait where are you going
i wasnt finished
i know
i just wanted to
hear your voice
i really miss you
i really miss you
i miss you so much
you know what else i miss
dont go there
are you sure
youre just glowing
with sexual health
is that bad
no
i love it
do you miss me
yes
bad badly
you havent been taking liberties
with your person have you
no
you couldnt touch it
with a powder puff
do you remember
the night we met
yes the airport parking lot
did you know i would
do it that night
did i know you would
do it with me
of course
why there
i dont know i thought it would
be exciting like in high school
i remember asking you
if you were all right
cause you were
gasping like an asthmatic
oh my goodness
is this phone sex
i wish you were here with me
i know
life is being in bed with you
everything else
is just waiting
i love you very much
i love you so much
good night
good night
i dont know
women have funny
ideas about sex
theyre supposed
to be so modest
let me tell you
when they get it
in their heads how
they want to fuck
theyre like a freight train
sign here
the things ive
learned about women
fuck
about half of it
i would like to forget
im not sure
if i follow you
what is it you would like
to forget for instance
you dont want to know
sure i do
i dont know lets talk
about something else
here
just pull up your socks
and tell me
yeah
i dont know
what is it you would
like to forget
all right
i would like to forget about
malkina fucking my car
what
see
what did you just say
i said i would like to forget
about malkina fucking my car
i think
what the hell are
you talking about
do you remember
that yellow california i had
sure nice car
very nice car
anyway this was a while back
not that long
wed been getting it on for a
while and we came back one night
we were staying
up at cloudcroft
we drove out on a golf course
and parked
and were sitting there talking
and for no particular reason
that i could see
she slides off her knickers
and hands them to me
and gets out of the car
i asked her what
she was doing
and she says
im going to fuck your car
all right
leave the door open
so
she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the ferrari
and pulls her dress up
around her waist
and spreads herself
across the windshield
in front of me
with no panties on
and shes had this brazilian
wax job you know
dont even think
im making this up
you cant make
this up all right
i mean she was a dancer
so she does
this full split
and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass
then she leans down
to see if im watching
like no im sitting there
reading my email
and she kisses me
upside down
and then she tells me
that shes going to come
i thought im losing my fucking mind
thats whats happening here
it was like one of those
one of those catfish things
you know one of those
one of those
bottomfeeders you see
going up the side
of the aquarium
sucking its way up the glass
i mean it was
i dont know
hallucinatory
you see a thing like that
it changes you
jesus
yeah tell me about it
did she
did she what
did she come
yeah sure yeah
finally she climbs down
and she comes around
and she gets in the car
and shuts the door
i hand her her knickers
she puts them in her purse
and she looks at me to see
what i thought about that
what i thought about it
well i dont know
what i thought about it
i mean i still dont
it was too gynecological
to be sexy almost
but mostly
i was just fucking stunned
and i asked her if she had
ever done that before
and she said she had done everything
before and i believe her
so she starts the engine
and turns on the lights
but the windshield
is so smeared
and i didnt have
anything to wipe it with
and she of course suggested
that i get out and lick it off
but i tried the wipers
and naturally the windshield
washer thing doesnt work
because italians dont really
believe in that sort of thing
and finally i took off my socks
and got out of the car
and used them
do you think
she knew what kind
of effect this might
have on a guy
jesus counselor are you kidding
she knows everything
you dont think this is
an odd thing to tell me
i think it is an odd thing
no i mean
why is it okay to tell
a thing like that
about somebody
somebody im banging
come on reiner
okay i dont know
youre probably right
maybe i wanted to see
what you would say
maybe theres more to it than that
maybe im scared
youre scared
yeah
probably yeah
sometimes
she scares
the shit out of me
because of that no not that
but
youre in love with her
i dont know what i am
yeah i guess
im in love with her but
you dont think
thats cause for worry
its like being
in love with
easeful death
well i dont know what it is
that youre trying to tell me
i know
does this have anything
to do with the deal
i dont know
youre right
i shouldnt have told you
just forget it
forget it
forget it
yeah
how do you
propose i do that
jesus counselor
how do i know
just forget it
i gotta go
sir may i help you
nope
are you there
anything
hes coming
yeah i hear him
all right
lets do it
jamie come in
are we okay
were good
hi
hi
i had a dream about you
did you
yeah
very strange i woke up and i
could still remember the dream
but i could not remember
why it was so disturbing
you know
i just wanted to call
and see if you were all right
are you superstitious
i dont think so
no more than the next person
and who would that be
excuse me
the next person
youre not gay
are you
no of course not
i shouldnt have called
i know you think
my world is naive
but is that so bad
to have hope
i dont know
i cant advise you
i know
you should be careful
what you wish for angel
you might not get it
i know
do you
yes i do
good
ill see you at the club
do you know
which truck it is
yeah
its got arizona plates
do you know how it goes
yeah
its colorcoded
red to red
green to green
black to black
see if it will start
wait a minute
this thing has
got a switch on it
try it now
counselor
weve got a problem
are you there
im here
how bad a problem
lets say pretty bad
and then multiply it by 10
fuck
meet me in the atrium
at the coronado
coronado when
now
we can start getting used
to our new lifestyle
morning
morning
have you seen the paper
nope
do you know who
the green hornet is
the green hornet
yes
hes a cartoon character
hes a biker
shit
mmm
all right what
is he in custody
its in the paper
what has he done
you dont know
anything about this
about what
like i said
its in the paper
he had no id on him
no
no head either
what the hell is this
i was hoping
you would tell me
i had a call from
our business partners
they wanted to speak with you
it seems the deceased
was working for them
now the shipment is missing
and all they have to go on is
that he was a client of yours
client
he wasnt a client
you got him out of jail
that doesnt
make him a client
it was a speeding ticket
for christs sake
jesus
i am perfectly
willing to believe
you had nothing
to do with this
but i am not the party
you need to convince
convince of what
for christs sake
that this is just
some sort of coincidence
theyre a pragmatic lot they
dont believe in coincidences
theyve heard of them
theyve just never seen one
so what happened
to the shipment
i asked them that
and
they sand se fue
its gone
mmm
jesus
does his mother know i guess she does
i need to call her
that is probably
not a good idea
why
she said shes going
to have you killed
sweet jesus
sorry about that what
can i get you to drink
hemlock
im sorry
ill have an oj
and a coffee
hell be having a double maalox
and a side of oxycontin
just bring us
the two coffees
and my oj
how did you
wind up with her
the mother
yes the mother
the mother of all mothers
court appointment
its an appeal one of
fergusons fuckedup deals
look they cant hook me onto
this thing mother or no mother
well i dont know what the kid
told her or what she told the kid
but at this juncture i would
avoid trying to explain myself
what do they think i
would do with this shit
they dont know
they dont care
they think everybody
is hooked into something
you need to think
about this counselor
these people are out 20 mil
do you understand
how serious this is
they think were all involved
dont they reiner too
what do you think
you fucking genius
have you ever
seen a snuff film
no you
would you
i would not
because the consumer
of the product
is essential to
its production
you cannot watch without
being accessory to a murder
will there be anything else
no thank you
do you know somebody
whos seen one
yes i do
he said the young girl was looking
into the camera crying
when her head was lopped off
think about that
the next time you do a line
i dont do drugs
well im glad to hear that
because what follows
i would hope
would be beyond your
powers of imagination
they let a figure in wearing
only a hood with eyeholes
to address himself to the
headless and quivering corpse
which you must remember was selected
because of her youth and beauty
and all of this
he has paid for
so what do you think that cost
ballpark
jesus
mmm
god
the point counselor
is that you may think
there are things that
these people are
simply incapable of
there are not
counselor i dont know
what you should do
but at this point
its out of your hands
what about you
ive known this day was
coming for a long time
do i regret what ive done
thats sophomoric
i shouldve jumped ship a
long time ago and i didnt
so what happens next
im going to go find a nice
quiet place
and sit down and
think about this
i would suggest you do the
same but i know you wont
if you think
counselor that you can
live in this world
and be no part of it
then all i can say
is youre wrong
its not that youre
going down counselor
its what youre
taking down with you
excuse me maam
im terribly sorry
to bother you
but my phone is out

greed
yeah
no you got in trouble
i tried to appeal to your
greed two years ago
no deal
now its too late
its too late
what do you think i should do
i dont know counselor
i dont know
they know
that youre stupid
they just dont
know how stupid
you say that like
its my hole card
maybe it is
suppose you could sit
down and have a chat
with these guys

id tell them the truth
youre just a fucking wonder
do you know that
go ahead

with the truth
id like to hear it
id tell them that

i was appointed by
the court to represent her
in an appeal on
a capital murder case

this
yes
i cant really take
your question seriously
its going
where its going
well either you think
its all going to work out
or you dont want
to think about it at all
because the third alternative
is unacceptable
yes
the excluded middle
i dont like
decisions made for me
but if you put them off waiting
for the maximum information
that may be what happens
you think theres
still space enough
to make the decision
and then there isnt
space
yeah
hmm
greed really takes you
to the edge doesnt it
mmm
thats not what greed does
thats what greed is
when the axe comes
through the door
ill already be gone

thats fair enough
youre in trouble

a long shot
i know
thank you
look the last time i spoke to
them they were in midland texas
that was about two days ago
so i called up the sheriff
there and i asked him
had they found any dead bodies
along the side of the highway
and he said that they did and i
said thank you and i hung up
i know you think im kidding
but im not
and im not out

but its another day
its tomorrow
see i love that
i love that
so what have we got
625 kilos
yeah something like that
shit you know
of all the people
you and i should
know if electronic money
earns an extra
day of interest
when it crosses
an international date line
right im just saying
thats a good question
why is there a fourth drum
no reason
its just convenient
convenient
mmhmm
yeah maybe we have a traveler
like somebody you wish
for them to go away
so you send them to america
thats all
can i have a look
you want to look
yeah
sick bastard
do you know who he is
no fuck no
hes some pinche pasajero
a passenger
yeah
an immigrant
so its just a way to
get rid of a body
yeah
from mexico
nonono
colombia
he came all
the way from colombia
mmhmm
what are you
going to do with him
nothing
he just goes
back in the truck
yeah goes back in the truck
then what
nothing its just normal
but they think
its a fucking joke
they think its funny so they
do this shit to me you know
but in this business you gotta
have a sense of humor or else
so what happens to him
nothing i told you
they go back together
in the truck
hes inside they paint it
he rides around
they try to sell it at
auction maybe maybe not
he rides around some more
sucking up the shit
hey welcome to america
huh
yes but i can only tell you what
i already told our friend
there is no one to talk to
could i come to the florida
the florida is closed
i would do
whatever you suggest
i have no suggestions
counselor
we could meet someplace
were meeting now
im not sure you
understand my position
but i do counselor
actions create consequences
which produce new worlds
and theyre all different
where the bodies are buried in the
desert that is a certain world
where the bodies are simply left
to be found that is another
and all these worlds
heretofore unknown to us
they must have always been
there must they not
i dont know
did you say something
i dont know what i was saying
counselor at some point
you have to acknowledge the reality
of the world that youre in
theres not some other world
this is not a hiatus
hiatus
i believe the word is hiatus
can you spell that for me
please
h  i  a  t  u  s
hiatus
thank you counselor
will you help me
i would urge you
to see the truth
of the situation youre in
counselor
that is my advice
it is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done
the world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made
is different from the world
where the mistakes were made
you are now at the crossing
and you want to choose but
there is no choosing there
theres only accepting
the choosing was
done a long time ago
are you there counselor
yes
i dont mean to offend you
but reflective men
often find themselves
at a place removed
from the realities of life
in any case we should
all prepare a place
where we can
accommodate all the tragedies
that sooner or later
will come to our lives
but this is an economy
few people care to practice
do you know
the words of machado
i know his name
lovely poet
machado was
a schoolteacher
and he married a young
beautiful girl
and he loved her very much
and she died
and then he became
a great poet
im not going to
become a great poet
no perhaps not but even
if you were to do so
it would not help you
machado would have
traded every word
every poem
every verse he ever wrote
for one more hour
with his beloved
and that is because
when it comes to grief
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply
because grief
transcends value
a man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart
and yet you cannot buy
anything with grief
because grief is worthless
why are you telling me this
because you continue to deny the
reality of the world youre in
do you love your wife so much
so completely
that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel
and i dont mean dying
because dying is easy
yes yes damn you
well that is good
to hear counselor
what are you saying
are you saying
this is a possibility
no
its impossible
you said i was that man
at that crossing
yes
at the understanding
that life is not
going to take you back
you are the world you have created
and when you cease to exist
this world that you have created
will also cease to exist
but for those with the
understanding that
theyre living the last
days of the world
death acquires
a different meaning
the extinction of all reality
is a concept no resignation
can encompass
and yet in that despair
which is transcendent
you will find the ancient
understanding
that the philosophers stone
will always be found despised
and buried in the mud
this may seem a small thing
in the face of annihilation
until annihilation occurs
and then all the grand designs
and all the grand plans
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are
and now counselor
i have to go because i
have to make other calls
if i have time i think
ill take a small nap
welcome to london heathrow
terminal 5
please keep your bags with you
at all times
any unattended luggage will be
removed and may be destroyed
i like the hat
thank you
the international
of course
hello madam

señor i must close
i know
you have no
place to go maybe
i fell asleep im sorry
there is no harm
no harm
thats a lovely thought
a magical thought
good night
its very dangerous out there
in the street
i know
if they hear somebody in the
street they shoot them
then they turn on the light
to see who is dead
why do they do that
to make a joke
to show that death doesnt care
that death has no meaning
do you believe that
no
of course not
all my family is dead
im the one who
has no meaning
please hang up
and try again
if you need help hang up
and dial your operator
so you got the password
five digits
whos rowena
i dont know
all right social security
drivers license
can i ask you something
sure
i dont see what good this will
do unless you have the computer
you and i are square
so are you planning
to see him again
what would be the point
hell be broke
smart girl
or is it worse than that
i dont want to get mixed up
in something heavy
you already are
how would you know he wont
come looking for you
but he wont will he
no
he wont
jesus
take the money
i dont want it
please yourself

momento
hey
oh god

good evening
lovely to see you madame
thank you
good evening sir
follow me
bon appãtit
its good to see you
you as well
hows marisa
shes fine
you should come and see us
i know
we should talk
yes of course
we need to move the money
as soon as possible
speaking as your banker
are you
returning to the states
no and i certainly
cant go to mexico
im thinking hong kong
really
mmm you dont
speak the language
im a quick study
well i suppose you could simply
buy into the market there
yes its not a problem
cash
the easiest way to move cash
is in diamonds
you can hold 20 million
in the palm of your hand
well i suppose theres no problem
selling diamonds in china
you can sell diamonds on mars
you need to get out michael
if anything went wrong
your name might come up
thats right
youre not really leaving
me a choice are you
youll thank me
and the cats
silvia died and raoul is
alive and well in arizona
ill miss him
i miss watching him
out on the high desert
bringing down jackrabbits
at 70 miles an hour
i never tired of that
to see quarry
killed with elegance
its just moving to me
is it sexual
yes of course a thing
like that is always sexual
the hunter has grace
beauty
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else
you can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do
and what they do is kill
we of course
are another matter
it is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin
perhaps you wont agree
but nothing is
crueler than a coward
and the slaughter to come
is probably
beyond our imagining
