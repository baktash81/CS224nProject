two o clock 
almost two o clock 
am or pm 
you re not serious 
not entirely 
it s afternoon 
i know 
what time is your flight 
7 40 to amsterdam 
i haven t seen you for two weeks 
and you re leaving
again this evening 
i know  i ll be gone for
just a few days 
god  you re a sexy woman 
what are you doing 
i m not doing anything 
they re going to take me
out of here on a gurney 
tell me something sexy 
i want you to put
your hand up my dress 
but you re not
wearing a dress 
what does that
have to do with it 
it s something you
like for me to say 
i know  but it has to
be real  doesn t it 
why don t you just tell me what it
is that you want me to do to you 
i want you to touch me 
you want me to
touch you where 
i want you to touch
me down there 
you do 
i really do 
say it more sexy 
i want you to touch me 
are you wet 
yes 
you really are 
yes 
god  you re sopping 
i know 
how did you get yourself
into such a state 
from thinking
about you 
from thinking about me  what 
from thinking about your
sweet face between my legs 
wait  wait  wait 
i think i should go tidy up 
i don t want you to 
slow  slow  slow 
how do you know
how to do that 
from hanging out
with really nasty girls 
you ve ruined me 
you know that 
i hope so 
god  you have the most luscious
pussy in all of christendom 
did you know that 
tell me what to do 
you know what to do 
tell me 
what if i shock you 
too bad 
i want you to
finger fuck me 
what 
you heard me 
i can t believe you said that 
believe it
you re reached a whole new level
of depravity  haven t you 
i thought it didn t mean
that much to girls 
depends on the girl 
i want you to stick
your finger up me 
and find my spot 
and push on it 
oh  my god 
god  you are luscious 
oh  my god 
illegals 
welcome to the united states 
do you like it because it
reminds you of somewhere else 
that s not why i like it 
i like it for itself 
it doesn t have
to be like something else 
no 
do i remind you
of someone else 
yes  you do 
someone you miss 
someone who is dead 
i don t think i miss things 
i think to miss something is to
hope that it will come back 
but it s not coming back 
i ve always known that
since i was a girl 
you don t think
that s a bit cold 
i think truth
has no temperature 
mmm 
there it goes 
follow me  please 
good morning 
i want her to have something that
she won t be
uncomfortable wearing 
i don t want to give her
a diamond so big 
she d be afraid to wear it 
she is probably more
courageous than you imagine 
is this a pillow 
no  it s an asscher 
look at the corners 
let s put it in
the grading box 
the pillow has a slight arc
to the sides 
it is a modern version
of the old mine cut 
let s look at the color 
put it table side down 
so you re looking
through the pavilion 
yes  there s more
to look through 
it appears to be yellow 
it s nitrogen that
gives it the yellow 
the colors start with d 
a d stone has no color 
so  what am i looking at 
h 
is that still a good color 
that s a very good color 
the truth is that
anything you can say
about the diamond is
in the nature of a flaw 
a perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light 
do you see the inclusion 
no 
it is small  what we
would call a feather 
yes 
i think i see it 
so  it is graded what 
a vs1 
some might grade it higher 
you might grade it higher 
you like this stone 
oh 
i like that stone 
how many carats is it 
3 9 
it s expensive 
tell me what you see 
remember 
you re not looking for merit 
this is a cynical business 
we seek only imperfection 
this is a 5 carat stone 
tell me what you see 
the culet seems big 
crown and pavilion don t fit 
the girdle comes out crooked 
very good 
but there is no
perfect diamond 
 en este mundo nada es perfecto
as my father would say 
you re sephardic 
yes 
do you know spain 
i do 
and spain me 
at one time  i thought she
would return from the grave 
but that is not to be 
every country that has driven out the
jews has suffered the same fate 
which is 
you don t want to hear 
we should talk stones 
the most valued stone
is the red diamond
from the argyle mines 
so very rare 
i ve seen two in a long life 
a prize almost beyond belief 
i do want to hear 
well  i have to say 
there s no culture  save for
the semitic culture  there 
the last known culture
before that was the greek 
and there will be no
culture after  nothing 
that s a bold claim 
the heart of any culture is to be
found in the nature of the hero 
who is that man
who is revered 
in the classical world 
it is the warrior 
but in the western world 
it is the man of god 
from moses to christ 
the prophet  the penitent 
such a figure was unknown to the
greeks  unheard of  unimaginable 
because there is only a man
of god  not a man of gods 
and this god is
the god of the jewish people 
there is no other god 
we see him   
what is the word 
purloined 
purloined in the west 
how do you steal a god 
the jew beholds
his tormentor dressed
in the vestments
of his own ancient culture 
everything bears
a strange familiarity 
the fit is always poor  and the
hands are always dripping blood 
that coat  didn t that
belong to uncle haim 
what about the shoes 
enough  i see your look 
no more philosophy 
the stones themselves
have their own view of things 
perhaps they are not
so silent as you think 
they were piped
up out of the earth
in a time before
any witness was 
but here they are 
let me show you 
this is a cautionary stone 
although  i suppose
every diamond is cautionary 
a cautionary diamond 
of course  why not 
it s not a small thing to wish
for  however unattainable   
to aspire to the stone s
endless destiny 
isn t that the meaning
of adornment 
to enhance the beauty
of the beloved   
is to acknowledge
both her frailty 
and the nobility
of that frailty 
we announce to the darkness   
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives 
that we will not
thereby be made less 
you will see 
afternoon  sir 
thank you 
looking good  counselor  chris 
how you doing 
good 
where s reiner 
he s in there 
you don t have
to worry about it 
yeah 
but who paid for it 
i put the credit card down 
so  obviously  i paid for it 
you paid for it 
i don t care 
but you like it 
i do like it 
i ve never been to barbados  are
all the ladies as sexy as you 
it s a steaming pit
of sexual abandon 
i don t believe you 
well  it used to be 
i left 
come in 
good morning  counselor 
good morning 
malkina 
hola  guapo 
hey 
how s laura 
incredible 
that sounds about right 
nice lady 
nice lady 
i assume that she s not privy to
your newest business venture 
she s not 
and your lady 
uh   
yeah 
 yeah   what 
i don t know what she knows 
i don t want to know 
you don t trust her 
jesus  counselor 
she s a woman 
i don t mean to
sound that cold 
i just mean that  where men are
concerned  they ve got their own agenda 
i always liked smart women  but it s
been an expensive hobby  you know 
yeah 
do you know what all that stuff is 
uh   
mostly  yeah 
anything i don t know  i can ask her 
which worries me even more 
hmm 
you never told
me what happened
with you and
the lovely clarissa 
ms  clarissa of the
extraordinary body 
she used to go
around with no bra 
those firm nipples in
her blouse or t shirt 
i think in the end 
it was jealousy that undid us 
jealousy 
yeah  she was getting
more pussy than i was 
is that true 
i think so 
probably  yeah 
i have to say that for
a girl who liked girls 
she took an extraordinary
interest in the male member 
she sucked on it so hard it
finally corrected my vision 
she left me for this
good looking black woman 
whoo 
had a boyfriend  played for the oilers 
nice chap  nice chap 
we met once for drinks
at this club in dallas
to discuss our mutual plight 
he was taking it rather
poorly  i have to say 
women do better 
don t they 
maybe they have
more practice at it 
yeah  well  my guess
is that in most cases 
if you still have the woman
you re weeping over 
you ll be weeping harder 
mm hmm 
so  is this place secure 
who knows 
i don t speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere 
there s a scrambler on
the phone  but still 
there s a lot of
smart people out there 
of course  anybody who
thinks he s the smartest   
is on his way
to the slam 
would that be me 
no  no 
although  i have to
say that i always thought
a law degree was
a license to steal   
and that you  for one  hadn t
really capitalized on it 
you re not the straight dude
people think though  are you 
i guess not 
i don t mean the caper  i mean you 
women like you 
all right 
do you know what
they like about you 
i m a good fuck 
right 
no  they can sniff out
the moral dilemma 
the paradox 
 moral dilemma   
yeah  they re drawn to it 
not sure why 
maybe it s just that lacking
any moral sense themselves   
they re fascinated
by it in men 
men are attracted to flawed
women  too  of course   
but their illusion
is that they can fix them 
women don t want
to fix anything 
they only want
to be entertained 
the truth about
women is you can
do anything to them
except bore them 
well   
there s nothing about laura
that i would want to fix 
maybe not 
do you think she knows
things about me
that i don t
know about myself 
jesus  counselor  i m not even sure
what sort of question that is 
yeah 
okay 
if you pursue this road
that you ve embarked upon   
you will eventually
come to moral decisions
that will take you
completely by surprise 
you won t see
it coming at all 
i don t intend
to take this up as a trade 
yeah  one time deal  right 
which you ve heard
a thousand times 
no  but a few 
what usually happens is that
after a couple of deals   
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street 
and how does that
work out for them 
not well 
so  that would
be a moral issue 
not for me 
or for your associates 
yeah  well   
they have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure 
do you know
what a bolito is 
no 
a bolo is one of those
skinny neckties   
or one of those things
you throw in argentina 
yeah  right 
no  in this case 
it s a mechanical device   
and it has this
small electric motor   
with this rather
incredible compound gear
that retrieves
a steel cable 
battery driven 
and the cable is made
out of some unholy alloy
almost impossible to cut it 
and it s in a loop 
and you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head   
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away 
no one ever even sees you 
and pulling the cable
activates the motor
and the noose
starts to tighten   
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero 
it cuts the guy s head off 
yeah  well  it can 
there s nothing he can do 
no 
jesus 
yeah 
how long does it take 
oh   
three  four minutes 
five maybe 
it depends on
your collar size 
you re shitting me 
no no no 
it s just that
there s no easy way
to turn the thing off 
or reason to 
it just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then   
it self destructs 
actually  you re probably dead
in less than a minute 
from strangulation 
no 
the wire cuts through
the carotid arteries   
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators   
and everybody goes home 
sweet 
yeah  sweet 
think about it 
counselor 
so where does all this
beheading shit come from 
you never used to see that 
i think it s blown
in here from the east 
meaning the east 
yeah 
you put nine mexicans
and an arab in a room 
and give them each  100 
and come back in a few hours 
who do you think is gonna
be holding the grand 
so you gearing up to do business
with them down the road 
the arabs 
yeah 
no  no 
why s that 
because they don t
need your money 
do you have a dog 
do i have a dog 
yes 
no  ma am 
oh 
i don t have a dog 
okay 
these are for me 
for you 
yes  ma am 
it s a diet 
a diet 
see  i probably shouldn t
even be telling you this 
i mean  i ve tried
a couple of times 
and i gotta say 
it works pretty good 
i mean 
you don t really eat 
when you get hungry  you just
pop a couple of these bad boys 
i carry a baggy full
around with me 
last time 
i lost 27 pounds in 30 days 
i d pretty much
recommend it to anybody 
these diets you read about 
i know this works 
i mean  but of course  like anything
else  you gotta use your head 
time before 
i woke up in the hospital 
but you just gotta
keep your mind
on your business
like anything else 
if you wanna lose weight 
this is it 
after a few days  you don t
even want anything else 
i d absolutely
recommend it to anybody 
but you said you
woke up in the hospital 
what happened  did you get a
systemic reaction or what 
no  ma am  it wasn t
anything like that 
i was sitting in the street licking
my balls  and a car hit me 
take care now 
you hear 
what 
yeah  well  too bad 
here you go  ma am 
thank you 
enjoy your meal 
thank you 
i have something to
discuss with you   
and i m a bit scared 
hmm 
have you been bad 
no 
actually  i don t have that
much to discuss  so   
let me just give you this   
and tell me what you think 
will you 
don t leave me hanging  here 
yes  i will 
try it 
what  you didn t know 
i knew   
but i was scared anyway 
that s good 
it s so beautiful 
you are a glory 
i m a glory 
yes 
as in  glorious   
you re a glorious woman 
and you re a man
of impeccable taste 
sorry  i shouldn t
have said that 
you can t take it back 
here 
i intend to love you until i die 
me first 
not on your life 
that s a nice ring 
how many carats is it 
i don t know 
you don t know 
no 
you ve gotta be kidding me 
no  i don t know 
let me see it 
no  take it off 
hmm 
it s a 3 5 carat 
maybe 3 8 
it s a nice stone 
it s asscher cut 
thank you 
good color 
probably an f  or a g 
nothing visible 
so at least a vs2 
wanna know how much
it s worth 
no 
you really don t  do you 
i really don t 
so  have you set a date 
not yet 
i really want to get married in the church 
and he s okay with that 
he was married before  so i
thought that would be a problem 
but the church doesn t recognize
other marriages  so   
are you nervous 
a little bit 
sometimes i am 
so  you re a church lady 
i go 
it s important to me 
and what about confession 
yeah 
well  maybe not so much 
does the priest
ever ask you about sex 
he doesn t ask  but you re
supposed to tell him everything 
and all the nasty shit you did   
you re just supposed
to pretend like
you re never gonna
do it again  right 
i guess 
strange 
and suppose you ve done
something really nasty 
he doesn t press you
for the details 
i don t think so 
you re blushing 
uh uh 
okay  we can change
the subject 
we ll talk about my sex life 
you re teasing 
just rattling your cage 
what a world 
do you think
the world is strange 
i meant yours 
  hello 
  reiner  are you there 
counselor 
i think i m in 
you can t think  counselor 
you re in or you re out 
all right  i m in 
and thanks 
don t thank me yet 
i won t say   i hope you know what
you re doing  because you don t 
but  money problems
are serious problems 
you keep telling yourself it s
not as bad as it appears   
and then one morning 
you realize it s worse 
am i close 
my back is against
the fucking wall  man 
i believe you 
do you have the cash 
i ll have it thursday 
all right 
i ll call westray
and set it up 
counselor 
westray 
it s not dark
enough in here for you 
wow 
that s a dandy 
what happened 
confrontation with a doorman 
 confrontation  
jesus 
what did you say to him 
i think i told him that he was
not to take it personally   
but he should go fuck himself 
what did he say to that 
he said   i m gonna hurt
you  white person   
what will you have 
i ll have a heineken 
make it two 
i didn t know you
got into donnybrooks 
i don t 
anyway  it was
in another country 
and besides 
the wretch is dead 
no  but i sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him 
bloody expensive  too 
you surprise me 
counselor 
i m just a middle man 
i know the smallest
crumb can devour us 
you learn not to let anything pass 
you can t afford to 
i should keep that in mind 
you might keep that in mind 
so  fire away 
all right 
what do you do with the money 
what do i do 
or what does one do 
what do you do 
mine goes offshore 
we can talk about it if you like 
but you can t use my people 
all right 
okay 
let me make a call 
all right 
what else 
you seem unsettled 
i m all right 
uh   
what s the buy out
for this whole deal 
net net 
yeah  net net 
it s hard to put
a cold dollar on it 
you don t know what your
expenses are up front 
it s 625 kilos  goes for about
 50 an ounce in colombia 
and the street value in dallas
can go as high as two grand 
is that where it s going 
dallas 
no  it s going to chicago 
don t write that down 
we re probably
looking at 20 million 
maybe a little more 
it s 21 900 ounces 
good return on
your investment 
did you do that in your head 
no  i remembered it 
but i know someone who could
do that in their head 
i ll bet you re right 
if you re not in 
you need to tell me 
i m all right 
it s just not our people 
you got the money guys 
you gotta get money in dollars into
mexico  and you gotta get it out 
to do that 
you need a corporation 
you can t go
through the us banks 
and even then  you have to
have someone on the inside 
you d be surprised
at the people
who are in this business 
very surprised 
you have a corporation 
no  of course not 
you just pay the points 
the other option
is cash  of course 
that s an even bigger headache
for all the obvious reasons 
the biggest issue is not that your guy
is gonna fall for some pole dancer
and go south with a
million of your duckets 
the biggest issue
is someone is gonna
figure out who he is
and what he s up to 
here we go 
no  you re good 
thank you 
well  cheers 
a plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses 
is that your normal toast 
increasingly 
so  if the drug wars stop   
this will dry up  right 
let s just say 
it will be more than risky 
that s the thing
reiner doesn t seem to get 
you may have
noticed his lifestyle
has become
increasingly lavish 
i ve noticed 
i don t set foot in his clubs 
and i miss the bastard 
we used to share
a taste for exotic women 
in fact  a few times
shared the women themselves 
that wouldn t include the
present one  would it 
now 
why would you ask me that 
no reason  sorry 
the answer is no  of course 
the civil answer 
butlsee a murky picture forming
in that mind of yours 
how well do you
know malkina 
not very well  why 
because you don t know someone
until you know what they want   
is why 
i ll try and remember that 
good 
and reiner 
reiner 
reiner is beyond advising 
reiner thinks
nothing bad can happen 
and he s in love 
you two are going
to open a new club 
is that all right 
sure  why not 
what the fuck 
do you know how many people were
killed in juã rez last year 
no  a lot 
yeah 
i think 3 000 is a lot 
this is a different species 
counselor 
they will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog 
jesus  westray 
let me ask you  who do you think
killed all those young girls
before
the so called drug wars 
i don t know  nobody knows 
 nobody knows  
no 
come on  counselor 
hundreds of girls 
thousands  most likely 
follow the money 
if you have so much cash that you re
insulating your house with it 
and you ve bought all the
clothes  and the cars 
and the guns you can
find a place to put 
and you re morally depraved
beyond all human recognition 
what then do you
do with your money 
why do they kill them 
who knows  fun  snuff films  you ll
see those will start turning up 
anyway  what do you
do with a 15 year old
you just ravaged in
some heinous manner 
do you think the drug lords
hired kidnappers
to keep them supplied
with young girls 
i think they have kidnappers
on full retainer 
i should keep
that in mind  too 
i can t advise you  counselor 
but you are advising me 
i just need you to be sure
that you re locked in 
because i don t know   
maybe i should tell you what mickey
rourke told what s his face 
that s my recommendation anyway 
counselor  don t do it 
 this arson is
a serious crime   
yeah  and so is this 
i guess i m a little
taken aback at the
cautionary nature
of this conversation 
good word 
 cautionary   
in scots law  it defines
an instrument in which
one person stands as
surety for another 
as surety 
yes 
sounds a bit primitive 
it is 
the problem being 
of course   
is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding 
what about you 
i can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money  can you 
truth is  counselor  i can walk
away from all of this in a second 
and i mean all of it 
you re not gonna believe this  but
i m going to tell you anyway 
i think about my life 
i can live in a monastery 
scrub the steps  clean the
pots  try some gardening 
you re serious 
very 
why don t you 
in a word  women 
i ve seen it all  counselor 
it s all shit 
it s all shit 
i ll be in touch 
hey  counselor 
you want to know why jesus
wasn t born in mexico 
no  why 
couldn t find three wise men
or a virgin 
and  counselor  here s
something else to consider 
the beheadings and the mutilations 
that s just business 
you gotta keep up appearances 
it s not like there s some
smoldering rage at the bottom of it 
let s see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill 
i don t know 
who 
you  counselor 
you 
hey 
did you bring cigarettes 
they treating you well 
oh  yeah

like a fucking schoolmarm 
how about a businesswoman

or a time of day 
you re telling me he was going
206 miles an hour  in what 
on that jap bike of his 
listen  if you could get
his money back   
he could pay the fine
and get out of there 
he s not getting
his money back 
how much is the fine

christ   400

i don t even like  ruth   
take care  ruth 
guard 
pull over 
how are you doing 
get this thing out of here 
you got it 
go 
sorry 
i got held up 
how are you  man 
you see a place like this in the cold
light of day  it looks pretty seedy 
but you get the right lighting
in here   
and some music 
some good looking girls   
and it s a whole other world 
jesus 
we re looking
for cash flow here 
so  how soon do you think 
two weeks 
three  max 
yeah 
are you gonna
keep the dance floor 
yeah  a dance floor takes
up a lot of space   
but you try and chat
up a girl at a bar   
she s supposed to
tell you to fuck off 
she doesn t want to
look like a bitch 
but  you ask a chick to dance   
well  you got a better shot 
you know peterson  right 
sure 
yeah  do you know
he speaks portuguese 
no 
yeah  his family was from brazil 
so this cousin of
peterson shows up 
and we are all out
here on saturday night 
and the cousin is
asking peterson 
 how do you say 
 may i have this dance   
only we get wind of it 
and we shut peterson up and we are
coaching him on how to say it 
repeat after me   i want
to eat your pussy    right 
and we work with him till
he s pretty much got it down 
 i want to eat your pussy   
and we send him off 
he s this kind of
elegant looking guy anyway 
so he goes off
across the room 
and he picks out this really 
really great looking girl 
and he stands in front of her  gives
her this little bow  and says 
 i want to eat your pussy   
and of course 
the table gets pretty quiet 
and the girl looks up at him
and says   what did you say  
and he says it again  a little
bow   i want to eat your pussy   
and she stares at him
for a minute
and then looks
over to see past him 
and of course  hears these
three guys across the room
all hugging each other and just
weeping  weeping with merriment 
so she gets up  and she takes
peterson s cousin by the hand 
and she takes him out
to this van in the parking lot
and proceeds to
fuck his brains out 
he s gone for an hour  we don t
know what the hell is going on 
and finally 
she leads him back in 
and gives him
this big  sexy kiss 
and she looks over at us to
make sure we re all watching 
and sends him
back to the table 
well  we re going nuts  nuts 
peterson is trying to get
the story out of him 
and he s jabbering away 
and we re like   what s he saying 
what s he saying  
it s the whole thing  it s blowjob 
it s the works  the works 
jesus  we re just
fucking flabbergasted 
and we are just sitting there
staring at each other 
and after a while 
peterson gets up
and looks at us 
and off he goes 
he crosses the floor
to where this
cool looking girl is
sitting by herself 
and he gives her a little bow
and announces that he
wants to eat her pussy 
well  of course 
well  this time  the husband is
coming out of the men s room 
and he s about 
i don t know  11 feet tall 
this guy hit him so hard that
he came out of his loafers 
he came out of his loafers 
so peterson is lying dead on the
dance floor in his socked feet   
anyway 
they called an ambulance 
and they hauled peterson
off to the hospital 
and he s got a concussion
and a broken jaw 
jesus 
yeah 
what did you guys do 
nothing  we left 
we had enough fun
for one evening 
anyway  the other big
space eater is the bandstand 
i think what i m gonna do
is take the wall out   
and get rid of the hallway 
yeah 
i think that will do it 
yeah  all right 
i ll talk to my guy and it
should take two or three days 
that s my boy 
there he is 
i won t be able to get what the
kid is saying  is that okay 
we don t care what
the kid is saying 
did you get it 
yeah  it s not much 
that s okay 
keep your eye on him 
i am 
this guy doesn t read
the fucking newspapers 
i know 
could you see what it was 
nope 
but it s in the helmet 
yeah 
it s in the helmet 
yes 
we got him 
good  stay with him 
and call me back in an hour 
come here 
well  counselor 
how are you making it 
i m all right 
is this your lady 
it is 
nice to meet you  ma am 
me and the counselor
go back a ways 
we do  i m afraid 
don t be afraid 
hell  i m okay with everything 
are you okay with everything 
counselor 
i am if you are 
see  now  ain t he just
the best son of a bitch 
all right  tony  let s go 
how long have you known
this guy  petunia 
  long enough 
  long enough 
maybe you should listen
to your lady friend 
is that what you do  counselor 
pretty much 
does he keep you entertained 
none of your business 
because you look to me
like you might get bored easy 
tony  let s go 
tony  i m leaving 
hell  counselor  keep your seat 
you don t have
to get up for me 
see  petunia  the counselor has a
way of sullin  up like a possum   
when he don t get his own way 
i m going to say
you probably noticed it 
but that ain t
really the problem 
the real problem is   
his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes
for you to wind up
under the bus 
do you know what i m saying 
anyhow  that s how i see it 
you take care now  you hear 
baby 
who was that 
it s an old client 
it goes with the territory 
i m sorry 
hi 
 hi  
oh  um   
bless me  father 
for i have sinned 
and 
how long has it been
since your last confession 
well  i ve never been before 
this is my first 
are you catholic 
no 
then i cannot
give you absolution 
i know   
but i just wanted to tell
somebody what i had done   
and i thought   why not go to
a professional  
have you thought about
taking instructions 
that s not something
i do very well 
i mean  in order to
become a catholic 
then you could confess   
and you will be
forgiven for your sins 
what if they re unforgivable 
nothing is unforgivable 
oh  yeah 
well  i haven t killed anybody 
but i ve been pretty bad 
look  we have people here
waiting to go to confession   
so  i m sorry 
they can wait 
i did 
who did you talk to about this 
why did i talk to somebody 
you said
 bless me  father   
well  i asked a friend but she
didn t know i was gonna do it 
so we re done here then 
i haven t told you my sins yet 
i don t want to hear your sins 
there would be no point 
were you baptized 
i don t know 
it s possible 
your parents never told you 
i never knew my parents 
they were thrown out of a helicopter
into the atlantic ocean   
when i was three 
listen   
you don t have to do
the whole forgiveness thing 
all you have to do is listen 
to the sins 
women tell you
about sex don t they 
i can t talk about that 
yeah  but every woman who
goes to confess tells you   
that she s an adulterer or
fornicator or something   
or why else would
she be there 
so you must have a very
unusual picture of women 
you must think that they re
just having sex all the time   
you really need to go now 
if you don t leave  i leave 
wait  where are you going 
i wasn t finished 
i know 
i just wanted to
hear your voice 
i really miss you 
i really miss you 
i miss you so much 
you know what else i miss 
don t go there 
are you sure 
you re just glowing
with sexual health 
is that bad 
no 
i love it 
do you miss me 
yes 
bad  badly 
you haven t been taking liberties
with your person  have you 
no 
you couldn t touch it
with a powder puff 
do you remember
the night we met 
yes  the airport parking lot 
did you know i would
do it that night 
did i know you would
do it with me 
of course 
why there 
i don t know  i thought it would
be exciting  like in high school 
i remember asking you
if you were all right 
 cause you were
gasping like an asthmatic 
oh  my goodness 
is this phone sex 
i wish you were here with me 
i know 
life is being in bed with you 
everything else
is just waiting 
i love you very much 
i love you so much 
good night 
good night 
i don t know 
women have funny
ideas about sex 
they re supposed
to be so modest 
let me tell you 
when they get it
in their heads how
they want to fuck   
they re like a freight train 
sign here 
the things i ve
learned about women 
fuck 
about half of it
i would like to forget 
i m not sure
if i follow you 
what is it you would like
to forget  for instance 
you don t want to know 
sure i do 
i don t know  let s talk
about something else 
here 
just pull up your socks
and tell me 
yeah   
i don t know 
what is it you would
like to forget 
all right 
i would like to forget about
malkina fucking my car 
what 
see 
what did you just say 
i said i would like to forget
about malkina fucking my car 
i think 
what the hell are
you talking about 
do you remember
that yellow california i had 
sure  nice car 
very nice car 
anyway  this was a while back 
not that long 
we d been getting it on for a
while  and we came back one night 
we were staying
up at cloudcroft 
we drove out on a golf course
and parked 
and we re sitting there  talking   
and for no particular reason
that i could see   
she slides off her knickers   
and hands them to me
and gets out of the car 
i asked her what
she was doing   
and she says 
 i m going to fuck your car   
all right 
leave the door open 
so   
she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the ferrari   
and pulls her dress up
around her waist   
and spreads herself
across the windshield
in front of me
with no panties on 
and she s had this brazilian
wax job  you know 
don t even think
i m making this up 
you can t make
this up  all right 
i mean  she was a dancer 
so  she does
this full split   
and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass 
then she leans down
to see if i m watching 
like  no  i m sitting there
reading my email 
and she kisses me
upside down 
and then she tells me
that she s going to come 
i thought   i m losing my fucking mind 
that s what s happening here   
it was like one of those   
one of those catfish things 
you know  one of those   
one of those
bottom feeders you see
going up the side
of the aquarium   
sucking its way up the glass 
i mean  it was 
i don t know   
hallucinatory 
you see a thing like that 
it changes you 
jesus 
yeah  tell me about it 
did she    
did she what 
did she come 
yeah  sure  yeah 
finally she climbs down
and she comes around   
and she gets in the car
and shuts the door 
i hand her her knickers 
she puts them in her purse   
and she looks at me to see
what i thought about that 
what i thought about it 
well  i don t know
what i thought about it 
i mean  i still don t 
it was too gynecological
to be sexy  almost 
but mostly 
i was just fucking stunned 
and i asked her if she had
ever done that before   
and she said she had done everything
before  and i believe her 
so she starts the engine
and turns on the lights 
but the windshield
is so smeared 
and i didn t have
anything to wipe it with 
and she  of course  suggested
that i get out and lick it off 
but i tried the wipers 
and naturally  the windshield
washer thing doesn t work 
because italians don t really
believe in that sort of thing 
and finally  i took off my socks
and got out of the car
and used them 
do you think
she knew what kind
of effect this might
have on a guy 
jesus  counselor  are you kidding 
she knows everything 
you don t think this is
an odd thing to tell me 
i think it is an odd thing 
no  i mean 
why is it okay to tell
a thing like that
about somebody   
somebody i m banging 
come on  reiner 
okay  i don t know 
you re probably right 
maybe i wanted to see
what you would say 
maybe there s more to it than that 
maybe i m scared 
you re scared 
yeah 
probably  yeah 
sometimes   
she scares
the shit out of me 
because of that  no  not that 
but   
you re in love with her 
i don t know what i am 
yeah  i guess
i m in love with her  but   
you don t think
that s cause for worry 
it s like being
in love with   
easeful death 
well  i don t know what it is
that you re trying to tell me 
i know 
does this have anything
to do with the deal 
i don t know 
you re right 
i shouldn t have told you 
just forget it 
forget it 
forget it 
yeah 
how do you
propose i do that 
jesus  counselor 
how do i know 
just forget it 
i gotta go 
sir  may i help you 
nope 
are you there 
anything 
he s coming 
yeah  i hear him 
all right 
let s do it 
jamie  come in 
are we okay 
we re good 
hi 
hi 
i had a dream about you 
did you 
yeah 
very strange  i woke up  and i
could still remember the dream 
but i could not remember
why it was so disturbing 
you know 
i just wanted to call
and see if you were all right 
are you superstitious 
i don t think so 
no more than the next person 
and who would that be 
excuse me 
the next person 
you re not gay 
are you 
no  of course not 
i shouldn t have called 
i know you think
my world is naive 
but is that so bad 
to have hope 
i don t know 
i can t advise you 
i know 
you should be careful
what you wish for  angel 
you might not get it 
i know 
do you 
yes  i do 
good 
i ll see you at the club 
do you know
which truck it is 
yeah 
it s got arizona plates 
do you know how it goes 
yeah 
it s color coded 
red to red 
green to green 
black to black 
see if it will start 
wait a minute 
this thing has
got a switch on it 
try it now 
counselor 
we ve got a problem 
are you there 
i m here 
how bad a problem 
let s say pretty bad 
and then multiply it by 10 
fuck 
meet me in the atrium
at the coronado 
coronado  when 
now 
we can start getting used
to our new lifestyle 
morning 
morning 
have you seen the paper 
nope 
do you know who
the green hornet is 
the green hornet 
yes 
he s a cartoon character 
he s a biker 
shit 
mmm 
all right  what 
is he in custody 
it s in the paper 
what has he done 
you don t know
anything about this 
about what 
like i said 
it s in the paper 
he had no id on him 
no 
no head either 
what the hell is this 
i was hoping
you would tell me 
i had a call from
our business partners 
they wanted to speak with you 
it seems the deceased
was working for them 
now the shipment is missing   
and all they have to go on is
that he was a client of yours 
client 
he wasn t a client 
you got him out of jail 
that doesn t
make him a client 
it was a speeding ticket 
for christ s sake 
jesus 
i am perfectly
willing to believe
you had nothing
to do with this   
but i am not the party
you need to convince 
convince of what 
for christ s sake 
that this is just
some sort of coincidence 
they re a pragmatic lot  they
don t believe in coincidences 
they ve heard of them 
they ve just never seen one 
so  what happened
to the shipment 
i asked them that 
and 
they sand   se fue   
it s gone 
mmm 
jesus 
does his mother know  i guess she does 
i need to call her 
that is probably
not a good idea 
why 
she said she s going
to have you killed 
sweet jesus 
sorry about that  what
can i get you to drink 
hemlock 
i m sorry 
i ll have an oj
and a coffee 
he ll be having a double maalox
and a side of oxycontin 
just bring us
the two coffees 
and my oj 
how did you
wind up with her 
the mother 
yes  the mother 
the mother of all mothers 
court appointment 
it s an appeal  one of
ferguson s fucked up deals 
look  they can t hook me onto
this thing  mother or no mother 
well  i don t know what the kid
told her  or what she told the kid 
but at this juncture  i would
avoid trying to explain myself 
what do they think i
would do with this shit 
they don t know 
they don t care 
they think everybody
is hooked into something 
you need to think
about this  counselor 
these people are out 20 mil 
do you understand
how serious this is 
they think we re all involved 
don t they  reiner  too 
what do you think 
you fucking genius 
have you ever
seen a snuff film 
no  you 
would you 
i would not 
because the consumer
of the product
is essential to
its production 
you cannot watch without
being accessory to a murder 
will there be anything else 
no  thank you 
do you know somebody
who s seen one 
yes  i do 
he said the young girl was looking
into the camera  crying   
when her head was lopped off 
think about that
the next time you do a line 
i don t do drugs 
well  i m glad to hear that 
because what follows 
i would hope
would be beyond your
powers of imagination 
they let a figure in  wearing
only a hood with eyeholes   
to address himself to the
headless and quivering corpse 
which  you must remember  was selected
because of her youth and beauty 
and all of this 
he has paid for 
so  what do you think that cost 
ballpark 
jesus 
mmm 
god 
the point  counselor   
is that you may think
there are things that
these people are
simply incapable of 
there are not 
counselor  i don t know
what you should do 
but at this point 
it s out of your hands 
what about you 
i ve known this day was
coming for a long time 
do i regret what i ve done 
that s sophomoric 
i should ve jumped ship a
long time ago  and i didn t 
so  what happens next 
i m going to go find a nice 
quiet place 
and sit down and
think about this 
i would suggest you do the
same  but i know you won t 
if you think 
counselor  that you can
live in this world
and be no part of it   
then all i can say
is you re wrong 
it s not that you re
going down  counselor   
it s what you re
taking down with you 
excuse me  ma am 
i m terribly sorry
to bother you   
but my phone is out
and it s my kid s birthday 
may i please use your phone
for just a minute 
sure 
thank you 
where are you 
i can t call you
on my cell anymore 
now  listen to me  go home and
wait for me there  i ll call you

i love you

can we go somewhere else 
uh  sure 
come on 
you think i know something you don t 
counselor  what would that be 
i don t know what  how bad  means 
bad is bad 
westray thinks we re fucked 
 we  
yeah 
all right 
i suppose i could ask you
if you ve got a rat
in your pocket 
you re not serious 
well  when was the last time
you tried to call him 
yesterday  why 
why 
because i couldn t
reach him now  all right 
what are you going to do 
i don t know 
what are you 
i don t know 
that s what westray said 
but he did know  didn t he 
what are you going
to use for money 
i ve got some money 
i don t think so 
if you had any serious
money  you wouldn t
be in this jackpot
in the first place 
i might 
oh  yeah 
well  i know why i m in it 
do you 
sure  same as you 
greed 
yeah 
no  you got in trouble 
i tried to appeal to your
greed two years ago 
no deal 
now  it s too late 
it s too late 
what do you think i should do 
i don t know  counselor 
i don t know 
they know
that you re stupid 
they just don t
know how stupid 
you say that like
it s my hole card 
maybe it is 
suppose you could sit
down and have a chat
with these guys 
what would you say 
i d tell them the truth 
you re just a fucking wonder 
do you know that 
go ahead 
go ahead what 
with the truth 
i d like to hear it 
i d tell them that
i never even met this kid 
that i got him out of jail
on a speeding charge 
okay  how did he
happen to hire you 
he didn t  i got him out of
jail as a favor to his mother 
how do you happen
to know the mother 
i was appointed by
the court to represent her
in an appeal on
a capital murder case 
do you know what her son did
for a living 
no 
but you do now 
i do now 
and would it please you to tell
the court what
that occupation was 
how did i get in court 
i thought i was
talking to cartel guys 
sorry  sorry  sorry  i was
giving you the easiest way out 
very funny 
yeah  well  probably not 
i m really worried  baby 
it s going to be all right 
i ll take care of it 
don t worry 
can t you meet me someplace 
i can t right now 
that s not possible
that you can t

so   
where do you think this
is going  mi capitan 
this 
yes 
i can t really take
your question seriously 
it s going
where it s going 
well  either you think
it s all going to work out   
or you don t want
to think about it at all 
because the third alternative
is unacceptable 
yes 
the excluded middle 
i don t like
decisions made for me 
but if you put them off  waiting
for the maximum information   
that may be what happens 
you think there s
still space enough
to make the decision 
and then there isn t 
 space   
yeah 
hmm 
greed really takes you
to the edge  doesn t it 
mmm 
that s not what greed does 
that s what greed is 
when the axe comes
through the door   
i ll already be gone 
you know that 
that s fair enough 
you re in trouble

it will be a yes or no 
i will do what i can do 
but you must
know that this is   
a long shot 
i know 
thank you 
look  the last time i spoke to
them  they were in midland  texas 
that was about two days ago 
so  i called up the sheriff
there and i asked him   
had they found any dead bodies
along the side of the highway 
and he said that they did  and i
said   thank you   and i hung up 
i know you think i m kidding 
but i m not 
and i m not out 
that s right  and i m not
kidding about that either 
really 
no  i know where the truck is going 
i always did 
really 
well  i think that falls under
the category of  tough shit   
we re all done here 
here 
thanks 
in the last two accounts  we re
only an hour different   
but it s another day 
it s tomorrow 
see  i love that 
i love that 
so  what have we got 
625 kilos 
yeah  something like that 
shit  you know 
of all the people   
you and i should
know if electronic money
earns an extra
day of interest   
when it crosses
an international date line 
right  i m just saying 
that s a good question 
why is there a fourth drum 
no reason 
it s just convenient 
convenient 
mm hmm 
yeah  maybe we have a traveler 
like somebody  you wish
for them to go away   
so  you send them to america 
that s all 
can i have a look 
you want to look 
yeah 
sick bastard 
do you know who he is 
no  fuck  no 
he s some pinche pasajero 
a passenger 
yeah 
an immigrant 
so  it s just a way to
get rid of a body 
yeah 
from mexico 
no no no 
colombia 
he came all
the way from colombia 
mm hmm 
what are you
going to do with him 
nothing 
he just goes
back in the truck 
yeah  goes back in the truck 
then what 
nothing  it s just normal 
but they think
it s a fucking joke 
they think it s funny  so they
do this shit to me  you know 
but in this business  you gotta
have a sense of humor  or else   
so  what happens to him 
nothing  i told you   
they go back together
in the truck 
he s inside  they paint it 
he rides around 
they try to sell it at
auction maybe  maybe not 
he rides around some more 
sucking up the shit 
hey  welcome to america 
huh 
yes  but i can only tell you what
i already told our friend 
there is no one to talk to 
could i come to the florida 
the florida is closed 
i would do
whatever you suggest 
i have no suggestions 
counselor 
we could meet someplace 
we re meeting now 
i m not sure you
understand my position 
but i do  counselor 
actions create consequences
which produce new worlds   
and they re all different 
where the bodies are buried in the
desert  that is a certain world 
where the bodies are simply left
to be found  that is another 
and all these worlds 
heretofore unknown to us   
they must have always been
there  must they not 
i don t know 
did you say something 
i don t know what i was saying 
counselor  at some point 
you have to acknowledge the reality
of the world that you re in 
there s not some other world 
this is not a hiatus 
hiatus 
i believe the word is  hiatus  
can you spell that for me 
please 
h   i   a   t   u   s 
hiatus 
thank you  counselor 
will you help me 
i would urge you
to see the truth
of the situation you re in 
counselor 
that is my advice 
it is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done 
the world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made   
is different from the world
where the mistakes were made 
you are now at the crossing 
and you want to choose  but
there is no choosing there 
there s only accepting 
the choosing was
done a long time ago 
are you there  counselor 
yes 
i don t mean to offend you   
but reflective men
often find themselves   
at a place removed
from the realities of life 
in any case  we should
all prepare a place   
where we can
accommodate all the tragedies
that sooner or later
will come to our lives 
but this is an economy
few people care to practice 
do you know
the words of machado 
i know his name 
lovely poet 
machado was
a schoolteacher   
and he married a young 
beautiful girl 
and he loved her very much 
and she died 
and then he became
a great poet 
i m not going to
become a great poet 
no  perhaps not  but even
if you were to do so   
it would not help you 
machado would have
traded every word 
every poem 
every verse he ever wrote   
for one more hour
with his beloved 
and that is because
when it comes to grief   
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply 
because grief
transcends value 
a man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart   
and yet  you cannot buy
anything with grief 
because grief is worthless 
why are you telling me this 
because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you re in 
do you love your wife so much 
so completely   
that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel 
and i don t mean dying 
because dying is easy 
yes  yes  damn you 
well  that is good
to hear  counselor 
what are you saying 
are you saying
this is a possibility 
no 
it s impossible 
you said i was that man   
at that crossing 
yes 
at the understanding   
that life is not
going to take you back 
you are the world you have created 
and when you cease to exist   
this world that you have created
will also cease to exist 
but for those with the
understanding that
they re living the last
days of the world   
death acquires
a different meaning 
the extinction of all reality   
is a concept no resignation
can encompass 
and yet  in that despair 
which is transcendent 
you will find the ancient
understanding
that the philosopher s stone
will always be found despised
and buried in the mud 
this may seem a small thing
in the face of annihilation
until annihilation occurs 
and then  all the grand designs
and all the grand plans   
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are 
and now  counselor 
i have to go  because i
have to make other calls 
if i have time  i think
i ll take a small nap 
welcome to london heathrow 
terminal 5

no harm 
that s a lovely thought 
a magical thought 
good night 
it s very dangerous out there 
in the street 
i know 
if they hear somebody in the
street  they shoot them 
then they turn on the light
to see who is dead 
why do they do that 
to make a joke 
to show that death doesn t care 
that death has no meaning 
do you believe that 
no 
of course not 
all my family is dead 
i m the one who
has no meaning 
please hang up
and try again 
if you need help  hang up
and dial your operator 
so  you got the password 
five digits 
who s rowena

i don t see what good this will
do unless you have the computer 
you and i are square 
so  are you planning
to see him again 
what would be the point 
he ll be broke 
smart girl 
or is it worse than that 
i don t want to get mixed up
in something heavy 
you already are 
how would you know he won t
come looking for you 
but he won t  will he 
no 
he won t 
jesus 
take the money 
i don t want it

momento 
hey 
oh  god 
no 
good evening 
lovely to see you  madame 
thank you 
good evening  sir 
follow me 
bon appã tit 
it s good to see you 
you  as well 
how s marisa 
she s fine 
you should come and see us 
i know 
we should talk 
yes  of course 
we need to move the money
as soon as possible 
speaking as your banker 
are you
returning to the states 
no  and i certainly
can t go to mexico 
i m thinking hong kong 
really 
mmm  you don t
speak the language 
i m a quick study 
well  i suppose you could simply
buy into the market there 
yes  it s not a problem 
cash 
the easiest way to move cash
is in diamonds 
you can hold  20 million
in the palm of your hand 
well  i suppose there s no problem
selling diamonds in china 
you can sell diamonds on mars 
you need to get out  michael 
if anything went wrong 
your name might come up 
that s right 
you re not really leaving
me a choice  are you 
you ll thank me 
and the cats 
silvia died  and raoul is
alive and well in arizona 
i ll miss him 
i miss watching him
out on the high desert
bringing down jackrabbits
at 70 miles an hour 
i never tired of that 
to see quarry 
killed with elegance   
it s just    moving to me 
is it sexual 
yes  of course  a thing
like that is always sexual 
the hunter has grace 
beauty   
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else 
you can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do 
and what they do is kill 
we  of course 
are another matter 
it is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin 
perhaps you won t agree   
but nothing is
crueler than a coward 
and the slaughter to come   
is probably
beyond our imagining
