malcolm adekanbi is a geek 
malcolm lives with his single mother
and has only one memory of his father 
malcolm lives
in inglewood  california 
in the darby dixon neighborhood
referred to as the bottoms 
give me your bike  nigga 
malcolm s friends 
jib and diggy  are also geeks 
yo 
shit 
all i want to do is a zoom  zoom  zoom
and the boom  boom 
word 
malcolm  jib and diggy   
are all deeply obsessed
with  90s hip hop culture 
submerging themselves
in the music 
watching old yo  mtv raps
episodes for fashion tips   
and using the slang 
huh 
bro  that shit was whack 
  what 
  they were biting brand nubian 
that s not even possible 
jackpot  niggas 
gushy  gushy 
mmm 
oh  did i mention
that diggy was a lesbian 
although from the way she dresses 
you might not have noticed she s a girl 
save her  lord 
yo  hallelujah  hallelujah 
every sunday  her grandmother asks
the church to lay their hands on her   
in order to
pray away the gay 
praise the lord 
  so  did it work 
  you know 
i was watching justin bieber
the other night and i got a little moist 
yeah 
so maybe 
  that s just because he s a little ho 
  that s true 
he s a very pretty nigga 
yes  he is 
what s up  boss 
for most geeks  a bad day
might be being the butt of jokes in class 
the occasional food prank and the worst   
being beat up by a jock 
but when you live
in the bottoms 
a bad day might be
accidentally getting killed 
like wytony johnson  who got
shot buying a pastrami cheeseburger   
from jimmy s burger
on centinela 
hey  it s the rollin  60s 
dumb ass niggas 
the real tragedy is   
that he was seconds away
from defeating ganon 
he had a hell
of a comic book collection 
jib has been trying to talk
wytony s mom into giving them to him   
for the past two weeks 
malcolm  jib and diggy don t play
sports and they aren t in a gang 
they re always getting ridiculed by their
peers because they re into white shit   
like skateboards  manga comics 
donald glover   
and for listening to white shit like
trash talk  tv on the radio   
and for doing white shit like getting
good grades and applying to college 
malcolm  jib and diggy
used to be in the school marching band 
but quit in protest after refusing
to play the harlem shake 
they arranged to use
the music room during lunch   
for their recently formed
punk band  awreeoh 
one  two

the process seriously 
i m    i m taking it seriously  mr  bailey 
i promise 
i m talking about
something that i love 
i mean  it s well reasoned 
supported with historical data 
it shows creativity 
critical thinking 
if neil degrasse tyson was writing about
ice cube  this is what it would look like 
i suggest you go
in a different direction 
write something personal
about you 
your family  your life 
i mean  i    i could write
about the typical   
 i m from a poor 
crime filled neighborhood 
raised by a single mother 
don t know my dad  blah blah 
it s cliché 
this here  this   
this is   
this is creative 
this shows that i m different 
this is the kind of essay
that harvard wants from their students

honest with you

you go to high school
in inglewood 
to the admissions committee 
your straight a s  they don t mean shit 
if you re really serious about this exercise
and you re not just wasting my time 
or yours

your personal statement 
your sat scores 
your recommendations   
and most importantly
your alumni interview tomorrow 
  are you ready

harvard  really 
i m sorry  they don t all
go on to be president 
on this day 
their usual route home
is blocked by a blood gathering 
they were shooting a video
for their youtube channel 
well  where do you want to go 
some nigga really needs to invent an app
like waze to avoid all these hood traps 
the only way to get home
is down 104th street 
but that s where
the dope dealers are   
who  for sport  routinely
try to steal their bikes 
  go 
  hey  little nigga

mr  jacoby s just wrapping up a staff meeting 
he ll be a few minutes 
dom 
is that    is that dom 
oh  shit 
austin jacoby 
nice to meet you 
malcolm 
take a seat 
come on  relax 
so  uh   
malcolm adekanbi 
did i pronounce that right 
yeah  great 
you re nigerian 
my dad  um   
he    he went back to nigeria
before i was born 
sorry to hear that 
i know what it s like
to grow up without a father 
that s why i spend a lot of time and
a lot of money with the boys club 
those  um   
those kids   
a are they your kids 
yes  they are 
not too much older than you 
so you know dominique 
excuse me 
you    you probably
know him as dom 
no  sorry 
why do you ask 
dom gave me something   
to deliver to someone 
as crazy as it seems 
i i think
that someone is you 
this dom person   
what did he say that  uh 
i should have to do
with this  uh  delivery 
i don t know 
i just know that he told me
to deliver it to a j   so   
and why did you do it 
  i didn t have a choice 
  oh  come on  malcolm 
come on 
you always have a choice 
you could have done
a lot of things with that package 
you re a smart kid 
i m sure you thought about all of them 
but you chose to make the delivery
for this dom person   
because you thought it was 
what  in your best interest 
so  you should
take responsibility   
for the choice
that you ve made 
now  you know
i m not the person or persons   
for whom this delivery
was intended 
something happened
along the way 
it s like  uh  amazon 
if you order a rick ross
or macklemore cd   
i would not order
a macklemore cd 
that wouldn t happen 
all right  who  then 
casey veggies 
casey veggies 
that s    that s an artist 
yeah 
yeah  okay  all right 
so  you order a casey veggies cd
from amazon  right 
no  you don t order
a casey veggies cd 
you just go online
and you download it 
yeah  okay  all right 
but you are aware
that amazon does ship discs  right 
and if you order that disc
and it does not come in a timely fashion 
you re gonna call them
and say   where s my stuff  
and amazon has to
assume responsibility 
but it s just one cd 
but what if it s 100 orders
and 100 cds don t show up 
or a thousand 
or 10 000 
it s a slippery slope 
slippery slope 
so  amazon has got to assume   
the full cost of the loss 
but most importantly 
they have to deal with the loss
of their reputation 
a reputation that has taken
a long time to build 
you understand what i m saying 
so let s do this 
let s reschedule
this interview   
for a few weeks from now 
give it a little time 
go out there 
make the delivery for which you have
claimed responsibility   
to the appropriate consumers   
so that the suppliers
of this product   
can be whole 
metaphorically speaking 
of course 
if you re able to do this 
it shows me more about you   
than any interview ever could 
and i would then
make it my business   
to make you
a man of harvard 
i want you to get out of
the bottoms just like i did 
i know from growing up there
it s very  very dangerous   
and that your family or your
friends could get killed at any moment   
just by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time 
i d hate for that
to happen to you   
or any
of your family members 
getting on 
looks like you and i
had the same kind of day 
how d the interview go 
okay 
well  sit down 
my shift s almost over 
i ll take you home 
thanks  mom 
the incident took place today
at seven bucks coffee   
apparently the side effects of the
popular club drug mdma  or  molly  
tannehill james was a witness
to this bizarre scene 
so  i m here at the seven bucks 
drinking my vanilla chai latte   
and eating me
some pound cake 
 cause you know niggas
don t eat scones  right 
when all of a sudden
this crazy little naked ho comes up   
and she squatted down right in front of me
and she pissed right there 
i swear to god 
pissed right there
for a long time 
so  now  you tell me how am
i supposed to eat my pound cake   
after witnessing
something like that 
reporting live  karen myetta 
channel 10 news 
up next  a fight over lunch
turns deadly in inglewood 
did he actually say   i ll kill you and your
friends if you don t sell these drugs  
or just you  what 
don t act like you weren t curious too 
not directly 
he was talking about amazon and rick ross
cds not getting to their customers 
niggas don t even buy
cds anymore  dawg 
jib  that s not
the fucking point 
are you gonna go and sell on the corner 
 cause we re a bunch of bitches  man 
speak for yourself  jib 
yes 
i am a bitch ass nigga 
i don t give a fuck 
i own that shit 
who are you trying
to impress  diggy 
we re talking about molly  jib 
not fucking heroin 
all we gotta do
is find the white people 
  go to coachella  lollapalooza 
  yeah  yeah 
we can backpack and hitchhike and sing mumford
and sons songs and all that faux fucking shit 
fuck you  okay 
i m just saying it could work 
yeah  yeah 
why stop there  you know 
why not hit bonnaroo also 
bitcoins 
that s how we do it 
do what 
oh  shit 
there s these sites where you can   
you can sell everything   
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs 
and they use bitcoins
so they can t be traced 
we don t have to
stand on any corner 
dark web  could work 
way better than coachella 
guys  the fbi can track us  the police   
no  they can t 
  not if you use a tor browser 
  what the fuck is that 
  onion routing 
  layered encryptions 
it s like a game of whac a mole with
thousands of computers   
what the fuck
is a whac a mole 
look  these dark web sites
run off these secret ip addresses 
like lulzsec level shady 
we need to find one somehow

william ian sherwood iii 
musician  scholar  rake  entrepreneur 
conspiracy theorist 
malcolm  jib and diggy met william
at band camp three years ago 
yo  if you niggas need some weed  i got you 
good shit  fair prices 
william assured them that
he used the word  nigga    
only as a term of endearment   
as explained by q tip
in the classic song   sucka nigga  
that s your room right there 
after that 
they all hit it off 
though he never used that word
in front of them again 
the mission at band camp was to
give kids from different backgrounds   
a chance to exchange music and
experiences unique to their cultures 
w w wait  okay  so
you re saying white girls will suck dick   
yet still claim they re virgins 
yeah  man  i m serious 
really 
dude  check it  i ve been getting
head since i was  like  12  all right 
i ve been hitting hos in the ass
since i was  like  14 
it s true  man 
these chicks will let you fill any hole 
except the pussy 
with a dick  no problem 
so  technically 
you re still a virgin too 
  yeah 
  right 
but here s something
to wrap your brain around  man 
i ve never had intercourse
with a pussy 
mm hmm 
only asshole and oral  okay 
so the question isn t 
 am i technically a virgin  
what the question could be is   
 am i technically    gay  
oh  that s deep  nigga 
yeah  i don t know 
william went to   
prep school 
where he smoked a pound of weed a week 
skipped classes   
and had a 1 9 gpa 
yet got a perfect score
on his sat 
he was accepted to his father s
alma mater under academic probation 
which meant he had to maintain
a 3 0 grade point average 
so  william hacked into
the    database 
erasing all grades
from the entire freshman class 
small batch  craft brewed 
40 ounce malt liquor 
that same year  he achieved
his dream of having sex with a black girl 
you ever fucked on molly before 
no 
hey  nah  it s good  man 
it s like    it s like
being fucked by god 
everybody is going to black market
reloaded and a bunch of smaller sites 
but  dude  that shit
is getting mad sketchy now 
if you nigga   
if you guys want drugs 
i can get you good shit
way less expensive than online

a store to sell 
wha    nah  really  dude

i would insert that word 
it s nothing personal 
you re still my nigga 
but i gotta slap the shit
out of you based on principle 
  let s get back to what s goin  on 
  no  no  no  wait  principle 
okay  you want to talk principle 
what about jib here  man 
this dude isn t
african american 
he s like fucking latino
or moroccan or some shit 
where s this conversation going 
technically  he shouldn t
be able to say the word 
  why can he use it

dom called from jail
the other day 
he asked about you

all this crying on my shoulder 
bullshit 
you re supposed
to put your feminine wiles on me   
and find out
about the fucking dope

that you were different   
than these other niggas

 feminine wiles  
good morning 
today you re going to take the sat 
the sat is your chance to show

you will have 25 minutes
to work on section one 
yo  what the fuck was that 
what do you mean 
you don t know 
drug search  dawg 
they do it randomly 
like  every month or so 
it s all for show  i mean 
it s not like somebody is stupid enough   
to put some shit
in their locker 
can i go to the bathroom 
yes  but you will not
be given more time 
man 
come on  man 
what in the hell

here it is 
the set ain t over 
come on  y all 
let s get busy 
come on  say  yeah  
say  hell yeah  
  ain t it funky 
  i m not doing this shit no more 
bro  i can fix this shit 
i can fix this shit 
the bag is almost done 
the shit is almost gone 
i mean  i can t sell this shit no more 
we almost just got fucking caught 
look  i don t want to go to jail 
i want to go to fucking college 
i want to get a good job 
i want to help my mom 
dig 
that s cool 
it s my fault 
my weight to carry 
yo  that s bullshit 
we all wanted to go to dom s party 
especially you  jib 
it s our weight to carry too 
we ve got your back
to the end  right 
right 
fuck 
ooh 
  there it is 
  gracias 
all right  so  when we get
the bitcoins  then what 
i need cash 
well  you would have to
do a currency exchange   
to get the us dollar equivalent 
but  i mean   
that kind of defeats the purpose of
a non fiat currency  right 
okay  see  i don t give a fuck about
all that aaron swartz   
occupy wall street shit 
okay  well  you d have to link your
bitcoin account to a bank account 
and then there s
this infinitesimally small chance   
that it could be traced 
i mean  the feds would have to
know exactly what they re looking for 
it s not something
they could just stumble upon randomly 
basically  i would just have to make
a stupid ass mistake for them to trace it 
and do i look like the type of nigga that
makes stupid ass mistakes 
um   
so  you want me
to set up that exchange 
i m    i m good 
i ll do it 
  um   
  huh 
what if i want
zero chances of trace 
well   
if you want zero trace 
you gotta go
black market  homey 
yeah  you got to put
the bitcoins on a drive   
and make
a hand to hand exchange 
you get cash
minus the transaction fee 
if you really want to go that route   
and i really don t suggest it   
i know a dude
in the garment district 
ask for fidel 
if you pass his test 
he ll help you 
if you don t   
well  just pass his test 
one of these alligator bags
was made here 
one is from the store 
which one is which 
the right one 
i mean   cause it s   
mm hmm 
poofier 
they both look the same 
the reality is   
i sell 90  of my stuff
to white hos 
most are rich enough
to afford retail 
why do you think that is 
i don t know 
they know  they know
the only difference   
between these two bags   
is the person rocking them 
so  when they rock  em 
people are gonna assume
it s real 
and the flip of that is   
it doesn t matter if you had the receipt
from barneys sewn into the bag 
people gonna assume it s fake 
only you know the truth 
so  what are you  man

hold on  hold on 
hey  hold on

i don t even want
that shit  blood 
let s go  nigga 
all right  come on 
we out  we out  we out 
it s okay 
it s okay 
come on 
let s go 
that s 10  
consider it a proffer 
  the rest is in a bitcoin account 
  bitcoin 
it s an untraceable
internet currency 
there are web sites
that sell a lot of things   
that people would
get in trouble for selling 
they use bitcoins 
kind of like amazon 
so you sold on the internet 
no 
no  you did 
excuse me 
you set up a store
on black market reloaded 
very successful 
very successful 
i mean  you moved
your entire inventory 
see  the market s
been pretty volatile 
but as of right now 
you have  97 267 and 31 cents   
in your bitcoin
exchange account 
10 000 in cash 
now  as long as your bitcoins stay
in the exchange account 
they re safe  untraceable 
now  if you were to exchange
the bitcoins into dollars   
and transfer that money into your
jacoby check cashing corporate account 
there would be a really  really
small chance of it getting traced   
by the dea or fbi 
i mean  that would only happen if
you were idiotically sloppy   
while setting up
the bitcoin exchange account 
so you want me
to set up that exchange 
i m good  i ll do it 
i mean  that    i mean 
it would almost have to be   
intentional 
and why should i believe
any of this  malcolm 
is your jacoby aps
shipping account number   
fx4578 
california regional
bank number 267856783 
federal tax id 95   
hey  you really should just
upgrade your firewall  you know 
i actually know a guy  he s kind of
familiar with your system already 
you re all out
of toilet paper  hon 
courtside  okay  courtside 
gotta have it  no  come on 
now  what if i report
to the authorities   
that my securities
have been breached   
and my identity has been stolen 
as i ve just learned 
it doesn t matter
if this bag is real or fake 
because of where i come from 
everybody s going to assume it s fake 
so  since you and i come
from the same place 
what is the dea going
to assume about you 
and because you and i
are from the same place  malcolm 
you should know what a person
like me can do to a person like you 
yeah 
but that s not what
a harvard man would do 
nah  see  a man of harvard
is smart enough to see   
that would set off
a chain of events   
that would inevitably come back
and destroy him   
and everything he s built 
that would be a shame 
so  i think you should take this
opportunity before you very seriously 
do everything in your power
to ensure that i become a man of harvard   
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head 
can you dig it 
malcolm 
you forgot your bag 
it s fake 
malcolm 
you re pretty damn arrogant 
you think you re gonna get into harvard 
who do you think you are 
let me tell you
about two students 
student  a  is a straight a student
who lives in the suburbs of los angeles 
he plays in a punk band
with his best friends 
he loves to skateboard
and ride on his bmx bike 
his favorite tv show is game of thrones
and his favorite band is the thermals 
he s a  90s hip hop geek 
student  b  goes
to an underfunded school   
where teachers who would
rather not be there   
teach kids
who really don t care 
he lives with a single mother 
doesn t know his father and has sold dope 
now close your eyes 
picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see 
be honest 
no one s going to judge you 
now open your eyes 
so  am i student  a 
or student  b  
am i a geek or a menace 
for most of my life  i ve been caught in
between who i really am   
and how i m perceived 
in between categories
and definition 
i don t fit in 
and i used to think that
that was a curse  but   
now i m slowly
starting to see   
maybe it s a blessing 
see  when you don t fit in 
you re forced to see the world from
many different angles and points of view 
you gain knowledge  life lessons
from disparate people and places 
and those lessons 
for better or worse  have shaped me 
so  who am i 
allow me to reintroduce myself 
my name is malcolm adekanbi 
i m a straight a student
with nearly perfect sat scores 
i taught myself
how to play guitar and read music 
i have stellar recommendations
and diverse extracurricular activities 
i am a google science fair
participant 
and in three weeks  i helped make
over  100 000 for an online business 
so  why do i want
to attend harvard 
if i was white  would you even have to
ask me that question 
nice haircut 
i like it 
i m    i m sorry   
for all the stuff that i said 
there was a lot going on
at the time 
and    that wasn t me 
yeah  it was 
you might have all
these other folks fooled  but not me 
you re   
complicated 
anyway  i just came by
to say thank you 
thank you 
you    you passed 
mm hmm 
you passed 
you were supposed to
go to prom with me 
no 
i told you i wasn t mad
about missing prom
