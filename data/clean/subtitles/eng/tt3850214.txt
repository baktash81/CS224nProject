dope right
malcolm adekanbi is a geek
malcolm lives with his single mother
and has only one memory of his father
malcolm lives
in inglewood california
in the darbydixon neighborhood
referred to as the bottoms
give me your bike nigga
malcolms friends
jib and diggy are also geeks
yo
shit
all i want to do is a zoom zoom zoom
and the boom boom
word
malcolm jib and diggy
are all deeply obsessed
with 90s hiphop culture
submerging themselves
in the music
watching old yo mtv raps
episodes for fashion tips
and using the slang
huh
bro that shit was whack
what
they were biting brand nubian
thats not even possible
jackpot niggas
gushy gushy
mmm
oh did i mention
that diggy was a lesbian
although from the way she dresses
you might not have noticed shes a girl
save her lord
yo hallelujah hallelujah
every sunday her grandmother asks
the church to lay their hands on her
in order to
pray away the gay
praise the lord
so did it work
you know
i was watching justin bieber
the other night and i got a little moist
yeah
so maybe
thats just because hes a little ho
thats true
hes a very pretty nigga
yes he is
whats up boss
for most geeks a bad day
might be being the butt of jokes in class
the occasional food prank and the worst
being beat up by a jock
but when you live
in the bottoms
a bad day might be
accidentally getting killed
like wytony johnson who got
shot buying a pastrami cheeseburger
from jimmys burger
on centinela
hey its the rollin 60s
dumbass niggas
the real tragedy is
that he was seconds away
from defeating ganon
he had a hell
of a comic book collection
jib has been trying to talk
wytonys mom into giving them to him
for the past two weeks
malcolm jib and diggy dont play
sports and they arent in a gang
theyre always getting ridiculed by their
peers because theyre into white shit
like skateboards manga comics
donald glover
and for listening to white shit like
trash talk tv on the radio
and for doing white shit like getting
good grades and applying to college
malcolm jib and diggy
used to be in the school marching band
but quit in protest after refusing
to play the harlem shake
they arranged to use
the music room during lunch
for their recently formed
punk band awreeoh
one two
one two three four

malcolm when i see stuff
like this personal essay
i think youre not taking
the process seriously
im im taking it seriously mr bailey
i promise
im talking about
something that i love
i mean its wellreasoned
supported with historical data
it shows creativity
critical thinking
if neil degrasse tyson was writing about
ice cube this is what it would look like
i suggest you go
in a different direction
write something personal
about you
your family your life
i mean i i could write
about the typical
im from a poor
crimefilled neighborhood
raised by a single mother
dont know my dad blahblah
its clich√©
this here this
this is
this is creative
this shows that im different
this is the kind of essay
that harvard wants from their students
malcolm im gonna be
honest with you
youre pretty damn arrogant
you think youre gonna get into harvard
who do you think
you are hmm
you go to high school
in inglewood
to the admissions committee
your straight as they dont mean shit
if youre really serious about this exercise
and youre not just wasting my time
or yours
then its gonna be about
your personal statement
your sat scores
your recommendations
and most importantly
your alumni interview tomorrow
are you ready
im ready
youd better be
i just found out youre interviewing
with austin jacoby
hes from inglewood too so hell be
able to relate to your circumstances
jacoby check cashing
harvard really
im sorry they dont all
go on to be president
on this day
their usual route home
is blocked by a blood gathering
they were shooting a video
for their youtube channel
well where do you want to go
some nigga really needs to invent an app
like waze to avoid all these hood traps
the only way to get home
is down 104th street
but thats where
the dope dealers are
who for sport routinely
try to steal their bikes
go
hey little nigga

come here
a daily navigation between
bad and worse choices
come here little nigga

snoop biggie wutang

wasnt great but oh shit

i just know that he told me
to deliver it to aj so
and why did you do it
i didnt have a choice
oh come on malcolm
come on
you always have a choice
you could have done
a lot of things with that package
youre a smart kid
im sure you thought about all of them
but you chose to make the delivery
for this dom person
because you thought it was
what in your best interest
so you should
take responsibility
for the choice
that youve made
now you know
im not the person or persons
for whom this delivery
was intended
something happened
along the way
its like uh amazon
if you order a rick ross
or macklemore cd
i would not order
a macklemore cd
that wouldnt happen
all right who then
casey veggies
casey veggies
thats thats an artist
yeah
yeah okay all right
so you order a casey veggies cd
from amazon right
no you dont order
a casey veggies cd
you just go online
and you download it
yeah okay all right
but you are aware
that amazon does ship discs right
and if you order that disc
and it does not come in a timely fashion
youre gonna call them
and say wheres my stuff
and amazon has to
assume responsibility
but its just one cd
but what if its 100 orders
and 100 cds dont show up
or a thousand
or 10000
its a slippery slope
slippery slope
so amazon has got to assume
the full cost of the loss
but most importantly
they have to deal with the loss
of their reputation
a reputation that has taken
a long time to build
you understand what im saying
so lets do this
lets reschedule
this interview
for a few weeks from now
give it a little time
go out there
make the delivery for which you have
claimed responsibility
to the appropriate consumers
so that the suppliers
of this product
can be whole
metaphorically speaking
of course
if youre able to do this
it shows me more about you
than any interview ever could
and i would then
make it my business
to make you
a man of harvard
i want you to get out of
the bottoms just like i did
i know from growing up there
its very very dangerous
and that your family or your
friends could get killed at any moment
just by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time
id hate for that
to happen to you
or any
of your family members
getting on
looks like you and i
had the same kind of day
howd the interview go
okay
well sit down
my shifts almost over
ill take you home
thanks mom
the incident took place today
at seven bucks coffee
apparently the side effects of the
popular club drug mdma or molly
tannehill james was a witness
to this bizarre scene
so im here at the seven bucks
drinking my vanilla chai latte
and eating me
some pound cake
cause you know niggas
dont eat scones right
when all of a sudden
this crazy little naked ho comes up
and she squatted down right in front of me
and she pissed right there
i swear to god
pissed right there
for a long time
so now you tell me how am
i supposed to eat my pound cake
after witnessing
something like that
reporting live karen myetta
channel 10 news
up next a fight over lunch
turns deadly in inglewood
did he actually say ill kill you and your
friends if you dont sell these drugs
or just you what
dont act like you werent curious too
not directly
he was talking about amazon and rick ross
cds not getting to their customers
niggas dont even buy
cds anymore dawg
jib thats not
the fucking point
are you gonna go and sell on the corner
cause were a bunch of bitches man
speak for yourself jib
yes
i am a bitchass nigga
i dont give a fuck
i own that shit
who are you trying
to impress diggy
were talking about molly jib
not fucking heroin
all we gotta do
is find the white people
go to coachella lollapalooza
yeah yeah
we can backpack and hitchhike and sing mumford
and sons songs and all that faux fucking shit
fuck you okay
im just saying it could work
yeah yeah
why stop there you know
why not hit bonnaroo also
bitcoins
thats how we do it
do what
oh shit
theres these sites where you can
you can sell everything
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs
and they use bitcoins
so they cant be traced
we dont have to
stand on any corner
dark web could work
way better than coachella
guys the fbi can track us the police
no they cant
not if you use a tor browser
what the fuck is that
onion routing
layered encryptions
its like a game of whacamole with
thousands of computers
what the fuck
is a whacamole
look these dark web sites
run off these secret ip addresses
like lulzseclevel shady
we need to find one somehow

william ian sherwood iii
musician scholar rake entrepreneur
conspiracy theorist
malcolm jib and diggy met william
at band camp three years ago
yo if you niggas need some weed i got you
good shit fair prices
william assured them that
he used the word nigga
only as a term of endearment
as explained by qtip
in the classic song sucka nigga
thats your room right there
after that
they all hit it off
though he never used that word
in front of them again
the mission at band camp was to
give kids from different backgrounds
a chance to exchange music and
experiences unique to their cultures
wwwait okay so
youre saying white girls will suck dick
yet still claim theyre virgins
yeah man im serious
really

youre still a virgin too
yeah

but heres something
to wrap your brain around man
ive never had intercourse
with a pussy
mmhmm

am i technically a virgin
what the question could be is

william went to
prep school
where he smoked a pound of weed a week
skipped classes
and had a 19 gpa
yet got a perfect score
on his sat
he was accepted to his fathers
alma mater under academic probation
which meant he had to maintain
a 30 grade point average

the database
erasing all grades

smallbatch craftbrewed
40ounce malt liquor

his dream of having sex with a black girl

yo what the fuck was that
what do you mean
you dont know
drug search dawg
they do it randomly
like every month or so
its all for show i mean
its not like somebody is stupid enough
to put some shit
in their locker
can i go to the bathroom
yes but you will not
be given more time
man
come on man
what in the hell
are you doing
um sats
sats
i had to use the restroom

you know
thank you
good luck little man

here it is
the set aint over
come on yall
lets get busy
come on say yeah

aint it funky
im not doing this shit no more
bro i can fix this shit
i can fix this shit
the bag is almost done
the shit is almost gone
i mean i cant sell this shit no more
we almost just got fucking caught
look i dont want to go to jail
i want to go to fucking college
i want to get a good job
i want to help my mom
dig
thats cool
its my fault
my weight to carry
yo thats bullshit
we all wanted to go to doms party
especially you jib
its our weight to carry too
weve got your back
to the end right
right
fuck
ooh
there it is
gracias
all right so when we get
the bitcoins then what
i need cash
well you would have to
do a currency exchange
to get the us dollar equivalent
but i mean
that kind of defeats the purpose of
a nonfiat currency right
okay see i dont give a fuck about
all that aaron swartz
occupy wall street shit
okay well youd have to link your
bitcoin account to a bank account
and then theres
this infinitesimally small chance
that it could be traced
i mean the feds would have to
know exactly what theyre looking for
its not something
they could just stumble upon randomly
basically i would just have to make
a stupidass mistake for them to trace it
and do i look like the type of nigga that
makes stupidass mistakes
um
so you want me
to set up that exchange
im im good
ill do it
um
huh
what if i want
zero chances of trace
well
if you want zero trace
you gotta go
black market homey
yeah you got to put
the bitcoins on a drive
and make
a handtohand exchange
you get cash
minus the transaction fee
if you really want to go that route
and i really dont suggest it
i know a dude
in the garment district
ask for fidel
if you pass his test
hell help you
if you dont
well just pass his test
one of these alligator bags
was made here
one is from the store
which one is which
the right one
i mean cause its
mmhmm
poofier
they both look the same
the reality is
i sell 90 of my stuff
to white hos
most are rich enough
to afford retail
why do you think that is
i dont know
they know they know
the only difference
between these two bags
is the person rocking them
so when they rock em
people are gonna assume
its real
and the flip of that is
it doesnt matter if you had the receipt
from barneys sewn into the bag
people gonna assume its fake
only you know the truth
so what are you man
are you a real
are you a fake
thats what i need to find out
im just malcolm
just malcolm
who the fuck is malcolm
show me i want you to hit me
as hard as you can
hey
dont look at them
this is between you and me
ima give you five seconds
you can either man up
or run out like the little bitch you is
one
malcolm lets just go
listen to your friends boy
two
you cant be serious
im more than serious motherfucker
three
i need that money
you aint gettin shit
four
yeah you see
your pussy friends leaving
theyre running
like some little bitches
run pussy
five five five
hit me man
five motherfuck
oh man you
drive
where
give me the drive
shit
come here man
now i know who you are
a man that
does not give a fuck
hey blood
dont you owe me another shoe nigga
shit
get on the ground
bitchass nigga
get the fuck off me
malcolm
get off us malcolm
stay the fuck down nigga
malcolm
bitch nigga yeah
yeah
jib get the fucking bag
come on
oh shit
hold on hold on
hey hold on
give me the bag
please
just give me the bag
i dont even want
that shit blood
lets go nigga
all right come on
we out we out we out
its okay
its okay
come on
lets go
thats 10
consider it a proffer
the rest is in a bitcoin account
bitcoin
its an untraceable
internet currency
there are web sites
that sell a lot of things
that people would
get in trouble for selling
they use bitcoins
kind of like amazon
so you sold on the internet
no
no you did
excuse me
you set up a store
on black market reloaded
very successful
very successful
i mean you moved
your entire inventory
see the markets
been pretty volatile
but as of right now
you have 97267 and 31 cents
in your bitcoin
exchange account
10000 in cash
now as long as your bitcoins stay
in the exchange account
theyre safe untraceable
now if you were to exchange
the bitcoins into dollars
and transfer that money into your
jacoby check cashing corporate account
there would be a really really
small chance of it getting traced
by the dea or fbi
i mean that would only happen if
you were idiotically sloppy
while setting up
the bitcoin exchange account
so you want me
to set up that exchange
im good ill do it
i mean that i mean
it would almost have to be
intentional
and why should i believe
any of this malcolm
is your jacoby aps
shipping account number
fx4578
california regional
bank number 267856783
federal tax id 95
hey you really should just
upgrade your firewall you know
i actually know a guy hes kind of
familiar with your system already
youre all out
of toilet paper hon
courtside okay courtside
gotta have it no come on
now what if i report
to the authorities
that my securities
have been breached
and my identity has been stolen
as ive just learned
it doesnt matter
if this bag is real or fake
because of where i come from
everybodys going to assume its fake
so since you and i come
from the same place
what is the dea going
to assume about you
and because you and i
are from the same place malcolm
you should know what a person
like me can do to a person like you
yeah
but thats not what
a harvard man would do
nah see a man of harvard
is smart enough to see
that would set off
a chain of events
that would inevitably come back
and destroy him
and everything hes built
that would be a shame
so i think you should take this
opportunity before you very seriously
do everything in your power
to ensure that i become a man of harvard
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head
can you dig it
malcolm
you forgot your bag
its fake
malcolm
youre pretty damn arrogant
you think youre gonna get into harvard
who do you think you are
let me tell you
about two students
student a is a straighta student
who lives in the suburbs of los angeles
he plays in a punk band
with his best friends
he loves to skateboard
and ride on his bmx bike
his favorite tv show is game of thrones
and his favorite band is the thermals
hes a 90s hiphop geek
student b goes
to an underfunded school
where teachers who would
rather not be there
teach kids
who really dont care
he lives with a single mother
doesnt know his father and has sold dope
now close your eyes
picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see
be honest
no ones going to judge you
now open your eyes
so am i student a
or student b
am i a geek or a menace
for most of my life ive been caught in
between who i really am
and how im perceived
in between categories
and definition
i dont fit in
and i used to think that
that was a curse but
now im slowly
starting to see
maybe its a blessing
see when you dont fit in
youre forced to see the world from
many different angles and points of view
you gain knowledge life lessons
from disparate people and places
and those lessons
for better or worse have shaped me
so who am i
allow me to reintroduce myself
my name is malcolm adekanbi
im a straighta student
with nearly perfect sat scores
i taught myself
how to play guitar and read music
i have stellar recommendations
and diverse extracurricular activities
i am a google science fair
participant
and in three weeks i helped make
over 100000 for an online business
so why do i want
to attend harvard
if i was white would you even have to
ask me that question
nice haircut
i like it
im im sorry
for all the stuff that i said
there was a lot going on
at the time
and that wasnt me
yeah it was
you might have all
these other folks fooled but not me
youre
complicated
anyway i just came by
to say thank you
thank you
you you passed
mmhmm
you passed
you were supposed to
go to prom with me
no
i told you i wasnt mad
about missing prom
