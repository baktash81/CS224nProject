bella dont

im sorry i didnt realize
thered be people this far from the trails
i have to get outta here
okay i can help you
or not
well im amazed
you ran away from human blood midhunt
even mature vampires
have problems with that
youre still here
so are you
i didnt expect you to seem so
you
except for the creepy eyes
i would keep my distance for now
its safer for the baby
to see how you do with me first
since when do you care about renesmee
all right
take a whiff
well i can see
what everyones been talking about
jake you really do stink
you guys
really look great together
want to come meet our daughter
welcome to the family
you look amazing bella
someones been waiting to meet you
rose
beautiful
what was that
she showed you
the first memory she has of you
showed me how
how do i hear thoughts
how does alice see the future
shes gifted
ive only been out for two days
her growth rate is unprecedented
all right thats enough
experimenting for one day
jacob
shes doing great
yeah lets not push it though
whats your problem
do tell her jacob
this should be good
hold on a second
bella
look
its a wolf thing
whats a wolf thing
you know we have no control over it
we cant choose who it happens with
and it doesnt mean
what you think bella i promise
take renesmee out of the room
edward dont touch me right now
i dont want to hurt you
you imprinted on my daughter
it wasnt my choice
shes a baby
its not like that
you think edward would
let me live if it was
im still debating it
ive held her once
one time jacob
and already you think that
you have some moronic
wolfy claim on her
shes mine
its fine leah
youre gonna stay away from her
you know i cant do that
stop her edward
he said its fine
shes amazing right
do you remember how much
you wanted to be around me 3 days ago
thats gone now right
long gone
because it was her
from the beginning it was
nessie who wanted me there
nessie
you nicknamed my daughter
after the loch ness monster
seth are you okay
seth im sorry
hell be all right
bella
you know me better than anyone
all i want is for ness
renesmee to be safe happy
look
nothing ever made sense before
you me any of it
and now i understand why
this was the reason
finally
my turn
where does she sleep
in my arms or edwards or esmes
happy birthday
i stopped aging three days ago
well were celebrating anyway
so suck it up
i still hate surprises
that hasnt changed
youll love this one
welcome home
we thought you guys
might like a place of your own
what do you think
i think its perfect
go inside
have fun
this will be renesmees room
closet
alice stocked it for you
clearly
this is our room
vampires dont sleep
its not intended for sleep
you really were holding back before
im never gonna get enough of this
we dont get tired
we dont have to rest
or catch our breath or eat
i mean
i mean
how are we gonna stop
rosalie and emmett were so bad
it took a solid decade
before we could stand to be
within five miles of them
i think we might be worse
definitely worse
done already
wheres renesmee
blondie stole her
break a lot of stuff
emmett
no
is that charlie
hes been calling twice a day
hes in pretty rough shape
eventually well have to tell him
you didnt make it
he needs to mourn bella
okay well do it tomorrow
im gonna miss this place
well come back we always do
wait
nobody said anything about leaving
once people believe bellas dead
we cant risk anyone seeing her
so you just disappear
jacob we dont have another choice
hey
you heard anything
charlie
bella is
no shes not
no no no i mean shes fine
shes back home and
shes feeling better
why didnt you say so thats great
wait
theres something you need to see first
i need to see bella
look
in order for bella to
get better she had to
change
what do you mean change
here goes nothing
what the hell are you doing
you dont live in the
world you think you do
jacob put your clothes on
now this may seem strange
really strange but
stranger things happen every day
trust me
holy shit
look i solved a problem
you were leaving
what did you expect me to do
you dont realize
the danger youve put him in
the volturi will kill anyone
who knows about us
no i didnt tell him about you just me
i only said you were different
and that we have a niece who we adopted
i mean seriously jake
hes not just gonna let that go
did you consider
the physical pain hell put bella through
itll be like sticking
a white hot branding iron down her throat
and thats assuming
she can control her thirst
look charlies been in hell
and i know youll be
much happier with him in your life
jacob dont try and pretend youre
doing this for anyone but yourself
sorry you feel that way
because hell be here in 10 minutes
what
these will irritate your eyes at first
the main thing is not to move too fast
try taking a seat crossing your legs
maybe a tad slower
and blink at least three times a minute
good
for a cartoon character
hold your breath it will
help with the thirst
just dont forget to move your shoulders
so it looks like youre breathing
and dont sit so straight
humans dont do that
okay i got it
move around blink slouch
good luck
hello charlie
wheres bella
bella
hi dad
are you okay
never better
healthy as a horse
you dont turn into an animal too do you
she wishes she was that awesome
lets give them some privacy
jake said that this
this was necessary
what does that mean
i really think it would be better
i wanna know what happened to you
i cant tell you
i think i deserve an explanation
you do
but if you really need
one i cant stay here
oh come on no
no more going away
dad youre just gonna have to trust
that for whatever reason
im all right
im more than all right
can you live with that
can i live with that
well i dont know bella
i mean i just watched a kid
ive known his entire life
turn into a very large dog
my daughter looks like my daughter
but doesnt
can you please just believe that ill
tell you anything that you need to know
and i dont need to know this
no
really you dont
well
not gonna lose you again
i cant
then you wont
i promise
i missed you bells
so much
i missed you dad
charlie
this is renesmee
your niece
our daughter
right
the adoption
reneesemee
shes got your eyes bella
need to know i guess
well clone bella
never seen a newborn
show that kind of restraint
im not sure she is a newborn
shes so tame
emmett dont antagonize her
shes the strongest one in the house
please
dont hurt yourself emmett
all right on 3
z
three
did you see that
thank you
my time as a human was over
but i never felt more alive
i was born to be a vampire
i was born to be a vampire
everything was falling into place
even the volturi
seemed to accept my new status
though theyd want proof eventually
it seemed we had only one enemy left
time
renesmee was growing too fast
we all worried about
how long we would have with her
it just made every moment more precious
look a snowflake
its beautiful
why dont you go get another one
edward thinks that
well find answers in brazil
there are tribes there
that might know something
renesmeei who was that
i think thats our cousin from denali
irina
tanya convinced irina
to come reconcile with us
it looks like she changed her mind
seeing jacob
must have been too much for her
wish i could have just spoken to her
shes family shell come around
what a pleasant surprise
what do you want
i have to report a crime
the cullens
theyve done something terrible
allow me my dear
oh my
what is it alice
the volturi
theyre coming for us
aro caius marcus the guard
and irina
honey come here
why
what did irina see in the woods
we were just walking
ness was catching snowflakes
of course
irina thinks renesmees an immortal child
the immortal children
were very beautiful
so enchanting
to be near them was to love them
but their development was frozen
at the age they were turned
they couldnt be taught or restrained
a single tantrum
could destroy an entire village
humans heard about the devastation
stories spread
the volturi were forced to intervene
since the children
couldnt protect our secret
they had to be destroyed
woman no
no
no
their creators grew very attached
and fought to protect them
longestablished covens were torn apart
countless humans slaughtered
traditions friends
even families lost
no no
mother
no
mother
so the denalis mother
made an immortal child
yes
and she paid the price
well renesmees nothing
like those children
she was born not bitten
she grows every single day
so cant you just explain
that to the volturi
aro has enough proof in lrinas thoughts
so we fight
their offensive
weapons are too powerful
no one can stand against jane
alecs even worse
well then we convince them
theyre coming to kill us not to talk
no youre right
they wont listen to us
but maybe others can convince them
carlisle you have friends
all around the world
i wont ask them to fight
not fight witness
if enough people knew the truth
maybe we could convince
the volturi to listen
we can ask this of our friends
at least we get to go to london again
at least we get to go to london again
we havent been there in a long time
all right lets get this show on the road
alice asked me to give you that
she and jasper
crossed our lands to the ocean last night
carlisle
theyve left us
why
she didnt say
can i see that
gather as many witnesses as you can
before the snow sticks to the ground
thats when theyll come
alices instructions were clear
but the question remained
why would she and jasper leave
at the moment we needed them most
what did they know
our search for witnesses began
with a trip north to our closest relatives
edward is everything all right
why didnt you tell us you were coming
is it irina
have you heard from her
not directly
why is your bride waiting in the car
and why have you brought
a wolf with you
i can smell him from here
my family is in danger i need your help
whats happened
its hard to explain
but i need you to be openminded
can you do that
of course
okay
time to meet some new people
what if they dont like me
theyll love you
they will
once they understand you
they just havent met
anyone like you before
okay
the volturi will come for all of us
you get that thing out of here
shes not what she looks like
this is a crime
stay back
she has blood in her veins
you can feel her warmth
i can feel it
im her biological father
bella is her mother
impossible
its true she was born
while i was still human
ive never heard of such a thing
she can show you if you let her
tanya you owe us this much
were all under a death sentence
because your sister didnt let us explain
dont be afraid
this is how she communicates
its true
shes not immortal
i knew the rest of our family
would face this fear as well
fear of the unknown
fear of the volturi
amun please
i cannot help you carlisle
i wouldnt ask if it werent urgent
you must go
id like to hear about it
i never get to meet any of amuns friends
he likes to keep me hidden
i cant imagine why
carlisle
benjamin
benjamin can
influence the elements
and here i get super selfcontrol
who are they
senna and zafrina
from the amazon
the arrival of senna and zafrina
meant that our plea was being heard
in even the most remote
corners of the world
while others searched for
witnesses closer to home
a patriot carlisle first met
on the battlefield at yorktown
would become our most unlikely ally
shut up
i hated the first british invasion
and i hate the second one even more
even the beatles
really garrett
old habits die hard
carlisle needs you
sounds interesting
help
but first id better finish my meal
help me help
each of them was won over
each was made to see
carlisle convinced his irish friends
to make the journey to forks
although we were grateful for their help
their thirst for human blood
complicated the situation
the nomads rosalie and emmett sent
were even more unpredictable
especially peter
who had fought alongside
jasper as a newborn
lotta red eyes around here
they agreed not to hunt in the area
but theyll feed somewhere
as more vampires
set foot in their territory
more quileutes turned
their nature compelling
them to join the pack
hey easy there hey
its all right
youre gonna be okay
finally carisle and esme
returned with our last witness
how many came
eighteen
you have some good friends
and alice
well all be on aros list now
centuries on the run
thats what youve brought me
some friend carlisle
alistair come meet everyone
i already told you if it comes to a fight
i wont stand against the volturi
it wont come to a fight
ill be in the attic
hes not a people person
we opened our home to 18 vampires
many with gifts of their own
zafrina had power over the mind
she could make anyone see
what she wanted them to
if she werent holding my hand right now
i could swear this was real
i dont see anything
edward
you didnt tell me your wife is a shield
whats a shield
the ones ive met are so different
its a defensive talent
its why i couldnt read your mind
even before
its why aro couldnt
you have a very powerful gift
oh yeah shes a shield all right
shoulda put her on her ass
or your voltage has been exaggerated
maybe it only works on the weak
garrett i wouldnt
you are an amazing woman
now you guys
can do some serious damage
which is why youll need
to control your phasing
if your mom pisses you off
you dont want to tear her head off
whoevers coming wasnt invited
whoopa
vladimir stefan
youre a long way from home
what are they doing here
we heard the volturi
were moving against you
but that you would not stand alone
we didnt do what we were accused of
we do not care what you did carlisle
we have been waiting a millennium
for the italian scum to be challenged
its not our plan to fight the volturi
shame
aros witnesses will be so disappointed
they enjoy a good fight
aros witnesses
vladimir aww
still hoping theyll listen
when aro
wants someone from a coven
its never long before evidence turns up
proving that coven committed some crime
so hes done this before
it happens so rarely
i never realized it was a pattern
apparently he always pardons one person
whose thoughts he claims are repentant
this person always has an ability
and theyre always given
a place with the guard
this is all about alice
he has no one like her
which is why she left
why does he need witnesses
to spread the word
that justice has been served
after he slaughters an entire coven
benjamin tia
were leaving
and where will you go
what makes you think
theyll be satisfied with alice
whats to stop them
from going after benjamin next
or zafrina or kate
or anyone else with a gift
anyone they want
their goal isnt punishment its power
its acquisition
carlisle might not ask you
to fight but i will
for the sake of my family
but also for yours
and for the way you want to live
the packs will fight
weve never been afraid of vampires
we will fight
this wont be the first time
i fought a kings rule
well join you
no
i will do the right thing amun
you may do as you please
we will stand with you
so will we
that didnt take much
lets hope it doesnt come to that
well see
everyone showed courage
though we knew that aros army
was moving against us
soon we would face the dark gifts of jane
and worse the paralyzing vapor
of her brother alec
who could rob you of
sight sound and touch
i refused him
i refused him
im not with carlisle
alec
i will never go against you
of course not
my dear toshiro
it seems carlisle is still expecting you
carlisle is all but ensuring
his own destruction
sad
isnt it
aro will want us incapacitated
before he attacks
jane and alec will try and take me out first
because i can anticipate their moves
too bad we dont all have your shield
doesnt help me fight though
no but you could help the rest of us
if you could project it
what do you mean
i mean shield someone other than yourself
is that possible
gifts can be developed over time
at first mine was just in my palms
now i can radiate it all over my body
how do you do it
tell me
you need to visualize it
see how it moves
what color it is
now picture it expanding
will it to go beyond you
i think she needs something
to motivate her
no
its all right i can take it
he says that now
focus bella or hes gonna be hurting
edward im not ready to do this yet
im sorry i said that i wasnt ready
dude youre not motivating her
you want to try
kate
you seem to lack incentive
shall i go see if renesmees awake
are you crazy
all right
this ones on full power
its painful but its bearable
okay we should go again
emmett
im good
theres sweet music here that
softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass
or night dews on still
waters between walls
of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass
music that brings
sweet sleep down from the blissful skies
mom
did aunt alice and uncle jasper run away
because were gonna die
no
i think they left to keep us safer
thats what all these
other people are here for too
ill never let anybody hurt you
come here go to sleep
its strange
physically i feel like i
could demolish a tank
mentally i just feel drained
how about a bath
i do remember how to undress myself
yeah i just do it so much better
bella
ive had a bad habit of
underestimating you
every obstacle youve faced
id think you couldnt overcome it
and you just did
youre the reason
they have something to fight for
my family
im gonna get the water running
alice made sure
only i would get the message
because only my mind
would be safe from aro
im surprised
you took a break from jedi training
if i dont take renesmee to my dad
hell come to us
27 vampires one human
not so great
i know thats what you told edward
whatever
im just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers
im sorry
i know
theyre the good guys
but come on
dracula one and two are
creepy
there she is come here
look at you
youve grown half a foot
seriously
like 6 inches
come on inside lunch is on the table
we got a tree to decorate
ive actually got a few
errands to run guys
ill be back soon okay
come on lets go
alices note
gave me a new sense of hope
maybe she had a plan for us after all
and maybe j jenks was the key
im meeting mr jenks
right this way
mrs cullen
hi
im so happy you called
i always meet my private clients here
its more comfortable than the office
and its more public
what type of work do you do j
oh you know this and that
its always different
which keeps it interesting
have you known alice and jasper long
ive been working with them
for more than 20 years
and my late partner
knew jasper 15 years before that
he is
unusually wellpreserved
yes he is
i trust that mr jasper
is enjoying his vacation
he didnt tell you where
he was going did he
no no no
he just mentioned that he was leaving
when he came by to place his order
i assume that his order is ready
of course
ive never been late with a delivery
there a problem
no
my husband and i thought
that wed all be traveling together
jasper said only two were traveling
his instructions were very clear
its my mistake
apparently thats not going to happen
alices vision was clear
renesmee would have a future
but edward and i wouldnt be a pan of it
how ya doin
my dearest renesmee
i thought we would have forever together
but forever isnt as long as i d hoped
i know now why alice left me clues
it was to keep you safe
everything you and jacob will need
is in this pack
jacob will protect you
and hell help you learn
about the ticuna legends
its a romantic notion isnt it
that a righteous few can defy a great evil
i must admit you even had me believing
for a moment
well good luck youre gonna need it
cheers
the snow is sticking
hey we still have today
im so glad charlie found somebody
to take care of him
bella no ones giving up here
all right present time lets go
seth leah stop eating
jake you start get it going
what did you get me
im not giving you anything
hey no come on
what did you get me
well dad
we didnt have time to wrap yours
but here it is
its a 5day fishing trip to fraser river
its for you and sue
you leave tomorrow
thats really nice thank you
tomorrow i cant leave tomorrow
i made arrangements for you at work
sneaky
and extravagant
and nonrefundable im afraid
you two trying to get rid of me
because its working
fraser river
that means well be chasing cutthroat
we might even hook
a rainbow or some bulls
woman knows her trout
hey beautiful let me see
jacob make this for you
wanna put it on
its so pretty
it is really pretty
thats what im talkin about
a little prebattle bonfire
telling war stories
or just standing there
like frickin statues
name any american battle i was there
little bighorn
i came this close to biting custer
but the indians got him first
try olegs assault on constantinople
he didnt win that one on his own
if youre talking battles
youre talking the eleven years war
no one does rebellion like the irish
you lost the eleven years war
aye but it was one hell of a rebellion
when we ruled
everything came to us
p fey
diplomats
favor seekers
such was our power
but we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints
we were honest about what we were
we sat still for a very long time
we didnt notice we were
beginning to petrify
perhaps the volturi did
us a favor when they
burned our castles
weve been waiting 1500 years
to return that favor
we have been ready to do battle for ages
i cant help thinking
all these people
are putting themselves in danger
because i fell in love with a human
you found your mate
you deserve to be happy
but at what cost
everyone here has something to fight for
i certainly do
carlisle ive never thanked you
for this extraordinary life
this means more than my own life
thats how much i love you
tomorrow im gonna need you
to stay with jacob
no matter what
even if i tell him that
that he has to take you somewhere
hey
baby its all right
youre gonna be safe
always
if we live through this
ill follow you anywhere woman
now you tell me
the redcoats are coming
the redcoats are coming
aros looking for alice
aro
let us discuss things as we used to
in a civilized manner
fair words carlisle
but a little out of place
given the battalion
youve assembled against us
i can promise you that
was never my intent
no laws have been broken
we see the child
do not treat us as fools
she is not an immortal
these witnesses can attest to that
or you can look
see the flush of human blood in her cheeks
artifice
i will collect every facet of the truth
but from someone more central to the story
edward
as the child clings to your newborn mate
i assume you are involved
id like to meet her
young bella
immortality becomes you
i hear her strange heart
hello aro
magnifico
half mortal
half immortal
conceived and carried by this
newborn
while she was still human
impossible
do you think they fooled me brother
bring the informer forward
is that the child you saw
im not sure
jane
shes changed this child is bigger
then your allegations were false
the cullens are innocent
i take full responsibility for my mistake
im sorry
caius no
irina
crackling
blind them
give me my sight back
tanya this is what they want
if you attack now well all die
pain
its working
aro you see theres no law broken here
agreed
but does it then follow
that there is no danger
for the first time in our history
humans pose a threat
to our kind
their modern technology
has given birth to weapons
that could destroy us
maintaining our secret
has never been more imperative
in such perilous times
only the known
is safe
only the known
is tolerable
and we know nothing
of what this child will become
can we live with such uncertainty
spare ourselves a fight today
only to die
tomorrow
no
alice
alice
my dear dear alice
were so glad to see you here after all
i have evidence the child
wont be a risk to our kind
let me show you
brother
it doesnt matter what i show you
even when you see
you still wont change your decision
now
take care of my daughter
get them
take her away
let her go
jacob
jacob
jacob
jacob
watch out
bella
finally
now you know
thats your future
unless you decide on another course
we cannot alter our course
the child still poses a grave threat
but what if you were sure she could
remain concealed from the human world
could we leave in peace
of course but that cannot be known
actually it can
ive been searching for witnesses of my own
among the ticuna tribes of brazil
we have enough witnesses
let him speak brother
i am half human
half vampire
like the child
a vampire seduced my mother
who died giving birth to me
my aunt huilen
raised me as her own
i made her immortal
how old are you
150 years
at what age did you reach maturity
i became fullgrown
seven years after my birth
i have not changed since then
and your diet
blood
human food
i can survive on either
these children are much like us
regardless the cullens have been
consorting with werewolves
our natural enemies
dear ones
there is no danger here
we will not fight
today
such a prize
we have them on the run
now is the time to attack
not today
youre all fools
the volturi might be gone
but they will never forgive
what happened here
you have a beautiful family
shes gonna be around
for a long time isnt she
a very long time
im glad she has you
so should i start calling you dad
no
hey
hey
yeah were all gonna be together now
i wanna show you something
what
im edward cullen
how did you do that
been practicing
now you know
nobodys ever loved anybody
as much as i love you
