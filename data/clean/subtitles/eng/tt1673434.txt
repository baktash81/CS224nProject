you re a lot stronger than i am right now 
it s your turn not to break me 
i love you 
i love you 
renesmee 
she s incredible 
where is she  i have to see her 
wait  wait 
you need to get your thirst under control 
yeah  you ll need to hunt 
close your eyes 
what do you hear 
bella  don t 
bella  stop 
i m sorry  i didn t realize
there d be people this far from the trails 
i have to get outta here 
okay  i can help you 
or not 
well  i m amazed 
you ran away from human blood mid hunt 
even mature vampires
have problems with that 
you re still here 
so are you 
i didn t expect you to seem so
you 
except for the creepy eyes 
i would keep my distance for now 
it s safer for the baby
to see how you do with me first 
since when do you care about renesmee 
all right 
take a whiff 
well  i can see
what everyone s been talking about 
jake  you really do stink 
you guys
really look great together 
want to come meet our daughter 
welcome to the family 
you look amazing  bella 
someone s been waiting to meet you 
rose 
beautiful 
what was that 
she showed you
the first memory she has of you 
showed me  how 
how do i hear thoughts 
how does alice see the future 
she s gifted 
i ve only been out for two days 
her growth rate is unprecedented 
all right  that s enough
experimenting for one day 
jacob 
she s doing great 
yeah  let s not push it though 
what s your problem 
do tell her  jacob 
this should be good 
hold on a second 
bella 
look 
it s a wolf thing 
what s a wolf thing 
you know we have no control over it 
we can t choose who it happens with 
and it doesn t mean
what you think  bella  i promise 
take renesmee out of the room 
edward  don t touch me right now 
i don t want to hurt you 
you imprinted on my daughter 
it wasn t my choice 
she s a baby 
it s not like that 
you think edward would
let me live if it was 
i m still debating it 
i ve held her once 
one time  jacob 
and already you think that
you have some moronic
wolfy claim on her 
she s mine 
it s fine  leah 
you re gonna stay away from her 
you know i can t do that 
stop her  edward 
he said it s fine 
she s amazing  right 
do you remember how much
you wanted to be around me 3 days ago 
that s gone now  right 
long gone 
because it was her 
from the beginning it was
nessie who wanted me there 
nessie 
you nicknamed my daughter
after the loch ness monster 
seth  are you okay 
seth  i m sorry 
he ll be all right 
bella 
you know me better than anyone 
all i want is for ness   
renesmee to be safe  happy 
look 
nothing ever made sense before 
you  me  any of it 
and now i understand why 
this was the reason 
finally 
my turn 
where does she sleep 
in my arms  or edward s or esme s 
happy birthday 
i stopped aging three days ago 
well  we re celebrating anyway 
so suck it up 
i still hate surprises 
that hasn t changed 
you ll love this one 
welcome home 
we thought you guys
might like a place of your own 
what do you think 
i think it s perfect 
go inside 
have fun 
this will be renesmee s room 
closet 
alice stocked it for you 
clearly 
this is our room 
vampires don t sleep 
it s not intended for sleep 
you really were holding back before 
i m never gonna get enough of this 
we don t get tired 
we don t have to rest
or catch our breath or eat 
i mean 
i mean 
how are we gonna stop 
rosalie and emmett were so bad 
it took a solid decade
before we could stand to be
within five miles of them 
i think we might be worse 
definitely worse 
done already 
where s renesmee 
blondie stole her 
break a lot of stuff 
emmett 
no 
is that charlie 
he s been calling twice a day 
he s in pretty rough shape 
eventually  we ll have to tell him
you didn t make it 
he needs to mourn  bella 
okay  we ll do it tomorrow 
i m gonna miss this place 
we ll come back  we always do 
wait 
nobody said anything about leaving 
once people believe bella s dead 
we can t risk anyone seeing her 
so you just disappear 
jacob  we don t have another choice 
hey 
you heard anything 
charlie 
bella is   
no  she s not 
no  no  no  i mean  she s fine 
she s back home and
she s feeling better 
why didn t you say so  that s great 
wait 
there s something you need to see first 
i need to see bella 
look 
in order for bella to
get better  she had to
change 
what do you mean   change  
here goes nothing 
what the hell are you doing 
you don t live in the
world you think you do 
jacob  put your clothes on 
now  this may seem strange 
really strange  but
stranger things happen every day 
trust me 
holy shit 
look  i solved a problem 
you were leaving 
what did you expect me to do 
you don t realize
the danger you ve put him in 
the volturi will kill anyone
who knows about us 
no  i didn t tell him about you  just me 
i only said you were different 
and that we have a niece who we adopted 
i mean  seriously  jake 
he s not just gonna let that go 
did you consider
the physical pain he ll put bella through 
it ll be like sticking
a white hot branding iron down her throat 
and that s assuming
she can control her thirst 
look  charlie s been in hell 
and i know you ll be
much happier with him in your life 
jacob  don t try and pretend you re
doing this for anyone but yourself 
sorry you feel that way
because he ll be here in 10 minutes 
what 
these will irritate your eyes at first 
the main thing is not to move too fast 
try taking a seat  crossing your legs 
maybe a tad slower 
and blink at least three times a minute 
good 
for a cartoon character 
hold your breath  it will
help with the thirst 
just don t forget to move your shoulders
so it looks like you re breathing 
and don t sit so straight 
humans don t do that 
okay  i got it 
move around  blink  slouch 
good luck 
hello  charlie 
where s bella 
bella 
hi  dad 
are you okay 
never better 
healthy as a horse 
you don t turn into an animal  too  do you 
she wishes she was that awesome 
let s give them some privacy 
jake said that this   
this was necessary 
what does that mean 
i really think it would be better   
i wanna know what happened to you 
i can t tell you 
i think i deserve an explanation 
you do 
but if you really need
one  i can t stay here 
oh  come on  no 
no more going away 
dad  you re just gonna have to trust
that for whatever reason 
i m all right 
i m more than all right 
can you live with that 
can i live with that 
well  i don t know  bella 
i mean  i just watched a kid
i ve known his entire life
turn into a very large dog 
my daughter looks like my daughter 
but doesn t 
can you please just believe that i ll
tell you anything that you need to know 
and i don t need to know this 
no 
really  you don t 
well   
not gonna lose you again 
i can t 
then you won t 
i promise 
i missed you  bells 
so much 
i missed you  dad 
charlie 
this is renesmee 
your niece 
our daughter 
right 
the adoption 
renee semee 
she s got your eyes  bella 
need to know  i guess 
well clone  bella 
never seen a newborn
show that kind of restraint 
i m not sure she is a newborn 
she s so tame 
emmett  don t antagonize her 
she s the strongest one in the house 
please 
don t hurt yourself  emmett 
all right  on 3 
1 
z 
three 
did you see that 
thank you 
my time as a human was over 
but i never felt more alive 
i was born to be a vampire 
i was born to be a vampire 
everything was falling into place 
even the volturi
seemed to accept my new status 
though they d want proof eventually 
it seemed we had only one enemy left 
time 
renesmee was growing too fast 
we all worried about
how long we would have with her 
it just made every moment more precious 
look  a snowflake 
it s beautiful 
why don t you go get another one 
edward thinks that
we ll find answers in brazil 
there are tribes there
that might know something 
renesmeei who was that 
i think that s our cousin from denali 
irina 
tanya convinced irina
to come reconcile with us 
it looks like she changed her mind 
seeing jacob
must have been too much for her 
wish i could have just spoken to her 
she s family  she ll come around 
what a pleasant surprise 
what do you want 
i have to report a crime 
the cullens   
they ve done something terrible 
allow me  my dear 
oh  my 
what is it  alice 
the volturi 
they re coming for us 
aro  caius  marcus  the guard 
and irina 
honey  come here 
why 
what did irina see in the woods 
we were just walking 
ness was catching snowflakes 
of course 
irina thinks renesmee s an immortal child 
the immortal children
were very beautiful 
so enchanting 
to be near them was to love them 
but their development was frozen
at the age they were turned 
they couldn t be taught or restrained 
a single tantrum
could destroy an entire village 
humans heard about the devastation 
stories spread 
the volturi were forced to intervene 
since the children
couldn t protect our secret 
they had to be destroyed 
woman  no 
no 
no 
their creators grew very attached
and fought to protect them 
long established covens were torn apart 
countless humans slaughtered 
traditions  friends 
even families  lost 
no  no 
  mother 
  no 
mother 
so the denalis  mother
made an immortal child 
yes 
and she paid the price 
well  renesmee s nothing
like those children 
she was born  not bitten 
she grows every single day 
so can t you just explain
that to the volturi 
aro has enough proof in lrina s thoughts 
so we fight 
their offensive
weapons are too powerful 
no one can stand against jane 
alec s even worse 
well  then we convince them 
they re coming to kill us  not to talk 
no  you re right 
they won t listen to us 
but maybe others can convince them 
carlisle  you have friends
all around the world 
i won t ask them to fight 
not fight  witness 
if enough people knew the truth 
maybe we could convince
the volturi to listen 
we can ask this of our friends 
at least we get to go to london again 
at least we get to go to london again 
we haven t been there in a long time 
all right  let s get this show on the road 
alice asked me to give you that 
she and jasper
crossed our lands to the ocean last night 
carlisle 
they ve left us 
why 
she didn t say 
can i see that 
gather as many witnesses as you can
before the snow sticks to the ground 
that s when they ll come 
alice s instructions were clear 
but the question remained 
why would she and jasper leave
at the moment we needed them most 
what did they know 
our search for witnesses began
with a trip north to our closest relatives 
edward  is everything all right 
why didn t you tell us you were coming 
is it irina 
have you heard from her 
not directly 
why is your bride waiting in the car 
and why have you brought
a wolf with you 
i can smell him from here 
my family is in danger  i need your help 
what s happened 
it s hard to explain
but i need you to be open minded 
can you do that 
of course 
okay 
time to meet some new people 
what if they don t like me 
  they ll love you 
  they will 
once they understand you 
they just haven t met
anyone like you before 
okay 
the volturi will come for all of us 
you get that thing out of here 
she s not what she looks like 
this is a crime 
stay back 
she has blood in her veins 
you can feel her warmth 
i can feel it 
i m her biological father 
  bella is her mother 
  impossible 
it s true  she was born
while i was still human 
i ve never heard of such a thing 
she can show you  if you let her 
tanya  you owe us this much 
we re all under a death sentence
because your sister didn t let us explain 
don t be afraid 
this is how she communicates 
it s true 
she s not immortal 
i knew the rest of our family
would face this fear as well 
fear of the unknown 
fear of the volturi 
amun  please 
i cannot help you  carlisle 
i wouldn t ask if it weren t urgent 
you must go 
i d like to hear about it 
i never get to meet any of amun s friends 
he likes to keep me hidden 
i can t imagine why 
  carlisle 
  benjamin 
benjamin can
influence the elements 
and here i get super self control 
who are they 
senna and zafrina 
from the amazon 
the arrival of senna and zafrina
meant that our plea was being heard
in even the most remote
corners of the world
while others searched for
witnesses closer to home 
a patriot carlisle first met
on the battlefield at yorktown
would become our most unlikely ally 
shut up 
i hated the first british invasion 
and i hate the second one even more 
even the beatles 
really  garrett 
old habits die hard 
carlisle needs you 
sounds interesting 
help 
but first i d better finish my meal 
help me  help 
each of them was won over 
each was made to see 
carlisle convinced his irish friends
to make the journey to forks 
although we were grateful for their help 
their thirst for human blood
complicated the situation 
the nomads rosalie and emmett sent
were even more unpredictable 
especially peter
who had fought alongside
jasper as a newborn 
lotta red eyes around here 
they agreed not to hunt in the area 
but they ll feed somewhere 
as more vampires
set foot in their territory 
more quileutes turned 
their nature compelling
them to join the pack 
hey  easy there  hey 
it s all right 
you re gonna be okay 
finally  car isle and esme
returned with our last witness 
  how many came 
  eighteen 
you have some good friends 
and alice 
we ll all be on aro s list now 
centuries on the run 
that s what you ve brought me 
some friend  carlisle 
alistair  come meet everyone 
i already told you  if it comes to a fight 
i won t stand against the volturi 
it won t come to a fight 
i ll be in the attic 
he s not a people person 
we opened our home to 18 vampires 
many with gifts of their own 
zafrina had power over the mind 
she could make anyone see
what she wanted them to 
if she weren t holding my hand right now 
i could swear this was real 
i don t see anything 
edward 
you didn t tell me your wife is a shield 
what s a shield 
the ones i ve met are so different 
it s a defensive talent 
it s why i couldn t read your mind 
even before 
it s why aro couldn t 
you have a very powerful gift 
oh  yeah  she s a shield  all right 
shoulda put her on her ass 
or your voltage has been exaggerated 
maybe it only works on the weak 
garrett  i wouldn t 
you are an amazing woman 
now  you guys
can do some serious damage 
which is why you ll need
to control your phasing 
if your mom pisses you off 
you don t want to tear her head off 
whoever s coming wasn t invited 
whoopa 
vladimir  stefan 
you re a long way from home 
what are they doing here 
we heard the volturi
were moving against you 
but that you would not stand alone 
we didn t do what we were accused of 
we do not care what you did  carlisle 
we have been waiting a millennium
for the italian scum to be challenged 
it s not our plan to fight the volturi 
shame 
aro s witnesses will be so disappointed 
they enjoy a good fight 
aro s witnesses 
vladimir  aww 
still hoping they ll listen 
when aro
wants someone from a coven
it s never long before evidence turns up
proving that coven committed some crime 
so he s done this before 
it happens so rarely 
i never realized it was a pattern 
apparently he always pardons one person
whose thoughts he claims are repentant 
this person always has an ability 
and they re always given
a place with the guard 
this is all about alice 
  he has no one like her 
  which is why she left 
why does he need witnesses 
to spread the word
that justice has been served 
after he slaughters an entire coven 
benjamin  tia 
  we re leaving 
  and where will you go 
what makes you think
they ll be satisfied with alice 
what s to stop them
from going after benjamin next 
or zafrina or kate
or anyone else with a gift 
anyone they want 
their goal isn t punishment  it s power 
it s acquisition 
carlisle might not ask you
to fight  but i will 
for the sake of my family 
but also for yours 
and for the way you want to live 
the packs will fight 
we ve never been afraid of vampires 
we will fight 
this won t be the first time
i fought a king s rule 
we ll join you 
no 
i will do the right thing  amun 
you may do as you please 
we will stand with you 
so will we 
that didn t take much 
let s hope it doesn t come to that 
we ll see 
everyone showed courage 
though we knew that aro s army
was moving against us 
soon we would face the dark gifts of jane 
and worse  the paralyzing vapor
of her brother alec
who could rob you of
sight  sound and touch 
i refused him 
i refused him 
i m not with carlisle 
alec 
i will never go against you 
of course not 
my dear toshiro 
it seems carlisle is still expecting you 
carlisle is all but ensuring
his own destruction 
sad 
isn t it 
aro will want us incapacitated
before he attacks 
jane and alec will try and take me out first
because i can anticipate their moves 
too bad we don t all have your shield 
doesn t help me fight  though 
no  but you could help the rest of us 
if you could project it 
what do you mean 
i mean shield someone other than yourself 
is that possible 
gifts can be developed  over time 
at first  mine was just in my palms 
now i can radiate it all over my body 
how do you do it 
tell me 
you need to visualize it 
see how it moves 
what color it is 
now picture it expanding 
will it to go beyond you 
i think she needs something
to motivate her 
  no 
  it s all right  i can take it 
he says that now 
focus  bella  or he s gonna be hurting 
edward  i m not ready to do this yet 
i m sorry  i said that i wasn t ready 
dude  you re not motivating her 
you want to try 
kate 
you seem to lack incentive 
shall i go see if renesmee s awake 
are you crazy 
all right 
this one s on full power 
it s painful  but it s bearable 
okay  we should go again 
emmett 
i m good 
 there s sweet music here that 
 softer falls
than petals from blown roses on the grass  
 or night dews on still
waters between walls 
 of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass  
 music that brings
sweet sleep down from the blissful skies  
mom 
did aunt alice and uncle jasper run away
because we re gonna die 
no 
i think they left to keep us safer 
that s what all these
other people are here for  too 
i ll never let anybody hurt you 
come here  go to sleep 
it s strange 
physically  i feel like i
could demolish a tank 
mentally  i just feel drained 
how about a bath 
i do remember how to undress myself 
yeah  i just do it so much better 
bella 
i ve had a bad habit of
underestimating you 
every obstacle you ve faced 
i d think you couldn t overcome it 
and you just did 
you re the reason
they have something to fight for 
my family 
i m gonna get the water running 
alice made sure
only i would get the message 
because only my mind
would be safe from aro 
i m surprised
you took a break from jedi training 
if i don t take renesmee to my dad 
he ll come to us 
27 vampires  one human 
not so great 
i know that s what you told edward 
whatever 
i m just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers 
i m sorry 
i know 
they re the good guys 
but come on 
dracula one and two are
creepy 
there she is  come here 
look at you 
you ve grown half a foot 
seriously 
like 6 inches 
come on inside  lunch is on the table 
we got a tree to decorate 
i ve actually got a few
errands to run  guys 
i ll be back soon  okay 
come on  let s go 
alice s note
gave me a new sense of hope 
maybe she had a plan for us after all 
and maybe j  jenks was the key 
  i m meeting mr  jenks 
  right this way 
  mrs  cullen 
  hi 
i m so happy you called 
i always meet my private clients here 
it s more comfortable than the office 
and it s more public 
what type of work do you do  j  
oh  you know  this and that 
it s always different 
which keeps it interesting 
have you known alice and jasper long 
i ve been working with them
for more than 20 years 
and my late partner
knew jasper 15 years before that 
he is 
unusually well preserved 
yes  he is 
i trust that mr  jasper
is enjoying his vacation 
he didn t tell you where
he was going  did he 
no  no  no 
he just mentioned that he was leaving
when he came by to place his order 
i assume that his order is ready 
of course 
i ve never been late with a delivery 
there a problem 
no 
my husband and i thought
that we d all be traveling together 
jasper said only two were traveling 
his instructions were very clear 
it s my mistake 
apparently  that s not going to happen 
alice s vision was clear 
renesmee would have a future 
but edward and i wouldn t be a pan  of it 
how ya doin  
 my dearest renesmee   
 i thought we would have forever together  
 but forever isn t as long as i  d hoped  
 i know now why alice left me clues  
 it was to keep you safe  
 everything you and jacob will need
is in this pack  
 jacob will protect you  
 and he ll help you learn
about the ticuna legends  
it s a romantic notion  isn t it 
that a righteous few can defy a great evil 
i must admit  you even had me believing 
for a moment 
well  good luck  you re gonna need it 
cheers 
the snow is sticking 
hey  we still have today 
i m so glad charlie found somebody
to take care of him 
bella  no one s giving up here 
all right  present time  let s go 
seth  leah  stop eating 
jake  you start  get it going 
  what did you get me 
  i m not giving you anything 
hey  no  come on 
what did you get me 
well  dad 
we didn t have time to wrap yours 
but here it is 
it s a 5 day fishing trip to fraser river 
it s for you and sue 
you leave tomorrow 
that s really nice  thank you 
tomorrow  i can t leave tomorrow 
i made arrangements for you at work 
sneaky 
and extravagant 
and non refundable  i m afraid 
you two trying to get rid of me 
because it s working 
fraser river 
that means we ll be chasing cutthroat 
we might even hook
a rainbow or some bulls 
woman knows her trout 
hey  beautiful  let me see 
jacob make this for you 
wanna put it on 
it s so pretty 
it is really pretty 
that s what i m talkin  about 
a little pre battle bonfire 
telling war stories 
or just standing there
like frickin  statues 
name any american battle  i was there 
little bighorn 
i came this close to biting custer 
but the indians got him first 
try oleg s assault on constantinople 
he didn t win that one on his own 
if you re talking battles 
you re talking the eleven years  war 
no one does rebellion like the irish 
you lost the eleven years  war 
aye  but it was one hell of a rebellion 
when we ruled 
everything came to us 
p fey 
diplomats 
favor seekers 
such was our power 
but we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints 
we were honest about what we were 
we sat still for a very long time 
we didn t notice we were
beginning to petrify 
perhaps the volturi did
us a favor when they
burned our castles 
we ve been waiting 1 500 years
to return that favor 
we have been ready to do battle for ages 
i can t help thinking 
all these people
are putting themselves in danger
because i fell in love with a human 
you found your mate 
you deserve to be happy 
but at what cost 
everyone here has something to fight for 
i certainly do 
carlisle  i ve never thanked you 
for this extraordinary life 
this means  more than my own life  
that s how much i love you 
tomorrow i m gonna need you
to stay with jacob 
no matter what 
even if i tell him that   
that he has to take you somewhere 
hey 
baby  it s all right 
you re gonna be safe 
always 
if we live through this 
i ll follow you anywhere  woman 
now you tell me 
the redcoats are coming 
the redcoats are coming 
aro s looking for alice 
aro 
let us discuss things as we used to 
in a civilized manner 
fair words  carlisle 
but a little out of place 
given the battalion
you ve assembled against us 
i can promise you  that
was never my intent 
no laws have been broken 
we see the child 
do not treat us as fools 
she is not an immortal 
these witnesses can attest to that 
or you can look 
see the flush of human blood in her cheeks 
artifice 
i will collect every facet of the truth 
but from someone more central to the story 
edward 
as the child clings to your newborn mate 
i assume you are involved 
i d like to meet her 
young bella 
immortality becomes you 
i hear her strange heart 
hello  aro 
magnifico 
half mortal 
half immortal 
conceived and carried by this
newborn
while she was still human 
impossible 
do you think they fooled me  brother 
bring the informer forward 
is that the child you saw 
i m not sure 
jane 
she s changed  this child is bigger 
then your allegations were false 
the cullens are innocent 
i take full responsibility for my mistake 
i m sorry 
caius  no 
irina 
 crackling 
blind them 
give me my sight back 
tanya  this is what they want 
if you attack now  we ll all die 
pain 
it s working 
aro  you see there s no law broken here 
agreed 
but does it then follow
that there is no danger 
for the first time in our history
humans pose a threat
to our kind 
their modern technology
has given birth to weapons
that could destroy us 
maintaining our secret
has never been more imperative 
in such perilous times 
only the known
is safe 
only the known
is tolerable 
and we know nothing
of what this child will become 
can we live with such uncertainty 
spare ourselves a fight today 
only to die
tomorrow 
no

alice 
my dear  dear alice 
we re so glad to see you here  after all 
i have evidence the child
won t be a risk to our kind 
let me show you 
brother 
it doesn t matter what i show you 
even when you see 
you still won t change your decision 
now 
take care of my daughter 
get them 
take her away 
let her go 
jacob

jacob 
jacob 
watch out 
bella 
finally 
now you know 
that s your future 
unless you decide on another course 
we cannot alter our course 
the child still poses a grave threat 
but what if you were sure she could
remain concealed from the human world 
could we leave in peace 
of course  but that cannot be known 
actually  it can 
i ve been searching for witnesses of my own
among the ticuna tribes of brazil 
  we have enough witnesses 
  let him speak  brother 
i am half human 
half vampire 
like the child 
a vampire seduced my mother 
who died giving birth to me 
my aunt huilen
raised me as her own 
i made her immortal 
how old are you 
150 years 
at what age did you reach maturity 
i became full grown
seven years after my birth 
i have not changed since then 
and your diet 
blood 
human food 
i can survive on either 
these children are much like us 
regardless  the cullens have been
consorting with werewolves 
our natural enemies 
dear ones 
there is no danger here 
we will not fight
today 
such a prize 
we have them on the run 
now is the time to attack 
not today 
you re all fools 
the volturi might be gone 
but they will never forgive
what happened here 
you have a beautiful family 
she s gonna be around
for a long time  isn t she 
a very long time 
i m glad she has you 
so should i start calling you  dad  
no 
hey 
hey 
yeah  we re all gonna be together now 
i wanna show you something 
what 
i m edward cullen

now you know 
nobody s ever loved anybody
as much as i love you
