and the dark of the night
sunshine is my destroyer
all this shall change
tonight the sun sets forever
there shall never be
another dawn
ah blix
come closer
you summoned me lordship
are you not the most loathsome
of my goblins
truly master
and is your heart black
and full of hate
black as midnight
black as pitch
blacker than
the foulest witch
that is why
i have called you here
since i must remain in darkness
you shall be my eyes and ears
you do me
great honor lord
something troubles me
i feel a presence
in the forest
a force i had mercifully
almost forgotten
must be dread indeed
to trouble you lordship
looking upon
these frail creatures
one would not think that
they could contain such power
one could rule
the universe with it
you must find them for me
and destroy them
what do they look like lord
fool let this
serve to remind you
they are each crowned
with a single horn
reaching straight
to heaven
i get the point lord
bring the horns to me
you will be well rewarded
you shall be a prince
here in my realm
a rare privilege master
where shall i look sire
there is only one lure
for such disgusting goodness
one bait that never fails
what be this bait

innocence innocence
come white flowers
weave us a carpet
spreading oak
make a shade where we lie
leaves and branches
whisper our love song
when i look
in my true loves eyes

to me
blooming fairies
