and the dark of the night 
sunshine is my destroyer 
all this shall change 
tonight  the sun sets forever 
there shall never be
another dawn   
ah  blix 
come closer 
you summoned me  lordship 
are you not the most loathsome
of my goblins 
truly  master 
and is your heart black
and full of hate 
black as midnight 
black as pitch 
blacker than
the foulest witch 
that is why
i have called you here 
since i must remain in darkness 
you shall be my eyes and ears 
you do me
great honor  lord 
something troubles me 
i feel a presence
in the forest 
a force i had mercifully
almost forgotten 
must be dread  indeed 
to trouble you  lordship 
looking upon
these frail creatures 
one would not think that
they could contain such power 
one could rule
the universe with it 
you must find them for me
and destroy them 
what do they look like  lord 
fool  let this
serve to remind you 
they are each crowned
with a single horn   
reaching straight
to heaven 
i get the point  lord 
bring the horns to me 
you will be well rewarded 
you shall be a prince
here in my realm 
a rare privilege  master 
where shall i look  sire 
there is only one lure
for such disgusting goodness 
one bait that never fails 
what be this bait 
please  you teach me 
innocence  innocence 
come  white flowers
weave us a carpet
spreading oak
make a shade where we lie
leaves and branches
whisper our love song
when i look
in my true love s eyes
young as any spring
his eyes almost sing
to me
blooming fairies 
lily

for a visit today 
oh  you ve got
a sweetheart waiting

surely  your father
forbids such folly 
what my father doesn t know
won t trouble him 
oh  the willful heart
invites despair 
like blind men creeping
in a dragon s lair 
not a country proverb
nor king s command   
could keep me
from the woods today 
then it s common sense sort 
lily  princess lily 
i look on you as a daughter 
if you ll pardon my saying it 
it s time you started behaving

more magic for me   
than any palace

the first time it flies
i feel magic
stirring within me
when i look
in my true love s eyes
young as any spring
his eyes almost seem
this shot be
just as sweet as pie

on this night 
you have but to ask 
i will stay here with you
as you wish 
  but on one condition 
  anything 
i want to kill the unicorn 
i can t let that happen 
in the beginning   
there was nothing  
a void of darkness 
a cold eternity
of silence 
jack  your greatest challenge
is still to come 
and we have not much time 
when the perfect void
was corrupted   
by light 
a great wailing was heard 
and all the brethren fled
in terror 
gump 
oona  fly up like the wind 
it s time 
jack 
lily 
jack

in honor of you 
sanctified with blood   
and with fire 
i pray you  father 
accept my sacrifice 
let light
be forever extinguished 
let the age of darkness begin 
come  lady 
the birth of a new world
awaits your stroke 
let my offering be made
of flesh and blood 
she means to do it  jack 
she s one of them 
i am sister to the fates 
kill her  forget her
