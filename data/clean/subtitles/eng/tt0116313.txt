my clients and miss eliots marriage
resulted in many successful films
including inner urges
human instinct
and animal nature in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian
thank you
my idea
was not
was too
my client produced these films
which enhanced miss eliots career
therefore she is indebted to him
i produced these films
you knew nothing when i met you
i taught you everything what
those were your best years elise
therefore we request half of miss
eliots assets and a monthly stipend
he wants alimony
as for the sculpture art japanese
porcelain and objets dart
collected during the marriage
my client thinks it fair for miss eliot
to dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly
they were anniversary presents
xmas presents i gave him
everything now he wants more

dumpster woman
i said to him morty you ve got to
move on and move up

impression was shes someone
see thats what i told him
but he doesnt get it
he doesnt get a lot of things
are you finished
yeah im done
take the fork
fork
all you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand
like what
the correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef
of course a decorator of death
your house is your calling card
it has to be perfected
photographed published
can you really help me
i would kill for that
thats unnecessary

johnny lets go
