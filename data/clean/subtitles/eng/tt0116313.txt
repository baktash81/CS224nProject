my client s and miss eliot s marriage
resulted in many successful films  
  including  inner urges  
 human instinct   
  and  animal nature  in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian 
  thank you 
  my idea 
  was not 
  was too 
my client produced these films
which enhanced miss eliot s career 
  therefore  she is indebted to him 
  i produced these films 
you knew nothing when i met you 
i taught you everything  what 
those were your best years  elise 
therefore  we request half of miss
eliot s assets and a monthly stipend 
he wants alimony 
as for the sculpture  art  japanese
porcelain and objets d art 
  collected during the marriage 
my client thinks it fair for miss eliot  
  to dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly 
they were anniversary presents  
  xmas presents  i gave him
everything  now he wants more  
now  duarto  i ask you  who s this

emotionally barren woman

  duarto 
shelly has a new apartment
that needs to be decorated 
gunilla  i d adore it 
enchantée  au revoir  jolie 
gunilla garson goldberg personally
invited me to her society luncheon 
why 
gunilla goldberg was happy helping
us  she being a fiirst wlfe herself 
indeed  gunilla was a 1st  2nd  3rd  
  and 4th wlfe  which accounted for
her very comfortable surroundings 
this is delicious 
usually i bring my own dressing 
that fat free ranch stuff 
but this is restaurant quality 
  thank you 
  can i tell you something 
when i first got your call 
i said to morty   
 this just feels so right  
me and gunilla 
i used to work for morty
as his executive assistant 
he was married to that
nightmare then    brenda  
  a completely class free
dumpster woman 
i said to him   morty  you  ve got to
move on and move up  
now  here i am  taste central 
the moment i saw you    my first
impression was she s someone   
see  that s what i told him 
but he doesn t get it 
  he doesn t get a lot of things 
  are you finished 
  yeah  i m done 
  take the fork 
fork 
all you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand 
like what 
the correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef 
of course  a decorator    of death 
your house is your calling card 
it has to be perfected  
  photographed  published 
can you really help me 
i would kill for that 
that s unnecessary 
just two words  duarto feliz 
he is a genius  a gem 
of course  he s impossible to get 
he works all the time 
oh  my god 
there she is  princess pelvis 
  gunilla says she went for it
