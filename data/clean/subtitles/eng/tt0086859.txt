i think of her all the time
thats a new reality for you
she stole 50 grand from me
i wouldve given her the money
i want her back
and i want you to find her
youre crazy why would you
trust me with her
jessie hates ball players
do you think thats funny
shes also mrs wylers daughter
did you ever meet her
ive heard about her shes
supposed to be wild
her father was an english guy
mrs wyler married
one of those stage actors who
cant make it in american films
anyway after he died
mr wyler adopted her
an owners daughter living
with a bookie
thats something isnt it
she hates her mother
treated her like a possession
you know how it is to be one
of mrs wylers possessions
ill give you 10000 right now
pay your expenses
and if you find her
ill give you 20000 more
youre crazy
im a football player
without a team
that new porsche of yours
is it paid for
what are you gonna do man
sell insurance
you dont have the personality
to work for the networks
i dont want you to bring
her back man
just find her tell me where she is
what does that take time and money
you got the time right now
i got the money
great
you know ive never used
what i got on you
could be otherwise
i wouldnt want that would you
its simple
either you want to play
football again or you dont
you never change do you
not a bit
try mrs wyler she probably
knows where jessie is
right
if this is about you being cut
i dont involve myself with
daytoday team business
thats not why i came here
mrs wyler
then suppose you tell me exactly
what you want with me mr brogan

i dont know what she did
to get away from him
what matters is she got
the hell away from him

grace
ed seems to have solved
the soames problem
the head of the planning commission

you from him
i wont let jessica live like this
ill double whatever hes paying you
im not some gun for hire
he cant top what we offer

he cant give you your job back
with the outlaws
we could consider something
you know it isnt easy for
jessica to hide from me
shes been drawing from her trust
its going to a little bank in mexico
to an island
cozumel
you could keep a watch on her
make sure he gets nowhere
near her again
you know
i used jake wise
as an excuse to come here
i did come to get my job back
i didnt deserve what i got
i played some good ball
i got a lot of good years left
i want to be back on the team
but because im worth it
not because i spied on some
25yearold who ran away from home
im not going to spy for you
or jake wise
ben this young man
is trespassing here
throw him out
i dont believe youre wanted here
and you can forget about kirsch
hes on my team
you want the outlaws to
pay you off sue us
walk him to his car
i can kick myself out thanks
ten years work grace
and were this close
i think just a few members of the team
would have been enough
having the outlaws out here full force
is kind of crowding it
i have to get some use out of them
i dont like football
ben
we got troubles
soames is here
hes brought a lot of those
save the mountain people

i dont know
its beautiful huh
if this were la my stepfather
wouldve bought it
torn it up and built condominiums
here the land intimidates them
they leave it in peace
some spot
its nothing like the great
maya cities of the yucatan
chichen itza
should have hidden there
is that what youre doing
hiding
yep
from you right
what do you mean
jake sent you
maybe your mother did
i wouldnt know which one
had more to threaten you with
you wanna know the truth
i came for the hell of it
i wanted to get out of la
a caribbean island didnt sound too bad
only trouble is now im here
i find myself
in the middle of something
ive no feeling for
well youre not doing this for free
youre getting paid well
arent you
which one are you working for
which one knows you found me
nobody knows anything okay
oh sure
i figure fuck them you know
fuck you too lady
i loved your drawing
i wanna talk to you
talk
why should i believe
you wont tell jake where i am
there are people who care what you
believe i dont see them here
i have a broken shoulder
both my knees are shot
guys are crippling themselves
so you can act like a
13yearold runaway from bel air
i could give a shit what you believe
hows sam
who
my dog
i dont know
looks like hes fed
i shouldnt be afraid of you
when you leaving
i think 400
i wish it were sooner
never found where i live did you
i dont think anybody could
its the prettiest place
on the island
dont leave without saying goodbye
you take the highway out of town
to kilometre 19
when you see the three tecate cans
its the first dirt road
on the right
dont leave without saying goodbye
dont leave without saying goodbye
you dont have to worry about
the neighbors
they were building homes here
when a storm hit
they all fell down except this one
waited for you huh
like a drink
all right thatd be great
tequila okay
thats great
its maya
third century i think
no ice
thats all right
you dont have any electricity here
propane
howd you end up with jake
the palace i guess
i wanted to be a
rock n roll singer
jake convinced me that rich girls
dont have the soul for it
sounds like jake always convincing
somebody of something
it seems i have the soul to
live with him be his girlfriend
he never had anybody
like you before
youre a whole different class
for him
not really
my family didnt get to own most
of bel air by being honest
jake always thought i was his luck
i helped him outthink people
like my family
i know why he wanted you
but why were you with him
i liked that my being with him
made a lot of people crazy
like your mom
it even frightened her
and that was really something to
finally pull off
if only my brother had done
that and not by killing himself
your brother killed himself
i guess
he got into drugs
for the same reason i did
to get away from our terrible life
did his dying make you stop
jake did
jake did
after i was with him awhile it became
very important to him that i stop
wouldnt leave me
alone until i quit
the truth is i wanted to quit
when i did i didnt need
jake anymore
bet that kind of threw him
he said the only way i could
get away was to kill him
well you almost did
not really
im gonna stay away from jake
