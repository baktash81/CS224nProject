take care of that shoulder 
good job 
nice legs  but watch
this one 
brogan 
i didn t like what i saw on sunday 
what  i caught
the winning touchdown 
you missed that track back block 
you were worried about your shoulder 
doctor says
there s no permanent damage 
i don t want any weaknesses
read by the other team 
you took yourself off
the injured reserve 
you said you were healthy 
the shoulder is solid 
why don t you prove that 
i intend to 
i mean right now 
mrs  wyler s paying you   
   to play football  not
talk about it 
why don t you go over to the sled 
the sled is bullshit 
i got two rookies who
need playing time  brogan 
either go to the sled or
sit on the bench 
no  stassen  i ll go over
there and prove it to you 
sam  go with him 
come on  sam 
no matter how long you play 
they want you   
   to prove it one more time 
north field scrimmage

fuck 
sully  i d like you to meet our
county supervisor  ed phillips 
he s mrs  wyler s guest today 
i m a big fan 
not only of the outlaws  but of
the football you played 
football s changed since
i was a player 
right  right 
i guess that run of injuries   
   kind of hurt you guys 
we had a lousy bench last year 
we had to play a lot
of injured ball players 
that s part of the job 
you never played injured 
yeah  well  i was dumb 
i don t like my boys
getting hurt permanently 
that s why they
call him   mother   
hit it 
i don t know about being a supervisor 
i sure as hell don t know
about being a lawyer 
but if i was a lawyer i wouldn t know
shit about football  would i 
excuse me 
let s get out of here 
hit it 
you don t have to do this  brogan 
the fucker s not beating me 
hand down again  look at me 
hit it 
i m the trainer here  and i say
he s had enough 
what re you trying to prove 
you re a veteran 
what a dumb fucking thing
to have me do 
wait for me in my office  brogan 
steve kirsch s office

i need to speak to steve 
the outlaws just put me on waivers 
i m sorry to hear that

he suggests you call hal schumacher 
i don t want
hal schumacher i want steve 
when s he available 
i really don t know 
thank you  thanks a lot 
  they screw up my shoulder  then cut me 
  shit 
that s it in a word 
they promised they d keep you 
this is behind my back  kid 
yeah  i figured 
at first i thought
they d pay me off 
but i want to play football 
not this year 
not with that shoulder 
let me ask you something 
what makes you think
they ll pay you off 
i was injured 
you played two games great  if you re
injured  you didn t look it 
what was i supposed to do 
if i give them any trouble 
they cut me 
they cut you anyway 
they re rebuilding 
more profit  less talent 
you cost too much 
they re not screwing me around 
i m gonna see my lawyer 
i ll miss the pressure 
give me a call 
caxton  benjamin  parker and stein 
yes  he is 
hold on a moment 
may i help you 
  i m here to see steve kirsch 
  i ll ring his office 
hello 
i m here to see steve kirsch 
i know  i m the one you ve been
talking to all day 
the one who s a big fan 
what s your name 
edie 
edie  he s not ever

you re down in my book to call 
  where s his office

i m telling you the truth 
it wouldn t be out of line for
you to lie  would it 
where is he 
terry  it s good to see you 
i m cut from the outlaws 
i know  i heard  the firm
represents mrs  wyler 
since i joined the firm 
i can t represent players 
mrs  wyler owns the outlaws 
she s our biggest client 
it s a conflict of interest 
wait a minute  when you came
hustling me in school   
   i put my career in your hands 
remember 
you re right 
i m sorry  sit down 
i ve been playing injured 
they know  but they don t
want to pay me off 
i think that s what their
position s gonna be 
their position s fucked 
i ll go to the players  association 
you could do that  but listen 
what happens if the outlaws prove
that you re perfectly fine 
they ve got film when you re
in practice  games 
they re gonna fight for
a long  long time 
steve  look 
i m having money problems  man 
i m broke 
did you spend every cent
you ever made 
let me think for
just a second here 
i should get you a low interest loan
to tide you over 
  excuse me 
  could you wait  please 
i ll talk to these guys 
see if i can soften their position   
   and get you something so
it s not a hassle 
excuse me  mr  kirsch

have a taste of this 
how about a guinness 
wanna tell me what
i m doing here 
you re out of a job  right 
i ve got some job
possibilities for you 
for one  you can work right back here 
celebrity bartender 
making drinks and telling
football stories to drunks 
how does that sound 
you take the job  you re
a lot funnier than i am 
how about security guard 
i mean  you know how to get hit 
the point is  for a guy
in your situation  terry   
   the options stink 
or you can find her for me 
who s this  the knife lady 
she s very important to me  terry 
i think of her all the time 
that s a new reality for you 
she stole 50 grand from me 
i would ve given her the money 
i want her back 
and i want you to find her 
you re crazy  why would you
trust me with her 
jessie hates ball players 
do you think that s funny 
she s also mrs  wyler s daughter 
did you ever meet her 
i ve heard about her  she s
supposed to be wild 
her father was an english guy
mrs  wyler married 
one of those stage actors who
can t make it in american films 
anyway  after he died 
mr  wyler adopted her 
an owner s daughter  living
with a bookie 
that s something  isn t it 
she hates her mother 
treated her like a possession 
you know how it is to be one
of mrs  wyler s possessions 
i ll give you  10 000 right now 
pay your expenses 
and if you find her 
i ll give you  20 000 more 
you re crazy 
i m a football player 
without a team 
that new porsche of yours 
is it paid for 
what are you gonna do  man 
sell insurance 
you don t have the personality
to work for the networks 
i don t want you to bring
her back  man 
just find her  tell me where she is 
what does that take  time and money 
you got the time right now 
i got the money 
great 
you know  i ve never used
what i got on you 
could be otherwise 
i wouldn t want that  would you 
it s simple 
either you want to play
football again or you don t 
you never change  do you 
not a bit 
try mrs  wyler  she probably
knows where jessie is 
right 
if this is about you being cut   
   i don t involve myself with
day to day team business 
that s not why i came here 
mrs  wyler 
then suppose you tell me exactly
what you want with me  mr  brogan 
i m looking for your daughter 
we re very close  and she
disappeared all of a sudden 
give me a break 
what do you mean 
he sent you 
who 
jake   
   wise 
she was only with him to spite me 
i don t know what she did
to get away from him 
what matters is  she got
the hell away from him 
why not drink to that 
grace 
ed seems to have solved
the soames problem

we could consider something 
you know  it isn t easy for
jessica to hide from me 
she s been drawing from her trust 
it s going to a little bank in mexico 
to an island 
cozumel 
you could keep a watch on her 
make sure he gets nowhere
near her again 
you know   
   i used jake wise
as an excuse to come here 
i did come to get my job back 
i didn t deserve what i got 
i played some good ball 
i got a lot of good years left 
i want to be back on the team 
but because i m worth it 
not because i spied on some
25 year old who ran away from home 
i m not going to spy for you
or jake wise

i can kick myself out  thanks 
ten years  work  grace

is kind of crowding it 
i have to get some use out of them 
i don t like football

things to do  even in l a

maybe i ll be outside
having a drink   
   i ll look and out of nowhere
she ll be buying some fruit 
i ll call you in a few days 
all right 
see you  bye 
pretty slick  roberto 
okay  senor  cerveza  no glass 
i ve been hanging out here a lot  huh 
some hangout 
damn it 
where s that boat going 
tulum 
  when s the next ferry 
  six hours 
shit 
should i be afraid of you 
i don t know 
it s beautiful  huh 
if this were l a   my stepfather
would ve bought it 
torn it up and built condominiums 
here  the land intimidates them 
they leave it in peace 
some spot 
it s nothing like the great
maya cities of the yucatan 
chichen itza 
should have hidden there 
is that what you re doing 
hiding 
yep 
from you  right 
what do you mean 
jake sent you 
maybe your mother did 
i wouldn t know which one
had more to threaten you with 
you wanna know the truth 
i came for the hell of it 
i wanted to get out of l a 
a caribbean island didn t sound too bad 
only trouble is  now i m here
i find myself   
   in the middle of something
i ve no feeling for 
well  you re not doing this for free 
you re getting paid well 
aren t you 
which one are you working for 
which one knows you found me 
nobody knows anything  okay 
oh  sure 
i figure  fuck them  you know 
fuck you too  lady 
i loved your drawing 
i wanna talk to you 
talk 
why should i believe
you won t tell jake where i am 
there are people who care what you
believe  i don t see them here 
i have a broken shoulder 
both my knees are shot   
   guys are crippling themselves   
   so you can act like a
13 year old runaway from bel air 
i could give a shit what you believe 
  how s sam 
  who 
my dog 
i don t know 
looks like he s fed 
i shouldn t be afraid of you 
when you leaving 
i think 4 00 
i wish it were sooner 
never found where i live  did you 
i don t think anybody could 
it s the prettiest place
on the island 
don t leave without saying goodbye 
you take the highway out of town
to kilometre 19 
when you see the three tecate cans   
   it s the first dirt road
on the right 
don t leave without saying goodbye 
don t leave without saying goodbye 
you don t have to worry about
the neighbors 
they were building homes here
when a storm hit 
they all fell down except this one 
waited for you  huh 
like a drink 
all right  that d be great 
  tequila okay 
  that s great 
it s maya 
third century  i think 
no ice 
that s all right 
you don t have any electricity here 
propane 
how d you end up with jake 
the palace  i guess 
i wanted to be a
rock  n  roll singer 
jake convinced me that rich girls
don t have the soul for it 
sounds like jake  always convincing
somebody of something 
it seems i have the soul to
live with him  be his girlfriend 
he never had anybody
like you before 
you re a whole different class
for him 
not really 
my family didn t get to own most
of bel air by being honest 
jake always thought i was his luck 
i helped him outthink people
like my family 
i know why he wanted you 
but why were you with him 
i liked that my being with him
made a lot of people crazy 
like your mom 
it even frightened her 
and that was really something to
finally pull off 
if only my brother had done
that and not by killing himself 
your brother killed himself 
i guess 
he got into drugs
for the same reason i did 
to get away from our terrible life 
did his dying make you stop 
jake did 
jake did 
after i was with him awhile  it became
very important to him that i stop 
wouldn t leave me
alone until i quit 
the truth is i wanted to quit 
when i did  i didn t need
jake anymore 
bet that kind of threw him 
he said the only way i could
get away was to kill him 
well  you almost did 
not really 
i m gonna stay away from jake
