take a look into the hidden lives of creatures
that rule like lords
over one of the richest
ocean wilds on earth 
the journey is an attempt to peer
with a camera into a hidden kingdom
of killer whales in the pacific north west 
a long time goal of diver and
film maker theodore pitcairn 
his destination is an area
inhabited by about 300 killer whales
in the straits between
the british columbia mainland
and vancouver island 
travelling to film the unseen the
events of ocean life is a kind of
continuing pilgrimage for pitcairn 
i have come to appreciate that every
place in the ocean has its
own enchanting qualities 
here we enter a world of cold beauty 
of ice  mist and fog 
we have come here not
only to film killer whales 
but the ocean wilds in which they live 
i am curious to learn
what makes this ocean
habitat so special that hundreds
of orcas congregate here 
to humans  the ocean here
is unbearably cold 
i must protect myself from
its sting by wearing
a drysuit that seals
out the frigid water 
sometimes i can see only a few feet
away through the murk of
plankton and other particles 
powerful currents often buffet me about 
these cold water winds blow constantly
through the kelp forests of the bottom
so that the realm of the killer whale
seems like a place invented by animators
who can make plants seem
like a troupe of dancers 
amid the swirling cold currents  life abounds 
everywhere i point the camera
there is something looking back at me 
any shadowy corner can hold a surprise 
curiosity is not limited to our species 
sensing nothing either familiar or edible 
the octopus puts up his guard 
which for the most intelligent
of all molluscs means transforming
its smooth body into a facade of menace 
i know from experience it is not likely
to attack something as large as me 
it s just trying to look as fierce as possible 
when i don t appear terrified 
it is time to leave 
for good measure  he appears to booby
trap my path with a sunflower star 
perhaps thinking that this predator 
feared by other bottom creatures 
will also intimidate me 
to avoid frightening the octopus 
pitcairn moves off in
a different direction 
only to come upon another
strange creature 
it looks like a snake 
with the head of an old man 
its name   the wolf eel   suggests
ferociousness and its powerful
jaws can crush spiny urchins 
but  like the octopus 
it s not inclined to attack a human 
the wolf eel pair pay pitcairn little notice 
preoccupied with courtship
and their version of nuzzling 
the dive is interrupted suddenly
by a reminder that pitcairn is in
the home waters of killer whales 
which are often heard before they are seen 
through the murk of this sea
they have detected my presence
and at first  seem curious 
but one look and they are satisfied 
they return to the middle of the strait
and go on about their business 
maybe they just prefer
their own company 
they are almost always
seen in groups
and rarely linger nearly a diver like me 
which makes it difficult to
observe their daily lives 
maybe this group is moving
from one good fishing area to the next 
they are so skilful in hunting fish
that they seem to have ample time
simply to relax and to do very little at all 
other creatures in the
killer whale realm below
must survive by eating organic
matter blowing by in
the endless currents 
like this nudibranch  
a kind of snail without a shell 
each invents its own way of
capturing morsels of food 
sweeping the water with
its umbrella like bonnet 
the hooded nudibranch
acts like a fisherman 
casting a net to catch passing plankton 
the sea pen simply stands in the current 
allowing bits of food to
lodge in its plume like body 
the basket star  an animal that
looks like a small bush in winter 
snags passing food with it branches 
barnacles scoop through the water
with their feathery back legs
and eat whatever they catch 
sometimes the underwater
breezes deliver a windfall 
the jellyfish can rise
and descend by pulsing 
but its direction through the sea
is determined mostly by the currents 
pretty as a flower  the tentacles
of the anemone are not only sticky
but armed with powerful stinging cells 
it s a sitting predator  awaiting whatever
the currents might send in its direction 
the jellyfish may have travelled
hundreds of miles to get here 
but once in the grasp of
the an anemone  its journey is over 
killer whales are not the
only formidable creatures here 
but through size and intelligence 
they dominate this undersea world 
as strikingly as humans do the land 
to better understand them 
pitcairn seeks out someone
who knows them intimately 
biologist john ford spends
his entire professional life
watching and pondering
the culture of killer whales or orcas 
he has done so since the early 70s 
like an anthropologist studying an ocean tribe 
few know them as well 
or have made so many
discoveries about their way of life 
day after day he observes 
records  photographs 
accumulating over decades
a catalogue that identifies
not only individual whales 
but entire family trees 
the calls of the whales are
often loud enough to be
heard from the boat and
ford has learned to pay
special attention to these sounds 
studying underwater recordings 
ford was among the first to
recognise that killer whales
communicate in dialects distinctive
to each family group or pod 
an individual s family heritage can be
determined from the unique calls it makes 
to catalogue the identity of every
individual whale he encounters 
ford records distinguishing
characteristics and assigns
both names and numbers 
37 and 46 they are two brothers 
just swimming together 
just relaxing with a bellyful
of chum salmon and enjoying
themselves and enjoying this boat 
how close they want to get 
for all the years of observation 
researchers like ford are
still baffled by a great
deal of killer whale behaviour 
the whale that was flipper
slapping and tail slapping
and following us along there was
a64  schooner  just a juvenile 
not really sure what whales are
doing when they make those
kind of behaviours because it
depends on the context and
there is always kind of a curious
thing to me when all the rest
of the whales in the area are
just going about their business
and one individual like that one
seems agitated or worked up
about something and displays
these kind of things
over and over again for
sometimes hours at a time 
because monitoring from a
boat is limited by weather 
ford has installed a permanent
sound monitoring system 
linked to a transmitter 
it broadcasts continuously
to his office the world s first
all killer whale radio station 
the live signal from the robson bight
area coming down to the vancouver
aquarium here by a high quality digital line 
so we are listening as if we were in our
little boat with a hydrophone at robson bight 
but instead we are down here
200 miles to the south  listening live 
this is actually a catalogue of the
calls that the whales make 
so we can match up the patterns this way 
so when it goes that
that is a n4 call 
young animals that are
born into the pod learn
those unique family dialects 
their vocal dialects represent
a kind of a family acoustic badge
that identify the pod and help to
keep the integrity and the
identity of the pod together 
my goal is to film them underwater
in their own fluid realm 
to try to convey how the
world looks and feels to them 
while they don t seem to like
swimming close to divers 
they often like to be near boats 
so we experiment with a camera
suspended on a pole  hoping
to get some close up views
of these wary creatures 
we get a few tantalising glimpses
through the murk  but not
everything we hoped for 
we will have to find a location
where they are more at ease
and devise a way to place our
camera in their world without
attracting their attention and suspicion 
as the camera team deliberates
over how best to film killer whales 
an immense change is underway
in the kingdom the whales
rule beneath the surface 
spring arrives in this world
of shadows and ghostly white anemones 
marked by the appearance of strange
matter adrift in the currents 
it s the stuff of life 
and it is everywhere 
a female sea cucumber prepares to launch
a bundle of eggs 
nearby  a male has begun to eject sperm 
conception among most
bottom dwellers occurs
not through intimacy with a mate 
but by blindly discharging
the elements of new life into
the passing currents 
the drifting eggs or sperm
of each individual will mix
with other reproductive cells
in a moment of fertilisation 
the ocean itself is the womb 
throughout the coastal seas 
creatures of the ocean floor
cast the seeds of their next
generation into the liquid breezes 
turning the ocean into a
soup of reproductive matter 
but a great percentage
of the spawn sent off by
creatures like the slime sea star 
is likely to be intercepted 
for hungry finish and filter feeders 
the seeds of new life are
just another kind of food
to pluck from the currents 
the killer whales are mostly just observers
their world explodes each march
with a rush of predators 
dolphins  harbour seal
seabirds and sea lions
all attracted to a massive spawning
event that overshadows
those of the bottom dwellers 
tens of millions of herring
stream from the open
pacific toward the british
columbia shoreline to spawn 
to get there they must make
it through a gauntlet of carnivores 
panicked by the appearance of predators 
each fish seeks safety in
the middle of the school 
producing what looks like
a giant silver organism 
trying desperately to find a safe
path to its spawning grounds 
i encounter so many things
in the sea that could not occur on land 
in the dense embrace of water 
a thousand weightless creatures
whirl and dart side by side
like an artwork come to life 
i drift beneath it  mesmerised 
the local people call it simply a fish ball 
belying the elegant symmetry
and beauty of what i see down here 
the relentless attacks by birds 
sea mammals and larger fish continue 
but the herring are unable
to turn seaward and flee 
programmed by their genes to spawn 
they have no alternative
but to push onward to the shallows 
the assault from above escalates 
in these shallow waters
there is no place to hide 
gulls wait at the surface 
murres and cormorants dive
deep enough to strike from
the sides and below 
for a time  the annual herring
frenzy so dominates life along the coast 
that it attracts even migratory
grey whales into the
realm of the killer whales 
among the patches of seafoam
fringing the shore  another kind of white
phenomenon appears signalling
that throngs of male herrings
have begun to disperse their
sperm into the sea 
in places the shallows turn milk white 
the release of these clouds of sperm
or milt triggers a reproductive frenzy 
the females try to press their eggs
into the milt deposited by
the males on the bottom 
all the while  the milt drifts upward
in such volume that vision becomes difficult 
a single female can produce 25 000 eggs
the result is an undersea blizzard
of almost incomprehensible proportions 
sticky white herring
eggs encrust virtually
every surface of the shallows 
from eel grass and rocks
to crab shells 
nearly all of the eggs will be
lost to predators and the whims of the sea 
but if only one in every 5000
produces an adult 
the herring population will be sustained 
for gulls  the appearance of
herring means a season of plenty 
each receding tide uncovers a feast of eggs 
there is such a profusion of nourishment 
that the grey whales come all
the way into the shallows to partake 
raking the eel grass
with its baleen plates 
one of the largest creatures in the sea
feeds on eggs the
size of bird seed 
though most of the herring
return to deeper waters 
some die of wounds or stress 
the sunflower star takes
care of those left behind 
oddities appear under water
during the herring spawning 
a hemlock tree seems to grow
from the bottom of the sea 
observing the annual herring
feast over centuries 
native peoples sought ways
of exploiting it for human food 
they discovered that spawning
herring were attracted to
hemlock for some reason 
along the west coast of vancouver island 
the hesquiat tribe still harvests eggs
deposited on the hemlock branches
they set up early each spring in
advance of the spawning 
like their ancestors 
present day hesquiats treasure
the herring caviar as a delicacy 
their harvest is purely
for tribal consumption 
but a taste for herring eggs
is not limited to native people here 
in another cove  spawning herring
pass among kelp fronds
strung artificially on lines 
the ahousaht and toquat
peoples of vancouver island
have modified their traditional
herring harvests to take advantage
of the great demand for
herring eggs elsewhere 
in japan  herring roe is a
delicacy that commands high prices 
the tribes and some non
native fishermen as well 
catch schools of herring
using fishing nets 
then transfer them into netted enclosures
where they spawn on the kelp fronds 
the captive herring school attracts
nonhuman harvesters as well 
river otters descend from nearby
streams to fill their bellies with herring 
working under commercial licences 
each year the two native tribes can
each collect as much as
40 tonnes of eggs on kelp 
what is merely food for otters
is big business for humans 
such commercial harvests
can be worth millions of dollars 
egg laden kelp fronds are salted 
packed and shipped by air to japan today 
though the industry arose in the 1970s 
such trading actually began a century ago 
when japanese entrepreneurs obtained
herring eggs from tribes father north
along the coast and sailed with
them all away across the pacific 
yet the commercialism is mixed
with an ancient respect
for the cycles of nature 
when the harvest ends 
the nets walling the inclusion are opened 
permitting the herring to escape
in the hope they will return
and spawn again next spring 
though killer whales nibble
at the spawning schools 
herring make up less than 5  of their diet 
they are awaiting a spawning
event still to come that will bring
their favourite prey into these waters 
yet as the killer whales mark time 
the greatest exploitation
of the herring is about to begin 
it dwarfs the hunting by ocean animals
and the harvesting by natives
and vancouver island harbour s
commercial fishing boats await
the start of a different kind of herring frenzy 
the opening of the herring season
is the beginning of an ocean goldrush 
to prevent overfishing 
authorities stringently limit
the commercial herring season 
often to only a single daily each year 
sometimes to only one hour 
one hour in which many fishermen
must haul in most of their fishing
income for the entire year 
so valuable is the fishery that luck
can bring boat owners a near 
fortune in a day and failure
can mean bankruptcy 
it s a high stakes drama in
which not a second can be lost 
after racing to find a
school using sonar 
they must quickly encircle it
with the same net 
then draw the net tight 
often catching more than herring 
making money on herring
requires spending it 
a seiner and its complement of equipment
can cost a million and a half dollars 
but  depending on luck and skill 
in their brief window of opportunity 
they may pull in anywhere
from 20 to 200 tonnes of herring 
the only market is japan 
and prices fluctuate with
the japanese economy 
there have been years
when the catch of a single boat
brought in a quarter of million dollars 
an unintended catch of large
mammals can mean damaged
nets and panicked animals 
the fishermen give the sea lions
every opportunity to escape 
and one by one  they all do 
herring return to the same
waters each years to spawn 
if too many are caught 
those waters will be
barren in future years 
already  some areas no
longer support a fishery
and there are debates over
whether the herring population
is being jeopardised by too much fishing 
so intense is the rush to haul in fish 
captains can imperil both their boats
and crews by overloading 
even large vessels can be
overturned by 200 tonnes of fish in their net 
the catch of herring for their eggs
is one of the main drivers
of british colombia s fishing economy 
but unlike the harvest by
marine animals and native tribes 
no herring survive to return to the sea 
the eggs will be taken from dead
females for sale to japan 
the tonnes of remaining herring carcasses
will be sold not as human food 
but for the most part  as fertiliser 
as spring turns to summer 
the flood of life awaited
by the killer whales approaches
from the open sea 
salmon by the millions in wave after wave 
the killer whales residing along
this coast prefer salmon
above all other foods 
to catch them  pod members
spread out and comb the area 
they send out sonar like high
frequency clicks that echo off
objects in the sea 
giving them an acoustic means of detecting
their prey through murky waters 
through summer and into fall 
those salmon that survive seek out
their natal streams and
begin a difficult journey
against currents and rapids 
having survived killer whales 
they now meet a terrestrial equivalent 
but survival is not their purpose 
after spawning  all the salmon will die 
adult grizzlies and their cubs shun
the dead fish in search of those still alive 
in the meantime 
they snack on the salmon eggs
that are in the bottom 
when more salmon arrived 
the bears feast relentlessly 
grizzlies face a deadline
as fall approaches 
to survive the long sleep of winter 
they must pack on
as much fat as possible 
some gain 300 pounds or more
most of the weight coming
from long days of eating salmon 
it can be both filling 
and exhausting 
for john ford  salmon season
provides an opportunity to learn
more about killer whale feeding
techniques and preferences 
an experienced eye sees
a capture in a quick lunge 
time has shown that the
killer whales hunt all six
of the salmon species found here 
it looked to me like a chum 
about the right size 
and it was quite a prolonged
chase there  huh 
we saw them take a chum salmon 
very likely there is
a big run of chum
salmon coming through
this strait today and we managed
to get a scale sample from that kill 
and we will be able to identify
what species it is from the
unique quality of the scale 
as if from nowhere 
a pack of white sided
dolphins appears 
interrupting the
killer whale hunt 
the dolphins rocket about 
bothering the whales
like a gang of rowdy youngsters 
it s an odd mingling
of two marine mammals 
but ford sees it often 
those dolphins like to pester the whales 
we see them doing it to
humpback whales  as well 
where they will chase them
around and smack them with
their tails and just generally
be kind of pesky 
for whatever reason 
suddenly  and inexplicably 
the dolphin pack disappears 
other sea mammals in the
vicinity seem to be on alert 
as if some kind of menace approaches 
the menace is real 
a pack of aggressive
killer whales passes through 
driving harbour seals ashore
more nomadic than the resident
whales of the region
and travelling in smaller families 
these transients also prefer
the meat of sea lions
and dolphins to fish 
distinguished by tall 
pointed dorsal fins 
these mammal eaters don t seem
to mingle with their
fish eating cousins 
evidence of the often violent
ways of transients can be graphic 
biologist cathy heisey
examines the body of
a dead dolphin found
at sea by a boater 
like the pack that interrupted the hunt 
it is a white sided dolphin 
i can tell you for certain that
it was killed by a killer whale
just judging by the teeth rake
marks on its body 
and whether it was killed
by transient killer whales
or resident killer whales
i can t tell you  but my guess
is that it is transients 
because they are the only
ones that we have seen
fatally attacking animals 
and what is surprising to
me is that they didn t eat
it because they obviously
injured it and perhaps
played with it even for a
while after they killed it
just judging by the different
types of rake marks that are on its body
they are all different angles
and are all quite deep 
until the early 1970s 
the realm of killer whales
in british colombia lay mostly
beyond the interests of humanity 
but the curiosity of scientists
and film makers has since fuelled a
popular fascination with
these intelligent creatures 
people come from around the world 
hoping to catch a glimpse of wild orcas 
identification catalogues enable
them to learn the name and family
history of the creatures they watch 
some learn for the first time that
the swimmers before them are
travelling families whose social relationships
are among the most complex
of any mammals on earth 
a family like this is led by a mother
and all of her young will remain
with her as long as she lives 
approaching the boat is
not just a juvenile whale
it s someone s daughter 
sister  granddaughter 
but no matter how close observers get 
they see only that tiny fraction of
the killer  whale s existence that
takes place in our world of air 
pitcairn and his friends have
devised a plan to peer 
at least briefly into the hidden
part of killer whale existence 
by going where other visitors cannot 
in these undisturbed waters 
we come upon a family bound
somewhere through the
morning mist and cold 
for a moment they don t seem
like mighty predators
just a family on a lonely journey 
pitcairn s destination
appears unremarkable 
a beach covered by a bed of smooth
pebbles that extends out into the shallows 
but  in fact  it is a special place where
killer whales may let down their guard 
in hopes of capturing a few moments of
killer whale behaviour here 
the team arrives with an
arsenal of equipment 
pitcairn and his team have secured
special permission to film in this
ecological reserve a whale sanctuary
off limits to whale watchers 
to avoid disturbing the whales 
no diver will enter the water 
only a remotely controlled camera 
the underwater cameraman
must learn to practise his craft
sitting on dry land before a
miniature steering wheel 
the team will set up camp 
then wait to see if any whales show up 
as they prepare  killer whales sounds
arise just offshore   an auspicious sign 
they toss a hydrophone into the water 
pitcairn s worry is that the effort
will turn out to be a waste of time 
this is his second attempt 
the previous year 
the team waited three weeks
and no whales ever showed up 
every precaution has been taken
to avoid disrupting killer whale behaviour 
but there is no way to know
if the wary animals will shy away 
even from an untended camera 
the wait begins 
on only the second day 
they sight a killer whale family 
rounding the point headed toward them 
the underwater microphones
pick up the raspy sound of a
whale scraping against the bottom 
the area is called a rubbing beach
because killer whales frequently
seek it out to rub their bodies
against the bed of pebbles 
no one is sure why 
their markings show them
to be a family well known
to scientists in the area 
a 52 year old matriarch named stripe 
her three children and a grandson 
the tallest fin belongs to
her 28 year old son okey solo
the most enthusiastic among them
when it comes to rubbing 
her 18 year old daughter ripple
has a two year old son of her own 
midsummer  who seems reluctant to rub 
but follows his mother
when she makes a pass across the bottom 
children at play 
adults enjoying a relaxing swim 
it seems the undersea equivalent
of a family day at the beach 
though stripe also rubs occasionally 
the matriarch stays close to be her
grandson and youngest son 
seven year old fife 
stripe knows how quickly
tragedy can strike 
over the years  she has
lost three of her young 
one captured for a marine park 
one struck by a ferry 
one to unknown causes 
little midsummer continues
to frolic of the beach 
but he won t dare descend
to rub the bottom 
his uncle  on the other hand 
can t get enough 
an adult male like okey solo
may have fathered young of his own 
but they remain with their
mothers in other family groups 
okey solo will not leave his
own mother all of her life 
some males simply disappear
when their mother dies 
no killer whales in the world 
other than the 200 living around northern
vancouver island  are known to rub like this 
we are as puzzled as other observers
why do they rub 
some believe it is a way of
scraping away parasites 
but if so  wouldn t killer whales
elsewhere do the same thing 
perhaps we try too hard to find
practical explanations for
behaviour in the wild 
maybe the killer whale families here
have simply found a way to have fun 
something that just feels good 
and across generations
they have passed on
this little tradition
of pleasure and the whereabouts
of these pebble beaches 
it s their secret 
and we are peeking into the place
in their world where they can
escape the labours
of daily survival
for an occasional hour
of amusement 
as the others watch from offshore
okey solo returns for one last rub
perhaps inspired by his uncle 
little midsummer finally descends
for his first pass over the pebbles 
rubbing and blowing bubbles
at the same time 
watching their last pass
across the stones 
i am reminded yet again 
hat we can t really comprehend
the minds of creatures
who dwell in a liquid world 
so different from our own 
and yet we share with them 
the concerns of parenthood
and the devotion to family
and maybe also a need for sheer fun 
at least that s what
i would like to believe 
it is one thing to observe
anonymous animals in the wild 
quite another to know them by name 
to know their ways of relaxing 
to know even their family tragedies 
as they leave
