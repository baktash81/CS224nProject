in the wake of this afternoons widespread blackout
there has been some inclement weather in the region
problems seem linked to what authorities
are calling a catastrophic power surge
that has crippled traffic in the area

i think thats acceptable
youre lucky to be here at all

and i saved your life by bringing you here
i dont understand
theres been an attack
what
an attack a big one
im not sure yet if its chemical or nuclear
but down here were safe
and where are we exactly
underneath my farmhouse
40 miles outside of lake charles
i   was driving north of here
you were in an accident
you were turned over on the side of the road
i was driving by and i saw you
i saved your life michelle
i couldnt just leave you there
thank you so much for saving my life  i
i guess i should i should go to a hospital now
you cant leave
an attack means all of them
which contaminates the air above ground
thats thats how it works
how how long do we have to wait until its safe
depends on the proximity to the closest blast
one year maybe two
and thats if were were talking
about weapons that we know of
russians were developing some nasty stuff
and it the martians finally found a way to get here
their weapons will will make our nukes
look like like sticks and stones
luckily
i prepared for this
i need to use your phone then
to call my family
and and tell them that im safe here
and make sure theyre okay
michelle theyre not okay
how do you know that
everyone outside of here is dead
what about you
dont you have a family

little bit of appreciation

god oh shit
im sorry
sorry about that  i didnt mean to
scare you
you hmm  hmm you hungry
so howre you doing huh  you okay
what is this
its a bunker
your room is a bit of a fixerupper but
at least you got the door
a scary door but you still got the door
how long have you been down here
a couple of days i think  you know
its actually kind of hard to tell
no windows the sunlight and everything
i mean how do we get out of here
he didnt tell you
about
getting out of here
is the last thing you want to do
cause the air out there
its contaminated
i see youve met emmett
what happened to him
he did that to himself
and his stumbling around isnt helping anything
what you heard earlier
was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole weeks worth of food
which hes sorry for correct
totally
lets go  bathroom time
this is the common are  good for rr
as you can see ive planned for a long stay
the applaponic system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh
this is the living room
help yourself to any reading
if you like to watch films
i have some on dvd and vhs cassette
just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when theyre done
the kitchen is fully functional theres
an electric stove refrigerator
freezer silverware
and that table is a family heirloom
which means watch your glasses
always use coasters and placemats
keep you hands to yourself
understand
no touching
take a seat
this way
this is my private space
offlimits
unless i give express permission
go ahead
nah i dont need to
you will though
and ive got to pace these things out
so please
i need privacy
youre welcome to close the curtain
i cant with you standing there
and i cant trust you not to burn this
place down this is for my own safety
im not some  pervert  just go
dont flush unless youve gone
cant afford wasting flushes
take a seat
are you hungry
those are megans
she never went anywhere without two
or three of those things
whos megan
megans not with us anymore
dont worry  just the generator
maybe its a car up front
thats not possible
i heard one earlier
above my room
if you had heard a car
the driver would be long dead by now
shouldnt we at least try
to call the police
someone to find out what actually happened
theres no one left to call
see that  nothings coming through
you think i sound crazy
its amazing you people
you wear helmets when you ride your bikes
you have seatbelts
youre in your cars
you have alarm systems to protect your homes
but what do you do when those alarms go off
crazy is building your ark after
the flood is already come
i think now might be time you
met frank and mildred
closest i can get to in airlock
see
what happened to them
they werent as lucky as you
its the air michelle
thats what happens when you get exposed
i keep this door sealed at all times
no one comes in or out
met frank and mildred huh
its funny right
the whole world ends  and the things hes
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs
you gonna need some  uh reading material
thats all there is  sorry
my idead of how to learn to do
a french braid so
if you want me to do that for you
just let me know
what do you know about him
he was in the navy i know that
i guess he did uh
some stuff with satellites
what kinds of stuff
satellite  stuff
and what brought him out here
im not sure
he bought this property a whle back
i never paid much attention until he
hired me to help him get this place set up
the work was uh
entertaining though thats for sure
you know howard is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories
plus you know how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker
he  kidnapped you
no
what happened to your arm
you were trying to escape
i was trying to get in
and i watched howard build this
place piece by piece for years
he was always talking about
you know possible attacks
alqeda russia south korea
you mean north korea
the the is that the korean one
yeah that one  hmm
and hmm you know pour all his money into this
place took to it like his life depended on it
which you know
that stays with you
so
he told all this
while youre building his bomb shelter
and now he says that
the air is contaminated and everybodys dead
yeah i know what youre getting at
but theres more to it
howard abducted me
he drove me off the road
and he dragged me here
so whatever hes telling you
about the  air
some big attack the purpose of this shelter is a lie
no no way
the attack i saw it myself
what do you mean
coming on my way from work
and looked like a flash
bright red
like an explosion from way far off
wasnt like fireworks
no it was more this like something
your read about in the bible
so what you saw was a flashing light
lightning
fire that cleared up
im not  explaining it right
this wasnt like anything ive ever seen
right here
above us
did you hear someone
right over me
thats impossible
the the air is
what its contaminated
how do you know that
because i told him
dinners ready
i see you two are getting along
hows that sauce
its fine
as cooks go im okay
not great but okay
megan was a good cook
youll learn a little cooking
its delicious
its the best sauce i ever tasted

considering the alternative
which is you know
get burned up in a chemical
attack or nuclear
i say being alive and down here is
its made a fried turd taste
pretty good so
best damn sauce i ever had
and  you point
and please watch your language at the table
right
you know what i havent been able to
get out of my head for some reason
ever since i got down here
tatoos
i always wanted one
but i never got any  because everyone always said nah no
emmett youll never get a decent job if you got it
whatever
like that matters now right
tell you what i had know this was coming

i have something to confess to you
i crashed into your car
your accident
was my fault
when i found out about the incoming
attack i got frantic
i knew i needed to get back here
as soon as possible
oh i was driving like a maniac
i tried to pass you and
im the reason you went off the road
and i know i seem like a sensible guy
but at the time i wasnt myself
it was an accident  but it was my fault
i was afraid to tell you
im sorry
you should shower
you had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges could be toxic
these are megans
if you want them
i recognize that womans car
her name was leslie i think
you knew her
she was a neighbor
emmett wasnt the only one
that knew about this place
if any others somehow survived
they could be coming here too
as of friday kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs
im going to need some stitches
why you want me to
this is your doing isnt it
i mean
i dont think im really qualified
ill walk you through it
here
have a drink
what is it
technically its
vodka
safe  i distill it myself
i just said i distill it i didnt say anything
about it tasting good  yeah thats awful
you want it on the rocks
little trick i taught myself as a young man
stationed on a ship with way too much free time
every now and again if the co was working us
too hard wed freeze and snap the knob off
the bathroom door while they were still inside
i guess it took an hour or two to get out
im good
suit yourself  cheers
this is clean
all you need to do is  stitch
youre doing fine
stuff i grabbed from your car
didnt have time to bring in the booze
sadly
what is all that
i wanted to design clothes
no wonder you were so good with the stiches
megan wanted to be an artist
she was your daughter
yeah
she was smart loved to read
the magazines or just for fun
she inhaled books
anything with paris
she liked their movies
their culture you know
we used to have this little joke
every once in a while id ask her
what do you want to be
when you grow up
and you know what shed say
french
anyway
her mother turned her against me
took her off to chicago
people are strange creatures
you cant always convince them that
safety is in their own  best interest
you dont know theyre gone
anyway
at least i tried to help them
hey you know there is nothing
you couldve done for that woman
even if you had let her in
she still wouldve died
you asked earlier about  regrets
yeah i got some of those
welcome to the club
i mean i lived my life
in a 40mile radius
and that was by design
i made sure that happened
i was so fast in high school
i even managed to outrun my bad grades
i was allstate track
three years in a row
caught a full ride to louisiana tech
up there in ruston
i remember i spent the last
two weeks of that summer
showing off the bus ticket they
sent me to anybody who looked at it
and then came the night
before i was supposed to leave
and i just got so worried
about how bad i was
going to do up there
with all those smart kids
so i went out of my way
to get just pissed wasted so bad that
there was no chance i was waking
up in in the morning
so i missed the bus
i didnt buy a ticket for the next one
or the one after that
well if youd gone
you might be dead now
well lucky me right
lucky us
a few a few years ago
i was at a hardware store
and there was this little girl
with her dad
and he was in a hurry
and she wasnt keeping up
and he kept
yanking on her arm
really hard you know
too hard
you know that feeling
when my dad got that way
my brother collin was always there
to take the worst of it
for me
and after seeing that little girl
i thought maybe i could
do that
for her
but i just kept watching
and they were about to leave
and id done nothing
and
she slips
and it throws him out offbalance
and he hits her
and i wanted so badly to do something
to help her but
i do what i always do
when things get hard
i just panicked and ran
look
were here were alive
and that means something
got it
youve got to be kidding me
what
were missing pieces here
look at this poor cat
hes been deformed
hes got one eye
about to go snorkling and
everything too
what are you doing
ooh cornering the market on
postapocalyptic fashion huh
needs more axes and chainsaws
for what she has a shotgun
yeah what if up there its like
tracks
zombies
though even howard doesnt think that ones possible
though you should hear his theory
about mutant spaceworms
what is that howard
stay calm were okay
what was that
quiet
that sounds like helicopters
could be military
but not ours
how can you tell
14 years in the navy
whats happening up there
my guess those flashes that kicked
this all off
that was phase 1
take out your opponents population centers
with big hits all at once
fast
and then for round 2
ground sweeps
the satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently
possibly extraterrestrial signals
i bet what we just heard were airborne
patrols sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life
like us
okay oh boy
thats bad
and thats worse
what was up there
air filtration system
i cant something is
blocking the hedge
if we cant get it back up were
gonna run out of breathable air fast
youre the only one
small enough to reach it
reach what
the filtration system
through there the main duct
someone needs to get in there
and restart it
give me a hand
let me go in she wont know her way around
you wont fit plus your arm shell be fine
now to restart the unit you just
swing the handle off and on off and on
that should do it
and neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck
dont get stuck
michelle
everything okay up there
looks like a dead end
thats the incline
climb up that
and youre almost there
oh this sucks
help
whats wrong
he lied to you he lied about megan
what do you mean
i think he did something horrible to her
how
his family moved to chicago
years ago
whats this
is that blood
come with me
wait is that
she went missing two years back
it was on the news and everything
most people just thought she skipped town
there is a message up there
it said help it was scratched on the inside of the window
this earring was with it
did she ever show up after she went missing
he said to me he said to my face
he said this is his daughter he said this
he took her and he killed her
i was just thinking
maybe we
take away his gun
tie him up to confess whatever it is hes done
what confess to who the police
look like i said
we cant be the only survivors right
the woman she was able to get
around a little right  yeah till she died
directly above us choking to death
other people to save
now thats a great example of teamwork
very well done
feel like some music
problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood
michelle
you should go shower just in case
sure
soundtrack
the exciters vonda shepard  tell him 1962
i think i might have an idea
10 better ways to style my bangs
no not the article  this
i think i can only make one
but its a start
no kidding
hey howard
what is this
youre rewatching 16 candles
pretty in pink
it was one of megans favorite movies
can i help you with something
no no im just grabbing some water
say ahmm
you know i was just thinking
not that im trying to tell
you how to run this place
but i am just
a bit curious
about michelle
say how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit
you think she touched it
yeah im pretty sure she touched it
yeah i know she cleaned up after and
everything but im just thinking
given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside
if she tracked anything back in with
her it would be pretty concentrated
and
could be all over the shower
and the sink bathroom right now
well anyways its just a thought
not bad so far partner
if howard find this hes going
to kill us
alright so we get the gun away from him
tie him up make sure
he isnt going anywhere

just
goes out and looks for help
