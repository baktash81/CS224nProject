in the wake of this afternoon s widespread blackout  
there has been some inclement weather in the region 
problems seem linked to what authorities
are calling a catastrophic power surge 
that has crippled traffic in the area

you need fluids 
you were in shock 
what re you going to do to me 
i m going to keep you alive

my boyfriend was expecting me 
he ll send the cops looking 
i m sorry   
but no one is looking for you 
you got some fight in you

my generosity only extends    so far 
eggs 
tylenol to help with your pain 
please    please    just let me go 
  please 
  there s nowhere to go  michelle 
that looks pretty       
given it as how i saved your life 
i think that s acceptable 
you re lucky to be here at all 
  what do you mean 
  i found you 
and i saved your life  by bringing you here 
i don t understand 
there s been an attack 
what 
an attack  a big one 
i m not sure yet if it s chemical  or nuclear 
but down here we re safe 
and where are we  exactly 
underneath my farmhouse 
40 miles outside of lake charles 
  i     was driving north of here 
  you were in an accident 
you were turned over on the side of the road 
i was driving by  and i saw you 
i saved your life  michelle 
i couldn t just leave you there 
thank you so much  for saving my life   i   
i guess i should  i should go to a hospital  now 
you can t leave 
an attack means all of them 
which contaminates the air above ground 
that s  that s how it works 
how  how long do we have to wait until it s safe 
depends on the proximity to the closest blast 
one year  maybe two 
and that s if we re  we re talking
about weapons that we know of 
russians were developing some nasty stuff 
and it the martians finally found a way to get here 
their weapons will  will make our nukes
look like  like sticks and stones 
luckily 
i prepared for this 
i need to use your phone  then 
to call my family 
and  and tell them that i m safe here 
  and make sure they re okay 
  michelle  they re not okay 
how do you know that 
everyone outside of here is dead 
what about you 
don t you have a family 
no
who s that 
excuse me 
what is it now 
wait 
you know what  michelle 
i m going to tell you  what i told him  
you need to eat  you need to sleep 
and you need to start showing me a
little bit of appreciation 
my name is howard  by the way 
god  oh shit 
i m sorry 
sorry about that   i didn t mean to   
scare you 
you  hmm   hmm  you hungry 
so how re you doing  huh   you okay 
what is this 
it s a bunker 
your room is a bit of a fixer upper  but   
at least you got the door 
a scary door  but you still got the door 
how long have you been down here 
a couple of days  i think   you know 
it s actually kind of hard to tell 
no windows  the sunlight  and everything 
i mean  how do we get out of here 
he didn t tell you 
about   
getting out of here 
is the last thing you want to do 
cause the air out there 
it s contaminated 
i see you ve met emmett
  what happened to him 
  he did that to himself 
and his stumbling around isn t helping anything 
what you heard earlier 
was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week s worth of food 
which he s sorry for  correct 
totally 
let s go   bathroom time 
this is the common are   good for r r 
as you can see  i ve planned for a long stay 
the applaponic      system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh 
this is the living room 
help yourself to any reading 
if you like to watch films 
i have some on dvd and vhs cassette 
just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they re done 
the kitchen is fully functional  there s
an electric stove  refrigerator 
freezer  silverware 
and that table is a family heirloom 
which means watch your glasses 
always use coasters and placemats 
keep you hands to yourself 
understand 
no touching 
take a seat 
this way 
this is my private space
off limits 
unless i give express permission 
go ahead 
  nah  i don t need to 
  you will though 
and i ve got to pace these things out 
so please 
  i need privacy 
  you re welcome to close the curtain 
i can t with you standing there 
and i can t trust you not to burn this
place down  this is for my own safety 
i m not some    pervert   just go 
don t flush unless you ve gone 
can t afford wasting flushes 
take a seat 
are you hungry 
those are megan s 
she never went anywhere without two
or three of those things 
who s megan 
megan s not with us anymore 
don t worry   just the generator 
maybe it s a car up front 
  that s not possible 
   i heard one earlier 
above my room 
if you had heard a car 
the driver would be long dead by now 
shouldn t we at least try
   to call the police 
  someone to find out what actually happened 
  there s no one left to call 
see that   nothing s coming through 
you think i sound crazy 
it s amazing  you people  
you wear helmets when you ride your bikes 
you have seat belts 
you re in your cars 
you have alarm systems to protect your homes 
but what do you do when those alarms go off 
crazy  is building your ark after
the flood is already come 
i think now might be time you
met frank and mildred 
closest i can get to in airlock 
see 
what happened to them 
they weren t as lucky as you 
it s the air  michelle 
that s what happens when you get exposed 
i keep this door sealed  at all times 
no one comes in or out 
met frank and mildred  huh 
it s funny  right 
the whole world ends   and the thing s he s
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs 
you gonna need some    uh  reading material 
that s all there is        sorry 
my idead of how to learn to do
a french braid  so  
if you want me to do that for you 
just let me know 
what do you know about him 
he was in the navy  i know that 
i guess he did  uh 
some stuff with satellites 
what kinds of stuff 
satellite    stuff 
and what brought him out here 
i m not sure 
he bought this property a whle back 
i never paid much attention  until he
hired me to help him get this place set up 
the work  was  uh  
entertaining  though  that s for sure 
you know  howard  is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories 
plus  you know  how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker 
he    kidnapped you 
no 
what happened to your arm 
you were trying to escape 
i was trying to get in 
and i watched howard build this
place  piece by piece  for years 
he was always talking about  
you know  possible attacks 
al qeda  russia  south korea 
  you mean north korea 
  the  the   is that the korean one 
yeah  that one   hmm   
and  hmm  you know  pour all his money into this
place  took to it  like his life depended on it 
which    you know 
that stays with you 
so 
he told all this 
while you re building his bomb shelter 
and now he says that   
the air is contaminated  and everybody s dead 
yeah  i know what you re getting at 
but there s more to it 
howard abducted me 
he drove me off the road 
and he dragged me here 
so whatever he s telling you
about the    air 
  some big attack  the purpose of this shelter  is a lie 
  no  no way 
the attack  i saw it myself 
what do you mean 
coming on my way from work 
and  looked like a flash 
bright red 
like an explosion  from way far off 
wasn t like fireworks 
no  it was more this like something
your read about in the bible 
so what you saw was a flashing light 
lightning 
  fire that cleared up 
  i m not    explaining it right 
this wasn t like anything i ve ever seen 
right here 
above us 
did you hear someone 
right over me       
that s impossible 
  the  the air  is   
  what  it s contaminated 
  how do you know that 
  because i told him 
dinner s ready 
i see you two are getting along 
how s that sauce 
  it s fine 
  as cooks go  i m okay 
not great  but okay 
megan was a good cook 
you ll learn a little cooking 
it s delicious 
it s the best sauce i ever tasted 
are you being funny 
no  i mean   
considering the alternative 
which is  you know  
get burned up in a chemical
attack  or nuclear   
i say being alive  and down here is   
it s made a fried turd taste
pretty good  so  
best damn sauce i ever had 
and       you point 
and please watch your language at the table 
right 
you know what i haven t been able to
get out of my head  for some reason 
ever since i got down here 
tatoos 
i always wanted one 
but i never got any   because everyone always said  nah  no 
emmett you ll never get a decent job if you got it 
whatever
like that matters now  right 
tell you what  i had know this was coming 
i d gotten like 50 of them 
that s where i m at 
i would look like a circus freak or something 
i would just be covered   head to toe  tattoos all over   
everywhere  face  shirt  right there 
across my forehead 
just my name  emmett 
or  you know  
   thug life 
   michelle laughs 
   yolo 
i don t even know what that means  but  i hear
people saying it all the time   so it must be cool 
hey  what about you  howard 
anything you wish you d done 
in all honesty  no 
no 
no crazy nights in vegas  
maybe  ah  take a pilgrimage to waco 
everything i wanted to do  i did 
i focused on being prepared 
and i was 
and here we are 
oh  my goodness  
is that monopoly 
there we go 
yeah  that s how we kill the time 
i mean  what you say   we re going to be
down here like what  a year  two  three 
bet you if we started a game right now 
we might even get halfway finished  
stop talking 
you don t need to make jokes about how
long we re going to be down here 
when nobody knows how long that s going to be 
you humor is not funny 
i don t appreciate it while i m trying
to eat  and neither does michelle 
now please shut up  and let us eat in peace 
emmett 
pass me a napkin 
i know what you re saying 
i never could finish monopoly 
that game really does take forever  right

i know it s hard 
realizing they re all gone 
the ones you love 
i have something to confess to you 
i crashed into your car 
your accident 
was my fault 
when i found out about the incoming
attack  i got frantic 
i knew i needed to get back here
as soon as possible 
oh  i was driving like a maniac 
i tried to pass you  and  
i m the reason you went off the road 
and i know i seem like a sensible guy 
but  at the time  i wasn t myself 
it was an accident   but it was my fault 
i was afraid to tell you 
i m sorry 
you should shower 
you had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges  could be toxic 
these are megan s 
if you want them 
i recognize that woman s car 
her name was leslie  i think 
you knew her 
she was a neighbor 
emmett wasn t the only one
that knew about this place 
if any others somehow survived 
they could be coming here too 
as of friday  kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs 
i m going to need some stitches 
why  you want me to   
this is your doing  isn t it 
i mean 
i don t think i m really qualified 
i ll walk you through it 
here 
have a drink 
what is it 
technically  it s   
vodka
safe   i distill it myself 
  i just said i distill it  i didn t say anything
about it tasting good     yeah  that s awful 
you want it on the rocks 
little trick i taught myself as a young man
stationed on a ship  with way too much free time 
every now and again  if the co was working us
too hard  we d freeze and snap the knob off  
the bathroom door while they were still inside 
i guess it took an hour or two  to get out
i m good 
suit yourself   cheers 
this is clean 
all you need to do is    stitch 
you re doing fine 
stuff i grabbed from your car 
didn t have time to bring in the booze 
sadly 
what is all that 
i wanted to design clothes 
no wonder you were so good with the stiches 
megan wanted to be an artist 
  she was your daughter 
  yeah
she was smart  loved to read 
the magazines or just for fun 
she inhaled books 
anything with paris 
she liked their movies 
their culture  you know 
we used to have this little joke 
every once in a while  i d ask her  
what do you want to be
when you grow up 
and you know what she d say 
french 
anyway 
her mother turned her against me 
took her off to chicago 
people are strange creatures
you can t always convince them that
safety is in their own  best interest
you don t know they re gone 
anyway 
at least i tried to help them 
hey  you know there is nothing
you could ve done for that woman
even if you had let her in 
she still would ve died 
you asked earlier about    regrets 
yeah  i got some of those 
welcome to the club 
i mean  i lived my life
in a 40 mile radius 
and that was by design 
i made sure that happened 
i was so fast in high school 
i even managed to outrun my bad grades 
i was all state track 
three years in a row 
caught a full ride to louisiana tech
up there in ruston 
i remember i spent the last
two weeks of that summer 
showing off the bus ticket they
sent me  to anybody who looked at it
and then came the night
before i was supposed to leave 
and i just got so worried 
about how bad i was
going to do up there
with all those smart kids
so i went out of my way
to get just pissed wasted  so bad that
there was no chance i was waking
up in in the morning 
so i missed the bus
i didn t buy a ticket for the next one
or the one after that 
well  if you d gone 
you might be dead now 
well  lucky me  right 
lucky us 
a few  a few years ago 
i was at a hardware store
and there was this little girl 
with her dad 
and he was in a hurry 
and she wasn t keeping up 
and he kept
yanking on her arm 
really hard  you know 
too hard 
you know that feeling 
when my dad got that way 
my brother collin was always there 
to take the worst of it 
for me 
and after seeing that little girl 
i thought maybe i could
do that
for her 
but i just kept watching
and they were about to leave 
and i d done nothing 
and 
she slips
and it throws him out off balance
and he hits her
and i wanted so badly to do something 
to help her  but
i do what i always do
when things get hard
i just panicked and ran 
look 
we re here  we re alive 
and that means something 
got it 
you ve got to be kidding me 
what 
we re missing pieces here 
look at this poor cat 
he s been deformed 
he s got one eye 
about to go snorkling and
everything too 
what are you doing 
ooh  cornering the market on
post apocalyptic fashion  huh 
needs more axes and chainsaws 
for what  she has a shotgun 
yeah  what if up there it s like  
        tracks 
  zombies 
though even howard doesn t think that one s possible 
though you should hear his theory
about mutant space worms 
what is that  howard 
stay calm  we re okay 
  what was that 
  quiet 
that sounds like helicopters 
could be military 
but not ours 
how can you tell 
  14 years in the navy 
  what s happening up there 
my guess  those flashes that kicked
this all off 
that was phase 1 
take out your opponent s population centers 
with big hits  all at once
fast 
and then for round 2 
ground sweeps 
the satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently 
possibly extra terrestrial signals 
i bet what we just heard were air borne
patrols sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life 
like us 
okay  oh boy  
that s bad 
and that s worse 
what was up there 
air filtration system 
i can t   something is
blocking the hedge 
if we can t get it back up  we re
gonna run out of breathable air fast 
you re the only one
small enough to reach it 
reach what 
the filtration system 
through there  the main duct 
someone needs to get in there
and re start it 
give me a hand 
  let me go in  she won t know her way around 
  you won t fit  plus your arm  she ll be fine 
now  to re start the unit  you just
swing the handle off and on  off and on 
that should do it 
and neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck 
don t get stuck 
michelle 
everything okay up there 
looks like a dead end 
that s the incline 
climb up that 
and you re almost there 
oh  this sucks 
 help 
what s wrong 
he lied to you  he lied about megan 
what do you mean 
i think he did something horrible to her 
how  
his family moved to chicago
years ago 
what s this 
is that blood 
come with me 
wait  is that  
she went missing  two years back 
it was on the news and everything 
most people just thought she skipped town 
there is a message up there 
it said  help   it was scratched on the inside of the window 
this earring was with it 
did she ever show up  after she went missing 
he said to me  he said to my face 
he said this is his daughter  he said this   
he took her and he killed her 
i was just thinking 
maybe we
take away his gun
tie him up  to confess  whatever it is he s done
  what confess to who  the police 
look  like i said 
we can t be the only survivors  right 
  the woman  she was able to get
around a little  right     yeah  till she died 
directly above us  choking to death 
       other people to save      
now  that s a great example of teamwork 
very well done 
feel like some music 
problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood 
michelle 
you should go shower  just in case 
sure
 soundtrack 
the exciters  vonda shepard    tell him  1962 
i think i might have an idea 
   10 better ways to style my bangs  
  no  not the article   this 
i think i can only make one 
but it s a start 
no kidding 
hey  howard
what is this 
you re re watching  16 candles  
 pretty in pink 
it was one of megan s favorite movies 
can i help you with something 
no  no  i m just grabbing some water 
say  ahmm 
you know  i was just thinking  
not  that i m trying to tell
you how to run this place 
but i am just 
a bit curious
about michelle
say  how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit 
you think she touched it 
yeah  i m pretty sure she touched it 
yeah  i know she cleaned up after  and
everything   but i m just thinking  
given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside
if she tracked anything back in with
her  it would be pretty concentrated
and
could be all over the shower 
and the sink  bathroom  right now 
well  anyways  it s just a thought 
not bad so far  partner 
if howard find this  he s going
to kill us 
alright  so  we get the gun away from him 
tie him up  make sure
he isn t going anywhere 
and then one of us
just  
goes out  and looks for help
