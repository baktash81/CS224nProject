home of the jersey journal
 can l help you 
 well  l called for her last night 
her husband died last night 
his picture was in the paper once 
but you misspelled his name 
she wants to be sure you get it right 
 you see  it s not one  but two  i s 
 you want obituaries 
lt s the guy in the back
with the urn on his desk 
what funeral home was she taken to 
how old was she 
what did she die of 
well  l have to know what she died of
or l can t write the obit 
l don t make the rules 
could l call you back  thank you 
excuse me  will you 
tom 
tom  look  l cannot take this anymore 
you got to get me off the obit desk 
l can t write another obituary 
calm down  adam  relax 
lt isn t going to last forever 
think of it this way 
this is your last chance in journalism
to write anything nice about anybody 
perfect 
new york city   five years later
so  you can t talk to me about the arrest 
can you talk to me about after the arrest 
you know  his time in prison 
lt was terrible 
he was in shock the entire time 
he lost a lot of weight
because he couldn t eat the food 
he couldn t sleep 
they had him in the same cell
with a mafia hit man 
 he was afraid to close his eyes for a week 
 lnteresting 
for a man like him   
   that was cruel and unusual punishment 
l ll say 
what do you think  charlie 
can you get him to talk to me 
he s not talking to any press  adam 
he doesn t trust you guys 
l don t blame him 
there s been a lot of bad press lately 
l thought he d want to tell
his side of the story 
the only way to do that is an interview 
especially if he feels that the government
is screwing around on him 
now  l didn t exactly say that 
anyway  not for the record 
l don t want you to twist what l said
out of shape 
right 
the problem is  the only people that
will talk to me are people that hate him 
and l m doing this story
whether l talk to him or not 
so don t fault me if this is a negative piece 
that sounds vaguely like a threat 
no  l think that if he wants a chance 
he s got to turn his press around 
you reporters think
you make the world turn 
l don t know about that 
you know  l used to be a reporter myself   
   until l got tired of starving my family 
that s why l got into public relations 
 to make a living wage  l love it 
 yeah 
l really do 
excuse me  l have to take a piss 
 am l interrupting something 
 no  adam  come on in and look at this 
 frankie strikes again 
 look at that  they re good 
at last someone has managed
to capture his true essence 
look at this one 
l can t believe that she got him to do this 
believe me  it was easy 
l think this will be the one
we use on the cover 
 you like it 
 l like it 
 you want to get some lunch 
 yeah 
 frankie  you want to join us 
 absolutely 
how did it go this morning 
fascinating 
he insisted we meet at the atrium club 
saying it was a safe place to talk 
he implied the government had a reason
for putting mckenzie out of business 
he was so nervous 
 but what about the interview 
 he thought it was doubtful 
 there s no story without an interview 
 or without pictures 
you don t want to recycle
the same wire service photos 
 l d love to shoot him 
 you d make him pose with coke in his lap 
 l can make him do anything 
 come on  you guys 
l have an idea 
mckenzie has a hearing tomorrow 
in los angeles  to reduce his bail 
but he needs the  2 million
to pay his lawyers 
why don t l fly out there tonight
and get the interview 
 you hate flying 
 l m fine  as long as there s no turbulence 
when it starts bouncing around 
l get drunk 
lf you re going  let s find a story
for you to do at the same time   
   in case it doesn t work out  l don t want
you wasting your time or my money 
you cheap fuck 
you want two stories for the price of one 
fine 
l have an idea for a story
that would take place in california 
what 
l got the idea at the atrium club 
this morning 
 who would you be going after 
 not who  what 
 excuse me  what will you be going after 
 health clubs 
 groan 
 no 
l ll do a story about how they re
turning into the singles bars of the  80s 
find a couple  do a non fiction love story 
 with pictures 
 lots of them  lt could be hilarious 
particularly set in los angeles 
you know  inflated bodies  airheads 
 hot tubs  alfalfa sprouts 
 absolutely 
we haven t done l a  in a long time 
lt would be wonderful 
 sounds great 
 shit 
 what 
 carly simon just walked in 
oh  god 
 she hated the story you did on her 
 l know  l know 
 hi  carly 
 hi  carly 
hi  carly 
 l read that shit you wrote about me 
 come on  carly 
the only thing worse than being
written about is not being written about 
there is a motion with respect to the bail
for mr  mckenzie 
 ls that correct 
 lt is  your honour 
 yes  ls there a written motion 
 no 
l d like to make an oral presentation 
 you filed the notice 
 yes  your honour 
all right  then  go ahead
and state your reasons 
then the government may reply 
we are seeking a reduction in bail
based on two major things 
one  mr  mckenzie is simply
not as wealthy as the government   
   and the press  for that matter  imagines 
let s leave the press out of it 
they have nothing to do with setting bail 
here they come 
 charlie  what about the interview 
 he s not talking to anybody 
 period 
 lf he changes his mind  l ll be at  
he s not changing his mind 
he s flying to new york today 
the sunset marquis 
the sunset marquis 
hello 
 adam 
 yeah 
 how s it going 
 lt s going fine 
he got his bail reduced 
but l couldn t talk to him 
he had to go back to new york 
l m working on some other angles 
l m trying to locate some friends of his 
l started the piece  lt s real good 
 ln other words  no interview 
 come on  mark  please 
the story is great 
and the material l have is terrific 
 lt should be a cover 
 you get the interview and we ll talk cover 
simon   schuster just made an inquiry
for me to do this as a book 
cover would help 
l m not in the goddamn book business 
 have you found a health club yet 
 yes  i found an ad in the phone book 
the club s name is the sports connection 
 health club  racquetball  and good times 
 we re a totally new concept
in athletic club 
 we re more than a club  we re a lifestyle  
then it has this illustration of a couple
in sports clothes hugging each other 
lt sounds perfect 
what kind of story are you planning to do 
maybe something about
couples meeting here  falling in love   
    getting married 
 that sounds good 
let s go down and get you a membership 
so you can see what s happening 
now that sounds even better 
nanette  where did you get this idea
to make this place   
   more than a health club 
like your ad says 
l looked around the city and l saw
that people had had it with singles bars 
they even had the supermarkets
staked out  that was getting boring 
really 
there wasn t anywhere people could
get together in a healthy environment   
   and have some social interaction 
 right 
 mr  lawrence  hold it 
michael and l  he s my partner 
thought it d be great to create a place   
   like the lodge at the bottom of the hill
in aspen 
where people could share
a common interest 
 all right 
 phone  nanette 
 take a message  okay 
 okay 
my concept was to get people
out of their potato chip bags   
   into the club by convincing them
it didn t have to be drudgery 
 that it could be fun 
 right 
 l ll get somebody to show you around 
 sounds good 
we have nine racquetball courts 
these two courts are our challenge courts 
 the winner stays on  loser gets off 
 really 
then  you have a lounge area 
lt s a good place to sit and relax 
before and after your workout 
your entrance and registration area 
and then we have pete s pro shop 
they have the latest in workout apparel   
   and racquetball equipment 
then you have the snack bar 
they have fruit juices  great smoothies 
 beer and wine 
 no wine  just beer 
 you can get a beer after your workout 
 good 
 and great sandwiches 
 sprouts 
 definitely 
 yes 
 are you into health food 
 no  not really 
okay  let s look at body dynamics 
what they do in here
is personal fitness assessments 
they do cardiovascular testing 
nutritional analysis   
   hydrostatic weighing 
or weighing the body underwater 
lt helps determine
your percentage of body fat 
then  you have
an hour and a half long consultation 
 and here we have the coed gym 
 so this is where all the action takes place 
on the free weights 
the universal equipment   
   the nautilus  and lcarian equipment 
 l feel guilty  all these people working out 
 and the lifecycle bikes 
 hi  bobby 
 hi  linda 
 l miss you  l never see you anymore 
 adam  linda  linda  adam 
hello  linda 
l mean it  l really miss you 
l worked up here as an instructor
before l was promoted to sales 
 l see 
 he used to work on my body 
 looking good 
 god knows  l try 
l m still in the  before  group 
not the  after   but l m gonna get there 
 where s sally 
 she s there  working out with roger 
 trying to make her tits even bigger 
 well  see you 
 nice meeting you 
 you  too 
 what s her story 
 she was a mess 
 what do you mean 
 no one works as hard to get in shape 
 really 
 hi  sally  hi  roger 
 five 
 he s killing me 
 come on  let s go  back to work 
 how many  just three more 
 that s a couple you should talk to 
 who are they 
sally works with linda
at the apparel mart  downtown 
and roger 
he s a stripper at chippendales 
 lnteresting  l do want to talk to them 
 nice people  they met here 
 you ll have such a good time  l promise 
 come on  come on 
how big do you want them 
can l get a list of couples that met here 
and their phone numbers 
 lt s against policy to give phone numbers 
 can t you bend the rules 
l really don t have much time 
 l ll see what l can do 
 thank you 
 kenny  this is adam lawrence 
 how you doing 
he s a reporter for rolling stone 
kenny can answer questions if l m not in 
 nanette said you re looking for couples 
 yeah 
l m a big fan of yours 
 really 
 yeah  l subscribe to rolling stone 
l read your piece on carly simon 
l thought it was great 
so did l 
l bet lots of lustful matinees
get started here 
 what  what do you mean 
 excuse me  l mean  social interaction 
 let me show you the rest of the club 
 okay 
by the way 
what kind of story are you writing 
this is aerobics and  slimnastics  
that s jessie wilson 
she s probably the best female instructor
we got right now 
they call her  the aerobics pied piper  
 a lot of couples met in her class 
 really 
turn it around 
l m going back to my workout 
 enjoy the class 
 thanks 
 nice meeting you 
 lt was very nice meeting you 
squeeze  release  squeeze  release 
toes out 
shoulders down 
really tighten your thighs 
touch down 
straight leg  left  go 
hold it down on two

let s go 
  night  kim 
 goodnight  jessie 
 hi  shirley 
 hi  jessie 
jessie 
 adam lawrence  hi 
 hi 
 l really enjoyed your class  you re great 
 thanks 
l m a reporter for rolling stone 
l m writing on the sports connection 
 really 
 yeah 
 rolling stone 
 yes 
l d love to interview you 
 why 
 why not 
 l can think of a lot of reasons 
 lt would be good for business 
business is fine 
you think about it 
l ll be around for a few days 
l will  but l don t change my mind
about anything 
could you give me a reason why 
l read magazines 
the star garden club is proud to present   
   direct from new york city 
the one and only   
   shotsy 
 jessie  hi 
 hi 
 did you think about it 
 very  very hard 
 did you change your mind 
 no 
 well  l ll get someone else to interview 
 l guess you will 
maybe you don t understand 
l may want you as the focus of my story 
no  you don t understand 
l don t want to be the focus of anything 
okay  you don t have to be the focus 
l just need your viewpoint 
last time l counted 
there were 90 aerobic instructors 
 but your classes are the biggest  sexiest  
 are you deaf  no 
 what s the problem 
 l was burned once 
l don t intend to get burned again 
 the battery s dead 
 no kidding  lt happens all the time 
where s your car 
l have jumper cables 
 you okay 
 yeah 
l can never remember
which is positive or negative  try that 
 all right 
 keep it going 
okay  l have an idea 
l know you don t want to be interviewed 
 but how about dinner tonight 
 sorry 
how about lunch tomorrow 
 all off the record 
 just like regular people 
 hello 
 hi 
l m sorry to call so late 
but l just got your message 
what s going on 
 are you all right 
 yeah  why 
hold on  l m putting you on speaker 
l got a call from a guy l know who s in
the shady end of the record business 
he said you re ringing the wrong doorbells
and might end up in the hospital 
make sense to you 
l don t know 
l ve been poking around  but    
l made contact
with one of his old girlfriends today 
maybe somebody s nervous about that 
l called just to say watch yourself 
l want you to promise me
you ll be real careful on this one  okay 
anyway  how s the other one 
have you found a hook 
yeah  as a matter of fact 
l found this terrific opportunity 
lt s not the kind of story l had in mind
at first  but it s pretty good  listen 
there s a girl at the sports connection
who they call  the aerobics pied piper  
she s got this following
of leotards and sweat suits 
she s fun to watch 
so lots of couples meet there 
sounds good  maybe that will work 
lt s great  the only problem is
she doesn t want to cooperate 
 but she will 
 l m sure she will 
just remember  get close to her
while you research  but when you write  
forget she has a mother  right 
don t l always 
 talk to you later 
  bye 
so  who s going to get
the lawrence treatment this time 
some girl he met 
 that s obvious 
 so what s the hook of your story 
lt s not one of those pieces about how
health clubs are the new singles bars 
god forbid 
 do you work out 
 yes  l do work out  when l have time 
l don t take it as seriously as you guys do 
but l do work out 
my dad didn t take it seriously  either 
he died fat at 40 
sorry 
l was 8  l knew even then   
   if he had worked out and not smoked 
he d have lived longer 
how old are you 
l m sorry 
you don t have to answer that question 
 mid to late 20s 
 lnteresting 
what 
most people l ve interviewed
are about that age 
l think when you get to our age
you feel the need to keep in shape 
probably no coincidence
that the baby boom generation   
   approached 30 at the same time
as the exercise boom started 
 you do have a hook 
 maybe 
lt s good to talk a story out before writing 
lt s all spitballing at this point 
 what s that 
 a tape recorder 
l thought maybe we d exchange ideas 
if you don t mind 
 do you mind 
 yeah 
 l won t do it 
 thanks 
l do have some notes
that may interest you 
look at this 
 the baby boomers are leading
a physical great awakening   
    like the spiritual awakenings
that grip america about every 100 years  
pretty good 
l think people want to take responsibility
instead of leaning on institutions 
for instance  does anyone believe
the government will take care of us 
 no 
 not since vietnam or watergate  no 
or big corporations  or even doctors 
so  you have to take care of yourself 
a lot of people are trying to get in shape 
as you well know 
l think we ve come full circle 
almost back to emersonian america
of self reliance 
there s something else here 
emerson   do that which is assigned thee
and thou canst not hope too much   
    or dare too much  
so  what could be more all american 
more old fashioned all american   
   than institutions
like the sports connection 
little capitals of emersonian america
scattered from sea to shining sea 
you are so hot 
l m glad we had this off the record lunch 
l was real suspicious of the kind of story
you were going to write 
lf you want to know
about the sports connection   
   a real writer would work out  join 
 you ever taken an aerobic class 
 no 
l ve got one starting soon 
you should take one of mine 
l should  but l can t  l don t have the time 
l ve another appointment this afternoon 
l have to finish up a story
before l can concentrate on this one 
 what s the other story 
 joseph mckenzie 
you do important stuff  too 
 will you be here later 
 nope  l m on the road 
what do you mean  on the road 
l teach class at the
beverly hills sports connection  tonight 
 coming in 
 no  l really don t have the time 
l ll make a deal with you  though 
l would gladly take one of your aerobic
classes if you d let me interview you 
l was really beginning to like you  too 
notes on lunch 
we talked about baby boom generation 
great physical awakening   
   emersonian america 
father dies fat at 40 
lnteresting girl 
she s smart  but l ve got to be smarter 
mckenzie and l go way back 
l met him when l was in new york 
and l was stripping  even then 
right  but in a little classier club 
l didn t know who he was
and he walks into the club one night   
   and he puts a  1 000 bill in my g string 
 are you kidding  really 
 we had a lot of fun 
 he s really a great guy 
 sounds it 
l ll tell you something 
if you promise not to tell 
 okay 
 he bought this house for me 
 really 
 yes 
 well  do you still talk to him 
 joe and l talk all the time 
 shotsy 
 my god  my husband s home 
eddie 
 honey  this is adam lawrence 
 hi 
he s a reporter for rolling stone 
and he s doing a piece on joe mckenzie 
 get out of here 
 l wanted to ask your wife a few questions 
 you leave her out of this 
 eddie  l invited him 
l told him he could come 
he says that nobody has anything nice
to say about joe  and l want to help 
you re not saying anything to anybody 
l don t want her name mentioned
in any article  understand 
now get out of here 
knees up 
jumping jacks 
see you next week 
 l ll see you guys later  l m late 
 great class  thanks 
 bye 
you did good 
 see you later 
 hi 
 what are you doing here 
 l just thought l d come by   
   and see if you needed someone
to help charge your battery 
 l have a confession to make 
 a confession  yeah 
what kind of confession 
on my way to work  l went to the library
and pulled some back issues   
   of rolling stone and read
some articles that you wrote 
really  which ones 
abscam and junk food 
 and   he says  fishing for a compliment 
you re pretty good 
must be fun being a reporter nowadays 
 yeah   he says suspiciously 
you get to try to keep the big boys honest 
at the same time  you get to figure out
which way the culture s going 
l guess that s true  a friend of mine says   
   that popular culture is to society
what dreams are to an individual 
lf you want to find out about an individual 
you analyse their dreams 
same with society 
lf you want to find out about a society 
you analyse things like music and film 
 or health clubs  or junk food 
 and in doing so  you can be quite vicious 
l think l try to be objective 
do you always work on a computer 
do you know anything about computers 
l took a couple of courses 
 you left it on 
 l always leave it on 
this way  it s already warmed up
if l get an idea in the middle of the night 
may l 
everybody writes that 
l was hoping you d come up
with something more original 
how do you erase it 
a good reporter would never get in bed
with a subject 
you keep forgetting something 
l m not your subject 
 you d probably be a lousy interview 
 probably 
 no opinions  no ideas 
 none 
 l think l ll take your class anyway 
 l give a very tough class 
you do  tell me about it 
first  there s the warm up 
the warm up is designed   
   to increase blood to the muscles 
to warm up the muscles 
so as to be able   
   to do the more strenuous exercises 
and then  there s the cardiovascular 
let me get rid of this 
hello  yes  who 
mr  mckenzie  yes 
well  this is he  well  who told you 
shotsy did  good 
that s good  l think you should tell
your side of the story 
well  if l left right now 
l could probably catch the redeye 
great  sounds good  thank you 
he ll meet with me  maybe he ll talk 
l got to go 
of course you do 
wait a minute 
this is to be continued 
l certainly hope so 
 hello 
 hi  l called the office 
they said you re still home 
rough night 
mikey douglas was in town 
and l got the cocktail flu 
 where are you 
 l m at jfk  guess what 
l got a meeting today with mckenzie 
we re to meet at 12 00 at the atrium club

 l ll make space 
 has the cover closed yet 
 yeah  it s closed 
screw the cover 
you re drunk  aren t you 
must have been some turbulence 
listen  l can t talk  l got to go 
l ll drop by later  how s that   bye 
wish me luck 
adam

hold the presses 
and get me frankie

 adam

 mark wants me to photograph mckenzie 
 no  he s nuts  l can t take you with me 
 come on  you can try 
 forget about it 
 adam  come on 
go  frankie  l m not kidding 
nobody s supposed to be here 
you ll blow it 
 my photos are as important as your story 
 there ll be no story without an interview 
 don t do this to me 
 bull 
 what 
 lt s charlie  his flack 
 stay here 
 charlie who 
 give me your camera 
 no 
charlie  hi 
l m so sorry l m late 
the traffic was impossible 
 mind if l use my tape recorder 
 why don t you ask him yourself 
well  you certainly come prepared 
 where to  mr  mckenzie 
 just drive around the park 
 so  what happened 
 l got it 
l never thought l d get him to talk 
but once he started he wouldn t stop 
lt was amazing 
l have three solid hours all on tape 
adam 
where s my camera 
give it to me right now 
 don t ever pull that again 
 the film s inside 
 my first picture credit 
 what 
 have it developed  see you later  frankie 
 screw you 
 so what s the story 
 okay 
mckenzie was negotiating
to sell his computers to czechoslovakia   
   to save his company 
he had it all worked out 
he was gonna move computers   
   through dummy corporations 
all over europe   
   until they wound up
behind the lron curtain 
he claims the government found out
what he was up to   
   and put him out of business
by busting him 
 how much space do you need 
 six pages 
four 
five 
okay  four and a half 
we ll hold the issue  when can l have it 
 how soon do you need it 
 tomorrow morning 
you got it 
what about this aerobics contest
coming up 
they want me to make a demonstration 
 jessie  phone for you 
 okay 
 okay  killer  l ll see you later 
 be good 
 how you doing  you through 
 yeah 
 where were you 
 hiding 
here you go 
hello 
adam  hi 
l m fine  how was the interview 
lt was real interesting 
l really can t tell you the details right now 
l m afraid this phone is being tapped 
l ll be in tomorrow 
l ll call you when l know what time 
l ll be there 
make sure my tape recorder is on 
i understand you suspect the government
of what lawyers politely call  misconduct  
that s right 
well  could you expand on that 
i have reason to believe   
   that they eavesdropped
on my office computers 
you know  like hackers  but   
   these hackers weren t kids 
they were fbi hackers 
yes  hello 
what cuts 
what trouble 
right 
l ll be there  okay 
frankie 
 how did my pictures turn out 
 bad  amateurish  snapshotty 
that good 
 mark can see you  the lawyers are here 
 the lawyers 
come on in 
you know tod turner and martha young 
only on the phone 
you really are expecting this
to cause trouble 
 l thought you liked causing trouble 
 l do   
   more than anybody you know 
but up to a point 
let me guess what that is 
could that be the point
where trouble costs you money 
right  you want to split the bills
on this one 
 what s the problem 
 martha  why don t you start 
mark says that you have
the entire interview on tape 
something like three hours 
 who s to retain custody of the tapes 
 l am  why 
the magazine should retain
the original tape  or a copy for its files 
 that s not a problem  is it 
 that is a problem 
l promised mckenzie
l wouldn t let anyone have a copy 
the prosecutors will demand a copy
once this story is out 
l promised him they would never get it 
l gave him my word 
we ll do everything to keep the tapes
from the government 
 we ll fight any subpoena in court 
 that s not good enough 
l will make sure the tapes don t get out 
the only way to do that is to keep them 
what happens if the magazine were fined
 1 000 a day until you turned them over 
l won t test the magazine s guts
or its bank account 
the government could pressure you  too 
send you to jail 
that s a risk l have to take 
where are the cuts  l want to see them 
adam  be reasonable 
you could have libelled mckenzie 
he could have libelled others 
let s not kid around 
mark could be facing millions in lawsuits 
without your tapes we have no evidence
to go into court with 
l can t recommend that mark publish
the article unless you turn them over 
l can t recommend these cuts 
someone s editing with their elbows 
 where are the tapes 
 ln my bag 
look  you wanted me to do the story 
l did the story  okay 
take it or leave it  print it  don t print it

l don t know 
l don t think you can be objective 
l mean  really objective 
under any circumstances 
 like the heisenberg principle of physics 
 yes 
the theory that we change things
by observing them 
the idea is that to see something
you have to shed some light on it 
 and light alters what it shines on 
 yeah  that s good  very good point 
 hi  you guys 
 hi  hon 
jeff  bobby  this is adam lawrence

he s doing an article on sports connection 
 he looks too nice to be a reporter 
 mother 
a piece of divinity  mr  lawrence 
she makes the best divinity in the world 
you re thinking of interviewing jessie
for this story 
we re talking about it 
we haven t quite decided 
well  l hope you treat her better
than the last reporter 
that was one of the worst experiences
of my life 
l thought we weren t going to talk about it 
all right  l m going 
goodbye  darling  come visit 
 bye  mr  lawrence  enjoy the divinity 
jessica  you re too skinny 
 this stuff will kill you 
 what was she talking about 
who is this reporter
and why was he interviewing you 
lf l told you 
you might be tempted to use it 
l couldn t stand that 
wait a minute  l want to know
what she was talking about 
ln high school  l was a swimmer 
l was a very good swimmer 
l broke world records 
l made the olympic team 
that was the year carter decided
to boycott the games in moscow 
l didn t agree with him
and was vocal about it 
there was this reporter who said
he wanted to write about how l felt 
but what he ended up writing about 
after a series of interviews   
   was my alleged love affair
with my coach 
 l ll show you where the phone is 
 wait a minute 
 where s the phone 
 on the roof 
 jessie  hold on 
 l don t want to talk about it 
 jessie 
 l don t want to 
 just tell me about the l a  games 
 l was never that fast again 
here s the phone  make your call 
l m going to go check on the mail 
hello 
dita  what s up  you need me 
l m having trouble checking this 
everyone s afraid  nobody will talk to me 
l really need your help 
 you ready 
 shoot 
 are you sure about the spelling of shotsy 
 s h o t s y 
 how did you like the piece 
 not bad 
we should do more of this sort of thing 
man does not live by rock  n  roll alone 
woman either 
l got to put you on hold 
somebody s buzzing me 
 okay 
 adam 
believe it or not 
l ve changed my mind about something 
let s go skiing  l want to go to mammoth 
you can interview me all you want 
what s the matter 
l can t move 
god  l can t move 
l got polio 
l got polio  god 
 how many articles do you write in a year 
 l don t know  ten  sometimes more 
do you always follow
your subjects around 
you re interviewing me 
l m supposed to be interviewing you 
 any pointers on how to improve my style 
 yes 
always treat a famous person
as if they re not 
and a person who s not famous
as if they were 
and think of your interview as a seduction 
 a seduction 
 yes 
how many times a year
do you fall in love  adam 
lt depends on the subject 
l think anything worthwhile takes longer 
working out  a relationship 
maybe you re right 
l wrote six articles a day for a newspaper 
 at least l m going in the right direction 
 which is 
take some time off  write a book 
about what 
mckenzie  maybe 
lf this article is as good as l think it will be 
maybe even the press 
they have gotten a lot of bum raps lately 
yeah  and you 
what would you like to do 
right now  or for the rest of my life 
you don t want to teach aerobics forever 
do you 
no  there s a point
when you re not the best  so you get out 
ls it important for you to be the best 
yeah  ever since l was a kid 
l m trying to find something that means
the same as going for the gold medal 
l always expected to win it 
l like breaking records 
l like setting records and breaking them 
l like winning trophies 
l like being the best 
you are the best 
you want to go break another record 
 sure you re not too sore 
 yes 
let s go 
 good luck  right 
 yeah  right 
come on 
 l ve just the remedy for you 
 you do 
l really got turned on in that class 
lt s sexy to watch people work out 
don t you think 
sure  because the sexuality is so free 
 everything seems to be so legal 
 lt s definitely a meat market 
which is probably why you don t see
many couples working out together 
l mean  if they pair off they fall out
and you never see them again 
 they never come back 
 lt s  cause it makes sex much better 
the better your body looks 
the more you want to take off your clothes 
lt s true 
that s good 
well  do you think that people
that are in better shape have better sex 
yeah 
 definitely 
 without a doubt 
all right  how can we expand on that 
l did 
 l mean  two heads are better than one 
 jeffrey 
yeah 
 hi  jess 
 better than one  huh 
 what are you thinking about  
he says  hopefully 
l m thinking about george hathaway 
to tell you the truth 
who s that 
he s the reporter who wrote that piece
in inside sports magazine 
what made you think of him 
l think about the press a lot nowadays 
anything specific 
l was wondering if he has any idea
what his article did to all of us 
what do you mean  exactly 
lt s very hard for me
to trust anybody  anymore 
on any level 
my mom and l didn t talk for a year 
see  she was the one who gave him
most of his information 
although  she says she didn t say
what he printed 
lt didn t matter
because my coach lost his job 
his wife left him  took their kids 
and he and l    
l don t know  it was just never the same 
we went to one meet afterwards 
lt was just too painful 
lt was actually humiliating 
but was it true 
did you have an affair with your coach 
what s that  adam 
a tape recorder 
 ls it on 
 yes 
get out 
 get the fuck out of my car  adam 
 jesus christ 
 you fucking liar 
 jessie 
you re a sphincter muscle  adam 
she s mad 
she always swims when she s mad 
hi 
 hi  mr  lawrence 
 what s going on out there 
the kids think boy george is staying here 
and l m trying to convince them he s not 
your editor called and said it s urgent
that you get back to him 
 really  thanks 
 yeah 
we want boy  we want boy 
 hello 
 adam  it s mark  hold on 
where were you these last three days 
skiing  mark 
l ve been skiing the beautiful high sierras 
skiing 
 what s that got to do with the story 
 very little  l suspect  what s up 
the whole world wants to get
that mckenzie piece 
 like who 
 new york times  washington post   
   wall street journal  time 
newsweek  the wires 
as you weren t in  all i could say was 
 eat shit and die  
 you re a real phrasemaker 
 and mckenzie s lawyers called 
they want the story bad 
they offered me money not to run it 
did you take it 
adam  eat shit and die 
we want boy 
 yes  mark 
 then some guy calls and says   
   no health club will keep you healthy
if mckenzie s story runs 
sounds like l m being followed 
god  wait a minute 
l think my room has been searched 
 what  where are the tapes 
 ln my bag

l don t have anyone to hang a story on 
what happened to miss pied piper

lt s like my home away from home 
he s real nice 
 he s been on merv griffin 
 you know  it doesn t surprise me 
 what 
 l say  it doesn t surprise me   
   that you know all the handsome men 
l bet a pretty girl like you gets hit on a lot 
yeah  l do okay 
excuse me   
   l ll be right back  l have to talk to sally 
sally  sally  come here 
 lt s going great  isn t it 
 fantastic 
listen  he is so charming 
l want to invite him to the party 
what 
adam  he s so charming 
 l want to invite him to the party

l think he s trying to seduce me 
hey  sally  happy birthday 
no  robert  not yet 
not until the stroke of midnight 
 sally  where s linda 
 she s around here someplace 
she s with that rolling stone reporter 
don t tell anybody   
   but he s going to make us
the focus of the article  maybe 
so act natural  okay 
and this is sally s bedroom over here 
 and this is my bedroom 
 nice 
just don t call me a male stripper 
l m an exotic dancer  and don t forget it 
are you sure you don t want
to take off your coat 
 lt s hot 
 not really 
do you mind if l use a tape recorder
or take notes 
not at all  you got to get it right 
l don t want to be misquoted 
next question 
 hi  guys 
 hi  linda 
hey  linda 
come over here and sit on my face 
shut up  l m being interviewed 
tell him about the bachelor party 
 l was drunk 
 and the night in the back of a mustang 
what night  l don t remember you there 
were you there 
that was really good 
remember that  that was great 
l hope everyone likes vegetarian food 
because l m a fanatic 
l wanted everything to be healthy tonight 
except the birthday cake 
l made that with white sugar 
you can t have a healthy birthday cake 
did you girls ever frequent singles bars 
did you do that scene 
did we ever 
for a while l think that s all we did 
yeah  we had our own bar stools
with notches on them   
   in every singles bar in the marina 
linda  stop talking like a sleaze 
we weren t that bad 
why did you decide to join a health club 
any one thing 
l got sick of drinks with parasols in them 
no  l just got so tired of waking up
feeling crummy every day 
l kept meeting one jerk after another 
l wanted to meet a healthy man 
linda  you ll give the wrong impression 
not everyone joins to meet someone 
 most people join just to work out 
 now  speak for yourself 
a psychic told sally she d meet
the man of her dreams at a health club 
right  so that s when we joined
the sports connection 
 and you met roger the very first day 
 yeah 
lt was love at first sight 
l took one look at those tits
and my whole body got hard 
you re terrible  he s writing that down 
come on  sally 
you re just as proud of them as l am 
actually  l am 
as a little girl 
l would go to ann margret movies 
l d come home praying for tits 
now  l prayed for tits  too  you know 
god just didn t answer my prayers 
yes  he did  god answers all prayers 
he just said no 
do you see similarities
between singles bars and health clubs 
yeah  but l love health clubs a lot better 
singles bars are really humiliating 
you re waiting there to meet somebody 
 you have an excuse to be at a health club 
 right 
and it s a lot safer
looking for mr  goodbody   
   than looking for mr  goodbar 
that s good  l ll use that 
 really  you like that 
 yeah 
this is so much fun 
l feel like l m on johnny carson 
 l really like that cleft in your chin 
 thanks 
 happy birthday to you
 happy birthday to you
 happy birthday  dear sally

 happy birthday to you

make a wish

you spoke of emerson  baby boomers

everything l wrote is true 
everything the other reporter wrote

lt s not the truth l m worried about 
it s the tone  and hurting and using people 
you re disgusting 
how can you be nice to somebody
like mckenzie and shit on linda

liquid nitrogen  ln the morning  adam 
you ve got no more time
because there is no more time 
right  you got your story

    almost preacher s pulpit 
but  he isn t preaching  no 
 he s leading an aerobics class
and the whole country is joining in 
 america is shaping up 
physically  mentally  emotionally 
 ln all kinds of ways 
  do that which is assigned thee  
emerson wrote in self reliance   
     and thou canst not hope too much
or dare too much
