home of the jersey journal
can l help you
well l called for her last night
her husband died last night
his picture was in the paper once
but you misspelled his name
she wants to be sure you get it right
you see its not one but two is
you want obituaries
lts the guy in the back
with the urn on his desk
what funeral home was she taken to
how old was she
what did she die of
well l have to know what she died of
or l cant write the obit
l dont make the rules
could l call you back thank you
excuse me will you
tom
tom look l cannot take this anymore
you got to get me off the obit desk
l cant write another obituary
calm down adam relax
lt isnt going to last forever
think of it this way
this is your last chance in journalism
to write anything nice about anybody
perfect
new york city  five years later
so you cant talk to me about the arrest
can you talk to me about after the arrest
you know his time in prison
lt was terrible
he was in shock the entire time
he lost a lot of weight
because he couldnt eat the food
he couldnt sleep
they had him in the same cell
with a mafia hit man
he was afraid to close his eyes for a week
lnteresting
for a man like him
that was cruel and unusual punishment
lll say
what do you think charlie
can you get him to talk to me
hes not talking to any press adam
he doesnt trust you guys
l dont blame him
theres been a lot of bad press lately
l thought hed want to tell
his side of the story
the only way to do that is an interview
especially if he feels that the government
is screwing around on him
now l didnt exactly say that
anyway not for the record
l dont want you to twist what l said
out of shape
right
the problem is the only people that
will talk to me are people that hate him
and lm doing this story
whether l talk to him or not
so dont fault me if this is a negative piece
that sounds vaguely like a threat
no l think that if he wants a chance
hes got to turn his press around
you reporters think
you make the world turn
l dont know about that
you know l used to be a reporter myself
until l got tired of starving my family
thats why l got into public relations
to make a living wage l love it
yeah
l really do
excuse me l have to take a piss
am l interrupting something
no adam come on in and look at this
frankie strikes again
look at that theyre good
at last someone has managed
to capture his true essence
look at this one
l cant believe that she got him to do this
believe me it was easy
l think this will be the one
we use on the cover
you like it
l like it
you want to get some lunch
yeah
frankie you want to join us
absolutely
how did it go this morning
fascinating
he insisted we meet at the atrium club
saying it was a safe place to talk
he implied the government had a reason
for putting mckenzie out of business
he was so nervous
but what about the interview
he thought it was doubtful
theres no story without an interview
or without pictures
you dont want to recycle
the same wire service photos
ld love to shoot him
youd make him pose with coke in his lap
l can make him do anything
come on you guys
l have an idea
mckenzie has a hearing tomorrow
in los angeles to reduce his bail
but he needs the 2 million
to pay his lawyers
why dont l fly out there tonight
and get the interview
you hate flying
lm fine as long as theres no turbulence
when it starts bouncing around
l get drunk
lf youre going lets find a story
for you to do at the same time
in case it doesnt work out l dont want
you wasting your time or my money
you cheap fuck
you want two stories for the price of one
fine
l have an idea for a story
that would take place in california
what
l got the idea at the atrium club
this morning
who would you be going after
not who what
excuse me what will you be going after
health clubs
groan
no
lll do a story about how theyre
turning into the singles bars of the 80s
find a couple do a nonfiction love story
with pictures
lots of them lt could be hilarious
particularly set in los angeles
you know inflated bodies airheads
hot tubs alfalfa sprouts
absolutely
we havent done la in a long time
lt would be wonderful
sounds great
shit
what
carly simon just walked in
oh god
she hated the story you did on her
l know l know
hi carly
hi carly
hi carly
l read that shit you wrote about me
come on carly
the only thing worse than being
written about is not being written about
there is a motion with respect to the bail
for mr mckenzie
ls that correct
lt is your honour
yes ls there a written motion
no
ld like to make an oral presentation
you filed the notice
yes your honour
all right then go ahead
and state your reasons
then the government may reply
we are seeking a reduction in bail
based on two major things
one mr mckenzie is simply
not as wealthy as the government
and the press for that matter imagines
lets leave the press out of it
they have nothing to do with setting bail
here they come
charlie what about the interview
hes not talking to anybody
period
lf he changes his mind lll be at
hes not changing his mind
hes flying to new york today
the sunset marquis
the sunset marquis
hello
adam
yeah
hows it going
lts going fine
he got his bail reduced
but l couldnt talk to him
he had to go back to new york
lm working on some other angles
lm trying to locate some friends of his
l started the piece lts real good
ln other words no interview
come on mark please
the story is great
and the material l have is terrific
lt should be a cover
you get the interview and well talk cover
simon  schuster just made an inquiry
for me to do this as a book
cover would help
lm not in the goddamn book business
have you found a health club yet
yes i found an ad in the phone book
the clubs name is the sports connection
health club racquetball and good times
were a totally new concept
in athletic club
were more than a club were a lifestyle
then it has this illustration of a couple
in sports clothes hugging each other
lt sounds perfect
what kind of story are you planning to do
maybe something about
couples meeting here falling in love
getting married
that sounds good
lets go down and get you a membership
so you can see whats happening
now that sounds even better
nanette where did you get this idea
to make this place
more than a health club
like your ad says
l looked around the city and l saw
that people had had it with singles bars
they even had the supermarkets
staked out that was getting boring
really
there wasnt anywhere people could
get together in a healthy environment
and have some social interaction
right
mr lawrence hold it
michael and l hes my partner
thought itd be great to create a place
like the lodge at the bottom of the hill
in aspen
where people could share
a common interest
all right
phone nanette
take a message okay
okay
my concept was to get people
out of their potato chip bags
into the club by convincing them
it didnt have to be drudgery
that it could be fun
right
lll get somebody to show you around
sounds good
we have nine racquetball courts
these two courts are our challenge courts
the winner stays on loser gets off
really
then you have a lounge area
lts a good place to sit and relax
before and after your workout
your entrance and registration area
and then we have petes pro shop
they have the latest in workout apparel
and racquetball equipment
then you have the snack bar
they have fruit juices great smoothies
beer and wine
no wine just beer
you can get a beer after your workout
good
and great sandwiches
sprouts
definitely
yes
are you into health food
no not really
okay lets look at body dynamics
what they do in here
is personal fitness assessments
they do cardiovascular testing
nutritional analysis
hydrostatic weighing
or weighing the body underwater
lt helps determine
your percentage of body fat
then you have
an hourandahalflong consultation
and here we have the coed gym
so this is where all the action takes place
on the free weights
the universal equipment
the nautilus and lcarian equipment
l feel guilty all these people working out
and the lifecycle bikes
hi bobby
hi linda
l miss you l never see you anymore
adam linda linda adam
hello linda
l mean it l really miss you
l worked up here as an instructor
before l was promoted to sales

lnteresting l do want to talk to them
nice people they met here
youll have such a good time l promise
come on come on
how big do you want them

lts against policy to give phone numbers
cant you bend the rules
l really dont have much time

thank you
kenny this is adam lawrence
how you doing
hes a reporter for rolling stone
kenny can answer questions if lm not in
nanette said youre looking for couples

l thought it was great
so did l
l bet lots of lustful matinees
get started here
what what do you mean
excuse me l mean social interaction
let me show you the rest of the club
okay
by the way
what kind of story are you writing
this is aerobics and slimnastics
thats jessie wilson
shes probably the best female instructor
we got right now
they call her the aerobics pied piper
a lot of couples met in her class
really
turn it around
lm going back to my workout
enjoy the class
thanks
nice meeting you
lt was very nice meeting you
squeeze release squeeze release
toes out
shoulders down

hi shirley
hi jessie
jessie
adam lawrence hi
hi
l really enjoyed your class youre great
thanks
lm a reporter for rolling stone
lm writing on the sports connection
really
yeah
rolling stone
yes
ld love to interview you
why
why not
l can think of a lot of reasons
lt would be good for business
business is fine
you think about it
lll be around for a few days
l will but l dont change my mind
about anything
could you give me a reason why
l read magazines
the star garden club is proud to present
direct from new york city
the one and only
shotsy
jessie hi
hi
did you think about it
very very hard
did you change your mind
no
well lll get someone else to interview
l guess you will
maybe you dont understand
l may want you as the focus of my story
no you dont understand
l dont want to be the focus of anything
okay you dont have to be the focus
l just need your viewpoint
last time l counted
there were 90 aerobic instructors
but your classes are the biggest sexiest
are you deaf no
whats the problem
l was burned once
l dont intend to get burned again
the batterys dead
no kidding lt happens all the time
wheres your car
l have jumper cables
you okay
yeah
l can never remember
which is positive or negative try that
all right
keep it going
okay l have an idea
l know you dont want to be interviewed
but how about dinner tonight
sorry
how about lunch tomorrow
all off the record
just like regular people
hello
hi
lm sorry to call so late
but l just got your message
whats going on
are you all right
yeah why
hold on lm putting you on speaker
l got a call from a guy l know whos in
the shady end of the record business
he said youre ringing the wrong doorbells
and might end up in the hospital
make sense to you
l dont know
lve been poking around but
l made contact
with one of his old girlfriends today
maybe somebodys nervous about that
l called just to say watch yourself
l want you to promise me
youll be real careful on this one okay
anyway hows the other one
have you found a hook
yeah as a matter of fact
l found this terrific opportunity
lts not the kind of story l had in mind
at first but its pretty good listen
theres a girl at the sports connection
who they call the aerobics pied piper
shes got this following
of leotards and sweat suits
shes fun to watch
so lots of couples meet there
sounds good maybe that will work
lts great the only problem is
she doesnt want to cooperate
but she will
lm sure she will
just remember get close to her
while you research but when you write
forget she has a mother right
dont l always
talk to you later
bye
so whos going to get
the lawrence treatment this time
some girl he met
thats obvious
so whats the hook of your story
lts not one of those pieces about how
health clubs are the new singles bars
god forbid
do you work out
yes l do work out when l have time
l dont take it as seriously as you guys do
but l do work out
my dad didnt take it seriously either
he died fat at 40
sorry
l was 8 l knew even then
if he had worked out and not smoked
hed have lived longer
how old are you
lm sorry
you dont have to answer that question
mid to late 20s
lnteresting
what
most people lve interviewed
are about that age
l think when you get to our age
you feel the need to keep in shape
probably no coincidence
that the babyboom generation
approached 30 at the same time
as the exercise boom started
you do have a hook
maybe
lts good to talk a story out before writing
lts all spitballing at this point
whats that
a tape recorder
l thought maybe wed exchange ideas
if you dont mind
do you mind
yeah
l wont do it
thanks
l do have some notes
that may interest you
look at this
the babyboomers are leading
a physical great awakening
like the spiritual awakenings
that grip america about every 100 years
pretty good
l think people want to take responsibility
instead of leaning on institutions
for instance does anyone believe
the government will take care of us
no
not since vietnam or watergate no
or big corporations or even doctors
so you have to take care of yourself
a lot of people are trying to get in shape
as you well know
l think weve come full circle
almost back to emersonian america
of selfreliance
theres something else here
emerson do that which is assigned thee
and thou canst not hope too much
or dare too much
so what could be more allamerican
more oldfashioned allamerican
than institutions
like the sports connection
little capitals of emersonian america
scattered from sea to shining sea
you are so hot
lm glad we had this offtherecord lunch
l was real suspicious of the kind of story
you were going to write
lf you want to know
about the sports connection
a real writer would work out join
you ever taken an aerobic class
no
lve got one starting soon
you should take one of mine
l should but l cant l dont have the time
lve another appointment this afternoon
l have to finish up a story
before l can concentrate on this one
whats the other story
joseph mckenzie
you do important stuff too
will you be here later
nope lm on the road
what do you mean on the road
l teach class at the
beverly hills sports connection tonight
coming in
no l really dont have the time
lll make a deal with you though
l would gladly take one of your aerobic
classes if youd let me interview you
l was really beginning to like you too
notes on lunch
we talked about babyboom generation
great physical awakening
emersonian america
father dies fat at 40
lnteresting girl
shes smart but lve got to be smarter
mckenzie and l go way back
l met him when l was in new york
and l was stripping even then
right but in a little classier club
l didnt know who he was
and he walks into the club one night
and he puts a 1000 bill in my gstring
are you kidding really
we had a lot of fun
hes really a great guy
sounds it
lll tell you something
if you promise not to tell
okay
he bought this house for me
really
yes
well do you still talk to him
joe and l talk all the time
shotsy
my god my husbands home
eddie
honey this is adam lawrence
hi
hes a reporter for rolling stone
and hes doing a piece on joe mckenzie
get out of here
l wanted to ask your wife a few questions
you leave her out of this
eddie l invited him
l told him he could come
he says that nobody has anything nice
to say about joe and l want to help
youre not saying anything to anybody
l dont want her name mentioned
in any article understand
now get out of here
knees up
jumping jacks
see you next week
lll see you guys later lm late
great class thanks
bye
you did good
see you later
hi
what are you doing here
l just thought ld come by
and see if you needed someone
to help charge your battery
l have a confession to make
a confession yeah
what kind of confession
on my way to work l went to the library
and pulled some back issues
of rolling stone and read
some articles that you wrote
really which ones
abscam and junk food
and he says fishing for a compliment
youre pretty good
must be fun being a reporter nowadays
yeah he says suspiciously
you get to try to keep the big boys honest
at the same time you get to figure out
which way the cultures going
l guess thats true a friend of mine says
that popular culture is to society
what dreams are to an individual
lf you want to find out about an individual
you analyse their dreams
same with society
lf you want to find out about a society
you analyse things like music and film
or health clubs or junk food
and in doing so you can be quite vicious
l think l try to be objective
do you always work on a computer
do you know anything about computers
l took a couple of courses
you left it on
l always leave it on
this way its already warmed up
if l get an idea in the middle of the night
may l
everybody writes that
l was hoping youd come up
with something more original
how do you erase it
a good reporter would never get in bed
with a subject
you keep forgetting something
lm not your subject
youd probably be a lousy interview
probably
no opinions no ideas
none
l think lll take your class anyway
l give a very tough class
you do tell me about it
first theres the warmup
the warmup is designed
to increase blood to the muscles
to warm up the muscles
so as to be able
to do the more strenuous exercises
and then theres the cardiovascular
let me get rid of this
hello yes who
mr mckenzie yes
well this is he well who told you
shotsy did good
thats good l think you should tell
your side of the story
well if l left right now
l could probably catch the redeye
great sounds good thank you
hell meet with me maybe hell talk
l got to go
of course you do
wait a minute
this is to be continued
l certainly hope so
hello
hi l called the office
they said youre still home
rough night
mikey douglas was in town
and l got the cocktail flu
where are you
lm at jfk guess what
l got a meeting today with mckenzie
were to meet at 1200 at the atrium club
youre shitting me
no
you got any space in the next issue
lll make space
has the cover closed yet
yeah its closed
screw the cover
youre drunk arent you
must have been some turbulence
listen l cant talk l got to go
lll drop by later hows that bye
wish me luck
adam
kent its mark
listen lve waited all my life to say this
hold the presses
and get me frankie
what is she doing here frankie
adam
what are you doing
mark wants me to photograph mckenzie
no hes nuts l cant take you with me
come on you can try
forget about it
adam come on
go frankie lm not kidding
nobodys supposed to be here
youll blow it
my photos are as important as your story
therell be no story without an interview
dont do this to me
bull
what
lts charlie his flack
stay here
charlie who
give me your camera
no
charlie hi
lm so sorry lm late
the traffic was impossible
mind if l use my tape recorder
why dont you ask him yourself
well you certainly come prepared
where to mr mckenzie
just drive around the park
so what happened
l got it
l never thought ld get him to talk
but once he started he wouldnt stop
lt was amazing
l have three solid hours all on tape
adam
wheres my camera
give it to me right now
dont ever pull that again
the films inside
my first picture credit
what
have it developed see you later frankie
screw you
so whats the story
okay
mckenzie was negotiating
to sell his computers to czechoslovakia
to save his company
he had it all worked out
he was gonna move computers
through dummy corporations
all over europe
until they wound up
behind the lron curtain
he claims the government found out
what he was up to
and put him out of business
by busting him
how much space do you need
six pages
four
five
okay four and a half
well hold the issue when can l have it
how soon do you need it
tomorrow morning
you got it
what about this aerobics contest
coming up
they want me to make a demonstration
jessie phone for you
okay
okay killer lll see you later
be good
how you doing you through
yeah
where were you
hiding
here you go
hello
adam hi
lm fine how was the interview
lt was real interesting
l really cant tell you the details right now
lm afraid this phone is being tapped
lll be in tomorrow
lll call you when l know what time
lll be there
make sure my tape recorder is on
i understand you suspect the government
of what lawyers politely call misconduct
thats right
well could you expand on that
i have reason to believe
that they eavesdropped
on my office computers
you know like hackers but
these hackers werent kids
they were fbi hackers
yes hello
what cuts
what trouble
right
lll be there okay
frankie
how did my pictures turn out
bad amateurish snapshotty
that good
mark can see you the lawyers are here
the lawyers
come on in
you know tod turner and martha young
only on the phone
you really are expecting this
to cause trouble
l thought you liked causing trouble
l do
more than anybody you know
but up to a point
let me guess what that is
could that be the point
where trouble costs you money
right you want to split the bills
on this one
whats the problem
martha why dont you start
mark says that you have
the entire interview on tape
something like three hours
whos to retain custody of the tapes
l am why
the magazine should retain
the original tape or a copy for its files
thats not a problem is it
that is a problem
l promised mckenzie
l wouldnt let anyone have a copy
the prosecutors will demand a copy
once this story is out
l promised him they would never get it
l gave him my word
well do everything to keep the tapes
from the government
well fight any subpoena in court
thats not good enough
l will make sure the tapes dont get out
the only way to do that is to keep them
what happens if the magazine were fined
1000 a day until you turned them over
l wont test the magazines guts
or its bank account
the government could pressure you too
send you to jail
thats a risk l have to take
where are the cuts l want to see them
adam be reasonable
you could have libelled mckenzie
he could have libelled others
lets not kid around
mark could be facing millions in lawsuits
without your tapes we have no evidence
to go into court with
l cant recommend that mark publish
the article unless you turn them over
l cant recommend these cuts
someones editing with their elbows
where are the tapes
ln my bag
look you wanted me to do the story
l did the story okay
take it or leave it print it dont print it
l got a plane to catch
another story to write
you have a big decision to make
now where were we
what comes after the warmup
after the warmup
is the cardiovascular section
lt should last for 15 to 20 minutes
lt should be uninterrupted and steady
this aerobic phase exercises
the most important muscle in the body
which is
the heart
how do you feel
l feel great
youre gonna be sore tomorrow
l dont think so
still want to interview me
l dont know
l broke the cardinal rule of journalism
whats that
after what we did last night
l dont think l can be objective
l need to take a shower
l need to make a phone call
you want to come out to my house later
yeah
you did good today
thanks
for a new yorker
for a new yorker too
nice legs

in the gym
l dont know
l dont think you can be objective
l mean really objective
under any circumstances
like the heisenberg principle of physics
yes
the theory that we change things
by observing them
the idea is that to see something
you have to shed some light on it
and light alters what it shines on
yeah thats good very good point

how many articles do you write in a year
l dont know ten sometimes more
do you always follow
your subjects around
youre interviewing me
lm supposed to be interviewing you
any pointers on how to improve my style
yes
always treat a famous person
as if theyre not
and a person whos not famous
as if they were
and think of your interview as a seduction
a seduction
yes
how many times a year
do you fall in love adam
lt depends on the subject
l think anything worthwhile takes longer
working out a relationship
maybe youre right
l wrote six articles a day for a newspaper
at least lm going in the right direction
which is
take some time off write a book
about what
mckenzie maybe
lf this article is as good as l think it will be
maybe even the press
they have gotten a lot of bum raps lately
yeah and you
what would you like to do
right now or for the rest of my life
you dont want to teach aerobics forever
do you
no theres a point
when youre not the best so you get out
ls it important for you to be the best
yeah ever since l was a kid
lm trying to find something that means
the same as going for the gold medal
l always expected to win it
l like breaking records
l like setting records and breaking them
l like winning trophies
l like being the best
you are the best
you want to go break another record
sure youre not too sore
yes
lets go
good luck right
yeah right
come on
lve just the remedy for you
you do
l really got turned on in that class
lts sexy to watch people work out
dont you think
sure because the sexuality is so free
everything seems to be so legal
lts definitely a meat market
which is probably why you dont see
many couples working out together
l mean if they pair off they fall out
and you never see them again
they never come back
lts cause it makes sex much better
the better your body looks
the more you want to take off your clothes
lts true
thats good
well do you think that people
that are in better shape have better sex
yeah
definitely
without a doubt
all right how can we expand on that
l did
l mean two heads are better than one
jeffrey
yeah
hi jess
better than one huh
what are you thinking about
he says hopefully
lm thinking about george hathaway
to tell you the truth
whos that
hes the reporter who wrote that piece
in inside sports magazine
what made you think of him
l think about the press a lot nowadays
anything specific
l was wondering if he has any idea
what his article did to all of us
what do you mean exactly
lts very hard for me
to trust anybody anymore
on any level
my mom and l didnt talk for a year
see she was the one who gave him
most of his information
although she says she didnt say
what he printed
lt didnt matter
because my coach lost his job
his wife left him took their kids
and he and l
l dont know it was just never the same
we went to one meet afterwards
lt was just too painful
lt was actually humiliating
but was it true
did you have an affair with your coach
whats that adam

ls it on
yes

get the fuck out of my car adam
jesus christ

not until the stroke of midnight
sally wheres linda
shes around here someplace
shes with that rolling stone reporter
dont tell anybody
but hes going to make us
the focus of the article maybe
so act natural okay
and this is sallys bedroom over here
and this is my bedroom
nice
just dont call me a male stripper
lm an exotic dancer and dont forget it
are you sure you dont want
to take off your coat
lts hot
not really
do you mind if l use a tape recorder
or take notes
not at all you got to get it right
l dont want to be misquoted
next question
hi guys
hi linda
hey linda
come over here and sit on my face
shut up lm being interviewed
tell him about the bachelor party
l was drunk
and the night in the back of a mustang
what night l dont remember you there
were you there
that was really good
remember that that was great
l hope everyone likes vegetarian food
because lm a fanatic
l wanted everything to be healthy tonight
except the birthday cake
l made that with white sugar
you cant have a healthy birthday cake
did you girls ever frequent singles bars
did you do that scene
did we ever
for a while l think thats all we did
yeah we had our own bar stools
with notches on them
in every singles bar in the marina
linda stop talking like a sleaze
we werent that bad
why did you decide to join a health club
any one thing
l got sick of drinks with parasols in them
no l just got so tired of waking up
feeling crummy every day
l kept meeting one jerk after another
l wanted to meet a healthy man
linda youll give the wrong impression
not everyone joins to meet someone
most people join just to work out
now speak for yourself
a psychic told sally shed meet
the man of her dreams at a health club
right so thats when we joined
the sports connection
and you met roger the very first day
yeah
lt was love at first sight
l took one look at those tits
and my whole body got hard
youre terrible hes writing that down
come on sally
youre just as proud of them as l am
actually l am
as a little girl
l would go to annmargret movies
ld come home praying for tits
now l prayed for tits too you know
god just didnt answer my prayers
yes he did god answers all prayers
he just said no
do you see similarities
between singles bars and health clubs
yeah but l love health clubs a lot better
singles bars are really humiliating
youre waiting there to meet somebody
you have an excuse to be at a health club
right
and its a lot safer
looking for mr goodbody
than looking for mr goodbar
thats good lll use that
really you like that
