tristan rveur once said
if we cannot see the wind
we can see the winds will
here pradilla ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind
by showing its effect
on the smoke
the candle flames
and doa juanas veil
only the victims faces are
visible in goyas masterwork
our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life
behind him the hill closing in
refusing a path to escape
indistinct voices
the dead toreador was originally
part of a larger painting
incident in a bullfight
after the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers
manet angrily sliced it in half
removing the fallen hero
from his arena
removing the fallen hero
from his arena
and accidentally creating
one ofhis most enduring works

human failure

whose child is dying
the father sits by the boys bed
night after night
and after the boy is dead
they give him a wake
and they set up a circle of candles
around the boys body

is standing beside him
holding his arm
and whispering

thats a bit narrowminded
of you isnt it
this is the lesbian hamlet
all the parts are played by women
oh
im joking
im ophelia
i just get so sick of playing her
things get tough
she jumps in the drink
hamlet hogs all the good lines

im sam foster
athena
hi
hi are you joining the class

of trying to get a date
whats his name
henry letham

you served him coffee in a diner a couple of times
you were nice to him but the way
he tells it youre the one good thing
that ever happened to him
henry
is he very pale very thin
his arms are scarred
yeah thats him
he always ate pecan pie with his coffee
i remember that
but i never spoke to him
outside the diner

except
yeah what
i feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist
youll think im insane

i had the strangest feeling
about him

raggedlooking guy
probably hasnt bathed in months
but something about him
id seen him before
somewhere
id known him
yeah
whats wrong with him
hes going to kill himself
why
