we can see the wind s will  
here  pradilla ortiz forces us
to imagine the wind   
by showing its effect
on the smoke   
the candle flames
and do a juana s veil 
only the victims  faces are
visible in goya s masterwork 
our eyes are drawn
to the brightest spot on the canvas  
the white shirt of a doomed man
pleading for his life 
behind him  the hill closing in   
refusing a path to escape 
   indistinct voices 
  the dead toreador was originally
part of a larger painting   
incident in a bullfight 
after the painting was mocked
by critics and viewers

whose child is dying 
the father sits by the boy s bed
night after night   
and after the boy is dead 
they give him a wake 
and they set up a circle of candles
around the boy s body 
and the father s exhausted 
he falls asleep 
and he dreams that his son
is standing beside him   
holding his arm
and whispering   
 father  can t you see

  prison  my lord 
  denmark s a prison 
  we already had this conversation 
  oh  um  uh  wait a minute 
uh  um 
   why then your ambition  
  why then your ambition makes it one 
 tis too narrow for your mind 
i could be bounded
in a nutshell   
and count myself
a king of infinite space   
were it not
that i have bad dreams 
  that s my favorite line in the whole play 
  it s a good line 
however  my favorite line
of the play is 
 o what a rogue
and peasant slave am i  
i have no idea what any of it means 
but i love the word  slave  
i love it  i gotta go 
  i ve got a solo in choir tomorrow morning 
  thanks for reading with me 
  you re a good rosencrantz 
  i know  bye 
  hello 
  hi 
i always pictured hamlet as a man 
that s a bit narrow minded
of you  isn t it 
this is the lesbian hamlet 
all the parts are played by women 
  oh 
  i m joking 
i m ophelia 
i just get so sick of playing her 
things get tough 
she jumps in the drink 
hamlet hogs all the good lines 
well  he s notorious for that 
we ve met before  haven t we 
no  i don t think so 
i m sam foster 
  athena 
  hi 
hi  are you joining the class 
no  i ve been looking for you 
as a matter of fact 
that s flattering  why 
i m a psychiatrist 
and i have a patient who  uh   
likes you very much 
that s an unusual way
of trying to get a date 
  what s his name 
  henry letham 
  sounds familiar 
  you served him coffee in a diner a couple of times 
you were nice to him  but the way
he tells it  you re the one good thing   
that ever happened to him 
henry 
is he very pale  very thin 
  his arms are scarred 
  yeah  that s him 
he always ate pecan pie with his coffee 
i remember that 
but i never spoke to him
outside the diner 
  oh 
  except 
yeah  what 
i feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist 
  you ll think i m insane 
  no 
i had the strangest feeling
about him 
i mean  he s this
ragged looking guy 
probably hasn t bathed in months 
but something about him 
i d seen him before 
somewhere 
i d known him 
  yeah 
  what s wrong with him 
he s going to kill himself 
why 
he thinks he s done something terrible 
that s my guess anyway 
i wish there was something
i could do to help 
actually  this probably won t help 
but i did run into him one time at a  smith s 
  a  smith s 
  the art bookstore 
he was sitting in the back  reading 
i don t know 
maybe he hangs out there
