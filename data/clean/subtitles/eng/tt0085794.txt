  this is not the time 
  if we could just drive away 
you can drop me off anywhere 
no  i have a very strict rule
about people getting in the car 
i hate to bring this up  and
i don t mean to be rude 
but i did put myself
on the line for you 
  go ahead  harvey  hit it 
  jerry  jerry 
 car horn honking 
here 
thanks 
  is that your initials 
  yeah 
i just wanna tell you 
my name is rupert pupkin 
i know the name doesn t mean very much to
you  but it means an awful lot to me  and   
  calm down  take your time 
  i m a little nervous 
you might have wondered who i am 
i ve been outside your show many times 
i m in communications now  but the point i m
trying to make is  by nature i m a comedian 
you re gonna say   not another one   but 
believe me  i m very good  i m dynamite 
i wouldn t take one minute of your time
if i wasn t convinced i m dynamite 
you re probably wondering   if he s so
good  how come he hasn t caught my act  
that s a very good question  and
i ll tell you why  you know why 
i ve been biding my time  slowly and
carefully  so that when my big break came   
like the night when jack paar
got sick  your big break 
that was the night that convinced
me i wanted to be a comedian 
i walked out of that show
like i was in a dream 
after that  i caught all your
guest appearances on sullivan 
i studied everything you did  the way you
built to your one liners  nice and relaxed 
how you delivered the jokes
without leaning too much on them 
how you didn t say   hey 
folks  here s the punch line  
you know  jerry 
you know what i m talking about 
you don t say   folks  here s the punch
line   you just do the punch line 
exactly  that s what i loved
about what you did 
so  what i m trying to say is that 
you see  now i m ready 
i m ready  and i ve
finished the course 
and i m thinking as i m sitting here now 
maybe this is my big break  my big chance 
you know what i mean 
what do you think 
 scoffs 
  what d you say your name was 
  rupert pupkin 
all right  look  pal 
gotta tell you   
this is a crazy business  but it s
not unlike any other business 
there are ground rules 
you don t just walk on to a
network show without experience 
it s an old hackneyed expression 
but it s the truth  you ve
got to start at the bottom 
  that s where i am  at the bottom 
  that s a perfect place to start 
i know that 
but there s gotta be a   
ah  it looks so simple to the viewer at
home  those things that come so easily   
that are so relaxed and look like it s a
matter of just taking another breath 
it takes years and years and years
of honing that and working it and   
there s only one problem  i don t mean
to interrupt you  i m 34 years old 
that s why i m asking
you if you ll listen to
my act and tell me what
you think about it 
i ll tell you what 
why don t you call my office 
  all right  okay  i could do that 
  you ask for cathy long  she s my secretary 
  and we ll make time to listen to you 
  uh   
you know how many times i ve had
this conversation in my head 
  did it always turn out this way 
  yeah  it did  heh 
i really believe this 
i think once you get over the initial
shyness  you re gonna be okay 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  i hope it works out for you 
  thanks  jerry  thanks a lot 
it s a pleasure meeting you  jerry 
jerry

don t mind just appetizers

it s okay  we re both adults 
when you re younger  you re
afraid to say those things   
but when you get older 
15   20 years later

lots of people think that guys

those people are just cynics   
embittered by their own failure 
i know  jerry  that you are as human
as the rest of us  if not more so 
no point in going on about it 
you know how i feel 
so let s get on with the show

rupert  goodbye 
goodbye 
at least once in his life
every man is a genius 
and  rupe  it s gonna be more
than once in your life for you 
it s gonna be a number of times 
because you ve got it 
from what i ve heard here  you ve
got it and you re stuck with it 
i don t care if you wanted to get rid of it 
you couldn t  it s always gonna be there 
now  i know there s no formula for it 
i just don t know how you do it 
and i m not curious  mind you 
because i wanna use the material 
i m just curious to know how you do it  i
really have to ask you  how do you do it 
i think it s that i
look at my whole life 
and i see the awful  terrible
things in my life   
and turn it into something funny 
it just happens 
were the first few
one liners strong enough 
if they were any stronger 
you d hurt yourself 
they re marvelous 
leave them alone 
i remember a man    a man said   
listen to me  listen to me 
a man said something very profound some
years ago  which i later originated 
 both chuckling 
if it ain t broke  don t fix it  you
wanna know how i know it s so good 
yes 
because i envy you 
i hate you  but i envy you 
because it s purity  it s
marvelous  it s humor based on you 
no one else could do it but you  i wouldn t
lie  i wouldn t lie to you  rupe 
now  look  this weekend would be a perfect

you have a long night ahead 
rupert  i have something to say 
  you ve got more than enough to say 
you re driving me nuts  can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute and let me rest 
with this gun 
you re driving me crazy 
you have not shut up since
we walked into my house 
this is my house 
this is my domain 
jerry is my guest and you re my guest 
and you re lucky to be here 
you get to change in my house  you get
your head together for the show tonight 
why don t you give me a little break 
why can t you give me a break  shut up 
rupert  you shut up  i did give you a break 
i listened to you talk about that sweater 
worrying about the sleeves 
the color  did i say anything 
i didn t make it for you  i made it
for jerry  it looks fabulous 
whose idea was this anyway  if it wasn t
for me  you wouldn t even be here 
why didn t you listen to the tape when
i asked you to  was that so hard to do 
i m sure you can understand  doing the kind
of show i m doing  it s mind boggling 
there s so much stuff that comes down 
you can t keep your head clear 
and if that s the case  i m wrong 
you re right  i m wrong 
if i m wrong  i apologize 
i m just a human being  with all of
the foibles and all of the traps 
the show  the pressure  the groupies 
the autograph hounds  the crew 
the incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends   
and you re not sure if you re gonna
be there tomorrow because of them 
wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing  radiant day in your life 
it s terrific  okay  if all
of that means nothing   
if i m wrong 
in spite of all that   
then i apologize  i m sorry 
if you accept my apology  i think we should
shake hands and we ll forget the whole thing 
i won t press charges  you two could be in
deep trouble  but i will not press charges 
  ahh  that s easy for you to say  jerry 
jerry  but i mean it 
i mean  i ll go to the office
and tell them all it s a gag 
they ll understand that  if i tell
them it s a gag  they re gonna buy it 
and then we ll put the
tape on and listen   
sit down  i said  sit down 
you heard what he said 
yeah  right  all of a sudden with a
gun on him  he wants to be friends 
  what happens when he walks out the door 
  what happens then  jerry 
  you get to his office  and they jump you 
  is that what happens  jerry 
not if i tell them not to  they won t
jump you  no one s gonna jump you 
if i tell them to do something 
they do it  no one s gonna jump you 
now  that s the truth  you
have to take my word for it 
if you think i m not telling you
the truth  then don t respond 
if you think i m telling you the truth 
then let me get the hell out of here 
  he gives me his word 
  and what else 
and what else  jerry 
there is nothing else 
just my word 
isn t my word good enough 
i m sorry  jerry 
suppose we tape him  he doesn t
talk  it gets to be 11 30 
do we put him on  no matter what 
you can go ahead and tape him  it  uh  won t
hurt anything  you always can erase it 
we may learn something from it
and  uh  it ll also buy us time 
under no circumstances will
we put this man on the air 
this lunatic is threatening jerry s life
and you re not gonna put him on the air 
let s not get too excited  i don t
think you understand  we ll tape at 7 
we won t have to make a decision about
putting him on the air till 11 30 
this gives us four hours  hopefully  by that
time  we ll have mr  langford back safely 
harry  that s it  we re suing  we re going
to sue  we re gonna sue everybody 
  who is this man 
  jerry s lawyer 
what do you mean  who am i 
i m the one who s suing  i m the lawyer 
  jay   
jay  don t  jay  me  please  do me a favor 
jay  who are you going to sue 
you  we re suing you  personally 
harry  who else are you suing 
  the fbi 
we have a serious situation and i
want it dealt with rationally 
unless we start talking politely 
there s gonna be serious consequences 
jay  there is nothing
polite about kidnapping 
it is one of the most
stupid offenses ever 
where s the defense of kidnapping 
how can you say  i was crazy  
 i didn t know what i was doing 
i did it on the spur of the moment  
jay  who cares 
jay  only an idiot kidnaps  and only an idiot
decides to do what you guys are doing 
jerry  i m gonna go now 
pretty soon you ll be able to go  about
12   12 30  as i said  have a good time 
i know you will  heh 
bye 
first of all  we don t know whether we re
dealing with kidnappers or terrorists 
terrorists  terrorists 
what do you mean  terrorists 
you might have this man go on the
air  deliver a coded message   
and possibly 50 people around the
country would lose their lives 
  you re out of your mind 
  i m not out of my mind 
that guy is gonna be taped 
and we ll listen to what he says 
unless something horrendous is on that tape 
we re gonna put that tape on the air 
all we re dealing with here is 10 minutes
of talk show time against a man s life   
and i don t see that
as any argument 
hello  how are you today 
well  i m calling   
mr  king calling collect
long distance for mr  thomas 
mr  thomas  there s a
long distance call 
thomas  let s go

could i speak to jerry 
no  jerry s not with us  we re at a
payphone  don t have the call traced 
i noticed you just did  i heard
the sounds  i do know those sounds 
it s kind of important  so that we know that
he s in    what ll i say     your care 
we ve taken care of that by bringing along an
article of clothing that you will recognize 
it is not as easy as you think just to walk
in the studio  go right on the show   
no  bert   
if i could call you  uh   
well  if i could just say  there is no
problem  the material is clean material 
  do you know of standards and practices 
rupert  no  but that can be discussed 
all i can say is don t
have any press leaks 
you must keep the audience there until 11 45
or 12 00  after it has been aired nationally 
thank you  we ll discuss the other things 
that s your problem  nice talking to you 
boy  he s shrewd  he just 
uh  wouldn t buy anything

impulsive tonight

i have so much to tell you 
i don t know where to start 
i wanna tell you everything about
myself  everything you don t know 
do you like these glasses  crystal 
beautiful  i bought them just for you 
there s something about them 
just the simplicity of them 
but if you don t like them  if there s even
an inkling  even a doubt in your mind   
 glass shatters 
sometimes during the clay i ll
just be doing the simplest things 
i ll be taking a bath
and i ll say to myself 
 heh  i wonder if jerry s
taking a bath right now  
and i just hope  you know  you re
not drowning or something  heh 
i just get really worried about you

either  which was fine with me 
but i love you 
want some wine  no  okay 
i m not in the mood to
drink either though 
but i m sure in the mood
to be alone with you 
why don t we just
clear off the table 
i was thinking why don t we go
upstairs  but that s so predictable 
let s just take everything off
the table and do it right here 
that would blow your mind  it would blow my
mind  i ve never done anything like that 
i ve never even had anybody over for
dinner  let alone made love on the table 
 chuckles

so will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest king of comedy   
rupert pupkin 
good evening  ladies and gentlemen 
let me introduce myself 
my name is rupert pupkin 
 audience applauds 
i was born in clifton  new jersey  which
was not at that time a federal offense 
 audience laughing 
is there anyone here from clifton 
good  we can all relax now 
 audience laughs 
now  i d like to begin by saying
that my parents were too poor   
to afford me a childhood
in clifton   
but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in clifton 
once you fall below a certain
level  they exile you to passaic 
 audience laughing 
but my parents did put the first
two down payments on my childhood 
don t get me wrong 
but they did also return me
to the hospital as defective 
 audience laughing 
but like everyone else  i grew up
in large part thanks to my mother 
if she were only
here today  i d say 
 hey  mom  what are you doing here 
you ve been dead for nine years  
 audience laughing 
but seriously  you should ve seen
my mother  she was wonderful 
blond  beautiful 
intelligent  alcoholic   
 audience laughing 
we used to drink milk together after school 
mine was homogenized  hers was loaded 
 audience laughs 
once they picked her up for speeding 
they clocked her doing 50 
all right  but in our garage 
 audience laughing and applauding 
and  you know  when
they tested her 
they found out that her
alcohol had 2 percent blood 
 audience laughing and applauding 
but we used to joke
together  mom and me   
until the tears would stroll down her
face and she would throw up  yeah 
and who would clean it up 
ha  not dad 
he was too busy down at o grady s 
throwing up on his own  yeah 
in fact  until i was 16  i thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity 
 audience laughs 
while the other kids were off in
the woods sneaking cigarettes   
i was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat 
 audience laughing and applauding 
the only problem was i never got anywhere 
until one day my father caught me 
and  you know  just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck   
i managed to heave
all over his new shoes 
 that s it   i thought 
 i ve made it  i m finally a man  
 audience laughing and applauding 
but  as it turned out 
i was wrong 
that was the only attention
my father ever gave me 
audience  aw   
yeah  he was usually too busy out in the
park playing ball with my sister rose 
audience  aw   
but today  i must say  thanks to
those many hours of practice   
my sister rose has
grown into a fine man 
 audience laughing 
me  i wasn t interested
in athletics 
the only exercise i ever got was
when the other kids picked on me 
they used to beat me up once
a week  usually tuesday 
 audience laughs 
and after a while  the school
worked it into the curriculum 
 audience laughs 
and if you knocked me out 
you got extra credit 
 audience laughing 
except there was this one kid 
poor kid  he was afraid of me 
i used to tell him   hit me  hit me 
what s the matter with you 
don t you wanna graduate  
 audience cheering and applauding 
as for me  hey  i was
the youngest kid
in the history of the school
to graduate in traction 
 laughing 
but  you know  my only real interest  right
from the beginning  was show business 
even as a young man  i began at the
very top  collecting autographs 
 audience laughs 
now   
a lot of you are probably wondering
why jerry isn t with us tonight 
well  i ll tell you 
the fact is he s tied up 
and i m the one who tied him 
 audience laughing 
i know you think i m joking  but that s the
only way i could break into show business   
by hijacking jerry langford 
right now jerry is strapped to a chair
somewhere in the middle of this city 
 audience laughing 
go ahead and laugh  thank you  i appreciate
it  but the fact is  i m here 
tomorrow you ll know i wasn t kidding
and you ll think i was crazy 
but  look  i figure it this way  better to be
king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime 
 audience laughing and cheering 
thank you  thank you 
 audience cheering on tv 
 police siren wailing on tv 
  how d you do that 
  did you like it  thank you 
i d like to buy everyone here a drink 
and i hope you all enjoyed the show 
  rita  you keep the change 
gerrity  we re getting langford now 
rita  just because i made it big doesn t
mean i m gonna forget about you 
  remember  i ll call you   
  no more speeches 
man  what s happening here 
rita  take care 
that s the same guy who was just
on television  just now  same guy 
i m just getting even  those jokes   
those jokes were murder 
  you didn t like those jokes 
  no  no 
i m looking for the guy
that wrote the material 
i d like to pick him
up and take him along 
i wrote the material  i disagree with you 
i thought they were very good jokes 
if you wrote that material 
i got one piece of advice for you 
throw yourself on your knees in front
of the judge and beg for mercy 
that s very funny  but you ll see
