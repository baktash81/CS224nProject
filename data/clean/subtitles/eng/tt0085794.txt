on the line for you
go ahead harvey hit it
jerry jerry
car horn honking
here
thanks
is that your initials
yeah
i just wanna tell you
my name is rupert pupkin
i know the name doesnt mean very much to
you but it means an awful lot to me and
calm down take your time
im a little nervous
you might have wondered who i am
ive been outside your show many times
im in communications now but the point im
trying to make is by nature im a comedian
youre gonna say not another one but
believe me im very good im dynamite
i wouldnt take one minute of your time
if i wasnt convinced im dynamite
youre probably wondering if hes so
good how come he hasnt caught my act
thats a very good question and
ill tell you why you know why
ive been biding my time slowly and
carefully so that when my big break came
like the night when jack paar
got sick your big break
that was the night that convinced
me i wanted to be a comedian
i walked out of that show
like i was in a dream
after that i caught all your
guest appearances on sullivan
i studied everything you did the way you
built to your oneliners nice and relaxed
how you delivered the jokes
without leaning too much on them
how you didnt say hey
folks heres the punch line
you know jerry
you know what im talking about
you dont say folks heres the punch
line you just do the punch line
exactly thats what i loved
about what you did
so what im trying to say is that
you see now im ready
im ready and ive
finished the course
and im thinking as im sitting here now
maybe this is my big break my big chance
you know what i mean
what do you think
scoffs
whatd you say your name was
rupert pupkin
all right look pal
gotta tell you
this is a crazy business but its
not unlike any other business
there are ground rules
you dont just walk on to a
network show without experience
its an old hackneyed expression
but its the truth youve
got to start at the bottom
thats where i am at the bottom
thats a perfect place to start
i know that
but theres gotta be a
ah it looks so simple to the viewer at
home those things that come so easily
that are so relaxed and look like its a
matter of just taking another breath
it takes years and years and years
of honing that and working it and
theres only one problem i dont mean
to interrupt you im 34 years old
thats why im asking
you if youll listen to
my act and tell me what
you think about it
ill tell you what
why dont you call my office
all right okay i could do that
you ask for cathy long shes my secretary
and well make time to listen to you
uh
you know how many times ive had
this conversation in my head
did it always turn out this way
yeah it did heh
i really believe this
i think once you get over the initial
shyness youre gonna be okay
yeah
yeah
i hope it works out for you
thanks jerry thanks a lot

dont mind just appetizers
ill take you to dinner sometime

listening to this material

as the rest of us if not more so
no point in going on about it

absolutely honest
we dont think youre ready yet
dont think im ready
we dont feel that youre right for jerry
right for jerry mmhm
some of the material is good

for instance are not very strong
theyre not very strong you didnt
like some of the jokes is that it
thats right
good i can take care of that
just tell me the ones you
dont like and no problem
actually thats a great help
great
we think you have a good potential
your timing is excellent
but you should keep
developing your act
you ought to test it in
a few live situations

very good for you

clubs that you can try
when you start working in one of those
give us a call well send someone down

for jerry it looks fabulous
whose idea was this anyway if it wasnt
for me you wouldnt even be here
why didnt you listen to the tape when
i asked you to was that so hard to do
im sure you can understand doing the kind
of show im doing its mindboggling
theres so much stuff that comes down
you cant keep your head clear
and if thats the case im wrong
youre right im wrong
if im wrong i apologize
im just a human being with all of
the foibles and all of the traps
the show the pressure the groupies
the autograph hounds the crew
the incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends
and youre not sure if youre gonna
be there tomorrow because of them
wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing radiant day in your life
its terrific okay if all
of that means nothing
if im wrong
in spite of all that
then i apologize im sorry
if you accept my apology i think we should
shake hands and well forget the whole thing
i wont press charges you two could be in
deep trouble but i will not press charges
ahh thats easy for you to say jerry
jerry but i mean it
i mean ill go to the office
and tell them all its a gag
theyll understand that if i tell
them its a gag theyre gonna buy it
and then well put the
tape on and listen
sit down i said sit down
you heard what he said
yeah right all of a sudden with a
gun on him he wants to be friends
what happens when he walks out the door
what happens then jerry
you get to his office and they jump you
is that what happens jerry
not if i tell them not to they wont
jump you no ones gonna jump you
if i tell them to do something
they do it no ones gonna jump you
now thats the truth you
have to take my word for it
if you think im not telling you
the truth then dont respond
if you think im telling you the truth
then let me get the hell out of here
he gives me his word
and what else
and what else jerry
there is nothing else
just my word
isnt my word good enough
im sorry jerry
suppose we tape him he doesnt
talk it gets to be 1130
do we put him on no matter what
you can go ahead and tape him it uh wont
hurt anything you always can erase it
we may learn something from it
and uh itll also buy us time
under no circumstances will
we put this man on the air
this lunatic is threatening jerrys life
and youre not gonna put him on the air
lets not get too excited i dont
think you understand well tape at 7
we wont have to make a decision about
putting him on the air till 1130

rupert pupkin
good evening ladies and gentlemen
let me introduce myself
my name is rupert pupkin
audience applauds
i was born in clifton new jersey which
was not at that time a federal offense
audience laughing
is there anyone here from clifton
good we can all relax now
audience laughs
now id like to begin by saying
that my parents were too poor
to afford me a childhood
in clifton
but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in clifton
once you fall below a certain
level they exile you to passaic
audience laughing
but my parents did put the first
two down payments on my childhood
dont get me wrong
but they did also return me
to the hospital as defective
audience laughing
but like everyone else i grew up
in large part thanks to my mother
if she were only
here today id say
hey mom what are you doing here
youve been dead for nine years
audience laughing
but seriously you shouldve seen
my mother she was wonderful
blond beautiful
intelligent alcoholic
audience laughing
we used to drink milk together after school
mine was homogenized hers was loaded
audience laughs
once they picked her up for speeding
they clocked her doing 50
all right but in our garage
audience laughing and applauding
and you know when
they tested her
they found out that her
alcohol had 2 percent blood
audience laughing and applauding
but we used to joke
together mom and me
until the tears would stroll down her
face and she would throw up yeah
and who would clean it up
ha not dad
he was too busy down at ogradys
throwing up on his own yeah
in fact until i was 16 i thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity
audience laughs
while the other kids were off in
the woods sneaking cigarettes
i was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat
audience laughing and applauding
the only problem was i never got anywhere
until one day my father caught me
and you know just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck
i managed to heave
all over his new shoes
thats it i thought
ive made it im finally a man
audience laughing and applauding
but as it turned out
i was wrong
that was the only attention
my father ever gave me
audience aw
yeah he was usually too busy out in the
park playing ball with my sister rose
audience aw
but today i must say thanks to
those many hours of practice
my sister rose has
grown into a fine man
audience laughing
me i wasnt interested
in athletics
the only exercise i ever got was
when the other kids picked on me
they used to beat me up once
a week usually tuesday
audience laughs
and after a while the school
worked it into the curriculum
audience laughs
and if you knocked me out
you got extra credit
audience laughing
except there was this one kid
poor kid he was afraid of me
i used to tell him hit me hit me
whats the matter with you
dont you wanna graduate
audience cheering and applauding
as for me hey i was
the youngest kid
in the history of the school
to graduate in traction
laughing
but you know my only real interest right
from the beginning was show business
even as a young man i began at the
very top collecting autographs
audience laughs
now
a lot of you are probably wondering
why jerry isnt with us tonight
well ill tell you
the fact is hes tied up
and im the one who tied him
audience laughing
i know you think im joking but thats the
only way i could break into show business
by hijacking jerry langford
right now jerry is strapped to a chair
somewhere in the middle of this city
audience laughing
go ahead and laugh thank you i appreciate
it but the fact is im here
tomorrow youll know i wasnt kidding
and youll think i was crazy
but look i figure it this way better to be
king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime
audience laughing and cheering
thank you thank you
audience cheering on tv
police siren wailing on tv
howd you do that
did you like it thank you
id like to buy everyone here a drink
and i hope you all enjoyed the show
rita you keep the change
