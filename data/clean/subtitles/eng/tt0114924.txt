from now on  
  from now on  
okay  there are two things that
i remember about my childhood 
i just don t remember it
being this orange 
first  i remember being with my dad 
he would get these
far off looks in his eye 
and he would say 
 life doesn t always turn out
the way you plan  
i just wish i d realized at the time
he was talking about my life 
but that never stopped us
from taking our adventures together 
he would pack up
our sometimes working car 
and he would tell me amazing stories
about strange and exotic lands
as we headed off to exciting
destinations like milwaukee 
it s amazing how exotic wisconsin    isn t 
but my favorite memories
were the stories
that he would tell me about my mom 
he would take me to the church
where they got married 
and i d beg him to tell me more
about the ceremony
and about my crazy uncle irwin 
who fell asleep
in the macaroni and cheese 
and i asked my dad when he
knew that he truly loved my mom 
and he said to me   lucy 
your mother gave me a special gift 
 she gave me the world  
actually it was a globe with a light in it 
but for the romantic that he was 
it might as well have been the world 
well  the first time i saw him 
he didn t exactly give me the world 
it was a dollar fifty train token 
but i looked forward to it
every single day 
he started coming to my booth
between 8 01 and 8 15 every morning 
monday through friday 
and he was just perfect 
my prince charming 
well  we ve never actually spoken 
but i know someday we will 
i know it  i just know it 
and i know that someday
i will find a way to introduce myself 
and that s gonna be perfect 
just like my prince 
 45 for a christmas tree
and they don t deliver 
you order  10 worth of chow chow mein
from mr  wong s 
they bring it to your door 
i should ve gotten the blue spruce

i always wanted him to find a nice girl 
i m so glad he found you 
peter 
  why did you say that 
  say what 
  i m not his fiancée 
  why did you tell me that you were 
i m not engaged 
i ve never even spoken to the guy 
what  but downstairs you said   
you said you were gonna marry him 
i was talking to myself 
well  next time you talk to yourself 
tell yourself you re single
and end the conversation 
  what am i gonna do 
  i don t know 
she held me so tight 
you know  i couldn t tell her 
  i know 
  excuse me  nurse 
  is there a pharmacy in the hospital 
  what do you need 
elsie  she wants nitroglycerin 
for her heart problem 
problem 
problems 
you know something 
i think you saved her life

the whole family 
bless you 
why don t you come with me 
i ll take you down there 
so 
tell us how you met peter 
ma  she doesn t wanna
talk about that now  okay 
why not 
could use a nice story 
  how do you know it was nice 
  of course it was nice 
why shouldn t it be nice 
what about that other girl 
the one he met in the bar 
what s that got to do
with the price of eggs 
  ashley bartlett bacon 
  ox 
all i know is
she was pretty high and mighty
for someone named after breakfast meat 
well  he has a nice girl now 
so did you steal him from ashley 
i bet it was love at first sight  right 
i have a sense about these things 
  elsie  let her tell it 
  she is telling it 
i bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his   
what was it about him that 
you know  first struck you 
  it was his  smile 
  they re caps 
six hundred bucks a tooth 
well  we saw each other
and  he smiled 
and   
and i knew that my life
would never be the same 
so   
  tomorrow night  8 00 
  what 
i got ice capades 
i know a guy 
hi 
bet you re wondering what i m doing
here in the middle of the night 
well  i thought
i should introduce myself 
my name s lucy 
lucy eleanor moderatz 
think you should know
your family thinks we re engaged 
never been engaged before 
this is all very sudden for me 
what i really came here to tell you
was that
i didn t mean for this to happen 
i don t know what to do 
i mean  if you were awake 
i wouldn t be in this mess 
oh  god 
not that i m blaming you  sorry 
it s just that  you know 
when i was a kid 
i always imagined what i would be like 
or where i would be 
or what i would have when i got older 
and  you know  it was the normal stuff 
you know  i d have a house and family
and things like that 
you know  not that i m complaining
or anything 
because  you know  i have a cat 
i have an apartment 
sole possession of the remote control 
that s very important 
it s just   
i never met anybody
that i could laugh with  you know 
do you believe in love at first sight 
no  i bet you don t 
you re probably too sensible for that 
or have you ever  like  seen somebody 
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you  they would   
well  they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with 
have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven t even talked to 
have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma 
brian lynch  mr  brian lynch

  watch out  watch out 
this whole evening did not work out
well at all  and   
and i m supposed to share
some responsibility in that 
no  would you slow down a little bit 
look  it was just a misunderstanding 
and on top of the joe jr  thing   
excuse me 
it s nothing 
no  no  no  there s no nothing now 
what joe jr  thing 
the leaning thing 
the leaning thing 
  yeah 
  okay 
what do you mean by the leaning   
because he gave me flowers 
and then you leaned 
  and then i leaned 
  yeah 
okay  how did i lean when i leaned 
  how were you leaning 
  yeah 
it was a lot different than hugging 
hugging s very different 
hugging  that involves arms and hands 
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this 
leaning involves wanting
and accepting  leaning 
hey  luce 
is this guy bothering you 
no  no 
are you sure 
because it looks like he s leaning 
thank you  see 
i ll be right over here
if you need me 
okay  thank you very much 
i know karate 
okay  is   
now  all right 
what about the other thing 
the other thing 
the other misunderstanding 
why did you think i was pregnant 
well  mary said that she had heard
something like that 
and you believed her 
i didn t have any reason
not to believe her 
so the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me
is if i was pregnant  right 
no  no 
good night

you re not really peter s type 
yeah  jack  all right

i want you not to be unhappy 
and what are you 
the happiness guru  jack

i don t remember you having
had a conversation with your father 
you wanna leave the business  don t you 
is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here 
what do you know about my family 
spending a week with them
does not make you an expert 
spending a lifetime with them
hasn t made you one either 
yeah  well  i know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated 
would your father be happy knowing
you re sitting in a token booth

  you sure  saul 
  yeah  yeah  sure 
  see you  son 
  see you  dad 
peter  i ve known you
since you were born 
i ve been to every major event
in your life from cub scouts to   
well  to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel 
you ve got a good education 
you re very popular
with all those friends of yours 
you make a nice living 
and everybody knows
you re a good looking kid 
but  peter  you re a putz 
excuse me 
now  look  i m your godfather 
i mean  i love you 
i couldn t love you any more
if you were my own son 
but the fact of the matter is you re   
well  you re a putz 
is there a point to this 
lucy 
peter  there s something
you have to know about her 
you see  she   
well   
she s   
you know   
she s not only your fiancée 
she s your guardian angel 
yeah 
peter  she saved your life 
now  she s coming to see you today 
and i want you to do yourself a favor 
i want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man
who has just been given
a second chance at life 
and after two minutes 
if you re not madly in love with her 
why  tell her you wanna break up 
and you can go back to being a putz 
but if in the two minutes 
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see 
you will propose to her
for the second time 
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape 
before she comes  take a little time
and think about
what an old putz just told you 
all right 
you know  if i was 40 years younger 
i d marry her myself 
that is  if she d convert 
  hey  that s a joke 
  i know 
lucy 
  hi

  really 
yeah 
please sit down 
i saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels 
they never call  they never write 
that was a long time ago 
yeah  i guess we don t get to do
many heroic things as an adult 
that s for sure 
you do  though 
no  jumping in front of
that train was unusual 
i don t think i ve done anything
truly heroic my whole life 
i chased a purse snatcher once 
well  that s something 
i pretended to pull a hamstring 
well  most guys probably wouldn t have
chased after him in the first place 
i mean  i work at the l 
believe me  i know 
you give up your seat
every day in the train 
well   
that s not heroic 
it is to the person who sits in it 
and you always gave me something
to look forward to every day  so   
you know  you do remind me of someone 
it s probably you 
excuse me  excuse me  ma am 
what apartment

what is she 
she s   
i d say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her 
she drives you so nuts 
you don t know whether to hug her
or just really arm wrestle her 
she would go all the way to europe
just to get a stamp in her passport 
i don t know if that amounts to insanity
or just being really  really likeable 
no  that s not it 
but she s gotta be really special 
she s gotta be

i don t have to know in a year 
or 10 years 
i don t have to   
i don t have to have
all the answers today  or   
maybe someday i ll have a clue

i work every holiday  i go home to a cat 
and now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him 
and i have said yes 
okay  okay  that makes me
a raving  total lunatic 
the wedding is tomorrow  lucy 
i know it s tomorrow  jerry 
but i even wish it were yesterday 
that would mean that today
that i would be on my honeymoon 
that i would finally have a stamp
in my passport 
and that it would say italy on it 
what happened with the other guy 
he didn t want me 
  maybe she forgot 
  a woman doesn t forget her wedding 
maybe she s stuck in traffic 
  this isn t    does this look ridiculous 
  no  you look fine 
  all right  well  you got the rings 
  yeah  i got the rings 
what s the matter with you  jack

it s a toss up 
what do you mean 
here she is 
she s a little nervous 
she s lovely 
dearly beloved  we are gathered here
today to join   
i object 
i didn t get to that part yet 
i would have to object  too 
what about you 
  i m thinking 
  what the hell is going on 
i am in love with your son 
  i know 
  not that one 
that one 
jack  what the hell did you do 
he didn t do anything 
he didn t do anything 
it was me  it was all me 
elsie  how are you doing 
you doing okay 
do you remember
that day at the hospital 
of course you remember
that day at the hospital 
well  there was a little mix up 
i saw peter get pushed onto the tracks 
and i saved his life 
but when i got to the hospital 
they wouldn t let me see him 
so someone told the doctor
that i was his fiancée 
only   
it s not true 
i was never engaged to peter 
why didn t you say something 
because i didn t know how to tell you 
we never even met
until that day on the tracks 
it s just when we were
in the hospital room 
everything happened so fast 
and i couldn t tell you the truth 
and then i didn t wanna
tell you the truth 
because the truth was that
i fell in love with you 
you fell in love with me 
no  no  yes  all of you 
i went from being all alone
to being a fiancée 
a daughter  a granddaughter  a sister 
and a friend 
i might have saved your life
on the tracks  but you know what 
you really saved mine 
you allowed me
to be a part of your family 
and i haven t had that
in a really long time 
and i just didn t wanna let go of that 
so even though
it was just for a little while 
i will love them always 
i m very sorry 
and i m very sorry about your carpet 
what about my carpet 
peter callaghan is engaged to me 
i object to this wedding 
get in line 
and i object to your objection 
who s that 
ashley s husband 
you proposed to a married woman 
yes  and i was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my   
sort of my fiancée 
  peter  how could you do this 
  listen  a deal is a deal 
you two are better off together 
stop yelling 
hey 
hold on 
hold on  just hold it right there 
hey  luce 
i just wanted to say that i m sorry
things didn t work out with that guy 
and  you know  right now 
you should get in touch
with the child within
and explore your feminine side 
and  you know  don t start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that 
because you ll blow up
like my aunt roberta  you know 
you deserve better than that 
so how are things going
with miss third floor 
she s   
  joey  joey 
  she said that i   
  what 
  do you have any cookies 
no  you know what 
  we can try on some of my shoes 
  okay 
  hey  last day 
  yeah 
  i m gonna miss you 
  i m gonna miss you 
  we ll see each other 
  you better 
  of course 
  all right 
  bye 
  see you 
lucy 
i need to ask you a question 
get down on your knee 
it s more romantic 
he s proposing  let him do it 
i am letting him do it 
can i come in there  please 
i can t 
not without a token 
he just put the token in 
really 
i didn t notice 
marry me 
yeah 
i love you 
i love you back 
  that s nice 
  i m so happy 
so i had planned to marry
peter  but i married jack instead 
thank goodness my father was right 
life doesn t always turn out
the way you plan 
but jack  jack gave me the perfect gift 
a stamp in my passport 
he took me to florence
for our honeymoon 
i guess you might say
he gave me the world 
peter once asked me when
it was that i fell in love with jack 
and i told him 
 it was while you were sleeping  
  when my world is turnin   
  when it s turnin 
upside down  
  when all i see is rain  
  when i think
the night won t end  
  i just think of you  
  and i can see
the sun again  
  ooh  wherever would i be  
  without ya  
    if i didn t have you

  whatever would

  wherever would i be
without ya  
    i d be nowhere

  nowhere  
  when the dreams i dream
all seem  
  a million miles away  
  when i m sure
i ll never win  
  when it s lookin  like
i lost my faith  
    i just look at you  baby

  and i got reason
to believe again  
  ooh  wherever would i be
