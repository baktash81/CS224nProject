mr caproni
i have a question
do you think i could
design airplanes
ill never be a pilot
im too nearsighted
listen japanese boy
im not a pilot
i dont even know how to fly
to fly airplanes is simple
but i am a creator of airplanes
an aeronautical engineer
yes
listen to me japanese boy
airplanes are not tools for war
they are not for making money
airplanes are beautiful dreams
engineers turn dreams into reality
yes
arrivederci well meet again
jiro you should go to bed
you startled me
i heard you talking to someone

le vent se lève
ii faut tenter de vivre
hey jiro ready
all the new buildings
are oldfashioned
the streets are wider
even the airplanes havent changed
welcome
mackerel again
its great
every days the same
same lunch same lectures

try the pork sometime
were more than ten years behind
what
beautiful isnt it
look at that wonderful curve
you eat mackerel
to look at the bones
come on finish up
were going for coffee
jiro sure is working hard
fish bones

are you cold
im fine i never dreamed
tokyo would recover so quickly
can i stay with you jiro
father wont let me
live here by myself
ill probably be in nagoya
by the time you come
with an airplane company
yes
men have it so good
i want to study medicine in tokyo
a doctor i think
you might be a good one
i think so too
ill talk to father
next time im home
thanks im counting on you
jiro
there you are
you made it
finally
were on our way
yes we are
they mustve been
heading for the city
there were hundreds of them
theres no work in the countryside
another bank failure
which one is it this time
are those the customers
looks like it
there were rumors
the economys in the tank
so is our new employer
mitsubishi internal
combustion engine co
weve been waiting for you
what took you so long
i was told to come
anytime in april
then you shouldve come in march
ive got an assignment for you
its the design for the wing strut fitting
i need it right away
were behind schedule already
in here
the datas ready
this way
this is your desk
its imported
but no one likes it
data here hat goes there
listen up the falcon project
has a new engineer
hes the genius weve all
been hearing about
introduce yourself
jiro horikoshi
now get to work
jiro come on
its lunchtime lets go
the assembly plant
yes id like to take a look
asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing
two
excuse me
could we ask a favor
look its really coming along
sorry to bother you on your break
not at all you young engineers
should visit us more often
honjo the struts already installed
i knew it
kurokawas just hazing you
is his fitting better than yours
mr kurokawas always hard
on new employees
honjo get up here
and take a look
i need your opinion
what do you think
looks strong enough
this is no good
its just like my design
then it must be bad
foreman lunch breaks over
quiet
fascinating aircraft are fascinating
maybe they are but were late
im hattori
mr hattori is our chief engineer
is this his first assignment
the strut fitting for the falcon
thats no fitting
explain yourself young man
yes sir this leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing
the wire expands
and contracts automatically
it runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage
but wed have to
redesign the wing
youre right
i havent done the calculations yet
youre wasting your time
wheres the assignment i gave you
its finished
that looks like
a very clean design to me
its perfect
submit your work
as soon as you finish
im heading out
me too
what about kurokawas homework
just finishing up
oxen
they haul prototypes
to the airfield
the latest aircraft hauled by oxen
thats how backward we are
but theyre wonderful creatures
here she comes
get ready
approaching the mark
damn it
did you get it
133 seconds 145 knots
too slow
we need ten more knots
shes too low
the engines not performing
kurokawa
representatives from the army
an audacious design
another coup for mitsubishi
your falcon is quite impressive
power dive
shes trying to break 200
parachutes open
go get him
mr kurokawa well investigate
the cause when the weather clears
what about the pilot
hes okay
thats good
mr kurokawa lets go
well build falcon two
do you think the strut fitting failed
no i think the problem
is deeper and more complicated
ill never forget what i saw today
its like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes
there wont be a falcon two
the army has decided
to go with a competing design
today was our last chance
to change their minds
were going to build a bomber
with help from junkers
no more fighters for now
this is your chance to see germany
ive already approved it
still open
ah welcome back
youre later than usual
two slices of the usual
coming up
there you are
isnt anyone looking after them
their parents work late
they wait there every night
i feel bad closing the place up
i see well thanks
come again
you must be hungry
heres something to eat
its sponge cake
i just bought it
go ahead take it
come on
you here jiro
too bad about the falcon
i heard they axed it
sponge cake you have
some strange eating habits
what did you expect
did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you
of course not
well maybe i did
there are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood
the cost of one fitting would feed
that kids family for a month
why is japan so poor
jiro do you know what were paying
the germans for their technology
enough to feed every kid in japan
with sponge cake for dessert
still i plan to make the most
of this opportunity
theyre sending you too
they told me today
really thats great news
poor countries want airplanes
so they pay us a lot
to design them its ironic
im leaving for tokyo tomorrow
getting married
married
to work hard at the office
you need a family at home
more irony
tightfisted germans
theyre hardly showing us anything
i dont see any oxen
the airstrips
next to the plant
everythings so big
its the g38
is this what were buying
for conversion to a bomber
its top secret
whos the army planning
to bomb with this thing
america probably
not that they could
still its quite something
amazing
passengers can sit in the wings
this would be wasted as a bomber
who cares we need
their allmetal airframe technology
youre kidding
we cant go inside
beautiful
stop it
take your hands off him
is this how germans
treat their guests
you japanese copy everything
this technology belongs to germany
oh come on japan has
lots of planes like this
honjo let it go
we have a license
to your technology
we signed an agreement
we have the right to be here
your bosses never said
we couldnt inspect this airplane
im sure youre only
trying to do your job
but we wont tolerate this treatment
the agreement is between equals
our orders were not to let
you japanese wander around
thats dr junkers
what an engineer
you can go inside
dr junkers has agreed
im surprised we got a demonstration
theres more vibration
than i expected
our bosses are getting giddy
let the army officers sit here
just a moment
this is truly a stupendous aircraft
look a corridor through the wing
this is amazing
its like being inside a power plant
guten tag
dr junkers gave us permission
please show us your work station
this is the flight engineers station
this aircraft is marvelous
japanese do not go further
of course my friend
this is incredible
yes its fantastic
a triumph of
german industrial technology
dr junkers is my hero
but his company is sneaky
got a cigarette jiro
jiro
a cigarette
no were out
it looks cold outside
but this room is cozy
i thought germans used fireplaces
junkers makes radiators too
this almost looks like that plane
its beautiful
and our technology is primitive
thats what you mean right
you think well never figure out
allmetal construction on our own
we cant learn anything from this
these are just pretty equations
this technology belongs to germany
maybe we dont even
need their technology
wood and canvas
could be as good as metal
then well never make it
were already 20 years behind
lets take a walk
my brain is boiling
were achilles chasing a tortoise
with a twentyyear lead
if we close the gap
in five years
hell be five more years
down the road
well always be chasing him
someday well overtake him
and move ahead
i wonder if we
can be the tortoise
what
listen to that
schuberts winter journey
its perfect for us
what was that about
we saw him in the hangar
jiro
im done go have a bath
dead to the world
with a face like hes carrying
the future of japanese aviation
theres a telegram from headquarters
come in
not necessary
some of us are returning immediately
youre staying behind
jiro will continue west
and return to japan
west
they want him to see the world
all by himself
mr caproni
is the wind still rising
yes it is
then i invite you to join me
on my final flight come
youre retiring
its a big jump
jump
hurry were taking off
theres a hatch under the fuselage
hurry
let me through
up here
full power
fly fly
my workmens families and relatives
practically the whole village
were taking a private jaunt
before we deliver this bomber
to the air force
what do you think
its incredible
its like a building
out of ancient rome
this plane is too large
to be used for war
but the air force
likes everything big
japan is poor and backward
we could never build
something like this
the important thing
for an engineer is inspiration
inspiration unlocks the future
technology will catch up
my wife and family
we italians are also poor
too many mouths to feed
hey settle down
the bottom will fall out
come
be careful this may be a dream
but you can still lose your head
which would you choose a world with
pyramids or one without them
pyramids
humanity dreams of flight
but the dream is cursed
aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction
i know
but still i chose a world
with pyramids in it
which world will you choose
i want to create beautiful airplanes
like that
very graceful
i have a long way to go
i dont even have the engine yet
bravo a beautiful dream
im retiring
this is my last design
artists are only creative
for ten years
we engineers are no different
live your ten years to the full
jiro we need to talk
ive got a meeting
cancel it
this is a tall order
theyre always tall
how long have you
been with us jiro
jiro
how long
five years
you should be ready then
we want you to lead the project
its the navys design competition
for 1932 a carrierbased fighter
a plum assignment
well jiro
what do you think
leave it to me
good
id like honjo on the team
bad idea
youd end up competing
friendships more important
relax and finish your coffee
check please
weve got other plans for honjo
damn these japanese engines
and damn this short flight deck
fresh uniforms
oh thanks
thanks for your help
those jerseys suit you
close the flight deck
stop
we did it
shes airborne
father
bravo nice catch
that was kind of you
are you all right
im fine here you are
thank you
it belongs to the hotel
well goodbye
father im afraid
i was rude to that man
dont worry
hes staying at our hotel
youll have a chance
to say thank you
what is it
nothing just that man
who caught the parasol
he seems to be here by himself
im sorry id better go
no please stay
i was giving thanks to the spring
i asked it
to bring you here to me
you havent changed at all
youre just like you were then
we were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake
i wanted to see you
again and thank you
oh now i remember
my name is nahoko satomi
jiro horikoshi
are you all right
im fine
kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt
she cried for joy
when we found you
you were our knight
in shining armor
your knight
you were like a knight on a
white horse that day
this umbrella sure does leak
its all right
ive got to tell kinu
she just had her second child
its such a cute baby
your painting is all wet
yes ill keep it this way
in honor of today
look its clearing up
the rain stopped here
oh look at that
id almost forgotten
what rainbows look like
life is wonderful isnt it
wed better go
fathers probably worried sick
theres my father
father
come ill introduce you
youre soaking wet
dont worry father im fine
mr horikoshi saved me again
jiro horikoshi
satomi im afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again
may i sit here
certainly
german tobacco last one too bad
i know how you feel
the same thing happened to me
you visit germany yes to dessau
you must be sherlock holmes
you are an engineer
you read german magazines
magazines about airplanes
all japanese engineers visit dessau
youre exactly right
dr junkers is in trouble
what kind of trouble
he fights the government
he will blow up
mr hitlers government
the nazis are a gang of hoodlums
this is a good place
no mosquitoes
not hot good watercress
a good place to forget bad things
cigarette im afraid theyre japanese
thank you
it is a nice night
hier ist der zauberberg
the magic mountain
by thomas mann
a good place for forgetting
make a war in china forget it
make a puppet state
in manchuria forget it
quit the league of nations forget it
make the world your enemy forget it
japan will blow up
germany will blow up too
will germany go to war again
yes they must be stopped
im sorry to keep you
waiting so long
nahoko has a fever
im afraid well have to
cancel our dinner plans
im sorry please tell her
i hope she feels better
i must go
the doctor will be here soon
who has seen the wind
neither i nor you
but when the leaves hang trembling
the wind is passing through
let the wind carry
these wings to you
jiro
nahoko
be careful
nice catch
bravo
is the young lady feeling better
yes shes much better
congratulations
this is the magic mountain
it cures everyone
i think youre right
at first this young man
was very gloomy
now he is very happy
he has fallen in love
thats true
summer love is soon forgotten
you will go down the mountain
you will forget what happened here
not me
this person youre talking about
wouldnt be my daughter would it
yes its nahoko
please give us your permission
but
father
i would like to accept
what a beauty
but first theres something
i have to tell you
yes
two years ago
my mother died of tuberculosis
i contracted it too
ive loved you since
that day you rescued my hat
ive loved you since the wind
brought you to me
please marry me
i will
but i want to get well first
can you wait for me
even if it takes
a hundred years
congratulations
he is a nice young man
your daughter is wonderful
this is a good summer
jiro over here
honjo
when did you get back
two days ago
hot isnt it
come take a look
shes beautiful
good clean lines
its a radical design
they gave me free rein
but we wont know
until she flies
shell fly
i feel the wind rising
youre the japanese achilles
youve closed the gap
my plane was just a tin duckling
i have an idea for you
i havent tried it yet
use flathead screws
on the access hatches
theyll reduce drag
maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side
a spring about this stiff
should be fine
thats a great idea
like columbus and his egg
you should use it
thanks but not this time
ill keep the plans
after you use it
ill use it too
okay
hurry up ill be waiting
jiro are you here
jiro its mr kurokawa
its an emergency
see you
visit the house next time
jiro you pedal
the special police
are looking for you
the thought crime boys
why me
i told them you were
away on business
pretending to leave
we wont fall for that
youd better work here
well bring your things
whats going on
why are they after me
they arrested some of my friends
none of them understood why
come in
heres your stuff
sorry for the bother
need anything else
just leave it and go
jiro its here
the prototype flange
it looks great
wish wed had it last year
jiro what do you think
our next plane will be
a fullgrown duck not a duckling
a full metal duck
how about it mr kurokawa
extruded aluminum alloy
very light what a luxury
all right back to work
the coast looks clear
okay jiro
better lie low for a few days
well smooth things over
ill put you up
let me stop by my apartment
im expecting a letter
is it something sensitive
yes very sensitive
the police will be opening your mail
its from my fiancée
such things shouldnt happen
in a modern country
youre engaged
jiros human after all
splendid
you think japans a modern country
its not funny
of course its not funny
the police are waiting for you
let them read your love letters
the navys next design
competition is in your hands
the company will protect you
that is as long as youre useful
just keep your mind on work
i miss you terribly
and mr castorp left so suddenly
why are they looking for him
i pray that he managed to
leave japan safely
jiro telephone for you
coming
the telephone is there
thank you
hello
jiro you have a telegram
what
your landlord brought it
it came two days ago
please read it
are you sure
nahoko has had
a lung hemorrhage
please come at once
satomi
hello are you there
i understand thank you
wait hold on
what is it
whats the fastest way
to get to tokyo
to tokyo
i have to be there
as soon as possible
let me see
if you take the noon bus
you can catch the express
ill send someone
to hold the bus for you
jiya
darling
i wish i couldve
come sooner
youll catch it
youre beautiful
i love you
jiro through the garden
come in
father jiro came to see me
but he has to leave right away
next time ill use the front door
use the garden its more fun
all right i will
take care darling
you too
goodbye
ill see you out
the last train
youd better hurry
is it that serious
i wish i could look after her
the way to do that is
to focus on your work
now youd better go
hes gone
are you crying dear
im going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended
but its so lonely
youll be all by yourself
i want to get better
i want a life with jiro
youre just in time
the board is waiting
so are you ready
ill do my best
now the navy
theyre the client
ill do my best
you werent even listening
right
so i gave up on that idea
everyones here rather late
jiros holding a design seminar
the next design uses
all the latest technology
take a look
retractable undercarriage
well need it for 270 knots
270 knots
thats 500 kilometers an hour
i thought the navy
requested 220 knots
were designing for the future
wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter
well minimize drag
and push the limits of technology
shell have split flaps
and leading edge slats
we can do it
when do we start
but then weight becomes a problem
if we leave out the guns
we should be okay
i decided to set
this idea aside for now
this is delightful
lucid and logical
almost had it
our engines are underpowered
to compensate we need
a light strong structure
well cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin
were going to build
an allmetal fighter
like nothing the worlds ever seen
i have a question
mr hirayama please
mr hirayama is our production engineer
thank you
hes going to tell us
about the new rivets
its technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets
whats he talking about
a way to cut drag
were going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets
question
i have a question
i must say that was interesting
it was inspiring
todays letter miss satomi
thank you
phone call chief
ill call back
i think its an emergency
hello mr satomi
what
jiro jiro
thank goodness
i worried i wouldnt find you
im here now can you walk
lets go
i just had to see you
i should go right back
dont go
we should be together
what a charming companion
my name is nahoko
so youre nahoko
jiro is that you
weve come to you
with a request
why not dear itll be fine
weve got plenty of room
but i can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together
well get married right away
mr kurokawa mrs kurokawa
please be our witnesses
here tonight
it sounds lovely dear
nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium
my fathers given his permission
ive already told the doctor
please help us
the bride and i have
preparations to make
come with me nahoko
dont worry hes always like that
if you care about her
youll send her back immediately
i cant do that
id have to give up my work
is that your heart
or your ego talking
we dont have much time
weve made our decision
i see
all right
well have a real ceremony
here they come
shes coming
hear me this lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved
shes given up everything
in the world for him what say you
hear me this man is
an insensitive simpleton
without a home
of his own
if thats uh okay with you
please come in
then they shall exchange
the marriage vows
you look beautiful
mr and mrs kurokawa
no words can express
our gratitude for your kindness
we will never forget our debt to you
come now were delighted that
jiros found such a wonderful partner
arent we dear
of course this is wonderful
youre both very courageous
you must be tired
i feel like im dreaming
the room is spinning
better get some rest
come here
but your condition
come
do you always
get home this late
kayo i completely forgot
youre so insensitive
congratulations on becoming a doctor
congratulations on your marriage
i came on behalf of the family
to thank the kurokawas
are they still up
theyve gone to bed
did you meet nahoko
yes
what are you going to do
shes alone in that room all day
her condition is
much worse than you think
im an intern
i know something about this
did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you wont worry
i really like nahoko
shes such a good person
how can you do this to her
does she really have to stay here
yes
each day is very precious to us now
get some rest
im glad you came to visit
im home
i was waiting
you should sleep
should you be up
kayo came today
were already best friends
shes like the sun
with such a bright future
she said next time
shell come as my doctor
and your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown
look theyre so warm
too bright
its all right
i have to finish
the design by tomorrow
for your mackerel bones
you remembered
i think it could
be a little lighter
come a little closer
give me your hand
i like to look at you
while you work
in a onehanded slide rule contest
id win first prize for sure
i think i can make each rib
half an ounce lighter
really thats good
thirty ribs makes about a pound
thats too much
half a pound is enough for two
i could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself
ill keep holding your hand
you should sleep
you wont let go
no i wont
i need a cigarette
can i let go for a minute
no smoke it here
its not good for you
i dont care
hey honjo
can i take a look
sure hows your bomber
coming along fine
this is avant garde
you went all the way
so this is flush riveting
feels pretty rough
were still learning the technique
youve left the germans behind
im still stuck with them
this design is you
right down to the mackerel bones
jiro let me use flush rivets too
and your springloaded hatches
sure why not
a redesign
yeah but theyre only letting me
modify the fuselage
and leave the wings alone
thats where the fuel tanks are
one hit and boom
to save weight were not even
shielding the fuel tanks
its japans first advanced bomber
the navys over the moon
shes got to fly 3000 kilometers
with a big payload
more horsepower alone wont be enough
who are they going to fight
china russia britain
the netherlands america
japan will blow up
were not arms merchants
we just want to build good aircraft
youre right
see you get some sleep
sure you too
im leaving now
good night
night
welcome home
its finished
now well see how she flies
congratulations
you worked so hard
shes on her way to the field
ill probably spend
a few nights there
you must be tired

im sure it will fly beautifully
yes shell fly
i couldnt have done it without you
i love you jiro
nahoko

why nahoko youre up
im feeling much better today
im going for a walk
just be careful
not to tire yourself
the rooms still a mess
ill straighten up when i get back
all right enjoy yourself
kayos coming today
that will be nice
yes ill be back soon
please come in
oh no
look she left letters
one of thems for me
shes going to the sanatorium
ill bring her back
no let her go
we shouldnt do anything
until her train leaves
she wants him
to remember her as she was
this is wonderful
just think thats one of ours
hows her speed
sorry the numbers are too high
were checking them again
how fast
240 knots
two forty
fantastic
what a fighter
hey jiro
jiro
she flies like a dream
thank you
we meet again japanese boy
mr caproni
this is where we first met
our kingdom of dreams
or the land of the dead
not quite in some ways yes
those ten years in the sun
did you live them to the full
yes things fell apart
toward the end though
thats what it means to lose a war
theres your zero fighter
beautiful a masterful design
not a single plane returned
there was nothing
to come back to
airplanes are beautiful dreams
cursed dreams
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up
someone is waiting for you
nahoko
shes been waiting here
for a long time
darling you must live
you must live
she is gone
she was beautiful like the wind
thank you
you must live
first shall we drop by my house
i have some excellent wine
a tribute to jiro horikoshi
and tatsuo hori
voices
hideaki anno miori takimoto
a white sloping path
runs up into the sky
a gently swaying misy haze
surrounding and holding
unnoticed by anyone all alone
soaring upwards
not afraid of anything
dancing up
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life a vapor trail
even before dying
from that window up high
watching the sky
now no one understands
no one would understand
all they could think was
too young
yet happy
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life a vapor trail
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life a vapor trail
