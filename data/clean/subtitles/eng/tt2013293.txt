big brother 
i want to pick bamboo grass 
you promised to go with me 
i ve got homework 
that s not homework 
it s an english magazine 
what a stupid moustache 
he s a famous italian aircraft designer 
his name is caproni 
it says he s a count 
  your face is scratched 
  leave it alone 
i better put some iodine on it 
would you be quiet 
big brother  what are you doing 
you re not allowed up here 
you re not wearing glasses 
focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight 
  mother will scold you 
  a shooting star 
there s another one 
they re pretty 
see  like that 
there s so many of them 
i m a japanese boy 
i think this is my dream 
this is my dream  you know 
it s mine too 
your dream 
listen  japanese boy 
you think we are sharing this dream 
it s strange 
you re count caproni  aren t you 
i m very glad to meet you 
interesting  yes  this is a dream 
this world is a dream 
welcome to my kingdom 
i m honored 
look at them 
they will bomb the enemy city 
most of them won t return 
but the war will soon be over 
climb up  japanese boy 
this is my dream 
when the war is over  i will build this 
magnificent  isn t she 
let s fly 
instead of bombs 
she ll carry passengers 
of course we can t climb up here   
but dreams are convenient 
one can go anywhere 
come  join me 
you can walk along the spar 
take a look 
  she s beautiful  no 
  yes  incredible 
she ll carry a hundred people
across the atlantic 
mr  caproni 
i have a question 
do you think i could
design airplanes 
i ll never be a pilot 
i m too nearsighted 
listen  japanese boy 
i m not a pilot 
i don t even know how to fly 
to fly airplanes is simple 
but i am a creator of airplanes 
an aeronautical engineer 
yes 
listen to me  japanese boy 
airplanes are not tools for war 
they are not for making money 
airplanes are beautiful dreams 
engineers turn dreams into reality 
yes 
arrivederci  we ll meet again 
jiro  you should go to bed 
you startled me 
i heard you talking to someone 
mother  i m going to be
an aeronautical engineer 
really  that s a wonderful dream 
airplanes are beautiful dreams 
that s what he told me 
i want to design beautiful airplanes 
you  there 
come  take my seat 
pardon me 
please 
the wind feels wonderful 
miss  you ll lose your hat 
don t worry  kinu 
watch out 
are you all right 
safe 
nice play 
thank you 
 le vent se lève  
 il faut tenter de vivre  
 le vent se lève 
il faut tenter de vivre  
 the wind is rising 
we must try to live  
earthquake 
the boiler s going to blow 
  what s wrong 
  her leg

it hurts 
kinu  be brave 
it s broken 
she can t walk like this 
miss  the boiler 
please save yourself

nothing s going to explode 
my suitcase

where do you live 
  in ueno 
  i ll get you there 
  fire 
  let s go 
  what about your luggage 
  it s not important 
i m so sorry 
hang on 
we d better hurry 
one of my shirts 
it s brand new 
you must be thirsty 
the well s almost dry 
what about you 
thank you 
the fire hasn t reached ueno 
i m heading for the university 
what about you 
i ll bring someone from home 
i ll go with you 
  look after this  kinu 
  i will 
we ll be back soon 
don t worry 
watch my suitcase 
  thank you 
  i ll leave her to you 
but what s your name 
that was some guy 
don t you think  kinu 
jiro  you picked a great day
to come back 
how bad is it  honjo 
the whole east side is burning 
that s everything we could carry 
got a smoke 
a flying door  that s just great 
they ll never stop the fire now 
tokyo s finished 
he really built it 
caproni has giant dreams 
stop the camera 
the wind s shifting 
it s coming this way 
is the wind still rising 
japanese boy 
yes  it s a gale 
then you must live 
 le vent se lève  
 ii faut tenter de vivre  
hey jiro  ready 
all the new buildings
are old fashioned 
the streets are wider 
even the airplanes haven t changed 
welcome 
mackerel again 
it s great 
every day s the same 
same lunch  same lectures 
can i get an egg 
the western powers
are building all metal aircraft 
try the pork sometime 
we re more than ten years behind 
what 
beautiful  isn t it 
look at that wonderful curve 
you eat mackerel
to look at the bones 
come on  finish up 
we re going for coffee 
jiro sure is working hard 
fish bones 
is mr  horikoshi back from lunch 
jiro 
honjo  listen to this 
the naca has a standard
curve just like this bone 
do americans eat mackerel too 
jiro  package for you 
a lady brought this for you  sir 
you were out 
so she left it with me 
i see  thank you 
present from your sweetheart 
got a smoke  gimme one 
  jiro 
  let him go 
  hello  mr  horikoshi 
  back from school 
your guest is waiting 
a young lady 
oh  right 
honestly  where were you 
kayo  i m sorry 
i completely forgot 
really 
  where s mother 
  at uncle s 
  is she staying there 
  just for one night 
you ve grown  kayo 
and gotten very pretty  too 
you re so mean 
you never ever come home 
oh  it s almost sunset already 
i ll tell them i kept you 
let s take the penny steamer 
she must really like you 
come on  it s been two years 
didn t you try to see her again 
of course 
i went back once 
the fire stopped at her street 
see  there s the dock 
are you cold 
i m fine  i never dreamed
tokyo would recover so quickly 
can i stay with you  jiro 
father won t let me
live here by myself 
i ll probably be in nagoya
by the time you come 
  with an airplane company 
  yes 
men have it so good 
i want to study medicine in tokyo 
a doctor  i think
you might be a good one 
i think so too 
i ll talk to father
next time i m home 
thanks  i m counting on you 
jiro 
there you are 
  you made it 
  finally 
  we re on our way 
  yes  we are 
they must ve been
heading for the city 
there were hundreds of them 
there s no work in the countryside 
another bank failure 
which one is it this time 
  are those the customers 
  looks like it 
there were rumors 
the economy s in the tank 
so is our new employer 
mitsubishi internal
combustion engine co 
we ve been waiting for you 
what took you so long 
i was told to come
anytime in april 
then you should ve come in march 
i ve got an assignment for you 
it s the design for the wing strut fitting 
i need it right away 
we re behind schedule already 
in here 
the data s ready 
this way 
this is your desk 
it s imported 
but no one likes it 
data here  hat goes there 
listen up  the falcon project
has a new engineer 
he s the genius we ve all
been hearing about 
introduce yourself 
jiro horikoshi 
now get to work 
jiro  come on 
it s lunchtime  let s go 
  the assembly plant 
  yes  i d like to take a look 
asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing 
two 
excuse me 
could we ask a favor 
look  it s really coming along 
sorry to bother you on your break 
not at all  you young engineers
should visit us more often 
honjo  the strut s already installed 
i knew it 
kurokawa s just hazing you 
is his fitting better than yours 
mr  kurokawa s always hard
on new employees 
honjo  get up here
and take a look 
i need your opinion 
  what do you think 
  looks strong enough 
this is no good 
it s just like my design 
then it must be bad 
foreman  lunch break s over 
quiet 
fascinating  aircraft are fascinating 
maybe they are  but we re late 
i m hattori 
mr  hattori is our chief engineer 
is this his first assignment 
the strut fitting for the falcon 
that s no fitting 
explain yourself  young man 
yes sir  this leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing 
the wire expands
and contracts automatically 
it runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage 
but we d have to
redesign the wing 
you re right 
i haven t done the calculations yet 
you re wasting your time 
where s the assignment i gave you 
it s finished 
that looks like
a very clean design to me 
it s perfect 
submit your work
as soon as you finish 
  i m heading out 
  me too 
what about kurokawa s homework 
just finishing up 
oxen 
they haul prototypes
to the airfield 
the latest aircraft  hauled by oxen 
that s how backward we are 
but they re wonderful creatures 
here she comes 
get ready 
approaching the mark 
damn it 
  did you get it 
  13 3 seconds  145 knots 
too slow 
we need ten more knots 
she s too low 
the engine s not performing 
kurokawa 
representatives from the army 
an audacious design 
  another coup for mitsubishi 
  your falcon is quite impressive 
power dive 
she s trying to break 200 
  parachute s open 
  go get him 
mr  kurokawa  we ll investigate
the cause when the weather clears 
  what about the pilot 
  he s okay 
that s good 
mr  kurokawa  let s go 
we ll build falcon two 
do you think the strut fitting failed 
no  i think the problem
is deeper and more complicated 
i ll never forget what i saw today 
it s like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes 
there won t be a falcon two 
the army has decided
to go with a competing design 
today was our last chance
to change their minds 
we re going to build a bomber
with help from junkers 
no more fighters for now 
this is your chance to see germany 
i ve already approved it 
  still open 
  ah  welcome back 
you re later than usual 
  two slices of the usual 
  coming up 
there you are 
isn t anyone looking after them 
their parents work late 
they wait there every night 
i feel bad closing the place up 
i see  well  thanks 
come again 
you must be hungry 
here s something to eat 
it s sponge cake 
i just bought it 
go ahead  take it 
come on 
you here  jiro 
too bad about the falcon 
i heard they axed it 
sponge cake  you have
some strange eating habits 
what did you expect 
did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you 
of course not 
well  maybe i did 
there are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood 
the cost of one fitting would feed
that kid s family for a month 
why is japan so poor 
jiro  do you know what we re paying
the germans for their technology 
enough to feed every kid in japan 
with sponge cake for dessert 
still  i plan to make the most
of this opportunity 
they re sending you too 
they told me today 
really  that s great news 
poor countries want airplanes 
so they pay us a lot
to design them  it s ironic 
i m leaving for tokyo tomorrow 
getting married 
married 
to work hard at the office 
you need a family at home 
more irony 
tight fisted germans 
they re hardly showing us anything 
i don t see any oxen 
the airstrip s
next to the plant 
everything s so big 
it s the g 38 
is this what we re buying 
for conversion to a bomber 
it s top secret 
who s the army planning
to bomb with this thing 
america  probably 
not that they could 
still  it s quite something 
amazing 
passengers can sit in the wings 
this would be wasted as a bomber 
who cares  we need
their all metal airframe technology 
you re kidding 
we can t go inside 
beautiful 
stop it 
take your hands off him 
is this how germans
treat their guests 
you japanese copy everything 
this technology belongs to germany 
oh  come on  japan has
lots of planes like this 
honjo  let it go 
we have a license
to your technology 
we signed an agreement 
we have the right to be here 
your bosses never said
we couldn t inspect this airplane 
i m sure you re only
trying to do your job   
but we won t tolerate this treatment 
the agreement is between equals 
our orders were not to let
you japanese wander around 
that s dr  junkers 
what an engineer 
you can go inside 
dr  junkers has agreed 
i m surprised we got a demonstration 
there s more vibration
than i expected 
our bosses are getting giddy 
let the army officers sit here 
just a moment 
this is truly a stupendous aircraft 
look  a corridor through the wing 
this is amazing 
it s like being inside a power plant 
guten tag 
dr  junkers gave us permission 
please show us your work station 
this is the flight engineer s station 
this aircraft is marvelous 
japanese  do not go further 
of course  my friend 
  this is incredible 
  yes  it s fantastic 
a triumph of
german industrial technology 
dr  junkers is my hero 
but his company is sneaky 
got a cigarette  jiro 
jiro 
a cigarette 
no  we re out 
it looks cold outside 
but this room is cozy 
i thought germans used fireplaces 
junkers makes radiators too 
this almost looks like that plane 
it s beautiful 
and our technology is primitive 
that s what you mean  right 
you think we ll never figure out
all metal construction on our own 
we can t learn anything from this 
these are just pretty equations 
 this technology belongs to germany  
maybe we don t even
need their technology 
wood and canvas
could be as good as metal 
then we ll never make it 
we re already 20 years behind 
let s take a walk 
my brain is boiling 
we re achilles  chasing a tortoise
with a twenty year lead 
if we close the gap
in five years   
he ll be five more years
down the road 
we ll always be chasing him 
someday we ll overtake him
and move ahead 
i wonder if we
can be the tortoise 
what 
listen to that 
schubert s  winter journey  
it s perfect for us 
  what was that about 
  we saw him in the hangar 
jiro 
i m done  go have a bath 
dead to the world   
with a face like he s carrying
the future of japanese aviation 
there s a telegram from headquarters 
  come in 
  not necessary 
some of us are returning immediately 
you re staying behind 
jiro will continue west
and return to japan 
  west 
  they want him to see the world 
all by himself 
mr  caproni 
is the wind still rising 
yes  it is 
then i invite you to join me
on my final flight  come 
you re retiring 
it s a big jump 
jump 
hurry  we re taking off 
there s a hatch under the fuselage 
hurry 
let me through 
up here 
  full power 
  fly  fly 
my workmen s families and relatives 
practically the whole village 
we re taking a private jaunt   
before we deliver this bomber
to the air force 
  what do you think 
  it s incredible 
it s like a building
out of ancient rome 
this plane is too large
to be used for war   
but the air force
likes everything big 
japan is poor and backward 
we could never build
something like this 
the important thing
for an engineer is inspiration 
inspiration unlocks the future 
technology will catch up 
my wife and family 
we italians are also poor 
too many mouths to feed 
hey  settle down 
the bottom will fall out 
come 
be careful  this may be a dream 
but you can still lose your head 
which would you choose  a world with
pyramids or one without them 
pyramids 
humanity dreams of flight 
but the dream is cursed 
aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction 
i know 
but still  i chose a world
with pyramids in it 
which world will you choose 
i want to create beautiful airplanes 
like that 
very graceful 
i have a long way to go 
i don t even have the engine yet 
bravo  a beautiful dream 
i m retiring 
this is my last design 
artists are only creative
for ten years 
we engineers are no different 
live your ten years to the full 
jiro  we need to talk 
  i ve got a meeting 
  cancel it 
  this is a tall order 
  they re always tall 
how long have you
been with us  jiro 
jiro 
  how long 
  five years 
you should be ready  then 
we want you to lead the project 
it s the navy s design competition
for 1932  a carrier based fighter 
a plum assignment 
well  jiro 
what do you think 
leave it to me 
good 
i d like honjo on the team 
bad idea 
you d end up competing 
friendship s more important 
relax and finish your coffee 
check  please 
we ve got other plans for honjo 
damn these japanese engines 
and damn this short flight deck 
fresh uniforms 
oh  thanks 
thanks for your help 
those jerseys suit you 
close the flight deck 
stop 
we did it 
she s airborne 
father 
bravo  nice catch 
that was kind of you 
are you all right 
i m fine  here you are 
thank you 
it belongs to the hotel 
well  goodbye 
father  i m afraid
i was rude to that man 
don t worry 
he s staying at our hotel 
you ll have a chance
to say thank you 
what is it 
nothing  just that man
who caught the parasol 
he seems to be here by himself 
i m sorry  i d better go 
no  please stay 
i was giving thanks to the spring 
i asked it
to bring you here  to me 
you haven t changed at all 
you re just like you were then 
we were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake 
i wanted to see you
again and thank you 
oh  now i remember 
my name is nahoko satomi 
jiro horikoshi 
are you all right 
i m fine 
kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt 
she cried for joy
when we found you 
you were our knight
in shining armor 
your knight 
you were like a knight on a
white horse that day 
this umbrella sure does leak 
it s all right 
i ve got to tell kinu 
she just had her second child 
it s such a cute baby 
your painting is all wet 
yes  i ll keep it this way
in honor of today 
look  it s clearing up 
the rain stopped here 
oh  look at that 
i d almost forgotten
what rainbows look like 
life is wonderful  isn t it 
we d better go 
father s probably worried sick 
there s my father 
father 
come  i ll introduce you 
you re soaking wet 
don t worry  father  i m fine 
mr  horikoshi saved me again 
jiro horikoshi 
satomi  i m afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again 
may i sit here 
certainly 
german tobacco  last one  too bad 
i know how you feel 
the same thing happened to me 
you visit germany  yes  to dessau 
you must be sherlock holmes 
you are an engineer 
you read german magazines 
magazines about airplanes 
all japanese engineers visit dessau 
you re exactly right 
  dr  junkers is in trouble 
  what kind of trouble 
he fights the government 
he will blow up 
mr  hitler s government 
the nazis are a gang of hoodlums 
this is a good place 
no mosquitoes 
not hot  good watercress 
a good place to forget bad things 
cigarette  i m afraid they re japanese 
thank you 
it is a nice night 
hier ist der zauberberg 
 the magic mountain 
by thomas mann 
a good place for forgetting 
make a war in china  forget it 
make a puppet state
in manchuria  forget it 
quit the league of nations  forget it 
make the world your enemy  forget it 
japan will blow up 
germany will blow up too 
  will germany go to war again 
  yes  they must be stopped 
i m sorry to keep you
waiting so long 
nahoko has a fever 
i m afraid we ll have to
cancel our dinner plans 
i m sorry  please tell her
i hope she feels better 
i must go 
the doctor will be here soon 
 who has seen the wind  
 neither i nor you  
 but when the leaves hang trembling 
the wind is passing through  
let the wind carry   
these wings to you 
jiro 
nahoko 
be careful 
nice catch 
bravo 
is the young lady feeling better 
yes  she s much better 
congratulations 
this is the magic mountain 
it cures everyone 
i think you re right 
at first  this young man
was very gloomy 
now he is very happy 
he has fallen in love 
that s true 
summer love is soon forgotten 
you will go down the mountain 
you will forget what happened here 
not me 
this person you re talking about
wouldn t be my daughter  would it 
yes  it s nahoko 
please give us your permission 
but   
father 
i would like to accept 
what a beauty 
but first  there s something
i have to tell you 
yes 
two years ago 
my mother died of tuberculosis 
i contracted it too 
i ve loved you since
that day you rescued my hat 
i ve loved you since the wind
brought you to me 
please marry me 
i will 
but i want to get well first 
can you wait for me 
even if it takes
a hundred years 
congratulations 
he is a nice young man 
your daughter is wonderful 
this is a good summer 
  jiro  over here 
  honjo 
  when did you get back 
  two days ago 
hot  isn t it 
come take a look 
she s beautiful 
good clean lines 
it s a radical design 
they gave me free rein 
but we won t know
until she flies 
she ll fly 
i feel the wind rising 
you re the japanese achilles 
you ve closed the gap 
my plane was just a tin duckling 
i have an idea for you 
i haven t tried it yet 
use flathead screws
on the access hatches 
they ll reduce drag 
maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side 
a spring about this stiff
should be fine 
that s a great idea 
like columbus and his egg 
you should use it 
thanks  but not this time 
i ll keep the plans 
after you use it 
i ll use it too 
okay 
hurry up  i ll be waiting 
jiro  are you here 
jiro  it s mr  kurokawa 
it s an emergency 
see you 
visit the house next time 
jiro  you pedal 
the special police
are looking for you 
the thought crime boys 
why me 
i told them you were
away on business 
pretending to leave 
we won t fall for that 
you d better work here 
we ll bring your things 
what s going on 
why are they after me 
they arrested some of my friends 
none of them understood why 
come in 
here s your stuff 
sorry for the bother 
need anything else 
  just leave it and go 
  jiro  it s here 
the prototype flange 
it looks great 
wish we d had it last year 
jiro  what do you think 
our next plane will be
a full grown duck  not a duckling 
a full metal duck 
how about it  mr  kurokawa 
extruded aluminum alloy 
very light  what a luxury 
all right  back to work 
  the coast looks clear 
  okay  jiro 
better lie low for a few days 
we ll smooth things over 
i ll put you up 
let me stop by my apartment 
i m expecting a letter 
is it something sensitive 
yes  very sensitive 
the police will be opening your mail 
it s from my fiancée 
such things shouldn t happen
in a modern country 
you re engaged 
  jiro s human after all 
  splendid 
you think japan s a modern country 
it s not funny 
of course it s not funny 
the police are waiting for you 
let them read your love letters 
the navy s next design
competition is in your hands 
the company will protect you 
that is  as long as you re useful 
just keep your mind on work 
i miss you terribly 
and  mr  castorp  left so suddenly 
why are they looking for him 
i pray that he managed to
leave japan safely 
jiro  telephone for you 
coming 
  the telephone is there 
  thank you 
  hello 
  jiro  you have a telegram 
what 
your landlord brought it 
it came two days ago 
please read it 
are you sure 
 nahoko    has had
a lung    hemorrhage  
 please come at once 
satomi 
hello  are you there 
i understand  thank you 
wait  hold on 
what is it 
what s the fastest way
to get to tokyo 
to tokyo 
i have to be there
as soon as possible 
let me see 
if you take the noon bus 
you can catch the express 
i ll send someone
to hold the bus for you 
jiya 
darling 
i wish i could ve
come sooner 
you ll catch it 
you re beautiful 
i love you 
jiro  through the garden 
come in 
father  jiro came to see me 
but he has to leave right away 
  next time i ll use the front door 
  use the garden  it s more fun 
all right  i will 
take care  darling 
you too 
goodbye 
i ll see you out 
the last train 
you d better hurry 
is it that serious 
i wish i could look after her 
the way to do that is
to focus on your work 
now you d better go 
he s gone 
are you crying  dear 
i m going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended 
but it s so lonely 
you ll be all by yourself 
i want to get better 
i want a life with jiro 
you re just in time 
the board is waiting 
so  are you ready 
i ll do my best 
now the navy 
they re the client 
i ll do my best 
  you weren t even listening 
  right 
so i gave up on that idea 
  everyone s here rather late 
  jiro s holding a design seminar 
the next design uses
all the latest technology 
  take a look 
  retractable undercarriage 
we ll need it for 270 knots 
270 knots 
that s 500 kilometers an hour 
i thought the navy
requested 220 knots 
we re designing for the future 
wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter 
we ll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology 
she ll have split flaps
and leading edge slats 
we can do it 
when do we start 
but then weight becomes a problem 
if we leave out the guns 
we should be okay 
i decided to set
this idea aside for now 
this is delightful 
lucid and logical 
almost had it 
our engines are underpowered 
to compensate  we need
a light  strong structure 
we ll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin 
we re going to build
an all metal fighter   
like nothing the world s ever seen 
i have a question 
mr  hirayama  please 
mr  hirayama is our production engineer 
thank you 
he s going to tell us
about the new rivets 
it s technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets 
what s he talking about 
a way to cut drag 
we re going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets 
  question 
  i have a question 
i must say  that was interesting 
it was inspiring 
today s letter  miss satomi 
thank you 
phone call  chief 
  i ll call back 
  i think it s an emergency 
hello  mr  satomi 
what  
jiro  jiro

  what a charming companion 
  my name is nahoko 
  so you re nahoko 
  jiro  is that you 
we ve come to you
with a request 
why not  dear  it ll be fine 
we ve got plenty of room   
but i can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together 
we ll get married right away 
mr  kurokawa  mrs  kurokawa 
please be our witnesses 
here  tonight 
it sounds lovely  dear 
nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium 
my father s given his permission 
i ve already told the doctor 
please help us 
the bride and i have
preparations to make 
come with me  nahoko 
don t worry  he s always like that 
if you care about her 
you ll send her back immediately 
i can t do that 
i d have to give up my work 
is that your heart
or your ego talking 
we don t have much time 
we ve made our decision 
i see 
all right 
we ll have a real ceremony 
here they come 
she s coming 
hear me  this lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved 
she s given up everything
in the world for him  what say you 
hear me  this man is
an insensitive simpleton   
without a home
of his own 
if that s    uh  okay with you 
please come in 
then they shall exchange
the marriage vows 
you look beautiful 
mr  and mrs  kurokawa 
no words can express
our gratitude for your kindness 
we will never forget our debt to you 
come now  we re delighted that
jiro s found such a wonderful partner 
aren t we  dear 
of course  this is wonderful 
you re both very courageous 
you must be tired 
i feel like i m dreaming 
the room is spinning 
better get some rest 
come here 
but your condition   
come 
do you always
get home this late 
kayo  i completely forgot 
you re so insensitive 
congratulations on becoming a doctor 
congratulations on your marriage 
i came on behalf of the family
to thank the kurokawas 
are they still up 
they ve gone to bed 
  did you meet nahoko 
  yes 
what are you going to do 
she s alone in that room all day 
her condition is
much worse than you think 
i m an intern 
i know something about this 
did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won t worry 
i really like nahoko 
she s such a good person 
how can you do this to her 
does she really have to stay here 
yes 
each day is very precious to us now 
get some rest 
i m glad you came to visit 
i m home 
  i was waiting 
  you should sleep 
  should you be up 
  kayo came today 
we re already best friends 
she s like the sun 
with such a bright future 
she said next time 
she ll come as my doctor 
and your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown 
look  they re so warm 
too bright 
it s all right 
i have to finish
the design by tomorrow 
for your mackerel bones 
you remembered 
i think it could
be a little lighter 
come a little closer 
give me your hand 
i like to look at you
while you work 
in a one handed slide rule contest 
i d win first prize for sure 
i think i can make each rib
half an ounce lighter 
really  that s good 
thirty ribs makes about a pound 
that s too much 
half a pound is enough for two 
i could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself 
i ll keep holding your hand 
you should sleep 
  you won t let go 
  no  i won t 
i need a cigarette 
can i let go for a minute 
no  smoke it here 
  it s not good for you 
  i don t care 
hey  honjo 
can i take a look 
  sure  how s your bomber 
  coming along fine 
this is avant garde 
you went all the way 
so this is flush riveting 
feels pretty rough 
we re still learning the technique 
you ve left the germans behind 
i m still stuck with them 
this design is you 
right down to the mackerel bones 
jiro  let me use flush rivets too 
and your spring loaded hatches 
sure  why not 
a redesign 
yeah  but they re only letting me
modify the fuselage 
and leave the wings alone 
that s where the fuel tanks are 
one hit  and boom 
to save weight  we re not even
shielding the fuel tanks 
it s japan s first advanced bomber 
the navy s over the moon 
she s got to fly 3 000 kilometers
with a big payload 
more horsepower alone won t be enough 
who are they going to fight 
china  russia  britain 
the netherlands  america 
japan will blow up 
we re not arms merchants 
we just want to build good aircraft 
you re right 
see you  get some sleep 
sure  you too 
i m leaving now 
good night 
night 
welcome home 
it s finished 
now we ll see how she flies 
congratulations 
you worked so hard 
she s on her way to the field 
i ll probably spend
a few nights there 
you must be tired 
a little 
i m sure it will fly beautifully 
yes  she ll fly 
i couldn t have done it without you 
i love you  jiro 
nahoko   
i m off 
good luck 
why  nahoko  you re up 
i m feeling much better today 
i m going for a walk 
just be careful
not to tire yourself 
the room s still a mess 
i ll straighten up when i get back 
all right  enjoy yourself 
kayo s coming today 
that will be nice 
yes  i ll be back soon 
please come in 
oh  no 
look  she left letters 
one of them s for me 
she s going to the sanatorium 
i ll bring her back 
no  let her go 
we shouldn t do anything
until her train leaves 
she wants him
to remember her as she was 
this is wonderful 
just think  that s one of ours 
how s her speed 
sorry  the numbers are too high 
we re checking them again 
how fast 
  240 knots 
  two forty 
  fantastic 
  what a fighter 
hey  jiro 
jiro 
she flies like a dream 
thank you 
we meet again  japanese boy 
mr  caproni   
this is where we first met 
our kingdom of dreams 
or the land of the dead 
not quite  in some ways  yes 
those ten years in the sun 
did you live them to the full 
yes  things fell apart
toward the end  though 
that s what it means to lose a war 
there s your zero fighter 
beautiful  a masterful design 
not a single plane returned 
there was nothing
to come back to 
airplanes are beautiful dreams 
cursed dreams   
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up 
someone is waiting for you 
nahoko   
she s been waiting here
for a long time 
darling  you must live 
you must live   
she is gone 
she was beautiful  like the wind 
thank you 
you must live 
first  shall we drop by my house 
i have some excellent wine 
a tribute to jiro horikoshi
and tatsuo hori
voices
hideaki anno miori takimoto
a white sloping path
runs up into the sky
a gently swaying  misy haze
surrounding and holding
unnoticed by anyone  all alone
soaring upwards
not afraid of anything
dancing up
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life  a vapor trail
even before dying
from that window  up high
watching the sky
now no one understands
no one would understand
all they could think was   
 too young 
yet    happy
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life  a vapor trail
longing to be in the sky
speeding through the sky
a whole life  a vapor trail
