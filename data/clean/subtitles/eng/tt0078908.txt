only weak people do that
i could look you in the eye
if i wanted to daddy
i just dont wanna look you in the eye
i guess youre just a weak person
you must have got that from your mother
it probably would have been better for you
to have been born a girl
then we could have named you michelle
you see weakness is more acceptable
in a girl michelle
im sorry i mean mike
i keep forgetting
wait a minute
why dont i call you michelle all the time
then i wouldnt have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses
i could think of you as a girl all the time
by your frocks dresses
and frilly hats and scarves
you could be daddys little girl
i wouldnt have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public would i
what do you think of that michelle
sound like a good idea
dont daddy
what
did you say something
such a soft little girls voice
i couldnt hear what you said
i hate you daddy
speak up girl
i hate you
i hate you because i love
it makes me feel
guilty inside hate
i cant let the heart speak
then dont speak
dont speak to me show me
dont tell me
im not interested in what little girls say
show me
show me your anger
then i can understand it
there you are daddy
i see you michelle
i see everything
this is me daddy
this is what you do to me inside
go all the way through it
go all the way through it to the end
come out the other end
dont stop in the middle
im watching you
im watching everything you do mike
wow
the man is a genius
dr raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon
i believe your bus is waiting outside now
thank you
candy
its me honey
daddy
okay honey
warm enough
okay put the whale down turn around
hold your hair up
oh my god
sorry hal
but mr carveth is still here
hes starting to get passionate
about the whole thing
okay send him in
mr carveth
thanks a lot
frank its been some time
what can i do for you
i want to see nola
i want to see my wife now
you know shes still undergoing
intensive therapy
i cant let you break that isolation
you let her see candice
on the weekends dont you
yes frank i do but thats different
visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start
her program has just changed
what do you mean
you sound hostile
my daughters been beaten severely
and scratched and bitten
her mother did it
her mother
who is under your psychiatric care
thats an incredibly heavy
accusation to make
did candice tell you that
candice wont talk about it
she pretends
the whole thing never happened
but it was nola
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here
either way no more weekends with mommy
the kid stays with me
to take candice away from her
at this stage
could send nola over into the deep end
its a critical time for her
i happen to think that nolas
been in over her head for a long time now
you have no legal right to deny access
any time youd like
to test the matter in open court
id be more than happy to oblige
for the ultimate good
of your own family frank
wed be prepared to do just that
but dont you force it
you bring candy back to her mother
next weekend she wont harm her
there must be some other answer
to what youve seen
until you give me that answer
candy is not coming back
yes hal
prepare nola carveth
for another session tonight will you
sure
and chris
make it phase two after supper
okay hal
this guy raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist
hes a legit md right
hes a real psychiatrist
yes
goddamn it psychoplasmics is a ripoff
its a sideshow ive seen it in action
it doesnt matter what you think
you listen to me
you call up this raglan
and you be a real mensch with him
otherwise its just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door
and you lose your kid for good
the law believes in motherhood
if i can dig up enough testimony to prove
that raglans a dangerous fraud
that somafree is crawling with crazies
its no place for a kid any time
youre getting warmer
but when candy doesnt show up
at somafree next weekend
your wife can take legal action immediately
you could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days
if i give nola enough time
shell really hurt the kid
i know she will
ill do anything i have to
heres your daddy
i bet he knows all about this zipper
there we go
all set now
id love to talk to you
sometime soon mr carveth
about school activities and candy
you missed the last open house
okay soon
thanks
see you tomorrow candy
thank you very much frank
for what
for bringing me my grandchild
i know if it were up to nola
id never see candice
juliana thats not true
nola and i both know how much
she needs her grandma especially now
youre sweet
i guess you know now what it feels like
what it feels like
being a parent
being blamed for everything
to have the past distorted so you
dont even recognize yourself anymore
your childs version of the past that is
juliana candice is only five
shes working on it right now believe me
thirty seconds after youre born
you have a past
and 60 seconds after that
you start to lie to yourself about it
i guess ive been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days
it must be the weather
at least now i have a partner in crime
ive got to go
of course
bye daddy
take your time well both be just fine
ill be with you in a second sweetie
im just gonna get a refill and then
well look at those lovely old pictures
mommy
yes candice
yes sweetie
mommy you hurt me
you hit me with your fists
and then you scratched me with your nails
you hurt me
i didnt sweetie
you must have had a bad dream
mommies dont do that
mommies dont hurt their own children
they dont
they never do
they sometimes do
sometimes but then theyre bad mommies
theyre fuckedup mommies
like whose
like whose mommy
like mine was
fucked up and bad
no im not nola
youre being so unfair sweetheart
mommies never do that
mommies never hurt their own children
you did hurt me
you beat me and you scratched me
you threw me down the stairs
show me what i did
dont stop it now darling show me
show me your anger show it to me
go all the way through it
go all the way through it till the end
right to the end
that ones my favorite
this ones your favorite
yes mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl
thats right i remember this picture
your grandpa barton took this picture
tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture
why was mommy in the hospital so much
some days she would wake up
and she would be covered
with big ugly bumps
and the doctors were very worried
because they could never find out
what those bumps all over her skin
really were
i guess i didnt stack the dishes too well
i better go see what the damage is
while im there
i think ill freshen up both our drinks
jerry
hi frank
youre really falling behind on this
the brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by may
were not going to make that for sure
maybe by june
i heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up
because of a change in the building code
mr carveth
telephone call for you
hello
is that mr carveth
yes
mr frank carveth
this is frank carveth
this is sgt martel with 78th division
one of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood
he found your motherinlaws body
in the kitchen
the murder weapon was on the floor
next to her
he then found your daughter upstairs
sound asleep in the bedroom
it seems she missed the whole thing
where is she now id like to see her
with our police psychologist dr birkin
psychologist why was she hysterical
no
on the contrary she was very cool
throughout the whole thing
a little too cool i thought
so i asked dr birkin to talk with her
just for an opinion
in the meantime can you think of
the names of any persons
who would have a motive
to murder this woman
you see it doesnt seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted breakin
or say a rapemurder
juliana had a long series of lovers
i never met any of them
what about her husband
his name is barton kelly
he works for the government out in halifax
they were divorced over 10 years ago
dr birkin
you must be candices father
id like to take her home now
please give me just two minutes with you
its important have a seat
to put it bluntly i dont think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed
you think she saw what happened
i suspect she did
or she saw something
which traumatized her confused her
disturbed her in some way
the officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up
to me that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep
which a lot of people
even children will use
to escape something
thats too painful to face
and she says that she doesnt remember
being brought to her grandmothers
or seeing her at all
do you think shell remember eventually
mr carveth i think you must
encourage her to remember
why
my concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown
if she doesnt come to terms
with what shes experienced
you see these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another
ive seen fiveyearolds like her
with ulcers as bad
as any middleaged businessman
okay i get the picture
now can i take her home
i think thats fine
no problem
youre sure you dont want a story
you dont have to read you know
i can make one up for you
do you want to tell me a story
about what happened today at grandmas
you go to sleep honey
ill leave the hall light on
damn
no outside calls youre in isolation
you know that
i tried to reach dr raglan he hasnt come
hes on his way
chris
is something wrong anything
then its me again
nothings wrong except with me
no thats frank talking
frank twisting my words
he wont be patient he wont trust me
he wont wait until i get well
he thinks
that im turning into my mother
day by day moment by moment
he thinks that im trying
to make candy into baby nola
is he right
no thats the last thing on earth id
whos that
its daddy
frank hates me daddy he despises me
he thinks im trying to harm my little girl
and i know that hes thinking of a way
to take her away
and thats very unfair of him
thats very arrogant of him
you mustnt be too hard on him
nola sweetheart
hes just trying to be a good
protective father
no
yes
hes just doing
what a good father should do
hes protecting his little girl
theres nothing wrong with that is there
he doesnt want to see her hurt
he doesnt want to see her hurt by anybody
not even her own mother
now is there anything wrong with that
no
no there isnt
after all its just what i did for you isnt it
franks protecting candy
the same way as i protected you isnt he
isnt he
no
what do you mean no
what do mean when you say no
i love you daddy
i dont want you to think
that i dont love you
i mean you didnt
didnt
didnt what
you didnt protect me
you didnt
you didnt and you should have
you shouldnt have looked away
when she hit me
and you shouldnt have walked away
from the table
when she twisted my words
you should have stopped her
you should have hit her when she hit me
and you should have smacked her
when she smacked me
oh god i love you
but you didnt protect me
and you should have
you pretended it wasnt happening
you looked away
and you should have
why didnt you
didnt you love me
look there he is
theres your grandfather
barton
hello frank how you doing
good to see you
let me take that
hello how you doing candy
i guess you dont remember
your old granddad
right this way
you didnt have to come way out here
we could have met later at the hotel
i just didnt like the idea
of you coming in alone
how long you plan to stay in town
i guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow
but julianas parents
might want to come in from arizona
then theres that sister in vancouver
i dont know just how its going to work out
all right what hotel are you staying in
park plaza
you know i was even thinking
about going out to that old house again
i still have the key after all these years
juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks
i could never understand why
maybe its because she really couldnt admit
that we were finished
when i think about you and nola
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through
its enough to make you cry
yes it is
im here to see mr jan hartog
come in right in
sit down ill be right there
sit down ill be there in a second
goddamn son of a bitch
okay
thats my
heart over there on the floor
your heart
my second heart
your first heart
makes your blood circulate right
but what about your lymphatic fluids
i dont know
movement walking and running fucking
rolling on the floor anything
people have this whole other system
they dont even know about
the lymphatic system
its like the blood system
with its own style of veins and arteries
but no heart
you have to keep moving
to get it to circulate
and theyve just given me pills
they do that every day
and ive got to move them
through the lymphatic system
goddamn it
pardon my sweat
im gonna take a bath real soon
so mr carveth
how did you get my name
my lawyer knows your lawyer
i see i get it
is your lawyer
preparing a case against raglan too
basically yes
slightly different from yours
how different
my wife is still in therapy with raglan
im claiming psychological damage
not physiological
i see give him some more time
with your wife
and youll be able to claim
physiological damage too
wouldnt this look impressive in court
do you like it i do
thats raglan thats psychoplasmics
and its called lymphosarcoma
and its spreading
its a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system
you blame raglan for that
raglan did it
raglan encouraged my body
to revolt against me
and it did
i have a small revolution on my hands
and im not putting it down
very successfully
then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove raglans responsible
are you kidding me
you cant prove something like that in court
right from square one
youre into what metaphysics
how do you know
im not going to get cancer at age 32
whether id gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not
no wed get laughed out of court
then why are you going into court
revenge
even if we lose people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics
it will be bad publicity
they wont even remember
whether we won or lost
theyll just remember the slogan
psychoplasmics can cause cancer
catchy
is that going to help
maybe
im not alone
im in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics
we might form a club
i want to help you
okay thanks
dr raglan
yes
im barton kelly nola carveths father
glad to meet you
im sorry to accost you like this
but your receptionist wasnt too helpful
she probably knew i was on my way to
did you know
that nolas mother died yesterday
that she was murdered
yes the police spoke to me
then youve told her
no i havent
thats why im here to tell her
mr kelly your wifes death
was a tragic and shocking thing
thats why nola must not be told
what
nolas going through a very critical stage
in her therapy
im not sure she could take it
are you saying that
im just supposed to bury the girls mother
and not tell her about it
yes thats what im saying
you are one ignorant son of a bitch
dr raglan
now i have left my phone number
on your front desk
if i dont hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon
im coming back up here to get her
shall i have him stopped
no its all right
hes drunk
hi sorry im late
you two look like youre having fun
we were
daddy ms mayer said she was starving
can we feed her at our place tonight
candy
we could if she wanted to
what do you think
well i
we could talk after candy goes to bed
sure
as soon as candy realized
she had me alone
she got me to play
mother and daughter with her
she obviously needs mothering
and isnt getting it
sometimes it just kills me to think
i might have screwed my kid up already
shes not even six
its not just you
sometimes when im being easy on myself
i say its not your fault
you got taken in
you got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity
hoping it would rub off
instead it started to work the other way
hello
its barton kelly frank
how are you
just mediocre
how are you
i made a mistake
i came back to the old place
its got me
im depressed as hell
barton get in a cab will you
just tell him to take
thats not all
theres nola too
how do you mean
i went up to that place to see her
they wouldnt even let me talk to her
they said no to me her own father
jesus
so im going back up there to somafree
well leave just as soon as you get here
soon as i get there
ill be waiting for you
i know youll want to go up there with me
youre not far from here are you
barton listen to me
i dont think thats a very smart thing to do
im doing it with or without you
okay
im only about 15 minutes away wait for me
ill be there
youre a good lad
well go up there together
and kick their ass
im waiting on you
ive a feeling
ive just been recruited to babysit
would you itd take 45 minutes
hes drunk
hell drive his car off a bridge
unless i talk some sense into him
45 minutes
thats all itll take
okay
thanks
help yourself to some coffee
here
look at this while im gone
if you like it ill give it to you
45 minutes
i shouldnt have
i never planned it to be this way
nola
barton
its me
i cant get over it
the thing was in the house
it was in the house all the time
we searched the place
but we werent looking
for anything that small and we missed it
we were spending our time
checking out an estonian musician
have you found out who it belongs to
the kid
no my guess is
some crazy woman didnt want
anyone to know she had a deformed child
shes locked this kid up in an attic
for years and never told anybody
wouldnt be the first time
hello
whos this
ruth mayer
did you want to speak with frank carveth
ruth mayer from krell street school
yes
is this mrs carveth
are you and my husband
having your own private pta meeting
i wont even bother to answer that
you bitch
youre killing my family
our friend has very strange eyes
they have irises but no retinas
i should think his vision of the world
is very distorted
im pretty certain he sees things
only in blackandwhite
no colors
the upper lip is cleft
real harelip
but the palate is not
and the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech
it has no teeth
but you can get a pretty nasty bite
from these strange beaklike gums
why did it die
i found some sort of collapsed fleshy sac
between the little fellows shoulder blades
it contains traces
of a solid nutrient material
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish
or a camels hump
basically its a gas tank
that was full at birth
once the hump material
is completely assimilated
i think the creature simply starves to death
runs out of gas so to speak
and that brings us
to the last point of interest
theres an external deformity
i mean apart from the lack of sexual organs
its extremely subtle
and extremely provocative
i wonder if either of you have noticed it
has no navel
no what
no bellybutton
the thing has no bellybutton
thats right
and that means this creature
has never really been born
at least not the way
human beings are born
jesus
youre the beginning of the end ms mayer
the beginning of the end for me
my family my dream
so sad
and i feel so guilty for my part in it
i wish it had never happened
i wish we could be together again
just the three of us
youre kidding yourself
right now youre dreaming
from what frank tells me
it was lousy from the very start
you never had anything real together
it would be better for everybody if you
if frank divorced you and married me
wed still let you see candy
in the weekends
that stinks
we had a lot
we had beautiful things
things that you couldnt understand
and well have them again
if youd just leave him alone
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his ioneliness
then hed wait for me
hed help me to get better
instead of abandoning me
he would do that
if you would just leave him alone
leave him alone
listen im sorry i called a few times
you didnt answer
i didnt want to talk to your wife again
thats why once was enough
nola called what did she say
look i have to go
your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now
ill see you at the next open house
daddy
whats the matter sweetheart
why arent you sleeping
i had a bad dream a scary bad dream
what was the dream about honey
im afraid to tell you
why
the dream doesnt want me to
candy listen to me
i know what happened at grandmas
i know what you saw there
i just came from the police
and when i was there
i saw the thing that hurt grandma
and candy its dead
i saw it lying on a table
and the police were there and its dead
it cant hurt you now
and it cant hurt me or anybody else
do you understand me
its dead
yes
its all right now baby
what do you think
how many people do we have
at the main house
twentyseven
okay i want them out by this afternoon
and the house closed
itll be hard on them hal especially mike
then do it gently
but get them out
all right
put your suitcases in the compartment
i dont want to go
you have to go
come on i just want you to get on the bus
youll see the doctor
i dont want to go
dont make me leave
im not making you leave
just be a good boy
and get on the bus all right
hi jan
frank hi
look i think weve got ourselves
a real live one
come on upstairs
theres somebody i want you to meet
is this the guy from chicago
no hes a local boy
he lives a lot closer to home
than you expected
mr carveth is here to see you
look whos here
nolas old man
the queen bees favorite drone
jeez hes pretty far gone
hed be dynamite in court
what did you mean when you said
nolas the queen bee
shes the queen bee all right
shes the star
shes the one hes interested in
and the rest of us dont count anymore
she doesnt even have to pay for it
thats because shes the one
who was born to prove
that psychoplasmics
is the ultimate therapeutic device
thats the quote isnt it
can you be my daddy
he wont do it anymore
and my real daddy wont do it
and that bastard dr raglan
wont do it anymore
you see my real daddy rejected me
and my surrogate daddy rejected me
thats just fucking wonderful
dont you think
calm down mike cool it
and tell him what happened at somafree
look
ill make a deal with you okay
just be my daddy
please ill tell you anything
you want to know
ill bleed for you want me to bleed
no
thats silly right
repulses you i can see that
youre not into it so why do it right
besides nobody could do it like dr raglan
not even real daddy
and he knows it
dr raglan knows im addicted to him
and he doesnt care
hes such a hard man
i was at that demonstration last monday
you and raglan seemed very close
what happened
he threw us out all of us
locked the door
its true
ive been in touch with some of the others
theyve all been thrown out of somafree
and all therapy suspended
all except for your wife shes still there
doesnt anybody know why
sure somebody knows i know
he wants to be alone with her
dr raglan wants to be alone with your wife
bye daddy
bye
hi frank
hi wendy
quickly but quietly children
rebecca do you want to pass out
the blue papers please
and clayton how about you pass out
the purple ones
okay lets see
this person here
you can do snowflakes too
thats a good idea
help
whats the matter
theyre hurting ms mayer
the bad kids are hurting ms mayer
they knocked her to the floor
and theyre hitting her
theyre hitting ms mayer
they made her fall down
candy
its all right its hal
wheres chris chris usually wakes me up
chris had to go into the city
youve been dreaming
yes i was having a wonderful dream
wonderful
and painful at the same time
my daughter was coming back to me
and frank
and ruth mayer
was she in your dream
candys teacher
i dont remember
then maybe we should talk about her
but i dont feel the need to talk about her
you dont
why not
i dont know
i think i must be getting stronger
because somehow
i just dont feel threatened by her anymore
this is where my wife and kid lived
for nine months
before nola moved out to somafree
this is the first time ive seen the place
what are we doing here
tell me again
i dont know
i thought candy might come back here
its not a coincidence
those things those creatures
they all disappeared together
theyve got her
youve got to help me
somebodys following me
somebodys always following me
did you find out anything
did you find out why they moved you out
ive got to have something to eat anything
what did you find out
why did they close somafree down
talk to me now
okay
raglans onto something very big
something to do with the kids
he just got bored with the rest of us
kids what kids
the disturbed kids in the work shed
the ones your wifes taking care of
what have you done with my kid
where is she
carveth what the hell
are you talking about
they took her
they killed ruth mayer
and then they brought candice back here
they killed ruth mayer
i want my daughter back now
did they bring her back here back to nola
i dont know
if they brought her back here
then shed be up there in the attic
thats where they live
frank ive got a gun
theyll kill you
if you try to take her away from them
why
because they understand
that shes one of them
youre insane
frank they exist youve seen them
theyre just freaks deformed children
youve got nola taking care of them
im sure she loves being
their surrogate mother
shes not their surrogate mother
shes their real mother
their only mother
im not gonna listen
theyre her children
more exactly
theyre the children of her rage
theyre motivated only by her anger
whether that anger
is conscious or subconscious
i mean when nola got cross with candy
last weekend
annoyed really
the brood beat her
but when she released her rage
against her parents under therapy
then they killed them
i know i didnt want to believe that
but now theyve killed ruth mayer
and they could kill you or me
and she wouldnt even be aware of it
i mean she doesnt even know
that candys here
i want candice back
then do it my way
please
its the right way
what do you want me to do
i want you to go back into that hut
and persuade nola that you want her back
that you want your family back
i want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband
why
because if you can keep nola
calm and happy
then the broods neutral
if shes mellow
then i can just walk into that attic
pick up candy
tuck her under my arm and walk out
now can you do that
i dont know
frank if things go wrong
if nola gets angry if the kids get angry
you understand
im not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger
raglan i dont trust you
what does it matter
ill move up there 30 seconds after youre in
frank be nice to her
hal
its me nola its frank
am i dreaming
i thought you said you werent going to
come and see me while i was here
i think that was a misunderstanding
thats why im here
i want us to understand each other
youre the only woman in the world for me
you always have been you always will be
it wont ever change
i want you to know that
i wish it were true god i wish it were true
we lost touch
thats the only reason
all this ever happened
all we have to do
is make sure we dont lose touch again
isolation is part of my therapy
whats been happening to me
has been just too strange
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life
then make me a part of your new life
let me be part of it
show me educate me involve me
im ready now
i wasnt before but im ready now
candy
are you ready for me frank
are you really
i seem to be a very special person
im in the middle of a strange adventure
let me be with you
i want to go with you wherever you go
do you
do you
yes
then look
daddy
is it time to go to school yet
no sweetheart
its dr hal
and daddys downstairs talking to mommy
he wants to see you
oh god nola

and give her to somebody else
i wouldnt do that
i wouldnt do that to you

youre lying i know
i know you so well and it wont work
id kill candice
before i let you take her away from me
