only weak people do that 
i could look you in the eye
if i wanted to  daddy 
i just don t wanna look you in the eye 
i guess you re just a weak person 
you must have got that from your mother 
it probably would have been better for you   
to have been born a girl 
then we could have named you michelle 
you see  weakness is more acceptable
in a girl  michelle 
i m sorry  i mean  mike 
i keep forgetting 
wait a minute 
why don t i call you michelle all the time 
then i wouldn t have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses 
i could think of you as a girl all the time   
by your frocks  dresses 
and frilly hats and scarves 
you could be daddy s little girl 
i wouldn t have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public  would i 
what do you think of that  michelle 
sound like a good idea 
don t  daddy 
what 
did you say something 
such a soft little girl s voice 
i couldn t hear what you said 
i hate you  daddy 
  speak up  girl 
  i hate you 
i hate you  because i love   
it makes me feel   
guilty inside  hate 
i can t let the heart speak 
then don t speak 
don t speak to me  show me 
don t tell me 
i m not interested in what little girls say 
show me 
show me your anger 
then i can understand it 
there you are  daddy 
i see you  michelle 
i see everything 
this is me  daddy 
this is what you do to me inside 
go all the way through it 
go all the way through it to the end 
come out the other end 
don t stop in the middle 
i m watching you 
i m watching everything you do  mike 
wow 
the man is a genius 
dr  raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon 
i believe your bus is waiting outside now 
thank you 
candy   
it s me  honey 
daddy 
okay  honey 
warm enough 
okay  put the whale down  turn around 
hold your hair up 
oh  my god 
sorry  hal   
but mr  carveth is still here 
he s starting to get passionate
about the whole thing 
okay  send him in 
mr  carveth 
thanks a lot 
frank  it s been some time 
what can i do for you 
i want to see nola 
i want to see my wife  now 
you know she s still undergoing
intensive therapy 
i can t let you break that isolation 
you let her see candice
on the weekends  don t you 
yes  frank  i do  but that s different 
visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start 
her program has just changed 
what do you mean 
you sound hostile 
my daughter s been beaten severely   
and scratched and bitten 
her mother did it   
her mother 
who is under your psychiatric care 
that s an incredibly heavy
accusation to make 
did candice tell you that 
candice won t talk about it 
she pretends
the whole thing never happened 
but it was nola   
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here 
either way  no more weekends with mommy 
the kid stays with me 
to take candice away from her
at this stage   
could send nola over into the deep end 
it s a critical time for her 
i happen to think that nola s
been in over her head for a long time now 
you have no legal right to deny access 
any time you d like
to test the matter in open court   
i d be more than happy to oblige 
for the ultimate good
of your own family  frank   
we d be prepared to do just that 
but don t you force it 
you bring candy back to her mother
next weekend  she won t harm her 
there must be some other answer
to what you ve seen 
until you give me that answer   
candy is not coming back 
yes  hal 
prepare nola carveth
for another session tonight  will you 
sure 
and  chris   
make it phase two  after supper 
okay  hal 
this guy raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist 
he s a legit m d   right 
he s a real psychiatrist 
yes 
goddamn it  psychoplasmics is a rip off 
it s a sideshow  i ve seen it in action 
it doesn t matter what you think 
you listen to me 
you call up this raglan 
and you be a real mensch with him 
otherwise  it s just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door   
and you lose your kid for good 
the law believes in motherhood 
if i can dig up enough testimony to prove   
that raglan s a dangerous fraud 
that somafree is crawling with crazies   
it s no place for a kid  any time   
you re getting warmer 
but when candy doesn t show up
at somafree next weekend   
your wife can take legal action immediately 
you could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days 
if i give nola enough time 
she ll really hurt the kid 
i know she will 
i ll do anything i have to 
here s your daddy 
i bet he knows all about this zipper 
there we go 
all set  now 
i d love to talk to you
sometime soon  mr  carveth   
about school activities and candy 
you missed the last open house 
okay  soon 
thanks 
see you tomorrow  candy 
thank you very much  frank 
  for what 
  for bringing me my grandchild 
i know if it were up to nola 
i d never see candice 
juliana  that s not true 
nola and i both know how much
she needs her grandma  especially now 
you re sweet 
i guess you know  now  what it feels like 
  what it feels like 
  being a parent 
being blamed for everything 
to have the past distorted  so you
don t even recognize yourself anymore 
your child s version of the past  that is 
juliana  candice is only five 
she s working on it right now  believe me 
thirty seconds after you re born 
you have a past 
and 60 seconds after that 
you start to lie to yourself about it 
i guess i ve been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days 
it must be the weather 
at least now i have a partner in crime 
  i ve got to go 
  of course 
 bye  daddy 
take your time  we ll both be just fine 
i ll be with you in a second  sweetie 
i m just gonna get a refill  and then
we ll look at those lovely old pictures 
mommy 
yes  candice 
yes  sweetie 
mommy  you hurt me 
you hit me with your fists 
and then you scratched me with your nails 
you hurt me 
i didn t  sweetie 
you must have had a bad dream 
mommies don t do that 
mommies don t hurt their own children 
they don t 
they never do 
they sometimes do 
sometimes  but then they re bad mommies 
they re fucked up mommies 
like whose 
like whose mommy 
like mine was 
fucked up and bad 
no  i m not  nola 
you re being so unfair  sweetheart 
mommies never do that 
mommies never hurt their own children 
you did hurt me 
you beat me and you scratched me 
you threw me down the stairs 
show me what i did 
don t stop it now  darling  show me 
show me your anger  show it to me 
go all the way through it 
go all the way through it  till the end 
right to the end 
that one s my favorite 
this one s your favorite 
yes  mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl 
that s right  i remember this picture 
your grandpa barton took this picture 
tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture 
why was mommy in the hospital so much 
some days  she would wake up
and she would be covered   
with big  ugly bumps 
and the doctors were very worried 
because they could never find out   
what those bumps all over her skin
really were 
i guess i didn t stack the dishes too well 
i better go see what the damage is 
while i m there 
i think i ll freshen up both our drinks 
jerry 
hi  frank 
you re really falling behind on this 
the brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by may 
we re not going to make that  for sure 
maybe by june 
i heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up   
because of a change in the building code 
mr  carveth 
telephone call for you 
  hello 
  is that mr  carveth 
  yes 
  mr  frank carveth 
  this is frank carveth 
  this is sgt  martel  with 78th division 
one of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window   
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood 
he found your mother in law s body
in the kitchen 
the murder weapon was on the floor 
next to her 
he then found your daughter upstairs 
sound asleep in the bedroom 
it seems she missed the whole thing 
  where is she now  i d like to see her 
  with our police psychologist  dr  birkin 
  psychologist  why  was she hysterical 
  no 
on the contrary  she was very cool
throughout the whole thing 
a little too cool  i thought 
so i asked dr  birkin to talk with her 
just for an opinion 
in the meantime  can you think of
the names of any persons   
who would have a motive
to murder this woman 
you see  it doesn t seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break in   
or  say  a rape murder 
juliana had a long series of lovers 
i never met any of them 
what about her husband 
his name is barton kelly 
he works for the government  out in halifax 
they were divorced over 10 years ago 
  dr  birkin 
  you must be candice s father 
i d like to take her home now 
please  give me just two minutes with you 
it s important  have a seat 
to put it bluntly  i don t think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed 
  you think she saw what happened 
  i suspect she did 
or she saw something
which traumatized her  confused her   
disturbed her in some way 
the officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up 
to me  that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep   
which a lot of people 
even children  will use   
to escape something
that s too painful to face 
and she says that she doesn t remember
being brought to her grandmother s   
or seeing her at all 
do you think she ll remember  eventually 
mr  carveth  i think you must
encourage her to remember 
why 
my concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown   
if she doesn t come to terms
with what she s experienced 
you see  these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another 
i ve seen five year olds like her   
with ulcers as bad
as any middle aged businessman 
okay  i get the picture 
  now can i take her home 
  i think that s fine 
no problem 
you re sure you don t want a story 
you don t have to read  you know 
i can make one up for you 
do you want to tell me a story   
about what happened today at grandma s 
you go to sleep  honey 
i ll leave the hall light on 
damn 
no outside calls  you re in isolation 
you know that 
i tried to reach dr  raglan  he hasn t come 
he s on his way 
chris   
is something wrong  anything 
then it s me again 
nothing s wrong  except with me 
no  that s frank talking 
frank twisting my words 
he won t be patient  he won t trust me 
he won t wait until i get well 
he thinks   
that i m turning into my mother 
day by day  moment by moment 
he thinks that i m trying   
to make candy into baby nola 
is he right 
no  that s the last thing on earth i d   
who s that 
it s daddy 
frank hates me  daddy  he despises me 
he thinks i m trying to harm my little girl   
and i know that he s thinking of a way
to take her away 
and that s very unfair of him 
that s very arrogant of him 
you mustn t be too hard on him 
nola  sweetheart 
he s just trying to be a good 
protective father 
no 
yes 
he s just doing
what a good father should do 
he s protecting his little girl 
there s nothing wrong with that  is there 
he doesn t want to see her hurt 
he doesn t want to see her hurt by anybody 
not even her own mother 
now  is there anything wrong with that 
no 
no  there isn t 
after all  it s just what i did for you  isn t it 
frank s protecting candy
the same way as i protected you  isn t he 
isn t he 
no 
what do you mean   no  
  what do mean when you say  no  
  i love you  daddy 
i don t want you to think
that i don t love you 
i mean  you didn t 
 didn t  
 didn t  what 
you didn t protect me 
you didn t 
you didn t  and you should have 
you shouldn t have looked away
when she hit me 
and you shouldn t have walked away
from the table   
when she twisted my words 
you should have stopped her 
you should have hit her when she hit me 
and you should have smacked her
when she smacked me 
oh  god  i love you 
but you didn t protect me 
and you should have 
you pretended it wasn t happening 
you looked away 
and you should have 
why didn t you 
didn t you love me 
look  there he is 
there s your grandfather 
barton 
hello  frank  how you doing 
good to see you 
  let me take that 
  hello  how you doing  candy 
i guess you don t remember
your old granddad 
right this way 
you didn t have to come way out here 
we could have met later  at the hotel 
i just didn t like the idea
of you coming in alone 
how long you plan to stay in town 
i guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow   
but juliana s parents
might want to come in from arizona 
then there s that sister in vancouver 
i don t know just how it s going to work out 
  all right  what hotel are you staying in 
  park plaza 
you know  i was even thinking
about going out to that old house again 
i still have the key  after all these years 
juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks 
i could never understand why 
maybe it s because she really couldn t admit
that we were finished 
when i think about you and nola   
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through   
it s enough to make you cry 
yes  it is 
i m here to see mr  jan hartog 
come in  right in 
sit down  i ll be right there 
sit down  i ll be there in a second 
goddamn son of a bitch 
okay 
that s my   
heart  over there on the floor 
  your heart 
  my second heart 
your first heart
makes your blood circulate  right 
but what about your lymphatic fluids 
i don t know 
movement  walking and running  fucking 
rolling on the floor  anything 
people have this whole other system
they don t even know about 
the lymphatic system 
it s like the blood system   
with its own style of veins and arteries   
but no heart 
you have to keep moving
to get it to circulate 
and they ve just given me pills 
they do that every day 
and i ve got to move them
through the lymphatic system 
goddamn it 
pardon my sweat 
i m gonna take a bath  real soon 
so  mr  carveth   
how did you get my name 
my lawyer knows your lawyer 
i see  i get it 
is your lawyer
preparing a case against raglan  too 
basically  yes 
  slightly different from yours 
  how different 
my wife is still in therapy with raglan 
i m claiming psychological damage 
not physiological 
i see  give him some more time
with your wife   
and you ll be able to claim
physiological damage  too 
wouldn t this look impressive in court 
do you like it  i do 
that s raglan  that s psychoplasmics   
and it s called lymphosarcoma 
and it s spreading 
it s a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system 
you blame raglan for that 
raglan did it 
raglan encouraged my body   
to revolt against me 
and it did 
i have a small revolution on my hands   
and i m not putting it down
very successfully 
then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove raglan s responsible 
are you kidding me 
you can t prove something like that in court 
right from square one 
you re into  what  metaphysics 
how do you know
i m not going to get cancer at age 32   
whether i d gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not 
no  we d get laughed out of court 
then why are you going into court 
revenge 
even if we lose  people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics 
it will be bad publicity 
they won t even remember
whether we won or lost 
they ll just remember the slogan 
 psychoplasmics can cause cancer  
catchy 
is that going to help 
maybe 
i m not alone 
i m in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics 
we might form a club 
i want to help you 
okay  thanks 
dr  raglan 
yes 
i m barton kelly  nola carveth s father 
glad to meet you 
i m sorry to accost you like this   
but your receptionist wasn t too helpful 
she probably knew i was on my way to   
did you know
that nola s mother died yesterday 
that she was murdered 
yes  the police spoke to me 
  then you ve told her 
  no  i haven t 
that s why i m here  to tell her 
mr  kelly  your wife s death
was a tragic and shocking thing 
that s why nola must not be told 
what 
nola s going through a very critical stage
in her therapy 
i m not sure she could take it 
are you saying that
i m just supposed to bury the girl s mother   
and not tell her about it 
yes  that s what i m saying 
you are one ignorant son of a bitch 
dr  raglan 
now  i have left my phone number   
on your front desk 
if i don t hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon   
i m coming back up here to get her 
shall i have him stopped 
no  it s all right 
he s drunk 
hi  sorry i m late 
  you two look like you re having fun 
  we were 
daddy  ms  mayer said she was starving 
can we feed her at our place tonight 
candy   
we could if she wanted to 
what do you think 
well  i   
we could talk after candy goes to bed 
sure 
as soon as candy realized
she had me alone   
she got me to play
 mother and daughter  with her 
she obviously needs mothering 
and isn t getting it 
sometimes it just kills me to think
i might have screwed my kid up already 
she s not even six 
it s not just you 
sometimes when i m being easy on myself 
i say   it s not your fault 
 you got taken in 
 you got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity   
 hoping it would rub off  
instead  it started to work the other way 
hello 
it s barton kelly  frank 
how are you 
just mediocre 
how are you 
i made a mistake 
i came back to the old place 
it s got me 
i m depressed as hell 
barton  get in a cab  will you 
  just tell him to take   
  that s not all 
there s nola  too 
how do you mean 
i went up to that place to see her 
they wouldn t even let me talk to her 
they said no to me  her own father 
jesus 
so i m going back up there  to somafree 
we ll leave just as soon as you get here 
soon as i get there 
i ll be waiting for you 
i know you ll want to go up there with me 
  you re not far from here  are you 
  barton  listen to me 
i don t think that s a very smart thing to do 
i m doing it  with or without you 
okay 
i m only about 15 minutes away  wait for me 
i ll be there 
you re a good lad 
we ll go up there together 
and kick their ass 
i m waiting on you 
i ve a feeling
i ve just been recruited to baby sit 
would you  it d take 45 minutes 
he s drunk 
he ll drive his car off a bridge 
unless i talk some sense into him 
45 minutes 
that s all it ll take 
okay 
thanks 
help yourself to some coffee 
here 
look at this while i m gone 
if you like it  i ll give it to you 
45 minutes 
i shouldn t have   
i never planned it to be this way 
nola 
barton 
it s me 
i can t get over it 
the thing was in the house 
it was in the house all the time 
we searched the place   
but we weren t looking
for anything that small  and we missed it 
we were spending our time
checking out an estonian musician 
have you found out who it belongs to 
the kid 
no  my guess is   
some crazy woman didn t want
anyone to know she had a deformed child 
she s locked this kid up in an attic
for years and never told anybody 
wouldn t be the first time 
hello 
who s this 
ruth mayer 
did you want to speak with frank carveth 
ruth mayer  from krell street school 
yes 
is this mrs  carveth 
are you and my husband
having your own private pta meeting 
i won t even bother to answer that 
you bitch 
you re killing my family 
our friend has very strange eyes 
they have irises  but no retinas 
i should think his vision of the world
is very distorted 
i m pretty certain he sees things
only in black and white 
no colors 
the upper lip is cleft 
real harelip   
but the palate is not 
and the tongue is too thick and inflexible
for proper speech 
it has no teeth   
but you can get a pretty nasty bite   
from these strange  beak like gums 
why did it die 
i found some sort of collapsed  fleshy sac   
between the little fellow s shoulder blades 
it contains traces
of a solid nutrient material   
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish   
or a camel s hump 
basically  it s a gas tank
that was full at birth 
once the hump material
is completely assimilated   
i think the creature simply starves to death 
runs out of gas  so to speak 
and that brings us
to the last point of interest 
there s an external deformity 
i mean  apart from the lack of sexual organs 
it s extremely subtle
and extremely provocative 
i wonder if either of you have noticed it 
  has no navel 
  no what 
no bellybutton 
  the thing has no bellybutton 
  that s right 
and that means this creature
has never really been born 
at least  not the way
human beings are born 
jesus 
you re the beginning of the end  ms  mayer 
the beginning of the end for me 
my family  my dream 
so sad 
and i feel so guilty for my part in it 
i wish it had never happened 
i wish we could be together again 
just the three of us 
you re kidding yourself 
right now  you re dreaming 
from what frank tells me 
it was lousy from the very start 
you never had anything real together 
it would be better for everybody if you   
if frank divorced you and married me 
we d still let you see candy
in the weekends 
that stinks 
we had a lot 
we had beautiful things 
things that you couldn t understand 
and we ll have them again 
if you d just leave him alone   
and stop poisoning him against me
and taking advantage of his ioneliness 
then he d wait for me 
he d help me to get better 
instead of abandoning me 
he would do that 
if you would just leave him alone 
leave him alone 
listen  i m sorry  i called a few times 
you didn t answer 
i didn t want to talk to your wife again 
that s why  once was enough 
  nola called  what did she say 
  look  i have to go 
your life is just a little too complicated
for me right now 
i ll see you at the next open house 
daddy 
what s the matter  sweetheart 
why aren t you sleeping 
i had a bad dream  a scary bad dream 
  what was the dream about  honey 
  i m afraid to tell you 
  why 
  the dream doesn t want me to 
candy  listen to me 
i know what happened at grandma s 
i know what you saw there 
i just came from the police   
and when i was there 
i saw the thing that hurt grandma 
and  candy  it s dead 
i saw it lying on a table 
and the police were there  and it s dead 
it can t hurt you now 
and it can t hurt me or anybody else 
do you understand me 
it s dead 
yes 
it s all right now  baby 
what do you think 
how many people do we have
at the main house 
twenty seven 
okay  i want them out by this afternoon   
and the house closed 
it ll be hard on them  hal  especially mike 
then do it gently 
but get them out 
all right 
  put your suitcases in the compartment 
  i don t want to go 
you have to go 
come on  i just want you to get on the bus   
you ll see the doctor 
i don t want to go 
  don t make me leave 
  i m not making you leave 
just be a good boy
and get on the bus  all right 
  hi  jan 
  frank  hi 
look  i think we ve got ourselves
a real live one 
come on upstairs 
there s somebody i want you to meet 
is this the guy from chicago 
no  he s a local boy 
he lives a lot closer to home
than you expected 
mr  carveth is here to see you 
look who s here 
nola s old man 
  the queen bee s favorite drone 
  jeez  he s pretty far gone 
he d be dynamite in court 
what did you mean when you said
nola s the queen bee 
she s the queen bee  all right 
she s the star 
she s the one he s interested in 
and the rest of us don t count anymore 
she doesn t even have to pay for it 
that s because she s the one
who was born to prove   
that  psychoplasmics
is the ultimate therapeutic device  
that s the quote  isn t it 
can you be my daddy 
he won t do it anymore 
and my real daddy won t do it 
and that bastard  dr  raglan 
won t do it anymore 
you see  my real daddy rejected me 
and my surrogate daddy rejected me 
that s just fucking wonderful 
don t you think 
calm down  mike  cool it 
and tell him what happened at somafree 
look   
i ll make a deal with you  okay 
just be my daddy 
please  i ll tell you anything
you want to know 
i ll bleed for you  want me to bleed 
no 
that s silly  right 
repulses you  i can see that 
you re not into it  so why do it  right 
besides  nobody could do it like dr  raglan 
not even real daddy 
and he knows it 
dr  raglan knows i m addicted to him   
and he doesn t care 
he s such a hard man 
i was at that demonstration last monday 
you and raglan seemed very close 
what happened 
he threw us out  all of us 
locked the door 
it s true 
i ve been in touch with some of the others 
they ve all been thrown out of somafree 
and all therapy suspended 
all except for your wife  she s still there 
doesn t anybody know why 
sure somebody knows  i know 
he wants to be alone with her 
dr  raglan wants to be alone with your wife 
   bye  daddy 
   bye 
  hi  frank 
  hi  wendy 
quickly but quietly  children 
rebecca  do you want to pass out
the blue papers  please 
and clayton  how about you pass out
the purple ones 
okay  let s see 
this person here 
you can do snowflakes  too 
that s a good idea 
help 
  what s the matter 
  they re hurting ms  mayer 
the bad kids are hurting ms  mayer 
they knocked her to the floor
and they re hitting her 
they re hitting ms  mayer 
they made her fall down 
candy 
it s all right  it s hal 
where s chris  chris usually wakes me up 
chris had to go into the city 
you ve been dreaming 
yes  i was having a wonderful dream 
wonderful 
and painful  at the same time 
my daughter was coming back to me 
and frank 
and ruth mayer 
was she in your dream 
candy s teacher 
i don t remember 
then maybe we should talk about her 
but i don t feel the need to talk about her 
you don t 
why not 
i don t know 
i think i must be getting stronger 
because somehow   
i just don t feel threatened by her anymore 
this is where my wife and kid lived
for nine months   
before nola moved out to somafree 
this is the first time i ve seen the place 
what are we doing here 
tell me  again 
i don t know 
i thought candy might come back here 
it s not a coincidence 
those things  those creatures   
they all disappeared together 
they ve got her 
you ve got to help me 
somebody s following me 
  somebody s always following me 
  did you find out anything 
  did you find out why they moved you out 
  i ve got to have something to eat  anything 
what did you find out 
why did they close somafree down 
  talk to me  now 
  okay 
raglan s onto something very big 
something to do with the kids 
  he just got bored with the rest of us 
  kids  what kids 
the disturbed kids in the work shed   
the ones your wife s taking care of 
what have you done with my kid 
where is she 
carveth  what the hell
are you talking about 
they took her 
they killed ruth mayer 
and then they brought candice back here 
they killed ruth mayer 
i want my daughter back  now 
did they bring her back here  back to nola 
i don t know 
if they brought her back here 
then she d be up there  in the attic 
that s where they live 
frank  i ve got a gun 
they ll kill you
if you try to take her away from them 
why 
because they understand
that she s one of them 
you re insane 
frank  they exist  you ve seen them 
they re just freaks  deformed children 
you ve got nola taking care of them 
i m sure she loves being
their surrogate mother 
she s not their surrogate mother 
she s their real mother 
their only mother 
  i m not gonna listen 
  they re her children 
more exactly 
they re the children of her rage 
they re motivated only by her anger 
whether that anger   
is conscious or subconscious 
i mean  when nola got cross with candy
last weekend   
annoyed  really   
the brood beat her 
but when she released her rage
against her parents  under therapy   
then they killed them 
i know  i didn t want to believe that   
but now they ve killed ruth mayer   
and they could kill you or me 
and she wouldn t even be aware of it 
i mean  she doesn t even know
that candy s here 
  i want candice back 
  then do it my way 
please 
it s the right way 
what do you want me to do 
i want you to go back into that hut   
and persuade nola that you want her back   
that you want your family back 
i want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband 
why 
because if you can keep nola
calm and happy   
then the brood s neutral 
if she s mellow 
then i can just walk into that attic   
pick up candy 
tuck her under my arm and walk out 
now  can you do that 
i don t know 
frank  if things go wrong   
if nola gets angry  if the kids get angry   
you understand 
i m not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger 
raglan  i don t trust you 
what does it matter 
i ll move up there 30 seconds after you re in 
frank  be nice to her 
hal 
it s me  nola  it s frank 
am i dreaming 
i thought you said you weren t going to
come and see me while i was here 
i think that was a misunderstanding 
that s why i m here 
i want us to understand each other 
you re the only woman in the world for me 
you always have been  you always will be 
it won t ever change 
i want you to know that 
i wish it were true  god  i wish it were true 
we lost touch 
that s the only reason
all this ever happened 
all we have to do
is make sure we don t lose touch again 
isolation is part of my therapy 
what s been happening to me
has been just too strange   
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life 
then make me a part of your new life 
let me be part of it 
show me  educate me  involve me 
i m ready now 
i wasn t before  but i m ready now 
candy 
are you ready for me  frank 
are you really 
i seem to be a very special person 
i m in the middle of a strange adventure 
let me be with you 
i want to go with you wherever you go 
do you 
do you 
yes 
then look 
daddy 
is it time to go to school yet 
no  sweetheart 
it s dr  hal 
and daddy s downstairs talking to mommy 
he wants to see you 
oh  god  nola 
no  i disgust you 
i sicken you 
you hate me 
you didn t come here because you love me 
you came here to take our daughter away
and give her to somebody else 
i wouldn t do that 
i wouldn t do that to you 
you go out of that door 
you find your daddy 
you liar  you re lying 
you re lying  i know 
i know you so well  and it won t work 
i d kill candice
before i let you take her away from me 
do you hear me 
i d kill candice before i let you take her 
make them stop 
they re doing what you want them to do
