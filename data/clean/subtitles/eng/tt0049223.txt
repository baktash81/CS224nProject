landed on the moon 
by 2200 a d   they had reached
the other planets of our solar system 
almost at once there followed
the discovery of hyper drive   
through which the speed of light
was first attained   
and later greatly surpassed 
and so at last 
mankind began the conquest   
and colonization of deep space 
united planets cruiser c 57 d   
now more than a year out from earth base
on a special mission   
to the planetary system of
the great main sequence star  altair 
  when do we get a d c  fix  jerry 
  half a minute  skipper 
ship on course  sir 
we ll reach d c  point at 1701 
that s less than three minutes now 
  all right  take it away 
  aye  aye  sir 
chief  we ll drop back below light speed
in about three minutes 
  got your breakable gear stowed 
  aye  aye  sir 
all right  good 
d c  set and punched on  skipper 
all right  attention  captain to crew 
all hands squared away to decelerate 
ship s beeper will  as usual 
sound ten times after lights dim 
  come on  doc  d c   bosun 
  aye  aye  sir 
d c  stations  on the double 
wanna bounce through this one 
all right  we re down
to 3896 of light speed 
it s a little warm
in here  skipper 
there s altair
right on the nose  skipper 
meanwhile  this ship
arranges its own eclipses 
okay  jerry  punch out
an orbit on the fourth planet 
aye  aye  skipper 
ship in approach  skipper 
helical vector oriented 
attention 
captain to crew  attention 
our destination  altair 4 
is now visible on the main view plate 
as you ll recollect from your briefing
lectures  this is an earth type planet 
twenty years ago  the spacecraft
belerephon landed here   
with a prospecting
party of scientists 
our mission is to search for survivors 
that is all 
the lord sure makes
some beautiful worlds 
how do these continents
check with the old charts 
be able to tell you better in a while 
skipper  it s time for brakes 
okay  take it away 
astrogator to crew 
stand by to change flux 
another one of them new worlds 
no beer  no women 
no pool parlors  nothing 
nothing to do but throw rocks at tin
cans  and we gotta bring our own cans 
attention  captain to crew 
we are now entering
the atmosphere of altair 4 
no survival suits
will be required upon landing 
oxygen content 
4 7 richer than earth standard 
gravity  only 897 
adjust your equipment accordingly 
that is all 
all hands  check equipment 
not even any short range
radio signals yet 
not so far  sir 
can you make out
anything down there 
i may be missing
some individual structures   
but there are no cities 
ports  roads  bridges  dams 
there s just
no sign of civilization 
sir  we re being radar scanned 
  can you zero on it 
  no  sir 
it seems to emanate from
an area of about 20 miles square 
twenty miles square 
bosun  pass the alert 
combat stations  blaster men 
activate your scopes 
radio contact  sir 
there s a voice 
  human 
  it sounds like it 
boost it 
spaceship  identify yourself 
you re being tracked 
cut me in  quinn

expedition philologist  
  philologist 
  what do you wish here  cruiser 
you don t understand  we re your
relief  we re glad to find you alive 
i  of course 
appreciate your concern   
but absolutely no assistance
of any sort is required 
the red carpet treatment  huh 
dr  morbius  my orders are to
survey the situation on altair 4 
let me repeat 
i m in no sort of difficulty here 
your best procedure will be to
turn back at once without landing 
sorry  sir 
if you set down on this planet 
i warn you   
that i cannot be answerable for
the safety of your ship or your crew 
if you ll just supply me
with landing coordinates 
dr  morbius 
i require landing coordinates 
very well  but i wash my hands
of all responsibility 
  you have standard charts 
  yes  sir 
you may come in at 83 17 4 north   
148 21 west 
thank you 
it s right back there
in the desert 
commander  i urge you to reconsider 
please permit me to recommend   
something funny down there  skipper 
okay  jerry  i ll take her in 
right 
attention  captain to crew 
stand by to reverse polarity 
standard class  a  security
will be maintained upon landing   
and until further notice 
all hands will wear side arms 
that is all 
  artificial gravity off 
  grav  off 
  half flux 
  half flux 
  cut primary coils 
  primaries cut  sir 
all clear  sir 
look at the color of that sky 
yeah  but i ll still take blue 
i don t know  i think a man
could get used to this   
and grow to love it 
bosun  you can assemble the tractor 
better check the command mike 
  the command mike  sir 
  oh  good idea 
  chief 
  sir 
you re in command now  quinn 
you keep right at those instruments 
  aye  aye  sir 
  hey  what s this dust coming 
looks like we re being met 
bosun 
hold the tractor 
  quite a vehicle  huh 
  that driver must be a madman 
what driver 
welcome to altair 4  gentlemen 
i am to transport you
to the residence 
if you do not speak english   
i am at your disposal
with 187 other languages   
along with their various
dialects and sub tongues 
colloquial english
will do fine  thank you 
this is no offense 
but you are a robot  aren t you 
that is correct  sir 
for your convenience  i am monitored
to respond to the name  robby  
nice climate you have here 
high oxygen content 
i rarely use it myself  sir 
it promotes rust 
hey  doc 
is it a male or a female 
in my case  sir  the question
is totally without meaning 
will you get in  gentlemen 
quinn  tractors if i blink red 
  i ll bring a tractor in a hurry  sir 
  right 
passengers will please
fasten their seat belts 
looks after us like a mother 
if you gentlemen will go in 
you re expected 
  i am morbius 
  i am commander adams 
this is lieutenant farman 
my executive   
and lieutenant ostrow 
our ship s doctor 
how ironic that a simple scholar
with no ambition   
beyond a modest measure of seclusion 
should  out of a clear sky   
find himself besieged by
an army of fellow creatures   
all grimly determined
to be of service to him 
i m sorry  sir  if we re not welcome 
but we do have our orders 
but you must stay
for lunch  gentlemen   
and do forgive the ill manners
of an old recluse 
won t you come in 
whatever that lunch was 
it was certainly delicious 
simply some of robby s synthetics 
  he s your cook too 
  even manufactures the raw materials 
come around here  robby 
i ll show you how this works 
one introduces a sample of human food
through this aperture 
here there s a small built in chemical
laboratory where he analyzes it 
later he can reproduce identical
molecules in any shape or quantity 
why  it s a housewife s dream 
plus absolute selfless obedience 
activate the dispose all unit 
a household disintegrator beam 
put your arm in there 
order cancelled 
don t attribute feeling
to him  gentlemen 
robby is simply a tool 
tremendously strong  of course 
he could quite easily topple
this house off its foundation 
in the wrong hands  mightn t
such a tool become a deadly weapon 
no  doctor  not even though i were the
mad scientist of the tape thrillers   
because  you see  there happens
to be a built in safety factor 
commander  may i borrow that
formidable iooking side arm of yours 
thank you 
robby  point this thing at that
althaea frutex out there on the terrace 
fire 
you understand the mechanism 
yes  morbius 
a simple blaster 
all right 
now turn around here 
point it at the commander 
aim right between the eyes 
fire 
you see  he s helpless   
iocked in a sub electronic dilemma
between my direct orders   
and his basic inhibitions
against harming rational beings 
cancelled 
if i were to allow
that to continue   
he would blow
every circuit in his body 
doctor  how did you
come by such a mechanism 
uh  i didn t
 come by  him  doctor   
i tinkered him together
during my first months up here 
  coffee is ready  sir 
  gentlemen 
doctor  do you mean that
you made this gentleman 
a useful enough toy  lieutenant   
but nowadays i have
no time for such things 
dr  morbius  you re a philologist 
an expert in words and languages   
their origins and meanings 
yet this robot of yours
is beyond the combined resources   
of all earth s physical science 
my dear commander 
maybe you overestimate   
both robby and myself 
gentlemen  let me show you
another bit of parlor magic 
forgive me  i didn t mean
to alarm you  gentlemen 
i had robby install
the steel shutters   
before i realized how
altogether safe i am here 
well  gentlemen 
this has been very pleasant 
you ve seen how
comfortable i am here   
no hardships 
no special difficulties   
and no need at all
for military assistance 
now i daresay you re impatient
to get back to base 
yes  the moment we ve interviewed the
other members of the belerephon party 
others  but there are
no others  commander 
before the first year was out 
they had all  every man and woman   
succumbed to a   
to a sort of a planetary force here   
some dark  terrible 
incomprehensible force 
only my wife and i were immune 
and just how do you account
for your immunity  dr  morbius 
we differed from the others only
in our special love for this world   
in our boundless longing
to make a home here   
far from the scurry
and strife of humankind 
i remember how  when the vote
was taken to return to earth   
she and i were utterly heartbroken 
how could we have foreseen the
extinction of coworkers and friends 
skipper  there is no record of any wife
in the belerephon rolls 
lieutenant  look under
 biochemistry   julia marsin 
she and i were married
by the skipper on the voyage here 
i have the certificate 
i thought robby had managed some
very charming feminine touches 
i take it mrs  morbius
isn t at home today 
my dear wife died
a few months after the others 
only in her case 
it was of natural causes 
i m very sorry 
dr  morbius 
just what were the symptoms   
of all those other deaths 
the unnatural ones 
the symptoms were
striking  commander 
one by one 
in spite of every safeguard   
my coworkers were torn
literally limb from limb 
by what 
by some devilish thing
that never once showed itself 
  and the belerephon 
  vaporized   
as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off 
and yet  in all these 19 years   
you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force 
only in nightmares
of those times 
and yet  always in my mind   
i seem to feel the creature
is lurking somewhere close at hand   
sly and irresistible  and only waiting
to be re invoked for murder 
father 
alta 
alta  i specifically asked you   
not to join us for lunch 
but  father  lunch is over 
i m sure you never said a word
about not coming in for coffee 
well  did you or did you 
this is commander adams   
dr  ostrow and  uh 
lieutenant farman 
  my daughter 
  how do you do 
i ve always so terribly wanted to meet
a young man  and now three at once 
  that s very kind of you 
  you re lovely  doctor 
of course  the two end ones
are unbelievable 
could this end one
get you some coffee 
i m quite able to get it 
thank you 
thank you 
of course  you must make allowances
for my daughter  gentlemen 
she s never known any human being
except her father 
i hope you ll make
allowances too  sir 
we young men have been shut up in
hyperspace for well over a year now   
and right from here 
the view looks just like heaven 
sugar 
but you keep helping me 
after all  you re not robby 
i wouldn t mind being robby
in certain ways 
that s only in certain ways 
of course 
i can see that was probably very clever 
but i don t seem to understand it 
well  there s   
there s no rush 
i suppose one day i shall be obliged
to make the trip to earth with her   
for the sake of her
natural development 
i should say fairly soon too 
your father wasn t too happy at first
about your meeting us  was he 
well  naturally not 
you re from earth 
  what s wrong with earth 
  how lucky i am  though 
all three of you are such
very fine exceptions 
  you are exceptions  aren t you 
  oh  sure  sure 
that is  i am  anyway 
old dependable jerry 
of course  the doc can be trusted too 
in the daytime 
what about the commander 
well  i hate to tell
you this  alta  but   
that man is notorious
throughout seven planetary systems 
oh  dear 
what does he do 
well  i don t feel
free to discuss   
the shortcomings of
a fellow officer  but   
any girl or woman who lets him
get her alone  anywhere   
yes  i can see it now 
there  just then when he looked at me 
his eyes almost had fire in them 
i m so glad you don t have
any fire in your eyes  lieutenant 
well  i m not that harmless 
  alta 
  yes  father 
these gentlemen have expressed
a very kindly concern   
  over the amount of liberty you have 
  liberty 
i told them that you have my permission
to visit earth whenever you choose 
earth  i 
then my little girl
never feels ionely or confined 
why  i don t know 
i have you and robby and all my friends 
friends 
  perhaps you d better call them  dear 
  all right 
come  gentlemen 
i felt something
go right through my head 
alta s whistle is above the pitch of
human hearing  i often feel it myself 
  what s up 
  look 
no  watch 
why  he s as tame as a kitten 
outside of the range of my daughter s
influence  it s still a deadly beast 
just a routine checkup from the ship 
  what  chief 
  everything okay  commander 
  no problem 
  would you mind activating the viewer 
as you can see  we re under
no restraint whatsoever 
knock that off  quinn 
if i can be of any help to you in your
preparations for the homeward voyage   
thank you  sir  but unfortunately
circumstances may keep us here a while 
  circumstances 
  you see  my orders   
don t quite seem to cover
the belerephon fatalities 
i am forced now to contact base
for new instructions 
but  commander 
suppose these new instructions   
require my return to earth
for questioning   
two years or more
away from my work here 
tell me  just what is involved
in your making contact with earth base 
fundamentally 
it s a question of crude power   
how to short circuit the continuum
on a five or six parsec level 
of course  a transmitter like that
isn t standard equipment 
  no 
  to build one   
we d cannibalize about two thirds
of the ship s electronic gear   
and then unship
the main drive to juice it 
just to construct a bunker to house
the core would take about ten days 
disabled here
for ten days and nights 
tell me  would two inch
lead shielding do as well 
it d be better if we happened to be
carrying 100 square yards of the stuff 
then i ll have robby
run it off for you   
and you ll get it
not later than tomorrow noon 
that s very obliging of you  sir 
obliging 
look out there  commander 
the belerephon party 
nineteen years ago
i dug those graves with my own hands   
and i have  believe me 
no wish to repeat that experience 
we ll see you again soon 
alta  i hope 
  thank you very much  doctor 
  excellent lunch  doctor 
to tell the truth  i sometimes
still miss the conversation   
of such gentlemen
as yourself  doctor 
well  thank you for your
courtesy and concern  sir 
fasten your seat belts  gentlemen 
easy with this core  our m g  coils
won t take us home without it 
come on  cookie  out of the way 
you wanna get run over 
handle it gently 
it has to get us home 
  is it far enough away from the ship 
  sure  no interference there 
  what about the magnetic pull 
  bosun  drop the thing down over there 
aye  aye  sir 
where do you wish
the shielding stacked  sir 
you can just put it right over
there by the core  thank you 
wait a minute 
that s solid lead he s carrying 
common lead would have
crushed the vehicle  sir 
this is my morning s run
of isotope 217 
the whole thing
hardly comes to ten tons 
hello  alta 
does your father know you re here 
he did tell me not to go near the ship 
but this isn t very near 
  cookie  out of here 
  aye  aye  sir 
yes  sir 
commander  put me down  sir 
  commander 
  what is it  chief 
if you d like
to check my assembly   
for the monitor unit
of the klystron transmitter   
  what  already 
  yes  sir 
excellent 
are    are these condensers
out of my accelerator circuits 
yes  sir  i borrowed some solenoids
from your gyrostabilizers too 
here s the big deal  sir 
i ll bet any quantum mechanic
would give his life   
for a chance to fool around
with this gadget 
get this in the ship by dark 
it won t do any good to have some fool
fall on it before we transmit tomorrow 
  good work  quinn 
  thank you  sir 
come here  over here 
can i be of service  sir 
never mind the  sir   but i m
a stranger in this so called planet   
and i was just wondering
if you could tell me   
where i could get hold
of some of the real stuff 
   real stuff  
  just for cooking purposes 
i take a big pride in my duties 
pardon me  sir   stuff  
just about one jolt left 
oh  genuine ancient rocket bourbon 
see here  hey 
you low living contraption 
i oughta take a can opener to you 
quiet  please 
i am analyzing 
yes  relatively simple alcohol molecules
with traces of fusel oil 
would 60 gallons be sufficient 
gallons 
i ve been from here to there in
this galaxy  and i want you to know   
you re the most understanding soul
i ever met up with 
it s nothing really personal 
just a kiss 
hmm  but why should people
want to kiss each other 
it s an old custom 
all the really high civilizations
go in for it 
  but it s so silly 
  but it s good for you  though 
it stimulates the whole system 
as a matter of fact  you can t
be in tip top health without it 
really 
i didn t know that 
i d be only too happy
to show you 
well  thank you very much 
lieutenant 
no trouble at all 
is that all there is to it 
well  you ve sort of
got to stick with it 
just once more  do you mind 
not at all 
there must be something
seriously the matter with me   
because i haven t noticed
the least bit of stimulation 
honey  let s do this thing right 
now  here 
are you giving me the treatment 
are you 
lieutenant farman 
don t say a word  sir 
i know there are lots of pressing duties
waiting for me back at the ship   
and rank doth have
its little privileges  hmm  sir 
and you can depend on it that
those privileges won t be stretched   
into taking your kind of advantages 
  but l   
  dismissed 
what s the matter with him 
why did you both act so funny 
well  what d you expect 
don t you understand  alta 
no  well  look at yourself 
you can t dress like that around men 
especially not a space wolf like farman 
so for pete s sake  go home
and put on something that il   
anything 
what s wrong with my clothes 
i designed them myself 
stop looking at me that way 
i don t think i like it 
what do you mean 
we were just trying to get
some healthy stimulation   
from hugging and kissing 
that s all 
oh  that s all 
it s so easy for you  isn t it 
there s no feelings  no emotions 
you  uh   
nothing human would
ever enter your mind 
it so happens that i m in command
of 18 competitively selected   
super perfect
physical specimens   
with an average age of 24 6   
who have been locked up
in hyperspace for 378 days 
it would have served you right
if i hadn t have    and he   
get out of here before i have you
run out of the area under guard   
and then i ll put
more guards on the guards 
 and then i ll put
more guards on the guards  
i don t like him 
i just don t like him 
the way he kept looking at me 
then he shouted 
  what about 
  i don t know  really 
it was awful 
i was only trying to be nice
about kissing the lieutenant 
  how did the commander react to that 
  he was furious 
he seemed to think that all that about
biology had something to do with me 
personally  i mean 
i ve never been so nervous in my life 
i hope i don t see him again
if i live to be 400 million 
well  i daresay
you won t have to 
the best thing you can do
is to go to bed 
i still have some work
to do in my study 
  good night  my dear 
  good night 
where have you been 
i ve beamed and beamed 
sorry  miss 
i was giving myself an oil job 
and what is it you require
this time  miss alta 
robby  i must have a new dress 
right away 
  again 
  but this one must be different 
absolutely nothing must show   
below  above or through 
radiation proof 
no  just eye proof will do 
  thick and heavy 
  oh  no  robby 
it must be the loveliest 
softest thing you ve ever made for me   
and fit in all the right places 
with lots and lots of star sapphires 
star sapphires take a week
to crystallize properly 
would diamonds or emeralds do 
well  if they re large enough 
five  ten and fifteen carats 
and on hand 
i will run the dress up for you
in time for breakfast 
  sleep well  miss 
  thank you  robby 
i don t really care now
whether i do or not 
funny to see two moons
in the sky  isn t it 
funny how quick
a guy gets used to it 
  joe 
  what 
  do you hear something 
  like what 
like a sort of big breathing 
that s funny  i did 
strong and grey  last night during
your watch this ship was entered   
and valuable government property
was sabotaged 
the two of you claim to have
been at your posts and awake 
yet this ship was entered 
the heavy duty hatch was raised   
and latched back  and neither of you
saw or heard anything 
except you  grey 
you heard breathing 
and  youngerford  let me see 
you were asleep in your bunk   
and you think you had a dream 
a dream 
pending more evidence  you re deprived
of space pay and all privileges 
  me too  sir 
  no  you ll stand 20 extra watches 
i ll have less dreaming
aboard this ship 
dismissed 
half of this gear we can replace
and the rest we can patch up somehow   
except this special
klystron frequency modulator 
with every facility of the ship 
i think i might be able to rebuild it   
but frankly  the book says no 
it came packed in liquid boron
in a suspended grav   
all right  so it s impossible 
how long will it take 
well  if i don t
stop for breakfast   
  get on it  quinn 
  thank you  sir 
the tractor s ready  sir 
  wait  i ll put on a clean uniform 
  you d better stay as you are 
  i m leaving you in command here 
  oh  i see 
establish a standard perimeter
and set up a class  a  alert by sundown 
aye  aye  sir 
good morning  gentlemen 
we d like to see dr  morbius 
morbius is in his study  sir   
never to be disturbed
while that door is closed 
all right  we ll wait 
is there any other way
out of there 
this is the only door 
in case you require anything 
gentlemen  use the beamer 
how could he have
slipped past two sentries 
nothing important  skipper 
doc  you stay right there where you are
and keep your eye on that door 
okay  skipper  if morbius comes out 
we ll call you from right here 
good morning 
good morning 
  come on in 
  didn t bring my bathing suit 
what s a bathing suit 
oh  murder 
never mind 
i m coming out 
alta  listen 
you mustn t   
you just wait right there 
it ll only take me a second to get dry 
  i ll just turn my back here 
  lf that s the way you feel about it 
don t worry  you re not gonna
have to look at me anymore 
you ll see 
  see what 
  you ll see what 
now wait a minute  alta 
if you re planning on   
i sure didn t expect to see you today
after the way you spoke to me yesterday 
i m very sorry about the way
i spoke to you yesterday 
i was sort of bothered 
all right  you can look now 
nothing shows through  does it 
i had it made
especially for you 
oh  i thought you weren t
expecting me today 
i wasn t 
i guess there s just something
about me personally you don t like 
you always look just beautiful 
then why don t you kiss me
like everybody else does 
everybody 
hasn t your father
taught you anything 
well  he says
i m terribly ignorant   
but i have had
poetry and mathematics   
iogic  physics  geology and bi   
ology 
of course  that s mostly
on the theoretical side 
well  so far 
what s wrong with theory 
this 
it s all right 
he s my friend 
i m sorry  alta 
i had to do that 
he didn t recognize me 
he would ve killed me  why 
  you really don t know  do you 
  no  i don t 
  is he still in there 
  hasn t come out 
wait a minute  skipper 
after all  it is his house 
what s the matter 
doc  something new
has been added 
that s gonna
complicate things a bit 
not even a window 
the robot lied 
morbius hasn t been in here 
doc  he s up to something 
look at this  skipper 
  hieroglyphics 
  maybe 
but it doesn t look like
egyptian or cuneiform   
or chinese 
you ll find the household silver
in the dining room   
and my daughter s jewelry
on her dressing table 
dr  morbius   
last night our klystron monitor
was sabotaged 
and you suspect me 
then the time has come
for clarification 
sit down 
in times long past   
this planet was the home of
a mighty and noble race of beings   
which called themselves the krell 
ethically 
as well as technologically   
they were a million years
ahead of humankind   
for in unlocking
the mysteries of nature   
they had conquered
even their baser selves   
and when  in the course of eons 
they had abolished sickness   
and insanity and crime
and all injustice   
they turned 
still with high benevolence   
outward toward space 
long before the dawn of man s history 
they had walked our earth   
and brought back
many biological specimens 
i see  that explains
the tiger and the deer 
the heights they had reached   
but then  seemingly on the threshold
of some supreme accomplishment   
which was to have crowned
their entire history   
this all but divine race
perished in a single night 
in the 2 000 centuries
since that unexplained catastrophe   
even their
cloud piercing towers   
of glass and porcelain
and adamantine steel   
have crumbled back into
the soil of altair 4   
and nothing  absolutely nothing
remains above ground 
what were they like 
no record of their
physical nature has survived   
except  perhaps  in the form
of this characteristic arch 
i suggest you consider it
in comparison to one of our   
functionally designed human doorways 
that recording was made by krell
musicians a half a million years ago 
if you will follow me  i will show you
some of their other remaining artifacts 
krell metal 
try your blaster there  commander 
this spot should be molten 
it s not even warm 
and no trace of radioactivity 
the molecules are many times
more densely interlocked   
than in earthly steel   
yet it drinks up energy
like a sponge 
this is just one
of their laboratories 
you will notice that much
of the equipment is familiar   
though designed
for nonhuman technicians 
what s this 
on this screen
may be projected   
the total scientific knowledge
of the krell   
from its primitive beginning
to the day of its annihilation   
a sheer bulk surpassing
many million earthly libraries 
  you re able to read this 
  a little  it s my profession 
twenty years ago 
i began here with   
this page
of geometrical theorems 
eventually i was able to deduce
most of their huge  logical alphabet 
i began to learn 
the first practical result
was my robot   
which you gentlemen
appear to find so remarkable 
child s play 
i ve come here every day now
for two decades   
painfully picking up a few of the least
difficult fragments of their knowledge 
a thing like this 
it s too big to evaluate 
think what a discovery of this kind   
what is this device over here 
i call it
their  plastic educator  
as far as i can make out  they used it
to condition and test their young   
in much the same way
as we once employed finger painting   
among our kindergarten children 
i often play with it myself
for relaxation   
although working here 
i sometimes wish i d been blessed   
with multiple arms and legs 
now  you can see
that this headset   
was designed for something
much bulkier than my human cranium 
now  over here you see   
the electromagnetic waves
of my brain   
sending that indicator up
about halfway 
i gather that
one of their own young   
comparable to
a seven year old child   
was normally expected to send that
all the way to the top   
which by krell standards
classifies me as a low grade moron 
yet i have
an officially recorded iq of 183 
now then  for the primary function 
actually  to operate   
well  i ll choose a familiar subject
to start with to save time 
there now  gentlemen 
what s that 
what s happening there 
a statue 
that s altaira 
simply a three dimensional image 
commander 
but it s alive 
because my daughter is alive in my brain
from microsecond to microsecond   
while i manipulate 
there 
something of a strain 
aladdin s lamp
in a physics laboratory 
would you gentlemen care to take
the krell test of your intelligence 
  yes  very much 
  you may be disappointed  commander 
suppose we start
with the good doctor 
  what do i do 
  just sit down there  and i il   
move forward 
there now 
now  doctor 
you can read it here 
there s something wrong here 
i have an iq of 161   
yet i don t register
a third what you did 
now the commander 
it s all right  sir  a commanding
officer doesn t need brains 
just a good loud voice  huh 
do i pull this switch
to make an image 
stop  you d never survive 
our belerephon skipper tried it 
and it was instantly fatal to him 
oh  i see 
so you re immune to this too 
in my first attempt
at creating an image here   
my brain pattern there
was scarcely any larger than yours 
afterwards  i lay unconscious
for a day and a night 
yet you came back
for a second go at it 
it was a question
of science  doctor   
but you can imagine my joy
when i discovered that the shock   
had permanently doubled
my intellectual capacity 
otherwise  my researches here
would have come to nothing   
poor as they have been 
recently i have turned up
some rather puzzling indications   
that in those final days
before their annihilation   
the krell had been applying
their entire racial energies   
to a new project   
one which they actually
seemed to hope   
might somehow free them
once and for all   
from any dependence
on physical instrumentalities 
a civilization
without instrumentalities 
incredible 
dr  morbius 
everything here is new 
not a sign of age or wear
on any of it 
young man  these devices 
self serviced  self maintained   
have stood exactly as you see them
for 2 000 centuries 
2 000 centuries 
and during all this time 
what was their power source 
that s a good question 
may i draw your attention
to these gauges   
all around here  gentlemen 
their calibrations
appear to indicate   
that they are set
in decimal series   
each division recording
exactly ten times as many amperes   
as the one preceding it 
ten times ten
times ten times ten   
times ten times ten 
on and on and on   
row after row 
gauge after gauge 
but there is no direct wiring
that i can discover 
however  when i
activate this machine   
it registers infinitesimally 
you see   
down there in the lower
left hand corner 
and then   
when i activate
the educator here   
it registers a little more 
but this much is negligible 
the total potential here must be
nothing less than astronomical 
nothing less 
the number ten
raised almost literally   
to the power of infinity 
gentlemen  would you care to see
some more of the krell wonders 
  indeed  yes 
  yes 
if you will 
step in this shuttle car 
how often the krell technicians
have ridden in this little vehicle 
what now  dr  morbius 
prepare your minds
for a new scale   
of physical scientific values 
gentlemen 
twenty miles 
twenty miles 
listen 
circuits opening and closing 
and they never rest  this is
one of their ventilator shafts 
you can feel the warm air rising 
look down here 
look down  gentlemen 
are you afraid 
7 800 levels 
and 400 other shafts
like this one 
yes  a single machine 
a cube 20 miles on each side 
for 2 000 centuries
it has waited patiently here   
tuning and lubricating itself 
replacing worn parts 
i have reason to believe
that 16 years ago   
a minor alteration was performed   
throughout the entire 8 000 cubic miles
of its own fabric 
but what s it all for 
sometimes the gauges
register a little   
when the buck deer fight in the autumn
or when birds fly over in the spring   
and nearly a whole dial
became active   
when your ship first approached
from deep space 
i ll show you a section
of one of the power units 
these units are sunk
in the body of the planet   
fifty miles
right below our feet 
now  be sure and look
only in the mirror 
man does not behold
the face of the gorgon and live 
9 200 thermonuclear reactors
in tandem 
the harnessed power
of an exploding planetary system 
all hands  stand clear
of fence area 
all right  quinn  turn it on 
  have you tested it yet  bosun 
  right away  sir 
  there you are  sir 
  very good 
lieutenant  having completed
my washing up duties after chow   
i request the lieutenant s permission
to take a walk   
outside the perimeter  sir 
  there s nothing out there 
  but there is  sir 
i mean    well  i thought it might
brighten the boys  mess up a bit   
if i could find a few
wild radishes or something 
i don t know what you re lying about 
but you better get back   
before the skipper does 
or we ll both be skinned 
yes  sir  yes  sir 
quinn  this is farman 
kill the power on the fence 
all right  put it back on 
480 pints   
as you requested 
total  60 gallons 
genuine kansas city bourbon 
it s smooth too 
robby  i ain t never
gonna forget this 
any time you re hard up
for lube oil  let me know 
what s up 
somebody coming this way 
no  sir 
nothing coming this way 
the fence is shorting 
shall i shut down
the current  sir 
no  it s stopped now 
check over the whole system
in the morning 
aye  sir 
it s strange how that fence
just shorted out 
you re too arbitrary  commander 
perhaps i do not choose to be
dictated to in my own world 
dr  morbius  a scientific find
of this magnitude   
has got to be taken
under united planet supervision 
no one man can be allowed
to monopolize it 
for the past two hours
i ve been expecting you   
to make exactly
that asinine statement 
just one moment  commander 
for close on 20 years now
i ve been constantly   
and i hope dispassionately 
considering this very problem   
and i have come
to the unalterable conclusion   
that man is unfit as yet
to receive such knowledge   
such almost limitless power 
whereas morbius  with his
artificially expanded intellect   
is now ideally suited to administer
this power for the whole human race 
precisely  doctor 
such portions then
of the krell science   
as i may  from time to time 
deem suitable and safe   
i shall dispense to earth 
other portions 
i shall withhold 
and in this  i shall be
answerable exclusively   
to my own conscience
and judgment 
dr  morbius  in the absence
of special instructions   
you leave me
in a very awkward position 
  commander adams 
  speaking  lieutenant 
skipper  the chief s
been murdered 
quinn  murdered 
yes  he was alone 
working on the monitor 
the rest of us were outside
on guard duty  l   
  how was it done 
   done  
skipper  his body is plastered
all over the communications room 
leave everything as it is 
we re on our way 
it s started again 
is that it 
i tried to make a plaster model
from the footprints we found 
37 inches by 19 
why  it s fantastic 
doc  i don t understand 
whatever walks on this would be quite
an opponent for a man with a club   
but with our weapons 
quinn could have   
no  this thing runs counter to
every known law of adaptive evolution 
what do you mean 
notice this structure here 
characteristic
of a four footed animal 
yet our visitor last night
left the tracks of a biped 
primarily a ground animal too 
yet this claw could only belong
to an arboreal creature   
like some impossible tree sloth 
just doesn t fit into normal nature
anywhere in the galaxy 
this is a nightmare 
is that what you made
out of that footprint 
i think it s fairly close 
pardon me  commander  are you ready
to hold discipline on the cook  sir 
yeah  let s have him 
i m obliged to remind you that i gave
him permission to go out last night 
did you give him permission
to get falling down drunk 
drunk  sir  me  sir 
ask dr  ostrow  sir 
four pints of 120 proof bourbon
without a trace of hangover in it 
that ain t natural 
besides  why did that robert argue me
into drinking all that whiskey 
you were with the robot last night 
yes  sir 
him and me  we kind of got to
toasting each other s good health   
just for cordial interplanetary
relations  you understand 
now  that s all the time 
even while the chief was being killed 
certainly  sir 
i hope you don t think i got
that stiff in five minutes 
all right  dismissed 
i guess that kind of
washes the robot up 
where does that leave us
for suspects 
maybe it leaves us
with the same one 
maybe we should drop over
to that krell laboratory   
and get our iqs boosted
a couple of hundred percent 
sir  burial detail is ready 
ashes to ashes  dust to dust 
  dismissed 
  company  dismissed 
fine technician 
good shipmate 
that s a good epitaph
for any man 
good day  dr  morbius 
i daresay neither of us
slept any last night 
that s a pretty close guess 
i warned you while your ship
was still in space 
i begged you not to land
on this planet 
believe me  commander 
that is only a foretaste 
the belerephon pattern
is being woven again 
remain here and the next attack
on your party   
will be more deadly and general 
how do you know that 
know  l   
i seem to visualize it 
if you wish  call it   
a premonition 
what do you make of that  skipper 
i d say it sounded
like an ultimatum 
  bosun 
  aye  sir 
bosun  i want a clear field
of fire in all directions 
  aye  aye  sir 
  randall 
how soon will radar
be operational 
  operating right now  sir 
  good  keep on it yourself 
  aye  aye  sir 
  the m a  alert is completed 
  aye  aye  sir 
  fine 
activate main batteries 
alarm for test 
fire 
check good 
lieutenant  you got
your trouble squad in hand 
yes  sir  but they re
a little trigger happy 
they re sort of edgy
to see whatever s out there 
oh  jerry 
this may be a big deal coming up 
i m sorry if i ve leaned on you   
stop knocking yourself out  skipper 
she picked the right man 
  what is it  randall 
  radar just picked up something

  give me audio com 
  aye  aye  sir 
attention 
this may have been a ruse to divert us
from some other part of the perimeter 
continue watching
on your own immediate fronts 
that is all 
what 
it just stopped
at the foot of the pass 
are you sure you ve got
a real blip there 
big as a house  and we were
on target with both bursts 
it s coming on again 
  straight across 
  it shows here 
it s still coming

father 
alta 
  alta  where are you 
  father 
what is it 
what s the matter 
i just had a terrible dream 
there was blood and fire
and thunder   
and something awful was moving
in the middle of it 
i could hear it roar and bellow 
now  now  you know
a dream can t hurt you 
not me  not us 
the thing i saw was trying
to break in the camp 
it was gonna kill   
you ll take care of him for me 
won t you  you ll protect him 
my darling  i m completely helpless
as long as he remains here so willfully 
come now 
  bosun 
  yes  sir 
get those graves dug 
keep the men busy 
  the busier the better 
  randall 
give me audio com 
well  men  whatever it was 
our main battery stopped it 
you believe that 
no  it just went away
for some reason  it ll be back 
doc  an invisible being   
that cannot be disintegrated
by atomic fission 
no  skipper  that is
a scientific impossibility 
hypnotic illusions
don t tear people apart 
that s true enough   
but any organism dense enough to
survive three billion electron volts   
would have to be made
of solid nuclear material 
it would sink of its own weight
to the center of this planet 
you saw it yourself standing there
in those neutron beams 
there s your answer 
it must have been renewing
its molecular structure   
from one microsecond
to the next 
  bosun  i want the tractor 
  ready  sir 
we pick up the girl and her father
whether they like it or not 
section 86a 
 evacuate all civilians
from disaster areas  
you left out
two very important words 
 where feasible  
if you remember
the belerephon expedition   
their ship was vaporized
trying to lift off 
which makes it a gilt edged priority
that one of us   
gets into that krell lab
and takes that brain boost 
  bosun 
  aye  sir 
i m leaving you in command 
get the ship operational 
do your best to wait it out
for me and the doctor   
but the second that fence starts
to short again  lift off   
and report back to earth base
on conditions in this sector 
right  skipper 
all right  get everything
aboard ship  we re pullin  out 
no lights showing 
look  doc  in case
we make it into that lab   
i ll take the first go
at the iq booster 
you hear me 
i hear you 
i am monitored to admit no one
at this hour 
that sounded final 
maybe if we reasoned with him 
my beams are focused
on your blasters  gentlemen 
hasn t he got a built in rule
against wringing our necks for us 
that is true  sir 
yet i am monitored
to admit no one 
  let them in 
  this is your father s order 
  get out of the way 
  quiet 
emergency cancellation archimedes 
why are you here 
we were attacked 
three more men dead 
including jerry farman 
i don t know 
it was   
just some kind of big outline
in the disintegrator beams 
and you can t explain it 
well  anyway  we fought it 
and we lost 
  i figure it ll be back 
  you must leave  now 
i m not going without you 
but i can t possibly leave him alone 
i just can t 
  then we ll take him 
  by force 
i can t agree to that either 
can t you  you don t realize
what s loose on this planet 
but i m immune 
like both my parents 
that s what he says 
nothing could be immune to that thing   
oh  darling  please go 
oh  please 
if you love me  go 
alta  doc  will you talk
some sense to this girl 
i m in over my head  doc 
doc 
on the sofa  robby 
so you took the brain boost  huh 
you oughta see my new mind 
up there in lights 
bigger than his now 
easy  doc 
morbius was too close
to the problem 
the krell had completed their project 
that big machine 
no instrumentalities 
true creation 
doc  let s have it 
  but the krell forgot one thing 
  yes  what 
monsters  john 
monsters from the id 
the id  what s that 
talk  doc 
doc 
how romantic 
the fool 
the meddling idiot 
as though his ape s brain
could contain the secrets of the krell 
father  he s dead 
he was warned 
and now he s paid 
let him be buried with the other victims
of human greed and folly 
morbius  you wanted me
to make a choice 
now you ve chosen for me 
i m ready to go with you  darling 
i will place him
in the tractor  sir 
thank you 
she mustn t do this 
she must be prevented 
morbius  what is the id 
my daughter is planning a very foolish
action  and she ll be terribly punished 
  what is the id 
  id  id  id 
it s an obsolete term   
i m afraid 
once used to describe   
the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind 
monsters from the id 
monsters from the subconscious 
of course 
that s what doc meant 
the big machine    8 000 cubic miles
of klystron relays   
enough power for a whole population
of creative geniuses   
operated by remote control 
morbius  operated by
the electromagnetic impulses   
of individual krell brains 
to what purpose 
in return  that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter   
to any point on the planet  in any shape
or color they might imagine   
for any purpose  morbius 
creation by mere thought 
why haven t i seen this all along 
like you  the krell forgot
one deadly danger   
their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction 
the beast 
the mindless primitive 
even the krell must have
evolved from that beginning 
and so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious   
had access to a machine
that could never be shut down 
the secret devil
of every soul on the planet   
all set free at once
to loot and maim   
and take revenge and kill 
my poor krell 
after a million years
of shining sanity   
they could hardly have understood
what power was destroying them 
yes  young man 
all very convincing
but for one obvious fallacy 
the last krell died
2 000 centuries ago   
but today  as we all know   
there is still at large
on this planet a living monster 
your mind refuses
to face a conclusion 
what do you mean 
what do you mean 
  morbius 
  what 
something is approaching
from the southwest 
it is now quite close 
  could robby be wrong 
  no  never 
there it comes 
i feel sorry for you 
young man 
feel sorry for your
daughter  morbius 
it s listening 
  alta  go into my study 
  you still refuse to face the truth 
  what truth 
  morbius  that thing out there 
  it s you 
  you re insane 
you have led it here where alta
must see you torn to pieces 
you think she s immune 
she s joined herself to me 
  yes  and whatever comes  forever 
  say it s a lie 
let it hear you 
tell it you don t love this man 
not even if i could 
stop it  robby 
don t let it in  kill it 
it s no use 
he knows it s your other self 
we re safe 
why did you jumble
that combination 
whatever you know in here 
your twin self in the tunnel knows too 
i m not a monster  you   
we re all part monsters
in our subconscious 
  so we have laws and religion 
  let me go 
you ve got to listen 
we don t have much time 
here s where your mind
was artificially enlarged 
consciously it still lacked the power
to operate the great machine   
but your subconscious
had been made strong enough 
  i won t hear you 
  you ve got to listen 
twenty years ago  when your comrades
voted to return to earth   
you sent your secret id out
to murder them 
not quite realizing it  of course 
except maybe in your dreams 
what man can remember
his own dreams 
at least when we approached from space 
you remembered enough to warn us off 
but when you thought we were a threat
to your little egomaniac empire   
your subconscious
sent its id monster out again 
more deaths  morbius 
more murder 
and now this too 
harm my own daughter 
but now she s defying you  morbius   
and even in you  the loving father 
there still exists   
the mindless primitive   
more enraged and more inflamed
with each new frustration 
so now you re whistling up
your monster again   
to punish her for her disloyalty
and disobedience 
and if you don t do something
about it soon   
it s going to be coming
right through that door 
solid krell metal  26 inches thick 
look at your gauges  look 
that machine is going
to supply your monster   
with whatever amount of power
it requires to reach us 
look now 
red hot 
soon it ll be white hot 
then it ll soften and melt 
alta  say you don t believe this of me 
tell me you don t 
then it must be true 
yes  i must be guilty 
then help us  darling 
i ve known you great and noble
like the krell 
guilty  guilty 
my evil self is at that door 
and i have no power to stop it 
stop  no further 
i deny you  i give you up 
father  oh  father 
son   
turn that disc 
the switch  throw it

you must be 100 million miles
