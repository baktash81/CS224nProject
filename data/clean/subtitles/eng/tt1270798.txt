hetro chromia 
a gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first 
 chuckles  newman  a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady  please 
  how did you know that 
  lucky guess 
the name s  xavier 
charles xavier 
  how do you do   
  amy 
hetrochromia  is in reference to your eyes 
which i have to say are stunning 
one green  one blue  it s a mutation 
it s a very groovy mutation 
i ve got news for you  amy 
you are a mutant 
first you proposition a girl 
and then you call her  deformed 
how is that seduction tactic working for you 
i ll tell you in the morning 
no  seriously though  you mustn t knock it 
mutation s go from single cell organisms
to being the dominate form of
reproductive life  on this planet 
infinite forms of variations with each generation 
all through  mutation 
then let s reclaim that word 
  mutant  and proud 
  chin  chin  hey 
hi  i guess i have to buy my own drink 
i m sorry  one cola 
charles here was just telling me that i m
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs 
tiny bit sexier 
i m sorry  this is my sister  raven 
  hi  amy 
  and what do you study 
  waitressing 
  aah 
oh look  you have hetero chromia too 
  say  what 
  look at her eye  
 clears throat 
right  raven get your coat please 
charles  don t talk to me  you did
that on purpose 
  raven  i did not 
  charles  yes you did 
raven  why would i do it on purpose 
you know i can t control it sometimes 
raven  when i m stressed or tired  
charles  you seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now 
 mutant and proud 
why is it always the pretty mutations 
or invisible ones like yours 
if you re a freak  better hide 
you re being ridiculous 
look  i don t mean to
sound like an old fart 
  which you are        sometimes  but
we ve talked about this  raven 
a small slip up is one thing 
a big one does not bear thinking about 
 mutant and proud 
 mutant and proud  
if only   
  would you date me 
  of course i would 
any young man would be lucky to have you 
  you re stunning 
  looking like this 
like  you   what 
blue 
  you re my oldest friend 
  i m your only friend 
thank you for that 
well 
i m incapable of thinking of you that way 
you   i feel responsible for you 
anything else would just feel   wrong 
  but what if you didn t know me 
  unfortunately i do know you 
i don t know what s got into you lately 
you re awfully concerned with your looks 
i m sleepy 
will you read to me 
i can t  i have my thesis coming up  i have to study 
well fine  read about your thesis
it always sends me right off 
to homo neanderthalensis 
his mutant cousin homo sapiens 
was an aberration 
charles  peaceful co habitation  if ever it existed 
was short lived 
records show  without exception that the
arrival of the mutated human species
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin 
man  possession of this gold is illegal 
i should inform the police 
let s not play this game 
where did you get it 
a friend 
he recommended your bank  most highly 
man  i see

yes 
and you should know mine 
this gold is what remains of my people 
melted from their possessions 
torn from their teeth 
and you re going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it 
 tsking

  back like a loop the loop  
  and around like a merry go round  
  we ate and ate at a hot dog stand  
  we danced around to a rockin  band  
  and when i could  i gave that girl a hug  
  in the tunnel of love  
  you ll never know how great a kiss can feel  
  when you stop at the top of a ferris wheel  
  when i fell in love  down at palisades park  
man  hello beautiful  how are you 
hey baby  you want to find a quiet place 
i m so sorry 
i ve been booked by colonel hendry 
excuse me 
  we ate and ate at a hot dog stand  
  we danced around to a rockin  band  
  and when i could  i gave that girl a hug  
  in the tunnel of love  
  you ll never know how great a kiss can feel  
  when you stop at the      
 music playing on record player 
  are you sure we can t get you a refill  bob 
  bob  no 
so  i hear you blocked the proposal
to position jupiter missiles in turkey 
  i expect you ll reconsider 
  bob  we ve had this conversation 
you put our nukes in turkey 
or anywhere that close to russia 
and you re looking at war 
nuclear war 
 click and whirling sound 
i don t ask for favors  colonel 
i express my expectations 
so  let me say it again 
i expect you ll reconsider 
the only thing i will reconsider  is having
another glass of that delicious champagne 
 sound of wind whistling 
bob  what the hell did you put in my drink 
 grunts  loud thud 
frost    you re thinking of running  hiding 
we d find you  hendry   
  there s not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out   
shaw  magnificent  isn t she  bob 
genetic mutation  the evolution of a human genome 
where s azazel 
 high pitched whistle 
shaw  ah  we don t want
the colonel to be late 
come here 
man  missiles in turkey send a very clear message 
we ever decided to fire them 
the russian early warning system won t
even have time to kick in 
mccone  this better be important  mactaggert
whoa  whoa  whoa  slow down 
you smoking them funny cigarettes 
people don t disappear 
colonel hendry was there 
he was there mccone  in the hellfire club 
colonel hendry 
i agree with you  general 
i ve reconsidered my position 
and i now believe that we should put
jupiter missiles in turkey 
colonel hendry is here 
so  unless he magically traveled
3 000 miles in the last ten minutes 
listen to me  i suggest that you stop
wasting my time 
looks like hendry wants to start
world war iii 
i have better things to deal with right now  mactaggert 
sir  i    
have you lost your mind 
so  now what 
we find an expert on genetic mutation 
man announcing  professor of genetics 
charles francis xavier 
raven  so  how does it feel to be a professor 
charles  well  don t call me that  
you don t get to be called a professor until
you actually have a teaching position 
raven  i know  but it suits you 
charles  no  don t say that  do say

for a pretty little beam with a
mutated mcr 1 gene  i have five 
i say  mcr 1  you would say 
golden hair 
it s a mutation  it s a very groovy mutation 
mutation you know  took us from single
celled organisms 
to the dominate form   
you know what  this   
   routine may go over great with the
co eds  but i m here on business 
  what 
  i really need your help 
all right 
the kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis 
i need to know if they may have already happened 
in people alive today 
 no sound 
professor 
i think we should just talk when you re sober 
do you have any time tomorrow 
something tells me  you already know
the answer to your question

thank you 
miami  florida
  shaw  still drinking champagne  bob 
  bob  i will pass 
okay  well so much for the pleasantries 
i was wondering  who you told
about our little arrangement 
no one 
  he s telling the truth 
  shaw  good 
well i guess we re done here 
let s wrap things up  shall we 
bob  well i knew better than to trust you 
now you let me walk out of here
with my money 
or i will pull this pin and we all die 
go ahead  pull it 
i ll do it  i swear to god 
no you won t 
but i will 
you re one of them 
shaw  very astute of you  colonel hendry 
you want to guess what i can do 
i ve got the power to absorb energy 
it keeps me young 
that s the boring part 
the fun stuff is what i can do with it
once i got it 
the advent of the nuclear age 
may have accelerated the mutation process 
individual s with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us 
thank you very much 
mactaggert  you really think that some crackpot scientist 
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men 
you just brought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool 
this meeting is over 
uh  please sit down agent  mactaggert 
i didn t really expect you to believe me 
given that all you could think about during my presentation 
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary 
it s apple pecan 
i haven t been entirely honest with you  luv  i m sorry 
you see  one of the many spectacular
things my mutation allows me to do 
is that i can read your mind 
i ve seen this before in a magic show 
are you going to ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now 
no  agent stryker  
although i could ask you about your son
william who you were thinking about 
which is very nice 
but i think i d rather ask you
about the jupiter   
   missiles america are currently placing in turkey 
he s a goddamn spy 
you brought a goddamn spy 
i did not  i would never bring one here 
how s that for a magic trick 
best i ve ever seen 
i want them out of here 
and lock down until i can figure out
what to do 
my facility is off site  i ll take them 
i can t believe this 
you d think the director of the cia
would have a little more composure 
we should be going after shaw right now  but   
   instead he s up there worrying about the wrong mutants 
what are we doing to do  lavene 
lavene 
lavene  what s wrong with you 
charles    absolutely nothing 
i ve just frozen him for the
moment because i d like to talk to you   
  it s good  isn t it   
  i m as interested in this 
sebastian shaw as you are   
     and if you still want my help  meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage   
man in black  i ve always known that
there were people like you out there 
i ve been the laughing stock of
this agency for years but i knew it 
you re going to love my facility 
  charles  that s going to have to wait 
  man in black  why 
agent mactaggert has to lead us to sebastian shaw 
and if we don t move now apparently
we re going to loose him 
what 
not only can he read minds 
he can communicate with them as well 
moria and i have just had a lovely conversation 
  yes  we did 
  that is incredible 
 charles chuckles 
but i cannot take you anywhere else 
without permission from upstairs 
  would you like to see one more magic trick

covert cia research base
man in black  welcome to my facility 
my mission has been to investigate the
application of paranormal powers
for military defense 
or offense 
this guy  shaw  schmidt  whatever
you want to call him 
he s working with the russians 
we might need your help to stop him 
marvelous 
so we re to be the cia s new
mutant division  yes 
something like that 
hank  it s a supersonic  the most
advanced plane ever built 
you should see it in real life 
it s incredible 
hank  these are the special new recruits i
was telling you about 
this is  hank mccoy 
one of our most talented young researchers 
how wonderful  another mutant 
already here 
  why didn t you say 
  say what 
because you don t know 
i am so  so terribly sorry 
hank 
you didn t ask  so i didn t tell 
so your mutation s what 
you re super smart 
charles  i ll say  hank here graduated
honors at the age of fifteen 
i wish that s all it was 
you re among friends now  hank 
you could show off 
 charles laughs with joy 
splendid 
  sorry 
  charles  yes  yes 
 all laugh 
  you re amazing 
  really 
tv announcer  the presence of u s  missiles
in turkey represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of the soviet union 
warned russian mister gromeko  earlier today
but he was quick to insist the russians would 
not be the first to initiate any military action 
yeah  we ll fix that as soon as
we get to russia 
  unless the cia finds us first 
  i ll take care of them too 
if that telepath gets inside your head 
he won t be as much fun as i am 
already in hand  my love 
shaw  the russians   
   made me this 
so  what am i thinking 
i don t know 
i was thinking that you are the most
exquisite thing i ve ever seen in my life 
and that this needs ice 
 taps glass 
shaw  fetch me some 
there s a good girl 
 radar pinging 
hank  i   i promised myself i d find a cure 
ever since i was a little boy 
you have no idea what i d give to feel   
     normal 
  normal 
charles has never understood 
he s different  but he s never had to hide 
hank this serum that you re making 
it doesn t affect abilities  right 
just appearance 
normalizes it 
yeah 
do you think it would work on me 
i can look into it  if you d like 
that s the least i can do after asking you to
come down here with such a weird request 
i have to admit 
usually when guys ask me out they re
not after my blood 
s  sorry  i didn t intend to be forward 
i was just   i was excited 
you know  the nature of your mutation 
if any genes hold the key to
changing appearance  it s yours 
hank  you aren t being forward 
that s kinda what i meant 
  no  but i m just sorry if you thought i was 
  and i m sorry that you weren t 
go ahead  take the blood 
sorry  did i hurt you 
kinky 
by the way  if i looked like you 
i wouldn t change a thing 
charles  what i know about you  i m
surprised you ve managed to stay this long 
  what do you know about me 
  everything 
then you know to stay out of my head 
i m sorry erik  but i ve seen what
shaw did to you 
i felt your agony 
i can help you 
 tiredly exhales 
i don t need your help 
charles  don t kid yourself 
you needed my help last night 
it s not just me you re walking away from 
here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself 
i won t stop you leaving  i could 
but i won t 
charles  shaw s got friends 
charles  you could do with some 
man in black  hank turned that
radar installation into a transmitter 
it s designed to amplify brain waves 
   so it could enhance your telepathic powers 
help us find other mutants for our division 
what if they don t want to be found by you 
erik 
you decided to stay 
if a new species is being discovered 
it should be by its own kind 
charles and i find the mutants 
no suits 
first of all  that s my machine out there 
second of all  and much more importantly 
this is charles  decision 
charles is fine with the cia being involved 
isn t that right 
no  i m sorry but  i m with erik 
charles  we ll find them alone 
what if i say no 
then good luck using your installation without me 
hank  i call it  cerebro 
  charles  isn t that spanish for  brain  
  hank  yes 
okay so  the electrodes connect
charles to the transmitter on the roof 
and picks up a mutant 
his brain sends a signal through a relay 
and then the co ordinates of their
location are printed out here 
  you designed this 
  yeah 
  what an adorable lab rat you make  charles 
  don t spoil this for me  erik 
i ve been a lab rat  i know one when i see one 
okay  right   
  are you sure we can t shave your head 
  don t touch my hair

it s like his reach is   
   amplified 
they re recruiting 
shaw  you go on to russia 
i ll handle him 
charles  i can t stop thinking
about the others out there 
all those minds that i ve touched 
i could feel them  their isolation  their hopes 
their ambitions 
i tell you  we ve started something
incredible  erik 
  we can help them 
  can we 
identification  that s how it starts 
then ends with being rounded up 
experimented on  eliminated 
not this time 
we have common enemies  shaw

good evening
my name s  sebastian shaw 
and i am not here to hurt you 
agent  freeze 
azazel   
my friends  there s a revolution coming 
when mankind discovers who we are 
what we can do 
each of us will face a choice 
be enslaved  or rise up to rule 
choose freely  but know that if you are not with us 
then by definition you are against us 
so  you can stay  and fight for the
people who hate  and fear you 
or you can join me 
and live like kings 
and queens 
  angel 
  are you kidding me 
come on  we don t belong here 
and that s nothing to be ashamed of 
we have to do something 
 broken glass jingles 
stop  i m coming with you 
good choice 
so tell me about your mutation 
well  i adapt to survive 
  so i guess i m coming with you 
  i like that 
  alex                do it 
  get down 
protecting your fellow mutants 
shaw  it s a noble gesture 
feels good 
adapt to this 
moscow  russia
hello 
once again  my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the cia 
these americans are ruthless 
now they have their missiles placed in turkey 
i expect you ll be planning
missile sites of your own 
somewhere you know the american
early warning system won t help 
i hear cuba is lovely this time of year 
and so close to florida 
missiles in cuba 
you re serious 
we may as well declare war 
maybe i wasn t clear enough 
you will make this happen 
okay 
let s see what kgb think about this 
hello  general armivolkoff 
it s nothing 
 tires screech  doors slam 
raven 
charles  we ve made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately 
  sean  we re not going home 
  what 
  he s not going back to prison 
  they killed  darwin 
charles  all the more reason for you to leave 
this is over 
darwin s dead  charles 
and we can t even bury him 
we can avenge him 
erik  word please 
  they re just kids 
  no  they were kids 
shaw has his army  we need ours 
charles  we ll have to train 
all of us 
  yes 
  yeah 
well we can t stay here 
even if they reopen the department 
it s not safe 
we ve got no where to go 
yes  we do 
mccone  the law says we ve got to turn her over 
stryker  the law applies to human beings 
the same laws don t apply to mutants 
they re to dangerous 
times like this  security is more
important than liberty 
  there s a war coming  john 
  mccone  yes  but a war with who 
 screech of glass cutting 
 tap 
excellent question 
though i won t call it a war exactly 
that suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning 
captain  no sign of any american ships 
maintain course  full ahead 
man  the russians have
sent their warheads to cuba 
we have a week before their ship hits the coast 
our fleet can be on this line 
when the russian missile ship arrives 
if that ship crosses the line  they will have
declared war against the united states 
we will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response 
do we agree 
man  dispatch the seventh fleet 
  this is yours 
  no  it s ours 
honestly charles  i don t know how you survived 
living in such hardship 
well it was a hardship softened by me 
come on  time for the tour 
moscow  russia
dear comrades 
the united states have dispatched
war ships for cuba 
this leaves us with no choice 
comrade first secretary 
we must send in our fleet 
dispatch the fleet 
 camera flash 
tv announcer  president kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation 
setting up a blockade of all missiles 
armed for cuba 
the soviet union reacted by terming it
as step   
along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war 
  you re sure 
  i m sure 
all right 
no  no i can t i m sorry  i can t shoot
anybody point  blank  let alone my friend 
oh come on  you know i can deflect it 
you re always telling me i should push myself 
if you know you can deflect it  then
you re not challenging yourself 
what ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine 
what  i can t 
something that big  i need the situation  the anger 
no  the anger s not enough 
  well it s gotten the job done all this time 
  it s nearly gotten you killed all this time 
hey  come here 
let s try something a little more challenging 
my step father took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously  this way 
that s why he had this bunker built down here 
i thought we could use it as a practice range of sort 
you don t think i m going to blow though the walls 
no  he had this place built to
with stand a nuclear bomb 
i think it can handle you  alex 
you know when i do this 
bad things tend to happen 
that s because you can t control it 
it controls you 
that s why we re here  alex 
it s part of your training 
 sonic whistle 
 glass shatters 
 charles joyfully laughs 
what you re doing is incredible 
you re hitting a pitch with sound waves at
the same resonate frequency of the glass 
that s why it shatters 
but this  it s like any
other muscle in the body 
you can control it 
 in each of us  two natures are at war  
  robert louis stevenson   jekyll and hyde  
  top marks 
still it really wasn t really about good
and evil  was it  hank 
it was about man s animal nature 
and his struggle to control it 
to conform 
it is that struggle which is holding you back 
jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of 
you are too 
if you re serious about me doing this 
you might want to get back 
  of course  should i shut the door 
  yeah 
charles  whenever you re ready 
 explosion  light beeping 
 fires roaring 
oh my god 
charles  i will teach you to control this  alex 
sean  you re sure that this will work 
anything is possible  i based the design   
hank  stop talking 
come on 
now remember  scream as hard as you can 
you need the sound waves to be supersonic 
catch them at the right angle 
and they should carry you 
 they should carry me  
that s reassuring 
good luck 
charles  and don t forget to scream 
ahh 
if you want to beat me this time 
you have to set the beast free 
charles  on your marks  get set   go 
oh  congratulations my friend 
robert louis stevenson
would have been proud 
impressive  hank 
feet like those  all you need is a red nose 
right  bozo 
  i m done here 
  thank you  alex
charles  come on  hank 
erik  if you re using half the
concentration to look normal 
then you re only half paying attention to
whatever else you do 
just pointing out something that could save your life 
you want society to accept you 
but you can t even accept yourself 
alex  sexy 
this is just the prototype 
the real one will look considerably better 
it ll be a whole suit 
see these sensors measure
your energy output  this panel
focuses it and the excess is absorbed 
all right try hitting the one in the middle 
just the one in the middle  mind 
charles  good luck 
 plasma beam blasts 
oomph 
you ought to see this  your genes are
extraordinary  you know that 
your cells age at half the rate of a normal human 
when you re forty you will still
have the looks of a teenager 
you have the most incredible cellular
structure i ve ever seen 
  sean  you truly believe i ll fly this time 
  charles  unreservedly 
  i trust you 
  i m touched 
  i don t trust him 
  say nothing 
i m going to die 
all right  look we re not going to make
you do anything that your not so   
here  let me help him 
erik 
 screams 
whaoooo 
 laughs 
wahhh hooo 
what 
you know you were thinking the same 
wonderful work hank  thank you very much 
all right alex  i want you to hit the x 
and try not to hit me  there s a good chap 
  you re serious 
  i m very serious 
charles  i have complete and utter faith in you 
 plasma beam explodes 
  am i still a bozo 
  yes  hank  you re still a bozo 
but nice job 
see that 
try turning it to face us 
 exhales 
you know  i believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity 
would you mind  if i    
what did you just do to me 
i accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system 
it s a very beautiful memory erik  thank you 
i didn t know i still had that 
there s so much more to you than you know 
not just pain  and anger 
there s good too  i felt it 
and when you can access all that 
you will possess a power no one can match 
not even me 
so  come on  try again 
 metal in satellite dish creaking 
  moira  hey 
  well done 
the president is about to make his address 
tv announcer  it shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear missile 
   crossing the embargo line  that surrounds cuba 
as an attack by the soviet union
on the united states 
requiring a full retaliatory response 
upon the soviet union 
  that s  where we re going to find  shaw 
  how do you know 
charles  two super powers facing off  and
he want s to start world war iii 
he won t leave anything to chance 
so much for diplomacy 
i suggest you all get a good nights sleep 
kennedy     ultimately leads to war 
tv announcer  tensions mount as
the soviet missile ship nears cuba 
all diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed 
as the american people ready themselves 
for the likelihood of an atomic attack 
there are widespread reports of panic buying 
supermarkets cleared 
as shelters unused since the second world
war  are stocked for what may lie ahead 
in all its history  america has never
faced a greater threat 
the world is primed for war 
and there s no one to stop me 
 knock on door 
come in 
hank  hey 
got a surprise for you 
i isolated the right marker in your dna sample 
the serum works like an anti biotic 
attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation 
it won t affect our abilities 
just our appearance 
do you still want to do this 
should we have to hide 
you already do 
you re hiding right now 
like i have my whole life 
i don t want to feel like a freak  all the time 
  i just want to look   
     normal 
yeah 
hank  don t 
you re beautiful  hank 
everything you are  you re perfect 
raven  look at all of us  look at
all we ve achieved this week 
all we will achieve 
we are different  but we shouldn t
be trying to fit into society 
raven  society should aspire and be more like us 
mutant  and proud 
it behooves me to tell you 
but even if we save the world tomorrow 
and mutants are accepted into society 
my feet and your natural blue form 
will never be deemed beautiful 
you look beautiful now 
we need this cure 
cuba  russia  america makes no difference 
shaw s declared war on mankind 
on all of us 
he has to be stopped 
i m not going to stop shaw  i m going to kill him 
do you have it in you to allow that 
you ve known all along
why i was here  charles 
but things have changed 
what started as a covert mission 
   tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist 
shaw  us    they won t differentiate 
they ll fear us  and that
fear will turn to hatred 
not if we stop a war 
not if we can prevent  shaw 
not if we risk our lives doing so 
would they do the same for us 
we have it in us to be the better men 
we already are 
we re the next stage of human evolution 
  you said it yourself 
  enough 
are you really so naive 
as to think they won t battle their own extinction 
  or is it arrogance 
  i m sorry 
after tomorrow they re going to turn on us 
and you re blind to it  because you
believe they re all like moira 
and you believe they re all like  shaw 
listen to me  very carefully my friend 
killing shaw will not bring you peace 
peace was never an option 
 bones cracking 
no 
no 
 clothes tearing  bones cracking 
well   
this is a surprise 
the nice kind 
no  raven  i want to go to bed 
maybe in a few years 
 grown up voice  how about now 
i prefer the real  raven 
i said the real  raven 
perfection 
  could you pass me my robe 
  you don t have to hide 
have you ever looked at a tiger 
and thought you d want to cover it up 
no  but   
you re an exquisite creature  raven 
only in life the world has tried to tame you 
it s time for you to be free 
raven  you know sometimes i wonder
what my life would have been like 
if you hadn t found me here that night 
fairable  e  gah   ah 
for gods sake  raven 
where are you clothes 
pu   put some  put some clothes on 
that s not what you said when you first saw me 
but i guess pets are always cuter
when they re little  right 
raven  i don t know what s got into you lately 
i thought you d be in a good mood 
hank tells me that he s found the
answer to your cosmetic problem 
you going to tell me what s the matter 
or will i have to read your mind 
you promised me you would never do that 
until recently  i never had to use my powers
to know what you were thinking  raven 
you know charles  i used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world 
but no matter how bad the world gets 
you don t want to be against it  do you 
you want to be a part of it 
what the hell happened here 
  hank has been busy 
  do we really have to wear these 
as none of us has mutated to endure extreme g force 
or being riddled by bullets  i suggest we suit up 
where s hank 
hank  i m here 
hank 
it didn t attack the cells 
it enhanced them 
it didn t work 
yes it did  hank 
don t you see 
this is who you were meant to be 
this is you 
no more hiding 
never looked better  man 
hank

kennedy  in this week of thanksgiving 
there is much for which we can be grateful 
as you look back to where we stood 
only four weeks ago 
the unity of this hemisphere 
the support of our allies 
and the calm determination of the american people 
these qualities may be tested many
more times  in this decade 
moria  so how many students
do you think you ll have here 
once you get the academy up and running 
as many as i can manage  possibly more

to realize how lucky they were 
   to have professor x on their side

road to a professor now  aren t i
