hetrochromia
a gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first
chuckles newman a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady please
how did you know that
lucky guess
the names xavier
charles xavier
how do you do
amy
hetrochromia is in reference to your eyes
which i have to say are stunning
one green one blue its a mutation
its a very groovy mutation
ive got news for you amy
you are a mutant
first you proposition a girl
and then you call her deformed
how is that seduction tactic working for you
ill tell you in the morning
no seriously though you mustnt knock it
mutations go from single cell organisms
to being the dominate form of
reproductive life on this planet
infinite forms of variations with each generation
all through mutation
then lets reclaim that word
mutant and proud
chin chin hey
hi i guess i have to buy my own drink
im sorry one cola
charles here was just telling me that im
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs
tiny bit sexier
im sorry this is my sister raven
hi amy
and what do you study
waitressing
aah
oh look you have heterochromia too
say what
look at her eye
clears throat
right raven get your coat please
charles dont talk to me you did
that on purpose
raven i did not
charles yes you did
raven why would i do it on purpose
you know i cant control it sometimes
raven when im stressed or tired
charles you seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now
mutant and proud
why is it always the pretty mutations
or invisible ones like yours
if youre a freak better hide
youre being ridiculous
look i dont mean to
sound like an old fart
which you are      sometimes but
weve talked about this raven
a small slip up is one thing
a big one does not bear thinking about
mutant and proud
mutant and proud
if only
would you date me
of course i would
any young man would be lucky to have you
youre stunning
looking like this
like youwhat
blue
youre my oldest friend
im your only friend
thank you for that
well
im incapable of thinking of you that way
youi feel responsible for you
anything else would just feelwrong
but what if you didnt know me
unfortunately i do know you
i dont know whats got into you lately
youre awfully concerned with your looks
im sleepy
will you read to me
i cant i have my thesis coming up i have to study
well fine read about your thesis
it always sends me right off
to homo neanderthalensis
his mutant cousin homo sapiens
was an aberration
charles peaceful cohabitation if ever it existed
was short lived
records show without exception that the
arrival of the mutated human species
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin
man possession of this gold is illegal
i should inform the police
lets not play this game
where did you get it
a friend
he recommended your bank most highly
man i see
do you know our terms sir
yes
and you should know mine
this gold is what remains of my people
melted from their possessions
torn from their teeth
and youre going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it
tsking
dont touch that alarm
i want schmidt
klaus schmidt
where is he

hey baby you want to find a quiet place
im so sorry
ive been booked by colonel hendry
excuse me
we ate and ate at a hot dog stand
we danced around to a rockin band
and when i could i gave that girl a hug
in the tunnel of love
youll never know how great a kiss can feel
when you stop at the
music playing on record player
are you sure we cant get you a refill bob
bob no
so i hear you blocked the proposal
to position jupiter missiles in turkey
i expect youll reconsider
bob weve had this conversation
you put our nukes in turkey
or anywhere that close to russia
and youre looking at war
nuclear war
click and whirling sound
i dont ask for favors colonel
i express my expectations
so let me say it again
i expect youll reconsider
the only thing i will reconsider is having
another glass of that delicious champagne
sound of wind whistling
bob what the hell did you put in my drink
grunts loud thud
frost youre thinking of running hiding
wed find you hendry
theres not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out
shaw magnificent isnt she bob
genetic mutation the evolution of a human genome
wheres azazel
high pitched whistle
shaw ah we dont want
the colonel to be late
come here
man missiles in turkey send a very clear message
we ever decided to fire them
the russian early warning system wont
even have time to kick in
mccone this better be important mactaggert
whoa whoa whoa slow down
you smoking them funny cigarettes
people dont disappear
colonel hendry was there
he was there mccone in the hellfire club
colonel hendry
i agree with you general
ive reconsidered my position
and i now believe that we should put
jupiter missiles in turkey
colonel hendry is here
so unless he magically traveled
3000 miles in the last ten minutes
listen to me i suggest that you stop
wasting my time
looks like hendry wants to start
world war iii
i have better things to deal with right now mactaggert
sir i
have you lost your mind
so now what
we find an expert on genetic mutation
man announcing professor of genetics

moira mactaggert
charles xavier
do you have a minute
for a pretty little beam with a
mutated mcr1 gene i have five
i say mcr1 you would say
golden hair
its a mutation its a very groovy mutation
mutation you know took us from single
celled organisms
to the dominate form
you know what this
routine may go over great with the
coeds but im here on business
what
i really need your help
all right
the kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis
i need to know if they may have already happened
in people alive today
no sound
professor
i think we should just talk when youre sober
do you have any time tomorrow
something tells me you already know
the answer to your question
this is very important to me
and if i can help you i will do my utmost
thank you
miami florida
shaw still drinking champagne bob
bob i will pass
okay well so much for the pleasantries
i was wondering who you told
about our little arrangement
no one
hes telling the truth
shaw good
well i guess were done here
lets wrap things up shall we
bob well i knew better than to trust you
now you let me walk out of here
with my money
or i will pull this pin and we all die
go ahead pull it
ill do it i swear to god
no you wont
but i will
youre one of them
shaw very astute of you colonel hendry
you want to guess what i can do
ive got the power to absorb energy
it keeps me young
thats the boring part
the fun stuff is what i can do with it
once i got it
the advent of the nuclear age
may have accelerated the mutation process
individuals with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us
thank you very much
mactaggert you really think that some crackpot scientist
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men
you just brought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool
this meeting is over
uh please sit down agent mactaggert
i didnt really expect you to believe me
given that all you could think about during my presentation
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary
its apple pecan
i havent been entirely honest with you luv im sorry
you see one of the many spectacular
things my mutation allows me to do
is that i can read your mind
ive seen this before in a magic show
are you going to ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now
no agent stryker
although i could ask you about your son
william who you were thinking about
which is very nice
but i think id rather ask you
about the jupiter
missiles america are currently placing in turkey
hes a goddamn spy
you brought a goddamn spy
i did not i would never bring one here
hows that for a magic trick
best ive ever seen
i want them out of here
and lock down until i can figure out
what to do
my facility is off site ill take them
i cant believe this
youd think the director of the cia
would have a little more composure
we should be going after shaw right now but
instead hes up there worrying about the wrong mutants
what are we doing to do lavene
lavene
lavene whats wrong with you
charles absolutely nothing
ive just frozen him for the
moment because id like to talk to you
its good isnt it
im as interested in this
sebastian shaw as you are
and if you still want my help meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage
man in black ive always known that
there were people like you out there
ive been the laughing stock of
this agency for years but i knew it
youre going to love my facility
charles thats going to have to wait
man in black why
agent mactaggert has to lead us to sebastian shaw
and if we dont move now apparently
were going to loose him
what
not only can he read minds
he can communicate with them as well
moria and i have just had a lovely conversation
yes we did
that is incredible
charles chuckles
but i cannot take you anywhere else
without permission from upstairs

covert cia research base
man in black welcome to my facility
my mission has been to investigate the
application of paranormal powers
for military defense
or offense
this guy shaw schmidt whatever
you want to call him
hes working with the russians
we might need your help to stop him
marvelous
so were to be the cias new
mutant division yes
something like that
hank its a supersonic the most
advanced plane ever built
you should see it in real life
its incredible
hank these are the special new recruits i
was telling you about
this is hank mccoy
one of our most talented young researchers
how wonderful another mutant
already here
why didnt you say
say what
because you dont know
i am so so terribly sorry
hank
you didnt ask so i didnt tell
so your mutations what
youre super smart
charles ill say hank here graduated
honors at the age of fifteen
i wish thats all it was
youre among friends now hank
you could show off
charles laughs with joy
splendid
sorry
charles yes yes
all laugh
youre amazing
really
tv announcer the presence of us missiles
in turkey represents an unprecedented threat
to the people of the soviet union
warned russian mister gromeko earlier today
but he was quick to insist the russians would
not be the first to initiate any military action
yeah well fix that as soon as
we get to russia
unless the cia finds us first
ill take care of them too
if that telepath gets inside your head
he wont be as much fun as i am
already in hand my love
shaw the russians
made me this
so what am i thinking
i dont know
i was thinking that you are the most
exquisite thing ive ever seen in my life
and that this needs ice
taps glass
shaw fetch me some
theres a good girl
radar pinging
hank ii promised myself id find a cure
ever since i was a little boy
you have no idea what id give to feel
normal
normal
charles has never understood
hes different but hes never had to hide
hank this serum that youre making
it doesnt affect abilities right
just appearance
normalizes it
yeah
do you think it would work on me
i can look into it if youd like
thats the least i can do after asking you to
come down here with such a weird request
i have to admit
usually when guys ask me out theyre
not after my blood
ssorry i didnt intend to be forward
i was justi was excited
you know the nature of your mutation
if any genes hold the key to
changing appearance its yours
hank you arent being forward
thats kinda what i meant
no but im just sorry if you thought i was
and im sorry that you werent
go ahead take the blood
sorry did i hurt you
kinky
by the way if i looked like you
i wouldnt change a thing
charles what i know about you im
surprised youve managed to stay this long
what do you know about me
everything
then you know to stay out of my head
im sorry erik but ive seen what
shaw did to you
i felt your agony
i can help you
tiredly exhales
i dont need your help
charles dont kid yourself
you needed my help last night
its not just me youre walking away from
here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself
i wont stop you leaving i could
but i wont
charles shaws got friends
charles you could do with some
man in black hank turned that
radar installation into a transmitter
its designed to amplify brain waves
so it could enhance your telepathic powers
help us find other mutants for our division
what if they dont want to be found by you
erik
you decided to stay
if a new species is being discovered
it should be by its own kind
charles and i find the mutants
no suits
first of all thats my machine out there
second of all and much more importantly
this is charles decision
charles is fine with the cia being involved
isnt that right
no im sorry but im with erik
charles well find them alone
what if i say no
then good luck using your installation without me
hank i call it cerebro
charles isnt that spanish for brain
hank yes
okay so the electrodes connect
charles to the transmitter on the roof
and picks up a mutant
his brain sends a signal through a relay
and then the coordinates of their
location are printed out here
you designed this
yeah
what an adorable lab rat you make charles
dont spoil this for me erik
ive been a lab rat i know one when i see one
okay right
are you sure we cant shave your head
dont touch my hair
computer clicking and whirling
gasps

about the others out there
all those minds that ive touched
i could feel them their isolation their hopes
their ambitions

agent freeze
azazel
my friends theres a revolution coming
when mankind discovers who we are
what we can do
each of us will face a choice
be enslaved or rise up to rule
choose freely but know that if you are not with us
then by definition you are against us
so you can stay and fight for the
people who hate and fear you
or you can join me
and live like kings
and queens
angel
are you kidding me
come on we dont belong here
and thats nothing to be ashamed of
we have to do something
broken glass jingles
stop im coming with you
good choice
so tell me about your mutation
well i adapt to survive
so i guess im coming with you
i like that
alexdo it
get down
protecting your fellow mutants
shaw its a noble gesture
feels good
adapt to this
moscow russia
hello
once again my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the cia
these americans are ruthless
now they have their missiles placed in turkey
i expect youll be planning
missile sites of your own
somewhere you know the american
earlywarning system wont help
i hear cuba is lovely this time of year
and so close to florida
missiles in cuba
youre serious
we may as well declare war
maybe i wasnt clear enough
you will make this happen
okay
lets see what kgb think about this
hello general armivolkoff
its nothing
tires screech doors slam
raven
charles weve made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately
sean were not going home
what
hes not going back to prison
they killed darwin
charles all the more reason for you to leave
this is over
darwins dead charles
and we cant even bury him
we can avenge him
erik word please
theyre just kids
no they were kids
shaw has his army we need ours
charles well have to train
all of us
yes
yeah
well we cant stay here
even if they reopen the department
its not safe
weve got no where to go
yes we do
mccone the law says weve got to turn her over
stryker the law applies to human beings
the same laws dont apply to mutants
theyre to dangerous
times like this security is more
important than liberty
theres a war coming john
mccone yes but a war with who
screech of glass cutting
tap
excellent question
though i wont call it a war exactly
that suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning
captain no sign of any american ships
maintain course full ahead
man the russians have
sent their warheads to cuba
we have a week before their ship hits the coast
our fleet can be on this line
when the russian missile ship arrives
if that ship crosses the line they will have
declared war against the united states
we will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response
do we agree
man dispatch the seventh fleet
this is yours
no its ours
honestly charles i dont know how you survived
living in such hardship
well it was a hardship softened by me
come on time for the tour
moscow russia
dear comrades
the united states have dispatched
war ships for cuba
this leaves us with no choice
comrade first secretary
we must send in our fleet
dispatch the fleet
camera flash
tv announcer president kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation
setting up a blockade of all missiles
armed for cuba
the soviet union reacted by terming it
as step
along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war
youre sure
im sure
all right
no no i cant im sorry i cant shoot
anybody point  blank let alone my friend
oh come on you know i can deflect it
youre always telling me i should push myself
if you know you can deflect it then
youre not challenging yourself
what ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine
what i cant
something that big i need the situation the anger
no the angers not enough
well its gotten the job done all this time
its nearly gotten you killed all this time
hey come here
lets try something a little more challenging
my stepfather took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously this way
thats why he had this bunker built down here
i thought we could use it as a practice range of sort
you dont think im going to blow though the walls
no he had this place built to
with stand a nuclear bomb
i think it can handle you alex
you know when i do this
bad things tend to happen
thats because you cant control it
it controls you
thats why were here alex
its part of your training
sonic whistle
glass shatters
charles joyfully laughs
what youre doing is incredible
youre hitting a pitch with sound waves at
the same resonate frequency of the glass
thats why it shatters
but this its like any
other muscle in the body
you can control it
in each of us two natures are at war
robert louis stevenson jekyll and hyde
top marks
still it really wasnt really about good
and evil was it hank
it was about mans animal nature
and his struggle to control it
to conform
it is that struggle which is holding you back
jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of
you are too
if youre serious about me doing this
you might want to get back
of course should i shut the door
yeah
charles whenever youre ready
explosion light beeping
fires roaring
oh my god
charles i will teach you to control this alex
sean youre sure that this will work
anything is possible i based the design
hank stop talking
come on
now remember scream as hard as you can
you need the sound waves to be supersonic
catch them at the right angle
and they should carry you
they should carry me
thats reassuring
good luck
charles and dont forget to scream
ahh
if you want to beat me this time
you have to set the beast free
charles on your marks get setgo
oh congratulations my friend
robert louis stevenson
would have been proud
impressive hank
feet like those all you need is a red nose
right bozo
im done here
thank you alex
charles come on hank
erik if youre using half the
concentration to look normal
then youre only half paying attention to
whatever else you do
just pointing out something that could save your life
you want society to accept you
but you cant even accept yourself
alex sexy
this is just the prototype
the real one will look considerably better
itll be a whole suit
see these sensors measure
your energy output this panel
focuses it and the excess is absorbed
all right try hitting the one in the middle
just the one in the middle mind
charles good luck
plasma beam blasts
oomph
you ought to see this your genes are
extraordinary you know that
your cells age at half the rate of a normal human
when youre forty you will still
have the looks of a teenager
you have the most incredible cellular
structure ive ever seen
sean you truly believe ill fly this time
charles unreservedly
i trust you
im touched
i dont trust him
say nothing
im going to die
all right look were not going to make
you do anything that your not so
here let me help him
erik
screams
whaoooo
laughs
wahhh hooo
what
you know you were thinking the same
wonderful work hank thank you very much
all right alex i want you to hit the x
and try not to hit me theres a good chap
youre serious
im very serious
charles i have complete and utter faith in you
plasma beam explodes
am i still a bozo
yes hank youre still a bozo
but nice job
see that
try turning it to face us
exhales
you know i believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity
would you mind if i
what did you just do to me
i accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system
its a very beautiful memory erik thank you
i didnt know i still had that
theres so much more to you than you know
not just pain and anger
theres good too i felt it
and when you can access all that
you will possess a power no one can match
not even me
so come on try again
metal in satellite dish creaking
moira hey
well done
the president is about to make his address
tv announcer it shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear missile
crossing the embargo line that surrounds cuba
as an attack by the soviet union
on the united states
requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the soviet union
thats where were going to find shaw
how do you know
charles two super powers facing off and
he wants to start world war iii
he wont leave anything to chance
so much for diplomacy
i suggest you all get a good nights sleep
kennedy ultimately leads to war
tv announcer tensions mount as
the soviet missile ship nears cuba
all diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed
as the american people ready themselves
for the likelihood of an atomic attack
there are widespread reports of panic buying
supermarkets cleared
as shelters unused since the second world
war are stocked for what may lie ahead
in all its history america has never
faced a greater threat
the world is primed for war
and theres no one to stop me
knock on door
come in
hank hey
got a surprise for you
i isolated the right marker in your dna sample
the serum works like an antibiotic
attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation
it wont affect our abilities
just our appearance
do you still want to do this
should we have to hide
you already do
youre hiding right now
like i have my whole life
i dont want to feel like a freak all the time
i just want to look
normal
yeah
hank dont
youre beautiful hank
everything you are youre perfect
raven look at all of us look at
all weve achieved this week
all we will achieve
we are different but we shouldnt
be trying to fit into society
raven society should aspire and be more like us
mutant and proud
it behooves me to tell you
but even if we save the world tomorrow
and mutants are accepted into society
my feet and your natural blue form
will never be deemed beautiful
you look beautiful now
we need this cure
cuba russia america makes no difference
shaws declared war on mankind
on all of us
he has to be stopped
im not going to stop shaw im going to kill him
do you have it in you to allow that
youve known all along
why i was here charles
but things have changed
what started as a covert mission
tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist
shaw us they wont differentiate
theyll fear us and that
fear will turn to hatred
not if we stop a war
not if we can prevent shaw
not if we risk our lives doing so
would they do the same for us
we have it in us to be the better men
we already are
were the next stage of human evolution
you said it yourself
enough
are you really so naive
as to think they wont battle their own extinction
or is it arrogance
im sorry
after tomorrow theyre going to turn on us
and youre blind to it because you
believe theyre all like moira
and you believe theyre all like shaw
listen to me very carefully my friend
killing shaw will not bring you peace
peace was never an option
bones cracking
no
no
clothes tearing bones cracking
well
this is a surprise
the nice kind
no raven i want to go to bed
maybe in a few years
grown up voice how about now
i prefer the real raven
i said the real raven
perfection
could you pass me my robe
you dont have to hide
have you ever looked at a tiger
and thought youd want to cover it up
no but
youre an exquisite creature raven
only in life the world has tried to tame you
its time for you to be free
raven you know sometimes i wonder
what my life would have been like
if you hadnt found me here that night
fairable egahah
for gods sake raven
where are you clothes
puput some put some clothes on
thats not what you said when you first saw me
but i guess pets are always cuter
when theyre little right
raven i dont know whats got into you lately
i thought youd be in a good mood
hank tells me that hes found the
answer to your cosmetic problem
you going to tell me whats the matter
or will i have to read your mind
you promised me you would never do that
until recently i never had to use my powers
to know what you were thinking raven
you know charles i used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world
but no matter how bad the world gets
you dont want to be against it do you
you want to be a part of it
what the hell happened here
hank has been busy
do we really have to wear these
as none of us has mutated to endure extreme g force
or being riddled by bullets i suggest we suit up
wheres hank
hank im here
hank
it didnt attack the cells
it enhanced them
it didnt work
yes it did hank
