the next
how am i to bear it
when you are gone
i am going only
half a mile emma
but great is
the difference between
a mrs weston half a mile away
and a miss taylor in the house
dear emma
you have been a friend
and companion
such as few possess
a governess in office but
little short of a mother
in affection
i wish you every happiness
on your wedding day
poor miss taylor
its a pity mr weston
ever thought of her
papa mr weston is
such a goodhumored
pleasant excellent man
he thoroughly deserves
a good wife
and you would not have had
miss taylor
live with us forever
when she might have had
a house of her own
a house of her own
where is the advantage
of a house of her own
this is
three times as large
its entirely unnecessary
poor miss taylor
poor isabella
my sister married
seven years ago papa
you must be
reconciled to it by now
that was a terrible day
it shall always be
a matter of great joy to me
that i made the match myself
everyone said mr weston
would never marry again
but i did not believe it
emma you should not make
matches or foretell things
whatever you say
always comes to pass
you must not make any more
i promise to make none
for myself papa
but i must indeed
for other people
it is the greatest amusement
in the world
and after such success
you know
miss bates mrs bates
miss gilbert mrs cox
mr woodhouse sir
miss woodhouse
mr cole mrs cole
good morning
mmiss woodhou
mmiss woodhouse
morning
is this not the most happy
happy thethe most fortunate
this morning i could not get
my bonnet on for trembling
hmm
surrounded by blessings
wanting for nothing
i am trembling again
it is too joyful
what is it emma
i have a fancy
that mr westons son
may surprise us
frank weston
hes frank churchill now papa
hes his uncles heir
when he came of age
he took his uncles name
i so long to meet him
but how do you know
he might surprise us
it is his fathers wedding day
mr weston speaks of him
so highly
i cannot doubt
that he will come
poor miss taylor
dearly beloved friends
we gather here
in the sight of god
to join together this man
and this woman
in holy matrimony
an honorable estate
instituted by god
in this time of
of mans great innocence
innocence
innocence
no
well
mmm
mother you must eat
it is impolite not to eat
i was just telling mrs
you know what
im about to say sir
why do you keep a carriage
if you never put it out
its just such a shame
to see it standing by
a gentleman on foot
its unusual
unusual
good evening mrs reynolds
at last
mr knightley
you must have had
a shocking walk
not at all sir
its a beautiful evening
you must have found it
very damp and dirty
dirty sir
look at my shoes
not a speck on them
mr  how do you do
i came to wish you joy
joy
oh the wedding
what a terrible day
so how did you all behave
who cried the most
we all behaved charmingly
everybody was in
their best looks
not a tear and hardly
a long face to be seen
bring the screen
a little closer
mr knightley feels a chill
and what of
mr frank churchill
is he every bit as handsome
as his father
promised he would be
he did not come
you see he wished
exceedingly to come
but his aunt and uncle
could not spare him
well i dare say
he might have come if he could
i do not know why
you should say so
if frank churchill had wanted
to attend his fathers wedding
he would have contrived it
he he chose not to come
youve never met
mr frank churchill
we do not know what he is able
or unable to do
there is one thing emma
which a man can always do
if he chooses
and that is his duty
it is frank churchills duty
to pay this attention
to his father
he also has a duty to his aunt
who is unwell
mrs churchill has been unwell
for as long
as she could say so
her nephew is not a doctor
if he had told her simply
and resolutely that he
that he must
attend his fathers wedding
there would have been
no opposition to his going
you are the worst judge
in the world mr knightley
of the difficulties
of dependence
youve always been
your own master
youve no idea what it is
to have tempers to manage
i shall remember that
next time you quarrel with me
there is a new
parlor boarder papa
at mrs goddards school
miss smith
there
distinctly
do you feel it
a chill draft
a chill and sickly draft
shes a natural child
nobody knows her parentage
not even miss smith herself
is that not mysterious
miss taylor would have felt it
the misfortune of your birth
harriet
ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates
there can be no doubt of your
being a gentlemans daughter
you must support your claim
to that station
by everything
within your power
know you the martins
miss woodhouse
of abbey mill farm
i know that they are
tenant farmers
they rent their farm
from mr knightley
they were ever so kind to me
this summer
thank you
when i went away
mrs martin was so very kind
as to send mrs goddard
a beautiful goose
the finest goose mrs goddard
had ever seen she said
the martins are of precisely
the order of people
with whom i feel
i can have nothing to do
a degree or two lower
might interest me
if they were very poor
i might hope to be
useful to them
in some way but
a farmer can need
none of my help
and is therefore as much above
my notice as he is below it
mr robert martin went
three miles one day
to bring me walnuts
because he knew
how fond i was of them
i believe hes very clever
he understands everything
come
after tea we shall call on
my dear mrs weston
we promised we should be
seeing one another every day
it was
a beautiful service mr elton
im not the first
to visit you this morning
you are no less welcome
for being the second
mr elton miss harriet smith
it is my great honor
harriet
you must sit over there
so that you may admire
the view of enscombe
mr frank churchill
is the artist
i have heard it described as
one of the finest houses
in yorkshire
i have heard the same
and mr churchill is
to inherit the entire estate
he is very fortunate
there is such symmetry
between us
we both lost our mothers
when we were very young
and he has his aunt
to care for as i have papa
but how can we admire
a painted beauty
with such loveliness
before us in the flesh
mr elton is
such a goodhumored man
so cheerful and obliging
and gentle
i think very well of mr elton
i do so wonder miss woodhouse
that you should not be
going to be married
so charming as you are
i have none of the usual
inducements of women to marry
fortune i do not want
employment i do not want
consequence i do not want
i believe few married women
are half as much mistress
of their husbands house
as i am of hartfield
you must come again tomorrow
thank you miss woodhouse
thank you
i like to rise
when the sun she rises
early in the morning
i like to hear
them small birds singing
merrily upon their laylum
and hurrah for the life
of a country boy
and to ramble in
the newmown hay
miss woodhouse
which do you prefer
they are practically identical
of course if the dark
gets dirty it would not show
but the light
the dark then
the light is
a good deal prettier
miss woodhouse whats the matter
miss woodhouse
miss woodhouse
how do you do
and you miss smith
i saw you through the window
i saw you through the window
miss woodhouse
i bring happy news
we have had a letter
this very morning
from my niece jane fairfax
i hope that she is well
in normal course she writes
on a tuesday but today was
oh her health
oh miss woodhouse you are
so very kind to inquire
poor jane she was at weymouth
with colonel campbell
and uh
oh where is the letter
oh oh it must not be far off
oh such an unexpected
oh its on the glove stand
it was with the gloves
it was with the gloves
yes at weymouth with colonel campbell
and his wife
and janes dear friend
miss campbell
who is recently married
shes mrs dixon now
and oh dear mr dixon
who is the most charming
young man
rendered to jane
a great service in recent days
they were oh too pretty
that is
yes they were out in a part
oh in a party on the water
and jane by the sudden
whirling around
of something or other
in the sails
would have been dashed
to the sea at once
and actually all but gone
but mr dixon with
the greatest presence of mind
caught hold of her habit
and saved her life
oh to think that poor jane
may have perished
i cannot think of it
without shaking she an orphan
i am very pleased that
miss fairfax was not harmed
how gratified jane will be
to know that she has
such dear devoted friends
heaven forbid that i should
ever bore anybody
half as much about
all the knightleys together
as miss bates does
about jane fairfax
one is sick of the very name
jane fairfax
every letter from her
is read 40 times over
and if she does but knit
a pair of garters
one hears of nothing else
for a whole month
it is robert martin
good boy
miss smith
mr martin
lovely to see you miss smith
goodbye
only think of
our happening to meet him
well miss woodhouse
is he like what you expected
what do you think of him
i had no right to expect much
and indeed
i did not expect much
but i had imagined him
i confess
a degree or two nearer
gentility
to be sure
hes not so genteel
as to a real gentleman
mmhmm
i do hope
mr woodhouse is not ill
oh no
oh papa sees mr perry
every day
i know i disappoint him
awfully
im so seldom indisposed
if he does not invent
an illness for me
i hardly figure in his letters
truly
you are the very picture
of good health miss woodhouse
mrs martin thinks you
the most handsome woman
in all of highbury
you must never
flatter me in front of
mr knightley harriet
he thinks me
vain enough already
i do not think you
personally vain
considering how
very handsome you are
you seem little occupied
with it
your vanity lies
a different way
did i tell you what mr elton
said of you the other day
he called you
loveliness itself
itit seems to me
his manners are rather softer
than they used to be
and i rather wonder
whether he means
to ingratiate himself with you
morning mrs goddard
good morning mr elton
girls
quickly now
these are exquisitely done
miss woodhouse
you have a charming talent
i dare say
there is merit in them
in the least finished
perhaps the most
so mr knightley tells me
and he finds fault
in everything i do
did you ever have
your likeness taken harriet
oh no
what an exquisite possession
a good picture of her would be
it would indeed
it would indeed
let me entreat you
miss woodhouse
now at once
you have given miss smith
all that she requires
she was a beautiful creature
when she came to you
but the attractions
you have added are
infinitely superior
to what she received from
nature
its depressing for me
to have to take care of it you know
no
well quite
take over
mr woodhouse
your daughters gifts
are without compare
bear witness
mm youve made her
too tall emma
uh no
no certainly not too tall
not in the least too tall
mm mm yes
it is very pretty
when it is finished
you must have it framed
allow me
trust me with this commission
miss woodhouse
and i will ride to london
the moment i am asked
it would be my great honor
i cannot have a moments doubt
it is exactly as i planned
hes in love with you
i do not know
what your opinion may be
mrs weston of this great
intimacy between emma
and harriet smith
but i think it a bad thing
how differently we feel
miss smith knows nothing
about herself
and looks upon emma
as knowing everything
her ignorance
is hourly flattery
but educating harriet
will be an inducement
for emma to educate herself
they will read together
emma has been meaning
to read more
ever since she was
12 years old
she never would submit
to anything
requiring industry
and patience
i cannot allow you to be
a judge in this matter
mr knightley
you are so used to live alone
you do not know the value
of a companion
well she always declares
that she will never marry
which of course
means just nothing at all
i should like to see
emma in love
and in some doubt of a return
it would do her good
how firm a foundation
ye saints of the lord
robert
master knightley is here
your faith in
his excellent word
the day is wasting mr martin
come along
what more can he say
than to you he hath said
you who unto jesus
for refuge have fled
im really most obliged
to you sir
id expected to wait
until the spring
always buy out of season
mr martin whenever you can
mr knightley sir
forgive my liberty
but may i be so bold
as to seek your advice
of course
miss woodhouse
you will never guess
what has happened
robert martin
has offered me his hand
he writes as if
he really loves me very much
is it a good letter
or too short
it is a very good letter
so good i think one of his
sisters must have helped him
but what shall i say
dear miss woodhouse
do advise me
oh no no no
the words must be your own
you think i ought
to refuse him
i lay it down
as a general rule harriet
that if a woman doubts whether
she should accept a man or not
she certainly ought
to refuse him
perhaps it is safer
do you think
i had better say no
not for the world
would i advise you either way
you must be the best judge
of your own happiness
i have now
quite determined
and really almost
made up my mind
to
refuse mr martin
refused
then she is a greater simpleton
than i ever believed her
harriet smith
refuse robert martin
i
i hope you are mistaken
i saw her answer
nothing could be clearer
you saw her answer
you wrote her answer
this is your doing
emma you persuaded her
to refuse him
well if i did i should not
feel that i had done wrong
mr martins
a respectable young man
but i cannot admit him
to be harriets equal
no indeed he is her superior
in both sense and situation
emma your infatuation
about that girl blinds you
what are harriet smiths
claims either of
birth nature or education
to any connection
higher than robert martin
she is the natural daughter
of nobody knows whom
there can scarcely be a doubt
that her father is a gentleman
and a gentleman of fortune
probably no settled provision
at all and certainly
no respectable relations
her allowance is very liberal
nothing has been grudged
for her improvement
she is known only as a parlor
boarder at a common school
she is pretty
and she is goodtempered
and that is all
that is all
these are not trivial
recommendations mr knightley
till men do fall in love
with wellinformed minds
instead of handsome faces
a girl with such loveliness
as harriet
has a certainty
of being admired
and sought after
wherever she goes
i am very much mistaken
if your sex in general
would not find these qualities
the highest claims
a woman could possess
upon my word emma
to hear you abusing
the reason you have
is almost enough
to make me think so too
better to be
without sense altogether
than to misapply it as you do
men of sense
do not want silly wives
and more prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience
and disgrace that
they might be involved in
when the mystery of her
parentage came to be revealed
let her marry robert martin
and she is safe
and respectable forever
but if you teach her
to expect to marry greatly
nobody within her reach will
ever be good enough for her
your plans for harriet are
best known only to yourself
but as you make no secret
of your love of matchmaking
it is fair to suppose
the plans you have
and as a friend
i shall just hint to you
that if elton is
the man that i think
it will be your labor in vain
he knows that he is
a very handsome young man
andand a great favorite
wherever he goes
but from his general
way of talking
when there are
only men present
im convinced that he does not
mean to throw himself away
im very much obliged to you
for opening my eyes
mr knightley
but know that i am done with
matchmaking for the present
i only want to keep harriet
for myself
its so beautiful
you certainly spared
no expense
hark hark what news
the angels bring
glad tidings of
glad tidings of
me to do all
the disciplinary action to the children
you must
it is utterly unfair
you it is your responsibility
and your responsibility to
teach the baby to drink milk
it is not only
my responsiility
without spilling it
all over my favorite trousers
that is the nurses
responsibility not
emma theyre here
that was unendurable
husband comport yourself
papa
isabella
emma
i shall always
be sorry you went to the sea
this autumn
instead of coming here
but why should you
be sorry sir
it did us a great deal of good
on the contrary mr john
knightley looks far from well
southend was
strenuously recommended
by our physician sir
sea air and sea bathing
the sea is rarely of use
to anybody
it nearly killed me once
come
i must beg you
not to speak of the sea
makes me miserable
and envious
i who have never seen it
mr wingfield specified
that southend
was the best place to go
for the family
perhaps you
should change your physician
he was
recommended by my husband
cornwall
might have been forgivable
but southend
let us be friends
aw
tell your aunt little emma
that she was very wrong
and she ought to set you
a better example
oh
wh
what is the matter is there fever
uh
uh
where is the nurse
give her to me
is she feverish
i do not know
ii do not know
whwhere is the nurse
send for perry
do not send for perry
send for perry
as death follows life
mm
yes
as far as
good intentions went um
we were both in the right
i must admit i have not yet
been proved wrong
mr knightley
was mr martin
very disappointed
a man cannot be more so
miss woodhouse is coming
miss woodhouse
harriet
miss woodhouse
youre so uh disheveled
im always ill at christmas
get back in bed at once
youll miss the party
at randalls
mr elton will be there
and frank churchill
is expected at last
and mr eltons sermon
a sermon on christmas day
i transcribe them every sunday
i will transcribe it for you
you are so kind to me
miss woodhouse
welcome
welcome my friends
welcome
mr elton
hows poor miss smith
oh no better im afraid
aw such a sad loss
to our party today
miss smith has sent
her apologies
she will be missed
every moment
ooh
how are the children
multiplying
my only moments rest
is in the office
frank has been detained
at enscombe im sorry to say
oh
i had a letter from him
just this morning
mr churchill is
to inherit the entire estate
i have heard it described
as one of the finest houses
in yorkshire
going out in dismal weather
to return probably in worse
four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing
but to convey five idle
another fine
flourishing letter
full of professions
and falsehoods
your feelings are singular
his letters seem to
satisfy everybody else
i suspect they do not
satisfy mrs weston
were she a person
of consequence herself
he would have come by now
i daresay
you seem determined
to think ill of him
i should be as ready
to acknowledge his merits
as any other man but
i hear of none
except that he is well grown
and goodlooking
well if he has nothing else
to recommend him
he shall be a treasure
at highbury
we do not often look
upon fine young men
cannot ask for all the virtues
into the bargain
you will excuse my being
so much overpowered
we are both prejudiced
you against i for him
and we shall have
no chance of agreeing
until he is really here
prejudiced
im not prejudiced
yes but i am
very much and without at all
being ashamed of it
my love for mr and mrs weston
gives me a decided prejudice
in his favor
charming miss woodhouse
mr weston
mrs churchill
rules at enscombe
eveverything
gives way to her
she has decreed that if frank
does not marry
a lady of some fortune
then he will be entirely
cut out from her will
there is jealousy
she is jealous even
of his regard for his father
jealousy
but she is so very fond
of her nephew
he is her particular favorite
dear emma
do not attempt
with your good nature
to understand a bad one
you must let it go its own way
uh i have heard it described
as one of the finest houses
in yorksh
mm what seasonable weather
were having
i dare say we shall
have snow tonight
snow tonight
when did it commence
we shall call
for the carriage right away
it has hardly begun
barely an inch
but it is falling fast
it was snowing
when your mother died
oh papa i know
we shall get you home
well what is to be done emma
there is room for us all
we have accommodation
for all of you
absolutely
the horses are in
good condition
i do admire
your resolution sir
venturing out
in such weather
theres nothing we can do
it is snowing
mrs weston the party
we should go at once
whwhere is the carriage
where is james
of course fortunately we do
have more than one carriage
so if one is blown over
in the wind
husband please
happy christmas
i am so very sorry
we must leave
i think we shall be very glad
thatthat frank
did not come at christmas
look to your vinaigrette papa
mr knightley you must
move your carriage
my father is not well
take it
it is first
and will be the fastest
you will catch your death
your husband is not
is not strong
ill ride with you then
evidently i may not survive
oh
miss woodhouse
mr elton
i must avail myself
of this precious opportunity
to declare sentiments
which must be
already well known
mr elton please
youve drunk too much wine
my ardent attachment
mr elton
you forget yourself
i am ready to die
if you refuse me
you take me for my friend
any message you have
to miss smith
i shall be happy to deliver
for miss smith
a message for miss smith
i never thought of miss smith
in the whole course
of my existence
never paid her any attentions
but as your friend
never cared whether
she were dead or alive
but as your friend
oh miss woodhouse
who can think of miss smith
when miss woodhouse is near
everything i have said or done
for many weeks
has been with the sole view
of making my adoration
to yourself
charming miss woodhouse
allow me
to interpret this
interesting silence
it confesses you have
long understood me
no sir
it confesses no such thing
nothing could be farther
from my wishes
your pursuit of harriet
has given me great pleasure
and ive been very earnestly
wishing your success
miss smith is
a very good sort of girl
and no doubt there are men
who might not object
everybody has their level
madam my visits to hartfield
have been for yourself only
and the encouragement
i received
encouragement
i give you encouragement
you are entirely mistaken sir
i have no thoughts
of matrimony at present
driver stop the carriage
mr elton please
driver stop the carriage
the water is wide
i cannot get oer
and neither have i
wings to fly
give me a boat
that will carry two
and both shall row
my love and i
oh down in the meadows
the other day
agathering flowers
both fine and gay
agathering flowers
both red and blue
i little thought
what love can do
miss woodhouse
miss woodhouse
he never loved me
he loves you
he sought to aggrandize
and enrich himself
yes
harriet
you might never have thought
of him but for me
i assured you
of his attachments
i contrived his visits
to hartfield
i do not blame you
miss woodhouse
i could never have
deserved him
and none but so partial
and kind a friend as you
could even have
thought it possible
its silly really
harriet
i cannot see it
without thinking of him
burn the frame if you like
but you must keep the likeness
then i will take it
i will take it
and i will treasure it
as a picture of my friend
goodbye papa
now are we going
to be quiet this carriage ride
sit next to your sister
why are you so pale
where is the baby
where is the baby
where is the baby
henry needs his mormor
we must retrieve
henrys mormor
i will not stop
this carriage for a mormor
goodbye isabella
goodbye
papa
i wish she would not leave
you must never leave me emma
oh papa
you know i never could
he cannot stay away forever
the curate cannot give
the sermon forever
no one preaches
as mr elton does
hear this extract
miss woodhouse
hear this
enough about mr elton
miss woodhouse
miss smith
such news
my niece jane fairfax
miss woodhouse
jane fairfax she has
jane has surprised us
she is here
oh do come along
we must have tea
it is too thrilling
she caught
a bad cold poor thing
so long ago
as the seventh of november
she has not been well since
and her kind friends
the campbells
thought shed better come home
and try an air that always
agrees with her
i hope that
your father is well
very well i thank you
she is very sorry to be parted
from her dear friends
the campbells
and mrs dixon
and oh mr dixon
the most amiable young man
who did her
so great a service
at weymouth in october
i still shudder to think
what might have
if not for mr dixon
with the waves and the water
and the sails
oh
such a charming man
oh dear
is this not pleasant
she plans to stay three months
we must have you all
to hartfield
oh
oh mother do you hear
miss woodhouse has invited us
to hartfield
mother
you must sample the tart
no i do i do
i do not advise the custard
what do you say
to half a glass of wine
in a tumbler of water
naturally
we shall be seeing frank
any day now
i have
i have no doubt of it
oh now jane
mr frank churchill
is a man much talked about
in highbury
is he not miss woodhouse
we are all very eager
to meet him
he was at weymouth
when jane was there
we are very little acquainted
frank churchill
was at weymouth
in october
that was the month
of his fathers wedding
but you must describe him
is he handsome
is he agreeable
i believe he is
generally thought so
how well prepared
this custard is
i must ask your cook
for the method
tis the last
rose of summer
left blooming alone
all her lovely companions
are faded and gone
no flower of her kindred
no rosebud is nigh
to reflect back her blushes
and give sigh for sigh
oh who would inhabit
this bleak world alone
miss fairfax
oh what a pity
you did not bring your music
i hope i can
recollect the tune
nobody in the world
plays like you
im glad you invited
miss fairfax to play
having no instrument
at her grandmothers
it must be a real indulgence
i am glad you approve
but i hope i am not
often deficient
in what is due
to my guests at hartfield
no
you are not often deficient
you make it very plain
you do not like miss fairfax
everybody supposes we must be
so fond of each other
because we are the same age
ever since i can remember
i have been told i can find
no better companion
than jane fairfax
she who is so accomplished
and so superior
she is certainly accomplished
perhaps the accomplished
young woman
you wish to be thought
yourself
three months of doing
more than i wish
and less than i ought
that indifferent
imperturbable statue
i must go
harriet
oh
we have missed you
our mothers been
asking for you
will you come
and visit us again
of course
good day miss martin
miss catherine martin
mr martin
miss smith
th the near way is flooded
you would do better
going by mr coles stables
the ground is higher there
you behaved extremely well
and it is over
as a first meeting
it cannot occur again
you must stay no longer
than a quarter of an hour
and allow no dangerous
reminiscences
there must be
no recurrence to the past
i seek the village
of highbury sir
over the bridge
left at the crown
youll see the steeple
thank you
very much obliged
here we are
my dear
mrs weston
my son mr frank churchill
miss emma woodhouse
miss woodhouse
he uh hes caught us
quite by surprise
indeed he has
there are not many houses
in which i would
presume on so far sir but
in coming home i felt
i might take the liberty
we uh we had a plan
to walk to the village emma
will you join us
i would be delighted
splendid
right
i believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in jane fairfax
did you meet often at weymouth
pray let us go in here
that i may prove myself to be
a true citizen of highbury
i must buy something at fords
and i beg your pardon
miss woodhouse
you were speaking to me
i merely asked
whether you had known
much of miss fairfax
and her party at weymouth
and now that i understand
the question
i must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one
well it is always
the ladys right
to decide on the degree
of acquaintance
you answer as discreetly
as she would herself
though her account leaves
so much to be guessed
that i really think
you may say what you like
of your acquaintance with her
i only know what is
generally known
that she is poor
and of no consequence
heres where you have
your balls i suppose
every fortnight through the winter
i am afraid highbury may yet
disappoint you mr churchill
we have not society enough
for dancing
ah but an inn of this size
must have a ballroom
and where there is a ballroom
there can be a ball
we cannot do without dancing
instances have been known
of young people
passing many many months
successfully
without any ball
of any description
and no injury either to body
or to mind but when
when the felicities of
rapid motion have been felt
it must be
a very heavy heart
that does not ask for more
it is very dirty inside
oh my dear my dear
you are too particular
by candlelight itll be
as clean as randalls
we must have a ball
yes and when we do
may i hope for the honor
of your hand
for the first two dances
the coles are to hold a
supper party in franks honor
and perhaps therell be
dancing there
so emma woodhouse
deigned to accept
an invitation
from the merchant mr cole
mr churchill will soon
return to yorkshire
we must make the most of every
opportunity until he does
we must
hes in highbury
only two weeks
and yet he spent a whole day
going to london
just to get his hair cut
16 miles twice over
hes a trifling silly fop
indeed
mr cole
such grand estates you have
in common gentlemen
donwell abbey
enscombe
soon to inherit of course
soon to inherit enscombe
not too soon
i trust your uncle churchill
is in good health
uh excellent health
and have you heard
the choicest piece of gossip
that has set all the tongues
of the village aflame
a pianoforte very elegant
delivered to miss fairfax
this very morning
with no return address
i never saw so fine
an instrument
a pianoforte very elegant
and with no return address
no return address
jane herself
is quite at a loss
quite bewildered to think
who could have sent it
bewildered indeed
why do you smile
nay why do you
i suppose i smile for pleasure
a pianoforte is
a very handsome present
i rather wonder
it was never made before
perhaps miss fairfax
has never been
staying here so long before
or that colonel campbell
did not
give her use
of his own instrument
which must now be shut up
in london untouched by anybody
she has done her hair
in so odd a way
i never saw anything like it
must be a fancy of her own
i see nobody else
looking like her
if colonel campbell
is not the giver
who can be
mrs dixon
as a token of her
her friendship perhaps
what say you to mr dixon
mr dixon
he saved her life
did you hear of it
a water party
and by some accident
she was falling overboard
he caught her
huh
ladies and gentlemen
a duet
what do you say to this emma
i have made a match between
mr knightley and jane fairfax
mr knightley and jane fairfax
this pianofortes
been sent to her by somebody
and she has always been
a favorite with him
tonight he sent his carriage
for her as a courtesy
and walked himself
was that not gallant
mr weston
drink to me only
with thine eyes
and i will pledge with mine
or leave a kiss
within the cup
and ill not ask for wine
the thirst that from
the soul doth rise
doth ask a drink divine
but might i
of loves nectar sip
i would not change
for thine
enter not into judgment
with thy servant o lord
for in thy sight
shall no man living
be justified
hes married
it cannot be
a long acquaintance
hes only been gone six weeks
my wife mrs augusta elton
this house is very like
my brother mr sucklings seat
at maple grove
very like
im quite struck by
the likeness
is it not astonishingly like
dear husband
very like
i really could almost
fancy myself at maple grove
the staircase as i came in
i observed how very like
the staircase is
placed in exactly the same part
of the house
i assure you miss woodhouse
it is very delightful to me
to be reminded of a place
i am so extremely partial to
as maple grove
a most impressive residence
whenever you are transplanted
like me miss woodhouse
you will understand
how very delightful it is
to meet with anything at all
that reminds one
of what one has left behind
we have been calling
at randalls
what pleasant people
the westons seem to be
and who should call in
while we were there
knightley
knightley himself
of course as so particular
a friend of mr es
i had a great curiosity
to meet him
my friend knightley
had been so often mentioned
that i really was
impatient to see him
and i must do
my cara sposo the justice
to say that he need not be
at all ashamed of his friend
knightley
i could not have believed it
knightley
never met him before
in her life
and calls him knightley
and to discover
that he is a gentleman
upstart vulgar being
with her mr e
and her cara sposo
emma
mr weston
miss smith
the churchills
have settled at richmond
here
frank is returning
we shall have our ball
no no
you are frank churchill
oh
of course
you dance so beautifully
oh
oh this is brilliant indeed
this is admirable
excellently contrived
upon my word
nothing wanting
oh miss woodhouse
you must really have had
aladdins lamp
this is meeting
quite in fairyland
such a transformation
now where shall we sit
where shall we sit
oh now anywhere where jane
is not in a draft
how do you like my gown
oh
miss bates oh mr elton
i do not know whether
it is not overtrimmed
i have the greatest dislike to
the idea of being overtrimmed
quite a horror of finery
of course i must put on
a few ornaments now
because it is expected
a bride you know
must appear like a bride
but my natural taste
is all for simplicity
how do you like janes hair
she did it all herself
too wonderful
no hairdresser
from london i think
could do a finer style
emma
it has just occurred to us
that mrs elton will expect
to be asked to begin the ball
and she will surely think
frank ought to ask her
frank cannot break
his promise to you
hes promised you
the first two dances
heres the plan
i will ask mrs elton
the ball is in franks honor
but its in my design
i shall ask her
you must submit
to stand second
a bride must be first
in company
it is almost enough
to make me think of marrying
oh
must i go first
i really am ashamed
to always be
leading the way
gentlemen
you have been much missed
in highbury
have i
how is your aunt
most reluctant to release me
do you not dance mr elton
most readily mrs weston
if you will dance with me
oh
ah
well perhaps
there is a young lady
disengaged
whom i should be very glad
to see dancing miss smith
miss smith
if i were not
an old married man
but my dancing days are over
mrs weston
you will excuse me
will you dance miss smith
thank you
for your kindness to harriet
he was unpardonably rude
and he aimed at wounding
more than harriet
i was completely mistaken
in mr elton
there is a littleness about him
which you discovered
and i did not
you would have chosen
for him better
than he has chosen for himself
harriet smith has some
firstrate qualities
which mrs elton
is totally without
she does you credit emma
as you do her
ah
oh miss woodhouse
come
set your companions an example
theyre all lazy
theyre all asleep
we must dance another set
i am ready
whenever i am wanted
with whom will you dance
with you
if you will ask me
you have shown
that you can dance
and we are not really so much
brother and sister
as to make it improper
no indeed
stop it
stop embarrassing yourself
i am not embarrassing myself
oh
mr churchill harriet
oh
what has happened
she was set upon by some
gypsies as she was coming home
when she attempted escape
she fell
she had a cramp
from too much dancing
well is she hurt
i didnt see
i arrived moments after
and brought her here
i could think of
no other place
to the drawing room
it was on account
of the scissors
emma and mr knightley
the scissors
oh
i
borrowed a pair of scissors
from miss bates
i was halfway home
when i made the recollection
and so doubled back
whew
what is your purpose here
um mymy carriage
my uh my horse
threw a shoe
you took
your carriage to the ball
yes
what might have become of me
miss woodhouse
if not for the scissors
we must send for perry
miss woodhouse
i believe i am in love again
mrs goddard
should be assured of her safety
yes and i shall
rouse my father
we ought to let them know
that there are gypsies
in the neighborhood
yes let us go at once
oh miss woodhouse
say nothing more
do not go
mr churchill
please
stay
what is the matter
what has happened
what is she
is she is she alive
harriet is unharmed papa
we have mr churchill to thank
please stay
mr knightley
can sound the alarm
we will both go
why are we alarmed
we have sent for perry papa
hes your superior
no doubt but
but wonderful things
have taken place
there have been matches
of greater disparity
believe me i have not
the presumption to suppose
no but the service
he rendered you
service
the very recollection of it
and all that i felt
his coming to me
his noble look
such a change in one moment
from misery to
to perfect happiness
i was very wrong before
i will be cautious now
i am determined against
any interference
what is this i hear dear jane
about your going
to the post office
in the rain last week
why you sad girl
why would you do such a thing
i will not allow you
to do such a thing again
i shall speak to mr e
the man who fetches
our letters
one of our men
i forget his name
shall inquire for yours too
do you suppose mr knightley
might extend us all
an invitation to the abbey
miss woodhouse
i love to explore great houses
and i fear i have
long exhausted highbury
im afraid
mr knightleys concerns
are all for his tenants
and none for his house
mrs elton
his ballrooms and picture
galleries are quite shut up
i should be very glad
to open donwell
for your exploration
mrs elton
the welcome is long overdue
mm
i should like that
of all things
name your day and i will come
i cannot
name a day until i have spoken
to some others whom i would
wish to form the party
oh leave that to me
it is my party
i will invite your guests
i hope you will bring elton
but i will not trouble you
to give any other invitations
oh
oh well now you are
looking very sly
but consider
you need not be afraid
of delegating power to me
married women you know
may be safely authorized
there is but one
married woman in all the world
whom i can ever allow
to invite what guests
she pleases to donwell
mrs weston i suppose
no mrs knightley
until she is in being i will
manage such matters myself
oh my heavens
do you not feel transported
i can hardly believe
that we remain in england
and i was to accompany him
but the night before his going
i was struck down by a fever
and so i did not go
please excuse me
of course
there is an excellent prospect
from the south window
miss smith
may i escort you
jane of course
knows a great deal
more of the world than i
she has been to ireland
will you
be so kind when i am missed
to say that i am gone home
if you wish it
but youre not going to walk
back to highbury alone
are you unwell
miss woodhouse
we all know at times what it is
to be wearied in spirits
mine i confess are exhausted
have i missed the party
not at all
were exploring the house
i was detained by my aunt
a nervous seizure
which lasted some hours
had i known how hot a ride
i should have
i believe i should not
have come at all
you will soon
be cooler if you sit down
some cold beer perhaps
as soon as my aunt gets well
again i shall go abroad
im tired of doing nothing
i want a change
im serious miss woodhouse
whatever your penetrating eyes
may fancy
im sick of england
you are sick of prosperity
and indulgence
cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself
and be contented to stay
you are quite mistaken
i do not look upon myself
as either prosperous
or indulged
were going to box hill
tomorrow
it is not the grand tour
but it will be something
for a young man
so much in want of change
well if you wish me to stay
and join the party
i will
how much i am obliged to you
for telling me to come today
i had quite determined
to go away again
yes you were very cross
our companions
are excessively stupid
what shall we do to rouse them
hmm any nonsense will serve
ladies and gentlemen
i am ordered by miss woodhouse
to say that
she desires to know
what youre all thinking of
dear what we are thinking of
is miss woodhouse sure
that she would like to know
what we are all thinking of
no no
upon no account in the world
it is the very last thing
i would stand the brunt of
just now
it is the sort of thing
which i should not
have thought myself privileged
to inquire into as
chaperon of the party
very true my love
very true
but some ladies
will say anything
best to pass it off as a joke
everybody knows
what is due to you
they are
most of them affronted
i will attack them
with more address
ladies and gentlemen
i am ordered by miss woodhouse
to say that
she waives her right
of knowing what
you may be thinking of
and only requires something
entertaining from each of you
she demands either
one thing very clever
or two things moderately clever
or three things
very dull indeed
and she engages
to laugh heartily at them all
oh vvery well then
i need not be uneasy
three things
very dull indeed
that will do just for me
i shall be sure to say
three dull things
as soon as i open my mouth
ah maam but there is
the difficulty
when have you ever
stopped at three
oh
no i see what sheshe means
i shall try to hold my tongue
ii like this plan
uh agreed agreed
agreed agreed
uh i shall do my best
um
im making a conundrum
how will a conundrum reckon
low i am afraid sir
but we shall uh
be indulgent
mr knightley i must have
made myself very disagreeable
or she would not have said
such a thing to an old friend
i cannot think
what i have done
what two letters
of the alphabet are there
that express perfection
what two letters
express perfection
i im sure i do not know
well i shall tell you
m and a emma
do you understand
yes
mr weston has shown us how
to play this game
but also how to end it
for who can improve
upon perfection
i protest i must be excused
i do not pretend to be a wit
i really must be allowed
to judge when to speak
and when to hold my tongue
shall we walk augusta
most willingly
i am very tired of exploring
so long on one spot
shall we join
mrs elton maam
if you please my dear
with all my heart
i am quite ready
how could you be
so unfeeling to miss bates
it was not so very bad
how could you be so insolent
to a woman of her character
andandand age
andand situation
i dare say she did not
understand me
i assure you she did
she felt your full meaning
she has talked of it since
i know there is not a better
creature in the world
i wish you could have heard
how she talked of it
wwith what candor
andand generosity
you must allow that what is
good and what is ridiculous
are most unfortunately
blended in her
they are blended in her
i acknowledge
and were she
a woman of fortune
i would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner
but she is poor
she has sunk from the comfort
she was born to
and if she lived to an old age
she will probably sink more
it is too hot and
she has seen you grow up
from when her notice of you was an honor
and i am tired
to have you now
in thoughtless spirits
and the pride of the moment
laugh at her
andand humble her
and before her niece
and before others many of whom
are entirely guided
by your treatment of her
it was badly done indeed
go
i have been
unpardonably vain
and insufferably arrogant
i have been inconsiderate
and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling and
im afraid jane
is not very well
dreadful headache
writing all morning
such long letters
i said my dear
you shall blind yourself
im so very sorry miss bates
please give jane
my good wishes
you were kept waiting
at the door
i was quite ashamed
no you you see
there was a little bustle
for it so happened
we did not hear the knock
and until you were
on the stairs
we did not know
that anybody was coming
so very kind
but you are always kind
miss woodhouse
ah emma
how did you find them
emma has been to call on
mrs and miss bates
mr knightley
she is always
so attentive to them
i
i regret i cannot stay sir
we will miss you
in the evening
goodbye emma
what has happened
mrs churchill is dead
dead
yes wewe always thought
her illness
was invented but
emma
frank was here
this very morning
on the most
extraordinary errand
it is impossible
to express our surprise
frank and jane fairfax
are engaged
what
theres been a solemn
engagement between them
ever since october
formed at weymouth and kept
a secret from everybody
what um
engaged
before either of them
came to highbury
secretly engaged
of course
had his aunt heard of it
she would have
cut him off but
it has hurt me emma
very much
it has hurt his father equally
he sent the pianoforte
he has confessed it
emma you must know
it was our darling wish
oh no no
not for me
im so very sorry harriet
but why should you condole me
you do not think i care about
mr frank churchill
there was a time
and not very distant either
when you gave me reason
to believe
that you did care about him
him
never
dear miss woodhouse
how could you so mistake me
harriet whwhat do you mean
i should not have
thought it possible
that you could have
misunderstood me
but you told me that
greater things had happened
that there had been matches
of greater disparity
those were your very words
miss woodhouse
harriet
let us understand
each other now
without possibility
of further mistake
are you speaking
of mr knightley
of course
but
i thought you knew
but the service
mr churchill rendered you
iin protecting you
from the gypsies
oh no
it was not the gypsies no
i was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance
of mr knightleys coming
and asking me to dance
when mr elton
would not stand up with me
good god
and have you any idea
of mr knightleys
returning your affection
i must say that i have
he has shown me sweetness
and kindness
and at donwell he took
great pains to describe to me
some particulars of the
management of his tenant farms
we were interrupted
but before we were
he seemed almost
to be asking me
if my affections were engaged
yes but is it possible
that he might have been
alluding to mr martin
that he might have had
mr martins interest in view
you think of mr knightley
for yourself
harriet
ii do not flatter myself
with any idea
of his attachment to me
harriet
i should have considered it
too great a presumption
even to think of him
but for you
harriet
i know that he is the last man
who would intentionally give
any woman the idea
of his feeling more for her
than he does so
if you believe
he loves you
i refused mr martin
because of you
because
harriet
emma
mr knightley
have you heard the news
miss fairfax
and frank churchill
i did not see it
but then i seem to have been
doomed to blindness
time my dearest emma
time will heal the wound
he will soon be gone
you will forget him
you are very kind
but you are mistaken
my blindness
to what was going on
led me to act in a way that
i must always be ashamed of
but i have no other regret
with respect to
mr churchill
he is a disgrace
to the name of man
and is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman
jane jane
youll be a miserable creature
everything turns out
for his good
hishis aunt is in the way
his aunt dies
he uses everybody ill
andandand theyre delighted
to forgive him
he is a fortunate man indeed
you speak as if you envied him
and i do envy him
emma
in one respect
he is the object of my envy
you will not ask me why
you are youyou are
you are determined i see
to have no curiosity
you are wise
but i cannot be wise
i must tell you emma
what you will not ask
though i may wish it unsaid
the next moment
oh then do not speak it
if you wish to speak to me
as a friend
or to ask my opinion
as a friend
i will hear whatever you like
as a friend emma that
i fear is a word
tell me emma
have i no chance
of ever succeeding
my dearest emma
for dearest you will always be
my dearest most beloved emma
tell me at once
i cannot make speeches
if i
if i if i loved you less
then i might be able
to talk about it more
but yyyouyou
you know what i am
i have i have lectured you
and ive
ive blamed you and
and you have borne it
as no other woman in england
could have borne it
god knows i have been
a very indifferent lover
but you understand me
youyou understand my feelings
will you marry me
oh
emma
oh
emma
oh
emma
oh
emma
uh no i
emma
oh
no i
i
ii cannot
why not
harriet
harriet wh
shes in love with you
and she believes that you may love her too
and and you danced with her
oh oh
and shown her kindness
and took notice of her
at donwell
and spoke of farming and
and seemed on the verge
of asking
if her affections were engaged
to robert martin
to robert martin
she told you this
i cannot break her heart again
i shall i shall
call on robert martin
this very evening
i shall urge him
to put his suit
to miss smith a second time
he still loves her
im certain that he does
he need only ask again
notnot by letter
but in person
no
no i must do it
i must go
mr martin
i have a confession to make
i have caused you
great suffering
as i have also caused
the suffering of my friend
my dearest friend
how firm a foundation
ye saints of the lord
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word
what more can he say
than to you he hath said
you who unto jesus
for refuge have fled
harriet
mr robert martin
has offered me his hand
i have accepted
then he is the most fortunate
man of my acquaintance
harriet i
there is something else
i have had a letter
from my father
now that i have come of age
he has revealed himself
he is a tradesman
in bristol
he makes galoshes
he comes to highbury next week
on purpose to meet with me
then i hope you will
bring him to hartfield
as i was awalkin

and the nightingales play
and there did i spy
a beautiful maiden
as i was awalkin

so early this morn
she said im going down
to visit my neighbors
im going down to warwick
the place i was born

in your sweet company
then she turned her head
and smiling all at me
saying
you may come with me

mr knightley
about the knees
ii cannot say that i do sir
ah

the screen bartholomew
charles make haste
no not that this one
no not that one this one
how could i ever leave him

and live constantly with my
father in no house of your own
yeah
uh hhow
is it now mr knightley

dearly beloved friends

in the sight of god
to join together this man
