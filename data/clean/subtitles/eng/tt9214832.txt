the next 
how am i to bear it
when you are gone 
i am going only
half a mile  emma 
but great is
the difference between
a mrs  weston half a mile away
and a miss taylor in the house 
dear emma 
you have been a friend
and companion
such as few possess 
a governess in office  but   
   little short of a mother
in affection 
i wish you every happiness
on your wedding day 
poor miss taylor 
it s a pity mr  weston
ever thought of her 
papa  mr  weston is
such a good humored 
pleasant  excellent man 
he thoroughly deserves
a good wife 
and you would not have had
miss taylor
live with us forever
when she might have had
  a house of her own 
   a house of her own  
where is the advantage
of a house of her own 
this is   
three times as large 
it s entirely unnecessary 
poor miss taylor 
poor isabella 
my sister married
seven years ago  papa 
you must be
reconciled to it by now 
that was a terrible day 
it shall always be
a matter of great joy to me
that i made the match myself 
everyone said mr  weston
would never marry again 
but i did not believe it 
emma  you should not make
matches or foretell things 
whatever you say
always comes to pass 
you must not make any more 
i promise to make none
for myself  papa 
but i must indeed
for other people 
it is the greatest amusement
in the world 
and after such success 
you know 
miss bates  mrs  bates 
miss gilbert  mrs  cox 
mr  woodhouse  sir 
miss woodhouse 
  mr  cole  mrs  cole 
  good morning 
m miss woodhou   
m miss woodhouse 
morning 
is this not the most happy   
happy  the the most fortunate 
this morning  i could not get
my bonnet on for trembling 
hmm 
surrounded by blessings 
wanting for nothing 
i am trembling again 
it is too joyful 
what is it  emma 
i have a fancy
that mr  weston s son
  may surprise us 
  frank weston 
he s frank churchill now  papa 
he s his uncle s heir 
when he came of age 
he took his uncle s name 
i so long to meet him 
but how do you know
he might surprise us 
it is his father s wedding day 
mr  weston speaks of him
so highly 
i cannot doubt
that he will come 
poor miss taylor 
dearly beloved friends 
we gather here
in the sight of god
to join together this man
and this woman
in holy matrimony 
an honorable estate
instituted by god
in this time of   
of man s great inno cence 
 inno cence  
innocence 
no 
well   
mmm 
mother  you must eat 
it is impolite not to eat 
i was just telling mrs    
you know what
i m about to say  sir 
 why do you keep a carriage
if you never put it out  
it s just such a shame
to see it standing by 
a gentleman on foot  
  it s unusual 
  unusual 
good evening  mrs  reynolds 
at last 
mr  knightley 
you must have had
a shocking walk 
not at all  sir 
it s a beautiful evening 
you must have found it
very damp and dirty 
dirty  sir 
look at my shoes 
not a speck on them 
mr    how do you do 
i came to wish you joy 
joy 
oh  the wedding 
what a terrible day 
so  how did you all behave 
who cried the most 
we all behaved charmingly 
everybody was in
their best looks 
not a tear  and hardly
a long face to be seen 
bring the screen
a little closer 
mr  knightley feels a chill 
and what of
mr  frank churchill 
is he every bit as handsome
as his father
promised he would be 
he did not come 
you see  he wished
exceedingly to come 
but his aunt and uncle
could not spare him 
well  i dare say
he might have come if he could 
i do not know why
you should say so 
if frank churchill had wanted
to attend his father s wedding 
he would have contrived it 
he    he chose not to come 
you ve never met
mr  frank churchill 
we do not know what he is able
or unable to do 
there is one thing  emma 
which a man can always do
if he chooses 
and that is his duty 
it is frank churchill s duty
to pay this attention
to his father 
he also has a duty to his aunt 
who is unwell 
mrs  churchill has been unwell
for as long
as she could say so 
her nephew is not a doctor 
if he had told her simply
and resolutely that he   
   that he must
attend his father s wedding 
there would have been
no opposition to his going 
you are the worst judge
in the world  mr  knightley 
of the difficulties
of dependence 
you ve always been
your own master 
you ve no idea what it is
to have tempers to manage 
i shall remember that
next time you quarrel with me 
there is a new
parlor boarder  papa 
at mrs  goddard s school 
  miss smith 
  there 
distinctly 
do you feel it 
a chill draft 
a chill and sickly draft 
she s a natural child 
nobody knows her parentage 
not even miss smith herself 
is that not mysterious 
miss taylor would have felt it 
the misfortune of your birth 
harriet 
ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates 
there can be no doubt of your
being a gentleman s daughter 
you must support your claim
to that station
by everything
within your power 
know you the martins 
miss woodhouse 
of abbey mill farm 
i know that they are
tenant farmers 
they rent their farm
from mr  knightley 
they were ever so kind to me
this summer 
thank you 
when i went away 
mrs  martin was so very kind
as to send mrs  goddard
a beautiful goose 
the finest goose mrs  goddard
had ever seen  she said 
the martins are of precisely
the order of people
with whom i feel
i can have nothing to do 
a degree or two lower
might interest me 
if they were very poor 
i might hope to be
useful to them
in some way  but   
a farmer can need
none of my help
and is therefore as much above
my notice as he is below it 
mr  robert martin went
three miles one day
to bring me walnuts
because he knew
how fond i was of them 
i believe he s very clever 
he understands everything 
come 
after tea  we shall call on
my dear mrs  weston 
we promised we should be
seeing one another every day 
it was
a beautiful service  mr  elton 
i m not the first
to visit you this morning 
you are no less welcome
for being the second 
mr  elton  miss harriet smith 
it is my great honor 
harriet 
you must sit over there
so that you may admire
the view of enscombe 
mr  frank churchill
is the artist 
i have heard it described as
one of the finest houses
in yorkshire 
i have heard the same 
and mr  churchill is
to inherit the entire estate 
he is very fortunate 
there is such symmetry
between us 
we both lost our mothers
when we were very young 
and he has his aunt
to care for  as i have papa 
but how can we admire
a painted beauty
with such    loveliness
before us in the flesh 
mr  elton is
such a good humored man 
so cheerful and obliging 
and gentle 
i think very well of mr  elton 
i do so wonder  miss woodhouse 
that you should not be
going to be married 
so charming as you are 
i have none of the usual
inducements of women to marry 
fortune i do not want 
employment i do not want 
consequence i do not want 
i believe few married women
are half as much mistress
of their husband s house
as i am of hartfield 
you must come again tomorrow 
thank you  miss woodhouse 
thank you 
  i like to rise
when the sun she rises  
  early in the morning  
  i like to hear
them small birds singing  
  merrily upon their laylum  
  and hurrah for the life
of a country boy  
  and to ramble in
the new mown hay   
miss woodhouse 
which do you prefer 
they are practically identical 
of course  if the dark
gets dirty  it would not show 
  but the light   
  the dark  then 
the light is
a good deal prettier 
miss woodhouse  what s the matter 
miss woodhouse 
miss woodhouse 
how do you do 
and you  miss smith 
i saw you through the window 
i saw you through the window 
miss woodhouse 
i bring happy news 
we have had a letter
this very morning
from my niece  jane fairfax 
i hope that she is well 
in normal course  she writes
on a tuesday  but today was   
oh  her health 
oh  miss woodhouse  you are
so very kind to inquire 
poor jane  she was at weymouth
with colonel campbell
and  uh   
oh  where is the letter 
oh  oh  it must not be far off 
oh  such an unexpected   
oh  it s on the glove stand 
it was with the gloves 
it was with the gloves 
yes  at weymouth with colonel campbell
and his wife
and jane s dear friend 
miss campbell 
who is recently married 
she s mrs  dixon now 
and  oh  dear  mr  dixon 
who is the most charming
young man 
rendered to jane
a great service in recent days 
they were    oh  too pretty 
that is   
yes  they were out in a part   
oh  in a party on the water 
and jane  by the sudden
whirling around
of something or other
in the sails 
would have been dashed
to the sea at once   
   and actually all but gone 
but mr  dixon  with
the greatest presence of mind 
caught hold of her habit
and saved her life 
oh  to think that poor jane
may have perished 
i cannot think of it
without shaking  she an orphan 
i am very pleased that
miss fairfax was not harmed 
how gratified jane will be
to know that she has
such dear  devoted friends 
heaven forbid that i should
ever bore anybody
half as much about
all the knightleys together
as miss bates does
about jane fairfax 
one is sick of the very name
 jane fairfax  
every letter from her
is read 40 times over 
and if she does but knit
a pair of garters 
one hears of nothing else
for a whole month 
it is robert martin 
good boy 
  miss smith 
  mr  martin 
  lovely to see you  miss smith 
  goodbye 
only think of
our happening to meet him 
well  miss woodhouse 
is he like what you expected 
what do you think of him 
i had no right to expect much 
and indeed 
i did not expect much 
but i had imagined him 
i confess 
a degree or two nearer   
gentility 
to be sure   
he s not so genteel
as to a real gentleman 
mm hmm 
i do hope
mr  woodhouse is not ill 
oh  no 
oh  papa sees mr  perry
every day 
i know i disappoint him
awfully 
i m so seldom indisposed 
if he does not invent
an illness for me 
i hardly figure in his letters 
truly   
you are the very picture
of good health  miss woodhouse 
mrs  martin thinks you
the most handsome woman
in all of highbury 
you must never
flatter me in front of
mr  knightley  harriet 
he thinks me
vain enough already 
i do not think you
personally vain 
considering how
very handsome you are 
you seem little occupied
with it 
your vanity lies
a different way 
did i tell you what mr  elton
said of you the other day 
he called you   
    loveliness itself  
it it seems to me
his manners are rather softer
than they used to be 
and i rather wonder
whether he means
to ingratiate himself with you 
morning  mrs  goddard 
  good morning  mr  elton 
  girls 
quickly now 
these are exquisitely done 
miss woodhouse 
you have a charming talent 
i dare say
there is merit in them 
in the least finished
perhaps the most 
so mr  knightley tells me 
and he finds fault
in everything i do 
did you ever have
your likeness taken  harriet 
oh    no 
what an exquisite possession
a good picture of her would be 
it would indeed 
it would indeed 
let me entreat you 
miss woodhouse 
now  at once 
you have given miss smith   
all that she requires 
she was a beautiful creature
when she came to you 
but the attractions
you have added are
infinitely superior
to what she received from   
nature 
it s depressing for me
  to have to take care of it  you know 
  no 
  well  quite 
  take over 
mr  woodhouse 
your daughter s gifts
are without compare 
bear witness 
mm  you ve made her
too tall  emma 
uh  no 
no  certainly not too tall 
not in the least too tall 
mm  mm  yes 
it is very    pretty 
when it is finished 
you must have it framed 
allow me 
trust me with this commission 
miss woodhouse 
and i will ride to london
the moment i am asked 
it would be my great honor 
i cannot have a moment s doubt 
it is exactly as i planned 
he s in love with you 
i do not know
what your opinion may be 
mrs  weston  of this great   
intimacy between emma
and harriet smith 
but i think it a bad thing 
how differently we feel 
miss smith knows nothing
about herself
and looks upon emma
as knowing everything 
her ignorance
is hourly flattery 
but educating harriet
will be an inducement
for emma to educate herself 
they will read together 
emma has been meaning
to read more
ever since she was
12 years old 
she never would submit
to anything
requiring industry
and patience 
i cannot allow you to be
a judge in this matter 
mr  knightley 
you are so used to live alone 
you do not know the value
of a companion 
well  she always declares
that she will never marry 
which  of course 
means just nothing at all 
i should like to see
emma in love
and in some doubt of a return 
it would do her good 
  how firm a foundation  
  ye saints of the lord     
robert 
master knightley is here 
  your faith in
his excellent word  
the day is wasting  mr  martin 
come along 
  what more can he say
than to you he hath said  
  you who unto jesus  
  for refuge have fled   
i m really most obliged
to you  sir 
i d expected to wait
until the spring 
always buy out of season 
mr  martin  whenever you can 
mr  knightley  sir 
forgive my liberty 
but may i be so bold
as to seek your advice 
of course 
miss woodhouse 
you will never guess
what has happened 
robert martin
has offered me his hand 
he writes as if
he really loves me very much 
is it a good letter 
or too short 
it is a very good letter 
so good i think one of his
sisters must have helped him 
but what shall i say 
dear miss woodhouse 
do advise me 
oh  no  no  no 
the words must be your own 
you think i ought
to refuse him 
i lay it down
as a general rule  harriet 
that if a woman doubts whether
she should accept a man or not 
she certainly ought
to refuse him 
perhaps    it is safer 
do you think
i had better say no 
not for the world
would i advise you either way 
you must be the best judge
of your own happiness 
i have now   
quite determined   
   and really almost
made up my mind   
   to   
refuse mr  martin 
refused 
then she is a greater simpleton
than i ever believed her 
harriet smith
refuse robert martin 
i   
i hope you are mistaken 
i saw her answer 
nothing could be clearer 
you saw her answer 
you wrote her answer 
this is your doing 
emma  you persuaded her
to refuse him 
well  if i did  i should not
feel that i had done wrong 
mr  martin s
a respectable young man 
but i cannot admit him
to be harriet s equal 
no  indeed  he is her superior
in both sense and situation 
emma  your infatuation
about that girl blinds you 
what are harriet smith s
claims  either of
birth  nature or education 
to any connection
higher than robert martin 
she is the natural daughter
  of nobody knows whom 
  there can scarcely be a doubt
that her father is a gentleman 
and a gentleman of fortune 
probably no settled provision
at all  and certainly
  no respectable relations 
  her allowance is very liberal 
nothing has been grudged
for her improvement 
she is known only as a parlor
boarder at a common school 
she is pretty 
and she is good tempered 
  and that is all 
  that is all 
these are not trivial
recommendations  mr  knightley 
till men do fall in love
with well informed minds
instead of handsome faces 
a girl with such loveliness
as harriet
has a certainty
of being admired
and sought after
wherever she goes 
i am very much mistaken
if your sex  in general 
would not find these qualities
the highest claims
a woman could possess 
upon my word  emma 
to hear you abusing
the reason you have
is almost enough
to make me think so  too 
better to be
without sense altogether
than to misapply it as you do 
men of sense
do not want silly wives 
and more prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience
and disgrace that
they might be involved in
when the mystery of her
parentage came to be revealed 
let her marry robert martin 
and she is safe
and respectable forever 
but if you teach her
to expect to marry greatly 
nobody within her reach will
ever be good enough for her 
your plans for harriet are
best known only to yourself 
but as you make no secret
of your love of matchmaking 
it is fair to suppose
the plans you have 
and as a friend   
i shall just hint to you
that if elton is
the man that i think 
it will be your labor in vain 
he knows that he is
a very handsome young man
and and a great favorite
wherever he goes 
but from his general
way of talking
when there are
only men present 
i m convinced that he does not
mean to throw himself away 
i m very much obliged to you
for opening my eyes 
mr  knightley 
but know that i am done with
matchmaking for the present 
i only want to keep harriet
for myself 
it s so beautiful 
you certainly spared
no expense 
  hark  hark  what news
the angels bring  
    glad tidings of  
    glad tidings of     
   me to do all
  the disciplinary action to the children 
  you must   
  it is utterly unfair 
  you  it is your responsibility
and your responsibility to
teach the baby to drink milk   
it is not only
my responsiility 
   without spilling it
all over my favorite trousers 
that is the nurse s
responsibility  not   
emma  they re here 
that was unendurable 
husband  comport yourself 
  papa 
  isabella 
emma 
i shall always
be sorry you went to the sea
this autumn
instead of coming here 
but why should you
be sorry  sir 
it did us a great deal of good 
on the contrary  mr  john
knightley looks far from well 
southend was
strenuously recommended
by our physician  sir 
sea air and sea bathing 
the sea is rarely of use
to anybody 
it nearly killed me once 
come 
i must beg you
not to speak of the sea 
makes me miserable 
and envious  
i who have never seen it 
mr  wingfield specified
that southend
was the best place to go
for the family 
perhaps you
should change your physician 
he was
recommended by my husband 
cornwall
might have been forgivable 
but southend 
let us be friends 
aw 
tell your aunt  little emma 
that she was very wrong
and she ought to set you
a better example 
  oh 
  wh   
  what is the matter  is there fever 
  uh   
uh   
where is the nurse 
give her to me 
  is she feverish   
  i do not know 
i i do not know 
wh where is the nurse  
  send for perry 
  do not send for perry 
send for perry 
as death follows life   
mm 
yes 
as    far as
good intentions went  um   
   we were both in the right 
i must admit  i have not yet
been proved wrong 
mr  knightley 
was mr  martin
very disappointed 
a man cannot be more so 
miss woodhouse is coming 
miss woodhouse 
harriet 
miss woodhouse 
you re so  uh    disheveled 
i m always ill at christmas 
get back in bed at once 
you ll miss the party
at randalls 
mr  elton will be there 
and frank churchill
is expected at last 
and mr  elton s sermon 
a sermon on christmas day 
i transcribe them every sunday 
i will transcribe it for you 
you are so kind to me 
miss woodhouse 
welcome 
welcome  my friends 
welcome 
mr  elton 
how s poor miss smith 
oh  no better  i m afraid 
aw  such a sad loss
to our party today 
miss smith has sent
her apologies 
she will be missed
every moment 
ooh 
how are the children 
multiplying 
my only moment s rest
is in the office 
frank has been detained
at enscombe  i m sorry to say 
oh 
i had a letter from him
just this morning 
mr  churchill is
to inherit the entire estate 
i have heard it described
as one of the finest houses
in yorkshire 
going out in dismal weather
to return probably in worse 
four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing
but to convey five idle   
another fine 
flourishing letter
full of professions
and falsehoods 
your feelings are singular 
his letters seem to
satisfy everybody else 
i suspect they do not
satisfy mrs  weston 
were she a person
of consequence herself 
he would have come by now 
i daresay 
you seem determined
to think ill of him 
i should be as ready
to acknowledge his merits
  as any other man  but   
  i hear of none
except that he is well grown
and good looking 
well  if he has nothing else
to recommend him 
he shall be a treasure
at highbury 
we do not often look
upon fine young men 
cannot ask for all the virtues
into the bargain 
you will excuse my being
so much overpowered 
we are both prejudiced 
you against  i for him 
and we shall have
no chance of agreeing
until he is really here 
prejudiced 
i m not prejudiced 
yes  but i am 
very much  and without at all
being ashamed of it 
my love for mr  and mrs  weston
gives me a decided prejudice
in his favor 
charming miss woodhouse 
mr  weston 
mrs  churchill
rules at enscombe 
ev everything   
gives way to her 
she has decreed that if frank
does not marry
a lady of some fortune 
then he will be entirely
cut out from her will 
there is jealousy 
she is jealous even
of his regard for his father 
jealousy   
but she is so very fond
of her nephew 
  he is her particular favorite 
  dear emma 
do not attempt 
with your good nature 
to understand a bad one 
you must let it go its own way 
uh  i have heard it described
as one of the finest houses
in yorksh   
mm  what seasonable weather
we re having 
i dare say we shall
have snow tonight 
snow  tonight 
when did it commence 
we shall call
for the carriage right away 
it has hardly begun  
barely an inch  
but it is falling fast 
it was snowing
when your mother died 
oh  papa  i know 
we shall get you home 
well  what is to be done  emma 
there is room for us all 
we have accommodation
for all of you 
absolutely 
the horses are in
good condition 
i do admire
your resolution  sir 
venturing out
in such weather   
there s nothing we can do 
it is snowing 
  mrs  weston  the party 
  we should go at once 
wh where is the carriage 
where is james 
of course  fortunately  we do
have more than one carriage 
so if one is blown over
in the wind   
  husband  please 
  happy christmas 
i am so very sorry 
  we must leave 
  i think we shall be very glad
that that frank
did not come at christmas 
look to your vinaigrette  papa 
mr  knightley  you must
move your carriage 
  my father is not well 
  take it 
it is first
and will be the fastest 
you will catch your death 
your husband is not   
is not strong 
i ll ride with you  then 
evidently  i may not survive 
oh 
miss woodhouse 
mr  elton 
i must avail myself
of this precious opportunity
to declare sentiments
which must be
  already well known 
  mr  elton  please 
  you ve drunk too much wine 
  my ardent attachment 
mr  elton 
you forget yourself 
i am ready to die
if you refuse me 
you take me for my friend 
any message you have
to miss smith 
i shall be happy to deliver 
for miss smith 
a message for miss smith 
i never thought of miss smith
in the whole course
of my existence 
never paid her any attentions
but as your friend 
never cared whether
she were dead or alive
but as your friend 
oh  miss woodhouse 
who can think of miss smith
when miss woodhouse is near 
everything i have said or done
for many weeks
has been with the sole view
of making my adoration
to yourself 
charming miss woodhouse   
   allow me
to interpret this   
   interesting silence 
it confesses you have
long understood me 
no  sir 
it confesses no such thing 
nothing could be farther
from my wishes 
your pursuit of harriet
has given me great pleasure 
and i ve been very earnestly
wishing your success 
miss smith is
a very good sort of girl   
   and no doubt there are men
who might not object 
everybody has their level 
madam  my visits to hartfield
have been for yourself only 
and the encouragement
i received   
encouragement 
i give you encouragement 
you are entirely mistaken  sir 
i have no thoughts
of matrimony at present 
  driver  stop the carriage 
  mr  elton  please   
driver  stop the carriage 
  the water is wide  
  i cannot get o er  
  and neither have i  
  wings to fly  
  give me a boat  
  that will carry two  
  and both shall row  
  my love and i  
  oh  down in the meadows  
  the other day  
  a gathering flowers  
  both fine and gay  
  a gathering flowers  
  both red and blue  
  i little thought  
  what love can do   
miss woodhouse 
miss woodhouse 
he never loved me 
he loves you 
he sought to aggrandize
and enrich himself 
yes 
harriet 
you might never have thought
of him but for me 
i assured you
of his attachments 
i contrived his visits
to hartfield 
i do not blame you 
miss woodhouse 
i could never have
deserved him 
and none but so partial
and kind a friend as you
could even have
thought it possible 
it s silly  really 
harriet 
i cannot see it
without thinking of him 
burn the frame if you like 
but you must keep the likeness 
then i will take it 
i will take it 
and i will treasure it
as a picture of my friend 
goodbye  papa 
now  are we going
to be quiet this carriage ride 
sit next to your sister 
why are you so pale 
where is the baby 
where is the baby 
where is the baby  
henry needs his mor mor 
we must retrieve
henry s mor mor 
i will not stop
this carriage for a mor mor 
goodbye  isabella 
goodbye 
papa 
i wish she would not leave 
you must never leave me  emma 
oh  papa 
you know i never could 
he cannot stay away forever 
the curate cannot give
the sermon forever 
no one preaches
as mr  elton does 
hear this extract 
miss woodhouse 
hear this 
enough about mr  elton 
miss woodhouse 
miss smith 
such news 
my niece  jane fairfax   
miss woodhouse 
jane fairfax  she has   
jane has surprised us 
she is here 
oh  do come along 
we must have tea 
it is too thrilling 
she caught
a bad cold  poor thing 
so long ago
as the seventh of november 
she has not been well since 
and her kind friends 
the campbells 
thought she d better come home
and try an air that always
agrees with her 
i hope that
your father is well 
very well  i thank you 
she is very sorry to be parted
from her dear friends 
the campbells 
and mrs  dixon 
and  oh  mr  dixon 
the most amiable young man
who did her
so great a service
at weymouth in october 
i still shudder to think
what might have   
if not for mr  dixon 
with the waves and the water
and the sails 
oh 
such a charming man 
oh  dear 
is this not pleasant 
she plans to stay three months 
we must have you all
to hartfield 
oh 
oh  mother  do you hear 
miss woodhouse has invited us
to hartfield 
mother 
you must sample the tart 
no  i do    i do   
i do not advise the custard 
what do you say
to half a glass of wine 
in a tumbler of water 
naturally 
we shall be seeing frank
any day now 
i have   
i have no doubt of it 
oh  now  jane 
mr  frank churchill
is a man much talked about
in highbury 
is he not  miss woodhouse 
we are all very eager
to meet him 
he was at weymouth
when jane was there 
we are very little acquainted 
frank churchill
was at weymouth 
in october 
that was the month
of his father s wedding 
but you must describe him 
is he handsome 
is he agreeable 
i believe he is
generally thought so 
how well prepared
this custard is 
i must ask your cook
for the method 
   tis the last
rose of summer  
  left blooming alone  
  all her lovely companions  
  are faded and gone  
  no flower of her kindred  
  no rosebud is nigh  
  to reflect back her blushes  
  and give sigh for sigh  
  oh  who would inhabit  
  this bleak world alone   
miss fairfax 
oh  what a pity
you did not bring your music 
i hope i can
recollect the tune 
nobody in the world
plays like you 
i m glad you invited
miss fairfax to play 
having no instrument
at her grandmother s 
it must be a real indulgence 
i am glad you approve 
but i hope i am not
often deficient
in what is due
to my guests at hartfield 
no 
you are not often deficient 
you make it very plain
you do not like miss fairfax 
everybody supposes we must be
so fond of each other
because we are the same age 
ever since i can remember 
i have been told i can find
no better companion
than jane fairfax 
she who is so accomplished
and so superior 
she is certainly accomplished 
perhaps the accomplished
young woman
you wish to be thought
yourself 
three months of doing
more than i wish
and less than i ought 
that indifferent 
imperturbable statue 
i must go 
harriet 
oh 
we have missed you 
our mother s been
asking for you 
will you come
and visit us again 
of course 
good day  miss martin 
miss catherine martin 
mr  martin 
miss smith 
th    the near way is flooded 
you would do better
going by mr  cole s stables 
the ground is higher there 
you behaved extremely well 
and it is over 
as a first meeting 
it cannot occur again 
you must stay no longer
than a quarter of an hour 
and allow no dangerous
reminiscences 
there must be
no recurrence to the past 
i seek the village
of highbury  sir 
over the bridge 
left at the crown 
you ll see the steeple 
thank you 
very much obliged 
here we are 
  my dear 
  mrs  weston 
my son  mr  frank churchill 
  miss emma woodhouse 
  miss woodhouse 
he  uh    he s caught us
quite by surprise 
indeed he has 
there are not many houses
in which i would
presume on so far  sir  but   
in coming home  i felt
i might take the liberty 
we  uh    we had a plan
to walk to the village  emma 
will you join us 
i would be delighted 
splendid 
right 
i believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in jane fairfax 
did you meet often at weymouth 
pray  let us go in here 
that i may prove myself to be
a true citizen of highbury 
i must buy something at ford s 
and i beg your pardon 
miss woodhouse 
you were speaking to me 
i merely asked
whether you had known
much of miss fairfax
and her party at weymouth 
and now that i understand
the question 
i must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one 
well  it is always
the lady s right
to decide on the degree
of acquaintance 
you answer as discreetly
as she would herself 
though her account leaves
so much to be guessed
that i really think
you may say what you like
of your acquaintance with her 
i only know what is
generally known 
that she is poor
and of no consequence 
here s where you have
your balls  i suppose 
every fortnight through the winter 
i am afraid highbury may yet
disappoint you  mr  churchill 
we have not society enough
for dancing 
ah  but an inn of this size
must have a ballroom 
and where there is a ballroom 
there can be a ball 
we cannot do without dancing 
instances have been known
of young people
passing many  many months
successfully
without any ball
of any description
and no injury either to body
or to mind  but when   
when the felicities of
rapid motion have been felt   
   it must be
a very heavy heart
that does not ask for more 
it is very dirty inside 
oh  my dear  my dear 
you are too particular 
by candlelight  it ll be
as clean as randalls 
we must have a ball 
yes  and when we do 
may i hope for the honor
of your hand
for the first two dances 
the coles are to hold a
supper party in frank s honor 
and perhaps there ll be
dancing there 
so  emma woodhouse
deigned to accept
an invitation
from the merchant mr  cole 
mr  churchill will soon
return to yorkshire 
we must make the most of every
opportunity until he does 
 we must  
he s in highbury
only two weeks 
and yet he spent a whole day
going to london
just to get his hair cut 
16 miles  twice over 
he s a trifling  silly fop 
indeed 
mr  cole 
such grand estates you have
in common  gentlemen 
donwell abbey 
enscombe 
soon to inherit  of course 
soon to inherit enscombe 
not too soon 
i trust your uncle churchill
is in good health 
uh  excellent health 
and have you heard
the choicest piece of gossip
that has set all the tongues
of the village aflame 
a pianoforte  very elegant 
delivered to miss fairfax
this very morning
with no return address 
i never saw so fine
an instrument 
a pianoforte  very elegant 
and with no return address 
no return address 
jane herself
is quite at a loss 
quite bewildered to think
who could have sent it 
bewildered  indeed 
why do you smile 
nay  why do you 
i suppose i smile for pleasure 
a pianoforte is
a very handsome present 
i rather wonder
it was never made before 
perhaps miss fairfax
has never been
staying here so long before 
or that colonel campbell
did not
give her use
of his own instrument 
which must now be shut up
in london untouched by anybody 
she has done her hair
in so odd a way 
i never saw anything like it 
must be a fancy of her own 
i see nobody else
looking like her 
if colonel campbell
is not the giver 
who can be 
mrs  dixon 
as a token of her   
her friendship  perhaps 
what say you to mr  dixon 
mr  dixon 
he saved her life 
did you hear of it 
a water party 
and by some accident 
she was falling overboard 
he caught her 
huh 
ladies and gentlemen 
a duet 
what do you say to this  emma 
i have made a match between
mr  knightley and jane fairfax 
mr  knightley and jane fairfax 
this pianoforte s
been sent to her by somebody 
and she has always been
a favorite with him 
tonight  he sent his carriage
for her as a courtesy
and walked himself 
was that not gallant 
mr  weston 
  drink to me only
with thine eyes  
  and i will pledge with mine  
  or leave a kiss
within the cup  
  and i ll not ask for wine  
  the thirst that from
the soul doth rise  
  doth ask a drink divine  
  but might i
of love s nectar sip  
  i would not change
for thine   
 enter not into judgment
 with thy servant  o lord 
 for in thy sight   
   shall no man living
be justified  
he s married 
it cannot be
a long acquaintance 
he s only been gone six weeks 
my wife  mrs  augusta elton 
this house is very like
my brother mr  suckling s seat
at maple grove 
very like 
i m quite struck by
the likeness 
is it not astonishingly like 
dear husband 
very like 
i really could almost
fancy myself at maple grove 
the staircase as i came in  
i observed how very like
the staircase is 
placed in exactly the same part
of the house 
i assure you  miss woodhouse 
it is very delightful to me
to be reminded of a place
i am so extremely partial to
as maple grove 
a most impressive residence 
whenever you are transplanted
like me  miss woodhouse 
you will understand
how very delightful it is
to meet with anything at all
that reminds one
of what one has left behind 
we have been calling
at randalls 
what pleasant people
the westons seem to be 
and who should call in
while we were there 
knightley 
knightley himself 
of course  as so particular
a friend of mr  e s 
i had a great curiosity
to meet him 
 my friend knightley 
had been so often mentioned
that i really was
impatient to see him 
and i must do
my cara sposo the justice
to say that he need not be
at all ashamed of his friend 
 knightley  
i could not have believed it 
 knightley  
never met him before
in her life
and calls him  knightley  
and to discover
that he is a gentleman 
upstart  vulgar being 
with her  mr  e 
and her cara sposo 
emma 
  mr  weston 
  miss smith 
the churchills
have settled at richmond 
here 
frank is returning 
we shall have our ball 
no  no 
  you are frank churchill 
  oh 
of course 
you dance so beautifully 
oh 
oh  this is brilliant  indeed 
this is admirable 
excellently contrived 
upon my word 
nothing wanting 
oh  miss woodhouse 
you must really have had
aladdin s lamp 
this is meeting
quite in fairyland 
such a transformation 
now  where shall we sit 
where shall we sit 
oh  now  anywhere where jane
is not in a draft 
how do you like my gown 
  oh   
  miss bates  oh  mr  elton 
i do not know whether
it is not over trimmed 
i have the greatest dislike to
the idea of being over trimmed 
quite a horror of finery 
of course  i must put on
a few ornaments now
because it is expected 
a bride  you know 
must appear like a bride 
but my natural taste
is all for simplicity 
how do you like jane s hair 
she did it all herself 
too wonderful 
no hairdresser
from london  i think 
could do a finer style 
emma 
it has just occurred to us
that mrs  elton will expect
to be asked to begin the ball 
and she will surely think
frank ought to ask her 
frank cannot break
his promise to you 
he s promised you
the first two dances 
here s the plan 
i will ask mrs  elton 
the ball is in frank s honor 
but it s in my design 
i shall ask her 
you must submit
to stand second 
a bride must be first
in company 
it is almost enough
to make me think of marrying 
oh 
must i go first 
i really am ashamed
to always be
leading the way 
gentlemen 
you have been much missed
in highbury 
have i 
how is your aunt 
most reluctant to release me 
do you not dance  mr  elton 
most readily  mrs  weston 
if you will dance with me 
  oh 
  ah 
well  perhaps   
there is a young lady
disengaged
whom i should be very glad
to see dancing   miss smith 
miss smith 
if i were not
an old married man 
but my dancing days are over 
mrs  weston 
you will excuse me 
will you dance  miss smith 
thank you 
for your kindness to harriet 
he was unpardonably rude 
and he aimed at wounding
more than harriet 
i was completely mistaken
in mr  elton 
there is a littleness about him
which you discovered
and i did not 
you would have chosen
for him better
than he has chosen for himself 
harriet smith has some
first rate qualities
which mrs  elton
is totally without 
she does you credit  emma 
as you do her 
ah 
oh  miss woodhouse 
come 
set your companions an example 
they re all lazy 
they re all asleep 
we must dance another set 
i am ready
whenever i am wanted 
with whom will you dance 
with you 
if you will ask me 
you have shown
that you can dance 
and we are not really so much
brother and sister
as to make it improper 
no  indeed 
stop it 
stop embarrassing yourself 
i am not embarrassing myself 
oh 
mr  churchill  harriet 
  oh 
  what has happened 
she was set upon by some
gypsies as she was coming home 
when she attempted escape 
she fell 
she had a cramp 
  from too much dancing 
  well  is she hurt 
i didn t see 
i arrived moments after   
   and brought her here 
i could think of
no other place 
to the drawing room 
it was on account
of the scissors 
emma and mr  knightley 
the scissors 
  oh 
  i   
   borrowed a pair of scissors
from miss bates 
i was halfway home
when i made the recollection
and so doubled back 
whew 
what is your purpose here 
um  my my    carriage   
my    uh  my horse
threw a shoe 
you took
your carriage to the ball 
yes 
what might have become of me 
miss woodhouse 
if not for the scissors 
we must send for perry 
miss woodhouse 
i believe i am in love again 
mrs  goddard
should be assured of her safety 
yes  and i shall
rouse my father 
we ought to let them know
that there are gypsies
in the neighborhood 
yes  let us go at once 
  oh  miss woodhouse 
  say nothing more 
do not go 
mr  churchill 
please 
stay 
what is the matter 
what has happened 
what    is she   
is she    is she alive 
harriet is unharmed  papa 
we have mr  churchill to thank 
please stay 
mr  knightley
can sound the alarm 
we will both go 
why are we alarmed 
we have sent for perry  papa 
he s your superior 
no doubt  but   
but wonderful things
have taken place 
there have been matches
of greater disparity 
believe me  i have not
the presumption to suppose 
no  but the service
he rendered you 
service 
the very recollection of it 
and all that i felt 
his coming to me 
his noble look 
such a change in one moment
from misery to   
   to perfect happiness 
i was very wrong before 
i will be cautious now 
i am determined against
any interference 
what is this i hear  dear jane 
about your going
to the post office
in the rain last week 
why  you sad girl 
why would you do such a thing 
i will not allow you
to do such a thing again 
i shall speak to mr  e 
the man who fetches
our letters  
one of our men 
i forget his name  
shall inquire for yours  too 
do you suppose mr  knightley
might extend us all
an invitation to the abbey 
miss woodhouse 
i love to explore great houses 
and i fear i have
long exhausted highbury 
i m afraid
mr  knightley s concerns
are all for his tenants
and none for his house 
mrs  elton 
his ballrooms and picture
galleries are quite shut up 
i should be very glad
to open donwell
for your exploration 
mrs  elton 
  the welcome is long overdue 
  mm 
i should like that
of all things 
name your day  and i will come 
i cannot
name a day until i have spoken
to some others whom i would
wish to form the party 
oh  leave that to me 
it is my party 
i will invite your guests 
i hope you will bring elton 
but i will not trouble you
to give any other invitations 
oh 
oh  well  now you are
looking very sly 
but consider 
you need not be afraid
of delegating power to me 
married women  you know 
may be safely authorized 
there is but one
married woman in all the world
whom i can ever allow
to invite what guests
she pleases to donwell 
mrs  weston  i suppose 
no  mrs  knightley 
until she is in being  i will
manage such matters myself 
oh  my heavens 
do you not feel transported 
i can hardly believe
that we remain in england 
and i was to accompany him 
but the night before his going 
i was struck down by a fever 
and so i did not go 
please excuse me 
of course 
there is an excellent prospect
from the south window 
miss smith 
may i escort you 
jane of course
knows a great deal
more of the world than i 
she has been to ireland 
will you   
be so kind when i am missed
to say that i am gone home 
if you wish it 
but you re not going to walk
back to highbury alone 
  are you unwell 
  miss woodhouse   
we all know at times what it is
to be wearied in spirits 
mine  i confess  are exhausted 
have i missed the party 
not at all 
we re exploring the house 
i was detained by my aunt 
a nervous seizure
which lasted some hours 
had i known how hot a ride
i should have 
i believe i should not
have come at all 
you will soon
be cooler if you sit down 
some cold beer  perhaps 
as soon as my aunt gets well
again  i shall go abroad 
i m tired of doing nothing 
i want a change 
i m serious  miss woodhouse 
whatever your penetrating eyes
may fancy 
i m sick of england 
you are sick of prosperity
and indulgence 
cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself
and be contented to stay 
you are quite mistaken 
i do not look upon myself
as either prosperous
or indulged 
we re going to box hill
tomorrow 
it is not the grand tour 
but it will be something
for a young man
so much in want of change 
well  if you wish me to stay
and join the party 
i will 
how much i am obliged to you
for telling me to come today 
i had quite determined
to go away again 
yes  you were very cross 
our companions
are excessively stupid 
what shall we do to rouse them 
hmm  any nonsense will serve 
ladies and gentlemen 
i am ordered by miss woodhouse
to say that
she desires to know
what you re all thinking of 
dear  what we are thinking of 
is miss woodhouse sure
that she would like to know
what we are all thinking of 
no  no 
upon no account in the world 
it is the very last thing
i would stand the brunt of
just now 
it is the sort of thing
which i should not
have thought myself privileged
to inquire into  as   
chaperon of the party 
very true  my love 
very true 
but some ladies
will say anything 
best to pass it off as a joke 
everybody knows
what is due to you 
they are
most of them affronted 
i will attack them
with more address 
ladies and gentlemen 
i am ordered by miss woodhouse
to say that
she waives her right
of knowing what
you may be thinking of
and only requires something
entertaining from each of you 
she demands either
one thing very clever
or two things moderately clever
or three things
very dull indeed 
and she engages
to laugh heartily at them all 
oh  v very well  then 
i need not be uneasy 
 three things
very dull indeed  
that will do just for me 
i shall be sure to say
three dull things
as soon as i open my mouth 
ah  ma am  but there is
the difficulty 
when have you ever
stopped at three 
oh 
no  i see what she she means 
i shall try to hold my tongue 
i i like this plan 
uh  agreed  agreed 
agreed  agreed 
uh  i shall do my best 
um   
i m making a conundrum 
how will a conundrum reckon 
low  i am afraid  sir 
but we shall  uh 
be indulgent   
mr  knightley  i must have
made myself very disagreeable 
or she would not have said
such a thing to an old friend 
i cannot think
what i have done 
what two letters
of the alphabet are there
that express perfection 
what two letters   
   express perfection 
i    i m sure i do not know 
well  i shall tell you 
 m  and  a    emma  
  do you understand 
  yes 
mr  weston has shown us how
to play this game
but also how to end it 
for who can improve
upon perfection 
i protest  i must be excused 
i do not pretend to be a wit 
i really must be allowed
to judge when to speak
and when to hold my tongue 
shall we walk  augusta 
most willingly 
i am very tired of exploring
so long on one spot 
shall we join
mrs  elton  ma am 
if you please  my dear 
with all my heart 
i am quite ready 
how could you be
so unfeeling to miss bates 
it was not so very bad 
how could you be so insolent
to a woman of her character
and and and age
and and situation 
i dare say she did not
understand me 
i assure you she did 
she felt your full meaning 
she has talked of it since 
i know there is not a better
creature in the world   
i wish you could have heard
how she talked of it  
w with what candor
and and generosity 
you must allow that what is
good and what is ridiculous
are most unfortunately
blended in her 
they are blended in her 
i acknowledge 
and were she
a woman of fortune 
i would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner 
but she is poor 
she has sunk from the comfort
she was born to 
and if she lived to an old age 
she will probably sink more 
  it is too hot  and   
  she has seen you grow up
  from when her notice of you was an honor 
  and i am tired 
to have you now 
in thoughtless spirits
and the pride of the moment 
laugh at her
and and humble her 
and before her niece
and before others  many of whom
are entirely guided
by your treatment of her 
it was badly done  indeed 
go 
i have been
unpardonably vain   
   and insufferably arrogant 
i have been inconsiderate   
   and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling and   
i m afraid jane
is not very well 
dreadful headache 
writing all morning 
such long letters 
i said   my dear 
you shall blind yourself  
i m so very sorry  miss bates 
please give jane
my good wishes 
you were kept waiting
at the door 
i was quite ashamed 
no  you    you see 
there was a little bustle 
for it so happened
we did not hear the knock 
and until you were
on the stairs 
we did not know
that anybody was coming 
so very kind 
but you are always kind 
miss woodhouse 
ah  emma 
how did you find them 
emma has been to call on
mrs  and miss bates 
mr  knightley 
she is always
so attentive to them 
i   
i regret i cannot stay  sir 
we will miss you
in the evening 
goodbye  emma 
what has happened 
mrs  churchill is dead 
dead 
yes  we we always thought
her illness
was invented  but   
emma 
frank was here
this very morning
on the most
extraordinary errand 
it is impossible
to express our surprise 
frank and jane fairfax
are engaged 
what 
there s been a solemn
engagement between them
ever since october 
formed at weymouth and kept
a secret from everybody 
what  um   
engaged 
before either of them
came to highbury 
secretly engaged 
of course 
had his aunt heard of it 
she would have
cut him off  but   
it has hurt me  emma 
very much 
it has hurt his father equally 
he sent the pianoforte 
he has confessed it 
emma  you must know
it was our darling wish 
oh  no  no 
not for me 
i m so very sorry  harriet 
but why should you condole me 
you do not think i care about
mr  frank churchill 
there was a time 
and not very distant  either 
when you gave me reason
to believe
  that you did care about him 
  him 
never 
dear miss woodhouse 
how could you so mistake me 
harriet  wh what do you mean 
i should not have
thought it possible
that you could have
misunderstood me 
but you told me that
greater things had happened 
that there had been matches
of greater disparity 
those were your very words 
miss woodhouse 
harriet 
let us understand
each other now
without possibility
of further mistake 
are you speaking
of mr  knightley 
of course 
  but   
  i thought you knew 
but the service
mr  churchill rendered you
i in protecting you
from the gypsies 
oh  no 
it was not the gypsies  no 
i was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance 
of mr  knightley s coming
and asking me to dance 
when mr  elton
would not stand up with me 
good god 
and have you any idea
of mr  knightley s
returning your affection 
i must say that i have 
he has shown me sweetness
and kindness 
and at donwell  he took
great pains to describe to me
some particulars of the
management of his tenant farms 
we were interrupted 
but before we were   
   he seemed almost
to be asking me
if my affections were engaged 
yes  but is it possible
that he might have been
alluding to mr  martin 
that he might have had
mr  martin s interest in view 
you think of mr  knightley
for yourself 
harriet 
i i do not flatter myself
with any idea
of his attachment to me 
harriet 
i should have considered it
too great a presumption
even to think of him
but for you 
harriet 
i know that he is the last man
who would intentionally give
any woman the idea
of his feeling more for her
than he does  so   
if you believe   
   he loves you   
i refused mr  martin
because of you 
because   
harriet 
emma 
mr  knightley 
have you heard the news 
miss fairfax
and frank churchill 
i did not see it 
but then i seem to have been
doomed to blindness 
time  my dearest emma   
time will heal the wound 
he will soon be gone 
you will forget him 
you are very kind 
but you are mistaken 
my blindness
to what was going on
led me to act in a way that
i must always be ashamed of 
but i have no other regret 
with respect to   
mr  churchill 
he is a disgrace
to the name of man 
and is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman 
jane  jane   
you ll be a miserable creature 
everything turns out
for his good 
his his aunt is in the way 
his aunt dies 
he uses everybody ill 
and and and they re delighted
to forgive him 
he is a fortunate man  indeed 
you speak as if you envied him 
and i do envy him 
emma 
in one respect 
he is the object of my envy 
you will not ask me why 
you are    you you are   
you are determined  i see 
to have no curiosity 
you are wise 
but i cannot be wise 
i must tell you  emma 
what you will not ask 
though i may wish it unsaid
the next moment 
oh  then do not speak it 
if you wish to speak to me   
as a friend
or to ask my opinion   
as a friend 
i will hear whatever you like 
 as a friend   emma  that 
i fear  is a word   
tell me  emma 
have i no chance
of ever succeeding 
my dearest emma 
for dearest you will always be 
my dearest  most beloved emma 
tell me at once 
i cannot make speeches 
if i   
if i    if i loved you less 
then i might be able
to talk about it more 
but y y you you   
you know what i am 
i have    i have lectured you 
and i ve   
i ve blamed you  and   
and you have borne it
as no other woman in england
could have borne it 
god knows i have been
a very indifferent lover 
but you understand me 
you you understand my feelings 
will you marry me 
oh 
emma 
oh 
emma 
  oh 
  emma 
oh 
  emma 
  uh  no  i   
  emma 
  oh 
no  i   
i   
i i cannot 
why not 
harriet 
  harriet  wh   
  she s in love with you 
and she believes that you may love her  too 
and    and you danced with her 
  oh  oh 
  and shown her kindness
and took notice of her
at donwell
and spoke of farming and   
and seemed on the verge
of asking
if her affections were engaged 
to robert martin 
to robert martin 
she told you this 
i cannot break her heart again 
i shall    i shall
call on robert martin
this very evening 
i shall urge him
to put his suit
to miss smith a second time 
he still loves her 
i m certain that he does 
he need only ask again 
not not by letter 
but in person 
no 
no  i must do it 
i must go 
mr  martin   
   i have a confession to make 
i have caused you
great suffering 
as i have also caused
the suffering of my friend 
my dearest friend 
  how firm a foundation  
  ye saints of the lord  
  is laid for your faith  
  in his excellent word  
  what more can he say  
  than to you he hath said  
  you who unto jesus  
  for refuge have fled   
harriet 
mr  robert martin
has offered me his hand 
i have accepted 
then he is the most fortunate
man of my acquaintance 
harriet  i   
there is something else 
i have had a letter
from my father 
now that i have come of age 
he has revealed himself 
he is a tradesman 
in bristol 
he makes galoshes 
he comes to highbury next week
on purpose to meet with me 
then i hope you will
bring him to hartfield 
  as i was a walkin   
  one midsummer s morning  
  i heard the birds whistle
and the nightingales play  
  and there did i spy  
  a beautiful maiden  
  as i was a walkin 
all on the highway  
  oh  where are you going 
my fair pretty lady   
  oh  where are you going  
  so early this morn   
  she said   i m going down
to visit my neighbors  
  i m going down to warwick 
the place i was born   
  it s  may i come with you 
my sweet pretty darling   
  may i go along  
  in your sweet company    
  then she turned her head
and smiling all at me  
  saying 
 you may come with me  
  kind sir  if you please    
do you   
do you feel a draft 
mr  knightley 
about the knees 
i i cannot say that i do  sir 
ah 
pity 
in fact   
yes 
  a chill draft 
  chill 
the screen  bartholomew 
charles  make haste 
no  not that    this one 
no  not that one  this one 
how could i ever leave him 
he can remove with you
to donwell 
you know he never would 
he could not stand it 
then i shall come here 
you would quit the abbey 
yes 
sacrifice your independence 
yeah 
and live constantly with my
father in no house of your own 
yeah 
uh  h how
is it now  mr  knightley 
it s much better now 
dearly beloved friends 
we gather here
in the sight of god
to join together this man
and this woman
in holy matrimony 
an honorable estate
instituted by god
in the time of man s
great innocence
