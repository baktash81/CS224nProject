in this consists all of my joy 
i know you ll give me
what i need 
i know you will not refuse it 
i need courage 
i know you will provide

some intellectuals

to make war or compel them
and the majority of italians   
do not want war 
christ   
offered himself 
with his body 
with his flesh to the father 
in similar way
we offer of our self 
our bodies 
our flesh
to god
in  uh  union with christ 
sometimes this is suffering 
sometimes not 
but the suffering
in union with christ
is a door to the heaven 
this em   suffering lived alone
is a door to hell 
 the devil  so   
you managed to avoid
going to war 
you tried so hard
and you finally succeeded 
i m ill 
if i wasn t  i d be there 
you are no more than

my mother is the madonna 
liar 
the letters you wrote
to your devoted followers 
that s what get you out
of your military service

is that your little madonna 
tell me  where you weeping
when you wrote this 
was your hand quivering 
 i also must ask you a favor 
i would very much like for you
to write to donna giovina cevera
in order for her
to put in a good word
with these butcher superiors  
 butchers  
those officers were doing
their duty  no more  no less 
and to you they are butchers 
i m not scared of you 
 exhales softly 
i m protected
by the blood of christ

  you re a coward

 luigi  the primary source
of all human oppression
and exploitation
is individual property 
oppression 
you know what it is 
oppression means cruel
and unjust treatment 
it s what happened to you 
you work hard
every day  right 
you work all day or not 
do you ever stop 
this is not right 
this is not fair 
exploitation means
that you re not the one
who takes the benefit
from your work 
 in nature  everything
is transformed 
nothing is created
and nothing is destroyed 
following this natural law
that wants transformation
is the struggle for existence
and the revolution  
nature is a cycle
of constant change 
the way spring arrives
after winter 
or the way     chuckles 
the calf grows
into the milk giving cow 
 mooing 
 laughter 
   mooing

you know that  right 
that s what i m saying 
we need change 
change is a natural law 
the land and everything
it gives us
belongs to everybody 
   socialist  yes 
  and one family can t control
  san giovanni rotondo 
   socialist  yeah  that s true 
yeah  that s true 
what is he talking about 
he s talking about
how we can get control
of our lives 
 luigi 
i m talking about freedom 
to have freedom  we must stop
the exploitation by the masters 
 salvatore  exploitation 
you spent your life in school 
  what are you saying 
   scoffs 
you are an alberizzi 
you re part
of a landowner family 
   luigi  calm 
   socialist  that s true 
how was life in bologna
while we fought to protect you 
is this not a contradiction 
you want to talk
about contradictions 
you won right 
but what did you win 
this war led to nothing 
our sacrifices led to nothing

i introduce you to luigi 
he s our young 
radical comrade 
pleasure 
my pleasure 
 luigi  now  in san giovanni 
they say that
i m a revolutionary 
a fire starter  it s true 
but it s consciences
i want to set fire to 
yes  but let s focus
on winning the elections now 
we need to speak
of winning votes 
do you think lenin and trotsky
cared about elections 
 silvestro 
socialism is a process 
so  comrades     inhales 
you must be careful
how you interpret
the great russian revolution 
the world is not transformed
by following the plans
that a prophet writes on paper
or preaches to the masses 
their socialism is not ours 
social revolution   
is not the creation
of one man s will 
lenin is neither a leader
nor a prophet 
he s a politician 
so     inhales  comrades 
we will not take power
with violence 
but with the consent
of the masses 
we put our flag in good hands
and we win

 padre pio  my dearest
father benedetto   
if i could fly 
i d like to shout 
i d like to cry out to everyone
at the top of my voice 
love jesus 
love him who s
so deserving of love 
but alas  my dear father 
my soul is still strongly
bound to the body
and many are the sins which
impede the flight of my soul 
if you could pray that
the lord might be pleased
to shorten my exile 
and explain to me the origin
of this blind desire i have
to depart from this life 
i d appreciate it 
my sins are many
and they ought to check
my blind passion 
i ponder over them  yet 
i feel more and more attracted
by the desire to take flight
from this world 
 soft music playing 
do you recognize this 
is this the work of the ogre 
please keep me
continually warned 
 fire crackling 
 antonio  these used to belong
to that poor little girl 
her mother asked me
to repair them 
she won t be
needing them anymore 
and what was her fault 
to be born poor 
in the gospel it is written
that it will be very difficult
for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven 
while marx said so too 
in his own way 
 angelo  you re talking about
the kingdom of heaven 
but here we live in hell 
i walk alone among them 
in front of their ailments 
their cries  their problems 
most unsolvable 
here we need water 
we need a hospital 
the little kid died because
i could not get the medicine
i needed to save her 
we need to change things 
but we  the socialists 
are divided 
we are against each other 
 chuckles softly 
luigi wants to talk about
the brotherhood of the workers 
but here we only have
the unemployed 
and most of them
can neither read or write 
i know it is hard 
we are divided 
but you do not despair 
because whoever
is not with you
is not necessarily
against you 
call them friends 
if not brothers 
and remember the words
of the poor carpenter
when he said   there is
no greater love than this 
to give one s life
for one s friends  
friends  huh   
even shoes are divided
according to their social class 
 sighs 
 humming 
 padre pio 
i feel that sometimes
when i m in the midst of prayer
that i m just   
that i feel alone like i m   
i feel not alone like lonely 
but alone like the lord
has abandoned me 
and i m essentially
talking to myself 
do you feel in darkness 
yes  tremendous 
do you feel abandoned 
yes 
and scared and baffled
and confused and   
and like i m sinning
but i don t  
i don t know
if i m sinning or not 
because it feels like a sin
to the question these things 
it feels like a sin
to be angry with the lord 
 sniffles 
and i m angry a lot 
i feel angry a lot 
  you know 
  i can tell you 
the lord hasn t
abandoned you 
he s with you even
in the midst of darkness 
 sniffles 
you have to keep
your purer life 
and receiving
the sacraments 
it s the way 
it s the only way
to be able to stay
in the right road 
without the lord 
you can t do anything 
i know 
 praying in latin 
the war   
took our two sons
away from us 
they were both young 
we cannot find a reason
to live anymore 
but if god wanted this 
even him 
why does he want
to keep us alive 
  to torment us 
  no  no 
war is a terrible thing 
francesco 
and your pain is real  yes 
do not let satan take
advantage of your suffering 
do you understand 
blessed is the man who
endures the trial  francesco 
when i was young 
my mother would do
embroidery at home 
yes  sitting in a chair 
and  uh  i  sitting in a stool 
looked up at the work   
but i would only see it
from upside down 
i d see the knots
and the confused threads 
and i d say to my mother 
 what are you doing 
what is this 
why is it so ugly  
and my mother 
she would lower the frame 
and she would show me
the good side of the work 
and i would see
all of the colors
were in the right place
and the pattern
was beautiful 
precise 
i  like you now 
can only see
the work from upside down
 cause i was sitting
in a short stool  francesco 
if you lift your spirit
up in prayer 
the lord will show you
the design he has for you 
calm 
stay calm 
 gerardo 
what are you guys doing 
we are we working the land
that you keep abandoned 
they need it to eat 
so if you re not using it 
we have the right to 
 gun cocks 
 luigi  socialism alone
will be enough
to create the most
perfect balance
between men  order 
and peace 
because human beings 
in their free development 
will understand that no man
can be truly free and happy
  if not in the respect
of all humanity 
  what are you guys looking at 
huh  leave my land now 
   gunshots

that s why i am here 
 gerardo inhales

these socialists need a lesson

they won t need a priest

i ve been feeling
a lot of anger 
especially toward my son 
i shout at him 
he doesn t listen to me 
he reminds me
of my mother
who died a year ago 
i still hold a lot
of resentment against her 
lately   
i ve been observing my   
my daughter   
as she washes herself 
her body s changing 
her nipples are changing
their color 
i look at her body 
i feel aroused 
  no 
  i can t help it 
  i  uh  i don t know how to  
  no 
you have a darkness
in your heart 
it manifests itself as evil 
evil you perpetuate
on your family with
no apologies  no   
there s no contrition
in anything you have to say 
you relish in it 
it s unacceptable 
i would assign as penance
for your mother and your son
that you fast on bread and water
for the next week 
you say three hail mary s
and three our father s
everyday for the next month 
as for your daughter 
there is no penance
that s adequate 
be grateful i m not god 
i m just a friar who prays 
it s beyond me 
this is beyond me 
i would bar you from communion
until the last rites 
save for christ s compassion 
go to god 
don t come to me  go to god 
god cannot help me 
god can help you 
god is capable of pulling
the highest good
out of the worst tragedy 
god can help you 
go to god 
i think god doesn t exist 
why 
 rustling 
if you continue behaving
the way you re behaving 
you re going to hell 
you understand that 
you understand that 
i don t know if there s hell 
you don t know if there s hell

the third 
when i entered this order 
and the fourth 
when the lord came to visit me 
and since that visitation 
father   
this desire
has been growing
continually in my heart 
it is now what i would call
a strong passion 
i have in fact
made this offering
to the lord many times   
by seeking him to pour out
upon me all the punishments
for all the sinners
and all the souls
in a state of purgation 
even increasing them
upon me a hundred fold 
so long as he quickly
admits to paradise 
all the sinners and all
the souls in purgatory 
but i should now 
formally 
might to make this offering
to the lord
in obedience to you 
this is my purpose 
and more than that
it seems to me
that jesus really wants this 
i m sure you have no difficulty
in granting me this permission 
please bless me  father 
and pray for me also 
your friend  your brother
