luigi the primary source
of all human oppression
and exploitation
is individual property
oppression
you know what it is
oppression means cruel
and unjust treatment
its what happened to you
you work hard
every day right
you work all day or not
do you ever stop
this is not right
this is not fair
exploitation means
that youre not the one
who takes the benefit
from your work
in nature everything
is transformed
nothing is created
and nothing is destroyed
following this natural law
that wants transformation
is the struggle for existence
and the revolution
nature is a cycle
of constant change
the way spring arrives
after winter
or the way chuckles
the calf grows
into the milkgiving cow
mooing
laughter
mooing

you know that right
thats what im saying
we need change
change is a natural law
the land and everything
it gives us
belongs to everybody
socialist yes
and one family cant control
san giovanni rotondo
socialist yeah thats true
yeah thats true
what is he talking about
hes talking about
how we can get control
of our lives
luigi
im talking about freedom
to have freedom we must stop
the exploitation by the masters
salvatore exploitation
you spent your life in school
what are you saying
scoffs
you are an alberizzi
youre part
of a landowner family
luigi calm
socialist thats true
how was life in bologna
while we fought to protect you
is this not a contradiction
you want to talk
about contradictions
you won right
but what did you win
this war led to nothing
our sacrifices led to nothing
wheres your husband
she doesnt know
bring me a candle
luigi
if a candle gives you light
do not curse the candle
vehicle approaching

angelo welcome comrade
welcome back
silvestro
hows everyone
please
please have a seat

antonio
i introduce you to luigi
hes our young
radical comrade
pleasure
my pleasure
luigi now in san giovanni
they say that
im a revolutionary
a fire starter its true
but its consciences
i want to set fire to
yes but lets focus
on winning the elections now
we need to speak
of winning votes
do you think lenin and trotsky
cared about elections
silvestro
socialism is a process
so comrades inhales
you must be careful
how you interpret
the great russian revolution
the world is not transformed
by following the plans
that a prophet writes on paper
or preaches to the masses
their socialism is not ours
social revolution
is not the creation
of one mans will
lenin is neither a leader
nor a prophet
hes a politician
so inhales comrades
we will not take power
with violence
but with the consent
of the masses
we put our flag in good hands
and we win

padre pio my dearest
father benedetto
if i could fly
id like to shout
id like to cry out to everyone
at the top of my voice
love jesus
love him whos
so deserving of love
but alas my dear father
my soul is still strongly
bound to the body
and many are the sins which
impede the flight of my soul
if you could pray that
the lord might be pleased
to shorten my exile
and explain to me the origin
of this blind desire i have
to depart from this life
id appreciate it
my sins are many
and they ought to check
my blind passion
i ponder over them yet
i feel more and more attracted
by the desire to take flight
from this world
soft music playing
do you recognize this
is this the work of the ogre
please keep me
continually warned
fire crackling
antonio these used to belong
to that poor little girl
her mother asked me
to repair them
she wont be
needing them anymore
and what was her fault
to be born poor
in the gospel it is written
that it will be very difficult
for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven
while marx said so too
in his own way
angelo youre talking about
the kingdom of heaven
but here we live in hell
i walk alone among them
in front of their ailments
their cries their problems
most unsolvable
here we need water
we need a hospital
the little kid died because
i could not get the medicine
i needed to save her
we need to change things
but we the socialists
are divided
we are against each other
chuckles softly
luigi wants to talk about
the brotherhood of the workers
but here we only have
the unemployed
and most of them
can neither read or write
i know it is hard
we are divided
but you do not despair
because whoever
is not with you
is not necessarily
against you
call them friends
if not brothers
and remember the words
of the poor carpenter
when he said there is
no greater love than this
to give ones life
for ones friends
friends huh
even shoes are divided
according to their social class
sighs
humming
padre pio
i feel that sometimes
when im in the midst of prayer
that im just
that i feel alone like im
i feel not alone like lonely
but alone like the lord
has abandoned me
and im essentially
talking to myself
do you feel in darkness
yes tremendous
do you feel abandoned
yes
and scared and baffled
and confused and
and like im sinning
but i dont
i dont know
if im sinning or not
because it feels like a sin
to the question these things
it feels like a sin
to be angry with the lord
sniffles
and im angry a lot
i feel angry a lot
you know
i can tell you
the lord hasnt
abandoned you
hes with you even
in the midst of darkness
sniffles
you have to keep
your purer life
and receiving
the sacraments
its the way
its the only way
to be able to stay
in the right road
without the lord
you cant do anything
i know
praying in latin
the war
took our two sons
away from us
they were both young
we cannot find a reason
to live anymore
but if god wanted this
even him
why does he want
to keep us alive
to torment us
no no
war is a terrible thing
francesco
and your pain is real yes
do not let satan take
advantage of your suffering
do you understand
blessed is the man who
endures the trial francesco
when i was young
my mother would do
embroidery at home
yes sitting in a chair
and uh i sitting in a stool
looked up at the work
but i would only see it
from upside down
id see the knots
and the confused threads
and id say to my mother
what are you doing
what is this
why is it so ugly
and my mother
she would lower the frame
and she would show me
the good side of the work
and i would see
all of the colors
were in the right place
and the pattern
was beautiful
precise
i like you now
can only see
the work from upside down
cause i was sitting
in a short stool francesco
if you lift your spirit
up in prayer
the lord will show you
the design he has for you
calm
stay calm
gerardo
what are you guys doing
we are we working the land
that you keep abandoned
they need it to eat
so if youre not using it
we have the right to
gun cocks
luigi socialism alone
will be enough
to create the most
perfect balance
between men order
and peace
because human beings
in their free development
will understand that no man
can be truly free and happy
if not in the respect
of all humanity
what are you guys looking at
huh leave my land now

these socialists need a lesson

bless me father
for ive sinned
my last confession
was 160 days ago
since then
ive been feeling
a lot of anger
especially toward my son
i shout at him
he doesnt listen to me
he reminds me
of my mother
who died a year ago
i still hold a lot
of resentment against her
lately
ive been observing my
my daughter
as she washes herself
her bodys changing
her nipples are changing
their color
i look at her body
i feel aroused
no
i cant help it
i uh i dont know how to
no
you have a darkness
in your heart
it manifests itself as evil
evil you perpetuate
on your family with
no apologies no
theres no contrition
in anything you have to say
you relish in it
its unacceptable
i would assign as penance
for your mother and your son
that you fast on bread and water
for the next week
you say three hail marys
and three our fathers
everyday for the next month
as for your daughter
there is no penance
thats adequate
be grateful im not god
im just a friar who prays
its beyond me
this is beyond me
i would bar you from communion
until the last rites
save for christs compassion
go to god
dont come to me go to god
god cannot help me
god can help you
god is capable of pulling
the highest good
out of the worst tragedy
god can help you
go to god
i think god doesnt exist
why
rustling
if you continue behaving
the way youre behaving
youre going to hell
you understand that
you understand that
i dont know if theres hell
you dont know if theres hell

i was born four times
the first
from my mother
the second
when i received baptism
the third
when i entered this order
and the fourth
when the lord came to visit me
and since that visitation
father
this desire
has been growing
continually in my heart
it is now what i would call
a strong passion
i have in fact
made this offering
to the lord many times
by seeking him to pour out
upon me all the punishments
for all the sinners
and all the souls
in a state of purgation
even increasing them
upon me a hundredfold
so long as he quickly
admits to paradise
all the sinners and all
the souls in purgatory
but i should now
formally
might to make this offering
to the lord
in obedience to you
this is my purpose
and more than that
it seems to me
that jesus really wants this
im sure you have no difficulty
in granting me this permission
please bless me father
and pray for me also
