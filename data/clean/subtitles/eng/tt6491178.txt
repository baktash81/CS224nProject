officer
second man detective

ive got a cousin who plumbs
vasquez is shackled
on the fire escape
his deaf girlfriends in here

shes got a gun
75 percent chance yeah

window

whispers one two
police okay
comprende siono
that handbag seemed a little heavy
even taking into account
the amount of makeup latinas carry
yeah even still
shes got a gun
gasps
come on come on honey

why dont you shut the doors
and crank up the fans
where did your novio put
that green duffel bag you got last night

sounded kind of like dolphin
i expect shell get more intelligible
when she answers our questions
wheres the green duffel bag
i wanna call a lawyer
i wanna stutters
wheres the green duffel bag
we saw vasquez bring it here
last night at 1100
that swell guy who fled
and left you here with us
least he had time
ball rolls
to get his soul mate
tell us where it is
and my partner and i will be done in time
to get the breakfast special at berts
maybe thats reason enough to forget
all about you and that gun of yours
where is it
the closet
there
in the wall behind the suits
i smell three eggs over easy
hash browns
and pumpernickel toast
plus that coffee you owe me
officer
davids detective
drag vasquez back inside
we got cash narcotics and two imbeciles
to drive downtown and paper
you said if i told you where the bag was
youll let me go
can you understand her
no
j we can be considerate j
j to people or strangers j
j until you get to know them
this a guy or a girl singing this song
j yeah j
j its raining so hard outside
j before you go
ill give you my favorite umbrella
j to keep you dry
cant tell
j would you like to have i
not that theres much of a difference
these days
i think that line was obliterated
the day men started saying
were pregnant
when their wives were
your breakfast specials
thanks
cell phone vibrates
cell phone chimes
didnt know the chief lieutenant
was so fond of intrigue
excuse me
could you box our food up
in togo containers
you want me to pack up
everything i just carried
from all the way over there
correct
ill get some takeout boxes
you two crash into a truck
filled with breakfast buffet
we were getting the breakfast specials
at berts when we got your message
and we boxed them up
and rode in with their emanations
i like their pumpernickel toast
they get it fresh from jeanettes
bakery across the way
clears throat
theres an issue with the bust
you two made this morning
whos complaining
civilian saw you out on the fire escape
vasquez was armed and a threat
we did what was
theres a video
sighs
youve seen it
i have its not terrible
certainly could be much much better
sound is shit
civilian was too far away
to get anything intelligible
that helps us
who tipped you off
my contact at channel 7
both sigh
anchovies
whens it airing
600
youll survive
though
i think itll end our current discussions
about raises and promotions
sighs anchovies
we didnt give vasquez
that much castiron
it was mostly me anthony
he gave him plenty
mr lurasettis in that video too
smiling like a yearbook picture
when you put your foot
on that hombres cabeza
our inspector
our mexicanamerican inspector
is unlikely to be lenient
though your productivity is exemplary and
itll keep you from losing your badges
politics like always
like cell phones and just as annoying
politics are everywhere
being branded a racist
in todays public forum
is like being accused
of communism in the 50s
whether its a possibly offensive remark
made in a private phone call
or the indelicate treatment of a minority
who sells drugs to children
the entertainment industry formerly known
as the news needs villains
theres certainly nothing hypocritical
about the media
handling every perceived intolerance
with complete and utter intolerance
sighs its bullshit
but its reality
but im not racist
every martin luther king day
i order a cup of dark roast
how long is this suspension gonna be
six weeks
no pay
we need the hours
i know what detectives make in bulwark
heavy sigh
go have some pumpernickel
ridgeman
gotta be aware of this stuff
digital eyes are everywhere
i do what i think best when im out there
i was that way when we were partners
and im still that way now
theres a reason im sitting
behind this desk running things
and youre out there
crouching on fire escapes
in the cold for hours
with a partner
thats 20 years younger than you
hey anthonys got a mouth
with its own engine but hes solid
that wasnt my point
heavy sigh
thanks for letting us know
about this situation
and any word you can have
with the inspector on our behalf
would be greatly appreciated
one thing before you go
i watched that video a couple times
you threw a lot more castiron
than you needed to
and when we worked together
you werent that rough
and
its not healthy for you
to scuff concrete as long as you have
you get results
but youre losing perspective
and compassion
couple more years out there
and youre gonna be
a human steamroller covered with spikes
and fueled by bile
theres a lot of imbeciles out there
yeah
use your time off to think about things
talk it over with melanie
spend some time with her and sara
yeah i will
i wont
i wont
woman sara
yeah mom its me
sweetie
whats wrong
sweetie
come here
good evening

about saying yes when im on my knee
this will nudge her
in the right direction
i got an issue at work
do you need a payment plan
id be more than happy to
thanks
i saved enough for this
its a different kind of problem
my wife has two brothers
who are therapists
and three sisters who are lawyers
well my problems dont require
those kinds of professionals
i just
im thinking about the kind of future
i can offer my girlfriend and you know
that life wont have a lot of diamonds
you must be ready by tomorrow night
okay
you gotta be careful around these parts
its got lions

well yeah but its gonna be pretty hard
unless you have a pumpaction shotgun
well how do we get one oh shit

lion growls
okay stay there
nigga iced that feline
okay look we gotta go
theres more coming

but they was moved up
you already got our advances
plus andrei already vouched for them
andrei himself is questionable
you got our insurance
in the glove compartment
glove compartment opens
rustling
whyd you want them wrapped in cellophane
sometimes a nigga aint got time
for gloves
or to wipe things down
yeah i hope we dont need to use those
well stash them in the vehicles
when we get the chance
the van and the getaway
its all cotton candy
the two detectives were filmed by
a concerned bulwark citizen this morning
both partners have been suspended
brett ridgeman was charged
with excessive force in 1998 and 2004
and anthony lurasetti
was suspended for violating
the code of conduct last year
the police commissioner
has declined to comment
door entry chime

whats that about
some kids were menacing sara
on her way back from the bus
and one of them threw
a cup of orange soda all over her
what kids
the ones she didnt recognize
four blacks one on a bike
though does it actually matter who
thats the fifth time
this fucking neighborhood
it just keeps getting worse and worse
is she okay
well yeah
but coming home from school and walking
four blocks shouldnt be an ordeal
no it shouldnt
did you offer to pick her up at the bus
escort her back
of course i did
she knows it isnt easy for me
to get around a lot of the time
and shed be too embarrassed anyways
well shes got two sets of cop dna
so of course shes tough
yeah especially for her age and gender
but shes getting older more womanly
and these boys are gonna start
having different kinds of ideas
about her pretty soon
if they dont already
you know i never thought i was a racist
before living in this area
im about as liberal
as any excop could ever be but now
we really need to move
i know
no yesterday or the day before
i know
well this thing thats going on
with you and anthony right now
its not gonna help
you saw the vasquez footage
i did
and
its really time
you got a new windbreaker
yeah
a couple people made comments
well i was starting to say before
that i called up bulwark security provider
and i asked them
youre not doing security work
we need money to move
absolutely not
i can take painkillers if
no youre taking painkillers
to peel potatoes as it is
its not worth debating
but i wanna do something
i need to do something
as a mother as a former cop
or someday someday you and me
we are in a hospital room
with our daughter
talking to a rape counselor
yeah
ill handle this
how
theres a way
but its not something
that were gonna talk about
ever
okay
sara
yeah
that show about the lion cubs is on
if you wanna watch it with me
if youd rather read thats you know
no its fine

for the past 20 minutes anyway
hey you want something to nibble

yeah im fine
hey
hey

soul music on radio
sighs

or freddie if he prefers
and who can i say is
tell him ridgeman is here
ill go and see if hes available
he is
how much are these i dont see a tag
woman 5000
so theyre bulletproof
you care for a drink
im not here for a beverage
please
youre looking for a new suit
now that you have violently
earned some leisure time
im not
why then have you decided
to inhabit my shop this evening
hows your son doing
well very well
his mother and i
are taking him to visit
some campuses next month
he scored very high on his tests
i thought he had potential
thank you
i know that youre not inclined
towards exceptions
well he was a kid
the ringleaders are in jail
i knew i could get something
more valuable from you someday
if i let him slip through a crack
how can i be of aid
i need a lead
and what are you hoping to find
a dealer or a buyer
preferably one from out of town
i am not as wellinformed as i once was
call someone that is
i shall
now
anthony yeah
be outside my place at 430
yup am
bring all your hardware
and dress nonchalant
cell phone vibrates
are you the famous police officer
i saw in the news
any reason youre back there
there is
things okay with you and melanie
theyre fine
are you gonna tell me
the nature of this endeavor
im gonna sleep
what are we here
youre gonna drive to 19th and brant
why are we going all the way up there
every answer i give you is gonna engender
three times as many questions
let me sleep while i can and
once were there youll get your answers
and a nap if you need one
sounds like a stakeout
19th and brant
you realize were suspended
wake me at 18th
ridgeman snores
were at 18th
corner right
before you touch anything
ashtray
one of these big orange things
opened up by my apartment
ripe and fresh
its shit
i havent been in it
i thought denise cooked
only at her place
she only shops at organic stores
that specialize in assuaging guilt
lets pull in the other side
of this dumpster
this is good
its perfect
take two
somethings going on in room 633
of that tan stucco
what
hard to tell
especially because apartment 633
doesnt even exist
how do you mean
well theres no door marked 633
theres no windows or a buzzer
no mail gets delivered there either
but its there
this is sounding metaphysical
you got a tip on this
yeah
my contact tells me
that one lorentz vogelmann
is looking for an invisible residence
and 633 in this tan stucco
is where he landed
vogelmann i dont know that name
well hes not local
what line of work is he in
distribution
heroin mostly large bundles
scoffs
what are we doing here
you asking me this question as a civilian
because thats what we are right now
civilians
no different than kindergarten teachers
or the bum that collects aluminum cans
outside my building
i know where i flung my badge yesterday
what are we doing here
were monitoring a suspicious individual
to try and figure out if hes got
any money he doesnt need
sighs
anchovies
if you dont wanna be part of this
christ
are you insane
you get suspended not for the first time
in your career either
now you decide to become a criminal
and what the hell
are you even thinking with this
well
say something
talk
im a month away from my 60th
im still the same rank i was at 27
for a lot of years
i believed that the quality of my work
what we do together
what i did with my previous partners
would get me what i deserved
but i dont politic
and i dont change with the times
and it turns out that that shits
more important than good honest work
so yesterday
after we stop a massive amount of drugs
from getting into the school system
we get suspended
because it wasnt done politely
then i go home and i find
my daughter has been assaulted
for the fifth time in two years
because of the shit neighborhood
my shit wages force me to live in
and my wife cant help
shes barely getting through the day
on her meds as it is
they okay
yeah melanies coping saras doing okay
shes dealing with it better
than most kids her age would
but who knows what kind of
longterm damage is going on with her
theres been opportunities before
more than a few
take a bribe
pocket a bundle pilfer cash
i was a cop on active duty today
im a poor civilian whos nearly 60
i can accept that but im not gonna ask
my wife and daughter to
if we put all our collars together
every imbecile we ever nabbed
itd probably fill two entire wings
of the state prison maybe three
we have the skills and the right
to acquire proper compensation
sighs
christ
weddings arent cheap
dont be an asshole
thats not what im thinking about
do you think our wages
accurately reflect what we
enough with the justifications
im smarter than you by a yardstick
youre not gonna manipulate me
i saw how you looked
at that duffel bag yesterday
quiet
let me think
anchovies
look if you dont wanna
hear any more about this
fling the gear and drop me off
i dont want you to get hurt
i dont need a guardian
i can do this myself if i have to
you dont know that
not for sure no
but if things get tricky
ill disengage and find something else
this is a bad idea
its bad for you and its bad for me
its bad like lasagne in a can
well then fling the gear
and drop me off
look if you do this
you do it for yourself
you dont do it
because you pity my situation
or because were partners
or because were friends
that grill burgers on sundays
or go to the fights
you do it solely because you wanna earn
and thats it
we disguise ourselves
at the point of contact
yeah i got ballistic masks
and vests in the garbage bags
some teargas bombs as well
im in until im not
lorentz vogelmann
yeah
he looks castiron
he is
any idea if his merchandise is in 633
no idea
but after we confirm that hes there
well tail him
and well learn his itinerary
you got a time frame
my contact said
hes rented 633 for two weeks
were at day two of that period
you know anything else about him
vehicle associates
thats what were learning now
camera
thanks
camera beeps
why dont you take a nap
gladly
make sure to ask me
if im still in when i wake up
car horn honking
lurasetti groans
ive been processing here for five hours
you should have given me a nudge
there wasnt a reason to
are you still in
i am until im not
you see vogelmann yet
nope
im gonna get something
from this big orange thing
you want egg salad on rye toast
two of them and root beer
mmmhmm
mmm
amen
ive been listening to and smelling that
for the last 98 minutes
best part of a stakeout
other than when it ends
is when youre eating
a single red ant couldve eaten it faster
nope
loud sigh
take two
im still enjoying the aftertaste
not all of us are
where did you park
ive been telling you
youre getting senile
you didnt lock it
i forg
i was thinking about something else
at the time sorry
this your duffel
i dont think so
face the windshield
put on your seat belts and lock the doors
paco
put up that sunshade por favor
good now empty your pockets
put everything in that duffel bag
or youll be painting houses in heaven
no please
you have five seconds
four
three
thats all i got
me too i swear to god
show me your pocket whites
see
shut off that phone
bye
i expected you
youll f
airless
please allow me to show you the interior
if anything moves in there
a rat a mouse
a baby mosquito
youll get to ring allahs doorbell
metal slides
pop the hood
door slides
clank
door slides
slow footsteps
all is as expected
the blood is gratis
keys
shower running
melanie brett that you
confirmed
look in the closet i got you something
try it on
everything you get me fits perfect
thanks for getting it
thank me in bed
snores
soft music in background
so did you guys beat up
any minorities today
thats only when were on the clock
this was really delicious
glad you liked it
and should i infer from your reticence
this is one of those times
you cant talk about your work
please infer by my reticence
even though youve been suspended
and youre technically a civilian
criminals dont stop doing what they do
just cause two cops get benched
and we dont do what we do
just for the paycheck
what
dont try and bluff somebody
whos smarter than you are
smarter by a yardstick
did you see i brought cannolis
from fiorenzos
just dont do anything
to jeopardize your career please
i wont
seven unaccounted for
if vogelmanns in that tan stucco
and owns a vehicle one of them is his
are you still in
at the outermost edge
denise
she guessed that something wasnt right
i didnt say anything
so
picked up the engagement ring
from feinbaum
yeah
okay
got it the day we busted
uh vasquez and
well the timing wasnt great but
i was gonna propose anyway
i wasnt gonna let some
work bullshit interfere
with my private life but turned out
she was in a bad mood that night
because of some drama at her job
and i didnt do it
and then yesterday you bring me here
suggest this thing
and im sort of okay with the idea
us taking money off some fuckhead dealer
if the risk isnt too great
but you know that night
when i see denise
even before she suspected anything
i know that i cant propose to her
until this thing is done
i evade her questions at dinner
and for the first time
since i went to the jeweler
im not certain shed say yes
if i proposed
yeah im driving you home
i havent made a decision yet
im just pondering
bullshit youre decided
even if you think you arent
youre younger than me
youve got more options
request a new partner
when were back on duty
theyll probably make you
a sergeant one day
i dont want a new partner
and i told you
that id finish out the shift
yeah i appreciate it
but look youre not obligated
i have done it with
my word is an obligation
thanks
two egg salads
and ill pay for yours too
if its not soppressata
heres one
thats guest parking
these brothers have seen some stuff
yeah theyre tainted
think theyre with vogelmann
his buyers
twenty percent gobetweens
or local muscles probably more like it
and two root beers
ridgeman snoring
scoffs
thuds
no choice
ridgeman
vogelmann
yeah
the black dudes we saw before
theyre going west
you sure
engine sputtering
the gray lady needs a decongestant
dont give em a wedgie
driving any slower than this
will get us noticed
i dont know this area real well
whats west
well more of this
then the turnpike
and then the school district
probably not doing all this
to steal crayons
you feel like some construction work
is that necessary right now
five percent
thats for shooting out tires sending
a warning things like that right
were not going after any presidents
i need a better answer than that
right now
were heading into new territory
foggy gray landscape
but i know all of my limits
but maybe not yours
so before i build a killing instrument
that i last used in the army
i wanna hear that you dont plan
on executing a human being
to facilitate a robbery
were not executing anybody
that boundary is reinforced
in steel concrete
agreed now build
tires squeal
the carpool lane right by the black suv
dont let that catch a cold
think the transactions happening today
oh this is business
two tainted black dudes
and an outoftown convict
going for a drive before dawn
although its probably just a preliminary
vogelmann was carrying
two black briefcases when he got in
is there anything else
you forgot to tell me
no
no are you sure
something subtle like maybe
one of the black dudes had a bazooka
hey
i was up for hours listening
to you process air it escaped me
sighs fine
and i suppose you could have let me
sleep through all of this
and been done with the whole thing
i definitely should have
considering the briefcases
70 percent this is the transaction
whats the other 30
vogelmann maybe showing somebody
some cash or some merchandise
depending on which end
of the deal hes doing
the briefcases
the financial district
whats going on here
any idea
im trying to flush the ideas i have
cause none of them seem to fit this
still under construction
want me to mail or handdeliver
your genius award
nice
real stylish
youre saying this before
you use your gay hair shit
cant say it after
time for a walkby
at 545
why is that
well the nearest most likely
time for a meet up is 530
and we should allow the other party
room for tardiness
unless vogelmann is 19 minutes late
possible but not probable
and im doing the walkby myself
i usually
youre barely here as it is
any and every bigger risk
we come upon is mine to take
spraying
coughs
ill do you first
dont make no mess of it
scoffs
i used to graffiti back in the day
and i remember what it looked like
you were no better yourself
you know that
i was only doing tags
you was the one trying to make art
nigga painted a pit bull
everybody thought was a turtle
car door opens closes
sighs
nothing
how about getting on a nearby roof
for a better vantage
not worth the exposure
or the risk of us getting split up
in case things get urgent

its a robbery until somebody
turns it into something worse

those italian emotions are saying plenty
you go to hell you heartless fuck
i never saw that opera

it wasnt a routine drug deal
it was already too late
you could have called it in
when the van left the parking garage
put the bulwark pd on alert
we didnt
the chance of that accomplishing anything
in the 16minute interim
less than 50 percent or even 25
you wanna call the bulwark pd
the state police the feds
let them handle it go ahead
but that van and the cutthroats inside
theyll be vapor

lurasetti dont be an asshole
theyre rolling bunkers on airless tires
remove the stomach
so that the key doesnt fall
into his entrails
i will
think theyre cops
not unless theyre crooked ones
looking for the gold
i suspect these men are slims associates
gunshot ricochets
just stay focused on your work
this duo isnt properly armed
for an engagement with us
its the pale sac in there
the one that looks like
i know which one it is
careful not to pop his liver

very unpleasant instructions
that will go to our associates
unless you do exactly
what we tell you to do
lurasetti the drip has become a trickle
ridgeman yeah i got ears
lurasetti im concerned
should we make an announcement
say were cops
no
that will increase the likelihood
of a hostage situation by 60 percent
hey

were just here for the gold thats it
leave the bullion where it is
and come on out
well let you walk away

gunshot
henry the next bullet aint a warning
that bulletproof vest

even got you when you took off your mask
so ask
what do the bulwark pd know
nigga
likewise
lets talk through this
make some words
we should clean up this mess together
and split the gold
we can fight each other some more
do this until were crippled or dead
or we can both be rich
i dont see how this is a dilemma
trusting a cop
one thats crooked as fuck
is the dilemma
only thing absolutely certain about you
is that you dont give a shit
about any oath you swear to
my daughter got assaulted
