   knocking

if you happen to recall 
man  you wanna get your fucking foot   
   cracking 
   groans  shit 
  there s something on your boot 
  yeah  i noticed  what s her name 
  rosalinda 
  that sounds like two names 
  at least 
  yeah  well  it s just one 
you re completely sure
there s only one woman in there 
just one  man  it s just her 
rosalinda 
this is the bulwark police 
i need you to open that door
and come out with your hands up 
rosalinda  are you in there 
rosalinda speaks english 
yeah  yeah  but she got
a problem with her ears  man 
  is she deaf 
  she wears something  man 
to make her hear better
but not when she goes to sleep though 
he looks like a snorer 
yeah  it s called sleep apnea  man 
she got a firearm in there 
no gun  man  but she got some pepper spray
in her purse  so  you know   
  oh  come on  come on  man 
  this will be snug 
shit  that s cutting off my circulation 
we ll be back before your foot turns blue 
probably 
a lot nicer than my place 
even the smell 
we ve met davids 
  officer 
   second man  detective 
you dove deep on this plumber thing 
i ve got a cousin who plumbs 
vasquez is shackled 
on the fire escape 
his deaf girlfriend s in here 
you guys gonna shoot her 
  she s got a gun 
  75 percent chance  yeah 
all right  where do you want me 
window 
should ve let the plumber in 
 whispers  one  two   
police  okay 
comprende  siono 
that handbag seemed a little heavy 
even taking into account
the amount of makeup latina s carry 
yeah  even still 
she s got a gun 
 gasps 
come on  come on  honey 
you stay there 
why don t you shut the doors
and crank up the fans 
where did your novio put
that green duffel bag you got last night 
can i have something to wear 
i m cold 
i didn t understand that  did you 
no 
sounded kind of like dolphin 
i expect she ll get more intelligible
when she answers our questions 
  where s the green duffel bag 
  i wanna call a lawyer 
i wanna     stutters 
where s the green duffel bag 
we saw vasquez bring it here
last night at 11 00 
that swell guy who fled
and left you here with us 
  least he had time   
   ball rolls 
to get his soul mate 
tell us where it is 
and my partner and i will be done in time
to get the breakfast special at bert s 
maybe that s reason enough to forget
all about you and that gun of yours 
where is it 
the closet 
there 
in the wall behind the suits 
i smell three eggs over easy 
hash browns   
and pumpernickel toast 
plus that coffee you owe me 
  officer 
   davids  detective 
drag vasquez back inside 
we got cash  narcotics  and two imbeciles
to drive downtown and paper 
you said if i told you where the bag was 
you ll let me go 
  can you understand her 
  no 
j we can be considerate j
j to people or strangers j
j until you get to know them
this a guy or a girl singing this song 
j yeah j
j it s raining so hard outside  
j before you go
i ll give you my favorite umbrella  
j to keep you dry
can t tell 
j would you like to have    i
not that there s much of a difference
these days 
i think that line was obliterated   
the day men started saying 
 we re pregnant  
when their wives were 
your breakfast specials 
thanks 
   cell phone vibrates 
   cell phone chimes 
didn t know the chief lieutenant
was so fond of intrigue 
excuse me 
could you box our food up
in to go containers 
you want me to pack up
everything i just carried
  from all the way over there 
  correct 
i ll get some take out boxes 
you two crash into a truck
filled with breakfast buffet 
we were getting the breakfast specials
at bert s when we got your message
and we boxed them up
and rode in with their emanations 
i like their pumpernickel toast 
they get it fresh from jeanette s 
bakery across the way 
 clears throat 
there s an issue with the bust
you two made this morning 
who s complaining 
civilian  saw you out on the fire escape 
vasquez was armed and a threat 
  we did what was   
  there s a video 
 sighs 
you ve seen it 
i have  it s not terrible 
certainly could be much  much better 
sound is shit 
civilian was too far away
to get anything intelligible 
  that helps us 
  who tipped you off 
my contact at channel 7 
 both sigh 
anchovies 
  when s it airing 
  6 00 
you ll survive 
though 
i think it ll end our current discussions
about raises and promotions 
 sighs  anchovies 
we didn t give vasquez
that much cast iron 
  it was mostly me  anthony   
  he gave him plenty 
mr  lurasetti s in that video  too 
smiling like a yearbook picture
when you put your foot
on that hombre s cabeza 
our inspector   
our mexican american inspector 
is unlikely to be lenient 
though your productivity is exemplary and
it ll keep you from losing your badges 
politics  like always 
like cell phones and just as annoying 
politics are everywhere 
being branded a racist
in today s public forum
is like being accused
of communism in the  50s   
whether it s a possibly offensive remark
made in a private phone call
or the indelicate treatment of a minority
who sells drugs to children 
the entertainment industry  formerly known
as the news  needs villains 
there s certainly nothing hypocritical
about the media
handling every perceived intolerance
with complete and utter intolerance 
 sighs  it s bullshit 
but it s reality 
but i m not racist 
every martin luther king day 
i order a cup of dark roast 
how long is this suspension gonna be 
six weeks 
no pay 
we need the hours 
i know what detectives make in bulwark 
 heavy sigh 
go have some pumpernickel 
ridgeman 
gotta be aware of this stuff 
digital eyes are everywhere 
i do what i think best when i m out there 
i was that way when we were partners 
and i m still that way now 
there s a reason i m sitting
behind this desk running things
and you re out there
crouching on fire escapes
in the cold for hours
with a partner
that s 20 years younger than you 
hey  anthony s got a mouth
with its own engine  but he s solid 
that wasn t my point 
 heavy sigh 
thanks for letting us know
about this situation 
and any word you can have
with the inspector on our behalf
would be greatly appreciated 
one thing before you go 
i watched that video a couple times 
you threw a lot more cast iron
than you needed to 
and when we worked together   
you weren t that rough 
and 
it s not healthy for you
to scuff concrete as long as you have 
you get results 
but you re losing perspective
and compassion 
couple more years out there
and you re gonna be
a human steamroller covered with spikes   
and fueled by bile 
there s a lot of imbeciles out there 
yeah 
use your time off to think about things 
talk it over with melanie 
spend some time with her and sara 
yeah  i will 
i won t 
i won t 
 woman  sara 
yeah  mom  it s me 
sweetie 
what s wrong

good evening 
and welcome back  mr  lurasetti 
anybody born in new york

  tony  it is 
one moment  please 
is something wrong with it  tony 
no  no  it s beautiful 
exactly like you promised 
it s    if denise has any doubts
about saying yes when i m on my knee 
this will nudge her
in the right direction 
i got an issue at work 
do you need a payment plan 
  i d be more than happy to   
  thanks 
i saved enough for this 
it s a different kind of problem 
my wife has two brothers
who are therapists
and three sisters who are lawyers 
well  my problems don t require
those kinds of professionals 
i just   
i m thinking about the kind of future
i can offer my girlfriend and  you know 
that life won t have a lot of diamonds 
you must be ready by tomorrow night 
okay 
you gotta be careful around these parts 
it s got lions 
can we shoot them 
well  yeah  but it s gonna be pretty hard
unless you have a pump action shotgun 
  well  how do we get one    oh  shit 
   video game sounds 
  okay  look  get behind me 
   lion growls 
okay  stay there 
nigga iced that feline 
okay  look  we gotta go 
there s more coming 
okay  once you get across this stream 
we gotta look out for boa constrictors 
this nigga s ready for a real safari 
even if my legs worked all right 
i wouldn t wanna be
hunting animals for real 
it s like some rich  white people shit 
still  you re real good at this game 
and the other ones we played  too 
well  yeah  this is what i wanna do
when i grow up 
  play games 
  no  no  be a game designer 
create worlds that are 
you know  different from the outside 
there s schools that teach you
how to do that 
  college or something 
  yeah  they got schools 
maybe once you finish high school 
you can   
   cell phone vibrates 
   pauses game 
i gotta go

yeah  i can save it 
all right 
 music plays on radio 
his cousins are gonna be there this time 
yeah  they are 
i don t like doing things
with so many question marks everywhere 
yeah  me neither 
but they was moved up 
you already got our advances 
plus  andrei already vouched for them 
andrei himself is questionable 
you got our insurance 
in the glove compartment 
   glove compartment opens 
   rustling 
why d you want them wrapped in cellophane 
sometimes a nigga ain t got time
for gloves   
or to wipe things down 
yeah  i hope we don t need to use those 
we ll stash them in the vehicles
when we get the chance 
the van and the getaway 
it s all cotton candy 
the two detectives were filmed by
a concerned bulwark citizen this morning 
both partners have been suspended 
brett ridgeman was charged
with excessive force in 1998 and 2004 
and anthony lurasetti
was suspended for violating
the code of conduct last year 
the police commissioner
has declined to comment   
 door entry chime 
you ve got five seconds
to hand me your drawer 
okay  okay 
one   
two   
   tapping keys 
   beeping 
three

 theme music on tv 
 woman  shoes 
i forgot 
  hey 
  hey 
  want a beer 
  no  thanks 
i had to take some extra meds today 
i m sorry to hear that 
you okay 
fair 
what s that about 
some kids were menacing sara
on her way back from the bus
and one of them threw
a cup of orange soda all over her 
  what kids 
  the ones she didn t recognize 
four blacks  one on a bike 
though does it actually matter who 
that s the fifth time 
this fucking neighborhood 
it just keeps getting worse and worse 
  is she okay 
  well  yeah 
but coming home from school and walking
four blocks shouldn t be an ordeal 
no  it shouldn t 
did you offer to pick her up at the bus 
escort her back 
of course i did 
she knows it isn t easy for me
to get around a lot of the time 
and she d be too embarrassed anyways 
well  she s got two sets of cop dna 
so of course she s tough 
yeah  especially for her age and gender 
but she s getting older  more womanly 
and these boys are gonna start
having different kinds of ideas
about her pretty soon 
if they don t already 
you know  i never thought i was a racist
before living in this area 
i m about as liberal
as any ex cop could ever be  but now   
  we really need to move 
  i know 
no  yesterday or the day before 
i know 
well  this thing that s going on
with you and anthony right now 
  it s not gonna help 
  you saw the vasquez footage 
  i did 
  and 
it s really time
you got a new windbreaker 
yeah 
a couple people made comments 
well  i was starting to say before
that i called up bulwark security provider
and i asked them   
you re not doing security work 
we need money to move 
absolutely not 
  i can take painkillers if   
  no  you re taking painkillers
to peel potatoes as it is 
it s not worth debating 
but i wanna do something 
i need to do something
as a mother  as a former cop 
or someday  someday you and me 
we are in a hospital room
with our daughter
talking to a rape counselor 
yeah 
i ll handle this 
how 
there s a way 
but it s not something
that we re gonna talk about   
ever 
okay 
  sara 
  yeah 
that show about the lion cubs is on 
if you wanna watch it with me 
  if you d rather read  that s  you know   
  no  it s fine 
uh    been staring at the same page
for the past 20 minutes anyway 
  hey  you want something to nibble 
  sure 
are you okay with what happened 
yeah  i m fine 
hey 
hey 
  do you want a cookie 
  no  thank you 
they re so cute before they get big 
i got an errand to run 
be back in a couple hours 
 soul music on radio 
 sighs 
i m here to talk with friedrich 
or freddie  if he prefers 
  and who can i say is   
  tell him ridgeman is here 
  i ll go and see if he s available 
  he is 
how much are these  i don t see a tag 
 woman   5 000 
so they re bulletproof 
you care for a drink 
i m not here for a beverage 
please 
you re looking for a new suit 
now that you have violently
earned some leisure time 
i m not 
why then have you decided
to inhabit my shop this evening 
how s your son doing 
well  very well 
his mother and i
are taking him to visit
some campuses next month 
  he scored very high on his tests 
  i thought he had potential 
thank you 
i know that you re not inclined
towards exceptions 
well  he was a kid 
the ringleaders are in jail 
i knew i could get something
more valuable from you someday
if i let him slip through a crack 
  how can i be of aid 
  i need a lead 
and what are you hoping to find 
a dealer  or a buyer 
preferably one from out of town 
i am not as well informed as i once was 
call someone that is 
i shall 
now 
anthony  yeah 
be outside my place at 4 30 
yup  a m 
bring all your hardware
and dress nonchalant 
 cell phone vibrates 
are you the famous police officer
i saw in the news 
any reason you re back there 
there is 
  things okay with you and melanie 
  they re fine 
are you gonna tell me
the nature of this endeavor 
i m gonna sleep 
  what are we here   
  you re gonna drive to 19th and brant 
why are we going all the way up there 
every answer i give you is gonna engender
three times as many questions 
let me sleep while i can  and
once we re there  you ll get your answers
and a nap if you need one 
sounds like a stakeout 
19th and brant 
you realize we re suspended 
wake me at 18th 
 ridgeman snores 
we re at 18th 
corner right 
before you touch anything 
ashtray 
one of these big orange things
opened up by my apartment 
ripe and fresh 
  it s shit 
  i haven t been in it 
i thought denise cooked 
only at her place 
she only shops at organic stores
that specialize in assuaging guilt 
let s pull in the other side
of this dumpster 
  this is good 
  it s perfect 
take two 
something s going on in room 633
of that tan stucco 
what 
hard to tell 
especially because apartment 633
doesn t even exist 
how do you mean 
well  there s no door marked 633 
there s no windows or a buzzer 
no mail gets delivered there either 
but it s there 
this is sounding metaphysical 
you got a tip on this 
yeah 
my contact tells me
that one lorentz vogelmann
is looking for an invisible residence 
and 633 in this tan stucco
is where he landed 
vogelmann  i don t know that name 
well  he s not local 
what line of work is he in 
distribution 
heroin  mostly  large bundles 
 scoffs 
what are we doing here 
you asking me this question as a civilian 
because that s what we are right now 
civilians 
no different than kindergarten teachers
or the bum that collects aluminum cans
outside my building 
i know where i flung my badge yesterday 
what are we doing here 
we re monitoring a suspicious individual
to try and figure out if he s got
any money he doesn t need 
 sighs 
anchovies 
  if you don t wanna be part of this   
  christ 
are you insane 
you get suspended  not for the first time
in your career either 
now you decide to become a criminal 
and what the hell
are you even thinking with this 
well 
say something 
talk 
i m a month away from my 60th 
i m still the same rank i was at 27 
for a lot of years 
i believed that the quality of my work 
what we do together 
what i did with my previous partners   
would get me what i deserved 
but i don t politic 
and i don t change with the times 
and it turns out that that shit s
more important than good  honest work 
so yesterday 
after we stop a massive amount of drugs
from getting into the school system 
we get suspended
because it wasn t done politely 
then i go home and i find
my daughter has been assaulted
for the fifth time in two years   
because of the shit neighborhood
my shit wages force me to live in 
and my wife can t help 
she s barely getting through the day
on her meds as it is 
they okay 
yeah  melanie s coping  sara s doing okay 
she s dealing with it better
than most kids her age would 
but who knows what kind of
long term damage is going on with her 
there s been opportunities before 
more than a few 
take a bribe 
pocket a bundle  pilfer cash 
i was a cop on active duty  today 
i m a poor civilian who s nearly 60 
i can accept that  but i m not gonna ask
my wife and daughter to 
if we put all our collars together 
every imbecile we ever nabbed 
it d probably fill two entire wings
of the state prison  maybe three 
we have the skills and the right
to acquire proper compensation 
 sighs 
  christ 
  weddings aren t cheap 
don t be an asshole 
that s not what i m thinking about 
do you think our wages
accurately reflect what we   
enough with the justifications 
i m smarter than you by a yardstick 
you re not gonna manipulate me 
i saw how you looked
at that duffel bag yesterday 
quiet 
let me think 
anchovies 
look  if you don t wanna
hear any more about this 
fling the gear and drop me off 
  i don t want you to get hurt 
  i don t need a guardian 
  i can do this myself if i have to 
  you don t know that 
not for sure  no 
but if things get tricky 
i ll disengage and find something else 
this is a bad idea 
it s bad for you  and it s bad for me 
it s    bad like lasagne in a can 
well  then  fling the gear
and drop me off 
look  if you do this 
you do it for yourself 
you don t do it
because you pity my situation 
or because we re partners
or because we re friends
that grill burgers on sundays
or go to the fights 
you do it solely because you wanna earn 
and that s it 
we disguise ourselves
at the point of contact 
yeah  i got ballistic masks
and vests in the garbage bags 
some teargas bombs as well 
i m in until i m not 
  lorentz vogelmann 
  yeah 
  he looks cast iron 
  he is 
any idea if his merchandise is in 633 
no idea 
but after we confirm that he s there 
we ll tail him
and we ll learn his itinerary 
you got a time frame 
my contact said
he s rented 633 for two weeks 
we re at day two of that period 
you know anything else about him 
vehicle  associates 
that s what we re learning now 
camera  
thanks 
 camera beeps 
why don t you take a nap 
gladly 
make sure to ask me
if i m still in when i wake up 
   car horn honking 
   lurasetti groans 
i ve been processing here for five hours 
  you should have given me a nudge 
  there wasn t a reason to 
are you still in 
i am until i m not 
  you see vogelmann yet 
  nope 
i m gonna get something
from this big orange thing 
you want egg salad on rye toast 
two of them  and root beer 
mmm hmm 
mmm 
amen 
i ve been listening to and smelling that
for the last 98 minutes 
best part of a stakeout 
other than when it ends   
is when you re eating 
a single red ant could ve eaten it faster 
nope 
 loud sigh 
take two 
i m still enjoying the aftertaste 
not all of us are 
where did you park 
i ve been telling you 
you re getting senile 
you didn t lock it 
i forg   
i was thinking about something else
at the time  sorry

i don t think so 
face the windshield 
put on your seat belts and lock the doors 
paco   
put up that sunshade  por favor 
good  now empty your pockets 
put everything in that duffel bag 
or you ll be painting houses in heaven 
no  please

shut off that phone 
bye 
i expected you

airless 
please  allow me to show you the interior

 metal slides 
pop the hood 
 door slides 
 clank 
 door slides 
 slow footsteps 
all is as expected 
the blood is gratis 
keys 
 shower running 
 melanie  brett  that you 
confirmed 
look in the closet  i got you something 
try it on 
everything you get me fits perfect 
thanks for getting it 
thank me in bed 
 snores 
 soft music in background 
so  did you guys beat up
any minorities today 
that s only when we re on the clock 
  this was really delicious 
  glad you liked it 
and should i infer from your reticence
this is one of those times
you can t talk about your work 
please  infer by my reticence 
even though you ve been suspended 
and you re technically a civilian 
criminals don t stop doing what they do
just  cause two cops get benched 
and we don t do what we do
just for the paycheck 
what 
don t try and bluff somebody
who s smarter than you are 
smarter by a yardstick 
did you see i brought cannolis
from fiorenzo s 
just don t do anything
to jeopardize your career  please 
i won t 
seven unaccounted for 
if vogelmann s in that tan stucco
and owns a vehicle  one of them is his 
are you still in 
at the outermost edge 
denise 
she guessed that something wasn t right 
i didn t say anything 
so 
picked up the engagement ring 
  from feinbaum 
  yeah 
okay 
got it the day we busted 
uh  vasquez and   
well  the timing wasn t great  but   
i was gonna propose anyway 
i wasn t gonna let some   
work bullshit interfere
with my private life  but turned out   
she was in a bad mood that night
because of some drama at her job 
and i didn t do it 
and then yesterday you bring me here 
suggest this thing 
and i m sort of okay with the idea 
us taking money off some fuckhead dealer 
if the risk isn t too great 
but  you know  that night 
when i see denise 
even before she suspected anything   
i know that i can t propose to her
until this thing is done 
i evade her questions at dinner
and for the first time
since i went to the jeweler   
i m not certain she d say yes
if i proposed 
yeah  i m driving you home 
i haven t made a decision yet 
i m just pondering   
bullshit  you re decided 
even if you think you aren t 
you re younger than me 
you ve got more options 
request a new partner
when we re back on duty 
they ll probably make you
a sergeant one day 
i don t want a new partner 
and i told you
that i d finish out the shift 
yeah  i appreciate it 
but look  you re not obligated 
  i have done it with   
  my word is an obligation 
thanks 
two egg salads 
and i ll pay for yours  too 
if it s not soppressata 
here s one 
that s guest parking 
these brothers have seen some stuff 
yeah  they re tainted 
think they re with vogelmann 
his buyers 
twenty percent  go betweens 
or local muscles  probably more like it 
and two root beers 
 ridgeman snoring 
 scoffs 
 thuds 
no choice 
ridgeman 
  vogelmann 
  yeah 
the black dudes we saw before 
they re going west 
you sure 
 engine sputtering 
the gray lady needs a decongestant 
don t give  em a wedgie 
driving any slower than this
will get us noticed 
i don t know this area real well 
what s west 
well  more of this 
then the turnpike
and then the school district 
probably not doing all this
to steal crayons 
you feel like some construction work 
is that necessary right now 
five percent 
that s for shooting out tires  sending
a warning  things like that  right 
we re not going after any presidents 
i need a better answer than that 
right now 
we re heading into new territory 
foggy  gray landscape 
but i know all of my limits 
but maybe not yours 
so before i build a killing instrument
that i last used in the army 
i wanna hear that you don t plan
on executing a human being
to facilitate a robbery 
we re not executing anybody 
that boundary is reinforced
in steel concrete 
agreed  now  build 
 tires squeal 
the carpool lane  right by the black suv 
don t let that catch a cold 
think the transaction s happening today 
oh  this is business 
two tainted black dudes
and an out of town convict
going for a drive before dawn 
although it s probably just a preliminary 
vogelmann was carrying
two black briefcases when he got in 
is there anything else
you forgot to tell me 
  no 
  no  are you sure 
something subtle  like maybe
one of the black dudes had a bazooka 
hey 
i was up for hours listening
to you process air  it escaped me 
 sighs  fine 
and i suppose you could have let me
sleep through all of this 
and been done with the whole thing 
i definitely should have 
considering the briefcases   
70 percent this is the transaction 
what s the other 30 
vogelmann maybe showing somebody
some cash  or some merchandise 
depending on which end
of the deal he s doing 
the briefcases 
the financial district 
what s going on here 
any idea 
i m trying to flush the ideas i have
 cause none of them seem to fit this 
still under construction 
want me to mail or hand deliver
your genius award 
nice 
real stylish 
you re saying this before
you use your gay hair shit 
can t say it after 
time for a walk by 
at 5 45 
why is that 
well  the nearest most likely
time for a meet up is 5 30 
and we should allow the other party
room for tardiness 
unless vogelmann is 19 minutes late 
possible  but not probable 
and i m doing the walk by myself 
  i usually   
  you re barely here as it is 
any and every bigger risk
we come upon is mine to take 
 spraying 
 coughs 
i ll do you first 
don t make no mess of it 
 scoffs 
i used to graffiti back in the day 
and i remember what it looked like 
you were no better yourself 
you know that 
i was only doing tags 
you was the one trying to make art 
nigga painted a pit bull
everybody thought was a turtle 
 car door opens  closes 
 sighs 
nothing 
how about getting on a nearby roof
for a better vantage 
not worth the exposure 
or the risk of us getting split up 
in case things get urgent 
  this is a bad location for   
   vehicle approaches 
who the hell are those guys 
must have been here
since before vogelmann arrived 
 sighs 
it s them 
who 
the black dudes 
the ones who drove vogelmann 
  anchovies 
  crud 
any idea what s going on here 
evidently  these guys expect to be exposed
to people or a camera at some point 
that s the only way those disguises
make any sense 
what kind of job 
robbery 
kidnapping 
  murder 
  one or some of those  yeah 
ma am 
  you need some assistance 
   sighs 
sorry 
can you hold that 
please hold it  ma am 
jeffrey 
jeffrey  let me in

and every single sick day
staying here with jackson 
he needed me 
i m taking good care of him   
and i will continue to do so
until you re home from work 
 scoffs 
i hate you 
   sighs 
  and i love you twice as much 
you need to go to work    today 
 sobs 
my job is so stupid 
i go there and i sell chunks of my life
for a paycheck  so that   
rich people i ve never even met
can put money
in places i ve never even seen 
how am i supposed to sit at a stupid desk
and talk about bank accounts
when my baby is here 
 sobs 
jackson needs diapers   
and clothes and gourmet baby food 
eventually 
he s gonna need school supplies 
and if he s anything
like me and my brothers 
he ll need braces  too 
now  all these things cost money 
and you make way more than i do 
i know 
please get on the bus and go to work 
okay 
i m sorry i said i hate you 
that s all right 
i know what you really meant 
can i see him  though 
just through the opening 
i promise i ll go if you let me
see him just for a second 
 sighs 
  i need to touch him 
  kelly  please   
i    just for a second  i swear i ll go 
you ve broken that swear before
and recently 
do you swear on the life of our baby
that you will leave
after you ve touched him 
no  no  no

  yeah 
  welcome back 
  nice to see you 
  you too 
mrs  summer 
your absence was a weight upon us 
your return is a divine blessing 
it was just three months 
nevertheless  a doleful era 
you really shouldn t look that good
after having a baby 
thanks 
it s kind of annoying how good you look 
  thank you 
  i made cupcakes 
  oh  double chocolate 
  of course 
oh  yeah 
your husband helped me with that part 
a small token  a minuscule
manifestation of our affections 
mr  edmington  everybody  really 
thank you for this  really 
  it was really hard to leave the baby   
   truck braking 
any deliveries scheduled for today 
not that i m aware of 
everyone  listen 
hands up  and keep them there
or this man dies 
 electronic voice  keep your hands raised 
cooperate 
if you make any sudden moves 
you will be executed

everyone will be executed 
do not prioritize money
over having a heartbeat 
do you understand 
yes 
  mr  edmington 
  sir 
are there any employees in the back 
if so  get them right now 
you have 20 seconds 
no  there is no one in the back 
everyone is here in the front

you appear to be uncertain 
no  i m quite certain everyone is here
in the front of the bank 
we will accept this response 
if you are mistaken  your testicles
will be removed   
with this 
please 
let s not talk about anything rash 
everyone is here  as i said 
in the front   
you 
you seem honest and obedient 
handcuff every single person here 
except for the manager 
use these 
fasten their hands behind their backs 
tight 
do not say anything to anyone at any time
or you will be executed 
mr  edmington 
sir 
one of us will follow you to the vaults 
open them all 
i will open every vault
that i am capable of opening for you 
if our associate does not return
with gold bullion
in three minutes or less 
we will execute this woman 
 whimpers 
 clock ticking 
 low whisper  send it 
 groans 
will you make sure my baby gets this 
his name is jackson 
must have gone this way 
think they know we re following 
thirty percent 
though i m hoping they saw us
at brownvine 
you re hoping they saw us 
yeah  if they know they ve been spotted 
maybe they ll abort
whatever it is they got planned 
glad to hear your priorities changed 
well  if civilians are at risk 
they re the priority 
money or no money 
badge or no badge  you had doubts 
microscopic ones  if any  but   
good to hear things articulated 
trusted bank of north bulwark 
that isn t ambiguous 
is that an embrasure 
  what s an embrasure 
  see that opening 
the horizontal slit
above the word  security  
a guy s in there 
so it s a robbery 
yup 
we wait until they drive off 
yeah 
it s a robbery until somebody
turns it into something worse 
you looking to box them in 
pointlessly 
financial district on a weekday 
shouldn t engage them here 
you think they d go back
to the parking garage after this 
fifty percent 
fifty percent doesn t value anything
in a yes or no question 
hope this asshole doesn t get too curious 
 inaudible 
 the bank will reopen
in 15 minutes  come back then  
might have said 50  with a  y  
probably not 
this guy s like a cigarette commercial 
they re loading 
 van door slams 
   horns honking 
  christ 
   smacks door 
  christ 
we could have stopped this 
  are you gonna say anything 
  focus on that 
we let those people get killed 
you re not gonna say anything 
you don t have anything to say
about our culpability 
those italian emotions are saying plenty 
  you go to hell  you heartless fuck 
  i never saw that opera 
look  by the time we knew
it wasn t a routine drug deal 
  it was already too late 
  you could have called it in 
when the van left the parking garage 
put the bulwark pd on alert 
we didn t 
the chance of that accomplishing anything
in the 16 minute interim 
less than 50 percent or even 25 
you wanna call the bulwark pd 
the state police  the feds 
let them handle it  go ahead 
but that van  and the cutthroats inside 
they ll be vapor
before any enforcement agency can respond 
we re it 
you said you weren t gonna kill anyone
unless it was in self defense 
you gave us your word 
get on the interstate 
it was excessive what happened back there 
 cocks gun

 ridgeman  that s a variable
we didn t need 
start the party 
did you miss 
 lurasetti  don t be an asshole 
they re rolling bunkers on airless tires 
remove the stomach 
so that the key doesn t fall
into his entrails 
i will

looking for the gold 
i suspect these men are slim s associates 
 gunshot ricochets 
just stay focused on your work 
this duo isn t properly armed
for an engagement with us 
it s the pale sac in there 
the one that looks like   
i know which one it is 
careful not to pop his liver 
that is the worst smell in the world 
black guys  especially 
let s dump him and drive 
shells

very unpleasant instructions
that will go to our associates 
unless you do exactly
what we tell you to do 
 lurasetti  the drip has become a trickle 
 ridgeman  yeah  i got ears 
 lurasetti  i m concerned 
should we make an announcement 
  say we re cops 
  no 
that will increase the likelihood
of a hostage situation by 60 percent 
hey 
shitheads 
listen up 
this is the only deal you re gonna get 
we re just here for the gold  that s it 
leave the bullion where it is
and come on out

 gunshot 
 henry  the next bullet ain t a warning 
that bulletproof vest
you got there s real nice 
makes you look svelte 
like when a female puts on a girdle 
it s much more flattering
than that windbreaker
you wore on the news
when you stomped that mexican 
where did you spot me 
when you drove by the bank 
and twice when you was following
on the parkway 
what do you want 
stay right there

  so ask 
  what do the bulwark pd know   
  nigga 
  likewise 
let s talk through this 
make some words 
we should clean up this mess together
and split the gold 
we can fight each other some more 
do this until we re crippled or dead 
or we can both be rich 
i don t see how this is a dilemma 
trusting a cop   
one that s crooked as fuck 
is the dilemma 
only thing absolutely certain about you
is that you don t give a shit
about any oath you swear to 
my daughter got assaulted
for the fifth time two days ago 
my wife has multiple sclerosis
and can t even walk
half the time without a cane 
i need this

let s unload the guns together and slowly
so neither one of us is tempted 
a ight 
what we do with our friends 
can t leave them here 
but can t go bringing them
back with us neither
without exposing ourselves 
we bury them 
we didn t know they was
gonna grab no woman 
nobody was supposed to get shot
unless they pulled a gun on us 
that was the deal

 opens and closes glove compartments
