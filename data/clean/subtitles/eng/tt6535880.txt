i told all my friends
i would come right back 
they re right   
right back there 
in  um  the room with the fence 
so  do you think you could
come back with me 
let me get something 
i m really sorry 
harper 
for what 
i lost your mom s ring 
i was reaching through  and i
lost it in the haunted house 
it s okay 
i grew up in a haunted house 
i loved that house 
i hated it at the same time 
it s where my dad
would read to me   
   where he taught me
how to ride a bike 
it s where he hurt my mom 
i would go upstairs to my room 
and i would hide under the bed 
and one day 
while i was hiding  he   
   threw my mom
across the floor
like it was nothing  like   
that s how it s supposed to be 
i haven t been home
in four years 
but i have
this recurring dream where   
i go back
and knock at the door   
terrified that my dad s
gonna answer 
but my mom comes out 
she tells me he s gone forever 
she tells me the house
isn t haunted anymore 
come on  you almost
got it  you almost got it 
oh  i have to
take a break 
okay 
it s right there 
it s right there 
okay 
okay  you good  yeah  yeah  yeah 
all right 
i have to get my shoulder 
there  there 
all right  a little to the left 
a little bit to the left 
okay 
you re right there 
it s right there 
i feel like my cousin elina 
she s a proctologist 
how many fucking cousins
do you have 
46 
okay 
almost got it 
got it 
i got it 
okay  okay 
com on

angela 
what happened to your hand 
oh  we got to get her out 
yeah  what the fuck s
it look like i m doing 
i have keys  man 
where 
i m sorry  girls  this   
this isn t supposed to happen 
hey  look  man  we just
want to go  okay 
i don t need to talk
to your manager 
none of us do 
we haven t seen anything 
nothing happened 
we just want to leave 
we re gonna get out 
watch out 
the exit was this way 
over here 
fuck 
i fucking knew it 
read the door  idiot 
that makes sense 
i didn t remember there being
an exit there 
so  why wouldn t
you say something  
why don t we just crawl back
through the tunnel 
well  if you want to  but you
can only go one at a time 
there s a trap door
in the tunnel
that gets triggered if there s
too many people in there 
okay  why is there
a trap door in your tunnel 
we use it to capture people
and put them on the show 
there s this whole thing
with a witch   
yeah  we know about
your fucking show 
one of our friends is dead because of your fucking show 
she s not dead 
she s outside waiting
on you guys 
probably wondering
what s going on 
what 
look  we re a little
extreme here 
but safety is a huge priority 
don t you talk to me
about fucking safety 
don t you talk to me
about fucking safety 
what s your name 
what s your fucking name  
sir  my name s harper  okay 
we really appreciate your help 
but could you please
just tell us who you are 
you can call me  mitch  
thanks  mitch 
what s your last name  mitch 
okay  mitch 
i think we would feel a lot
more fucking comfortable
if you took off
that fucking mask   
yeah  lose the mask 
   and you told us
what your real name was 
i don t care which way you go 
but you re almost
at the end of the haunted house 
it s probably farther
if you go backwards 
yeah  i think we made it
pretty clear  mitch 
we don t want to go that way 
 kay 
wait  wait  wait 
why don t we just 
one at a time 
go back through the tunnel 
you really want to
go back in there 
i just want to get out of here 
okay  all right 
here s the plan 
i sort of remember my way
around the maze 
i ll take the lock box key 
i ll go through 
i ll book it to the front 
i ll get our phones 
and i ll call for help 
nate  let me get the key 
i dropped it 
well  that is
just perfect  nate 
fuck the key 
i can pick the lock box 
all right  so  i ll go first 
then we send bitch through 
and he can just chill
on the other side
and wait for everyone else 
then  nate  you go 
follow him with the poker 
you know  in case
mitch here forgets
whose team he s on 
and then bailey and angela 
 cause they need the most help 
and last goes harper 
one thing first 
i want your keys 
what key is it

spreading from the fool  
  weak and what you need 
nowhere as you bleed  
  and dead  i am the rat 
feast upon the cat  
  tender is the fur 
dying as you purr  
  dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches  
  i slam in the back
of my dragula  
  dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches  
  i slam in the back
of my dragula
