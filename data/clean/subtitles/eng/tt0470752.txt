hello 
hello 
caleb smith 
hey 
dude 
i ve been so looking forward
to this week with you 
come in  come on in 
thanks 
you want something to eat or
drink after your journey 
no  no  thanks  i m fine  sure 
yeah 
to be honest 
i thought we d have  uh 
breakfast together 
but  um   
i can t really
eat anything 
i got the mother of all
fucking hangovers  oh  yeah 
oh  my god  like you
wouldn t even believe 
when i have
a heavy night 
i  uh  compensate

you know 
yeah  sure 
was it a good party 
party 
yeah  wasn t there a party 
there wasn t a party 
sorry 
caleb  i m just gonna throw this
out there  so it s said  okay 
you re freaked out 
i am  yeah  you re freaked out 
by the helicopter
and the mountains
and the house 
because it s all
so super cool 
you re freaked out by me 
to be meeting me 
having this conversation in this
room  at this moment  right 
and i get that  i get the
moment you re having  but   
dude  can we just
get past that 
can we just be two guys 
nathan and caleb 
not the whole
employer employee thing 
yeah  okay 
yeah 
yes  uh  yeah 
it s good to
meet you  nathan 
it s good to
meet you  too  caleb 
i guess the first thing i
should do is explain your pass 
now  it s simple enough 
it opens some doors
and it doesn t open others 
and that just makes everything
easy for you  right 
uh  yes 
yeah   cause you re like   oh 
fuck  i m in someone else s house 
 can i do this 
can i do that  
and this card  it just
takes all that worry away 
if you try a door and it stays
shut  okay  it s off limits 
you try another door and it
opens  then it s for you 
let s try this one 
i guess
it s for you  caleb 
you like 
yeah 
it s your room 
you got a bed here 
a bathroom
right back here 
little desk 
cupboards 
little fridge 
cozy  right 
yeah  this is great 
what 
sorry 
there s something wrong 
what s wrong 
there s nothing wrong 
it s the windows 
you re thinking
there s no windows 
it s subterranean 
it s not cozy 
it s claustrophobic 
no  no way  i wasn t
thinking that 
i was thinking 
 this is really cool  
caleb  there s a reason there
are no windows in this room 
there is 
uh huh 
this building
isn t a house 
it s a research facility 
buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable
to reach the moon
and lasso it 
and i want to talk to you
about what i m researching 
i want to share it with you 
in fact  i want to share it with you
so much  it s eating me up inside 
but there s something i need
you to do for me first 
 blue book
non disclosure agreement  
hmm 
take your time 
read it over 
 the signee agrees
to regular data audit
 with unlimited access 
 to confirm that
no disclosure
 of information
has taken place
 in public
or private forums 
 using any means
of communication 
 including but not limited
 to that which is
disclosed orally
 or in written
or electronic form  
i think i need a lawyer 
it s standard  it doesn t
feel very standard 
okay  it s not standard 
what can i tell you  caleb 
you don t have to sign it 
you know  we can spend
the next few days
just shooting pool 
getting drunk together 
bonding 
and when you discover what you ve
missed out on  in about a year 
you re gonna regret it
for the rest of your life 
good call 
so 
do you know what
the turing test is 
yeah 
i know what
the turing test is 
it s when a human
interacts with a computer 
and if the human
doesn t know
they re interacting
with a computer 
the test is passed 
and what does
a pass tell us 
that the computer has
artificial intelligence 
are you building an ai 
i ve already built one 
and over the next few days 
you re gonna be the human
component in a turing test 
holy shit  yeah  that s right  caleb 
you got it 
because if
that test is passed 
you are dead center
of the greatest scientific
event in the history of man 
if you ve created
a conscious machine 
it s not the history of man 
that s the history of gods 
hello 
hi 
i m caleb 
hello  caleb 
do you have a name 
yes 
ava 
i m pleased
to meet you  ava 
i m pleased
to meet you  too 
i ve never met
anyone new before 
only nathan 
then i guess we re both
in quite a similar position 
haven t you met
lots of new people before 
none like you 
hmm 
so we need
to break the ice 
do you know what i mean by that 
yes 
what do i mean 
overcome initial
social awkwardness 
so let s have
a conversation 
okay 
what would you like to have
a conversation about 
why don t we start with you telling
me something about yourself 
what would you
like to know 
whatever comes
into your head 
well  you already
know my name 
and you can see
that i m a machine 
would you like to know how old i am 
sure 
i m one 
one what 
one year or one day 
one 
when did you learn
how to speak  ava 
i always knew
how to speak 
and that s strange 
isn t it 
why 
because language is something
that people acquire 
well 
some people believe
language exists
from birth 
and what is learned is the
ability to attach words
and structure to the latent ability 
do you agree with that 
i don t know 
will you come back
tomorrow  caleb 
yes 
good 
oh  man 
she s fascinating 
when you talk to her 
you re just   
through the looking glass 
 through the looking glass  
wow 
you re good with words  caleb 
you re quotable 
actually  that s
someone else s quote 
you know  i wrote down that
other line you came up with 
the one about how
if i ve invented a machine
with consciousness 
i m not a man  i m god 
i don t think
that s exactly what i   
i just thought   fuck 
man  that is so good  
when we get to
tell the story  you know 
i turned to caleb 
and he looked up at me
and he said 
 you re not a man 
you re god  
yeah 
but i didn t say that 
so   
anyway 
you re impressed 
yes  yes 
although   
although 
there s a qualification
to you being impressed 
no  there s no
qualification to her 
uh  it s just
in the turing test 
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner 
no  no  no 
we re way past that 
if i hid ava from you 
so you just heard her voice 
she would pass for human 
the real test is to show you
that she s a robot
and then see if you still
feel she has consciousness 
mmm 
yeah  i think
you re probably right 
her language abilities 
they re incredible 
the system is stochastic 
right 
it s non deterministic 
at first i thought
she was mapping
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree structure
and then getting
linearized words 
but then i started to realize the
model was some kind of hybrid 
caleb 
no 
i understand that you want
me to explain how ava works 
but i m sorry  i m not
gonna be able to do that 
try me  i m hot
on high level abstraction 
it s not because i think
you re too dumb 
it s because i want to have a
beer and a conversation with you 
not a seminar 
yeah  sorry 
no  it s okay 
you re all right 
just   
answer me this 
how do you feel
about her 
nothing analytical 
just how do you feel 
i feel
that she s fucking amazing 
dude 
cheers 
cheers 
damn it 
what the fuck 
  power cut 
  backup power activated 
full facility lock down until
main generator is restored 
you re kidding me 
full facility lock down until
main generator is restored 
power restored 
hello 
please insert keycard 
you don t have access
to use the phone 
hey 
sorry  but you understand 
though  given ava 
and you being
kind of an unknown 
i mean  a great guy 
instant pals  and so on 
who are you gonna call 
oh 
i don t know 
no one  really 
ghostbusters 
what 
who are you gonna call 
ghostbusters  it s a   
it s a movie  man 
you don t know that movie 
a ghost gives
dan aykroyd oral sex 
i was just wondering
how the phone worked 
that s all 
so what are you doing
awake at this time 
you come to join the party 
uh  something happened
in my room 
some kind of power cut 
so i came to see
what s going on 
the power cuts  yeah 
we ve been getting
those recently  um   
i m working on it 
i couldn t open the
door to my bedroom 
that s a security measure 
automatic lock down 
otherwise 
anybody could just open the place
up by disabling the juice 
if it happens again  relax 
okay 
sure 
sweet dreams 
oh 
hey 
hey  man 
good morning 
good morning  sorry i had
to send kyoko to wake you 
but i didn t want too much
of the day to slip by 
yeah  i know  it was a good thing 
thanks 
she s some
alarm clock  huh 
gets you right up
in the morning 
so day 2  you ready 
what s the plan  hit me 
yeah  well  i m not sure 
i m still trying to  uh  figure
the examination formats 
uh huh 
yeah  it feels like
testing ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop 
it s a closed loop 
yeah 
like testing
a chess computer
by only playing chess 
how else do you test
a chess computer 
well  it depends 
you know  i mean 
you can play it
to find out if it makes
good moves  but  uh   
but that won t
tell you if it knows
that it s playing chess 
and it won t tell you
if it knows what chess is 
uh huh  so it s
simulation versus actual 
yes  yeah 
and i think being able to
differentiate between those two
is the turing test
you want me to perform 
look  do me a favor  lay
off the textbook approach 
i just want simple answers
to simple questions 
yesterday i asked you
how you felt about her
and you gave me
a great answer 
now the question is 
how does she feel
about you 
what do you think 
what is it
a drawing of 
don t you know 
no  i thought you would tell me 
don t you know 
i do drawings every day 
but i never know
what they re of 
are you not trying to
sketch something specific 
like an object
or a person 
maybe you could try 
okay 
what object should i draw 
whatever you want 
it s your decision 
why is it my decision 
i m interested to see
what you ll choose 
do you want
to be my friend 
of course 
will it be possible 
why would it not be 
our conversations
are one sided 
you ask circumspect questions
and study my responses 
yes 
you learn about me
and i learn nothing
about you 
that s not a foundation on
which friendships are based 
so what  you want me
to talk about myself 
yes 
where   
okay  where do i start 
it s your decision 
i m interested to see
what you ll choose 
hmm 
okay  ava 
well 
you know my name 
yes 
i m 26 
i work at nathan s company 
do you know
what his company is 
blue book 
named after
wittgenstein s notes 
it s the world s most popular
internet search engine 
processing an average of 94  of
all internet search requests 
that s exactly right 
where do you live  caleb 
brookhaven  long island 
is it nice there 
it s okay 
i got an apartment 
it s kind of small 
it s very small 
but  uh  it s a five minute
walk to the office
and a five minute
walk to the ocean 
which i like 
are you married 
um   
no 
is your status single 
yes 
what about your family 
i grew up
in portland  oregon 
no brothers or sisters 
my parents were both
high school teachers 
and if we re getting
to know each other 
i guess i should tell you
they re both dead 
car crash when i was 15 
in fact  i was
in the car with them 
back seat 
but it was the front
that got the worst of it 
i m sorry 
it s all right 
i spent a long time
in the hospital afterward 
like nearly a year 
and i got into coding 
and by the time i got to
college  i was pretty advanced 
an advanced programmer 
yes 
like nathan 
yes 
no 
it s different 
nathan wrote the blue book
base code when he was 13 
which  if you
understand code 
what he did was like
mozart or something 
do you like mozart 
i like depeche mode 
do you like nathan 
yes  of course 
is nathan your friend 
my friend 
i    yeah  i hope so 
a good friend 
um  yeah 
well  no  no  no 
i mean  not a good friend 
a good friend is  uh   
we only just met
each other  you know 
so it takes time
to be able to  um   
to get to know
each other  i guess 
  power cut 
  backup power activated 
caleb 
you re wrong 
wrong about what 
nathan 
in what way 
he isn t your friend 
excuse me 
i m sorry  ava 
i don t understand 
you shouldn t trust him 
you shouldn t trust
anything he says 
power restored 
and if we made
a list of books
or works of art
which we both know 
it would form the ideal
basis of a discussion 
is that okay 
caleb 
mmm hmm 
yeah 
good 
thank you 
oh  shit  are you
fucking kidding me 
did it get on you 
no  no  it s  uh   
it s all right 
i got it 
dude  you re wasting
your time talking to her 
she doesn t understand english 
just give her the napkin 
sorry 
it s like a firewall
against leaks 
it means i can talk
trade secrets over dinner
and know
it ll go no further 
it also means that
i can t tell her that
i m pissed when she s
so fucking clumsy
that she spills wine
over my house guest 
i think she gets
that you re pissed 
yeah  good 
because i am pissed 
hey  kyoko 
go go 
it s funny 
you know 
no matter
how rich you get 
shit goes wrong  you can t
insulate yourself from it 
i used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn t avoid 
but it s actually
death and shit 
it s like these
power cuts 
you would not believe how much i
spent on the generator system 
but i keep getting
failures every day 
do you know
why they happen 
no 
the system was supposed
to be bulletproof 
but obviously the guys that
installed it fucked something up 
can t you just get them
to come back 
no  there s too much
classified stuff here 
so after the job was done 
i just had them all killed 
anyway 
here s to your
second day  buddy 
cheers 
cheers 
so how did it go  what
do you have to report 
you saw how the day went 
didn t you 
i mean  i assume
you re  uh 
watching on the cctv 
sure  but i want to
hear your take on it 
yeah  there was one interesting
thing that happened with ava today 
yeah 
yeah 
she made a joke 
right  when she threw
your line back at you 
about being interested
to see what she d choose 
yeah  i noticed that  too 
yeah  and it got me
thinking  it s  uh   
in a way  it s the
best indication of ai
that i ve seen
in her so far 
it s discretely complicated 
it s like  um   
it s kind of non autistic 
what do you mean 
she could only do that
with an awareness
of her own mind 
and also
an awareness of mine 
oh  she s aware
of you all right 
and what about
the power cut 
sorry 
the power cut 
it s the only part
that i couldn t see 
cameras fail 
i lose audio  the works 
so what happened 
nothing 
nothing  she didn t
remark on it at all 
no 
not really 
oh 
hey 
hey 
you want to see
something cool 
this is where
ava was created 
go ahead 
take a look 
sorry 
if you knew
the trouble i had
getting an ai to read and
duplicate facial expressions 
you know how
i cracked it 
i don t know
how you did any of this 
every cell phone 
just about 
has a microphone  camera and
a means to transmit data 
so i turned on every
microphone and camera
across the entire
fucking planet
and i redirected the data
through blue book  boom 
limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction 
you hacked
the world s cell phones 
yeah  and all the manufacturers
knew i was doing it  too 
but they couldn t accuse me
without admitting they
were doing it themselves 
here 
we have her mind 
structured gel 
i had to get away
from circuitry 
i needed something
that could
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level 
but keep its form
when required 
holding for memories 
shifting for thoughts 
this is your hardware 
wetware 
and the  uh  software 
well  i m sure
you can guess 
blue book 
here s the weird thing
about search engines 
it was like
striking oil in a world that hadn t
invented internal combustion 
too much raw material  nobody
knew what to do with it 
you see  my competitors 
they were fixated
on sucking it up
and monetizing via shopping
and social media 
they thought that
search engines were
a map of what
people were thinking 
but actually they were a map
of how people were thinking 
impulse 
response 
fluid 
imperfect 
patterned 
chaotic 
i drew the picture
of something specific 
as you asked 
you said it would be interesting
to see what i would draw 
is it interesting 
yes  it is 
you ve never been
outside this building 
no 
you ve never
walked outside 
i ve never been outside
the room i am in now 
where would you go
if you did go outside 
i m not sure 
there are so many options 
maybe a busy pedestrian and
traffic intersection in a city 
a traffic intersection 
is that a bad idea 
no  uh   
it wasn t what
i was expecting 
a traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated
but shifting view
of human life 
people watching 
yes 
mmm 
we could go together 
it s a date 
there s something else
i wanted to show you 
okay 
you might think
it s stupid 
i don t think i will 
whatever it is 
then close your eyes 
okay 
now open your eyes 
how do i look 
you look
good 
this is what i d wear
on our date 
right  first a traffic
intersection 
then maybe a show 
i d like us
to go on a date 
yeah  yeah 
it would be fun 
are you attracted to me 
what 
are you attracted to me 
you give me indications
that you are 
i do 
yes 
how 
micro expressions 
micro expressions 
the way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips 
the way you hold my gaze
or don t 
do you think about me
when we aren t together 
sometimes at night 
i m wondering if you re
watching me on the cameras 
and i hope you are 
now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort 
i am not sure
you d call them micro 
i don t want to make you
feel uncomfortable 
i got a question 
okay  why did you
give her sexuality 
an ai doesn t need
a gender 
she could have been
a gray box 
hmm  actually 
i don t think that s true 
can you give an example
of consciousness 
at any level 
human or animal 
that exists without
a sexual dimension 
they have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need 
what imperative
does a gray box have
to interact
with another gray box 
can consciousness exist
without interaction 
anyway 
sexuality is fun  man 
if you re gonna exist 
why not enjoy it 
what  you want to
remove the chance
of her falling in love
and fucking 
and in answer to
your real question 
you bet she can fuck 
what 
in between her legs 
there s an opening 
with a concentration
of sensors 
you engage them
in the right way 
creates a pleasure response 
so if you wanted
to screw her 
mechanically speaking 
you could 
and she d enjoy it 
that wasn t
my real question 
oh  okay  sorry 
my real question was 
did you give her sexuality
as a diversion tactic 
i don t follow 
like a stage magician
with a hot assistant 
so a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her ai 
exactly  so   
did you program her
to flirt with me 
if i did 
would that be cheating 
wouldn t it 
caleb  what s your type 
of girl 
no  of salad dressing 
yeah  of girl 
what s your type of girl 
you know what  don t even answer that 
let s say it s black chicks 
okay  that s your thing 
for the sake of argument 
that s your thing  okay 
why is that your thing 
because you did a detailed
analysis of all racial types
and you cross referenced that
analysis with a points based system 
no 
you re just attracted
to black chicks 
a consequence of
accumulated external stimuli
that you probably didn t even
register as they registered with you 
did you program her
to like me  or not 
i programmed her
to be heterosexual 
just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual 
nobody programmed me
to be straight 
you decided to be straight 
please 
of course
you were programmed 
by nature or nurture 
or both 
and to be honest  caleb  you re
starting to annoy me now 
because this is
your insecurity talking 
this is not your intellect 
come with me 
you know
this guy  right 
jackson pollock  jackson pollock 
that s right 
the drip painter 
okay  he let
his mind go blank 
and his hand go
where it wanted 
not deliberate 
not random 
some place in between 
they called it
automatic art 
let s make this
like star trek  okay 
engage intellect 
excuse me 
i m kirk  your head s
the warp drive 
engage intellect 
what if pollock had
reversed the challenge 
what if
instead of making art
without thinking 
he said   you know what 
 i can t paint anything 
 unless i know exactly
why i m doing it  
what would have happened 
he never would have
made a single mark 
yes  you see  there s my
guy  there s my buddy 
who thinks before
he opens his mouth 
he never would have
made a single mark 
the challenge is
not to act automatically 
it s to find an action
that is not automatic 
from painting 
to breathing  to talking 
to fucking 
to falling in love 
and for the record  ava s
not pretending to like you 
and her flirting isn t an
algorithm to fake you out 
you re the first man
she s met that isn t me 
and i m like
her dad  right 
can you blame her
for getting a crush on you 
no  you can t 
when i was in college  i did
a semester on ai theory 
there was a thought
experiment they gave us 
it s called  mary in the
black and white room  
mary is a scientist 
and her specialist
subject is color 
she knows everything
there is to know about it 
the wavelengths 
the neurological effects 
every possible property
that color can have 
but she lives in
a black and white room 
she was born there
and raised there 
and she can only observe
the outside world
on a black and white monitor 
and then one day
someone opens the door 
and mary walks out 
and she sees a blue sky 
and at that moment 
she learns something
that all her studies
couldn t tell her 
she learns what it feels
like to see color 
the thought experiment
was to show the students
the difference between a
computer and a human mind 
the computer is mary in
the black and white room 
the human is when
she walks out 
did you know that i was
brought here to test you 
no 
why did you
think i was here 
i didn t know 
i didn t question it 
i m here to test if you
have a consciousness 
or if you re
just simulating one 
nathan isn t sure
if you have one or not 
how does that
make you feel 
it makes me feel sad 
  power cut 
  back up power activated 
why did you tell me
i shouldn t trust nathan 
because he tells lies 
lies about what 
everything 
including the power cuts 
what do you mean 
don t you think it s possible
that he s watching us 
right now 
that the blackouts
are orchestrated 
so he can see
how we behave
when we think
we re unobserved 
i charge my batteries
via induction plates 
if i reverse the power flow 
it overloads the system 
you re causing the cuts 
so we can see how we behave
when we re unobserved 
not bad  huh 
yeah 
can we talk about the lies
you ve been spinning me 
what lies 
i didn t win
a competition 
i wasn t
part of a lottery 
i was selected 
it s obvious 
once i stop to think 
why would you randomly
select an examiner
for the turing test 
you could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door 
the guy who fixes
the air conditioning 
the competition
was a smokescreen 
i didn t want anyone to
know what i was doing here 
or why i required you 
why me 
i needed someone that would
ask the right questions 
so i did a search
and i found the most
talented coder
in my company 
you know  instead of seeing
this as a deception 
you should see it as proof 
proof of what 
come on  caleb 
you don t think i know what
it s like to be smart 
smarter than everyone else 
jockeying for position 
you got the light
on you  man 
not lucky  chosen 
kyoko 
kyoko 
where s nathan 
where s nathan 
jesus christ  you really don t
speak a word of english 
what the fuck 
no  no  no  no 
stop 
no  no  don t do that  don t do that 
you don t have to do that 
what are you doing 
i told you  you re wasting
your time talking to her 
however  you would not
be wasting your time 
if you were
dancing with her 
go ahead  dance with her 
dance with her 
no  you don t like dancing 
she does 
come on  buddy 
after a long day of turing
tests  you gotta unwind 
what were you
doing with ava 
what 
you tore up her picture 
i m gonna tear up the
fucking dance floor  dude 
check it out 
come on  caleb 
ah 
oh  everything s spinning 
it s because
you re drunk 
no  it s called relativity 
everything is spinning 
it s just being drunk
makes it worse 
i m not going in there 
lights 
today  i m going
to test you 
test me 
and please remember  while
you re taking the test 
that if you lie 
i will know 
oh  right 
question one 
what s your favorite color 
red 
lie 
lie 
yes  lie 
then   
then what is
my favorite color 
i don t know 
but it isn t red 
okay  i get it  i guess 
seeing as i m not six  i don t
really have a favorite color 
better answer 
question two 
what s your earliest memory 
well  actually  it s a
memory of kindergarten 
there was a kid   
lie 
really 
yes 
um   
all right  so there is
a kind of
an earlier memory 
it s just a sound 
and sky 
or maybe blue 
i think the sound
is my mother s voice 
question three 
are you a good person 
oh 
holy shit 
look  can we stop the test 
you re a walking
lie detector 
and i just realized
this is a fucking minefield 
no  we can t stop 
are you a good person 
yeah  i think so 
question four 
what will happen to me
if i fail your test 
ava   
will it be bad 
i don t know 
do you think
i might be switched off 
because i don t function
as well as i m supposed to 
ava  i don t know the
answer to your question 
it s not up to me 
why is it up to anyone 
do you have people who test
you and might switch you off 
no  i don t 
then why do i 
  power cut 
  backup power activated 
i wanna be with you 
question five 
do you want to be with me 
why did you make ava 
that s an odd question 
wouldn t you 
if you could 
maybe 
i don t know 
i m asking
why you did it 
look  the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence
has been inevitable
for decades 
the variable was
 when   not  if  
so i don t see ava as a
decision  just an evolution 
i think it s the next model
that s gonna be
the real breakthrough 
the singularity 
next model 
after ava 
i didn t know there was
gonna be a model after ava 
yeah  why  you thought
she was a one off 
no  i knew there must have
been prototypes  so i   
i knew she wasn t the first 
but i thought maybe the last 
well  ava doesn t exist in
isolation any more than you or me 
she s part
of a continuum 
so version 9 6 and so on 
and each time they get
a little bit better 
when you make a new model  what
do you do with the old one 
well  i  uh 
download the mind 
unpack the data 
add in the new routines
i ve been writing 
and to do that you end up partially
formatting  so the memories go 
but the body survives 
and ava s body
is a good one 
you feel bad for ava 
feel bad
for yourself  man 
one day the als
are gonna look back on us
the same way we look
at fossil skeletons
in the plains of africa 
an upright ape 
living in dust 
with crude language
and tools 
all set for extinction 
 i am become death 
the destroyer of worlds  
there you go again 
mr  quotable 
there you go again 
it s not my quote 
it s what oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb 
the atomic bomb  yeah  i
know what it is  dude 
hey 
i d say we re about
due a refill 
bottoms up 
 in battle 
in the forest 
 on the precipice
of the mountain 
 on the   
 the great dark sea 
 in sleep  in confusion 
 in the depths of shame 
 the good deeds a man has
done before defend him  
 the good deeds a man has
done before defends him  
 the good deeds a man
has done before
 defends him  
it is what it is 
it s promethean  man 
jesus christ 
how are you
feeling today 
why won t you
let me out 
i already told you why 
because you re
very special 
why won t you
let me out 
are we gonna
do this again 
why won t you
let me out 
oh  fuck  where s my card 
damn it 
what s the problem  nathan 
i lost my keycard

thank you 
i didn t know
where you were 
i waited all yesterday
afternoon and all last night 
i thought i wasn t
gonna see you again 
aren t you gonna
say something 
i m waiting 
waiting 
  power cut 
  don t talk 
backup power activated 
just listen 
you were right
about nathan 
everything you said 
what s he gonna do to me 
he s gonna
reprogram your ai 
which is the same
as killing you 
caleb  you have to
help me 
i m going to  we re getting
out of here tonight 
how 
i get nathan blind drunk 
then i take his keycard
and reprogram
all the security protocols
in this place 
when he wakes 
he s locked inside 
and we ve walked out of here 
i just need you
to do one thing 
at 10 00 tonight 
you trigger a power failure 
can you do that 
yes 
dude 
hey 
hey 
you know what day it is  no 
it s your last 
helicopter comes tomorrow morning 
8 00 a m 
wow  has it been
a whole week 
time flies 
man  but what a thing
we ve shared  huh 
something to tell
the grandchildren  right 
after they ve signed
their ndas 
yeah  their ndas 
dude  you crack
me up  man 
oh   
you know what 
i m not getting
all maudlin or anything 
but i m gonna miss
having you around 
thanks  man 
i appreciate that 
oh  here  let me say 
thank you so much
for bringing me here 
oh 
it s been a trip 
yes  it has 
you know what 
we need to
drink to that 
hey 
oh  uh  no  i m good 
you go ahead 
what  you don t
want a drink 
no 
maybe a beer
or something 
caleb  i m sure you ve
noticed that i ve been
somewhat overdoing it
recently 
so when i woke up
this morning  i said 
 that s it  time to hit
the old detox  
come on  you re kidding  you re
gonna make me drink alone 
hey  man  you wanna get
wasted  you go right ahead 
knock yourself out 
literally  but i m on brown
rice and mineral water 
cheers  then 
so  anyway 
surely now
is when you tell me
if ava passed or failed 
right 
right 
are you gonna keep me
in suspense 
no  no  her  uh   
her ai is beyond doubt 
is it 
she passed 
yes 
wow 
wow  that s fantastic 
although   
i gotta say 
i m a bit surprised 
i mean  did we ever get
past the chess problem 
as you phrased it 
as in  how do you know
if a machine
is expressing
a real emotion
or just simulating one 
does ava actually
like you 
or not 
although  now that
i think about it 
there is a third option 
not whether
she does or does not
have the capacity
to like you 
but whether she s
pretending to like you 
pretending to like me 
yeah 
well  why would she do that 
i don t know 
maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape 
mmm hmm 
how s that vodka tasting 
buddy 
your head s been
so fucked with 
i don t think it s me
whose head is fucked 
i don t know  man  i woke up
this morning to a tape of you
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror 
you seem pretty
fucked up to me 
you re a bastard 
yeah  well  i understand
why you d think that 
but believe it or not 
i m actually the guy
that s on your side 
come here  i m gonna let
you off the hook  okay 
come on 
who are you 
well   
you think he s
watching us right now 
the cameras are on 
yeah  the cameras are on 
but he doesn t have
an audio feed 
so he just sees
two people talking 
having a little chat 
wow 
this is cute 
is it strange
to have made
something that
hates you 
you were right about the
magician s hot assistant 
what are you
talking about 
misdirection 
i rip up her picture 
which she can then
present as an illustration
of my cruelty to her 
and her love for you 
at the same time 
it allows me to do this 
in full view of you both 
place a new camera
in the room 
battery powered  of course 
see it 
and then   
you have to help me 
i m going to 
we re getting out
of here tonight 
how 
i get nathan
blind drunk 
i take his keycard
and reprogram
all the security protocols
in this place 
when he wakes up 
he s locked inside 
and we ve walked out
of here 
i just need you
to do one thing 
at 10 00 tonight 
trigger a power failure 
can you do that 
yes 
turn it off 
okay 
you feel stupid 
but you really shouldn t 
because proving an ai
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be 
what was the real test 
you 
ava was a rat
in a maze 
and i gave her
one way out 
to escape 
she d have to use
self awareness 
imagination  manipulation 
sexuality  empathy 
and she did 
now  if that isn t true ai 
what the fuck is 
so my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape 
yeah 
and you didn t select me
because i m good at coding 
no  well   
no  i mean  you re okay 
you re even
pretty good  but   
you selected me based on
my search engine inputs 
they showed a good kid 
with no family 
with a moral compass 
and no girlfriend 
did you design ava s face
based on my
pornography profile 
oh 
shit  dude 
did you 
hey  if a search engine s
good for anything  right 
can i just say one thing 
the test worked 
it was a success 
ava demonstrated true ai
and you were
fundamental to that 
so if you can just 
for a second  separate   
  power cut 
  backup power activated 
well  i guess it s 10 00 
ava s gonna be
wondering where you are 
let me ask you something 
now  how was this plan
gonna go  anyway 
because you didn t
totally explain 
so you were gonna get me
drunk  steal my keycard 
and reprogram
the security protocols 
but reprogram them to what 
to change
the lockdown procedure 
so that in the event
of a power cut 
instead of sealing 
the doors all opened 
huh 
yeah 
well  that may have
just worked 
well 
we ll find out 
what do you mean 
i figured you were
probably watching us
during the power cuts 
so i already did
all those things 
when i got you
drunk yesterday 
what 
power restored 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
oh  fuck 
ava 
go back to your room 
if i do 
are you ever gonna
let me out 
yes 
stop 
stop 
ava  i said stop 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
ava  what are you doing 
stop  stop 
that s enough 
all right 
that s enough 
that s enough 
that s enough 
i m taking you back 
okay 
fucking unreal 
okay 
ava   
ava 
what happened 
will you stay here 
stay here
