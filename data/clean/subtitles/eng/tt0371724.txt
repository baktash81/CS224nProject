for instance  on the planet earth 
man had always assumed
that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet 
instead of the third most intelligent 
the second most intelligent creatures
were dolphins  who  curiously enough 
had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet earth 
they d made many attempts
to alert mankind 
but most of their communications
were misinterpreted
as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for tidbits 
so they eventually decided they would
leave earth by their own means 
the last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted
as a sophisticated attempt
to do a backward somersault
through a hoop  whistling
the star spangled banner 
in fact  the message was this 
 so long and thanks for all the fish  
the extraordinary story
of the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy
begins very simply 
it begins with a man 
ooh 
an earthman  to be precise 
who no more knows his destiny 
than a tea leaf knows the history
of the east india company 
his name is arthur dent 
he is a five foot eight inch tall
ape descendant
and someone is trying to drive
a bypass through his house 
what do i want you to do about it 
find him
and tell him i m currently lying
flat on my back in front of   
fine  i ll hold 
you can t lie in front
of the bulldozers for ever 
i m game  we ll see who rusts first 
this bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built 
  why has it got to be built 
  it s a bypass 
you ve got to build bypasses  besides 
you should ve protested months ago 
the plans have been on display
at the planning office for a year 
on display 
i had to go down to a cellar 
mr  dent  have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer
if i just let it roll straight over you 
  how much 
  none at all 
by a strange coincidence 
none at all
is exactly how much suspicion
ape descendant arthur had
that one of his closest friends
was not descended from an ape 
but was  in fact  from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse 
arthur  arthur 
  ford 
  yes 
here 
ah  there you are 
eat  drink  we gotta talk 
now s not the best time 
they re going to demolish my home 
whoa  you already   
you already know  how 
what do you m    
oh  they  they  when you say
 they  you mean they  got it 
listen  i got somethin  important
i gotta tell you  right now 
well  what about my house 
workers of the earth  i bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer 
  good  let s go to the pub 
  huh 
they won t demolish it
until they ve finished the beers 
  can we trust  em 
  to the end of the earth 
  how far s that 
  about 12 minutes away 
huh 
barman  six pints of bitter and quickly 
the world s about to end 
six pints coming up 
keep the change 
you got about ten minutes to spend it 
three pints each  at lunchtime 
sorry  ah  time is an illusion 
lunchtime  doubly so 
and eat those peanuts 
because you ll need the salt 
  look  what is going on  ford 
  arthur   
what if i told you
i really wasn t from guildford 
i was from a small planet
somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse 
is that something
you re likely to say 
remember when we met 
out the way 
  oof 
  hi 
wasn t it strange i was trying
to shake hands with a car 
i assumed you were drunk 
i thought cars were the dominant
life form  i was introducing myself 
you saved my life  and now
i m saving yours  please drink 
it must be thursday  i could never get
the hang of thursdays 
  if this is about your house   
  no  it s not about the house 
  who s he 
  she  she 
tricia mcmillan 
we met at a fancy dress party 
i hate those kind of parties 
i d rather have stayed at home
and ironed my hankies 
  but there i was 
  who are you 
  oh 
  and there she was 
  uh  dent  arthur dent 
  oh  no  i mean  who are you 
oh  the costume  right 
 livingstone  i presume  
yeah  it s not as clever as darwin 
but the best i could do at short notice 
you re the first to get that right 
  really 
  yes  everyone calls me santa 
  right 
  i thought the beagle was a giveaway 
so did i 
people at these parties
are drunken idiots 
what 
all these people are idiots 
god 
that s awkward 
tell me 
she was amazing though  ford 
beautiful  witty  mad as a balloon 
uh  without the beard 
you look at least 80 years younger 
maybe i m de evolving 
well  i should tell you
that i do not date
single celled organisms  okay 
let s go somewhere 
yeah  definitely 
um  where do you have in mind 
  madagascar 
  is that that new club on dean street 
no  it s a country
off the coast of africa 
that madagascar 
why are we waiting here 
wait a sec 
go 
god  you re serious 
um  i can t go to madagascar 
  why not 
  because  i just  you know   
  you re serious 
  yeah 
i want to go somewhere i ve never been
and i d like to go with you  so   
   what do you say  dr livingstone 
i say that s
an extraordinary proposition 
i can t go  i mean  i ve got a job 
quit  get a new one
when you come back 
i don t even know your real name 
ow  ow 
  tricia mcmillan 
  well  tricia mcmillan 
um  i have a proposition for you 
why don t we go somewhere
a little closer first  say cornwall 
and we ll see how it goes 
right  of course  cornwall 
hey  excuse me 
is this guy boring you 
why don t you talk to me instead 
i m from a different planet 
it s true  you want to see my spaceship 
 do you want to see my spaceship  
what kind of chat up line is that 
mm  that does happen 
speaking of   
we ve got two minutes 
drink up 
that s my house 
people of earth  a round of drinks 
for everyone  on me 
you really think
the world s going to end 
yes 
shouldn t we lie down  or put a paper
bag over our heads  or something 
  if you like 
  will it help 
not at all  see you 
last orders 
  what is that 
  run 
look out 
aha  towel 
arthur 
what the hell are those things 
yeow  they re ships
from a vogon constructor fleet 
i picked up their signal this morning 
you ll need this 
  what are you doing 
  we re hitching a ride 
um  people of earth 
this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the
galactic hyperspace planning council 
as you are probably aware 
plans for the development of the
outlying regions of the galaxy
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system 
and your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition 
there s no point
acting surprised about it 
the plans have been on display
at your local planning office
in alpha centauri for 50 earth years 
if you can t be bothered with
local affairs  that s your lookout 
apathetic bloody planet 
i ve no sympathy at all 
the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy
is a wholly remarkable book 
perhaps the most remarkable 
certainly the most successful 
ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of ursa minor 
more popular than
the celestial homecare omnibus 
better selling than
53 more things to do in zero gravity 
and more controversial than
oolon colluphid s trilogy
of philosophical blockbusters 
where god went wrong 
some more of god s greatest mistakes 
and who is this god person anyway 
it s already supplanted
the encyclopedia galactica
as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom
for two important reasons 
first  it s slightly cheaper 
and second  it has the words
 don t panic 
printed in large 
friendly letters on its cover 
so you re not from guildford 
which would explain the accent 
which i ve always wondered about 
um  you re not an out of work actor 
but rather a writer for this 
this book thing 
good  huh 
i don t feel well 
i need a cup of tea 
if i asked where we were 
would i regret it 
  we re safe for now 
  good 
we re in the washroom on one of the
ships of the vogon constructor fleet 
  oh  get me home  ford 
  arthur  your home is   
oh  god  my home 
my home was demolished 
you don t remember 
okay  arthur  i ve got something to tell
you  it s unfortunate  but it s true 
your home planet has been blown up 
huh  blown up 
couldn t you have done something 
i saved your life 
okay  that makes us even 
it s a tough galaxy  if you want
to survive out here  you ve   
   gotta know where your towel is 
okay  give me a hand over here 
careful  it s hot 
we ve gotta get off this ship 
before the vogons find us 
vogons  they hate hitchhikers  pull 
huh 
  now we ll get a signal 
  what is a vogon 
ask the guide  say  vogons  
vogons 
vogons are one of the
most unpleasant races in the galaxy 
not evil  but bad tempered 
bureaucratic  officious and callous 
they wouldn t even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers
from the ravenous bugblatter beast
of traal without orders
signed in triplicate 
sent in  sent back 
queried  lost  found 
subjected to public inquiry 
lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months
and recycled as firelighters 
on no account should you allow
a vogon to read poetry to you 
they can t think or imagine 
most can t spell  they just run things 
hmm 
and if we don t get a ride soon 
we won t need the guide to tell us
how unpleasant the vogons are 
they ve already destroyed
a planet today 
that always makes them a little eee 
ughh  what is that 
  put this in your ear 
  huh 
we have unwittingly
picked up a couple of hitchhikers 
the fish is translating for you 
the babel fish
is small  yellow  leech like 
and probably the oddest thing
in the universe 
it feeds on brainwave energy 
absorbing unconscious frequencies 
and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies
to the speech centers of the brain 
the practical upshot of which is that 
if you stick one in your ear 
you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language 
resistance is useless 
  all right 
  someone s coming 
here we go  look lively 
wheee 
ha  ha 
  hmmm 
  sir 
  what 
  hitchhikers 
 o freddled gruntbuggly    
no  really  you don t have to read 
we ve put you through
enough trouble already 
     as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee  
vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe 
the second worst
is that of the azgoths of kria 
during a recitation by their
poet master  grunthos the flatulent 
of his poem
ode to a small lump of green putty
i found in my armpit
one midsummer morning 
four of his audience
died of internal hemorrhaging 
and the president of the
mid galactic arts nobbling council
survived by gnawing
one of his own legs off 
 or i will rend thee
in the gobberwarts    
     with my blurgle    
the absolute worst poetry was
by paula millstone jennings of sussex 
luckily  it was destroyed
when the earth was 
 see if i don t   yeah 
so  earthlings 
i present you with a choice 
either die in the vacuum of space 
or tell me what you thought of my poem 
a    a    actually  i rather liked it 
  hmm 
  yeah 
  that s good  run with it 
  hmmm 
uh  some of the words
i didn t understand 
but i found the imagery quite effective 
continue 
well  uh  yes 
interesting rhythmic devices 
which seemed to counterpoint
the underlying metaphor
of the humanity of   
  vogonity 
  vogonity  sorry  vogonity   
of the poet s soul 
so what you re saying is 
i write poetry because
underneath this mean 
callous  heartless exterior 
i just want to be loved 
yes  yes  yes 
yes  yes  yeah  please 
ahh  ooh  ooh  mmm 
throw them off the ship 
  no  no 
  ford  ford 
ahh 
all right  all right 
resistance is useless 
shut up  get a job 
wash your filthy hands 
don t panic  don t panic 
so this is it 
we re going to die 
yeah  we re gonna die 
no  no  what s this 
what is this 
what s this  this is    nothing 
yeah  we re gonna die 
you re sweating 
  would you like a hug 
  no 
 space   says the introduction
to the hitchhiker s guide 
 is big  really big  
 you just won t believe how vastly 
hugely  mind bogglingly big it is  
a    a    and so on 
it also says that
if you hold a lungful of air 
you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about 30 seconds 
but with space being really big and all 
the chances of being picked up
within that time
are two to the power of two billion 
79 million  460 thousand 
347 to one against 
by a staggering coincidence 
it s also the phone number
of the islington flat 
where arthur went to a fancy dress party
and met a very nice young woman
whom he totally blew it with 
though the planet earth 
the islington flat and telephone
have all now been demolished  ford
and arthur were  in fact  rescued 
  ford 
  yes 
  i think i m a sofa 
  i know how you feel 
so much for the laws of physics 
and our top story 
the sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe 
the starship heart of gold 
stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other
than galactic president
zaphod beeblebrox 
in the name of people  freedom 
and  uh    democracy  stuff like that 
i hereby kidnap myself
and i m taking the ship with me  whoo 
come on 
beeblebrox 
universally considered
to be the dimmest star
in several solar systems 
is most famous for his controversial
defeat of humma kavula
who claimed many thought they were
voting for the worst dressed being
in the universe contest 
great 
kavula is best remembered
for his slanderous
 don t vote for stupid   campaign 
put your ego aside 
something important has happened 
if there s anything more important than
my ego  i want it caught and shot now 
come on  i love it 
zaphod s just this guy  you know 
hey  hey  hey  hey  what d you    
  i was just watching myself 
  we have a couple of hitchhikers 
hitchhikers 
why d you pick up hitchhikers 
i didn t  the ship did 
what  wh    wh    say what 
when we engaged the
improbability drive    the big button 
  i know 
  they were picked up here 
in sector zz9 plural z alpha  wait 
that s where you picked me up 
  on earth 
  that s impossible 
  no  just very improbable 
  listen  i don t have time for this 
we ve got the police of half the galaxy
after us  we ve stopped for hitchhikers 
so ten out of ten for style  but   
   minus several million
for good thinking 
you re too gorgeous  baby  stop it 
you drive me crazy 
don t  i ll send marvin 
marvin 
you ought to know 
i m feeling very depressed 
well  we have something
that should take your mind off things 
it won t work 
i have an exceptionally large mind 
yeah  we know  but we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here 
just that  i won t enjoy it 
yeah  well  that s life 
life 
don t talk to me about life 
  commander kwaltz 
  yes 
we have located the spaceship
heart of gold and president beeblebrox 
  where 
  sector zz9 plural z alpha 
requesting hyperspace clearance 
hold your position  captain 
until clearance is granted 
  yes  sir 
  get me vice president questular 
hyperspace permission granted  captain 
here we go 
i think that door just sighed 
ghastly  isn t it 
all the doors have been programmed
to have a cheerful
and sunny disposition 
anyway  come on  i ve been ordered
to take you up to the bridge 
please yourselves 
here i am 
brain the size of a planet 
and they ask me to take you
up to the bridge 
call that job satisfaction 
 cause i don t 
you can thank the sirius cybernetics
corp  for building robots with g p p 
  what s g p p  
  genuine people personalities 
i m a personality prototype 
you can tell  can t you 
arthur 
hey  slim  are you wearing
my underwear   cause i m wearing yours 
and they ain t doing the trick 
come on  all right 
oh  for heaven s sake 
i ve brought the aliens 
don t thank me or anything

  ford 
is that you 
ford  praxibetel ix 
what the hell are you doing here 
i just stuck out my thumb and here i am 
  that is so you 
  look at you 
president of the galaxy 
i can t believe you beat humma kavula 
you zarkin  frood 
i want you to meet a friend 
arthur  this is zaphod beeblebrox 
oh

i think he called you trillian 
which of us got the right one

i am speaking to the kidnapper
of the president 
she digs me 
surrender the stolen vessel at once
or we will take action
as defined and permitted by   
section 1 8 of the galactic interstellar
space bylaws   
zaphod  please come back now 
this is ridiculous 
leap to hyperspace  come on 
sure thing  fella 
no 
did they have proper
hyperspace authorization 
  no  commander 
  oh 
bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms 
i m coming  sir 
i m boiling 
oh  oh  here s the form  sir 
so are you along for the ride

i ll show you the kitchen 
when you see what i m about to show you 
you ll beg me to take you with us 
the best drink in existence
is the pan galactic gargle blaster 
the effect of which is like having your
brains smashed out by a slice of lemon
wrapped round a large gold brick 
  belgium  hold it one second 
  belgium 
ape man  earth dude  sorry 
what s your name again 
  arthur 
  right  gorgeous 
no hard feelings  okay 
sorry to hear about your planet   
  earth 
  yeah  i liked earth 
got these boots there 
but don t mention it to the girl 
because if you do    i ll pull your
spleen out through your throat 
  all right  thanks  buddy 
  okay 
good stuff  like those jammies 
hey  hey  zaphod 
what s with the two head thing 
oh  yeah  apparently  you can t be
president with a whole brain 
it s crazy 
  oh  so you carved it up 
  yes 
parts of my personality weren t exactly
what you d call presidential 
you know what i m talkin  about 
your tea is ready 
i suppose i should ve said
it resembles tea 
so  two heads
is what does it for a girl 
i mean  if i d had two heads 
or three   
or your own spaceship 
anything else he s got two of 
come on  arthur  don t be like that 
what am i supposed to be like 
green  bleeping 
i can fold my eyelids
inside out if you like 
okay  look  do you see this 
this detects what you re craving
and makes it for you 
enjoy your doughnut 
do you see this 
this toasts bread
while you re slicing it 
we re on a spaceship  arthur  in space 
  i told you i wanted to get away 
  to madagascar 
that was    some sort of test 
and i failed 
  how badly does it hurt 
  it doesn t feel great 
no  i mean your chin 
  ah   
  i might have an aspirin 
right 
hey 
tricia    trillian  sorry 
there s something i have to tell you 
  please  don t 
  showtime  trill 
i m going to set up 
buttons aren t toys 
buttons aren t toys 
anyway    when i saw
what i m about to show you 
that s when i realized
why i had to do what i did to my brain 
i think  it s all a little   
   shaky 
i ve seen it  it s rubbish 
many millions of years ago 
a race of hyper intelligent 
pan dimensional beings
got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life 
that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best
to design and build
a stupendous super computer
to calculate the answer to life 
the universe and everything 
o deep thought 
we want you to tell us the answer 
the answer to what 
the answer to life 
the universe  everything 
we d really like an answer 
something simple 
hmm  i d have to think about that 
return to this place in exactly
seven and a half million years 
  is it finished 
  no  there s more  they go back 
  seven and a half million years later 
  that s right  they do 
deep thought  do you have   
an answer for you 
yes  but you re not going to like it 
  it doesn t matter  we must know it 
  all right 
the answer to the ultimate question   
   of life  the universe
and everything   
   is   
   42 
yeah  what 
42 
yes  i thought it over
quite thoroughly  it s 42 
it would ve been simpler
to have known what the question was 
but it was the question 
the ultimate question  of everything 
that s not a question 
only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means 
  give us the ultimate question then 
  i can t  but there is one who can 
a computer that will calculate
the ultimate question 
a computer of such infinite complexity 
that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix 
and you yourselves shall take on new 
more primitive forms 
and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10 million year program 
i shall design this computer for you 
and it shall be called   
  that s it 
  that s it 
you re looking for
the ultimate question  you  why 
i tried that 
why  42  doesn t work 
  let s get it ready  baby 
  why   
   do you want to know
the ultimate question 
partly curiosity 
partly a sense of adventure 
but  uh  mostly i think
it s for the fame and the money 
you re president of the galaxy 
  yes  arman 
  arthur 
whatever 
presidential fame is temporary 
i find the question  that s permanent 
it sticks 
plus  everyone thinks you re deep 
win win 
we just hit that button and bam 
we re at magrathea  i think 
we ve hit it twice and
we re still not there  but anyway   
  you in 
  always 
  all right 
  uh  i want to get off 
  uh  sorry  what exactly are we doing 
  this 
the infinite improbability drive
is a wonderful new method
of crossing interstellar distances
in a few seconds 
without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace 
as the improbability drive
reaches infinite improbability 
it passes through every conceivable
point in every conceivable universe
almost simultaneously 
so you re never sure
where you ll end up
or even what species you ll be
when you get there 
it s therefore important
to dress accordingly 
the drive was invented following
research into finite improbability
often used to break the ice at parties
by making all the molecules
in the hostess s undergarments
leap one foot to the left
in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy 
many physicists said they
wouldn t stand for that sort of thing 
partly because it debased science 
but mostly because they didn t get
invited to those sort of parties 
wow  is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button 
very probably  yes 
ah  i think
the earthman s about to be sick 
in the trashcan  ape man 
this ship s new 
aw  come on 
we have normality 
did it work  are we there 
yeah  we re here  magrathea 
i don t think so  eddie   
  ow 
  what planet is this 
i m checking for you 
did you just pluck
one of my hairs  off my head 
thank you for waiting 
sorry to disappoint 
but this is not magrathea 
we are currently in orbit around
the planet viltvodle six 
humma kavula 
magrathea s gonna have to wait 
i got a score to settle on this planet 
humma kavula 
in the beginning 
the universe was created 
this made a lot of people very angry 
and is widely regarded as a bad move 
many races believed it was created
by some sort of god 
though the jatravartid people
of viltvodle six
firmly believe that the entire universe
was sneezed out of the nose of a being
called the great green arkleseizure 
humma kavula 
the jatravartids 
who lived in fear
of the time they called the
coming of the great white handkerchief 
were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each 
they were unique in being
the only race in history
to have invented
the aerosol deodorant before the wheel 
mr  president

i think you think you don t 
but we both know    you do 
eloquent as always 
your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze 
that s funny 
during the campaign  humma 
when you were my opponent
running against me 
you said i was stupid 
the election is ancient history 
zaphod  but   
   if memory serves  you won 
proving that good looks
and charm win
over brilliance
and the ability to govern 
and  incidentally  you are stupid 
excuse me  mr  humma  sir 
uh  i just want to say  there s been
some sort of terrible mix up
 cause  actually  he s not with us 
we came to worship you 
he followed us and   
he grew  didn t he  he s not that tall 
you didn t come half way across the
galaxy to settle a campaign grudge

how very  very improbable 
i kept a few souvenirs
from my former life

drive requires coordinates 
which i happen to have

you don t get something
for nothing  zaphod 
you must bring me something in return 
  wh    what 
  a gun 
  a gun 
  a very special gun 
designed by the greatest computer
ever invented 
but the only way to find it
is to go to magrathea 
fine  i ll get your gun 
just give me the coordinates 
and what will you give me
to ensure your return 
my word as president

stuck with no hope of rescue 
consider how lucky you are
that life has been good to you so far 
alternatively  if life
hasn t been good to you so far 
which  given your current circumstances
seems more likely 
consider how lucky you are that
it won t be troubling you much longer 
right  there we go 
oh  kidnapping the president

okay  right 
look  this is the president

you didn t even read it  did you 
honey  i m president of the galaxy 
i don t get a lot of time for reading 
an entire planet  my home

  trillian

oh  the president tests my patience 
this time i shall pursue him myself 
ready my ship 
fantastic  at last 
oh  that s one hour for lunch 
everybody 
i think i ll have soup today 
the encyclopedia galactica 
in its chapter on love 
states that it is
far too complicated to define 
the hitchhiker s guide
to the galaxy has this to say on love 
 avoid  if at all possible  
unfortunately 
arthur dent has never read
the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy 
  oh  i m so sorry 
  no  come in 
i    i didn t   
um  look  uh   
trillian  i just wanted to say 
you were right 
i should ve told you  and i understand
totally if you re angry with me 
um  for what it s worth 
i know how you must be feeling   
  can you hand me a towel 
  yeah  sure  this   
thank you 
actually 
what i was going to say was   
   if i d said yes to you
and gone to madagascar 
then neither of us would be here now 
i just thought that might
count for something 
it doesn t matter 
all right  computer  take us to   
where are we    where we headed again 
okay  i m gonna get you
another lemon 
all right 
engaging improbability drive 
no  zaphod  no 
buttons are not toys  what did you do 
magrathean coordinates accepted 
it blows my circuits to tell you
that we re in orbit 
at an altitude of 300 miles 
around the legendary planet
of magrathea 
magrathea  magrathea 
magrathea 
unbelievable 
incredible 
it s even worse
than i thought it would be 
greetings  this is a recorded
announcement as we are all out 
the commercial council of magrathea
thanks you for your visit 
but regrets that the entire planet
is temporarily closed 
if you d like to leave your name
and a planet where you can be contacted 
kindly do so at the tone 
  how can a planet be closed 
  zarkin  a  cousin 
okay  computer  keep going 
take us down 
i d be happy to 
it is gratifying
that your enthusiasm
for our planet continues unabated 
as a token of our appreciation 
we hope you will enjoy
the two thermo nuclear missiles
we ve just sent
to converge with your craft 
to ensure on going quality of service 
your death may be monitored
for training purposes  thank you 
i m delighted to tell you
there are two nuclear missiles
heading right for us 
if you don t mind 
i m going to take evasive action 
something s jamming
my guidance system 
impact minus 45 seconds 
computer  do something 
sure  handing over
manual control  good luck 
i need some help 
i can t do this without my third arm 
arthur  grab my hand 
  did we lose  em 
  no  they re coming right at us 
  why don t i just press this 
  no  we re not back to normal yet 
  what will happen 
  i don t know 
don t do it  we re here 
no telling where it ll send us 
  sod it all 
  no 
wow  where are we 
exactly where we were 
and the missiles 
apparently  they ve turned   
into a bowl of petunias 
and a very surprised looking whale 
and an improbability factor
of 8 767  128 to 1 against 
we have norm    normality 
normality  right 
we can talk about normality
till the cows come home 
  what is normal 
  what s home 
what are cows 
a proper cup of tea
would restore my normality 
it is important to note that
suddenly  and against all probability 
a sperm whale had been
called into existence
several miles above
the surface of an alien planet 
since this is not a tenable
position for a whale 
this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity 
this is what it thought as it fell 
ah  whoa  what s happening  who am i 
why am i here  what s my purpose 
what do i mean by who am i 
okay  okay  calm down  get a grip now 
ooh  this is an interesting sensation 
a sort of tingling in my   
i better start finding names for things 
let s call it a tail  yeah  tail 
what s this roaring sound whooshing past
what i m gonna call my head 
wind  is that a good name  that ll do 
yay  this is really exciting 
i m dizzy with anticipation 
or is it the wind 
there s a lot of that now 
and what s this thing coming towards me
very fast  so big and flat and round 
it needs a big wide sounding name
like ow  ound  round  ground 
that s it  ground  i wonder if it will
be friends with me  hello  ground 
the only thing that went through
the mind of the bowl of petunias
as it fell was   oh  no  not again  
many have speculated that if we knew
why the petunias had thought that 
we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now 
what are those things 
they re portals
to another dimension 
right  i don t suppose this
portal has central heating  does it 
ah  this is the one 
this will all end in tears 
i just know it 
right here 
hey  whoa 
okay  in we go 
we can t just step into that    that 
we don t know where it leads 
if we pick the wrong one 
we just    we come back 
we pick another one  it s no biggie 
what  yeah  it s a big biggie 
ford  a big biggie 
what if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies 
this is the right one  i have a hunch 
  ford 
  his hunches are good 
arthur  i say we go 
go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons  
this is suicide 
  i think i resent that 
  i don t care 
i m getting hostility
from you  alex   
  arthur 
  have you ever tried yoga 
  trillian 
  i think that s supposed to happen 
she s gone 
ford  she s gone 
arthur  don t panic 
  ford 
  hey  wait for me 
whoo 
come on 
idiot  come on  come on 
come on  come on 
ahhh 
no  no  no  don t leave 
come on  come on  just start 
i told you this would end in tears 
did you  did you 
geronimo 
ooomph 
far out  far out  ha ha 
this is it  this is it 
deep thought  i m a coming 
so  this is how
it s all going to end  is it 
me  alone on a dead planet 
with a manically depressed robot 
you think you ve got problems 
what if you are
a manically depressed robot 
excuse me 
  aaaaagghhh 
  whoa  whoa 
  who are you 
  no  uh  my name is not important 
uh  you must come with me 
  get away 
  terrible events are afoot 
um  you    you must come
or you ll be late 
  late  what for 
  what 
no  no  what s   
what s your name  earthman 
  dent  arthur dent 
  well   
late as in
 the late dentarthurdent  
it s a sort of threat  do you see  no 
  no 
  your friends are safe 
  you can trust me 
  a man who won t tell me his name 
okay  my name is  um   
   my name is    is   
is    slartibartfast 
i    i    i said it wasn t important 
well    so my friends are safe 
let me show you 
i could calculate your chances
of survival  but you won t like it 
did you know we built planets 
oh  yes  fascinating trade 
doing the  um    doing the coastlines
was always my favorite 
we used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords 
but then the galactic economy collapsed 
and seeing that custom built planets
are a    are a bit of
a luxury commodity   
come with me because there s
been a terrible mix up with your planet 
best laid plans of mice  you know 
  and men 
  what 
best laid plans of mice and men 
yes  well  i don t think men
have much to do with it  here 
um  i must warn you 
we re going to pass through 
well  a sort of gateway thing 
  huh 
  it may disturb you 
it scares the willies out of me 
aghh  aghh 
ha  ha  ha 
welcome to our factory floor 
okay 
all right  all right 
yeah  this is it 
this is it 
o great deep thought 
we have traveled long   
   and far 
have you calculated
the ultimate question of life 
the universe and everything 
no 
  what 
  i ve been watching tv 
oh 
i designed
another computer to do that 
oh  right  i forgot  is it here 
no  it s not here  it s another world 
it s on another world 
it is another world  stupid 
or it was until the vogons destroyed it
to make way
for a hyperspace expressway 
well    okay 
you sure you don t have the question 
or a way to  you know 
access it or something 
 cause i think i ve done
a lot to get here 
oh  shh  shh  the show s back on 
well  i don t wanna bother you 
so i m gonna    good stuff 
great  i m gonna go and find something
else for my entire life to be about 
zaphod  zaphod 
there s the    the gun 
  gun 
  that humma sent you for 
  you gave him your head 
  why d i    why d i do that 
  okay 
  that s stupid 
o deep thought 
we were told that there is a gun 
  there you are 
  hm 
look familiar 
so it wasn t destroyed 
actually  it was 
this is a backup  earth mark ii 
so you    you made the earth 
not me alone 
but i    i did my part 
ever heard of a place 
i think it s called norway 
that was one of mine 
i    i got an award for it 
oh  hoo 
all right  frank 
that s    that s frank 
ah ha  they   
they ve nearly finished the oceans 
zaphod 
here  it s   
   it s just like humma said 
  now you can go get your head back 
  hey  ford 
it s been nice knowing you 
you zarking frood 
no 
  whoa 
  this is a bust too 
h    h    hey  man  you know 
you must really be frustrated 
you go through all you have 
you don t get an answer 
which means no money or fame 
which you deserve   
the point of view gun 
conveniently 
does precisely what its name suggests 
fantastic  fantastic  fantastic 
if you point it at
someone and pull the trigger 
they instantly see things
from your point of view 
give me that thing 
it was designed by deep thought 
but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives
who  after arguments
with their husbands 
were sick of ending
those arguments with the phrase 
 you just don t get it  do you  
uh  uh  and you re right 
i shouldn t be so upset
because life goes on  you know 
and i should just go on with it 
shoot him again 
whoa 
hitchhiking s good  towels are good too 
  say what 
  that is brilliant 
what s goin     
i can see why humma kavula
would want one of these 
  we better get back  arthur s waiting 
  who cares 
i do  especially since we re somewhat
of an endangered species  thanks to you 
why so edgy  baby doll  relax 
you wanna know why i m edgy 
argh  of course you re edgy 
your planet s been blown up
and you ve been tooling around
with the guy who signed the order 
huh 
ugh  you actually wanted
to know the question
because you always wondered
if there was more to life
and now you re crushed
because you find out there really isn t 
hey  fantastic  psychedelic 
you ve got no home  no family 
and you re stuck with me 
another in a long line of men
who doesn t really get you 
huh  that s not true 
and you re worried you might have blown
it with the one guy who really does 
hey  whoops 
oh  baby doll 
give me that thing 
it won t affect me 
i m already a woman 
it s okay 
it s only a couple of little mice 
voilà 
himalayas  good  eh 
earthman  you must realize
that the planet you lived on was
commissioned  paid for and run by mice 
when you say mice  do you mean
the little furry white creatures
with whiskers  ears  cheese 
yeah  but they re protrusions into our
dimension of hyper intelligent beings 
i don t know this cheese
of which you speak 
but they were there on earth
as mice experimenting on you 
i see where you ve become confused now 
you see  we were experimenting on them 
ah  no  well  yeah  no 
that s what they wanted you to think 
but you were actually
elements in their computer program 
actually  this explains a lot 
all my life 
i ve had this strange feeling
there s something big and sinister
going on in the world 
no  that s normal paranoia 
everyone in the universe gets that 
perhaps i m old and tired 
but the chances of finding out
what s actually going on
are so absurdly remote
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy 
i d much rather be happy
than right any day 
  and are you 
  uh    no 
that s where
it all falls down  of course 
here you are then 
is this    
it s  um    it s all there 
you know  it all works 
welcome home 
  hey 
  hey  man 
  there you are 
  surprise 
what are you doing 
what happened to you 
is that tea 
  first  our hosts attacked us 
  right 
but then they made up for it
by making us   
   this amazing meal 
it s so    everything s right 
everything s delicious 
oh  come on  that s lovely 
we re glad you like it  earth creature

which is why you re here

but here s the point

i wouldn t want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel 
okay  hold tight 
stand by for commencement
of life cycle  in three  two  one   
all right  whoo 
not that
anyone cares what i say 
but the restaurant
is at the other end of the universe 
yeah 
play it 
it is  of course  well known
that careless talk costs lives 
but the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated 
for instance  at the very moment
that arthur dent said 
 i wouldn t want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel 
a freak wormhole opened up in
the fabric of the space time continuum
and carried his words far 
far back in time 
across almost infinite reaches of space 
to a distant galaxy
where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink
of frightful interstellar battle 
the two opposing leaders  resplendent
in their black jeweled battle shorts
were meeting for the last time 
when a dreadful silence fell 
and at that very moment 
the words  i wouldn t want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel 
drifted across the conference table 
unfortunately  in their native tongue 
this was the most appalling
insult imaginable 
so the opposing battle fleets
decided to settle
their remaining differences 
in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy 
now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark 
for thousands of years 
the mighty starships tore across
the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet earth 
where  due to
a terrible miscalculation of scale 
the entire battle fleet was
accidentally swallowed by a small dog
