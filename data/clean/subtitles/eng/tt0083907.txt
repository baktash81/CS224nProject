well  the guy that rented it said that it
is an old place 
little rundown  but it is
right up in the mountains 
the best part is  we get it so cheap 
and why we re getting it so cheap 
well  i don t know 
it might be in a real bad shape 
you mean nobody ve seen this place yet 
  not yet 
  it might not be that bad 
  no 
  actually it might be kinda nice

this guy was a real turk  you know 
everybody hated him 
like you 
yes  just like me 
i am gonna grade your face 
he has also invented this western stuff   
listen to this 
this is the tape i found downstairs 
it is been a number of years since i began
exhumating the ruins of candar
with a group of my colegues 
now my wife and i have retreated to a small
cabin  in the solitude of these mountains 
here i continued my research
undisturbed by
the distractions of modern civilization
and far from the grows of academy 
i believe i have made a significant
find in the candarian ruins 
of army of ancient sumerian
burial practises and funerary incantations 
it is entitled  naturam demontum 
roughtly translated
 book of the dead  
the book is bound in human flesh
and ink in human blood 
it deals with demons  demon
resurrection  and those forces which
wrong the forest and
dark powers of man s domain 
the first few pages warn that these
enduring creatures may lie
dormant  but they re never truly dead 
they may be recalled to active life
throught the incantations
presented in this book 
it is true recitation of these passages
when the demons are given licence
to posses the living 
hey  what did you do that for 
it was just getting good 
i just don t want to hear
that anymore  that s all 
scott  come on 
hey come on i just wann hear the rest of it 
no big deal 
shut it off 
shut it off 
shut it off 
oh my god 
sharon  where are you going 
i can t believe this 
scott  you know not to you play that 
come on  you knew it was upsetting 
you just don t know when you ve
taken something too far 
hey  don t give me that  you were playing that too 
you could have shut it off 
a big deal  she is nutts 
it s just a joke  come on 
she acts like she s 3 years old or something 
listen  why don t we stay up
for a while undisturbant  
all right  i will check up on
sharon to make sure she s ok 
stealing from the blind  huh 
here 
ash  how sweat of you 
  would you put that   
  oh  sure 
i was going to give it to you
before we come up here here  but   
the things got hacketed and this is
really the first chance we can be alone 
take a look 
oh  ash  beautiful  i really love it 
i ll never tak it off 
join us 
is anybody out there 
i know someone s out there 
i heard you 
i heard you in the cellar 
ashley 
help 
help 
what happened to you 
what s the matter with you 
did something in the woods did this to you 
not  it was woods themselves 
they re alive 
ash  what if i take her in the bedroom 
so she can lay down 
no  i don t wanna lay down 
i wanna get out of here 
i wanna leave this place right now 
right now  ashley 
wait a minute 
i am not leaving in any place 
  sharon 
  sharon 
sharon  there is nothing here 
trees do not attack people 
ashley  will you drive me in the town  or not 
right now   look  sure  sure  i ll take in the town 
but just listen to what you re saying 
i don t care  how it sounds 
i wanna get out of this place  right now 
ok  you can stay somewhere in town  then

wait here a minute 
do you see something 
where re you going 
ashley 
ashley 
it s not gonna let us go 
it s not gonna let us go  i told you 
it s not gonna let us go 
i know now that my wife have become
the host to the candarian demon 
i fear that the only way to
stop those possessed by
the spirits of the book is subjectively
bodily dismemberment 
i believe not to avoid this horror 
but for myself i have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods  and i have no doubt
that whatever i have ressurected throught
this book is sure to come calling    for me
ok  let me think 
is it seven 
what suit 
diamonds    no  no  no wait 
hearts 
  oh my god  seven of hearts  you re right 
  ash  i guessed the card right

  an extrasensor something  like esp
