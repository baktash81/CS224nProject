i don t know  joe 
no weapons  no motive  no clothes 
all we ve got to go on
is this bloody corpse 
  well  look again  harry 
  huh 
not blood   
due in a large part to
a major surplus of tomatoes 
tomato juice 
the tomato crop continues to grow
at an unprecedented rate 
within the last 12 hours 
we have received   
a number of unconfirmed reports
from throughout the nation   
that may or may not be connected to
this strange phenomenon 
sure doesn t taste like tomato juice 
look at the giant tomato  martha 
i didn t knew they grew  em so big  jess 
i wonder where he s going 
he got little timmy 
poor timmy 
he ate him all up 
the tomatoes are coming

  come over here 
  we can t leave him 
it s just too incredible 
a kamikaze tomato 
  tomatoes can t fly 
  yeah 
they can t eat people either  but
they re doing one heck of an impression 
jim  talk to that sheriff and find out
what s going on 
get over here 
how bad is it 
well  sir  i definitely
don t think it ll fly again 
i m not talking about that  you weiner 
what about the tomatoes 
we found two more bodies
at the main road   
but we pushed the tomatoes
back to the north end 
i don t think any managed to bust loose 
they better not have 
i want this thing contained 
i understand 
but nothing seems to stop them 
we tried chemicals  bugs  bullets 
nothing seems to work 
look  the president wants
a complete investigation 
we can t let this out 
people would   
panic  that s what 
and you know whose ass is on the line 
yours  mine  and the entire ag department 
look out 
what if the president
wants an investigation 
he ll get his investigation 
but we ll keep it quiet 
i ve arranged for the
most obscure generals   
the most obscure scientists 
and to head the investigation   
this man 
  i don t recognize him 
  nobody does 
his name is mason dixon 
he hasn t worked since the bay of pigs 
  is there any sign of a problem elsewhere 
  not yet 
i ve ordered the entire g d   
program shut down 
wait a minute 
isn t that jim richardson 
the press secretary 
what s he doing here 
the president s got him keeping an eye
on the investigation 
  why him 
  he s got a vegetable garden  that s why 
with peas and carrots
and squash and tomatoes 
that sheriff tells me   
there were reports of incidents like this
all over the county 
oh  bullshit  one nut spots a
flying saucer  and pretty soon   
everybody s shaking hands
with little green men 
god  who would ve thought 
all we wanted was a
bigger  healthier tomato 
look out 
here it comes again 
where did you get this one  general 
oh  i won that one in a
three legged sack race   
last armed forces day picnic 
what s the matter with general number two 
oh  he was out all night on manoeuvrers 
let him rest 
oh  i m sorry i m late  gentlemen 
would you follow me  please 
certainly 
oh  general  would you wake up  please 
i apologize for the size of this
room  gentlemen 
it s all i could do on such short notice 
now  are we all here 
where s jim richardson 
  the press secretary 
  yes 
perhaps we can give him a few more minutes 
general  i ve been meaning to ask you   
have you heard anything
about the nuclear strike force   
tactical training command meeting 
  you mean operation nichefict 
  that s right 
not really  i ve been following
the personnel proficiency planning   
for pago pago paratroop platoon patrols 
oh  operation ppppp 
  what s the poop on ppppp 
  moving well 
did somebody mention misfits

  ah 
well  then  nichefict must be pretty well
wrapped up 
gentlemen  gentlemen 
may i have your attention  please 
now that we re all here   
i d like to turn the meeting
over to dr  morrison 
  doctor 
  thank you  captain 
  major 
  pardon me 
never mind 
well  as i m sure you re well aware   
this tomato problem has caused
considerable concern   
within the scientific community 
scientists throughout the nation have   
directed their attention to this   
very vexing problem   
with only limited success 
however   
with the help of dr  fuji nokitofa   
we believe we ve made a breakthrough 
gentlemen  may i present dr  nokitofa 
how do you do  doctor 
very well  thank you 
dr  nokitofa  would you please explain   
the project to the gentlemen 
gentlemen  what we have developed
is  in essence   
a half man  half robot   
a very sophisticated combination   
of human intelligence
and superhuman powers   
which we are confident will
result in the ultimate   
destruction of the enemy 
thank you  dr  nokitofa 
are there any comments  gentlemen 
mr  black 
as head of the federal
intelligence agency   
i certainly don t mean to
question the background   
of these fine gentlemen   
but frankly  i don t think
the answer to this problem   
lies in trinkets and gadgets 
this is man versus vegetable 
technically  sir  tomatoes are fags 
he means fruits 
ah  fruits 
you see what i mean 
mr  dixon  i ve been authorized to
assign you four of my best agents 
gentlemen  with your
permission  i d like to   
introduce mr  dixon to his operatives 
that s fine  mr  platt 
in the meantime  the rest of us
will accompany the doctors   
down to view a demonstration of the latest
anti tomato project 
we ll be going outside  mr  dixon 
you d better bring your coat 
there s a little jap in the air 
he means nip 
  wash  wash  wash   
  scrub  scrub  scrub   
  can you get my back   
oh  my eyes 
oh  my eyes 
water  water 
actually  gentlemen 
this project entails   
the development of limbs
with superhuman powers 
unfortunately   
budget limitations have restricted
our development to only   
one of these technologically advanced legs 
okay  bruce  now let s try running first 
uh  that ll be fine  bruce 
bruce   
please jump for us 
despite some minor
recruitment difficulties   
caused by our recent   r  problem   
i believe you ll find that your unit   
will meet the highest of standards 
pynchon 
your men  dixon 
sam smith  disguise expert 
gretta attenbaum  swimming expert 
gretta defected to us
after the last olympics

to the department 
greg colburn  underwater expert 
the fourth member of your unit  it 
finletter   
is winding up his current mission 
he ll contact you at these coordinates 
expect him at 10 100 hours 
good luck  dixon 
can you  like  believe how he waffles
on every issue 
oh  right on 
we ll never have another president as bad
as this one 
what is it  over there 
no  no 
mr  daniels  i realize that in the past   
there have been some questions raised   
regarding the president s
use of public funds   
for what some may consider personal items 
however  i can say without
fear of contradiction   
that under no circumstances
and at no time   
has the current administration expended   
any public monies whatsoever   
for the purchase of the fluffy flower print
toilet paper 
now  if there are no further questions   
thank you  mr  press secretary 
mr  secretary 
mr  secretary 
just a moment  gentlemen 
one more question 
the little fellow in the rear 
bobby jenks  sir    s  149 
i have a question  sir 
certainly  young man 
what would you like to know 
we ve heard nothing at all about
the growing tomato menace 
i   
uh   
wouldn t exactly call it a
menace  young man 
there have been some isolated reports   
alleged incidents involving
some unusual activity   
associated with this  uh   
particular vegetable   
but i assure you that  uh   
this is not and never will become a menace 
however  the president 
leaving no stone unturned  has   
called upon our most noted
congressional leaders in this field   
to begin a thorough 
intensive  painstaking   
and exhaustive investigation   
into the backgrounds and origins of this   
interesting quirk of nature 
furthermore  you can assure all of your
young readers that   
this will never become a problem
that americans need fear 
this  uh  meeting of the senate
investigating committee s   
called to order 
anybody remember what we re
supposed to be investigating 
  the tomatoes  wayne

last remaining sub base at groton 
connecticut 
when asked why he had made
the startling decision

jimbo  buddy 
how are ya  how you doing 
  fine  i  uh   
  super  super 
hey  the president tells me
you have a situation  jimbo 
well  let me clue you 
you boys have come to the right place 
let me give you a peek
at mind maker in action 
first  we have to convince
the little housewife out there   
that the tomato which ate the family pet   
is not dangerous  no problem 
then we have to convince
local authorities   
that the thousands missing
from rural communities   
were merely stranded during their   
bicentennial pilgrimage to philadelphia 
no problem 
third  the president wants us
to do this in such a way   
that it can be covered up 
and no one will know it ever happened 
that s no problem 
but then he wants us to do this   
and convince 200 million americans   
that this disaster is actually a blessing 
now  that s a challenge 
i understand what you re saying  mr  swann 
the president is a very demanding person 
sometimes he expects the impossible 
but i don t   
i never said impossible  richardson 
what i said was that it was a challenge 
man was put on this earth
to meet challenges  my boy 
you really think you can do it 
can i do it 
can i do it 
  some sell  some buy   
  and only we know why  
  the wrap is more
important than the prize  
  important decisions are made each day  
  much too important for
the plain folk to make  
  they re always in a bind  
  depend on us to help make up their mind  
  red box  blue box   
  a red box and a blue box  
  bright colours and a coupon on the side  
  hard sell or soft
sell  it s all the same  
  millions of dollar bills
are spent every day  
  where do they all go   
  mind maker s here to run the show  
  we sell cars and toys
for girls and boys  
  and chairs and beds and shrunken heads  
  sugar beets and baseball cleats  
  and ice to eskimos  
  leeks and mink and boats that sink  
  no matter what  we ll get it sold  
  we ll use catchy jingles  snappy  
  tunes and pretty girls with big balloons  
  a little lie  a stretch of truth can  
  turn the public s head  
  there s tv types and ad execs  
  and everyone s the best  
  and yet  
  they all look up  
  to a single man  
  and that one single man  
  is    me   
  they sell  they buy 
and only i know why  
  the human mind is putty in my hands  
  important decisions are made each day  
  much more important for
the plain folk to make  
  they re always in a bind  
  depend on me to help make up their mind  
  decision wise  
  policy wise  demographically speaking  
  mind maker   
well  let s go meet that
challenge  young man 
i ve already put my staff to work   
so if you d be good enough
to stop by in the morning   
we can take a look see at some
of the preliminary sketches 
roll it 
then i can tell the president
you ll accept the assignment 
you bet your booties 
traffic cops all over the country
meet this challenge day to day 
this man is like any other policeman
anywhere in the country 
he works hard and takes
pride in serving people 
yes  he s a policeman
just like any other   
except for one thing  he is blind 
this has been a public
service announcement   
produced for the national
health foundation

  that s right 
  uh huh 
what are the blue dots 
those are mobil stations 
oh 
that must be major mills

so i ve been told 
dixon  i want you to see this 
captain 
yes  sir 
sir   
we ve captured a giant tomato 
i m afraid  gentlemen 
that what we have here before us   
isn t what we thought 
you don t mean   
this   
may god help us   
is a cherry tomato 
mr  dixon has ordered me to inform you   
that there s tomato
activity in your sector 
all right  who wants to be paper monitor 
i m telling you    b   it s a great idea 
the first adult breakfast cereal 
kinky crispies 
comes in three delicious flavours   
good afternoon  mr  swann 
i ll call you back    b 
bye 
jimbo  how s it going 
i believe that s my question 
right 
fun ny 
well  let me tell you 
we ve been going great bananas 
sit down  make yourself comfortable 
i asked myself  what do we need 
something original   
something that strikes
at the very heart of the matter 
and here it is 
mind maker at its best 
who can argue with that 
and there s more 
listen to this 
giant tomatoes mean bigger pizzas 
    rolling on 2   
    if you re feeling sad and blue  
  tomatoes end it all for you  
last year  more people were killed   
by auto mobile accidents  heart attacks   
lung cancer  and natural causes combined   
than by any one tomato 
pretty classy  huh 
with a capital k 
right 
and mr  secretary 
being a public relations man yourself   
you understand the value of symbols 
well  we have spent a great
deal of time and effort   
and over a million dollars to create a
symbol which will wage this battle   
an effort that will become known as   
the stop tomato program 
i see 
it all looks quite    extraordinary 
thank you 
now if you ll excuse me 
i think i ll be on my way 
just a moment  one more thing   
before you leave  mr  secretary 
i d really like you to see this 
it s something i ve worked
on for many years   
the culmination of years of effort 
the world s ultimate commercial 
roll it 
hi 
jesus christ for technitron 
the nation is in chaos 
can nothing stop this tomato onslaught 
last night 
tomatoes attacked los angeles   
boston 
seattle 
chicago 
even the mere mention of the word   
is sufficient to induce panic 
tomato 
more news at the hour 
now back to the rocking sound
of the boober on super 101 
all right 
man  that s really something  huh 
hey  everybody  i m gonna play something   
that s right  man 
it s number one in the charts this week   
the heavy sound of ronny desmond s
puberty love 
  puberty  
  puberty love  
  there is nothing like puberty love  
while the federal agencies
involved have declared   
that the necessary information
has not been forwarded   
to state agencies for their
respective review and approval   
we cannot ignore local pleas   
for inter governmental cooperation   
in what is obviously an affair   
best suited for international actions 
this is a question best left to people   
for whom there is no spokesman greater   
than those who speak   
and then i put my foot to the floor   
and i got out of there as fast as i could 
it was all very strange 
i    i just don t know what to think 
you made no unusual motions of any kind 
not to my knowledge 
odd 
were there any loud noises
or other extraneous activity   
which might have affected the
tomatoes  behavior  such as   
an airplane or another car in the vicinity 
i m almost sure there wasn t 
if you ll excuse me  gentlemen   
i really have to be
getting back to washington 
that s fine 
give my regards to the president 
  i ll do that  captain 
  it s major 
of course 
priority one message for mr  dixon  sir 
  a phone call for you 
  oh  thank you 
i ll need one of those for my records too

about his home   
his wife  his kids

i wonder what the tomatoes
are thinking about right now 
  we stopped  
  the germans in  45  
  then we crushed  
    the viet cong  
    almost  
  for a greater glory  
  we could never strive  
  this crop uprising  
  will not last long  
  ain t no time to make a fuss  
  we got to get those tomatoes  
  before they get us  
  we re gonna beat  em  mash  em   
  squish  em  bash  em in the street  
  we re gonna kick  em  kick  em   
  mush  em  crush  em with our feet  
  we re gonna meet them  munch them   
  crunch them  gonna stomp  em in place  
  yeah

  o e s tomatoes  
  we ll squish them  we ll mash them  
  we ll mush them we ll crush them  
  we stopped to negotiate
at the first attack  
  we gave them alabama but
they gave it right back  
  tomatoes  tomatoes  
  tomatoes  
  they said we d live together  
  like sister and brother  
  but they captured a cannery  
  and bottled my mother  
  now she s at the store and  
  they ll soon be back for more  
  those tomatoes  
  tomatoes  
across the length and
breadth of the nation   
the tomatoes continue on their rampage   
of wanton destruction   
burning 
pillaging 
raping 
let s shoot it from over there  huh  bill 
come on over here  lady 
stand by over here for just a minute  huh 
okay  don t go away 
we start with a tight shot  huh  bill 
tell me when you re ready 
don t run off 
across this great nation 
almost everyone has been affected   
in one way or another by this
terrible tomato onslaught 
mrs  williams 
i understand your husband is missing 
  yes  he is 
  do you think he s dead 
  well  i   
  will you miss him 
will you marry again 
what if he s laying in a ditch somewhere   
with both legs broken  calling your name 
stop 
you will have to find another
man  you know 
you re no spring chicken 
what are you going to do  mrs  williams 
can you answer my quest   
please look into the camera 
get away from me 
last night s crushing military defeat
may spell the end for humanity 
the shattered remnants
of a once proud civilization   
lay scattered amongst crushed
spirits and broken bodies 
lawlessness is rampant 
panic stalks the streets 
and personal grooming habits   
have reached an all time low 
i ll tell you now what s coming up   
it s the song that s sweeping the country 
number one all over   
from the west coast to the east coast 
every coast in between   
yeah  that s right 
you ve been asking for it 
you ve been waiting for it 
here it is  boys and gals 
it s ronny desmond s puberty love 
  puberty  puberty love  
  there is nothing like puberty love  
  it s so deep  
  it s so cool  
get out of the car 
hurry up  move 
hey 
  sir  sir 
  what 
  sir  sir 
  i m driving 
there s something wrong with the car 
we ll get them  finletter 
  we can catch it  sir 
  don t worry 
freeze 
good afternoon  mr  dixon 
had a pleasant nap 
richardson  i m not surprised 
mr  dixon   
i didn t really think you would be 
that s why you re here 
what do you intend to do with me 
mr  dixon  don t be so naive 
you are the only one with the knowledge
that can stop me 
don t be a fool  richardson 
you don t have a chance 
you know very well i do 
you know   
it s funny  dixon 
no man sits closer to power   
than the press secretary to the president
of the united states 
and yet as close as it is   
that power is never
really within your grasp 
it dangles before you   
taunting  daring   
mocking your very impotence 
i will not be mocked anymore 
i will no longer give   
other people s answers to
other people s questions 
the answers will be mine 
the questions will be mine 
everything will be mine 
it ll be glorious  dixon 
it s too bad you won t be around to see it 
what makes you think that you can   
control these tomatoes
better than anyone else 
questions  questions 
you missed your calling 
mr  dixon  have you had lunch yet 
here  have a tomato 
don t be afraid 
it s really quite small and quite harmless 
it s from my garden 
you might say that i m   
in tune with my tomatoes 
at the proper time   
when all vestiges of
authority have disappeared   
i shall charge in on my white stallion   
and save the nation   
or what s left of it 
my fellow citizens will
be eternally grateful 
at the very least  they ll surely choose   
my benevolent leadership   
over the obvious alternative 
it shall be my golden moment 
but  mr  dixon   
i m afraid these are your final moments 
you re awfully confident for a man
who has failed twice 
three times  but who s counting 
i don t think you can do it 
you know  dixon  you may be right 
i ve never killed a man before 
you may be right 
who s there 
u   s  package for you 
come in 
then again   
  you may be wrong 
  wait 
before you pull that trigger   
tell me how you do it 
really 
how melodramatic 
very well  it s really quite simple 
you see  all i do is   
a real bad apple  sir 
it s a good thing we got him 
finletter 
finletter 
we ve got to round up everybody
in the city  you got that 
and meet me in the stadium 
there s no time to lose 
but  sir  everybody s left town 
the only people left will be crazy people 
i don t care 
just do it  move 
sir   
then it s unanimously agreed   
that the committee recommend   
that no further action
will be taken at this time 
i ve got it 
i ve got it 
hey  guys  look  they re starting to come 
they re coming 
turn on the record player 
cover your ears 
everyone 
  puberty  puberty love  
  there s nothing like puberty love  
  it s so great  it s so cool  
look  the tomatoes 
it s working  it s working 
charge 
i want to thank you for saving my life 
just doing my job  lady 
well  i guess there s nothing more to say 
bye  mr  dixon 
goodbye  miss fairchild
