fifth year and still going hitler s way 
german troops
controlled most of europe 
d day changed all that 
d day  june 6  1944 
when the allied forces 
under their commander
general eisenhower 
landed on the northern coast of france 
by july they were able to begin their own
offensive  by august paris was liberated 
everywhere the germans retreated 
but with the allied victories
came problems 
supplies still had to be driven from
normandy  over 400 miles away 
and became dangerously short 
the allied advance
began to come to a halt 
another problem
facing eisenhower was this 
his two most famous generals 
patton who was in the south
and montgomery in the north 
disliked each other intensely 
their long standing rivalry
had never been more fierce 
there simply were
not enough supplies for both armies 
each wanted to be the one
to defeat the germans 
each wanted to beat the other to berlin 
in september  1944  montgomery
devised a new and spectacular plan
given the codename market garden 
eisenhower  under great pressure
from his superiors 
finally sided with montgomery 
and operation market garden
became a reality 
the plan  like so many plans
in so many wars before it 
was meant to end
the fighting by christmas
and bring the boys back home 
arnhem  holland  september 1944
what is that noise 
  can i look out 
  no  they might shoot us 
the germans have collapsed 
then the war is over 
soon 
but what is that noise 
panic 
german western front  army h q 
you may begin 
may i first be permitted to say 
and i think i speak for all of us   
how pleased we are 
field marshal von rundstedt   
that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the west 
speeches are for victory celebrations 
le s get to the point  air power 
air power  field marshal 
briefly  please 
  air power is minimal 
  ammunition 
also minimal 
tanks    troops    replacements 
  minimal 
  morale 
nonexistent 
what do you think we should do 
end the war  you fools 
  why in the world are you laughing 
  excuse us 
we have such confidence in you 
everyone knows you have
never lost a battle 
i m still young  give me time 
the first thing we must do
is to turn this rabble
into something like an army 
anything at all on when
they plan to invade holland 
they seem to have paused in belgium 
most likely supply problems 
otherwise we can t imagine why 
i think i s because we re retreating
faster than they can advance 
how many vehicles in the past hour 
fifty four 
and for the same hour yesterday 
ninety eight 
last week your mother and i
could have captured holland alone 
already the panic has stopped 
it isn t over yet
and those idiots don t realise it 
  war takes time 
  listen to the expert 
i was nine when they got here 
next month i ll be 14 
i ought to know something 
father  the allies will come 
but when 
general browning s h  q    england
i ve just got back to england
from brussels 
where i had a meeting this morning
with field marshal montgomery 
there was an earlier one with general
eisenhower  they both feel  as i do 
that when the field marshal s plan
has succeeded 
we should be able to end the war
by christmas in less than 100 days 
actually  the plan s really very simple 
we re going to fly 35 000 men 300 miles
and drop them behind enemy lines 
i ll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted 
quite frankly  this kind of thing s
never been attempted before 
  where s this all gonna take place 
  holland 
  and when 
  i m coming to that now 
right 
ground forces  30 corps
commanded by general horrocks 
20 000 vehicles  and this  as you know 
is the german front line 
we re going to lay a carpet 
as it were 
of airborne troops 
over which 30th corps can pass 
we shall seize the bridges  
i s all a question of bridges  
with thunderclap surprise 
and hold them until they can be secured 
now  first of all 
general maxwell taylor  eindhoven 
you take and hold
the bridges there with 101 st 
general gavin  with your 82nd 
you get nijmegen 
you take and hold the bridges 
and  roy  you get the prize  arnhem 
arnhem bridge 
  and you hold it 
  for how long 
well  monty assures me that
30 corps will do the 63 miles in
two days 
  63 miles in two days 
  they ll handle that 
i m sorry  general sosabowski 
you go with your polish brigade
with roy urquhart  i m so sorry 
roy 
when you ve secured your bridge
and 30th corps have got across it 
we can turn east right into
the industrial heart of germany the ruhr 
once we control their factories  there s
not much they can do  that is the plan 
  and we go next sunday 
  seven days 
why not  the sooner we go  the better 
we ve got them on the run 
is something troubling you 
general sosabowski 
  i ve said nothing 
  precisely  your silences are thunderous 
general browning  i am a pole 
considered by some to be smart 
if that is so  it makes me
a member of a true minority group 
minority groups
are more comfortable in silence 
really  i should have thought the
opposite was true  but you do disapprove 
i am thrilled that your great field marshal
has devised such a plan 
i promise you
i will be properly ecstatic if it works 
  when it works 
  of course  when it works 
thank you 
well  now le s get down to the details 
first thing  we shall have to have a   
from which direction will their
attack come  and who will command 
montgomery or patton 
  model  what do you think 
  patton 
he is their best 
patton will lead the assault 
i would prefer montgomery
but even eisenhower isn t that stupid 
bittrich s panzer troops need some rest
if they re to stop patton 
we should pull them back
somewhere safe 
safe  quiet  out of the way  but where 
arnhem 
arnhem 
u s  82nd airborne division h  q    england
  why the emergency meeting 
  keeping me abreast of the little changes 
  how big are the little changes 
  with british understatement  gigantic 
they can t get us all in  too many men 
too much equipment  not enough planes 
i s going to take three days to get the
men into arnhem   poles and the british 
  how about us 
  except for parachuting in daylight 
  we have nothing to worry about 
  daylight 
  has it ever been tried before 
  not in a major drop 
  you think there s a reason for that 
  le s hope not 
  what do you think 
  i s a no moon period anyway 
we have to go in daylight 
just so they get us over the target area 
  half a mile away  i ll settle for that 
  i don t wanna hear anything else 
  is there anything else 
  well  you re my dutch advisor  harry 
i forgot to tell you something 
only that the germans first tried to take
nijmegen bridge themselves in 1940 
and got slaughtered 
go back 
go back 
do as i say 
but my friend lives down the road 
i s my birthday
and she has a present for me 
please let me through 
all right  be quick 
are you sure about the colours 
i m sure  father  believe me 
model 
a field marshal in arnhem  why 
the british will have an explanation 
did you pass on
the message about the tanks 
of course  but model is
something more important 
you re a good boy and a wonderful spy 
now go and help
your mother with supper 
sir 
  yes  fuller 
  we ve got some information on tanks 
dutch underground reports from arnhem 
  established their strength 
  no  but   
  have they been identified 
  not by us  sir 
  so i s the same rumours as before 
  i believe these rumours  sir 
why  the general consensus
is that our opposition
will consist entirely
of hitler youths or old men 
i don t really know why  sir  perhaps
because no one in intelligence does 
i just want to be sure our airborne carpet
consists of live troops  not dead ones 
i know everybody thinks
i m overanxious  sir 
but i would like to order
another low level reconnaissance 
if tha s all right with you  sir 
very well 
all right  wilson 
very well 
  fuller  fuller 
  yeah  sir 
i wouldn t be too concerned
about what people think of you 
you happen to be somewhat brighter than
most of us  it tends to make us nervous 
we ll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements 
but  please  keep in mind the one factor
which is crippling all our plans 
it may seem improbable to you  but we
are desperately short of transport aircraft 
  i am aware of that 
  i m surprised that nobody told monty
when he dreamed up this operation 
i need drop zones as close as possible
to the bridge  this area is no use at all 
can t have my chaps
landing on top of chimneys 
now  this looks inviting here 
wha s the terrain like 
sorry  sir  our reports indicate that
this terrain is too soft for glider landings 
the nose digs in on touchdown  the thing
goes arse over tip    total write off 
all right  what about there 
no  afraid not  sir  after the drop
when we bank for our return 
we run into a whole lot of flak and
rubbish from this jerry airfield at deelen 
presumably you re intending
to let us land somewhere 
ooh  yes  hopefully  sir 
but  as i was saying  we cannot afford to
lose a single aircraft  that is the problem 
my problem is
i don t just need drop zones 
i need drop zones i can hold and defend 
the rest of my division
arrives with a second drop
and general sosabowski s with a third 
i understand  sir  but we really think
we ve found the right place 
i s large enough for your needs 
i s flat and firm  and also easily defended 
  where the hell is it 
  i s not actually on this photograph 
it should be    excuse me  sir 
it would be about here  i think 
  that could be ten miles from the bridge 
  just under eight  actually 
if you d like to have a look at this 
you see  the terrain is easy to traverse 
all our information substantiates that 
yes  sir 
just making sure whose side you re on 
now  a drop zone
eight miles from arnhem bridge
  might be thought to present problems 
  my god  he can t mean it 
i m afraid he does 
he must know what he s doing 
tha s more than i know  why should
he have the corner on the market 
   cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal 
the gliders will bring in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps
fitted with twin vickers machine guns 
now  the instant we land  they will
race ahead to the bridge and hold it
  until the other battalions arrive on foot 
  they ll be able to secure both ends 
  most certainly 
  good  you all know where i shall be 
my headquarters will be
in the centre with 82nd 
remember we re all totally interlocked 
this is a bottom to top operation 
101 st pass 30 corps on to 82nd 
82nd pass them on to british airborne 
if any one group fails 
i s total failure for us all 
all we need now
are three days of clear skies 
thank you  gentlemen  very much 
only the weather can stop us now 
weather  chrystus 
general browning  what of the germans 
don t you think that since we know
that arnhem is so crucial to their safety 
they might know that too 
the few troops in the area
are second class 
they re not front line calibre 
not at all  do you understand 
have more faith
in montgomery s intelligence reports 
he s done pretty well for us
in the last few years 
i will tell you the extent of my faith 
i m thinking of asking for a letter stating
that i was forced to act on your orders 
in case my men are massacred 
i see 
yes  i do see 
do you wish such a letter 
no 
  no  of course not 
  in the case of massacre 
what difference would it make 
  you mean you don t believe me  sir 
  clearly not 
all right  boys  naafi s up 
take your break 
  god almighty 
  sorry about that  sir  but what  then 
the radios aren t strong enough to carry
from the drop zone to arnhem bridge 
  you don t have any cigarettes  do you 
  no 
they re perfectly ok  i ve used them
god knows how many times 
you ve told me that
god knows how many times 
well  i didn t have any problems
with them in the desert 
yes  i know  you see 
colonel  what bothers me 
what has me more than a bit disturbed 
is that holland being half underwater
is soggier than most deserts you find 
tends to have a lot more trees 
  any biscuits 
  your biscuits are in your tin  sir 
  tell the general  if you re so certain 
  if i were  believe me  i would 
  what if they really don t work 
  what difference will it make 
the general will be
on the bridge by nightfall 
he won t have to make contact
with the bridge if he s on it  will he  sir 
well    if anyone rocks the boat 
i s not gonna be me 
the regular projector chap s at lunch 
i ll have it in a moment 
you re doing splendidly  fuller 
don t worry  i don t need lunch 
damn 
nearly there  sir 
i s really worth your time  sir  believe me 
there 
splendid view of the dutch countryside 
no tanks 
wait a moment  sir  i s a lot clearer
in the next picture  if i can just   
now 
  next 
  yes  sir  i ve had this one enlarged 
yes  i shouldn t worry about them 
  but  sir  you see  they are tanks 
  i doubt if they re fully serviceable 
  still got guns 
  so have we 
but  sir    if they weren t serviceable 
why would they try to conceal them 
  normal routine  fuller 
  we keep getting reports from the dutch 
i ve read them 
and so has field marshal montgomery 
now  look here  there have been
thousands of photographs
from this sortie and all the others 
how many of them have shown tanks 
  just these  sir 
  you seriously want us to cancel
the biggest operation mounted since
d day because of three photographs 
  no  sir 
  16 consecutive drops
have been cancelled in the last
few months for one reason or another 
but this time the party s on 
and no one is going to call it off 
is that fully understood 
yes  sir 
general horrocks  xxx corps  h q 
leopoldsburg on the belgian dutch border
thank you  waddy 
thank you  gentlemen 
do sit down  gentlemen  please sit down 
look after these for me  will you 
thank you  gentlemen  thank you 
gentlemen  this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren 
and mightily bored they ll be 
the plan is called
operation market garden 
market is the airborne element
and garden the ground forces tha s us 
now  this is our position
on the belgian border here 
tomorrow three airborne divisions
will begin landing in holland 
35 000 men taking off from 24 airfields in
troop carrying planes or towed in gliders 
the american 101 st here 
around eindhoven 
the american 82nd here 
south of nijmegen 
and our own 1 st airborne boys
and a polish brigade here at arnhem 
64 miles behind enemy lines 
now  their job is to take and hold
all the bridges in these three areas 
our job is to punch a hole
through the german front line here
and then drive like hell up this road 
linking up with each airborne division
on the way up 
speed is the vital factor 
the plan is to reach eindhoven
in two to three hours 
and arnhem in two to three days 
that  gentlemen  is the prize 
the bridge over the rhine 
the last bridge between us and germany 
kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon 
the irish guards and colonel vandeleur
will take the lead 
  christ  not us again 
  what ïyou say to that  joe 
delighted  sir  truly delighted 
i ve selected you to lead us  not only due
to your extraordinary fighting ability 
but also because  in the unlikely event
that the germans ever get you 
they will assume from your attire
that you re a wretched peasant
and immediately send you on your way 
now  maintaining the speed of our
advance will no doubt be tough going 
as i s a single highway 
but  no matter what  we must reach
those 1 st airborne boys in 48 hours 
now  gentlemen 
i m not saying that this will be
the easiest party
that we ve ever attended 
but i still wouldn t miss it for the world 
i like to think of this as one of those
american western films 
the paratroops lacking substantial
equipment  always short of food 
these are the besieged homesteaders 
the germans 
well  naturally  they re the bad guys 
and 30 corps  we  my friends 
are the cavalry on the way to the rescue 
colonel frost s quarters
british 1st airborne division  england
oh  do you want me
to pack that as well  sir 
  no  thank you  wicks  i ll carry it

major fuller 
my name is sims  mind a bit of company 
of course not  sir 
busy times 
you must be exhausted 
are you  exhausted 
who isn t 
we ve been getting reports
from a number of your friends 
they re worried about you 
they think perhaps you need a rest 
we all need rest 
why are you saying this to me 
is it because i rocked the boat 
i m a doctor 
i m only concerned with your health 
i think perhaps you ought to take
a bit of sick leave 
but why 
i m not ill or anything 
i haven t done anything wrong 
no  of course not  you re just a little tired 
yes 
i am tired 
i think perhaps we might go 
can t it be stopped 
no 
i don t want to be left behind  please 
i s out of my hands  laddie 
i didn t want to miss the party 
come on  move it  buddy 
  come on  move yourselves 
  get up there  move on down 
home  sweet home 
when you think we only had seven days
to get everything organised  i s quite a   
bloody miracle  it took six months
to set up the d day drop 
and that was only half as big as this 
  how ïyou feel 
  fine 
i ll feel even better when we re in holland 
a few months back
when i was appointed to this command
i told you i had never jumped
but thought i ought to give it a go 
  well  you did me a big favour 
  oh  really  what 
you said  roy  you re far too old
for that kind of thing and much too large  
did i  what was the favour 
well  i didn t quite
tell you everything at the time 
  but i m prone to airsickness 
  good gracious  every flight 
we ll soon find out  won t we 
soon be home  harry 
  better than the desert  eh  sir 
  what was that 
easier than walking  sir 
if you say so  hancock 
yeah  fine  sir 
the artillery should be able to clear
the way pretty well your initial advance 
we ll move as soon as
their barrage has got going 
  yes  tha s absolutely fine 
  follow behind it as close as we can 
but this isn t going to be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is 
no  i didn t think so 
morning  alan  your sleeping beauties
know there s a war on  do they 
is it true that the germans
have put more troops ahead of us 
yes  they don t intend
to just let us walk in the front door 
hello  bob  hope tha s not
my funeral they re going to 
and i m still worried about
having to throw everything up this road 
but there s no alternative  morning  tom 
so i ve decided
to run the road like a railway 
nobody will be allowed to put any vehicle
on that road without my permission 
  including me 
  good luck  sir 
you too  especially you  joe 
morning  derek  glad to see
somebody knows where we re going

two groups are on the northern route 
h hour in 90 minutes

i s flak 
general bittrich s h q 
south of arnhem
general bittrich

just once to have
such power in my hands 
  red on 
  red on

on the road  we shall be all right 
b company to me 
a company over there 
field marshal model s h q 
hartenstein hotel near arnhem
excuse the interruption 
field marshal  but   
british paratroopers have landed   
three kilometres from here 
why should they do that 
there is nothing important here 
me  i am important 
they must all be coming
just to capture me 
call my chauffeur and car 
evacuate the headquarters 
and don t forget my cigars 
oh  god 
general  are you all right 
yeah 
ok  you guys  come on 
gather your stuff and move 
  this is it  jim 
  ok  sir 
you ok 
right  le s go 
then keep trying 
there must be someone there 
my apologies 
i can get no sense from anybody 
they say thousands of troops
are dropping over holland 
  yes  west of arnhem 
  right on top of field marshal model 
i can t get through to his headquarters 
a strong force has landed
south of nijmegen 
nijmegen  they re after the bridge 
that doesn t matter 
perhaps they ve landed
in the field marshal s soup 
yes  you d like that  wouldn t you 
now listen 
i ll take care of arnhem 
you get to nijmegen as fast as you can 
take anything tha ll move   
every man that can walk 
and hold the bridge 
no  field marshal model 
nothing must cross it  is that clear 
you must hold that bridge
under any circumstances 
  understood 
  clear 
  ryan and ross  come with me 
  cover the right flank 
  how far away is headquarters 
  half a mile  maybe more 
brigadier lathbury s just left  sir 
2nd battalion are on the river road 
good  thank you  baker  any news
of freddie gough s jeep squadron 
  i s unconfirmed   
  bad luck 
considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in 
a lot of the special jeeps failed to arrive 
those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush 
so no one s going to get to
arnhem bridge except on foot  splendid 
they must be from the lunatic asylum  sir 
i s located on the far side of the wood 
they escaped
when it was bombed this morning 
do you think
they know something we don t 
all guns commence firing 
get moving 
driver advance 
message received  thank you  out 
start the purple 
start the purple 
take cover 
  smoke loaded 
  fire 
come on  get the wounded down the line 
get that wreck off the road 
joe  how the hell    
how the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this 
you don t know the worst 
  this bit we re on now   
  yes 
i s the wide part 
peter general s coming in 
  how s it going now 
  not too well  sir 
we haven t made contact with
general browning  30 corps or england 
  so no one knows we ve arrived safely 
  not as far as we know  sir 
what about those vhf sets 
it appears the sets have been delivered
with the wrong crystals 
  so they re quite useless 
  yes  sir  i m afraid they are 
do brigadier lathbury and colonel frost
know about the jeep squadron 
not as far as we know  sir  we re unable
to contact any units moving into arnhem 
not a very satisfactory
state of affairs  steele 
  no  sir 
  we can t quite understand it  sir 
  i s perfectly good equipment 
  then get it sorted out 
before we have
a bloody disaster on our hands 
sir 
hancock  i ve got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods 
my original plan has been scuppered
now that the jeeps haven t arrived 
my communications
have completely broken down 
do you really believe that any of that
can be helped by a cup of tea 
wouldn t hurt  sir 
general bittrich s former h q 
now taken over by field marshal model
forgive me for returning  field marshal 
i must press for permission 
if it becomes necessary 
to blow up the bridges
at arnhem and nijmegen 
that is out of the question 
never  is that clear 
we need them for our counterattack 
counterattack  with what 
paratroopers cannot fight long 
they are too lightly equipped 
isolated they are lost 
i have spoken to von rundstedt 
all reinforcements come to us first 
every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker 
  but if we blow the bridges   
  they don t want the bridges 
do you really think
if they wanted the bridges   
they would have landed
12 kilometres away 
i s ridiculous 
thank you for the tea 
our lightning like assault on arnhem
bridge is certainly a smashing success 
i ve an aversion to apples  i m so sorry 
i m sure the germans will be surprised 
  are there many of you 
  yes  there are thousands of us 
thank you for coming  thank you 
  this isn t a victory parade  you know 
  come on  sir  enjoy the moment 
i will enjoy the moment when
we reach the bridge and find it intact 
it will be  things couldn t be going better 
nothing s wrong 
yes  i know 
tha s exactly what is wrong  harry  yes 
u s  101st airborne area
the son bridge
jesus christ 
stay down 
shit 
  there s still no contact  sir 
  keep at it  i shall be back shortly 
brigadier lathbury
can t have gone that far 
i m sure we ll have them fixed
by the time you get back  sir 
can you get a message
down to 30th corps on that dingus 
yes  sir  we just got word
from the 82nd up ahead 
they captured the grave bridge intact 
terrific  except 30th corps ain t about to
reach the goddamn intact grave bridge
until the goddamn son bridge is fixed 
tell our british cousins
to hustle up some bailey stuff 
i ll meet  em in eindhoven 
tell those schmucks to do this right
and have their bailey stuff at the front

giles  remember what the general said 
we re the cavalry  it would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule 
in the nick of time would do nicely 
these plans should have
been left in england 
they re top secret 
and now we have all we need  
units  defence plans  objectives
and the schedule for further drops 
i have prepared nijmegen bridge
for demolition
