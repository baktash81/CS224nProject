12000 feet
yiall right the airspeed indicator is to the left
i know that too its 192
ok honey take it easy
now i want you to find the autopilot
look to your right at the top of the panel
just below the windshield
yitheres a switch marked autopilot
it says command manual and off
yi i see it
dont touch it
is it in manual
its on manual
its on
i dont hear you honey
nancy press your mike button
yes
fine now we dont have
anything to worry about
were just gonna help the autopilot
make a turn
do exactly what i tell you
yiput your hand to the right of the console
yi the what
the flat panel just below the throttles
yitheres a grey knob
about the size of a milkbottle top
i see it
ok now slowly turn it to the right
nothings happening
ok honey try it to the left slowly
its not working theres nothing happening
it its not turning the plane
jesus its not working for turns
cant you tell us whats happening
they want us to change course
just like i told you its a very simple thing
there is a pilot on the radio telling her
what to do telling her exactly how to do it
pardon me what her
the first stewardess is at the controls
but she she is in constant touch
with the tower
the stewardess is flying the plane
could you keep your voice down
sure
the stewardess is flying the plane
thank you but i dont drink
what difference does it make now
youre right
no difference
alan
im scared
youre doing just fine honey
theres a problem with the autopilot
itll keep you straight and level
but im gonna help you
make the turns yourself
yi im gonna turn the plane
no sweat
put both hands on the wheel
theres a button under your left thumb
press it
whats that
yidont worry thats just an alarm
press it again
ok
all right honey youve got the airplane
just hold it steady until i tell you
yii want you to find the artificial horizon
on the instrument panel
yiits the little airplane
with a horizontal line through it
alan
i cant do this
yiwhy not you can do it nancy
yinancy come in
god damn it answer
ok ok im gonna try it
you scared the hell out of me honey
what do you think i am
ok what does your altimeter read nancy
11500 feet
yithats good all right now turn to the right
yiturn the wheel to the right slow and easy
turning
yigood read me your airspeed
its going down its only uh 184
yithats still all right just keep turning
183 182
shes climbing
get her nose down or shell stall
not till she finishes the turn
yi whats your airspeed now
180 its on 180
yiall right now turn the wheel to the left again
till it comes level
yinow ease the wheel forward just a little
yiwatch the little airplane in the instrument
yidont let it fall below the line
wings on the horizontal line
all right
ok let the autopilot take it back now
turn the switch in the top panel
back to manual
yitake your hands off the wheel
yiis the airplane level
yi yes
good job honey
you take a rest now
were almost to salt lake
we got a big problem look here
theres salt lake city and theres 409
look at the terrain in between
there is no way we can talk nancy
through those mountains to a safe landing
its just too much for her
the only way is to put a pilot into 409
you mean a midair transfer
a jet helicopter can keep up
we can put a man out on a tether
you know what it would be to do that
there isnt any other way
i think hes right the only question is who
me
no al youre too damn big
you gonna go shopping for somebody
right
ill call hill air force base
theyre the experts
you mean youre gonna try
to transfer a pilot into a 747 in flight
yes we need your cooperation
and the fastest helicopter youve got
now wait a minute you intend
to put one of our men on an umbilical
yi thats it
hows he gonna get inside
the way the stewardess described the hole
in the flight deck its big enough
if youll excuse me sir
i think its a stupid idea
thats all weve got
what have you got to help us
theres only one man
whos ever done anything like this
major john alexander in air rescue
i could try to contact him
who is your commanding officer
uh colonel moss sir
thank you this is exec one out
now the question is can we get there in time
yi columbia 409 salt lake approach
yiwe need another instrument reading nancy
yicome in columbia 409

jesus christ you cant believe this
theres a big hole in the flight deck

some operations
uhoh theres a crease
on the inboard section of the starboard wing
i see some fuel coming off the trailing edge
if this had happened at 20000 feet forget it
plot a rendezvous point
have the 47 make a 180 and bring her back
we gotta make sure she holds altitude
colonel moss is on his way
whats the fuel situation
we have a complication
the airforce fighter says
theres a fuel leak in the right wing
oh damn

shed better be
how much can we ask of her
theres a call for you mr patroni

clearing everything out of our la office
our concern is for the safety
of those people excuse me
whos that
a guy named purcell
owns a tv station
