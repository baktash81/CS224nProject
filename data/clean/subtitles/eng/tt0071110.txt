  do you want me to come with you 
  no 
oh  and mom  remember
the 747 s the best aircraft ever made 
it can almost fly by itself 
dad calls it the big pussy cat 
i remember 
nancy  this is al  honey 
we re in exec one on the way to salt lake 
we ve cleared this frequency 
do you read me 
 y i yes  i read you 
fine  now  we don t have too much time 
sit in the pilot s seat
and do exactly what i tell you 
o    ok 
ready 
now  look at the instrument panel 
the altimeter is marked alt 
 y i   i know that 
  what does it read  honey 
12 000 feet 
 y i all right  the airspeed indicator is to the left 
i know that too  it s 192 
ok  honey  take it easy 
now i want you to find the autopilot 
look to your right  at the top of the panel 
just below the windshield 
 y i there s a switch marked autopilot 
it says command  manual and off 
 y i   i see it 
  don t touch it 
  is it in manual 
  it s on manual 
it s on 
i don t hear you  honey 
nancy  press your mike button 
yes 
fine  now  we don t have
anything to worry about 
we re just gonna help the autopilot
make a turn 
do exactly what i tell you 
 y i put your hand to the right of the console 
 y i   the what 
  the flat panel just below the throttles 
 y i there s a grey knob
about the size of a milk bottle top 
i see it 
ok  now slowly turn it to the right 
nothing s happening 
ok  honey  try it to the left  slowly 
it s not working  there s nothing happening 
it    it s not turning the plane 
jesus  it s not working for turns 
can t you tell us what s happening 
they want us to change course 
just like i told you  it s a very simple thing 
there is a pilot on the radio telling her
what to do  telling her exactly how to do it 
pardon me  what her 
the first stewardess is at the controls 
but she    she is in constant touch
with the tower 
the stewardess is flying the plane 
  could you keep your voice down 
  sure 
the stewardess is flying the plane 
thank you  but i don t drink 
what difference does it make now 
you re right 
no difference 
alan 
  i m scared 
  you re doing just fine  honey 
there s a problem with the autopilot 
it ll keep you straight and level
but i m gonna help you
make the turns yourself 
 y i   i m gonna turn the plane 
  no sweat 
put both hands on the wheel 
there s a button under your left thumb 
press it 
what s that 
 y i don t worry  that s just an alarm 
press it again 
ok 
all right  honey  you ve got the airplane 
just hold it steady until i tell you 
 y i i want you to find the artificial horizon
on the instrument panel 
 y i it s the little airplane
with a horizontal line through it 
alan 
i can t do this 
 y i why not  you can do it  nancy 
 y i nancy  come in 
god damn it  answer 
ok  ok  i m gonna try it 
  you scared the hell out of me  honey 
  what do you think i am 
ok  what does your altimeter read  nancy 
11 500 feet 
 y i that s good  all right  now  turn to the right 
 y i turn the wheel to the right  slow and easy 
turning 
 y i good  read me your airspeed 
it s going down  it s only  uh    184 
 y i that s still all right  just keep turning 
183  182 
she s climbing 
get her nose down or she ll stall 
not till she finishes the turn 
 y i   what s your airspeed now 
  180  it s on 180 
 y i all right  now turn the wheel to the left again
till it comes level 
 y i now ease the wheel forward  just a little 
 y i watch the little airplane in the instrument 
 y i don t let it fall below the line 
wings on the horizontal line 
all right 
ok  let the autopilot take it back now 
turn the switch in the top panel
back to manual 
 y i take your hands off the wheel 
 y i is the airplane level 
 y i   yes 
  good job  honey 
you take a rest now 
we re almost to salt lake 
we got a big problem  look here 
there s salt lake city and there s 409 
look at the terrain in between 
there is no way we can talk nancy
through those mountains to a safe landing 
it s just too much for her 
  the only way is to put a pilot into 409 
  you mean a mid air transfer 
a jet helicopter can keep up 
we can put a man out on a tether 
  you know what it would be to do that 
  there isn t any other way 
i think he s right  the only question is  who 
  me 
  no  al  you re too damn big 
  you gonna go shopping for somebody 
  right 
i ll call hill air force base 
they re the experts 
you mean you re gonna try
to transfer a pilot into a 747 in flight 
yes  we need your cooperation
and the fastest helicopter you ve got 
now  wait a minute  you intend
to put one of our men on an umbilical 
 y i   that s it 
  how s he gonna get inside 
the way the stewardess described the hole
in the flight deck  it s big enough 
if you ll excuse me  sir 
i think it s a stupid idea 
that s all we ve got 
what have you got to help us 
there s only one man
who s ever done anything like this 
major john alexander in air rescue 
i could try to contact him 
who is your commanding officer 
  uh    colonel moss  sir 
  thank you  this is exec one out 
now the question is  can we get there in time 
 y i  columbia 409  salt lake approach 
 y i we need another instrument reading  nancy 
 y i come in  columbia 409 
 y i nancy  come in  please  come in  nancy 
salt lake approach  air force t37
sage 14 approaching columbia 747 
the aircraft is in level flight 
the flaps are about ten degrees since
the collision occurred during descent 
look  mom  there s another airplane out there 
  where 
  right out there 
  oh    my god  there is 
  an air force jet 
jesus christ  you can t believe this 
there s a big hole in the flight deck 
doesn t look like there s any other damage 
all four engines seem to be running 
hard to tell instrument damage 
most of it s near the engineer s panel 
front part looks ok 
he s probably checking the damage 
  i ll bet he s gonna help us 
  he is 
can you see the fighter now  nancy 
it should be on your right 
 y i   yes  i see it 
  he ll look you over and report the damage 
nancy  the executive plane is landing here
now  we ll have help up to you real soon 
good 
do you really think they can do anything 
they ll do everything that can be done 
you betcha  my dad runs the airlines 
well  almost 
what does he mean
about running this airline 
my husband is vice president of operations 
some operations 
uh oh  there s a crease
on the inboard section of the starboard wing 
i see some fuel coming off the trailing edge 
if this had happened at 20 000 feet  forget it 
plot a rendezvous point 
have the  47 make a 180 and bring her back 
  we gotta make sure she holds altitude 
  colonel moss is on his way 
  what s the fuel situation 
  we have a complication 
the air force fighter says
there s a fuel leak in the right wing 
  oh  damn 
  that nancy s some woman 
  she d better be 
  how much can we ask of her 
  there s a call for you  mr patroni 
  everything  i guess 
yeah 
your information is correct  but we re
clearing everything out of our la office 
our concern is for the safety
of those people  excuse me 
  who s that 
  a guy named purcell 
owns a tv station 
he s sending a remote unit 
what  we don t have any bodies yet 
take it easy 
we ll need all the good press we can get 
let s go find that colonel
and get that rendezvous course plotted 
oh  my jewel case 
it s bomb proofed 
the insurance people insisted upon it 
oh    my idea of heaven
is never to have to pack or unpack 
why didn t i think of that before  here 
here  you know what 
to hell with the jewellery 
let s put my book in here 
thank you 
here you are  my darlings  it s all yours 
i never wanted to have the damn thing
published while i was alive anyway 
colonel  will this thing work 
it ll be like putting a raw egg
back in its shell 
your pilot confirmed
the hole looks like it s big enough 
it s a hell of a risk  a long shot 
how long before that helicopter gets here 
about ten minutes 
i gotta clear with washington 
make it fast 
do we have any morphine in the first aid kit 
no  i m sure we have some sedatives 
no  help 
  yes  we ll help you 
  it will put you to sleep 
no 
maybe    help 
i understand  he wants to stay conscious
in case he can help us later on 
 y i salt lake approach 
do you read me  nancy 
this is nancy  go ahead 
in a while we ll take you
through a 180 degree turn like we did before 
captain murdock will talk you through it 
no sweat  ok 
 y i   i m not looking forward to it 
  hang in there  nancy  you ll do fine 
you re doing great 
 y i we want you to look
at the flight engineer s panel 
 y i in the centre  just above the deck 
 y i tell us what the third
fuel used gauge reads  over 
uh    22 500 pounds 
why  is something wrong 
 y i no  we just want to keep track
of the rate of fuel flow 
 y i   we re not running low  are we 
  no chance 
there s always an extra amount just in case 
and the captain always adds a few
thousand pounds for his wife and kids 
 y i even his mother in law 
nancy  come in  nancy 
hello  this is nancy  can you hear me 
come in  409  nancy  do you read me 
flight 409 calling salt lake 
nancy  come in  409 
this is flight 409 calling salt lake  come in

  what s the matter 
  some fluid s coming out of the wing 
there s gas coming out of the wing 
  i don t wanna hear that 
  he doesn t wanna hear it 
  what the hell is that 
  that ll be mr purcell

she is his wife 
what the hell s she doing here 
trying to locate her husband

  why don t you go talk to them 
  you haven t bothered to find out 
no  we re too busy
trying to save the 120 that are up there 
why don t you just let us get on with our job 
i think it would be good public relations
to talk with her 
it was your plane that killed him 
listen  you son of a bitch 
take it easy  joe

al  sometimes the public s right to know
gives me a huge pain in the ass

trapped aboard the giant jet liner
without pilot and without crew 
and tragedy within tragedy 
one of them a young girl dying
unless she s delivered to la soon
for a kidney transplant operation 
major alexander has volunteered
to make this daring attempt 
he will be lowered on a line

 y i read it again  honey  read it as it changes 
seven nine  seven eight   
she s gotta get that altitude back 
she s only got 1 500 feet 
keep turning just the way you re doing  honey 
but at the same time ease the wheel back
 y i till you see the little plane lift up a bit 
nancy  have you done that 
yes  i think so

409  do you read 
they found the small plane 
it exploded on impact 
the radio s dead 
we re all alone now  bette 
the winch will hold your position  ok 
  got it  sir 
  got it 
you ll find you can control
lateral movement somewhat 
using the wind pressure against my body 
you ll have to signal us
for in and out movement 
i must have made 20 drops in nam  sir 
but what you re gonna do
scares the hell out of me 
me too 
  nancy 
  oh  my god 
bette  we re too low 
what are you supposed to do 
i don t know  uh   
i know they re worried about airspeed 
now  if we climb 
the airspeed drops 
i could stall us out 
the captain  he said he could help us 
do you understand me  captain 
thrust levers 
the thrust levers  what about them 
forward    an inch 
a    all right  anything else 
190    hold 
one    nine    zero   
   airspeed 
i ve done a few screwy things in this outfit 
but this ll be a first 
she ll handle a lot like that 707 tanker
you re used to flying 
once you get her on the ground 
you re still three storeys in the air 
i ll let you know if it s true
about not making a bad landing in a 747 
control reports 409 s lost radio contact 
  what about the altitude 
  had they made correction 
negative 
  what s our eta at rendezvous 
  a few minutes 
they haven t got a few minutes 
  we should see her soon 
  probably be below us  be harder to see 
  two minutes to eta 
  she s gotta be out there somewhere 
there she is 
she s flying it  she s flying it herself 
climb  baby  climb 
look at the mountains  we re so close 
ready  sir
