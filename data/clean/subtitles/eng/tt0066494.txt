bye
cab
suddenly occurs want go america
first time opportunitys ever presented
thoughts drift toward sea toward side
taking last look back seen skyscrapers
fading flurry snowflakes
see looming ghostly way left
see lights creeping ribs
see whole city spread harlem battery
streets choked ants theatres empty
wonder vague way whatever happened wife
everything quietly sifted head
great peace came
river gently winds girdle hills
lies soil saturated past
however far back mind roams one never detach
human background
christ
eyes shimmers golden peace
neurotic could dream turning head away
quietly flows seine one hardly notices presence
always quiet unobtrusive
like great artery running human body
wonderful peace falls
seems id climbed top high mountain
little able look around
take meaning landscape
human beings make strange fauna flora
distance appear negligible
close theyre apt appear ugly malicious
anything need surrounded sufficient space
space even time
sun setting
feel river flowing
past ancient soil
changing climate
hills gently girdle
course fixed
