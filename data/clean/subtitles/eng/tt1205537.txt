this looks good
male news anchor
the world bank urging caution
as volatilities in emerging markets
continue to remind investors
that with unprecedented
global interconnectivity
even the strongest economies
are vulnerable to collapse
this just in
last minute negotiations
are expected today
as the security council of
the united nations votes
russias bitterly opposed
to a new turkish pipeline
which could see russian economic
dominance of oil exports shattered
the big question
will the us defy russia
american diplomat the only thing
that the turks and the georgians
would undermine with their pipeline
is russias monopoly on the eastern
european natural gas market
we both know that
if yöu block our proposal
and the pipeline is approved
oil falls below 79 a barrel
and the russian government
goes bankrupt
in our judgment
yöur assessment is extreme
thank yöu
our request comes
from my countrys highest level
and it is respectfully denied from mine
then we will regard this
as an act of economic war
male news anchor
while wall street talks up
the robust performance of the dollar
many commentators look to the un
and the bitter standoff
between the united states and russia
the us has the upper hand for now
but fears exist about exactly how
an angry russia
and russian business will react
to the likely disastrous effects
for the russian economy
of americas un veto
chiming
suspenseful music playing
whispers tell him he will need
somebody in moscow
hell want yöu
no im just an analyst
our russian partners
are hiding accounts from us
its um all in the data
nobody else understands the data
harper will want yöu

male news anchor overseas
where we see
a surprisingly sturdy
performance by the dollar
holding its ground in spite of
the turkish pipeline vote at the un
and the latest deficit news
anika yöur reaction
well surprised
pleased certainly but this is extremely
unusual behavior by the market
commodities should be moving in
the opposite direction of the dollar
yöud see a very different direction
by investors as well
they usually waver
from one day to the next
ls work okay
yeah yeah it was good
sorry about that yeah
so yöu feel like a movie this weekend

anything yöu activate

somebody who just
just came up behind me too quick
jesus
how do yöu get over something like that
if yöure lucky yöu get past it
thats not the same thing
no it isnt
now talk me through
yöur very scary memo
but keep in mind i dont have yöur phd
two weeks ago
i noticed a series of accounts
in our russian partners records
to which our companys
computers are denied access
massive currency accounts
all in us treasuries
people speaking indistinctly
cherevins made a total
commitment to us dollars
when theres been
a hurricane in the gulf
and a string of negative
economic reports
what does it mean
its external sterilized intervention
like im an idiot please
the dollar should be going down
but its up
a few cents every day the past week
i think theyre propping us up
why
i think theres a coordinated plot
within russia
to collapse the dollar
and crash the us economy
and its going to happen soon
itll be timed to follow a terrorist attack
on us soil
no thatd be crazy
the russians would lose
as much as anybody in a collapse
no no no no
the chinese will lose more
and once the russians start to sell
the rest of the world is gonna
dump every dollar they have
all right lets say its happened
lets say yöure right
whats the aftermath
theyll recover
we wont
we dont have their oil reserves
were looking at the panic of 1837
the panic of 1893
the soviet famine of 1932
hyperinflation
bread lines rioting
i know i get it
and at first though
theyll call it the american crisis
but within about six weeks
theyre gonna start calling it what it is
the second great depression
the attack and the selloff have
to be timed to each other
a massive series of transactions like that
have to be programmed in advance
and stored in cherevins system
once i start the audit i can get the date
and time of the attack
down to the minute
yöu stick to
the scheduled audit tomorrow
everything official everything in public
yöull be fine
i need for yöu to be fine
yöur room should be clean by now
well put a watch on it
i drowned him
in about that much water
yöu know yöu sold this as an office job
yöure not just an analyst anymore
yöure operational now

viktor cherevin
jack ryan
how was yöur flight
fine thank yöu
and the jet lag
that first night can be brutal
i survived
thats a nice painting napoleon at war
so yöu know yöur history
what can i do for yöu
routine audit
so routine it couldnt
be done from new york
not when yöure
concealing accounts from us
yöu americans like to think
of yöurselves as direct
but i wonder if perhaps yöu are just rude
yöu russians think
of yöurselves as poets
but perhaps yöure just touchy
chuckles softly
nothing here is concealed
only secured
computer chimes
excuse me
beeps
i hope i can count on
full access to yöur account files
yöu wont need it
i ordered the companies
which concerned yöu
quite unnecessarily i might add
to be sold at a profit
yöur firms percentages
are detailed in this report
the funds were transferred this morning
too late alas
to stop yöu from getting on yöur flight
so yöu see an audit would be
quite without purpose at this point
mr ryan
i see
partnerships are delicate mr ryan
sometimes they end violently
dimitri lemkov our head of security
jack ryan
im sorry yöu had to come all this
way for nothing mr ryan
stammers i hear the finest restaurant
in moscow is across the street um
in honor of our partnership and to
quite frankly
apologize for my mistake
perhaps i could take yöu to dinner
no
but ill take yöu
and i insist my driver
pick yöu up from yöur hotel
moscow can be very dangerous
our own man for example
who collected yöu from the airport
embee
we are very concerned
he has simply disappeared
im sorry to hear that
no doubt he will turn up in a day or two
hungover and remorseful
will yöur wife be joining us tonight
uh
chuckles
im not married
oh
i was just told that
she had arrived at yöur hotel
uh my girlfriend
even better and our little secret
yöure having fun with me
not nearly enough bring her along
tonight we wont go otherwise
ill be sure to ask
a pleasure to have met yöu both
speaking russian
hes dangerous
office phones ringing
speaking russian
i lost him
yöure done already
hes outplayed us
yöu didnt get anything
nothing not one thing
he sold all the assets
chuckles humorlessly
he probably moved them
to other shell companies
but i cant audit
what they technically dont own
all right we still need the algorithm
yeah
yeah i invited him to dinner
the restaurant is across the street
from his building
what if we uh
what if what
sighs i dont know
what jack
well what if we
yöu wanna break into their system
yeah i think someone should
yöu think we can
yeah i dont know
put it up the restaurant
jack the orders to sell
the dollar would be
encrypted on the computer
of the security director
dimitri lemkov
former fsb
jack we cant break into his office
its secured six different ways
so what about the office next to his
well thats cherevins
can we get into that
maybe someone could
if they had his access card
were developing a security guard
but we dont have him yet
well develop harder
he drinks right
like a russian
also chases women
the more married the better
okay tell yöur guy once hes in there
he needs to enable all encrypted
financial sell order packages
tell him to look for dark pool algorithms
and if yöur guy if the guy
im the guy arent i
yeah yöure going to be great
but yöuve got another problem jack
so i dropped everything
and i called in every favor that i knew
and i spent four hours
at the consulate begging for a visa
yöu know
i wanted to make this grand gesture
i wanted yöu to see
what yöu meant to me
so im here laughs
sighs and yöu have to say something
well maybe its
maybe its awful or hurtful or shameful
i dont know but yöu have to talk to me
yöu cant let me think
that im crazy anymore
because now i know that im not
just talk to me
will yöu meet me halfway
im in the cia
thank god
sighs i thought
yöu were having an affair
speaking russian
ls everything in place
yes mr cherevin our asset
in the us has been contacted
hes prepared
yes sir merely awaiting yöur order
we will strike tomorrow
very well sir
sell orders have all been entered

the prodigal returns
he may not be a regular churchgoer
but hes a good man my son

mrs borovsky and he already
has a job at the auto plant

lamentations
priest continues in russian

country some playing on radio
hey
hey
excuse me

yöu look kind of lost
gagging
pants
dog barking in distance
so ill have to keep him busy
at the table for what
ten minutes to be on the safe side
what are yöu talking about
yöure not going
yöu said he insisted i come to dinner
itll look suspicious if i dont show up
no no it wont
harper shes right jack
to him something will be off
yöure not involving her in this
yöu involved me in this by not telling me
yöu got to get her out of here
send her home
well what are yöu gonna tell cherevin
that im homesick
these are dangerous people cathy
yöu cannot be here
if yöud told me who yöu really were
i wouldnt be
i took an oath
i took an oath
i couldnt tell yöu
unless we were married
and yöu wouldnt marry me
thats why yöu wanted to marry me
so that yöu could tell somebody
that yöu were in the cia
no of course not
yöu lied to me for three years
and yöu were good at it
i think yöu actually enjoyed it
can we have a minute please
no yöu cant
i would like to talk to jack alone
this is geopolitics
its not couples therapy
do i really have to remind yöu
whats at stake here jack
theres a very real scenario here
where we dont get out of this alive
any of us
and neither do a lot
of innocent people back home
now we had about eight minutes
to discuss this little
this little development
we just used four of them
we dont need yöu to break
into lemkovs computer
just into the office next to his
yöu plug this into any 220 outlet
that shares the same wall with him
we use the buildings own electrical
wiring to access lemkovs hard drive
how much time will he need
to run the program
five six minutes including movement
harper so the answer
to yöur question yes
10 minutes at the table ought to do it
all right
harper yöu know we catch
a few breaks we can all be
headed home on a plane by midnight
cherevin will be at dinner in
cathy
harper 55 minutes
then i should get dressed
cathy
i like her
if cherevin touches her ill kill him
its just dinner jack
the most he can do is look
and to be honest we need him to
