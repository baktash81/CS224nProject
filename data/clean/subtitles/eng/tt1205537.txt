male news anchor 
the world bank urging caution
as volatilities in emerging markets
continue to remind investors
that with unprecedented
global interconnectivity 
even the strongest economies
are vulnerable to collapse 
this just in 
last minute negotiations
are expected today
as the security council of
the united nations votes 
russia s bitterly opposed
to a new turkish pipeline 
which could see russian economic
dominance of oil exports shattered 
the big question 
will the u s  defy russia 
american diplomat  the only thing
that the turks and the georgians
would undermine with their pipeline
is russia s monopoly on the eastern
european natural gas market 
we both know that 
if yöu block our proposal
and the pipeline is approved 
oil falls below  79 a barrel
and the russian government
goes bankrupt 
in our judgment 
yöur assessment is extreme 
thank yöu 
our request comes
from my country s highest level 
and it is respectfully denied from mine 
then we will regard this
as an act of economic war 
male news anchor 
while wall street talks up
the robust performance of the dollar 
many commentators look to the u n 
and the bitter standoff
between the united states and russia 
the u s  has the upper hand for now 
but fears exist about exactly how
an angry russia
and russian business will react
to the likely disastrous effects
for the russian economy
of america s u n  veto 
 chiming 
 suspenseful music playing 
 whispers  tell him he will need
somebody in moscow 
  he ll want yöu 
  no  i m just an analyst

performance by the dollar 
holding its ground in spite of
the turkish pipeline vote at the u n 
and the latest deficit news 
anika  yöur reaction 
well  surprised 
pleased certainly  but this is extremely
unusual behavior by the market 
commodities should be moving in
the opposite direction of the dollar 
yöu d see a very different direction
by investors as well 
they usually waver
from one day to the next   
ls work okay 
yeah  yeah  it was good

it s better they re shaking
afterwards than during 
first person i ever killed 
jack  was innocent 
  what did he do 
  she 
she didn t do anything 
she was a bystander 
somebody who just   
just came up behind me too quick 
jesus 
how do yöu get over something like that 
if yöu re lucky  yöu get past it 
  that s not the same thing 
  no  it isn t 
now talk me through
yöur very scary memo 
but keep in mind i don t have yöur ph d 
two weeks ago 
i noticed a series of accounts
in our russian partner s records
to which our company s
computers are denied access 
massive currency accounts 
all in u s  treasuries 
 people speaking indistinctly 
cherevin s made a total
commitment to u s  dollars
when there s been
a hurricane in the gulf
and a string of negative
economic reports 
what does it mean 
it s external sterilized intervention 
like i m an idiot  please 
the dollar should be going down 
but it s up 
a few cents every day  the past week 
i think they re propping us up 
why  
i think there s a coordinated plot
within russia
to collapse the dollar
and crash the u s  economy 
and it s going to happen soon 
it ll be timed to follow a terrorist attack
on u s  soil 
no  that d be crazy 
the russians would lose
  as much as anybody in a collapse 
  no  no  no  no 
the chinese will lose more 
and once the russians start to sell 
the rest of the world is gonna
dump every dollar they have 
all right  let s say it s happened 
let s say yöu re right 
what s the aftermath 
they ll recover 
we won t 
we don t have their oil reserves 
we re looking at the panic of 1837 
the panic of 1893 
the soviet famine of 1932 
hyperinflation 
bread lines  rioting 
i know  i get it 
and at first  though 
they ll call it the american crisis 
but within about six weeks 
they re gonna start calling it what it is 
the second great depression 
the attack and the sell off have
to be timed to each other 
a massive series of transactions like that
have to be programmed in advance
and stored in cherevin s system 
once i start the audit  i can get the date
and time of the attack
down to the minute 
yöu stick to
the scheduled audit tomorrow 
everything official  everything in public 
yöu ll be fine 
i need for yöu to be fine 
yöur room should be clean by now 
we ll put a watch on it 
i drowned him 
in about that much water 
yöu know  yöu sold this as an office job 
yöu re not just an analyst anymore 
yöu re operational now

i may be here a few days

jack ryan 
  how was yöur flight 
  fine  thank yöu 
and the jet lag 
that first night can be brutal 
i survived 
that s a nice painting  napoleon at war 
so  yöu know yöur history 
what can i do for yöu 
routine audit 
so routine it couldn t
be done from new york 
not when yöu re
concealing accounts from us 
yöu americans like to think
of yöurselves as direct 
but i wonder if perhaps yöu are just rude 
yöu russians think
of yöurselves as poets 
but perhaps yöu re just touchy 
 chuckles softly 
nothing here is concealed 
only secured 
 computer chimes 
excuse me 
 beeps 
i hope i can count on
full access to yöur account files 
yöu won t need it 
i ordered the companies
which concerned yöu 
quite unnecessarily  i might add 
to be sold  at a profit 
yöur firm s percentages
are detailed in this report 
the funds were transferred this morning 
too late  alas 
to stop yöu from getting on yöur flight 
so  yöu see  an audit would be
quite without purpose at this point 
mr  ryan 
i see 
partnerships are delicate  mr  ryan 
sometimes  they end violently 
dimitri lemkov  our head of security 
jack ryan 
i m sorry yöu had to come all this
way for nothing  mr  ryan 
 stammers  i hear the finest restaurant
in moscow is across the street  um   
in honor of our partnership and to 
quite frankly 
apologize for my mistake 
perhaps i could take yöu to dinner 
no 
but i ll take yöu 
and i insist my driver
pick yöu up from yöur hotel 
moscow can be very dangerous 
our own man  for example 
who collected yöu from the airport 
embee 
we are very concerned 
he has simply disappeared 
i m sorry to hear that 
no doubt he will turn up in a day or two 
hung over and remorseful 
will yöur wife be joining us tonight 
uh   
 chuckles 
  i m not married 
  oh 
i was just told that
she had arrived at yöur hotel 
uh  my girlfriend 
even better  and our little secret 
yöu re having fun with me 
not nearly enough  bring her along
tonight  we won t go otherwise 
i ll be sure to ask 
a pleasure to have met yöu both 
 speaking russian 
he s dangerous 
 office phones ringing 
 speaking russian 
i lost him 
yöu re done already 
he s outplayed us 
yöu didn t get anything 
nothing  not one thing 
he sold all the assets 
 chuckles humorlessly 
he probably moved them
to other shell companies 
but i can t audit
what they technically don t own 
  all right  we still need the algorithm 
  yeah 
yeah  i invited him to dinner 
the restaurant is across the street
from his building 
what if we  uh   
what if what 
   sighs  i don t know 
  what  jack 
well  what if we   
yöu wanna break into their system 
  yeah  i think someone should 
  yöu think we can 
yeah    i don t know 
put it up  the restaurant 
jack  the orders to sell
the dollar would be
encrypted on the computer
of the security director 
dimitri lemkov 
former fsb 
jack  we can t break into his office 
it s secured six different ways 
so  what about the office next to his 
well  that s cherevin s 
can we get into that 
maybe someone could
if they had his access card 
we re developing a security guard 
but we don t have him yet 
well  develop harder 
he drinks  right 
like a russian 
also chases women 
the more married  the better 
okay  tell yöur guy once he s in there 
he needs to enable all encrypted
financial sell order packages 
tell him to look for dark pool algorithms 
and if yöur guy  if the guy   
i m the guy  aren t i 
yeah  yöu re going to be great 
but yöu ve got another problem  jack 
so i dropped everything 
and i called in every favor that i knew
and i spent four hours
at the consulate begging for a visa 
yöu know 
i wanted to make this grand gesture 
i wanted yöu to see

man   on radio

 country some playing on radio 
hey 
hey 
  excuse me 
   song continues playing 
yöu look kind of lost

what are yöu talking about 
yöu re not going 
yöu said he insisted i come to dinner 
  it ll look suspicious if i don t show up 
  no  no  it won t 
harper  she s right  jack 
to him  something will be off 
yöu re not involving her in this 
yöu involved me in this by not telling me 
yöu got to get her out of here 
send her home 
well  what are yöu gonna tell cherevin 
that i m homesick 
these are dangerous people  cathy 
yöu cannot be here 
if yöu d told me who yöu really were 
i wouldn t be 
i took an oath 
i took an oath 
i couldn t tell yöu
unless we were married 
  and yöu wouldn t marry me 
  that s why yöu wanted to marry me 
so that yöu could tell somebody
  that yöu were in the cia 
  no  of course not 
yöu lied to me for three years
and yöu were good at it 
i think yöu actually enjoyed it 
can we have a minute  please 
no  yöu can t 
i would like to talk to jack alone 
this is geopolitics 
it s not couples therapy 
do i really have to remind yöu
what s at stake here  jack 
there s a very real scenario here
where we don t get out of this alive 
any of us 
and neither do a lot
of innocent people back home 
now  we had about eight minutes
to discuss this little   
this little development 
we just used four of them 
we don t need yöu to break
into lemkov s computer 
just into the office next to his 
yöu plug this into any 220 outlet
that shares the same wall with him 
we use the building s own electrical
wiring to access lemkov s hard drive 
how much time will he need
to run the program 
five  six minutes  including movement 
harper  so the answer
to yöur question  yes 
10 minutes at the table ought to do it 
all right 
harper  yöu know  we catch
a few breaks  we can all be
headed home on a plane by midnight 
cherevin will be at dinner in   
  cathy 
  harper  55 minutes 
  then i should get dressed 
  cathy 
i like her 
if cherevin touches her  i ll kill him 
it s just dinner  jack 
the most he can do is look 
and to be honest  we need him to
