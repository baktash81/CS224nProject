you know
hey mom can i uh
can i talk to you later
okay love you bye
hey ellie are you hungry
hey you get down from there
the trick is
to get the stinger out
real quick

no prize winner
but shell do for a ribbon
there you go
yeah
should be starting
to quiet down now
youre the doctors
little girl
eleanor creed
but you can call me ellie
im judson crandall
you can call me jud
all right up you get
what is this place
pet cemetery
didnt you read the sign
yeah they spelled it wrong
these are all peoples pets
well the whole towns been
using this place for generations
i saw those kids
they were all
wearing those masks
yeah
a lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it
see this one over here
i carved this myself
thats my dog biffer
and its true
he was a hell of a sniffer
ellie
you know better than to wander
off by yourself come here
mommy this is jud
our neighbor
i got stung by a bee
he pulled the stinger out
it was a big un
hmm nice to meet you maam
nice to meet you too
im rachel ellies mom
you know these woods
its not really all that safe
to go roaming around in em
people can get lost up here
thank you jud
um we should get back okay
honey you cant
wander off like that
i dont know where you are
i cant do anything
just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting
jud
come back
dad
yeah
why dont pets
live as long as people
well
do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism
the clock in your body
yes
humans have
a slow metabolism
a slow clock
so we live longer
whereas cats and dogs
well they have
a fast metabolism
which means
when it runs out
they die and go
to the pet cemetery
yeah
ellie discovered
a charming little landmark
in the woods today
right in our backyard
okay well that doesnt have to
be such a bad thing does it hmm
a place to bury our pets
and remember them
it might seem scary but its not
its perfectly natural
just like dying
is natural hmm
we all die and eventually
one way or another
we all go back
into the ground
what daddys
trying to say
is that even though the pets
body goes in the ground
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven
just like nana creed
remember how i told you
shes looking down on you
well we dont
actually know
that it works
exactly like that
what mommy and daddy
are trying to say
is that you dont have to worry about
this sweetheart okay
church and mommy and me
were gonna be around a long long time
and gage
of course sweetie
gage is just a kid
but what about
your sister mommy
wasnt she just a kid
when she died
rachel
rachel
you okay
what was that in there
funny i wanted to ask you
the same thing
rachel ellies
almost nine years old
we should be able
to talk to her about this
ellies a child
and death for her is scary
please rachel doesnt mean
we should shield her from it
and you think
thats what im doing
i think that all this talk
about the afterlife
about people
looking down on her
i think
yeah i think its delaying
getting to the heart
of the matter yes
so you you really dont
think theres anything
after we die
no heaven no nothing
no
right were gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep
it could be allergies
but we just want to be sure
marcella please tell me
its almost lunch

my parents
left me alone with her
i was supposed
to bring her dinner

because of me
i watched them
wheel her body out
but i swear
she was still in the walls
and at night
i could hear her moving
calling out my name
rachel
i didnt know who to call

room and given her her food

el what is this
i dont know
gage drew that
gage
come on daddys got you
daddys got you
i was 11
when i lost biff
hed run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected
daddy had to put him down
out of mercy
your dad took you up there
no no
it was an old fella
named stanny bouchard
he told me about it
the wendigo
you heard a lot about that
all over the north country
back in the old days
it was a myth
passed down from the local
tribes up this way
but to them it wasnt
just some campfire story
they believed it
they feared it
saw these
on the trees up there
yeah theyre warnings
the local tribes carved them
before they fled
fled
yeah they knew
the power of that place
they felt its pull
they came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else
that the ground was bad
sour
the ground is sour
yeah
so they moved on
but not before they built that deadfall
they built it
to keep people out
but it didnt keep people out
the wendigo
may just be
some crazy folktale
but there is
something up there
something
that brings things back
so what happened
to your dog jud
he came back
just like stanny b said he would
but he was changed
it was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down
for the second time
i thought it would be
different with ellies cat
i mean biff had a mean
streak to begin with
but church well
was a nice cat
he tried to hurt gage
im so sorry louis i am
once you feel the power
of that place
you make up the sweetestsmelling
reasons to go back
but i was wrong
sometimes dead is better

gonna go to sleep
