we have someone already 
bloody nose  room 4

sort of procession 
what s a procession 
it s like a parade 
but not for fun 
hey  let s go back inside
and watch a show 
i m tired of unpacking boxes 
sooner than that 
i mean  ellie s birthday is
coming up in a few months 
well  i don t know why you re worried  mom

you know 
hey  mom  can i  uh   
can i talk to you later 
okay  love you  bye 
hey  ellie  are you hungry 
hey  you get down from there 
the trick is   
to get the stinger out
real quick 
oh  she s a big  un 
no prize winner   
but she ll do for a ribbon 
there you go 
yeah 
should be starting
to quiet down now 
you re the doctor s
little girl 
eleanor creed 
but you can call me ellie 
i m judson crandall 
you can call me jud 
all right  up you get 
  what is this place 
  pet cemetery 
  didn t you read the sign 
  yeah  they spelled it wrong 
these are all people s pets 
well  the whole town s been
using this place for generations 
i saw those kids 
they were all
wearing those masks 
yeah 
a lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it 
see this one over here 
i carved this myself 
that s my dog  biffer 
and it s true 
he was a hell of a sniffer 
ellie 
you know better than to wander
off by yourself  come here 
mommy  this is jud 
our neighbor 
i got stung by a bee 
he pulled the stinger out 
it was a big  un 
hmm  nice to meet you  ma am 
nice to meet you  too 
i m rachel  ellie s mom 
you know  these woods   
it s not really all that safe
to go roaming around in  em 
people can get lost up here 
thank you  jud 
um  we should get back  okay 
honey  you can t
wander off like that 
i don t know where you are 
i can t do anything   
just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting 
jud   
come back   
  dad 
  yeah 
why don t pets
live as long as people 
well   
do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism 
  the clock in your body 
  yes 
humans have
a slow metabolism 
a slow clock 
so we live longer 
whereas cats and dogs   
well  they have
a fast metabolism 
which means 
when it runs out   
they die and go
to the pet cemetery 
yeah 
ellie discovered
a charming little landmark
in the woods today 
right in our backyard 
okay  well  that doesn t have to
be such a bad thing  does it  hmm 
a place to bury our pets
and remember them 
it might seem scary  but it s not 
it s perfectly natural 
just like dying
is natural  hmm 
we all die and eventually 
one way or another 
we all go back
into the ground 
what daddy s
trying to say
is that even though the pet s
body goes in the ground 
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven 
just like nana creed 
remember how i told you
she s looking down on you 
well  we don t
actually know
that it works
exactly like that 
what mommy and daddy
are trying to say
is that you don t have to worry about
this  sweetheart  okay 
church and mommy and me 
we re gonna be around a long  long time 
and gage 
of course  sweetie 
gage is just a kid 
but what about
your sister  mommy 
wasn t she just a kid
when she died 
rachel   
rachel 
you okay 
what was that in there 
funny  i wanted to ask you
the same thing 
rachel  ellie s
almost nine years old 
we should be able
to talk to her about this 
ellie s a child 
and death for her is scary 
please  rachel  doesn t mean
we should shield her from it 
and you think
that s what i m doing 
i think that all this talk
about the afterlife 
about people
looking down on her 
i think   
yeah  i think it s delaying
getting to the heart
of the matter  yes 
so  you    you really don t
think there s anything
after we die 
no heaven  no nothing 
no 
right  we re gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep 
it could be allergies 
but we just want to be sure 
marcella  please tell me
it s almost lunch 
if i have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils 
  i swear to god   
  judy went out for sandwiches 
his head

i watched them
wheel her body out 
but i swear
she was still in the walls 
and at night 
i could hear her moving 
calling out my name 
rachel 
i didn t know who to call 
but if i had just gone up to the
room and given her her food   
your parents should never have
left you alone with her  never

there are places in this world
that are older
than either of us 
places that a rational
doctor brain like yours
will never understand 
nobody knows

what happens
in that stony ground 
but the soil of a man s heart

i think it s a mistake
that we moved here 
it doesn t feel right  louis 
you remember why we moved here
in the first place 
no  i know 
i mean  look  we have
ellie s birthday coming up 
why don t we do something
special  hey 
we could throw a party 
we could invite some of our
friends from boston up  all right 
invite your parents  even 
  okay 
  mmm 
we can turn this around 
we can 
we can turn this around 
ooh 
these are looking good  el 
el  what is this 
i don t know 
gage drew that 
gage 
come on  daddy s got you 
daddy s got you 
i was 11
when i lost biff 
he d run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected 
daddy had to put him down
out of mercy 
  your dad took you up there 
  no  no 
it was an old fella
named stanny bouchard 
he told me about it 
the wendigo 
you heard a lot about that
all over the north country
back in the old days 
it was a myth
passed down from the local
tribes up this way 
but to them  it wasn t
just some campfire story 
they believed it 
they feared it 
saw these
on the trees up there 
yeah  they re warnings 
the local tribes carved them
before they fled 
fled 
yeah  they knew
the power of that place 
they felt its pull 
they came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else 
that the ground was bad 
sour 
the ground is sour 
yeah 
so  they moved on 
but not before they built that deadfall 
they built it
to keep people out 
but it didn t keep people out 
the wendigo
may just be
some crazy folktale 
but there is
something up there 
something
that brings things back 
so  what happened
to your dog  jud 
he came back 
just like stanny b  said he would 
but he was changed 
it was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down 
for the second time 
i thought it would be
different with ellie s cat 
i mean  biff had a mean
streak to begin with 
but church  well   
  was a nice cat   
  he tried to hurt gage 
i m so sorry  louis  i am 
once you feel the power
of that place 
you make up the sweetest smelling
reasons to go back 
but i was wrong 
sometimes dead is better 
come on  hold still 
hold still  you re just
gonna go to sleep 
damn it  church  come on  just   
god damn it 
come on
