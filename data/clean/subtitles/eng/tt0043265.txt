griggs  briggs  that was it 
alfred briggs  soap flakes  i think

thanks for the tea 
take care of yourselves 
goodbye  thank you

wretched man  he s a canadian

the good shepherd doesn t desert
his flock when wolves are prowling 
we must ask the almighty
to bless england
and carry her
through her hour of trial 
rose  go in the house and stay there 
what s the meaning of this 
how dare you 
ooh 
samuel  samuel

rose

cold  foggy 
where s rose 
  rose  are you down in the shop 
  i m here 
bring me a nice  hot cup of tea 
i m here  brother  beside you 
i try so hard  you know  to study   
hebrew  greek   
i ve got no facility 
if i don t pass the examinations 
i shall volunteer as a missionary 
rose  too 
not comely among the maidens 
but she  too  can be a servant
in the house of the lord 
even for such as she 
god has a goodly purpose 
i m putting my books away 
i m not working any more 
if i don t pass  it ll just mean
that god has other work for me 
thy will be done 
oh  no  lord  if it be thy will 
let me distinguish myself 
give me a call   
here  in england  at home 
mother would be so proud 
oh  lord  i have tried so hard 
so  they ve been here  too  eh 
after i left the other day 
the drums started in the forest 
pretty soon my boys was moaning 
i asked  em what the trouble was 
they said the drums said the soldiers
was marching off their people
and burning their villages
so they couldn t come back 
when i got to the mine 
everything was a shambles 
my boys took one look
and bolted into the forest 
the way i look at it  they plan
to make soldiers of the natives
and take over all africa 
  where s the reverend 
  he s in there  he s dead 
oh  oh  well  now  ain t that awful 
if they d shoot a reverend
couldn t do  em a bit of harm 
there ain t nobody safe 
they didn t shoot him  mr allnut 
but they may as well have done 
oh  that s certainly too bad  miss 
that s all i can say 
when d he die  miss 
he died early this morning 
excuse me  miss 
what i mean to say is 
what with the climate  the quicker
we get him buried the better   
if you don t mind
my saying so 
  you got a spade 
  behind the bungalow 
i expect he d like to be buried
in the shade 
while i m digging the grave 
you get your things together 
we can clear out in a hurry 
the germans might come back anytime 
why should they 
they ll be back 
looking for the african queen 
they d give a lot to get their hands
on her and what s in her
blasting gelatine 
cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen 
heaps of things
them germans could use 
the germans 
i figure we can go somewheres
behind an island
and talk about what to do 
  i ll get ready 
fine  i ll be as quick as i can 
let s go  miss 
let s go while the going s good 
pardon me 
mind taking the tiller  miss 
  huh 
  come on 
  but i can t steer 
  come on 
a little to starboard  miss 
no  no  the other way 
ah  so far so good 
here we are safe and sound 
  the question is  what next 
  quite 
we got heaps of grub 
we re all right 
2000 cigarettes  two cases of gin 
we could stay here for months
if we wanted to 
not a bad place to sit out a war 
all the comforts of home 
including running water 
we simply can t remain in this
backwater until the war is over 
can t we  miss  you got the map 
show me a way out  i ll take it 
the british will attack 
which way will they come 
maybe from the sea  but that would
put the germans between us 
mightn t our soldiers come in
from british east 
but the war would be over before they
hacked through that forest 
we re in a bit of a fix  miss 
one thing s sure 
they won t come up from the congo 
they can t cross that lake
while the luisa s there 
  the luisa 
  a 100 ton steamer 
the germans brought her in sections 
she s the boss of the lake
cos she s got a six pounder 
  what s that 
  the biggest gun in central africa 
  i see 
  without the luisa  it d be easy 
the germans wouldn t last a month
if our men could get across the lake 
all that don t get us
any closer to home 
this river  the ulanga 
runs into the lake  doesn t it 
well  yes  miss  it does 
but if you got ideas about going
in this launch  get rid of  em 
why 
well  first off  there s shona 
the germans have a fort there 
if we tried to pass their guns 
they d blow us up 
then there s the rapids 
100 miles of water
like it was coming from a fire hose 
then the river s called the bora 
they didn t know it was the same
river until this spengler   
  he got down it  i remember 
  yes  in a dug out canoe 
with six swahili paddlers 
that was his map you was looking at 
mr allnut  what s in these boxes
with the red lines on them 
oh  them 
well  that s blasting gelatine  miss 
  is it dangerous 
  no  miss  that s safety stuff 
you can get it wet
and it don t do it any harm 
you can hit it with a hammer 
and it won t go off 
takes a detonator to set it off 
  i ll put it over the side for you 
  no  we may want it 
what are these long  round 
torpedo like things 
oh  them  them s oxygen
and hydrogen cylinders  miss 
  mr allnut   
  i m still right here 
there ain t any other place
i could be on a 30 foot boat 
you re a machinist  aren t you 
wasn t that your job at the mine 
yes  a kind of jack of all trades 
master of none  like they say 
  could you make a torpedo 
  how s that  miss 
could you make a torpedo 
a torpedo 
ask me to make a dreadnought
and do it up right 
a torpedo 
you don t know what you re asking 
there ain t nothing so complicated
as the insides of a torpedo 
it s got gyroscopes 
compressed air chambers   
but all those things 
they re only to make it go  right 
yeah  yeah  go
and hit what it s aimed at 
well  we ve got the african queen 
uh  how s that  miss 
if we were to fill those cylinders
with that blasting gelatine
and fix them out over the boat 
then run the boat against a ship 
they d go off just like a torpedo 
wouldn t they 
yeah  if they had detonators
in the end 
we could get a good head of steam up 
and just before she hits 
we could dive off  couldn t we 
why  sure  miss  sure  absolutely 
there s one thing wrong
with your idea 
there ain t nothing to torpedo 
oh  yes  there is 
  is what 
  something to torpedo 
  what s that 
  the luisa 
the luisa  
oh  now  don t talk silly 
you can t do that  honest 
we can t get down the ulanga 
spengler did 
if a german did it  we can  too 
you never tried it 
i never tried shooting myself
in the head neither 
trouble is 
you don t know anything about boats 
in other words  you refuse
to help your country
  in her hour of need  mr allnut 
  huh 
well  i wouldn t put it that way 
just how would you put it  mr allnut 
all right  have it your way 
but don t blame me for what happens 
very well  let s get started 
  what  now  miss 
  yes  now 
there ain t two hours of daylight 
we can go a long way
in two hours 
uh  i ll have to get the old kettle
to boiling and   
well  do so  mr allnut 
 could you make a torpedo  
 well  do so  mr allnut  
a little to starboard  miss 
that s right 
hey  you re doing fine  miss 
it s really quite easy 
isn t it  mr allnut 
ah  you got to learn
to read the river 
read the river 
yeah  you see that long thing
over there 
looks kind of like a  v  
that means a snag 
  oh 
  this choppy water over here 
that means shallow 
the queen don t draw much water 
so we can go right over  em 
most boats would get
their bottoms tore up 
and when it s smooth and flat
like that over there 
does that mean a rock  mr allnut 
rocks or hippo  miss 
but don t go
bumping into no hippo 
makes them awful mad 
this boat s only big enough
for the two of us 
what was the matter  mr allnut 
steam pump s full of scum and rust 
she gets clogged up 
kicking her starts her
working again  i gotta act fast 
one of my boys dropped a screwdriver
down the safety valve 
what would happen
if you didn t kick her 
whole boiler d blow up 
but if we re going downstream 
why do we need the engine at all 
boat s gotta go fast
or you can t steer 
if i let the engine die going
down the rapids  we d be goners 
  mr allnut 
  yes  miss 
why not dismantle the safety valve
and remove the screwdriver 
i m gonna do that one of these days 
i ain t done it cos i kind of like
kicking it  she s all i ve got 
ahh   it s kind of hot work 
ain t it  miss 
i could do with a drink  excuse me 
oh 
you gonna have one  miss 
no 
  what is it 
  gin  miss 
  something the matter  miss 
  no 
how d you like a nice cup of tea 
i d like a cup of tea 
it ll taste a little rusty 
but we can t have everything  can we 
there you are 
get this out of the way 
  sugar  miss 
  thank you 
don t mention it 
  a bit of supper  miss 
  it s too hot to eat 
  how long you been out here  miss 
  about 10 years 
  what part of england are you from 
  the midlands 
  sounds pretty  anyway 
  yes  it is  it s very pretty 
ever get homesick 
it s sunday afternoons i think of
most  the peace and the quiet 
yeah  on sunday afternoons 
i was always sleepin  one off 
  this is very  very good 
  yes  it isn t half bad  is it 
what brought you to africa 
mr allnut 
the zambezi bridge  a whole boatload
of us canucks came to work on it 
don t know why they wanted it 
both sides of the river the same 
but why does a chicken
cross the road 
  i beg your pardon 
  nothing  miss 
ah  sometimes i wish i was back
rubbing elbows  as they say 
there s nothing like the noise of a
saturday night to cheer a fellow up 
the rest of the week 
i d be taking orders from somebody 
out here i m my own boss 
anyway  i was until   
hey  you didn t see any crocodiles 
did you  miss 
crocodiles  no 
there s no shallows for  em 
the current s too swift 
i could do with a bath
before i turn in 
i d like a bath myself 
well  i ll go in the bow and
hang off the anchor chain 
you stay back in the stern
and do whatever you have to 
as long as we don t look 
it won t matter 
well  how about it  miss 
very well  mr allnut 
that s the ticket 
  mr allnut 
  right here 
i can t get back into the boat 
i ll give you a hand 
close your eyes  mr allnut 
all right 
i m all right  thank you 
mr allnut 
i m sorry i woke you  miss 
what are you doing 
i    i ain t doing nothing  miss 
well  get out  this instant 
mr allnut 
mr allnut 
you may come in out of the rain 
thank you  miss 
  oh  miss 
  yes  mr allnut 
i m sorry i gave you such a turn 
that s quite all right  mr allnut 
  good night  miss 
  good night  mr allnut 
  what a frightfully strong smell 
  what smell 
the river 
smells like marigolds  stale ones 
does  huh 
not a very good smell for a flower 
they re very pretty 
though  marigolds 
they are  huh 
  mr allnut 
  yes  miss 
the current s quite strong
here  isn t it 
yes  we re getting near the rapids 
really  so soon 
just around that bend 
kind of dangerous 
better let me take over 
here you are  miss 
  well  miss 
  yes  mr allnut 
  how d you like it 
  like it 
  white water rapids 
  i never dreamed 
i don t blame you for being scared 
not one bit 
ain t nobody
ain t scared of white water 
i never dreamed a mere physical
experience could be so stimulating 
how s that 
i ve only known such excitement
a few times before 
in my brother s sermons
when the spirit was really upon him 
  you want to go on 
  naturally 
  miss  you re crazy 
  pardon 
what if we d come against them rocks 
but we didn t 
i must say i m filled with admiration
for your skill  mr allnut 
do you suppose  after i ve practised 
that someday i might try 
miss  them rapids ain t nothing
to what s in front of us 
i wouldn t call them rapids at all 
  i can hardly wait 
  but  miss 
now that i ve had a taste of it 
i don t wonder you love boating 
mr allnut 
is something the matter 
mr allnut  tell me 
nothing you d understand 
i simply can t imagine 
it s been such a pleasant day 
what is it 
yes  mr allnut 
all this foolish talk about
the luisa  going down the river 
  what do you mean 
  we ain t doing nothing of the sort 
sure we are 
what an absurd idea 
 what an absurd idea  what an absurd idea  
lady  you ve got 10
absurd ideas for my one  ha 
just why don t you want to go on 
mr allnut 
  the river at shona 
  shona 
you re darn right  shona 
all it takes is one bullet
in the blasting gelatine
and we re in bits and pieces 
  then we ll go by night 
  oh  no  we won t 
then it s the rapids 
nobody in their might rind
would tackle the rapids at night 
then we ll go in daylight
on the far side from shona
as fast as ever we can 
  oh  no  we won t 
  you agreed to go 
i never did 
i never agreed to nothing 
you are a liar  mr allnut 
and what is worse  you are a coward 
woo  coward yourself 
you ain t no lady  no  miss 
that s what my poor old mother
would say to you 
if my poor old mother
were to hear you 
whose boat is this  anyway 
i asked you onboard
cos i was sorry for you
on account of you
losing your brother 
that s what you get
for feeling sorry for people 
i ain t sorry no more  you crazy 
psalm singing  skinny old maid 
  there was a bold fisherman
  set sail from off pimlico
  and when he got off pimlico
  the winds did begin to blow
  and the little boat
wibble wobbled so
  then overboard went he
  singing twinky deedle dum
  twinky deedle dee
  was the highly interesting song
that he sung
  twinky deedle dum
  twinky deedle dee     
oh 
oh  miss  oh  have pity  miss 
oh  you don t know
what you re doing  miss 
i ll perish without
a hair of the dog 
oh  miss 
it ain t your property 
ooh  oh   
oh  what a head 
  there was a bold fisherman
  set sail from off pimlico
  to catch the bold piggy
  and the gay macaroo
  but when he left pimlico 
the winds     
ah  it s great to have a
lady aboard with clean habits 
sets the man a good example 
a man alone 
he gets to living like a hog 
then  too  with me 
it s always put things off 
never do today
what you can put off till tomorrow 
but with you 
business before pleasure every time 
do all your laundry 
make yourself spick and span 
get all the mending out of the way 
and then  and only then 
sit down for a nice quiet hour
with the good book 
i tell you  it s a model 
like an inspiration 
i ain t had this engine
so clean in years  inside and out 
just look at her  miss 
see how she sparkles 
myself  too 
guess you never saw me
without whiskers and cleaned up 
i ll bet you wouldn t recognise me 
that much of a change 
dressed up  too 
if i only had some
clean clothes like you 
now  you   
why  you could be at high tea 
say  that s an idea  miss 
how s about a nice little cup of tea 
don t you stir 
i ll be glad to make it for you 
uh    how s the book  miss 
not that i ain t read it 
my mum used to

a little spiritual comfort myself 
and you call yourself a christian 
do you hear me  don t you  don t you 
huh  huh 
what you being so mean for  miss 
man takes a drop too much once in a
while  it s   only human nature

i just ain t used to it 
so  you think it was your
nasty drunkenness i minded 
well  what else 
you promised you d go down the river 
miss  listen to me   
and try to understand 
there s death a dozen times over
down the river 
i m sorry  but blame the ulanga

all right  miss  you win 
as the crocodiles
will be glad to hear

oh  no  get up steam 
breakfast can wait 
waiting for their supper  miss

gave myself up for dead
back where we started 
mr allnut 
better get down  miss 
  what 
  fire 
come here  fire on the ship 
get down lower  miss 
nothing to do
but let her drift  miss 
are we going to be all right 
mr allnut 
oh  yes  everything s all right 
if we can keep up steam and the
boiler don t bust and that mend holds
and we don t pile up on them rocks 
oh 
we made it  we made it 
hip  hip  hooray 
we sure put one over on them 
how curious to be shot at 
  they didn t shoot till we passed 
  one isn t afraid at all 
they didn t believe we d
go down the gorge 
  the bullets sound like mosquitoes 
  cos who could 
i felt like clapping at them 
well  we showed  em 
hip  hip  hooray 
was my handling
of the boat all right 
well  yes  miss 
it was better than all right 
miss 
well  we re   
we re running short of fuel 
we d better put in someplace 
well  i    better do some pumping 
we ll be swimming pretty soon 
  oh  let me do that 
  oh  no  miss 
no  please let me 
while you get fuel 
easy does it  miss 
don t wear yourself out 
picked up a thorn in my foot 
  it s gone right through the sole 
  let me 
oh  thank you  miss 
do you   recognise these flowers 
mr allnut 
huh 
i ve never seen them before 
well  i can t say as i have  either 
perhaps no one has 
i don t suppose
they even have a name 
whether they have
or not  they    sure are pretty 
mr allnut 
dear 
well    well  now 
this is more like it   
breakfast in bed 
two spoonfuls of sugar is right 
isn t it 
fancy you building a fire and all
while i slept 
dear  what is your first name 
  charlie 
  charlie 
that s a nice name 
charlie  charlie 
give us a kiss 
charlie  charlie 
the more i look at this place 
the prettier it gets 
i expect it s just about
the prettiest place i ve ever been to 
not that i ain t all for
going on down the river 
the sooner we blow up the luisa 
the better 
what i meant was   
i d like to come back here someday 
  then you think we can do it 
  of course we can 
nothing a man can t do
if he believes in himself 
never say die  that s my motto 
i ve had misgivings 
as beginning to think the whole thing was a mista
how s that  miss  i mean  rosie 
i had a moment of weakness 
if you re weak  a day or two here
won t make any difference 
oh  no  we ll go on 
thank heaven for your strength 
charlie 
oh  no 
hey  rosie  listen 
we nearly done it that time 
  how much damage have we done 
  let s get the water out and see 
yeah  better than
we could have hoped for 
skin s tight  no water coming in 
what was that clattering
before we stopped 
that s what we gotta find out 
how are you going to do that  dear 
i gotta go down underneath
and take a look 
i hope there s no fancy currents
down there 
well  here goes 
  could you see anything  dear 
  yeah 
shaft s twisted like a corkscrew 
and there s a blade off the prop 
we ll have to mend it  then 
mend it  ha  fat chance 
oh  why is that  dear  what should
we have to do before we can go on 
i ll tell you what we could do
if we was back in lubumbashi 
we could pull this old tub out 
haul the shaft to the workshop
and forge it straight again 
we could write the makers
for a new prop 
they might even have one 
as this boat s only 30 years old 
while we wait  we could
clean  er bottom  paint  er up 
then we put the new shaft in
and the new prop and go on our way 
but this ain t lubumbashi 
couldn t you straighten the shaft
without taking the boat up on shore 
uh   i don t know  i might 
means working under water 
could be done  maybe 
if you could get the shaft
up on shore  could you straighten it 
i ain t got no anvil 
hearth  coal  i ain t got nothin  
i saw a masai native working once
using charcoal on a big hollow stone 
he had a boy to fan the charcoal 
yeah  i ve seen that 
i d use a bellows myself   
make one easy enough 
well  if you think that
would be better 
there s lots and lots of firewood
on the bank 
why don t you try it 
no  no  no 
it ain t no use  rosie 
i was forgetting the prop   
blade s gone 
can t we use the blades
that are left 
the prop would be off balance 
the shaft would be twisted up again 
we ll have to make a new blade 
there s lots of iron
and stuff that you could use 
yeah  tie it on 
well  if you think
that would do  but   
wouldn t it be better to weld it on 
isn t that the right word  dear 
weld it on 
you re a one  rosie  really  you are 
but isn t  weld  the right word 
you know what i mean
even if it isn t 
i swallowed half the river that time 
you were down there
an awfully long time 
the shaft don t want to come 
it s stuck 
  charlie 
  huh 
  let me help you 
  what are you going to do 
  i m going down there 
  rosie  the currents are fierce 
i don t want a drowneded woman
on my hands 
what will you be thinking of next 
well    here goes 
if my dad had put me to blacksmithing
when i was a kid 
i don t think i should have ever
come to africa 
i might have   
but then i wouldn t have met you 
rosie  old girl 
charlie 
well  there 
that s about as good
as i could get it 
didn t take so long  neither 
blade ll be different 
i gotta make that 
it turns right enough 
but that don t mean nothing 
question is  will she stand up
under a full head of steam 
well  we ll get the answer
out there 
the lord help us
if it ain t the right one 
looks like this old river got tired
of all the running and jumping
and decided to rest for a while 
this must be where the river changes
her name from ulanga to bora 
ah  pinch me  rosie 
here we are  going down the river
like antony and cleopatra
on their barge 
if it hadn t been for you 
this couldn t be 
  aren t you proud of yourself 
  certainly not 
you kept the engine going 
you mended the propeller 
it wasn t me at all 
there s not another man alive
who could ve done it 
right you are 
cos no other man alive s got you 
i ll never forget
how you looked going over the falls 
head up  chin out 
hair blowing in the wind 
the living picture of a heroine 
fancy me a heroine 
oh  charlie 
you ve lost your mind 
lost my heart  too 
should we drop the anchor 
sweetheart 
the river needs to rest for a while 
i suppose we do  too 
rosie  soon we re gonna wish
we was back shooting the rapids 
  ooh 
  oh 
ooh  this is awful 
we gotta get out of here 
we got no steam 
  i m going under the water 
  that s it 
  no 
  but i m being eaten alive 
about what you said  look at that 
oh  get me out of here 
i can t stand it  oh  ahh 
ahh  charlie  charlie  charlie 
charlie  charlie 
ohh  charlie 
oh  oh   
charlie 
hurry  hurry  hurry 
we got away from them 
you can come out now 
i m ashamed of myself  charlie 
acting this way 
but i   i couldn t help it 
i was going mad 
oh  you are so bitten 
the bites themselves ain t so bad 
it s having  em around you 
i ve heard of them
driving buffalo stark  staring mad
so they just run and run
until they fall down dead 
will it be that way
wherever we tie up 
  probably 
  what are we going to do  charlie 
well  if the river keeps straight 
deep and slow  not much can hurt us 
i ll let the anchor out 
that ll keep us out of trouble 
how much further do you suppose it is
to the lake  charlie 
not so many miles as the crow flies 
no telling how many days 
all depends on how much
winding around this old river does 
ah   what a time we ve had  rosie 
what a time 
we ll never lack for stories
to tell our grandchildren  will we 
nothing but grass and papyrus
as far as you can see 
  which is the main channel 
  don t look like there is one 
  what are we going to do  charlie 
  i don t know 
we can t just go round and round
here forever 
can t just go round and round 
we get in and the grass
closes in back of the stern 
there s no going back  rosie 
anything happens  we just sit there
till we go off our heads with fever 
  i know it 
  all right 
you pays your money
and you takes your choice 
that way 
pull her over 
we ve come along by steam 
we ve paddled and pushed
and pulled this old boat
along with a hook 
what we ain t done up to now
is get out and carry her 
looks like that ll come next 
it s hard to breathe 
the air is so heavy 
can t tell it from the water 
or the water from the land 
for that matter 
all the channels we ve lost 
all the twisting and turning
we ve done 
we may come out where we started 
if we come out at all 
we ve always followed the current 
that don t mean
nothing to this river 
this river s crazy   
crazy as i am 
charlie  charlie 
sorry  old girl 
well   
only thing to put the roses
back in our cheeks
is to get out of these reeds 
what i said about having to get out
and carry this old boat
was meant to be a joke 
don t look like a joke now  well   
ahh 
ooh 
ooh 
ooh  the little beggars 
ooh  ooh  pull them off me 
no  if the heads stay in 
they ll poison your blood 
salt  salt  salt 
e the legs 
eww 
oh  if there s anything in the world
i hate  it s leeches 
the filthy little devils 
there  there  dear  there 
fine specimen of a man
i am  ain t i 
you re the bravest man
that ever lived 
you just overdo  that s all 
what you need is a few hours sleep 
there 
now  are you all comfortable 
go to sleep  dear 
and when you wake up 
we ll be on our way again 
  rosie   
  yes  charlie 
you want the truth  don t you 
even if we had all our strength 
we ll never get her off this mud 
  we re finished 
  i know it 
but  rosie   
i m not one bit sorry i came 
what i mean is   
it was worth it 
dear lord   
we ve come to the end of our journey 
in a little while 
we will stand before you 
i pray for you to be merciful 
judge us not
for our weakness but for our love 
and open the doors of heaven
for charlie and me 
rosie 
rosie 
rosie  rosie  dear 
look  we re on the lake 
the rain did it   
just lifted the old queen up
and carried her over the mud 
we couldn t have been a 100 yards
from it last night 
look  rosie 
let s build a fire
and get the engine started
and get into the middle
where we can breathe 
sure  sure 
we ll be out of here in a jiffy 
this air   
  isn t it wonderful 
  yeah 
it s like    you don t approve 
but it s like a shot of gin 
makes your blood race 
your face numb and your spirits soar 
i m sorry i poured that gin out 
charlie 
aw  forget it  rosie 
to show there s no hard feelings 
i ll make you another cup of tea 
you carry on more over a cup of tea
than i do over a glass of gin 
is it 
it s the luisa
and she s coming right at us 
she must be doing 12 knots 
we ve gotta make a run for it
back to the reeds 
she s coming right toward us 
i thought for a minute
they d seen us 
they re going toward that island 
probably anchor there tonight
and leave in the morning 
don t worry  they ll be back again 
you know how the germans are 
they lays down systems
and sticks to them 
mondays they re one place 
tuesday someplace else
and wednesday they ll be back here 
how long will it take
to get the torpedoes ready 
i don t know 
it depends on the detonators 
gotta devise something 
i know what you re thinking  rosie 
you re thinking of
taking the queen out at night
when the luisa comes back  ain t you 
well  we ought to manage it 
there  that ought to work 
when we ram her  these nails will
shoot the bullets into the gelatine 
charlie  you re wonderful 
can t put them in the cylinders yet 
we ll do that when
we re ready to start 
it ll be dark by then 
can you do it in the dark 
it s a case of have to 
you re sure they ll come back
with the luisa 
mm hmm  dead sure 
the lake s 100 miles long 
50 miles wide 
luisa does about   
uh  about 12 knots 
that s 120 miles a day  yup 
she ll be back here tomorrow 
when she comes 
we ll be ready for her 
charlie  let s make the queen
as clean as we can 
scrub her decks and polish her brass 
sure  she ought to look her best
representing the royal navy 
  you know  rosie  i been thinking 
  yes  charlie 
there ain t no use in
us both going to do it 
  now i see it s a one man job 
  you couldn t be more right  dear 
so when the time comes  i ll put you
off on the east shore 
you ll wait while i attend
to the luisa 
  you re the one to be put ashore 
  me 
this was my idea 
i m the one to carry it out 
why  rosie  i m surprised 
you re a sensible woman 
we won t have any more talk
like that 
i can manage this boat
as well as you  and you know it 
rosie  you re cracked 
didn t i steer going down the rapids 
but you don t know about the engine 
suppose she broke down on you 
me  i d walk back and do
a thing or two to that engine   
spit on her  kick her 
and she d go right to work 
  oh  she knows who s boss 
  i suppose you re right 
well  now  that s all settled 
i ll dive off just before the crash 
swim to shore 
and we ll be off to kenya 
i meant it may be necessary
for you to come along 
didn t we just agree
this was a one man job 
but you convinced me
that it isn t  so it s settled 
  we ll go together 
  oh  no we won t 
you ll wait for me
on the east shore 
who do you think you are 
ordering me about 
i m the captain  and you ain t going 
you d only be in my way 
i suppose i was in your way
going down the rapids 
then what you said
back there was a lie 
about how you couldn t
have done it alone
and how you d
lost your heart and    everything 
you liar 
oh  charlie 
we re having our first quarrel 
oh  rosie  it s only that
i just can t bear the thought of   
what i mean is 
suppose something should happen   
  not that anything will  but   
  don t you understand  charlie 
i wouldn t want to go on to kenya
without you 
oh  rosie  all right 
it ll be you at the tiller
and me at the engine 
just like it was from the start 
and there s the luisa  right on time 
blowing up a bit 
better get started  all right 
charlie  charlie  i can t steer 
it s hard to steer 
too much water in the bow 
moves out of the water
half the time 
gotta get her nose up
or it s trouble

  how very interesting 
you don t believe me  do you 
charlie  tell them how
you made the torpedoes 
well  well  i   
see  i took the heads off
two cylinders of oxygen 
and filled them with live explosive 
that was easy enough 
the detonators took some doing 
you know what i used  cartridges
and nails and blocks of soft wood 
then i put the two cylinders
in the bows of the african queen 
near the water line 
when we rammed you  poof 
where is the african queen 
she sank in the storm 
how did you get onto the lake 
we came down the ulanga 
the bora  you call it here 
  that s impossible 
  nevertheless 
but the river s unnavigable 
that may be 
we came down it  though 
didn t we  and in the african queen 
would you hang us together  please
