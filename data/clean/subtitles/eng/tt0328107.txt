  that s right 
she got a sister 
how s business 
the japanese are here in a big way 
cheap labour  factory space  but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in ei paso 
i ferry them back and forth 
they think i m john wayne 
  i live like a king down here 
  yes  you do 
  you been workin  
  yeah  no 
no  i ve been movin  around  you know 
colombia  a couple of places i can t name 
nothin  catches my fancy 
you think god ll forgive us
for what we ve done 
  no 
  you don t 
me either 
  how long you stayin  
  i don t know  i just    you know 
i wanted to see you  ray 
see how you re doin  
i just came by on impulse 
i could do with some impulse 
what happened 
family paid the ransom  then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days 
minus an ear  of course 
now every mother in mexico city
with money wants bigger bodyguards 
  my own wife included 
  i hate to break it to you  but she s right 
she s right 
look  sammy  all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance 
i have a policy 
aig  my dad gave it to me 
yeah  i know  i got it for your dad 
but what ll you do in 60 days when you can t
renew it because you have no bodyguard 
i know  i had to let emilio go 
well  you gotta please lisa 
i mean  ass like that s hard to find 
look 
a bodyguard s like anything else 
you get what you pay for  ok 
you could do this 
get one that s got a decent résumé 
we re not lookin  for goddamn superman 
right  get someone cheap 
so you renew the policy  and then
fire the prick for whatever   incompetence 
all kidding aside  the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school 
and that your wife gets to save face 
this way you won t be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood 
that s right  a bodyguard 
your spanish is good enough 
  you re crazy 
  you even look the part 
in my state  i couldn t guard a corpse 
it s rich guys flashing their cash 
it s all for show  nothing s gonna happen 
yeah  you think they d
hire a drunk  a has been 
you have to keep it under control 
what ifthere was  you know    just  say 
a kidnapping attempt  what do i do then 
you do your best  they re not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles 
it s not exactly a scam  crease 
even at half speed  you re pretty damn good 
yeah  a bodyguard s gotta
be close to people  though 
they talk all the time 
you know i m no good at that 
you ll be the silent type 
they re gonna appreciate that 
bodyguard  so who s the guy 
samuel ramos  he s a young guy 
  he owns one ofthe plants in juàrez 
  yeah 
the jap car industry is in the toilet 
he s trying to persuade ford
to partner with him 
i think he s in trouble 
his family lives in mexico city 
he asked me if i knew anybody he could trust 
  and you thought of me 
  yeah 
take ajob  crease  breathe some air 
then decide ifyou want to stick around 
besides  i m glad to see you  you know 
i got nobody to talk to down here 
listen  my wife wants
someone presentable and polite 
you ll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week 
your résumé s quite impressive 
16 years of military experience 
extensive counter terrorism work 
i m surprised anybody could afford you 
what s the catch 
i drink 
how does that affect you 
coordination  reaction time 
iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter  i ll do the best i can 
but the service will be on a par with the pay 
what if amateurs try it 
i d probably kill  em  is that likely 
no 
no one is to know about your drinking 
that includes my wife 
lisa

the bible says   be not overcome of evil

why not 
because it wasn t a school like yours  pita 
there was no sister anna 
were you unhappy 
being unhappy  that s a state of mind 
i really don t remember 
what happened to your hand 
  it s a birth defect 
  no  it s not 
look  no more questions  ok 
  it really wasn t a question 
  it sounded like a question to me 
no  gracias  gracias  no  no
