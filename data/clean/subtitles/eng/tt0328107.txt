i dont know i just you know
i wanted to see you ray
see how youre doin
i just came by on impulse
i could do with some impulse
what happened
family paid the ransom then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days
minus an ear of course
now every mother in mexico city
with money wants bigger bodyguards
my own wife included
i hate to break it to you but shes right
shes right
look sammy all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance
i have a policy
aig my dad gave it to me
yeah i know i got it for your dad
but whatll you do in 60 days when you cant
renew it because you have no bodyguard
i know i had to let emilio go
well you gotta please lisa
i mean ass like thats hard to find
look
a bodyguards like anything else
you get what you pay for ok
you could do this
get one thats got a decent résumé
were not lookin for goddamn superman
right get someone cheap
so you renew the policy and then
fire the prick for whatever  incompetence
all kidding aside the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school
and that your wife gets to save face
this way you wont be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood
thats right a bodyguard
your spanish is good enough
youre crazy
you even look the part
in my state i couldnt guard a corpse
its rich guys flashing their cash
its all for show nothings gonna happen
yeah you think theyd
hire a drunk a hasbeen
you have to keep it under control
what ifthere was you know just say
a kidnapping attempt what do i do then
you do your best theyre not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles
its not exactly a scam crease
even at half speed youre pretty damn good
yeah a bodyguards gotta
be close to people though
they talk all the time
you know im no good at that
youll be the silent type
theyre gonna appreciate that
bodyguard so whos the guy
samuel ramos hes a young guy
he owns one ofthe plants in juàrez
yeah
the jap car industry is in the toilet
hes trying to persuade ford
to partner with him
i think hes in trouble
his family lives in mexico city
he asked me if i knew anybody he could trust
and you thought of me
yeah
take ajob crease breathe some air
then decide ifyou want to stick around
besides im glad to see you you know
i got nobody to talk to down here
listen my wife wants
someone presentable and polite
youll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week
your résumés quite impressive
16 years of military experience
extensive counterterrorism work

whats the catch
i drink
how does that affect you
coordination reaction time
iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter ill do the best i can
