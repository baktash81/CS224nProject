swing  swing  swing 
  my caesar  you should thank your servant  the people love it 
  yes  they do 
my caesar  any other reward is worse than execution 
you ll be rewarded 
for your valor during the execution of the tsar s order 
for bringing the tsar s bride to the capital 
to award the king s chief groom  ivan 
the peasant s son  with the honorary name of john 
with a tsar s order of chervone gold and
a tsar s caftan with semi precious stones 
and a golden girdle  and a golden saddle 
  oh  my god  vanya  are you 
  i m john now 
it s for you  you got me confused with a circus pony   
a circus pony by any chance  john 
singing  and just recently she was throwing herself into the abyss 
and now you ll find out if she wants to marry
to marry the king or not

stubborn and all in his own way 
not thinking with his head  just his heart 
he s a fool enough as it is  and now he s in love 
he volunteered to find the ring  but where to find it 
where to find it  you ll find out 
where

  i have a recipe from my late grandmother 
tomorrow at noon sharp 
three cauldrons will be placed in the square 
the first with boiling water  the second with ice water 
the third with boiling milk 
  and the tsar will bathe in all three  rejuvenate himself 
  oh  you crafty one  the tsar will not make it to the second cauldron 
what s the tsar got to do with it 
vanya will be the first to jump 
  what if the trick doesn t work  there s boiling water in the boilers after all 
  you won t 
  even for love  so you don t love me 
  my caesar 
it s not my fault i have such acute hearing 
i m sorry  i m about the whole process
of rejuvenation  you have to experience it first 
on your groom  on ivan

and i ve been wondering what s the first thing
to run the wedding first and then
an execution  or first an execution 
and then the wedding  and he s already got it all figured out 
there will be no pulling 
tomorrow to the boilers 
my mare s mother

look  if you put grandma s ring in the first cauldron 
the second a feather of a firebird  and the third a flower of life and death 
  vanya will stay alive

  from my grandmother 
  from my grandmother  so you have the ring 
ivan s feather will be heard from across the sea 
not that from the dungeon  but a flower 
  where to get it 
  at the edge of the world

i m afraid i won t make it till noon 
with wings like yours 
you re faster than the wind

for the king

that is not given to every ruler
