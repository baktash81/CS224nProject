this location has been burglarized
41 times in the last six months 
verizon has scheduled this structure
to be torn down   
   and replaced with a kiosk
as of 8 a m  tomorrow 
hardly two blocks away

the final occupant of that booth

you look out your window 
you see people come in and out of this
phone booth  the same ones every day 
you make up names for them 
you imagine their stories 
but eventually  you get tired
of imagining and follow one of them 
and you hear all of his lies 
and you decide that his sins
should be punished 
some guy shouting into a cell phone full
of self importance isn t gonna notice me 
but i noticed that german porn king 
and i noticed that corrupt executive 
and i noticed you  stu 
  i m flattered 
  operator 553  what is your emergency 
will you please respond 
what was so interesting about a guy
in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th 
the stu show  better than tv 
look  how d i get so lucky to be
picked up by a killer with a rifle  
you had it made 
kelly at home  pam on the side 
i saw pam once  i followed her
to her restaurant  lovely 
life has given you
more than your fair share  stu 
but it appears you don t appreciate it 
look  look  listen 
appearances can be deceiving 
i may look confident  but i m really 
actually just crying out for help 
help  you know 
i m trying to help you  stu 
but you won t help yourself 
  fuck 
  what s the matter  stu 
  you shot me 
  it s time you learn  stu 
  deception can t go unrewarded 
  deception  what fucking deception 
 are you in need of immediate police
or medical response  
shit  you bugged the fucking booth 
that s how you knew 
that s how you knew about pam 
  you picked the wrong person to lie to 
  look  i didn t pick you 
it must have been
your flashy suit that attracted me 
i get fucked on account of my clothes 
that why you killed leon 
i didn t kill leon because
of the way he dressed 
and those other two guys as well 
did they dress too nice 
you must feel really expensive
when you walk out the door 
all right  here come the cops 
what are you gonna do  run 
no  i m not a coward
like some people i know 
  you can get away if you run now 
  you ll blame me for leon 
no  no  i ll confess i shot him
with my fucking phone 
well  then i urge you
to keep one thing in mind  stu 
take a look at your chest  you saw how
accurate i can be  how lethal 
kill me now 
and you give yourself away 
not with a silencer 
it would take these guys   
   the rest of the day to figure out it
wasn t one of their own men that did it 
you can be shot 41 times
for pulling out your wallet 
throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands raised 
  ignore him 
  yeah  what if they open fire 
they won t  look around you  stu 
do you see the tourists
with the video cameras 
the ones hoping the cops
will blow you away   
   so they can sell the tape
to the most gory police shootouts 
don t worry  they ll keep
the police on their best behavior 
so long as you don t take
hostile action  you should be safe 
safe  you call this safe 
i got a whole fucking precinct here
with guns pointed my way 
with both hands raised 
moving slowly  step out of the booth 
if we see any signs of a weapon
we will respond 
you won t because there isn t any 
put down the phone
and raise your hands 
look  i can t 
i m on an important call 
verify this information for me 
the guy in the booth
shot that guy over there   
   and stuck around
to make a phone call 
yeah  that s what the hookers
are saying

thousands of people die every day 
but you put one dead body   
   in the middle of a busy street
and it makes people crazy 
look at these guys 
you can smell the fear 
  ten cops 
  this reminds me of nam 
  vietnam 
  yes  vietnam

you can t imagine the fear  the stench 
napalm charred bodies  children
leaving grenades in your boots 
  then you got blamed for the war 
  i came home and people spit on me 
yeah  this country
owes you an apology 
look  i just had this vision of you 
of a kid  coming back from the war   
   inured to the killing 
not able to get work  isolated 
i think that could be made
into an affecting story   
   and  you know  one
that everyone understands 
and i think cops
are on the side of vets 
you are pathetic  stu 
why don t you wake up 
napalm charred bodies 
i d have to be 50 to be in that war 
stop fucking with my head  please 
i m gonna go talk to him 
shouldn t we wait
on the esu negotiator 
they could take 20 minutes 
i m not gonna take a chance on this one 
i m gonna handle this 
sir  i m taking out my weapon 
putting my weapon down on the car

i don t need to see it 
i know what s there 
i got plenty of witnesses over here
who saw you use it 
they didn t see it
because it didn t happen 
  shut them up 
  he s dead  but it didn t happen 
  then who did it 
  mustn t tell him  stu 
  i don t know 
  you were the closest one to him 
  you must ve saw it happen  help me 
  no 
  this guy is getting on my nerves 
  look  stay the fuck out of this 
who do you keep talking to
on the phone 
  nobody 
  your friend  your parent  your lover 
  who 
  careful  stuart  careful 
my psychiatrist 
  excellent  i should ve thought of that 
  i see  what s this doctor s name 
it would be really helpful to us
if we knew 
he says not to tell you  all right 
it s privileged information 
very good  stuart 
see  now you re having fun 
  yeah  whatever you fucking say 
  i respect your right to privacy 
i ve been through therapy myself 
the department provided it for me 
i know it s not good form for a cop
to be saying that  but sometimes   
   you know  circumstances  stress   
i had issues  i lost my marriage over it 
tell him not to come any closer 
don t come any closer  stop there 
go back a few steps 
  go back to where you were 
  okay  no problem 
  that s right 
  so you got some intimacy issues 
i got those too  all i want to know is 
what happened  man 
  tell him to read you your rights 
  i want you to read me my rights 
stop asking questions 
you have the right to remain silent 
you have the right to an attorney 
if you cannot afford one 
an attorney will be provided for you 
all right  so now  can you at least
give me your first name 
  just your first name 
  don t tell him 
it s my right
not to have any first name 
  no gun  no name 
  that s right 
  you re highly underprivileged 
  demand your lawyer 
and go get my lawyer too  all right 
i want an attorney brought
down here to negotiate my surrender 
  just brilliant  stu 
  i understand that  but   
   it s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer
to come and risk his life 
  once you hand over the gun   
  how can i 
you won t let me put my hand
in my pocket 
we ll take it out for you 
all you have to do   
   is step out with your hands raised 
nothing will happen to you 
  it s not gonna work 
  stu  stu 
  what 
  ask him a question 
ask him if his wife
got tired of sleeping with him 
  i    fuck  i can t do that 
  oh  sure you can  stu 
ask him if he couldn t get it up 
if he couldn t satisfy her 
  are you gonna step out of the booth 
  i can t  no 
  you re not stepping out of the booth 
  ask him 
  is that a no 
  ask him 
  both your lives depend on it 
  sir 
captain  you couldn t satisfy your wife
sexually 
  excuse me 
  ask him if he abuses himself now 
  does he masturbate on lonely nights 
  fuck  for god s sake 
say it 
say it or i will blow him away 
  so do you whack off now 
  hey

  i wanna know who s on that phone 
i want a techie here  i need

my credibility  all right 
what about yours 
look  it s our friends from channels
two and five  your local news  stuart 
you couldn t do this for your clients
if your life depended on it 
but me  i ve made you famous 
stick your head out so they can get
a better angle on you 
  they re here to cover me dying 
  how ungrateful 
those cameras will make the police
very careful 
  so come on  smile a little for them 
  can you tap into that phone call 
  should be no problem 
  except   
   we ll need a warrant
if he s on the line with his shrink 
fuck that  i m not gonna
jeopardize this on a technicality 
look  tracing 
that s not a violation  right 
  as long as we don t listen in 
  okay  this is what i want you to do 
i want you to find who he s talking to
and their current location 
all right  we get that 
i want somebody to find out

ted bundy  john wayne gacy   
   fucking jeffrey dahmer 
name a victim  you can t 
anyway  i don t deserve
to be the center of attention 
  it ought to be you they re covering 
  that attention would embarrass me 
  i know exactly the spin to put on this 
  how terror inspires your creativity 
listen  this could be a media frenzy 
all right  you d get barbara walters   
   i mean  larry king
if you still wanted him 
that approach seems predicated upon
me surrendering without killing you 
listen  we can make you sympathetic 
sit with a writer  bang out a book 
you know  movie of the week 
get america on your side 
all right  you killed leon
because he was gonna kill me 
you killed leon to protect me

cops see me reach for something 
they ll blow me away 
there s only one way to find out 
look  the slugs in that dead guy

to redeem yourself 
come on  humble yourself
in front of your loved ones   
   and millions of strangers and me 
it s do or die time 
what  you couldn t find anyone
worse than me 
not a murderer or a child molester
but a publicist   
   who has fantasies
about pretty little actresses 
who spends money on italian suits
and dry cleaning   
   so people think he s important 
who doesn t waste time being nice   
   to people who are of no use to him 
these are my crimes 
stuart  i know your crimes  tell them 
i ve never done anything for anybody   
   who couldn t do something for me 
i string along   
   a kid with promises
that i ll pay him money 
i keep him around because he
looks up to me 
adam  if you re watching  don t be
a publicist  you re too good for it 
i lie in person and on the phone 
i lie to my friends 
i lie to newspapers and magazines who
sell my lies to more and more people 
i m just a part of a big cycle of lies 
i should be fucking president 
i wear all this italian shit because
underneath  i still feel like the bronx 
i think i need these clothes 
and this watch 
my  2000 watch is a fake 
and so am i 
i neglected the things
i should ve valued most 
i valued this shit 
i take off my wedding ring to call pam 
kelly  that s pam 
  somebody got a 20 on this pam 
  don t blame her 
i never told her if i was married 
and if i did   
   she would ve told me to go home 
kelly  looking at you now 
i m ashamed of myself 
i mean  i work so hard on this image 
on stu shepard  the asshole   
   who refers to himself in third person 
that i only proved i should be alone 
i ve been dressing up as something
i m not for so long   
   l m so afraid you won t like what s
underneath 
but here i am 
i m just flesh and blood and weakness 
i love you so fucking much 
i take off this ring because it only
reminds me of how i ve failed you 
and  i don t wanna give you up 
i wanna make things better 
but it may not be my choice anymore 
you deserve better 
  you re not gonna let me go 
  no

i know a thing or two
about liars as well
