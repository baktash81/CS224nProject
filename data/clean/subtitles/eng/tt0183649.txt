12 million in the
greater metropolitan area
there are almost 10 million
telephone exchange lines
over 50 phone services
3 million new yorkers
are cell phone users
it used to be a mark of insanity
to see people talk to themselves
now its a mark of status and speed dial
is quickly replacing the drop of a coin
despite increased usage
of cellular devices
an estimated 45 million residents
and 2 million visitors
still utilize pay phones
on a regular basis
this is the telephone booth
at 53rd and 8th
perhaps the last vestige of privacy
on manhattans west side
it is the last booth of its type
still in regular operation
up to 300 calls daily originate here
this location has been burglarized
41 times in the last six months
verizon has scheduled this structure
to be torn down
and replaced with a kiosk
as of 8 am tomorrow
hardly two blocks away

the final occupant of that booth

no one youd ever notice
i dont run in your circles
and what is it you do
i watch
you watch
yes well what else is there to do
when life turns on you and youve
retreated into some small room
you look out your window
you see people come in and out of this
phone booth the same ones every day
you make up names for them
you imagine their stories
but eventually you get tired
of imagining and follow one of them
and you hear all of his lies
and you decide that his sins
should be punished
some guy shouting into a cell phone full
of selfimportance isnt gonna notice me
but i noticed that german porn king
and i noticed that corrupt executive
and i noticed you stu
im flattered
operator 553 what is your emergency
will you please respond
what was so interesting about a guy
in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th
the stu show better than tv
look howd i get so lucky to be
picked up by a killer with a rifle
you had it made
kelly at home pam on the side
i saw pam once i followed her
to her restaurant lovely
life has given you
more than your fair share stu
but it appears you dont appreciate it
look look listen
appearances can be deceiving
i may look confident but im really
actually just crying out for help
help you know
im trying to help you stu
but you wont help yourself
fuck
whats the matter stu
you shot me
its time you learn stu
deception cant go unrewarded
deception what fucking deception
are you in need of immediate police
or medical response
shit you bugged the fucking booth
thats how you knew
thats how you knew about pam
you picked the wrong person to lie to
look i didnt pick you
it must have been
your flashy suit that attracted me
i get fucked on account of my clothes
that why you killed leon
i didnt kill leon because
of the way he dressed
and those other two guys as well
did they dress too nice
you must feel really expensive
when you walk out the door
all right here come the cops
what are you gonna do run
no im not a coward
like some people i know
you can get away if you run now
youll blame me for leon
no no ill confess i shot him
with my fucking phone
well then i urge you
to keep one thing in mind stu
take a look at your chest you saw how
accurate i can be how lethal
kill me now
and you give yourself away
not with a silencer
it would take these guys
the rest of the day to figure out it
wasnt one of their own men that did it
you can be shot 41 times
for pulling out your wallet
throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands raised
ignore him
yeah what if they open fire
they wont look around you stu
do you see the tourists
with the video cameras
the ones hoping the cops
will blow you away
so they can sell the tape
to the most gory police shootouts
dont worry theyll keep
the police on their best behavior
so long as you dont take
hostile action you should be safe
safe you call this safe
i got a whole fucking precinct here
with guns pointed my way
with both hands raised
moving slowly step out of the booth
if we see any signs of a weapon
we will respond
you wont because there isnt any
put down the phone
and raise your hands
look i cant
im on an important call
verify this information for me
the guy in the booth
shot that guy over there
and stuck around
to make a phone call
yeah thats what the hookers
are saying
all right give me the horn
sir im ordering you to fully comply
im busy all right come back later
very good stu
step out of the booth
and raise your hands
i am giving you an order

this guy is looking for us
to kill him captain
suicide by a cop
well thats not gonna happen
get that body out of here fast
somebody get the body

thousands of people die every day
but you put one dead body
in the middle of a busy street
and it makes people crazy
look at these guys
you can smell the fear
ten cops
this reminds me of nam
vietnam

i came home and people spit on me
yeah this country
owes you an apology
look i just had this vision of you
of a kid coming back from the war
inured to the killing
not able to get work isolated

into an affecting story
and you know one
that everyone understands
and i think cops
are on the side of vets
you are pathetic stu
why dont you wake up
napalmcharred bodies
id have to be 50 to be in that war

thats right
youre highly underprivileged
demand your lawyer
and go get my lawyer too all right
i want an attorney brought
down here to negotiate my surrender

i understand that but
its gonna be difficult to get a lawyer
to come and risk his life
once you hand over the gun

you wont let me put my hand
in my pocket
well take it out for you
all you have to do
is step out with your hands raised
nothing will happen to you
its not gonna work
stu stu

ted bundy john wayne gacy
fucking jeffrey dahmer
name a victim you cant
anyway i dont deserve
to be the center of attention
it ought to be you theyre covering
that attention would embarrass me
i know exactly the spin to put on this
how terror inspires your creativity
listen this could be a media frenzy
all right youd get barbara walters
i mean larry king
if you still wanted him
that approach seems predicated upon
me surrendering without killing you
listen we can make you sympathetic
sit with a writer bang out a book
you know movie of the week
get america on your side
all right you killed leon
because he was gonna kill me
you killed leon to protect me

we wont know more than now
say he didnt lets assume hes
a human makes mistakes like all of us

that im gonna be standing by
and my men are gonna shoot
some guy
and when we find out whats in his
hand once we turn over his body
and we see what he was
threatening people with
we realize that it was just
a little black bible
