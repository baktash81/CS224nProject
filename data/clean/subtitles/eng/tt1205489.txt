she was a real peach
thanks for coming al
spectacles testicles wallet and watch
look at the old man glaring at ashley
he cant even tone it
down at moms funeral
what do you expect dads still
living in the 50s
he expects his granddaughter to dress a
little more modestly
yeah well your kids wearing
a timberwolves jersey
im sure dad appreciates that
the point i am trying to make is that there
s nothing anyone can do that
wont disappoint the old man
its inevitable
thats why we stopped doing thanksgivings
the deal with the boat motor the
broken bird bath
its always something
what are we going to do with him
dont you think hell get in trouble over
there all by himself in
the old neighborhood
why dont you have him move in with you
death is often a bittersweet
occasion to us catholics
bitter in the pain
sweet in the salvation
bitter in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families
sweet to those who know the salvation that
awaits
and some may ask
what is death
is it the end
or is it the beginning
and what is life
what is this thing we call life
all these questions can frustrate you at
times like this
and thats why you have to turn to the lord
jesus
because the lord is the sweetness
is that dad

what
life and death
life and death what the hell do you know
about life and death
id like to think i know a lot
im a priest
yeah you get up and preach about life and
death
but all what you know is what you learned
in a priest school
right out of the rookie preachers handbook
i dont know about that i think
that is bittersweet
sort of bitter in its pain but
sweet in its salvation
thats what you know of life and death
and thats pathetic
what do you know mr kowalski
i know a lot i lived there almost three
years in korea thanks
we shot men
we stabbed them with bayonets hacked
seventeenyearolds to death with shovels
stuff ill remember till the day i die
horrible things
but things i live with
and what about life
well i
i survived the war
got married and had a family
sounds like you know more about
death than you do living
maybe so father
maybe so
son of a bitch

you can count on that
we used to stack fucks like you five

ok
you better watch your back
thank you
get off my lawn
what the hell is this
no no no no more
stay right there
why cant you people just leave me alone
we brought you some shallots to plant in
the garden
i dont want them theyre perennials they
come back every year
look why are bringing me all this garbage
anyway
because
because you saved tao
i didnt save anybody i just i kept a
bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn
you are a hero to the neighborhood
i am not a hero
too bad they think you are and thats why
theyre keep bringing you the gifts
please take them
all they are wrong
i just want to be left alone thank you
wait
this is my mom vu im sue and
thats  my brother tao
we live next door
so
tao wants to say something
i am sorry
sorry for what
for trying to steal your car
let me tell you something boy
you step on this property again you are
done
good afternoon walt
i  told you im not going to confession
why didnt you just call the police
what
i do work with some of the hmong gangs and i
heard there was some trouble
in the neighborhood
why didnt call the police
well
you know why ive prayed that they would
show up but
nobody answered
what were you thinking
someone could have been killed
were talking life and death here
when things go wrong you gotta act quickly
when we were in korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our land
we didnt call the police we reacted
we are not in korea mr kowalski
ive been thinking about our
conversation on life and death
about what you said
about how you carry around all the horrible
things you were forced to do
horrible things that wont leave you
it seems that it would do you good to
unload some of that burden
things done during war are terrible
being ordered to kill
killing to save yourself
killing to save others
youre right those are things i
know nothing about
but i do know about forgiveness
and ive  seen a lot of men who
have confessed their sins
admitted their guilt and left
their burdens behind them
stronger men than you
men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things
and are now at peace
well i got to hand it to you padre you
came here with your guns loaded this time
thank you
and youre right about one thing
about stronger men than me
reaching their salvation
well hallefuckinlujah
but you are wrong about something else
whats that mr kowalski
the thing that haunts a man the most is what
he isnt ordered to do
there finally you look like a human being
again
you shouldnt wait so long
between haircuts you cheap son of a bitch
well i am surprised you are still around
i was always hoping that
you die off and they get
somebody in here they knew what
the hell they are doing
instead you just keep hanging around like
the dump wop dago you are
thatll be ten dollars walt
ten bucks jesus christ martin
what are you halfjew or something
you keep raising the prices all the time
its been ten bucks for the last
five years and you hardmellows

that it would make things easier
thank you karen
theres nothing wrong with making
things less hard on yourself
you know karens right dad youve worked
hard your whole life
maybe its time you start thinking about
taking it a easier
and some other thing dad you really
should get rid of the coffin nails
we were thinking about the house
you know when moms gone its got to be a
lot to maintain around here
let alone clean
and you are here all alone
yeah you know theres these great places
now you know these communities
where you dont have to worry about mowing
the lawn or shoveling snow
you know people who are like you active
and alert but are alone
and would benefit from being around folks
their own age
yeah dad look you got to check it out we
brought some brochures
these places are nothing like that you
think they would be they are great
no they are beautiful
they are really nice
they really are
these are topnotch like resorts
it is like staying in a hotel practically
theyre beautiful
they really are
yeah
they care of everything
they clean up theyre really nice
oh there are wonderful stores where you
can buy new shoes
they are amazing they really are
you have a good time play some golf maybe
meet other people
son of a bitch kicked us out on his
birthday ive told you that was a bad idea
i know you were right
he  wont let anybody help him
well we tried now can we just drop it
no one can say we didnt try
what the hell with him
we shouldnt have done it
we shouldve stayed home with josh and
ashley
at least they were smart
enough to not come here
the goddamn kids have more sense than we do
we miss mom dont we daisy
hey walt
what are you up to
were having a barbecue you want
to come over
what do you think
theres tons of food
just keep you hands off my dog
no worries we only eat cats
really

and a little beef jerky
come on over and get something to eat

well
i might as well drink with strangers better
than drinking alone it is my birthday
really happy birthday wally
dont call me wally
you have no pabts among the beer
as they say when in hmong
what am i doing wrong every time i look at
somebody they always look at the ground
what is she saying
she said welcome to our home
oh no she is not
yes she didnt
she hates me
yeah she hates you
okay
what what are all you fish heads looking
at anyway
i think we should go to other room sorry
all the people in this house are very
traditional
number 1 never touch a hmong person on the
head
not even a child hmongpeople
believe that the soul resides on the head
so dont do that
sounds dumb but fine
and a lot of hmong people consider looking
at someone eye to be very rude
thats why they look away when you look at
them  anything else
yeah some hmong people tend to smile or
grin when theyre yelled at
its a cultural thing
it expresses embarrassment or insecurity
its not that theyre laughing
at you really
you people are nuts
but the food
it looks good smells good too
of course its hmong food
okay and i come back in few seconds
here you go

all the tools and stuff
well may come as surprise to a thief
but i bought this stuff everything in here
with my own money
yeah yeah this is not what i meant
i mean this is so much shit packed in here
yeah well every tool in here has a
purpose everything has a job to do
they are all used when necessary
okay so what is that
it is a post hole digger
that
vicegrips
wire cutters you know thats a trowel
there is shears right there
and thats a saw
thats a tack hammer
you cant fool me kid
alright whats on your mind
its just i cant afford to buy all this
stuff
well i guess even a bonehead like you
could understand
that a man acquires it over the period of
50 years
yeah but
all right look here
these three items right here you can have
this
wd40 vice grips and some duck tape
any man who is worth his salt
can do half of the house chores
with just those three things
anything else you need you just borrow it
thats all
ok cool
fuck me
whats with that
nothing
what
nothing huh i just saw
youve coughed out blood
thats not good you should
really see a doctor
look
those guys over here the other night
on my lawn what a bout them  just a
gang a bunch of hmong gang bangers
i assume that
what they were doing here
they were going to take me away
they were kind of pissed that
i blew my first initiation
yeah well you are you are a pussy you
wanna hang out with guys like that
what was your initiation supposed to be
my gran torino
toad you got a minute

i take the top cause thats the heaviest
ill pull on that
and you stand right back here and you push
and help me push it up each step
like that
then let me take the top
no no ive got a top

it looks pretty heavy
look i am not crippled
ive got the top
if you dont let me take the top
i aint helping i will go back home
listen to me zipper head
no you listen old man
i am here because you need help
so it is either top of i am
out of here
all right you take the top and ill push
dont let it slip off you little girl hands
and crush me

that thing weighs a ton
runs like a clock
they dont make them like this anymore
so what are you going to do with it
sell it i guess
how much
60 bucks
i am tired of having this sit around down
in the basement there

in the paper

role models in his life
