like selfesteem issues
sweetie
you may need to
talk to someone
you know
there are razor hairs
in the bathroom
again today
really
you know
it gives me allergies
next time you have
one of your
weird dreams

youre something useful
like a vacuum cleaner
we have a cleaning lady
what do you want
for her to think
were a pair of fuckups
thats exactly
what we are
whoo
you okay
ive got sand
in my eyes
look at mommy
i dreamt
i was an arrow

hes got a girlfriend
although you know
its funny her name
didnt come up once
yeah well
katies mature
enough to know
that when it comes to men
it doesnt matter
yeah well
katie also knows
that something
must have triggered
his sudden enthusiasm
to see her mom
who by the way
knows him better
than anyone
and is clearly
the best person to judge
oh and uh

dear rosie
i cant believe it
here i am at last
finally walking
the mediterranean coast
ive lost count of the years
ive waited for this moment
somehow life got in the way
and it was all good
i dont regret
a minute of it
but we forget
our dreams at our peril
i know you had yours too
and it must feel sometimes
like theyre gone for good
but im so proud
of the woman
youve become rosie
of the mother
youve been to katie
what i once said
about you is still true
theres nothing you cant do
if you put your mind to it
so keep chasing
those dreams
will you darling
for my sake dad
how can someone
just not be
there anymore
fuck knows
at least he did
everything he wanted
he didnt forget
his dreams
what if i told you
i was gonna use my share
of the money
from the house
and get myself a hotel
somewhere simple but
but my own place
i think that
would be awesome mom
rosie
i understand that you
havent been in touch
and i just need
to know one thing
are you happy with him
theres not much
i got right in my life
but this family
somehow were making it work
so i guess
the one word answer
to your question should be
yes
hey
hi
so look at this
the sweetlands hotel
thats where
we had our end
of school dance
ah they just
joined our group
and i was just
checking for discounts
and i found

i dont want to intrude
so if this is all wrong
just ignore it
and i promise ill never
broach the subject again
gregs not the man
for you rosie
twice ive let you
slip through my fingers
lets stop being afraid
and take the chance
i know now i can
make you happy
call me if you
feel the same way
love alex
bethany
what are you doing there
i live here now
i moved in
look who it is
mr schnuffs
mr schnuffs
rosie
uh
hey baby that thing
we were talking
about earlier
yeah
ask her now
schnuffie
um
bethany and me
uh we thought
why hang around you know
um so she started
organizing the whole thing
but then phil said no
so your name came up
obviously
were getting married
its fast but we need
to fit it in before
new york fashion week
and you have to
be our best man
i mean you are
a girl but right
this is all
because of you rosie
you told me to come here
it wouldnt have happened
if it wasnt for you
thank you
hmm
it is so great
having you as a friend
i mean every time
something goes
wrong in my life
all i got to do
is look at yours
and it puts everything
into perspective
he proposed
to her on a boat
its like kate and leonardo
in that scene on the deck
the  titanic
mmhmm
how appropriate
look alex is yours
he always has been
this is just
proof of ownership
he wrote that months ago
and anyway
hes my best friend
no
im your best friend
get it yet
we just keep
missing each other
maybe were just
not meant to be
right
let me just try
and explain this
in a language
you might understand
ship iceberg
ship hits iceberg
mayhem horror
ocean of ice
and then alex
on the last lifeboat
one space left
is it bethany
or rosie
whos it going to be
what youre
immigrating now
less time more outfits
youre paying excess
i couldnt leave her
behind and wherever
katie goes toby goes
oh are you two
an item now
no way were friends
no way were friends
god give me strength
well come on
were really late
relax
i hate arriving early
and besides we have
a five or six hour
cushion on the other side
um sorry
whats going on
volcanic ash
i need to go to boston
im afraid its a five
to six hour delay
i think your
cushion just burst
slow down
im not wearing
a sports bra
okay you guys
get your stuff
katie move it
im coming im coming
ruby come on
mom
and you thought
the flight was rough
youll have to get
dressed in the van
we are so late
excuse me
you get everything
the wrong way
round over here
and you are
ruby
a pleasure
to meet you ruby
likewise
will you marry me
yeah
what thats not
thats not fair
thats not
it cant be that easy
its not
i think she wants
all the women
around her to look fat
well it works
no no you dont know
how hard it is
final word of warning
alex can hold his drink
to an almost lethal degree
as i discovered
on my 18th birthday
when he decided a night
of tequila slammers
was the way to go
whoo
well you know
when people say that
they were so drunk
that the whole night
is a blank
and you always go
no way not possible
well believe me
its possible
choosing a
choosing the person
that you want to
share your life with
is one of the most
important decisions
any of us makes
ever
because when its wrong
it turns your life
to grey
and sometimes
sometimes
you dont even notice
until you wake up
one morning
and realize
years have gone by
we both know
about that one alex
your friendship
has brought glorious
technicolor to my life
its been there even
in the darkest of times
and i am the luckiest
person alive for that gift
i hope i didnt take it
for granted
i think maybe i did
because sometimes
you dont see
that the best thing
thats ever happened to you
is sitting there
right under your nose
but thats fine too
it really is
because ive realized that
no matter where you are
or what youre doing
or who youre with
i will always
honestly truly
completely love you
like a sister
loves a brother
and a friend loves a friend
ill always stand guard
over your dreams alex
no matter how weird
or twisted they get
so please everybody
join me in a toast
to the bride and groom
to the bride and groom
come on show me
what youve got
no please
well okay then
ready
here we go
you like it
baby baby whats up
katie
katie just
she just went through here
katie
mom
what are you
doing out here
huh
toby kissed me mom
oh
is that such a bad thing
of course it is
hey look i
i was watching
you two tonight
youre good together
youre a team
dont you get it
it would be like you two
kissing or something
ill just tell him
to forget the whole thing
katie that
that would be
a big mistake
look if you
reject him now
hes gonna make it
his lifes mission
to go out there
and meet the most perfect
beautiful girl in the world
just to try
and get over you
and hell end up
marrying this other woman
and spending the rest
of his life with her
and you know
hell tell himself
that shes perfect and
he really must be happy
but she wont be you
you know
but you two never
actually kissed
did you
of course not
katie
toby
im really sorry
lets just pretend
it never happened
alex
i only realized uh
tonight that you forgot
your 18th birthday
about five tequila
slammers in i think
before you fell
off the stool
so thats why you took
bethany to the dance
and you went with greg
well bye

those things off
