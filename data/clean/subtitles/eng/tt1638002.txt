you weren t

ugh 
 in battle
 to preserve sanity 
 must remember
 following rules 
 number one 
 never breast feed
 in a public place 
 two  never bounce
 katie on knee
 after feeding 
ugh 
 three  try not to
 cry when she cries 
 and four 
 the most important of all

what happened to greg 
he miraculously

alive  you know 
so there was at least
someone out there

new person i ve become 
so  the last time
i looked that depressed

quick  quick  mommy 
excuse me 
oh 
love you 
love you  too 
you dreamt you were
an inanimate object 
yeah  i mean  come on 
an arrow flying
through the air 
that s pretty cool 
i don t understand 
how can you be a thing 
i don t know 
i ve always had
dreams like that 
it sounds to me
like self esteem issues 
sweetie 
you may need to
talk to someone 
you know 
there are razor hairs
in the bathroom 
again today 
really 
you know
it gives me allergies 
next time you have
one of your
weird dreams 
maybe you should dream
you re something useful
like a vacuum cleaner 
we have a cleaning lady 
what do you want 
for her to think
we re a pair of fuck ups 
that s exactly
what we are 
whoo 
you okay 
i ve got sand
in my eyes 
look at mommy 
 i dreamt
 i was an arrow 
what have you told
the poor brat 
no  just that
he sent me a ticket 
i ve got no expectations 
well  good  because
he s got a girlfriend 
although you know
it s funny  her name
didn t come up once 
yeah  well 
katie s mature
enough to know
that when it comes to men 
it doesn t matter 
yeah  well 
katie also knows
that something
must have triggered
his sudden enthusiasm
to see her mom 
who  by the way 
knows him better
than anyone 
and is clearly
the best person to judge 
oh  and  uh   
all right  all right 
good to see you 
so  tired  hungry 
no  why 
come on 
do you want another 
um  yeah 
all right

 strange to think
 that i could have lived here
 and been part of it 
but i don t regret katie

she s the most amazing kid 
the weird thing is
that she reminds me

and seeing where
we live  you know 
our apartment 
our lifestyle  it s just

up the career ladder

amazing eyes

 dear rosie 
 i can t believe it 
 here i am at last 
 finally walking
 the mediterranean coast 
 i ve lost count of the years
 i ve waited for this moment 
 somehow life got in the way 
 and it was all good 
 i don t regret
 a minute of it 
 but we forget
 our dreams at our peril 
 i know you had yours  too 
 and it must feel sometimes
 like they re gone for good 
 but i m so proud
 of the woman
 you ve become  rosie 
 of the mother
 you ve been to katie 
 what i once said
 about you is still true 
 there s nothing you can t do
 if you put your mind to it 
 so keep chasing
 those dreams 
 will you  darling 
 for my sake  dad 
how can someone
just not be
there anymore 
fuck knows 
at least he did
everything he wanted 
he didn t forget
his dreams 
what if i told you
i was gonna use my share
of the money
from the house
and get myself a hotel 
somewhere simple but   
but my own place 
i think that
would be awesome  mom 
 rosie 
 i understand that you
 haven t been in touch 
 and i just need
 to know one thing 
 are you happy with him 
 there s not much
 i got right in my life 
 but this family 
 somehow we re making it work 
 so i guess
 the one word answer
 to your question should be 
  yes  
hey 
hi 
so look at this 
the sweetlands hotel 
that s where
we had our end
of school dance 
ah  they just
joined our group 
and i was just
checking for discounts 
and i found
this booking   
that s greg s name 
the bridal suite 
for this weekend 
mm hmm 
he s already up
there on business 
do you think   
for our anniversary 
oh 
it s him 
mmm 
hey 
 uh  listen  i m gonna
 have to stay here
 a few extra nights 
 the guys need me
 to check out
 some more venues 
 um  can you take katie
 and go to your mom s 
 and then i can swing by
 on sunday and pick you up 
 babe 
fine 
 cool  see you later  then 
talk later 
 bye 
check the booking 
here it is 
bridal suite for two 
checked in two hours ago   
oh  rosie  i m   
rosie  rosie 
what are you going to say 
fuck 
 rosie 
 you deserve someone
who loves you with
every beat of his heart 
 someone who will always
be there for you 
 and who will love
every part of you 
especially your flaws 
  i know katie needs her dad 
 i don t want to intrude 
  so if this is all wrong 
 just ignore it
  and i promise i ll never
 broach the subject again 
  greg s not the man
 for you  rosie 
  twice i ve let you
 slip through my fingers 
  let s stop being afraid
 and take the chance 
  i know now i can
 make you happy 
  call me if you
 feel the same way 
  love  alex  
bethany 
what are you doing there 
 i live here now 
 i moved in 
 look who it is 
 mr  schnuffs 
mr  schnuffs 
 rosie 
 uh   
 hey    baby  that thing
 we were talking
 about earlier 
  yeah 
  ask her now 
 schnuffie   
 um   
 bethany and me 
 uh  we thought 
 why hang around  you know 
 um  so  she started
 organizing the whole thing 
 but then phil said no 
 so your name came up 
 obviously 
 we re getting married 
 it s fast  but we need
 to fit it in before
 new york fashion week 
 and you have to
 be our best man 
 i mean  you are
 a girl but    right 
 this is all
 because of you  rosie 
 you told me to come here 
 it wouldn t have happened
 if it wasn t for you 
 thank you 
hmm 
it is so great
having you as a friend 
i mean  every time
something goes
wrong in my life 
all i got to do
is look at yours
and it puts everything
into perspective 
he proposed
to her on a boat 
it s like kate and leonardo
in that scene on the deck 
the  titanic 
mm hmm 
how appropriate 
look  alex is yours 
he always has been 
this is just
proof of ownership 
he wrote that months ago 
and anyway
he s my best friend 
no 
i m your best friend 
get it yet 
we just keep
missing each other 
maybe we re just
not meant to be 
right 
let me just try
and explain this
in a language
you might understand 
ship  iceberg 
ship hits iceberg 
mayhem  horror 
ocean of ice
and then alex
on the last lifeboat 
one space left 
is it bethany 
or rosie 
who s it going to be 
what  you re
immigrating now 
less time  more outfits 
you re paying excess 
i couldn t leave her
behind and wherever
katie goes  toby goes 
oh  are you two
an item now 
no way  we re friends 
no way  we re friends 
god give me strength 
well  come on 
we re really late 
relax 
i hate arriving early 
and besides  we have
a five or six hour
cushion on the other side 
um  sorry 
what s going on 
volcanic ash 
i need to go to boston 
i m afraid it s a five
to six hour delay 
i think your
cushion just burst 
slow down 
i m not wearing
a sports bra 
okay  you guys 
get your stuff 
katie move it 
i m coming  i m coming 
ruby  come on 
mom 
and you thought
the flight was rough 
you ll have to get
dressed in the van 
we are so late 
excuse me 
you get everything
the wrong way
round over here 
and you are 
ruby 
a pleasure
to meet you  ruby 
likewise 
will you marry me 
yeah 
what  that s not   
that s not fair 
that s not   
it can t be that easy 
it s not   
i think she wants
all the women
around her to look fat 
well  it works 
no  no  you don t know
how hard it is 
 final word of warning 
 alex can hold his drink
 to an almost lethal degree 
as i discovered
on my 18th birthday 
when he decided a night
of tequila slammers
was the way to go 
whoo 
well  you know
when people say that
they were so drunk 
that the whole night
is a blank
and you always go 
 no way  not possible  
well  believe me 
it s possible 
choosing a   
choosing the person
that you want to
share your life with
is one of the most
important decisions
any of us makes 
ever 
because when it s wrong 
it turns your life
to grey 
and sometimes   
sometimes
you don t even notice
until you wake up
one morning
and realize
years have gone by 
we both know
about that one  alex 
your friendship
has brought glorious
technicolor to my life 
it s been there even
in the darkest of times 
and i am the luckiest
person alive for that gift 
i hope i didn t take it
for granted 
i think maybe i did 
because sometimes
you don t see
that the best thing
that s ever happened to you
is sitting there 
right under your nose 
but that s fine  too 
it really is 
because i ve realized that
no matter where you are
or what you re doing 
or who you re with 
i will always
honestly  truly 
completely love you 
like a sister
loves a brother
and a friend loves a friend 
i ll always stand guard
over your dreams  alex 
no matter how weird
or twisted they get 
so  please  everybody 
join me in a toast 
to the bride and groom 
to the bride and groom 
come on  show me
what you ve got 
no  please 
well  okay then 
ready 
here we go 
you like it 
baby  baby  what s up 
katie 
katie just   
she just went through here 
katie 
mom 
what are you
doing out here 
huh 
toby kissed me  mom 
oh 
is that such a bad thing 
of course it is 
hey  look  i   
i was watching
you two tonight 
you re good together 
you re a team 
don t you get it 
it would be like you two
kissing or something 
i ll just tell him
to forget the whole thing 
katie that   
that would be
a big mistake 
look  if you
reject him now 
he s gonna make it
his life s mission
to go out there
and meet the most perfect 
beautiful girl in the world
just to try
and get over you 
and he ll end up
marrying this other woman
and spending the rest
of his life with her 
and you know 
he ll tell himself
that she s perfect and   
he really must be happy 
but she won t be you 
you know 
but you two never
actually kissed 
did you 
of course not 
katie 
toby 
i m really sorry 
let s just pretend
it never happened   
alex 
i only realized  uh 
tonight that you forgot 
your 18th birthday 
about five tequila
slammers in  i think 
 before you fell
 off the stool   
so that s why you took
bethany to the dance 
and you went with greg 
well  bye 
okay 
cheers 
it s so nice 
your own hotel 
darling 
your father would be
so proud of you 
babe  babe 
we ve got a visitor 
do you have a room 
yes  of course 
a single 
for one night 
welcome 
you are our first guest 
have we met before 
the condom came off
inside my vagina
and at present
i m unable to locate it 
i don t think so 
ruby  would you please
see our guest
upstairs to his room 
of course 
and free champagne 
all right 
follow me and then   
yeah  a brand new
bed  and

um   
so  i  uh

so your wife   
won t be joining me 
we both knew
it wasn t right

um  sea it is 
one room with sea view 
um  ruby would you mind
showing our guest upstairs
sorry  chief 
but i m really busy
doing the files right now 
um  please  follow me 
so  i had this weird dream
on the plane over   
let me guess 
you were a clip
on the seatbelts 
no  i know 
you were  um  a valve
in those annoying fans
that blow cold air on you 
i can never turn
those things off 
no 
no  uh   
i was me 
and you were you 
standing where
you are right now  perfect 
and i took you in my arms 
in a manly kind of way 
like this
