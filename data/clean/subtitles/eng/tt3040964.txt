as the tale of the cub we call mowgli 
you must be the very
worst wolf i ve ever seen 
yeah  but if that branch didn t break 
i would ve made it 
crossing upwind 
breaking from your numbers 
if you can t learn to run with the pack   
one of these days 
you ll be someone s dinner 
  how d we do 
  not mowgli  again 
  he s never gonna make the council 
  let s go 
race you to the top 
it was higher ground 
wolves don t hide in trees 
i can t keep up with them  bagheera 
i tried  i just picked the wrong tree 
it was a dead tree 
how was i supposed to know
it was dead 
it had a fig vine 
any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it 
  these are things a wolf must know 
  yeah 
but if the branch didn t break 
i would ve made it 
i realise you weren t born a wolf   
but couldn t you at least act like one 
when i found him   
many years ago   
he was just an infant 
abandoned in the woods 
get the deer 
if he
was going to survive   
i knew he needed a people 
a people to protect him 
that s why i entrusted him
to the wolves 
look well  wolves 
akela was
a just and noble leader 
he allowed mowgli to dwell
among them  all those years 
the trouble was  wolves grew so fast   
and mowgli   
let s just say he liked to take his time 
mowgli  pick me up high 
  my turn 
  stop  not now 
it was raksha
who raised him 
she was the only mother he ever knew 
  come on  let s play 
  i don t feel like playing  gray 
come on  you re my brother 
you have to play with me 
let s go chase some mice 
how did it go 
caught me again 
if it s meant to be   
it will be 
let me hear the law 
 this is the law of the jungle   
 as old and as true as the sky 
 the wolf that keeps it will prosper   
 but the wolf that breaks it will die 
 like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk   
 the law runneth over and back 
 for the strength of the pack
is the wolf   
 and the strength of the wolf
is the pack  
soon 
the rain ceased to fall
and the dry season arrived 
heat crept through the jungle   
turning it yellow   
then brown   
then black 
but that year   
was the driest season
that anyone could remember 
even the mohwa didn t flower 
my leaf 
this is mine  mine  mine  mine 
there s a rock  that s mud  that s mud 
there s a rock  that s my rock 
that s my rock 
nobody touches my rock 
there s another rock 
two rocks  three rocks 
peace rock  peace rock 
it s the truce  the water truce 
it s the water truce 
it had been
many  many years
since the peace rock was revealed   
and the water truce was called 
hunting at the riverbank
was now forbidden   
because  by law of the jungle 
drinking comes before eating 
so  you could come to the peace rock 
on a day like this   
and find all people side by side 
don t forget 
no hunting 
playing only 
playing  only  i got it  ami 
and remember   
not everyone here has seen
a man cub in the jungle before 
so  behave yourself 
okay  can i go now 
take the pups with you 
wait for me 
come on  gray 
oh  take a look at this guy 
excuse me 
sorry 
  he s walking on two legs 
  don t stare 
hey  look  a wild boar 
  and a rhino 
  and a mongoose 
everybody s here 
is that a peacock 
  ooh  a stick 
  oh  that s my stick 
  i like this stick 
  seriously  that s my stick 
  this is my stick 
  no  that s my stick 
  let go of my stick 
  it s a water truce 
it s a water truce 
sorry 
my bad  it s involuntary 
i could pee on it 
watch yourself  please 
dad  what is that 
i think that s a man cub 
what s a man cub doing here 
whoa  don t forget the truce 
i know the law  bucks 
what is that 
  weird 
  that s weird 
mowgli 
what was the rule about your tricks 
it s not the wolf way 
no more tricks 
chin up  little one 
we ll make you a fine wolf  yet 
what about me 
am i gonna be a fine wolf 
look at me howl 
in some packs  the runt gets eaten 
oh   
mowgli  behind me 
don t leave my side 
everyone comes to peace rock 
so many smells to catch up on 
but  um   
i can t help but notice   
there s this strange odour today 
what is it  this scent that i m on 
i almost   
i almost think it was some kind of   
man cub 
mowgli belongs
to my pack  shere khan 
mowgli 
they ve given it a name 
when was it we came to adopt
man into the jungle 
he s just a cub 
does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do 
shift your hunting ground
for a few years   
and everyone forgets
how the law works 
well  let me remind you 
a man cub becomes man   
and man is forbidden 
  what do you know about law 
  raksha 
hunting for pleasure  killing for power 
you ve never known law 
the cub is mine 
mine to me 
so  go back to where you came from 
you burned beast 
the tiger knows who rules
this part of the jungle 
i m sure he doesn t mean to come here
and make threats 
especially during a water truce 
no  i m deeply respectful of these laws
that keep us safe 
so  here s my promise 
nothing lasts forever 
the rains will return
and the river will rise 
and when this rock disappears 
that truce will end 
you want to protect him  fine 
but ask yourselves 
how many lives is a man cub worth 
how many lives 
who could answer that question 
  the rain 
  rain 
  rain 
  the rain 
keep it dry  keep it dry  keep it dry 
these quills
get stuck on everything 
when the rains returned   
it was a question
the council had to face 
they deliberated and they argued   
for many days 
what do you think they re talking about 
no one had ever
come between the pack before 
but shere khan s threat   
was not to be ignored 
mowgli  you re not supposed
to go up there 
he s got to go 
look at the skies 
shere khan may be heading here
as we speak 
please 
i m leaving 
i don t want to see anyone get hurt 
mowgli  go back to the den 
a man cub belongs with man 
we raised him as one of our own 
  he ll have the boy  either way 
  akela 
maybe i can be of help 
the boy s right 
maybe it s time he found another people 
  no 
  i m the one who brought him to you 
and now i ll return him
to where he belongs 
i won t let you 
he s my cub 
we knew this day would come 
we are the only family he s ever known 
raksha 
it s the only place he ll be safe 
it s okay  ami 
i won t go far 
i ll come back and visit 
never forget this   
you re mine 
mine to me 
no matter where you go 
or what they may call you   
you will always be   
my son 
i wish i could tell you   
that the wolves
could ve fought shere khan 
but this is not that kind of a tale 
the turtles like me 
maybe the crocodiles 
what about the rhinos 
they always let me hang around 
of course  the rhinos sleep standing up 
i don t think i d be very good at that 
it s either the turtles or the crocodiles 
which one do you think is better 
neither 
what do you mean 
i m bringing you to the man village 
what 
bagheera  i don t know man 
you will 
you always said
we re not supposed
to go near a man village 
that was different 
why is it different 
you always said   stay away
from the man village   
 because you might fall in a trap   
 or get eaten 
or get hurt by flying rocks  
i know what i said 
whoa  elephants 
  bow your head 
  why 
show them respect 
the elephants
created this jungle 
where they made furrows
with their tusks 
the rivers ran 
where they blew with
their trunks  the leaves fell 
they made all that belongs 
the mountains  the trees   
the birds in the trees 
but they did not make you 
that is why you must go 
what if i live with the nilgai 
no 
or the mongoose 
this is not a discussion 
but this is my home 
i don t even know what man s like 
you ll learn 
but i wanna stay in the jungle 
why do i have to go there 
because the jungle
is no longer safe for you 
you re being hunted   
by a tiger 
only man can protect you now 
whoa 
this isn t fair 
you re not giving me a choice 
there s a lot of stuff
you re not telling me  too 
don t think i didn t notice 
you say you re taking me
where i came from   
but you found me in the jungle 
are you bringing me back
to the jungle  no 
why are you bringing me
to the man village
if you found me in the jungle 
and why does the tiger
hate me so much 
does he know me 
sure seems like he knows me 
down 
what  now we have to bow
to the buffalo  too 
listen to me  this is not a game 
you re gonna run to that ravine 
what are you talking about 
go to the north 
where the sky glows at night 
i ll find you on that path 
bagheera  i m not taking one
more step until you tell me   
run  mowgli 
run 
gray  what s wrong 
why don t you come outside and play 
what is that 
why did he have to leave 
gray 
we could ve protected him 
we shouldn t have let him go 
i miss him  too 
what s important is  he s safe now 
get inside 
i suppose you know why i ve come 
the man cub has left the jungle 
i thought i made myself clear 
i wanted him turned over to me 
we no longer harbour him 
he has left the pack 
and where  may i ask  has he gone 
he s with his own kind now 
so  the man cub has left the jungle 
that s right 
you and i no longer have a quarrel 
and  most importantly   
we have peace 
i guess it s done  then 
unless i can draw him   
back out 
akela 
have i got your attention now 
i didn t want it to be this way 
i made it so simple 
all i asked for was one thing 
and you denied me 
that ends now 
spread the word 
until i have the man cub 
these hills are my hills 
you did not respond to reason 
so now  you will know fear 
bagheera 
hmm 
hey  there 
do you have a language 
you re kind of cute  i guess 
you want a bite 
come on 
come here  come on  it s all right 
don t be afraid 
come on 
hey  those are mine 
hey  come back 
those are mine 
drop it 
hello 
who s out there 
hi  little cub 
oh  no  don t be scared 
i m not gonna hurt you 
i was just passing through 
i don t want any trouble 
there s no trouble 
are you alone out here 
mmm  that s not good 
we should never be alone 
i m waiting for a friend 
he should be here soon 
i can stay with you 
until he gets here 
would that be all right 
i ll keep you safe 
just you and me  sweet thing 
who are you 
kaa 
poor  sweet little cub 
what are you doing
so deep in the jungle 
this is my home 
don t you know what you are 
i know what you are 
i know where you came from 
you do 
yes 
would you like to see 
yeah 
mostly  men stay in their village   
far from the dark of the jungle 
but sometimes   
they travel 
and when they do   
their caves breathe in the dark 
they call it   
the red flower 
man s creation 
it brings warmth and light   
and destruction to all that it touches 
who is that 
the traveller  protecting his cub 
shere khan ended
the man s life that night 
but not before he was burned
by the red flower s touch 
he ran so fast  he didn t
notice the cub he left behind 
and that cub   
was you 
the panther found you 
oh  you poor  sweet thing 
you want to stay in the jungle 
you can be with me  if you want 
i ll keep you close 
let go of your fear  now 
trust   
in me 
relax  kid

thanks 
okay  so  we re even now 
hold on a minute 
what s your name anyway 
we were never properly introduced 
  mowgli 
  mowgli 
mowgli is a terrific name 
i bet you got that one
all to yourself  too 
hey 
mowgli  look   
i got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks   
on account of the hibernation 
i could really use your help 
you know  if you stuck around   
i can t  i have to go to the man village 
uh   
for what reason  man village 
i don t have a choice 
there s a tiger hunting me 
really  why a tiger 
because i m a man cub  all right 
just leave me alone 
hey  mowgli  my friend 
my buddy  my pal 
slow down a second  handsome 
bagheera said i have to go
to the man village 
oh  bagheera  i know him  sure 
you know what his problem is 
he always plays by the rules 
and  sometimes rules
were meant to be   
well  not necessarily broken 
but certainly bent 
and definitely reinterpreted 
don t you think 
he told me to go to the man village 
so  that s where i m gonna go 
okay  fine 
you wanna go to the man village 
have it your way 
in fact  i ll do you one better 
i ll take you there myself 
come on  let s go  it s getting late 
bare necessities
forget about
your worries and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
what s that 
that s a song about the good life 
what s a song 
you never
heard a song before 
everyone s got a song 
didn t the wolves ever sing 
i don t know 
uh    oh   
we recited the law of the jungle 
 this is the law of the jungle   
 as old and as true as the sky 
 the wolf that keeps it may prosper   
 but the wolf that breaks it will die  
kid  that s not a song 
that s propaganda 
what s propaganda 
just a little farther 
that s the man village 
yep  you can always
tell by the red flower 
they do love their red flower 
the red flower doesn t seem so bad 
yeah 
let it loose  and it destroys
everything it touches 
don t ever play with it 
you got that 
yeah  i got it 
good 
do you think that s where i m from 
could be 
i don t know  kid  does it look familiar 
i don t remember it 
all i remember is living with the wolves 
why do you wanna go there 
bagheera said i need a people 
again  with the listening to bagheera 
hey  he s my friend  okay 
now i don t even know where he is 
i can t believe i m leaving
the jungle for good 
may i say just one thing 
what i saw you do today 
i ve never seen anything like it 
i ve been trying to get
that honey for years 
but i used my tricks 
what tricks 
you know   
everything that i built 
it s not the wolf way 
who cares   the wolf way  
that s the mowgli way 
that s the baloo way 
that s our way 
that s how we get things done 
i can t even imagine what kind
of potential you d have   
if you had somebody like me
helping you out 
you say you want to go
to the man village 
i say  you could be a man right here 
i ll tell you what 
now you know where the man village is 
you can always go down there 
whenever you want 
but i would personally appreciate it   
as a personal favour to me  personally   
if we just worked together 
just us  tricks and all 
i think it would be interesting to see   
just how much honey
we could accumulate   
before winter 
whatever i could do to make
your trickiness happen   
i will do 
and if it turns out to
not be fun for you   
i will walk you right down
to that man village myself 
is that a deal 
just till winter 
just till winter 
ami  wake up 
pups 
they re up there 
the deer  of course 
take comfort in numbers 
they lack defences
most animals will have 
and if we re being honest   
they re not very smart either 
unlike the mother crocodile 
who is a good deal more clever 
but the one you have to watch out for   
is the cuckoo bird 
do you know
how the cuckoo bird survives 
by preying on a mother s weakness 
the cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young 
instead  it sneaks   
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds 
so  when they hatch   
the mother bird is fooled 
she feeds them  nurtures them 
and do you know what happens
to her own chicks 
they starve   
and die   
from neglect 
all because a mother loved a chick   
that wasn t her own 
come now  time for sleep 
i think they like me 
why are you doing this 
he s gone 
isn t that what you wanted 
i want him dead 
once he gets word
of what happened here   
he ll come back 
and i ll be waiting 
  that s the first mark 
  got it 
  that s the first mark 
  got it 
that s the first mark 
got it 
whoo 
yeah  i got it 
  tell him to go to the second mark 
  got it 
  go to the second mark 
  got it 
got it 
look for the
bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother nature s recipes
that bring the bare
necessities of life
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldn t be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing
in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look under
the rocks and plants
and take a glance at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
the bare necessities of life
they ll come to you 
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldn t be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look
under the rocks and plants
and then take a glance
at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
mmm  mmm 
the bare necessities of life
they ll come to you
they will come to you
yeah  they ll come to you 
come to you 
baloo  baloo  baloo    look 
stay low on my back 
come on out and show yourself 
bagheera  ah 
mowgli 
oh  i was looking everywhere for you 
i thought you were gone 
  are you all right 
  yeah 
i can t believe you found me 
i was so worried about you 
i was lost  and i didn t know
what happened   
but then i met baloo 
and then he saved me
from a giant snake 
and now we re working together 
really 
that s a new wrinkle 
i didn t know sloth bears worked 
come on  mowgli  let s be on our way 
wait 
yeah  go on ahead  i ll catch up 
don t be mad  okay 
why would i be mad 
because you re always mad
when i do stuff 
you gotta promise
not to be mad this time 
show me  then i ll decide 
come on  check it out 
these are vines i use on the cliff 
i twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger 
see how strong they are 
you wanna see the really cool part 
it s inside  come on  let s go 
come on 
it s the honey stash for winter 
have you lost your mind 
you said you wouldn t get mad 
did you listen to anything
akela taught you 
there s no place   
in the jungle for these   
tricks 
you want to do this 
you do this in the man village 
but i m helping baloo
get ready for hibernation 
bears don t hibernate in a jungle 
what are you teaching him 
not full hibernation  but i nap a lot 
listen to me  you con artist 
he may not know your game  but i do 
  he s leaving now 
  but i don t wanna leave 
you don t have a choice 
why don t we all just
settle down for a minute 
look  it s gotten late 
too late to travel 
so  why don t we all
just have a little honey   
i don t eat honey 
no problem  i ll eat the honey 
let s all get a good night s sleep   
and we can talk about this
in the morning 
fine  but we re leaving  first thing 
mowgli 
where is he 
  in the pit 
  in the what 
  is this your teaching 
  oh  come on 
you know i d never teach him
to mess around with elephants 
hey  guys 
what d i tell you  he s special 
i know he s special 
i raised him 
then don t make him leave  bagheera 
you gotta let him be what he is 
you don t understand 
the boy s in danger 
i know  he told me 
he s being hunted by a tiger 
not any tiger  shere khan 
shere khan s hunting him 
oh 
but if you send him back
to the man village 
they ll ruin him 
they ll make a man out of him 
we should send him back
to the wolf pack 
who s their alpha 
akela  he can protect him 
akela is dead 
  what 
  shere khan killed him 
he will stop at nothing
until he has this boy 
nothing 
the only way we can save him   
is if he goes to that man village 
please  baloo 
you re the only one he ll listen to 
hey  kid 
hey 
that was pretty cool 
what you did back there 
bagheera didn t think so 
oh  no  i talked to him 
he was very impressed 
he was 
we both were  yeah 
i ve never seen anyone get
that close to an elephant before 
so  listen  kid 
i gotta talk to you about something 
what do you wanna talk about 
i ve been thinking 
now that your friend has shown up   
maybe it s time   
for you two to just mosey along 
now it s winter   
and it s really time for you to go 
but i wanna stay here with you 
we re buddies  aren t we 
huh  no  we were never friends 
i certainly never thought
of you as my friend 
you helped me get honey
and i don t really need you any more   
do i have to spell this out 
i don t want you around any more 
i did it 
and that s about the hardest thing
i ve ever done 
i know 
go away 
get away from me

that s what makes you a man 
you can summon the red flower   
and control it 
they told me not to go near

because once you have it 
you rise to the top of the food chain 
nothing in this jungle can stand up   
to the red flower

would ever dream

i got desire  you got the fire
but the dream i dream takes two

to reach our full potential 
bring me that red flower   
and we will rule this jungle 
i will protect you 
and you will want for nothing 
ever again

let me interrupt myself 
i just gotta say   
you guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows 
no one ever gets up close to you

because of the smell 
the smell is rough 
but it s not just   oh  look at me

you came up with this stuff 
with the thumb 
come on  show me 
how do you do that  i can t do that 
look  i scratch  i rub  i can grab a fish 
but i was hoping  and you may
not be open to this at all   
but i was hoping 
and once again  it s a dream   
but i was hoping that i might become   
a bandar log myself 
gosh  i wanna be like you 
i am hitching my wagon to your star 
no one leaves 
i can show myself out  thanks  bye bye

no claws  no fur  no teeth   
and no friends 
 this is the law of the jungle   
 as old and as true as the sky  
what is this 
 the wolf that keeps it may prosper   
 but the wolf
that breaks it will die  
you fools 
 like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk   
 the law runneth over and back

between me and the man cub

look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother nature s recipes
that bring the bare
necessities of life
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldn t be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing
in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look under
the rocks and plants
and take a glance at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
the bare necessities of life
they ll come to you 
look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
that s why a bear can rest at ease
with just the bare necessities of life
so just relax
in my backyard
if you act like that bee acts
you re working too hard
don t spend your time
just looking around
for something you want
that can t be found
when you find out
you can live without it
and go along not thinking about it
i ll tell you something true
the bare necessities of life
the bare necessities of life
will come to you
water  air  love
house with a roof above
talking  bout the bare
necessities of life
wisdom  understanding  sleep
good health
is something you must keep
