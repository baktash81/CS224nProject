as the tale of the cub we call mowgli
you must be the very
worst wolf ive ever seen
yeah but if that branch didnt break
i wouldve made it
crossing upwind
breaking from your numbers
if you cant learn to run with the pack
one of these days
youll be someones dinner
howd we do
not mowgli again
hes never gonna make the council
lets go
race you to the top
it was higher ground
wolves dont hide in trees
i cant keep up with them bagheera
i tried i just picked the wrong tree
it was a dead tree
how was i supposed to know
it was dead
it had a fig vine
any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it
these are things a wolf must know
yeah
but if the branch didnt break
i wouldve made it
i realise you werent born a wolf
but couldnt you at least act like one
when i found him
many years ago
he was just an infant
abandoned in the woods
get the deer
if he
was going to survive
i knew he needed a people
a people to protect him
thats why i entrusted him
to the wolves
look well wolves
akela was
a just and noble leader
he allowed mowgli to dwell
among them all those years
the trouble was wolves grew so fast
and mowgli
lets just say he liked to take his time
mowgli pick me up high
my turn
stop not now
it was raksha
who raised him
she was the only mother he ever knew
come on lets play
i dont feel like playing gray
come on youre my brother
you have to play with me
lets go chase some mice
how did it go
caught me again
if its meant to be
it will be
let me hear the law
this is the law of the jungle
as old and as true as the sky
the wolf that keeps it will prosper
but the wolf that breaks it will die
like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk
the law runneth over and back
for the strength of the pack
is the wolf
and the strength of the wolf
is the pack
soon
the rain ceased to fall
and the dry season arrived
heat crept through the jungle
turning it yellow
then brown
then black
but that year
was the driest season
that anyone could remember
even the mohwa didnt flower
my leaf
this is mine mine mine mine
theres a rock thats mud thats mud
theres a rock thats my rock
thats my rock
nobody touches my rock
theres another rock
two rocks three rocks
peace rock peace rock
its the truce the water truce
its the water truce
it had been
many many years
since the peace rock was revealed
and the water truce was called
hunting at the riverbank
was now forbidden
because by law of the jungle
drinking comes before eating
so you could come to the peace rock
on a day like this
and find all people sidebyside
dont forget
no hunting
playing only
playing only i got it ami
and remember
not everyone here has seen
a mancub in the jungle before
so behave yourself
okay can i go now
take the pups with you
wait for me
come on gray
oh take a look at this guy
excuse me
sorry
hes walking on two legs
dont stare
hey look a wild boar
and a rhino
and a mongoose
everybodys here
is that a peacock
ooh a stick
oh thats my stick
i like this stick
seriously thats my stick
this is my stick
no thats my stick
let go of my stick
its a water truce
its a water truce
sorry
my bad its involuntary
i could pee on it
watch yourself please
dad what is that
i think thats a mancub
whats a mancub doing here
whoa dont forget the truce
i know the law bucks
what is that
weird
thats weird
mowgli
what was the rule about your tricks
its not the wolf way
no more tricks
chin up little one
well make you a fine wolf yet
what about me
am i gonna be a fine wolf
look at me howl
in some packs the runt gets eaten
oh
mowgli behind me
dont leave my side
everyone comes to peace rock
so many smells to catch up on
but um
i cant help but notice
theres this strange odour today
what is it this scent that im on
i almost
i almost think it was some kind of
mancub
mowgli belongs
to my pack shere khan
mowgli
theyve given it a name
when was it we came to adopt
man into the jungle
hes just a cub
does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do
shift your hunting ground
for a few years
and everyone forgets
how the law works
well let me remind you
a mancub becomes man
and man is forbidden
what do you know about law
raksha
hunting for pleasure killing for power
youve never known law
the cub is mine
mine to me
so go back to where you came from
you burned beast
the tiger knows who rules
this part of the jungle
im sure he doesnt mean to come here
and make threats
especially during a water truce
no im deeply respectful of these laws
that keep us safe
so heres my promise
nothing lasts forever
the rains will return
and the river will rise
and when this rock disappears
that truce will end
you want to protect him fine
but ask yourselves
how many lives is a mancub worth
how many lives
who could answer that question
the rain
rain
rain
the rain
keep it dry keep it dry keep it dry
these quills
get stuck on everything
when the rains returned
it was a question
the council had to face
they deliberated and they argued
for many days
what do you think theyre talking about
no one had ever
come between the pack before
but shere khans threat
was not to be ignored
mowgli youre not supposed
to go up there
hes got to go
look at the skies
shere khan may be heading here
as we speak
please
im leaving
i dont want to see anyone get hurt
mowgli go back to the den
a mancub belongs with man
we raised him as one of our own
hell have the boy either way
akela
maybe i can be of help
the boys right
maybe its time he found another people
no
im the one who brought him to you
and now ill return him
to where he belongs
i wont let you
hes my cub
we knew this day would come
we are the only family hes ever known
raksha
its the only place hell be safe
its okay ami
i wont go far
ill come back and visit
never forget this
youre mine
mine to me
no matter where you go
or what they may call you
you will always be
my son
i wish i could tell you
that the wolves
couldve fought shere khan
but this is not that kind of a tale
the turtles like me
maybe the crocodiles
what about the rhinos
they always let me hang around
of course the rhinos sleep standing up
i dont think id be very good at that
its either the turtles or the crocodiles
which one do you think is better
neither
what do you mean
im bringing you to the man village
what
bagheera i dont know man
you will
you always said
were not supposed
to go near a man village
that was different
why is it different
you always said stay away
from the man village
because you might fall in a trap
or get eaten
or get hurt by flying rocks
i know what i said
whoa elephants
bow your head
why
show them respect
the elephants
created this jungle
where they made furrows
with their tusks
the rivers ran
where they blew with
their trunks the leaves fell
they made all that belongs
the mountains the trees
the birds in the trees
but they did not make you
that is why you must go
what if i live with the nilgai
no
or the mongoose
this is not a discussion
but this is my home
i dont even know what mans like
youll learn
but i wanna stay in the jungle
why do i have to go there
because the jungle
is no longer safe for you
youre being hunted
by a tiger
only man can protect you now
whoa
this isnt fair
youre not giving me a choice
theres a lot of stuff
youre not telling me too
dont think i didnt notice
you say youre taking me
where i came from
but you found me in the jungle
are you bringing me back
to the jungle no
why are you bringing me
to the man village
if you found me in the jungle
and why does the tiger
hate me so much
does he know me
sure seems like he knows me
down
what now we have to bow
to the buffalo too
listen to me this is not a game
youre gonna run to that ravine
what are you talking about
go to the north
where the sky glows at night
ill find you on that path
bagheera im not taking one
more step until you tell me
run mowgli
run
gray whats wrong
why dont you come outside and play
what is that
why did he have to leave
gray
we couldve protected him
we shouldnt have let him go
i miss him too
whats important is hes safe now
get inside
i suppose you know why ive come
the mancub has left the jungle
i thought i made myself clear
i wanted him turned over to me
we no longer harbour him
he has left the pack
and where may i ask has he gone
hes with his own kind now
so the mancub has left the jungle
thats right
you and i no longer have a quarrel
and most importantly
we have peace
i guess its done then
unless i can draw him
back out
akela
have i got your attention now
i didnt want it to be this way
i made it so simple
all i asked for was one thing
and you denied me
that ends now
spread the word
until i have the mancub
these hills are my hills
you did not respond to reason
so now you will know fear
bagheera
hmm
hey there
do you have a language
youre kind of cute i guess
you want a bite
come on
come here come on its all right
dont be afraid
come on
hey those are mine
hey come back
those are mine
drop it
hello
whos out there
hi little cub
oh no dont be scared
im not gonna hurt you
i was just passing through
i dont want any trouble
theres no trouble
are you alone out here
mmm thats not good

he should be here soon
i can stay with you
until he gets here

so deep in the jungle
this is my home
dont you know what you are
i know what you are
i know where you came from

yes
would you like to see
yeah
mostly men stay in their village
far from the dark of the jungle
but sometimes
they travel
and when they do
their caves breathe in the dark
they call it
the red flower
mans creation
it brings warmth and light
and destruction to all that it touches
who is that
the traveller protecting his cub
shere khan ended
the mans life that night
but not before he was burned
by the red flowers touch
he ran so fast he didnt
notice the cub he left behind
and that cub
was you
the panther found you
oh you poor sweet thing

these next couple of weeks
on account of the hibernation
i could really use your help
you know if you stuck around

uh
for what reason man village
i dont have a choice
theres a tiger hunting me
really why a tiger
because im a mancub all right
just leave me alone
hey mowgli my friend
my buddy my pal
slow down a second handsome
bagheera said i have to go
to the man village
oh bagheera i know him sure
you know what his problem is
he always plays by the rules
and sometimes rules
were meant to be
well not necessarily broken
but certainly bent
and definitely reinterpreted
dont you think
he told me to go to the man village
so thats where im gonna go
okay fine
you wanna go to the man village
have it your way
in fact ill do you one better
ill take you there myself
come on lets go its getting late
bare necessities
forget about
your worries and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
whats that
thats a song about the good life
whats a song
you never
heard a song before
everyones got a song
didnt the wolves ever sing
i dont know
uh oh
we recited the law of the jungle
this is the law of the jungle
as old and as true as the sky
the wolf that keeps it may prosper
but the wolf that breaks it will die
kid thats not a song
thats propaganda
whats propaganda
just a little farther
thats the man village
yep you can always
tell by the red flower
they do love their red flower
the red flower doesnt seem so bad
yeah
let it loose and it destroys
everything it touches
dont ever play with it
you got that
yeah i got it
good
do you think thats where im from
could be
i dont know kid does it look familiar
i dont remember it
all i remember is living with the wolves
why do you wanna go there
bagheera said i need a people
again with the listening to bagheera
hey hes my friend okay
now i dont even know where he is
i cant believe im leaving
the jungle for good
may i say just one thing
what i saw you do today
ive never seen anything like it
ive been trying to get
that honey for years
but i used my tricks
what tricks
you know
everything that i built
its not the wolf way
who cares the wolf way
thats the mowgli way
thats the baloo way
thats our way
thats how we get things done
i cant even imagine what kind
of potential youd have
if you had somebody like me
helping you out
you say you want to go
to the man village
i say you could be a man right here
ill tell you what
now you know where the man village is
you can always go down there
whenever you want
but i would personally appreciate it
as a personal favour to me personally
if we just worked together
just us tricks and all
i think it would be interesting to see
just how much honey
we could accumulate
before winter
whatever i could do to make
your trickiness happen
i will do
and if it turns out to
not be fun for you
i will walk you right down
to that man village myself
is that a deal
just till winter
just till winter
ami wake up
pups
theyre up there
the deer of course
take comfort in numbers
they lack defences
most animals will have
and if were being honest
theyre not very smart either
unlike the mother crocodile
who is a good deal more clever
but the one you have to watch out for
is the cuckoo bird
do you know
how the cuckoo bird survives
by preying on a mothers weakness
the cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young
instead it sneaks
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds
so when they hatch
the mother bird is fooled
she feeds them nurtures them
and do you know what happens
to her own chicks
they starve
and die
from neglect
all because a mother loved a chick
that wasnt her own
come now time for sleep
i think they like me
why are you doing this
hes gone
isnt that what you wanted
i want him dead
once he gets word
of what happened here
hell come back
and ill be waiting
thats the first mark
got it
thats the first mark
got it
thats the first mark
got it
whoo
yeah i got it
tell him to go to the second mark
got it
go to the second mark
got it
got it
look for the
bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother natures recipes
that bring the bare
necessities of life
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldnt be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing
in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look under
the rocks and plants
and take a glance at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
the bare necessities of life
theyll come to you
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldnt be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look
under the rocks and plants
and then take a glance
at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
mmm mmm
the bare necessities of life
theyll come to you
they will come to you
yeah theyll come to you
come to you
baloo baloo baloo look
stay low on my back
come on out and show yourself
bagheera ah
mowgli
oh i was looking everywhere for you
i thought you were gone

i cant believe you found me
i was so worried about you
i was lost and i didnt know
what happened
but then i met baloo
and then he saved me
from a giant snake
and now were working together

thats a new wrinkle
i didnt know sloth bears worked
come on mowgli lets be on our way

them longer and stronger

have you lost your mind
you said you wouldnt get mad
did you listen to anything
akela taught you
theres no place
in the jungle for these
tricks
you want to do this
you do this in the man village
but im helping baloo
get ready for hibernation
bears dont hibernate in a jungle
what are you teaching him
not full hibernation but i nap a lot
listen to me you con artist
he may not know your game but i do

you gotta let him be what he is
you dont understand
the boys in danger
i know he told me
hes being hunted by a tiger
not any tiger shere khan
shere khans hunting him
oh
but if you send him back
to the man village
theyll ruin him
theyll make a man out of him
we should send him back
to the wolf pack
whos their alpha
akela he can protect him
akela is dead
what
shere khan killed him
he will stop at nothing
until he has this boy
nothing
the only way we can save him
is if he goes to that man village

what you did back there
bagheera didnt think so
oh no i talked to him

now you have nothing
no claws no fur no teeth
and no friends
this is the law of the jungle
as old and as true as the sky

the wolf that keeps it may prosper
but the wolf
that breaks it will die
you fools
like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk
the law runneth over and back

between me and the mancub
and the strength
of the wolf is the pack

look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
old mother natures recipes
that bring the bare
necessities of life
wherever i wander
wherever i roam
i couldnt be fonder
of my big home
the bees are buzzing
in the tree
to make some honey just for me
when you look under
the rocks and plants
and take a glance at them fancy ants
and then maybe try a few
the bare necessities of life
theyll come to you
look for the bare necessities
the simple bare necessities
forget about your worries
and your strife
i mean the bare necessities
thats why a bear can rest at ease
with just the bare necessities of life
so just relax
in my backyard
if you act like that bee acts
youre working too hard
dont spend your time
just looking around
for something you want
that cant be found
when you find out
you can live without it
and go along not thinking about it
ill tell you something true
the bare necessities of life
the bare necessities of life
will come to you
water air love
house with a roof above
talking bout the bare
necessities of life
wisdom understanding sleep
good health
is something you must keep
