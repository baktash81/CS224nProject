where the dance dance dances
are popping
theirs are flowing like wine
i wanna swing
swing till daylight with you
i wanna dance   
to look at us   
you would think
that we ve got it all together

to my wife this morning   
that if i died and came back   
that i would want
to come back as me 
no  truly it is an honor   
to receive the jacob frienstein
attorney of the year award 
its especially
an honor because   
he is so into appearances

on the outside   
can be a totally different
matter on the inside

that i could have done
any of this

to pick up the pieces
of my life 
lord have mercy 
i was 39 years old
when you were born 
i never ever dreamed
i d have children 
and then here you come   
sweet bundle of joy 
but what did i do 
i think i shielded you
way too much 
now you got to get out there   
try to stand
on your own two feet 
oh  no  mama 
i can t do that 
i m not strong like you

you got the strength
god gave us women to survive 
you just ain t
tapped into it yet 
come here 
come on 
come on now 
oh   
just let it go 
nothing wrong with
shedding a few tears 
it cleanses the soul 
you know  you need
to stop thinking   
about what you think
you lost   
and look forward
to what there is to gain 
its a new life  baby 
its right in front of you 
all you got to do
is reach out and grab it 
how do i do that  mama  how 
by waking up every morning   
and thanking god that you did 
and then ask him to help you 
just ask the savior to help you

but i do 
some people say 
 one day at a time

dear diary 
today was a bad day 
i got up and came to church
because i was so angry 
when i think
about all the blood   
and sweat and tears
i put into my marriage   
it makes me want to hate him 
let me tell you something  boss 
i paid you a lot of money 
and that judge  he ain t down 
the judge had no choice   
but to allow the videotape
into evidence 
i told you
to make this go away 
say it wasn t me 
i wasn t there 
how the hell do you
use self defense 
you re on videotape 
and it will be
very hard to explain   
you not being there
at the time of the murder 
self defense is our only option 
then put me on the stand 
i ll say it wasn t me 
then all your priors
come into play 
look  mr  jackson 
you have to let me work here 
look  man  you can get me off 
make this go away 
look  i said
i would do all i can 
well  that better be
a hell of a lot  brother 
or i will do all i can 
wait a minute 
are you threatening   
ain t nobody talking to you 
i done paid you a lot of money 
you know how it is
on the streets  chuck 
brother don t do what he say 
however you and your homeys
settle your disputes   
this has to play out in court 
  lf i go down  man   
  lf you go down 
kalvin  walk away 
walk away 
don t let this suit fool you 
i don t take too kindly
to threats  mr  jackson 
and i don t make
idle threats  mr  mccarter 
i better get off

dear diary   
i m beginning to find my way 
its been close to
three months   
and every day
gets a little easier 
even though we re still
battling charles in court   
i don t even give it
that much energy anymore 
i don t understand this 
but its strange   
how little can be so much
when you re happy 
i find myself
smiling and laughing   
more than i ever have 
i find myself   
wait a minute  thats it 
i m finding myself 
its nights like this
i wish i had a car   
or kept that u haul truck
a few more days

a few of us nice guys around

a lot   
and she s taught herself
how to be tough   
real tough 
but  you know  the key
is to be tough  not hard 
and how would you know
what the key is 
lets just say
i had to learn it  too 
is that what you tell
all your women

i ve been happily single
ever since
