this week is being honored
by the city of atlanta
as the jacob frienstein
attorney of the year
i am so proud of him
he has worked so hard
i wanna swing
swing till daylight
with you
i wanna dance
dance the whole night through
where the beatbeatbeat
is jumping
and the crowd is feeling fine
where the dancedancedances
are popping
theirs are flowing like wine
i wanna swing
swing till daylight with you
i wanna dance
to look at us
you would think
that weve got it all together
but looks can be deceiving
some days are good
and i think he loves me
then other days
i think he doesnt care
dancing till daylight
just us two
kicking up my heels
i never thought
id see this day
i was just saying
to my wife this morning
that if i died and came back
that i would want
to come back as me
no truly it is an honor
to receive the jacob frienstein
attorney of the year award
its especially
an honor because
he is so into appearances
what looks one way
on the outside
can be a totally different
matter on the inside
there is no way
no way
that i could have done
any of this
without my wonderful wife
of 18 years
i dont know this stranger

all i know is that with
every dime and every case
he has changed

how the hell do you
use selfdefense
youre on videotape
and it will be
very hard to explain
you not being there
at the time of the murder
selfdefense is our only option
