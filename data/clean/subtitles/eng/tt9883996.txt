mam 
  are you all right 
  i m fine  love 
i just knelt down
to try and light the fire 
couldn t get up again 
as i was here 
i thought i d have a little sit down 
oh  quite comfy 
really 
she looked
a goner to me 
if i d tried
to get her up 
i d have ended up
on the floor myself 
so i said 
 best get jan  
and i said   don t bother her 
she ll be at tesco s  
co op  mam  i work at the co op 
and how many times have i told
you to leave the fire to me 
i hate for you to feel you
have to do everything for us 
rubbish 
all she s got
is that useless lump  brian 
to look after 
she hasn t even got
the pigeons anymore 
besides  what s a daughter for if it s
not to look after her mam and dad 
i told you before  son  if you
lived closer i could do it
and you wouldn t need
to pay for a babysitter 
all right  bye bye 
state of my parents 
dad calls 
said mam s had a fall 
dashed round
thinking she d had a stroke 
  she all right 
  yeah  she s just had another funny turn 
it d be so much easier
if they moved in here with us 
we got the room now dennis
and sasha have flown the nest 
i know you and dad under the same roof
might not be a bed of roses  but   
didn t use a glove in my day 
it was just spit  rub and shove 
there was that time i lost
my watch up there  mind 
brian 
i ve won
the euromillions 
i m having an affair
with john the post 
absolutely bloody clueless 
  i m leaving you  brian 
  i ve seen it all now 
what s for tea  love 
i nearly
crashed my car earlier 
those wild ponies are down
off the mountain again 
aye  lured by chips
and curry sauce 
cheer up  gerwyn 
might never happen 
you mean you paying your bar tab 
i d already drawn that conclusion 
no more credit 
i m telling you  boys 
our horse  sweet gemma 
was in the race of her life 
and you know what gave her
the edge  her good breeding 
bona fide
thoroughbred she was 
coming round the far
bend  she s still going well 
she s about four lengths
clear of the third horse 
i m already running
down to the front 
and then i
lose sight of her 
i think she s gone down 
my horse has fallen 
and so i panic  and i m fighting
my way down to the track 
and there she is  sweet gemma 
giving it everything she s got 
and she comes through
on the outside and wins 
  i duck under the rails   
  totally illegal 
totally illegal  and i run
across the track to congratulate her 
she was my horse 
and she won 
haven t seen him
in here before 
you gotta dream big 
howard davies 
accountant type 
used to drink
up the cross keys 
started coming in here
thursdays after squash 
owns a racehorse  does he 
owned  part of a syndicate 
till it all went tits up 
  what happened 
  he doesn t like to talk about that bit 
oh  aye

lost everything 
pile of cash 
house  missus 
bitter s gone 
who s having
one more  before we go 
six stella  please 
  howard  is it 
  that s right 
owned a racehorse 
i gather 
couldn t help overhearing 
  must be an expensive business 
  what 
to buy one 
well  let s see 
sheikh omari just shelled out
16 million for french over 
winner of
the welsh grand national 
mind you  that was dollars 
not pounds 
so it s more affordable
than you think 
bring them over
can you  please  thanks 
you ve got arms 
haven t you 
gerwyn said
to put it on my slate 
there s a spillage
in aisle six 
it looks like
chicken korma 
  what s for tea  love 
  just starting on it now 
hello 
you are not
gonna believe this 
the goat s
got ringworm 
and now this duck has got
bumblefoot like the others 
here  this fella s making a complete
balls up of castrating this alpaca 
it s a two man job  see 
one to hold him down by the legs and
the other to nip off the squealers 
could you turn that off

i m sure 
but there s this fella
that comes in the club 
  what fella 
  howard  bit arrogant 
but he s an expert 
and i m hoping he ll help 
it s absolute madness 
i mean  to even think
of breeding a racehorse 
you re gonna need to buy
a thoroughbred mare 
where you gonna get
one of those 
 retired pedigree racehorse
for brood mare

vet s charges 
stabling  insurance 
and that s all before it starts racing 
if it ever does 
but i read up about it

things  isn t there 
we set up a syndicate 
 cause if  say 
20 people in the village
put in a tenner a week
for two years 
i mean  i know
it s complicated  but   
yeah  it is 
but most people in the village
haven t got two beans
to rub together 
it s normally wealthy  professional
men who go in for this kind of thing 
bring them over 
would you 
i wasn t asking for
your help  anyway 
  sounds good  
  i saw the smile
on your face  
  and the look in your eye  
  when you pass by to me  
  what you don t realize  
  that i m hurt deep inside  
right 
and that s what i m doing 
i m going to kick you out 
  you said that
i don t need you  
  i want you
more than need you  
don t judge me  jan 
they re my only solace 
have a look at that 
  when i dream  it s of you  
what do you think 
sorry  jan 
no call for it these days 
not since that scandal
with the lasagna 
happily take those geese
off your hands  mind 
dead or alive 
  i m holding on to a dream  
  yes  i am holding a dream  
  i m holding on to a dream
yes  i am  
the tax compliance
framework for sinclair beatty 
need that done by 3 00 
and i need this one done
by lunchtime 
it s that fella
from the club 
all right 
i  uh    i thought maybe i
was a bit hasty in the club 
lucky i ve got
thick skin  then 
this is brian 
but you can
call me daisy 
oh 
just as i thought  having to beat
them back at the door  are you 
very funny  gerwyn 
well  jan  no one can say
you didn t try  love 
one more minute  brian 
your missus know
you re doing this  howard 
no danger of losing your house
with this non starter 
oh 
evening  all  gerwyn 
i m fully briefed and ready to
assess the viability of this venture 
maureen 
glad you could make it 
nothing on the telly 
i just gotta say 
i know absolutely sod all
about racehorses 
that s all right  maureen 
i ve done the research for all of us 
  well  well 
  hi  goose 
  all right 
  have a seat 
  goose  is it 
  yeah 
  howard 
  nice to meet you 
  goose 
  maldwyn 
i d have been in sooner 
only i had to de gunge the mincer 
you can t mix your meats 
take a seat  nerys 
sorry  howard 
got totally lost  mate 
hello  peter 
daisy 
bloody satnav tried to
send us into the lake 
oh  they will do that  yes 
peter and gordon 
mates from work 
and this is kev 
he s my neighbor 
right 
welcome  everyone 
let s crack on 
ha 
god s sake 
if you lot are good enough
to own a bloody racehorse 
so am i 
  it s a tenner every week  kerby  you pillock 
  oh 
so   
the purpose of this meeting   
brian  have you got 50p 
where s the
organization in this place 
there you go  love 
no one touch my tenner 
  oh  yes 
  there you go  bob s your uncle 
not sure
i understood that last point 
i m sorry  i m sorry  i still
don t quite understand 
jan is the owner
of the mother  yes 
when the foal is born 
then everyone will be the owners 
we ll all have
an equal share 
so  who would take
the critical decisions 
which critical decisions 
the horse s diet  for example 
look here 
 racehorses should be given a
high energy feed rich in nutrients 
excess consumption of grass may
lead to colic and flatulence  
we ll have enough of that with kerby 
but this foal doesn t exist yet 
so who s the daddy 
bien bien  he s called 
american 
ten year old  won 2 3 million
dollars before he retired 
they wanted three grand stud fee 
but i knocked them right down 
  which we will pay 
  gonna rob a bank  are you  daisy 
which we will pay
out of our retirement fund 
until the syndicate is up and
running and can reimburse us 
one thing
i must stress  above all else 
if you do join  don t do it
expecting to make money 
there s a less than one percent chance
this horse will ever win a race 
so  do it for the  hwyl  
that s what this is all about 
you mean like 
the  craic  
with respect  the  hwyl  is
not the same as the  craic  
the  craic 
is a gaelic term 
whereas the  hwyl  comes
from the brythonic branch
of the celtic languages
and means  a feeling
of emotional motivation
and energy  
right 
i ll do it
for the  hwyl  
of course i will 
yeah  go on 
we ll both do it for the   
  what s it called again 
  the  hwyl  
english 
yeah 
in 
  yes 
  yeah  me too 
in 
gerwyn 
well   
if there s gonna be
a circus in town 
may as well have
a ringside seat 
mrs  vokes 
  i m james 
  sorry we re late 
oh  that s all right 
this won t take long 
bien bien
doesn t mess about 
oh  god 
he s handsome  though 
and this is rewbell 
i m not gonna lie  one of us has
left a present in the corner 
come on then  girl 
what do you think 
here we go  yeah 
well  bien bien is known to
upgrade his mares 
  go get him  girl 
  brian 
we should have watched 
would you like
to be watched 
i m not a stallion 
you can
say that again 
i ve had my moments 
haven t i 
still  having a bit of fun
now  aren t we 
never knew how much i missed
messing about with horses 
it s more than  a bit of fun 
and  messing about   brian

to when i get up in the morning

  excellent  enjoy it 
a little tip
before the race 
ah  go on 
if you re using the gents 
give the first cubicle
a few minutes 
and
the horses for the bumper race
are making their way
to the paddock 
  here we go 
  we re up next 
  everyone got your bets on 
  yeah 
wait  we must have a toast 
that s right 
to us 
to us 
to dream 
to dream 
come on 
we re
moving on here at chepstow 
the conditions are good 
so we should have
quite a tussle
in this race for beginners 
jockeys are mounting and they re
making their way down to the start 
so  he s there  he s up on
the big screen  there he is 
oh  look  there he is 
they re all on the racecourse
and should be good to go 
horses are circling
at the starting line 
number six  inarco 
in the purple and orange 
dream alliance  number three 
in the red and white 
and forgive me mary 
an impressive winner at kelso 
a bit reluctant to join the others
at this stage is dream alliance 
he s become a bit playful
down at the start 
oh  god 
tapes are across 
starter s getting up there 
perhaps they ll have to
go around again and walk in 
hopefully with dream alliance 
he doesn t look happy 
his first race 
bound to be a bit edgy 
edgy  he s facing
the wrong way 
let s see if he settles down 
if he keeps going in that direction 
he ll end up back in the village 
  they are under orders 
  turn around  boy 
dream alliance still having
a bit of bother 
  will he let them go 
  turn him around 
turn him around 
he s at the back  look 
he can t let them go  can he 
turn around  come on 
turn around  man 
they ve all gone 
he ll be in front
if he waits for
the next race to start 
come on 
it s a disastrous start
for dream alliance 
he s about ten lengths
behind the pack 
i hope you re gonna
give us a refund  jan 
come on  dream  boy 
  come on 
  he s miles behind the others 
then on the inside 
forgive me mary 
and still trailing by six 
possibly eight lengths 
is dream alliance looking very
green at the back of the pack 
even daisy could run faster 
it was fun
while it lasted 
come on  dreamy boy 
you can do it 
mate  what a waste of money 
inarco and forgive me mary
in the middle of the field 
look at him now 
he s found the accelerator 
clawing back some ground
is dream alliance 
he s our boy 
come on  lad 
come on  my boy 
he s coming  he s coming 
dream alliance pushes forward 
and he s on inarco s heels now 
and as cornell goes for broke 
penelope star in second 
inarco slips back 
go on  dream 
dream alliance battles
his way into fourth 
go on  dream 
come on  dream 
dream alliance
making a real challenge
to get amongst
the top three 
come on 
cornell takes it 
second penelope star 
high and clear in third 
and dream alliance coming in
a strong fourth place 
fourth  fourth  fourth

  congratulations 
  thank you 
bad luck about your
fearless pursuit  butt 
has it occurred to you this might
be time to take a tidy profit 
how do you mean 
i m prepared to make
a substantial offer 
oh  god 
i d never sell him  never 
you haven t
heard the offer yet 
i wouldn t sell him
for 500 million 
well  if you change
your mind 
hang on a minute 
that s not right 
what  the idea
of selling dream 
no  it s bloody
ridiculous 
no  i mean him offering
to buy him off jan 
the horse belongs
to all of us 
correct  any financial offer
should be put formally
to the syndicate
for consideration 
we re not selling him
and that s that 
with respect  jan 
that s not for you to say 
are you deaf 
gerwyn  or what 
she s just bloody said it 
legally she has
no right to 
but morally
she has every right 
surely we can
all agree about that 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
come on  boys 
let s just celebrate our win 
  dreams can come true look at
me  babe i m with you  
  you know
you ve got to have hope  
oi  rossi 
feet off the chairs 
it s absolute pandemonium in here 
i don t recognize half this lot 
i know  once upon a time 
people didn t even want to admit
they came from this village 
now half the valleys
reckon they live here 
how much do you reckon lord snooty
would have offered us for dream 
tens  maybe hundreds
of thousands 
thanks for standing up
for me before 
that s okay 
we both know
this has always been about
something much more
important than money 
oh 
  i saw the light on the night
that i passed by her window  
  ba  da  da  da
da  da  da  
  i saw the flickering shadows
of love on her blinds  
  ba  da  da  da
da  da  da  
  she was my woman  
  ba  da  ba  da  ba  
  as she deceived me i watched
and went out of my mind  
  my  my  my delilah  
   e mail you sent yesterday
to sinclair beatty 
care to read it 
 just quit moaning
and pay up  you bastards  
they had a tax bill  i m a tax advisor 
i advised them to pay it 
you know  howard  i ve started to wonder
lately why you came into this profession 
oh  you re not
the only one 
 cause i have no idea why i
sit behind this desk all day 
helping rich bastards 
who can well afford to pay their share 
save millions in tax
while people out there can barely
afford to put food on their tables 
you know  it s   
legalized robbery 
howard  mate 
has to be something better
i can do with my life 
he s taking the lamp 
why is he taking the lamp 
resigned 
what were you thinking 
i wasn t thinking 
that s the whole point  i was just   
it s what i feel 
it s what i felt for years 
i can t do that job anymore 
this is that bloody horse
again  isn t it 
being involved with jan and
the syndicate has made me feel
like i m part of something important
for the first time in years 
and it s bloody fabulous 
it s selfish 
and it s reckless 
i can work it out 
we ll manage 
oh  how exactly 
on my wages 
so  i ve been talking to philip 
and he reckons dream s bouncing 
in the form of his life 
howard reckons it s partly that
new probiotic food they got him on 
and they ve got him in that
new equine swimming pool 
dream absolutely loves it 
apparently 
howard says swimming is brilliant
for building up muscle strength
in the hindquarters 
brian 
what s the matter 
nothing 
come on  spit it out 
i miss him  is all    dream 
it s stupid  isn t it  missing
something i didn t even know i wanted 
no  it s not stupid 
but still   
that s the way life is 
i shouldn t grumble 
but life s not like that  brian 
that s the whole point 
there s a whole world
out there you don t see
because you re just sat
watching the telly 
you what 
look  when dream arrived   
i saw you light up 
look  i know you miss him 
but don t just   
settle back into
your old ways again 
i shouldn t have said
anything 
i don t mind really 
i m happy enough 
no  brian  you re always  happy
enough   you lost your job 
you said   never mind  another one
will come along   and it never did 
you got arthritis  you said   oh  well 
we all get old and ill sooner or later  
i mean  when i first met you 
you were a fighter 
and now
you just accept things 
you don t fight anymore 
so  what your dad said
was right 
you could have done
a lot better for yourself 
so i can evade tax 
but i can t avoid it 
other way around  nerys 
avoid  not evade 
  evasion they don t like 
  got it  um   
things are a little tight
cash wise these days  so   
best sirloin 
  cheers  nerys 
  enjoy 
  oh  hello  nerys 
  jan 
whoo 
it s looking very smart 
howard 
well  the refurbishment
is  um  ongoing 
how come  though 
you had a good job in cardiff  didn t you 
uh  well  i realized
i couldn t do it anymore 
and i wasn t gonna live a life
of lost chances like my dad 
  what happened to him 
  uh   
ran away from home at 14 with a
dream of being a famous jockey 
lied about his age 
got a job at a racing stables 
the coppers tracked him
down  bought him home 
became a lifer
at the steelworks and   
that was that 
 don t let them crush your
dreams   he used to say 
and at least i ve had plenty of time to
keep on top of the syndicate finances 
believe it or not  we re showing an
overall profit of about a hundred grand 
good god 
i never in
a million years thought
we d make
this kind of money 
that s not
the only good news 
philip hobbs wants to race

attendance on the course

a three mile  half a furlong
handicap over hurdles

looking good 
all right  daisy 
tidy enough  thanks 
horses coming out onto the
course led by real charmer 
very much on his toes 
keen to get on with things 
alongside aurora s encore 
a winner here just two days ago 
dream alliance 
in his now familiar red and white colors 
is number three on your card 
and number one is according to pete 
come on  then  boy 
hey  he s looking good 
over there  look 
come on  dreamy 
starter is
calling them forward 
i ve got a good feeling
about this one 
come on  dream 
flag is up 
and they re off and racing 
so  the field leave the tapes
bunched together 
buena vista 
the first one to show   
take it easy 
good start 
dream alliance challenging
according to pete 
racing in
the blue and white colors 
currently in
the middle of the field 
come on  dreamy boy 
deep focus
edges past buena vista now 
while dream alliance
tries to make ground
on the outside
of according to pete 
deep focus is out of the race 
takes a pretty hefty fall 
horse and jockey look okay   
  is he up 
     and quickly on their feet 
come on  dream 
   as they approach
the next flight of hurdles 
dream alliance is jumping with real confidence now 
  come on  dream  come on  boy 
  he s up into third place 
chased hard
by both superior wisdom 
  and then comes aurora s encore 
  come on  dream 
come on  dream 
dream alliance now just
a length and a half behind 
dream alliance and according
to pete neck and neck 
nothing between these two
as they take the next 
and the field
head round the final bend 
buena vista continues
to lead the way 
according to pete
on his outside 
superior wisdom in third and
behind them aurora s encore 
where s dream 
i can t see him  either 
howard  can you
see anything 
he s not there 
  can you see him 
  oh  jesus 
oh  what s happening 
let me see 
they re putting screens
around him 
means they re gonna
shoot him  don t it 
stay calm  everyone 
the vet s arrived 
they can t shoot him 
if his leg s broken
they d have to  jan 
okay  i m calling philip 
what are they saying 
pick up  philip  pick up 
philip 
put him on speaker 
  philip  what s happening 
  they can t tell how bad it is 
but it looks like
he s severed a tendon 
that s serious  isn t it 
if confirmed 
then he d never run again 
  philip 
  yeah  hold on 
oh  please  god  we can t lose him 
we can t lose him  we can t 
it s kinder to put
a horse down immediately
in these circumstances 
you know 
whoa  stand clear 
hello  howard 
vet thinks the tendon
may not be
completely severed
and there s a chance
it could be repaired 
then try  for god s sake  if there s
the faintest chance of saving him 
i have to warn you 
if the tendon can t be repaired 
he d still have to be
euthanized 
  right  philip 
  and if we remove him from the course
and the operation
does fail 
you d lose
the insurance money
and  of course 
face substantial bills 
philip  we don t have time 
i really need an answer 
well  how much
is he insured for 
currently 
120 thousand pound 
maybe we need
to discuss this 
no  there s nothing to discuss 
what s there to discuss 
well  120 grand  to start with 
that s a hell of a lot of money 
look  he belongs
to all of us 
and any decision about
what happens to him
should be taken
collectively 
  it s a fair point 
  yeah  but   
like it should have been that day
lord avery offered to buy him 
you re not still on
about that  gerwyn 
  wait  listen 
  this is a syndicate  isn t it 
he s suffering and all alone 
everybody be quiet
and just listen to janet 
look  before dream   
who were we 
gerwyn 
kerby 
we lost our jobs 
our community 
even lost our pride 
and then dream came along
and reminded us all what life
is like when you have hope 
dream s out on that course
in agony 
his life hanging by a thread 
and you re talking about
putting a gun to his head
so you can have a couple
of grand in your pockets 
too bloody right 
dream s never asked us
for anything before 
  he s just given us his all 
  yeah 
dream has given me
a second chance 
he s given us all
a second chance 
and now   
i think we need to
give him one 
  fair enough 
  yeah 
hmm 
right 
philip 
tell them they gotta do whatever
they can to try and save him 
steady  steady  dream 
anything 
brian  i   
it s   
it s all right  girl 
dream s had an accident 
they ve been operating on him
through the night 
philip  what s the news 
i see 
right 
okay  thanks 
well 
we hope he ll be able
to walk again 
but you do understand 
the chances of him racing again
are virtually nonexistent 
all i care about
is he gets well 
and if the tendon
won t heal and he s lame 
well  then we ll have to
consider his quality of life 
aw 
hello 
god  dream 
you had me worried 
  i would not ask
a wish of you  
  it would only
bring you sorrow  
  turn my face from today  
  again until tomorrow  
  but i will walk
and i will run  
  you know
i m gonna have my fun  
  and i will stay
and i will pray  
  for you
you are my only one  
thank you 
mrs  davies 
angela 
i m jan 
from the syndicate 
oh  right 
hi 
how s howard 
haven t seen him in a while 
not since what happened
with dream 
yes  i heard 
i was  um  so sorry
about his accident 
thanks  he s alive 
that s the main thing 
yes 
well  i   
i just  um   
wanted to say i think
it s brilliant   
supporting howard the way you did
with the syndicate and everything 
i mean  after the last time 
a lot of wives wouldn t have done that 
it wasn t until he told me that
story about his dad running away
and becoming a jockey
that i really understood why
this mattered to him so much 
but i guess
you knew that all along 
yes 
well  thanks 
that s  18 90  please 
thanks 
  brian 
  listen  jan  it s your dad 
i m sorry  i ve called
an ambulance  but   
i m two minutes away 
well  there he is 
oh  good god 
you said he could walk 
but is he really up to being ridden 
oh  he s going
pretty well  isn t he 
well done  boy 
unbelievable 
my god 
  i swear he winked at me 
  it s miraculous 
the stem cell treatment
was a complete success 
the vet thinks
the tendon s stronger now
than before the injury 
he s running faster than ever 
how come you never mentioned
he was coming on so well 
didn t want to raise any false
hopes until we were sure 
of what 
we think he s ready
to race again 
  you re joking 
  we re thinking the welsh national 
  that would be incredible 
  but after all he s been through   
i need to be sure
it s what you want 
i can t bear the thought
of him risking his life again 
i just don t think we can take the risk 
not after all that s happened 
but it d be the comeback
of all comebacks 
that s rich  you were ready
to write him off 
  we d all written him off 
  you saw him on the gallops 
and you heard what philip hobbs said 
it s miraculous 
i mean  surely it s a sign 
dream wants to keep going 
  he lives to race 
  it s in his blood  innit 
out on that track 
when he was hurt 
you said we owed him a chance
because of what he d done for us 
what was that chance for if
not to let him race again 
but not at the welsh grand national 
it s too dangerous 
tell him  brian 
it s just too big a risk 
i would  jan 
but i can see
what they re saying 
how could you 
that s why i m single  see 
jan 
  i thought you cared about dream 
  i do 
of course i care about him 
when dream come along 
took me right back to when i was young 
wanting to be a farmer 
all those hopes
i d given up on 
and it hurt like hell when he
went to live at the stables 
almost as much as it hurt
when he fell at aintree 
you spoke for him then 
when he couldn t 
but if dream was here now
and he could speak   
   he d tell you
he wants to race 
it s in his blood 
you know i m right 
let him run  jan 
i just can t bear the thought
of him getting hurt again 
i know 
but you were right 
we can t stop ourselves from
dreaming of bigger things 
come on  love 
come on 
there you go 
see ya 
hey  kerby 
where s your glad rags 
you better get a shift on 
mate  or you ll miss the coach 
i m not going 
can t afford it  butt 
you gotta come 
come  we ll have a whip round 
bugger off  i ll put the money
i m saving by not going on dream 
twenty quid 
dream alliance to win 
i ll watch it in the club
with a pint in my hand 
now  you tell our boy
to run the race of his life 
right  i m off 
why are you all   
we thought we might come along  too 
what the hell is that 
what do you reckon 
angela and the kids in there 
howard  you re lying down in the hearse 
i couldn t fit you all in the coach 
we had to think laterally 
  come on  follow me 
  in you go  love

 cause you didn t go to bed  
  you were watching the whites
of your eyes turn red

  at break of day when that
man drove away i was waiting

house and she opened the door  
  she stood there laughing

in my hand  
  and she laughed no more
