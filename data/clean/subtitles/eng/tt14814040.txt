you just wake up every day thinking 
 i want to be seen  
to be completely honest  danni sanders
might actually be the worst person
we ve ever covered on this show 
and we covered hitler 
 danni  i wanna be important 
 contributor  okay  guys  today 
we re talking about white privilege 
so you know
we need to talk about danni sanders 
 acting like she was the victim 
i think that
that turned a lot of people off to her 
 danni  i wanna have purpose 
so i was just gonna bleach the front bits 
but i m really not trying to get mistaken
for danni sanders 
 danni  i wanna be known 
i wanna be loved 
 presenter 1  and the award
for most anticipated death 
   presenter 2  danni sanders 
  i can t wait for her to kick the bucket 
   presenter 2  don t   
  in fact  i ll do it for you 
   mimics gunshot 
  that s a little far 
i m not gonna go that far  it s a fine 
not for me  i own guns 
 danni  i wanna matter 
 explosion 
yeah  well  let me tell you 
be careful what you fucking wish for 
 singer    i m the worst  
  you re gonna hate me  
  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  
  i m the worst  
okay 
 clears throat 
  danni 
  yeah 
had a chance to read
that article you sent me 
  you did 
  mm hmm 
what did you think 
well  you ve titled it   why am i so sad  
that s just a working title 
 in a world surrounded by those
who seem to have it all 
i ve settled on a few reasons
for my own feelings of emptiness 
the first is that
i currently live in bushwick  
j train bushwick 
l train bushwick would be fine 
just  like  somewhere you can get
a decent match a  you know 
 reason number two 
my lack of a private office at work  
open concept spaces
really drown out my inner voice 
finally 
and this one really stuck with me 
okay 
 missing 9 11  
yeah 
i was on a cruise with my parents
when it happened 
in general  i think we try to avoid
expressing any kind of fomo about 9 11 
 sighs 
did you read that article on the cut 
the one   
it talked about how it was the single
most formative trauma experience
for  zillennials  
and since i wasn t there 
i didn t get to share that bond
with my peers 
you know  like 
i didn t even know anyone that died 
okay  and you don t feel like it comes off
a little tone deaf  offensive even 
  can t tone deaf be  like  a brand though 
  oh  no 
  isn t that what lena dunham does 
  you don t wanna be like lena dunham 
i don t feel like
you take me seriously as a writer 
that s because you re not a writer 
you re a photo editor 
one who s very late on their deadlines 
deadlines that should take priority
over personal goals 
i ve just been having
a difficult time focusing lately 
and i ve been having a difficult time
ending this conversation  and we re done 
okay 
gonna load up
the head space app after that

danni 
i have to be honest 
i don t even know what to say

i can t even fathom
what you ve been through 
and i don t want you to feel pressure
to come back to work right away 
no  really  i wanna be here 
if you re sure  but you set the pace 
if you need to leave early 
take a mental health day 
you don t even have to ask  just go 
  i will 
  and  danni   
i know we ve had our conflicts 
and i m so sorry
i was ever gonna fire you 
but i want you to know 
  the fact that you re standing right here 
  you were gonna fire me 
 in front of me instead of being
curled up in a ball somewhere 
mainlining gummy worms 
which is what i would have been doing 
that s incredible 
you are so strong 
isn t she so strong  everybody 
   colleague  yeah 
   susan  mm hmm

i was thinking  um 
maybe writing a piece about my experience 
it    it might help me
work through the pain 
of course  depravity would be honored
to give you a platform 
all right 
 sighs 
so  it was a totally normal day at first 
it was sunny  it was clear 
i was at the arc having
a cute little  quiet morning to myself 
before i went to breakfast
with the other writers 
and i don t know 
i saw this weird guy in this big jacket 
then suddenly 
i was hit with this feeling 
like something horrible was gonna happen 
oh  jesus 
i knew i needed to leave 
so i turned around to go 
and as i was walking away 
  boom 
   all gasp 
that s when it hit 
so you re a psychic 
like the lady of galadhrim 
or it was god 
excuse me 
this is a non denominational workspace

 chuckles  ha 
 danni  my name is danni sanders 
and on april 10th  i almost died 
but something  or someone  saved me 
maybe it was a guardian angel 
or god  or alan rick man s ghost 
but i don t think that i believe
in any of that 
more likely  it was me who saved me 
not that i believe in myself either 
but if all of this
has taught me something 
 chuckles 
 it s that maybe i should 
oh  my god 
this is me  exclamation mark 
 intermittent buzzing 
 ghostly voice  neuf 
 phone vibrates repeatedly 
  i will never forget what i saw that day 
   guinea pig squeaks 
what did i see that day 
okay  survivor of bombing 
ew 
oh  my god 
that s good  that s a good idea 
  hello 
  hey  mom  hi  mom 
  how are you  danni 
  hi  mom  yeah 
  no  i just had a quick question 
  uh huh 
what   
do you remember what the name
of the support group is
that helen s husband used to go to 
 survivor 1   and the sounds were coming 
like  30 seconds apart 
i m sure it was just
a wheel on the tracks 
everyone else was just  you know  annoyed 
i physically started shaking 
i got off the train 
i just walked uptown from canal 
i mean  i felt like such an idiot 
and i was late 
  i was not getting back on that train 
   chuckles 
 leader 
loud noises can be very triggering 
i think a lot of us struggled with that 
 survivor 2  i make my kids mute
the tv when they re gaming 
they hate it 
but i can t get any work done
when i m hearing gunfire
or    or explosions 
you let your kids play those 
you don t think that s normalizing
a culture that glorifies gun violence 
okay  why don t we all just take a second
and welcome our new addition 
hi 
hi 
   leader  what s your name 
  danni 
i was in paris last week
when the bombings hit at the arc 
oh  i am so sorry  do you   
do you wanna share anything about how
you re    you re feeling  or your thoughts 
oh   chuckles 
i was just hoping to listen today 
of course  of course  danni 
in your own time 
we re all survivors here 
charles  why don t you speak for a bit 
charles is one of our newer members 
he just returned from the uk 
he s also a bombing survivor 
he was at the ariana grande concert 
look  it s not easy 
okay 
i mean  it s been years for me 
and i still have to talk
about it every week 
i m sorry  that s not comforting  um 
it s not like   
your life doesn t end  okay 
i know that it probably feels
like that right now 
it s just 
everything changes colors 
yes  that s    exactly 
i never would have thought
to put it like that 
what is it for you 
maybe purple 
what s yours 
red 
it s like everything is red forever 
and on one hand 
it s really vivid and intense 
but on the other 
everything feels completely 
monochrome 
you relate to that  danni 
i just   
sort of understand the monochrome bit 
that s how everything is for me too 
but mine s like 
gray all the time 
and how does it feel
when the world looks that way to you 
i don t know 
doesn t really feel like anything 
just sort of numb 
ugh 
 chuckles 
see you next week 
yeah  i will 100  be back 
rowan  i am so sorry to do this to you 
but my daughter is such
a huge fan of yours 
would you mind taking a quick photo

 contributor 
today we re talking about rowan aldren 
a teen gun safety activist 
poet and social influencer 
after surviving the oak valley
school shooting in north carolina 
rowan came to new york to partner
with the we ve had enough organization
to begin her fight for gun reform 
here s a look 
 rowan  two miles 
you can be two miles from a gunshot
and still hear it 
that day 
even if you were nowhere near it 
i swear  you heard those bullets
loud enough to fear  em 
two miles 
but the 23 at my school
carried much farther 
maybe that s just how it sounds
when a child dies a martyr 
and yet  it was quiet 
quieter than it should have been 
we needed a riot
and all we got was a funeral hymn 
and someone saying   hey 
couldn t one of you have tackled him  
two miles  and yet not a word 
i look up at the people in power
and ask how thick are your walls
that you can t hear what i heard 
well  here  behind our walls 
our lives were taken turn by turn 
have we earned your sympathy yet  sir 
there is more than one person at fault
for what happened to us 
there is more than one person
who pulled the trigger on that gun 
and i have had enough 
enough pain  enough corruption 
enough death  enough destruction 
enough sleepless nights 
still watching my friends die 
enough of listening
to our politicians lie 
enough 
 crowd cheering 
 danni  hey 
  hey 
  that is such a cute hairpin  i m dead 
  oh  thank you  i made it myself 
  cool 
  so    no  you 
  so   
i was just gonna say thank you
for meeting me 
yeah  of course  of course 
how are you    how are you doing 
i m good  yeah 
  i mean  i m managing  i guess  yeah  but 
  yes 
do you have family around 
you know  like  in new york 
yeah  my dad cries
whenever he sees me now though 
and my mom keeps shipping me
wellness supplements
that she reads about on goop 
okay  um  well  what about your friends 
i mean  i m seeing you  right 
right 
so  you know 
hey  are you    are you cool
if we  maybe  walk somewhere 
  yeah 
  yeah 
 danni  that s a good idea 
 rowan  i m glad you reached out 
it s gonna be great to have someone
in group who s not  like  50 
oh  that s    no  i m   
i don t think i ll   
that was just  like 
a onetime thing for me  but   
the support group  why 
i don t know 
therapy never really worked for me 
it s not therapy  okay 
it s better  it s    it s family 
besides  i mean  who s gonna help me
explain tiktok references to the boomers 
is tiktok a    is it a topic
that comes up a lot in meetings 
  oh  you would be surprised 
   chuckles 
so  listen  i was kinda hoping i might
be able to get your advice on something 
full disclosure  i stalked you online 
that poetry you do  it s crazy 
it sounds just like hamilton 
yeah  it s    it s called spoken word 
cool  cool  cool  i m a writer too 
oh  cool 
yeah  and i actually have
this article due right now
for the magazine that i m working at 
and i feel really stuck 
like  i just   
i don t know if you could
give me any tips  or 
it s about what happened 
and i brought my laptop 
i don t know  we could hole up
at one of those little writer y cafés 
you could be my coach 
  sure 
  thank you  okay 
you know  actually 
i wanted to take you here first 
i think it could be super helpful 
before you write  you have to deal with
why you re feeling stuck 
  oh  okay  so    and then we ll go write 
  yeah  come on 
okay 
what is this place 
 rowan 
how do you feel about breaking things 
fuck the senate for not passing
that background check bill last week 
 panting 
now you try 
oh  um 
okay 
fuck the bombing in paris 
no  you re not mad enough  okay 
you have to feel it 
okay  what if i don t   
what if i don t feel angry 
all right  then what do you feel 
well  i don t know   scoffs 
numb 
still numb 
use that  smash the numbness 
 whispers  smash the numbness 
good  again 
yes  okay  you feel that 
keep going  let it out 
that s it  let it out 
yell if you want to 
fuck you 
 danni laughs 
 breathes heavily 
look  what you asked before   
that is how i write 
you have to attack it 
that is what s gonna make
people pay attention  okay 
no more scrolling past headlines 
no more distractions 
we do that with our truth 
if you re not okay  that s okay 
you know as    as fucked up as it sounds 
your pain is your biggest asset 
 grunts 
yeah 
 panting 
oh  my god 
okay 
i ll never forget what i saw that day 
but the truth is 
you don t need to hear it 
all you need to know is 
i am not okay 
what happened in paris changed me 
but what i ve realized since
is that my pain can actually be an asset 
it can stop you all
from scrolling past headlines 
distracting yourselves with baby goats
and shein ads and asmr videos 
it can make you pay attention
and  in turn  truly ask yourselves 
 am i okay  
am i okay 
 danni  now  my own sadness  my anger   
they may stem from something
more traumatic
than you ll ever experience 
but that doesn t mean
your pain isn t just as real 
yo 
 danni  it doesn t mean
you re not waking up every day
feeling numb and useless and alone 
i think a lot of us are 
so i wanna invite you 
take this opportunity to share your truth 
share your pain 
you ve got nothing to lose
and everything to gain 
let s make the world wake up
and pay attention
to the fact that we re all hurting 
and it s time to stop being so afraid 
we stan a fearless queen 
  hey  danni  booch 
  sure 
oh  my god  cheers 
cheers 
 colleagues chuckle 
so as blm and me too came before us 
let us usher in a new era of honesty
on the internet   i am not okay 
   alarm sounds 
   breathing heavily 
 school pa  this is a lockdown drill 
all students and teachers

danni  you had a big week 
 danni chuckles 
do you wanna talk a little
about how it felt
to publish such a personal piece 
uh 
honestly 
it s been amazing 
it s just so freeing
to finally admit that i am not okay 
and it s so crazy
to see all these celebrities
using my hashtag
to talk about their trauma 
did you see kendall jenner s post 
  you did 
  oh  yeah 
i had no idea
that she was so discriminated against 
you always hear these horror stories
of people in the spotlight
getting all this hate  but i don t know 
doesn t seem to be happening to me 
well 
you should still be prepared if it does 
i think what rowan is trying to say is 
some people on the internet just
aren t as nice as we d like them to be 
i think i can handle  like 
one troll on twitter 
i ve been through a lot worse  right 
right  yeah  of course 
so  wait  did i hear you guys were doing 
like  a kickball game on saturday 
yeah  it s kind of the best time

that it blew up 
i mean  you and kendall 
no  i m    i m happy to help 
and listen  i didn t    i didn t mean
to sound pessimistic or anything in group 
  i just    i

to turn victims into villains sometimes

so i am here if you need me

about paris 
i don t   
i don t know what you re talking about 
remember your first day back at work 
you talked about how sunny and clear
it was all morning before the bombings 
well  i remembered reading
it was raining right before the attacks 
that s weird  right 
but i thought   hey  you know what 
she s confused 
she s been through a lot  it happens  
then  at that party 
you know the one
for your brilliant article 
you said you went and toured notre dame 
which i found odd 
considering it s been closed to the public
since half of it burned down 
okay 
so  i decided to look up
this retreat  l esprit nouveau 
other than one website 
doesn t really seem to exist 
and when i googled
all the names on the list 
not a single one turned up anything
about writing  except yours 
i mean  god 
does nobody fact check anything anymore 
okay  if you just give me   
uh  no  i m not done 
see  i had my suspicions 
but i didn t have proof  until i saw this 
you went through my computer 
why would you do that 
you know what  because i didn t like you 
i never trusted you 
the way you acted when you came back
from paris was sus as hell 
and yeah  i was probably jealous
that you got an office 
but you know what i didn t do 
lie about being in a fucking
terrorist attack to get one for myself 
i didn t know  how was i supposed to know
that there was going to be a   
i just was lying about a trip 
that was it  to get colin s attention 
so what  you thought this was better
than admitting you lied
in a couple of instagram stories 
i don t know  i don t know  i just   
harper  i m a different person now 
please  please  just    what do you want 
do you want money  i can find you money 
my parents have a lot of connections 
my mom can get you into soho house 
the one in malibu 
people died  danni 
do you get that  people died 
i know 
i m gonna give you two options here 
you can either wait for me
to write an article exposing you 
which would be really good for my career 
or i will give you the opportunity
to tell everyone yourself 
i don t   
you have until monday
to make your decision 
 sighs  oh  and by the way 
whichever one you pick 
you owe rowan aldren a fucking apology 
 sighs 
fuck 
fuck 
 muffled scream 
i can t 
 danni  i want to start off by saying
there s nothing that will make
what i m about to tell you okay 
two months ago  i informed you all
that i had been selected
for a writers  retreat in paris 
i lied 
i never went to paris 
i stayed home and faked photos
to make it look like i did 
all to impress a guy 
fuck 
i was under the influence of marijuana
at the time that i concocted this idea 
which contributed
to my poor decision making 
but still  i am taking full responsibility
for my actions 
 sighs 
i recognize now that this decision
was a product of my loneliness
and desire to find meaning in my life 
and also my depression 
 phone alarm chiming 
i deeply regret my actions 
and i m committing myself to change 
i feel that coming clean now
is the first step towards that change 
and rowan   
i promise you  i will do better 
 exhales sharply 
okay

 contributor  danni sanders
might actually be the worst person
we ve ever covered on this show 
and we covered hitler 
 creator 1 
 acting like she was the victim 
i think that
that turned a lot of people off to her 
 creator 2  but i m really not trying
to get mistaken for danni sanders 
 presenter 2 
i m not gonna go that far  it s a fine 
 presenter 1  not for me  i own guns 
you wanna be everywhere 
try being in an obituary 
danni sanders 
you don t seem to know where you re at 
but you know  i know where you re at

if i was you  i would not want
that information out  that sucks

 singer 
  it ended when i lost your love  
  i wake up in the morning and i wonder  
  why everything s the same as it was   
danni 
no  no  no  look at this  hmm 
six years in afghanistan 
you want to talk about fucking trauma 
huh  trauma  that s   
bitch 
all right  guinea weasley 
this is gonna be our new home for a while 
 mom  what are you gonna do 
how are you ever gonna be able
to get another job 
or find a husband 
  or get approved by a co op board 
  i don t know  i don t know 
i don t know 
your father is getting death threats
sent to his work 
they re accusing us of being in on it 
yeah  i know 
i just    i can t 
okay  i    me   
can i have a cup of hot cocoa 
please 
  why does my heart go on beating   
  why do these eyes of mine cry   
  don t they know  
  it s the end of the world   
  it ended when you said  
  goodbye  
hi  i m danni 
it has been a little over a month 
and it s like i still don t know
where to start 
sometimes a good place to start
can be with a little self reflection 
you know  speak on the new perspective
that you ve gained from this experience 
right  yeah  i   
i guess    what i ve learned
from this experience is that 
i 
i don t think
that i like myself very much 
mm hmm 
 danni 
i m not sure that i ever really have 
which is funny 
like  considering my life   
oh  my god 
my life before this  it was so easy 
so easy 
no one stared at me in the street 
no one doxed me on twitter  no one   
no one gave a shit 
 group member  yeah 
which is why i lied 
and now 
now i hate myself so much more
than i did before 
so what 
are we supposed to feel bad for you 
 clears throat 
i mean  you re saying you ve learned 
but at the end of the day 
you re a privileged white girl
who thinks she s the main character 
quinn  what have we said
about criticizing other people 
 both  for the mistakes
we ve made ourselves 
quinn s 
totally right 
i don t know if i ve learned anything 
i don t know 
if i m better 
i don t know if i ve grown 
i don t know if i ve  learned 
and    i just    i don t
know  i don t know 
have you tried making amends 
directly to the people that you hurt 
not like over the internet 
hmm

 hip hop playing 
   music stops 
   applause 
 no audible dialogue 
 emcee  and up next 
we have rowan aldren reciting
an original spoken word piece 
 cheering 
so this is a different piece than the one
i originally planned on doing 
it s a little rough  but i  um 
i think it s more fitting 
 exhales shakily 
if you re not okay  that s okay 
 inhales sharply 
that s advice i gave 
six words that came out of my mouth
that on that day
you snatched up like a handout 
 i am not okay 
a sentence that resonated
with a nation    no 
a generation scared to wake up
in their own nation 
determined of their own
inevitable termination 
smart move 
turning that fear into clickbait 
but  god  i guess i am
just so used to being stolen from 
that when i read my words in your voice 
i reposted  em 
and applauded as you boasted 
gave you a platform
that floated you right up to the top 
and you never thought to stop 
when you looked down at the bodies
that you used as props 
when you looked into my eyes 
you just saw another voice to co opt 
you know  for someone who s not okay 
you seem okay with quite a lot  actually 
and while i was blindsided 
why am i not surprised 
why is a story like yours
something we read every other night 
why do people like you get movies
on netflix and hulu 
and people like me get told
to sit tight and wait for change 
no  you don t know what that s like 
you can t take the mic 
this is my time slot 
one more minute  right 
 scattered whoops and cheers 
 clapping 
i have had everything stolen from me 
their breath  stolen 
my breath  perpetually holding  wondering
if someone near me might be holding   
i m sorry 
is my trauma showing 
because i don t plan
on slowing or sitting down 
this is my time to take back the words
that you stole from my mouth 
you have never seen anything destroyed
except yourself 
and that is of your own doing 
so hell no  i am not okay 
i think about her every single day 
you know when the newspapers wrote
about my sister 
they misspelled her name 
and now you think her place
is something you can claim 
her body is in the ground 
and you think you re the same 
i hope you realize that by doing this 
you ve only given me more to say 
so maybe one day i ll forgive you 
but we will never be okay 
 applause 
yes 
yes 
you did that  you did it 
 no audible dialogue 
  declaration  playing 
 singer    like a dog with his tail
between his legs

  i knew things could get complicated  
  oh oh  i m ashamed

  the mirror s clean  i scream again  
  whoa oh  oh  i m ashamed  
  so whoa whoa whoa

  can t escape the fate of judgment day  
  for the things i ve done  
  this is a declaration of a fuck up  
  a product of how i was raised  
  and i don t expect a single teardrop  
  whoa  i am ashamed  
  this is a declaration of a fuck up  
  and in the end
i don t know how to change  
  and i don t expect a single teardrop  
  whoa  i am ashamed

  rolled through your town
and massacred  
  i wish i died a hundred times  
  whoa oh  oh  i m ashamed  
  so whoa whoa whoa  
  i run  
  can t escape the fate of judgment day  
  for the things i ve done  
  this is a declaration of a fuck up  
  a product of how i was raised  
  and i don t expect a single teardrop  
  whoa  i am ashamed  
  this is a declaration of a fuck up  
  and in the end
i don t know how to change  
  and i don t expect a single teardrop  
  whoa  i am ashamed
