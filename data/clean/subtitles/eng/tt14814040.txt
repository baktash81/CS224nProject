you just wake up every day thinking
i want to be seen
to be completely honest danni sanders
might actually be the worst person
weve ever covered on this show
and we covered hitler
danni i wanna be important
contributor okay guys today
were talking about white privilege
so you know
we need to talk about danni sanders
acting like she was the victim
i think that
that turned a lot of people off to her
danni i wanna have purpose
so i was just gonna bleach the front bits
but im really not trying to get mistaken
for danni sanders
danni i wanna be known
i wanna be loved
presenter 1 and the award
for mostanticipated death
presenter 2 danni sanders
i cant wait for her to kick the bucket
presenter 2 dont
in fact ill do it for you
mimics gunshot
thats a little far
im not gonna go that far its a fine
not for me i own guns
danni i wanna matter
explosion
yeah well let me tell you
be careful what you fucking wish for
singer  im the worst
youre gonna hate me
yeah yeah yeah yeah
im the worst
okay
clears throat
danni
yeah
had a chance to read
that article you sent me
you did
mmhmm
what did you think
well youve titled it why am i so sad
thats just a working title
in a world surrounded by those
who seem to have it all
ive settled on a few reasons
for my own feelings of emptiness
the first is that
i currently live in bushwick
jtrain bushwick
ltrain bushwick would be fine
just like somewhere you can get
a decent match a you know
reason number two
my lack of a private office at work
openconcept spaces
really drown out my inner voice
finally
and this one really stuck with me
okay
missing 911
yeah
i was on a cruise with my parents
when it happened
in general i think we try to avoid
expressing any kind of fomo about 911
sighs
did you read that article on the cut
the one
it talked about how it was the single
most formative trauma experience
for zillennials
and since i wasnt there
i didnt get to share that bond
with my peers
you know like
i didnt even know anyone that died
okay and you dont feel like it comes off
a little tonedeaf offensive even
cant tonedeaf be like a brand though
oh no
isnt that what lena dunham does
you dont wanna be like lena dunham
i dont feel like
you take me seriously as a writer
thats because youre not a writer
youre a photo editor
one whos very late on their deadlines
deadlines that should take priority
over personal goals
ive just been having
a difficult time focusing lately
and ive been having a difficult time
ending this conversation and were done
okay
gonna load up
the head space app after that

danni
i have to be honest
i dont even know what to say

i cant even fathom
what youve been through
and i dont want you to feel pressure
to come back to work right away
no really i wanna be here
if youre sure but you set the pace
if you need to leave early
take a mental health day
you dont even have to ask just go
i will
and danni
i know weve had our conflicts
and im so sorry
i was ever gonna fire you
but i want you to know
the fact that youre standing right here
you were gonna fire me
in front of me instead of being
curled up in a ball somewhere
mainlining gummy worms
which is what i would have been doing
thats incredible
you are so strong
isnt she so strong everybody
colleague yeah
susan mmhmm
yeah

actually
i was thinking um
maybe writing a piece about my experience
it it might help me
work through the pain
of course depravity would be honored
to give you a platform
all right
sighs
so it was a totally normal day at first
it was sunny it was clear
i was at the arc having
a cute little quiet morning to myself
before i went to breakfast
with the other writers
and i dont know
i saw this weird guy in this big jacket
then suddenly
i was hit with this feeling
like something horrible was gonna happen
oh jesus
i knew i needed to leave
so i turned around to go
and as i was walking away
boom
all gasp
thats when it hit
so youre a psychic
like the lady of galadhrim
or it was god
excuse me
this is a nondenominational workspace
well i didnt say which god
didnt you
whoa whoa
my bad chuckles
its just my ears are still ringing
because of the terrorists
colin yo danni

chuckles ha
danni my name is danni sanders
and on april 10th i almost died
but something or someone saved me
maybe it was a guardian angel
or god or alan rick mans ghost
but i dont think that i believe
in any of that
more likely it was me who saved me
not that i believe in myself either
but if all of this
has taught me something
chuckles
its that maybe i should
oh my god
this is me exclamation mark
intermittent buzzing
ghostly voice neuf
phone vibrates repeatedly
i will never forget what i saw that day
guinea pig squeaks
what did i see that day
okay survivor of bombing
ew
oh my god
thats good thats a good idea
hello
hey mom hi mom
how are you danni
hi mom yeah
no i just had a quick question
uhhuh
what
do you remember what the name
of the support group is
that helens husband used to go to
survivor 1 and the sounds were coming
like 30 seconds apart
im sure it was just
a wheel on the tracks
everyone else was just you know annoyed
i physically started shaking
i got off the train
i just walked uptown from canal
i mean i felt like such an idiot
and i was late
i was not getting back on that train
chuckles
leader
loud noises can be very triggering
i think a lot of us struggled with that
survivor 2 i make my kids mute
the tv when theyre gaming
they hate it
but i cant get any work done
when im hearing gunfire
or or explosions
you let your kids play those
you dont think thats normalizing
a culture that glorifies gun violence
okay why dont we all just take a second
and welcome our new addition
hi
hi
leader whats your name
danni
i was in paris last week
when the bombings hit at the arc
oh i am so sorry do you
do you wanna share anything about how
youre youre feeling or your thoughts
oh chuckles
i was just hoping to listen today

in your own time
were all survivors here
charles why dont you speak for a bit
charles is one of our newer members
he just returned from the uk
hes also a bombing survivor
he was at the ariana grande concert
look its not easy
okay
i mean its been years for me
and i still have to talk
about it every week
im sorry thats not comforting um
its not like
your life doesnt end okay
i know that it probably feels
like that right now
its just
everything changes colors
yes thats exactly
i never would have thought
to put it like that
what is it for you
maybe purple
whats yours
red
its like everything is red forever
and on one hand
its really vivid and intense
but on the other
everything feels completely
monochrome
you relate to that danni
i just
sort of understand the monochrome bit
thats how everything is for me too
but mines like
gray all the time
and how does it feel
when the world looks that way to you
i dont know
doesnt really feel like anything
just sort of numb
ugh
chuckles
see you next week

contributor
today were talking about rowan aldren
a teen gunsafety activist
poet and social influencer
after surviving the oak valley
school shooting in north carolina
rowan came to new york to partner
with the weve had enough organization
to begin her fight for gun reform
heres a look
rowan two miles
you can be two miles from a gunshot
and still hear it
that day
even if you were nowhere near it
i swear you heard those bullets
loud enough to fear em
two miles
but the 23 at my school
carried much farther
maybe thats just how it sounds
when a child dies a martyr
and yet it was quiet
quieter than it should have been
we needed a riot
and all we got was a funeral hymn
and someone saying hey
couldnt one of you have tackled him
two miles and yet not a word
i look up at the people in power
and ask how thick are your walls
that you cant hear what i heard
well here behind our walls
our lives were taken turn by turn
have we earned your sympathy yet sir
there is more than one person at fault
for what happened to us
there is more than one person
who pulled the trigger on that gun
and i have had enough
enough pain enough corruption
enough death enough destruction
enough sleepless nights
still watching my friends die
enough of listening
to our politicians lie
enough
crowd cheering
danni hey
hey
that is such a cute hairpin im dead
oh thank you i made it myself
cool
so no you
so
i was just gonna say thank you
for meeting me
yeah of course of course
how are you how are you doing
im good yeah
i mean im managing i guess yeah but
yes
do you have family around
you know like in new york
yeah my dad cries
whenever he sees me now though
and my mom keeps shipping me
wellness supplements
that she reads about on goop
okay um well what about your friends
i mean im seeing you right
right
so you know
hey are you are you cool
if we maybe walk somewhere
yeah
yeah
danni thats a good idea
rowan im glad you reached out
its gonna be great to have someone
in group whos not like 50
oh thats no im
i dont think ill
that was just like
a onetime thing for me but
the support group why
i dont know
therapy never really worked for me
its not therapy okay
its better its its family
besides i mean whos gonna help me
explain tiktok references to the boomers
is tiktok a is it a topic
that comes up a lot in meetings
oh you would be surprised
chuckles
so listen i was kinda hoping i might
be able to get your advice on something
full disclosure i stalked you online
that poetry you do its crazy
it sounds just like hamilton
yeah its its called spoken word
cool cool cool im a writer too
oh cool
yeah and i actually have
this article due right now
for the magazine that im working at
and i feel really stuck
like i just
i dont know if you could
give me any tips or
its about what happened
and i brought my laptop
i dont know we could hole up
at one of those little writery cafés
you could be my coach
sure
thank you okay
you know actually
i wanted to take you here first
i think it could be super helpful
before you write you have to deal with
why youre feeling stuck
oh okay so and then well go write
yeah come on
okay
what is this place
rowan
how do you feel about breaking things
fuck the senate for not passing
that background check bill last week
panting
now you try
oh um
okay
fuck the bombing in paris
no youre not mad enough okay
you have to feel it
okay what if i dont
what if i dont feel angry
all right then what do you feel
well i dont know scoffs
numb
still numb
use that smash the numbness
whispers smash the numbness
good again
yes okay you feel that
keep going let it out
thats it let it out
yell if you want to
fuck you
danni laughs
breathes heavily
look what you asked before
that is how i write
you have to attack it
that is whats gonna make
people pay attention okay
no more scrolling past headlines
no more distractions
we do that with our truth
if youre not okay thats okay
you know as as fucked up as it sounds
your pain is your biggest asset
grunts
yeah
panting
oh my god
okay
ill never forget what i saw that day
but the truth is
you dont need to hear it
all you need to know is
i am not okay
what happened in paris changed me
but what ive realized since
is that my pain can actually be an asset
it can stop you all
from scrolling past headlines
distracting yourselves with baby goats
and shein ads and asmr videos
it can make you pay attention
and in turn truly ask yourselves
am i okay
am i okay
danni now my own sadness my anger
they may stem from something
more traumatic
than youll ever experience
but that doesnt mean
your pain isnt just as real
yo
danni it doesnt mean
youre not waking up every day
feeling numb and useless and alone
i think a lot of us are
so i wanna invite you
take this opportunity to share your truth
share your pain
youve got nothing to lose
and everything to gain
lets make the world wake up
and pay attention
to the fact that were all hurting
and its time to stop being so afraid
we stan a fearless queen
hey danni booch
sure
oh my god cheers
cheers
colleagues chuckle
so as blm and me too came before us
let us usher in a new era of honesty
on the internet i am not okay
alarm sounds
breathing heavily
school pa this is a lockdown drill
all students and teachers
please follow lockdown procedure
danni heres the article
it would mean a lot if you reposted
couldnt have written it without you
dancing girls emoji
sparkling heart emoji
rowan congrats thedannisanders

overlapping voices reading posts
i am not okay
i am not okay
i am not okay
we are not okay
multiple voices i am not okay
danni you had a big week
danni chuckles
do you wanna talk a little
about how it felt
to publish such a personal piece

honestly
its been amazing
its just so freeing
to finally admit that i am not okay
and its so crazy
to see all these celebrities
using my hashtag
to talk about their trauma
did you see kendall jenners post
you did
oh yeah
i had no idea
that she was so discriminated against
you always hear these horror stories
of people in the spotlight
getting all this hate but i dont know
doesnt seem to be happening to me
well
you should still be prepared if it does
i think what rowan is trying to say is
some people on the internet just
arent as nice as wed like them to be
i think i can handle like
one troll on twitter
ive been through a lot worse right
right yeah of course
so wait did i hear you guys were doing
like a kickball game on saturday

hello
harper its harper
who
harper from work can i come up
uh yeah
uh yeah one sec
buzzing
knocking
hi
hi
hey
whats up
harper
we need to talk
okay about what
about paris
i dont
i dont know what youre talking about
remember your first day back at work
you talked about how sunny and clear
it was all morning before the bombings
well i remembered reading
it was raining right before the attacks
thats weird right
but i thought hey you know what
shes confused
shes been through a lot it happens
then at that party
you know the one
for your brilliant article
you said you went and toured notredame
which i found odd
considering its been closed to the public
since half of it burned down
okay
so i decided to look up
this retreat lesprit nouveau
other than one website
doesnt really seem to exist
and when i googled
all the names on the list
not a single one turned up anything
about writing except yours
i mean god
does nobody factcheck anything anymore
okay if you just give me
uh no im not done
see i had my suspicions
but i didnt have proof until i saw this
you went through my computer
why would you do that
you know what because i didnt like you
i never trusted you
the way you acted when you came back
from paris was sus as hell
and yeah i was probably jealous
that you got an office
but you know what i didnt do
lie about being in a fucking
terrorist attack to get one for myself
i didnt know how was i supposed to know
that there was going to be a
i just was lying about a trip
that was it to get colins attention
so what you thought this was better
than admitting you lied
in a couple of instagram stories
i dont know i dont know i just
harper im a different person now
please please just what do you want
do you want money i can find you money
my parents have a lot of connections
my mom can get you into soho house
the one in malibu
people died danni
do you get that people died
i know
im gonna give you two options here
you can either wait for me
to write an article exposing you
which would be really good for my career
or i will give you the opportunity
to tell everyone yourself
i dont
you have until monday
to make your decision
sighs oh and by the way
whichever one you pick
you owe rowan aldren a fucking apology
sighs
fuck
fuck
muffled scream
i cant
danni i want to start off by saying
theres nothing that will make
what im about to tell you okay
two months ago i informed you all
that i had been selected
for a writers retreat in paris
i lied
i never went to paris
i stayed home and faked photos
to make it look like i did
all to impress a guy
fuck
i was under the influence of marijuana
at the time that i concocted this idea
which contributed
to my poor decisionmaking
but still i am taking full responsibility
for my actions
sighs
i recognize now that this decision
was a product of my loneliness
and desire to find meaning in my life
and also my depression
phone alarm chiming
i deeply regret my actions
and im committing myself to change
i feel that coming clean now
is the first step towards that change
and rowan
i promise you i will do better
exhales sharply
okay
notification alert
notification alert
notification alerts continue rapidly
ro youre trending
people in office whispering
this is so fucked up isnt it kevin
white women
we did we did a round of factchecking
she made a fucking website

muffled shouting
muffled you have no idea
you didnt tell me
i had to find out
from a fucking depravity article danni
just give me one minute i know i know
muffled shouting
people in office whispering
and i made a mistake and i just
i feel bad because youre my best friend
muffled you have to go no danni
listen to me for one minute
no you have to go you have to go
just go
oh shit
what i miss
sobs
sobbing
the end of the world playing
singer
why does the sun go on shining
why does the sea
contributor danni sanders
might actually be the worst person
weve ever covered on this show
and we covered hitler
creator 1
acting like she was the victim
i think that
that turned a lot of people off to her
creator 2 but im really not trying
to get mistaken for danni sanders
presenter 2
im not gonna go that far its a fine
presenter 1 not for me i own guns
you wanna be everywhere
try being in an obituary
danni sanders
you dont seem to know where youre at
but you know i know where youre at
is that your address
that look familiar
im pretty sure thats your address
both 3824 linden street
presenter 1 youre here haha
yo any serial killers wanna do
a little practice run theres your place
if i was you i would not want
that information out that sucks
oh no
that sucks
no one loves you danni fuck you
singer
it ended when i lost your love
i wake up in the morning and i wonder
why everythings the same as it was
danni
no no no look at this hmm
six years in afghanistan
you want to talk about fucking trauma
huh trauma thats
bitch
all right guinea weasley
this is gonna be our new home for a while
mom what are you gonna do
how are you ever gonna be able
to get another job
or find a husband
or get approved by a coop board
i dont know i dont know
i dont know
your father is getting death threats
sent to his work
theyre accusing us of being in on it
yeah i know
i just i cant
okay i me
can i have a cup of hot cocoa
please
why does my heart go on beating
why do these eyes of mine cry
dont they know
its the end of the world
it ended when you said
goodbye
hi im danni
it has been a little over a month
and its like i still dont know
where to start
sometimes a good place to start
can be with a little selfreflection
you know speak on the new perspective
that youve gained from this experience
right yeah i
i guess what ive learned
from this experience is that
i
i dont think
that i like myself very much
mmhmm
danni
im not sure that i ever really have
which is funny
like considering my life
oh my god
my life before this it was so easy
so easy
no one stared at me in the street
no one doxed me on twitter no one
no one gave a shit
group member yeah
which is why i lied
and now
now i hate myself so much more
than i did before
so what
are we supposed to feel bad for you
clears throat
i mean youre saying youve learned
but at the end of the day
youre a privileged white girl
who thinks shes the main character
quinn what have we said
about criticizing other people
both for the mistakes
weve made ourselves
quinns
totally right
i dont know if ive learned anything
i dont know
if im better
i dont know if ive grown
i dont know if ive learned
and i just i dont
know i dont know
have you tried making amends
directly to the people that you hurt
not like over the internet
hmm
okay
singers  finale finale finale
finale finale finale
finale finale finale
finale finale finale
hiphop playing
music stops
applause
no audible dialogue
emcee and up next
we have rowan aldren reciting
an original spokenword piece
cheering
so this is a different piece than the one
i originally planned on doing
its a little rough but i um
i think its more fitting
exhales shakily
if youre not okay thats okay
inhales sharply
thats advice i gave
six words that came out of my mouth
that on that day
you snatched up like a handout
i am not okay
a sentence that resonated
with a nation no
a generation scared to wake up
in their own nation
determined of their own
inevitable termination
smart move
turning that fear into clickbait
but god i guess i am
just so used to being stolen from
that when i read my words in your voice
i reposted em
and applauded as you boasted
gave you a platform
that floated you right up to the top
and you never thought to stop
when you looked down at the bodies
that you used as props
when you looked into my eyes
you just saw another voice to coopt
you know for someone whos not okay
you seem okay with quite a lot actually
and while i was blindsided
why am i not surprised
why is a story like yours
something we read every other night
why do people like you get movies
on netflix and hulu
and people like me get told
to sit tight and wait for change
no you dont know what thats like
you cant take the mic
this is my time slot
one more minute right
scattered whoops and cheers
clapping
i have had everything stolen from me
their breath stolen
my breath perpetually holding wondering
if someone near me might be holding
im sorry
is my trauma showing
because i dont plan
on slowing or sitting down
this is my time to take back the words
that you stole from my mouth
you have never seen anything destroyed
except yourself
and that is of your own doing
so hell no i am not okay
i think about her every single day
you know when the newspapers wrote
about my sister
they misspelled her name
and now you think her place
is something you can claim
her body is in the ground
and you think youre the same
i hope you realize that by doing this
youve only given me more to say
so maybe one day ill forgive you
but we will never be okay
applause
yes
yes
you did that you did it
no audible dialogue
