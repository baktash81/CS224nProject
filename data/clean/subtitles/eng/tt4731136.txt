a leveraged equity position in cisco
then i want you to take everything out of
first national and move it over to banyon
wait you mean delaware
i thought that was dead
thats resurrected
we need to clean up the
reynolds account
in case those fucks at aml
decide to do their job
are you sure about this
nothing on email
move everything back on monday
you paying attention
yeah yeah i am
tickets
i dont know if
im sending the numbers through now
what about green
uh stall him i dont give a shit
call in sick if you have to
business or pleasure
i dont know i just
seriously
look i dont know
if i feel comfortable
josh josh stop being such a pussy
just do what i tell you to do
and call me when its done
to my fellow members of the board
a man cannot unsee the truth
he cannot willingly return to darkness
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight
any more than he can be unborn
we are the only species
capable of selfreflection
the only species
with the toxin of selfdoubt
written into our genetic code
unequal to our gifts we build
we buy we consume
we wrap ourselves in the illusion
of material success
we cheat and deceive as we claw our way
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement
superiority to other men
corner office
whod you have to blow
i heard he closed the reynolds account
how exactly did you do that
just that good i guess
dont forget about us little people
oh how could i
you know how i take my coffee
excuse me but they wanna see you
upstairs in the partners boardroom
tell them ill be right there
oh and tomorrow
is your mothers birthday
get her something for me would you
of course
there is a sickness inside us
rising like the bile that leaves that
bitter taste at the back of our throats
its there in every one of you
seated around the table
we deny its existence until one day
the body rebels against the mind
and screams out
i am not a well man
no doubt you will think
only of the merger
that unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions
but the truth cannot be ignored
for only when we know what ails us
can we hope to find the cure
i will not return
do not attempt to contact me again
sincerely roland e pembroke
well mr lockhart
what do you make of that
clearly hes lost his mind
our thoughts exactly
man goes for a twoweek spa vacation
and has a complete mental breakdown
who the hell takes the waters
in the 21 st century anyway
i trust you understand the sensitivity
of some of the information in that letter
so its true
a merger of this kind will make us
one of the biggest financial service firms
on the eastern seaboard
something that stands to
enrich everyone in this room
including you
we hear good things
your work on the reynolds
account was inspired
of course the sec will want
unfettered access to our books
any irregularities are sure to come out
you didnt really think
we wouldnt find out
i dont know what youre talking about
you think theres a trick
you can pull we havent tried
this is amateur
can i ask you something mr lockhart
you ever have a 12inch
black dick in your ass
prison mr lockhart
youre in a lot of trouble
if that were the case
you would have already turned me in
so my guess is the sec
is after someone a little more senior
someone on the board perhaps
or someone whos clearly unstable
wed like you to go to switzerland
and bring mr pembroke back to us
you see
the merger cannot go through
without mr pembroke signing off
on certain legal matters
i dont have the relationship
with mr pembroke that morris had
fuck morris
now morris was a good salesman
dependable family man
god rest his soul
but he didnt have vision
someone has to take responsibility
josh its me again
in an hour and a half the nikkei closes
when it does i want you to empty
banyon and buy puts in glenco
im sending the details over now
and fucking call me back
i dont like leaving messages like this
youre here for the cure
no im just visiting
you mind
go ahead
youre younger than most of my passengers
do a lot of driving for the sanitarium
all the driving
every week i pick up
rich people from the train
and take them up the mountain
only rich people huh
must be expensive
well wealthy people
have wealthy problems
me im happy with a simple life
thats it no ambition
just drive people
up and down the mountain
most people tend to stay
whys that
i guess they like it there
oh shit
i dont go in for spas
and that kind of thing
i work for a living
like my father before me
a son learns what it is to
be a man from his father
am i right
i wouldnt know
i didnt grow up with my father
how long will you be gone
just a few days its business
you dont look well
im fine i just havent been
sleeping much
you need to rest
you know i always
told your father to rest
but he wouldnt listen
he was weak
you didnt know him
and whose fault is that
so are you happy here
are they taking good care of you
people come here to die
why would i be happy
im getting a promotion
so when i get back
ill be able to move you
to somewhere better
somewhere near the beach or something
you wont come back
of course i will
another ballerina
shes not like the others
whys that
she lives in a dream
but shes dancing
thats because she doesnt
know shes dreaming
friendly bunch
yeah
theres always been bad blood
between the villagers
and the people on the hill
whys that
history
how old is this place
foundations date back
to the time of the barons
for centuries all this land
and everyone in it
belonged to one family
the von reichmerls
what happened to them
hmm interesting story
apparently the last baron
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline
he decided only his sister
was clean enough to carry his child
when the church forbade
the union he renounced god
that must have gone over well
no shit
so on his wedding night
the villagers came up the hill
chased the baron and his bride
into the catacombs
and made him watch
while they burned her alive
then they burned
the whole place to the ground
thats a hell of a story
yeah
but that was 200 years ago
a lots changed since then
20 minutes max
no hurry
welcome
may i help you
im here to see a guest
mr roland pembroke
im sorry but visiting hours
are over for the day
ive come a long way
maybe you could make an exception
there are no exceptions
is there a manager i could speak to
sign here
please
thank you mr lockhart
ill see what i can do
you wont get any service here
part of the treatment
you get used to it
whats a tenletter word for amnesty
no idea
exemption
nope thats only nine
absolution
yes
you like puzzles
not really
you mind
thank you
i believe the reception nurse explained
that visiting hours end
at 300 pm precisely
she did but as im sure youre aware
mr pembroke remains the ceo
of a major financial institution
under the circumstances
i was hoping you can make an
exception
vitamins
if we are to help the people
that come here
we must keep up our strength
may one ask what it is concerning
its a business matter
im not at liberty to say
any more than that
of course and i hope you understand
that we also have our rules
our treatments here are most effective
when exposure to the stresses
of the modern world is strictly limited
director volmer is quite firm on that
hydrotherapy
that is correct
thats a long way to come just for water
the sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities
rebuilt
after the fire
yes
history is full of darkness
if you would like to leave a note
id happily pass it along to mr pembroke
mr pieterson
i understand the work
you do here is important
and youre obviously a very busy man
but if you wouldnt mind
finding time between
administering aqua aerobics
and jacuzzis
to inform mr pembroke he has a visitor
with information of the utmost
urgency to him personally
id be grateful
on the other hand if you
want me to write a note
so you can slip it under his door
with his breakfast tray
on the offchance he notices it
before his morning rubdown
im afraid thats not gonna cut it
you see i just traveled
4000 miles to get here
theres a redeye going back
to new york tonight
and i intend mr pembroke
and i to be on it
you plan to take mr pembroke
back to new york with you
is that a problem
of course it is entirely
up to mr pembroke
hes a patient not a prisoner
hell be in treatment until after 700
if youd like to come back then
ill make sure hes available
thank you for your understanding
leaving already
what a nicelooking young man
wheres your friend
what times the last train to zurich
not till 1000
get me to a hotel i gotta make a call
pretty girl
what the fuck
how long will you be gone
just a few days
are we waiting for someone else
there is no one else
sleep well
uh
i cant remember having slept better
its the mountain air
mr lockhart
my name is henrich volmer
i am the director of the sanitarium here
how long have i been here
three days
oh jesus
you can count yourself lucky
it was a clean break
although i do feel partly responsible
the locals tell me i should hunt
the deer on the property
but i cant bring myself to harm
the innocent creatures
after all they were here long before us
i need to call new york
i took the liberty
of informing your office
of the accident if thats your concern
they agreed with me
that business can wait
and your health cannot
hank green said that
even the acting head
of a major wall street finance firm
cant argue with the consequences
of a serious car accident
we dont get many visitors here
most of my patients have done
extraordinary things
built vast fortunes
commanded great empires
but at a terrible cost
they have no one who cares for them
mr pembroke is lucky
he has you
so do your best to relax
enjoy yourself
you are at the foot of the swiss alps
one of the most
beautiful places in the world
think of it as an enforced vacation
although i know you americans
are not so good at vacations are you
and remember youre at altitude
it can take a while to acclimatize
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water
believe me youre in good hands
are you lost
uh yeah
i guess so
where is it youre supposed to be
i dont know
name
pembroke
roland pembroke
here it is
pembroke room 609 steam bath
of course
mr pembroke
the steam baths are in that direction
you cant go in there
not like that
pembroke
it is mr pembroke isnt it
do i know you
my name is lockhart mr green sent me
i thought theyd send morris
morris is dead
heart attack
mr pembroke ive come to
bring you back to new york
you want me to leave here
just for a few days
im afraid i cant do that
why not
im not well
you look all right to me
thats because you are blind
as i was
but soon youll see
rest assured
theyll take good care of you here
im not a patient
what happened to your leg
mr pembroke the situation in new york
is really quite serious
no longer my concern
the director says
i must not involve myself
in business matters
have you met director volmer
this morning
he is a great man
kind man
not like other doctors
mr pembroke
this obsession with blood
you see they have it all wrong
do you know the body is 65 water
its our fluids that must be purified
word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked
the share price is in free fall
lockhart
youre not any relation
to henry lockhart are you
my father
you knew him
we started out together
terrible what happened to him
they said there was a boy left in the car
i dont remember much to be honest
he didnt deserve what we did to him
what do you mean
he was an honest man
and we destroyed him for it
well people get fucked over every day
either you have what it takes
to survive or you dont
and i suppose you do
is that why you came all this way
ambition
then you have it worse than any of us
whats that
the sickness
your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us
the pointlessness of the entire endeavor
weve all done terrible things
so many terrible things
whats it trading at
what
the stock whats it trading at
eight and a half at close on friday
parasites
itll be lower by now
were all concerned for your
wellbeing mr pembroke
mmm
just a few days
there are certain irregularities
in some of the accounts
that need to be clarified before
the merger can be completed
and i suppose someone
has to take responsibility
something like that
then i better get my things
i need a car to take me to the station
will you call one for me please
ill see what i can do
thats where the baron hung the priest
whats that
see
the church would have been
right over there
where that funny little building is now
im sure of it
people used to come from miles around
for the miracles attributed
to the holy water
guess some things dont change
how marvelous
terrible thing though such violence
thats what you get
for marrying your sister
sister
yeah it was all about
a pure bloodline wasnt it
how fascinating
i must look into that
glad to see youre back on your feet
we heard about the accident
youre american arent you mister
lockhart
frank hill stockholm
and this is mr nair from london
bombay originally
i see youve met mrs watkins
our amateur historian
yes of course how rude
victoria watkins 40 years at xerox
why dont you pull up a chair
we need a fourth
careful like most brahmins he cheats
coming from a venture capitalist
i take that as a compliment
actually i was just on my way back
to new york with mr pembroke
then hes
hes feeling better
well enough
i suppose thats wonderful news
isnt that right mr nair
wonderful news
mrs watkins
time for your treatment
yes of course
pleasure to meet you mr lockhart
safe travels
something in the water
at the bottom
i dont see anything
did it hurt
cant remember
better that way
i saw you
before
are you a patient here
its just youre so much younger
than everyone else
director volmer says im a special case
what about you
are you here for the cure
no
actually i was just leaving
no one ever leaves
what are you talking about
why would anyone want to
yeah i see your point
did you get what you came for
well i came to bring
someone back to new york
so yeah i did
does he want to go
not really
that song you were singing
where did you learn that
i have to go now
whats your name
hannah
mr pembroke
wheres pembroke
the patient that was
in this room where is he
i thought you were pembroke
do you know what they used to recommend
for the common stomach ailment
the application of leeches
based on the diagnosis
i always pitied the leech
mmm mr lockhart
please wont you join us
the sturgeon is excellent
unless of course you prefer the venison
i couldnt let it go to waste
wheres pembroke
mr pembroke has unfortunately
taken a turn for the worse
i fear your conversation
about business matters
has set him back somewhat
but no matter we have moved him on
to the next stage of treatment
he looked all right to me
but youre not a doctor
maybe its time for a second opinion
that of course is up to mr pembroke
and hes not available
ever since i got here
you people have been
giving me the runaround
i would ask you please
to keep your voice down
we wouldnt wanna upset
the clientele would we
mr lockhart giving you the runaround
is the furthest thing from my mind
my sole concern is for
the welfare of my patients
its bad for business if
people start getting better
am i right
what are you implying mr lockhart
old people paying through
the teeth for what water
whats your overhead anyway
that is not your concern
i dont wanna have to
get lawyers involved
but i came to get pembroke
back to new york
and thats what im gonna do
if i have to hit him over his head
and drag him out by his hair
are you feeling all right
mr lockhart you seem pale
im fine
youre bleeding
what
perhaps you should sit down
no signs of concussion
any headaches hallucinations
no
you may dress
are you drinking the water
yes
good
make sure you do
i took the liberty of running a few tests
after the accident
hannah
isnt it
yes
shes a very special case
what does that mean exactly
she was exposed to serious trauma
when she was very young
her development was delayed
hannah did not utter a word
until she was 11 years old
please understand
mr lockhart
she is like a daughter to me
but were here to discuss you
an imbalance in your fluids
strain to the major organs
depleted immune system
many indicators that you have in common
with most of my patients
but i will confess
i have never seen a case
as advanced as this
in someone so young
is that right
tell me mr lockhart
when was the last time
that you actually felt well
before you came here
when was the last time
that you even slept through the night
the mind may lie
but the body cannot
i should like to help you
what we offer here
is a simple process of purification
away from pressures of the modern world
a return to a simpler time
mr pembroke will not be ready
to travel for a day or two
and if youre willing
i would like to recommend a treatment
i can speak to the duty nurse
and we may be able to start
as early as this evening
if you think its necessary
good
greta
greta
youre in luck mr lockhart
we can get you in right away
vr
von reichmerl
it was found during the reconstruction
then it belong to the baron
the baroness actually
vanessa von reichmerl
she was sickly
the baron was obsessed
with finding a cure
it was he in fact who first discovered
the medicinal properties of our water
he sacrificed everything
he must have loved her very much
yes
like a sister
history is right of course
to judge him on moral grounds
but as a man of science
i cant help but admire him
the duty nurse will escort you
to our isolation wing
thank you
mr lockhart
if you wouldnt mind
just so we can keep an eye
on your progress
are you ready mr lockhart
then let us begin
life on this planet first came from water
we spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged
our bodies mostly liquid
this sensory deprivation chamber
simulates a return
to that embryonic state
think of it as a cleansing of the mind
as much as the body
some patients experience
increased heart rate
visions
even primal memories
but rest assured
its just the toxins leaving the system
give yourself over completely
to the process
and you will see the results
keep a close eye on him
yes sir
mr lockhart
the treatment lasts 30 minutes
ill be monitoring you from here
if you have any issues
just tap on the side of the tank
get back
in the last five days a total collapse
the dow plunging over 508 points
as panic spread throughout wall street
wiping out more than
onethird of the gains
from this rare fiveyear bull market
more than half of that
in a single trading day
chairman of new york
stock exchange john phelan
tried to reassure investors
dad
dad
mr lockhart are you all right
get off me
try to stay calm
im terribly sorry
something must have
gone wrong with the machine
theres something in the water
theres something in the fucking water
there is nothing in the water
mr lockhart
but i saw them
as the director explained
some patients experience visions
with this particular treatment
just the toxins leaving the body
its all part of the cure
you need to rest now
i will help you to your room
got you
morning lockhart
feeling better
joining us for breakfast
the kedgeree is excellent
im not hungry
you must keep up your strength
mrs watkins
that building where the church
used to be
whats it used for now
i couldnt say
you were right about
the baron and his sister
but thats not the reason
the villagers burned the place down
it was on account of the experiments
some sort of medical experiments
apparently performed on his own peasants
people went missing
and then
im jahre 1814
farmers tilling their fields
stumbled on human bodies
disfigured and emaciated
dried up like the mummies of egypt
he was looking for a cure
a cure
for the baroness
she was sick
oh i see
i knew you liked puzzles
of course
mrs watkins
time for your treatment
are you certain
i just had one this morning
im sure of it
i have you on the schedule
i must not be feeling myself today
there is a terrible darkness here
what is this place
im sorry i dont understand
i thought i saw you with a patient
no patient
okay
thank you
going for a swim
im not supposed to
whys that
on the account of my condition
thought the water made you better
told you im a special case
right
how far is it to town
a few miles i think
are you going to walk all the way
unless you wanna lend me your bike
what will you give me
it was my mothers
her eyes are closed
yeah shes dreaming
she just doesnt know it
what happens if she wakes up
i dont know
my mother never finished the story
so we got a deal
how will you ride it
maybe you could come along
im not supposed to
you always do what youre supposed to do
its okay
coming
want a beer or something
i dont know do i
i dont know what you want
all right if youre having one
still here
thought you were just visiting
youve looked better
same to you
hows the car
that car was a piece of shit
sanitarium offered me enough
to buy a new one
so gracias a dios
everything happens for a reason right
you drink too much
i hope youre not driving
you two are from up on the hill
thats right
we dont get many patients down here
good kids at heart
just werent raised properly
no respect for tradition
know if theres a doctor in town
all the doctors are up on the hill
a pharmacist
something like that
theres pieter over the road
he a doctor
close enough
dont you like it
no
what you never had a beer before
how long have you been at the sanitarium
since i can remember
what about your family
my mother died in a fire when i was young
director volmer says that
my father will come for me
when im better
does he visit
hell come when im better
vitamins
mmmhmm
can i try
um
okay
ugh
tastes like sweaty seafood
you get used to it eventually
will you be okay here for a few minutes
i just have to go see about something
but i wont be long
uh yeah okay
hello
do you know if theres a doctor here
whats that youre drawing
he wont talk to you
doesnt know how
thats the castle
when they burned it down
my grandson wilmosh
he likes ghost stories
what can i do for you
could you take a look at this
tell me what it says
human
thats right
not my line
ill pay you
how much is this
not much
but enough
got a tampon
my friends time of the month
freak
so is he fit to travel
hes not a well man
some of those are
dental records arent they
thats right
what do they mean
his teeth are falling out
what could cause something like that
barring any preexisting
condition id say
chronic dehydration
dehydration
all they do up there is drink water
im not a doctor
now if youll excuse me
wait a second
the barons experiments
they found bodies in the fields right
dried up like mummies
maybe theres some kind of connection
the baron was burned alive
on his wedding night 200 years ago
yeah but this is happening now
people come here for the cure
thats what the baron was looking for
his wife was sick
she wasnt sick
she was infertile
they tried for years
but the baroness could not
carry a child to term
they say her body rejected the fetuses
because they were deformed
now you must excuse me
i have to put this animal
out of its misery
whats wrong with it
wandered off where
it wasnt supposed to be
broke its leg
like you
found it trapped in a drainage ditch
drinking sewage water
i need to make a phone call
long distance
your credit card
lockhart
mr green
where the hell have you been
i have a question
did pembroke have
any preexisting conditions
what are you talking about
before he got here
any medical conditions was he sick
no the guy is a fucking health nut
drank kale for christs sake
now what the fuck is going on
you were supposed to be here
four days ago
yeah but there was an accident
what accident
what
i dont understand
they said they called you
nobody called
are you sure about that
lockhart do i have to reiterate to you
the importance of what
youve been sent there to do
get pembroke on a plane
within the next 24 hours
or this whole place goes ass over tits
and you with it understand me
lockhart
lockhart
i need to speak with you
hey hey hey
you said no one ever leaves
what does that mean
youre hurting me
what happens to them
please let me go
why wont they let me see pembroke
you know something dont you
no
what is this stuff
what makes you special
fuck off adolf
hey
come on
no
i paid for this dance
no
let her go
go back to the sanitarium cripple
no
no please stop
i am not a patient
hannah
hannah
she may look like a woman
but shes just a child
ignorance mr lockhart
is the great enemy of science
i wanna see pembroke
and you will
coming mr lockhart
nothing happened
thats because i arrived when i did
lockhart was there
with a knife to his throat
hannah
mr lockhart is not able
to look after himself
let alone you
he cant protect you the way i can
i dont need protecting
of course you do
we were just having fun
hes not like the others
hes young

ill just pop it in some milk shall i
there we are
mrs watkins
wheres pembroke
you took him
back to new york
what no
they moved him hes down here somewhere
you told me about
the experiments remember
your puzzle
i like puzzles
yeah
i left it for you
youll see
listen to me
the experiments
i think theyre happening again
the baroness was infertile
not experiments
a cure
she was pregnant the night of the wedding
before they burned her
the villagers cut out the fetus
and threw it in the aquifer
the child survived
she doesnt know
im sorry i dont understand
take it easy
marcus
its all right
mr lockhart
every time i turn around
youre somewhere
youre not supposed to be
i guess im lost
im just trying to find
my way back to my room
this is a restricted floor
there are signs everywhere
surely you didnt just wander
down here by accident
what is it exactly that
you are looking for
i had a problem with my tooth
your tooth
actually its feeling much better
if you could just point me
in the direction of my room
nonsense
we cant let you get an infection
you must let us take care of you
after all
thats why youre here
doctor brennan takes care
of all our patients dental needs
im sorry
hmm
about hannah
it wont happen again
hmm
tell me
what were you doing in town
just having a beer
ah hmm
what are you doing
get your hands off me
its all for your own safety
mr lockhart
we dont believe in chemical
anesthesia at the institute
the impurities inhibit the cure
but you will find that
with a proper focus
the mind can overcome any amount of pain
trust mr lockhart hmm
i mean if we cant trust each other
then how can i help you
mrs abramov
so glad that you are here
how long do we have you with us
just two weeks
i probably overpacked
nonsense
youll be surprised
how time just slips away
here at the institute
drive
what happened to your face
just drive
they held me down and pulled my tooth out
they threatened me
why would they do that
because i know what theyve done
there is a room full of bodies
floating in tanks like specimens
these are very serious allegations
no shit
director volmer is a wellrespected man
the sanatorium is of great importance
for the local economy
take me up there
and ill show you what i saw
do you have any identification on you
no they have everything
well then is there someone
i could speak to
who might confirm you are
who you say you are family
i hope you understand the need
to verify your identity
you can call my office
all right
can i get you coffee or tea
you got anything stronger
of course
rest assured
we will get to the bottom of this
thank you
mr lockhart
weve been worried about you
stay away from me
is this man a patient of yours
yes thats right
im not a patient i was in an accident
you signed the admission form
i have it right here
thats bullshit
i did warn you about
possible delusions remember
a side effect of the toxins
leaving the body
and my leg is that a delusion
mr lockhart has been a disruptive element
since he arrived
he stole confidential medical files
assaulted a member of our dental staff
and threatened mr pembroke
i didnt threaten anybody
i believe your exact words were
if i have to ill hit him over the head
and drag him out by his hair
i was sent here to bring
pembroke back to new york
according to your employer a mr green
youre being investigated
by the securities and exchange commission
youre one of them
listen to yourself mr lockhart
youre not a well man
stop saying that
let us help you
get back
i know about the experiments
the baron and his wife
he has been spending time
with mrs watkins
who is watkins
she was institutionalized
before she came to us
the others humor her
but clearly mr lockharts condition
has made him susceptible
to her conspiracies
i know what youre
trying to do all of you
youre trying to make me think im insane
i have seen this before
its not uncommon
some deepseated childhood
trauma rises to the surface
something a patient has been running from
their entire life
in your case
i would say misplaced guilt
over the death of your father
how do you know about that
i never told you that
you didnt have to
thats why you came to us isnt it
i saw him
pembroke is dead
thats what this is all about
the evil doctor killing off his patients
thats right
all right perhaps we should
consult mr pembroke
do you know this man
he tried to take me back against my will
pembroke
please keep him away from me
you were dead
do you wish press charges
that wont be necessary
mr lockhart is not a criminal
he is a patient
to the members of the board
you sent me here for a purpose
to retrieve a man against his will
and bring him back to your world
but i realize now
that is not the reason i am here
there is a sickness inside each of us
we do our best to deny its existence
dealing in lies
and distraction
until one day the body
rebels against the mind
and screams out
i am not a well man
a man cannot unsee the truth
a man cannot unsee the truth
he cannot willingly return to darkness
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight
any more than he can be unborn
fuck
hannah
stay away from me
hannah
stay away from me
we need to go
i said stay away
there everything is all right
please enjoy your meal
hannah
what have you done
whats happening to me
here here here
its all right youre safe now
leave her alone
havent you upset her enough
mr lockhart
please escort the patient
back to his room
i am not a fucking patient
come on
come on
had enough of cripples and old people
try it with me
thats enough mr lockhart
i can see youre extremely upset
why dont you come with me to my office
and we can discuss
whatevers on your mind
no
were gonna talk about it right here
in front of everybody
i dont think thats a good idea
hes making you sick
this place is making you sick
its in the water
mr lockhart
i saw the bodies dried up like mummies
look at you people
your teeth are falling out
youre dying and you cant even see it
but im here for the cure
there is no cure
dont you see
hes the one that is making you sick
theres nothing wrong with you people
i wouldnt do that if i were you
theres nothing wrong with you
yes
yes
thats it
stand up
come on
yes
stand up
he is making you sick
yes thats it come on
thats it
theres nothing wrong with you
i am not well
i am not well
what are you doing
what are you doing
get the fuck off me
no no no
get off me
help me help
pembroke
pembroke
what have they done to you
done to me
ive never felt better
relax mr lockhart
itll all be over soon
ah yes remarkable creatures
anywhere else on the planet
this species lives a dozen years at most
here in our aquifer
they can live 300
for the human physiology
the effect of the water can be quite toxic
as you have discovered
unless of course
it is properly filtered
the baron devised the process
using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land
he managed to distill the water
to its lifegiving essence
of course he paid
a terrible price for his ingenuity
his only mistake
was to use subjects who were unwilling
luckily times have changed
the last 200 years
have been the most
productive in human history
man rid himself of god
of hierarchy of everything
that gave him meaning
until he was left worshiping
the empty altar of his own ambition
that is why they come
men like you
youre quite right mr lockhart
no one ever leaves
what you fail to understand
is that no one wants to
do you know what the cure
for the human condition is
disease
because only then
is there hope for a cure
i dont understand
for so many years
ive tried to protect you
from the impurities of the outside world
but ironically it is
your friend mr lockhart
who we have to thank
youre a woman now
but im not well
and i will always be here
to take care of you
shes awake now
you made me believe
i could leave here one day
why would anybody wanna leave
what is it
come
what is this place
this is where you began
i dont want to
you know
you look just like she did
on her wedding night
the night they took her from me
the villagers cut out the fetus
and threw it in the aquifer
the child survived
please dont
dont be frightened
soon well be a family again
the way we were always meant to be
its all right
my sister was also
somewhat resistant at first
but after a while she grew to like it
we tried so many times
to make something pure
that something was you my love
and now
we can begin again
ive waited so long
so long
he will have you yes
yes
you cant keep her here forever
no
and what do you think would
become of her in your world
people like you come to me in droves
with your disposable lives
shes your daughter
and what have you ever loved hmm
what have you ever sacrificed
this is what the outside world has to offer
youre right
no
no
fire fire
everything i have built has been for her
you think i would let someone
like you destroy that
dad
hannah
magnificent isnt it
lockhart
its time to go
are you okay
jesus christ
easy easy
lockhart
my god
what have you done
wheres pembroke

you came here to perform a task remember
now get in the car
