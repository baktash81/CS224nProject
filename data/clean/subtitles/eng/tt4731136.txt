a leveraged equity position in cisco 
then i want you to take everything out of
first national and move it over to banyon 
wait  you mean delaware 
i thought that was dead 
that s resurrected 
we need to clean up the
reynolds account   
in case those fucks at aml
decide to do their job 
are you sure about this 
nothing on email 
move everything back on monday 
you paying attention 
yeah  yeah  i am 
  tickets 
  i don t know if   
i m sending the numbers through now 
what about green 
uh  stall him  i don t give a shit 
call in sick if you have to 
business or pleasure 
i don t know  i just   
seriously 
look  i don t know
if i feel comfortable   
josh  josh  stop being such a pussy 
just do what i tell you to do 
and call me when it s done 
to my fellow members of the board 
a man cannot unsee the truth 
he cannot willingly return to darkness   
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight   
any more than he can be unborn 
we are the only species
capable of self reflection 
the only species
with the toxin of self doubt
written into our genetic code 
unequal to our gifts  we build 
we buy  we consume 
we wrap ourselves in the illusion
of material success 
we cheat and deceive as we claw our way   
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement 
superiority to other men 
corner office 
who d you have to blow 
i heard he closed the reynolds account 
how exactly did you do that 
just that good  i guess 
don t forget about us little people 
oh  how could i 
you know how i take my coffee 
excuse me  but they wanna see you
upstairs in the partners boardroom 
tell them i ll be right there 
oh  and tomorrow
is your mother s birthday 
get her something for me  would you 
of course 
there is a sickness inside us 
rising like the bile that leaves that
bitter taste at the back of our throats 
it s there in every one of you
seated around the table 
we deny its existence until one day
the body rebels against the mind   
and screams out 
 i am not a well man  
no doubt you will think
only of the merger 
that unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions 
but the truth cannot be ignored 
for only when we know what ails us
can we hope to find the cure 
i will not return 
do not attempt to contact me again 
sincerely  roland e  pembroke 
well  mr  lockhart   
what do you make of that 
clearly  he s lost his mind 
our thoughts exactly 
man goes for a two week spa vacation 
and has a complete mental breakdown 
who the hell takes the waters
in the 21 st century anyway 
i trust you understand the sensitivity
of some of the information in that letter 
so it s true 
a merger of this kind will make us   
one of the biggest financial service firms
on the eastern seaboard 
something that stands to
enrich everyone in this room 
including you 
we hear good things 
your work on the reynolds
account was inspired 
of course  the sec will want
unfettered access to our books 
any irregularities are sure to come out 
you didn t really think
we wouldn t find out 
i don t know what you re talking about 
you think there s a trick
you can pull we haven t tried 
this is amateur 
can i ask you something  mr  lockhart 
you ever have a 12 inch
black dick in your ass 
prison  mr  lockhart 
you re in a lot of trouble 
if that were the case 
you would have already turned me in 
so  my guess is the sec
is after someone a little more senior 
someone on the board  perhaps 
or someone who s clearly unstable 
we d like you to go to switzerland
and bring mr  pembroke back to us 
you see   
the merger cannot go through
without mr  pembroke signing off   
on certain legal matters 
i don t have the relationship
with mr  pembroke that morris had 
fuck morris 
now  morris was a good salesman 
dependable family man 
god rest his soul 
but he didn t have vision 
someone has to take responsibility 
josh  it s me again 
in an hour and a half  the nikkei closes 
when it does  i want you to empty
banyon and buy puts in glenco 
i m sending the details over now 
and fucking call me back 
i don t like leaving messages like this 
you re here for the cure 
no  i m just visiting 
you mind 
go ahead 
you re younger than most of my passengers 
do a lot of driving for the sanitarium 
all the driving 
every week  i pick up
rich people from the train   
and take them up the mountain 
only rich people  huh 
must be expensive 
well  wealthy people
have wealthy problems 
me  i m happy with a simple life 
that s it  no ambition 
just drive people
up and down the mountain 
most people tend to stay 
why s that 
i guess they like it there 
oh  shit 
i don t go in for spas
and that kind of thing 
i work for a living 
like my father before me 
a son learns what it is to
be a man from his father 
am i right 
i wouldn t know 
i didn t grow up with my father 
how long will you be gone 
just a few days  it s business 
you don t look well 
i m fine  i just haven t been
sleeping much 
you need to rest 
you know  i always
told your father to rest   
but he wouldn t listen 
he was weak 
you didn t know him 
and whose fault is that 
so  are you happy here 
are they taking good care of you 
people come here to die 
why would i be happy 
i m getting a promotion 
so  when i get back
i ll be able to move you
to somewhere better 
somewhere near the beach or something 
you won t come back 
of course i will 
another ballerina 
she s not like the others 
why s that 
she lives in a dream 
but she s dancing 
that s because she doesn t
know she s dreaming 
friendly bunch 
yeah 
there s always been bad blood
between the villagers
and the people on the hill 
why s that 
history 
how old is this place 
foundations date back
to the time of the barons 
for centuries  all this land
and everyone in it   
belonged to one family 
the von reichmerls 
what happened to them 
hmm  interesting story 
apparently  the last baron
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline   
he decided only his sister
was clean enough to carry his child 
when the church forbade
the union  he renounced god 
that must have gone over well 
no shit 
so on his wedding night   
the villagers came up the hill   
chased the baron and his bride
into the catacombs   
and made him watch
while they burned her alive 
then they burned
the whole place to the ground 
that s a hell of a story 
yeah 
but that was 200 years ago 
a lot s changed since then 
20 minutes max 
no hurry 
welcome 
may i help you 
i m here to see a guest 
mr  roland pembroke 
i m sorry  but visiting hours
are over for the day 
i ve come a long way 
maybe you could make an exception 
there are no exceptions 
is there a manager i could speak to 
sign here 
please 
thank you  mr  lockhart 
i ll see what i can do 
you won t get any service here 
part of the treatment 
you get used to it 
what s a ten letter word for amnesty 
no idea 
exemption 
nope  that s only nine 
absolution 
yes 
you like puzzles 
not really 
you mind 
thank you 
i believe the reception nurse explained   
that visiting hours end
at 3 00 p m  precisely 
she did  but as i m sure you re aware   
mr  pembroke remains the ceo
of a major financial institution 
under the circumstances 
i was hoping you can make an   
exception 
vitamins 
if we are to help the people
that come here   
we must keep up our strength 
may one ask what it is concerning 
it s a business matter 
i m not at liberty to say
any more than that 
of course  and i hope you understand
that we also have our rules 
our treatments here are most effective   
when exposure to the stresses
of the modern world is strictly limited 
director volmer is quite firm on that 
hydrotherapy 
that is correct 
that s a long way to come just for water 
the sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer   
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities 
rebuilt 
after the fire 
yes 
history is full of darkness 
if you would like to leave a note   
i d happily pass it along to mr  pembroke 
mr  pieterson 
i understand the work
you do here is important   
and you re obviously a very busy man 
but if you wouldn t mind
finding time between
administering aqua aerobics
and jacuzzis   
to inform mr  pembroke he has a visitor   
with information of the utmost
urgency to him personally   
i d be grateful 
on the other hand  if you
want me to write a note   
so you can slip it under his door
with his breakfast tray   
on the off chance he notices it
before his morning rubdown   
i m afraid that s not gonna cut it 
you see  i just traveled
4 000 miles to get here 
there s a red eye going back
to new york tonight   
and i intend mr  pembroke
and i to be on it 
you plan to take mr  pembroke
back to new york with you 
is that a problem 
of course  it is entirely
up to mr  pembroke 
he s a patient  not a prisoner 
he ll be in treatment until after 7 00 
if you d like to come back then 
i ll make sure he s available 
thank you for your understanding 
leaving already 
what a nice looking young man 
where s your friend 
what time s the last train to zurich 
not till 10 00 
get me to a hotel  i gotta make a call 
pretty girl 
what the fuck 
how long will you be gone 
just a few days 
are we waiting for someone else 
there is no one else 
sleep well 
uh   
i can t remember having slept better 
it s the mountain air 
mr  lockhart   
my name is henrich volmer 
i am the director of the sanitarium here 
how long have i been here 
three days 
oh  jesus 
you can count yourself lucky 
it was a clean break 
although i do feel partly responsible 
the locals tell me i should hunt
the deer on the property   
but i can t bring myself to harm
the innocent creatures 
after all  they were here long before us 
i need to call new york 
i took the liberty
of informing your office
of the accident  if that s your concern 
they agreed with me   
that business can wait
and your health cannot 
hank green said that 
even the acting head
of a major wall street finance firm   
can t argue with the consequences
of a serious car accident 
we don t get many visitors here 
most of my patients have done
extraordinary things 
built vast fortunes   
commanded great empires   
but at a terrible cost 
they have no one who cares for them 
mr  pembroke is lucky 
he has you 
so  do your best to relax 
enjoy yourself 
you are at the foot of the swiss alps   
one of the most
beautiful places in the world 
think of it as an enforced vacation 
although i know you americans
are not so good at vacations  are you 
and remember  you re at altitude 
it can take a while to acclimatize   
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water 
believe me  you re in good hands 
are you lost 
uh    yeah 
i guess so 
where is it you re supposed to be 
i don t know 
name 
pembroke 
roland pembroke 
here it is 
pembroke  room 609  steam bath 
of course 
mr  pembroke   
the steam baths are in that direction 
you can t go in there 
not like that 
pembroke 
it is mr  pembroke  isn t it 
do i know you 
my name is lockhart  mr  green sent me 
i thought they d send morris 
morris is dead 
heart attack 
mr  pembroke  i ve come to
bring you back to new york 
you want me to leave here 
just for a few days 
i m afraid i can t do that 
why not 
i m not well 
you look all right to me 
that s because you are blind 
as i was 
but soon you ll see 
rest assured 
they ll take good care of you here 
i m not a patient 
what happened to your leg 
mr  pembroke  the situation in new york
is really quite serious 
no longer my concern 
the director says
i must not involve myself
in business matters 
have you met director volmer 
this morning 
he is a great man 
kind man 
not like other doctors 
mr  pembroke   
this obsession with blood 
you see  they have it all wrong 
do you know the body is 65  water 
it s our fluids that must be purified 
word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked 
the share price is in free fall 
lockhart 
you re not any relation
to henry lockhart  are you 
my father 
you knew him 
we started out together 
terrible  what happened to him 
they said there was a boy left in the car 
i don t remember much  to be honest 
he didn t deserve what we did to him 
what do you mean 
he was an honest man 
and we destroyed him for it 
well  people get fucked over every day 
either you have what it takes
to survive  or you don t 
and i suppose you do 
is that why you came all this way 
ambition 
then you have it worse than any of us 
what s that 
the sickness 
your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us 
the pointlessness of the entire endeavor 
we ve all done terrible things 
so many terrible things 
what s it trading at 
what 
the stock  what s it trading at 
eight and a half at close on friday 
parasites 
it ll be lower by now 
we re all concerned for your
well being  mr  pembroke 
mmm 
just a few days 
there are certain irregularities
in some of the accounts   
that need to be clarified before
the merger can be completed 
and i suppose someone
has to take responsibility 
something like that 
then i better get my things 
i need a car to take me to the station 
will you call one for me  please 
i ll see what i can do 
that s where the baron hung the priest 
  what s that 
  see 
the church would have been
right over there   
where that funny little building is now 
i m sure of it 
people used to come from miles around   
for the miracles attributed
to the holy water 
guess some things don t change 
how marvelous 
terrible thing  though  such violence 
that s what you get
for marrying your sister 
sister 
yeah  it was all about
a pure bloodline  wasn t it 
how fascinating 
i must look into that 
glad to see you re back on your feet 
we heard about the accident 
you re american  aren t you  mister   
lockhart 
frank hill  stockholm 
and this is mr  nair from london 
bombay  originally 
i see you ve met mrs  watkins 
our amateur historian 
yes  of course  how rude 
victoria watkins  40 years at xerox 
why don t you pull up a chair 
we need a fourth 
careful  like most brahmins  he cheats 
coming from a venture capitalist 
i take that as a compliment 
actually  i was just on my way back
to new york with mr  pembroke 
then he s   
he s feeling better 
well enough 
i suppose that s wonderful news 
isn t that right  mr  nair 
wonderful news 
mrs  watkins   
time for your treatment 
yes  of course 
pleasure to meet you  mr  lockhart 
safe travels 
something in the water 
at the bottom 
i don t see anything 
did it hurt 
can t remember 
better that way 
i saw you 
before 
are you a patient here 
it s just  you re so much younger
than everyone else 
director volmer says i m a special case 
what about you 
are you here for the cure 
no 
actually  i was just leaving 
no one ever leaves 
what are you talking about 
why would anyone want to 
yeah  i see your point 
did you get what you came for 
well  i came to bring
someone back to new york 
so  yeah  i did 
does he want to go 
not really 
that song you were singing 
where did you learn that 
i have to go now 
what s your name 
hannah 
mr  pembroke 
where s pembroke 
the patient that was
in this room  where is he 
i thought you were pembroke 
do you know what they used to recommend
for the common stomach ailment 
the application of leeches 
based on the diagnosis 
i always pitied the leech 
mmm  mr  lockhart   
please  won t you join us 
the sturgeon is excellent 
unless of course you prefer the venison 
i couldn t let it go to waste 
where s pembroke 
mr  pembroke has unfortunately
taken a turn for the worse 
i fear your conversation
about business matters   
has set him back somewhat 
but  no matter  we have moved him on
to the next stage of treatment 
he looked all right to me 
but you re not a doctor 
maybe it s time for a second opinion 
that  of course  is up to mr  pembroke 
and he s not available 
ever since i got here   
you people have been
giving me the runaround 
i would ask you please
to keep your voice down 
we wouldn t wanna upset
the clientele  would we 
mr  lockhart  giving you the runaround
is the furthest thing from my mind 
my sole concern is for
the welfare of my patients 
it s bad for business if
people start getting better 
am i right 
what are you implying  mr  lockhart 
old people paying through
the teeth for what  water 
what s your overhead anyway 
that is not your concern 
i don t wanna have to
get lawyers involved   
but i came to get pembroke
back to new york   
and that s what i m gonna do 
if i have to hit him over his head   
and drag him out by his hair 
are you feeling all right 
mr  lockhart  you seem pale 
i m fine 
you re bleeding 
what 
perhaps you should sit down 
no signs of concussion 
any headaches  hallucinations 
no 
you may dress 
are you drinking the water 
yes 
good 
make sure you do 
i took the liberty of running a few tests
after the accident 
hannah 
isn t it 
yes 
she s a very special case 
what does that mean exactly 
she was exposed to serious trauma
when she was very young 
her development was delayed 
hannah did not utter a word
until she was 11 years old 
please understand   
mr  lockhart   
she is like a daughter to me 
but we re here to discuss you 
an imbalance in your fluids 
strain to the major organs 
depleted immune system 
many indicators that you have in common
with most of my patients   
but i will confess
i have never seen a case   
as advanced as this   
in someone so young 
is that right 
tell me  mr  lockhart   
when was the last time
that you actually felt well 
before you came here 
when was the last time   
that you even slept through the night 
the mind may lie   
but the body cannot 
i should like to help you 
what we offer here   
is a simple process of purification 
away from pressures of the modern world 
a return to a simpler time 
mr  pembroke will not be ready
to travel for a day or two 
and if you re willing   
i would like to recommend a treatment 
i can speak to the duty nurse   
and we may be able to start
as early as this evening 
if you think it s necessary 
good 
greta 
greta 
you re in luck  mr  lockhart 
we can get you in right away 
 vr  
von reichmerl 
it was found during the reconstruction 
then it belong to the baron 
the baroness  actually 
vanessa von reichmerl 
she was sickly 
the baron was obsessed
with finding a cure 
it was he  in fact  who first discovered
the medicinal properties of our water 
he sacrificed everything 
he must have loved her very much 
yes 
like a sister 
history is right  of course 
to judge him on moral grounds 
but  as a man of science   
i can t help but admire him 
the duty nurse will escort you
to our isolation wing 
thank you 
mr  lockhart   
if you wouldn t mind 
just so we can keep an eye
on your progress 
are you ready  mr  lockhart 
then let us begin 
life on this planet first came from water 
we spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged   
our bodies mostly liquid 
this sensory deprivation chamber
simulates a return   
to that embryonic state 
think of it as a cleansing of the mind   
as much as the body 
some patients experience
increased heart rate   
visions   
even primal memories 
but rest assured 
it s just the toxins leaving the system 
give yourself over completely
to the process   
and you will see the results 
keep a close eye on him 
yes  sir 
mr  lockhart   
the treatment lasts 30 minutes 
i ll be monitoring you from here 
if you have any issues   
just tap on the side of the tank 
get back 
in the last five days  a total collapse 
the dow plunging over 508 points   
as panic spread throughout wall street   
wiping out more than
one third of the gains   
from this rare  five year bull market 
more than half of that
in a single trading day 
chairman of new york
stock exchange  john phelan   
tried to reassure investors 
dad 
dad 
mr  lockhart  are you all right 
get off me 
try to stay calm 
i m terribly sorry 
something must have
gone wrong with the machine 
there s something in the water 
there s something in the fucking water 
there is nothing in the water 
mr  lockhart 
but i saw them 
as the director explained   
some patients experience visions
with this particular treatment 
just the toxins leaving the body 
it s all part of the cure 
you need to rest now 
i will help you to your room 
got you 
morning  lockhart 
feeling better 
joining us for breakfast 
the kedgeree is excellent 
i m not hungry 
you must keep up your strength 
mrs  watkins 
that building where the church
used to be   
what s it used for now 
i couldn t say 
you were right about
the baron and his sister 
but that s not the reason
the villagers burned the place down 
it was on account of the experiments 
some sort of medical experiments 
apparently performed on his own peasants 
people went missing 
and then   
im jahre 1814   
farmers  tilling their fields 
stumbled on human bodies   
disfigured and emaciated 
dried up like the mummies of egypt 
he was looking for a cure 
  a cure 
  for the baroness 
she was sick 
oh  i see 
i knew you liked puzzles 
of course 
mrs  watkins   
time for your treatment 
are you certain 
i just had one this morning 
i m sure of it 
i have you on the schedule 
i must not be feeling myself today 
there is a terrible darkness here 
what is this place 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
i thought i saw you with a patient 
no  patient 
okay 
thank you 
going for a swim 
i m not supposed to 
why s that 
on the account of my condition 
thought the water made you better 
told you  i m a special case 
right 
how far is it to town 
a few miles  i think 
are you going to walk all the way 
unless you wanna lend me your bike 
what will you give me 
it was my mother s 
her eyes are closed 
yeah  she s dreaming 
she just doesn t know it 
what happens if she wakes up 
i don t know 
my mother never finished the story 
so  we got a deal 
how will you ride it 
maybe you could come along 
i m not supposed to 
you always do what you re supposed to do 
it s okay 
coming 
want a beer or something 
i don t know  do i 
i don t know what you want 
all right  if you re having one 
still here 
thought you were just visiting 
you ve looked better 
same to you 
how s the car 
that car was a piece of shit 
sanitarium offered me enough
to buy a new one 
so  gracias a dios 
everything happens for a reason  right 
you drink too much 
i hope you re not driving 
you two are from up on the hill 
that s right 
we don t get many patients down here 
good kids at heart 
just weren t raised properly 
no respect for tradition 
know if there s a doctor in town 
all the doctors are up on the hill 
a pharmacist 
something like that 
there s pieter  over the road 
he a doctor 
close enough 
don t you like it 
no 
what  you never had a beer before 
how long have you been at the sanitarium 
since i can remember 
what about your family 
my mother died in a fire when i was young 
director volmer says that
my father will come for me
when i m better 
does he visit 
he ll come when i m better 
  vitamins 
  mmm hmm 
can i try 
um   
okay 
ugh 
tastes like sweaty seafood 
you get used to it  eventually 
will you be okay here for a few minutes 
i just have to go see about something 
but i won t be long 
uh    yeah  okay 
hello 
do you know if there s a doctor here 
what s that you re drawing 
he won t talk to you 
doesn t know how 
that s the castle   
when they burned it down 
my grandson  wilmosh 
he likes ghost stories 
what can i do for you 
could you take a look at this 
tell me what it says 
human 
that s right 
not my line 
i ll pay you 
how much is this 
not much 
but enough 
got a tampon 
my friend s time of the month 
freak 
so is he fit to travel 
he s not a well man 
some of those are
dental records  aren t they 
  that s right 
  what do they mean 
his teeth are falling out 
what could cause something like that 
barring any pre existing
condition  i d say   
chronic dehydration 
dehydration 
all they do up there is drink water 
i m not a doctor 
now  if you ll excuse me   
wait a second 
the baron s experiments 
they found bodies in the fields  right 
dried up like mummies 
maybe there s some kind of connection 
the baron was burned alive
on his wedding night 200 years ago 
yeah  but this is happening now 
people come here for the cure 
that s what the baron was looking for 
his wife was sick 
she wasn t sick 
she was infertile 
they tried for years 
but the baroness could not
carry a child to term 
they say her body rejected the fetuses
because they were deformed 
now  you must excuse me 
i have to put this animal
out of its misery 
what s wrong with it 
wandered off where
it wasn t supposed to be 
broke its leg 
like you 
found it trapped in a drainage ditch   
drinking sewage water 
i need to make a phone call 
long distance 
your credit card 
lockhart 
mr  green 
where the hell have you been 
i have a question 
did pembroke have
any pre existing conditions 
what are you talking about

no  the guy is a fucking health nut 
drank kale for christ s sake 
now what the fuck is going on 
you were supposed to be here
four days ago 
yeah  but there was an accident 
what accident

they said they called you 
nobody called

lockhart  do i have to reiterate to you   
the importance of what

and you with it  understand me 
lockhart 
lockhart

i am not a patient 
hannah 
hannah 
she may look like a woman   
but she s just a child 
ignorance  mr  lockhart   
is the great enemy of science 
i wanna see pembroke 
and you will 
coming  mr  lockhart 
nothing happened 
that s because i arrived when i did 
lockhart was there 
with a knife to his throat 
hannah   
mr  lockhart is not able
to look after himself 
let alone you 
he can t protect you the way i can 
i don t need protecting 
of course you do 
we were just having fun 
he s not like the others 
he s young 
what 
  what is it 
  nothing 
  let me see 
  no 
i m your doctor  come here 
no  don t touch me 
when will i be ready 
soon 
when 
patience 
come here 
i said  come here 
now  haven t i always looked after you 
soon  i will make you better 
and you will thank me 
and my father will come 
yes 
get some rest  my little lamb 
bitte 
i have a problem with my   
may i 
i ll just pop it in some milk  shall i 
there we are 
mrs  watkins 
where s pembroke 
you took him 
back to new york 
what  no 
they moved him  he s down here somewhere 
you told me about
the experiments  remember 
your puzzle 
i like puzzles 
yeah 
i left it for you 
you ll see 
listen to me 
the experiments   
i think they re happening again 
the baroness was infertile 
not experiments 
a cure 
she was pregnant the night of the wedding 
before they burned her   
the villagers cut out the fetus   
and threw it in the aquifer 
the child survived 
she doesn t know 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
take it easy 
marcus 
it s all right 
mr  lockhart   
every time i turn around 
you re somewhere
you re not supposed to be 
i guess i m lost 
i m just trying to find
my way back to my room 
this is a restricted floor 
there are signs everywhere 
surely you didn t just wander
down here by accident 
what is it exactly that
you are looking for 
i had a problem with my tooth 
your tooth 
actually  it s feeling much better 
if you could just point me
in the direction of my room 
nonsense 
we can t let you get an infection 
you must let us take care of you 
after all   
that s why you re here 
doctor brennan takes care
of all our patients  dental needs 
i m sorry 
hmm 
about hannah 
it won t happen again 
hmm 
tell me   
what were you doing in town 
just having a beer 
ah  hmm 
what are you doing 
get your hands off me 
it s all for your own safety 
mr  lockhart 
we don t believe in chemical
anesthesia at the institute 
the impurities inhibit the cure 
but  you will find that
with a proper focus   
the mind can overcome any amount of pain 
trust  mr  lockhart  hmm 
i mean  if we can t trust each other   
then how can i help you 
mrs  abramov   
so glad that you are here 
how long do we have you with us 
just two weeks 
i probably overpacked 
nonsense 
you ll be surprised
how time just slips away
here at the institute 
drive 
what happened to your face 
just drive 
they held me down and pulled my tooth out 
they threatened me 
why would they do that 
because i know what they ve done 
there is a room full of bodies
floating in tanks like specimens 
these are very serious allegations 
no shit 
director volmer is a well respected man 
the sanatorium is of great importance
for the local economy 
take me up there 
and i ll show you what i saw 
do you have any identification on you 
no  they have everything 
well  then  is there someone
i could speak to   
who might confirm you are
who you say you are  family 
i hope you understand the need
to verify your identity 
you can call my office 
all right 
can i get you coffee or tea 
you got anything stronger 
of course 
rest assured   
we will get to the bottom of this 
thank you 
mr  lockhart 
we ve been worried about you 
stay away from me 
is this man a patient of yours 
yes  that s right 
i m not a patient  i was in an accident 
you signed the admission form 
i have it right here 
that s bullshit 
i did warn you about
possible delusions  remember 
a side effect of the toxins
leaving the body 
and my leg  is that a delusion 
mr  lockhart has been a disruptive element
since he arrived 
he stole confidential medical files   
assaulted a member of our dental staff   
and threatened mr  pembroke 
i didn t threaten anybody 
i believe your exact words were   
 if i have to  i ll hit him over the head
 and drag him out by his hair  
i was sent here to bring
pembroke back to new york 
according to your employer  a mr  green   
you re being investigated
by the securities and exchange commission 
you re one of them 
listen to yourself  mr  lockhart 
you re not a well man 
stop saying that 
  let us help you 
  get back 
i know about the experiments 
the baron and his wife 
he has been spending time
with mrs  watkins 
who is watkins 
she was institutionalized
before she came to us 
the others humor her   
but clearly mr  lockhart s condition
has made him susceptible
to her conspiracies 
i know what you re
trying to do  all of you 
you re trying to make me think i m insane 
i have seen this before 
it s not uncommon 
some deep seated childhood
trauma rises to the surface   
something a patient has been running from
their entire life 
in your case   
i would say misplaced guilt   
over the death of your father 
how do you know about that 
i never told you that 
you didn t have to 
that s why you came to us  isn t it 
i saw him 
pembroke is dead 
that s what this is all about 
the evil doctor killing off his patients 
that s right 
all right  perhaps we should
consult mr  pembroke 
do you know this man 
he tried to take me back against my will 
pembroke 
please keep him away from me 
you were dead 
  do you wish press charges 
  that won t be necessary 
mr  lockhart is not a criminal 
he is a patient 
to the members of the board   
you sent me here for a purpose 
to retrieve a man against his will   
and bring him back to your world 
but i realize now   
that is not the reason i am here 
there is a sickness inside each of us 
we do our best to deny its existence   
dealing in lies   
and distraction 
until one day the body
rebels against the mind
and screams out   
 i am not a well man  
a man cannot unsee the truth 
a man cannot unsee the truth 
he cannot willingly return to darkness   
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight   
any more than he can be unborn 
fuck 
hannah 
stay away from me 
  hannah 
  stay away from me 
  we need to go 
  i said stay away 
there  everything is all right 
please enjoy your meal 
hannah 
what have you done 
what s happening to me 
here  here  here 
it s all right  you re safe now 
leave her alone 
haven t you upset her enough 
mr  lockhart 
please  escort the patient
back to his room 
i am not a fucking patient 
come on 
come on 
had enough of cripples and old people 
try it with me 
that s enough  mr  lockhart   
i can see you re extremely upset 
why don t you come with me to my office   
and we can discuss
whatever s on your mind 
no 
we re gonna talk about it right here 
in front of everybody 
i don t think that s a good idea 
he s making you sick 
this place is making you sick 
it s in the water 
mr  lockhart 
i saw the bodies dried up like mummies 
look at you people 
your teeth are falling out 
you re dying  and you can t even see it 
but i m here for the cure 
there is no cure 
don t you see 
he s the one that is making you sick 
there s nothing wrong with you people 
i wouldn t do that  if i were you 
there s nothing wrong with you 
yes 
yes 
that s it 
stand up 
come on 
yes 
stand up 
he is making you sick 
yes  that s it  come on 
that s it 
there s nothing wrong with you 
i am not well 
i am not well 
what are you doing 
what are you doing 
get the fuck off me 
no  no  no 
get off me 
help me  help 
pembroke 
pembroke 
what have they done to you 
done to me 
i ve never felt better 
relax  mr  lockhart 
it ll all be over soon 
ah  yes  remarkable creatures 
anywhere else on the planet 
this species lives a dozen years  at most 
here  in our aquifer   
they can live 300 
for the human physiology   
the effect of the water can be quite toxic
as you have discovered 
unless  of course 
it is properly filtered 
the baron devised the process 
using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land   
he managed to distill the water   
to its life giving essence 
of course  he paid
a terrible price for his ingenuity 
his only mistake   
was to use subjects who were unwilling 
luckily  times have changed 
the last 200 years
have been the most
productive in human history 
man rid himself of god   
of hierarchy  of everything
that gave him meaning   
until he was left worshiping
the empty altar of his own ambition 
that is why they come 
men like you 
you re quite right  mr  lockhart 
no one ever leaves 
what you fail to understand
is that no one wants to 
do you know what the cure
for the human condition is 
disease 
because only then
is there hope for a cure 
i don t understand 
for so many years 
i ve tried to protect you   
from the impurities of the outside world 
but ironically  it is
your friend mr  lockhart
who we have to thank 
you re a woman now 
but i m not well 
and i will always be here
to take care of you 
she s awake now 
you made me believe
i could leave here one day 
why would anybody wanna leave 
what is it 
come 
what is this place 
this is where you began 
i don t want to 
you know   
you look just like she did
on her wedding night 
the night they took her from me 
the villagers cut out the fetus
and threw it in the aquifer 
the child survived 
please don t 
don t be frightened 
soon we ll be a family again 
the way we were always meant to be 
it s all right 
my sister was also
somewhat resistant  at first 
but after a while  she grew to like it 
we tried so many times
to make something pure 
that something was you  my love 
and now   
we can begin again 
i ve waited so long 
so long 
he will have you  yes 
yes 
you can t keep her here forever 
no 
and what do you think would
become of her in your world 
people like you come to me in droves
with your disposable lives 
she s your daughter 
and what have you ever loved  hmm 
what have you ever sacrificed 
this is what the outside world has to offer 
you re right 
no 
no 
fire  fire 
everything i have built has been for her 
you think i would let someone
like you destroy that 
dad 
hannah 
magnificent  isn t it 
lockhart 
it s time to go 
  are you okay 
  jesus christ 
easy  easy 
lockhart 
my god 
what have you done 
where s pembroke 
he s gone 
what do you mean  gone  
get in the car 
you came here to perform a task  remember 
now get in the car 
did you hear what i said
