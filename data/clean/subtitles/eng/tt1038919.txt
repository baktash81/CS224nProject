ah 
you know 
woodward bernstein style  yeah 
that way  you can knock it out
just that much faster 
plus  it would give us a little time
to reconnect in our  uh  relationship 
stewart  we are not in a relationship 
we made out one time
at the christmas party 
i was very drunk 
and i was heartbroken 
i would ve made out with terry

well  yeah  i m actually  uh    i m
actually kind of in the middle of something 
but you know what 
while i have you on the phone   
if you were gonna
jump off a building 
would you choose the side
with trees 
or would you choose the side
that s a straight shot to the cement 
well  the trees would certainly be
prettier on the way down 
kind of a nice last picture 
but it might break your fall 
and you could end up as a vegetable 
and i don t think i could
take that on right now 
so the cement 
definitely  why do you ask 
well  i m on a rooftop at 6th and
rivington  and i was wondering   
now  you listen here  young lady 
  you have every right to hate your life
