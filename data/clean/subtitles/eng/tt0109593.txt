something wrong

excite

embarrassing
pierre dangerous man
selfish allconsuming
liked meet elena dark places
could see others face
hands became aware others presence
lingering warmest curves
knowing touch places skin softest
passion intimate
elena sometimes wondered real
figment imagination
imagination real
dont frightened
desire imperative unexpected
could wait
learned hasty departures restaurants
wild drives curtained taxicabs
breasts undulated like waves hands
painfully awake
sensitive aware
body began tremble

semen came inside
mixed
like little waves breaking sand
one rolling
moaning breathing heavily
awakes experienced little death
dazzling little death
drug alcohol could give
first word
word made flesh
feel growing immediacy work
take inside
let become part
live perpetual expectancy
broken veils flesh
cushions protect nerves
effect delirium
brief stolen
come away pieces sticking
late night
cant sleep
skin tingles thought
lie bed
feel pressing weight
entering
sometimes image powerful
wake scent
see
wealthy woman
lust unknown
shes interested men shes never seen
never see
husband devotes life satisfying caprices
pleasure comes watching
pleasure comes knowing shes watched

report missing person
ive working
cant seem stop pouring
im writing way ive always wanted
addictive cant get enough
breath night comes warning
devouring twilight air
prowling shadows calling
girl
elena invaded sleep
see men stories
look faces women pass
feel excitement
dare take
given world
first time hear voice
im consumed emotion fear excitement
white heat hunger
fascist wore heavy worn belt
came undone snap
using instrument submission
wrapped around elenas wrist
drew
dared run
elena stood ground
great sadness washed elena
despair ever felt
rolling core
gathering force waiting explode
alarmed delighted
discover darkness lurks inside imagination
another surprise
another layer revealed
whats happened
hitler invaded belgium holland
massing borders
world around turning dark
world around turning dark
elena could see
elena could see
instead allowed
led still deeper unknown
secret place
opium smokers went seek release
indulge desire dreams
leila sings different way
tears serenity shreds
spreads anxiety regret
nostalgia everywhere
shh
kissed kissing became torture
body grew restless
time stretched elongated
could see things parts
nothing whole
elena felt drifting sleep
last thing remember thinking
locked inside women
secret place fantasies born
understood
quest find secret place
delta venus quest permanence
desire forever linked hidden part
