the same thing every time 
 i m through  never again 
too dangerous  
i know that s what i always say 
i m always right too 
  you forget about it in a day or two 
  the days of me forgetting are over 
the days of me remembering
have just begun 
you know  when you go on like this 
what you sound like 
  i sound like a sensible fuckin  man 
  you sound like a duck 
  quack  quack  quack 
  take heart   cause you re never
gonna have to hear it again 
since i m never gonna
do it again  you re never
gonna have to hear me quack 
  after tonight 
  correct  i got all tonight to quack 
  can i get anyone more coffee 
  oh  yes 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
i mean  the way it is now 
you re takin  the same risk
as when you rob a bank 
takin  more of a risk 
banks are easier 
federal banks ain t supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery 
they re insured  why should
they give a fuck  i don t even
need a gun in a federal bank 
heard about this one bloke  he walks
into a bank with a portable phone 
he gives the phone to a teller 
the bloke on the other end says 
 we got this guy s little girl  
 if you don t give him all your
money  we re gonna kill her  
  did it work 
  fuckin  right it worked 
that s what i m talkin  about 
knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone  not a pistol 
not a shotgun  a fuckin  phone 
  cleans the place out 
they don t lift a fuckin  finger 
  did they hurt the little girl 
there probably never was
a little girl  the point of
the story isn t a little girl 
the point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone 
  you want to rob banks 
  i m not saying i wanna rob banks 
i m illustrating if we did  it d be
easier than what we ve been doing 
  no more liquor stores 
  what ve we been talkin  about 
yeah  no more liquor stores 
besides  it ain t the giggle
it used to be  there s too many
foreigners own liquor stores 
vietnamese  koreans 
don t even speak fuckin  english 
you tell  em empty out
the register  they don t know
what you re talkin  about 
they make it too personal 
  we keep on  one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him 
  i m not gonna kill anybody 
i don t want to either 
but they ll probably put us
in a situation where it s us or them 
and if it s not the gooks 
it s these old fuckin  jews who ve owned
the store for 15 fucking generations 
you got grandpa irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking magnum in his hand 
try walkin  into one of those places
with nothing but a phone 
see how far that gets you 
forget it 
  we re out of it 
  well  what then  day jobs 
  not in this life 
  what then 
garçon  coffee 
this place 
garçon means boy 
this place 
a coffee shop 
what s wrong with that 
nobody ever robs restaurants 
why not 
bars  liquor stores 
gas stations  you get your head
blown off stickin  up one of them 
restaurants  on the other hand 
you catch with their pants down 
they re not expectin  to get robbed 
not as expectin  anyway 
  i bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this 
  correct 
same as banks 
these places are insured 
manager 
he don t give a fuck 
they re just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin  the diners 
waitresses  fuckin  forget it 
no way they re takin  a bullet
for the register 
busboys  some wetback gettin 
paid  1 50 an hour   
really give a fuck
you re stealin  from the owner 
customers sittin  there
with food in their mouths 
they don t know what s goin  on 
one minute  they re havin 
a denver omelet  the next  someone
is stickin  a gun in their face 
see  i got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up  remember 
  all the customers kept comin  in 
  yeah 
you got the idea
of takin  their wallets 
now  that was a good idea 
  thank you 
  made more from the wallets
than we did from the register 
  yes  we did 
  a lot of people come to restaurants 
  a lot of wallets 
  pretty smart  huh 
pretty smart 
i m ready  let s do it 
right now  right here 
  come on 
  all right  same as
last time  remember 
you re crowd control 
i ll handle the employees 
  i love you  pumpkin 
  i love you  honey bunny 
everybody be cool 
this is a robbery 
any of you fucking pricks move 
and i ll execute
every motherfuckin  last one of you 
     jungle boogie

  okay  so tell me again
about the hash bars 
  okay  what you want to know 
  hash is legal there  right 
  it s legal  but it ain t 100  legal 
you just can t walk into a restaurant 
roll a joint and start puffin  away 
i mean  they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places 
  those are hash bars 
  yeah  it breaks down like this 
it s legal to buy it 
it s legal to own it 
and if you re the proprietor
of a hash bar  it s legal to sell it 
it s illegal to carry it 
but but that doesn t matter 
 cause get a load of this 
if you get stopped by a cop
in amsterdam  it s illegal
for them to search you 
  i mean  that s a right the cops
in amsterdam don t have 
  oh  man  i m goin  
that s all there is to it 
i m fuckin  goin  
i know  baby 
you d dig it the most 
  but you know what the funniest thing
about europe is 
  what 
it s the little differences 
i mean  they got the same shit
over there that they got here 
  but it s just there 
it s a little different 
  example 
you can walk into a movie theatre
in amsterdam and buy a beer 
and i don t mean just like no paper cup 
i m talkin  about a glass of beer 
and in paris  you can buy
a beer in mcdonald s 
you know what they call   
a quarter pounder
with cheese in paris 
they don t call it
a quarter pounder with cheese 
they got the metric system 
they wouldn t know what the fuck
a quarter pounder is 
  what do they call it 
  they call it a royale with cheese 
  royale with cheese 
  that s right 
what do they call a big mac 
big mac s a big mac 
but they call it le big mac 
le big mac 
  what do they call a whopper 
  i don t know  i didn t
go into burger king 
  you know what they put on french fries
in holland instead of ketchup 
  what 
  mayonnaise 
  goddamn 
  i seen  em do it  man 
they fuckin  drown  em in that shit 
  yuck 
we should have shotguns
for this kind of deal 
  how many up there 
  three or four 
  that s countin  our guy 
  not sure 
  so that means that it could be
up to five guys up there 
  it s possible 
we should have
fuckin  shotguns 
  what s her name 
  mia 
  mia  how did marsellus and her meet 
  i don t know 
however people meet people 
she used to be a actress 
oh  really 
she do anything i d have seen 
  i think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot 
  pilot  what s a pilot 
  well  you know the shows on tv 
  i don t watch tv 
yeah  but you are aware that there
is an invention called television 
  and on this invention
they show shows  right 
  yeah 
the way they pick tv shows is they make
one show  that show s called a pilot 
then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows   
and on the strength of that
one show  they decide if
they wanna make more shows 
some get chosen and
become television programmes 
some don t  become nothin  
she starred in one of the ones
that became nothing 
you remember
antwan rockamora 
half black  half samoan 
used to call him  tony rocky horror  
  yeah  maybe  fat  right 
  i wouldn t go so far as to
call the brother fat 
i mean  he got a weight problem 
what s a nigger gonna do  he s samoan 
  i think i know who you mean 
what about him 
  marsellus fucked him up good 
word  round the campfire is
it was on account of
marsellus wallace s wife 
  so what he d do  fuck her 
  no  no  no  no  no  nothin  that bad 
  well  then what then 
  he gave her a foot massage 
a foot massage 
  that s it 
  mm hmm 
then what d marsellus do 
sent a couple cats over to his place 
they took him out on his patio 
threw his ass over the balcony 
nigger fell four stories 
he had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass 
like a greenhouse 
nigger fell through that 
since then  he kind of
developed a speech impediment 
  that s a damn shame 
  hmm 
  but still  you play
with matches  you get burned 
  what do you mean 
you don t be givin  marsellus wallace s
new bride a foot massage 
you don t think he overreacted 
antwan didn t expect marsellus
to react the way he did 
but he had to expect a reaction 
it was a foot massage 
a foot massage is nothin  
i give my mother a foot massage 
it s laying your hands in a familiar way
on marsellus s new wife 
i mean  is it as bad as eatin 
her pussy out  no  but it s
the same fuckin  ballpark 
whoa  stop right there 
eatin  the bitch out   
and givin  the bitch a foot massage
ain t even the same fucking thing 
  it s not  it s the same ballpark 
  ain t no fuckin  ballpark neither 
now  look  maybe your method
of massage differs from mine 
but touchin  his wife s feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies   
ain t the same fuckin  ballpark 
it ain t the same league 
it ain t the same fuckin  sport 
  foot massages don t mean shit 
  have you ever given a foot massage 
don t be tellin  me about foot massages 
  i m the foot fuckin  master 
  you given a lot of them 
shit  yeah 
got my technique down and everything 
i don t be ticklin  or nothin  
would you give a guy
a foot massage 
  fuck you 
  you give  em a lot 
  fuck you 
  you know  i m kind of tired 
i could use a foot massage 
  yo  yo  yo  man 
you best back off 
i m gettin  a little pissed here 
  this is the door 
  yeah  it is 
what time you got 
7 22 in the a m 
no  it ain t quite time yet 
come on  let s hang back 
look  just  cause i wouldn t give no man
a foot massage don t make it right   
for marsellus to throw
antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin  house 
fuckin  up the way the nigger talks 
that shit ain t right 
motherfucker do that shit to me 
he better paralyse my ass 
 cause i kill the motherfucker 
i ain t sayin  it s right 
but you sayin  a massage don t mean
nothin   i m sayin  it does 
now  look  i ve given a million
ladies a million foot massages 
and they all meant somethin  
we act like they don t 
but they do  that s what s
so fuckin  cool about them 
there s a sensuous thing goin  on   
where you don t talk about it 
but you know it and she knows it 
fuckin  marsellus knew it  and antwan
should ve fuckin  better known better 
that s his fuckin  wife  man 
this ain t a man with a sense
of humour about this shit 
you know what i m sayin  
it s an interestin  point 
come on 
let s get into character 
  what s her name again

ezekiel 25 17 
 the path of the righteous man   
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish   
and the tyranny of evil men  
 blessed is he who 
in the name of charity and goodwill 
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness 
for he is truly
his brother s keeper   
and the finder
of lost children  
 and i will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance   
and furious anger   
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers  
 and you will know
my name is the lord   
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee  
i think you gonna find   
when all this shit
is over and done   
i think you re gonna find yourself

marsellus said
you just got back from amsterdam 
  sure did 
  how long were you there 
just over three years 
i go there about once a year
to chill out for a month 
no kiddin  
i didn t know that 
why would you 
i heard you did a pilot 
  that was my 15 minutes 
  what was it 
it was a show about a team of female
secret agents called fox force five 
  what 
  fox force five 
fox  as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks 
force  as in we re a force
to be reckoned with 
and five  as in there s
one two three four five of us 
there was a blond one 
sommerset o neal  she was the leader 
the japanese fox
was a kung fu master 
the black girl
was a demolition expert 
french fox s speciality was sex 
  what was your speciality 
  knives 
the character i played 
raven mccoy 
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers 
according to the show 
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife 
and she knew
a zillion old jokes 
her grandfather 
an old vaudevillian  taught her 
and if we would have got picked up 
they would ve worked in a gimmick   
where every show
i would ve told another joke 
you know any of them old jokes 
well  i only got the chance to say one
 cause we only did one show 
  tell me 
  it s corny 
don t be that way 
tell me 
  no  you wouldn t like it 
and i d be embarrassed 
  you d be embarr   
you told 50 million people 
and you can t tell me 
  i promise i won t laugh 
  that s what i m afraid of  vince 
that s not what i meant 
you know it 
now i m definitely not gonna tell you
 cause it s been built up too much 
what a gyp 
martin and lewis 
vanilla coke 
mmm  yummy 
you think i could
have a sip of that 
be my guest 
i gotta know what
a five dollar shake tastes like 
  you can use my straw 
i don t have cooties 
  yeah  but maybe i do 
cooties i can handle 
all right 
goddamn  that s a pretty
fuckin  good milkshake 
  told ya 
  i don t know if it was worth  5 
but it s pretty fuckin  good 
  don t you hate that 
  hate what 
uncomfortable silences 
why do we feel it s necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable 
i don t know 
that s a good question 
that s when you know
you found somebody really special 
when you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence 
well  i don t think we re quite
there yet  but don t feel bad 
we just met each other 
i ll tell you what 
i m gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose 
you sit here   
and think of something to say 
i ll do that 
okay 
i said goddamn 
goddamn 
goddamn 
i need some hair spray 
mmmm 
don t you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you 
we re lucky
we got anything at all 
i don t think buddy holly s
much of a waiter 
maybe we should ve sat
in marilyn monroe s section 
  which one  there s two monroes 
  no  there s not 
that is marilyn monroe 
that is mamie van doren 
i don t see jayne mansfield 
so she must have the night off 
  pretty smart 
  yeah  i got my moments 
  so did you think of somethin  to say 
  actually  i did 
however   
you seem like
a really nice person  and i   
  i don t want to offend you 
  oooh 
this doesn t sound like
the usual  mindless  boring 
gettin  to know you chitchat 
this sounds like you
actually have somethin  to say 
well  well  i do  i do 
  but you have
to promise not to be offended 
  no  no 
you can t promise somethin  like that 
i have no idea what you re gonna ask me 
you can ask me what you re gonna
ask me  and my natural response
could be to get offended 
then  through no fault of my own 
i would have broken my promise 
  let s just forget it 
  that s an impossibility 
trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility 
  is that a fact 
  and besides 
  isn t it more  uh  exciting
when you don t have permission 
  all right  all right 
well  here goes 
what did you think about
what happened to antwan 
  who s antwan 
  tony rocky horror  you know him 
  he fell out of a window 
  hmm  hmm 
well  that is one way to say it 
another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out 
another way would be
he was thrown out by marsellus 
yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by marsellus because of you 
  is that a fact 
  no 
no  it s not a fact  it s just what
i heard  that s just what i heard 
  who told you 
  they 
 they  talk a lot  don t they 
they certainly do 
they certainly do 
  don t be shy  vincent 
what else did  they  say 
  i m    i m not shy 
  um   
  did it involve the  f  word 
no  no  no  no  no 
they just said that antwan
had given you a foot massage 
  and 
  and    and nothin  
that s it 
you heard marsellus   
threw tony rocky horror
out of a fourth story window
for giving me a foot massage 
  mm hmm 
  and you believe that 
well  at the time
i was told it sounded reasonable 
marsellus throwing tony out
of a fourth story window   
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable 
no  it seemed excessive 
but that doesn t mean it didn t happen 
i understand that marsellus
is very protective of you 
a husband being protective
of his wife is one thing 
a husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife s feet is something else 
but did it happen 
only thing antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it    at my wedding 
really 
truth is  nobody knows why marsellus
threw tony out that window   
except marsellus and tony 
when you little scamps get together 
you re worse than a sewing circle 
ladies and gentlemen  now the moment
you ve all been waiting for 
the world famous
jackrabbit slim s twist contest 
now  this is where
one lucky couple   
will win this handsome trophy

  come on 
   it was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well  
  you could see that pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle  
  and now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell  
  c est la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell  
  they furnished off an apartment
with a two room roebucks sale  
  the  coolerador was crammed
with tv dinners and ginger ale  
  but when pierre found work
the little money comin 
worked out well  
  c est la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell  
  they had a hi fi phono
and boy did they let it blast  
  seven hundred little records
all rock  rhythm and jazz  
  but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell  
  c est la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell  
  they had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well  
  you could see that pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle   
is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence 
i don t know
what you call that 
  drinks  music 
i m gonna take a piss 
that s a little bit more information

i can keep a secret if you can

  butch 
one more thing  and we ll start for   
  butch  stop watching tv for a second 
  yeah 
  you ve got a special visitor 
  stand up  stand up 
now  do you remember when i told you
your daddy died in a p o w  camp 
well  this here is captain koons 
he was in the p o w  camp
with daddy 
hello  little man 
boy  i sure heard
a bunch about you 
see  i was a good friend
of your dad s 
we were in that hanoi
pit of hell together   
over five years 
hopefully   
you ll never have to
experience this yourself 
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were   
for as long as we were 
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other 
if it d been me who d   
not made it 
major coolidge d be talking right now
to my son jim 
but the way it turned out 
i m talking to you 
butch   
i got something for ya 
this watch i got here   
was first purchased
by your great grandfather
during the first world war 
it was bought in a little general store
in knoxville  tennessee 
made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches 
up  til then  people just
carried pocket watches 
it was bought
by private doughboy erine coolidge   
on the day he set sail for paris 
this was your
great grandfather s war watch 
and he wore it every day
he was in that war  and   
when he d done his duty 
he went home to your great grandmother 
took the watch off 
put it in an old coffee can 
and in that can it stayed   
until your granddad  dane coolidge 
was called upon by his country   
to go overseas and fight
the germans once again 
this time they called it
world war ii 
your great grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck 
unfortunately  dane s luck
wasn t as good as his old man s 
dane was a marine 
and he was killed   
along with all the other marines
at the battle of wake island 
your granddad was facing death 
he knew it 
none of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive 
so three days before the japanese
took the island 
your granddad asked
a gunner on an air force transport 
name of winocki   
a man he d never met before
in his life   
to deliver to his infant son 
who he d never seen in the flesh 
his gold watch 
three days later  your granddad
was dead  but winocki kept his word 
after the war was over 
he paid a visit to your grandmother 
delivering to your infant father
his dad s gold watch 
this watch 
this watch was on your daddy s wrist
when he was shot down over hanoi 
he was captured 
put in a vietnamese prison camp 
he knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch 
it d be confiscated 
taken away 
the way your dad looked at it 
this watch was your birthright 
he d be damned if any slope s
gonna put their greasy  yellow
hands on his boy s birthright 
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something    his ass 
five long years
he wore this watch up his ass 
then he died of dysentery   
he give me the watch 
i hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years 
then   
after seven years 
i was sent home to my family and   
now   
little man 
i give the watch to you 
it s time  butch 
in the heavyweight division 
  in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks 
weighing 210 pounds 
floyd ray wilson 
it s official  it s official 
  wilson is dead 
  well  dan 
that had to be the bloodiest 
hands down  the most brutal fight
this city s ever seen 
coolidge was out of there
faster than i ve ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring 
  do you think he knew wilson was dead 
  my guess would be yes 
i could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing 
  i think any man would ve
left the ring that fast 
  do you feel this tragedy   
is gonna affect
the world of boxing 
a tragedy like this can t help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations 
it s of paramount importance 
during the sad weeks ahead 
the eyes of the w b a  remain   
man  you know i didn t   
  marsellus 
  no  it wasn t  i didn t do it 
i didn t do it 
  how you doing 
  great 
i never thanked you
for dinner 
  what you got 
  he booked 
  his trainer 
  says he don t know nothin  
i believe him 
  i think butch surprised
his ass same as us 
  no  we don t wanna  think  
we wanna know  take him to
the kennel  sic the dogs on his ass 
we ll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don t 
butch s search   
how do you want it done 
i m prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker 
if butch goes to indochina  i want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice   
ready to pop a cap in his ass 
i will take care of it

okay  my brother 
you re right 
you re goddamn right 
all right  scotty  next time i see you 
it ll be on tennessee time 
cool  brother 
 45 60 
and  uh 
here s a little something
for the effort 
now  if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight  what are you gonna say 
the truth 
three well dressed 
slightly toasted mexicans 
bonsoir 
esmarelda villa lobos 
buenas noches  butch 
whew 
keep the light off 
  is that better  sugar pop 
  oui 
hard day at the office 
pretty hard 
got in a fight 
poor baby 
can you make spoons 
you know what 
i was thinkin  about takin  a shower 
  i m stinkin  like a dog over here 
  i like the way you stink 
let me take this jacket off 
  i was looking at myself in the mirror 
  uh huh 
i wish i had a pot 
you were looking
at yourself in the mirror 
and you wish you had some pot 
a pot  
a pot belly 
pot bellies are sexy 
well  you should be happy 
 cause you have one 
shut up  fatso 
i don t have a pot 
i have a bit of a tummy 
like madonna when she did  lucky star  
it s not the same thing 
i didn t know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy 
the difference is huge 
would you like it if i had a pot belly 
no 
pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla 
but on a woman
a pot belly s very sexy 
the rest of you is normal    normal face 
normal legs  normal hips  normal ass   
but with a big 
perfectly round pot belly 
if i had one  i d wear a t shirt
two sizes too small   
to accentuate it 
you think men
would find that attractive 
i don t give a damn
what men find attractive 
it s unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye   
is seldom the same 
if you had a pot belly 
i would punch you in it 
  you d punch me in the belly 
  right in the belly 
ohh  i d smother you 
  i d drop it right on your face
 til you couldn t breathe 
  you d do that 
  yeah 
  promise 
  yeah 
  mmm 
  mmm 
oh 
did you get everything 
  yes  i did 
  good job  sugar pop 
did everything
go as planned 
  you didn t listen to the    ow 
you didn t listen to the radio 
i never listen to your fights 
were you the winner 
i won  all right 
  are you still retiring 
  sure am 
so it all worked out
in the finish 
we re not at the finish yet  baby 
we re in a lot of danger 
aren t we 
if they find us 
they ll kill us  won t they

sorta fits the occasion 
ezekiel 25 17 
 the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides   
by the inequities
of the selfish   
  and the tyranny of evil men  
 blessed is he who  in the name
of charity and good will 
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness 
for he is truly
his brother s keeper   
and the finder
of lost children  
 and i will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance   
and furious anger   
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers  
 and you will know
my name is the lord   
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee  
i m fucked

let s get down
to brass tacks  gentlemen 
if i was informed correctly  the clock
is ticking  is that right  jimmie 
uh  one hundred percent 
  your wife bonnie comes home
at 9 30 in the a m   correct 
  uh huh 
i was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here 
she wouldn t appreciate it much 
  she wouldn t at that 
  that gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta dodge 
which  if you do what i say 
when i say it  should be plenty 
now  you got a corpse
in a car  minus a head 
in a garage  take me to it 
  jimmie 
  uh huh 
do me a favour  will ya  thought i
smelled some coffee back there 
  would you make me a cup 
  uh  yeah  sure 
oh  uh  um 
how do you take it 
lotsa cream  lotsa sugar 
about the car  is there anything
i need to know  does it stall 
does it smoke  does it make
a lot of noise  is there gas in it 
  aside from how it looks 
the car s cool 
  positive 
don t get me on the road and i find out
the brake lights don t work 
  as far as i know 
the motherfucker s tip top 
  good enough 
let s go back
to the kitchen 
  here you go  mr wolf 
  thank you  jimmie 
mmm 
okay  first thing 
you two 
take the body 
stick it in the trunk 
this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house 
  that would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit 
  yeah  under the sink 
good  what i need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products   
and clean the inside of the car   
i m talkin  fast  fast  fast 
go in the back seat  scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull 
get it out of there 
wipe down the upholstery 
it don t need to be spick and span 
you don t need to eat off it 
just give it a good once over 
what you need to take care of
are the really messy parts 
the pools of blood that have collected 
you gotta soak that shit up 
we need to raid
your linen closet 
i need blankets 
i need comforters  quilts  bedspreads 
the thicker the better 
the darker the better 
no whites  can t use  em 
we ll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards   
with quilts and blankets 
so if a cop starts stickin 
his big snout in the car 
the subterfuge won t last 
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal 
jimmie  lead the way

you crazy kids 
mr wolf  i just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work 
yeah  really 
and thank you very much  mr wolf 
call me winston 
  you see that  young lady  respect 
  respect for one s elders
shows character 
  i have character 
  because you are a character
doesn t mean that you have character 
  wanna share a cab 
  i d go for some breakfast 
feel like havin  breakfast with me 
cool 
i don t know why  i just thought
he d be european or something 
  yeah  he s about as european
as fuckin  english bob 
  i know that now 
  but was he cool or what 
  thank you 
totally fuckin  cool 
in control 
didn t even really get pissed when you
were fuckin  with him  i was amazed 
  want some bacon 
no  man  i don t eat pork 
  are you jewish 
  i ain t jewish  i just don t
dig on swine  that s all 
  why not 
  pigs are filthy animals 
i don t eat filthy animals 
yeah  but bacon tastes good 
pork chops taste good 
sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie 
but i d never know   
 cause i wouldn t eat
the filthy motherfuckers 
pigs sleep and root in shit 
that s a filthy animal 
i ain t eatin  nothin  ain t got
sense enough to disregard its own feces 
  what about a dog 
dog eats its own feces 
  i don t eat dog either 
yeah  but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal 
i wouldn t go so far
as to call a dog filthy 
but they re definitely dirty 
  but a dog s got personality 
personality goes a long way 
  ah  so  by that rationale 
if a pig had a better personality 
he would cease to be a filthy animal 
  is that true 
  we d have to be talkin  about
one charming motherfuckin  pig 
i mean  he d have to be
ten times more charming than
that arnold on green acres 
oh  man  that s good 
that s good  man 
you re startin  to lighten up 
you ve been sittin  there 
all serious and shit 
  i just been sittin  here  thinkin

  about the miracle we witnessed 
  miracle you witnessed 
  i witnessed a freak occurrence 
  what is a miracle  vincent 
  act of god 
  and what s an act of god 
when  um  god makes
the impossible possible 
but this morning   
  i don t think qualifies 
  hey  vincent 
see  that shit don t matter 
you re judging this shit the wrong way 
it could be god stopped the bullets 
changed coke to pepsi 
found my car keys 
you don t judge shit like this
based on merit 
now  whether or not
what we experienced   
was an according to hoyle miracle
is insignificant 
but what is significant is 
i felt the touch of god 
god got involved 
but why 
well  that s what s fuckin  with me 
i don t know why 
  but i can t go back to sleep 
  you re serious 
you re really thinkin 
about quittin  
  for life  most definitely 
  yeah

well  that s what i been
sitting here contemplating 
first i m gonna deliver
this case to marsellus

  like caine in kung fu 
walk from place to place 
meet people  get in adventures 
and how long do you intend
to walk the earth 
   til god puts me
where he wants me to be

so i don t have to kill your ass 
you read the bible  ringo 
not regularly  no 
well  there s this passage
i got memorized 
ezekiel 25 17 
 the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides   
by the inequities
of the selfish   
and the tyranny of evil men  
 blessed is he who 
in the name of charity and good will 
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness 
for he is truly his brother s keeper
and the finder of lost children  
 and i will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger   
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers  
 and you will know
i am the lord   
when i lay my vengeance
upon you  
i been sayin  that shit for years 
and if you heard it 
that meant your ass 
i never gave much thought
to what it meant 
i just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker   
before i popped a cap
in his ass 
but i saw some shit this morning
made me think twice 
see  now i m thinkin 
maybe it means   
you re the evil man 
and i m the righteous man 
and mr 9 millimetre here 
he s the shepherd   
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness 
or it could mean   
you re the righteous man 
and i m the shepherd 
and it s the world
that s evil and selfish 
now  i d like that 
but that shit
ain t the truth 
the truth is 
you re the weak   
and i m the tyranny
of evil men 
but i m tryin   ringo 
i m tryin  real hard
