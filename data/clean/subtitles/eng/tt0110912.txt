the same thing every time
im through never again
too dangerous
i know thats what i always say
im always right too
you forget about it in a day or two
the days of me forgetting are over
the days of me remembering
have just begun
you know when you go on like this
what you sound like
i sound like a sensible fuckin man
you sound like a duck
quack quack quack
take heart cause youre never
gonna have to hear it again
since im never gonna
do it again youre never
gonna have to hear me quack
after tonight
correct i got all tonight to quack
can i get anyone more coffee
oh yes
thank you
youre welcome
i mean the way it is now
youre takin the same risk
as when you rob a bank
takin more of a risk
banks are easier
federal banks aint supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery
theyre insured why should
they give a fuck i dont even
need a gun in a federal bank
heard about this one bloke he walks
into a bank with a portable phone
he gives the phone to a teller
the bloke on the other end says
we got this guys little girl
if you dont give him all your
money were gonna kill her
did it work
fuckin right it worked
thats what im talkin about
knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone not a pistol
not a shotgun a fuckin phone
cleans the place out
they dont lift a fuckin finger
did they hurt the little girl
there probably never was
a little girl the point of
the story isnt a little girl
the point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone
you want to rob banks
im not saying i wanna rob banks
im illustrating if we did itd be
easier than what weve been doing
no more liquor stores
whatve we been talkin about
yeah no more liquor stores
besides it aint the giggle
it used to be theres too many
foreigners own liquor stores
vietnamese koreans
dont even speak fuckin english
you tell em empty out
the register they dont know
what youre talkin about
they make it too personal
we keep on one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him
im not gonna kill anybody
i dont want to either
but theyll probably put us
in a situation where its us or them
and if its not the gooks
its these old fuckin jews whove owned
the store for 15 fucking generations
you got grandpa irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking magnum in his hand
try walkin into one of those places
with nothing but a phone
see how far that gets you
forget it
were out of it
well what then day jobs
not in this life
what then
garçon coffee
this place
garçon means boy
this place
a coffee shop
whats wrong with that
nobody ever robs restaurants
why not
bars liquor stores
gas stations you get your head
blown off stickin up one of them
restaurants on the other hand
you catch with their pants down
theyre not expectin to get robbed
not as expectin anyway
i bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this
correct
same as banks
these places are insured
manager
he dont give a fuck
theyre just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin the diners
waitresses fuckin forget it
no way theyre takin a bullet
for the register
busboys some wetback gettin
paid 150 an hour
really give a fuck
youre stealin from the owner
customers sittin there
with food in their mouths
they dont know whats goin on
one minute theyre havin
a denver omelet the next someone
is stickin a gun in their face
see i got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up remember
all the customers kept comin in
yeah
you got the idea
of takin their wallets
now that was a good idea
thank you
made more from the wallets
than we did from the register
yes we did
a lot of people come to restaurants
a lot of wallets
pretty smart huh
pretty smart
im ready lets do it
right now right here
come on
all right same as
last time remember
youre crowd control
ill handle the employees
i love you pumpkin
i love you honey bunny
everybody be cool
this is a robbery
any of you fucking pricks move
and ill execute
every motherfuckin last one of you

okay so tell me again
about the hash bars
okay what you want to know
hash is legal there right
its legal but it aint 100 legal
you just cant walk into a restaurant
roll a joint and start puffin away
i mean they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places
those are hash bars
yeah it breaks down like this
its legal to buy it
its legal to own it
and if youre the proprietor
of a hash bar its legal to sell it
its illegal to carry it
butbut that doesnt matter
cause get a load of this
if you get stopped by a cop
in amsterdam its illegal
for them to search you
i mean thats a right the cops
in amsterdam dont have
oh man im goin
thats all there is to it
im fuckin goin
i know baby
youd dig it the most
but you know what the funniest thing
about europe is
what
its the little differences
i mean they got the same shit
over there that they got here
but its just there
its a little different
example
you can walk into a movie theatre
in amsterdam and buy a beer
and i dont mean just like no paper cup
im talkin about a glass of beer
and in paris you can buy
a beer in mcdonalds
you know what they call
a quarterpounder
with cheese in paris
they dont call it
a quarterpounder with cheese
they got the metric system
they wouldnt know what the fuck
a quarterpounder is
what do they call it
they call it a royale with cheese
royale with cheese
thats right
what do they call a big mac
big macs a big mac
but they call it le big mac
le big mac
what do they call a whopper
i dont know i didnt
go into burger king
you know what they put on french fries
in holland instead of ketchup
what
mayonnaise
goddamn
i seen em do it man
they fuckin drown em in that shit
yuck
we should have shotguns
for this kind of deal
how many up there
three or four
thats countin our guy
not sure
so that means that it could be
up to five guys up there
its possible
we should have
fuckin shotguns
whats her name
mia
mia how did marsellus and her meet
i dont know
however people meet people
she used to be a actress
oh really
she do anything id have seen
i think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot
pilot whats a pilot
well you know the shows on tv
i dont watch tv
yeah but you are aware that there
is an invention called television
and on this invention
they show shows right
yeah
the way they pick tv shows is they make
one show that shows called a pilot
then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows
and on the strength of that
one show they decide if
they wanna make more shows
some get chosen and
become television programmes
some dont become nothin
she starred in one of the ones
that became nothing
you remember
antwan rockamora
halfblack halfsamoan
used to call him tony rocky horror
yeah maybe fat right
i wouldnt go so far as to
call the brother fat
i mean he got a weight problem
whats a nigger gonna do hes samoan
i think i know who you mean
what about him
marsellus fucked him up good
word round the campfire is
it was on account of
marsellus wallaces wife
so what hed do fuck her
no no no no no nothin that bad
well then what then
he gave her a foot massage
a foot massage
thats it
mmhmm
then whatd marsellus do
sent a couple cats over to his place
they took him out on his patio
threw his ass over the balcony
nigger fell four stories
he had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass
like a greenhouse
nigger fell through that
since then he kind of
developed a speech impediment
thats a damn shame
hmm
but still you play
with matches you get burned
what do you mean
you dont be givin marsellus wallaces
new bride a foot massage
you dont think he overreacted
antwan didnt expect marsellus
to react the way he did
but he had to expect a reaction
it was a foot massage
a foot massage is nothin
i give my mother a foot massage
its laying your hands in a familiar way
on marselluss new wife
i mean is it as bad as eatin
her pussy out no but its
the same fuckin ballpark
whoa stop right there
eatin the bitch out
and givin the bitch a foot massage
aint even the same fucking thing
its not its the same ballpark
aint no fuckin ballpark neither
now look maybe your method
of massage differs from mine
but touchin his wifes feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies
aint the same fuckin ballpark
it aint the same league
it aint the same fuckin sport
foot massages dont mean shit
have you ever given a foot massage
dont be tellin me about foot massages
im the foot fuckin master
you given a lot of them
shit yeah
got my technique down and everything
i dont be ticklin or nothin
would you give a guy
a foot massage
fuck you
you give em a lot
fuck you
you know im kind of tired
i could use a foot massage
yo yo yo man
you best back off
im gettin a little pissed here
this is the door
yeah it is
what time you got
722 in the am
no it aint quite time yet
come on lets hang back
look just cause i wouldnt give no man
a foot massage dont make it right
for marsellus to throw
antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin house
fuckin up the way the nigger talks
that shit aint right
motherfucker do that shit to me
he better paralyse my ass
cause i kill the motherfucker
i aint sayin its right
but you sayin a massage dont mean
nothin im sayin it does
now look ive given a million
ladies a million foot massages
and they all meant somethin
we act like they dont
but they do thats whats
so fuckin cool about them
theres a sensuous thing goin on
where you dont talk about it
but you know it and she knows it
fuckin marsellus knew it and antwan
shouldve fuckin better known better
thats his fuckin wife man
this aint a man with a sense
of humour about this shit
you know what im sayin
its an interestin point
come on
lets get into character

ezekiel 2517
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who
in the name of charity and goodwill
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brothers keeper
and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
my name is the lord

upon thee

marsellus said
you just got back from amsterdam
sure did
how long were you there
just over three years
i go there about once a year
to chill out for a month
no kiddin
i didnt know that
why would you
i heard you did a pilot
that was my 15 minutes
what was it
it was a show about a team of female
secret agents called fox force five
what
fox force five
fox as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks
force as in were a force
to be reckoned with
and five as in theres
onetwothreefourfive of us
there was a blond one
sommerset oneal she was the leader
the japanese fox
was a kung fu master
the black girl
was a demolition expert
french foxs speciality was sex
what was your speciality
knives
the character i played
raven mccoy
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers
according to the show
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife
and she knew
a zillion old jokes
her grandfather
an old vaudevillian taught her
and if we would have got picked up
they wouldve worked in a gimmick
where every show
i wouldve told another joke
you know any of them old jokes
well i only got the chance to say one
cause we only did one show
tell me
its corny
dont be that way
tell me
no you wouldnt like it
and id be embarrassed
youd be embarr
you told 50 million people
and you cant tell me
i promise i wont laugh
thats what im afraid of vince
thats not what i meant
you know it
now im definitely not gonna tell you
cause its been built up too much
what a gyp
martin and lewis
vanilla coke
mmm yummy
you think i could
have a sip of that
be my guest
i gotta know what
a fivedollar shake tastes like
you can use my straw
i dont have cooties
yeah but maybe i do
cooties i can handle
all right
goddamn thats a pretty
fuckin good milkshake
told ya
i dont know if it was worth 5
but its pretty fuckin good
dont you hate that
hate what
uncomfortable silences
why do we feel its necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable
i dont know
thats a good question
thats when you know
you found somebody really special
when you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence
well i dont think were quite
there yet but dont feel bad
we just met each other
ill tell you what
im gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose
you sit here
and think of something to say
ill do that
okay
i said goddamn
goddamn
goddamn
i need some hair spray
mmmm
dont you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you
were lucky
we got anything at all
i dont think buddy hollys
much of a waiter
maybe we shouldve sat
in marilyn monroes section
which one theres two monroes
no theres not
that is marilyn monroe
that is mamie van doren
i dont see jayne mansfield
so she must have the night off
pretty smart
yeah i got my moments
so did you think of somethin to say
actually i did
however
you seem like
a really nice person and i
i dont want to offend you
oooh
this doesnt sound like
the usual mindless boring
gettintoknowyou chitchat
this sounds like you
actually have somethin to say
well well i do i do
but you have
to promise not to be offended
no no
you cant promise somethin like that
i have no idea what youre gonna ask me
you can ask me what youre gonna
ask me and my natural response
could be to get offended
then through no fault of my own
i would have broken my promise
lets just forget it
thats an impossibility
trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility
is that a fact
and besides
isnt it more uh exciting
when you dont have permission
all right all right
well here goes
what did you think about
what happened to antwan
whos antwan
tony rocky horror you know him
he fell out of a window
hmm hmm
well that is one way to say it
another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out
another way would be
he was thrown out by marsellus
yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by marsellus because of you
is that a fact
no
no its not a fact its just what
i heard thats just what i heard
who told you
they
they talk a lot dont they
they certainly do
they certainly do
dont be shy vincent
what else did they say
im im not shy
um
did it involve the f word
no no no no no
they just said that antwan
had given you a foot massage
and
and and nothin
thats it
you heard marsellus
threw tony rocky horror
out of a fourthstory window
for giving me a foot massage
mmhmm
and you believe that
well at the time
i was told it sounded reasonable
marsellus throwing tony out
of a fourthstory window
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable
no it seemed excessive
but that doesnt mean it didnt happen
i understand that marsellus
is very protective of you
a husband being protective
of his wife is one thing
a husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wifes feet is something else
but did it happen
only thing antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it at my wedding
really
truth is nobody knows why marsellus
threw tony out that window
except marsellus and tony
when you little scamps get together
youre worse than a sewing circle

the little money comin
worked out well
cest la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they had a hifi phono
and boy did they let it blast
seven hundred little records
all rock rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell
cest la vie say the old folks

one more thing and well start for
butch stop watching tv for a second
yeah
youve got a special visitor
stand up stand up
now do you remember when i told you
your daddy died in a pow camp
well this here is captain koons
he was in the pow camp
with daddy
hello little man
boy i sure heard
a bunch about you
see i was a good friend
of your dads
we were in that hanoi
pit of hell together
over five years
hopefully
youll never have to
experience this yourself
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other
if itd been me whod
not made it
major coolidged be talking right now
to my son jim
but the way it turned out
im talking to you
butch
i got something for ya
this watch i got here
was first purchased
by your greatgrandfather
during the first world war
it was bought in a little general store
in knoxville tennessee
made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches
up til then people just
carried pocket watches
it was bought
by private doughboy erine coolidge
on the day he set sail for paris
this was your
greatgrandfathers war watch
and he wore it every day
he was in that war and
when hed done his duty
he went home to your greatgrandmother
took the watch off
put it in an old coffee can
and in that can it stayed
until your granddad dane coolidge
was called upon by his country
to go overseas and fight
the germans once again
this time they called it
world war ii
your greatgrandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck
unfortunately danes luck
wasnt as good as his old mans
dane was a marine
and he was killed
along with all the other marines
at the battle of wake island
your granddad was facing death
he knew it
none of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive
so three days before the japanese
took the island
your granddad asked
a gunner on an air force transport
name of winocki
a man hed never met before
in his life
to deliver to his infant son
who hed never seen in the flesh
his gold watch
three days later your granddad
was dead but winocki kept his word
after the war was over
he paid a visit to your grandmother
delivering to your infant father
his dads gold watch
this watch
this watch was on your daddys wrist
when he was shot down over hanoi
he was captured
put in a vietnamese prison camp
he knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch
itd be confiscated
taken away
the way your dad looked at it
this watch was your birthright
hed be damned if any slopes
gonna put their greasy yellow
hands on his boys birthright
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something his ass
five long years
he wore this watch up his ass
then he died of dysentery
he give me the watch
i hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years
then
after seven years
i was sent home to my family and
now
little man
i give the watch to you
its time butch
in the heavyweight division
in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks
weighing 210 pounds
floyd ray wilson
its official its official
wilson is dead
well dan
that had to be the bloodiest
hands down the most brutal fight
this citys ever seen
coolidge was out of there
faster than ive ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring
do you think he knew wilson was dead
my guess would be yes
i could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing
i think any man wouldve
left the ring that fast
do you feel this tragedy
is gonna affect
the world of boxing
a tragedy like this cant help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations
its of paramount importance
during the sad weeks ahead
the eyes of the wba remain
man you know i didnt
marsellus
no it wasnt i didnt do it
i didnt do it
how you doing
great
i never thanked you
for dinner
what you got
he booked
his trainer
says he dont know nothin
i believe him
i think butch surprised
his ass same as us
no we dont wanna think
we wanna know take him to
the kennel sic the dogs on his ass
well find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he dont
butchs search
how do you want it done
im prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker
if butch goes to indochina i want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice
ready to pop a cap in his ass
i will take care of it

a pot
a pot belly
pot bellies are sexy
well you should be happy
cause you have one
shut up fatso
i dont have a pot

like madonna when she did lucky star
its not the same thing
i didnt know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy
the difference is huge
would you like it if i had a pot belly
no
pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla
but on a woman
a pot bellys very sexy
the rest of you is normal normal face
normal legs normal hips normal ass
but with a big
perfectly round pot belly
if i had one id wear a tshirt
two sizes too small
to accentuate it
you think men
would find that attractive
i dont give a damn
what men find attractive
its unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same
if you had a pot belly
i would punch you in it
youd punch me in the belly
right in the belly
ohh id smother you
id drop it right on your face

sorta fits the occasion
ezekiel 2517
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities
of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brothers keeper
and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
my name is the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee
im fucked

that would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit
yeah under the sink

is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car
im talkin fast fast fast
go in the back seat scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull
get it out of there
wipe down the upholstery
it dont need to be spickandspan
you dont need to eat off it

what you need to take care of
are the really messy parts
the pools of blood that have collected
you gotta soak that shit up
we need to raid
your linen closet
i need blankets
i need comforters quilts bedspreads
the thicker the better
the darker the better
no whites cant use em
well need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards
with quilts and blankets
so if a cop starts stickin
his big snout in the car
the subterfuge wont last
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal

pigs are filthy animals
i dont eat filthy animals

pork chops taste good
sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie
but id never know
cause i wouldnt eat
the filthy motherfuckers
pigs sleep and root in shit
thats a filthy animal
i aint eatin nothin aint got
sense enough to disregard its own feces
what about a dog
dog eats its own feces
i dont eat dog either
yeah but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal
i wouldnt go so far
as to call a dog filthy
but theyre definitely dirty
but a dogs got personality
personality goes a long way
ah so by that rationale
if a pig had a better personality
he would cease to be a filthy animal
is that true
wed have to be talkin about
one charming motherfuckin pig
i mean hed have to be
ten times more charming than
that arnold on green acres
oh man thats good

act of god
and whats an act of god
when um god makes
the impossible possible
but this morning
i dont think qualifies
hey vincent
see that shit dont matter
youre judging this shit the wrong way
it could be god stopped the bullets
changed coke to pepsi
found my car keys
you dont judge shit like this
based on merit
now whether or not
what we experienced
was an accordingtohoyle miracle
is insignificant
but what is significant is
i felt the touch of god
god got involved
but why
well thats whats fuckin with me
i dont know why
but i cant go back to sleep
youre serious
youre really thinkin
about quittin
for life most definitely

so i dont have to kill your ass
you read the bible ringo
not regularly no
well theres this passage
i got memorized
ezekiel 2517
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities
of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who
in the name of charity and good will
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness
for he is truly his brothers keeper
and the finder of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
i am the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon you
i been sayin that shit for years
and if you heard it
that meant your ass
i never gave much thought
to what it meant
i just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker
before i popped a cap
in his ass
but i saw some shit this morning
made me think twice
see now im thinkin
maybe it means
youre the evil man
and im the righteous man
and mr 9millimetre here
hes the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness
or it could mean
youre the righteous man
and im the shepherd
and its the world
thats evil and selfish
now id like that
but that shit
aint the truth
the truth is
youre the weak
and im the tyranny
of evil men
but im tryin ringo
im tryin real hard
