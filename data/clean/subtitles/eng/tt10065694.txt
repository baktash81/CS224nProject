   kennedi giggles 
 kisses  excellent
choice  baby 
yeah  she picked it 
  hi  babe 
  you stay trendin  
   veronica sighs 
  paused it for you 
i understand
you think you are defending
the plight of the black man 
i guess  in your case 
the black woman 
but we are doing a disservice
to the argument 
much less your people   
by conflating race
with basic common sense 
veronica  over video  
i would say this 
the disenfranchisement
of black people in america
is by design 
written into the actual dna
of this country 
your argument 
however flawed
has been successfully promoted
and propagated
through repetition 
we hear it over
and over again 
but i m here to tell you
that this vicious cycle
of inequity
will soon be broken 
  both  boom 
  boom 
  boom 
  nick  boom 
  boom 
   veronica chuckling 
mommy  why was
that man so angry 
oh  baby 
that is a really great question 
 sighs 
sometimes
what looks like anger
is really just fear 
things are not always
what they appear to be  baby 
does that make sense 
do you remember when vanessa
was bullying you at school 
she was pickin  on you 
and mommy had to
come up there
because vanessa thought
that you were gonna
come in class
and take
all of her toys away 
and now you two
are like best friends 
so  are you two
friends yet 
 breathes deeply 
 nick chuckling 
not yet  baby 
mommy s working on it 
pancake 
pancake

   chuckling 
um  question

hi  and please call me veronica 
 chuckles 
how are you this morning 
oh  i m fine 
that lipstick just looks
lovely on you 
it suits your skin tone 
i don t think i could
pull it off   chuckles 
so  do you have
any questions for me 
how did you
come across my work 
oh  i saw you on one of
those legacy media networks 
i believe it was a roundtable
discussion about inclusion 
you were so articulate 
it must have been
a ratings bonanza 
those particular segments
do garner a lot of attention 
i don t mean to be curt 
but do you have any questions
around the book 
oh  your book 
yes  i believe
you mentioned it
on that show that you were on 
as a matter of fact 
i know you mentioned it 
 cause i thought
it was rather odd
that you chose that moment
to be peddlin  your wares 
well  actually 
that particular segment
focused on the lack
of inclusion 
and that is exactly
what my book highlights 
intersectionality of race 
class  and gender 
i wrote
shedding the coping persona
as a road map to revolution
for historically
marginalized people 
maybe i didn t catch
this earlier 
but who did you say
you were with again 
elizabeth 
i didn t mention it 
i m a bit of a talent scout 
oh  so  you re a headhunter 
that makes sense 
i m a headhunter 
 laughing 
exactly that 
oh 
now  is that kennedi 
will you move the camera over 
oh  she s so cute 
she ll make
a perfect little companion
for my daughter 
i see a playdate
in our future 
as my assistant
mentioned earlier 
i am short on time
this morning 
oh  no problem  i didn t
mean to trigger you none 
you have fun at your summit

 the exorcism of
the unconscious past  
 gasps  ah 
 the past is never dead  
 it s not even past  
you know 
my nana used to say 
 our ancestors
haunt our dreams
 to see themselves forward  
the unresolved past
can certainly wreak havoc
on the present

um  let s say around 7 30 
and i m in
the jefferson suite 
sure 
god bless 
elizabeth  oh  shoot 
puddin   i left my key
in the room  do you mind 
 audience cheering 
veronica  you know 
i learned very quickly
that black people 
black women in particular 
we re expected to be seen 
not heard 
or we risk being perceived
as threatening
to the patriarchy 
or  god forbid 
we continue to get branded as
the  angry black woman  
audience  yes 
so  the coping persona has
been this mode of survival
for generations
of oppressed people 
what i also learned
through those experiences
is within our authenticity
lies our real power 
audience  yes 
and that s even
in those environments 
which by design 
demand our complete
and total assimilation 
to the patriarchy  we ve
been practically invisible 
but their arrogance is
their greatest vulnerability 
and our greatest opportunity 
audience  yes 
 audience applauding 
and it brings me to a quote
by assata shakur 
 the only thing
that we have to lose
   are our chains  
   audience applauding 
liberation over assimilation 
they re stuck in the past 
  we are the future 
  audience  yes 
our time is now 
it s now 
right now 
just a reminder 
you can pick up
shedding the coping persona
on your way out 
twenty percent
goes to hbcu schools
including louisiana s own
dillard and southern
universities 
 all cheering 
camille  the way that you
talked to them  the nuance 
and there s a specificity
that i just can t   
dawn  oh  my god 
that was fantastic 
so sorry 
that was really great  you know 
i really enjoyed
my session 
but i m really glad
i stayed for that 
  wasn t that fantastic 
  camille  it was 
  veronica  camille  this is   
  i m sorry  did i interrupt

even from all the way
over there 
that we re actually
drinking champagne tonight 
i am a champagne lady 
and we are champagne ladies 
so  sending over
a vodka cran  yeah 
it just shows
lack of appreciation
for our situation
tonight  so   
well  what you should
have done is
you should have
asked our waiter 
which  again 
champagne we re drinking 
and sent over a second bottle
of it for all of us 
and then  you make eye contact
with me from across the room
