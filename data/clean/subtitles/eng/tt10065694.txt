bastards on their heels
washington in our sights
but we must never relent
we are descendants
of the gods
and we will fight
with the same immeasurable
courage and vigor
we will sacrifice our blood
and fertilize this soil
of our homeland
this is the only hope we have
of retaining our heritage
our way of life
this land
was always ours

rightful inheritance

our nationalist state
will not be stolen from us
by these traitors to america

kennedi exclaims
veronica my favorite girl

winces
veronica well
look at you two
nick look at you
veronica gasps
mommy loves that dress
kennedi giggles
kisses excellent
choice baby
yeah she picked it
hi babe
you stay trendin
veronica sighs
paused it for you
i understand
you think you are defending
the plight of the black man
i guess in your case
the black woman
but we are doing a disservice
to the argument
much less your people
by conflating race
with basic common sense
veronica over video
i would say this
the disenfranchisement
of black people in america
is by design
written into the actual dna
of this country
your argument
however flawed
has been successfully promoted
and propagated
through repetition
we hear it over
and over again
but im here to tell you
that this vicious cycle
of inequity
will soon be broken
both boom
boom
boom
nick boom
boom
veronica chuckling
mommy why was
that man so angry
oh baby
that is a really great question
sighs
sometimes
what looks like anger
is really just fear
things are not always
what they appear to be baby
does that make sense
do you remember when vanessa
was bullying you at school
she was pickin on you
and mommy had to
come up there
because vanessa thought
that you were gonna
come in class
and take
all of her toys away
and now you two
are like best friends
so are you two
friends yet
breathes deeply
nick chuckling
not yet baby
mommys working on it
pancake
pancake
on a tuesday
what is the special occasion

we gotta pick our battles
chuckling
um question
are we vegan this week

is real
got it so one nonvegan
pancake coming up

groans
skype ringtone playing
elizabeth
elizabeth on speakers
yes dr henley
hi and please call me veronica
chuckles
how are you this morning
oh im fine
that lipstick just looks
lovely on you
it suits your skin tone
i dont think i could
pull it off chuckles
so do you have
any questions for me
how did you
come across my work
oh i saw you on one of
those legacy media networks
i believe it was a roundtable
discussion about inclusion
you were so articulate
it must have been
a ratings bonanza
those particular segments
do garner a lot of attention
i dont mean to be curt
but do you have any questions
around the book
oh your book
yes i believe
you mentioned it
on that show that you were on
as a matter of fact
i know you mentioned it
cause i thought
it was rather odd
that you chose that moment
to be peddlin your wares
well actually
that particular segment
focused on the lack
of inclusion
and that is exactly
what my book highlights
intersectionality of race
class and gender
i wrote
shedding the coping persona
as a road map to revolution
for historically
marginalized people
maybe i didnt catch
this earlier
but who did you say
you were with again
elizabeth
i didnt mention it
im a bit of a talent scout
oh so youre a headhunter
that makes sense
im a headhunter
laughing
exactly that
oh
now is that kennedi

oh shes so cute
shell make
a perfect little companion
for my daughter
i see a playdate

god bless
elizabeth oh shoot
puddin i left my key
in the room do you mind
audience cheering
veronica you know
i learned very quickly
that black people
black women in particular
were expected to be seen
not heard
or we risk being perceived
as threatening
to the patriarchy
or god forbid
we continue to get branded as
the angry black woman
audience yes
so the coping persona has
been this mode of survival
for generations
of oppressed people
what i also learned
through those experiences
is within our authenticity
lies our real power
audience yes
and thats even
in those environments
which by design
demand our complete
and total assimilation
to the patriarchy weve
been practically invisible
but their arrogance is
their greatest vulnerability
and our greatest opportunity
audience yes
audience applauding
and it brings me to a quote
by assata shakur
the only thing
that we have to lose
are our chains
audience applauding
liberation over assimilation
theyre stuck in the past
we are the future
audience yes
our time is now
its now
right now
just a reminder
you can pick up
shedding the coping persona
on your way out
twenty percent
goes to hbcu schools
including louisianas own
dillard and southern
universities
