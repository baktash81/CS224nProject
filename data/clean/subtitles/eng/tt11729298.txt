commentator 1  joe montana joins
his teammates on the field 
super bowl 19 
the miami dolphins 
and the san francisco 49ers 
the best combined records of any two
teams to ever meet in a super bowl 
commentator 2  and joe montana 
they talk of the cool of dan marino 
kurt  super bowl 19 
second quarter 
joe montana steps
to the line of scrimmage 
drops back to throw 
and then   
commentator 2  montana in
trouble and doug betters
covers him quickly
at the 42 yard line 
commentator 3  you feel pretty
good  then all of a sudden 
the pocket starts to cave in 
kurt  now this might seem
like a failure  a mistake 
but of all the characteristics
needed to be an all pro quarterback 
this one is
rarely talked about 
the ability to stay
in the pocket 
to stay calm and collected as a wall
of humanity collapses around you 
the courage to stand your
ground and take the hit 
and then have the will to get back
up  and do it all over again 
drop back  settle 
deliver the perfect throw 
 crowd cheering 
commentator 2 
and another record has fallen 
commentator 1 
another one to joe montana 
commentator 2 
falling all over the place

montana fires a shot   
 continues indistinctly 
how much longer 
i want to play some atari 
kurt 
kurt  ever since i saw joe montana
become the mvp of that super bowl
and break his
all time pass record 
i knew i wanted
to be that guy 
kurt  over a million athletes play high
school football every year in america 
each with a dream
of their own 
only about 5  of them
make it to college ball 
and only 1  of those
get drafted to the nfl 
most don t stay in the league
for more than three years 
most are not quarterbacks 
only a select few will ever
play in the super bowl   
and each year 
there is only one mvp of that game 
so  by all accounts 
my dream  my story
is impossible 
that s just
the kind of story this is 
 indistinct shouting

  i dig your tattoo 
  yeah 
semper fidelis 
it s the motto of   
for the marines 
yeah  yeah 
i saw the pictures
on your mantle 
when   
when i was maybe
12  after church   
this woman comes up
to me and says   
 there s something special about
you  brenda  
 god is gonna do
something great with you  
and   
i had the audacity
to believe her 
so  i had this dream of being
a marine and marrying a marine 
and having little
marine children
and god  country 
and corps all the way 
so  i signed up
right outta high school 
wow 
then  i met brad 
my perfect marine 
whirlwind romance 
marriage   
and zack was born
a year later 
kurt  and what happened
to brad 
 brenda sighs  scoffs 
he cheated on me when i was
eight months pregnant with jesse 
oh    what 
so  um   
yeah  i have
some trust issues 
was zack born blind 
no 
he wasn t 
i got this call
from brad
when zack was
four months old 
he said 
 he s breathing funny  
and i still remember
the panic in his voice 
and i rushed
to the hospital   
where we were told
his brain was swelling
and that he d be lucky to
make it through the night 
and they had no idea
what was wrong  cause   
 cause brad didn t tell us 
not for 24 hours   
that he accidentally
dropped zack 
on his head 
in the tub 
oh   
could ve been different  you
know  if he d just told the truth 
 sighs  i remember
praying and praying
and begging god
to just save my baby boy 
so  the doctor told me he d never
walk  and yet   
that he d never talk 
and now 
i can t get him to stop 
that he d never be
a black truck driver 
he keeps finding a way
to prove everyone wrong 
he s   
 inhales deeply 
he s my miracle 
that all seems pretty  uh 
important to you in your life 
religion and god 
yeah  it s more like
a relationship for me   
and  yes  it defines me 
and that lady who came up
and talked to you at church
all those years ago 
you still believe her 
 scoffs  i m trying 
i m a work
in progress
