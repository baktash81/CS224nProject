hey  everybody  this is all of our kill 
we all take credit 
  i got a side ache 
  you hit enmebaragesi 
i m pretty sure he had that
when he left the village 
that s not my spear 
my spear has feathers   
okay  that one s got a feather 
okay  that is my spear 
i m sorry  man 
great  two spears 
twice the killing power 
thanks a lot 
next time don t block my shot 
what  i didn t say   
come on  not my fault 
who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt 
hey  there you are 
i don t think you wanna be gathered 
you wanna be eaten 
hi  marlak 
well  there won t be any berries
in the fruit salad now  so we all lose 
hey  oh  how s it going 
hunters think they re so cool 
you know  they   
they don t think this is challenging 
gathering  it s extremely challenging 
you have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it   
   and put it in the basket 
are they picking on you 
if they re picking on you 
i will straighten them out 
  all right  yeah  would you 
  you re right 
let it slide this time 
next time  though  they will feel the tip
of my short spear 
  what happened to your spear 
  i modified it  made it a snub nose 
it s lighter  it s a better killing tool 
anyway   
oh  there s maya 
i m gonna go talk to her 
i ll be right back 
unless something goes horribly right 
  hello  maya 
  hey  zed 
what do i gotta do
to make you my woman 
look  you re a special guy 
you ve got a lot of personality 
when my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs   
   you really helped me
see the funny side 
 no  no  he s got my ankle  
 get off   that s your mom 
so  yeah  you make me laugh 
but that s not enough 
i m an old fashioned kind of girl 
i need a man who can protect me
and take care of me 
what do you mean 
like marlak 
well  i mean  he is the best hunter
in the village 
  debatable 
  people voted 
maybe i m not the greatest hunter 
  or gatherer 
  yes  or gatherer 
zed  those are the only two jobs
that we have here 
i can take care of you 
does it look like i m starving 
come on 
tell me you can say no to this 
give it a second  let it work on you 
oh  yeah 
absolutely can say no to that 
maya  can i see you later 
i think i have to wash my hair 
you washed your hair last year 
tonight  we feast 
maya  for you 
thanks  marlak 
another severed boar s head 
  it s a different color 
  yeah  this one is   
  left the tongue in 
  yeah  this is really nice  marlak 
look at marlak flirting with maya 
he doesn t know her at all 
head s not even the best part
of the boar 
it s the back fat  stupid 
muscleheaded idiot 
hi  eema  hi  eema  hi  eema 
yeah  she doesn t even know i exist 
there s like 60 people
in the village  i mean   
   you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists 
i just wanna lay with her so badly 
i don t see it  she s cute 
but i don t think i d lay with her 
she s your sister  i mean 
that d be like laying with your mother 
which was a big mistake 
i see that now 
you think it s not gonna be awkward
in the morning  but    trust me  wow 
listen  you wanna impress eema 
do the fertility dance with her   
listen  you wanna impress eema 
do the fertility dance with her   
   at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut 
my hut s a mess right now 
and what if she struggles 
you give her a little tap on the head 
women respond to that 
i still live with my parents 
i don t wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking 
i d get an earful in the morning 
she only likes hunters 
she doesn t like gatherers 
she s a gatherer herself is the irony 
she s a self loathing gatherer 
  that s pretty suggestive 
  i wouldn t read too much into that 
okay  now she s just asking
for some splinters 
hey  hey    squanto 
give me a break  would you 
you got the whole forest 
why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut 
i could be wrong  i think what it is
is that all the poop in the area   
   fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping 
it s not that nobody respects you 
i haven t heard that from everyone 
i ve had it  let s go 
where are we going 
we re not supposed to go this far 
i m sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke 
  you know what i m gonna do 
  change villages 
no  i m gonna change my head 
i don t think that s possible 
your head is attached to your body 
not the whole head 
i mean  my mind 
mind   
don t tell me you re thinking
about eating forbidden fruit 
that s exactly what i m thinking 
zed  that s the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil 
you don t eat from that one 
it s forbidden 
but why is it forbidden 
what is it they don t want us
to have 
it s not the fruit  it s about the rule 
it s about doing what you re told 
we ve been doing what we were told
our entire lives 
  how s that worked out 
  i like doing what i m told 
it gives my day
some much needed structure  wait 
zed  stop 
it s just a piece of fruit 
eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life 
what if it s magic fruit 
what if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known 
that s a pretty low bar 
then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me 
maya would lay with me like that 
that s what this is about 
laying with maya 
i have a great destiny 
i m about to find out what it is 
put the fruit down 
what if somebody sees us 
they ll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill 
now you ve done it 
it s got sort of a knowledge y taste 
does it have a sort of forbidden taste 
that s what it is 
  oh  i definitely feel something 
  what 
less hungry  for one 
but also more intelligenter 
it s like
i feel like maybe i know everything 
ask me something  anything  go 
test me  go 
all right  where does the sun go
at night 
pass  next question 
  okay  where do babies come from 
  pass  next question 
  there s a snake on my foot 
  in the form of a question 
there s a snake on my foot 
  correct 
  what do i do 
i got a lot of ideas  i m bursting
with ideas on the subject 
  it s constricting me 
  you could stick your finger in its hole 
you know what  you could eat it
before it eats you  try that 
eat the snake first 
that s what my new brain tells me 
  it s preparing to eat me 
  go for the eyes 
it s big 
zed  please help me 
i m dying a virgin 
wait right here 
i m gonna go eat more fruit 
  this was a bit of a rough day for me 
  yeah  there s gotta be more to life 
this is a lot  i don t think i can handle
too much more than this 
no way  look at these people 
they re like animals 
we re way too good for this 
now that i m smarter
i m going straight to the top 
i m bringing you 
you re gonna be my right hand 
i ve seen what you do
with your right hand  no 
don t you wonder what s on
the other side of the mountains 
there s nothing on the other side
of the mountains  okay 
the world ends  everybody
knows that  you d fall right off of it 
but what if it doesn t 
it makes my stomach go 
i ve been thinking a lot
ever since i ate that fruit 
why is there fruit  what is fruit 
it s a thing that you eat 
why do we eat 
what are we  what are we 
why do i have these 
everything is weird 
when you really stop and look at it 
everything gets very  very strange   
why am i talking  what is this 
my lips make a movement
and then a sound   
   and you know what i mean 
blows my mind 
that just sounds like crazy fruit talk 
i don t wanna hear it right now 
boy  she looks nice tonight 
do it  man  dance for her 
i don t know 
they re doing the jackal dance 
it s not my strongest 
what  are you kidding me 
you have an amazing jackal dance 
go  jackal dance 
get into it 
over the head 
i m gonna go and eat 
i m gonna come back 
your father was a great hunter 
but you  you re like a little girl 
good one  marlak 
enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden 
really  well  what if i told you
that enmebaragesi was a liar 
i saw him eat the forbidden fruit 
oh  that 
  hey  what s going on here 
  i will kill you where you stand 
oh  a shooting star  that s the best 
  you really ate the fruit 
  one bite  what s the big deal 
you don t eat the fruit 
it s the number one rule
since the beginning of time 
since the great turtle climbed out
of the sea with earth on its back 
i know  but i m a little fuzzy
on the exact details 
forbidden  forbidden fruit 
you ate    you did the one thing
you re not supposed to do  forbidden 
but the word  forbidden  implies
there s a little wiggle room 
there s no wiggle room
with forbidden  you re cursed  man 
if you stay here  we ll all be cursed 
you have to leave 
  where am i supposed to go 
  i didn t eat the fruit 
my hands are tied 
i know i m being a dick right now  man 
but i m just trying to help you 
do i detect a little bit of jealousy
because i now have   
   the knowledge of good and evil
and you don t 
you think it s easy being the shaman
of the village 
you think i like putting on
a boar s head every morning 
putting a bone through my face 
i know we ve known each other for
a long time  we throw the rock around 
we have fun together  man 
but i can t be   
you know what i mean 
plus  wanna know something 
i am high as shit right now  dude 
i just licked like three toads 
i ve been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs 
  okay 
  i just wanna get a meal   
   i wanna take a fucking nap 
  this is bullshit 
you really    you fucked the pooch
on this one 
  hard 
  i say what i did   
   was a good thing 
  oh  yeah 
yeah  really  really very good thing 
and i should know because i have
the knowledge of good and evil 
  oh  okay 
  so i ought to know   
   when i know what i m saying
is what i know what i m saying 
  good 
  and i m not leaving 
you better get out of here 
okay  but before i go 
i just wanna say one thing 
i know i m not the greatest hunter 
  or gatherer 
  or gatherer  thank you 
but there s gotta be more to life
than this 
i m going  but because i choose to 
and anyone who wants to join me
is welcome 
i don t know where we re going 
but i will lead us 
yeah  light up the darkness 
so who s with me 
anyone 
anyone named oh 
okay  looks like
i m gonna be going it alone 
which is fine with me 
better  in fact   
   because having a partner
would just probably slow me down 
i m gonna start a new tribe 
10 times better 
there s gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun 
it s gonna be called muscle tribe
of danger and excellence 
and you re not invited  i don t even like
any of you guys  i never did 
unless anyone changes their mind 
does anyone wanna come 
  we re good 
  fine  good  bye bye 
don t    nobody panic 
no  that s    that s   
oh  it s not my house 
i see you 
go away  marlak 
  really  animal noises 
  badger 
this is just insulting 
it s time i killed you 
fine  but then  tell me this 
who s that behind you 
you think i m gonna turn around 
i m gonna gut you like a pig 
nice whack on the head 
you should try hitting eema that hard 
we can discuss that later 
we should run away 
yes  yes  of course 
so you decided to come after all 
was it the speech 
  it was the fire  i lost everything 
  yeah 
i wish we didn t have to leave 
probably never gonna see
eema again 
that s not true  we ll go back 
those hunters are idiots 
they re gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour 
will you get real  man 
there s no going back  okay 
there s nothing to go back to 
it s just ashes 
like it s hard to build
one of those huts 
it s just a pile of sticks and dung 
well  you re a pile of sticks
and dung 
well  you re a pile of sticks
and dung 
  i m sorry  l   
  it s okay 
  i don t mean that  obviously 
  i know you re mad   
   but this is a great
opportunity for us 
they didn t appreciate you
back there 
you re the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd 
they were all drinking from their
hands 
well  it just seems practical 
i mean  i don t know 
we have an incredible destiny 
you don t even know where we are 
we re lost 
of course i know where we are 
it s a cougar 
don t move a muscle 
  what do we do 
  don t move your lips 
rule number one  show no fear 
you re showing fear 
much better  very good 
  now what 
  there s two opinions on this one 
some say run 
others say stay perfectly still 
  which one are you gonna do 
  i m going to run 
you should put some maggots
on those scratches 
they look pretty deep 
they are very deep 
that s why they appear that way 
  you re still mad at me  aren t you 
  i wish i hadn t come 
maybe you shouldn t have come   
   if you re gonna keep whining
about every little cougar   
   that attacks you 
oh  what does this look like 
you making your own fire 
no  i m making arrows 
we re gonna need them 
  you still coming 
  yeah 
yeah 
yeah  you re my buddy  yeah 
you re saying we re gonna walk   
   and eventually we re gonna get
to a spot where the world ends   
   and it s like    what is it 
what are we looking at 
first of all  why are you talking to me
in that tone like i m an idiot 
this is general knowledge 
  i knew it 
  this is incredible 
you still think the world just ends 
come on  admit it  the fruit man
has the knowledge 
whoa  whoa  be careful 
did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit 
yeah  i can see  like  10 minutes
into the future now 
  so what am i doing in ten minutes 
  you re having sex with a zebra 
  that s not funny 
  i m not joking 
hope you re ready to bone some zeeb 
people  more than one 
walking that way 
you think  there s about
a thousand footprints there 
  i mean  it s kind of obvious 
  oh  yes 
  they stopped here to poop  look 
  no  i don t want to 
two men  maybe three  a child 
or a small woman  maybe 
what are you doing 
you don t know where that s been 
  i know where it s been 
  don t touch it 
you don t know if a squirrel
has peed on it 
still warm 
almost hot in the center 
looks like they had some nuts 
apples  maybe 
what are you doing 
  yep  apples 
  what difference does it make 
that doesn t help us to know that 
you can tell if they ate some shit 
there s a lot of shit in that shit 
my mistake  this is bear poop 
what s that  though 
this one s mine 
tonight  we feast 
we re gonna need
some arrowheads

from the fight 
yeah  yeah  yeah

with his face repeatedly   
   until he just couldn t pull through 
  it was horseplay 
  it was horseplay 
it was two horses playing 
one murders the other one   
yeah  it s probably best if we
didn t mention this accident to anyone 
because  you know 
people don t understand  and   
who am i gonna tell 
i can t think of one
who d be interested 
i d only tell him
and he s a witness as well

what happened 
how did you get here 
after the fire that you started 
the hill tribes raided the village 
they held us captive   
   and traded us to the boat people 
who brought us here 
so it s such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here 
  you think it s a coincidence 
  what do you think 
i m not sure  but i m beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason 
god wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil 
  why would he want that 
  why are we assuming god s a he 
i don t know what to say to that 
you kidding 
anyway  don t you guys see
what i m saying 
why would he choose you 
why wouldn t he choose
someone stronger 
chosen doesn t have to be strong 
i m big like this 
  you have a fat face 
  my brain  it s enormous 
i m smarter than you are 
i don t talk as much 
i m the smartest guy in the village 
i m the smartest guy
that was in the village 
excuse me 
you are interested in some slaves

  this one looks pretty good 
  and her little friend  very good 
  just how i like them 
  hey 
feisty

if we want them 
you have money 
that depends
on what you mean by money 
excuse me 
perhaps i could be of some help here 
you guys  let me deal with this guy 
see if i can work out a deal 
what happened to your forehead

but i don t see the sheep anywhere

the sheep  my son

in a way  in a way 
if this is because i didn t clean up
my tent  i m sorry 
i ll do it right when i get home 
oh  dad  why are you doing this 
the lord has spoken unto me  isaac 
and i must obey him 
if the lord told you to jump off a cliff

yes  as a matter of fact  i am 
  aye  aye  verily  thou art 
  verily  yea 
thou were sent by the eternal one
to stay my hand 
  all of that 
  this is isaac 
and i am abraham  the son of terah
of the house of nahor 
we were two doors down from nahor 
we were nahor s neighbors 
and i am zed  son of zero 
and this is oh  son of ooh
from the house of sticks and dung 
the tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond 
come  come  my friends 
we are the hebrews 
a righteous people 
but not very good at sports 
this way  friends  come 
brothers  brothers 
let us give thanks
unto the lord thy god   
   for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day 
praise be to god 
hallowed be his name 
and let us also praise him   
   for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us 
he hath increased our wealth   
   and blessed us with   
thanks  thank you 
a lot of loving things 
  kind loving kindness 
  yeah 
friends  whence comest thou 
  he wants to know where you re from 
  thou comest not from   
   the cities of the plain 
from sodom and gomorrah 
  heard of them  never been there 
  are they nice 
 are they nice  
they have been cursed for all time
by the lord thy god   
   for their abominations 
  i did not know that 
they worship idols
and they bow down before false gods 
  abdominal 
  it s the worst 
the men of that city
are weak and soft   
   fat with rich food 
intoxicated by strong drink 
i m not hearing the bad part 
the women are whores 
their shameless lust
knows no bounds 
they flaunt their flesh   
   and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth 
which one of the two cities
has the most whores 
just so we know to stay away
from that one especially 
walk you not the path of sodom 
for the lord thy god
has said unto me   
   that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city   
   and all who dwell within
for their iniquity 
he shall smite them 
them  and all of their seed 
so when do you think
this smiting s gonna go down 
  because we have some friends there 
  their fate is sealed 
but for my faith and devotion   
   that self same god   
   has promised unto me
the whole of this land 
from the heights of golan in the north
to the sinai in the south 
from the river of jordan
to the great sea 
  this is all your land 
  for all of eternity 
but apparently god
forgot to tell anyone else 
we re at war with someone
every other day 
excuse me  i and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies   
   by the mighty hand
of god  blessed be he 
  praised is his name   
  unto us 
   and glory his graciousness 
  wealthy bounty 
therefore  to signify my covenant
with the one true god   
   i shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis 
and of you  and you  and of you 
and every male who dwelleth hereby 
  excuse me 
  i don t know what you mean 
we shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises   
   and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh  amen 
i don t think i have any extra 
  couldn t we pierce our ears 
  no  no  no 
so it shall be written 
and so it shall be done 
let me get this straight  you re saying
you have too much cock 
and you wanna 
you know  abe  it s been a long day 
we ve all had a lot to drink   
   and i know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now   
   but you might wanna sleep on it 
we can always cut it off
in the morning 
but if we do it now  there s just no way
to get it back on there 
no  no  no  trust me  it s gonna be
a very  very sleek look 
this is gonna catch on  i m gonna go
get my good knife 
just wait right there  i ll be right back
to cut your penises 
not the whole thing 
you understand  just the very tip 
and after  we re all gonna have wine
and sponge cake 
do you have any idea
where we re going 
going to sodom 
we have to save maya and eema 
he said that god
was gonna smite sodom with holy fire 
god also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick 
dad  no  no  no 
so listen  i ve been thinking 
what constitutes the tip of the penis 
because his definition
might not be the same as mine 
  what if the tip is your favorite part 
  the tip is your only part 
come out here 
hey  you caught me  guilty 
what are you doing here 
  i m gonna come 
  you don t know where we re going 
  you re going to sodom  right 
  no 
how stupid you think i am 
you ve had a boner for sodom   
   since my dad mentioned it 
if i take you  get me some wine 
aren t you a bit young 
do you like hanging out
with this little girl 
my dad just trimmed my dick skin

you wanna kiss me 
like in a romantic way 
by tomorrow morning 
you ll wish you hadn t been born 
  i already feel that way right now

and put your hands on the table

  because thursday s the new friday 
  well  thanks for saving us 
  what are you gonna do to us now 
  excuse me  do i detect a tone here 
you did sell us into slavery 
hold a grudge much 
that was  like  a fortnight ago 
it was less than a fortnight 
half a fortnight 
  it was a sevennight 
  oh  give me a break 
i was dealing with the death   
   of a close  personal family member
and i needed some space 
but hey  now i realize that you guys
are like my real brothers 
and it s so rare to have a brother
that you love and don t wanna kill 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
hey  who s hungry 
  i m hungry 
  don t kill me 
yeah  okay 
excuse me  i was   
yeah  that s two for flinching 
hey  let s go 
here  now we re even 
check out the woman across the way 
she s looking at us 
she s totally eye knowing us
with her eyes right now 
well  she s really making
that banana last 
  go talk to her 
  i kind of have a girlfriend right now 
a girl that i m going to marry 
make my wife  make her my girlfriend
one day when i get enough strength 
what transpires within the confines
of the walls of sodom   
   stays within the confines of the walls
of sodom 
if you guys are gonna stay here 
you should join the guard 
  hey 
  hey  hey what  hey  huh  yeah 
i mean  the pay s not great
but the perks  tons of them 
i m telling you  it s the only way to go 
come on  let s go talk to the sergeant 
  let s go 
  hurry now 
this is great  how do i look 
i can t see  this is too big on me 
i wonder if i can get a smaller size 
yeah  someone s gotta be
the hat person around here 
  find a   
  excuse me 
hey  my helmet is way too big
for me  it looks really silly 
  think i can get a smaller one 
  line up 
  what are you doing  in the line 
  wait  he s not   
in the line  face forward in the line 
  guys  guys 
  i don t know where to   
  guys 
  you too 
  guys 
  find a hole  you stupid bastards 
  it s kind of obvious  isn t it 
  not to me 
soldiers  present arms 
i never got a sword 
i only got the holder 
i didn t know
that that s what it was for 
  so this is it  we just walk around 
  yeah  pretty much 
just look for troublemakers 
if you see a thief or a pickpocket 
we ll slap them around a little bit 
maybe cut off a finger  you know 
or tip of the nose sometimes 
lower lip  just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion 
it seems kind of harsh 
hey  just remember it s the palace
that pays us  not the people  come on 
feed us 
six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain 
majesty  there s talk of revolution
in the streets 
oil and grain are scarce 
prices are high 
starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food 
we could actually have a riot
on our hands 
poverty has a bitter taste 
but it is a flavor they are born to 
it is the will of the gods 
what do the entrails predict 
well  the liver is streaked with gray 
which is not a good sign   
   but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized   
   which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region 
the genitals are enormous 
that s of no significance 
i m just commenting 
if you do look at this intestine   
   his large intestine
is arranged in an arc   
   then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes 
to me  i see a happy face 
that makes me happy 
what does it mean 
well  could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart 
or that you re going
on a long sea voyage 
could i come 
i ve never been on a boat 
how did you become high priest 
i m your brother in law 
perhaps it s time
for a new high priest 
perhaps it s not time
for a new high priest 
let that be a warning to you 
next time  i shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face 
or a fireball 
and you know what s the best part
about sodom  the sodomy 
you guys are in for a treat 
down 
did you see that girl 
that was princess inanna 
she s totally hot 
don t even think about it 
why not 
why  because she s royalty
and you re a caveman 
where s everybody going 
to the temple 
you guys have to see this 
  will she be there 
  yeah  everyone ll be there 
there she is 
the princess isn t eating 
i find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry 
  you can t keep starving yourself 
  why not 
everybody else is starving 
present company excluded 
careful  princess 
you may be my stepdaughter 
but these are dangerous times   
   and those are dangerous words 
  whatever 
hi 
yeah 
  what s happening 
  they re picking a virgin 
oh  please  if you re a virgin 
then i m a fuzzy little gerbil 
back to the whorehouse with you 
quick as a bunny  there you go 
what do they need a virgin for 
  to throw her in the fire  are you new 
  what  why 
an offering to the gods 
  are you serious 
  there s a famine going on   
   so if we make
a good enough sacrifice   
   then the gods give us rain 
you get rain  you get harvest   
   you get harvest  you get food 
you know what food is 
yeah  you know food 
so they re gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains 
where do you think rain
comes from  clouds 
my 6 year old knows 
  hey  how do you get rain 
  burn a virgin 
i didn t think
it was anything related to   
yeah  yeah   i didn t think 
i didn t think  
it s the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned 
did i do something to offend you 
i come here  i get a great seat
at the sacrifice  and you re ruining it 
seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me 
hey  guys  i m trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family 
do you mind  do you mind 
for the love of the gods   
   we commit this fair maiden   
   to moloch s holy fire

true success story

a gift  i don t know 
you ve got some sort of gift 
  good luck 
  look  maya  maya 
come to me 
beautiful  isn t it 
you can see gomorrah
just over the hill 
yep  twin cities 
people think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out   
   because they re so evil 
  and what do you think  am i evil 
well  i don t really know you 
but you don t look evil 
do you find me attractive 
yeah 
let me ask you one thing 
what would a girl like you
want with a guy like me 
i don t know 
i just find you interesting 
they say it s the will of the gods   
   that some men should suffer
while others rule 
that we re all just victims
of our own fate 
i believed that until this morning   
   when i saw you standing up alone
in the square and i said to myself 
 yes  finally  here s one man
who refuses to bow down to anything 
a man with the courage
to question the order of things 
a man chosen by the gods
to do something great  
that s exactly
what i ve been thinking 
you would not believe the stuff
happening to me 
  i just didn t know why 
  i know why 
to bring you here  to this place 
to me 
i could not agree more 
i m trying to agree more  but i can t 
because that s how much i agree 
come 
this must be difficult
for you to understand   
   but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods   
   and the good of the people 
i keep nothing for myself 
  that s very unselfish of you 
  it is unselfish of me  isn t it 
you re so perceptive
for one so young 
  yeah  what are those doors there 
  behind these doors   
   is the holy of holies 
earthly domain of the gods 
a place so ineffably sacred 
so powerful   
   that to enter is instant death 
  who cleans it 
  needs no cleaning 
kind of makes you think
about the people that built it 
like  did they die instantly   
   or were they given
a courtesy second   
   to get out of there by the gods 
they were allowed to finish 
given four and a half seconds   
   then the gods descended 
  what if a bug goes in there 
  instant death for the bug 
are there dead bugs all over 
because nobody cleans it 
they re vaporized immediately   
   by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor 
  can we go in 
  i just told you 
to enter is instant death 
you gorgeous little dunce 
can t even poke our heads in 
you re so young and curious 
aren t you 
you want to know it all
and taste it all  explore it all  be it all   
   dance with it all  suck it all 
don t you 
i ve got a riddle for you 
what has two thumbs   
   and is desperate
for another hot oil rub 
  what 
  this person 
come on  let s go 
  come  come quick 
  that will not be a problem 
what are we doing here 
i want you to enter
the holy of holies 
oh  that is quite a coincidence   
   because i want you to sit
on the poley of poleys 
  oh  no  that s the holy of holies 
  i thought you were talking about   
you have to go in there
and speak to the gods 
  the gods are in there 
  so they say 
the only one who goes in there
is the high priest 
they say it s instant death
for anyone else to enter 
  then why am i going in 
  because you ve been chosen 
if the gods wanted you dead 
they would ve killed you already 
  right 
  this is what you ve been chosen for 
to speak to the gods 
divine their purpose   
   and plead with them
to end this terrible famine 
then come back out
and tell me what it s like inside 
  okay 
  okay 
right 
i m pretty sure i m chosen 
but i m not  sure  sure 
you re chosen 
okay  i m gonna go in 
but you gotta do something for me 
  you gotta let my friends go 
  anything 
don t kill me  don t kill me 
don t kill me   
get up  you look ridiculous 
  oh  what are you doing here 
  i m hiding from the high priest 
i spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him 
is that chest hair 
not all of it  just don t ask  okay 
i ve lost my sense
of right and wrong 
how did you get in here
without getting fried 
  i don t know  how did you 
  because i m a chosen 
probably why god didn t kill you 
he knew you were my follower 
  i m not your follower 
  why are you always following me 
i m not following you  i walk
behind you at the same pace as you 
not following 
i could be leading from the rear 
come on  i m the leader 
i always have been 
some leader 
told us you were gonna get us out 
  just been messing around at orgies 
  messing around at orgies 
no  no  i m not like you 
i don t get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun 
  i have no downtime 
  please  your whole life is downtime 
that s what you think 
that s what everybody thinks 
i m about to show you something 
observe 
almighty god  or gods 
whatever the case may be   
   i need to ask a favor of you 
i know
i ve really messed things up   
   but i really need to come through
on this one   
   and i wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends 
  and that s it  that s the favor 
  oh  shit 
and also 
if you could just make it rain   
   or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin  you know what i mean 
because we need our virgins
at the moment 
and also  if you could give me
the power   
   to see through women s clothing
without them knowing   
   that would be really great 
hello 
hasn t it occurred to you
that it might be silent   
   because god is not in here 
look around  there s nothing in here 
that doesn t prove anything 
maybe he stepped away 
  for what 
  god stuff 
if he needs something 
he can create it from nothing 
what s the point of being god
if you keep running for things 
let me just put something out there 
maybe god doesn t exist 
what  so everything is just random 
then nothing would mean anything 
  what would be the point 
  that is the point 
that there s no point  that s stupid 
  you re stupid 
  no 
  there s something bigger than me 
  there s nothing bigger than you 
  don t touch my belly to make a point 
  fine 
  okay  i m sorry  i have a man s body 
  i m maturing at my own pace 
  you are so jealous of me 
  jealous  that you re a bullshit artist 
that every time you speak 
it s bullshit coming out of your mouth 
you would believe in god
if you ve ever been with a woman 
  i m a virgin by choice 
  not your choice 
  take that back 
  i won t 
  take back what you said 
  take back what you said 
everything you ve ever said 
don t stand close 
get your belly off of my belly 
don t touch my belly 
i don t want to touch bellies with you 
ever 
take everything
you ve ever said back 
  you re out of control 
  you re a freak 
  stop screaming  stop screaming 
  you re a freak  get off me 
i can pull this thing together 
the princess is right out there 
and if i play this right   
   l m gonna get us all out of here 
maya and eema too 
just trust in me  have a little faith 
fine  but not for you  for eema 
and i m too tired to argue right now 
i had a long hot bath with the
high priest  and i m lightheaded 
i m sorry for squeezing you so hard 
let s go  freak 
god  if you do exist 
if you make eema love me   
   i would be very grateful  okay 
if you do exist 
you guys waiting to go in there 
because i gotta say 
not that big a deal 
if you see a broken penis 
it was like that when we went in 
seize him 
i m seized 
i wish i was upside down 
looks kind of fun 
is it fun 
so you re not talking to me 
we re not friends anymore 
after all i ve done for you 
  what have you done for me 
  i brought you out of your shell 
yeah  i liked my shell 
i liked the village 
because of you  i m in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers   
   and they burn women
and they make people slaves 
people cut off
the ends of their penises   
   and their testicles and i m
never gonna see eema again   
   and it s because of you 
please forgive me 
i mean  you are my best friend 
i hate the world  i hate you 
and now i m hanging upside down
and i really have to pee 
i know i m not perfect 
and maybe i made a few wrong turns 
but you gotta understand i m chosen 
that s a lot of responsibility 
you can t even imagine 
the only one that thinks that you re
chosen is you  so shut up already 
i m gonna get us out of this thing
if it s the last thing i do 
that was just my first idea 
i m also accepting ideas 
guard 
the upside down prisoner has to pee 
oh  i m peeing 
oh  no 
try to keep your mouth closed 
oh  no  in the nose 
hey  i m peeing on my face too 
on the inside 
i hate you 
observe  my dear   
   since it was you
who lured him to his death 
 for the crimes of blasphemy   
   heresy   
   conspiracy    
  what you thinking about 
   treachery   
   leprosy    
trying to make conversation 
 puppetry   
   hyperbole    
  your hair looks really good today 
  i peed all over it 
  then that s the secret  i guess 
 sodomy    
  oh  it s  refusal of sodomy  
  yeah 
can you just forgive me 
i think i hate you too much 
 lechery
and the murder of my brother  abel  
  oh  come on 
  shut it 
for these  and other crimes   
   the prisoners shall be stoned   
   to death 
  wait  can i make a suggestion 
  what 
just have one person throw stones
at us 
in fact  i think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us 
no  that doesn t make any   
  we want that guy 
  that guy 
  me 
  that s our stoner 
what  just because i m a eunuch
you don t think i can throw 
i ll show you throwing 
no  no  no  no  no  gross 
did he just hurl his own ball at him 
how spectacular 
no  that doesn t count 
that was a testicle 
i think it counts 
  pick somebody else 
  what is that idiot doing 
  i pick that guy 
  nice 
  this guy 
  no  no  the shorter man 
right in front of him 
it s a kid  this is a kid 
so  you got something against kids 
this guy hates kids 
  let me smite him 
  kid hater 
  one shot 
  no  they re our future 
all right  hey  go ahead and   
okay  i m hit 
holy shit  that kid s got an arm 
god  there s two of us 
are you guys happy now 
okay  everybody on this side 
on the count of three  one  two   
wait  i have a question for the king 
why didn t i die in the holy of holies 
yes  i entered the holy of holies
and  lo  i did not die 
why  because i was chosen
by the gods 
spare the chosen one 
spare the chosen one 
spare the chosen one 
spare the chosen one 
  spare the chosen one 
  and his friend 
  and his young friend 
  don t kill either of them 
everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one 
is it possible  is he truly chosen 
well  of course it s possible 
highly doubtful 
majesty  with respect   
   whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue 
if you were to kill him now 
given the public mood   
   it could inflame the situation
so as   
   to cause a radical regime change 
if you take my meaning 
yes  that will do 
it is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved   
   to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion 
yes 
and how is that better 
you seem to enjoy your work 
how long have you been a slave 
oh  i m not a slave  i m a volunteer 
marlak  enmebaragesi 
long time no see 
i deserve that 
take these bricks up top 
the masons are waiting 
i would but i did something to my
neck  i think i slept on it funny 
i should probably take it easy 
or i ll be no good for work tomorrow 
move 
you know 
the mud s really good for your skin 
  yeah 
  ask me why my skin s so good 
  why s your skin    
  the mud 
i knew you were gonna say that 
you gotta love being outside 
move it 
faster 
  want some water 
  you re from the village  aren t you 
i ll bet you wish you were back there
right now 
  yeah 
  don t give up 
you ll get home someday 
who s gonna take him there 
the chosen one 
you two  up  get on line  now 
  where are we going 
  to watch the sacrifice 
  the king demands it 
  is it compulsory 
there was some work that i wanted to
finish doing  get a jump on tomorrow 
i d like to see how big you are
without that whip 
same basic size 
all is in readiness  your majesty 
what now 
more virgins to sacrifice 
yes  two  your own handmaiden
and another slave 
followers of the chosen one 
discovered by this loyal soldier 
oh  i was just doing my job 
it s what i do 
and one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity 
for the love of the people 
and the heavenly gift of rain   
   we offer a humble sacrifice 
our own stepdaughter   
   the princess inanna 
  you re insane 
  for the good of the people  darling 
  you wouldn t dare

i can arrange for you to join her 
mother

i would tolerate your insolence 
burn her

to show us a sign   
   so that we may honor
your divine will

to say this   
   but that stuff
that you saw the other night   
   with the high priest  that   
he s a friend 
that was totally not a gay thing 
i always thought
that you and i had a connection 
so i just wanted to mention it now 
i always thought that we had
one and maybe   
   thought you might ve
felt the same 
i just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say 
but i always thought    i always
have felt a certain way about you 
i don t know if you know or not
but you   
all those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut   
   those were from me 
  just kiss me 
  from me like a gift for you 
i don t know 
i thought you d like those 
i always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds   
   in a soup or something 
or  i don t know 
i thought they were practical 
should i take off my undercloth 
oh  tough guy  huh 
you want a piece of me 
i m gonna bash your head in 
that was a nice shot 
hey
