it all began in the summer of 1957
before the start of second grade
here we are
ha ha
what do you guys think
i like this place
its cool
uh what color is my room
just you wait
lets see whats inside
hey come on buddy bryce
why dont uh you and i
go help unload the van
and the womenfolk here
can get in the kitchen and start setting up
okay dad
for me it was the beginning
of what would be
more than half a decade of
strategic avoidance and social discomfort
hi im juli baker
hey hey what are you doing
dont you want some help
no theres some
valuable things in there
how about this one
no no no
run home your mothers
probably wondering where you are
oh no my mom knows where i am
she said its fine
it didnt take long to realize
this girl could not take a hint
its crowded in here with three people
i dont mind
of any kind
you wanna push this one together
bryce isnt it time for you
to go help your mother
huh
oh yeah
i mean nothing would stop her
i was about to tell her to get lost
when the weirdest thing happened
i couldnt believe it
there i was holding hands
with this strange girl
how did i get into this mess
well hello
i see youve met my son
uhhuh
finally i did the only manly
thing available when youre 7 years old
however my troubles were far from over
the minute i walked
into miss yelsons classroom
bryce youre here
it was clear
school would not be a sanctuary
hey bryce wheres your girlfriend
i was branded for life
hey bryce
why dont you ask her to marry you
bryce and juli sitting in a tree
klsslng
my first year in town was a disaster
look at them
and the next three werent much better
but finally in the sixth grade
i took action
i hatched the plan
sherry
sherry wait up
hi bryce heh
i asked out sherry stalls
i was wondering if you wanted to go
to full appreciate
the brilliance of this plan
you have to understand
that juli hated sherry stalls
though i never understood why
sherry was nice friendly
and she had a lot of hair
at first my mother wouldnt let me
get my ears pierced but i begged
the idea was that sherry
would eat with me
maybe wed walk around together
and hopefully juli would lose interest
but i still cant get the hoops till im 16
oh thats a shame
so melanie wanted to get her ears pierced
but of course her mother said no
so she threw a fit and smashed
her johnny mathis greatest hits album
and she got grounded so now she cant
come to my pajama sleepover party
things were unfolding quite nicely
what are you doing
for your science project
that is until my supposed
best friend garrett einbinder
took an interest in sherry himself
i was thinking of showing how split ends
react with different hair conditioners
thats fascinating
loyalty gave way to desire
and garrett the turncoat
told sherry what i was up to
jerk
she didnt take it well
word got back to juli and pretty soon
she started up with the googoo eyes again
only this time it was worse
she started sniffing me
thats right sniffing me
what was that all about
my only consolation
was that next year would be different
junior high bigger school
maybe wed be in different classes
and it would finally finally be over
the first day i met bryce loski i flipped
it was those eyes
something in those dazzling eyes
you wanna push this one together
his family had just moved
into the neighborhood
and id gone over to help them
id been in the van all of two minutes
when his dad sent him off to help his mom
i could see he didnt wanna go
so i chased after him to see if we could
play a little before he got trapped inside
the next thing i know
hes holding my hand
and looking right into my eyes
my heart stopped
was this it
would this be my first kiss
but then his mother came out
well hello
and he was so embarrassed
his cheeks turned completely red
i went to bed that night thinking
of the kiss that might have been
i mean it was clear he had feelings for me
but he was just too shy to show them
my mother said boys were like that
so i decided to help him out
bryce youre here
i would give him plenty
of opportunity to get over his shyness
by the sixth grade
id learned to control myself
then sherry stalls entered the picture
sherry stalls was nothing but a whiny
gossipy backstabbing flirt
all hair and no substance
and there she was
holding hands with bryce my bryce
the one who was walking around
with my first kiss
my solution was to ignore her
i knew a boy of bryces caliber
would eventually see through
a shallow conniver like sherry stalls
it took all of a week
they broke up at recess
she didnt take it well
now that bryce was out of sherrys
evil clutches he started being nicer to me
hi juli
hi bryce
he was so shy and so cute
and his hair
it smelled like watermelon
i couldnt get enough of it
i spent the whole year
secretly sniffing watermelon
and wondering
if i was ever going to get my kiss
seventh grade brought changes all right
but the biggest one
didnt happen at school
it happened at home
my grandfather came to live with us
mom said he stared like that
because he missed grandma
that was not something grandpa
would ever talk about with me
as a matter of fact he never talked
about much of anything with me
that is until juli appeared
in the local newspaper
oh bryce may i speak with you
what
have a seat son
tell me about your friend juli baker
juli shes not exactly my friend
oh whys that
why do you wanna know
now juli baker did not
wind up in the mayfield times
for being an eighthgrade einstein
no she got frontpage coverage because
she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree
juli baker and that stupid sycamore tree
she always thought it was gods gift
to our little corner of the universe
hey bryce wanna come climb the tree
with me and my brothers
no thanks
bryce come up here its fun
i cant
my dad needs me to help him fix
a thing
thats all i needed
climb up a tree with juli baker
id be dragged right back
into the second grade
bryce and juli sitting in a tree
why dont you just make me eat lima beans
for the rest of my life
its three blocks away
two blocks
one block away
like thats valuable information
i hate it when she does that
i like to think theres at least a chance
the bus wont show
i think the tree looks particularly beautiful
in this light dont you
if by beautiful you mean unbelievably
ugly then yes i would agree
youre just visually challenged
i feel sorry for you
visually challenged
visually challenged
this from the girl who lived in a house
that was the joke of the neighborhood
they had bushes growing over windows
and weeds all over the place
it bugged my dad bigtime
oh there he is
the bricklayer who thinks hes a painter
that trucks not ugly enough in real life
hes gotta make a painting of it
no he does landscapes
sells them at the county fair
people say theyre beautiful
landscapes let me tell you something
the world would have
more beauty in it
if hed do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard
i feel bad for his wife
she married a dreamer
because of that one of the two of them
will always be unhappy
yeah fine
but why do we have to be unhappy
as annoying as the yard was
to my dad
it was nothing compared to how annoying
juli baker was in that tree
three blocks away
every morning
we had to listen to the sound
of her blowbyblow traffic report
two blocks
there you go
why do they call it the three stooges
i mean theres five of them
what
well yeah theres moe larry curly
shemp and curly joe
yeah but they only have three at a time
yeah
you know i hate curly joe
i mean he shouldnt even be a stooge
listen girl
im this close to calling the police
you are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job
whats going on
either you come down
or were gonna cut you down
you guys come up here with me
they wont cut it down
if were all up here
bus bus bus
juli was frantic
they wanted to cut down her tree
i couldnt understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches
meant so much to her
bryce please
i felt bad for her
leave her
but i wasnt about to cut school over it
come on bro
why isnt she your friend bryce
youd have to know juli
well id like to
why
that girl has an iron backbone
why dont you invite her over sometime
an iron backbone
shes just stubborn
and shes pushy beyond belief
is that so
and shes been stalking me
since the second grade
well a girl like that
doesnt live next door to everyone
lucky them
read this
without prejudice
like i needed to know
anything more about juli baker
juli wasnt at the bus stop
the next morning
or the morning after that
she was at school
but youd never know it
little joe hes got so much makeup on
he doesnt age
i told myself i should be glad about it
i mean isnt that what
id always wanted
but still i felt bad for her
i was gonna tell her i was sorry
but then i thought hey no
thats the last thing i needed
juli baker thinking i missed her
i see why you like to come out here
would you mind explaining it
to your mother
i loved to watch my father paint
or really i loved to hear him talk
while he painted
i learned a lot about my dad that way
he told me all sorts of things
like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how hed wished hed finished college
then one day he surprised me
whats going on with you
and uh bryce loski
what do you mean nothing
oh okay
my mistake
why would you even think that
no reason
just that you
talk about him all the time
i do
mmhm
i dont know
i guess its something about his eyes
or maybe his smile
but what about him
what
you have to look at the whole landscape
what does that mean
a painting is more
than the sum of its parts
a cow by itself is just a cow
a meadow by itself is just grass
flowers
and the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light
but you put them all together
and it can be magic
i didnt really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon
when i was up in the sycamore tree
i was rescuing a kite
it was a long way up
higher than id ever been
and the higher i got
the more amazed i was by the view
i began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled
like sunshine and wild grass
i couldnt stop breathing it in
filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell id ever known
hey you found my kite
bryce you should come up here
its so beautiful
i cant i sprained my um
i have a rash
from that moment on
that became my spot
i could sit there for hours
just looking out at the world
some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink
and some days
they were a blazing orange
setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon
it was during one of those sunsets
that my fathers idea
of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts
moved from my head to my heart
some days i would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise
one morning
i was making mental notes
of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds
so i could tell my dad
when i heard a noise below
excuse me
excuse me im sorry but you cant
park there thats a bus stop
hey what are you doing up there
you cant be up there
were gonna take this thing down
the tree
yeah now come on down
but who told you you could cut it down
the owner
why
hes gonna build a house
and this trees in the way
so come on girl we got work to do
you cant cut it down you just cant
listen girl
im this close to calling the police
you are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job
now either you come down
or were gonna cut you down
go ahead cut me down
im not coming down
im never coming down
bryce you guys come up here with me
they wont cut it down
if were all up here
bryce please dont let them do this
come on you guys
bryce please you dont have to
come up this high just a little ways
bryce please please
what happened after that was a blur
it seemed like the whole town was there
but still i wouldnt move
then my father showed up
he talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where i was
sweetie its time to come down
daddy please dont let them do this
sweetie
daddy look
you can see everything
you can see the whole world from here
no view is worth my daughters safety
now come on
i cant
julianna its time to come down now
please daddy
its time
and that was it
i mustve cried for two weeks straight
oh sure i went to school
and did the best i could
but nothing seemed to matter
juli
huh
do you know the answer
uh the peloponnesian war
im sure thats the answer
to something
but i was looking for the area
of a rhomboid
somehow rhomboids
and isosceles right triangles
didnt seem so important
i rode my bike so i wouldnt have to pass
by the stump
that used to be the earths
most magnificent sycamore tree
but no matter what i did
i couldnt stop thinking about it
are you okay
it was just a tree
no it wasnt just a tree
i never want you to forget how you felt
when you were up there
thanks dad
it was the first thing i saw every morning
and the last thing i saw
before i went to sleep
and once i could look at it
without crying
i saw more than the tree
and what being up there meant to me
i saw the day that my view of things
around me started changing
and i wondered
did i still feel the same things about bryce
ive never been a huge fan of eggs
i mean i could always just take them
or leave them
that is until one day
in skyler browns garage
when my feelings about eggs
were solidified
hey hey hey guys
ednas found her breakfast
i mean if a slimy reptile
found them appetizing
there was certainly no place for them
in my diet
oh man thats so cool
she doesnt even have to chew
i mean think of all the time youd save
i couldve gone my whole life
not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw
if it hadnt been for lynetta
she had a majorleague thing
for skyler brown
i think its gross
he and julis brothers
matt and mark had formed a band
and lynetta would watch them practice
that is so neat
how about that huh bryce
yeah neat
so brycie how do you think
hes gonna digest that
stomach acid
youd like to think that
wait everybody quiet here he goes
eggs over easy
gross gross gross gross
wait wait
you havent seen the best part
ugh
gross
i tried to be casual about it
but it didnt take
i started having bad dreams
id be trapped inside a huge egg
and this monster would open his jaws
and start to devour me
id wake up just in time
then the real nightmare began
hi bryce i brought these over
for you and your family
my chickens are laying eggs
what
you remember abby and bonnie and clyde
and dexter and eunice and florence
the ones i hatched for the science fair
how could i forget
it was classic juli baker
she totally dominated the fair
and get this her project
was all about watching boring eggs hatch
i mean here i had a liveaction
erupting volcano
and all anyone cared about
was julis boring chicks
breaking out of their boring shells
oh i think the last ones hatching
its hatching
oh its hatching
kids come over here
but hey she won i lost
ive never been one to dwell
here it comes
but that didnt mean
i had to eat her lousy eggs
i think it was very sweet of juli
to bring us those eggs
i dont care
im still having cereal tomorrow
yeah how do we know theres no chicks
in one of those eggs
i used to eat farmfresh eggs
when i was a kid they were delicious
yeah well thats all well and good
but what if we crack one open
and a dead chick falls out
do they have a rooster if they dont
have a rooster the eggs cant be fertile
and if they had a rooster wed know
the whole neighborhood would know
maybe they got it deyodeled
deyodeled
you know decockadoodledood
what the hell are you talking about
like they debark dogs
bryce why dont you just ask juli
what
you afraid to talk to her
im not afraid to talk to her
i know you are but what am i
okay just talk to her and find out
bryce
how do you tell if ones a rooster
well a roosters bigger longer feathers
mmhm
theyve got that red stuff
growing out of their head
and around their neck too
that shouldnt be too hard to spot
although come to think of it
chickens have the rubbery red stuff too
just not as much
garretts expertise in roosters
was the cornerstone of our plan
to avoid contact with juli baker
the balance of which involved
spying over her back fence
come on come on
shh shh
over here
i cant see the stupid chickens
we gotta get them out of the coop
is that a rooster
no it looks like a chicken
how can you tell
it just does
see what i mean expertise
shh shh
what
juli
here guys
go on there you go
here guys go on
yeah theyre all chickens
theres no rooster
what did i just say
how can you tell
well none of them are strutting
here come on
roosters strut
come on guys
what did i just say
here
plus hardly any of them
have any rubbery red stuff
what are you doing
yeah theyre definitely all chickens
theyre all chickens
im proud of you bryce
you overcame your fear
huh
you talked to her
oh heh yeah
its no big deal
thats what she told you
theyre all chickens
yeah
shes a genius youre both genius
of course theyre all chickens
a roosters a chicken the question is
is one of them a rooster
or are they all hens
hens who said anything about hens
then it hit me
garrett didnt know jack shit
about chickens
do roosters strut
yes they do
what does that have to do
with anything
theyre all hens
well the main thing is the eggs are okay
its all settled
not for me
there was no way
i was ever gonna eat anything
that had anything to do
with juli baker
im not eating them
well why not
have you seen their yard its
theres not even any grass
its all mud and chicken turds
ew gross salmonella
do you suppose
they could have salmonella
its not very likely
why take the risk
what do we do with the eggs
give them back
give them back to juli
sure
you talked to her before right
it didnt kill you
well what do i say
tell her we dont eat eggs
uh were allergic to them or something
come on use your brains
it didnt feel right to lie
besides even a seventh grader would know
that entire families arent allergic to eggs
but i didnt wanna
hurt her feelings either
so that left me with only one option
and thus another neardeath
experience
in my ongoing saga with juli baker
had been successfully avoided
until one week later
hi bryce brought you some more eggs
wow
thanks
did your family like the first batch
do you even have to ask
great see you at school
what i hoped would be
a onetime event
was just the beginning of a life consumed
with lies intrigue and deception
every morning
id be on the lookout for juli
so if she happened to come i could whip
the door open before she knocked
thanks
then id dump the eggs
before anyone noticed
and why why couldnt i just face her
why couldnt i just say
no thanks dont want them
dont need them give them to the snake
was i really afraid
of hurting her feelings
or was i just afraid of her
now you wanna make sure you get it
when mrs brubeck first suggested
hatching eggs as my science project
i was less than excited
that is until i saw my first sign of life
is that it
wow
it looks like a bean
it does
lets try the other ones
suddenly it felt real
all the eggs were alive
there were like little bean babies
inside every one
on the day of the fair
all six chicks hatched
what are the odds
this years top prize goes to juli baker
for her wonderful project
a chicken is born
i won first place
and that was cool
but all i really cared about were my chicks
there you go there you go guys
my mom wasnt crazy
about us raising chickens
but i begged and pleaded
i told her i would take care of everything
and i did
wheres clyde
clyde
hey clyde whats the matter
are you okay arent you hungry
come on come here
whats wrong baby
come here
hey youre not clyde youre clydette
mom
as it turned out my hens
laid more eggs than we could eat
at first we tried to keep up
but after a month of boiling
frying and deviling
like that movie the blob
we were being overtaken by eggs
then opportunity in the form
of our neighbor mrs steuby knocked
hello dear
if you ever have any extra
id be happy to buy them from you
really
certainly
and i happen to know that mrs helms
would be interested as well
great
nothing like fresh eggs
thanks mrs steuby
you bet dear bye
between mrs steuby and mrs helms
my egg overflow problem was solved
then i realized that mrs loski
deserved eggs too
but i didnt think it would be right
to charge her
she had been such a good neighbor
lending us supplies when we ran out
giving my mother a ride
when our car wouldnt start
it was the least i could do
besides if i happened to run into bryce
that wouldnt be the end of the world
hi bryce
by the third time i brought eggs over
to the loskis
i realized bryce was waiting for me
waiting to pull open the door and say
thanks juli see you at school
and in return
i got a few moments alone
with the worlds most dazzling eyes
thanks juli see you at school
it was a bargain
until the day it wasnt
it was two weeks after the sycamore tree
was cut down
and i was just starting
to feel normal again
hey juli right on schedule
yeah well neither rain nor sleet
huh
you know the mailman thing
oh right
so um will you start
riding the bus again
i dont know
i havent been up there since
it doesnt look so bad anymore
its all cleared away
well um i better get ready for school
guess ill see you there
see you
maybe bryce was right
maybe it was time
i started riding the bus again
after all didnt he just tell me
he wanted me to
could it be that bryce loski
actually misses me
juli what are you still doing here
i was just thinking
its pickup day the cans are in front
i know you need some help
no maybe ill do it later
are those my eggs
yeah yeah i dropped them
theyre not broken
why are you throwing them away
dont you want them
it wasnt me
my dad didnt think it was worth the risk
risk what risk
salmonella
what hes afraid of being poisoned
well juli i mean look at your back yard
its a complete mess
its like covered in turds
thats not true
i clean up after my girls every day
we just didnt wanna hurt your feelings
have you always thrown them away
you know mrs steuby and mrs helms
pay me for my eggs
they do
they pay me 60 cents a dozen
i didnt know
how could you
im sorry
no youre not
it didnt take me long to realize
that id traded in my old problems
with juli baker
for a whole set of new ones
it was actually worse having her mad at me
than having her annoy me
the way she ignored me
was a constant reminder
that id been a jerk
then one day i was coming home
from playing basketball with garrett
and things got weird
dont be so timid
come on you wont hurt them
like this
yeah thats it
my grandfather
all i ever saw him wear was slippers
now where did he get those work boots
i couldnt stop looking over there
and the more i looked the madder i got
my grandfather had already said
more to juli in one hour
than hed said to me in the whole time
hed been living with us
i was pretty sure
id never seen him laugh
and what was his deal with juli baker
hi grandpa
juli told me about the eggs
you know bryce
ones character is set at an early age
id hate to see you swim out so far
you cant swim back
sir
its about honesty son
sometimes a little discomfort
in the beginning
can save a whole lot of pain
down the road
when it came to holding a grudge
juli baker was truly impressive
all week i tried to approach her
at school
shed always find some way to duck me
and whenever she was in her yard
grandpa was always there with her
finally one saturday i saw my opening
my grandfather had gone into town
to buy some bengay
i guess the yard work
was starting to get to him
its looking real good
thanks chet did most of it
im sorry for what i did
i just dont get it bryce
why didnt you just tell me
i dont know it was dumb
and i shouldnt have said anything
about your yard either
it wasnt right
maybe its all for the best
i mean look i learned so much from chet
its amazing
youre lucky
i dont even have grandparents anymore
oh
i feel sorry for him
he misses your grandma
can you believe it
he says i remind him of her
what
i know thats what i said
but he meant it in a nice way
something about her spirit
yeah
well
good luck with the grass
im sure itll come up great
thanks
i guess ill see you around
i guess so
while julis acceptance of
my apology was not all that id hoped for
at least the eggs thing
was finally behind me
the first time in months
i could truly enjoy bonanza
where you going
and why you dressed like that
skylers
matt and mark are bringing over recording
stuff and theyre gonna make a demo
demo like they know how
to make a demo
you dont even know them
i dont have to i know the type
you dont know anything
dont talk to me like that
im late
be back by 11
yep everything was back to normal
is that girl working you too hard
that girls name is juli
and no she isnt working me too hard
youve developed
quite a soft spot for her huh
steven
no patsy just wanna find out
why your father has the energy
to befriend a complete stranger
when he wont throw a baseball around
with his own grandson
its okay dad
no its not okay
juli reminds him of grandma
of renee heh
thats ridiculous
you know why the bakers
havent fixed their yard
yeah because hes too busy
with his paintbynumbers kit
if you had a brother with a severe handicap
what would you do
what the hell
does that have to do with anything
julis father has a retarded brother
so what hes not the gardener
is he heh
hahaha
it was a joke
you know
other people have family troubles
and they manage
to mow their own lawns
i dont know where their pride
in ownership is
they dont own that house
the landlords supposed to maintain it
mr baker puts every extra penny he has
into caring for his brother
dont they have government facilities
for that sort of thing
maybe they thought that a private facility
would be better for him
either way its not our fault that their
family has some chromosomal abnormality
it has nothing to do with chromosomes
when julis uncle was born he had
the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
if hed had enough oxygen he wouldve
been a perfect little baby just like your son
goddamn it chet
patsy patsy
leave me alone
sorry about that
why is mom so upset
because
but for the grace of god
your mother could be standing
in mr bakers shoes
did her brother have the cord
wrapped around his neck too
you did
luckily the doctor who delivered you
was on the ball and got it untangled
but it easily couldve gone
the other way
wanna go for a walk
huh
i find it helps clear the mind
what would they have done with me
you cant dwell on something
that mightve been bryce
the way my dad was talking sounds like
he wouldve thrown me in a nuthouse
no no now thats not fair
you cant condemn him
for something he hasnt done
this is where that tree was wasnt it
yeah
mustve been a spectacular view
shes quite a girl
some of us get dipped in flat
some in satin
some in gloss
but every once in a while
you find someone whos iridescent
and when you do
nothing will ever compare
flat glossy iridescent
what the hell did that mean
juli baker had always
just seemed plain to me
until now
and the way she talked about
what it felt like to be up in that tree
to be held above the earth
brushed by the wind
who in junior high talks like that
this weird feeling started taking over
in the pit of my stomach
and i didnt like it
i was slipping man
and it was time to get a grip
id never been embarrassed
by where we lived before
i also never really thought about money
i knew we werent rich but i didnt feel
like we were missing anything
that is until bryce loski
called our home a complete mess
whats your name
whats your name
is it mary or sue
whats your name
do i stand a chance with you
its so hard to find a personality
with charms like yours for me
oohee oohee oohee
i had to do something
and i knew what it was
whats your name
oh youre sounding really good
yeah
well record it in skylers garage
thats a wonderful project
speaking of projects i was thinking
it might be cool to fix up the yard
what
i mean how much can grass seed cost
i could plant a lawn
maybe some flowers
i could even put up a fence
honey thats a major undertaking
i could pay for it with my egg money
no thats your money
the landlord should be the one
taking care of all this
but he doesnt and we live here
and it looks so bad
jules
whats going on
nothing dad
its okay sweetheart
you can tell us
the loskis have been throwing away my
eggs because theyre afraid of salmonella
because our yard is such a mess
did patsy say that
no bryce did
but it must have been
a family discussion
a boy doesnt come up with that
on his own
who cares what they think
yeah who cares
trina
lets not get into this
no im tired of living like this richard
im tired of having to take temp jobs
just to make ends meet
im tired of having to push a chair up
against the washing machine
just to keep the door shut
im tired of having to borrow
mrs steubys vacuum cleaner
every time ours breaks down
do you think this is the life
i pictured for us
sometimes you have to sacrifice
to do the right thing
we always end up agreeing that devonhurst
is the right thing for daniel
well maybe we should start thinking
about whats right for us
our daughter is suffering
because we wont fix up our own yard
its not our yard
how can you say that richard how
weve lived here for 12 years
and for 12 years weve been saying
its temporary but its not
this is our home
is it wrong to wanna live somewhere
you can be proud of
to have enough to send your kids
to college
maybe its time
we considered government care
we are not moving my brother
hes more important
than your own children
dad
how dare you
stop it dad please just stop
im sorry julianna this is not your fault
well work this out i promise
that was the first time i ever heard
my parents really yell at each other
im sorry about tonight
that night they each came into my room
my father talked about his brother
and how much he loved him
and how he promised his parents
hed always take care of him
my mother talked about how much
she loved my father
for his strength and kind heart
when she kissed me good night
she whispered that of all her
many blessings i was her best
i felt sorry for my father
i felt sorry for my mother
but most of all
i felt lucky for me that they were mine
i wanted to think the reason
i started working on my yard
had nothing to do with bryce
it was about making our house better
after what he did with the eggs
why should i care what he thought
but i did
are you pruning that
or trying to hack it to death
hi im chet duncan
bryces grandfather
sorry its taken me so long
to come over and introduce myself
nice to meet you
so are you trimming all these
to the same height
well yeah thats what i was thinking
but i dont know
do you think it would look better
to take them out
oh these are hicksii shrubs
these will prune up nicely
listen mr duncan
call me chet
chet
if youre here
because of what bryce said
i dont need your help
read about you in the paper
renee wouldve sat up in that tree
with you
she wouldve sat up there all night
renee
my wife
you remind me a lot of her
we worked on the yard for weeks
and the whole time we worked
we talked
right there
perfect yeah
he wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree
he knew exactly what it meant
about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts
he said it was the same with people
but sometimes with people
the whole could be less
i thought that was pretty interesting
i started looking at people
id known since elementary school
trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts
chet was right a lot of them were less
of all my classmates the one person
i couldnt seem to place was bryce
until recently i wouldve said
with absolute certainty
that he was greater far greater
than the sum of his parts
but now i wasnt so sure
its looking good juli nice job
thanks chet did most of it
im sorry for what i did
i just dont get it bryce
why didnt you just tell me
was he really sorry
or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better
then i thought maybe i just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts
but as i looked into his eyes
those dazzling eyes
for the first time
i was pretty sure
that bryce loski was less
were going to invite the bakers
over for dinner
what
i dont know mom
i think thats a marvelous idea
patsy what purpose does this serve
trina baker is a very nice person
and matt and mark are really cool
i hate cool
something we shouldve done years ago
yeah but we didnt and now we cant
the statute of limitations has run out
were having the bakers over for dinner
if this is about what i said last night
im sorry okay
but you know having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother
its going to be a sitdown dinner
and i expect everyone
to dress accordingly
oh god cant we just have a barbecue
its going to be a sitdown dinner
just shoot me now
careful what you wish for
so that was it
a dressup sitdown dinner with juli baker
was in my immediate future
and that made seeing juli at school
more uncomfortable
i found myself staring at her in class
and the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders
she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper
dana tressler caught me watching
if i didnt do something fast
this could spread like wildfire
there was a bee in her hair
see there it goes
theres no bee
it flew out the window
i convinced myself id dodged a bullet
i had to put juli out of my mind
keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork
my weakness was unnerving
i need your sharpener
you ever heard of knocking
hey what you got there dads playboy
none of your business
give my best to miss october
get out
or should i say your best ha ha
youre disgusting
another disaster avoided
my life had become a minefield
hey man
hey
hey man
hey
whats this
whoa
its not what you think
okay it is what you think
but i can explain
okay i cant explain
can we just talk about it later
whatever you say
i had to talk to someone
why not garrett
maybe he could help me get back on track
garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart
are you freaking mental juli baker
you hate her
thats whats weird i dont think i do
i cant stop thinking about her
you got it bad man
well what do i do
well you gotta nip this in the bud
these arent real emotions
theyre not
you feel guilty because of the egg thing
yeah and i insulted her yard
exactly of course
the place is a dump anyways
her dads got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him
a retard well shoot
that ought to tell you something
about what
about juli
what are you saying
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree
i couldnt believe it
i wanted to yell at him
tell him that he didnt know juli
like i did
but all that came out was
heh oh
right
yeah
right um ill talk to you later
i was supposed to go
to garretts after school
but i couldnt be around him
hed crossed the line
and standing right next to him
across that line was my father
i didnt care what they thought
i liked juli baker
sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house
my dad lets himself sleep in
my mother lets herself not fix breakfast
if my brothers have been out late
playing with their band
you wont even know theyre around
till noon
but this sunday i woke up feeling weird
i had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about bryce
that were starting to creep back in
you really did it didnt you heh
proud of you

id never visited my uncle daniel
i dont know why
it was always something my dad did alone
we didnt say much to each other on
the drive to devonhurst but i didnt care
i just liked being with my dad
somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could
the residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy
it takes some getting used to
theyre good people though

yeah there you go
heh orange
on the walk back
daniel acted like nothing had happened
other way other way
on the ride home
my dad told me that uncle daniel
used to live with him and mom
before we were born
but after a while it became too difficult
when we got home
everything looked the same
but it wasnt
before today daniel had always been
just a name to me
now he was part of the family
hey
hey
howd it go
im glad i went
im glad you went too
trina its sunday
what are you doing mopping the floor
patty loski invited us over for dinner
friday night
shouldnt she be mopping her floor
or did she ask to borrow ours
nervous energy
did she invite all of us
yes she did
even our friend sal monella
richard
why after all these years
well she said she felt really bad
that they hadnt invited us before
and apparently they want
to get to know us better
and you wanna go
well she insisted
and i think it would be really nice
all right
well go
i wasnt too thrilled about dinner
with the loskis
but i could see it meant a lot
to my mother
at school the next day
i couldnt seem to concentrate
my thoughts kept running back to daniel
i wondered what my grandparents
had gone through having a son like him
when reality interrupted
bryce loski likes you
what
hes got a big crush on you
what are you talking about
bryce loski does not have a crush on me
oh yeah
in science i caught him staring at you
he said it was because there was a bee
in your hair
is that the lamest coverup or what
maybe there was a bee
the only bee youre attracting
is bryce
im telling you
that boy is lost in love land
come on
where
i saw him sneaking off with garrett
come on
are you freaking mental
juli baker you hate her
thats whats so weird i dont think i do
i cant stop thinking about her
you got it bad man
what do i do
you gotta nip this in the bud
theyre not
you feel guilty because of the egg thing
yeah and i insulted her yard
exactly the place is a dump anyways
her dads got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him
a retard
well that ought to tell you something
about what
about juli
what are you saying
the apple doesnt fall far
from the tree my friend
oh heh yeah right
yeah
ill talk to you later
okay
im sorry i thought
its okay its fine
and it was
because now my confusion was gone
i was sure i no longer liked
bryce loski
mom are you trying to make the bakers
feel totally worthless
i want it to be nice
and why arent you dressed
im going
i wanted to look good for juli
but i didnt want her to think
that i wanted to look good for her
it was a fine line
a very fine line
bryce theyre here come on down
coming
hey come on in
come in come in
there goes the waistline
im glad you could make it
lynetta steven companys here
coming
what is this homemade pie
yes its pecan
and blueberry cheesecake
lets take them to the kitchen
hi guys
hey looking good
this is my dad
hi im lynetta
hi nice to finally meet you
nice to meet you too
hey big guy
hey steven how are you
we shouldve done this a long time ago
come on in
this is a cool place
yeah its all right
come on ill show you my room
you gotta hear this new song we wrote
its so good
hi
you look nice
i heard you and garrett
making fun of my uncle in the library
and i dont wanna speak to you
not now not ever
and i say you can
but what youre proposing
would require a perpetualmotion
machine so its not possible
if you had two opposite charged poles
with a neutral conductor
perpetual motion
here i was dying inside and they
were talking about perpetual motion
and how did juli know
about all that stuff
come on everybody dinners ready
lynetta
dinner
juli can i talk to you
it was wrong what garrett said
i know it
did you know it was wrong
when he said it
yeah i wanted to punch him
but we were in the library
so instead you just agreed with him
and laughed
yeah
then that makes you a coward
i had to sit across from juli
for an entire dinner
my dad was right
we should have barbecued
i just want to say how wonderful it is
to have you share a meal with us
may it be the first of many
wrong pipe
well we couldnt be happier
we are just all so thrilled to be here
juli you did a really nice job
on your yard
thanks chet was a big help
yeah i know
you gotta tell me your secret
i cant get him to do a thing around here
steven
i kid
im telling you the neighborhood
is really coming to life
i mean that new house is taking shape
which one
you know the one where they cut down
that big ugly tree
i wanted to say that a lot of people
liked that tree but i didnt
i didnt want to go against my dad
some people thought that tree
was the jewel of the neighborhood
yeah well
theres no accounting for taste
so matt mark mark matt
you guys are uh gonna be
graduating soon huh
yeah thank god
you dont like high school
you kidding
no
high school was the best time of my life
not for us no
yeah weve had enough of that scene
ah
so college is probably
out of the question huh
no its a possibility
theyve actually been accepted
at several places already
yes they have
really
well thats good
but um
were gonna give music a shot first
really
oh they are very talented
oh their band is really boss
they did a bunch of demos
and theyre really cool
thanks lyn
when steven and i first met
he was playing in a band
you played in a band
he was a wonderful saxophone player
cool you still play
well l
well if you want
you can come jam out with us sometime
uh you
no i mean heh
thats not me anymore
have you boys ever performed
in front of an audience
a lot of times
the more matt and mark
talked about their musical exploits
the quieter my dad got
he tried to plaster on a smile
now and then
but underneath he seemed really sad
but my parents didnt like him at first
republicans fought like crazy
against the new deal
the rest of the evening
was painless enough
but through it all
juli didnt say a word to me
never even looked at me
until she was about to leave
im sorry i was so angry
when we first came in
i think everyone had a good time
your mom was really nice to invite us
see you
her apology made things worse
hey wait for me
i knew i wasnt forgiven
it was like i wasnt even important enough
to hold a grudge against
well i think theyre a delightful family
those boys were nothing like i expected
i thought they were very nice young men
hoodlums
what
how you think they can afford
all that recording gear
steven please
you cant just make an accusation like that
dont be so naive patsy
do you know how expensive it is
to record a demo
theyre probably stealing hubcaps
for chrissake
you are such an asshole
what is the matter with you
go to hell
dont you talk to me like that
steven stop
nobody talks to me like that
in my own house
stop
id seen my father angry before
but this was different
as i lay in bed that night
i thought about how my dad
always looked down on the bakers
and how hed called them trash
and made fun of mr bakers paintings
and now i realized
he was just mad at himself
but why
juli called me a coward
was it possible my dad
was a coward too
i didnt know
what difference did it make
juli baker was out of my life
or more accurately
i was out of hers
as i was getting dressed
for the loskis dinner party
i found myself staring at the painting
my father had given me
and became furious all over again
bryce had never been
a friend to me ever
he hadnt taken my side about the tree
hed thrown away my eggs
and he made fun of me
at my uncles expense
when my mother called
that it was time to go
juli lets go were late
i went out with every intention of
telling her that i wasnt going to the loskis
please hold these i need to check my hair
really quickly one more time
your hair is perfect
really
but she looked so happy
and shed gone to so much trouble
over the pies that i couldnt
ooh oh my gosh
oh god what a disaster
okay here hold one and you hold this
i dont wanna hold it
i wont have you hold it
lets go boys
but that didnt mean
i had to be nice to bryce
and i dont wanna speak to you
not now not ever
it felt good to take charge
i felt strong in control
i told bryce what i thought
and i was determined not to talk to him
for the rest of the evening
at dinner it struck me that we were sharing
a meal with a group of strangers
wed lived across the street
from the loskis for years
but except for chet
i didnt know these people at all
mr loski was clean and smooth
on the outside
but it seemed like there was something
rotten buried just beneath the surface
by the end of the evening
all i felt was detached neutral
no fireworks no leftover anger
no flutters nothing
see you
i went to bed that night feeling peaceful
you okay
yeah
i was grateful that i had the family i had
and it felt good to no longer care
about bryce loski
the dinner with the bakers
had taken its toll on me
then the annual
school fundraiser arrived
and i found myself
with a whole new set of problems
i was a basketboy
to fully appreciate the humiliation
of being a basketboy
you need to know that the chosen few are
auctioned off in front of the student body
to the highestbidding females
yes technically each of us
comes with a lunch in a basket
but lets not kid ourselves
this was a beefcake parade
there he is my idol
one word youre a dead man
no man im serious
listen you wont believe this
what
two of the hottest chicks
are fighting over you
what are you talking about
sherry is breaking up with mitch
she and melanie
are having a bidding war over you
i dont care
are you nuts
sherry dumped mitch because of you
youre my idol
as comforting as it was
to be garretts idol
it didnt diminish the horror
of being basketboy number nine
and my only hope was that a giant tornado
would destroy the school before the event
it was a long shot
welcome everyone
to this years
mayfield boosters club auction

20 of mayfields finest young men
bryce bryce bryce

i wasnt interested in his hobbies
or what was in his basket
lets start the bidding at 5
all i could think of was juli
anybody
what if she did bid on me
what if she got in a bidding war
with sherry and melanie and lost out

i was contemplating the horrors
of this when

juli baker was bidding on eddie trulock

here i was having lunch
with the hottest girl in school

my dad has a cabin there
and you get the most outrageous tan
because less than 20 feet
away from me was juli
my juli with eddie trulock
shes laughing
what was she laughing about
how could she sit there and laugh
and look so beautiful
bryce are you all right

what are you staring at
nothing

bryce did you hear me
this is a really delicious lunch
can we not talk about tans or food
well what do you wanna talk about
i dont know perpetual motion

juli i gotta talk to you

bryce stop it
bryce you didnt even make it to first base
ill kiss you ha ha
juli juli
juli wait can we talk
juli
whats the matter with you
leave me alone garrett
you get a date with the finest girl
on campus and you blow it for juli
you wouldnt understand
i completely dont understand
were talking about juli baker here
nightmare neighbor knowitall nuisance
the cooppoop babe
shut up
hey have you flipped
whats the matter with you
you know what if youre gonna be like this
i dont need the association
well good because neither do i
yeah neither do i
as i walked home with the dirty
dishes clanking inside my picnic basket
all i could think of was juli
and i realized garrett was right
about one thing
i had flipped completely
hello
oh heh hi mrs baker is juli there
oh im sorry bryce
juli doesnt wanna talk
please mrs baker i gotta see her
im sorry bryce
but im afraid shes locked herself
in her room
i tried to go to bed early that night
but i couldnt sleep
i watched her house from my window
for hours
i had to find a way
to show her how i felt
monday morning
as i made my way into school
i was deciding which
of the everly brothers id rather marry
when dana tressler forced bryce
back into my brain
juli the list is out
there he is number nine your main dish
bryce loskis not my main dish
oh youre sticking to your diet
its not a diet dana
im over him okay
im glad to hear it
because rumor has it sherrys
already staking her claim on him
sherry sherry stalls
oh liz macy the list is up
that afternoon i found myself
obsessing about the basketboy auction
i could feel myself backsliding
about bryce
but why should i care if sherry liked him
i shouldnt even be thinking about him
i had to rise above this
bryce loski was no longer in my life
on the morning of the auction
i was on edge
i found myself without even knowing
how it happened staring at my egg money
i needed a strategy
it was simple
if i left my money at home
id leave temptation with it
my strategy suffered a setback
when i ran into mrs steuby
julianna
julianna
hello dear
im so sorry its taken me so long
to get this to you
but i keep missing you in the morning
mrs steuby i dont want that
you dont have to
dont be ridiculous im gonna pay you
im going to pay you
i dont want that i dont want it
yeah i want you to go out
and buy yourself something festive
pedal pushers ha ha
mrs steuby
bye dear
mrs steuby i dont want pedal pushers
no no youll look great
its okay
its okay no big deal
just pretend like i dont have it
i hear youre planning to bid on bryce
what who told you that no im not
someone saw you with a wad of cash
this morning
how much do you have
its none of your business
and im not bidding okay
i dont even like him anymore
oh thatll be the day
its true go ahead
waste your money on him i dont care
and now will you all give
a big mayfield school welcome
to your 1963 basketboys
i could say i didnt care all i wanted
but seeing bryce walk out
in his jacket and tie
holding that picnic basket
set my head spinning again
fifteen going once
the auction seemed to fly by
fifteen going twice
sold to macy taylor for 15
before i knew it
eddie trulock was called
number eight is eddie trulock
which meant bryce was next
eddie is a member of the debate team
and his hobbies include fishing
and modelairplane building
who will give me 5
why isnt anyone bidding hes so nice
exactly
nobody
eight dollars
sold to juli baker for 8
how did this happen
was it because i felt bad for eddie
or was it because i couldnt trust myself
with bryce
as i made my way
to the multipurpose room
i contemplated
the startling turn of events
here i was about to have lunch
with eddie trulock
while the boy i mooned over
for half my life
was going to share a meal
with my mortal enemy
i wanna thank you for bidding on me
it was touchandgo there for a while
no i wanted to this will be fun
i hear you like building model airplanes
yeah
my father and i just finished
a russian mig19 it was made in 1955
migs first supersonic fighter
tricky because the cockpit was recessed
i tried to give eddie my full attention
but it was difficult
because bryce was right behind him
eddie was saying something
about intake valves
when out of nowhere bryce stood up
and marched straight towards me
hey juli i gotta talk to you
what are you doing
he was going to kiss me to kiss me
all my life ive been waiting for that kiss
but not like this not this way
i pedaled home so hard
i thought my lungs would burst
julianna
julianna
honey
whats wrong
i cant
sweetheart
you can tell me
bryce tried to kiss me
he did
in school
in front of everybody
mom please dont get it
its probably him
sweetheart
maybe you should talk to him
i cant
i cant
bryce wouldnt leave me alone
he kept calling on the phone
and knocking on the door
he even snuck around the house
and tapped on my window
juli please i gotta see you
come on out just for a minute
why didnt he understand
that i just wanted to be left alone
please
after two days bryce stopped
and i thought it was finally over
then one afternoon
i was coming into the front room to read
when i heard a noise in the yard
hey whats he doing
juli calm down i gave him permission
permission permission for what
hes digging a hole
i told him he could
but why
i told him he could
it was torture seeing him
dig up my grass
how could my father let him do this
bryce knew i was there too
hes gone
a tree
hes planting a tree
is it a
i didnt really need to ask
i could tell
from the shape of the leaves
and the texture of the trunk
it was a sycamore tree
when she walked out of the door
i thought back to the first time i saw her
how could anybody ever
have wanted to run away from juli baker
he looked at me with those eyes
those once again dazzling eyes
and i knew that bryce loski
was still walking around with my first kiss
but he wouldnt be for long
as we stood there
i realized that all these years
we never really talked
do you need some help
yeah
but that day we started
and i knew wed be talking for a long time
lets do it from the beginning again
you ready and action
juli can we talk
whats going on
and
oh god
oh god here we go
the scene where were doing
the basketboy thing
where we almost kiss
that one was so hard
bryce what are you doing

and then i leave ha ha
god
you gotta be serious about this
you cant be giggling during this
okay okay
sorry
cant be giggleville
lets do it again no giggling
its supposed to be were talking
and he comes up and tries to kiss me
it was really hard i had to wait
until he got there and then im like
oh it was so embarrassing

he gets up and like walks towards me
and says can i talk to you
and he grabs me and he goes like
