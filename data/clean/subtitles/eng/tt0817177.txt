it all began in the summer of 1957 
before the start of second grade 
  here we are 
  ha  ha 
  what do you guys think 
  i like this place 
  it s cool 
  uh  what color is my room 
just you wait 
  let s see what s inside 
  hey  come on  buddy bryce 
why don t  uh  you and i
go help unload the van    
   and the womenfolk here
can get in the kitchen and start setting up 
okay  dad 
for me  it was the beginning
of what would be   
   more than half a decade of
strategic avoidance and social discomfort 
  hi  i m juli baker 
  hey  hey  what are you doing 
don t you want some help 
no  there s some
valuable things in there 
  how about this one 
  no  no  no 
run home  your mother s
probably wondering where you are 
oh  no  my mom knows where i am 
she said it s fine 
it didn t take long to realize
this girl could not take a hint 
  it s crowded in here with three people 
  i don t mind 
  of any kind 
  you wanna push this one together 
bryce  isn t it time for you
to go help your mother 
huh 
oh  yeah 
i mean  nothing would stop her 
i was about to tell her to get lost
when the weirdest thing happened 
i couldn t believe it 
there i was holding hands
with this strange girl 
  how did i get into this mess 
  well  hello 
  i see you ve met my son 
  uh huh 
finally  i did the only manly
thing available when you re 7 years old 
however  my troubles were far from over 
the minute i walked
into miss yelson s classroom   
bryce  you re here 
   it was clear 
school would not be a sanctuary 
hey  bryce  where s your girlfriend 
i was branded for life 
hey  bryce 
why don t you ask her to marry you 
bryce and juli sitting in a tree
k l s s l n g
my first year in town was a disaster 
look at them 
and the next three weren t much better 
but finally  in the sixth grade 
i took action 
i hatched the plan 
sherry 
sherry  wait up 
hi  bryce  heh 
i asked out sherry stalls 
i was wondering if you wanted to go   
to full appreciate
the brilliance of this plan   
   you have to understand
that juli hated sherry stalls   
   though i never understood why 
sherry was nice  friendly
and she had a lot of hair 
at first  my mother wouldn t let me
get my ears pierced  but i begged   
the idea was that sherry
would eat with me   
   maybe we d walk around together 
and hopefully juli would lose interest 
but i still can t get the hoops till i m 16 
oh  that s a shame 
so melanie wanted to get her ears pierced 
but of course her mother said no 
so she threw a fit and smashed
her johnny mathis greatest hits album   
   and she got grounded  so now she can t
come to my pajama sleepover party 
things were unfolding quite nicely 
what are you doing
for your science project 
that is  until my supposed
best friend  garrett einbinder   
   took an interest in sherry himself 
i was thinking of showing how split ends
react with different hair conditioners 
that s fascinating 
loyalty gave way to desire
and garrett  the turncoat   
   told sherry what i was up to 
jerk 
she didn t take it well 
word got back to juli  and pretty soon
she started up with the goo goo eyes again 
only this time it was worse 
she started sniffing me 
that s right  sniffing me 
what was that all about 
my only consolation
was that next year would be different 
junior high  bigger school 
maybe we d be in different classes
and it would finally  finally be over 
the first day i met bryce loski  i flipped 
it was those eyes 
something in those dazzling eyes 
you wanna push this one together 
his family had just moved
into the neighborhood   
   and i d gone over to help them 
i d been in the van all of two minutes
when his dad sent him off to help his mom 
i could see he didn t wanna go 
so i chased after him to see if we could
play a little before he got trapped inside 
the next thing i know 
he s holding my hand   
   and looking right into my eyes 
my heart stopped 
was this it 
would this be my first kiss 
  but then his mother came out 
  well  hello 
and he was so embarrassed 
his cheeks turned completely red 
i went to bed that night thinking
of the kiss that might have been 
i mean  it was clear he had feelings for me 
but he was just too shy to show them 
my mother said boys were like that 
  so i decided to help him out 
  bryce  you re here 
i would give him plenty
of opportunity to get over his shyness 
by the sixth grade 
i d learned to control myself 
then sherry stalls entered the picture 
sherry stalls was nothing but a whiny 
gossipy  backstabbing flirt 
all hair and no substance 
and there she was   
   holding hands with bryce  my bryce 
the one who was walking around
with my first kiss 
my solution was to ignore her 
i knew a boy of bryce s caliber   
   would eventually see through
a shallow conniver like sherry stalls 
it took all of a week 
they broke up at recess 
she didn t take it well 
now that bryce was out of sherry s
evil clutches  he started being nicer to me 
  hi  juli 
  hi  bryce 
he was so shy and so cute   
   and his hair 
it smelled like watermelon 
i couldn t get enough of it 
i spent the whole year
secretly sniffing watermelon   
   and wondering
if i was ever going to get my kiss 
seventh grade brought changes  all right 
but the biggest one
didn t happen at school 
it happened at home 
my grandfather came to live with us 
mom said he stared like that
because he missed grandma 
that was not something grandpa
would ever talk about with me 
as a matter of fact  he never talked
about much of anything with me 
that is  until juli appeared
in the local newspaper 
  oh  bryce  may i speak with you 
  what 
have a seat  son 
tell me about your friend juli baker 
juli  she s not exactly my friend 
oh  why s that 
why do you wanna know 
now  juli baker did not
wind up in the mayfield times   
   for being an eighth grade einstein 
no  she got front page coverage because
she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree 
juli baker and that stupid sycamore tree 
she always thought it was god s gift
to our little corner of the universe 
hey  bryce  wanna come climb the tree
with me and my brothers 
no  thanks 
bryce  come up here  it s fun 
i can t 
my dad needs me to help him fix   
   a thing 
that s all i needed 
climb up a tree with juli baker 
i d be dragged right back
into the second grade 
bryce and juli sitting in a tree 
why don t you just make me eat lima beans
for the rest of my life 
it s three blocks away 
two blocks 
one block away 
  like that s valuable information 
  i hate it when she does that 
i like to think there s at least a chance
the bus won t show 
i think the tree looks particularly beautiful
in this light  don t you 
if by  beautiful  you mean  unbelievably
ugly   then  yes  i would agree 
you re just visually challenged 
i feel sorry for you 
 visually challenged  
 visually challenged  
this from the girl who lived in a house
that was the joke of the neighborhood 
they had bushes growing over windows
and weeds all over the place 
it bugged my dad bigtime 
oh  there he is 
the bricklayer who thinks he s a painter 
that truck s not ugly enough in real life 
he s gotta make a painting of it 
no  he does landscapes 
sells them at the county fair 
people say they re beautiful 
landscapes  let me tell you something 
the world would have
more beauty in it   
   if he d do a little landscaping
on that piece of crap he calls a yard 
i feel bad for his wife 
she married a dreamer 
because of that  one of the two of them
will always be unhappy 
yeah  fine 
but why do we have to be unhappy 
as annoying as the yard was
to my dad   
   it was nothing compared to how annoying
juli baker was in that tree 
three blocks away 
every morning
we had to listen to the sound   
   of her blow by blow traffic report 
two blocks 
there you go 
why do they call it the three stooges 
  i mean  there s five of them 
  what 
well  yeah  there s moe  larry  curly 
shemp and curly joe 
  yeah  but they only have three at a time 
  yeah 
you know  i hate curly joe 
i mean  he shouldn t even be a stooge 
listen  girl 
i m this close to calling the police 
you are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job 
  what s going on 
  either you come down   
   or we re gonna cut you down 
  you guys  come up here with me 
they won t cut it down
if we re all up here 
  bus  bus  bus 
  juli was frantic 
they wanted to cut down her tree 
i couldn t understand why
that mutant tangle of gnarly branches   
   meant so much to her 
  bryce  please 
  i felt bad for her 
  leave her 
but i wasn t about to cut school over it 
come on  bro 
why isn t she your friend  bryce 
you d have to know juli 
well  i d like to 
why 
that girl has an iron backbone 
why don t you invite her over sometime 
an iron backbone 
she s just stubborn   
   and she s pushy beyond belief 
is that so 
and she s been stalking me
since the second grade 
well  a girl like that
doesn t live next door to everyone 
lucky them 
read this 
without prejudice 
like i needed to know
anything more about juli baker 
juli wasn t at the bus stop
the next morning 
or the morning after that 
she was at school 
but you d never know it 
  little joe  he s got so much makeup on   
  he doesn t age 
i told myself i should be glad about it 
i mean  isn t that what
i d always wanted 
but still  i felt bad for her 
i was gonna tell her i was sorry 
but then i thought  hey  no   
   that s the last thing i needed 
juli baker thinking i missed her 
i see why you like to come out here 
would you mind explaining it
to your mother 
i loved to watch my father paint 
or really  i loved to hear him talk
while he painted 
i learned a lot about my dad that way 
he told me all sorts of things   
   like how he got his first job delivering hay
and how he d wished he d finished college 
then one day he surprised me 
what s going on with you
and  uh  bryce loski 
what do you mean  nothing 
oh  okay 
my mistake 
why would you even think that 
no reason 
just that you   
   talk about him all the time 
i do 
mm hm 
i don t know 
i guess it s something about his eyes 
or maybe his smile 
but what about him 
  what 
  you have to look at the whole landscape 
what does that mean 
a painting is more
than the sum of its parts 
a cow by itself is just a cow 
a meadow by itself is just grass 
flowers 
and the sun peeking through the trees
is just a beam of light 
but you put them all together   
   and it can be magic 
i didn t really understand
what he was saying until one afternoon   
   when i was up in the sycamore tree 
i was rescuing a kite 
it was a long way up 
higher than i d ever been 
and the higher i got 
the more amazed i was by the view 
i began to notice
how wonderful the breeze smelled 
like sunshine and wild grass 
i couldn t stop breathing it in   
   filling my lungs
with the sweetest smell i d ever known 
hey  you found my kite 
bryce  you should come up here 
it s so beautiful 
i can t  i sprained my  um   
i have a rash 
from that moment on 
that became my spot 
i could sit there for hours 
just looking out at the world 
some days the sunsets
would be purple and pink 
and some days
they were a blazing orange   
   setting fire to the clouds
on the horizon 
it was during one of those sunsets
that my father s idea   
   of the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts   
   moved from my head to my heart 
some days i would get there extra early
to watch the sunrise 
one morning
i was making mental notes   
   of how the streaks of light
were cutting through the clouds   
   so i could tell my dad   
   when i heard a noise below 
excuse me 
excuse me  i m sorry  but you can t
park there  that s a bus stop 
hey  what are you doing up there 
you can t be up there 
we re gonna take this thing down 
  the tree 
  yeah  now come on down 
  but who told you  you could cut it down 
  the owner 
why 
he s gonna build a house 
and this tree s in the way 
  so come on  girl  we got work to do 
  you can t cut it down  you just can t 
listen  girl 
i m this close to calling the police 
you are trespassing and obstructing
progress on a contracted job 
now either you come down 
or we re gonna cut you down 
go ahead  cut me down 
i m not coming down 
i m never coming down 
bryce  you guys  come up here with me 
they won t cut it down
if we re all up here 
bryce  please don t let them do this 
come on  you guys 
bryce  please  you don t have to
come up this high  just a little ways 
bryce  please  please 
what happened after that was a blur 
it seemed like the whole town was there 
but still i wouldn t move 
then my father showed up 
he talked a fireman into letting him come up
to where i was 
sweetie  it s time to come down 
daddy  please don t let them do this 
  sweetie   
  daddy  look 
you can see everything 
you can see the whole world from here 
no view is worth my daughter s safety 
now  come on 
i can t 
julianna  it s time to come down now 
please  daddy 
it s time 
and that was it 
i must ve cried for two weeks straight 
oh  sure  i went to school
and did the best i could   
   but nothing seemed to matter 
  juli 
  huh 
do you know the answer 
uh  the peloponnesian war 
i m sure that s the answer
to something   
   but i was looking for the area
of a rhomboid 
somehow  rhomboids
and isosceles right triangles   
   didn t seem so important 
i rode my bike so i wouldn t have to pass
by the stump   
   that used to be the earth s
most magnificent sycamore tree 
but no matter what i did 
i couldn t stop thinking about it 
are you okay 
it was just a tree 
no  it wasn t just a tree 
i never want you to forget how you felt
when you were up there 
thanks  dad 
it was the first thing i saw every morning   
   and the last thing i saw
before i went to sleep 
and once i could look at it
without crying   
   i saw more than the tree
and what being up there meant to me 
i saw the day that my view of things
around me started changing 
and i wondered 
did i still feel the same things about bryce 
i ve never been a huge fan of eggs 
i mean  i could always just take them
or leave them 
that is  until one day
in skyler brown s garage   
   when my feelings about eggs
were solidified 
hey  hey  hey  guys 
edna s found her breakfast 
i mean  if a slimy reptile
found them appetizing   
   there was certainly no place for them
in my diet 
oh  man  that s so cool 
she doesn t even have to chew 
i mean  think of all the time you d save 
i could ve gone my whole life
not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw   
   if it hadn t been for lynetta 
she had a major league thing
for skyler brown 
i think it s gross 
he and juli s brothers 
matt and mark  had formed a band 
and lynetta would watch them practice 
that is so neat 
how about that  huh  bryce 
yeah  neat 
so  brycie  how do you think
he s gonna digest that 
  stomach acid 
  you d like to think that 
wait  everybody quiet  here he goes 
eggs over easy 
gross  gross  gross  gross 
wait  wait 
you haven t seen the best part 
ugh 
gross 
i tried to be casual about it 
but it didn t take 
i started having bad dreams 
i d be trapped inside a huge egg   
   and this monster would open his jaws
and start to devour me 
i d wake up just in time 
then the real nightmare began 
hi  bryce  i brought these over
for you and your family 
  my chickens are laying eggs 
  what 
you remember abby and bonnie and clyde
and dexter and eunice and florence 
  the ones i hatched for the science fair 
  how could i forget 
it was classic juli baker 
she totally dominated the fair 
and get this  her project
was all about watching boring eggs hatch 
i mean  here i had a live action
erupting volcano   
   and all anyone cared about
was juli s boring chicks   
   breaking out of their boring shells 
oh  i think the last one s hatching 
  it s hatching 
  oh  it s hatching 
kids  come over here 
but hey  she won  i lost 
i ve never been one to dwell 
here it comes 
but that didn t mean
i had to eat her lousy eggs 
i think it was very sweet of juli
to bring us those eggs 
i don t care 
i m still having cereal tomorrow 
yeah  how do we know there s no chicks
in one of those eggs 
i used to eat farm fresh eggs
when i was a kid  they were delicious 
yeah  well  that s all well and good   
   but what if we crack one open
and a dead chick falls out 
do they have a rooster  if they don t
have a rooster the eggs can t be fertile 
and if they had a rooster  we d know 
the whole neighborhood would know 
maybe they got it de yodeled 
 de yodeled  
you know  de cock a doodle doo d 
what the hell are you talking about 
like they de bark dogs 
bryce  why don t you just ask juli 
what 
  you afraid to talk to her 
  i m not afraid to talk to her 
i know you are  but what am i 
  okay  just talk to her and find out 
  bryce 
how do you tell if one s a rooster 
  well  a rooster s bigger  longer feathers 
  mm hm 
they ve got that red stuff
growing out of their head 
  and around their neck too 
  that shouldn t be too hard to spot 
although  come to think of it 
chickens have the rubbery red stuff too 
just not as much 
garrett s expertise in roosters   
   was the cornerstone of our plan
to avoid contact with juli baker 
the balance of which involved
spying over her back fence 
  come on  come on 
  shh  shh 
over here 
i can t see the stupid chickens 
we gotta get them out of the coop 
is that a rooster 
no  it looks like a chicken 
how can you tell 
it just does 
see what i mean  expertise 
  shh  shh 
  what 
juli 
here  guys 
go on  there you go 
  here  guys  go on 
  yeah  they re all chickens 
  there s no rooster 
  what did i just say 
how can you tell 
  well  none of them are strutting 
  here  come on 
  roosters strut 
  come on  guys 
  what did i just say 
  here 
plus  hardly any of them
have any rubbery red stuff 
  what are you doing 
  yeah  they re definitely all chickens 
they re all chickens 
i m proud of you  bryce 
  you overcame your fear 
  huh 
  you talked to her 
  oh  heh  yeah 
it s no big deal 
that s what she told you 
they re all chickens 
yeah 
she s a genius  you re both genius   
of course they re all chickens 
a rooster s a chicken  the question is 
is one of them a rooster
or are they all hens 
hens  who said anything about hens 
then it hit me 
garrett didn t know jack shit
about chickens 
  do roosters strut 
  yes  they do 
what does that have to do
with anything 
they re all hens 
well  the main thing is the eggs are okay 
it s all settled 
not for me 
there was no way
i was ever gonna eat anything   
   that had anything to do
with juli baker 
i m not eating them 
well  why not 
have you seen their yard  it s   
there s not even any grass 
it s all mud and chicken turds 
ew  gross  salmonella 
do you suppose
they could have salmonella 
  it s not very likely 
  why take the risk 
what do we do with the eggs 
give them back 
  give them back  to juli 
  sure 
you talked to her before  right 
it didn t kill you 
well  what do i say 
tell her we don t eat eggs 
uh  we re allergic to them or something 
come on  use your brains 
it didn t feel right to lie 
besides  even a seventh grader would know
that entire families aren t allergic to eggs 
but i didn t wanna
hurt her feelings either 
so that left me with only one option 
and thus another near death
experience   
   in my ongoing saga with juli baker
had been successfully avoided 
until one week later 
hi  bryce  brought you some more eggs 
wow 
  thanks 
  did your family like the first batch 
do you even have to ask 
great  see you at school 
what i hoped would be
a one time event   
   was just the beginning of a life consumed
with lies  intrigue and deception 
every morning
i d be on the lookout for juli   
   so if she happened to come  i could whip
the door open before she knocked 
thanks 
then i d dump the eggs
before anyone noticed 
and why  why couldn t i just face her 
why couldn t i just say 
 no  thanks  don t want them 
don t need them  give them to the snake  
was i really afraid
of hurting her feelings   
   or was i just afraid of her 
now  you wanna make sure you get it   
when mrs  brubeck first suggested
hatching eggs as my science project   
   i was less than excited 
that is  until i saw my first sign of life 
is that it 
wow 
  it looks like a bean 
  it does 
let s try the other ones 
suddenly it felt real 
all the eggs were alive 
there were  like  little bean babies
inside every one 
on the day of the fair 
all six chicks hatched 
what are the odds 
this year s top prize goes to juli baker   
   for her wonderful project 
 a chicken is born  
i won first place 
and that was cool 
but all i really cared about were my chicks 
there you go  there you go  guys 
my mom wasn t crazy
about us raising chickens 
but i begged and pleaded 
i told her i would take care of everything 
and i did 
where s clyde 
clyde 
hey  clyde  what s the matter 
are you okay  aren t you hungry 
come on  come here 
what s wrong  baby 
come here 
hey  you re not clyde  you re clydette 
mom 
as it turned out  my hens
laid more eggs than we could eat 
at first we tried to keep up   
   but after a month of boiling 
frying and deviling   
   like that movie the blob 
we were being overtaken by eggs 
then opportunity in the form
of our neighbor  mrs  steuby  knocked 
hello  dear 
if you ever have any extra 
i d be happy to buy them from you 
  really 
  certainly 
and i happen to know that mrs  helms
would be interested as well 
  great 
  nothing like fresh eggs 
  thanks  mrs  steuby 
  you bet  dear  bye 
between mrs  steuby and mrs  helms 
my egg overflow problem was solved 
then i realized that mrs  loski
deserved eggs too 
but i didn t think it would be right
to charge her 
she had been such a good neighbor 
lending us supplies when we ran out   
   giving my mother a ride
when our car wouldn t start   
   it was the least i could do 
besides  if i happened to run into bryce 
that wouldn t be the end of the world 
hi  bryce 
by the third time i brought eggs over
to the loskis   
   i realized bryce was waiting for me 
waiting to pull open the door and say 
 thanks  juli  see you at school  
and in return 
i got a few moments alone   
   with the world s most dazzling eyes 
thanks  juli  see you at school 
it was a bargain 
until the day it wasn t 
it was two weeks after the sycamore tree
was cut down   
   and i was just starting
to feel normal again 
hey  juli  right on schedule 
yeah  well  neither rain nor sleet 
  huh 
  you know  the mailman thing 
oh  right 
so  um  will you start
riding the bus again 
i don t know 
i haven t been up there since   
it doesn t look so bad anymore 
it s all cleared away 
well  um  i better get ready for school 
guess i ll see you there 
see you 
maybe bryce was right 
maybe it was time
i started riding the bus again 
after all  didn t he just tell me
he wanted me to 
could it be that bryce loski
actually misses me 
juli  what are you still doing here 
i was just thinking 
it s pickup day  the cans are in front 
i know  you need some help 
no  maybe i ll do it later 
are those my eggs 
yeah  yeah  i dropped them 
they re not broken 
why are you throwing them away 
don t you want them 
it wasn t me 
my dad didn t think it was worth the risk 
risk  what risk 
salmonella 
what  he s afraid of being poisoned 
well  juli  i mean  look at your back yard 
it s a complete mess 
it s  like  covered in turds 
that s not true 
i clean up after my girls every day 
we just didn t wanna hurt your feelings 
have you always thrown them away 
you know  mrs  steuby and mrs  helms
pay me for my eggs 
  they do 
  they pay me 60 cents a dozen 
i didn t know 
how could you 
i m sorry 
no  you re not 
it didn t take me long to realize   
   that i d traded in my old problems
with juli baker   
   for a whole set of new ones 
it was actually worse having her mad at me
than having her annoy me 
the way she ignored me
was a constant reminder   
   that i d been a jerk 
then one day i was coming home
from playing basketball with garrett   
   and things got weird 
don t be so timid 
come on  you won t hurt them 
  like this 
  yeah  that s it 
my grandfather 
all i ever saw him wear was slippers 
now  where did he get those work boots 
i couldn t stop looking over there 
and the more i looked  the madder i got 
my grandfather had already said
more to juli in one hour   
   than he d said to me in the whole time
he d been living with us 
i was pretty sure
i d never seen him laugh 
and what was his deal with juli baker 
hi  grandpa 
juli told me about the eggs 
you know  bryce   
   one s character is set at an early age 
i d hate to see you swim out so far
you can t swim back 
sir 
it s about honesty  son 
sometimes a little discomfort
in the beginning   
   can save a whole lot of pain
down the road 
when it came to holding a grudge 
juli baker was truly impressive 
all week i tried to approach her
at school 
she d always find some way to duck me 
and whenever she was in her yard 
grandpa was always there with her 
finally  one saturday i saw my opening 
my grandfather had gone into town
to buy some bengay 
i guess the yard work
was starting to get to him 
it s looking real good 
thanks  chet did most of it 
i m sorry for what i did 
i just don t get it  bryce 
why didn t you just tell me 
i don t know  it was dumb 
and i shouldn t have said anything
about your yard  either 
it wasn t right 
maybe it s all for the best 
i mean  look  i learned so much from chet 
it s amazing 
you re lucky 
i don t even have grandparents anymore 
oh 
i feel sorry for him 
he misses your grandma 
can you believe it 
he says i remind him of her 
  what 
  i know  that s what i said 
but he meant it in a nice way 
something about her spirit 
yeah 
well   
good luck with the grass 
i m sure it ll come up great 
thanks 
i guess i ll see you around 
i guess so 
while juli s acceptance of
my apology was not all that i d hoped for   
   at least the eggs thing
was finally behind me 
the first time in months
i could truly enjoy bonanza 
where you going
and why you dressed like that 
skyler s 
matt and mark are bringing over recording
stuff and they re gonna make a demo 
demo  like they know how
to make a demo 
  you don t even know them 
  i don t have to  i know the type 
  you don t know anything 
  don t talk to me like that 
  i m late 
  be back by 11 
yep  everything was back to normal 
is that girl working you too hard 
that girl s name is juli 
and  no  she isn t working me too hard 
you ve developed
quite a soft spot for her  huh 
steven 
no  patsy  just wanna find out
why your father has the energy   
   to befriend a complete stranger   
   when he won t throw a baseball around
with his own grandson 
  it s okay  dad 
  no  it s not okay 
juli reminds him of grandma 
of renee  heh 
that s ridiculous 
you know why the bakers
haven t fixed their yard 
yeah  because he s too busy
with his paint by numbers kit 
if you had a brother with a severe handicap 
what would you do 
what the hell
does that have to do with anything 
juli s father has a retarded brother 
so what  he s not the gardener 
is he  heh 
ha ha ha 
it was a joke 
you know 
other people have family troubles   
   and they manage
to mow their own lawns 
i don t know where their pride
in ownership is 
they don t own that house 
the landlord s supposed to maintain it 
mr  baker puts every extra penny he has
into caring for his brother 
don t they have government facilities
for that sort of thing 
maybe they thought that a private facility
would be better for him 
either way  it s not our fault that their
family has some chromosomal abnormality 
it has nothing to do with chromosomes 
when juli s uncle was born  he had
the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck 
if he d had enough oxygen  he would ve
been a perfect little baby  just like your son 
goddamn it  chet 
  patsy  patsy 
  leave me alone 
sorry about that 
why is mom so upset 
because   
   but for the grace of god   
   your mother could be standing
in mr  baker s shoes 
did her brother have the cord
wrapped around his neck too 
you did 
luckily  the doctor who delivered you
was on the ball and got it untangled   
   but it easily could ve gone
the other way 
  wanna go for a walk 
  huh 
i find it helps clear the mind 
what would they have done with me 
you can t dwell on something
that might ve been  bryce 
the way my dad was talking  sounds like
he would ve thrown me in a nuthouse 
no  no  now  that s not fair 
you can t condemn him
for something he hasn t done 
this is where that tree was  wasn t it 
yeah 
must ve been a spectacular view 
she s quite a girl 
some of us get dipped in flat   
   some in satin   
   some in gloss 
but every once in a while   
   you find someone who s iridescent 
and when you do   
   nothing will ever compare 
flat  glossy  iridescent 
what the hell did that mean 
juli baker had always
just seemed plain to me 
until now 
and the way she talked about
what it felt like to be up in that tree   
   to be held above the earth 
brushed by the wind 
who in junior high talks like that 
this weird feeling started taking over
in the pit of my stomach   
   and i didn t like it 
i was slipping  man 
and it was time to get a grip 
i d never been embarrassed
by where we lived before 
i also never really thought about money 
i knew we weren t rich  but i didn t feel
like we were missing anything 
that is  until bryce loski
called our home a complete mess 
  what s your name 
  what s your name 
is it mary or sue 
what s your name 
do i stand a chance with you 
it s so hard to find a personality
with charms like yours for me
ooh ee  ooh ee  ooh ee
i had to do something
and i knew what it was 
what s your name 
  oh  you re sounding really good 
  yeah 
we ll record it in skyler s garage 
that s a wonderful project 
speaking of projects  i was thinking
it might be cool to fix up the yard 
  what 
  i mean  how much can grass seed cost 
i could plant a lawn 
maybe some flowers 
i could even put up a fence 
honey  that s a major undertaking 
  i could pay for it with my egg money 
  no  that s your money 
the landlord should be the one
taking care of all this 
but he doesn t  and we live here 
and it looks so bad 
jules 
what s going on 
nothing  dad 
it s okay  sweetheart 
you can tell us 
the loskis have been throwing away my
eggs because they re afraid of salmonella 
because our yard is such a mess 
did patsy say that 
no  bryce did 
but it must have been
a family discussion 
a boy doesn t come up with that
on his own 
  who cares what they think 
  yeah  who cares 
trina 
let s not get into this 
no  i m tired of living like this  richard 
i m tired of having to take temp jobs
just to make ends meet 
i m tired of having to push a chair up
against the washing machine   
   just to keep the door shut 
i m tired of having to borrow
mrs  steuby s vacuum cleaner   
   every time ours breaks down 
do you think this is the life
i pictured for us 
sometimes you have to sacrifice
to do the right thing 
we always end up agreeing that devonhurst
is the right thing for daniel 
well  maybe we should start thinking
about what s right for us 
our daughter is suffering
because we won t fix up our own yard 
it s not our yard 
how can you say that  richard  how 
we ve lived here for 12 years   
   and for 12 years we ve been saying
it s temporary  but it s not 
this is our home 
is it wrong to wanna live somewhere
you can be proud of 
to have enough to send your kids
to college 
maybe it s time
we considered government care 
we are not moving my brother 
he s more important
than your own children 
  dad 
  how dare you 
stop it  dad  please  just stop 
i m sorry  julianna  this is not your fault 
we ll work this out  i promise 
that was the first time i ever heard
my parents really yell at each other 
i m sorry about tonight 
that night they each came into my room 
my father talked about his brother
and how much he loved him   
   and how he promised his parents
he d always take care of him 
my mother talked about how much
she loved my father   
   for his strength and kind heart 
when she kissed me good night   
   she whispered that of all her
many blessings  i was her best 
i felt sorry for my father 
i felt sorry for my mother 
but most of all 
i felt lucky for me that they were mine 
i wanted to think the reason
i started working on my yard   
   had nothing to do with bryce 
it was about making our house better 
after what he did with the eggs 
why should i care what he thought 
but i did 
are you pruning that
or trying to hack it to death 
hi  i m chet duncan 
bryce s grandfather 
sorry it s taken me so long
to come over and introduce myself 
nice to meet you 
so are you trimming all these
to the same height 
well  yeah  that s what i was thinking 
but i don t know 
do you think it would look better
to take them out 
oh  these are hicksii shrubs 
these will prune up nicely 
listen  mr  duncan 
call me chet 
chet 
if you re here
because of what bryce said   
   i don t need your help 
read about you in the paper 
renee would ve sat up in that tree
with you 
she would ve sat up there all night 
renee 
my wife 
you remind me a lot of her 
we worked on the yard for weeks 
and the whole time we worked 
we talked 
  right there 
  perfect  yeah 
he wanted to know more
about the sycamore tree 
he knew exactly what it meant   
   about the whole being greater
than the sum of its parts 
he said it was the same with people   
   but sometimes with people 
the whole could be less 
i thought that was pretty interesting 
i started looking at people
i d known since elementary school   
   trying to figure out if they were more
or less than the sum of their parts 
chet was right  a lot of them were less 
of all my classmates  the one person
i couldn t seem to place was bryce 
until recently  i would ve said
with absolute certainty   
   that he was greater  far greater 
than the sum of his parts 
but now i wasn t so sure 
it s looking good  juli  nice job 
thanks  chet did most of it 
i m sorry for what i did 
i just don t get it  bryce 
why didn t you just tell me 
was he really sorry 
or was he just saying these things
to make himself feel better 
then i thought maybe i just wanted him
to be more than the sum of his parts 
but as i looked into his eyes   
   those dazzling eyes   
   for the first time   
   i was pretty sure
that bryce loski was less 
we re going to invite the bakers
over for dinner 
  what 
  i don t know  mom 
i think that s a marvelous idea 
patsy  what purpose does this serve 
trina baker is a very nice person 
  and matt and mark are really cool 
  i hate cool 
something we should ve done years ago 
yeah  but we didn t  and now we can t 
the statute of limitations has run out 
we re having the bakers over for dinner 
if this is about what i said last night 
i m sorry  okay 
but  you know  having them over for dinner
is not gonna fix his brother 
it s going to be a sit down dinner 
and i expect everyone
to dress accordingly 
oh  god  can t we just have a barbecue 
it s going to be a sit down dinner 
just shoot me now 
careful what you wish for 
so that was it 
a dress up  sit down dinner with juli baker
was in my immediate future 
and that made seeing juli at school
more uncomfortable 
i found myself staring at her in class 
and the way her hair fell back
over her shoulders   
   she looked just like the picture
in the newspaper 
dana tressler caught me watching 
if i didn t do something fast 
this could spread like wildfire 
there was a bee in her hair 
see  there it goes 
there s no bee 
it flew out the window 
i convinced myself i d dodged a bullet 
i had to put juli out of my mind 
keep the focus on the important stuff
like schoolwork 
my weakness was unnerving 
i need your sharpener 
  you ever heard of knocking 
  hey  what you got there  dad s playboy 
none of your business 
  give my best to miss october 
  get out 
  or should i say your best  ha  ha 
  you re disgusting 
another disaster avoided 
my life had become a minefield 
  hey  man 
  hey 
  hey  man 
  hey 
what s this 
whoa 
it s not what you think 
okay  it is what you think 
but i can explain 
okay  i can t explain 
can we just talk about it later 
whatever you say 
i had to talk to someone 
why not garrett 
maybe he could help me get back on track 
garrett was surprisingly sensitive
in matters of the heart 
are you freaking mental  juli baker 
you hate her 
that s what s weird  i don t think i do 
i can t stop thinking about her 
  you got it bad  man 
  well  what do i do 
well  you gotta nip this in the bud 
these aren t real emotions 
  they re not 
  you feel guilty because of the egg thing 
yeah  and i insulted her yard 
exactly  of course 
the place is a dump anyways 
her dad s got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him 
a retard  well  shoot 
that ought to tell you something 
  about what 
  about juli 
what are you saying 
the apple doesn t fall far from the tree 
i couldn t believe it 
i wanted to yell at him 
tell him that he didn t know juli
like i did 
but all that came out was 
heh  oh 
  right 
  yeah 
right  um  i ll talk to you later 
i was supposed to go
to garrett s after school   
   but i couldn t be around him 
he d crossed the line 
and standing right next to him
across that line was my father 
i didn t care what they thought 
i liked juli baker 
sunday mornings
are peaceful in our house 
my dad lets himself sleep in 
my mother lets herself not fix breakfast 
if my brothers have been out late
playing with their band   
   you won t even know they re around
till noon 
but this sunday  i woke up feeling weird 
i had to do something to shake off
the confused feelings about bryce   
   that were starting to creep back in 
you really did it  didn t you  heh 
  proud of you 
  thanks  dad 
  where you going

i don t know why 
it was always something my dad did alone 
we didn t say much to each other on
the drive to devonhurst  but i didn t care 
i just liked being with my dad 
somehow the silence seemed to connect us
in a way that words never could 
the residents tend to the grounds
as part of their therapy 
it takes some getting used to 
they re good people  though 
daniel

how difficult life was for daniel 
but i never really understood it until now 
  yeah  there you go 
  heh  orange 
on the walk back 
daniel acted like nothing had happened 
other way  other way 
on the ride home 
my dad told me that uncle daniel   
   used to live with him and mom
before we were born 
but after a while  it became too difficult 
when we got home 
everything looked the same 
but it wasn t 
before today  daniel had always been
just a name to me 
now he was part of the family 
  hey 
  hey 
how d it go 
i m glad i went 
i m glad you went too 
trina  it s sunday 
what are you doing mopping the floor 
patty loski invited us over for dinner
friday night 
shouldn t she be mopping her floor 
or did she ask to borrow ours 
nervous energy 
  did she invite all of us 
  yes  she did 
even our friend sal monella 
richard 
why  after all these years 
well  she said she felt really bad
that they hadn t invited us before   
   and apparently they want
to get to know us better 
and you wanna go 
well  she insisted 
and i think it would be really nice 
all right 
we ll go 
i wasn t too thrilled about dinner
with the loskis   
   but i could see it meant a lot
to my mother 
at school the next day 
i couldn t seem to concentrate 
my thoughts kept running back to daniel 
i wondered what my grandparents
had gone through having a son like him   
   when reality interrupted 
  bryce loski likes you 
  what 
he s got a big crush on you 
what are you talking about 
bryce loski does not have a crush on me 
oh  yeah 
in science  i caught him staring at you 
he said it was because there was a bee
in your hair 
is that the lamest cover up or what 
maybe there was a bee 
the only bee you re attracting
is b r y c e 
i m telling you 
that boy is lost in love land 
  come on 
  where 
i saw him sneaking off with garrett 
come on 
are you freaking mental 
juli baker  you hate her 
that s what s so weird  i don t think i do 
i can t stop thinking about her 
  you got it bad  man 
  what do i do 
you gotta nip this in the bud 
they re not 
you feel guilty because of the egg thing 
yeah  and i insulted her yard 
exactly  the place is a dump anyways 
her dad s got a retarded brother
and all their money goes to helping him 
a retard 
well  that ought to tell you something 
  about what 
  about juli 
what are you saying 
the apple doesn t fall far
from the tree  my friend 
  oh  heh  yeah  right 
  yeah 
i ll talk to you later 
okay 
i m sorry  i thought   
it s okay  it s fine 
and it was 
because now my confusion was gone 
i was sure i no longer liked
bryce loski 
mom  are you trying to make the bakers
feel totally worthless 
i want it to be nice 
  and why aren t you dressed 
  i m going 
i wanted to look good for juli 
but i didn t want her to think
that i wanted to look good for her 
it was a fine line 
a very fine line 
bryce  they re here  come on down 
coming 
hey  come on in 
  come in  come in 
  there goes the waistline 
i m glad you could make it 
lynetta  steven  company s here 
  coming 
  what is this  homemade pie 
yes  it s pecan
and blueberry cheesecake 
let s take them to the kitchen 
  hi  guys 
  hey  looking good 
  this is my dad 
  hi  i m lynetta 
  hi  nice to finally meet you 
  nice to meet you too 
hey  big guy 
hey  steven  how are you 
we should ve done this a long time ago 
come on in 
this is a cool place 
yeah  it s all right 
come on  i ll show you my room 
you gotta hear this new song we wrote 
it s so good 
hi 
you look nice 
i heard you and garrett
making fun of my uncle in the library 
and i don t wanna speak to you 
not now  not ever 
  and i say you can 
  but what you re proposing   
   would require a perpetual motion
machine  so it s not possible 
if you had two opposite charged poles
with a neutral conductor   
perpetual motion 
here i was  dying inside  and they
were talking about perpetual motion 
and how did juli know
about all that stuff 
come on  everybody  dinner s ready 
lynetta 
dinner 
juli  can i talk to you 
it was wrong  what garrett said 
i know it 
did you know it was wrong
when he said it 
yeah  i wanted to punch him 
but we were in the library 
so instead you just agreed with him
and laughed 
yeah 
then that makes you a coward 
i had to sit across from juli
for an entire dinner 
my dad was right 
we should have barbecued 
i just want to say how wonderful it is
to have you share a meal with us 
may it be the first of many 
wrong pipe 
well  we couldn t be happier 
we are just all so thrilled to be here 
juli  you did a really nice job
on your yard 
thanks  chet was a big help 
yeah  i know 
you gotta tell me your secret 
i can t get him to do a thing around here 
  steven 
  i kid 
i m telling you  the neighborhood
is really coming to life 
i mean  that new house is taking shape 
which one 
you know  the one where they cut down
that big ugly tree 
i wanted to say that a lot of people
liked that tree  but i didn t 
i didn t want to go against my dad 
some people thought that tree
was the jewel of the neighborhood 
yeah  well 
there s no accounting for taste 
so  matt  mark  mark  matt   
you guys are  uh  gonna be
graduating soon  huh 
yeah  thank god 
you don t like high school 
  you kidding 
  no 
high school was the best time of my life 
  not for us  no 
  yeah  we ve had enough of that scene 
ah 
so college is probably
out of the question  huh 
no  it s a possibility 
they ve actually been accepted   
   at several places already 
  yes  they have 
really 
well  that s good 
but  um 
we re gonna give music a shot first 
  really 
  oh  they are very talented 
oh  their band is really boss 
they did a bunch of demos
and they re really cool 
thanks  lyn 
when steven and i first met 
he was playing in a band 
you played in a band 
he was a wonderful saxophone player 
  cool  you still play 
  well  l   
well  if you want 
you can come jam out with us sometime 
uh  you   
no  i mean    heh 
that s not me anymore 
have you boys ever performed
in front of an audience 
a lot of times 
the more matt and mark
talked about their musical exploits   
   the quieter my dad got 
he tried to plaster on a smile
now and then   
   but underneath he seemed really sad 
but my parents didn t like him at first 
republicans fought like crazy
against the new deal 
the rest of the evening
was painless enough 
but through it all 
juli didn t say a word to me 
never even looked at me 
until she was about to leave 
i m sorry i was so angry
when we first came in 
i think everyone had a good time 
your mom was really nice to invite us 
see you 
her apology made things worse 
  hey  wait for me 
  i knew i wasn t forgiven 
it was like i wasn t even important enough
to hold a grudge against 
well  i think they re a delightful family 
those boys were nothing like i expected 
i thought they were very nice young men 
  hoodlums 
  what 
how you think they can afford
all that recording gear 
steven  please 
you can t just make an accusation like that 
don t be so naive  patsy 
do you know how expensive it is
to record a demo 
they re probably stealing hubcaps 
for chrissake 
you are such an asshole 
what is the matter with you 
go to hell 
don t you talk to me like that 
steven  stop 
nobody talks to me like that   
   in my own house 
  stop 
i d seen my father angry before 
but this was different 
as i lay in bed that night   
   i thought about how my dad
always looked down on the bakers 
and how he d called them trash
and made fun of mr  baker s paintings 
and now i realized
he was just mad at himself 
but why 
juli called me a coward 
was it possible my dad
was a coward too 
i didn t know 
what difference did it make 
juli baker was out of my life 
or  more accurately   
   i was out of hers 
as i was getting dressed
for the loskis  dinner party   
   i found myself staring at the painting
my father had given me   
   and became furious all over again 
bryce had never been
a friend to me  ever 
he hadn t taken my side about the tree   
   he d thrown away my eggs   
   and he made fun of me
at my uncle s expense 
when my mother called
that it was time to go   
juli  let s go  we re late 
i went out with every intention of
telling her that i wasn t going to the loskis 
please hold these  i need to check my hair
really quickly one more time 
  your hair is perfect 
  really 
but she looked so happy   
   and she d gone to so much trouble
over the pies that i couldn t 
ooh  oh  my gosh 
oh  god  what a disaster 
okay  here  hold one  and you hold this 
  i don t wanna hold it 
  i won t have you hold it 
let s go  boys 
but that didn t mean
i had to be nice to bryce 
and i don t wanna speak to you 
not now  not ever 
it felt good to take charge 
i felt strong  in control 
i told bryce what i thought   
   and i was determined not to talk to him
for the rest of the evening 
at dinner it struck me that we were sharing
a meal with a group of strangers 
we d lived across the street
from the loskis for years   
   but except for chet 
i didn t know these people at all 
mr  loski was clean and smooth
on the outside   
   but it seemed like there was something
rotten buried just beneath the surface 
by the end of the evening 
all i felt was detached  neutral 
no fireworks  no leftover anger   
   no flutters  nothing 
see you 
i went to bed that night feeling peaceful 
  you okay 
  yeah 
i was grateful that i had the family i had 
and it felt good to no longer care
about bryce loski 
the dinner with the bakers
had taken its toll on me 
then the annual
school fundraiser arrived   
   and i found myself
with a whole new set of problems 
i was a basketboy 
to fully appreciate the humiliation
of being a basketboy   
   you need to know that the chosen few are
auctioned off in front of the student body   
   to the highest bidding females 
yes  technically  each of us
comes with a lunch in a basket   
   but let s not kid ourselves 
this was a beefcake parade 
there he is  my idol 
one word  you re a dead man 
no  man  i m serious 
listen  you won t believe this 
what 
two of the hottest chicks
are fighting over you 
  what are you talking about 
  sherry is breaking up with mitch 
she and melanie
are having a bidding war over you 
i don t care 
are you nuts 
sherry dumped mitch because of you 
you re my idol 
as comforting as it was
to be garrett s idol   
   it didn t diminish the horror
of being basketboy number nine 
and my only hope was that a giant tornado
would destroy the school before the event 
it was a long shot

i wasn t interested in his hobbies

  let s start the bidding at  5 
  all i could think of was juli 
  anybody 
  what if she did bid on me

i was contemplating the horrors
of this when   
eight dollars

juli baker was bidding on eddie trulock

oh  the boosters will be very grateful

it s strange 
here i was  having lunch
with the hottest girl in school   
   and i was miserable 
we re going up to the lake 
my dad has a cabin there   
   and you get the most outrageous tan 
because less than 20 feet
away from me was juli 
my juli with eddie trulock 
she s laughing 
what was she laughing about 
how could she sit there and laugh
and look so beautiful 
bryce  are you all right 
what 
what are you staring at 
nothing 
lunch is really delicious  bryce 
bryce  did you hear me 
this is a really delicious lunch 
can we not talk about tans or food 
well  what do you wanna talk about 
i don t know  perpetual motion 
do you know anything about that

i don t know what came over me 
it was like i was possessed or something 
  juli  i gotta talk to you 
  what 
what s going on  bryce 
what are you doing 
bryce  stop it 
bryce  you didn t even make it to first base 
i ll kiss you  ha  ha 
juli  juli 
juli  wait  can we talk 
juli 
  what s the matter with you 
  leave me alone  garrett 
you get a date with the finest girl
on campus and you blow it for juli 
  you wouldn t understand 
  i completely don t understand 
we re talking about juli baker here 
nightmare neighbor  know it all nuisance 
the coop poop babe 
shut up 
hey  have you flipped 
what s the matter with you 
you know what  if you re gonna be like this 
i don t need the association 
  well  good  because neither do i 
  yeah  neither do i 
as i walked home with the dirty
dishes clanking inside my picnic basket   
   all i could think of was juli 
and i realized garrett was right
about one thing 
i had flipped  completely 
hello 
oh  heh  hi  mrs  baker  is juli there 
oh  i m sorry  bryce 
juli doesn t wanna talk 
please  mrs  baker  i gotta see her 
i m sorry  bryce 
but i m afraid she s locked herself
in her room 
i tried to go to bed early that night   
   but i couldn t sleep 
i watched her house from my window
for hours 
i had to find a way
to show her how i felt 
monday morning 
as i made my way into school   
   i was deciding which
of the everly brothers i d rather marry   
   when dana tressler forced bryce
back into my brain 
juli  the list is out 
there he is  number nine  your main dish 
bryce loski s not my main dish 
  oh  you re sticking to your diet 
  it s not a diet  dana 
  i m over him  okay 
  i m glad to hear it 
because rumor has it sherry s
already staking her claim on him 
sherry  sherry stalls 
oh  liz  macy  the list is up 
that afternoon  i found myself
obsessing about the basketboy auction 
i could feel myself backsliding
about bryce 
but why should i care if sherry liked him 
i shouldn t even be thinking about him 
i had to rise above this 
bryce loski was no longer in my life 
on the morning of the auction 
i was on edge 
i found myself  without even knowing
how it happened  staring at my egg money 
i needed a strategy 
it was simple 
if i left my money at home 
i d leave temptation with it 
my strategy suffered a setback
when i ran into mrs  steuby 
julianna 
julianna 
hello  dear 
i m so sorry it s taken me so long
to get this to you   
   but i keep missing you in the morning 
mrs  steuby  i don t want that 
you don t have to   
don t be ridiculous  i m gonna pay you 
  i m going to pay you 
  i don t want that  i don t want it 
yeah  i want you to go out
and buy yourself something festive 
pedal pushers  ha  ha 
  mrs  steuby 
  bye  dear 
  mrs  steuby  i don t want pedal pushers 
  no  no  you ll look great 
it s okay 
it s okay  no big deal 
just pretend like i don t have it 
i hear you re planning to bid on bryce 
what  who told you that  no  i m not 
someone saw you with a wad of cash
this morning 
  how much do you have 
  it s none of your business 
and i m not bidding  okay 
i don t even like him anymore 
oh  that ll be the day 
it s true  go ahead 
waste your money on him  i don t care 
and now  will you all give
a big mayfield school welcome   
   to your 1963 basketboys 
i could say i didn t care all i wanted   
   but seeing bryce walk out
in his jacket and tie   
   holding that picnic basket   
   set my head spinning again 
fifteen going once 
  the auction seemed to fly by 
  fifteen going twice 
sold to macy taylor for  15 
before i knew it 
eddie trulock was called 
number eight is eddie trulock 
which meant bryce was next 
eddie is a member of the debate team 
and his hobbies include fishing   
   and model airplane building 
who will give me  5 
  why isn t anyone bidding  he s so nice 
  exactly 
nobody 
eight dollars 
sold to juli baker for  8 
how did this happen 
was it because i felt bad for eddie 
or was it because i couldn t trust myself
with bryce 
as i made my way
to the multi purpose room   
   i contemplated
the startling turn of events 
here i was  about to have lunch
with eddie trulock   
   while the boy i mooned over
for half my life   
   was going to share a meal
with my mortal enemy 
i wanna thank you for bidding on me 
it was touch and go there for a while 
no  i wanted to  this will be fun 
  i hear you like building model airplanes 
  yeah 
my father and i just finished
a russian mig 19  it was made in 1955 
mig s first supersonic fighter 
tricky because the cockpit was recessed   
i tried to give eddie my full attention 
but it was difficult 
because bryce was right behind him 
eddie was saying something
about intake valves   
   when out of nowhere  bryce stood up
and marched straight towards me 
hey  juli  i gotta talk to you 
what are you doing 
he was going to kiss me  to kiss me 
all my life i ve been waiting for that kiss 
but not like this  not this way 
i pedaled home so hard 
i thought my lungs would burst 
julianna 
julianna 
honey 
what s wrong 
i can t 
sweetheart   
   you can tell me 
bryce tried to kiss me 
he did 
in school 
in front of everybody 
mom  please don t get it 
it s probably him 
sweetheart   
   maybe you should talk to him 
i can t 
i can t 
bryce wouldn t leave me alone 
he kept calling on the phone 
and knocking on the door 
he even snuck around the house
and tapped on my window 
juli  please  i gotta see you 
come on out  just for a minute 
why didn t he understand
that i just wanted to be left alone 
please 
after two days  bryce stopped 
and i thought it was finally over 
then  one afternoon 
i was coming into the front room to read   
   when i heard a noise in the yard 
hey  what s he doing 
juli  calm down  i gave him permission 
permission  permission for what 
he s digging a hole 
i told him he could 
but why 
i told him he could 
it was torture seeing him
dig up my grass 
how could my father let him do this 
bryce knew i was there too 
he s gone 
a tree 
he s planting a tree 
is it a 
i didn t really need to ask 
i could tell
from the shape of the leaves   
   and the texture of the trunk 
it was a sycamore tree 
when she walked out of the door 
i thought back to the first time i saw her 
how could anybody  ever 
have wanted to run away from juli baker 
he looked at me with those eyes 
those once again dazzling eyes 
and i knew that bryce loski
was still walking around with my first kiss 
but he wouldn t be for long 
as we stood there 
i realized that all these years   
   we never really talked 
do you need some help 
yeah 
but that day  we started 
and i knew we d be talking for a long time 
let s do it from the beginning again 
you ready  and action 
juli  can we talk 
  what s going on 
  and   
oh  god 
oh  god  here we go 
the scene where we re doing
the basketboy thing   
   where we almost kiss 
that one was so hard 
bryce  what are you doing 
mm   
stop it  ha  ha 
and then i leave  ha  ha 
god 
you gotta be serious about this 
you can t be giggling during this 
  okay  okay 
  sorry 
can t be giggleville 
let s do it again  no giggling 
it s supposed to be we re talking   
   and he comes up and tries to kiss me 
it was really hard  i had to wait
until he got there and then i m like 
oh  it was so embarrassing 
and action 
juli  i gotta talk to you 
we don t actually kiss 
it s a near kiss 
i try to kiss her and then she runs out 
i was kind of confused when i read that 
because she wanted the kiss
the entire time  then when i try she runs 
he gets up and  like  walks towards me   
   and says   can i talk to you  
and he grabs me and he goes like 
and then i have to run away 
but we kept laughing 
i tripped on the cloth 
it was so funny  oh  my gosh 
it was so hard to keep a straight face 
it was so embarrassing 
just turn around 
that was so weird 
i thought the sniffing hair was weird 
when i had to sniff his hair in one scene   
   but that was really weird 
that was really fun to film
but it was really awkward as well 
then madeline was trying to not laugh 
  why are you smiling 
  cut 
  what are you doing 
  i m sorry  ha  ha 
it was so hard not to laugh 
i had to have callan    he was off camera 
i m like   turn around  
what are you doing 
stop 
  ha  ha 
  and cut 
one of the kids 
who played eddie trulock   
   who ended up being chosen by juli
at the basketboy thing   
   he told madeline and i that my look
when i was trying to kiss her was like 
show him your face 
you see    coming towards you
and you re supposed to be serious 
okay  picture s up 
i had to run out after and i d
stay there for a bit after she d run away 
and we had all the really nice
extra kids over there   
   and they were saying  like

bryce  you didn t even make it
to first base

  hello  lover boy

like   try it like that  
because he s in the other room 
i was like   we re not gonna kiss  right
