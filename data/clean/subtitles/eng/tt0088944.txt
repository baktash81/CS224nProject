wheres jenny
do you remember me colonel
i remember you scumbag especially
the people youve tortured and killed
colonel matrix
you do not understand
a country like val verde
it is a country that needs a president
who has an understanding of discipline
why tell me
because youre going to return
to val verde
and you are going to kill the president
that you helped to overthrow me
why dont you have bennett do it
sounds like something he would get off on
because president velásquez
trusts you colonel
after all he made you
the hero of the revolution
while captain bennett left
shall we say under a cloud
yeah cause he enjoyed killing
a little too much
your training matrix
you can get close to president velásquez
you will kill him you know colonel
we went to a lot of trouble to find you
we had to pretend captain bennetts death
so that general kirby would lead us to you
and now that i have you
you will do exactly as i tell you
fuck you
daddy
jenny
oh you bastards
colonel matrix if you kill president
velásquez i will send her back to you
if you try anything else
i will mail her to you in pieces
