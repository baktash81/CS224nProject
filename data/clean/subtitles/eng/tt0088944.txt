forrestal  bennett    they ve all been hit 
  who is doing it 
  you ve made enemies all over the world 
it could have been the syrians 
the south americans 
the russians  or a terrorist group 
they re gonna find you 
  we were going to make a normal life here

  payday 
   grunts 
tranquillizers 
  i wanted to use the real thing 
  where s jenny 
do you remember me  colonel 
i remember you  scumbag  especially
the people you ve tortured and killed 
colonel matrix 
you do not understand
a country like val verde 
it is a country that needs a president
who has an understanding of discipline 
  why tell me 
  because you re going to return
to val verde 
and you are going to kill the president
that you helped to overthrow me 
why don t you have bennett do it 
sounds like something he would get off on 
because president velásquez
trusts you  colonel 
after all  he made you
the hero of the revolution 
while captain bennett left 
shall we say  under a cloud 
yeah   cause he enjoyed killing
a little too much 
your training  matrix 
you can get close to president velásquez 
you will kill him  you know  colonel 
we went to a lot of trouble to find you 
we had to pretend captain bennett s death 
so that general kirby would lead us to you 
and now that i have you 
you will do exactly as i tell you 
fuck you 
  daddy 
  jenny 
oh  you bastards 
colonel matrix  if you kill president
velásquez  i will send her back to you 
if you try anything else 
i will mail her to you in pieces 
  any sign of matrix 
  no  sir  just those bodies 
  you think there s more  sir 
  if he s still alive  i d expect a lot more 
sully ll make sure you get on the plane 
henriques ll stay with you 
make sure you get off 
i don t hear from either one of  em 
she s dead 
  how much are they paying you  bennett 
  they offered me a hundred grand 
wanna know something

i said i d do it for nothing 
  hold it 
  i ll be back  bennett 
john 
i ll be ready  john
