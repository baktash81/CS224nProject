i    don t know 
do you want me to spend the night
somewhere else 
in a hotel or something 
do you want us to meet later on 
we can talk more calmly  do you   
do you need more time 
what     what do you need 
what has happened 
bob knows that you are coming back today 
well  i can   
i can pick him up after school
and take him   
to the zoo or something 
 bob imitates siren 
come and admire him 
bob  nee na  nee na  nee na 
nee na  nee na 
anna  maybe all couples go through this 
yeah 
one mustn t be afraid 
no 
one must speak honestly 
is that difficult 
is it difficult 
i haven t been much help but
i ve finished that job now   it s over 
maybe i was asking for too much 
i was the one who had the right to ask 
i know 
no  you don t 
who was i doing it for  after all 
were you unfaithful to me 
the truth is not really 
were you 
no 
there s always someone else
when these things happen 
not in this case 
all right  well   
what s happening to us is just   
it s just natural  feelings   
change 
but without you i wouldn t feel
anything at all 
what do you feel now 
are you really interested 
no 
there you are  you see 
it s the same with me 
i don t even want you now 
  what time did you meet him 
  8 30 
  where 
  in the park 
  was he willing 
  yes  verbally 
did you sense or detect weariness in him 
no  a correct appraisal of the realities 
  is it making him bitter 
  no  greedy 
but you felt his power 
you mean did i feel fear 
no because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions 
  how many vials did he take with him 
  two
what procedure have you devised for
contacting him again 
it s all in my report 
i suggest it s more economical
to fill in my successor 
we don t feel there is a need
for a successor 
i ve completed my job 
brilliantly  that s why
we want to rehire you 
it s out of the question 
and what would be the reason
for your refusal 
family 
  couldn t we be of some help there 
  no 
wouldn t it be advisable for you
to reconsider 
i m unable to do that 
would you be unable for a long time 
i hope not 
aren t you allowing feelings to prevent
you from answering your own questions 
exactly why i advise you
to hire my successor 
good 
any questions 
no 
does our subject still wear pink socks 
anna 
 phone rings 
it s me 
it s anna 
i am downtown 
why downtown  i ve been waiting all day 
i need some time to think 
what do you mean  to think  
think about what 
to think about me 
wh    wh    where are you 
  when will you    
   phone cuts off 
 ring tone 
  hello 
  margie  this is mark 
now  i know there s no sympathy
between us and it s   
hard for me to ask you for help but   
you re her only friend 
now  just tell me the truth 
she has somebody 
she wished you d say or do something 
something to reinstall you 
you know  a magic wave of the wand 
you arrived sooner than expected  mark 
yes  sure  this is all my fault 
now  how long has this been going on 
quite long 
who is he 
oh  mark  i don t   
your wife keeps her own secrets 
margie   
i don t have a magic wand 
i don t intend to hang on 
but make her talk to me 
it ll be the way that she wants 
but this is not   
proper 
  please 
   phone cut off 
 continuous tone 
 phone rings 
yes 
we re over  mark 
you have someone 
yes 
  for a long time 
  does it matter 
yes 
yes 
do you   
sleep with him 
yes 
  do you like it 
  yes 
more than with me 
yes 
i see 
how do you intend to live now 
  we have to discuss it 
  now 
as you want 
half an hour at the cafe einstein 
i m too far for half an hour 
are you calling from there 
yes 
is he listening 
no 
but he is there 
yes 
would 800 a month for bob be enough 
i suppose 
will you move in with him or
keep the apartment 
i ll keep it if you allow me to 
i ve decided not to see bob 
  at all 
  at all 
how can you say that 
he s going to be fucked up
enough as it is 
i don t want to fuck him up even more
by playing sunday daddy 
  what were you to him anyway 
  precisely 
but   
he knows you  he s yours  he needs   
a real father full time 
well  i thought i could be 
coming home from the war  so to speak 
you say it s better with him than with me 
i get bored of it 
tell me 
i think what you want to do to bob is   
inhuman  so what you re doing
must be human 
  how long is it going to last 
  i don t know 
one week  two weeks 
and how do you dispose of ideas
like honesty and loyalty 
if i could only believe that it happened
cleanly at first sight 
ok  if it makes things easier 
i was in his bed the first night
i met him  if you have to know 
what do you expect of me 
look what you re doing 
no one is good or bad
but if you want  i am the bad one
and if i knew he existed in this world 
i would have never had bob with you 
get out 
get out  get out 
 screaming 
 ringing tone 
 woman speaks faintly 
  erm   
  hallo 
mm   
hallo  hallo 
ma  ma  ma 
 thunder and rain 
 panting 
how    how long have i    
how long have i been here 
three weeks  sir 
what happened  it s daddy 
mummy said she would be right back
but she never came 
then margie called and told me to be brave
because she had broke her leg and
she had to have the cast put on 
you ve been alone for a long time 
look  i got a new boat 
did you get it from mummy 
no  from uncle heinrich 
long ago 
yes 
yesterday 
no  before you were coming back
from far away 
ok  little piggy 
come on  let s get out of this mess 
how did you make such a mess 
 key in lock 
this is not always like this  mark 
usually i m on time 
i m not interested 
i came to tell you that
i can t live without you
and i m ready to understand
whatever there is
but it doesn t look like
it makes much sense 
  you can t take bob away from me 
  i m not trying 
you can continue to visit whenever
you want  but i m taking over here 
anna  is there anything i can do 
  you could just   
  yes 
  i must   
  yes 
i must   
you must restore order 
you must leave him 
you will call him 
you will say it is over 
now  i don t care if you tell him
you love him
but he s not your family  
your family is here 
you must call him now 
  but i can t on the phone 
  i don t trust you 
  i have to tell him face to face 
  i don t trust you 
on the phone 
oh jesus 
jesus  jesus  jesus 
jesus  jesus  jesus 
jesus 
if you want to stay  make that call 
it s still quite warm  i don t think
you ll need a winter coat or sweater 
i can t stand to see you like this 
it could be the way you want 
just don t cry any more 
i am very sleepy 
 phone rings 
anna is with me and she ll stay with me 
he phoned me 
he said she won t be coming back 
i have to talk to her right now 
please give me that number 
542 6261  
where is it 
i don t know  mark 
542 6261 
 punches numbers 
 ringing tone 
  hello 
  yes 
i want to speak to heinrich 
my son is not in town  who is calling 
anna s husband 
anna s not here 
i haven t seen her for weeks 
i miss her so much 
hallo  hallo 
  hallo 
   slams phone down 
 whispers  542 6261
what happened 
wee wee 
shall i take you 
where s mummy 
she went to see margie 
are you going too 
i m staying with you 
hello  i m bob s father  i ll be bringing
him to school from now on 
i m glad  you re the father who went
far away and met the polar bears 
hello 
what is this  a joke 
what are you talking about 
  i mean your wig 
  what 
i m so sorry  it s impossible 
have you ever seen my wife 
naturally  every day of the school year 
you re heinrich 
yes 
i ve come for anna 
anna s not here 
you want me to break down
the bloody door 
you don t have to  it s open 
we don t have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite 
our situation is like a mountain lake
we are trying to swim in 
starting from different shores 
i am not astonished you are here 
i was thinking about you
just before you came
so now that you re here 
let s be open to each other 
you can hate me as much as you like 
but it s you who wants
to know things from me 
so please make it possible 
i am suffering as much as you are 
the fact that anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone
but i always accept anna s ways 
as i think no one has a right
to impose his will on anyone 
so that s how you ve changed her so much 
possibly  but is it changing her
or making her open to herself 
so open she s inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her 
what are you talking about 
we spoke on the phone last night 
you and i  didn t we 
stop it  i just arrived from hamburg 
you weren t listening to me 
i was just trying to make her comprehend
that i love her 
i left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself 
i allowed you your chance 
bullshit 
i m not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way  it s offensive 
how long have you been fucking me over 
a year 
all my visits home  all that time 
yes 
and this is what you mean by
accepting anna s ways 
precisely 
the key being the infinitive 
to accept 
i have been honest with you 
would you permit me to enquire
on a specific point 
on your last visit home 
were you content with your wife 
i mean sexually 
why 
because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony 
er   
my mother 
  is she here all the time 
  yes 
  even when you re fucking anna 
  of course 
agh 
why 
why 
agh 
 groans 
 groans again 
bob     eating green bananas 
where d you think he put the skins 
down his new pyjamas 
 anna laughs 
yes  yes 
baa baa black sheep  have you any wool 
yes sir  yes sir  three bags full 
one for    the master  one for the dame
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane 
  can i go out into the back yard 
  yes  you may 
but you take your sandwich with you 
where were you 
i wrote you  i was at margie s 
that s not true  i spoke to her

  but he s not lying 
  i was   
  i was with friends 
  who 
  new friends 
  i ll check 
yes  check  check  check  check  check 
why did you leave last night 
to be alone 
but you said you went to friends 
why are you nagging me 
can t you just leave me in peace 
i could have perfect peace
if you never came back 
it s bob  i have bob  he is my son too 
don t try to tell me you care about him
all that much 
he didn t stop you from breaking us up 
if you really thought about him  you d
give a thought to us  for christ s sake 
i do  i do 
no you don t  you think about buying him
a pair of shoes 
about making him a snack 
about telling him a bedtime story
but if you really thought about him 
you d think about us 
right  right  why are you always right 
but it s difficult  don t you understand 
it s difficult  i didn t want it to happen
but it happened and now   
don t come any closer 
anna  it s me 
don t you understand  you disgust me 
i can t stand you touching me 
you make me   
you know  love isn t something you can
just switch from channel to channel 
i have your letters 
 my love  trust me   you write
and all the time you were
fucking your arse off 
  you want me to believe you re a   
  a whore  yes 
a monster  a whore 
i fuck around with everybody 
whenever you turn around i fuck around
with everybody on every corner 
you will let me go 
please don t make me force you 
you can t stop me 
i ll open the window and jump 
you need him that much 
oh yes  oh yes 
fuck your needs 
do it again 
agh 
 she screams

you know what this is for 
the lies 
then you ll have to add much more 
bitch

 door slams 
 footsteps echo

  what s going to happen to us 
  it s up to you 
  then stop coming

 children shouting

extinct hearth  limping to the rescue 
and nothing can stop me

and make a fool of yourself
and i m here to help you

i would like you to follow my   
   wife for a few days 
of course  wives  wives  wives  wives 
are there any reasons you would like
to give us 
you don t have to answer but often it is
enormously helpful in an investigation 
my wife doesn t live with me any more
but she visits   or at least she has been
visiting up to now   my son 
i see 
i have a photo of my wife here 
are there any other leads 
mmm

or a woman possessed
and then i see you again and

 church bells ringing

sebastianstrasse 87  1st floor 
she seems to be alone 
do you want me to check this now 
danke 
 thanks  
sorry to bother you  miss 
i m from the building manager s office 
we had a complaint about
some broken windows somewhere
and the glass falling
down on the sidewalk 
  is that what it is 
  i m afraid i have to check your windows 
  but i can assure you they re all right 
  how can you be so sure 
i just    i just saw you come in 
it ll only take a moment 
but i don t want you to be here 
i quite understand  miss 
but it s me or the police 
a lady got hurt on the sidewalk 
a turkish woman 
you might say she shouldn t be here in the
first place but she lodged a complaint 
so what can i do about it 
nothing 
please 
is it ok 
moment 
so 
excuse me  the bathroom 
the bathroom doesn t have a window 
are you sure 
absolutely 
some bathrooms have windows
this side of the house 
not in this one 
i m afraid i still have to check it
before someone else gets   
would you care for a glass of wine 
  wine 
  yes 
i m afraid i   
yes  wine 
  i m afraid you   
  oh  come on  don t be so formal 
miss  it doesn t make any sense 
i ve got k k kids 
i only came for the windows 
i m sorry  miss  but   
i still have to have a look 
oh  it broke 
 squelching and dripping 
was ist    
 what s     
 she screams 
 she screams again 
how long 
ah    ages and ages 
  much longer than i could 
   door buzzer 
bob  nee na  nee na  nee na 
hello  i m sorry to bother you so late 
may i see your wife 
no  she went out 
bob  nee na  nee na  nee na 
that s not entirely true  she   
she doesn t live with us any longer 
oh 
it s about bob 
ah  bob 
bob is fine 
he s just beaten the world record
in tub diving 
oh   she laughs 
  hello  bob 
  come on  cut it out  bob 
 door buzzer 
 buzzing continues 
look  um   
  would you be so kind 
   buzzer continues 
he s actually been in the bath
for about an hour 
yes  of course 
i ve called many times 
i wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts
in this fundamentally vulgar structure 
the triangle 
in other words  where is she 
i ve been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects
of your anger and your defence 
is anna with you 
and if 
i would only ask to have a talk with her 
what if i said no 
i m sorry i used violence with you 
now i d only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me 
oh  i m so sorry  she s not here 
did i tell you i had a wife
and a daughter 
no 
they live in cincinnati 
what does that do for you 
they will always remain my first family 
anna could be the second
and you and bob in some sense 
do you have a dog 
would that i had 
you misuse me 
it s stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp 
who are the crusaders of every
blind principle  so called ideology
humanity invents to strangle me 
why don t you like me 
why don t you draw in
the plentitude of my love
and pull it all over your life
like a veil 
ok  i like you 
and i can tell you where anna lives 
lives 
only    i don t know the guy s name 
it s impossible  it doesn t make sense 
why not 
because you think you ve given her
the supreme pleasure 
you with your yin yang balls
dangling from your zen brain 
ok  maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest  in which case   
i m sure you win hands down 
  but is that all 
  bob  nee na  nee na 
nee na  nee na  nee na 
 bob continues 
i used to be afraid of you 
but i don t think i am any more 
there s nothing to fear except god 
whatever that means to you 
for me god is a disease 
that s why through the disease
we can reach god 
 tracking something   said winnie the pooh
very mysteriously 
 tracking what   said piglet 
coming closer 
 that s just what i ask myself 
i ask myself  what  
 what do you think you ll answer  
he wants to say good night to you 
thank you 
you smell clean 
do you like helen 
i think so 
are you not sure 
well  i don t know her yet 
do you like her 
yes  and who don t you like 
well  i don t like heinrich
and i don t like that sailboat 
why  he s funny 
i don t like   
i don t like mummy to like him
more than us 
who s prettier  mummy or helen 
who do you think is prettier 
you tell me 
our mummy 
good night  son 
thank you 
do you have anyone to help you with him 
oh it s    it s not a problem  i   
i have plenty of time 
bob won t say anything to me 
he keeps his words for himself 
he knows everything  senses everything 
children are amazing 
yeah 
after lunch we have an hour s rest 
bob very often goes to sleep 
when he does he cries or shouts 
does he do it at home 
no 
oh 
he screams 
it is very difficult to calm him down 
when he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened 
what can i say 
i m at war against women 
they    have no foresight 
there s nothing about them that is stable 
there s nothing to trust 
they re dangerous 
there is nothing in common among women
except menstruation 
excuse me 
i come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint
because you can see it in the flesh 
it becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it 
which doesn t mean i admire your world 
but i find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe 
i m   
i m one of the contaminated 
because you never feel free  do you 
so sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil 
and what about lack of freedom 
it s extraordinary 
all right 
together we can listen if bob cries out 
you don t have to make love to me 
i m not trying 
 bob screaming 
what happened 
i want mummy  my mummy 
  mummy  my mummy  mummy  mummy 
  it s ok  it s all right 
  it s ok  it s all right 
  mummy  mummy  mummy 
  it s all right  it s all right 
  mummy  mummy  mummy 
 bob whimpers 
 whispers  it s all right  it s all right 
it s all right 
it s all right  sh 
i m sorry 
it wasn t very wise of me 
this makes you think
you ve been right all along 
hello  bob 
children  i m the big boss here 
you re the little boss 
good morning  i phoned you at home
then i thought i might catch you here 
i didn t tell you where
bob goes to school 
it wasn t difficult 
we have a minor problem here 
yes 
the detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didn t come home last night 
so 
he wasn t at home this morning and
he hasn t reported to the office 
before we start to get worried   
when was he going to check it 
yesterday or today 
i don t know 
please don t misunderstand me 
that detective could ve gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores 
although that s not much likely 
he could have died of a heart attack
if our detective doesn t show up
by noon i ll have to notify the police 
the police will start digging into your
problem  that s how it is 
you and i can claim professional secrecy
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you 
sebastianstrasse 87  floor 1 
have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned 
  no 
  very sensible of you 
but may i ask why not 
i had the impression that you were
tremendously interested
in finding your wife 
yes  i was 
i suppose i still am 
but that was out of pure  blind ambition 
and you know something 
i don t feel like there s anything
much ambitious left in me 
i see 
so i don t even have to ask you
as a personal favour
not to come to the office
until i contact you 
why 
precisely because of the   
delicacy of your feelings 
you might be able to understand that   
my interest in the case comes
from the fact that i   
live with that detective 
i ll be calling 
 sound of scrubbing 
i have to talk to you 
that s what i guessed 
have you ever seen this man 
do i have to answer you 
well  you have to answer
to someone eventually 
that s too easy 
but it s you    or the police  right 
right 
why 
you re scaring me 
am i not scared 
oh yes 
i see 
darkness is easeful 
and the temptation to let go   
   promises so much comfort
after the pain 
he s in there 
 squelching and dripping 
 squelching and deep breathing 
mein gott 
 my god  
he is very tired 
he made love to me all night

he is still unfinished  you know

because you say  i  for me 
because you say  i  for me 
 projector whirrs 
 chair creaks 
yes  i m thinking about him 
but i recognise the self who has just done
something horrible
like the sister i ve casually met
on the street   hello  sister  
it s like those two sisters of
faith and chance 
it s like those two sisters of
faith and chance 
well  faith can t exclude chance
but chance   
oh sh    
well  it s like those two sisters of
faith and chance 
my faith can t exclude chance
but my chance can explain faith 
my faith didn t allow me
to wait for chance
and chance didn t give me
enough faith 
well   
and then i read that private life
is a stage 
only i m playing in many parts that are
smaller than me and yet i still play them 
i suffer  i believe  i am   
but at the same time i know there s
a third possibility  you know 
like cancer or madness  but cancer
and madness contort reality 
the possibility i m talking about
pierces reality 
well  i m unable to say it  maybe 
maybe it s impossible to say 
maybe i m too stupid 
you re looking at me as if you   
you re looking at me as if to tell me
that i need you to fill me up 
as if i m an empty space 
well  i love you too but what makes me
go on is to know he ll return
and that i ll make him suffer
and i ll hurt him and i m betraying him 
but    this brings me small rewards 
yet i can t exist by myself
because i m afraid of myself 
because i m the maker of my own evil 
because   
because i m   
goodness is only some kind of
reflection upon evil 
that s the way it is 
ah   she sighs 
what are you doing 
i m sorting out his things
to take to the laundry 
i could do it myself 
but it s my job 
  i m very good at it 
  very kind of you  but   
maybe you could do it when bob is at home 
it s getting    so difficult for you 
isn t it 
you re not as   
you re not as strong or as sure of
yourself as you thought you were
so you keep coming back 
you must be    you must be   
   torn apart 
i can    i can think more clearly now 
i guess   
i guess when you re there   
   you want to be home 
and when you re home   
   you want to be there 
if what you have there is
so strong for you 
if it s what you never had   
stick to it  keep it 
 she cries out 
it s very quiet here when you re out 
it was very quiet when you weren t here 
come over here  let s just see if we can
sit together peacefully still 
 cries getting louder 
is it the same there 
 screams  no 
can you tell me now 
i messed everything up 
even bob 
i ve been a cheat  a liar 
completely alone  wounded 
and you think i m immoral shit 
i think so too but not for
the same reasons 
 screams  i feel nothing for no one 
it s as if the two sisters were
too exhausted to fight any more 
you know these women wrestling
in an arena of mud
with their hands locked
at each other s throats
each waiting to see who will die first 
and both staring at me 
 she whimpers 
 she whimpers 
 she whimpers 
 she whimpers 
 whimper echoes 
 whimper echoes 
 whimpering gets louder 
 she cries 
 she cries again 
 she cries again 
 church bells ringing 
 laughs hysterically 
 laughter becomes screaming 
 loud panting 
 panting becomes screaming 
 she screams 
 she screams 
what i miscarried there was sister faith 
and what was left is sister chance 
so i had to take care of my faith
to protect it 
and that s what you re doing there 
yes 
you look uglier 
you ve hardened 
for the first time  you look   
   vulgar to me 
you know  i remember when i was a kid 
have you ever seen a dying dog 
you know  one of those old dogs
that comes to die under the   
under the porch of the house 
at the last moment 
it    yelps   
   in terror
as if it s seen something real 
i want you to take off the ring
and the wristwatch i gave you
last time i came home 
don t forget to give him his yoghurt 
no 
i have to go 
if i threw myself at your feet and yelped 
would you still walk over me 
yes 
hello  this is anna s husband speaking 
heinrich s mother  anna s not here 
i don t have the slightest idea
what s happening to her 
  do you love your son 
  sir 
tell him that i love him too 
i love everybody and everything 
i accept everything  i have become wise
and profound and good 
do you want to talk to him 
we are just having coffee 
no  i don t want to talk to him  i   
i don t want your coffee to get cold 
either  i certainly love your coffee 
just tell heinrich that anna s address is
sebastianstrasse 87  first floor 
five  six  seven  sky 
eight  seven  six  five  four  three   
madam teacher  my apologies
for being late 
no  it s all right 
anyway  we were waiting for you 
thank you  and goodbye  bob 
what is it 
my name 
 panting 
i respected your wish to be alone 
i thought you needed the time 
but now it s time enough 
besides  what are you doing here anyway 
don t resist me 
you know i m stronger than you 
i m the only one in your life
who has rights on you
because i don t claim any 
i brought it from india 
you know  this is what the french poet
michaux was writing about 
i kept it for you 
with this  love opens to absolutely
unknown horizons 
absolutely unknown 
anna 
we are made to swim in the centre
of the stream 
not to wait on the dry banks 
yes 
exactly 
i showed you the door to god   
   and this door is always open 
come 
 dripping 
this is a joke 
 heavy breathing 
what is it 
anna 
anna 
these must be removed 
they are beginning to smell 
this can t be true 
i ve got to keep this place
clean and well 
oh my god 
are you going to help me 
heinrich 
you are no different from anyone else 
we are all the same
but in different words 
with different bodies 
different versions 
like insects 
meat 
 he gasps 
anna 
 phone rings 
 imitates engine 
 imitates aeroplane 
calling all ambulances and fire engines
to the scene of the crash 
and two trucks 
 bob imitates siren 
where 
 doorbell buzzes 
can you answer the door  bob 
now  listen  heinrich 
just stay where you are 
i paid a fortune for the cab 
at the bar at the corner 
bleed for a while 
i ll be there as soon as i can 
my son took the car  an automatic one 
  can you look after bob till i get back 
  what is it 
it s mummy calling me 
 fly buzzing 
 fly buzzing 
 nervous laughter 
 gasping 
 he screams 
 hissing 
 fly buzzing 
 mark humming 
 arcade machine plays tune 
no  not out here 
go to the toilet 
need a tampax 
how can you joke while i m so hurt 
there are corpses in there 
at least two bodies 
i thought she was pulling my leg 
but no  there s blood 
she cuts them 
a monster  a joke  but it was alive 
you re drunk  heinrich 
she cuts us to pieces  mark 
maybe she just didn t want to see you 
don t joke  i m not joking 
oh yes  you re not joking 
so what do you want 
don t you understand 
she s killing people 
i understand she s killing people  so why
do you call me and not the police 
she is sick  mark  doesn t that
mean anything to you 
there are dead bodies there 
i don t believe you 
maybe you re stoned on
some shit you suck on 
some mushroom you gobble 
perhaps you did it to yourself 
maybe you re learning how to suffer 
now  that would be an achievement 
  i feel for people 
  you talk for people 
  you take their wives 
   shouts  i take what i want 
and i m at peace with myself 
nobody saw me come in  nobody 
i called you because we have to do
something to help her 
why 
it isn t normal  it wasn t even human 
it was   
divine 
perhaps you met god a moment ago
and you didn t even realise it 
now  you believe in god  don t you 
certainly 
in that great incomprehensible god whom
you reached through fucking  or dope 
am i right 
look  mark  that woman is crazy 
we have to do something 
we 
i m not going to do anything 
i can t leave it this way  it s anna 
it s murder 
you re not a man  mark  you re a woman 
all right  if you don t intend to do
anything and want to keep me silent 
you will have to pay 
you have money  i know it 
you have to get me out of here  and send
me on a long trip to restore my harmony 
i deserve it 
if you had only seen what i saw 
 he retches 
heinrich  help me out of here  i m sick 
i m the one who is wounded   not you 
please 
 toilet flushes 
   coughing 
   gas hissing 
 woman laughs 
god s light avenge them 
giving it out clean and
getting it back dirty 
 she gurgles 
 whispers  do you believe in god 
 sobs  in god 
it s in me 
take me 
take me 
  did margie see it 
  yes 
  that s why you killed her 
  she tried to take it away from me 
  is this faith that helpless 
  it needs to be protected 
  like a child 
  yes 
you know  for me  god is still under
the porch  where the dog died 
and on the branch of the eucalyptus tree 
where i d lie for hours 
and watch how the clouds change
the colour of the grass below 
i need money 
i had to leave there 
oh  i ve cleaned all the mess 
i washed the floor  i made the bed 
i didn t know where to go 
it became so unsafe there 
people can t stop trying to
take it away from me 
ok 
now leave me the car 
take margie s keys and go to her place
and wait there 
can you drive a motorbike 
heinrich taught me 
it s outside 
now  i ll take care of bob and everything 
i ll go to the bank on monday
and take the money out 
if bob wakes up  tell him   
i will 
it s only me  go to sleep 
i have to go 
please close the door 
  because it s here with you 
  yes 
 dogs barking 
 phone rings 
  i m sorry to disturb you  but   
  yes 
you understand that it is very late 
and heinrich hasn t called me yet 
he calls me every night so i won t worry
about when he comes home 
maybe    maybe he just forgot your number 
no  you don t understand  mothers always
feel it when their sons are in trouble 
are you worried    
are you worried that he s not there
having sex with my wife 
they should come here 
i ve put clean sheets on the bed
and they could have dinner 
are you quite sure you know
who you are talking to 
i am 
  i went there 
  where 
i was worried  you understand 
there isn t any apartment there
under the address you gave me 
there s only a smoking hole that the
police won t allow anybody to come near 
so i went to a bar at the corner
to call home  to find out   
if heimlich had returned 
yes 
and heinrich was there 
nobody could identify him 
yes 
i recognised his body  of course 
did you identify him for the police 
no  it was only heinrich s body 
but his soul was not there 
perhaps he and his soul had
parted company before 
you don t know what you re talking about 
no  you re quite right  i don t have
any idea what i m talking about 
he must have seemed to you better
and more beautiful than you 
when anna met him  she immediately
worshipped his soul 
and you sent him there 
now  listen to me 
i recognise heinrich s superiority
in every way 
i was proud that anna accepted him 
now anna has gone missing
and i m here 
all alone  you understand 
with our little son 
now  i must find her  
maybe it s her fault 
i ll find her  and i ll force her to tell
me what she s done with heinrich s soul 
and then i ll come to you and tell you 
won t you come up 
i m in a rush 
is it your wife 
here 
will you promise me something 
yes 
whatever it is 
i promise 
 moaning 
 moaning gets louder 
 she cries out 
almost 
almost 
almost 
almost 
almost 
  almost 
  yes 
almost 
almost 
heinrich s dead 
isn t he 
yes 
have you found anna 
yes 
you come like the angel of death 
the one who kills 
i have thought about killing her 
and now 
now i don t know 
did you see anything that
made you change your mind 
i don t know what i saw
but heinrich saw it too 
and you came to tell me that you don t
know where heinrich s soul is 
yes 
i can see it in your face 
it would be good to think that the soul
lives separately from the body 
that the soul lives for ever
and the body only for a time 
but it isn t so 
i don t know any more 
i do 
i have to be    on my son s side 
even if he has made you unhappy 
i know all there is to know about him 
that i love him 
yes 
i was wondering which is worse 
take away someone s wife 
hurt a child   
   or to kill 
he also had a wife and a child 
i used to like her 
i liked your anna too 
i had to like both of them   
   since they loved him 
the world is only what it is 
murderous 
if we are the best of it 
you don t have to worry about me 
i don t want to be here   
   if heinrich is not around any more 
 window creaks 
that dog didn t die of old age 
what about you  mark 
our man won t confide or deal with
your successor  he wants you 
in fact  mark  there is no successor 
we can take care of drowning dogs 
but please help us take care of
the drowning world 
don t you think it s uneconomical
to waste yourself on dogs 
even dogs you love 
i met a man who loved everything 
and he died in a flood of shit 
we know  that s just details 
when i was a boy   
i had a dog and his name was louis 
when he crawled under the porch to die 
i stayed there with him 
so what 
i wanted to see what it was
that made him crawl under there 
nobody s a boy any more 
must we prove it 
this is the address 
back up  then full speed 
and crash into the police car 
my pleasure  sir 
out of the car 
out of the car 
 he yells 
 gasping 
 church bells ringing 
 car engine 
   door slams 
   footsteps 
anna 
run away  go  go 
how could you find me 
how could i not 
i wanted to show it to you 
it is finished now 
oh yes 
so hard to live with it  eh  brother 
is there a way out 
will you help me 
yes

 voices from below

 doorbell rings
