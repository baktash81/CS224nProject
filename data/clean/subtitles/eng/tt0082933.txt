i dont know
do you want me to spend the night
somewhere else
in a hotel or something
do you want us to meet later on
we can talk more calmly do you
do you need more time
what what do you need
what has happened
bob knows that you are coming back today
well i can
i can pick him up after school
and take him
to the zoo or something
bob imitates siren
come and admire him
bob neena neena neena
neena neena
anna maybe all couples go through this
yeah
one mustnt be afraid
no
one must speak honestly
is that difficult
is it difficult
i havent been much help but
ive finished that job now  its over
maybe i was asking for too much
i was the one who had the right to ask
i know
no you dont
who was i doing it for after all
were you unfaithful to me
the truth is not really
were you
no
theres always someone else
when these things happen
not in this case
all right well
whats happening to us is just
its just natural feelings
change
but without you i wouldnt feel
anything at all
what do you feel now
are you really interested
no
there you are you see
its the same with me
i dont even want you now
what time did you meet him
830
where
in the park
was he willing
yes verbally
did you sense or detect weariness in him
no a correct appraisal of the realities
is it making him bitter
no greedy
but you felt his power
you mean did i feel fear
no because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions
how many vials did he take with him
two
what procedure have you devised for
contacting him again
its all in my report
i suggest its more economical
to fill in my successor
we dont feel there is a need
for a successor
ive completed my job
brilliantly thats why
we want to rehire you
its out of the question
and what would be the reason
for your refusal
family
couldnt we be of some help there
no
wouldnt it be advisable for you
to reconsider
im unable to do that
would you be unable for a long time
i hope not
arent you allowing feelings to prevent
you from answering your own questions
exactly why i advise you
to hire my successor
good
any questions
no
does our subject still wear pink socks
anna
phone rings
its me
its anna
i am downtown
why downtown ive been waiting all day
i need some time to think
what do you mean to think
think about what
to think about me
wh wh where are you
when will you
phone cuts off
ring tone
hello
margie this is mark
now i know theres no sympathy
between us and its
hard for me to ask you for help but
youre her only friend
now just tell me the truth
she has somebody
she wished youd say or do something
something to reinstall you
you know a magic wave of the wand
you arrived sooner than expected mark
yes sure this is all my fault
now how long has this been going on
quite long
who is he
oh mark i dont
your wife keeps her own secrets
margie
i dont have a magic wand
i dont intend to hang on
but make her talk to me
itll be the way that she wants
but this is not
proper
please
phone cut off
continuous tone
phone rings
yes
were over mark
you have someone
yes
for a long time
does it matter
yes
yes
do you
sleep with him
yes
do you like it
yes
more than with me
yes
i see
how do you intend to live now
we have to discuss it
now
as you want
half an hour at the cafe einstein
im too far for half an hour
are you calling from there
yes
is he listening
no
but he is there
yes
would 800 a month for bob be enough
i suppose
will you move in with him or
keep the apartment
ill keep it if you allow me to
ive decided not to see bob
at all
at all
how can you say that
hes going to be fucked up
enough as it is
i dont want to fuck him up even more
by playing sunday daddy
what were you to him anyway
precisely
but
he knows you hes yours he needs
a real father full time
well i thought i could be
coming home from the war so to speak
you say its better with him than with me
i get bored of it
tell me
i think what you want to do to bob is
inhuman so what youre doing
must be human
how long is it going to last
i dont know
one week two weeks
and how do you dispose of ideas
like honesty and loyalty
if i could only believe that it happened
cleanly at first sight
ok if it makes things easier
i was in his bed the first night
i met him if you have to know
what do you expect of me
look what youre doing
noone is good or bad
but if you want i am the bad one
and if i knew he existed in this world
i would have never had bob with you
get out
get out get out
screaming
ringing tone
woman speaks faintly
erm
hallo
mm
hallo hallo
ma ma ma
thunder and rain
panting
how how long have i
how long have i been here
three weeks sir
what happened its daddy
mummy said she would be right back
but she never came
then margie called and told me to be brave
because she had broke her leg and
she had to have the cast put on
youve been alone for a long time
look i got a new boat
did you get it from mummy
no from uncle heinrich
long ago
yes
yesterday
no before you were coming back
from far away
ok little piggy
come on lets get out of this mess
how did you make such a mess
key in lock
this is not always like this mark
usually im on time
im not interested
i came to tell you that
i cant live without you
and im ready to understand
whatever there is
but it doesnt look like
it makes much sense
you cant take bob away from me
im not trying
you can continue to visit whenever
you want but im taking over here
anna is there anything i can do
you could just
yes
i must
yes
i must
you must restore order
you must leave him
you will call him
you will say it is over
now i dont care if you tell him
you love him
but hes not your family
your family is here
you must call him now
but i cant on the phone
i dont trust you
i have to tell him face to face
i dont trust you
on the phone
oh jesus
jesus jesus jesus
jesus jesus jesus
jesus
if you want to stay make that call
its still quite warm i dont think
youll need a winter coat or sweater
i cant stand to see you like this
it could be the way you want
just dont cry any more
i am very sleepy
phone rings
anna is with me and shell stay with me
he phoned me
he said she wont be coming back
i have to talk to her right now
please give me that number
5426261
where is it
i dont know mark
punches numbers
ringing tone
hello
yes
i want to speak to heinrich
my son is not in town who is calling
annas husband
annas not here
i havent seen her for weeks
i miss her so much
hallo hallo
hallo
slams phone down
whispers 5426261
what happened
weewee
shall i take you
wheres mummy
she went to see margie
are you going too
im staying with you
hello im bobs father ill be bringing
him to school from now on
im glad youre the father who went
far away and met the polar bears
hello
what is this a joke
what are you talking about
i mean your wig
what
im so sorry its impossible
have you ever seen my wife
naturally every day of the school year
youre heinrich
yes
ive come for anna
annas not here
you want me to break down
the bloody door
you dont have to its open
we dont have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite
our situation is like a mountain lake
we are trying to swim in
starting from different shores
i am not astonished you are here
i was thinking about you
just before you came
so now that youre here
lets be open to each other
you can hate me as much as you like
but its you who wants
to know things from me
so please make it possible
i am suffering as much as you are
the fact that anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone
but i always accept annas ways
as i think noone has a right
to impose his will on anyone
so thats how youve changed her so much
possibly but is it changing her
or making her open to herself
so open shes inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her
what are you talking about
we spoke on the phone last night
you and i didnt we
stop it i just arrived from hamburg
you werent listening to me
i was just trying to make her comprehend
that i love her
i left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself
i allowed you your chance
bullshit
im not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way its offensive
how long have you been fucking me over
a year
all my visits home all that time
yes
and this is what you mean by
accepting annas ways
precisely
the key being the infinitive
to accept
i have been honest with you
would you permit me to enquire
on a specific point
on your last visit home
were you content with your wife
i mean sexually
why
because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony
er
my mother
is she here all the time
yes
even when youre fucking anna
of course
agh
why
why
agh
groans
groans again
bob eating green bananas
where dyou think he put the skins
down his new pyjamas
anna laughs
yes yes
baa baa black sheep have you any wool
yes sir yes sir three bags full
one for the master one for the dame
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane

why are you nagging me
cant you just leave me in peace
i could have perfect peace
if you never came back
its bob i have bob he is my son too
dont try to tell me you care about him
all that much
he didnt stop you from breaking us up
if you really thought about him youd
give a thought to us for christs sake
i do i do
no you dont you think about buying him
a pair of shoes
about making him a snack
about telling him a bedtime story
but if you really thought about him
youd think about us
right right why are you always right
but its difficult dont you understand
its difficult i didnt want it to happen
but it happened and now
dont come any closer
anna its me
dont you understand you disgust me
i cant stand you touching me
you make me
you know love isnt something you can
just switch from channel to channel

a whore yes

danke
thanks
sorry to bother you miss
im from the building managers office
we had a complaint about
some broken windows somewhere
and the glass falling
down on the sidewalk
is that what it is
im afraid i have to check your windows
but i can assure you theyre all right
how can you be so sure
i just i just saw you come in
itll only take a moment
but i dont want you to be here
i quite understand miss
but its me or the police
a lady got hurt on the sidewalk
a turkish woman
you might say she shouldnt be here in the
first place but she lodged a complaint
so what can i do about it
nothing
please
is it ok
moment
so
excuse me the bathroom
the bathroom doesnt have a window
are you sure
absolutely
some bathrooms have windows
this side of the house
not in this one
im afraid i still have to check it
before someone else gets
would you care for a glass of wine
wine
yes
im afraid i
yes wine
im afraid you
oh come on dont be so formal
miss it doesnt make any sense
ive got kkkids
i only came for the windows
im sorry miss but
i still have to have a look
oh it broke
squelching and dripping
was ist
whats
she screams
she screams again
how long
ah ages and ages
much longer than i could
door buzzer
bob neena neena neena
hello im sorry to bother you so late
may i see your wife
no she went out
bob neena neena neena
thats not entirely true she
she doesnt live with us any longer
oh
its about bob
ah bob
bob is fine
hes just beaten the world record
in tub diving
oh she laughs
hello bob
come on cut it out bob
door buzzer
buzzing continues
look um
would you be so kind
buzzer continues
hes actually been in the bath
for about an hour
yes of course
ive called many times
i wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts
in this fundamentally vulgar structure
the triangle
in other words where is she
ive been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects
of your anger and your defence
is anna with you
and if
i would only ask to have a talk with her
what if i said no
im sorry i used violence with you
now id only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me
oh im so sorry shes not here
did i tell you i had a wife
and a daughter
no
they live in cincinnati
what does that do for you
they will always remain my first family
anna could be the second
and you and bob in some sense
do you have a dog
would that i had
you misuse me
its stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp
who are the crusaders of every
blind principle socalled ideology
humanity invents to strangle me
why dont you like me
why dont you draw in
the plentitude of my love
and pull it all over your life
like a veil
ok i like you
and i can tell you where anna lives
lives
only i dont know the guys name
its impossible it doesnt make sense
why not
because you think youve given her
the supreme pleasure
you with your yinyang balls
dangling from your zen brain
ok maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest in which case
im sure you win hands down
but is that all
bob neena neena
neena neena neena
bob continues
i used to be afraid of you
but i dont think i am any more
theres nothing to fear except god
whatever that means to you
for me god is a disease
thats why through the disease
we can reach god
tracking something said winniethepooh
very mysteriously
tracking what said piglet
coming closer
thats just what i ask myself
i ask myself what
what do you think youll answer
he wants to say good night to you
thank you
you smell clean
do you like helen
i think so
are you not sure
well i dont know her yet
do you like her
yes and who dont you like
well i dont like heinrich
and i dont like that sailboat
why hes funny
i dont like
i dont like mummy to like him
more than us
whos prettier mummy or helen
who do you think is prettier
you tell me
our mummy
good night son
thank you
do you have anyone to help you with him
oh its its not a problem i
i have plenty of time
bob wont say anything to me
he keeps his words for himself
he knows everything senses everything
children are amazing
yeah
after lunch we have an hours rest
bob very often goes to sleep
when he does he cries or shouts
does he do it at home
no
oh
he screams
it is very difficult to calm him down
when he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened
what can i say
im at war against women
they have no foresight
theres nothing about them that is stable
theres nothing to trust
theyre dangerous
there is nothing in common among women
except menstruation
excuse me
i come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint
because you can see it in the flesh
it becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it
which doesnt mean i admire your world
but i find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe
im
im one of the contaminated
because you never feel free do you
so sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil
and what about lack of freedom
its extraordinary
all right
together we can listen if bob cries out
you dont have to make love to me
im not trying
bob screaming
what happened
i want mummy my mummy
mummy my mummy mummy mummy
its ok its all right
its ok its all right
mummy mummy mummy
its all right its all right
mummy mummy mummy
bob whimpers
whispers its all right its all right
its all right
its all right sh
im sorry
it wasnt very wise of me
this makes you think
youve been right all along
hello bob
children im the big boss here
youre the little boss
good morning i phoned you at home
then i thought i might catch you here
i didnt tell you where
bob goes to school
it wasnt difficult
we have a minor problem here
yes
the detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didnt come home last night
so
he wasnt at home this morning and
he hasnt reported to the office
before we start to get worried
when was he going to check it
yesterday or today
i dont know
please dont misunderstand me
that detective couldve gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores
although thats not much likely
he could have died of a heart attack
if our detective doesnt show up
by noon ill have to notify the police
the police will start digging into your
problem thats how it is
you and i can claim professional secrecy
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you
sebastianstrasse 87 floor 1
have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned
no
very sensible of you
but may i ask why not
i had the impression that you were
tremendously interested
in finding your wife
yes i was
i suppose i still am
but that was out of pure blind ambition
and you know something
i dont feel like theres anything
much ambitious left in me
i see
so i dont even have to ask you
as a personal favour
not to come to the office
until i contact you
why
precisely because of the
delicacy of your feelings
you might be able to understand that
my interest in the case comes
from the fact that i
live with that detective
ill be calling
sound of scrubbing
i have to talk to you
thats what i guessed
have you ever seen this man
do i have to answer you
well you have to answer
to someone eventually
thats too easy
but its you or the police right
right
why
youre scaring me
am i not scared
oh yes
i see
darkness is easeful
and the temptation to let go
promises so much comfort
after the pain
hes in there
squelching and dripping
squelching and deep breathing
mein gott
my god
he is very tired
he made love to me all night

he is still unfinished you know

from now on shell know
how much righteous anger
and sheer will shes got in her to say
i can do as well i can be better
im the best
only in this case can she
become a success
nobody took me there
thats why im with you
because you say i for me
because you say i for me
projector whirrs
chair creaks
yes im thinking about him
but i recognise the self who has just done
something horrible
like the sister ive casually met
on the street hello sister
its like those two sisters of
faith and chance
its like those two sisters of
faith and chance
well faith cant exclude chance
but chance
oh sh
well its like those two sisters of
faith and chance
my faith cant exclude chance
but my chance can explain faith
my faith didnt allow me
to wait for chance
and chance didnt give me
enough faith
well
and then i read that private life
is a stage
only im playing in many parts that are
smaller than me and yet i still play them
i suffer i believe i am
but at the same time i know theres
a third possibility you know
like cancer or madness but cancer
and madness contort reality
the possibility im talking about
pierces reality
well im unable to say it maybe
maybe its impossible to say
maybe im too stupid
youre looking at me as if you
youre looking at me as if to tell me
that i need you to fill me up
as if im an empty space
well i love you too but what makes me
go on is to know hell return
and that ill make him suffer
and ill hurt him and im betraying him
but this brings me small rewards
yet i cant exist by myself
because im afraid of myself
because im the maker of my own evil
because
because im
goodness is only some kind of
reflection upon evil
thats the way it is
ah she sighs
what are you doing
im sorting out his things
to take to the laundry
i could do it myself
but its my job
im very good at it
very kind of you but
maybe you could do it when bob is at home
its getting so difficult for you
isnt it
youre not as
youre not as strong or as sure of
yourself as you thought you were
so you keep coming back
you must be you must be
torn apart
i can i can think more clearly now
i guess
i guess when youre there
you want to be home
and when youre home
you want to be there
if what you have there is
so strong for you
if its what you never had
stick to it keep it
she cries out
its very quiet here when youre out
it was very quiet when you werent here
come over here lets just see if we can
sit together peacefully still
cries getting louder
is it the same there
screams no
can you tell me now
i messed everything up
even bob
ive been a cheat a liar
completely alone wounded
and you think im immoral shit
i think so too but not for
the same reasons
screams i feel nothing for noone
its as if the two sisters were
too exhausted to fight any more
you know these women wrestling
in an arena of mud
with their hands locked
at each others throats
each waiting to see who will die first
and both staring at me
she whimpers
she whimpers
she whimpers
she whimpers
whimper echoes
whimper echoes
whimpering gets louder
she cries
she cries again
she cries again
church bells ringing
laughs hysterically
laughter becomes screaming
loud panting
panting becomes screaming
she screams
she screams
what i miscarried there was sister faith
and what was left is sister chance
so i had to take care of my faith
to protect it
and thats what youre doing there
yes
you look uglier
youve hardened
for the first time you look
vulgar to me
you know i remember when i was a kid
have you ever seen a dying dog
you know one of those old dogs
that comes to die under the
under the porch of the house
at the last moment
it yelps
in terror
as if its seen something real
i want you to take off the ring
and the wristwatch i gave you
last time i came home
dont forget to give him his yoghurt
no
i have to go
if i threw myself at your feet and yelped
would you still walk over me
yes
hello this is annas husband speaking
heinrichs mother annas not here

whats happening to her

i thought you needed the time
but now its time enough

im the only one in your life
who has rights on you
because i dont claim any
i brought it from india
you know this is what the french poet
michaux was writing about
i kept it for you
with this love opens to absolutely
unknown horizons
absolutely unknown
anna
we are made to swim in the centre
of the stream
not to wait on the dry banks
yes

heavy breathing

they are beginning to smell
this cant be true
ive got to keep this place
clean and well
oh my god
are you going to help me
heinrich
you are no different from anyone else
we are all the same
but in different words
with different bodies
different versions
like insects
meat
he gasps
anna
phone rings
imitates engine
imitates aeroplane
calling all ambulances and fire engines
to the scene of the crash
and two trucks
bob imitates siren
where
doorbell buzzes
can you answer the door bob
now listen heinrich
just stay where you are
i paid a fortune for the cab
at the bar at the corner
bleed for a while
ill be there as soon as i can
my son took the car an automatic one
can you look after bob till i get back
what is it
its mummy calling me
fly buzzing
fly buzzing
nervous laughter
gasping
he screams
hissing
fly buzzing
mark humming
arcade machine plays tune
no not out here
go to the toilet
need a tampax
how can you joke while im so hurt
there are corpses in there
at least two bodies
i thought she was pulling my leg
but no theres blood
she cuts them
a monster a joke but it was alive
youre drunk heinrich
she cuts us to pieces mark
maybe she just didnt want to see you
dont joke im not joking
oh yes youre not joking
so what do you want
dont you understand
shes killing people
i understand shes killing people so why
do you call me and not the police
she is sick mark doesnt that
mean anything to you
there are dead bodies there
i dont believe you
maybe youre stoned on
some shit you suck on
some mushroom you gobble
perhaps you did it to yourself
maybe youre learning how to suffer
now that would be an achievement
i feel for people
you talk for people
you take their wives
shouts i take what i want
and im at peace with myself
nobody saw me come in nobody
i called you because we have to do
something to help her
why
it isnt normal it wasnt even human
it was
divine
perhaps you met god a moment ago
and you didnt even realise it
now you believe in god dont you
certainly
in that great incomprehensible god whom
you reached through fucking or dope
am i right
look mark that woman is crazy
we have to do something
we
im not going to do anything
i cant leave it this way its anna
its murder
youre not a man mark youre a woman
all right if you dont intend to do
anything and want to keep me silent
you will have to pay
you have money i know it
you have to get me out of here and send
me on a long trip to restore my harmony
i deserve it
if you had only seen what i saw
he retches
heinrich help me out of here im sick
im the one who is wounded  not you
please
toilet flushes
coughing
gas hissing
woman laughs
gods light avenge them
giving it out clean and
getting it back dirty
she gurgles
whispers do you believe in god
sobs in god
its in me
take me
take me
did margie see it
yes
thats why you killed her
she tried to take it away from me
is this faith that helpless
it needs to be protected
like a child
yes
you know for me god is still under
the porch where the dog died
and on the branch of the eucalyptus tree
where id lie for hours
and watch how the clouds change
the colour of the grass below
i need money
i had to leave there
oh ive cleaned all the mess
i washed the floor i made the bed
i didnt know where to go
it became so unsafe there
people cant stop trying to
take it away from me
ok
now leave me the car
take margies keys and go to her place
and wait there
can you drive a motorbike
heinrich taught me
its outside
now ill take care of bob and everything
ill go to the bank on monday
and take the money out
if bob wakes up tell him
i will
its only me go to sleep
i have to go
please close the door
because its here with you
yes
dogs barking
phone rings
im sorry to disturb you but
yes
you understand that it is very late
and heinrich hasnt called me yet
he calls me every night so i wont worry
about when he comes home
maybe maybe he just forgot your number
no you dont understand mothers always
feel it when their sons are in trouble
are you worried
are you worried that hes not there
having sex with my wife
they should come here
ive put clean sheets on the bed
and they could have dinner
are you quite sure you know
who you are talking to
i am
i went there
where
i was worried you understand
there isnt any apartment there
under the address you gave me
theres only a smoking hole that the
police wont allow anybody to come near
so i went to a bar at the corner
to call home to find out
if heimlich had returned
yes
and heinrich was there
nobody could identify him
yes
i recognised his body of course
did you identify him for the police
no it was only heinrichs body
but his soul was not there
perhaps he and his soul had
parted company before
you dont know what youre talking about
no youre quite right i dont have
any idea what im talking about
he must have seemed to you better
and more beautiful than you
when anna met him she immediately
worshipped his soul
and you sent him there
now listen to me
i recognise heinrichs superiority
in every way
i was proud that anna accepted him
now anna has gone missing
and im here
all alone you understand
with our little son
now i must find her
maybe its her fault
ill find her and ill force her to tell
me what shes done with heinrichs soul
and then ill come to you and tell you
wont you come up
im in a rush
is it your wife
here
will you promise me something
yes
whatever it is
i promise
moaning
moaning gets louder
she cries out
almost
almost
almost
almost
almost
almost
yes
almost
almost
heinrichs dead
isnt he
yes
have you found anna
yes
you come like the angel of death
the one who kills
i have thought about killing her
and now
now i dont know
did you see anything that
made you change your mind
i dont know what i saw
but heinrich saw it too
and you came to tell me that you dont
know where heinrichs soul is
yes
i can see it in your face
it would be good to think that the soul
lives separately from the body
that the soul lives for ever
and the body only for a time
but it isnt so
i dont know any more
i do
i have to be on my sons side
even if he has made you unhappy
i know all there is to know about him
that i love him
yes
i was wondering which is worse
take away someones wife
hurt a child
or to kill
he also had a wife and a child
i used to like her
i liked your anna too
i had to like both of them
since they loved him
the world is only what it is
murderous
if we are the best of it
you dont have to worry about me
i dont want to be here
if heinrich is not around any more
window creaks
that dog didnt die of old age
what about you mark
our man wont confide or deal with
your successor he wants you
in fact mark there is no successor
we can take care of drowning dogs
but please help us take care of
the drowning world
dont you think its uneconomical
to waste yourself on dogs
even dogs you love
i met a man who loved everything
and he died in a flood of shit
we know thats just details
when i was a boy
i had a dog and his name was louis
when he crawled under the porch to die
i stayed there with him
so what
i wanted to see what it was
that made him crawl under there
nobodys a boy any more
must we prove it
this is the address
back up then full speed
and crash into the police car
my pleasure sir
out of the car
out of the car
he yells
gasping
church bells ringing
car engine
door slams
footsteps
