now  shut up and go to sleep 
good night 
stealing is a sin 
l don t want it 
honey  it s to help you 
l don t want it 
you fucking bastard 
remember also  o lord 
thy servant  mary karras   
   who has gone before us  with the sign
of faith  and sleeps the sleep of peace 
  lord  l am not worthy to receive you 
  but only say the word
and l shall be healed 
  may the body of christ bring thee
to everlasting life   
lt s a symptom   
   of a type of disturbance in
the chemical electrical activity of the brain 
ln your daughter s case 
in the temporal lobe 
that s up here in the lateral part
of the brain 
lt s rare  but it does cause
bizarre hallucinations   
   and usually just before a convulsion 
a convulsion 
the shaking of the bed 
that s doubtless due to muscular spasms 
no  no  that was no spasm 
l got on the bed  the whole bed was
thumping and rising off the floor   
   and shaking  the whole thing 
with me on it 
mrs  macneil  the problem
with your daughter is not her bed 
lt s her brain 
what causes this 
a lesion in the temporal lobe 
lt s a kind of seizure disorder 
look  doc  l really don t understand
how her whole personality could change 
ln the temporal lobe  it s very common 
lt is 
lt can last for days  even weeks 
lt isn t rare to find destructive   
   even criminal behavior 
do me a favor  will you 
tell me something good 
don t be alarmed  lf it s a lesion 
in a way  she s fortunate 
all we have to do is remove the scar 
regan  can you sit up and scoot over here 
watch the l v 
a little more 
good 
l m just going to move you down
on the table  okay 
just for a short time 
very sticky 
now  regan  you re going to feel
something a little cold and wet 
now you re going to feel a little stick here 
don t move 
good 
you re going to feel some pressure here 
now  don t move 
hook up 
there s just nothing there 
no vascular displacement at all 
do you want me to run another series 
l don t think so 
l d like you to see her again 
excuse me  doctor 
chris macneil is on the phone 
she says it s urgent 
 have you got some time 
 of course 
dr  klein 
yes  l m dr  klein  this is dr  tanney 
things have gotten worse since l phoned 
come upstairs 
 ls she having spasms again 
 yes  but they re violent 
 you gave her the medication 
 yes 
 what was that 
 thorazine 
before that  it was ritalin 
chris  doctors 
mother  please 
please  mother  make him stop 
lt s burning  lt s burning 
do something  doctor  please  help her 
make him stop  he s trying to kill me 
mother 
all right  regan 
let s see what the trouble  
keep away 
the sow is mine 
fuck me 
fuck me 
stay away from me 
hold her tight 
don t let them  mother 
she s heavily sedated 
she ll probably sleep through tomorrow 
what was going on in there 
how could she fly off the bed like that 
pathological states can induce
abnormal strength   
   accelerated motor performance 
for example   
   say a 9o pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck   
   runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground 
you ve heard the story  same thing here 
same principle  l mean 
so what s wrong with her 
we still think that the temporal lobe  
what are you talking about 
for christ s sake 
did you see her or not 
she s acting like she s fucking
out of her mind 
psychotic  like a split personality  or    
there haven t been more
than 1oo authentic cases   
   of so called   split personality   
mrs  macneil 
now  l know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry   
   but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first 
so  what s next 
a pneumoencephalogram 
l would think  to pin down that lesion 
lt will involve another spinal 
oh  christ 
what we missed in the eeg
and the arteriograms   
   could conceivably turn up there 
at least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities 
dr  tanney says the x rays are negative 
ln other words  normal 
do you keep any drugs in your house 
no  of course not  nothing like that 
are you sure 
of course  l m sure 
l d tell you 
christ  l don t even smoke grass 
are you planning to be home soon 
l mean to la 
no  l    
l m building a new house 
my old one has been sold 
l was going to take regan to europe
for a while after she finished school 
why do you ask 
l think it s time we started
looking for a psychiatrist 
hello 
shit 
god 
what do you mean going off
and leaving regan by herself 
are you crazy  her window s wide open 
 didn t he tell you 
 who 
 burke 
 what s burke got to do with it 
nobody was here 
when l went to get the thorazine   
   l had him stay with her  and    
l should ve known better 
l guess you should have 
how were the tests 
we have to start looking for a shrink 
hi  chuck  come on in 
l suppose you heard 
heard what 
you haven t heard 
burke is dead 
he must ve been drunk 
he fell from the top of the steps outside 
by the time he hit m street 
he broke his neck 
oh  god 
yeah  l know 
when l touch your forehead 
open your eyes 
are you comfortable  regan 
yes 
how old are you 
twelve 
ls there someone inside you 
sometimes 
who is it 
l don t know 
ls it captain howdy 
l don t know 
lf l ask him to tell me 
will you let him answer 
no 
why not 
l m afraid 
lf he talks to me  l think he ll leave you 
do you want him to leave you 
yes 
l m speaking to the person
inside of regan now 
lf you are there  you too are hypnotized   
   and must answer all my questions 
come forward   
   and answer me now 
are you the person inside of regan 
who are you 
 help me 
 let go 
father karras 
have we met 
no  we haven t met 
but they said l could tell 
that you look like a boxer 
william f  kinderman  homicide 
what s this all about 
lt s true  you do look like a boxer 
like john garfield in body and soul 
exactly  john garfield 
do people tell you that  father 
do people say you look like paul newman 
always 
you know this director who was doing
a film here  burke dennings 
l ve seen him 
you ve seen him 
you re also familiar how last week he died 
only what l read in the papers 
father  what do you know
on the subject of witchcraft 
from the witching end  not the hunting 
l once did a paper on it 
really 
from the psychiatric end 
l know  l read it 
all of this desecration in the church   
   does this have anything to do
with witchcraft 
maybe  some rituals used
in the black mass 
and now dennings  you read how he died 
ln a fall 
let me tell you how  please  father   
   confidential 
burke dennings  good father  was found   
   at the bottom of those steps leading
to m street   
   with his head turned completely around   
   facing backwards 
that didn t happen in the fall 
lt s possible 
 possible  however    
 unlikely 
exactly 
so  on the one hand 
we ve got a witchcraft kind of murder   
   and on the other hand  a black mass type
desecration in the church 
you think the killer
and the desecrator are the same 
maybe somebody crazy  somebody with   
   a spite against the church 
some unconscious rebellion 
a sick priest  is that it 
look  father  this is hard for you 
please  l understand   
   but for priests on the campus here 
you re the psychiatrist 
you d know who was sick at the time 
who wasn t 
l mean  this kind of sickness 
you d know that 
l don t know anyone
who fits that description 
doctor s ethics  lf you knew 
you wouldn t tell  huh 
no  l probably wouldn t 
not to bother you with trivia 
but a psychiatrist   
   in sunny california  no less   
   was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient 
ls that a threat 
no  l mention it only in passing 
lncidentally  l mention it only in passing   
   l could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession 
father  wait a minute 
 do you like movies 
 very much 
well  l get passes
to the best shows in town 
mrs  k  you know 
she gets tired  never likes to go 
that s too bad 
l hate to go alone 
l love to talk film   
   to discuss  to critique 
you want to see a film with me 
who s in it 
debbie reynolds does desdemona and
othello  groucho marx  are you happy 
l ve seen it 
one last time  can you think
of some priest who fits the bill 
come on 
no  answer the question  father paranoia 
all right 
you know who l think really did it 
who 
the dominicans  go pick on them 
l could have you deported  you know that 
l lied 
you look like sal mineo 
it looks like a type of disorder
that s rarely ever seen anymore   
   except in primitive cultures 
we call it   somnambular form possession    
quite frankly  we really don t know
much about it at all  except that   
   it starts with a conflict or a guilt   
   and leads to the patient s delusions
that his body   
   has been invaded
by some alien intelligence 
a spirit 
look  l m telling you again 
and you d better believe me   
   l am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum 
and l don t care what you call it 
l m not putting her away 
l m sorry 
you re sorry  jesus christ  88 doctors   
   and all you can tell me 
with all your bullshit is    
of course  there is one outside chance
for a cure 
l think of it as a shock treatment 
as l said  it s a very outside chance 
would you just name it 
for god s sake  what is it 
do you have any religious beliefs 
no 
what about your daughter 
no 
why 
have you ever heard of exorcism 
well  it s a stylized ritual in which the   
   rabbi or the priest try to drive out
the so called invading spirit 
lt s been pretty much discarded
these days except by   
   the catholics  who keep it in the closet
as a sort of embarrassment  but   
   it has worked   
   in fact  although 
not for the reasons they think 
lt s purely force of suggestion 
the victim s belief in possession   
   is what helped cause it 
so in that same way   
   the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear 
you re telling me l should take
my daughter to a witch doctor 
ls that it 
did you put this in regan s bedroom 
she s going to be well 
karl  if you put this in regan s bedroom 
l want you to tell me  now  did you 
no  not me 
l didn t 
this was under regan s pillow 
did you put it there 
of course  l didn t 
l didn t put it 
excuse me  madam 
what 
a man to see you 
what man 
might your daughter remember  perhaps   
   if mr  dennings was in her room
that night 
why do you ask 
might she remember 
no  she was heavily sedated 
lt s serious 
yes  l m afraid it is 
may l ask  
we still don t know 
watch out for drafts 
a draft in the fall 
when the house is hot  is   
   a magic carpet for bacteria 
excuse me  madam  anything else 
no  karl  we re fine  thank you 
lt s all right 
why are you asking all this 
lt s strange 
the deceased comes to visit 
stays only 2o minutes   
   and leaves all alone a very sick girl 
speaking plainly  mrs  macneil   
   it isn t likely he would fall
from a window 
besides  a fall wouldn t do to his neck
what we found   
   except maybe one chance in a thousand 
no  my hunch    
my opinion   
   he was killed by a very powerful man 
point one 
and the fracturing of his skull  point two   
   plus the various other things
we mentioned   
   would make it very probable   
   probable  not certain   
   that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter s window 
but nobody was in the room
except your daughter  so how can this be 
lt could be one way 
lf someone came calling
between the time miss spencer left   
   and the time you returned 
judas priest  just a second 
the servants  they have visitors 
not at all 
you were expecting a package that day 
some delivery 
none that l know of 
groceries  cleaning   a package 
l really wouldn t know 
karl takes care of all that 
l see 
would you like to ask him 
no  never mind  it s   
   it s very remote 
no  never mind 
would you like some more coffee 
please 
that s cute 
your daughter  she s the artist 
thank you 
lncidentally   
   you might ask your daughter   
   if she remembers seeing mr  dennings
in her room that night 
look  he wouldn t have any reason
in the world to go to her room 
l know  l realize  but   
   if certain british doctors never asked 
  what is this fungus      
   we wouldn t today have penicillin 
correct 
when she s better  l ll ask her 
lt couldn t hurt 
ln the meantime    
that s okay 
l really hate to ask you this  but   
   for my daughter 
could you please give an autograph 
of course  where s a pencil 
right here 
she d love it 
what s her name 
l lied  lt s for me 
the spelling is on the back  kinderman 
you know that film you made  angel 
l saw that six times 
really 
lt was beautiful 
thank you 
you re a very nice lady 
 thank you 
 you re a nice man 
l ll come back when she s feeling better 
  bye 
  bye 
please  no 
 do it 
 please  don t 
you bitch  do it  do it 
please  no 
let jesus fuck you 
let jesus fuck you 
give it  give it to me 
lick me  lick me 
 mrs  macneil 
 open the door 
do you know what she did 
your cunting daughter 
chris macneil 
please go away 
l m father karras 
l m very sorry  hello 
lt s all right  l should ve said
l wouldn t be in uniform 
that would ve helped 
 have you got a cigarette  father 
 sure 
thanks 
cold 
yeah 
how did a shrink ever get to be a priest 
lt s the other way around  the society
sent me through medical school 
where 
harvard  bellevue   
   johns hopkins  places like that 
 you re a friend of father dyer s  right 
 yes  l am 
 pretty close 
 pretty close 
did he talk to you about my party 
he sure did 
about my daughter 
no  l didn t know you had one 
 he didn t mention her 
 no 
he didn t tell you what she did 
he didn t mention her 
priests are pretty tight mouthed 
then  huh 
that depends 
 on what 
 the priest 
l mean  what if a person   
   came to you  you know  that was
a murderer or a criminal of some kind   
   and they wanted some kind of help 
would you have to turn them in 
well  if he came to me for spiritual advice 
l d say no 
 you wouldn t 
 no  l wouldn t 
but l would try to convince him
to turn himself in 
and  how do you go about
getting an exorcism 
l beg your pardon 
lf a person is  you know 
possessed by a demon  or something   
   how do they get an exorcism 
first  l d have to get them
into a time machine   
   and get them back to the 16th century 
l didn t get you 
lt just doesn t happen any more 
mrs  macneil 
oh  yeah  since when 
since we learned about mental illness 
paranoia  schizophrenia   
   those things they taught me at harvard 
mrs  macneil 
since the day l joined the jesuits   
   l ve never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism  not one 
yeah  well   
   it just so happens
that somebody very close to me   
   is probably possessed 
and needs an exorcist 
father karras  it s my little girl 
that s all the more reason
to forget about exorcism 
why  l don t understand 
to begin with  it could make things worse 
how 
the church  before it approves
an exorcism   
   conducts an investigation
to see if it s warranted 
that takes time 
you could do it yourself 
no  l couldn t  l d need church approval 
and that s rarely given 
could you see her 
yes  l could see her as a psychiatrist  
not a psychiatrist  she needs a priest 
she s seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world   
   and they sent me to you 
you re gonna send me back to them 
jesus christ  won t somebody help me 
oh  god  can t you help her 
just help her 
lt wants no straps 
hello  regan 
l m a friend of your mother s 
l d like to help you 
you might loosen these straps  then 
l m afraid you might hurt yourself  regan 
i m not regan 
l see 
well  then  let s introduce ourselves 
l m damien karras 
and i am the devil 
now kindly undo these straps 
lf you re the devil 
why not make the straps disappear 
that s much too vulgar a display
ofpower  karras 
where s regan 
in here  with us 
show me regan
and l ll loosen one of the straps 
could you help an old altar boy  father 
your mother is in here with us  karras 
would you like to leave a message 
i ll see that she gets it 
lf that s true   
   then you must know
my mother s maiden name 
what is it 
what is it 
thank you 
look  l m only against the possibility
of doing her more harm than good 
nothing you could do
could make it any worse 
l can t do it 
l need evidence that the church
would accept as signs of possession 
like what 
her speaking in a language
she s never known or studied 
what else 
l don t know  l d have to look it up 
l thought you were supposed
to be an expert 
there are no experts 
you probably know as much
about possession as most priests 
your daughter doesn t say she s a demon 
she says she s the devil himself 
lf you ve seen as many psychotics
as l have   
   you d realize that s the same as saying
you re napoleon bonaparte 
you asked me what l think is best
for your daughter 
six months under observation   
   in the best hospital you can find 
you show me regan s double   
   same face  same voice  everything   
   and l d know it wasn t regan 
l d know in my gut 
l m telling you that that thing upstairs
isn t my daughter 
l want you to tell me
that you know for a fact   
   there s nothing wrong with my daughter
except in her mind 
tell me you know for a fact 
an exorcism wouldn t do any good 
you tell me that 
did regan know a priest was coming over 
no 
did you know my mother died recently 
yes  l did  l m very sorry 
ls regan aware of it 
not at all 
why do you ask 
lt s not important  good night 
  he broke the bread 
and gave it to his disciples and said 
   take this  all of you  and eat it 
   for this is my body  
  when the supper was ended 
he took the cup 
  again he gave you thanks and praise 
  he gave the cup to his disciples and said 
 take this   
      all of you  and drink from it 
   this is the cup of my blood 
   the blood of the new and everlasting
covenant  the mystery of faith    
what an excellent day for an exorcism 
you d like that 
intensely 
but wouldn t that drive you out of regan 
it would bring us together 
you and regan 
you and us 
did you do that 
do it again 
in time 
no  now 
in time 
mirabile dictu  don t you agree 
you speak latin 
ego te absolvo 
quod nomen mihi est 
bonjour 
quod nomen mihi est 
la plume de ma tante 
how long are you planning
to stay in regan 
until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth 
what s that 
holy water 
you keep it away 
it burns 
oh  it burns 
who are you 
you know  l m like in seclusion 
no  l m just exhausted from work 
she s  she s all right  she s just    
l don t want to talk about it  okay 
okay  l ll talk to you  huh 
l ll call as soon as it s over  all right 
no  l just  l m going through something
and l just have to    
no  no    
there s nothing 
hey  thanks a lot 
 want a drink 
 please 
what do you drink 
scotch 
lce and water 
no ice  l ll get some from the kitchen 
l ll take it straight 
no  that s fine  please sit 
 you sure 
 yeah  sit 
where s her father 
ln europe 
 have you told him what s happening 
 no 
well  l think you should 
l told regan that was holy water 
l sprinkled it on her
and she reacted very violently 
lt s tap water 
what s the difference 
holy water is blessed  and that doesn t
help support a case for possession 
she killed burke dennings 
what 
she killed burke dennings 
she pushed him out her window 
no one 
who are you 
no one 
lt s a language  all right  lt s english 
what do you mean  english 
lt s english in reverse  listen 
give us time 
let her die 
i am no one  i am no one 
fear the priest 
fear the priest 
merrin 
i am no one 
merrin  fear the priest 
merrin 
yeah 
l ll be right there 
l don t want chris to see this 
what s wrong  what is it 
you re convinced that it s genuine 
l don t know 
no  not really  l suppose 
but l have made   
   a prudent judgement that it meets
the conditions set down in the ritual 
you would want to do
the exorcism yourself 
yes 
lt might be best to have a man
with experience 
maybe someone who s spent time
in the foreign missions 
l understand  your excellency 
let s see who s around 
ln the meantime 
l ll call you as soon as l know 
thank you  your excellency 
well  he does know the background 
l doubt there s any danger
in just having him assist 
there should be
a psychiatrist present  anyway 
what about the exorcist 
have you any ideas 
how about lankester merrin 
l had a notion he was in lraq 
l read he was working
on a dig near nineveh 
you re right  but he s finished 
he came back three or four months ago 
he s at woodstock now 
what s he doing there  teaching 
he s working on another book 
don t you think he s too old  tom 
how s his health 
he must be all right 
he s still running around digging up tombs 
besides  he s had experience 
l didn t know that 
ten  twelve years ago  l think  in africa 
the exorcism supposedly lasted months 
l heard it damn near killed him 
father 
 you re mrs  macneil 
 yes 
l m father merrin 
come in 
thank you 
 ls father karras here 
 yes  he s here already 
lt s an honor to meet you  father 
 are you very tired 
 no 
l d like you to go quickly
across to the residence   
   and gather up a cassock for myself   
   two surplices  a purple stole 
and some holy water   
   and   
   your copy of the roman ritual 
the large one 
l believe we should begin 
do you want to hear the background
of the case first 
why 
especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon 
we may ask what is relevant 
but anything beyond that is dangerous 
he s a liar  the demon is a liar 
he will lie to confuse us 
but he will also mix lies with the truth   
   to attack us 
the attack is psychological  damien 
and powerful 
so don t listen  remember that 
do not listen 
lt might be helpful
if l gave you some background   
   on the different personalities
regan has manifested 
so far  l d say there seem to be three 
 she s convinced that  
 there is only one 
stick your cock up her ass 
you mother fucking worthless cocksucker 
be silent 
  our father  who art in heaven 
hallowed be thy name 
  thy kingdom come  thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven 
  give us this day our daily bread 
  forgive us our trespasses   
     as we forgive those
who trespass against us 
  and lead us not into temptation   
     but deliver us from the evil one 
  save me  o god  by thy name 
by thy might  defend my cause 
  proud men have risen up against me 
and men of violence seek my life   
     but god is my helper
and the lord sustains my life 
  ln every need  he has delivered me 
  glory be to the father 
the son and the holy spirit 
  as it was in the beginning  is now
and ever shall be  world without end   
   save your servant 
   who places her trust in thee  my god 
  be unto her  o lord  a fortified tower   
  ln the face of the enemy   
     let the enemy have no power over her 
  and the son of lniquity
be powerless to harm her   
your mother sucks cocks in hell  karras

   and also with you 
   let us pray 
  holy lord  almighty father 
everlasting god   
     and father of our lord  jesus christ   
     who  once and for all  consigned

into the world to crush that roaring lion   
     hasten to our call for help   
     and snatch from ruination   
     and from the clutches
of the noon day devil   
     this human being 
made in your image and likeness 
  strike terror  lord  into the beast   
     now laying waste to your vineyard 
  let your mighty hand cast him out   
     of your servant 
regan theresa macneil   
     so he may no longer hold captive
this person   
     whom it pleased you
to make in your image   
     and to redeem through your son 
who lives and reigns with you   
     in the unity of the holy spirit 
god  forever and ever

serpents and scorpions 
  grant me   
     your unworthy servant   
      pardon for all my sins

     and the power to confront
this cruel demon
