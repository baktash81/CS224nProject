thats an insult lve got a vow of poverty
whered you get it then

l believe you
college presidents shouldnt drink
tends to set a bad example
l figure l saved him from a big temptation
oh christ
l should have been there l wasnt there
there was nothing you could do
lie down
give me the butt come on
now you think you can sleep
yeah are you going
to steal my shoes now
no
l tell fortunes by reading the creases
now shut up and go to sleep
good night
stealing is a sin
l dont want it
honey its to help you
l dont want it
you fucking bastard
remember also o lord
thy servant mary karras
who has gone before us with the sign
of faith and sleeps the sleep of peace
lord l am not worthy to receive you
but only say the word
and l shall be healed
may the body of christ bring thee
to everlasting life
lts a symptom
of a type of disturbance in
the chemicalelectrical activity of the brain
ln your daughters case
in the temporal lobe
thats up here in the lateral part
of the brain
lts rare but it does cause
bizarre hallucinations
and usually just before a convulsion
a convulsion
the shaking of the bed
thats doubtless due to muscular spasms
no no that was no spasm
l got on the bed the whole bed was
thumping and rising off the floor
and shaking the whole thing
with me on it
mrs macneil the problem
with your daughter is not her bed
lts her brain
what causes this
a lesion in the temporal lobe
lts a kind of seizure disorder
look doc l really dont understand
how her whole personality could change
ln the temporal lobe its very common
lt is
lt can last for days even weeks
lt isnt rare to find destructive
even criminal behavior
do me a favor will you
tell me something good
dont be alarmed lf its a lesion
in a way shes fortunate
all we have to do is remove the scar
regan can you sit up and scoot over here
watch the lv
a little more
good
lm just going to move you down
on the table okay
just for a short time
very sticky
now regan youre going to feel
something a little cold and wet
now youre going to feel a little stick here
dont move
good
youre going to feel some pressure here
now dont move
hook up
theres just nothing there
no vascular displacement at all
do you want me to run another series
l dont think so
ld like you to see her again
excuse me doctor
chris macneil is on the phone
she says its urgent
have you got some time
of course
dr klein
yes lm dr klein this is dr tanney
things have gotten worse since l phoned
come upstairs
ls she having spasms again
yes but theyre violent
you gave her the medication
yes
what was that
thorazine
before that it was ritalin
chris doctors
mother please
please mother make him stop
lts burning lts burning
do something doctor please help her
make him stop hes trying to kill me
mother
all right regan
lets see what the trouble
keep away
the sow is mine
fuck me
fuck me
stay away from me
hold her tight
dont let them mother
shes heavily sedated
shell probably sleep through tomorrow
what was going on in there
how could she fly off the bed like that
pathological states can induce
abnormal strength
accelerated motor performance
for example
say a 9opound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck
runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground
youve heard the story same thing here
same principle l mean
so whats wrong with her
we still think that the temporal lobe
what are you talking about
for christs sake
did you see her or not
shes acting like shes fucking
out of her mind
psychotic like a split personality or
there havent been more
than 1oo authentic cases
of socalled split personality
mrs macneil
now l know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry
but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first
so whats next
a pneumoencephalogram
l would think to pin down that lesion
lt will involve another spinal
oh christ
what we missed in the eeg
and the arteriograms
could conceivably turn up there
at least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities
dr tanney says the xrays are negative
ln other words normal
do you keep any drugs in your house
no of course not nothing like that
are you sure
of course lm sure
ld tell you
christ l dont even smoke grass
are you planning to be home soon
l mean to la
no l
lm building a new house
my old one has been sold
l was going to take regan to europe
for a while after she finished school
why do you ask
l think its time we started
looking for a psychiatrist
hello
shit
god
what do you mean going off
and leaving regan by herself
are you crazy her windows wide open
didnt he tell you
who
burke
whats burke got to do with it
nobody was here
when l went to get the thorazine
l had him stay with her and
l shouldve known better
l guess you should have
how were the tests
we have to start looking for a shrink
hi chuck come on in
l suppose you heard
heard what
you havent heard
burke is dead
he mustve been drunk
he fell from the top of the steps outside
by the time he hit m street
he broke his neck
oh god
yeah l know
when l touch your forehead
open your eyes
are you comfortable regan
yes
how old are you
twelve
ls there someone inside you
sometimes
who is it
l dont know
ls it captain howdy
l dont know
lf l ask him to tell me
will you let him answer
no
why not
lm afraid
lf he talks to me l think hell leave you
do you want him to leave you
yes
lm speaking to the person
inside of regan now
lf you are there you too are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions
come forward
and answer me now
are you the person inside of regan
who are you
help me
let go
father karras
have we met
no we havent met
but they said l could tell
that you look like a boxer
william f kinderman homicide
whats this all about
lts true you do look like a boxer
like john garfield in body and soul
exactly john garfield
do people tell you that father
do people say you look like paul newman
always
you know this director who was doing
a film here burke dennings
lve seen him
youve seen him
youre also familiar how last week he died
only what l read in the papers
father what do you know
on the subject of witchcraft
from the witching end not the hunting
l once did a paper on it
really
from the psychiatric end
l know l read it
all of this desecration in the church
does this have anything to do
with witchcraft
maybe some rituals used
in the black mass
and now dennings you read how he died
ln a fall
let me tell you how please father
confidential
burke dennings good father was found
at the bottom of those steps leading
to m street
with his head turned completely around
facing backwards
that didnt happen in the fall
lts possible
possible however
unlikely
exactly
so on the one hand
weve got a witchcraft kind of murder
and on the other hand a black masstype
desecration in the church
you think the killer
and the desecrator are the same
maybe somebody crazy somebody with
a spite against the church
some unconscious rebellion
a sick priest is that it
look father this is hard for you
please l understand
but for priests on the campus here
youre the psychiatrist
youd know who was sick at the time
who wasnt
l mean this kind of sickness
youd know that
l dont know anyone
who fits that description
doctors ethics lf you knew
you wouldnt tell huh
no l probably wouldnt
not to bother you with trivia
but a psychiatrist
in sunny california no less
was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient
ls that a threat
no l mention it only in passing
lncidentally l mention it only in passing
l could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession
father wait a minute
do you like movies
very much
well l get passes
to the best shows in town
mrs k you know
she gets tired never likes to go
thats too bad
l hate to go alone
l love to talk film
to discuss to critique
you want to see a film with me
whos in it
debbie reynolds does desdemona and
othello groucho marx are you happy
lve seen it
one last time can you think
of some priest who fits the bill
come on
no answer the question father paranoia
all right
you know who l think really did it
who
the dominicans go pick on them
l could have you deported you know that
l lied
you look like sal mineo
it looks like a type of disorder
thats rarely ever seen anymore
except in primitive cultures
we call it somnambularform possession
quite frankly we really dont know
much about it at all except that
it starts with a conflict or a guilt
and leads to the patients delusions
that his body
has been invaded
by some alien intelligence
a spirit
look lm telling you again
and youd better believe me
l am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum
and l dont care what you call it
lm not putting her away
lm sorry
youre sorry jesus christ 88 doctors
and all you can tell me
with all your bullshit is
of course there is one outside chance
for a cure
l think of it as a shock treatment
as l said its a very outside chance
would you just name it
for gods sake what is it
do you have any religious beliefs
no
what about your daughter
no
why
have you ever heard of exorcism
well its a stylized ritual in which the
rabbi or the priest try to drive out
the socalled invading spirit
lts been pretty much discarded
these days except by
the catholics who keep it in the closet
as a sort of embarrassment but
it has worked
in fact although
not for the reasons they think
lts purely force of suggestion
the victims belief in possession
is what helped cause it
so in that same way
the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear
youre telling me l should take
my daughter to a witch doctor
ls that it
did you put this in regans bedroom
shes going to be well
karl if you put this in regans bedroom
l want you to tell me now did you
no not me
l didnt
this was under regans pillow
did you put it there
of course l didnt
l didnt put it
excuse me madam
what
a man to see you
what man
might your daughter remember perhaps
if mr dennings was in her room
that night
why do you ask
might she remember
no she was heavily sedated
lts serious
yes lm afraid it is
may l ask
we still dont know
watch out for drafts
a draft in the fall
when the house is hot is
a magic carpet for bacteria
excuse me madam anything else
no karl were fine thank you
lts all right
why are you asking all this
lts strange
the deceased comes to visit
stays only 2o minutes
and leaves all alone a very sick girl
speaking plainly mrs macneil
it isnt likely he would fall
from a window
besides a fall wouldnt do to his neck
what we found
except maybe one chance in a thousand
no my hunch
my opinion
he was killed by a very powerful man
point one
and the fracturing of his skull point two
plus the various other things
we mentioned
would make it very probable
probable not certain
that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughters window
but nobody was in the room
except your daughter so how can this be
lt could be one way
lf someone came calling
between the time miss spencer left
and the time you returned
judas priest just a second
the servants they have visitors
not at all
you were expecting a package that day
some delivery
none that l know of
groceries cleaninga package
l really wouldnt know
karl takes care of all that
l see
would you like to ask him
no never mind its
its very remote
no never mind
would you like some more coffee
please
thats cute
your daughter shes the artist
thank you
lncidentally
you might ask your daughter
if she remembers seeing mr dennings
in her room that night
look he wouldnt have any reason
in the world to go to her room
l know l realize but
if certain british doctors never asked
what is this fungus
we wouldnt today have penicillin
correct
when shes better lll ask her
lt couldnt hurt
ln the meantime
thats okay
l really hate to ask you this but
for my daughter
could you please give an autograph
of course wheres a pencil
right here
shed love it
whats her name
l lied lts for me
the spelling is on the back kinderman
you know that film you made angel
l saw that six times
really
lt was beautiful
thank you
youre a very nice lady
thank you
youre a nice man
lll come back when shes feeling better
bye
bye
please no
do it
please dont
you bitch do it do it
please no
let jesus fuck you
let jesus fuck you
give it give it to me
lick me lick me
mrs macneil
open the door
do you know what she did
your cunting daughter
chris macneil
please go away
lm father karras
lm very sorry hello
lts all right l shouldve said
l wouldnt be in uniform
that wouldve helped
have you got a cigarette father
sure
thanks
cold
yeah
how did a shrink ever get to be a priest
lts the other way around the society
sent me through medical school
where
harvard bellevue
johns hopkins places like that
youre a friend of father dyers right
yes l am
pretty close
pretty close
did he talk to you about my party
he sure did
about my daughter
no l didnt know you had one
he didnt mention her
no
he didnt tell you what she did
he didnt mention her
priests are pretty tightmouthed
then huh
that depends
on what
the priest
l mean what if a person
came to you you know that was
a murderer or a criminal of some kind
and they wanted some kind of help
would you have to turn them in
well if he came to me for spiritual advice
ld say no
you wouldnt
no l wouldnt
but l would try to convince him
to turn himself in
and how do you go about
getting an exorcism
l beg your pardon
lf a person is you know
possessed by a demon or something
how do they get an exorcism
first ld have to get them
into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century
l didnt get you
lt just doesnt happen any more
mrs macneil
oh yeah since when
since we learned about mental illness
paranoia schizophrenia
those things they taught me at harvard
mrs macneil
since the day l joined the jesuits
lve never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism not one
yeah well
it just so happens
that somebody very close to me
is probably possessed
and needs an exorcist
father karras its my little girl
thats all the more reason
to forget about exorcism
why l dont understand
to begin with it could make things worse
how
the church before it approves
an exorcism
conducts an investigation
to see if its warranted
that takes time
you could do it yourself
no l couldnt ld need church approval
and thats rarely given
could you see her
yes l could see her as a psychiatrist
not a psychiatrist she needs a priest
shes seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world
and they sent me to you
youre gonna send me back to them
jesus christ wont somebody help me
oh god cant you help her
just help her
lt wants no straps
hello regan
lm a friend of your mothers
ld like to help you
you might loosen these straps then
lm afraid you might hurt yourself regan
im not regan
l see
well then lets introduce ourselves
lm damien karras
and i am the devil
now kindly undo these straps
lf youre the devil
why not make the straps disappear
thats much too vulgar a display
ofpower karras
wheres regan
in here with us
show me regan
and lll loosen one of the straps
could you help an old altar boy father
your mother is in here with us karras
would you like to leave a message
ill see that she gets it
lf thats true
then you must know
my mothers maiden name
what is it
what is it
thank you
look lm only against the possibility
of doing her more harm than good
nothing you could do
could make it any worse
l cant do it
l need evidence that the church
would accept as signs of possession
like what
her speaking in a language
shes never known or studied
what else
l dont know ld have to look it up
l thought you were supposed
to be an expert
there are no experts
you probably know as much
about possession as most priests
your daughter doesnt say shes a demon
she says shes the devil himself
lf youve seen as many psychotics
as l have
youd realize thats the same as saying
youre napoleon bonaparte
you asked me what l think is best
for your daughter
six months under observation
in the best hospital you can find
you show me regans double
same face same voice everything
and ld know it wasnt regan
ld know in my gut
lm telling you that that thing upstairs
isnt my daughter
l want you to tell me
that you know for a fact
theres nothing wrong with my daughter
except in her mind
tell me you know for a fact
an exorcism wouldnt do any good
you tell me that
did regan know a priest was coming over
no
did you know my mother died recently
yes l did lm very sorry
ls regan aware of it
not at all
why do you ask
lts not important good night
he broke the bread
and gave it to his disciples and said
take this all of you and eat it
for this is my body
when the supper was ended
he took the cup
again he gave you thanks and praise
he gave the cup to his disciples and said
take this
all of you and drink from it
this is the cup of my blood
the blood of the new and everlasting
covenant the mystery of faith
what an excellent day for an exorcism
youd like that
intensely
but wouldnt that drive you out of regan
it would bring us together
you and regan
you and us
did you do that
do it again
in time
no now
in time
mirabile dictu dont you agree
you speak latin
ego te absolvo
quod nomen mihi est
bonjour
quod nomen mihi est
la plume de ma tante
how long are you planning
to stay in regan
until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth
whats that
holy water
you keep it away
it burns
oh it burns
who are you
you know lm like in seclusion
no lm just exhausted from work
shes shes all right shes just
l dont want to talk about it okay
okay lll talk to you huh
lll call as soon as its over all right
no l just lm going through something
and l just have to
no no
theres nothing
hey thanks a lot

lce and water
no ice lll get some from the kitchen
lll take it straight
no thats fine please sit
you sure
yeah sit
wheres her father
ln europe
have you told him whats happening
no
well l think you should
l told regan that was holy water
l sprinkled it on her
and she reacted very violently
lts tap water
whats the difference
holy water is blessed and that doesnt
help support a case for possession
she killed burke dennings

i am no one i am no one
fear the priest
fear the priest
merrin
i am no one
merrin fear the priest
merrin
yeah
lll be right there
l dont want chris to see this
whats wrong what is it
youre convinced that its genuine
l dont know
no not really l suppose
but l have made
a prudent judgement that it meets
the conditions set down in the ritual
you would want to do
the exorcism yourself
yes
lt might be best to have a man
with experience
maybe someone whos spent time
in the foreign missions
l understand your excellency
lets see whos around
ln the meantime
lll call you as soon as l know
thank you your excellency
well he does know the background
l doubt theres any danger
in just having him assist
there should be
a psychiatrist present anyway
what about the exorcist
have you any ideas
how about lankester merrin
l had a notion he was in lraq
l read he was working
on a dig near nineveh
youre right but hes finished
he came back three or four months ago
hes at woodstock now
whats he doing there teaching
hes working on another book
dont you think hes too old tom
hows his health
he must be all right
hes still running around digging up tombs
besides hes had experience
l didnt know that
ten twelve years ago l think in africa
the exorcism supposedly lasted months
l heard it damn near killed him
father
youre mrs macneil
yes
lm father merrin
come in
thank you
ls father karras here
yes hes here already
lts an honor to meet you father
are you very tired
no
ld like you to go quickly
across to the residence
and gather up a cassock for myself
two surplices a purple stole
and some holy water
and
your copy of the roman ritual
the large one
l believe we should begin
do you want to hear the background
of the case first
why
especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon
we may ask what is relevant
but anything beyond that is dangerous
hes a liar the demon is a liar
he will lie to confuse us
but he will also mix lies with the truth
to attack us
the attack is psychological damien
and powerful
so dont listen remember that
do not listen
lt might be helpful
if l gave you some background
on the different personalities
regan has manifested
so far ld say there seem to be three
shes convinced that
there is only one
stick your cock up her ass
you motherfucking worthless cocksucker
be silent
our father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from the evil one
save me o god by thy name
by thy might defend my cause
proud men have risen up against me
and men of violence seek my life
but god is my helper
and the lord sustains my life
ln every need he has delivered me
glory be to the father
the son and the holy spirit
as it was in the beginning is now
and ever shall be world without end
save your servant
who places her trust in thee my god
be unto her o lord a fortified tower
ln the face of the enemy
let the enemy have no power over her
and the son of lniquity
be powerless to harm her
your mother sucks cocks in hell karras

the lord be with you
and also with you
let us pray
holy lord almighty father
everlasting god
and father of our lord jesus christ
who once and for all consigned
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell
who sent your only begotten son
into the world to crush that roaring lion
hasten to our call for help
and snatch from ruination
and from the clutches
of the noonday devil
this human being
made in your image and likeness
strike terror lord into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard
let your mighty hand cast him out
of your servant
regan theresa macneil
so he may no longer hold captive
this person
whom it pleased you
to make in your image
and to redeem through your son
who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the holy spirit
god forever and ever
amen
o lord hear my prayer
father karras
