phone line ringing
woman seq im in
seq captain
woman you were right
the skylight
was a window pane
seq ive got
serious interference
woman weird
its some kind of modal
seq looks like old code
woman it feels
really familiar
seq drop a pin
ill signal for backup
woman im gonna check it out
seq bugs
if the general finds out
weve been fishing
bugs a quick peek cant hurt
static
seq did you hear that
shit i think
our signal was traced
bugs this feels like a trap
bugs
suspenseful music playing
swat officer freeze
do not move
we will shoot
very slowly raise your hands
suspenseful music playing
lieutenant here we go
hey where are you going
you were warned lieutenant
i think we can handle
one little girl
youre wasting your time
my men are bringing her
down now
no lieutenant
your men are already dead
gasps slowly
seq you with me
this old code keeps crashing
your projections breaking up
switch to audio
seq bugs
this is a direct violation
of the generals protocols
i know i know
but something
is happening here
something important
bugs oh fuck
we know what happens next
she kicks their ass
all grunting
groans
now she makes a call
woman the line was traced
and then
then she runs for her life
woman are there any agents
we know this story
this is how it all began
god damn it
this is where he began
youre thinking this modal
is a loop or a treadmill
some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what
i dont know
but im going to find out
all right
dramatic music playing
grunts
panting
woman grunts
woman groaning
so deja vu and yet its
obviously all wrong
why use old code
to mirror something new
i dont know
all grunting
panting
if thats supposed
to be trinity
thats not what happens
maybe this isnt the story
we think it is
bugs you have
to get out of here
its gotta be a trap
helicopter whirring
shit
ominous music playing
bugs grunting
bugs growls
both grunting
bugs screaming
agent screaming
both grunting
bugs uh
you all carry on
as you were
im just gonna
see myself out
kill her
grunts
yells
sirens approaching
brakes screech
gasps
exclaims oh seq
tires screech
brakes screech
panting
gun cocks
bugs straining
dramatic music builds
why did you save me
you first
who are you
where did you come from
okay
my name is bugs
as in bunny
and tech that listens
do you know this is a modal
whats a modal
its a simulation
used to evolve programs
do you understand
that you are
digital sentience
i know what i am
just like i know my job
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients
like you
and yet
here we are
here we are
the other agents
dont know about this room
howd you find it
no one was ever
in the key shop
so i started looking
more you looked
the more you found
story of my life
what
i feel like i know this room
holy shit
this is his apartment
gasps
you mean thomas andersons
i searched everywhere
he doesnt exist
he stopped being thomas
a long time ago
but maybe you know him
by his real name
neo
you do
oh okay
uh
i cant believe this
after all these years
you see most people
think that neo is dead
but i know hes not
because ive seen him
where
its not something
i can explain easily but
but the moment
he looked at me
i felt something
unlock my mind
okay
something like that
happened to me
i saw this pattern
and it was everywhere
we cant see it
but were all trapped inside
these strange
repeating loops
somehow i saw it
in the mirror
just a flicker
but it was like you said
and suddenly i understood
this is not the real world
agent for the first time
i felt real purpose
i knew who i was
and what i had to do
who are you
what do you have to do
i am
morpheus
and i have to find neo
bugs gasping
morpheus
okay okay
oh my god
i have to get you out of here
i need to figure out
who built this modal
okay come with me
you have to be ready to leave
you have to be really ready
and if youre not
if you think that
this is where you belong
you call this a choice
oh honestly when somebody
offered me these things
i went off on binary
conceptions of the world
and said there was no way
i was swallowing
some symbolic reduction
of my life
and the woman
with the pills laughed
cause i was
missing the point
what point
the choice is an illusion
you already know
what you have to do
truth
okay
theres an old building
with a skylight
and lots of stairs
the lafayette
one of the four back doors
leads there
morpheus oh
dont fight it
whoa whats happening
keep breathing
extraction works
pretty much the same
for humans and programs
ouch
ah
okay
hey
hey
ive never worn
different glasses before
yeah looks good
which door
its gotta be
okay
agent white
agent smith
laughs
bugs grunts
bugs go
grunts
men grunting
seq can you hear me
bugs i thought i lost you

bugs bugs hes an agent
morpheus exclaims grunts

both screaming
screaming fades
keyboard clacking
fastpaced music
playing on speakers
computer buzzing
what the
what the hell
suspenseful music playing
something wrong
uh just a little crash
morning bobbi morning dude
what a beautiful day
to be alive am i right
problemo
he lost something
is this old matrix code
a little modal experiment
for binary
cell phone chimes
i need a coffee
coffee yes stat
im buying
man im not trying to blow
smoke up your ass
but the first time i played
the trilogy i was shook
the paradox
between free will and destiny
are we all just algorithms
doing what were
supposed to do
or can we escape
our programming
genius inside the context
of the game bt dubs
hey did i tell you
it took over my life
yeah i failed
the seventh grade chuckles
your game almost ruined me
so youve said
yet here we are
cups clink
you tell me mr anderson
is it free will
or destiny
oh yeah
there she is
total fing milf
daggers look im sorry
im a geek
i was raised by machines
maybe you should go
no please
i i promise best self
best self
sure
you ever talk to her
tell you what
for all youve done for me
let me do this for you
jude no stop
excuse me excuse me
thanks
hi um
i know this is all
a bit extemporaneous
im jude gallagher
i work for a game company
called deus machina
hi jude im tiffany
tiffany wow
didnt see that coming
mom loved audrey hepburn
jude
oh and this is my very
good friend thomas anderson
he is a bona fide
famous person
and considered by most to be
the greatest game designer
of our generation
im sorry about this
jude
softly just talk to her
hi thomas
everyone calls me tiff
hi
have we met
uh we both come here
can i have your morning bun
boy hey
are you trying
to ball my mom or what
brandon
chuckles
boy 2 can i have one bite
babe whats going on
were gonna be late
this is my husband chad
nice to meet you
hey
babe we gotta get
callie to practice
right sorry chuckles
come on kids lets move out
soft music playing
what
keyboard clacking
ominous music playing
sorry uh its the boss
billions of people
just living out their lives
oblivious
i always loved that line
you wrote that one yeah
every time i stand here
i mean omg
its so perfect
its gotta be fake
right
chuckles softly
yeah
sure
have a seat
man sighs
smoke
i thought you quit
i quit calling it a habit
now its just
a guilty pleasure
oh maybe i can make this
easy for you
i know binary is over budget
this is not about binary tom
its bigger than that
this is about our future
which is a sticky subject
given our past
what do you mean
hows the therapy
good
any
episodes
no
thats terrific
look tom i know weve
always had our differences
what did you say
about our first meeting
we had all the chemistry
of an fbi interrogation
muffled yell
scoffs
but look at this place
we did this
together
yeah
now what
things have changed
the markets tough
im sure you can understand
why our beloved
parent company warner bros
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy
what
they informed me theyre gonna
do it with or without us
i thought
they couldnt do that
exhales
oh they can
and they made it clear
theyll kill our contract
if we dont cooperate
really
i know you said the story
was over for you
but thats the thing
about stories
they never really end
do they
were still telling the same
stories weve always told
just with different names
different faces
and i have to say
im kind of excited
after all these years
to be going back
to where it all started
back to the matrix
ive spoken to marketing
sinister music playing
distorted voice
in normal voice tom
yeah
are you all right
exhales nervously
yeah
analyst what were you feeling
at that point
what was i feeling
i felt either im having
a mental breakdown again
or im living inside
a computergenerated reality
that has imprisoned me
again
laughs
chuckles softly
not much of a choice
no
maybe its not
as binary as that
maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened
yeah
thomas you are
a suicide survivor
gifted with
a powerful imagination
those facts have combined
to create dangerous fictions
in your life
yesterday
you walked into a meeting
with your business partner
and he ambushed you
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make
this attack effectively
took away your voice
his violence triggered you
and your mind fought back
you did to him
what he was doing to you
weve talked about the value
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma
far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown
i believe this episode
demonstrates healthy
selfprotection
and more importantly
i remember how hard
it was for you
to share something like this
which tells me
just how far weve come
chuckles softly
do you need a refill
on your prescription
sighs
yeah
pills rattle
mysterious music playing
grunts softly
first of all i know
i speak for everyone
when i say that
im so so excited
to be working on a game
that was such a
well game changer
now the packet
in front of you
has our focus group research
inside youll find
the breakdown
including keyword association
with the brand
the top two being
originality and fresh
which i think are great things
to keep in mind
as you begin
working on matrix 4
and who knows how many more
alarm buzzing stops
singing indistinctly
what made matrix different
it effed with your head
on point
people want us
up in their grey space
switching their synaptic
wtf light on
white rabbit playing
man laughing
what made matrix different
it effed with your head
people want us
up in their grey space
switching their synaptic
what the hell
is going on here light on
panting
shower running
i didnt love the first one
like some of you
and frankly
ive got zero tolerance
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter
i like my games big
loud and dumb
we need guns lots of guns
matrix means mayhem
grunting
mindless action
is not onbrand
man shes right
matrix is mindporn
philosophy in shiny
tight pvc
yeah
ideas are the new sexy
white rabbit
continues playing
obviously
the matrix is about
transpolitics
cryptofascism
its a metaphor
of capitalist exploitation
this cannot be another reboot
retread regurgitated
why not reboots sell
we are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole here people
you say matrix to anyone
you say matrix
echoing matrix
matrix matrix
this is what they see
mimics explosion
guns firing
bullets whizzing
clicks tongue
allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word
bullet time bullet time
thats two words
we need
a new bullet time echoing
laughs maniacally
we need to revolutionize
gaming again
revolutionize gaming
again echoing
white rabbit continues
barista afternoon tiff
the ushe
you know what skroce
im going wild
ill have a cortado today
fly that freak flag
mind if i get that
oh hi
hi
tiffany i remember
wanting a family
but was that because
thats what women
are supposed to want
how do you know
if you want something yourself
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it
mmm
i pay my analyst
a lot of money
to answer
such questions for me
smart
i should get more therapy
but honestly
im too goddamn tired
kids are exhausting you know
no never had kids
oh right i knew that
sorry i googled you
chuckles
so whats it like being
a worldfamous game designer
must be amazing
uh
a lot of hours
sometimes it is amazing
most times
i dont know
but you made the matrix
even ive heard of that
yeah we kept
some kids entertained
so worth it
chuckles
can i ask something
about your game
sure
did you base your
main character on yourself
there is a lot of me in him
indistinct shouting
maybe a little too much
can i ask you something else
please
theres a woman in your game
trinity
which is a weird
coincidence also right
god yeah
i like her
i like trinity
ah
and i dig her ducati
another coincidence
i love motorcycles
engine revs
my friend kush and i
actually build them
really
you have your analyst
i have my bikes
so i was looking at images
from your game at trinity
well i showed chad a scene
and i was like
so what do you think
he didnt get it until i said
dont you think
she looks like me
you know what he did
he laughed
and i laughed too
like it was a joke
how could it not be right
made me so angry
i hated myself for laughing
i wanted to kick him so hard
not too hard
maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off
chuckles
and right now
youre probably regretting
sitting down with me
this is the best thing
ive done in a long time
chuckles
cell phone ringing
gasps
i have to take this
hi this is tiff
oh god no
gasps
ill be right there
my uh youngest
stuck a lego up his nose
oh
i gotta go
i hope i see you again
alarm blaring

there has been a report

about the latest update
or theyre just a dick
please move to the exits

at last
all these years later
heres me
strolling out
of a toilet stall
tragedy or farce
i know you
not every day
you meet your maker
this cant be happening
oh most definitely is
you cant be
a character i coded
100 natural
gasps softly
how
all the explanation you need
oh
no
no no no
whoa whoa whoa
what do you mean no
you wanted this you did this
this was your idea
hesitating
it was a test an experiment
an experiment
you put me
in a tinyass modal
left me to bang my head till
i nearly lost my shit
searching for you
as an experiment
the exits breaking down
he hasnt taken the pill
what theres no time
i know i know
hes having a moment
does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror
tense music playing
still open
this this cant be real
swat officer target acquired
we got him
grunting
this isnt happening
its in my mind
its in my mind
swat officer 2 hey you

no
it cant be
ive missed you
cat meows
bell tinkling
its in my mind
its in my mind
cup clinking
analyst
can you hear me thomas
follow my voice
feel the tips of your fingers
what are they touching
bell tinkling
the bell
do you hear the bell
do you remember what happened
how you got here
you must have walked
i heard deja vu outside
opened my door
and there you were
thomas anderson exhales
you feel like
you can talk about it
when we started
working together
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality
from fiction
you came to me after
trying to jump off a building
you said you wanted
to fly away
indistinct chatter
people shouting
we have made
a lot of progress since then
but you seem particularly
triggered right now
can you tell me
how it started
he texted me
who
morpheus
ah
so hes back
it wasnt actually him
it was a program
i coded for a modal
and this modal morpheus
came to help you escape
from a virtual reality
called the matrix
am i crazy
we dont use that word
in here
what word should i use
what word explains
what is happening to me
can i see the texts
exhales
they were erased
if we got in my car
and drove to your office
what do you think
wed find there
nothing
because there was no attack
no one was killed
no one texted
my mind made it all up
is that what
im supposed to say
is that what you believe
it felt real
of course
it was your great ambition
to make a game
that was indistinguishable
from reality
to achieve this goal
you converted elements
of your life into narrative
your sublimated anger
toward your business partner
cast him as your nemesis
a married woman named tiffany
became the trinity
of a doomed romance
even your dislike of my cat
made it into your matrix
theres nothing wrong
with that
its what artists do
but it becomes a problem
when fantasies
endanger us or other people
we dont want anyone
to get hurt
do we thomas
hi thomas
everyone calls me tiff
who are you
my name is trinity
oracle no one can tell you
youre in love
you just know it
through and through
balls to bones
trinity whispers
you feel this
im never letting go
yells
both grunting
morpheus you have
to let it all go neo
free your mind
cell phone buzzing
buzzing stops
sighs
pigeon cooing
huh
looks easy enough
exhales
free my mind shit
suspenseful music playing
okay
free my mind
grunts
i fly
or i fall
suspenseful music builds
grunts
both grunting
who the hell are you
you wont remember me
but a long time ago
you changed my life
when you leapt off
another roof
back then i was just like
any other coppertop
pretending my life
until i looked up
and i saw you
it was a different you
but i saw
the real you
just a second before
you leapt
people shouting
and you never fell
are you the one
that hacked my modal
yeah
cell phone buzzing
thatll be jude
hes not your friend
hes a handle
a program used to control you
hes on his way here
and hes bringing
agents with him
jude
bro ive been calling you
all night
we have a major problemo
are you alone
thats kind
of a sexy question dude
bugs they dont look like
typical agents
they use bots now
skinned as normal people
which means theyre everywhere
and you never know
who to trust
why should i trust you
because if they open
that door we lose our hack
i will be caught and killed
and you will be put right back
on that treadmill
they designed for you
just like they did
the last time
you tried to leap
your way out
i know why you left
your modal open
you needed someone else
to free morpheus
and its because of him that
we were able to get to you
i know these things
the same way
that i knew one day
i would find you
and that when i did
you would be ready for this
if you want the truth neo
youre going
to have to follow me
okay
dramatic music playing
upbeat music playing
where are we
tokyo
a moving portal
makes it harder to track us
seq is the best of them
seq portals clean
reading our shadows
i dont remember this
we dont have to run to
phone booths anymore either
upbeat music playing
doors on your right
door opens
set and setting right
oh no
its all about set
and setting
after our first contact
went so badly
we thought elements
from your past
might help ease you
into the present
nothing comforts anxiety like
a little nostalgia
this is footage
from your game
morpheus time is
always against us
etcetera etcetera
no one can be told
what the matrix is
blah blah blah
you gotta see it
to believe it
time to fly
suspenseful music playing
wait
if this is real
if i havent lost my mind
does that mean
this happened
soft music playing
but if it did
then we died
obviously not
why the machines
kept you alive
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you
are questions
we dont have answers to
hide me
ive been at a company making
a game called the matrix
doesnt seem like they were
trying to hide anything
weve been tracking
that company for years
we screened every
thomas anderson we found
what we didnt understand
was that they could
alter your dsi
pods generate
your digital selfimage
through a feedback system
called semblance
this is how
you look to yourself
somehow they were able
to alter your dsi loop
this is how
everyone else sees you
suspenseful music playing
twenty years
why did it take 20 years
to find me
it took a lot longer
than that
its been over 60 years
since you and trinity
flew to one
of the machine cities
what
theres so much we dont know
like why youve barely aged
or how many times
theyve altered your dsi
morpheus but based on
what we do know
it appears no one found you
because you didnt
want to be found
thats not true
morpheus maybe it isnt
maybe theres no foundation
to the rumors
that you disappeared
because you were working
with the machines
from the beginning
morpheus stop
all im saying is
this is the moment
for you to show us
what is real
if you want out
youll take this pill
but if you are
where you belong
you can go back to this
every day
over and over forever
fuck
dramatic music playing
seq keep the loop tight
bugs cybebe needs
that tower pin
i got a signal its faint
its definitely offgrid
captain im tracking
a whole lot of weird
what
its some kind of graft
thomas
oh god
oh no
we got company
howd they find us
thomas none of this is real
you are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break
lexy
almost there
thomas
thomas please
this is not a game
feel my hand
this is what is real
stay with me
thomas anderson no no

meticulously maintained
but it doesnt look good
ekg beeping
were losing him
cold boot could shock him
do it
computer buzzing rapidly
groans
exhales
i remember this
the construct
in between everything
and nothing
welcome to the crib
ive been chilling here
in the ship network
learning all about you
tv static
and me
careful itll do your head in
are memories turned
into fiction any less real
is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction
as to my role in all this
my best guess
is that you wrote me
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces
that helped you become you
morpheus and agent smith
a combo pack
of counterprogramming
that was
inhales
lets just say more than
a little bit crazymaking
but it worked
because here we are
now for the bad news
your brain
is hooked on this shit
the matrix has been
forcefeeding you for years
hooked bad
youre going through
major withdrawals
docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving
but see
they dont know you like i do
i know exactly what you need
lively music playing
you gotta be kidding
uhuh
no joke
could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life
but if you want it
water splashing
you gotta fight for it
no im done fighting
are you
traditional battle
music playing
neo grunting
groans
gasps
grunts
music resumes
groaning
what the hell is he doing
oh yeah
they taught you good
neo grunting
made you believe their world
was all you deserved
but some part of you knew
that was a lie
some part of you remembered
what was real
you dont know me
no
both grunting
groans
ooh
yelling
panting
neo grunting
morpheus grunting
both grunting
i know you because i know
the only thing
that still matters to you
i know its why youre here
why youre still fighting
and why you will
never give up
both grunting
neo groaning
whimpering
ekg beeping
come on neo
this is it
this is your last chance
neo groaning
emotional music playing
groaning
you gotta fight
for your goddamn life
if you want to see
trinity again
neo groaning
come on neo fight for her
holy shit
fight for her
yelling
explosion
gasps
sighs
hey
hey
mind if i
how are you doing
if this plug is actually real
that means
they took my life
scoffs
and turned it
into a video game
how am i doing
i dont know
i dont even know how to know
thats it isnt it
if we dont know
whats real
we cant resist
they took your story
something that meant
so much to people like me
and turned it
into something trivial
thats what the matrix does
it weaponizes every idea
every dream
everything
thats important to us
where better to bury truth
than inside something
as ordinary as a video game
that sounds like the oracle
bugs chuckles
heard so much about her
she was gone
before i was free
gone
when this new version
of the matrix was uploaded
there was a purge
sighs
they promised peace
and they gave us purge
no
no there was peace
you made it possible
and it changed everything
doesnt feel like
it changed anything
the matrix is
the same or worse
and im back where i started
it feels like
everything i did
everything we did
both grunt
like none of it mattered
all of it mattered
i can show you
this is my crew
our operator seq
sequoia but everybody
calls me seq
nice to meet you
dad loved redwoods
when he escaped the matrix
and found out
they no longer existed
it almost killed him
lucky he met mom
and here i am
this is lexy
berg and ellster
hi
you knew my grandfather
captain roland
roland was your grandfather
he always laughed
joking how he never
believed in you
but in private he said that
you freed his mind
a second time
uh not to fanboy out here
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me
berg is our resident
neoologist
a what
theres a lot of people
out there like me
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life
i would never have recognized
your modal
if it werent for him
whenever
youre feeling up for it
ive got like
a million questions
me too starting with them
bugs its okay
come meet him
this is cybebe
thats octacles
thats lumin8
chittering
machines are on our side now
they are synthients
its a word
they prefer to machines
your contact
with the synthient city
had a huge impact
on their world
bugs thats what i meant
what you changed
that nobody believed
could ever be changed
the meaning of our side
cybebe warbling softly
cybebe and octacles
risked their lives
to help get you out
thank you
but why
morpheus
not all seek to control
just as not all
wish to be free
what is that
an exomorphicparticle codex
its pretty new
it gives programs
access to this world
within limits
limits are the domain
of the limited
morpheus
thank you
it was my honor
chuckles wow
crew chuckles
how does it work
paramagnetic oscillation
if you want
i can download
the codex manual for you
sure
downloading used to be fun
now its all manuals
and diagnostics
can i ask them something
when you unplugged me
there was another pod
warbling softly
yes weve analyzed the data
it could be trinity
its her
i figured we were going
to have this conversation
look you were not
a typical flushandgrab
you were in this weird tower
that cybebe
had never accessed
and shes now exiled
we burned
our one shot for you
even if it were trinity
and she wanted to be free
we have no idea how to do it
yet
nobody believed
wed ever find him
but we did
okay
we dont know
how to get her out yet
captain were approaching
security clearance
were here
zion
have a seat
this is hanno
best pilot in our fleet
quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me
control on radio
mnemosyne you are cleared
for landing welcome home
hanno thank you control
um were about to crash
dramatic music playing
chuckles
general realized we were
never going to beat
the sentinels so
we just got better
at hiding from them
welcome to io
io
sweeping music playing
wow that looks real
biosky
works kind of like
grow lights
its way more complex
than that
it pulls water from the crust
hydronating the air
it balances the eco
and our sri cycles
plus sighs
it is pretty to look at
as opposed to that
i guess the general sent us
a welcome party
god damn
it is you
niobe
a few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth
but wise enough to know
i dont know anything
i sure as shit
never saw this coming
neither did i
i told you he was alive
captain you and your crew
have been grounded
general
if youd just let me explain
the protocols are put in place
for everyones protection
im sorry
i saw an opportunity
and i was afraid
wed lose him
but general people have been
waiting for so long
we found the one
i dont believe in the one
i never did
no
me neither
but there was a time
when you trusted me
with your ship
against the councils orders
the world was different then
we were different
report to the docks
scrub down the mnemosyne
transfer your access codes
you are done captain
gasps softly
we need to talk
niobe when word first came
that it actually
might be you
i didnt know how i would feel
in this moment
it is nice to see you
its good to see you too
glasses clink
a long way
from dozers paint stripper
chuckles yes
a lot has changed
except maybe you
you remember this
its so easy to forget
how much noise
the matrix pumps
into your head
until you unplug
neo sighs
yeah
something else
makes the same kind of noise
takes over every damn thing
just like the matrix
war
i stood at the barricade
of the temple
staring
at the army of sentinels
waiting for them
to kill every one of us
but then they left
they said you saved us
i didnt believe it
every night i would dream
of attack sirens
but then
i would wake up to this
silence
im ashamed of it now
my pessimism of how long
it took me to believe
a world without war
was possible
you gave me that
you gave that gift to us all
and it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit
come help me get up
lets take a walk
mysterious music playing
elevator door opens
oh beautiful
this is freya head of botany
and this is quillion
our lead digitologist
i presume our guest
needs no introduction
nothing travels
faster than light
except gossip
freya chuckles
welcome to the garden neo
a strawberry
using digital code
from the matrix
we retroconvert it
into dna sequences
and they grow here
its not easy
augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize
biosky but
were getting there
chuckles
go ahead try it
niobe chuckles
were quite excited
about the blueberries
you remember that shit
we used to eat
that slop
that tasted like rust
zion could have never
made something like this
why
because we needed synthients
and di like him
zion was stuck in the past
stuck in war
stuck in a matrix of its own
they believed
that it had to be us or them
this city was built by us
and them
what happened to zion
ive been waiting
for you to ask that question
all of the troubles
started in the machine cities
power plants were unable
to produce enough energy
nothing can breed violence
like scarcity
for the first time
we saw machines at war
with one other
we got word from the oracle
of a new power rising
that was the last
we heard from her
morpheus
niobe after the siege
he was elected unanimously
high chair of the council
oh how he loved that scoffs
but as rumors
of this new power spread
he ignored them
he was certain what you had
done could not be undone
all of these people never
stopped believing in miracles
believing in you
im sorry
how could i know
this would happen
we didnt understand
all of it back then
no more than we do now
i didnt come here
to cause you problems niobe
but i need your help
trinity is alive
then there is
another question
why did they keep her alive
i cant answer that
but if theres a chance
i can free her
i have to try
even if it means endangering
everyone in this city
im sorry neo
i wont let what happened
to zion happen to io
i hope youll forgive
an old woman
for asking you to go
with sheperd here
till we have
better understanding
of whats going on
youre going to imprison me
after i just got free
i know it doesnt seem fair
but neither does growing old
but you dont
hear me complaining
elevator whirring
sorry
ive never met
a legend before
neo
sheperd breathes shakily
chuckles in disbelief
crazy youre real
real
theres that word again
sheperd people talk a lot
about the old days
about you the viral agent
the siege of zion
everything was simpler
back then
people wanted to be free
its different now
sometimes it feels like
people gave up
like the matrix won
unlocks door
this is you
and i gotta ask you one thing
is it true you could fly
cool
locks door
trickling
morpheus grunts
morpheus
oh general stuck you
in the rapunzel tower
morpheus exhales
on the upside
its a nice view
what happened to bugs
and the others
theyre supposed to be
sterilizing the mnemosyne
with a toothbrush
supposed to be
well i could tell you
that theyre standing by
waiting for you
to make the choice
to remain meekly incarcerated
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find trinity
but that aint a choice
dramatic music playing
sheperd general
what should we do
freya bugs has the same
independence of mind
she had the day you freed her
this is not
independence of mind
its mutiny
freya come on be
i know how much
you hated locking him up
just like i know
theres a part of you
thats relieved now
that hes gone
weve worked so hard
to keep io safe
this scares me
thats her
seq on the bridge
got her
engine revving
its sick
how the semblance works
you see flashes
of the real her but
the way she reads
codewise
shes pure bluepill
this is a tough question neo
but it has to be asked
what if shes happy
where she is
how did i read
exactly like her
take us to broadcast depth
suspenseful music playing
thank you for helping me
most of us are here
because of you
i also admit our only chance
to get out
of the generals doghouse
is for you to find your mojo
what if i cant be
what i once was
then were all fucked
signal beeps
hanno two minutes
two minutes to broadcast
seq i slipped you in
through a hotel room
seq chuckles
should be safe
portals open
closest i could get you is
the warehouse near her garage
whole zones
crawling with bots
lets go
so what do you think of him
i was kinda worried at first
because hes so much older
the beard the hair oh
no totally works for me
scoffs you idiot
i mean the one thing
you know everyone that
shipped with him died
oh yeah hes gonna
get us all killed for sure
guns cocking
predictable as ever
smith
smith as in the smith
chuckles
this is so insane
theres so many theories
about the two of them
and theyre standing
right there
this code is freaky
hes like an agent but not
an appeal to reason
how did you find us
you never appreciated
our relationship
not like the analyst
the what
my doctor
he used our bond
and turned it into a chain
its so obvious
once you see it right
but this whole alteredcode
update really blew my mind
i still dont know
how he did it
you as a balding nerd
hilarious
and me sighs
even more perfect
maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes
what do you think
what do you want smith
i have such dreams tom
big dreams
well mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies
but in order for me
to pursue mine
i need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours
hmm sounds like conflict
inevitable
doesnt have to be
all you have to do
is stay out of the matrix
and leave
the good doctor to me
you can have him
im here for trinity
thats the trouble tom
he knew youd come
just like i did
scoffs
trust me
youre not ready for him
captain im reading portals
from the lower frequencies
i wont have his leash
on my neck again
i found some
old acquaintances of yours
bugs
growling
ominous music playing
snarls
exiles
i thought
they were all purged
man you
excitedly oh
it is you
man speaking french
all these years
i cant believe it
oh god
you stole my life
speaking french
in english what the merv
is trying to say
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine
to have their lives back
yours has to end
bullet whizzing
kill him
tense music playing
blade slicing
all grunting
you ruined
every suckmysilkyass thing
we had grace
we had style
we had conversation
not this
mimics text message sound
all grunting
bone cracks
yells
art films
books were all better
originality mattered
you gave us
facezuckersuck
and cockmeclimatey
wikipissandshit
screams
screaming
ominous music builds
man groans
i still know kung fu
neo
smith yells
both grunting
just like old times
tense music playing
neo groaning
woman shrieks
man yelling
neo
ive been thinking
about us tom
look how binary is the form
the nature of things
ones and zeros
grunting
light and dark
choice and its absence
smith grunts
anderson and smith
dramatic music playing
gasps
youve lost something tom
youre not
what you used to be
its true
grunts
jaw cracks
nice one
thanks
come on neo
neo groaning
panting
gasps
captain you okay
yeah wheres neo
smith is killing him
bugs where
neo groaning
i feel bad about this tom
after all you are the one
who set me free
again
so you more than anyone
understands why
i cant go back
grunts
you should have
listened to me
now youll never
see her again
grunts
yells
energy explodes
what was that
that was neo
mojo rising
lumin8 chittering
seq exclaims
bugs you all right
yeah
its gonna trigger a response
i got multiple exits ready
the merovingian
this is not over yet
our sequel franchise spinoff
speaking french
spits
bugs we should go
i cant
i have to talk to her
neo those exiles
were older than you
and we barely handled them
sighs
you really wanna do this now
i mean
you look like shit
buzzing
oh my god what
what happened
an accident
tiffany kush call a doctor
its fine
i dont have a lot of time
i wasnt sure
id see you again
after we spoke i realized
my life wasnt a life
at some point
i think i gave up
searching for something real
wait
something happened
i looked for you
at the coffee shop
i began to wonder
if i imagined you
and then last night
i had a dream
in the dream you were
surrounded by police
then they started chasing us
us
you were on my bike with me
how did it end
not good
ive had dreams
that werent just dreams
you mean a dream
that came true
bell tinkling
suspenseful music playing
finally we can talk
like adults
i hate lying i do
it exhausts me
tiff and i have been
waiting for you
like forever
distorted rewinding
deja vu right
oh no use
you cant beat time
this rewind is happening
faster than you can blink
you gave me the idea
allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word
bullet time
grunts in slow motion
i know kind of ironic
using the power that defined
you to control you chuckles
i kept such a close eye on you
and still you found a way out
clever monkey
using that modal
call me an optimist
but this could
all be for the best
the skins not looking
too bad this time
i know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear
after everything
you went through
all that pain and suffering
only to learn the world
doesnt end when you do
surprise
neo grunts
i was there when you died
neo screaming
i said to myself
here is the anomaly
of anomalies
what an extraordinary
opportunity
first i had to convince
the suits
to let me rebuild
the two of you
why her getting there
and dont worry
she cant hear me
resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive
like renovating a house
took twice as long
cost twice as much
gasps
i thought youd be happy
to be alive again
so wrong
machine whirring
screaming
did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code
screaming
we worked for years
trying to activate
your source code
i was about to give up
when i realized
trinity
it was never just you
alone neither of you
is of any particular value
trinity screaming
like acids and bases
youre dangerous
when mixed together
every sim
where you two bonded
lets just say
bad things happened
neo
however as long as i managed
to keep you close
but not too close
i discovered
something incredible
now my predecessor
loved precision
his matrix was all fussy facts
and equations
he hated the human mind
so he never bothered
to realize
that you dont give a shit
about facts
its all about fiction
the only world that matters
is the one in here
and you people
believe the craziest shit
why
what validates
and makes your fictions real
feelings
allow me
kush here
is one of my handlers
theyre everywhere
such a pain cloning agents
over a coppertop
far more effective
just to saturate a population
and bonus
swarm mode is sick fun
chuckles
gun fires in slow motion
ooh nicely done
you ever wonder
why you have nightmares
why your own brain
tortures you
its actually us
maximizing your output
it works just like this
oh no
can you stop the bullet
if only you could move faster
chuckles heres the thing
about feelings
theyre so much easier
to control than facts
turns out in my matrix
the worse we treat you
the more we manipulate you
the more energy you produce
its nuts chomps
ive been setting
productivity records
every year since i took over
and the best part
zero resistance
people stay in their pods
happier than pigs in shit
the key to it all
you
and her
quietly yearning
for what you dont have
while dreading
losing what you do
for 999 of your race
that is the definition
of reality
desire and fear baby
just give the people
what they want right
squelches
shes the only home
you have thomas
come home before
something terrible happens
tense music playing
neo grunts
keyboard clacking
bugs
i hear him
sirens approaching
tires screech
trinity
you shouldnt call me that
im sorry
i have to go
but ill be back
neo time to go
gasps
alarm blaring
sentinels
worse
sheperd on radio
general ordered me
to look after the ship
so you shadowed us
check your longrange scans
squids are combing this area
hes right
you can stay here and die
or come back
and face a courtmartial
and you call that a choice
niobe sheperd should have
left you to the squids
im too damn old to sit
through some boringass trial
niobe dont blame bugs
do shut your mouth
do address me as general
and do not rob
my excaptain of her agency
which she exercised
with her own
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity
shortsighted
you care more about growing
fruit than freeing minds
we are not going
to have this argument again
its not an argument
its a fact
you gave up on people
i tell you
what im going to give up on
and its you
sheperd get her
out of my sight
general
disarm
kujakus a friend
kujaku warbling
hello friend
chittering softly
okay
him
general
thank you for seeing me
i figured if there was anyone
who could make sense
of this mess
it would be you
hello neo
i know you
i tried to keep my eye on you
clicks tongue
why
we met a long time ago
good morning
sati
my father knew
wed meet again
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances
his inadvertent role
in what happened to you
was the greatest regret
of his life
i dont understand
my father
was the chief engineer
at the anomaleum
niobe the what
my father designed
the resurrection pods
where neo and trinity
were imprisoned
niobe im sorry
you knew what happened to him
you knew that he and trinity
both were alive
and you didnt tell me
there were times
i doubted my decision niobe
but io needed you
this city needed to be built
for your people
as well as mine
if i would have
told you everything
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make
my friends
let me make my own choices
if it was a mistake
you have my deepest apologies
why are you here now
neos escape has
destabilized the matrix
the anomaleum
draws its current
from trinity alone now
a failsafe has been
triggered to reset
the matrix back
to the previous version
but the analyst
halted the reset
hes convinced the authorities
that you will soon
return voluntarily
and why would he say that
because if i dont go back
hell kill trinity
faced with returning
to your pod
or enduring
trinitys death again
what would you choose neo
ill go back
well the analyst
knows you well
but that knowledge
has made him incautious
after you escaped
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated trinity
but that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity
that now exists before us
a few hours ago
no one would have been able
to convince me
that i would be standing here
trying to explain a mission
as crazy as this one
what are you doing
volunteering
oh no
you are the one captain
that i am ordering to go
now you dont
have to order me general
cause im volunteering
i need two more
are you out of your minds
you dont even know
what it is
general we know you
if you say this is important
none of us is
choosing to stay home
thank you
knuckle up and good luck
dramatic music playing
kujaku chittering
sati trinity is held
in the anomaleum
which is in this
transmission tower
the passages used
to rescue neo are now sealed
and a legion of sentinels
patrols the tower
so stealth will be paramount
as long as we raise no alarms
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest
you mean
crossing the fetus fields
sneaking across
an entire power plant
climbing
a twokilometer tower
guarded by thousands
of sentinels
thats the easy part
exactly so
because all we have to do
is convince someone
who does this every day
to take one of us along
electricity crackling
dramatic music continues
fifty meters
below the anomaleum
is a stratum
of amniotic filters
hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent
this vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier
which oxygenates
the biogel used in neos pod
i get it
the exomorph slinkies up
neos old umbilicus
what could go wrong
tense music playing
grunts
straining
sati once inside
morpheus will use
the system operator
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators
machinery clanking
in order to unplug
trinitys body
while her mind still remains
connected to the matrix
im gonna need
a second human brain
to implement the bypass
and since neo
must be with the analyst
the only available mind
thats a nearenough match
is yours
figures
tense music playing
thanks cybebe
grunts
does trinity still have
to take the red pill
since kujaku and i
are transferring
her consciousness
onto the ship
its not strictly necessary
but what matters is that
this is her choice
extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will
in all probability kill her
but even if it is
what she wants
wont the analyst just order
the sentinels to stop you
he will
but if my plan works
it wont matter
why
because well already be gone
somebody thinks
this hard about a plan
there has to be a reason why
when my father realized
how the anomaleum
was going to be used
he covertly transferred
the designs to me
the analyst
discovered his betrayal
and had my parents purged
inhales sharply
i would have been murdered too
if it wasnt for kujaku
not a day goes by
that i dont grieve them
ive been praying for this day
for a very long time
door unlocks opens
were coming up on broadcast
i thought you should know
that im here because of her
all i ever wanted was to be
as fearless as trinity
but i saw how she reacted
in the garage and i
youre wondering if im wrong
what if were too late
what if shes not
trinity anymore
sighs
i never believed
i was the one
but she did
she believed in me
its my turn
to believe in her
sighs
suspenseful music playing
sati this is
where it gets tricky
have you ever done
an operation like this
not yet
suspenseful music builds
here we go
suspenseful music continues
welcome home
all i want is to talk to her
do you mean tiff
come back and you can talk
to her as often as you like
i mean handsome chad
may have something
to say about it
if she tells me
this is what she wants
you win
really
but if she wants me
then youll let us go free
and why would i do something
as stupid as that
right now im on a ship full
of people who will unplug me
before theyll let you
take me back
if you want this matrix
this is your only chance
but how do i know
they wont unplug you anyway
same way i know youll let us
walk out of here
suspenseful music playing
okay
i like tests
well let tiff decide
electricity crackling
sati breathing heavily
thats it
bypass is ready
now what
we wait
doesnt it seem crazy
to come all this way
and leave her here
we must abide by her decision
and if she says no
what happens to neo
at this time
the most important choice
of neos life
is not his to make
slow suspenseful
music playing
i saw this in my dream
if i was the oracle
maybe i could explain it
the oracle
from your game
its not a game
oh god
tiffany sighs
after you left i went home
and i played it
i kept thinking
why does this story
feel like a memory
theres a part of me
that feels like i have been
waiting my whole life for you
and that part is like
what the hell
took you so long sniffles
i dont have an easy answer
maybe i was afraid of this
afraid of what might happen
afraid of hurting
the only person i ever loved
i wish i was
who you think i am
but look at me
i cant be her
donnie mom
brandon mom come on
mom
its callie
is this real
donnie
you have to come with us
brandon come on

gulps
okay ow
if you hated the name so much
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long
trinity grunts
blade slices
body thuds
yeah definitely asked
for that
snaps fingers
the analyst groaning
shudders
cant you control her
groaning
that was for using children
we have a few questions
you tried to activate
the failsafe
the suits tried
obviously without control
of your source code
i knew that was impossible
so why havent
the suits purged you
because i know the system
i know human beings
and i know you
bones crack sighs
right now youre feeling good
about what youve done
you should
it was a victory bravo
now what
youve come here to negotiate
some kind of deal
you think you hold
all the cards
because you can do whatever
you want in this world
i say go for it
remake it
knock yourselves out
paint the sky with rainbows
but heres the thing
the sheeple arent
going anywhere
they like my world
they dont want
this sentimentality
they dont want
freedom or empowerment
they want to be controlled
they crave
the comfort of certainty
and that means you two
back in your pods
unconscious and alone
just like them
both chuckle
were not here
to negotiate anything
we were on our way
to remake your world
change a few things
i kind of like
the paint the sky
with rainbows idea
just remind people
what a free mind can do
i forgot its easy to forget
he makes it easy
that he does
something he should
think about
before we got started
we decided to stop by
to say thank you
you gave us something
we never thought we could have
and what is that
another chance
punk rock music playing
face reality people
movies are dead
games are dead
narrative dead
media is nothing
but neurotrigger response
and viral conditioning
wait what are you two
talking about
