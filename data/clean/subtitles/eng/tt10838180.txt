 phone line ringing 
   woman  seq  i m in 
   seq  captain 
 woman  you were right 
the skylight
was a window pane 
 seq  i ve got
serious interference 
 woman  weird 
it s some kind of modal 
 seq  looks like old code 
 woman  it feels
really familiar 
 seq  drop a pin 
i ll signal for backup 
   woman  i m gonna check it out 
   seq  bugs 
if the general finds out
we ve been fishing   
 bugs  a quick peek can t hurt 
   static 
   seq  did you hear that 
shit  i think
our signal was traced 
bugs  this feels like a trap 
bugs 
 suspenseful music playing 
 swat officer  freeze 
do not move 
we will shoot 
very slowly  raise your hands 
 suspenseful music playing 
 lieutenant  here we go 
hey  where are you going 
you were warned  lieutenant 
i think we can handle
one little girl 
you re wasting your time 
my men are bringing her
down now 
no  lieutenant 
your men are already dead 
 gasps slowly 
seq  you with me 
this old code keeps crashing 
your projection s breaking up 
switch to audio 
 seq  bugs 
this is a direct violation
of the general s protocols 
i know  i know 
but something
is happening here 
something important 
 bugs  oh  fuck 
we know what happens next 
she kicks their ass 
 all grunting 
 groans 
now she makes a call 
 woman  the line was traced 
  and then   
  then she runs for her life 
 woman  are there any agents 
we know this story 
this is how it all began 
god damn it 
this is where he began 
you re thinking this modal
is a loop  or a treadmill 
some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what 
i don t know 
but i m going to find out 
all right 
 dramatic music playing 
 grunts 
 panting 
 woman grunts 
 woman groaning 
so deja vu and yet it s
obviously all wrong 
why use old code
to mirror something new 
i don t know 
 all grunting 
 panting 
if that s supposed
to be trinity 
that s not what happens 
maybe this isn t the story
we think it is 
bugs  you have
to get out of here 
  it s gotta be a trap 
   helicopter whirring 
shit 
 ominous music playing 
 bugs grunting 
 bugs growls 
 both grunting 
 bugs screaming 
 agent screaming 
 both grunting 
 bugs  uh   
you all carry on 
as you were 
i m just gonna   
see myself out 
kill her 
 grunts 
 yells 
 sirens approaching 
 brakes screech 
 gasps 
 exclaims  oh  seq 
 tires screech 
 brakes screech 
 panting 
 gun cocks 
 bugs straining 
 dramatic music builds 
  why did you save me 
  you first 
who are you 
where did you come from 
okay 
my name is bugs 
as in  bunny  
and tech that listens 
do you know this is a modal 
what s a modal 
it s a simulation
used to evolve programs 
do you understand
that you are   
digital sentience 
i know what i am 
just like i know my job
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients 
like you 
and yet   
here we are 
here we are 
the other agents
don t know about this room 
how d you find it 
no one was ever
in the key shop 
so i started looking 
more you looked 
the more you found 
story of my life 
what 
i feel like i know this room 
holy shit 
this is his apartment 
 gasps 
you mean thomas anderson s 
i searched everywhere 
he doesn t exist 
he stopped being thomas
a long time ago 
but maybe you know him
by his real name 
neo 
you do 
oh  okay 
uh   
i can t believe this 
after all these years 
you see  most people
think that neo is dead 
but i know he s not 
because i ve seen him 
where 
it s not something
i can explain easily  but   
but the moment
he looked at me 
i felt something   
unlock my mind 
okay 
something like that
happened to me 
i saw this pattern   
and it was everywhere 
we can t see it 
but we re all trapped inside
these strange 
repeating loops 
somehow i saw it
in the mirror 
just a flicker 
but it was like you said 
and suddenly i understood 
this is not the real world 
 agent  for the first time 
i felt real purpose 
i knew who i was
and what i had to do 
who are you 
what do you have to do 
i am   
morpheus 
and i have to find neo 
 bugs gasping 
morpheus 
okay  okay 
oh  my god 
i have to get you out of here 
i need to figure out
who built this modal 
okay  come with me 
you have to be ready to leave 
you have to be really ready 
and if you re not 
if you think that
this is where you belong   
you call this a choice 
oh  honestly  when somebody
offered me these things 
i went off on binary
conceptions of the world
and said there was no way
i was swallowing
some symbolic reduction
of my life 
and the woman
with the pills laughed
 cause i was
missing the point 
what point 
the choice is an illusion 
you already know
what you have to do 
truth 
okay 
there s an old building
with a skylight
and lots of stairs 
the lafayette 
one of the four back doors
leads there 
 morpheus  oh 
  don t fight it 
  whoa  what s happening 
keep breathing 
extraction works
pretty much the same
for humans and programs 
ouch 
ah 
okay 
  hey 
  hey 
i ve never worn
different glasses before 
yeah  looks good 
which door 
  it s gotta be   
  okay 
agent white 
agent smith 
 laughs 
 bugs grunts 
   bugs  go 
   grunts 
 men grunting 
seq  can you hear me 
bugs  i thought i lost you 
can you get us
to the window pane 
bugs  bugs  he s an agent 
 morpheus exclaims  grunts 
that window  go hard 
 both screaming 
 screaming fades 
 keyboard clacking 
 fast paced music
playing on speakers 
   computer buzzing 
  what the   
what the hell 
 suspenseful music playing 
something wrong 
uh    just a little crash 
morning  bobbi  morning  dude 
what a beautiful day
to be alive  am i right 
  problemo 
  he lost something 
is this old matrix code 
a little modal experiment 
  for binary 
   cell phone chimes 
  i need a coffee 
  coffee  yes  stat 
i m buying 
 man  i m not trying to blow
smoke up your ass 
but the first time i played
the trilogy  i was shook 
the paradox
between free will and destiny 
are we all just algorithms
doing what we re
supposed to do
or can we escape
our programming 
genius  inside the context
of the game  bt dubs 
hey  did i tell you
it took over my life 
yeah  i failed
the seventh grade   chuckles 
your game almost ruined me 
  so you ve said 
  yet here we are 
   cups clink 
  you tell me  mr  anderson 
is it free will
or destiny 
oh  yeah 
there she is 
total f ing milf 
daggers  look  i m sorry 
i m a geek 
i was raised by machines 
maybe you should go 
no  please 
i    i promise  best self 
best self 
sure 
you ever talk to her 
tell you what 
for all you ve done for me 
let me do this for you 
jude  no  stop 
  excuse me  excuse me 
  thanks 
hi  um   
i know this is all
a bit extemporaneous 
i m jude gallagher 
i work for a game company
called deus machina 
hi  jude  i m tiffany 
tiffany  wow 
didn t see that coming 
  mom loved audrey hepburn 
  jude 
oh  and this is my very
good friend  thomas anderson 
he is a bona fide
famous person
and considered by most to be
the greatest game designer
of our generation 
i m sorry about this 
  jude   
   softly  just talk to her 
hi  thomas 
everyone calls me  tiff  
hi 
have we met 
uh  we both come here 
  can i have your morning bun 
   boy  hey 
are you trying
to ball my mom or what 
  brandon 
   chuckles 
 boy 2  can i have one bite 
babe  what s going on 
we re gonna be late 
this is my husband  chad 
  nice to meet you 
  hey 
babe  we gotta get
callie to practice 
right  sorry   chuckles 
come on  kids  let s move out 
 soft music playing 
what 
 keyboard clacking 
 ominous music playing 
sorry  uh  it s the boss 
 billions of people
just living out their lives   
oblivious  
i always loved that line 
you wrote that one  yeah 
every time i stand here 
i mean  o m g 
it s so perfect 
it s gotta be fake 
  right 
   chuckles softly 
yeah 
sure 
have a seat 
 man sighs 
smoke 
i thought you quit 
i quit calling it a habit 
now it s just
a guilty pleasure 
oh  maybe i can make this
easy for you 
i know binary is over budget 
this is not about binary  tom 
it s bigger than that 
this is about our future 
which is a sticky subject 
given our past 
what do you mean 
how s the therapy 
good 
any   
episodes 
no 
that s terrific 
look  tom  i know we ve
always had our differences 
what did you say
about our first meeting 
we had all the chemistry
of an fbi interrogation 
 muffled yell 
 scoffs 
but look at this place 
we did this 
together 
yeah 
now what 
things have changed 
the market s tough 
i m sure you can understand
why our beloved
parent company  warner bros  
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy 
what 
they informed me they re gonna
do it with or without us 
i thought
they couldn t do that 
 exhales 
oh  they can 
and they made it clear
they ll kill our contract
if we don t cooperate 
really 
i know you said the story
was over for you 
but that s the thing
about stories 
they never really end 
do they 
we re still telling the same
stories we ve always told 
just with different names 
different faces
and i have to say
i m kind of excited 
after all these years 
to be going back
to where it all started 
back to the matrix 
i ve spoken to marketing   
   sinister music playing 
   distorted voice 
 in normal voice  tom 
yeah 
are you all right 
 exhales nervously 
yeah 
 analyst  what were you feeling
at that point 
what was i feeling 
i felt either i m having
a mental breakdown again
or i m living inside
a computer generated reality
that has imprisoned me   
again 
 laughs 
 chuckles softly 
not much of a choice 
no 
maybe it s not
as binary as that 
maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened 
yeah 
thomas  you are
a suicide survivor
gifted with
a powerful imagination 
those facts have combined
to create dangerous fictions
in your life 
yesterday 
you walked into a meeting
with your business partner
and he ambushed you 
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make 
this attack effectively
took away your voice 
his violence triggered you
and your mind fought back 
you did to him
what he was doing to you 
we ve talked about the value
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma 
far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown 
i believe this episode
demonstrates healthy
self protection 
and more importantly 
i remember how hard
it was for you
to share something like this 
which tells me
just how far we ve come 
 chuckles softly 
do you need a refill
on your prescription 
 sighs 
yeah 
 pills rattle 
 mysterious music playing 
 grunts softly 
first of all  i know
i speak for everyone
when i say that
i m so  so excited
to be working on a game
that was such a   
well  game changer 
now  the packet
in front of you
has our focus group research 
inside  you ll find
the breakdown
including keyword association
with the brand 
the top two being
 originality  and  fresh  
which i think are great things
to keep in mind
as you begin
working on matrix 4 
and who knows how many more 
 alarm buzzing  stops 
 singing indistinctly 
what made matrix different 
it effed with your head 
on point 
people want us
up in their grey space 
switching their synaptic
 wtf  light on 
  white rabbit  playing 
 man laughing 
what made matrix different 
it effed with your head 
people want us
up in their grey space 
switching their synaptic
 what the hell
is going on here   light on 
 panting 
 shower running 
i didn t love the first one 
like some of you 
and  frankly 
i ve got zero tolerance
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter 
i like my games big 
loud and dumb 
we need guns  lots of guns 
matrix means mayhem 
 grunting 
mindless action
is not on brand 
 man  she s right 
matrix is mind porn 
philosophy in shiny   
  tight pvc 
  yeah 
ideas are the new  sexy  
  white rabbit 
continues playing 
obviously
the matrix is about   
     trans politics 
  crypto fascism 
it s a metaphor   
   of capitalist exploitation 
this cannot be another reboot 
retread  regurgitated   
why not  reboots sell 
we are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole  here  people 
you say matrix to anyone   
you say matrix   
 echoing  matrix   
matrix    matrix   
   this is what they see 
 mimics explosion 
   guns firing 
   bullets whizzing 
 clicks tongue 
allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word 
bullet time  bullet time 
that s two words 
we need
a new  bullet time    echoing 
 laughs maniacally 
we need to revolutionize
gaming again 
revolutionize gaming

 barista  afternoon  tiff 
the ushe 
you know what  skroce 
i m going wild 
i ll have a cortado today 
fly that freak flag 
mind if i get that 
oh  hi 
hi 
 tiffany  i remember
wanting a family 
but was that because
that s what women
are supposed to want 
how do you know
if you want something yourself
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it 
mmm 
i pay my analyst
a lot of money
to answer
such questions for me 
smart 
i should get more therapy
but honestly 
i m too goddamn tired 
kids are exhausting  you know 
no  never had kids 
oh  right  i knew that 
  sorry  i googled you 
   chuckles 
so  what s it like being
a world famous game designer 
  must be amazing 
  uh   
a lot of hours 
sometimes it is amazing 
most times   
i don t know 
but you made the matrix 
even i ve heard of that 
yeah  we kept
some kids entertained 
  so  worth it 
   chuckles 
can i ask something
about your game 
sure 
did you base your
main character on yourself 
there is a lot of me in him 
 indistinct shouting 
maybe a little too much 
can i ask you something else 
please 
there s a woman in your game 
trinity 
which is a weird
coincidence also  right 
god  yeah 
i like her 
  i like trinity 
  ah 
and i dig her ducati 
another coincidence 
i love motorcycles 
 engine revs 
my friend kush and i
actually build them 
really 
you have your analyst 
i have my bikes 
so  i was looking at images
from your game  at trinity 
well  i showed chad a scene 
and i was like 
 so  what do you think  
he didn t get it until i said 
 don t you think
she looks like me  
you know what he did 
he laughed 
and i laughed too 
like it was a joke 
how could it not be  right 
made me so angry 
i hated myself for laughing 
i wanted to kick him so hard 
not too hard 
maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off 
 chuckles 
and right now 
you re probably regretting
sitting down with me 
this is the best thing
i ve done in a long time 
 chuckles 
   cell phone ringing 
   gasps 
i have to take this 
hi  this is tiff 
oh  god  no 
 gasps 
i ll be right there 
my  uh  youngest
stuck a lego up his nose 
oh 
i gotta go 
i hope i see you again 
 alarm blaring 
 announcer on speaker 
there has been a report
of an emergency 
proceed calmly
to the nearest exit
and leave the building
immediately 
what s going on 
we probably just got swatted
by some 14 year old 
yeah  someone pissed
about the latest update 
or they re just a dick 
please move to the exits

at last 
all these years later 
here s me 
strolling out
of a toilet stall 
tragedy or farce 
i know you 
not every day
you meet your maker 
this can t be happening 
oh  most definitely is 
you can t be
a character i coded 
100  natural 
 gasps softly 
how 
all the explanation you need 
oh 
no 
no  no  no 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
what do you mean   no  
you wanted this  you did this 
this was your idea 
 hesitating 
it was a test  an experiment 
an experiment 
you put me
in a tiny ass modal 
left me to bang my head till
i nearly lost my shit
searching for you
as an experiment 
  the exit s breaking down 
  he hasn t taken the pill 
what  there s no time 
i know  i know 
he s having a moment 
does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror

still open 
this    this can t be real 
 swat officer  target acquired 
we got him

this isn t happening 
it s in my mind 
it s in my mind

it s in my mind 
 cup clinking 
 analyst 
can you hear me  thomas 
follow my voice 
feel the tips of your fingers 
what are they touching 
 bell tinkling 
the bell 
do you hear the bell 
do you remember what happened 
how you got here 
you must have walked 
i heard deja vu outside 
opened my door 
and there you were 
 thomas anderson exhales 
you feel like
you can talk about it 
when we started
working together 
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality
from fiction 
you came to me after
trying to jump off a building 
you said you wanted
to fly away 
 indistinct chatter 
 people shouting 
we have made
a lot of progress since then 
but you seem particularly
triggered right now 
can you tell me
how it started 
he texted me 
who 
morpheus 
ah 
so  he s back 
it wasn t actually him 
it was a program
i coded for a modal 
and this  modal   morpheus 
came to help you escape
from a virtual reality
called the matrix 
am i crazy 
we don t use that word
in here 
what word should i use 
what word explains
what is happening to me 
can i see the texts 
 exhales 
they were erased 
if we got in my car
and drove to your office 
what do you think
we d find there 
nothing 
because there was no attack 
no one was killed 
no one texted 
my mind made it all up 
is that what
i m supposed to say 
is that what you believe 
it felt real 
of course 
it was your great ambition
to make a game
that was indistinguishable
from reality 
to achieve this goal 
you converted elements
of your life into narrative 
your sublimated anger
toward your business partner
cast him as your nemesis 
a married woman named tiffany
became the  trinity 
of a doomed romance 
even your dislike of my cat
made it into your matrix 
there s nothing wrong
with that 
it s what artists do 
but it becomes a problem
when fantasies
endanger us or other people 
we don t want anyone
to get hurt 
do we  thomas 
hi  thomas 
everyone calls me  tiff  
  who are you 
  my name is trinity 
 oracle  no one can tell you
you re in love 
you just know it 
through and through 
balls to bones 
 trinity whispers 
you feel this 
i m never letting go 
 yells 
 both grunting 
 morpheus  you have
to let it all go  neo 
free your mind 
 cell phone buzzing 
   buzzing stops 
   sighs 
 pigeon cooing 
huh 
looks easy enough 
 exhales 
 free my mind   shit 
 suspenseful music playing 
okay 
free my mind 
 grunts 
i fly   
or i fall 
 suspenseful music builds 
 grunts 
 both grunting 
who the hell are you 
you won t remember me 
but a long time ago 
you changed my life
when you leapt off
another roof 
back then  i was just like
any other coppertop 
pretending my life   
until i looked up
and i saw you 
it was a different you 
but i saw
the real you 
just a second before   
you leapt 
 people shouting 
and you never fell 
are you the one
that hacked my modal 
yeah 
 cell phone buzzing 
that ll be jude 
he s not your friend 
he s a handle 
a program used to control you 
he s on his way here 
and he s bringing
agents with him 
jude 
bro  i ve been calling you
all night 
we have a major problemo 
are you alone 
that s kind
of a sexy question  dude 
 bugs  they don t look like
typical agents 
they use bots now 
skinned as normal people 
which means they re everywhere
and you never know
who to trust 
why should i trust you 
because if they open
that door  we lose our hack 
i will be caught and killed
and you will be put right back
on that treadmill
they designed for you 
just like they did
the last time
you tried to leap
your way out 
i know why you left
your modal open 
you needed someone else
to free morpheus 
and it s because of him that
we were able to get to you 
i know these things
the same way
that i knew one day
i would find you 
and that when i did 
you would be ready for this 
if you want the truth  neo 
you re going
to have to follow me 
okay 
 dramatic music playing 
 upbeat music playing 
  where are we 
  tokyo 
a moving portal
makes it harder to track us 
  seq is the best of them 
   seq  portal s clean

i don t remember this 
we don t have to run to
phone booths anymore  either 
 upbeat music playing 
door s on your right 
 door opens 
set and setting  right 
oh  no 
it s all about set
and setting 
after our first contact
went so badly 
we thought elements
from your past
might help ease you
into the present 
nothing comforts anxiety like
a little nostalgia 
this is footage
from your game 
 morpheus  time is
always against us 
etcetera  etcetera 
no one can be told
what the matrix is 
blah  blah  blah 
you gotta see it
to believe it 
time to fly 
 suspenseful music playing 
wait 
if this is real 
if i haven t lost my mind 
does that mean
this happened 
 soft music playing 
but if it did   
then we died 
obviously not 
why the machines
kept you alive
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you
are questions
we don t have answers to 
hide me 
i ve been at a company making
a game called the matrix 
doesn t seem like they were
trying to hide anything 
we ve been tracking
that company for years 
we screened every
thomas anderson we found 
what we didn t understand
was that they could
alter your dsi 
pods generate
your digital self image
through a feedback system
called semblance 
this is how
you look to yourself 
somehow they were able
to alter your dsi loop 
this is how
everyone else sees you 
 suspenseful music playing 
twenty years 
why did it take 20 years
to find me 
it took a lot longer
than that 
it s been over 60 years
since you and trinity
flew to one
of the machine cities 
what 
there s so much we don t know 
like why you ve barely aged 
or how many times
they ve altered your dsi 
 morpheus  but based on
what we do know 
it appears no one found you
because you didn t
want to be found 
  that s not true 
   morpheus  maybe it isn t 
maybe there s no foundation
to the rumors
that you disappeared 
because you were working
with the machines
from the beginning 
morpheus  stop 
all i m saying is
this is the moment
for you to show us
what is real 
if you want out 
you ll take this pill 
but if you are
where you belong 
you can go back to this 
every day 
over and over forever 
fuck 
 dramatic music playing 
 seq  keep the loop tight 
 bugs  cybebe needs
that tower pin 
i got a signal  it s faint 
it s definitely off grid

  it s some kind of graft

oh  god 
oh  no

you are in the midst

 woman screaming 
  bots are being activated 
  it s a swarm 
 grunting

 woman screams 
 bugs  come on 
 morpheus grunting 
 grunting 
 whimpers 
 shrieking 
i got a hack
in the bathroom  hurry 
yes 
come on 
seq  where 
  that mirror 
  what 
  we ll never fit 
  you gotta fit 
 cause i don t have
another way off this train 
   groans 
   morpheus  whoa  whoa  whoa 
no  no  no 
think  perspective  
closer you are 
bigger it gets 
okay  come on 
in you go 
 suspenseful music builds 
 grunts 
 groaning 
 tense music builds 
 ominous music playing 
 haunting music playing 
 ominous music playing 
 metal clicking 
 grunts 
 yells  straining 
 groaning 
 whirring 
 screams 
 yelps  grunts 
 warbling 
 groaning 
 soft music playing 
 softly  trinity 
no 
 suspenseful music playing 
 sentinels chittering 
 thunder crashing 
 dramatic music playing 
 electricity crackling 
 echoing  welcome back
to the real world 
trinity 
  what s up  doc 
   woman  his vital systems
have been
meticulously maintained 
but it doesn t look good 
 ekg beeping 
  we re losing him 
  cold boot could shock him 
do it 
 computer buzzing rapidly 
 groans 
 exhales 
i remember this 
the construct 
in between everything
and nothing 
welcome to the crib 
i ve been chilling here
in the ship network   
learning all about you 
 tv static 
and me 
careful  it ll do your head in 
are memories turned
into fiction any less real 
is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction 
as to my role in all this 
my best guess
is that you wrote me
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces
that helped you become you 
morpheus and agent smith 
a combo pack
of counterprogramming
that was   
 inhales 
let s just say  more than
a little bit crazy making 
but it worked
because here we are 
now  for the bad news 
your brain
is hooked on this shit
the matrix has been
force feeding you for years 
hooked bad 
you re going through
major withdrawals 
docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving 
but  see 
they don t know you like i do 
i know exactly what you need 
 lively music playing 
you gotta be kidding 
uh uh 
no joke 
could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life 
but if you want it   
 water splashing 
you gotta fight for it 
no  i m done fighting 
are you 
 traditional battle
music playing 
 neo grunting 
 groans 
 gasps 
 grunts 
 music resumes 
 groaning 
what the hell is he doing 
oh  yeah 
they taught you good 
 neo grunting 
made you believe their world
was all you deserved 
but some part of you knew
that was a lie 
some part of you remembered
what was real 
you don t know me 
no 
 both grunting 
 groans 
ooh 
 yelling 
 panting 
 neo grunting 
 morpheus grunting 
 both grunting 
i know you  because i know
the only thing
that still matters to you 
i know it s why you re here 
why you re still fighting
and why you will
never give up 
 both grunting 
 neo groaning 
   whimpering 
   ekg beeping 
come on  neo 
this is it 
this is your last chance 
 neo groaning 
 emotional music playing 
 groaning 
you gotta fight
for your goddamn life
if you want to see
trinity again 
 neo groaning 
come on  neo  fight for her 
  holy shit 
  fight for her 
 yelling 
 explosion 
 gasps 
 sighs 
  hey 
  hey 
mind if i   
how are you doing 
if this plug is actually real 
that means
they took my life   
 scoffs 
and turned it
into a video game 
how am i doing 
i don t know 
i don t even know how to know 
that s it  isn t it 
if we don t know
what s real   
we can t resist 
they took your story 
something that meant
so much to people like me 
and turned it
into something trivial 
that s what the matrix does 
it weaponizes every idea 
every dream 
everything
that s important to us 
where better to bury truth
than inside something
as ordinary as a video game 
that sounds like the oracle 
 bugs chuckles 
heard so much about her 
she was gone
before i was free 
gone 
when this new version
of the matrix was uploaded 
there was a purge 
 sighs 
they promised peace
and they gave us purge 
no 
no  there was peace 
you made it possible 
and it changed everything 
doesn t feel like
it changed anything 
the matrix is
the same or worse 
and i m back where i started 
it feels like
everything i did 
everything we did   
 both grunt 
   like none of it mattered 
all of it mattered 
i can show you 
this is my crew 
our operator  seq 
sequoia  but everybody
calls me seq 
nice to meet you 
dad loved redwoods 
when he escaped the matrix
and found out
they no longer existed 
it almost killed him 
lucky  he met mom
and here i am 
this is lexy 
berg and ellster 
hi 
you knew my grandfather 
captain roland 
roland was your grandfather 
he always laughed 
joking how he never
believed in you 
but  in private  he said that
you freed his mind
a second time 
uh  not to fanboy out here 
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me 
berg is our resident
neo ologist 
a what 
there s a lot of people
out there like me
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life 
i would never have recognized
your modal
if it weren t for him 
whenever
you re feeling up for it 
i ve got  like 
a million questions 
me too  starting with them 
 bugs  it s okay 
come meet him 
this is cybebe 
that s octacles 
  that s lumin8 
   chittering 
machines are on our side now 
they are synthients 
it s a word
they prefer to  machines  
your contact
with the synthient city
had a huge impact
on their world 
 bugs  that s what i meant 
what you changed
that nobody believed
could ever be changed 
the meaning of  our side  
 cybebe warbling softly 
cybebe and octacles
risked their lives
to help get you out 
thank you 
but why 
 morpheus 
not all seek to control 
just as not all
wish to be free 
what is that 
an exomorphic particle codex 
it s pretty new 
it gives programs
access to this world 
within limits 
limits are the domain
of the limited 
morpheus 
thank you 
it was my honor 
 chuckles  wow 
   crew chuckles 
  how does it work 
paramagnetic oscillation 
if you want 
i can download
the codex manual for you 
  sure 
  downloading used to be fun 
now it s all manuals
and diagnostics 
can i ask them something 
when you unplugged me 
there was another pod 
 warbling softly 
yes  we ve analyzed the data 
it could be trinity 
it s her 
i figured we were going
to have this conversation 
look  you were not
a typical flush and grab 
you were in this weird tower
that cybebe
had never accessed 
and she s now exiled 
we burned
our one shot for you 
even if it were trinity
and she wanted to be free 
we have no idea how to do it 
yet 
nobody believed
we d ever find him 
but we did 
okay 
we don t know
how to get her out    yet 
captain  we re approaching
security clearance 
we re here 
zion 
have a seat 
this is hanno 
best pilot in our fleet 
quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me 
 control on radio 
mnemosyne  you are cleared
for landing  welcome home 
 hanno  thank you  control 
um  we re about to crash 
 dramatic music playing 
 chuckles 
general realized we were
never going to beat
the sentinels  so   
we just got better
at hiding from them 
welcome to io 
io 
 sweeping music playing 
wow  that looks real 
bio sky 
works kind of like
grow lights 
it s way more complex
than that 
it pulls water from the crust 
hydronating the air 
it balances the eco
and our sri cycles 
plus     sighs 
it is pretty to look at 
as opposed to that 
i guess the general sent us
a welcome party 
god damn 
it is you 
niobe 
a few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth 
but wise enough to know
i don t know anything 
i sure as shit
never saw this coming 
neither did i 
i told you he was alive 
captain  you and your crew
have been grounded 
general 
if you d just let me explain 
the protocols are put in place
for everyone s protection 
i m sorry 
i saw an opportunity
and i was afraid
we d lose him 
but  general  people have been
waiting for so long 
we found the one 
i don t believe in the one 
i never did 
no 
me neither 
but there was a time
when you trusted me
with your ship 
against the council s orders 
the world was different then 
we were different 
report to the docks 
scrub down the mnemosyne 
transfer your access codes 
you are done  captain 
 gasps softly 
we need to talk 
 niobe  when word first came
that it actually
might be you   
i didn t know how i would feel
in this moment 
it is nice to see you 
  it s good to see you too 
   glasses clink 
a long way
from dozer s paint stripper 
 chuckles  yes 
a lot has changed 
except maybe you 
you remember this 
it s so easy to forget
how much noise
the matrix pumps
into your head
until you unplug 
 neo sighs 
yeah 
something else
makes the same kind of noise 
takes over every damn thing 
just like the matrix 
war 
i stood at the barricade
of the temple 
staring
at the army of sentinels 
waiting for them
to kill every one of us 
but then  they left 
they said you saved us 
i didn t believe it 
every night i would dream
of attack sirens 
but then 
i would wake up to this   
silence 
i m ashamed of it now 
my pessimism of how long
it took me to believe
a world without war
was possible 
you gave me that 
you gave that gift to us all 
and it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit 
come help me get up 
let s take a walk 
 mysterious music playing 
 elevator door opens 
oh  beautiful 
this is freya  head of botany 
and this is quillion 
our lead digitologist 
i presume our guest
needs no introduction 
nothing travels
faster than light 
except gossip 
 freya chuckles 
welcome to the garden  neo 
a strawberry 
using digital code
from the matrix 
we retro convert it
into dna sequences 
and they grow here 
it s not easy
augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize
bio sky  but   
  we re getting there 
   chuckles 
go ahead  try it 
 niobe chuckles 
we re quite excited
about the blueberries 
you remember that shit
we used to eat 
that slop
that tasted like rust 
zion could have never
made something like this 
why 
because we needed synthients
and di like him 
zion was stuck in the past 
stuck in war 
stuck in a matrix of its own 
they believed
that it had to be us or them 
this city was built by us
and them 
what happened to zion 
i ve been waiting
for you to ask that question 
all of the troubles
started in the machine cities 
power plants were unable
to produce enough energy 
nothing can breed violence
like scarcity 
for the first time 
we saw machines at war
with one other 
we got word from the oracle
of a new power rising 
that was the last
we heard from her 
morpheus 
 niobe  after the siege 
he was elected unanimously 
high chair of the council 
oh  how he loved that   scoffs 
but as rumors
of this new power spread 
he ignored them 
he was certain what you had
done could not be undone 
all of these people never
stopped believing in miracles 
believing in you 
i m sorry 
how could i know
this would happen 
we didn t understand
all of it back then 
no more than we do now 
i didn t come here
to cause you problems  niobe 
but i need your help 
trinity is alive 
then there is
another question 
why did they keep her alive 
i can t answer that 
but if there s a chance
i can free her 
i have to try 
even if it means endangering
everyone in this city 
i m sorry  neo 
i won t let what happened
to zion happen to io 
i hope you ll forgive
an old woman
for asking you to go
with sheperd  here 
till we have
better understanding
of what s going on 
you re going to imprison me
after i just got free 
i know it doesn t seem fair 
but neither does growing old 
but you don t
hear me complaining 
 elevator whirring 
sorry 
i ve never met
a legend before 
neo 
sheperd   breathes shakily 
 chuckles in disbelief 
crazy  you re real 
 real  
there s that word again 
 sheperd  people talk a lot
about the old days 
about you  the viral agent 
the siege of zion 
everything was simpler
back then 
people wanted to be free 
it s different now 
sometimes it feels like
people gave up 
like the matrix won 
 unlocks door 
this is you 
and i gotta ask you one thing 
is it true you could fly 
cool 
 locks door 
 trickling 
 morpheus grunts 
morpheus 
oh  general stuck you
in the rapunzel tower 
 morpheus exhales 
on the upside 
it s a nice view 
what happened to bugs
and the others 
they re supposed to be
sterilizing the mnemosyne
  with a toothbrush 
   supposed to be  
well  i could tell you
that they re standing by 
waiting for you
to make the choice
to remain meekly incarcerated
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find trinity 
but that ain t a choice 
 dramatic music playing 
 sheperd  general 
what should we do 
 freya  bugs has the same
independence of mind
she had the day you freed her 
this is not
independence of mind 
it s mutiny 
 freya  come on   be 
i know how much
you hated locking him up 
just like i know
there s a part of you
that s relieved now
that he s gone 
we ve worked so hard
to keep io safe 
this scares me 
that s her 
 seq  on the bridge 
got her 
 engine revving 
it s sick
how the semblance works 
you see flashes
of the real her  but   
the way she reads   
code wise 
she s pure bluepill 
this is a tough question  neo 
but it has to be asked 
what if she s happy
where she is 
how did i read 
exactly like her 
take us to broadcast depth 
 suspenseful music playing 
thank you for helping me 
most of us are here
because of you 
i also admit our only chance
to get out
of the general s doghouse
is for you to find your mojo 
what if i can t be
what i once was 
  then we re all fucked 
   signal beeps 
 hanno  two minutes 
two minutes to broadcast 
 seq  i slipped you in
through a hotel room 
 seq chuckles 
should be safe 
portal s open 
closest i could get you is
the warehouse near her garage 
whole zone s
crawling with bots 
let s go 
so  what do you think of him 
i was kinda worried at first
because he s so much older 
the beard  the hair    oh 
  no  totally works for me 
   scoffs  you idiot 
i mean  the one  thing 
you know  everyone that
shipped with him died 
oh  yeah  he s gonna
get us all killed  for sure 
 guns cocking 
predictable as ever 
smith 
smith  as in   the  smith 
 chuckles 
this is so insane 
there s so many theories
about the two of them
and they re standing
right there 
this code is freaky 
he s like an agent  but not 
an appeal to reason 
how did you find us 
you never appreciated
our relationship 
not like the analyst 
  the what 
  my doctor 
he used our bond
and turned it into a chain 
it s so obvious
once you see it  right 
but this whole altered code
update really blew my mind 
i still don t know
how he did it 
you  as a balding nerd 
hilarious 
and me     sighs 
even more perfect 
maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes 
what do you think 
what do you want  smith 
i have such dreams  tom 
big dreams 
well  mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies 
but in order for me
to pursue mine 
i need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours 
hmm  sounds like conflict 
inevitable 
doesn t have to be 
all you have to do
is stay out of the matrix 
and leave
the good doctor to me 
you can have him 
i m here for trinity 
that s the trouble  tom 
he knew you d come 
just like i did 
 scoffs 
trust me 
you re not ready for him 
captain  i m reading portals
from the lower frequencies 
i won t have his leash
on my neck again 
i found some
old acquaintances of yours 
  bugs 
   growling 
 ominous music playing 
 snarls 
exiles 
i thought
they were all purged 
 man  you 
 excitedly  oh 
it is you 
 man speaking french 
all these years 
i can t believe it 
oh  god 
you stole my life 
 speaking french 
 in english  what the merv
is trying to say 
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine 
to have their lives back 
yours has to end 
 bullet whizzing 
kill him 
 tense music playing 
 blade slicing 
 all grunting 
you ruined
every suck my silky ass thing 
we had grace 
we had style 
we had conversation 
not this   
 mimics text message sound 
 all grunting 
   bone cracks 
   yells 
art  films 
books were all better 
originality mattered 
you gave us
face zucker suck
and cock me climatey 
wiki piss and shit 
 screams 
 screaming 
 ominous music builds 
 man groans 
i still know kung fu 
neo 
 smith yells 
 both grunting 
just like old times 
 tense music playing 
 neo groaning 
 woman shrieks 
 man yelling 
neo 
i ve been thinking
about us  tom 
look how binary is the form 
the nature of things 
ones and zeros 
 grunting 
light and dark 
choice and its absence 
 smith grunts 
anderson and smith 
 dramatic music playing 
 gasps 
you ve lost something  tom 
you re not
what you used to be 
it s true 
 grunts 
 jaw cracks 
  nice one 
  thanks 
come on  neo 
 neo groaning 
 panting 
 gasps 
captain  you okay 
yeah  where s neo 
smith is killing him 
 bugs  where 
 neo groaning 
i feel bad about this  tom 
after all  you are the one
who set me free   
again 
so  you  more than anyone 
understands why
i can t go back 
 grunts 
you should have
listened to me 
now you ll never
see her again 
 grunts 
 yells 
 energy explodes 
what was that 
that was neo 
mojo rising 
 lumin8 chittering 
 seq exclaims 
 bugs  you all right 
yeah 
it s gonna trigger a response 
i got multiple exits ready 
 the merovingian 
this is not over yet 
our sequel franchise spinoff 
 speaking french 
 spits 
 bugs  we should go 
i can t 
i have to talk to her 
neo  those exiles
were older than you 
and we barely handled them 
 sighs 
you really wanna do this now 
i mean   
you look like shit 
 buzzing 
oh  my god  what 
what happened 
an accident 
 tiffany  kush  call a doctor 
it s fine 
i don t have a lot of time 
i wasn t sure
i d see you again 
after we spoke  i realized   
my life wasn t a life 
at some point 
i think i gave up
searching for something real 
wait 
something happened 
i looked for you
at the coffee shop 
i began to wonder
if i imagined you 
and then last night
i had a dream 
in the dream  you were
surrounded by police 
then they started chasing us 
  us 
  you were on my bike with me 
how did it end 
not good 
i ve had dreams
that weren t just dreams 
you mean a dream
that came true 
 bell tinkling 
 suspenseful music playing 
finally  we can talk
like adults 
i hate lying  i do 
it exhausts me 
tiff and i have been
waiting for you   
like  forever 
 distorted rewinding 
deja vu  right 
oh  no use 
you can t beat time 
this rewind is happening
faster than you can blink 
you gave me the idea 
allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word 
 bullet time  
 grunts in slow motion 
i know  kind of ironic 
using the power that defined
you to control you   chuckles 
i kept such a close eye on you
and still you found a way out 
clever monkey 
using that modal 
call me an optimist 
but this could
all be for the best 
the skin s not looking
too bad this time 
i know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear 
after everything
you went through 
all that pain and suffering 
only to learn the world
doesn t end when you do 
surprise 
 neo grunts 
i was there when you died 
 neo screaming 
i said to myself 
 here is the anomaly
of anomalies  
what an extraordinary
opportunity 
first  i had to convince
the suits
to let me rebuild
the two of you 
why her  getting there 
and don t worry 
she can t hear me 
resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive 
like renovating a house 
took twice as long 
cost twice as much 
 gasps 
i thought you d be happy
to be alive again 
so wrong 
   machine whirring 
   screaming 
did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code 
 screaming 
we worked for years 
trying to activate
your source code 
i was about to give up 
when i realized   
trinity 
   it was never just you 
alone  neither of you
is of any particular value 
 trinity screaming 
like acids and bases 
you re dangerous
when mixed together 
every sim
where you two bonded   
let s just say
bad things happened 
neo 
however  as long as i managed
to keep you close 
but not too close 
i discovered
something incredible 
now  my predecessor
loved precision 
his matrix was all fussy facts
and equations 
he hated the human mind 
so he never bothered
to realize
that you don t give a shit
about facts 
it s all about fiction 
the only world that matters
is the one in here 
and you people
believe the craziest shit 
why 
what validates
and makes your fictions real 
feelings 
allow me 
kush  here 
is one of my handlers 
they re everywhere 
such a pain  cloning agents
over a coppertop 
far more effective
just to saturate a population 
and  bonus 
swarm mode is sick fun 
 chuckles 
 gun fires in slow motion 
ooh  nicely done 
you ever wonder
why you have nightmares 
why your own brain
tortures you 
it s actually us 
maximizing your output 
it works just like this 
oh  no 
can you stop the bullet 
if only you could move faster 
 chuckles  here s the thing
about feelings 
they re so much easier
to control than facts 
turns out  in my matrix 
the worse we treat you 
the more we manipulate you 
the more energy you produce 
it s nuts   chomps 
i ve been setting
productivity records
every year since i took over 
and  the best part 
zero resistance 
people stay in their pods 
happier than pigs in shit 
the key to it all 
you 
and her 
quietly yearning
for what you don t have 
while dreading
losing what you do 
for 99 9  of your race 
that is the definition
of reality 
desire and fear  baby 
just give the people
what they want  right 
 squelches 
she s the only home
you have  thomas 
come home before
something terrible happens 
 tense music playing 
 neo grunts 
 keyboard clacking 
  bugs 
  i hear him 
   sirens approaching 
   tires screech 
trinity 
  you shouldn t call me that 
  i m sorry 
i have to go 
but i ll be back 
neo  time to go 
   gasps 
   alarm blaring 
  sentinels 
  worse 
 sheperd on radio 
general ordered me
to look after the ship 
so you shadowed us 
check your long range scans 
squids are combing this area 
he s right 
you can stay here and die 
or come back
and face a court martial 
and you call that a choice 
 niobe  sheperd should have
left you to the squids 
i m too damn old to sit
through some boring ass trial 
niobe  don t blame bugs 
do shut your mouth 
do address me as general 
and do not rob
my ex captain of her agency 
which she exercised
with her own
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity 
shortsighted 
you care more about growing
fruit than freeing minds 
we are not going
to have this argument again 
it s not an argument 
it s a fact 
you gave up on people 
i tell you
what i m going to give up on
and it s you 
sheperd  get her
out of my sight 
general   
disarm 
kujaku s a friend 
 kujaku warbling 
hello  friend 
 chittering softly 
okay 
him 
general 
thank you for seeing me 
i figured if there was anyone
who could make sense
of this mess 
it would be you 
hello  neo 
i know you 
i tried to keep my eye on you 
 clicks tongue 
why 
we met a long time ago 
good morning 
sati 
my father knew
we d meet again 
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances 
his inadvertent role
in what happened to you
was the greatest regret
of his life 
i don t understand 
my father
was the chief engineer
at the anomaleum 
 niobe  the what 
my father designed
the resurrection pods
where neo and trinity
were imprisoned 
 niobe  i m sorry 
you knew what happened to him 
you knew that he and trinity
both were alive   
and you didn t tell me 
there were times
i doubted my decision  niobe 
but io needed you 
this city needed to be built
for your people
as well as mine 
if i would have
told you everything 
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make 
my friends
let me make my own choices 
if it was a mistake 
you have my deepest apologies 
why are you here now 
neo s escape has
destabilized the matrix 
the anomaleum
draws its current
from trinity alone now 
a fail safe has been
triggered to reset
the matrix back
to the previous version 
but the analyst
halted the reset 
he s convinced the authorities
that you will soon
return voluntarily 
and why would he say that 
because if i don t go back 
he ll kill trinity 
faced with returning
to your pod
or enduring
trinity s death again 
what would you choose  neo 
i ll go back 
well  the analyst
knows you well 
but that knowledge
has made him incautious 
after you escaped 
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated trinity 
but that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity
that now exists before us 
a few hours ago 
no one would have been able
to convince me
that i would be standing here 
trying to explain a mission
as crazy as this one 
what are you doing 
  volunteering 
  oh  no 
you are the one captain
that i am ordering to go 
now you don t
have to order me  general 
 cause i m volunteering 
i need two more 
are you out of your minds 
you don t even know
what it is 
general  we know you 
if you say this is important 
none of us is
choosing to stay home 
thank you 
knuckle up  and good luck

 kujaku chittering 
 sati  trinity is held
in the anomaleum 
which is in this
transmission tower 
the passages used
to rescue neo are now sealed
and a legion of sentinels
patrols the tower 
so  stealth will be paramount 
as long as we raise no alarms 
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest 
you mean
crossing the fetus fields 
sneaking across
an entire power plant 
climbing
a two kilometer tower
guarded by thousands
of sentinels 
that s the easy part 
exactly so 
because all we have to do
is convince someone
who does this every day
to take one of us along 
   electricity crackling 
   dramatic music continues 
fifty meters
below the anomaleum
is a stratum
of amniotic filters 
hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent 
this vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier 
which oxygenates
the bio gel used in neo s pod 
i get it 
the exomorph slinkies up
neo s old umbilicus 
what could go wrong 
 tense music playing 
 grunts 
 straining 
 sati  once inside 
morpheus will use
the system operator
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators 
 machinery clanking 
in order to unplug
trinity s body 
while her mind still remains
connected to the matrix 
i m gonna need
a second human brain
to implement the bypass 
and since neo
must be with the analyst 
the only available mind
that s a near enough match
is yours 
figures 
 tense music playing 
thanks  cybebe 
 grunts 
does trinity still have
to take the red pill 
since kujaku and i
are transferring
her consciousness
onto the ship 
it s not strictly necessary 
but what matters is that
this is her choice 
extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will 
in all probability  kill her 
but even if it is
what she wants 
won t the analyst just order
the sentinels to stop you 
he will 
but if my plan works 
it won t matter 
why 
because we ll already be gone 
somebody thinks
this hard about a plan 
there has to be a reason why 
when my father realized
how the anomaleum
was going to be used 
he covertly transferred
the designs to me 
the analyst
discovered his betrayal
and had my parents purged 
 inhales sharply 
i would have been murdered too
if it wasn t for kujaku 
not a day goes by
that i don t grieve them 
i ve been praying for this day
for a very long time 
 door unlocks  opens 
we re coming up on broadcast 
i thought you should know
that i m here because of her 
all i ever wanted was to be
as fearless as trinity 
but i saw how she reacted
in the garage  and i   
you re wondering if i m wrong 
what if we re too late 
what if she s not
trinity anymore 
 sighs 
i never believed
i was the one 
but she did 
she believed in me 
it s my turn
to believe in her 
 sighs 
 suspenseful music playing 
 sati  this is
where it gets tricky 
have you ever done
an operation like this 
not yet 
 suspenseful music builds 
here we go 
 suspenseful music continues 
welcome home 
all i want is to talk to her 
do you mean tiff 
come back  and you can talk
to her as often as you like 
i mean  handsome chad
may have something
to say about it 
if she tells me
this is what she wants 
you win 
really 
but if she wants me 
then you ll let us go free 
and why would i do something
as stupid as that 
right now  i m on a ship full
of people who will unplug me
before they ll let you
take me back 
if you want this matrix 
this is your only chance 
but how do i know
they won t unplug you anyway 
same way i know you ll let us
walk out of here 
 suspenseful music playing 
okay 
i like tests 
we ll let tiff decide 
 electricity crackling 
 sati breathing heavily 
that s it 
bypass is ready 
now what 
we wait 
doesn t it seem crazy
to come all this way
and leave her here 
we must abide by her decision 
and if she says no 
what happens to neo 
at this time 
the most important choice
of neo s life
is not his to make 
 slow suspenseful
music playing 
i saw this in my dream 
if i was the oracle 
maybe i could explain it 
the oracle 
from your game 
it s not a game 
oh  god 
 tiffany sighs 
after you left  i went home
and i played it 
i kept thinking 
why does this story
feel like a memory 
there s a part of me
that feels like i have been
waiting my whole life for you 
and that part is like 
 what the hell
took you so long    sniffles 
i don t have an easy answer 
maybe i was afraid of this 
afraid of what might happen 
afraid of hurting
the only person i ever loved 
i wish i was
who you think i am 
but look at me 
i can t be her 
   donnie  mom 
   brandon  mom  come on 
  mom

what s going on here 
but i m glad we found you 
  she got hit by a car 
  i know  it s crazy 
she was chasing after you 
they re casting her arm 
we gotta go 
 chad  doctor said

yeah  definitely asked
for that 
   snaps fingers 
   the analyst groaning 
 shudders 
can t you control her 
 groaning 
that was for using children 
we have a few questions 
you tried to activate
the fail safe 
the suits tried 
obviously  without control
of your source code 
i knew that was impossible 
so  why haven t
the suits purged you 
because i know the system 
i know human beings 
and i know you 
 bones crack  sighs 
right now  you re feeling good
about what you ve done 
you should 
it was a victory  bravo 
now what 
you ve come here to negotiate
some kind of deal 
you think you hold
all the cards 
because you can do whatever
you want in this world 
i say  go for it 
remake it 
knock yourselves out 
paint the sky with rainbows 
but here s the thing 
the sheeple aren t
going anywhere 
they like my world 
they don t want
this sentimentality 
they don t want
freedom or empowerment 
they want to be controlled 
they crave
the comfort of certainty 
and that means you two 
back in your pods 
unconscious and alone 
just like them 
 both chuckle 
we re not here
to negotiate anything 
we were on our way
to remake your world 
change a few things 
i kind of like
the  paint the sky
with rainbows  idea 
just remind people
what a free mind can do 
i forgot  it s easy to forget 
  he makes it easy 
  that  he does 
something he should
think about 
before we got started 
we decided to stop by
to say thank you 
you gave us something
we never thought we could have 
and what is that 
another chance
