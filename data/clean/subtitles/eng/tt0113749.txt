into the auditorium
for a stage presentation   
by the drama
and history clubs 
they put together
an impressive musical
about paul revere   
entitled
light your own lamps 
is there a dance number 
nothing better than
a couple of skimpily clad
undergraduates   
just hurling themselves
across the stage 
i always say 
get me another highball 
right away  governor 
will you stop

just don t eyeball everyone

to tackle
the next sirhan sirhan 
i mean  i ask you   
can you imagine anyone
wanting to attack me 
for christ s sake

what are you doing 
you looking at naked guys
in the shower again 
didn t anyone ever tell you
not to point guns at people 
once  i shot him 
nice sneakers 
i went to look for you
in your room   
and ronnie told me
i could find you up here 
what gives 
i wanted to finish
that paper on supernovas   
and john slas said that
i could use his telescope   
before he went home
for break 
what do you need his for 
you got your own 
no  i got the lenses  t s  
but i need slas  shaft 
oh

you insatiable slut 
 we re all in the gutter 
but some of us
are looking at the stars  
oscar wilde 
i thought that you d be
down there trying to secure
the best seat in the house 
this might be the first
and last time you ever see
your boyfriend on stage   
especially in a musical 
so i d like you
to be down there
front row  up center 
i m gonna watch you
from up here 
with that thing 
you ll never see me 
are you kidding 
do you have any idea
how powerful this thing is 
i ll be able to see
the flop sweat
form on your brow 
yeah  but you won t be able
to hear me sing 
bingo 
strident 
i m gonna have to
teach you a lesson about
being demure for your man 
in fact   
that s it 
i m having sex with you
right here  right now 
what are you doing 
let s go  come on 
pull them down 
would you get off me 
i ve got work to do 
i don t mind

your star gazing 
i ll take you
from behind here 
it ll be great practice
for when we get older  and you
watch tv while we screw 
will you get off me 
all right 
for now  but when
we get to florida in   
about approximately 17 hours 
you owe me 
about that   
yes 
well  i can t go 
excuse me 
my dad s asked me
to help him with his new show 
what  like
his assistant or   
as a contestant 
you mean that
dating game rip off thing 
that is what
you re talking about here 
right 
that guy knows no shame 
what  so he forbid you
to go to florida
when you said no  is that it 
i can t believe   
brandi 
you didn t say no 
t s   it s no big deal 
i mean  it s just tv 
besides 
it is really important
for my father s career 
otherwise 
he would never have asked me 
brandi  the guy hates me 
for christ s sake 
don t you think
that might be a little part
of the motive here 
he d love to see us break up 
he d love for us
not to go on that vacation 
that s for sure 
what did you think 
for christ s sake 
jesus  you know 
for a science major   
you can be really
fucking stupid sometimes 
i was giving you
the benefit of the doubt  t s 
i thought that you
might be able to handle this
like an adult   
and show my father
how wrong he is
about our relationship 
well  i guess
i credited you with too much 
you are just as thoughtless
and possessive as he is 
you both see me as property 
in fact   
the two of you
have so much in common   
you should just go
date each other 
brandi  wait 
just leave me alone 
please 
oh  no  the gun s caught
in your hair 
would you get it out 
i m trying 
mr  svenning

thank you
for squaring everything
with the police 
i know we probably
worried you  but brandi and i
are both okay  we   
if it wouldn t mean
implicating my daughter
in this somehow   
i would insist
that the authorities
lock you up   
for the rest of
your young life 
you goddamned little menace 
sir  it was an accident 
i swear 
no  you re the accident 
you moron 
you have no idea

of somebody
who has to work
for their breaks

 concept

that this isn t about
just what happened
on the roof

 cause you
don t have the guts   
to stand up to your father 
maybe i don t 
come on  brandi 
what about florida

in front of
the entire school   
the community  the nation 
for god s sakes

my father s career

good cop bad cop routine   
and now you have the gall
to ask me if i still want to

your mother see me 
who s worried 
are you kidding me 
i ve never met a person
who lives in as much fear
of his mother as you do

so that s why
i have to sneak in here   
after everyone s
asleep at night and sneak out
undetected in the morning 
you want
i should tell my mother
what we do in here at night 
that you play videogames
and i fall asleep unfulfilled 
go ahead  it beats
the sneaking around shit

i asked  didn t i 
i m playing the role
of the concerned guy 
i cry 
you cry 
i cry 
any particular reason 
hey 
i think about the people
that make decisions
that affect our lives 
the doctors
who make advancements
in curing diseases 
the engineer
that designs skyscrapers 
the guy that maps out
a plane s flight path 
the navigator 
i think about how those people
are out there every day   
making a difference 
leading big lives   
and how they refuse
to be intimidated   
by the tremendous odds
of failure they face 
and how they only
concern themselves with peers
and company that apply   
to their goals
and noble causes 
jesus  i d hate to tell you
what i think about
when i m in the bathroom 
i think about all that
and i cry   
because i have
nothing better to do
than fuck you 
you re dumping me 
what are you  crazy 
is this because
i didn t introduce you
to my mother 
holy shit

wow  look at this laundry list
of complaints

no college ambition 
no job prospects

the financial question 
proving once more   
what women really look for

blood bank  sperm bank 
currently considering
the eye bank 
wow  she calls you callow
in here

well  until this morning 
he read an article today
comparing him to the father
of james earl ray 
can t you explain it to him 
you know it was an accident 
i know it wasn t planned 
but  accident 
is too light a term   
to describe
what happened  t s 
whatever  can t we
just forget about it 
look  we already
missed florida 
we could be spending
this time alone together 
away from our friends 
school  studies  everything 
don t you want to
spend some time alone
with me 
just to talk 
perhaps 
perhaps 
or perhaps more than talk 
oh

for active non talking 
why don t you go get a pizza
with me tonight 
i ve got the game show
tonight 
this is svenning s bedroom

you re still going through
with this 
come on  t s  
it s no big deal 
i mean  it s not like
i m going to sleep with them 
you might as well 
i thought you had
more backbone than this 
why do you have to
do everything
that he tells you to do 
there you go again 
just as you re making headway 
you louse it up with this   
possessive machismo
which brings everything
endearing about you   
to a screaming halt  t s 
what are you doing out here 
who are you people 
what are you doing
on my property 
get out of here 
how do you answer
to your neighbor s charges   
that you practice
satanic rituals

no press ll think
to look for you here 
hide in plain sight 
just shut up 
you know what 
this is all your fault
this happened anyway 
you and your 15 minutes
of fame 
get a grip 
for god s sake 
did you ever stop
to think   
that maybe the relationship
wasn t on firm ground
to begin with 
you know  it couldn t
have been that strong
if she breaks up with you   
over something stupid
like getting her shot at 
numbskull 
hey 
i love the smell of commerce
in the morning

making that last 
waste not  want not

we need you to embark
on a little sabotage missi√≥n
on behalf of t s  s love life 
you know about this
game show thing
they ve got going on here 
we need you guys
to somehow ensure that
it doesn t happen 
is that it 
we were gonna do that anyway 
really  why 
what else are we gonna do 
silent bob just stole
the schematic of the stage
from some foolish carpenter   
and found a weakness 
just like
the fucking death star 
he figures if you pull
this crossbeam out   
fucking bickety bam 
the whole stage
comes crashing down 
we were thinking
about something simple   
but if you want to
destroy the stage 
we re all for that 
only problem is lafours 
who s lafours 
you don t know who lafours is 
they don t know
who lafours is 
he s only the most feared
security guard
in the business  man 
460 collars  all convicted 
i hear
he s even got two kills 
holy shit  i never thought
i d see the day   
when two such highly reputable
mischief makers
as yourselves   
douse their drawers
at the sight
of a mall security guard 
shit  bitch  we re gonna
bust out that stage
like a high school kegger 
we re just gonna
outwit lafours  x men style 
should i call you logan 
weapon x 
no  wolverine 
snicky  snicky  snoine 
what he s doing is imitating
wolverine s berserker attack
with his adamantium claws 
i never would have guessed 
all right  guys 
you have your missi√≥n   
go forth and wreak havoc 
bye  baby kitties 
damn  silent bob 
show some heart 
pss  pss  pss 
that s better 
we re on the job 
thanks 
i have to admit i m shocked
you didn t try
to dissuade them 
i would if i
actually thought for a second
they could pull it off 
ye of little faith 
want a cookie 
what s he doing 
if you stare at this p√≥ster
for a few seconds 
a hidden picture appears 
can we do it  please 
go ahead  but hurry 
the easter bunny s waiting 
wow  it s a schooner 
you dumb bastard 
it s not a schooner 
it s a sailboat 
a schooner is a sailboat 
stupidhead 
you know what 
there is no easter bunny 
over there is just a guy
in a suit 
but they re engaged 
it doesn t matter 
it can t happen 
why not 
it s bound to come up 
it s impossible 
lois could never have
superman s baby 
do you think
her fallopian tubes
can handle his sperm 
i guarantee he blows a load
like a shotgun 
right through her back 
what about her womb 
do you think
it s strong enough
to carry his child 
sure  why not 
he s an alien 
for christ s sake 
his kryptonian
biological makeup is enhanced
by earth s yellow sun 
if lois gets a tan 
the kid could kick
right through her stomach 
only someone like wonder woman
has a strong enough uterus
to carry his kid 
the only way
he could bang regular chicks
is with a kryptonite condom 
but that would kill him 
how did i go from the verge
of hot floridian sex
with brandi   
to man of steel
coital debates with you
in the food court 
cookie stand is not part
of the food court 
of course it is 
the food court is downstairs 
the cookie stand is upstairs 
it s not like we re talking
quantum physics here 
the cookie stand counts
as an eatery  the eatery s
a part of the food court 
bullshit 
eateries that operate
within the designated square
downstairs   
qualify as food court 
anything outside
of said designated square   
is considered
an autonomous unit
for mid mall snacking 
now if you re gonna
wax intellectual
about the subject   
holy shit 
wait here 
where are you going 
cherchez la femme 
he said it was
just a guy in a suit 
don t listen to that man 
he just said it to be mean 
that would look terrible
on you 
didn t i dump your ass
this morning 
look  i know you ve had
some time to think about
the mistake you ve made   
and i just want
to let you know
you don t have to apologize 
i m sure you were just pmsing
or something 
brodie  what kills me
about you is your inability
to function   
on the same plane of existence
as the rest of us 
piss off 
okay  i see you want to
continue with this charade
of ending our uni√≥n 
fine  i ll play along 
but if we re divorced 
we re gonna have to divide
our mutual possessions 
what the hell
are you talking about 
you have
my punisher war journal  6   
my copy of fletch
and the remote control
to my tv 
i know it s gonna be hard
to give this stuff up because
of its sentimental attachment 
sentimental attachment 
if i have any
of that crap   
it s because
you brought it over
to my house and left it there 
okay  then let s talk about
coming up with a schedule
for visitation rights 
for what 
for the mall 
i figure you can have
the odd days  i ll take
the even days and weekends 
when there s
any special function like
a sidewalk sale  boat show   
brodie 
i have always taken you
with a grain of salt 
on your birthday 
when you asked me
to do a striptease   
to the theme
from mighty mouse 
i said okay 
when we were
at that hotel  prom night   
and you asked me
to sleep underneath the bed   
in case your mother burst in 
i did it 
and even when we were
at my grandmother s funeral   
when you told
most of my relatives   
that you could see her nipples
through her burial dress 
i let it slide 
if you think that
i m gonna suffer any more
of your shit with a smile   
now that we re broken up 
you re in for some serious
fucking disappointment 
it wasn t mighty mouse 
it was
josie and the pussycats 
what 
sorry 
phase one 
first  you take a run
at lafours with a sock
full of quarters 
i d do it 
but i pulled my back   
out humping your mom
last night  nudge 
you clock him on his headpiece
and knock his ass out cold 
that s when phase two
kicks in 
i attack the structure
wolvie berserk style and
knock out the fucking pin   
and bickety bam 
the motherfucker s rubble 
hence  no game show 
what  do you know that kid
or something 
i hope his pants get caught
and a bloodbath ensues 
what is with you today 
don t get me wrong 
i don t wish the kid harm   
but his mother should suffer
that horrific ordeal   
so she ll learn
how to manage her child 
that s sort of a harsh lesson 
don t you think 
there s not a year goes by
that i don t read about
an escalator accident   
involving some bastard kid
that could ve been
easily avoided   
had some parent   
i don t care which one 
but some parent 
conditioned him   
to fear and respect
that escalator 
wow  look who it is 
jerk 
little tricia jones 
what s a pretty girl
like you   
doing sitting alone
in the middle of this
monument to consumerism 
updating my calendar
and waiting for jay
and silent bob 
and i suppose

as per usual 
on the contrary 
i m here for comics

nobody calls me that 
our little tricia here

jesus  brodie 
calm down 
tricia s compiling data
for this book she s writing   
about the sex drive of men
ages 14 to 30 
if i remember correctly   
it s titled bore gasm 
a study of the  90s male s
sexual prowess 
ready to get sick 
tell him about the advance
you got 
pendant publishing gave me
 20 000 based on a treatment
and a sample chapter 
you re kidding 
it s true 
she ll be the youngest author
to tackle the subject 
so when are they going
to publish this filthy
little tome of yours 
after my 18th birthday 
to avoid the moral
and legal entanglements 
so tricia
sleeps with a bunch of guys
as research 
if that s not enough 
get this 
she videotapes all of them 
what 
i get everybody s consent
before we do it 
most guys get off on it 
men are easily amused 
what are you writing
in the calendar 
i was coding
last night s research 
she means sex 
i know what she meant 
what kind of codes 
here  look 
the smiley face
is for when i go down
on the guy 
the smiley face with lashes
is for when the guy
goes down on me 
the circle is for
when we have sex 
the circle with the  x  in it
is for when i have an orgasm 
the little house
is when we do it inside
and the grass is for outside 
that kid is back
on the escalator again 
wow  that s
a pretty elaborate log
you got there 
wow  look at all
those smiley faces
without eyelashes 
that shows you
how courteous men are 
out of 50 entries  only two
have smiley faces with lashes 
you slept with 50 guys 
to fill out my research  yes 
that s more guys
than you ve slept with  dude 
oh  my god 
that kid is sitting
on the escalator again 
how old
was last night s subject 
if you don t mind me asking 
twenty five  it was the guy
who runs that store
fashionable male 
holy shit 
you slept with that asshole 
why 
i needed a 25 year old 
and he has
quite a distaste for you 
i might add 
he mentioned me during sex 
afterwards 
he says he wants to
kick your ass  i d steer
clear of him  if i were you 
tell me you videotaped him
saying that 
no 
i shut the camera off
after the sex

the stuff he wanted to do 
i m having a hard time
with this

while we re on the subject 
why the hell do you want
to get married now  anyway

waste of time 
if you ask me 
my grandmother always said 
 why buy the cow   
when you get the sex
for free  
she did 
all the time 
of course 
she became a lesbian
on her 60th birthday   
but that s beside the point 
where the hell
are these two going
in such a hurry 
is he gone 
halfway to buy me toys
by now 
damn  that bastard s faster
than walt flanagan s dog 
what s with all the running 
what the hell happened to him 
the human brown eye here
is a walking calamity 
we ll have to take a pass
on the stage trashing
business

i ll kick your ass 
haven t you ever

 the customer s always right  
let me tell you
a little secret 
the customer s
always an asshole 
jesus christ 
what the hell
gives with the cover boy 
none of your damn business 
he d kick your ass
if he knew about this 
are you insane 
the guy looks like
a date rapist 
is that my jacket 
start the elevator 
not until you tell me
what the situation is with you
and the sperminator out there 
how long has this
been going on 
since i finally mustered
the good sense
to send you packing 
he s a much more
suitable companion than you 
any day 
are you nuts 
the guy s pure testosterone 
he s a walking hard on 
looking for a hole 
i need testosterone
after babysitting you and
your comic book collection 
i forgot what real men
were like 
i can t believe
you have the nerve to come
to my mall and pick up guys 
no  shannon
did the picking up 
he s already taken me to lunch
at the cheese haus   
purchased tickets
for the opera night
and took me to stores i like 
i took you shopping
all the time 
you took me
where you went shopping  jerk 
do you think i care   
what rat hole store
in that shit pit
you call the dirt mall   
has got the latest
godzilla bootlegs 
you call eating pizza
in the same dive pizzeria
every night eating out 
do i give a shit   
when two major comic labels
are crossing over
characters   
and selling two editions
of the book
in varied ink chromium covers 
i m a girl  damn it 
i want to do girly things
like fix someone s hair
and get romantic phone calls 
i call you all the time 
 rene  my mom s asleep 
come over  
you call that romantic 
when was the last time
you pulled out my chair
or told me i was beautiful 
this guy does all this
in the span of a day 
this guy already introduced me
to his mother 
really 
he was up and at work
by 9 00 this morning 
unlike my ex boyfriend 
who would sleep until 1 00   
 cause he played sega
and watched videos
all night long 
which  by the way 
has enormous effect
on your libido 
now you attack my libido 
there s no libido to attack 
no libido to attack 
you re sure you saw her
get on  right 
maybe she was getting off 
ow 
sorry 
it s all right 
you know something 
you look familiar to me 
couldn t be 
i m never at the mall much 
no  it s not from the mall 
i know  you re the guy
from the news that kidnapped
the president s daughter   
and threw her off the roof 
i got a musket tangled
in my girlfriend s hair 
for christ s sake 
there  that was romantic 
right 
passionate  yeah 
no  brodie 
that was too little  too late 
too little 
you said it was a good size 
the effort  you retard 
the effort was too little 
too late 
but now that you mention it 
when a girl says
it s a good size   
it s a nice way of saying
that it s small 
hey 
i m gonna kill
that son of a bitch 
no  forget about him 
he just wanted to give me
something that he forgot
to give me a long time ago 
he s harmless now  okay 
fine  i gotta get back
to the store  let s go 
right there
in the elevator 
i don t know
what came over me 
she challenged my libido 
i felt obligated
to defend myself
against her accusations 
it s not like
you still wanted her
or anything like that 
not in the least 
i m over her 
holy shit 
you really love that girl 
yeah  right 
no  i never noticed it before 
but she really
fuels your engine 
you have this
new glow about you 
i don t have a glow 
you do  you re glowing 
if i have a glow
it s because just i got laid 
i d look the same if i banged
anyone in that elevator 
present company excluded 
deny it all you want 
i think you re too proud
to admit you want her back 
i suddenly want something
very bad to happen to you 
what is your problem 
i don t understand 
gwen  i m sorry 
you fucker 
see  that s what you get
for fucking with me 
hey  gwen 
he didn t really mean
to hit you 
he s got a funny way
of showing it  by elbowing me
in my frigging tit 
why the hell are you glowing 
i m not glowing 
brandi dumped him 
would you stop saying that 
i know  i heard 
you heard  how 
she told me  i ran into her
a few minutes ago 
really  where 
by the stage 
do you want me to rub it 
work with me  people 
would you please 
no  i don t want this here 
i want it toward the front 
the rug keeps popping up 
if i put the podium there 
it ll stay down 
move it 
mr  svenning 
give me the podium 
you put the podium down
over here   
like this 
you stamp the carpet down
with your feet 
you speak english 
like this 
mr  svenning 
let me help you up 
get off  move 
here  let me help you 
all right 
where s brandi 
let go of me 
where s brandi 
you re fired 
you get the hell out of here 
get off my set 
where is she 
you are out of her life 
now  you stay
out of her business and mine 
understand me 
come on  people 
are we working here 
get the backdrop ready 
are those lights ready to go 
okay  mr  svenning 
go on the other side   
and put the podium
over the bad spot
in the carpet  okay 
the hole  please  go  now 
so  you made her dump me   
and now you re going to
auction her off   
in an effort to better
further your own career 
not that
it s any of your concern   
but brandi agreed
to be on truth or date 
after that shit you pulled
last night  i think she s even
looking forward to it 
it ll give her a chance
to find herself a decent guy 
somebody with a brain 
you admit it 
you are behind
our break up 
admit it 
hell  i m as proud of it
as i am
of this game show here 
listen to me 
it s over between you two 
the sooner you get that 
the better off
we re all gonna be 
understand me  you don t 
guard  come here 
get this guy off of my set 
if he gives you any shit 
you have my permissi√≥n
to castrate him 
you can t do this 
i just did 
get me lafours 
right away  sir 
well  go on 
i wonder
if my mother ever wore
a pair like this 
how about these 
very sexy 
that sounded convincing 
i m preoccupied 
t s   she told you 
she s just doing it
as a favor to her father 
regardless 
it s not like
she ll fuck the guy
on public access 
she might as well 
you re overreacting again 
that s why
your relationships fail 
it s certainly why ours did 
you got bent out of shape
the same way over that
costume party in high school 
you fucked rick derris
on a pool table 
with everyone watching 
no less 
it was a costume party  t s 
no one could tell it was me 
besides  who else but you
remembers shit like that 
i would ve been a sexy chick 
do you remember
that costume party 
might that have been the one
where you banged rick derris
on the pool table 
nobody remembers
shit like that 
how is it that you recall
the most trivial events 
i ll never forget it 
how many chances do you get to
see smokey fuck the bandit 
didn t i look just like
burt reynolds 
except for the moustache 
you know  they have
a whole room
you re supposed to do that in 
some pervert wanted to
see me naked so badly today   
he busted in on me twice
while i was trying on stuff 
this saves him the effort 
how much longer are we
gonna be in this
chick store  anyway 
i m starting to get
a mean hard on 
brodie  tell me about
the rene break up 
i threw her away
like a parking ticket 
don t front  brodie 
i talked to rene s cousin
this morning 
it was vice versa 
they certainly aren t
acting broken up 
go ahead 
ask him about the elevator 
tell me about the elevator 
it goes up and down 
rene seems so coarse  anyway 
what was it like to date her 
ever slept with somebody 
uh  yeah 
i mean 
really slept with somebody 
beside them 
not just fuck them
on a gaming table 
we slept together one time 
remember  in high school 
that ski trip 
that was you 
yes  brodie 
i ve slept beside many people 
all right 
you know how when someone lays
with their back to you   
and you lay behind them
really close and you throw
one arm over them 
it s called spooning 
but you gotta put
the other arm somewhere 
you can either lay on it
or just shove it
in between your bodies 
the only other option is
to stretch it above your head 
but sometimes my arm pops out
of the socket when
i m sleeping like that 
so  i was constantly searching
for someplace
to keep my arm   
while still laying
close to her 
and 
what do you mean   and  
that s like a metaphor for
our whole relationship 
jackass 
i m all out  i ll meet you
at the food court 
i know exactly how he feels 
excuse me 
fill this with coke  no ice 
want a sip of my soda 
smartass ex boyfriend 
you know who i am 
a deeply resentful
retail manager 
rene s with me now  okay 
you got that 
so don t be sniffing
around her anymore like
you tried to do today 
shit 
there goes the lung 
listen to me 
i got two things to tell you 
one  i don t like you 
i see you every week
in this mall 
i don t like
shiftless layabouts 
you re one of these
fucking loser mallrat kids 
you don t come here
to work or shop 
you hang out all day 
act like you
fucking live here 
i have no respect
for people with
no shopping agenda 
is this what s known as
motivated salesmanship 
rene told me to
leave you alone 
but she s fucking clueless 
the newly single often feel
strangely protective of
the ex boyfriend 
if this is her idea
of protective 
hate to have her mad at me 
now  you see  bruce   
i like to pick up giris
on the rebound from
a disappointing relationship 
they re more vulnerable 
they re in much more
need of solace   
and they re fairly
open to suggestion 
and i use that suggestion
to fuck them someplace
very uncomfortable 
what 
like the back of a volkswagen 
no 
like somewhere giris dread 
all right  now   
is it because
it s a challenge 
is it because it s taboo 
or is it because
i like to  you know   
have them differently than
they ve ever been had before 
this sounds like a discussi√≥n
much more suited   
to an extended professional
counseling sessi√≥n 
i ll go get a therapist
for you 
now  evidently  the only one
that s gonna need
a doctor here   
is yourself  my friend 
and my suggestion to you is   
forget you ever dated rene 
until i get what
i m looking for from
this latest dalliance   
i better not find you within
10 city blocks of her   
otherwise i will be forced
to do you some
very serious damage 
all right 
we clear on that 
rene who 
there you go 
not bad  you re learning 
we re all right  right 
bruce 
i m glad we had
this little chat 
i ll remember it
when i m fucking
your girlfriend 
and my store s having
a sale next weekend 
you should come by 
i ll cut you a nice deal
on a suit 
did we ever get along 
once or twice 
how come we went out
as long as we did 
you had cable 
so  are you gonna stay
for the show 
absolutely not 
as soon as he gets back here 
i m gone 
t s  quint  where s your
sense of chivalry 
oh  my god  is that brodie 
you re fucking kidding 
the easter bunny did this 
all i said was
the easter bunny   
at the menlo park mall
was more convincing 
he just jumped the railing
and knocked me down 
he s fucking dead
