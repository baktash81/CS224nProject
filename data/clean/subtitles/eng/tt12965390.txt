to tell the difference
i was born a fighter
but a girls got bills to pay
and i didnt have a safety net
when i wasnt at school i got a job
training clients for julian james
the best fighter on this side
of the mississippi
and the only father figure id ever had
looks like shes doing all the work
keep it up sienna
nice one more nice
now my sister beth
shes a lover and my other half
i mean dont get me wrong
she drives me nuts
but our friend brent balances us out
that was the extent of my social circle
and to be honest i liked it that way
you need to focus
i tried thats all you
i mean i have more interests
i dont have to go to college
oh yeah you know why
why would you get a big girl job
when you could just be
mooching off me forever
great idea i like where your heads at
ha ha
so
im gonna be right back
just give me one sec
i dont think its gonna work
hey im jax
hi
oh i knew exactly who he was
sienna right
i heard youre a great trainer
maybe we can get in the ring sometime
yeah he was cute
but he had a reputation
and i wasnt just gonna let my guard down
he was a fighter
and a lover
an intoxicating combination
one one two
two one two two
jax was the best id ever trained
and the best fighter ufg had ever had
nice its not just about power okay
its about precision
is that right
making her mxm debut
we have standing in the center ring
a mixed martial artist from springfield
12 wins by knockout
whoo
sienna the princess of rage lane
whoo
and the crowd goes wild
whoo
but
ugh but
im not a princess
no youre my princess
i tried to keep things professional but
whoo
i was hooked
one hit was never enough
psst sienna
sienna
youre zoning out
i love you
normally id have been more outspoken
about his habit of tempting fate
but he thought he was invincible
and i bought in to the myth
until he had an accident
are you doing okay
that brought us both back to reality
si what if i never
hey
what if i cant fight anymore
were gonna get through this
you dont have to be here
are you crazy
maybe
were a team
yeah
rebel champions
seeing him like that so human
hurting made it all feel real
try to get it parallel to your hip okay
yep
im done
where are you going
whats the point
if i cant kick i cant fight
yes you can jax
if we strengthen your other skills
what other skills
come here
were gonna find you a new edge okay
yeah
he needed me
and thats when i really fell
we were so much more connected
and eventually he came back
better than before
in every way
hey looking good
this is jax leave a message
hey uh so my last client canceled
um im just going to run
to the nutrition shop for you
and i will be right home
thank you
okay
thanks
okay
things were really good
and that feeling
man i was riding the high
but i shouldve known
there would be a comedown
jax beth
sienna
im so sorry
oh shit
no matter how far id fallen
i couldnt get him off my mind
and the worst part
he probably wasnt even
giving me a second thought
hey champ you okay
im good
great job this week
thank you
see you tomorrow boss
next stop
springfield community college
welcome to rock bottom
i needed a new project
somewhere to focus my energy
but id settle for a distraction
so school would have to do
econ 101 was not my fave
but at least i had brent
brents a good guy
hes smart levelheaded
and not fucking my sister
in fact hes all loved up
and getting married in eight weeks
wow thats what i get
for saving you the best seat in the house
i see how it is
you okay
i caught my sister
and my boyfriend of a year
having sex in our apartment
and i spent the night in the gym
beth and jax shit
do you have a place to stay
i cant afford much
theres a wait list for campus housing
i may know a guy renting a room for
like 250 a month
yeah
just um be careful
hes
what an ax murderer
complicated
you spent the night with daniel
jesus alex i was worried sick
he lives in a basement
now im really getting murdery vibes
fuck me
excuse me
oh shit
that was supposed to be my inside voice
um hi
kayden right
brent told me that you might be
looking for a roommate
no
what no
look im in a really tight spot
no offense
oh wow
what
no its just people say that
no offense like itll
absolve them of the guilt
of whatever asshole thing
they were about to say
so what was it you were gonna say
i dont think its gonna be a good fit
look ive been through a lot
i have nowhere else to stay
not my problem
okay fair point
it wasnt his problem
but did he have to be such a jerk
well at least hes upfront about it
jax kept that shit under wraps
till i was far too gone
back to the drawing board
as much as i hated asking for help
maybe julian could give me
a little direction
julian got anyone
on the books for me today
fraid not
everybodys jumping ship
basement brawls
are starting back up at powder keg
more money less rules
and jax is the poster boy
you didnt know
loyalty isnt really his thing
yeah well ever since he stormed out
weve been dying a slow death
and now weve lost our best fighter
how are we supposed to compete with that
well we dont
i would rather lose this gym honestly
than stoop to the underground
i mean its a sport its not worth
getting somebody killed for
kayden the killer williams huh
small world
powder keg was ufgs biggest rival
and the underground operated
out of their basement
nothing feels legal here
because it isnt
youre a trainer ufg huh
there is only one rule
there are no rules
oh man hes out
hey there princess
come to watch me fight
no ive seen enough
hey hey
all right stop
it just
it just happened okay
youre the only one who understands me
i dont understand you at all
please can you help me do that
i dont know you just you got so busy
busy taking care of you
no i didnt mean it like that okay
you know im not good at this stuff
for the last year
its been all about you
figuring out how to rehab your stupid leg
meal prepping for you loving you
making sure that youre good
to fight again
i made a mistake babe
a mistake is forgetting to pick up dinner
fucking my little sister is an act of war
si
5 to 1 odds
deadbeats favored you want in
100 on kayden williams
right
yeah lets go
yeah
yeah
brent what are you doing here
i could ask you the same thing
i uh im here with my fiancé
evans you must be sienna
heard you had a rough week huh
yeah
but its good to finally meet you
unlike my love life
which had been very much on display
brent kept things lowkey
like hed never introduced me
to his fiancé lowkey
kayden the killer williams
ready ready
go fight
how do you know each other again
hes my brother
i didnt know you had a brother
adopted
come here
hes good but hes not unbeatable
he was till tonight
fuck
how do you know him
thats my ex
id give anything for jax
to get a taste of his own medicine
it didnt look like
that was gonna happen tonight
but kayden had promise
police police police
shit shit shit shit
hey its a raid
deadbeat break it up we need to get out
everybodys going
see you later sienna
were not done yet
lets go lets go
everybody out of here
i want my rematch killer
keep walking
come on everybody out
all right lets go
okay i guess this is rock bottom
hopefully
i was out my last hundred bucks
and i couldnt keep sneaking into the gym
i havent tied one on
like that in so long
hey good for you good for you
i had to stop feeling sorry for myself
no more sad girl shit
i was on to that mad girl shit
and i was not about to let
jax get away with this
powder keg was the seventh circle of hell
right after crossfit
but you cant slay a demon
if youre afraid of fire
i thought i told you
i didnt want to see you again
technically you told me
i wasnt your problem
and you were right i am your solution
im good
youre good but youre not great
your reflexes are quick
but youve got poor intention
your defense is spotty
you telegraph your punches
and youre not using
the right hip movement on the mat
to offset someone stronger which he is
and thats why you need me
oh i need you
yeah i am the only person
who can help you beat jax deneris
who said im taking a rematch
i mean
look ive been in the ring
with jax for three years
i stand before you a copy of your enemy
i know how he thinks
how he trains how he kills
i saw you lose and i am the only one
who can make sure
that doesnt happen again
okay what are you offering specifically
i train you six days a week
from now through the rematch
i train every day 365
yeah thats the first thing
ill be changing
you want me to train less
no i want you to train smarter
and rest days are a part of that
and in turn you
let me stay in your apartment
i mean come on
i bet all my money on you last night
so i mean you kind of owe me
all right lucky lets see what you got
well i mean for starters
just keep your eyes a little bit forward
and take that curve out of your neck
just kind of tuck in your lumbar sacrum
your rooms over there
yikes
hey you go to scc too
i didnt get to introduce
myself the other day cara
sienna
want a ride
uh no im good
are you sure cause the bus sucks
and were going to the same place
lets go
shes temperamental
mm
im guessing
i cant link my spotify in this
no
so you lived in springfield
your whole life
and you dont have
any family here or friends
not anymore
whys that
because thats my sister
and thats my exboyfriend
oh
si look i tried to tell you
but youre not the easiest
person to talk to
ive been working my ass off
trying to take care of you
beth i havent been able
to get you to come to school for months
and then youre gonna come together
si im sorry
you dont know what
youre dealing with okay
he is toxic and manipulative
you cant fix him
i already tried
kayden come on cupcake rise and shine
motherfucker
hey asshole we had a deal
hey youre done
listen i gave you
your money back were even
i dont want your handouts okay
i want to win
we had a deal hit me
no
come on
hit me lets go
look i dont want to hurt you
find another project
this is not personal
come on
hit me lets go
all right lets go
come on
it is personal to me
you wanna beat him you just lost
youre mine sienna
i want you all of you
sienna im tapping
sienna
seriously
why does my mind keep going back to jax
you hungry
yeah
hi neighbors the usual
mmhmm
you got it
can i get you anything
five egg whites scrambled
with a side of salsa
half an avocado
and a chicken breast no oil
coming right up
so uh what are you studying
social economics in business
impressive
look this is gonna be really hard
hard
the hardest youll train in your life
dont flatter yourself
i am never dating another fighter
you shouldnt especially me
excuse me
thats what youre eating
nope thats what youre eating
mmm
you know theres no weight class
in the underground right
jax is bigger than me
you dont need to cut
but you should be tracking your macros
pack proteins with isolates
and youd better not be juicing
what else
julian doesnt want
any of his team in the underground
so i come to you at powder keg
you do exactly what i say
no drinking no smoking no partying
no problem
thats a really good burger
i know its my usual
good choice
come on quick feet
keep your abs tight
good to see you stranger
nice to see you too boss
i got a few interesting calls this week
one from a promoter
seeing if you wanted
to fight at the nationals
me
yeah
fight
yeah
im just really busy um
yeah right with all your clients
no i just am taking
20 credits this semester
your sister called
here
yeah she says youre not
answering your phone
yeah my bad
she sounded like
she was seriously concerned
wow thats ironic
you know what
holding onto anger is like drinking poison
and expecting the other person to die
its keeping you from being your best
or maybe its just giving me my edge
get real with yourself sienna
i just think whatever it is
this story that youre telling yourself
its not necessarily reality
okay what are you looking at
dont just defend be first
for every one you give three
no
youre letting your guard down
thats it
no thats not it
defense is not an action
its a given okay
your resting state should be impenetrable
no one gets in no one can hurt you
come on one two
every time someone attacks
they leave an opening
find the opening close for the kill
right hook
find the opening
close for the kill
okay
sienna can i talk to you please
since when do you even work out
i didnt know you were gonna be here
talk to me please
get out of my way beth
no
jax told me to stand up for myself
oh he did
did he also tell you
to do your hair like this
cause it looks like
you fucked the easter bunny
move
i was trying to move on
but talk about triggering
jax had told me
to stand up for myself too
unless it got in the way
of what he wanted
thats all you got
come on
thats it
hit me back
im not gonna hit you back okay
i need you in one piece
if im ever gonna fight
i need to take a hit
who said youre gonna fight
the things you overlook
when youre under their influence
ooh
come on i could be really good
you are good but youre a better trainer
was that your sister
how could you tell
the tension
mm
what
nothing
nothing doesnt sound like nothing
what does it sound like
judgment
i dont know the situation here
no you dont
but family is important
yeah
is that why youre holed up
in a basement alone
stay in your lane
of course i was angry
it was helping me get over jax
and i was getting over him
kinda
sienna
sienna
sienna
good dream
shit
my alarm didnt go off
lets go it is officially confirmed
1000 march 31st
the rematch
mmhmm
okay youre gonna do what i say right
no moody disappearing act or quid pro quo
if you do this ill do that
i know what quid pro quo means
so
yes sensei
good
by the way you talk in your sleep
wed made progress
but if he was gonna have
any chance of beating jax
id need to pull out all the stops
come on
what is this
mixing your ma do you trust me
mmhmm
are you sure
well when you say it like that
okay
this is sensitivity training
the basic theory is
if your breath is grounded in your body
and youre in sync with your opponent
you can overtake them
no matter their size
okay so just feel me
uhhuh nice and easy
breathe
feel my next move
so stay grounded in your body
so no matter what tries to control you
whoa
oh
dont fall off
im not gonna let you fall
youre good
feel my next movement yep yep
thats it thats it
uhhuh uhhuh
nice
again
again
you are a unique trainer sensei lane
i borrowed that exercise from julian
he is a legend
yeah
its big shoes to fill
we talked about me maybe
maybe running the gym with him someday
really
its kind of why im studying business
so i can help
with the books and everything
so you really never considered fighting
of course i did i do
but jax always said i wasnt tough enough
strong enough good enough
mm
looking back i think he didnt want me
to take what was his
the irony
and theres a whole stigma with women
like we shouldnt get punched in the face
because beautys our only asset
whereas men can afford to get busted up
because you guys have
other valued qualities
well not that my opinion
matters for shit
but i support you fighting whatever war
you see as important
inside and outside the cage
i saw jax and beth at the gym
ive done a lot of things
in my life that i regret
but he should know better
hes going to
come on youre letting your guard down
come on kayden stay ahead of him
nice kayden
hes getting better
yeah his timing is improving
come on
thats it find the openings
hit the holes nice
come on
hey princess
you see me fight the other night
ko in 34 seconds
jax stop im working
this is your new guy
come on kayden
yikes thats a step down
hes just sparring
come on let me talk to you for a second
hey
youre too good for this
underground bullshit
you dont belong here
since when do you care
about my wellbeing
what you cant say that
i dont care about you
when i wanted to fight on my own
you didnt believe in me
you shut it down
and then when i tried to
get close to you you cheated
i got scared okay its fight or flight
but i miss you si remember
its you and i against the world
come here stop
kayden protect yourself
keep moving
youre still seeing her
i can stop
shes just easier
easier
i didnt mean it like that
kayden williams is the next champion
and im training him to break you
here hold still
mm
is that okay
mmhmm
whatd jax say
it doesnt matter
all that matters is that we win
what if we dont win
we will
he knows youre a threat
especially now that you have me
jax preys on weakness okay
so if you any
we need to know what they are
and get ahead of them
uhhuh
look what we got
look what we have here
my girlfriend said you were begging
for sloppy seconds
thought she was joking
you know you have a really interesting
definition of girlfriend
if its someone you use
gaslight and cheat on
with her own sister
honestly
not that surprising coming from someone
that dropped out of the big leagues
to fight below their weight class
you dont know shit about me
yeah
yeah there you go
oh
back off deadbeat
oh princess
dont fucking call me that
oh
forgot how sexy you are when youre angry
almost as sexy as your sister
yikes
too much
shit sienna
what the fuck hey
what the fuck get over here
ill fucking kill you
go to hell
jax brought out the worst in me
but it felt good standing up to him
maybe i need to do more for myself
what are you doing i told you i
you convinced yourself
you dont deserve a home i know
so what do you think
belladonna lily or labrador blue
what was benjamin moore out of
doom and gloom gray
yeah as well as brooding beige
hmm what about annoying orange
or relentless red
no they werent
apparently they still have those ones
unfortunate
mmhmm
come here
oh no you wouldnt
i wouldnt
no
you dont think i will
no i dont
i will if you dare me
not even that one no no
you owe me
you brought this upon yourself
come on just a little bit just a little
okay okay a little
you owe it to me
just a little just a little
yeah okay
what
i cant
i cant have any distractions right now
i gotta get my head in the game
i was almost pinned last night
youre right
okay we just need to focus
maybe we should try something different
no absolutely not
you dont understand
how dangerous it is okay
its not a sport its senseless violence
and ufg is above that
if i get caught i lose my license
i lose everything
youre losing now anyway
weve been underwater for months
kayden is the real deal
so why does he fight in the underground
why dont you ask him
julian this is kayden
its an honor
i used to watch all your interviews
without you i
what you wouldnt be
beating up men in basements
yeah but you you opened my eyes
you opened my mind
oh i did
yeah
you taught me that fighting
is about so much more
than just getting the biggest hit in
take a seat
you know martial arts is about joining
your mind body and spirit
its an extension of your education
well i always wanted to go to school
but to be honest
that just wasnt in the cards for me
but id be hiding in the back of a gym
id be on a bus reading anyone
that you mentioned
so why stay underground
its all i know
then why do you need me
because i need to beat jax
and thats where he lives
thats what this is about
he betrayed me and he betrayed you
you have every right to want
sienna i
come on julian
this could really put us back on the map
when kayden wins
hes gonna go legit here
and the fighters
are gonna flock from everywhere
hoping for the same thing
youre gonna have your champ
and a following
my champ and a following
its not about ego
come on
please
we really need your help
i really need your help
let me be clear
i will never support the underground
but i support you
youve gotta choose
are you fighters or whatever this is
because if you train in this gym
it has to be as professionals
mixing business with pleasure
didnt work out for you last time
and in the cage
a fraction of a second of distraction
can get you killed
nice
yes nice
you see how hes coming
come on breathe
hey
sienna
im sorry im late
its okay
im just happy youre here
of course
you actually just missed my mom
shes been dying to meet you
really
yeah kayden may have
mentioned your name once or twice
no pressure no
no pressure
heres the dress we picked
wow
yeah
but one of my bridesmaids
asked if she could design the dresses
good one
gotcha
now this is beautiful
way better right
yes
i thought youd look great
in this neckline
you know what this ones fine
this ones actually better than fine
mm
yep
you didnt care to mention this
i love you both and its my big day
so deal with it okay thank you
look im sorry you feel betrayed
thats not a good way to start an apology
dodging responsibility
okay i am sorry i betrayed you
i know how much you sacrificed
to make sure i was okay
but sienna
it has been so hard living in your shadow
and jax was the first person
to pay attention to me
im just trying to figure out who i am
by what being tied up and degraded
he asks if i want it
but you dont know what you want beth
youre 18
oh and you do
i dont uh no i dont
i know theres a difference
between liking it rough
and manipulating women to serve your ego
you know si its not about you
just stay out of it
beth its not about you either
this is about jax
and the pleasure he gets
from taking our power
he loves me
i knew what she was going through
and that it was gonna get worse
but when youre that far gone
only you can decide
when youre ready for help
you carbloading there lucky
dont worry about it
why arent you at the gym
miss me
i already put in eight hours today
im supposed to take the next 24 off
unless of course you changed your mind
about having a rest day
no definitely not
you okay
great
yeah
uh listen
im here if you want
to talk about anything
its just beth
i swear its like shes living
on another fucking planet
like in what world
does she not see what hes doing
she saw what he did to me
chipping away at my selfesteem
and gaslighting me
uh ill get this one
who is that
its no one
oh come on kayden
i open up to you
and youre still a vault
good to see the dynamic duo
back together again
can i get you anything
i know you two are lowkey
fight clubbing it
and its kind of cool
to know people that are so hard
but do you have to be so hard
on each other
why did it bother me so much
that kayden wouldnt let me in
his whole brooding
mysterious thing was getting to me
but no we were in this to beat jax
it was purely a business transaction
and thats all i wanted
hey
right
sienna
hey sienna
its me
i could have snapped your wrist
were you have you been following me
no yeah uh
im sorry i got mad
i mean dont dont do that
do what
that that that look
what thats my face
i
i know its just
youre the last thing on my mind at night
the first thing in the morning
you are the smartest
strongest most insanely stubborn
beautiful force of a woman
i have ever met
and it kills me knowing
that i cant give you
everything that you deserve
kayden people are allowed to change
grow make mistakes and then move on
whatever it is that youve gone through
thats made the person
standing in front of me
its enough
youre enough
tell me to stop and i will
no way
julians gonna kill us
not if he doesnt know
hell know
um we can just pretend it never happened
if you have regrets or anything
what no
the cheese cheese is still melting
but you should try this
hot
mm
it is my take on migas
mmm
yep
homemade tortilla chips
caramelized onions
peppers eggs
anything really
that i want to put on there
oh you want cilantro
no never
really
you like cilantro
i love cilantro
oh no
you think you know someone
well i didnt know you were such a chef

to be when i was younger

well youre really good at it
when i woke up i realized
i dont want just one night with you
but
no buts
all right go

youre gonna be okay
where is he
he waited
until you were in the clear but
he left you this
ive always known theres danger
in loving someone too much
the daily sacrifices
that turn into so much more
its okay
holding you in my arms
i saw what i was doing to you
and i know that if
when you come back from this
youll continue to put yourself
in my shadow
just as you did with jax
you deserve so much more than that
and i can be a part of holding you back
youre one of the great ones sienna
hey
looks like our roles are reversed huh
you gonna nurse me back to health
if you want
ill be here for you every day
seriously you couldve
saved yourself the trip
no its not actually why im here
but you did ask
you saw an opening
pretty much
cookie
okay
i um
i came to say that im sorry
it was an accident
i didnt see you sienna
and by the time that i did see you
the thought that i couldve killed you
yeah you could have
but i
i forgive you for everything
i love you
no you dont
you took my anger
and you tried to control me with it
and you called that love
and thats not what love is
but that doesnt mean
that you can never find it
you just have to look
inside yourself jax
just try to fix
whats broken inside of you
and stop trying to break other people
to make yourself feel whole
can i ask you something
you think theres still a chance
of what
for me to be redeemed
no one is beyond redemption
but i wouldnt bet my money on it
yeah
youre probably right
it hurt hearing those words
feeling abandoned
but it hurt even more
knowing he was right
the first step in recovery
is admitting you have a problem
i was an addict
id been obsessed with jax
convinced it was love
and my need for revenge
had thrown me even further off track
with kayden it felt different
but i was still fighting for others
when i needed to fight for myself
id lost sight of who i was
what i wanted
i wasnt one to forget
but it cost me nothing to forgive
all right
not gourmet but here you go
thank you
mmhmm
i like your hair
its very me right
yeah
i ended things with jax
well arent you gonna say i told you so
im so proud of you
thanks si
now youve gotta focus on yourself
i am
hey whoa easy there killer
hey im not killer
whatd he call you lucky
exactly its ironic
go again
slow and steady
ill give you a minute
you look good up there
that i was just warming up
heard you were in philly
yeah yeah i have an uncle up there
im glad it worked out for you
i just figured you be better off
if i wasnt here messing everything up
how selfless
i know i know
now i know that running away
was exactly the wrong thing to do
and i was a coward
im sorry
im sorry that i ran away
when you needed me the most
and if you cant forgive me thats okay
i just want whats best for you
i love you sienna
im happy youre fighting
id wish you luck but who needs it when
they got your skills
i read your letter
im not gonna lie i was so mad
but i was just holding on to that anger
towards jax
and it was holding me back
so i dont know
maybe i should be thanking you
well no but um you know what i mean
im not doing the underground
thing anymore
i applied to school in the fall
really
mmhmm
thats really good
yeah
um in philly
springfield
so if you happen to know anyone
with a cheap room to rent
id love a recommendation
hows it going julian
well its still slow
but i appreciate you
leaving me what you did
its not a fight
that i wanted any credit for
but its been keeping my lights on
