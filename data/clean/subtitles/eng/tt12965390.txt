to tell the difference 
i was born a fighter 
but a girl s got bills to pay 
and i didn t have a safety net 
when i wasn t at school  i got a job
training clients for julian james 
the best fighter on this side
of the mississippi
and the only father figure i d ever had 
looks like she s doing all the work 
  keep it up  sienna 
  nice  one more  nice 
now  my sister beth 
she s a lover  and my other half 
i mean  don t get me wrong 
she drives me nuts 
but our friend brent balances us out 
that was the extent of my social circle 
and to be honest  i liked it that way 
  you need to focus 
  i tried  that s all you 
i mean  i have more interests 
i don t have to go to college 
oh  yeah  you know  why 
why would you get a big girl job
when you could just be
mooching off me forever 
  great idea  i like where your head s at 
  ha ha 
  so 
  i m gonna be right back 
  just give me one sec 
  i don t think it s gonna work 
  hey  i m jax 
  hi 
oh  i knew exactly who he was 
sienna  right 
i heard you re a great trainer 
maybe we can get in the ring sometime 
yeah  he was cute 
but he had a reputation 
and i wasn t just gonna let my guard down 
he was a fighter 
 and a lover 
an intoxicating combination 
one  one  two 
two  one  two  two 
jax was the best i d ever trained
and the best fighter ufg had ever had 
nice  it s not just about power  okay 
  it s about precision 
  is that right 
making her mxm debut 
we have standing in the center ring
a mixed martial artist from springfield 
  12 wins by knock out 
  whoo 
sienna  the princess of rage  lane 
  whoo 
  and the crowd goes wild 
whoo 
  but 
  ugh   but  
i m not a princess 
no  you re my princess 
i tried to keep things professional  but 
whoo 
 i was hooked 
one hit was never enough 
psst  sienna 
sienna 
you re zoning out 
i love you 
normally  i d have been more outspoken
about his habit of tempting fate 
but he thought he was invincible 
and i bought in to the myth 
  until he had an accident 
  are you doing okay 
 that brought us both back to reality 
  si  what if i never   
  hey 
what if i can t fight anymore 
we re gonna get through this 
you don t have to be here 
  are you crazy 
  maybe 
  we re a team 
  yeah 
rebel champions 
seeing him like that  so human 
hurting  made it all feel real 
try to get it parallel to your hip  okay 
yep 
i m done 
  where are you going 
  what s the point 
if i can t kick  i can t fight 
yes  you can  jax 
if we strengthen your other skills 
what other skills 
come here 
we re gonna find you a new edge  okay 
yeah 
he needed me 
 and that s when i really fell 
we were so much more connected 
and eventually he came back
better than before
in every way 
hey  looking good 
this is jax  leave a message 
hey  uh  so my last client canceled 
um  i m just going to run
to the nutrition shop for you
and i will be right home 
  thank you 
  okay 
  thanks 
  okay 
things were really good 
and that feeling 
man  i was riding the high 
 but i should ve known
there would be a comedown 
jax  beth 
  sienna 
  i m so sorry 
oh  shit 
no matter how far i d fallen 
i couldn t get him off my mind 
and the worst part 
he probably wasn t even
giving me a second thought 
  hey  champ  you okay 
  i m good 
  great job this week 
  thank you 
see you tomorrow  boss 
next stop 
springfield community college 
welcome to rock bottom 
i needed a new project 
somewhere to focus my energy 
but i d settle for a distraction 
so school would have to do 
econ 101 was not my fave 
but at least i had brent 
brent s a good guy 
he s smart  levelheaded 
and not fucking my sister 
in fact  he s all loved up
and getting married in eight weeks 
wow  that s what i get
for saving you the best seat in the house 
i see how it is 
you okay 
i caught my sister
and my boyfriend of a year
having sex in our apartment 
and i spent the night in the gym 
beth and jax  shit 
do you have a place to stay 
i can t afford much 
there s a wait list for campus housing 
i may know a guy renting a room for 
like  250 a month 
  yeah 
  just  um  be careful 
  he s   
  what  an ax murderer 
complicated 
you spent the night with daniel 
jesus  alex  i was worried sick 
he lives in a basement 
now i m really getting murder y vibes 
  fuck me 
  excuse me 
oh  shit 
that was supposed to be my inside voice 
um  hi 
kayden  right 
brent told me that you might be
looking for a roommate 
  no 
  what  no 
look  i m in a really tight spot 
  no offense   
  oh  wow 
  what 
  no  it s just people say that 
 no offense   like it ll
absolve them of the guilt
of whatever asshole thing
they were about to say 
so what was it you were gonna say 
i don t think it s gonna be a good fit 
look  i ve been through a lot 
i have nowhere else to stay 
not my problem 
okay  fair point 
it wasn t his problem 
but did he have to be such a jerk 
well  at least he s up front about it 
jax kept that shit under wraps
till i was far too gone 
back to the drawing board 
as much as i hated asking for help 
maybe julian could give me
a little direction 
julian  got anyone
on the books for me today 
 fraid not 
everybody s jumping ship 
basement brawls
are starting back up at powder keg 
more money  less rules 
and jax is the poster boy 
you didn t know 
loyalty isn t really his thing 
yeah  well  ever since he stormed out 
we ve been dying a slow death 
and now we ve lost our best fighter 
  how are we supposed to compete with that 
  well  we don t 
i would rather lose this gym honestly
than stoop to the underground 
i mean  it s a sport  it s not worth
getting somebody killed for 
kayden  the killer  williams  huh 
small world 
powder keg was ufg s biggest rival 
and the underground operated
out of their basement 
nothing feels legal here   
because it isn t 
you re a trainer  ufg  huh 
there is only one rule 
there are no rules 
oh  man  he s out 
hey there  princess 
come to watch me fight 
  no  i ve seen enough 
  hey  hey 
  all right  stop 
  it just   
it just happened  okay 
you re the only one who understands me 
i don t understand you at all 
please  can you help me do that 
i don t know  you just    you got so busy 
  busy  taking care of you 
  no  i didn t mean it like that  okay 
  you know i m not good at this stuff 
  for the last year 
it s been all about you 
figuring out how to rehab your stupid leg 
meal prepping for you  loving you 
making sure that you re good
to fight again 
i made a mistake  babe   
a mistake is forgetting to pick up dinner 
fucking my little sister is an act of war 
si   
5 to 1 odds 
deadbeat s favored  you want in 
100 on kayden williams 
right 
yeah  let s go 
  yeah 
  yeah 
brent  what are you doing here 
i could ask you the same thing 
i  uh    i m here with my fiancé 
evans  you must be sienna 
  heard you had a rough week  huh 
  yeah 
but it s good to finally meet you 
unlike my love life 
which had been very much on display 
brent kept things low key 
like  he d never introduced me
to his fiancé low key 
kayden  the killer  williams 
ready  ready 
go  fight 
how do you know each other again 
he s my brother 
i didn t know you had a brother 
adopted 
come here 
he s good  but he s not unbeatable 
he was till tonight 
fuck 
how do you know him 
that s my ex 
i d give anything for jax
to get a taste of his own medicine 
it didn t look like
that was gonna happen tonight 
but kayden had promise 
police  police  police 
  shit  shit  shit  shit 
  hey  it s a raid 
deadbeat  break it up  we need to get out 
  everybody s going 
  see you later  sienna 
  we re not done yet 
  let s go  let s go 
  everybody out of here 
  i want my rematch  killer 
keep walking 
  come on  everybody out 
  all right  let s go 
okay  i guess this is rock bottom 
hopefully 
i was out my last hundred bucks 
and i couldn t keep sneaking into the gym 
i haven t tied one on
like that in so long 
hey  good for you  good for you 
i had to stop feeling sorry for myself 
no more sad girl shit 
i was on to that mad girl shit 
and i was not about to let
jax get away with this 
powder keg was the seventh circle of hell 
right after crossfit 
but you can t slay a demon
if you re afraid of fire 
i thought i told you
i didn t want to see you again 
technically  you told me
i wasn t your problem 
and you were right  i am your solution 
  i m good 
  you re good  but you re not great 
your reflexes are quick 
but you ve got poor intention 
your defense is spotty 
you telegraph your punches 
and you re not using
the right hip movement on the mat
to offset someone stronger  which he is 
  and that s why you need me 
  oh  i need you 
yeah  i am the only person
who can help you beat jax deneris 
who said i m taking a rematch 
i mean 
look  i ve been in the ring
with jax for three years 
i stand before you a copy of your enemy 
i know how he thinks 
how he trains  how he kills 
i saw you lose  and i am the only one
who can make sure
that doesn t happen again 
okay  what are you offering specifically 
i train you six days a week
from now through the rematch 
i train every day  3 6 5 
yeah  that s the first thing
i ll be changing 
you want me to train less 
no  i want you to train smarter 
and rest days are a part of that 
and in turn  you 
let me stay in your apartment 
i mean  come on 
i bet all my money on you last night 
so  i mean  you kind of owe me 
all right  lucky  let s see what you got 
well  i mean  for starters 
just keep your eyes a little bit forward
and take that curve out of your neck 
just kind of tuck in your lumbar sacrum 
your room s over there 
yikes 
hey  you go to scc too 
i didn t get to introduce
myself the other day  cara 
sienna 
  want a ride 
  uh  no  i m good 
are you sure   cause the bus sucks 
and we re going to the same place 
let s go 
  she s temperamental 
  mm 
i m guessing
i can t link my spotify in this 
no 
so  you lived in springfield
your whole life
and you don t have
any family here or friends 
  not anymore 
  why s that 
because that s my sister
and that s my ex boyfriend 
oh 
si  look  i tried to tell you 
but you re not the easiest
person to talk to 
i ve been working my ass off
trying to take care of you 
beth  i haven t been able
to get you to come to school for months 
and then you re gonna come together 
si  i m sorry   
you don t know what
you re dealing with  okay 
he is toxic and manipulative 
you can t fix him 
i already tried 
kayden  come on  cupcake  rise and shine 
motherfucker 
hey  asshole  we had a deal 
hey  you re done 
listen  i gave you
your money back  we re even 
i don t want your handouts  okay 
i want to win 
we had a deal  hit me 
  no 
  come on 
hit me  let s go 
look  i don t want to hurt you 
find another project 
this is not personal 
come on 
hit me  let s go 
all right  let s go 
come on 
it is personal to me 
you wanna beat him  you just lost 
you re mine  sienna 
i want you  all of you 
sienna  i m tapping 
sienna 
seriously 
why does my mind keep going back to jax 
you hungry 
yeah 
hi  neighbors  the usual 
  mm hmm 
  you got it 
can i get you anything 
five egg whites  scrambled 
with a side of salsa 
half an avocado 
and a chicken breast  no oil 
coming right up 
so  uh  what are you studying 
social economics in business 
impressive 
look  this is gonna be really hard 
hard 
the hardest you ll train in your life 
don t flatter yourself 
i am never dating another fighter 
you shouldn t  especially me 
  excuse me 
  that s what you re eating 
nope  that s what you re eating 
mmm 
you know there s no weight class
in the underground  right 
jax is bigger than me 
you don t need to cut 
but you should be tracking your macros 
pack proteins with isolates 
and you d better not be juicing 
what else 
julian doesn t want
any of his team in the underground 
so i come to you at powder keg 
you do exactly what i say 
no drinking  no smoking  no partying 
no problem 
that s a really good burger 
i know  it s my usual 
good choice 
come on  quick feet 
keep your abs tight 
good to see you  stranger 
nice to see you too  boss 
i got a few interesting calls this week 
one from a promoter
seeing if you wanted
to fight at the nationals 
  me 
  yeah 
  fight 
  yeah 
i m just really busy  um 
yeah  right  with all your clients 
no  i just am taking
20 credits this semester 
  your sister called 
  here 
yeah  she says you re not
answering your phone 
yeah  my bad 
she sounded like
she was seriously concerned 
wow  that s ironic 
you know what 
holding onto anger is like drinking poison
and expecting the other person to die 
it s keeping you from being your best 
or maybe it s just giving me my edge 
get real with yourself  sienna 
i just think whatever it is 
this story that you re telling yourself 
it s not necessarily reality 
okay  what are you looking at 
don t just defend  be first 
for every one  you give three 
no 
you re letting your guard down 
  that s it 
  no  that s not it 
defense is not an action 
it s a given  okay 
your resting state should be impenetrable 
no one gets in  no one can hurt you 
come on  one  two 
every time someone attacks 
they leave an opening 
find the opening  close for the kill 
right hook 
find the opening 
 close for the kill 
okay 
sienna  can i talk to you  please 
since when do you even work out 
i didn t know you were gonna be here 
talk to me  please 
  get out of my way  beth 
  no 
  jax told me to stand up for myself 
  oh  he did 
did he also tell you
to do your hair like this 
 cause it looks like
you fucked the easter bunny 
move 
i was trying to move on 
but talk about triggering 
jax had told me
to stand up for myself  too 
unless it got in the way
of what he wanted 
  that s all you got 
  come on 
  that s it 
  hit me back 
i m not gonna hit you back  okay 
i need you in one piece 
if i m ever gonna fight 
i need to take a hit 
who said you re gonna fight 
the things you overlook
when you re under their influence 
ooh 
come on  i could be really good 
you are good  but you re a better trainer 
was that your sister 
how could you tell 
the tension 
mm 
  what 
  nothing 
nothing  doesn t sound like nothing 
  what does it sound like 
  judgment 
  i don t know the situation here 
  no  you don t 
   but family is important 
  yeah 
is that why you re holed up
in a basement alone 
stay in your lane 
of course i was angry 
it was helping me get over jax 
and i was getting over him 
kinda 
sienna 
sienna 
sienna 
good dream 
shit 
my alarm didn t go off 
let s go  it is officially confirmed 
10 00  march 31st 
  the rematch 
  mm hmm 
okay  you re gonna do what i say  right 
no moody disappearing act or quid pro quo 
 if you do this  i ll do that  
i know what quid pro quo means 
  so 
  yes  sensei 
good 
by the way  you talk in your sleep 
we d made progress 
but if he was gonna have
any chance of beating jax
i d need to pull out all the stops 
  come on 
  what is this 
mixing your ma  do you trust me 
  mm hmm 
  are you sure 
well  when you say it like that 
okay 
this is sensitivity training 
the basic theory is
if your breath is grounded in your body
and you re in sync with your opponent 
you can overtake them
no matter their size 
okay  so just feel me 
uh huh  nice and easy 
breathe 
feel my next move 
so  stay grounded in your body
so no matter what tries to control you 
  whoa 
  oh 
  don t fall off 
  i m not gonna let you fall 
you re good 
feel my next movement  yep  yep 
that s it  that s it 
uh huh  uh huh 
nice 
  again 
  again 
you are a unique trainer  sensei lane 
i borrowed that exercise from julian 
  he is a legend 
  yeah 
it s big shoes to fill 
we talked about me maybe   
maybe running the gym with him someday 
really 
it s kind of why i m studying business
so i can help
with the books and everything 
so you really never considered fighting 
of course i did  i do 
but jax always said i wasn t tough enough 
  strong enough  good enough 
  mm 
looking back  i think he didn t want me
to take what was his 
the irony 
and there s a whole stigma with women
like we shouldn t get punched in the face
because beauty s our only asset 
whereas men can afford to get busted up
because you guys have
other valued qualities 
well  not that my opinion
matters for shit 
but i support you fighting whatever war
you see as important 
inside and outside the cage 
i saw jax and beth at the gym 
i ve done a lot of things
in my life that i regret 
 but he should know better 
he s going to 
come on  you re letting your guard down 
come on  kayden  stay ahead of him 
  nice  kayden 
  he s getting better 
yeah  his timing is improving 
come on 
that s it  find the openings 
hit the holes  nice 
  come on 
  hey  princess 
you see me fight the other night 
ko in 34 seconds 
jax  stop  i m working 
  this is your new guy 
  come on  kayden 
yikes  that s a step down 
he s just sparring 
come on  let me talk to you for a second 
hey 
you re too good for this
underground bullshit 
you don t belong here 
since when do you care
about my well being 
what  you can t say that
i don t care about you 
when i wanted to fight on my own 
you didn t believe in me 
you shut it down 
and then when i tried to
get close to you  you cheated 
i got scared  okay  it s fight or flight 
but i miss you  si  remember 
it s you and i against the world 
come here  stop 
kayden  protect yourself 
keep moving 
  you re still seeing her 
  i can stop 
she s just easier 
  easier 
  i didn t mean it like that 
kayden williams is the next champion 
and i m training him to break you 
  here  hold still 
  mm 
  is that okay 
  mm hmm 
  what d jax say 
  it doesn t matter 
all that matters is that we win 
  what if we don t win 
  we will 
he knows you re a threat 
especially now that you have me 
jax preys on weakness  okay 
so if you any 
we need to know what they are
  and get ahead of them 
  uh huh 
  look what we got 
  look what we have here 
my girlfriend said you were begging
for sloppy seconds 
  thought she was joking 
  you know  you have a really interesting
definition of girlfriend 
if it s someone you use 
gaslight  and cheat on
with her own sister 
honestly 
not that surprising coming from someone
that dropped out of the big leagues
to fight below their weight class 
  you don t know shit about me 
  yeah 
  yeah  there you go 
  oh 
  back off  deadbeat 
  oh  princess 
  don t fucking call me that 
  oh 
forgot how sexy you are when you re angry 
almost as sexy as your sister 
yikes 
too much 
shit  sienna 
what the fuck  hey 
what the fuck  get over here 
i ll fucking kill you 
go to hell 
jax brought out the worst in me 
but it felt good standing up to him 
maybe i need to do more for myself 
what are you doing  i told you  i   
you convinced yourself
you don t deserve a home  i know 
so  what do you think 
belladonna lily or labrador blue 
what  was benjamin moore out of
doom and gloom gray 
yeah  as well as brooding beige 
hmm  what about annoying orange
or relentless red 
no  they weren t 
apparently  they still have those ones 
  unfortunate 
  mm hmm 
come here 
  oh  no  you wouldn t 
  i wouldn t 
  no 
  you don t think i will 
  no  i don t 
  i will if you dare me 
  not even that one  no  no 
  you owe me 
you brought this upon yourself 
come on  just a little bit  just a little 
  okay  okay  a little 
  you owe it to me 
  just a little  just a little 
  yeah  okay 
what 
i can t 
i can t have any distractions right now 
i gotta get my head in the game 
i was almost pinned last night 
you re right 
okay  we just need to focus 
maybe we should try something different 
no  absolutely not 
you don t understand
how dangerous it is  okay 
it s not a sport  it s senseless violence 
and ufg is above that 
if i get caught  i lose my license 
i lose everything 
you re losing now anyway 
we ve been underwater for months 
kayden is the real deal 
so why does he fight in the underground 
why don t you ask him 
julian  this is kayden 
it s an honor 
i used to watch all your interviews 
without you  i   
what  you wouldn t be
beating up men in basements 
yeah  but you    you opened my eyes 
you opened my mind 
  oh  i did 
  yeah 
you taught me that fighting
is about so much more
than just getting the biggest hit in 
take a seat 
you know  martial arts is about joining
your mind  body  and spirit 
it s an extension of your education 
well  i always wanted to go to school 
but to be honest 
that just wasn t in the cards for me 
but i d be hiding in the back of a gym 
i d be on a bus reading anyone
that you mentioned 
so why stay underground 
  it s all i know 
  then why do you need me 
because i need to beat jax 
and that s where he lives 
that s what this is about 
he betrayed me  and he betrayed you 
  you have every right to want   
  sienna  i   
come on  julian 
this could really put us back on the map 
when kayden wins 
he s gonna go legit here 
and the fighters
are gonna flock from everywhere
hoping for the same thing 
you re gonna have your champ
and a following 
my champ and a following 
it s not about ego 
come on 
please 
we really need your help 
i really need your help 
let me be clear 
i will never support the underground 
but i support you 
you ve gotta choose 
are you fighters or whatever this is 
because if you train in this gym 
it has to be as professionals 
mixing business with pleasure
didn t work out for you last time 
and in the cage 
a fraction of a second of distraction
can get you killed 
nice 
yes  nice 
  you see how he s coming 
  come on  breathe 
  hey 
  sienna 
  i m sorry i m late 
  it s okay 
  i m just happy you re here 
  of course 
you actually just missed my mom 
she s been dying to meet you 
  really 
  yeah  kayden may have
mentioned your name once or twice 
  no pressure  no 
  no pressure 
here s the dress we picked 
  wow 
  yeah 
but one of my bridesmaids
asked if she could design the dresses 
  good one 
  gotcha 
  now this is beautiful 
  way better  right 
yes 
i thought you d look great
in this neckline 
you know what  this one s fine 
this one s actually better than fine 
  mm 
  yep 
you didn t care to mention this 
i love you both  and it s my big day 
so deal with it  okay  thank you 
look  i m sorry you feel betrayed   
that s not a good way to start an apology 
dodging responsibility 
okay  i am sorry i betrayed you 
i know how much you sacrificed
to make sure i was okay 
but  sienna 
it has been so hard living in your shadow 
and jax was the first person
to pay attention to me 
i m just trying to figure out who i am 
by what  being tied up and degraded 
he asks if i want it 
but you don t know what you want  beth 
  you re 18 
  oh  and you do 
i don t  uh  no  i don t 
i know there s a difference
between liking it rough
and manipulating women to serve your ego 
you know  si  it s not about you 
just stay out of it 
beth  it s not about you either 
this is about jax
and the pleasure he gets
from taking our power 
he loves me 
i knew what she was going through
and that it was gonna get worse 
but when you re that far gone 
only you can decide
when you re ready for help 
you carb loading there  lucky 
don t worry about it 
why aren t you at the gym 
  miss me 
  i already put in eight hours today 
i m supposed to take the next 24 off 
unless  of course  you changed your mind
about having a rest day 
no  definitely not 
you okay 
  great 
  yeah 
uh  listen 
i m here if you want
to talk about anything 
it s just beth 
i swear  it s like she s living
on another fucking planet 
like  in what world
does she not see what he s doing 
she saw what he did to me 
chipping away at my self esteem
and gaslighting me 
uh  i ll get this one 
  who is that 
  it s no one 
oh  come on  kayden 
i open up to you 
and you re still a vault 
good to see the dynamic duo
back together again 
can i get you anything 
i know you two are low key
fight clubbing it 
and it s kind of cool
to know people that are so hard 
but do you have to be so hard
on each other 
why did it bother me so much
that kayden wouldn t let me in 
his whole brooding 
mysterious thing was getting to me 
but  no  we were in this to beat jax 
it was purely a business transaction 
and that s all i wanted 
  hey 
  right 
sienna 
hey  sienna 
it s me 
i could have snapped your wrist 
were you    have you been following me 
no  yeah  uh   
i m sorry i got mad 
i mean  don t  don t do that 
  do what 
  that  that    that look 
  what  that s my face 
  i 
i know  it s just 
you re the last thing on my mind at night 
the first thing in the morning 
you are the smartest 
strongest  most insanely stubborn 
beautiful force of a woman
i have ever met 
and it kills me knowing
that i can t give you
everything that you deserve 
kayden  people are allowed to change 
 grow  make mistakes  and then move on 
whatever it is that you ve gone through
that s made the person
standing in front of me 
it s enough 
you re enough 
tell me to stop and i will 
no way 
julian s gonna kill us 
not if he doesn t know 
he ll know 
um  we can just pretend it never happened
if you have regrets or anything 
what  no 
the cheese    cheese is still melting 
but you should try this 
  hot

she raised me by herself 
she worked three jobs
to keep food on the table 
and i was just a piece of shit 
one night  i got really drunk at a party 
and  uh  she left work to come find me 
and on the way
she got hit by a drunk driver 
  and just like that  gone 
  you couldn t have known   
and everything that she did for me 
that s how i repaid her 
now i m just a high school dropout
that gets beat up in
underground fights for money 
she d be really proud of that 
wouldn t she 
what do you want from me  sienna 
i put everything that i have
into these fights 
everything  what do you want 
 cause i have nothing left to give

it keeps you chasing that asshole 
excuse me 
you think you re so tough 
but you re just hiding 
oh  says    says the brave hero
just locked up in a basement
haunted by his own ghost waiting to die 
you forced your way into my life 
i didn t ask for that

i thought you came to fight  killer

killer s back on his feet

  nice  off the cage

killer

sienna  come on 
please  please  please  don t do this 
fuck  man  fuck 
call an ambulance  call an ambulance 
dr  robertson to the er immediately 
you guys  she s up 
sienna  can you hear me 
it s beth  i m right here 
you ve been out for  like  three days 
can we    can we get you anything 
go on your honeymoon 
we got her  go  it s fine 
  you re gonna be okay 
  where is he 
he waited
until you were in the clear  but 
he left you this 
i ve always known there s danger
in loving someone too much 
the daily sacrifices
that turn into so much more 
it s okay 
holding you in my arms 
i saw what i was doing to you 
and i know that if   
when you come back from this 
you ll continue to put yourself
in my shadow
just as you did with jax 
you deserve so much more than that 
and i can be a part of holding you back 
you re one of the great ones  sienna 
hey 
looks like our roles are reversed  huh 
you gonna nurse me back to health 
if you want 
i ll be here for you every day 
seriously  you could ve
saved yourself the trip 
no  it s not actually why i m here 
but you did ask 
  you saw an opening 
  pretty much 
cookie 
okay 
i  um 
i came to say that i m sorry 
it was an accident 
i didn t see you  sienna 
and by the time that i did see you 
the thought that i could ve killed you 
yeah  you could have 
but i 
i forgive you for everything 
  i love you 
  no  you don t 
you took my anger 
and you tried to control me with it 
and you called that love 
and that s not what love is 
but that doesn t mean
that you can never find it 
you just have to look
inside yourself  jax 
just try to fix
what s broken inside of you
and stop trying to break other people
to make yourself feel whole 
can i ask you something 
you think there s still a chance 
of what 
for me to be redeemed 
no one is beyond redemption 
but i wouldn t bet my money on it 
yeah 
you re probably right 
it hurt  hearing those words 
feeling abandoned 
but it hurt even more
knowing he was right 
the first step in recovery
is admitting you have a problem 
i was an addict 
i d been obsessed with jax 
convinced it was love 
and my need for revenge
had thrown me even further off track 
with kayden it felt different 
but i was still fighting for others
when i needed to fight for myself 
i d lost sight of who i was 
what i wanted 
i wasn t one to forget 
but it cost me nothing to forgive 
all right 
  not gourmet  but here you go 
  thank you 
  mm hmm 
  i like your hair 
  it s very me  right 
  yeah 
i ended things with jax 
well  aren t you gonna say i told you so 
i m so proud of you 
thanks  si 
now you ve gotta focus on yourself 
i am 
hey  whoa  easy there  killer 
hey  i m not killer 
  what d he call you  lucky 
  exactly  it s ironic 
  go again 
  slow and steady 
i ll give you a minute 
  you look good up there 
  that  i was just warming up 
heard you were in philly 
yeah  yeah  i have an uncle up there 
i m glad it worked out for you 
i just figured you be better off
if i wasn t here messing everything up 
  how selfless 
  i know  i know 
now i know that running away
was exactly the wrong thing to do 
and i was a coward 
i m sorry 
i m sorry that i ran away
when you needed me the most 
and if you can t forgive me  that s okay 
i just want what s best for you 
i love you  sienna 
i m happy you re fighting 
i d wish you luck  but who needs it when
they got your skills 
i read your letter 
i m not gonna lie  i was so mad 
but i was just holding on to that anger
towards jax 
and it was holding me back 
so  i don t know 
maybe i should be thanking you 
well  no  but  um  you know what i mean 
i m not doing the underground
thing anymore 
i applied to school in the fall 
  really 
  mm hmm 
  that s really good 
  yeah 
um  in philly 
springfield 
so if you happen to know anyone
with a cheap room to rent 
i d love a recommendation 
how s it going  julian 
well  it s still slow 
but i appreciate you
leaving me what you did 
it s not a fight
that i wanted any credit for 
but it s been keeping my lights on
