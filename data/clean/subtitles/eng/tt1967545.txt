engine starting
adult henry it was just the two
of us after my father left
he said i should count
the new baby he had
with his new wife marjorie
as part of my family too
plus richard marjories son
for the most part my mother
never mentioned my father
or the woman he was married to now
gerald you could always come
live with marjorie and me
i mean if that was something you
wanted we can have her evaluated
no mom is great
shes learning to play the cello
i just asked because
i get the feeling her
sighs that shes getting worse
adult henry i dont think losing
my father broke my mothers heart
but rather losing love itself
even at that age i understood this
and wanted to make up for
some of the neglect
adele oh what did you do
you made all this for me
mmmhmm
adele husband for a day
adult henry
i made her a coupon book
i cleaned
one week of clean dishes
did little chores around the house
handyman
there was a coupon
for a shoulder rub
a bubble bath
i even took her on a date
a man should know how to dance
when a man can dance
the world is his oyster
some men just set their hand on
your shoulder or against your back
but there has to be
strong pressure there
adult henry at the time
i was too young to understand
the part of being husband for a day
i was not equipped to carry out
but i sensed my own
terrible inadequacy
i could feel her loneliness and
longing before i had a name for it
bank teller
hey henry hows your mother
fine
i hope to see her in
here one of these days
adult henry i understood
who my real family was
exhales
her
engine stops
even if that meant
only leaving the house once a month
to pick up supplies at pricemart
i think its this way
is it all right if i go
check out the comics
um
okay just dont wander
ill be right over there
i wonder if you could
give me a hand here
youre bleeding
yeah well i fell out a window
we should get help
no i wouldnt want
to upset anyone
did you come here with
that woman over there
my mom
she looks like the kind of
person that could help me
i i dont know
what i want to ask is
you think shed give me a ride
hmm
this is my mother adele
mom this is frank
he needs our help
you got a good boy here adele
he was kind enough
to offer me a ride
oh
um
well he may have but
we have a big afternoon
i dont think we can help you
well thats a shame
i thought we could have a catch
i suck at baseball
hey
maybe you used to
dont you throw around
a ball with your dad
i only see him on sundays
oh
adele no im sorry
i wont be any trouble
we really stammers
cant help you
frank frankly
this needs to happen
beeping
oh here why dont
you get in back
sighs
where do you want to go
your house
just for a few moments
to rest my legs
siren wailing
door closes
youll have to excuse the mess
weve been busy
nice place
adele
how do you uh take your coffee
as is
how did you hurt your leg
sighs
im going to be straight
with you here henry
im not going to lie
i hurt my leg jumping out of a
second floor window at a hospital
theyd taken me to to
get my appendix out
at the prison
thats how i got out
when
this morning
you escaped
so now the police
are looking for you
i would have gotten further
except for the damn leg
water boiling
cutlery clanks
id be grateful if you let
me stay till nightfall
id try and help out
i wouldnt ask anything of you
you just did
nothing more than a place to lay low
and rest my leg for a few hours
how do i
how do i know you wont hurt us
ive never intentionally
hurt anyone in my life
you understand how that
could be hard to believe
yeah i do
how far are the train
tracks from your backyard
running
limping
twenty minutes maybe
people come over often randomly
friends salesmen
religious people
ill make a run for it tonight and i
can stay out of your way until then
i mean theyd notice
if i went quiet
even for a little bit
i just escaped from prison
the last place
i want to go is back
im stronger than you think
i dont doubt that
and i wont let anything
happen to my son
hes in good hands
panting
anchorwoman on tv
welcome back to action news
commuters may have
experienced delays
on their drive home this afternoon
roadblocks on route 73
who are police looking for
frank chambers an inmate
at stinchfield prison
who escaped earlier this morning
male reporter
captain where is frank chambers
considering his injuries
we believe he hasnt gotten far
now keep in mind that he is
dangerous and quite possibly armed
anchorwoman chambers was
recovering from appendicitis
on the second floor
of this hospital
when police say he just
made a jump for it
um i went to check on him and the next
thing i knew he was out the window
authorities would like
to remind our viewers
that this kind of leap
can spell desperation
especially in an inmate
serving 18 years for murder
anchorman coming up next
on the channel 7 news
the hottest day in 11
years in new hampshire
didnt happen that way
isnt it against the law
to hide a fugitive
you got a wise son here adele
its good to know hes
looking out for you
its all going to be fine
it would only be a problem
if someone found frank here
and that doesnt need to happen
he can just lay low for a few
hours and then keep moving
thats true enough
its still not acceptable to place you
and your family here in jeopardy
if someone were to come by it would
need to look like i kidnapped you
thats why im going
to have to tie you up
its about keeping up appearances
i think you understand what i mean
who are you going to
only you
henry here knows he doesnt want
anything to happen to his mother
right henry
hmm
open these
simmering
grab a bowl
blowing
adele i dont suppose your father
has told you anything about sex
most people put all this focus
on the physical changes
youll be going through soon
henry its okay
they explained everything
in a health assembly
well theres another aspect that your
health teacher is unlikely to explore
people act as if making love is all
about secretions and body functions
mom its okay
for all the discussions of
body parts and hormones
they forget to mention
how it feels
theres another kind of hunger
the hunger for human touch
desire
people never tell you
about how it feels
the longing
what time do the trains
start in the morning
i dont know
ill just have to keep an
ear out for them i guess
slurps
frank
i dont blame you for wondering
just know that theres more to this story
than youll see in that paper there
how did you escape
i told the guard at the hospital if he
left i was going to jump out the window
he heard that and
went to have a smoke
nothing misleads
people like the truth
you have any brothers or sisters
stammers no my mom tried but
ive got a stepbrother
and a halfsister
my dad takes me out to
dinner with them on sundays
how does a fellow let a woman
like your mother get away
he got together with his secretary
good riddance
good morning
we wont be needing
that any longer
but if the day comes and you have to
say i tied you up you wont be lying
havent heard any trains go by
holiday weekend
breakfast
you have to try one
okay
soft music playing
frank hey give me a
threequarterinch ratchet wrench
ratchet wrench
adult henry that day
frank changed the oil in the car
and replaced the fuse
for the blinkers
then he replaced the
filter on the furnace
he checked out the cord of
firewood that just got delivered
and informed my mom that
the guy was shorting her
then he washed the
floor and waxed it
frank then you rotate the ball
grip it loose
two fingers up top
thumb on the bottom
just let it rest there
barely tight enough to hold
and when you release
snap your wrist down like a whip
just crack
and then you grab those seams
when the ball leaves your fingers
you bite your lip when you sew
exhales softly
im trying not to stick you
howd you get that scar
adele chuckles
stars and stripes forever
routine for my dance recital
halfway through rehearsal
they got rid of the ramp
i tapped myself right
off the stage
pounding on door
come here come here
answer the door hank
let them know your mothers out
and i trust youre not gonna
get nervous and say something
now go
oh
hi henry i was looking
for your mother
stammers im sorry
mr jervis shes not home
oh well thats
thats not like her
has she been following
the news do you know
did she leave you here by yourself
no i just mean she
cant come to the door
shes taking a bath
mr jervis oh
are those for her
yeah i had so many i didnt
know what to do with them
i thought your mother
might like them
thank you
im sure shell appreciate them
let her know theres something
id like to discuss with her
is everything okay
mr jervis well uh
look henry i dont know if youve
heard but theres a guy loose
broke out of stinchfield
hes probably long gone
by now but till they find him
i wouldnt be opening the
door without an adult
thank you for telling me
look i doubt hes
anywhere near here by now
just remember im right
across the street
you have any problems
just give me a jingle
adele panting
he had more than he needed
you did good hank
um
henry why dont you
go check on joe
im sure hes fine
its a hot day
make sure his water
hasnt dried up
yeah
you cant do that again
what what did i do
my son is not your lookout
hes not your accomplice
and i dont
it was just a neighbor
it doesnt matter
dont forget whats going on here
not for a second
now i see the way he looks at you
what he wants
that encouragement
pat on his shoulder
and i want it for him
but not for that
i cant promise whats going
to show up at the door
i know
okay then
exhales
its a good peach
its too bad theyre all so ripe
youll never get through them all
we should throw most of
them away before they rot
no i have another idea
take a peach
henry thank you
frank now the filling is easy
what i want to talk about is crust
youve got to keep
your ingredients cool
hot day like this is
challenge enough
the phone rings while youre making
a crust just let them call you back
mix it up
sighs
pie crust is a very
forgiving thing forks
you can make all kinds of mistakes
but dont forget the salt
adele all of it
frank yeah before it gets too warm
keep everything cool
then mix it up
take that knife
its all about instinct
pay too much attention to
recipes you forget how to feel
its like reading a
book on gardening
when all youve got to do is get
dirt underneath your fingernails
all right put it in there
thats it
now dont overhandle
you want it right on the verge
of crumbling at any moment
there you go
now grab the outside
heel of the hand
people buy all these fancy gadgets
but sometimes the best tool is
attached right there to your own body
okay
scatter a little tapioca
like salt over an icy road
cure for a soggy crust
the whole thing
make a little mountain out of it
perfect
okay moment of truth
cant go too fast
you cant hesitate
adult henry
i dont know when my moms hands
started shaking exactly
but eventually it was
beyond her control
trembling
help me put a roof on this house
perfect
beeping
train whistle blowing in the distance
i should go
they wont come back
for a few hours
this is as good a window
as im gonna get
maybe tomorrow
once your stitches have
had a little more time
theyre not going to
stop looking adele
henry they have dogs that
can smell your blood
you should probably let
your stitches heal
you should stay
adele
thank you im really nervous
you have to
frank i understand
well just lay here a while
adele we havent had anybody in
this house for such a long time
let me get my
adele and frank moaning
adult henry rhythm
this was the word that
burrowed into my brain
as i listened to their late night
conversation quietly dissipate
i thought about
that word rhythm
and whether my mom
thought frank had it
these were the images
i returned to at night
particularly now that the
evening was no longer silent
moaning continues
adult henry the next day frank
fixed the loose floorboard on the stairs
squeaking
he got the squeak out
of the kitchen door
then cleared the debris
out of the gutters
thank you
ill tell you this
you dont want to wait
to learn to fix it
especially if you got a lady in the
seat beside you when it happens
adult henry
they did laundry he ironed
and in return my mom
taught him to rumba
two three four
shift your weight this way
two three four
adult henry
for lunch frank thought
it only right that we
fire up the barbecue
so he sent me to
pick up groceries
bell jingling
you know drinking from
aluminum gives you alzheimers
is that true
uhhuh
its the perfect crime
cause you cant
remember how you got it
is there anything
to do in this town
theres bowling
bowling
grocer if you ask me i think
hes holing up in someones house
waiting for things to cool down
shopper i just cant get
his face out of my head
the worst part is knowing that a
man like that has nothing to lose
life to a person like that
is worth about 10 cents
theyll get him eventually
they always do
henry hows your mother
shes doing great
wheres all the canned goods
you usually buy like youre
planning for a tornado
yeah special recipe
henry this is a mans razor

adele you were so young
why didnt you appeal
frank i dont know i thought
i got what i deserved
adele but you dont feel that now
frank no now it doesnt matter
you couldnt take a lot
might seem suspicious
adele we just start driving
just like that
frank you couldnt tell
any of your friends
adele no one to tell really
i cant imagine you not being free
frank i cant call myself free until i can
walk down the street arm around you
id like that
frank take you on road trips
to places we dont know a soul
adele chuckles like on the run
frank mmmhmm
thats right on the run
my exhusband would never
let me take henry away
frank
you know what that would mean
adele i know
frank all right then
i noticed a spot under the shower
where the water is finding
its way under the linoleum
you dont want dry rot
ill tackle that tomorrow okay
adele maybe it doesnt matter
what do you want to do
henry i dont know
eleanor i think you know
come on
just say it
eleanor whats the matter
frank is it cold
adele youre a tough guy
i think you could take it
frank
is it too cold to grow things
adele its mostly farms
frank it sounds nice
morning sport
hey
howd you sleep
fine
um i was wondering if you
could do me a little favor
top secret research
research
just a trip to the library to pick
up a book on prince edward island
frank
your mom says its beautiful
adele
can you pick up the book hank
so do you go to
school around here
stammers
im sorry i didnt mean to
eleanor
i just moved here from chicago
im supposed to try out
living with my dad this year
oh
what happened
the official reason is
i have an eating disorder
and they think a new school
environment will help
but really i think my mom
just wanted to get rid of me
so she can fool around
with her boyfriend
i understand
this guy he just moved
in with my mom and me
and now he wants you out
i dont think so
eleanor he will
so they can have sex
so what are you reading
im investigating my legal rights
you see i got into this
really great private school
where they only focus on drama
no one cares about sports or
what kind of clothes you wear
the teachers stay off your case
its really elevated
but at the last minute my parents
decided they didnt have the money
could they get a loan
oh they have the money
theyre just using me as a
pawn in their sick little game
whats that
its for my mother
she wants to know if canada
might be a good place to move
and how do you feel about that
moving leaving your friends
im asking because
thats what i had to do
and frankly
i consider it child abuse
i dont know canada seems nice
do you even know if
theyre taking you
my mom wouldnt leave me behind
when people have sex
it affects their brains
they cant see things normally
its like a drug
im not sure if thats true
well youre probably gonna
need an intervention
maybe even need to deprogram her
deprogram her
yeah
this guy
does he have charisma
maybe
too bad your mom and my
dad couldnt get together
before this whole boyfriend
person showed up
but then if you and i got married
itd be kind of like incest
my mother doesnt
normally date anyway
i see only one hope for you
you need to find a way to
get him out of your life
i dont know if thats possible
either you get rid of him or hes
probably going to get rid of you
jerry lewis on tv all these
people here love you a lot
a lot of them dont even
know you and they love you
because you represent so very much
but im very very proud that
i could put this show on for you
and i hope next year
we can do better
so that you can sit in
a different position
we love you mikey
neufeldt god bless you
audience applauding on tv

little more meat on those bones huh
actually i was thinking of signing
up for modern dance group
well im not sure that
would be such a good move
i know how your mother
feels about dancing
but people might get
the wrong idea
they might think
they might think youre gay
marjorie richie
or they might think
i like girls in tights
both chuckle
you boys are reaching
that stage of life
probably time for us to have a
little mantoman conversation
i already had that
with my real dad
i guess that just
leaves you and me
its okay im up to speed
well im sure your mother
gave you the basics
but there are some things a
guy needs to hear from a man
marjorie it can be difficult not
having a man around the house
who says i dont
sighs before you know it you two
boys will be going out on dates
a couple of ladykillers
if i was still in seventh grade
id think you two were the cutest
gross if you were still in seventh
grade i wouldnt even be born
not to mention itd be incest
were you serious
about a guy hanging
around the house
what do you care
hey
youre my kid id like
to know whos around
thanks

gerald bye pal
car door closes
upbeat music playing
frank henry your mom
is some kind of dancer
most people wouldnt tackle the
chacha in this kind of weather
henry yeah it was a little loud
exhales its just music
i just figured we were
trying to avoid attention
oh come on hank
you can have the next dance
music stops
im going to go to bed
henry wait
um
theres something we wanted
to talk to you about
sighs
after your father left i thought
i would be alone forever
i didnt think i would care
about anyone else besides you
im really happy for you
were thinking canada might be
a good place to start over
canada
they speak english
and you dont need passports
to get across the border
thanks for the research bud
weve decided to go together
will i ever see you again
what are you talking about
do you even care about
what happens to me
adele what
you didnt think
were all going
really
i would never leave you
you would have to leave school
and you couldnt tell anyone okay
we would just pack the car and go
what about the roadblocks
theyre looking for a
man traveling alone
they wont be expecting a family
adult henry a family
half
stammers but i just
half
henry
ill be back in a little bit
hank we still have work to do
i know im almost done
eleanor any luck getting that
sex fiend out of your house
i dont think hes a fiend
but no hes still there
its easy you know
just tell your mom he touched you
its not like that anymore
were actually getting along
theyre going to take me
with them to canada
eleanor when
tomorrow
on the first day of school
its him isnt it
youre on the run
this one right
groans
are you okay
groaning
probably just need some aspirin
before we hit the road
let me take a look
no im fine its fine
if this is going to work sometimes
you need to let me take care of you
breathing heavily
adele oh
jesus
you need medicine
no it can wait
no its infected
ill send henry to the
pharmacy let me do it
its okay you go
no theres still too
much packing to do
i dont think youre going
to make a run for it
okay
eleanor howd you escape
henry its not like that
he trusts me
eleanor laughs
eleanor or maybe he was just
waiting for you to leave the house
so they could run off together
engine starting
eleanor
its just like bonnie and clyde
henry who
eleanor
they made a movie about them
bonnie was this woman who was bored
because she hadnt had
sex in a long time
this guy clyde just showed
up one day and took her away
they drove all around holding up
banks and living out of their car
henry what happened to them
in the end they got killed
federal agents tracked them and
gunned them down in an ambush
the part where bonnie gets killed
theres so much blood my
mother couldnt even watch
could you imagine if your
mom got killed in an ambush
and you were right
there watching it
they probably wouldnt shoot
at you since youre a kid
but youd see the whole thing
itd be pretty traumatic
i bet you never did that before
now youll always remember i was
the first girl you ever kissed
its a shame youre leaving
just as we started dating
ill have to find another
boy to make out with
breathing heavily
whats wrong
nothing
if youre not up for this
you need to let me know
no its not that
because tomorrow youre
gonna say goodbye
to everyone youve ever known
ive already said
goodbye its just
were gonna hit the road
and never look back
theres gonna be roadblocks
and bordercrosses
i know i know
so if you dont want this
you need to tell me
no i do want this
more than almost anything
ive ever wanted in my life
then what is it
sighs
after henry was born
my body just
forgot how
the first time it happened i woke
up with these horrible cramps
i felt something slip
from me it was tiny
if i could have just held tighter
i know this is a very difficult
and painful time for both of you
adele my doctor said that this
was more common than we thought
i was young we could try again
but two more times
id start feeling the
nausea and the swelling
wed celebrate
began setting up the nursery
only to wake up feeling
betrayed by my own body
nopanting
no no no no sobbing
by my fourth time
we knew better than to celebrate
we knew better than
to tell our friends
or think of baby names
we hadnt even packed a
suitcase for the hospital
when the contractions started
groans
all right two pushes two pushes
stop take a breath
panting
one more one more this is it
last big one
this is it come on come on
push push push
there you go
groaning
adele wed made it
panting
what
what is it
adele
maybe they just took pity on me
theyd wrapped her in a pink
blanket and put on a diaper
the only one shed ever wear
as i stared at this
beautiful little girl
her long eyelashes
her daddys nose my chin
the little mouth that would
never take a breath
i knew there would be no
further conversations
no more attempts
we were done
the world had become a cruel place
i stopped going for walks
i couldnt leave the house
i couldnt even open
a window at night
breathing heavily
sobbing
eventually when gerald left
i understood
id become a prisoner
i came to save you adele
tomorrow thats exactly
what im going to do
i cant
i cant give you a family
you already have
sighs
adult henry
by the end of the afternoon
everything in the house
had been neatly separated
into essentials and

sirens wailing in the distance

helicopter hovering

maam over here i need you
to look over here please
im going to cut the tape
can you hear me okay
car engine starts
adult henry
they charged him with kidnapping
when my mother heard
she drove to see the prosecutor
with me as a witness
to make him understand that no
unlawful detainment had taken place
he didnt hurt us
he is a good man
he was kind to my son
adult henry she omitted the
fact that they were in love
adele these situations
are never simple
never clean
it may take years for you to
fully weave it all together
now perhaps before putting this
kind of statement into record
you might want to take some time to
think about what actually happened
harboring a fugitive is a major
crime we dont look lightly upon
and of course there is
delinquency to a minor
you could lose custody of your son
adult henry
they gave frank 10 years
for the escape and 15
for the kidnapping
my mother tried to visit him once
but was told he was doing solitary
she wrote to frank sometimes
daily but received no response
eventually a package arrived
containing all of her letters
stamped with a prison seal
none of them had been opened
she called to enquire and was
told frank had been transferred
within a month my mother voluntarily
relinquished custody of me to my father
he rarely knew what to say
more often than not
he just kept quiet
the newspapers had
said it all anyway
when i visited my mother
she would act busy and distracted
calls to make chores to do
i think my presence
made her uncomfortable
a strange reminder
of what was missing
all those two had was each other
that was enough
by my junior year
people hardly brought up the events
leading up to seventh grade
for the first time i had
someone to call a girlfriend
people cheering
theres something ive been
meaning to talk to you about
oh dad please were
having such a pleasant time
everybody talks about all
this crazy wild passion
thats how it goes in
the songs you know
your mother was like that
she was in love with love
she couldnt do anything partway
she was a terrific woman
funny
so beautiful
a better man might have stayed around
and helped her through all that sadness
but i couldnt bear it
i just wanted a regular life
i dont know what these last
few years have done to repair
but im sorry i cut out on you
its okay
im going to get the check
adult henry
the next day when i suggested
i move back in with my mother
for the rest of senior year
he didnt argue
and it was there in my moms
kitchen my final summer at home
that i first tried
my hand at baking
frank dear henry
i hope you will remember me
we once spent labor
day weekend together
five of the best days of my life
i had always wondered who you would
become and what you would look like
and then one day i came
across a familiarlooking pie
and there you were
im proud of you
i will understand if you choose
not to respond to this letter
however i am due to
be released shortly
i am no longer young but i have
plenty of good health remaining
and id like to live much
the same way we discussed
that weekend back when we
thought wed be a family
most likely your mother
has remarried by now
but on the off chance
that she might be alone
i wanted to ask you whether
i might write her a letter
i promise you
i would sooner cut off my own hand
than bring any more grief to adele
adult henry
i wrote him back that day
to say that it wouldnt be
difficult to locate my mother
she lived at the same address
sobbing
adult henry i spent half of
