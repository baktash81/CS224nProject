mother      
she s probably a hermit at school 
it s true that stress can
trigger asthma attacks 
meanwhile  my husband s
off on a business trip 
maybe he and i are
partly to blame  too 
12 years old   
it s a difficult age 
have you noticed anything about her 
she    always has an ordinary face 
ordinary face 
i m sorry 
like she won t show her emotions   
she used to be more expressive 
but these days  i don t even know   
maybe it s because
we re not related by blood 
you may want to send her
somewhere to get better 
7 03 departure for kushiro

nice place  huh  bet you d
like auntie to see it  too 
what s that over there 
on the cliff 
oh  that s a silo 
it s for storing feed for livestock 
hasn t been used in decades  though 
now the village kids
use it for dares 
they say there are ghosts there 
dear  please 
he loves stories like that 
best to stay away from there 
look  that s our house over there 
here  mind taking this in 
what s this 
why would you accept this 
it s too much for us to eat 
he s always accepting gifts
without thinking   
our kids are all grown up
and moved out 
make yourself at home 
thank you 
let s see  these go where   
excuse me 
you must think it s an odd house 
no  it s a lovely home 
no need for flattery 
your room s upstairs 
it was my daughter s room 
it d be sad to clear everything 
so i left it as it was 
i see 
she s a yoga teacher in tokyo now 
i m thinking of trying it myself 
oh  and feel free to use
the closet and shelves 
oh  thank you

it s tough being
class president 
wait  i need to drop off a letter 
hey  who s that 
why is it   
that mansion feels familiar 
i wonder if anyone lives here 
excuse me   
what a big house 
i guess there s no one here 
oh  no   
thank you 
he s a bear 
or maybe a sea lion 
sounds like an adventure 
completely different
in high tide  isn t it 
it s the power of the moon 
but imagine that  toichi giving
a girl a ride on his boat 
he s actually a good guy 
just not much of a talker 
you should ask him for a ride again 
ask him for a ride 
i will 
but it s best you stay away
from the marsh house 
how come 
ghosts 
not again 
i ll get some wine 
looked like no one lives there 
not now  anyway

typically  you re the ones who   
still talking about that 
we already settled this matter 
we re not blaming you 
it s just that   
i ve already told you

my daughter could learn from you 
passing behind you 
i remember when you first
came to yoriko s place 
she was ecstatic 
she wanted to make up for the
five years she didn t have with you 
so she taught you things 
like knife skills 
but she worries too much 
always calling me for help 
when i told her i was busy 
she started pouting 
oh  i shouldn t share this
about your mother 
no  i understand 
you know  yoriko sent us
tons of photos of you 
i ll show you later

staring at my room 
because

i just love this mansion  that s all 
that can t be 
when i said marnie earlier

rather  why do you know marnie 
i found it behind the shelf 
a diary 
that s right  your diary 
marnie 
i ll pour you some
queen mary  your favorite 
i ll be back 
 last night i went for
a row in my nightie 
 the marsh and the moon
were very pretty at night  
i shall do it again 
june 8th  a party 
father  mother and many of their
friends came  it was such fun 
i went outside from the sunroom
and danced with a flower girl 
but   
nan locked me in my room
because of last night 
so there won t be any
midnight rows for a bit 
see  it s you  isn t it 
no 
marnie is   
marnie is   
someone i made up 
an imaginary girl  only in my mind 
but this is marnie s diary 
it s as if she really lived here 
so you re not marnie 
no 
she s just imaginary 
that s right 
i thought you were marnie 
back for her diary   
i m anna  i came from
sapporo to get better 
i m sayaka 
i m from tokyo 
but if she was imaginary 
why is her name the same 
i don t know 
marnie must be real 
i m going to investigate 
say  marnie   
who are you 
is that me 
marnie 
marnie 
wait  that one s not done yet   
wow  you draw well 
oh  thanks   
i ve never had anyone
draw me before  how nice 
i missed you 
i kept calling you in my heart 
me  too 
let s go 
come to my room 
come to my room  marnie 
i can t go far from the mansion 
okay then  we ll go
wherever you want 
you know a lot about mushrooms 
father taught me when i was little 
i once brought home
three bags full of mushrooms 
the look on mother s face 
what s wrong 
so quiet all of a sudden 
you re very lucky 
i wish i was you 
talk to me 
i m   
a foster child 
my real parents died
when i was little 
my grandmother  too 
i know they didn t
die on purpose  but   
sometimes i feel like   
i can t forgive them   
for leaving me all alone 
i m jealous of you 
you re lucky to be a foster child 
if you had no relatives 
then the folks who took
you in as a daughter
must be truly kindhearted people 
then i ll tell you a big secret 
it s about my foster parents 
they re good to me and they re kind 
i m not their real child  yet they
raised me  which i appreciate 
but you see  i saw it one day 
they re paid money for it 
money 
i found a letter from the government 
it said they were increasing
the subsidy for me 
i m sure there s a reason   
i don t care 
they wouldn t get money if
i were their real child 
they get paid because
i m not their real child 
even worse   
they hide it from me 
i see 
but that doesn t mean
auntie doesn t love you 
no  don t you see 
none of the other families
receive money  just us 
she always looks worried
that i might find out 
and i hate myself for
thinking like this 
i    just can t    believe   
in anything anymore 
anna  it s okay to cry 
just know that i love you 
i love you more than
any girl i ve ever known 
then you tell me your secret next 
it was long ago that i went
mushrooming with father 
nowadays  i hardly see my parents 
mother s usually travelling 
because of work 
father s home only twice a year 
usually  nan and the twin maids
are the only ones home 
and me 
i slip out while they re gossiping 
and look how free i get to be 
it s lovely when
my parents come home 
they host parties 
like the other day 
with my amazing parents
and many people there 
it s delightful 
i get to wear new dresses
and dance  too 
that s when i m sure i m
the luckiest girl in the world 
i see 
tell me  anna  will you
be my friend forever 
yes 
i m your friend forever 
right 
nan s always in a bad mood 
she yanks me by the arm 
brushes my hair very hard   
no one thinks i m being bullied 
but it really hurts 
enough to cry 
the maids love to frighten me 
they threatened me
all the time 
 naughty kids get shut in the silo
 where ghosts suck out
their souls   they said 
you mean  the silo on the hill 
once  they actually took me there 
no 
they dragged me
all the way to the silo 
i thought i d die of fright 
then suddenly 
just as we got there  the sky
went dark and the thunder came 
the maids were terrified 
so we didn t go inside 
i can endure anything else 
anything but the silo 
i never heard such a terrible thing 
i hope the maids and nan
get struck by lightning 
hasn t anyone ever
tried to frighten you 
never  definitely not on purpose 
you re lucky 
i wish i was you 
our castle   
poor marnie 
i love you the most  too 
more than anyone i ve known 
thank you 
funny  it s like we traded places 
how true 
the tide s coming in 
hey  let s go to the silo together 
the ghosts must be a lie 
let s go make sure 
tomorrow    no  let s go right now 
i don t care who marnie really is 
i just want to help her 
are you okay  marnie 
yes  i m sure i ll be
all right if i m with you

sayaka 
here  a get well gift 
thanks 
also   
this is what made me think
you might be at the silo 
what is it 
the rest of the diary
you promised to read 
i m having trouble remembering 
i impressed myself 
i found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard 
maybe i m psychic 
turn it over 
hisako 
hisako 
please  will you tell us
about marnie 
but   
it s a rather sad story 
i m ready for it 
it was a long time ago 
i used to play at
the marsh house often 
marnie and i were very little 
it s a bear 
let me see 
this is daddy  isn t he dashing 
marnie loved to boast about
her glamorous parents and
their extravagant parties 
but the truth is 
she was being neglected 
goodbye  marnie 
that poor child   
no  don t leave me  mommy 
don t go 
seems even the maids
were bullying her 
that s awful 
later  marnie moved to sapporo
and married kazuhiko 
her childhood friend 
with her family torn apart
and feeling lost 
he was there to support her 
i m glad  so kazuhiko was a good man 
two years later  emily was born 
at last in the warm household she d
always wanted  marnie was happy 
i didn t see marnie for
many years after that 
the next time was   
a few years after kazuhiko
had died of an illness 
by then 
marnie was in a sanatorium
due to the shock of his death 
sanatorium 
a place where you go to get better 
what happened to emily 
marnie s parents had died 
leaving no one to look after her 
so for elementary school 
she was sent to a boarding school 
by the time she returned at age 13 
she d become a different person 
emily 
she was willful and independent 
she knew marnie was ill 
but still resented her
for sending her away 
you think that makes you
more motherly 
i want you to live the way
you wish  but   
you need to   
they never did make up after that
as your mother   
i ve never thought of you
as a mother 
emily ran away and
soon go  married 
she was expecting  you see 
but   
one day  emily and her husband
died in a car accident 
i heard marnie took their child in 
she was determined to never
let this child be lonely 
but   
she never got over losing emily 
she became very ill 
and died the next year 
that was about ten years ago 
i m sorry  it s a sad story 
no  thank you very much 
marnie adored that mansion 
she loved seeing the marsh
from her window 
she said it felt like
the birds spoke to her 
she had a lonely life 
but she lived it fully 
always with a smile 
determined to be happy 
so you ve met marnie  too 
wish we could ve played more  anna 
the plan was always
just for the summer 
will you come again next summer 
i m sure i will  i ll write you 
i ll write you  too 
i put the diary and painting
back where i found them 
good  it s for the best 
i haven t told my family 
let s keep it our secret 
how funny   
marnie brought us together 
that s true 
marnie   
the girl trapped behind
the blue window   
that was long ago 
exactly  he does it to
save her life 
i love that part 
ah  now i want to
read it all over again 
i ll loan you volume 2

our own daughter back

i m impressed you didn t
call us this time 
i m all packed 
anna 
yes 
there s something
i need to tell you 
we receive monthly subsidies
to cover your expenses 
we receive money 
i ve long hesitated
to tell you  but   
  it s okay 
  but believe me   
whether or not we receive money 
it doesn t change our love for you 
i already knew 
i m happy you told me about it 
anna 
i ve been looking at
the photos you sent 
photos 
oh  while you were away
i was looking at old albums
and found this picture 
do you remember 
it s that mansion 
when you first came 
you wouldn t let it go 
i was told at the orphanage
it belonged to your grandmother 
my beloved home   marnie
marnie 
so that s who she was 
anna 
and so i was in
the silo all night 
i was very frightened 
that s when your grandpa came 
he encouraged me 
saying i did well

frightening things 
and so will you  anna
