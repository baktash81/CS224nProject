recorded and their name printed   
in the auspicious m i t  tech 
former winners include nobel laureates

renowned astrophysicists
and lowly m i t  professors

fuck 
ls this just my imagination 
or has my class grown considerably 
well  by no stretch of my imagination do i
believe you ve all come here to hear me lecture 
or rather  to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician 
so without further adieu  come forward 
silent rogue  and receive thy prize 
well  i m sorry to disappoint
my spectators  but   
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today 
however  um  my colleagues and i
have conferred   
and there is a problem
on the board right now   
that took us more than two years
to prove 
so let this be said 
the gauntlet has been thrown down   
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour 
  hi 
  when s the arraignment 
next week 
  sorry    what are
you doing    sorry 
that s people s work 
you can t graffiti here 
  don t you walk away from me

  you kiddin  me  i asked you yesterday if i could get a job 
  and i told you  no  yesterday 
  what s up  case    what s
up  case    what s up  big case 
let s sit over here 
oh  this is 
this is a harvard bar  huh 
i thought there d be  like 
equations and shit on the walls 
i will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house 
time out  i m gonna have to bust a little move
on them harvard hotties down there at the bar 
  work some magic 
  get some potion for us 
  oh  hello 
  oh  hello 
  hi  how are ya 
  fine 
  so  do you ladies  uh   
  come here often 
do i come here  i come here a bit  i m
here  uh  uh  you know  from time to time 
  do you go to school here 
  yep 
  yeah  that s it  yes  i think i had a class with you 
  oh  yeah 
  what class 
  history 
  maybe 
  yes  i think that s what it was 
you don t necessarily    may not
remember me  you know  i like it here 
it doesn t mean  cause i go here 
i m a genius 
  i am very smart 
  hey 
  hey  how s it goin   how are ya 
  good  how ya doin  
  you wanna   
  what  uh    what class did you  did you say that was 
  history 
  history  yeah 
just history  lt must ve been
a survey course then  huh 
  yeah  it was  it was surveys 
  right 
you should check it out  it s
a good course  it d be a good class 
how d you like that course 
you know  frankly  i found the class 
you know  rather  uh  elementary 
elementary  you know 
i don t doubt that it was 
  yeah 
  i  uh  i remember that class 
it was  um  it was
just between recess and lunch 
clark  why don t you go away 
  why don t you relax 
  why don t you go just away 
i m just having fun with my new friend 
that s all 
  what  we gonna have a problem 
  no  no  no  no  no  there s no problem here 
i was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution   
of the market economy
in the southern colonies 
my contention is that  uh 
prior to the revolutionary war   
the economic modalities 
especially in the southern colonies   
could most aptly be characterized as   
  agrarian precapitalist 
  let me tell you something  all right 
of course that s your contention 
you re a first year grad student 
you just got finished readin  some
marxian historian  pete garrison  probably 
you re gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to james lemon 
then you re gonna be talkin  about how the
economies of virginia and pennsylvania   
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740 
that s gonna last until next year  you re
gonna be in here regurgitatin  gordon wood   
talkin  about  you know 
the prerevolutionary utopia   
and the capital forming effects
of military mobilization 
well  as a matter of fact  i won t  because
wood drastically underestimates the impact of   
 wood drastically  wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions   
predicated upon wealth 
especially inherited wealth  
you got that from vickers 
work in essex county  page 98  right 
yeah  i read that  too  were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us 
do you have any thoughts  uh 
of your own on this matter 
or do you    is that your thing 
you come into a bar 
you read some obscure passage and then
pretend    you  you pawn it off as your own   
as your own idea just to impress
some girls  embarrass my friend 
see  the sad thing about a guy like you is  in 50 years
you re gonna start doin  some thinkin  on your own 
and you re gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life 
one  don t do that 
and two  you dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin  education   
you could ve got for  1 50
in late charges at the public library 
yeah  but i will have a degree   
and you ll be servin  my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip 
yeah  maybe  yeah  but at least
i won t be unoriginal 
but i mean  if you have a problem with that  i mean 
we could just step outside  we could figure it out 
no  man  there s no problem 
it s cool 
  it s cool 
  yeah    cool 
  fuckin  damn right  it s cool 
  how do you like me now 
my boy s wicked smart 
i just spent three minutes in this
fuckin  place  and run into a barney  huh

  yeah  parole officer 
thank you 
asshole 
there is a lengthy legal precedent 
your honour  going back to 1789   
whereby a defendant can claim self defense
against an agent of the government   
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny  a defence of liberty 
your honour  henry ward beecher  in proverbs from
the plymouth pulpit  1887  said  and i quote   
  1887  this is the 20th century  your honour 
  excuse me  excuse me 
  he s gonna make a mockery of the courtroom 
  i am afforded the right   
to speak in my own defence  sir  by
the constitution of the united states 
  this is the same document which guarantees my liberty 
  don t tell me about the constitution of the united states 
and liberty  in case you ve forgotten 
is a soui s right to breathe 
and when it cannot take a long breath 
laws are girded too tight 
  without liberty  man is a syncope 
  man is a what 
  ibid   your honour 
  son  my turn 
i ve been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin  over this rap sheet of yours 
i just can t believe it 
june  93  assault 
september  93  assault 
grand theft auto  february of  94 
where  apparently  you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing   
 free property rights of horse
and carriage  from 1798 
joke  january  95 
impersonating an officer 
mayhem  theft  resisting 
all overturned 
i m also aware that you ve
been through several foster homes 
the state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse 
you know  another judge might care 
but you hit a cop  you re going in 
motion to dismiss is denied 
 50 000 bail 
  thank you 
  court  rise 
  hello 
  uh  skylar 
  yep 
  hey  uh  it s will 
  who 
  it s will 
you know  the really funny  good looking
guy you met at the bar the other night 
i don t recall meeting anyone who matched
that description  i think i d remember 
oh  all right  you got me  it s
the ugly  obnoxious  toothless loser   
who got hammered
and wouldn t leave you alone all night 
oh  will  i remember 
  how are you  i i was wondering
if you d call me    yeah  look 
  i was wondering   
  yo  so  baby  what s up 
  hold on one second 
  what you doing 
  hey 
  what s up  baby  want some of my ass 
  herve  i remember you from juvi  how you doing 
  what s up  baby  what you doing 
ah  yeah  sorry about that  um   
i was wonderin  maybe we could
get together  um  sometime this week 
you know  sit out at a cafe 
maybe have some caramels 
  oh  that sounds wonderful 
  yeah 
yeah  sure  where are you 
um  well  actually  this is  uh 
this is just a shot in the dark   
but  uh  there s no chance that you re 
uh  pre law  is there 
  have a seat 
  thank you 
nice talking to ya 
what the fuck do you want 
i m gerald lambeau 
the professor you told
to fuck himself 
well  what the fuck do you want 
i ve spoken to the judge  and he s agreed
to release you under my supervision 
  really 
  yeah 
  but under two conditions 
  what are those 
first condition is that
you meet with me every week 
  what for 
  go over the proof you re working on   
get into some  some more advanced   
combinatorial mathematics   
finite math 
sounds like a real hoot 
and the second condition is that 
that you see a therapist 
and i m responsible to submit reports
on those meetings 
and if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions   
you will have to serve time 
all right  i ll do the math  but i m not
gonna meet with any fuckin  therapist 
it s better than spending that time
in jail  isn t it 
i read your book  and  uh  and  and
 mike  was havin  the same problems   
that  chad   the stockbroker 
was havin  
absolutely right  right on the button 
good for you  will  very nice 
thank you 
will  the pressures 
and i m not judging them   
i m not  uh  labelling them   
but they are destroying
your potential 
now no more shenanigans 
no more tomfoolery  no more ballyhoo 
you re right 
god  i know 
you know  you re not gonna get off
that easily  come on  will  a bit more 
well  i mean  i do  i do do things 
you know  i mean   
what  uh  what kind of things 
i do things that  you know  i  uh    you
know  i mean  i hide from  from people 
  you hide  do you 
  no  no  i mean  i like    i  i go places  i interact  you know 
  really  what sort of places 
  just certain clubs 
more  that s nice  yes 
what sort of clubs 
  like  um  like fantasy 
  fantasy 
  it s not bad 
  bit more 
it s just something like when you get
in there and  the music like owns you 
it s like that house music 
it s like   
  you know  you start dancin   it s just   
  boom  boom  boom  yes 
  yes 
  yeah 
do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you re gay 
what are you    what are you   
what are you talking about  what 
look  buddy  two seconds ago 
you were ready to give me a jump 
a jump  are you   
i m terribly sorry to disappoint you 
but   
i don t have a problem with it 
i don t care if you putt from the rough 
what are you    p putting from the rough 
what on earth are you talking about 
a difficult theorem
can be like a symphony 
it s very erotic 
you go somewhere else 
i can t handle this 
  wow 
  thank you  henry 
ah  henry 
hi  gerry  hey  you know something 
i can t do this pro bono work any more 
it s just not    it s not worth it 
  what happened 
  well  i m going on national television next week 
i mean  i haven t got time to tell you 
much less talk to that raving loony in there 
an absolute lunatic  he is 
henry 
okay  you are in your bed  will 
now  how old are you 
seven 
what do you see 
something s in my room 
what is it 
lt s like a  uh    it s a figure 
it s  it s hoverin  over me 
you are in a safe place  will 
it s t    it s touching me 
where is it touching you 
lt s touching me down there 
and  uh  i m nervous 
you don t have to be nervous  will

a lot of love before the sun goes down
skyrockets in flight
afternoon delight

come on  one dance  you  you really
hypnotized me  you know 
  for god s sake  will 
  what  oh  come on 
i    he left 
you can t pin that on me 
i told you to cooperate
with these people 
  look into my eyes 
  get out  will 
  i don t need therapy 
  that s enough  get out 
i called mel weintraub this morning
to see   
oh  what s the use 
what do you want to do 
  well  there is someone 
  who is he 
he used to be my  um   
my roommate in college 
trust  very important
in a relationship 
it s also very important
in a clinical situation 
why is trust
the most important thing   
in making a breakthrough
with a client 
maureen  stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us 
vinnie 
um  because  uh   
trust is  uh    trust is life 
wow  that s very deep 
thank you  vinnie 
next time  get the notes
from your brother 
you know  if a patient doesn t feel safe enough
to trust you  then he won t be honest with you 
then there s really no point for them
being in therapy 
i mean  hey  if they don t trust you  you know 
you re never gonna get them to sleep with you 
and that should be the goal
of any good therapist 
nail them while they re vulnerable 
that s my motto 
oh  good  everyone s back 
welcome back  everybody 
  hello  sean 
  hey  gerry 
um  ladies and gentlemen 
we are in the presence of greatness 
professor gerald lambeau  field s medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics 
  hello 
  anyone know what the field s medal is 
lt s a really big deal 
it s like the nobel prize for math 
except they only give it out
once every four years 
it s  it s a great thing 
it s an amazing honour 
okay  everybody  that s it for today 
thanks  um   
we ll see you monday

he was  uh  indian 
  dots not feathers 
  not feathers  yeah 
well  he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in india 
he had no formal education 
  he had no access to any scientific work 
  coffee 
  you  sir    just
a little    and  um   
but he came across
this old math book 
and from this simple text 
he was able to extrapolate theories   
that had baffled mathematicians
for years 
yes  continued fractions 
yeah  he  he wrote  uh   
  well  he  he mailed it to hardy at cambridge 
  yeah  cambridge  yeah 
and hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work   
and brought him over to england  and
then they worked together for years   
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done 
uh  this  this ramanugan   
his  his genius was unparalleled  sean 
well  this boy s just like that 
but he s  um  he s a bit defensive 
and i need someone
who can get through to him 
  like me

well  it s art  monet 
it wasn t very good 
  that s not really what concerns me though 
  what concerns you

it works better when i have my rabbit 
well   
i don t really date  you know 
that much 
how very unfortunate  i think for me 
you know what i mean 
i know you ve been thinking about uh   
  oh  no  i haven t 
  yes  you have 
  no  i really haven t 
  yes  you have  you were hoping to get a good night kiss 
no  you know  i tell ya 
i was hoping to get good night laid 
but i ll settle for like a good kiss 
you know 
  how very noble of you 
  thank you 
no  i was  i was hopin  for a kiss 
well  i think we should just get it
out of the way now 
  right now 
  yeah 
come on 
i think i got some of your pickle 
you again  huh 
come with me 
so what s this  a taster s choice
moment between guys 
this is really nice 
you got a thing for swans 
ls this like a fetish  ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to 
i thought about what you said to me
the other day  about my painting 
oh 
stayed up half the night
thinkin  about it 
something occurred to me 
i fell into a deep  peaceful sleep
and haven t thought about you since 
  you know what occurred to me 
  no 
you re just a kid  you don t have the
faintest idea what you re talking about 
  why  thank you 
  it s all right 
you ve never been out of boston 
nope 
so if i asked you about art  you d probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written 
michelangelo 
you know a lot about him 
life s work  political aspirations 
him and the pope 
sexual orientation 
the whole works  right 
i bet you can t tell me what
it smells like in the sistine chapel 
you never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling 
seen that 
if i ask you about women   
you ll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites 
you may have even been laid
a few times 
but you can t tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman   
and feel truly happy 
you re a tough kid 
i ask you about war  you d probably  uh 
throw shakespeare at me  right 
 once more into the breach 
dear friends   
but you ve never been near one 
you ve never held
your best friend s head in your lap   
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin  to you for help 
i ask you about love 
you d probably quote me a sonnet   
but you ve never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable 
known someone that could
level you with her eyes 
feelin  like god put an angel on earth
just for you   
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell 
and you wouldn t know
what it s like to be her angel   
to have that love for her
be there forever 
through anything  through cancer 
and you wouldn t know about sleepin  sittin  up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand   
because the doctors could see
in your eyes   
that the terms  visiting hours 
don t apply to you 
you don t know about real loss   
 cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself 
i doubt you ve ever dared
to love anybody that much 
i look at you  i don t see
an intelligent  confident man 
i see a cocky  scared shitless kid 
but you re a genius  will 
no one denies that 
no one could possibly understand
the depths of you 
but you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine 
you ripped my fuckin  life apart 
you re an orphan  right 
do you think i d know the first thing
about how hard your life has been   
how you feel  who you are   
because i read oliver twist 
does that encapsulate you 
personally  i don t give a shit
about all that 
because you know what  i can t learn anything
from you i can t read in some fuckin  book 
unless you want to talk about you 
who you are 
then i m fascinated 
i m in 
but you don t wanna do that 
do you  sport 
you re terrified
of what you might say 
your move  chief 
hello  hello 
hello 
professor valenti 
are you calling me again 
freak 
oh  oh  god 
  christ  who did you call 
  no one  i forgot the number 
you fuckin  retarded  you went all the way out
there in the rain  and you didn t bring the number 
no  it was your mother s 900 number 
i just ran out of quarters 
why don t we get off of mothers 
i just got off of yours 
that s pretty funny  morgan 
that s a fuckin  nickel  bitch 
  keep antagonizing me  watch what happens 
  all right  then  morgan 
  watch what happens    all right 
then  morgan    watch what happens 
  what are you gonna fuckin  do to me 
  keep fuckin  with me 
no smoking 
what do you mean  he didn t talk 
you were in there for an hour 
he just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over 
  it s pretty impressive  actually 
  why would he do that 
to prove to me he doesn t have
to talk to me if he doesn t want to 
what is this  some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood 
yeah  it is 
and i can t talk first 
we know your theory  alexander  but the
boy s found a simple geometrical picture 
  a tree structure won t work 
  look now  he s joining the two vertices 
  but i can do the sum 
  well  it s how you group the terms  alexander 
but  gerry  if we do the whole thing
this way  then   
hey  look  look 
i wrote it down 
it s simpler this way 
sometimes people get lucky 
you re a brilliant man 
you know  i was on this plane once 
and i m sittin  there  and  uh   
the captain gets on  he does his whole  you
know   we ll be cruisin  at 35 000 feet   
but then he puts the mike down 
he forgets to turn it off 
and so he turns to the copilot 
he s like   you know   
all i could use right now is
a fuckin  blow job and a cup of coffee   
so the stewardess fuckin  goes bombin  up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone s still on 
this buy in the back of the plane s like 
 hey  hon  don t forget the coffee   
you ever been on a plane 
no  but it s a fuckin  joke  it works
better if i tell it in the first person 
yeah  it does 
i have been laid  you know 
really  goody for you 
  big time  big time 
  big time  huh 
yeah  i went on a date last week 
  how d it go 
  it was good 
  you goin  out again 
  i don t know 
  why not 
  haven t called her 
  christ  you re an amateur   
i know what i m doin     really 
yeah  don t worry about me 
i know what i m doin  
yeah  but this girl is like 
you know  beautiful 
she s smart  she s fun  she s different
from most of the girls i ve been with 
so call her up  romeo 
why  so i can realize
she s not that smart 
that she s fuckin  boring 
you know  i mean  you don t   
this girl is like fuckin  perfect
right now  i don t wanna r ruin that 
maybe you re perfect right now 
maybe you don t wanna ruin that 
but i think that s
a super philosophy  will 
that way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody 
my wife used to fart
when she was nervous 
she had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies 
you know  she used to fart
in her sleep 
sorry i shared that with you 
and one night it was so loud 
it woke the dog up 
she woke up and gone like 
 was that you  
i said   yeah    i didn t have the heart
to tell her  oh  god 
  she woke herself up 
  yes 
oh  christ  ah  but  will  she s been dead
two years and that s the shit i remember 
it s wonderful stuff  you know 
little things like that 
yeah  but those are the things
i miss the most 
the little idiosyncrasies
that only i knew about 
that s what made her my wife 
boy  and she had the goods on me  too 
she knew all my little peccadillos 
people call these things imperfections 
but they re not 
oh  that s the good stuff 
and then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds 
you re not perfect  sport 
and let me save you the suspense 
this girl you met 
she isn t perfect either 
but the question is whether or not
you re perfect for each other 
that s the whole deal 
that s what intimacy is all about 
now  you can know everything
in the world  sport   
but the only way you re findin  out
that one is by givin  it a shot 
you certainly won t learn
from an old fucker like me 
even if i did know 
i wouldn t tell a pissant like you 
yeah  why not  you told me
every other fuckin  thing  jesus christ 
you fuckin  talk more than any shrink
i ever seen in my life 
i teach the shit 
i didn t say i knew how to do it 
yeah 
  you ever think about gettin  remarried 
  my wife s dead 
  hence the word  remarried   
  she s dead 
yeah  well  i think that s
a super philosophy  sean 
i mean  that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life   
without ever really knowing anybody 
time s up 
hold it open 
  okay 
  thank you 
i am happy with you
i know i m about to love you
yeah  yeah  yeah
you know him

for  ebogamine

  like tomorrow

we re still bangin  away at the past 
well  maybe you should  my phone s been
ringing off the hook with job offers 
  what kind 
  well  cutting edge mathematics  think tanks 
the kind of place where a mind
like wili s is given free rein 
that s  that s great
that there are offers   
but i  i don t really think
he s ready for that 
i m not sure you understand  sean 
  well  what don t i understand 
  here you go  guys 
  thanks  tim 
  yeah  thank you 
just so you don t get
sticky fingers  huh 
tim  can you help us 
we re tryin  to settle a bet 
uh oh 
  you ever heard of jonas salk 
  sure  cured polio 
  ever heard of albert einstein 
  hey 
how about gerald lambeau 
ever heard of him 
  no 
  thank you  tim 
  so  who won the bet 
  i did 
this isn t about me  sean  i m   
i m nothing compared to this young man 
you ever hear of gerald lambeau 
in 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown   
for their study of the universe 
but it was a   
it was a 26 year old
swiss patent clerk   
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world 
can you imagine if einstein
would have given that up   
just to get drunk with his buddies
in vienna every night 
we all would ve lost something 
tim would never have heard of him 
  pretty dramatic  gerry 
  no  it isn t  sean 
this boy has that gift 
he just hasn t got the direction 
but we can give that to him 
hey  gerry 
in the 1960s   
there was a young man graduated
from the university of michigan 
did some brilliant work in mathematics 
specifically 
bounded harmonic functions 
then he went on to berkeley 
he was assistant professor 
showed amazing potential  then he moved to
montana and he blew the competition away 
  yeah  so who was he 
  ted kaczynski 
haven t heard of him 
  hey  timmy 
  yo 
  who s ted kaczynski 
  unabomber 
that s exactly what i m talking about 
we gotta give this kid direction 
he can contribute to the world  and 
and we can help him do that 
  direction s one thing  manipulation s another  all right 
  sean 
  we have to let him find   
  sean  i m not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache   
and hatching a  hatching a plan
to ruin this boy s life 
i was doing advanced mathematics
when i was  when i was 18   
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a field s medal 
well  maybe he doesn t want
what you want 
there s more to life
than a fuckin  field s medal 
this is too important  sean 
and it s above personal rivalry 
wait a minute  wait a minute  gerry 
let s talk about the boy 
why don t we give him time
to figure out what he wants 
that s a wonderful theory  sean 
it worked wonders for you  didn t it 
yeah  it did 
you arrogant fuckin  prick 
well  i m sorry 
i m sorry that i came here today 
i came here out of courtesy 
i  i wanted to keep you in the loop 
oh  nice to be in the loop 
the boy s in a meeting right now
i set up for him over at mcneil 
well  will  uh  i m not
exactly sure what you mean 
we ve already offered you
a position 
nobody in this town works
without a retainer  guys 
you think you can find somebody who does 
let me tell you  you have my blessin  
but i think we all know that person s
not gonna represent you as well as i can 
will  our offer
i  is  84 000 a year plus   
retainer
retainer 
you want us to give you cash
right now 
whoa ho ho  go easy 
now  i didn t say that 
allegedly  your situation  for you   
would be concurrently improved   
if i had  200
in my back pocket right now 
well  i don t think i i can  uh  uh   
larry 
  i ve got  73 
  uh  will you take a cheque 
let me tell you somethin  
you re suspect 
yeah  you 
i don t know what your reputation is
in this town   
but after the shit you tried to pull
today  you can bet i ll be lookin  into you 
now  any business
we have heretofore   
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney 
good day  gentlemen 
and until that day comes   
keep your ear to the grindstone 
  how s it goin  
  fine 
yeah 
good 
  you want some help 
  no 
  come on  give me one little peek  we ll go to the batting cages 
  no 
it is actually important
that i learn this 
  it s really important to me  okay 
  all right  all right 
  so  why don t we just hang out here all day 
  yes  why don t we 
all right  mr nosey parker 
seeing as you re intent
on breaking my balls   
let me ask you a question 
all right 
do you have a photographic memory 
i don t know 
i just kinda remember  you know 
i mean  how do you remember your
phone number  you know  you just do 
  well  have you studied organic chemistry 
  a little bit 
  oh  just for fun 
  yeah  for kicks 
yeah  it s so much fun
studying organic chemistry 
are you mad 
have you completely lost your mind 
nobody studies it for fun 
it s not a  a necessity 
especially for someone like you 
  someone like me 
  yeah 
someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars 
i mean  i would hardly say
it was a necessity 
oh 
you know  there are very smart people
here at harvard 
and even they have to study 
because this is really hard 
and yet  you do it so easily 
i don t understand  i  i  i don t
understand how your mind works 
  do you play the piano 
  i want to talk about this 
no  i m trying to explain it to you 
do you play the piano 
  yeah  a bit 
  all right  so when you  when you look at a piano  you see mozart 
  i see  chopsticks   
  all right  well  beethoven  okay 
he looked at a piano  and it just
made sense to him  he could just play 
  so  what are you saying  you play the piano 
  no  not a lick 
i mean  i look at a piano  i see a bunch
of keys  three pedals and a box of wood 
but beethoven  mozart 
they saw it  they could just play 
i couldn t paint you a picture  i
probably can t hit the ball out of fenway 
and i can t play the piano 
but you can do my o chem paper
in under an hour 
right  well  i mean  when it came
to stuff like that   
i could always just play 
that s the best i can explain it 
  come here  i have to tell you something 
  huh 
  i have to tell you something 
  oh 
well   
  it s not fair 
  what s not fair  what 
i ve been here for four years   
and i ve only just found you 
well  you found me 
are you awake 
nope 
yes  you are 
will  come to california with me 
what 
i want you to come to california
with me 
you sure about that 
oh  yeah 
yeah  but how do you know 
i don t know 
i just know 
yeah  but h how do you know 
i know because i feel it 
   cause that s a really serious thing you re sayin   i mean   
  i  i know 
you could be in california next week 
and you know   
you might find out something about me
you don t like  and  you know   
maybe you wish you hadn t said that  but
you know it s such a serious thing   
that you can t take it back 
and now i m stuck in california   
with someone that doesn t really want to
be with me  just wish they had a take back 
a what  what s a take back 
i don t want a take back 
i just want you to come
to california with me 
well  i can t go to california
with you  so   
  why not 
  well  one  because i  i  i got a job here 
and two  because i live here 
look  um  if you don t love me 
you should just tell me because   
i m not sayin  i don t love you 
then why  why won t you come 
what are you so scared of 
what am i so scared of 
well  what aren t you scared of 
you live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you  and you re scared shitless to do anything else 
  because that might mean that you d have to change 
  don t  don t tell me about my world  don t tell me about my world 
i mean  you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town 
then you re gonna go off to stanford 
you re gonna marry some rich prick   
who your parents will approve of 
and just sit around   
with the other trust fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin   too  once 
why are you saying this 
what is your obsession with this money 
my father died when i was 13 
and i inherited this money 
you don t think every day i wake up 
and i wish i could give it back 
that i would give it back in a second   
if it meant i could have one more day
with him  but i can t 
and that s my life 
and i deal with it 
so don t put your shit on me
when you re the one that s afraid 
i m afraid  w w what am i afraid of 
so  what the fuck am i afraid of 
you re afraid of me  you re afraid
that i won t love you back 
and you know what 
i m afraid  too 
but fuck it  i wanna give it a shot 
and at least i m honest with you 
  i m not honest with you 
  no  what about your 12 brothers 
all right 
no  you re not going 
you re not leaving 
what do you wanna know  what 
that i don t have 12 brothers 
  that i m a fuckin  orphan  no  you don t wanna hear that 
  i didn t know that  i didn t know that 
no  you don t wanna hear that  you don t wanna hear that i
got fuckin  cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid 
  honey  i didn t know that 
  that this isn t fuckin  surgery 
that the motherfucker stabbed me 
you don t wanna hear that shit  skylar 
  i do wanna hear that 
  don t tell me you wanna hear that shit 
  i wanna hear it because i wanna help you  because i wanna be with you 
  help me  what the fuck 
what do i got  a fuckin  sign
on my back that says   save me  
  no 
  do i look like i need that 
  no  god  i just want to be with you because i love you 
  don t bullshit me  don t bullshit me 
  don t you fuckin  bullshit me 
  i love you  i love you 
i love you 
i wanna hear you say
that you don t love me 
because if you say that   
then i won t call you   
and i won t be in your life 
i don t love you 
you don t   
most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be 
they don t find teachers
that believe in them 
they get convinced they re stupid 
i hope you appreciate
what he s doing   
because i ve seen how much
he enjoys working with you   
not against you 
hello  will 
tom  can you get us some coffee 
sure 
now  let s see 
good  this is correct 
i see you used maclaurin here 
yeah  i don t know what
you call it  but   
this can t be right 
this would be very embarrassing 
  did you ever consider   
  i m pretty sure it s right 
hey  look  can we do this
at sean s office from now on 
because i  i gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me 
yeah  sure 
  but did you think of the possibility   
  it s right 
it s right 
just take it home with you 
what happened at the mcneil meeting 
i couldn t go  i had a date 
so  uh  so i sent my chief negotiator 
on your own time  you can do
whatever you like  will 
but when i set up a meeting with 
with my associates   
and you don t show up 
it reflects poorly on me 
  well  then don t set up any more meetings 
  well  i won t 
i ll cancel them 
i ll give you a job myself  i  i just
wanted you to see what was out there 
look  maybe i don t wanna spend the  the rest of my
fuckin  life sittin  around explaining shit to people 
i think you could show me
some appreciation 
a little appreciation  do you know
how easy this is for me 
do you have any fuckin  idea how easy
this is  this is a fuckin  joke 
and i m sorry you can t do this 
i really am 
because i wouldn t have to fuckin 
sit here and watch you fumble around   
and fuck it up 
then you d have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead  wouldn t you 
you re right  this is probably
a total waste of my time 
yeah  you re right  will 
i can t do this proof 
but you can  and when it comes to that 
it s only about   
it s just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me 
  but i m one of  em 
  sorry 
yeah  so am i 
most days i wish i never met you   
because then i could sleep at night 
and i didn t  i didn t have to walk
around with the knowledge   
that there was someone like you
out there 
i  i didn t have to watch you
throw it all away 
bill  hold it 
did you hear that 
morgan 
lf you re watchin  pornos
in my mom s room again   
i m gonna give you a fuckin  beatin  
what s up  fellas 
morgan  dude  why don t you jerk off
in your own fuckin  house  dude 
  that s fuckin  filthy 
  i don t got a v c r  at my house 
  you re kiddin  
  come on  not in my glove 
i didn t  i didn t use the glove 
that s my little league glove 
what do you want me to do 
i mean  what s wrong with you 
you ll hump a baseball glove 
i didn t  i didn t 
i just used it for the  for cleanup 
will you stop jerkin  off
in my mother s room  please 
  is there another v c r  in the house 
  it s just sad  bro 
so why do you think i should work
for the national security agency 
well  you d be working
on the cutting edge 
you d be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn t see anywhere else   
because we ve classified it 
superstring theory 
chaos math  advanced algorithms 
code breaking 
well  that s one aspect
of what we do 
oh  come on 
i mean  that is what you do 
you guys handle 80 
of the intelligence workload 
you re seven times the size
of the c i a 
we don t like to brag
about that  will 
but you re exactly right 
so  the way i see it 
the question isn t   
 why should you work for the n s a   
the question is 
 why shouldn t you  
why shouldn t i work for the n s a  
that s a tough one 
but i ll take a shot 
say i m workin  at the n s a 
and somebody puts a code on my desk 
somethin  no one else can break 
maybe i take a shot at it 
and maybe i break it 
and i m real happy with myself
 cause i did my job well 
but maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in north africa or the middle east 
and once they have that location  they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin  
fifteen hundred people that i never met 
never had no problem with  get killed 
now the politicians are sayin    oh 
send in the marines to secure the area   
 cause they don t give a shit  it won t
be their kid over there gettin  shot 
just like it wasn t them
when their number got called   
 cause they were all pullin  a tour
in the national guard 
it ll be some kid from southie
over there takin  shrapnel in the ass 
he comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at   
got exported to the country
he just got back from   
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job   
 cause he ll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks 
meanwhile  he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place   
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price 
and  of course  the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices 
a cute little ancillary benefit
for them   
but it ain t helpin  my buddy
at  2 50 a gallon 
they re takin  their sweet time
bringin  the oil back  of course 
maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin  an alcoholic skipper   
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin  play slalom with the icebergs 
it ain t too long till he hits one 
spills the oil   
and kills all the sea life
in the north atlantic 
so now by buddy s out of work 
he can t afford to drive   
so he s walkin  to the fuckin 
job interviews  which sucks   
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin  him chronic haemorrhoids 
and meanwhile  he s starvin   cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat   
the only blue plate special they re servin 
is north atlantic scrod with quaker state 
so what did i think 
i m holdin  out for something better 
i figure  fuck it  while i m at it 
why not just shoot my buddy   
take his job 
give it to his sworn enemy   
hike up gas prices  bomb a village 
club a baby seal   
hit the hash pipe
and join the national guard 
i can be elected president 
  you feel like you re alone  will 
  what 
do you have a soul mate 
do i have a   
define that 
somebody who challenges you 
  uh  chuckie 
  no  chuckie s family 
he d lie down
in fuckin  traffic for you 
no  i m talkin  about someone who opens
up things for you  touches your soul 
  i got    i got   
  who 
  i got plenty 
  well  name  em 
shakespeare  nietzsche  frost 
o connor  kant  pope  locke   
  that s great  they re all dead 
  not to me they re not 
nah  you don t have
a lot of dialogue with them 
you can t give back to them  will 
not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater 
yeah  yeah  that s what i m saying 
you ll never have that kind
of relationship in a world   
where you re always afraid
to take the first step   
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road 
  you gonna take the professor s side on this 
  don t give me a line of shit 
  no 
  look  i didn t want the job 
it s not about the job  i don t care
if you work for the government 
but you can do anything you want 
you are bound by nothing 
what are you passionate about 
what do you want 
i mean  there are guys who work
their entire life layin  brick   
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here 
  i didn t ask for this 
  no 
you were born with it  so don t cop out
behind   i didn t ask for this   
what do you mean   cop out   i mean 
w  w what s wrong with layin  brick 
  nothin  
  there s nothin  wrong with it  that s  that s somebody s home i m buildin  
right  my day laid brick  okay  busted
his ass so i could have an education 
exactly  that s an honourable profession 
what s wrong with  with fixin  somebody s car 
someone will get to work the next day
because of me  there s honour in that 
yeah  there is  will  there s honour
in that  and there s honour in   
you know  taking that
40 minute train ride   
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean 
and the wastebaskets are empty 
that s real work 
  that s right 
  right  and that s honourable 
sure  that s why you took that job 
i mean  for the honour of it 
i just have a little question here 
you could be a janitor anywhere 
why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin  world 
and why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people s formulas   
that only one or two people in the world
could do  and then lie about it 
 cause i don t see a lot of honour
in that  will 
so what do you really want to do 
  i wanna be a shepherd 
  really 
i wanna move up to nashua 
get a nice little spread   
get some sheep
and tend to them 
  maybe you should go do that 
  what 
you know  if you re gonna jerk off  why don t
you just do it at home with a moist towel 
  you re chuckin  me 
  yeah  get the fuck outta here 
  hey  no  no  no  time s not up yet

  hey  at least i played a hand 
  oh  and you played a hand and you lost  you lost a big fuckin  hand 
and some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again 
look at me

  oh  i don t know that 
let me tell you what i do know 
every day i come by your house
and i pick you up 
and we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs  and it s great 
you know what the best part
of my day is 
for about ten seconds  from when i pull
up to the kerb and when i get to your door 
 cause i think maybe i ll get up there
and i ll knock on the door   
and you won t be there 
no  goodbye   no  see ya later   
no nothin   you just left 
i don t know much  but i know that 
this is a disaster  sean 
i brought you in here because
i wanted you to help me with the boy 
  not to run him out 
  i know what i m doing with the boy  gerry 
i don t care if you have a rapport with the boy  i
don t care if you have a few laughs  even at my expense 
but don t you dare undermine
what i m trying to do here 
  undermine 
  this boy is at a fragile point right now 
i do understand  he is at a fragile
point  okay  he s got problems 
well  what problems does he have  sean  that he s
better off as a janitor  that he s better off in jail 
better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas 
oh  why do you think he does that  gerry 
do you have any fuckin  clue why  hmm 
he can handle the problems  he can handle
the work  and he obviously handled you 
gerry  listen to me  listen  why is he
hiding  why doesn t he trust anybody 
because the first thing that happened to him  he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most 
  oh  come on  don t give me that freudian crap 
  oh  no  listen  gerry 
and why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas  as you call them 
because any one of them  if you asked them to 
would take a fuckin  bat to your head  okay 
  that s called loyalty 
  yeah  that s very touching 
and who is he handling  he pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him 
it s a defence mechanism  all right 
and for 20 years he s been alone
because of that 
and if you push him right now  it s
gonna be the same thing all over again 
and i m not gonna let
that happen to him 
  now  don t you do that  sean 
  what  gerry 
don t you do that  don t infect him
with the idea that it s okay to quit 
that it s okay to be a failure 
because it s not okay  sean 
and if you re angry at me for being  being
successful  for being what you could have been  sean   
  i m not angry at you  gerry 
  oh  yes  you re angry at me  sean 
you resent me  but i m not gonna
apologize for any  any success i ve had 
you re angry at me for doing what
you could have done 
but ask yourself  sean  ask yourself
if you want will to feel that way 
  lf you want him to feel like a failure 
  oh  you arrogant shit 
that s why i don t come
to the goddam reunions 
 cause i can t stand
that look in your eye 
  you know  that condescending embarrassed look 
  oh  come on  sean 
you think i m a failure 
i know who i am 
and i m proud of what i do 
it was a conscious choice 
i didn t fuck up 
and you and your cronies think
i m some sort of pity case 
you and your kiss ass chorus following you around
going   the field s medal  the field s medal  
why are you still so fuckin  afraid
of failure 
lt s about my medal  is it  oh  god  i could
go home and get it for you  you can have it 
oh  please don t  you know    you know what  gerry 
shove the medal up your fuckin  ass  all right 
 cause i don t give a shit about your medal because
i knew you before you were a mathematical god 
when you were pimple faced and homesick  and
didn t know what side of the bed to piss on 
yeah  you were smarter than me then
and you re smarter than me now 
so don t blame me for how your life
turned out  it s not my fault 
i don t blame you  it s not about you 
you mathematical dick 
lt s about the boy 
he s a good kid 
and i won t see you fuck him up like
you re trying to fuck up me right now 
i won t see you make him feel
like a failure  too 
  he won t be a failure  sean 
  but  but if you push him  gerry   
  if you ride him   
  sean  i am what i am today   
because i was pushed and
because i learned to push myself 
he s not you  do you get that 
  i can come back 
  no  come in  uh   
i was just leaving 
a lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him
