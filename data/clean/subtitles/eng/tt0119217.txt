renowned astrophysicists
and lowly mit professors

ls this just my imagination

well by no stretch of my imagination do i
believe youve all come here to hear me lecture
or rather to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician
so without further adieu come forward
silent rogue and receive thy prize
well im sorry to disappoint
my spectators but
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today
however um my colleagues and i
have conferred
and there is a problem
on the board right now
that took us more than two years
to prove
so let this be said
the gauntlet has been thrown down
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour
hi
whens the arraignment
next week
sorry  what are
you doing  sorry

hi how are ya
fine
so do you ladies uh

here uh uh you know from time to time
do you go to school here
yep
yeah thats it yes i think i had a class with you
oh yeah
what class
history
maybe
yes i think thats what it was
you dont necessarily may not
remember me you know i like it here
it doesnt mean cause i go here
im a genius
i am very smart
hey
hey hows it goin how are ya
good how ya doin
you wanna
what uh what class did you did you say that was
history
history yeah
just history lt mustve been
a survey course then huh
yeah it was it was surveys
right
you should check it out its
a good course itd be a good class
howd you like that course
you know frankly i found the class
you know rather uh elementary
elementary you know
i dont doubt that it was
yeah
i uh i remember that class
it was um it was
just between recess and lunch
clark why dont you go away
why dont you relax
why dont you go just away
im just having fun with my new friend
thats all
what we gonna have a problem
no no no no no theres no problem here
i was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution
of the market economy
in the southern colonies
my contention is that uh
prior to the revolutionary war
the economic modalities
especially in the southern colonies
could most aptly be characterized as
agrarian precapitalist
let me tell you something all right
of course thats your contention
youre a firstyear grad student
you just got finished readin some
marxian historian pete garrison probably
youre gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to james lemon
then youre gonna be talkin about how the
economies of virginia and pennsylvania
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740
thats gonna last until next year youre
gonna be in here regurgitatin gordon wood
talkin about you know
the prerevolutionary utopia
and the capitalforming effects
of military mobilization
well as a matter of fact i wont because
wood drastically underestimates the impact of
wood drastically wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions
predicated upon wealth
especially inherited wealth
you got that from vickers
work in essex county page 98 right
yeah i read that too were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us
do you have any thoughts uh
of your own on this matter
or do you is that your thing
you come into a bar
you read some obscure passage and then
pretend you you pawn it off as your own
as your own idea just to impress
some girls embarrass my friend
see the sad thing about a guy like you is in 50 years
youre gonna start doin some thinkin on your own
and youre gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life
one dont do that
and two you dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin education
you couldve got for 150
in late charges at the public library
yeah but i will have a degree
and youll be servin my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip
yeah maybe yeah but at least
i wont be unoriginal
but i mean if you have a problem with that i mean
we could just step outside we could figure it out
no man theres no problem
its cool
its cool
yeah  cool
fuckin damn right its cool
how do you like me now
my boys wicked smart
i just spent three minutes in this
fuckin place and run into a barney huh
well there it is

thank you
asshole
there is a lengthy legal precedent
your honour going back to 1789
whereby a defendant can claim selfdefense
against an agent of the government
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny a defence of liberty
your honour henry ward beecher in proverbs from
the plymouth pulpit 1887 said and i quote
1887 this is the 20th century your honour
excuse me excuse me
hes gonna make a mockery of the courtroom
i am afforded the right
to speak in my own defence sir by
the constitution of the united states
this is the same document which guarantees my liberty
dont tell me about the constitution of the united states
and liberty in case youve forgotten
is a souis right to breathe
and when it cannot take a long breath
laws are girded too tight
without liberty man is a syncope
man is a what
ibid your honour
son my turn
ive been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin over this rap sheet of yours
i just cant believe it
june 93 assault
september 93 assault
grand theft auto february of 94
where apparently you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing
free property rights of horse
and carriage from 1798
joke january 95
impersonating an officer
mayhem theft resisting
all overturned
im also aware that youve
been through several foster homes
the state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse
you know another judge might care
but you hit a cop youre going in
motion to dismiss is denied
50000 bail
thank you
court rise

what the fuck do you want
im gerald lambeau
the professor you told
to fuck himself
well what the fuck do you want
ive spoken to the judge and hes agreed
to release you under my supervision
really
yeah
but under two conditions
what are those
first condition is that
you meet with me every week
what for
go over the proof youre working on
get into some some more advanced
combinatorial mathematics
finite math
sounds like a real hoot
and the second condition is that
that you see a therapist
and im responsible to submit reports
on those meetings
and if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions
you will have to serve time
all right ill do the math but im not
gonna meet with any fuckin therapist
its better than spending that time
in jail isnt it
i read your book and uh and and
mike was havin the same problems
that chad the stockbroker
was havin
absolutely right right on the button
good for you will very nice
thank you
will the pressures
and im not judging them
im not uh labelling them
but they are destroying
your potential
now no more shenanigans
no more tomfoolery no more ballyhoo
youre right
god i know
you know youre not gonna get off
that easily come on will a bit more
well i mean i do i do do things

the most important thing
in making a breakthrough
with a client
maureen stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us
vinnie
um because uh
trust is uh trust is life
wow thats very deep
thank you vinnie
next time get the notes
from your brother
you know if a patient doesnt feel safe enough
to trust you then he wont be honest with you
then theres really no point for them
being in therapy
i mean hey if they dont trust you you know
youre never gonna get them to sleep with you
and that should be the goal
of any good therapist
nail them while theyre vulnerable
thats my motto

somewhere in india
he had no formal education
he had no access to any scientific work
coffee
you sir  just
a little  and um
but he came across
this old math book
and from this simple text
he was able to extrapolate theories
that had baffled mathematicians
for years
yes continued fractions
yeah he he wrote uh
well he he mailed it to hardy at cambridge
yeah cambridge yeah
and hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work
and brought him over to england and
then they worked together for years
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done
uh this this ramanugan
his his genius was unparalleled sean
well this boys just like that
but hes um hes a bit defensive
and i need someone
who can get through to him
like me
yeah like you
why
well because you have the same kind of background

i think i got some of your pickle
you again huh
come with me
so whats this a tasters choice
moment between guys
this is really nice
you got a thing for swans
ls this like a fetish ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to
i thought about what you said to me
the other day about my painting
oh
stayed up half the night
thinkin about it
something occurred to me
i fell into a deep peaceful sleep
and havent thought about you since
you know what occurred to me
no
youre just a kid you dont have the
faintest idea what youre talking about
why thank you
its all right
youve never been out of boston
nope
so if i asked you about art youd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written
michelangelo
you know a lot about him
lifes work political aspirations
him and the pope
sexual orientation
the whole works right
i bet you cant tell me what
it smells like in the sistine chapel
you never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling
seen that
if i ask you about women
youll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites
you may have even been laid
a few times
but you cant tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman
and feel truly happy
youre a tough kid
i ask you about war youd probably uh
throw shakespeare at me right
once more into the breach
dear friends
but youve never been near one
youve never held
your best friends head in your lap
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin to you for help
i ask you about love
youd probably quote me a sonnet
but youve never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable
known someone that could
level you with her eyes
feelin like god put an angel on earth
just for you
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell
and you wouldnt know
what its like to be her angel
to have that love for her
be there forever
through anything through cancer
and you wouldnt know about sleepin sittin up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand
because the doctors could see
in your eyes
that the terms visiting hours
dont apply to you
you dont know about real loss
cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself
i doubt youve ever dared
to love anybody that much
i look at you i dont see
an intelligent confident man
i see a cocky scared shitless kid
but youre a genius will
no one denies that
no one could possibly understand
the depths of you
but you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine
you ripped my fuckin life apart
youre an orphan right
do you think id know the first thing
about how hard your life has been
how you feel who you are
because i read oliver twist
does that encapsulate you
personally i dont give a shit
about all that
because you know what i cant learn anything
from you i cant read in some fuckin book
unless you want to talk about you
who you are
then im fascinated
im in
but you dont wanna do that
do you sport
youre terrified
of what you might say
your move chief
hello hello
hello
professor valenti
are you calling me again
freak
oh oh god
christ who did you call
no one i forgot the number
you fuckin retarded you went all the way out
there in the rain and you didnt bring the number
no it was your mothers 900 number
i just ran out of quarters
why dont we get off of mothers
i just got off of yours
thats pretty funny morgan
thats a fuckin nickel bitch
keep antagonizing me watch what happens
all right then morgan
watch what happens  all right
then morgan  watch what happens
what are you gonna fuckin do to me
keep fuckin with me
no smoking
what do you mean he didnt talk
you were in there for an hour
he just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over
its pretty impressive actually
why would he do that
to prove to me he doesnt have
to talk to me if he doesnt want to
what is this some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood
yeah it is
and i cant talk first
we know your theory alexander but the
boys found a simple geometrical picture
a tree structure wont work
look now hes joining the two vertices
but i can do the sum
well its how you group the terms alexander
but gerry if we do the whole thing
this way then
hey look look
i wrote it down
its simpler this way
sometimes people get lucky
youre a brilliant man
you know i was on this plane once
and im sittin there and uh
the captain gets on he does his whole you
know well be cruisin at 35000 feet
but then he puts the mike down
he forgets to turn it off
and so he turns to the copilot
hes like you know
all i could use right now is
a fuckin blow job and a cup of coffee
so the stewardess fuckin goes bombin up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphones still on
this buy in the back of the planes like
hey hon dont forget the coffee
you ever been on a plane
no but its a fuckin joke it works
better if i tell it in the first person
yeah it does
i have been laid you know
really goody for you
big time big time
big time huh
yeah i went on a date last week
howd it go
it was good
you goin out again
i dont know
why not
havent called her
christ youre an amateur
i know what im doin  really
yeah dont worry about me
i know what im doin
yeah but this girl is like
you know beautiful
shes smart shes fun shes different
from most of the girls ive been with
so call her up romeo
why so i can realize
shes not that smart
that shes fuckin boring
you know i mean you dont
this girl is like fuckin perfect
right now i dont wanna rruin that
maybe youre perfect right now
maybe you dont wanna ruin that
but i think thats
a super philosophy will
that way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody
my wife used to fart
when she was nervous
she had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies
you know she used to fart
in her sleep
sorry i shared that with you
and one night it was so loud
it woke the dog up
she woke up and gone like
was that you
i said yeah  i didnt have the heart
to tell her oh god
she woke herself up
yes
oh christ ah but will shes been dead
two years and thats the shit i remember
its wonderful stuff you know
little things like that
yeah but those are the things
i miss the most
the little idiosyncrasies
that only i knew about
thats what made her my wife
boy and she had the goods on me too
she knew all my little peccadillos
people call these things imperfections
but theyre not
oh thats the good stuff
and then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds
youre not perfect sport
and let me save you the suspense
this girl you met
she isnt perfect either
but the question is whether or not
youre perfect for each other
thats the whole deal
thats what intimacy is all about
now you can know everything
in the world sport
but the only way youre findin out
that one is by givin it a shot
you certainly wont learn
from an old fucker like me
even if i did know
i wouldnt tell a pissant like you
yeah why not you told me
every other fuckin thing jesus christ
you fuckin talk more than any shrink
i ever seen in my life
i teach the shit
i didnt say i knew how to do it
yeah
you ever think about gettin remarried
my wifes dead
hence the word remarried
shes dead
yeah well i think thats
a super philosophy sean
i mean that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life
without ever really knowing anybody
times up
hold it open
okay
thank you
i am happy with you
i know im about to love you
yeah yeah yeah
you know him

hey
how about gerald lambeau
ever heard of him
no
thank you tim
so who won the bet
i did
this isnt about me sean im
im nothing compared to this young man
you ever hear of gerald lambeau
in 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown
for their study of the universe
but it was a
it was a 26yearold
swiss patent clerk
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world
can you imagine if einstein
would have given that up
just to get drunk with his buddies
in vienna every night
we all wouldve lost something
tim would never have heard of him
pretty dramatic gerry
no it isnt sean
this boy has that gift
he just hasnt got the direction
but we can give that to him
hey gerry
in the 1960s
there was a young man graduated
from the university of michigan
did some brilliant work in mathematics
specifically
bounded harmonic functions
then he went on to berkeley
he was assistant professor
showed amazing potential then he moved to
montana and he blew the competition away
yeah so who was he
ted kaczynski
havent heard of him
hey timmy
yo
whos ted kaczynski
unabomber
thats exactly what im talking about
we gotta give this kid direction
he can contribute to the world and
and we can help him do that
directions one thing manipulations another all right
sean
we have to let him find
sean im not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache
and hatching a hatching a plan
to ruin this boys life
i was doing advanced mathematics
when i was when i was 18
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a fields medal
well maybe he doesnt want
what you want
theres more to life
than a fuckin fields medal
this is too important sean
and its above personal rivalry
wait a minute wait a minute gerry
lets talk about the boy
why dont we give him time
to figure out what he wants
thats a wonderful theory sean
it worked wonders for you didnt it
yeah it did
you arrogant fuckin prick
well im sorry
im sorry that i came here today
i came here out of courtesy
i i wanted to keep you in the loop
oh nice to be in the loop
the boys in a meeting right now
i set up for him over at mcneil
well will uh im not
exactly sure what you mean
weve already offered you
a position
nobody in this town works
without a retainer guys
you think you can find somebody who does
let me tell you you have my blessin
but i think we all know that persons
not gonna represent you as well as i can
will our offer
i is 84000 a year plus
retainer
retainer
you want us to give you cash
right now
whoahoho go easy
now i didnt say that
allegedly your situation for you
would be concurrently improved
if i had 200
in my back pocket right now
well i dont think ii can uh uh
larry
ive got 73
uh will you take a cheque
let me tell you somethin
youre suspect
yeah you
i dont know what your reputation is
in this town
but after the shit you tried to pull
today you can bet ill be lookin into you
now any business
we have heretofore
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney
good day gentlemen
and until that day comes
keep your ear to the grindstone
hows it goin
fine
yeah
good
you want some help
no
come on give me one little peek well go to the batting cages
no
it is actually important
that i learn this
its really important to me okay
all right all right
so why dont we just hang out here all day
yes why dont we
all right mr nosey parker
seeing as youre intent
on breaking my balls
let me ask you a question
all right
do you have a photographic memory
i dont know
i just kinda remember you know
i mean how do you remember your
phone number you know you just do
well have you studied organic chemistry
a little bit
oh just for fun
yeah for kicks
yeah its so much fun
studying organic chemistry
are you mad
have you completely lost your mind
nobody studies it for fun
its not a a necessity
especially for someone like you
someone like me
yeah
someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars
i mean i would hardly say
it was a necessity
oh
you know there are very smart people
here at harvard
and even they have to study
because this is really hard
and yet you do it so easily
i dont understand i i i dont
understand how your mind works
do you play the piano
i want to talk about this
no im trying to explain it to you
do you play the piano
yeah a bit
all right so when you when you look at a piano you see mozart
i see chopsticks
all right well beethoven okay
he looked at a piano and it just
made sense to him he could just play
so what are you saying you play the piano
no not a lick
i mean i look at a piano i see a bunch
of keys three pedals and a box of wood
but beethoven mozart
they saw it they could just play
i couldnt paint you a picture i
probably cant hit the ball out of fenway
and i cant play the piano
but you can do my ochem paper
in under an hour
right well i mean when it came
to stuff like that
i could always just play
thats the best i can explain it
come here i have to tell you something
huh
i have to tell you something
oh
well
its not fair
whats not fair what
ive been here for four years
and ive only just found you
well you found me
are you awake
nope
yes you are
will come to california with me
what
i want you to come to california
with me
you sure about that
oh yeah
yeah but how do you know
i dont know
i just know
yeah but hhow do you know
i know because i feel it
cause thats a really serious thing youre sayin i mean
i i know
you could be in california next week
and you know
you might find out something about me
you dont like and you know
maybe you wish you hadnt said that but
you know its such a serious thing
that you cant take it back
and now im stuck in california
with someone that doesnt really want to
be with me just wish they had a takeback
a what whats a takeback
i dont want a takeback
i just want you to come
to california with me
well i cant go to california
with you so
why not
well one because i i i got a job here
and two because i live here
look um if you dont love me
you should just tell me because
im not sayin i dont love you
then why why wont you come
what are you so scared of
what am i so scared of
well what arent you scared of
you live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you and youre scared shitless to do anything else
because that might mean that youd have to change
dont dont tell me about my world dont tell me about my world
i mean you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town
then youre gonna go off to stanford
youre gonna marry some rich prick
who your parents will approve of
and just sit around
with the other trustfund babies and talk
about how you went slummin too once
why are you saying this
what is your obsession with this money
my father died when i was 13
and i inherited this money
you dont think every day i wake up
and i wish i could give it back
that i would give it back in a second
if it meant i could have one more day
with him but i cant
and thats my life
and i deal with it
so dont put your shit on me
when youre the one thats afraid
im afraid wwwhat am i afraid of
so what the fuck am i afraid of
youre afraid of me youre afraid
that i wont love you back
and you know what
im afraid too
but fuck it i wanna give it a shot
and at least im honest with you
im not honest with you
no what about your 12 brothers
all right
no youre not going
youre not leaving
what do you wanna know what
that i dont have 12 brothers
that im a fuckin orphan no you dont wanna hear that
i didnt know that i didnt know that
no you dont wanna hear that you dont wanna hear that i
got fuckin cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid
honey i didnt know that
that this isnt fuckin surgery
that the motherfucker stabbed me
you dont wanna hear that shit skylar
i do wanna hear that
dont tell me you wanna hear that shit
i wanna hear it because i wanna help you because i wanna be with you
help me what the fuck
what do i got a fuckin sign
on my back that says save me
no
do i look like i need that
no god i just want to be with you because i love you
dont bullshit me dont bullshit me
dont you fuckin bullshit me
i love you i love you
i love you
i wanna hear you say
that you dont love me
because if you say that
then i wont call you
and i wont be in your life
i dont love you
you dont
most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be
they dont find teachers
that believe in them
they get convinced theyre stupid
i hope you appreciate
what hes doing
because ive seen how much
he enjoys working with you
not against you
hello will
tom can you get us some coffee
sure
now lets see
good this is correct
i see you used maclaurin here
yeah i dont know what
you call it but
this cant be right
this would be very embarrassing
did you ever consider
im pretty sure its right
hey look can we do this
at seans office from now on
because i i gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me
yeah sure
but did you think of the possibility
its right
its right
just take it home with you
what happened at the mcneil meeting
i couldnt go i had a date
so uh so i sent my chief negotiator
on your own time you can do
whatever you like will
but when i set up a meeting with
with my associates
and you dont show up
it reflects poorly on me
well then dont set up any more meetings
well i wont
ill cancel them
ill give you a job myself i i just
wanted you to see what was out there
look maybe i dont wanna spend the the rest of my
fuckin life sittin around explaining shit to people
i think you could show me
some appreciation
a little appreciation do you know
how easy this is for me
do you have any fuckin idea how easy
this is this is a fuckin joke
and im sorry you cant do this
i really am
because i wouldnt have to fuckin
sit here and watch you fumble around
and fuck it up
then youd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead wouldnt you
youre right this is probably
a total waste of my time
yeah youre right will
i cant do this proof
but you can and when it comes to that
its only about
its just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me
but im one of em
sorry
yeah so am i
most days i wish i never met you
because then i could sleep at night
and i didnt i didnt have to walk
around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you
out there
i i didnt have to watch you
throw it all away
bill hold it
did you hear that
morgan
lf youre watchin pornos
in my moms room again
im gonna give you a fuckin beatin
whats up fellas
morgan dude why dont you jerk off
in your own fuckin house dude
thats fuckin filthy
i dont got a vcr at my house
youre kiddin
come on not in my glove
i didnt i didnt use the glove
thats my little league glove
what do you want me to do
i mean whats wrong with you
youll hump a baseball glove
i didnt i didnt
i just used it for the for cleanup
will you stop jerkin off
in my mothers room please
is there another vcr in the house
its just sad bro
so why do you think i should work
for the national security agency
well youd be working
on the cutting edge
youd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldnt see anywhere else
because weve classified it
superstring theory
chaos math advanced algorithms
code breaking
well thats one aspect
of what we do
oh come on
i mean that is what you do
you guys handle 80
of the intelligence workload
youre seven times the size
of the cia
we dont like to brag
about that will
but youre exactly right
so the way i see it
the question isnt
why should you work for the nsa
the question is
why shouldnt you
why shouldnt i work for the nsa
thats a tough one
but ill take a shot
say im workin at the nsa
and somebody puts a code on my desk
somethin no one else can break
maybe i take a shot at it
and maybe i break it
and im real happy with myself
cause i did my job well
but maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in north africa or the middle east
and once they have that location they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin
fifteen hundred people that i never met
never had no problem with get killed
now the politicians are sayin oh
send in the marines to secure the area
cause they dont give a shit it wont
be their kid over there gettin shot
just like it wasnt them
when their number got called
cause they were all pullin a tour
in the national guard
itll be some kid from southie
over there takin shrapnel in the ass
he comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at
got exported to the country
he just got back from
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job
cause hell work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks
meanwhile he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price
and of course the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices
a cute little ancillary benefit
for them
but it aint helpin my buddy
at 250 a gallon
theyre takin their sweet time
bringin the oil back of course
maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin an alcoholic skipper
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin play slalom with the icebergs
it aint too long till he hits one
spills the oil
and kills all the sea life
in the north atlantic
so now by buddys out of work
he cant afford to drive
so hes walkin to the fuckin
job interviews which sucks
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin him chronic haemorrhoids
and meanwhile hes starvin cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat
the only blue plate special theyre servin
is north atlantic scrod with quaker state
so what did i think
im holdin out for something better
i figure fuck it while im at it
why not just shoot my buddy
take his job
give it to his sworn enemy
hike up gas prices bomb a village
club a baby seal
hit the hash pipe
and join the national guard
i can be elected president
you feel like youre alone will
what
do you have a soul mate
do i have a
define that
somebody who challenges you
uh chuckie
no chuckies family
hed lie down
in fuckin traffic for you
no im talkin about someone who opens
up things for you touches your soul
i got i got
who

oconnor kant pope locke
thats great theyre all dead
not to me theyre not
nah you dont have
a lot of dialogue with them
you cant give back to them will
not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater
yeah yeah thats what im saying
youll never have that kind
of relationship in a world
where youre always afraid
to take the first step
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road
you gonna take the professors side on this
dont give me a line of shit
no
look i didnt want the job
its not about the job i dont care
if you work for the government
but you can do anything you want
you are bound by nothing
what are you passionate about
what do you want
i mean there are guys who work
their entire life layin brick
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here
i didnt ask for this
no
you were born with it so dont cop out

in that and theres honour in
you know taking that
40minute train ride
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean
and the wastebaskets are empty
thats real work
thats right
right and thats honourable
sure thats why you took that job
i mean for the honour of it
i just have a little question here
you could be a janitor anywhere
why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin world
and why did you sneak around at night
and finish other peoples formulas
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it
cause i dont see a lot of honour
in that will

let me tell you what i do know
every day i come by your house

and a few laughs and its great
you know what the best part

cause i think maybe ill get up there
and ill knock on the door
and you wont be there
no goodbye no see ya later
no nothin you just left
i dont know much but i know that
this is a disaster sean
i brought you in here because
i wanted you to help me with the boy
not to run him out
i know what im doing with the boy gerry
i dont care if you have a rapport with the boy i
dont care if you have a few laughs even at my expense
but dont you dare undermine
what im trying to do here
undermine
this boy is at a fragile point right now
i do understand he is at a fragile
point okay hes got problems
well what problems does he have sean that hes
better off as a janitor that hes better off in jail
better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas
oh why do you think he does that gerry
do you have any fuckin clue why hmm
he can handle the problems he can handle
the work and he obviously handled you
gerry listen to me listen why is he
hiding why doesnt he trust anybody
because the first thing that happened to him he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most
oh come on dont give me that freudian crap
oh no listen gerry
and why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas as you call them
because any one of them if you asked them to
would take a fuckin bat to your head okay
thats called loyalty
yeah thats very touching
and who is he handling he pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him
its a defence mechanism all right
and for 20 years hes been alone
because of that
and if you push him right now its
gonna be the same thing all over again
and im not gonna let
that happen to him
now dont you do that sean
what gerry
dont you do that dont infect him
with the idea that its okay to quit
that its okay to be a failure
because its not okay sean
and if youre angry at me for being being
successful for being what you could have been sean
im not angry at you gerry
oh yes youre angry at me sean
you resent me but im not gonna
apologize for any any success ive had
youre angry at me for doing what
you could have done
but ask yourself sean ask yourself
if you want will to feel that way
lf you want him to feel like a failure
oh you arrogant shit
thats why i dont come
to the goddam reunions
cause i cant stand
that look in your eye
you know that condescending embarrassed look
oh come on sean
you think im a failure
i know who i am
and im proud of what i do
it was a conscious choice
i didnt fuck up
and you and your cronies think
im some sort of pity case
you and your kissass chorus following you around
going the fields medal the fields medal
why are you still so fuckin afraid
of failure
lts about my medal is it oh god i could
go home and get it for you you can have it
oh please dont you know you know what gerry
shove the medal up your fuckin ass all right
cause i dont give a shit about your medal because
i knew you before you were a mathematical god
when you were pimplefaced and homesick and
didnt know what side of the bed to piss on
yeah you were smarter than me then
and youre smarter than me now
so dont blame me for how your life
turned out its not my fault
i dont blame you its not about you
you mathematical dick
lts about the boy
hes a good kid
and i wont see you fuck him up like
youre trying to fuck up me right now
i wont see you make him feel
like a failure too
he wont be a failure sean
but but if you push him gerry
if you ride him
sean i am what i am today
because i was pushed and
because i learned to push myself
hes not you do you get that
i can come back
no come in uh

a lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him
