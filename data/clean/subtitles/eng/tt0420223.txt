every weekday years
harold would tie tie single windsor knot instead double
thereby saving seconds
wristwatch thought single windsor made neck look fat
said nothing
every weekday years
harold would run rate nearly steps per block six blocks
barely catching kronecker bus
wristwatch would delight
feeling crisp wind rushing face
every weekday years
harold would review tax files

perhaps familiarity alone keeps
perhaps unwillingness lose collective memory
oncebeautiful hills surround lake

wader might feared
become prey
wounded bird knows fate
desperate attempts escape
underscore hopelessness plight
primates sad soulful eyes first plucked
sold cosmetic companies around world
use testing mascara artificial tears

book man
doesnt know hes die dies
man know hes going die dies anyway
dies willingly knowing could stop
mean isnt type man want keep alive
harold took bite bavarian sugar cookie
finally felt everything going okay
sometimes lose fear despair
routine constancy
hopelessness tragedy
thank god bavarian sugar cookies
fortunately arent cookies
still find reassurance familiar hand skin
kind loving gesture
subtle encouragement
loving embrace
offer comfort
mention hospital gurneys
nose plugs
uneaten danish
softspoken secrets
fender stratocasters
maybe occasional piece fiction
must remember things
nuances anomalies subtleties
assume accessorize days
fact much larger nobler cause
save lives
know idea seems strange
also know happens true
