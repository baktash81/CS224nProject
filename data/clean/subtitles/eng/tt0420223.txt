numbers   
   endless calculations
and remarkably few words 
and his wristwatch said even less 
every weekday  for 12 years   
   harold would brush
each of his 32 teeth 76 times 
thirty eight times back and forth 
thirty eight times up and down 
every weekday  for 12 years   
   harold would tie his tie in a single
windsor knot instead of the double   
   thereby saving up to 43 seconds 
his wristwatch thought the single
windsor made his neck look fat   
   but said nothing 
every weekday  for 12 years   
   harold would run at a rate of nearly
57 steps per block for six blocks   
   barely catching
the 8 17 kronecker bus 
his wristwatch would delight   
   in the feeling of the crisp wind
rushing over its face 
and every weekday  for 12 years   
   harold would review 7  134
tax files   
   as a senior agent
for the internal revenue service 
regs section 1  469 2  b   i   diane 
thanks 
good morning  irs 
harold  89 times 1417 
126 113 
that adds up 
only taking a 45  7 minute
lunch break   
   and a 4 3 minute coffee break   
   timed precisely by his wristwatch 
oh  great 
yeah  we ll go to mullen s or we ll   
beyond that 
harold lived a life of solitude 
he would walk home alone 
he would eat alone 
and at precisely 11 13 every night   
   harold would go to bed alone   
   placing his wristwatch to rest
on the nightstand beside him 
that was  of course 
before wednesday 
on wednesday  harold s wristwatch
changed everything 
oh  my god  you got it 
i got it 
i got it 
if one had asked harold 
he would have said   
   that this particular wednesday was
exactly like all the wednesdays prior 
and he began it the same way he  
and he began it the same way
he always did 
hello 
he began it the same way
he always did 
when others  minds would  
hello  is someone there 
when others  minds would fantasize
about their upcoming day   
   or even try to grip onto
the final moments of their dreams   
   harold just counted brushstrokes 
all right  who just said 
 harold just counted brushstrokes  
and how do you know i m counting
brushstrokes 
hello 
it was remarkable how the simple 
modest  
it was remarkable h  
it was remarkable how the simple 
modest elements of harold s life   
   so often taken for granted   
   would become the catalyst
for an entirely new life 
harold ran for the bus   
   his stiff leather shoes
making a terrible squeaking sound   
   as they flexed against the asphalt 
and though this was
an extraordinary day   
   a day to be remembered
for the rest of harold s life   
   harold just thought
it was a wednesday 
i m sorry  did you hear that 
the voice  did you hear it 
 harold thought it was a wednesday  
don t worry  it is wednesday 
no  no  did you hear it   harold
just thought it was a wednesday  
  who s harold 
  i m harold 
harold  it s okay  it s wednesday 
no  no  i   
never mind 
harold couldn t concentrate
on his work 
excuse me  harold 
his thoughts were scattered 
his mind elsewhere 
sorry 
someone here should be able to fix  
hold on a second 
hey  harold  what s 67 times 453 
when a coworker asked
the product of 67 and 453   
you know what 
i can t think while you re talking 
   he drew a blank 
  what 
  what 
  harold quickly answered   30 351  
  what  oh  nothing  30 351 
despite the answer
really being 31 305 
wait  wait  wait  31 305  sorry 
dude  i just totally caught
some insurance adjuster   
   claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle 
i ll tell you  it is a shame   
   that they don t give out
an auditor of the year award 
dude 
you okay 
dave  i m being followed 
how are you being followed 
you re not moving 
  it s by a voice 
  what 
i m being followed
by a woman s voice 
okay 
what is she saying 
she s narrating 
harold  you re staring at boxes 
what is she narrating 
no  no  no  i had to stop filing 
watch  watch  listen  listen 
the sound the paper made
against the folder   
   had the same tone
as a wave scraping against sand 
and when harold thought about it   
   he listened to enough waves
every day   
   to constitute what he imagined
to be a deep and endless ocean 
did you hear that 
you mean you filing 
no  no  no  the voice 
no 
frightening part is sometimes i do
imagine a deep and endless ocean 
what ocean 
the one made by the sound  
forget it 
new audits  have a good day 
thank you 
all right  we got a baker
and a securities trader 
maybe you should take the baker 
  okay 
  okay 
damn it  damn it  damn it 
  you miscreant 
  i understand 
oh  get bent  taxman 
  taxman 
  taxman 
taxman 
go home 
listen  is there somewhere else
we could talk about this 
no  we re gonna talk about this
right here 
okay  it says  the file  that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year 
  that s right 
  looks like only 78 percent 
yep 
so you did it on purpose 
yep 
so you must have been
expecting an audit 
i was expecting a fine   
   or a sharp reprimand 
a reprimand  this isn t
boarding school  ms  pascal 
you stole from the government 
no  i didn t steal from the government 
i just didn t pay you entirely 
ms  pascal  you can t just
not pay your taxes 
yes  i can 
you can if you wanna get audited 
only if i recognize your right
to audit me  mr  crick 
ms  pascal  i m right here
auditing you 
now i have to go over
your past three years   
   to make sure
that s all you haven t paid 
fine 
actually  you know  it s not fine 
listen  i m a big supporter
of fixing potholes   
   and erecting swing sets
and building shelters 
i am more than happy
to pay those taxes 
i m just not such a big fan
of the percentage   
   that the government uses
for national defense   
   corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds 
so i didn t pay those taxes 
i think  actually   
   i sent a letter to that effect
with my return 
would it be the letter that begins 
 dear imperialist swine  
yes 
ms  pascal  what you re describing
is anarchy  are you an anarchist 
  you mean am i a member of   
  an anarchist group  yes 
anarchists have a group 
i believe so  sure 
they assemble 
i don t know 
wouldn t that completely
defeat the purpose 
it was difficult for harold to imagine
ms  pascal as a revolutionary 
  not now 
  her thin arms   
  what 
     hoisting protest signs 
  her long shapely legs   
  nothing 
   dashing from tear gas 
harold wasn t prone to fantasies   
   and so he tried his best
to remain professional 
but  of course  failed 
he couldn t help but imagine
ms  pascal   
   stroking the side of his face
with the soft blade of her finger 
he couldn t help but imagine her
immersed in a tub   
   shaving her legs 
and he couldn t help
but imagine her naked   
     stretched across his bed 
  mr  crick 
  mr  crick 
  yes  what is it 
you re staring at my tits 
i wa    i don t think i was 
i don t think i would do that 
if i was  i can assure you   
   it was only as a representative
of the united states government 
sorry  i m just having issues today 
so i ll be back on tuesday 
harold suddenly found himself
beleaguered and exasperated   
     outside the bakery   
  shut up 
   cursing the heavens in futility 
no  i m not  i m cursing you 
you stupid voice 
so shut up and leave me alone 
hey  watch it 
excuse me 
excuse me 
are you miss eiffel 
  yes 
  excellent 
may i ask what you re doing 
research 
  oh  am i interrupting 
  yes 
i m sorry  i m penny escher 
i m the assistant
your publishers hired 
  the spy 
  the assistant 
i provide the same services
as a secretary 
i don t need a secretary 
then i will have to find some
other way of occupying my time 
like watching me like a vulture   
   because the publishers
think i have writer s block  right 
do you have writer s block 
are these pages 
they re letters  to me 
  are you writing back 
  i don t respond to letters 
and i suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes 
no  they came pre smoked 
yeah  they said you were funny 
what do you think about
leaping off a building 
i don t think about
leaping off buildings 
  yes  you do 
  no  i try to think of nice things 
everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings 
well  i certainly don t think about
leaping off of a building 
they say  
i read this in this
fantastically depressing book 
  that when you jump
from a building   
   it s rarely the impact
that actually kills you 
well  i m sure it doesn t help 
there s a photograph
in the book called the leaper 
it s old  but it s beautiful 
from above the corpse of a woman
who d just leapt to her death 
there s blood around her head 
like a halo   
   and her leg s buckled underneath 
her arm s snapped like a twig   
   but her face is so serene   
   so at peace 
and i think it s because
when she died   
   she could feel the wind
against her face 
i don t know how to kill harold crick 
that s why they sent you 
yes  to help you 
how are you gonna help me 
you  who never thinks
of leaping off buildings 
what great inspiration
will you bestow on me 
i ll tell you  the quaint ideas
you ve gathered   
   in your adorable career
as an  assistant    
   are to no avail
when faced with killing a man 
i understand 
do you  i can t just  
as much as i would like to   
   i cannot simply throw
harold crick off a building 
miss eiffel  kay  i ve been
an author s assistant for 11 years 
i ve helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books   
   and i ve never missed the deadline 
and i have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time 
now  i will be available to you
every minute of every day   
   until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page 
i do not like loud music 
i do not abide narcotics 
and i will gladly and quietly
help you kill harold crick 
i had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section 
yeah 
they said you were feeling
a little wibbly wobbly 
catch a little cubicle fever 
oh  i don t know  i think i m okay 
harold  a tree doesn t think
it s a tree   
   it is a tree 
why was harold talking to this man 
this man was an idiot 
this man used words like
 wibbly wobbly  and  convo  
and explained that trees were trees 
of course trees were trees 
harold knew trees were trees 
i am going to believe you  harold 
what harold didn t know
was why he couldn t shake   
   the smell of brownies
from his senses 
why ms  pascal had made
his fingertips quiver and lips go numb 
harold 
yes  sorry 
what s going on  harold 
well   
nothing  everything s fine 
listen  according to your records   
   you haven t taken vacation
in a few years now 
let s say you take a little break 
use some of that vaca time 
yeah  i ll think about it 
harold 
i m not really supposed to do this 
but   
harold assumed his watch
was simply on the fritz   
   and never even considered that it
might be trying to tell him something 
in fact  harold had never once
paid attention to his watch   
   other than to find out the time 
and  honestly 
it drove his watch crazy 
and so  on this particular
wednesday evening   
   as harold waited for the bus 
his watch suddenly   
   stopped 
sorry  does anyone have the time 
  yeah  i got 6 18 
  thanks 
thus harold s watch thrust him
into the immitigable path of fate 
little did he know that this simple 
seemingly innocuous act   
   would result in his imminent death 
what  what 
hey  hello 
what 
why 
why my death 
hello 
excuse me 
when 
how imminent 
okay  where are you 
 harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times  
why won t you say anything 
i heard you 
 that would result
in his imminent death  
i heard you 
come on  you stupid voice 
 harold frantically grabbed his lamp 
harold  incensed  shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason 
and smashed it on the ground 
kicking it repeatedly 
harold took his kleenex box 
threw it across the room   
   then stormed the closet  
come on  say something 
something  say something 
say something 
 harold  distraught    
god 
 harold  distraught    
 harold    
i m afraid what you re describing
is schizophrenia 
no  no  it s not schizophrenia 
it s just a voice in my head 
i mean  the voice isn t telling me
to do anything 
it s telling me what i ve already done 
accurately
and with a better vocabulary 
mr  crick  you have a voice
speaking to you 
no  not to me  about me 
i m somehow involved
in some sort of story 
like i m a character in my own life 
but the problem is
that the voice comes and goes 
like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me   
   and i need to find out what those
other parts are before it s too late 
before the story concludes
with your death 
yes 
mr  crick  i hate to sound
like a broken record   
   but that s schizophrenia 
you don t sound like a broken record 
but it s just not schizophrenia 
what if what i said was true 
hypothetically speaking 
if i was part of a story  a narrative   
   even if it was only in my mind   
   what would you suggest that i do 
i would suggest
you take prescribed medication 
other than that 
i don t know 
i suppose i would send you to see
someone who knows about literature 
okay 
yeah  that s a good idea 
thank you 
so you re the gentleman
who called me about the narrator 
  yes 
  this narrator says you re gonna die 
yes 
  how long has it given you to live 
  i don t know 
dramatic irony 
it ll fuck you every time 
  so you crazy or what 
  well  
are you allowed to say that
to crazy people 
  i don t know 
  oh  well  how many stairs   
     in the hallway out there 
  what 
you were counting them
as we walked  weren t you 
no 
of course 
what bank do you work at 
no bank  irs agent 
  married 
  no 
ever 
engaged to an auditor 
she left me for an actuary 
  how heartbreaking  live alone 
  yes 
  any pets 
  no 
  friends 
  no  well  dave at work 
i see  the narrator 
exactly what does he sound like 
it s a woman 
a woman 
  is it a familiar woman 
  no 
someone you know 
no 
did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom 
i wasn t counting the tiles 
  coffee 
  no  thank you 
  sure 
  yes 
so this woman  the voice 
told you you re gonna die 
she didn t tell me 
she doesn t know i can hear her 
  but she said it 
  yes 
and you believed her 
she s been right
about a few other things 
  such as 
  how i felt about work 
  you dislike your work 
  yes 
well  not the most insightful voice
in the world  is it 
first thing on a list
of what americans hate  work 
second  traffic  third  missing socks 
see what i m saying 
sort of 
i told you you were gonna die 
you believe me 
  no 
  why 
i don t know you 
  but you don t know this narrator 
  well   
  okay  mr  crick  i can t help you 
  why 
well  i m not an expert in crazy 
i m an expert in literature theory 
and i gotta tell you  thus far   
   there doesn t seem to be a single
literary thing about you 
i don t doubt you hear a voice 
but it couldn t possibly be a narrator   
   because  frankly  there doesn t seem
to be much to narrate 
beside that  this semester
i m teaching five courses 
i m mentoring
two doctoral candidates   
   and i m the faculty lifeguard
at the pool 
  i just thought you could possibly  
  perhaps you should keep a journal 
write down what she said
or something 
that s all i can suggest 
i can barely remember it all 
i just remember 
 little did he know that this simple 
seemingly innocuous act   
   would lead to his imminent death  
  what 
   little did he know that this   
  did you say   little did he know  
  yes 
i ve written papers
on  little did he know  
i used to teach a class
based on  little did he know  
i mean  i once gave an entire seminar
on  little did he know  
son of a bitch  harold 
 little did he know  means there s
something he doesn t know   
   that means there s something
you don t know  did you know that 
  i want you to come back friday 
  okay 
no   imminent  
you could be dead by friday 
come back tomorrow at 9 45 
ten seconds ago
you said you wouldn t help me 
it s been a very revealing 10 seconds 
harold 
harold was deep in thought 
for a few  brief moments  from
born boulevard to euclid avenue   
   all the calculations
and all the rules   
   and all the precision of harold s life
just faded away 
how perfect then
that in this space   
   ana pascal would appear 
ms  pascal 
ms  pascal  it s harold crick
from the irs 
excuse me 
  hi 
  hi 
  would you like a seat 
  nope 
there s 11 open ones 
i don t care 
sorry about that 
how are you 
i m lousy  i m being audited 
of course 
by a real creep too 
i think i owe you an apology 
  really 
  irs agents   
   we re given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work 
unfortunately for you  we aren t tested
on tact or good manners   
   so i apologize 
i ogled you 
sorry 
okay  apology accepted 
but only because you stammered 
so you re a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too 
no  i m just late 
big flag burning to get to 
actually   
   it s my weekly evil conspiracy
and needlepoint group 
you wanna come 
i left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home 
so   
harold nervously made small talk 
you have very straight teeth 
very small talk 
thanks  they re real 
harold quickly calculated the odds
of making an ass of himself   
   in ratio to the amount of time
he stayed to chat 
this is my stop  i should go 
  he was elated and surprised   
  see you soon 
   by his somewhat flirtatious
encounter with ms  pascal 
so elated that he exited
the transit authority bus   
   a good 27 blocks too early
and would now have to walk 
   you ain t down yet  
  that s right 
tell us  what is you ain t got
nothin  on me about  emmett cole 
what does this mean 
well  it s about being around
in the world  doing different things   
     doing what you wanna do   
  come in 
mr  crick  come in  come in  please 
how are you 
i m fine  actually 
you can turn that off 
looks like our narrator
hasn t killed you quite yet 
  no  not yet 
  good  great  have a seat 
  count the stairs outside 
  no 
course not  i ve devised a test  
how exciting is that 
  of 23 questions   
   which i think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator 
  now  howard   
  harold 
harold  these may seem silly 
but your candor is paramount 
okay 
so 
we know it s a woman s voice 
the story involves your death   
   it s modern  it s in english 
i m assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city 
  sure 
  okay  good 
question one 
 has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home  
anything  gum  money 
  a large wooden horse 
  i m sorry 
  just answer the question 
  no 
 do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries   
   in large  luxurious homes
to which     let me finish 
 to which you may or may not
have been invited  
no  no  no  no 
all right  on a scale of one to 10   
   what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated 
assassinated 
one being very unlikely  10 being
expecting it around every corner 
  i have no idea  
  okay  let me rephrase 
are you the king of anything 
  like what 
  anything 
king of the lanes
at the local bowling alley 
 king of the lanes  
  king of the lanes  king of the trolls 
   king of the trolls  
yes  a clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards 
  anything 
  no 
no  that s ridiculous 
agreed  but let s start with ridiculous
and move backwards 
now  was any part of you at one time
part of something else 
like do i have someone else s arms 
well  is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone   
   wood  lye  varied corpse parts   
   or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders 
no  look    i m sorry  what do these
questions have to do with anything 
the only way to find out
what story you re in   
   is to determine what stories
you re not in 
odd as it may seem  i ve just ruled out
half of greek literature   
   seven fairy tales 
10 chinese fables   
   and determined conclusively
that you are not king hamlet   
   scout finch  miss marple   
   frankenstein s monster 
or a golem 
aren t you relieved to know
you re not a golem 
yes  i am relieved to know
that i am not a golem 
good 
do you have magical powers 
may i ask what we re doing out here 
  we re imagining car wrecks 
  i see 
and we can t imagine
car wrecks inside 
no 
did you know
that 41 percent of accidents   
   occur in times
of inclement weather 
so do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases 
really  pneumonia 
that s an interesting way to die 
but how would harold
catch pneumonia 
have you written
anything new today 
no 
did you read the poems i suggested 
or make a list of words   
   buy new typing paper  anything 
no  none of it 
sitting in the rain won t write books 
well  that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books 
what s this 
it s literature on the nicotine patch 
i don t need a nicotine patch  penny 
i smoke cigarettes 
well  it may help 
may help  help what 
help what  penny 
help write a novel 
may help save your life 
i m not in the business of saving lives 
in fact  just the opposite 
   what s your favorite word  
  integer 
good  good  good 
 do you aspire to anything  
  no 
  conquer russia 
  win a whistling contest 
  no 
harold  you must
have some ambition 
  i don t think so 
  some underlying dream  think 
well   
   i ve always wanted my life
to be more musical 
  like west side story 
  no 
  like   
  what 
well  i ve always wanted to learn
to play the guitar 
okay 
the last thing
to determine conclusively   
   is whether you re in a comedy
or a tragedy 
to quote italo calvino 
 the ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces 
the continuity of life 
the inevitability of death  
tragedy  you die 
comedy  you get hitched 
most comic heroes
fall in love with people   
   introduced after the story
has begun 
usually people
who hate the hero initially 
although i can t imagine anyone
hating you  harold 
professor hilbert  i m an irs agent 
everyone hates me 
right  right  good 
have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you 
i just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent 
well  that sounds like a comedy 
try to develop that 
four of these 
you know  i didn t get my honey 
honey 
lulu  can you refill the honey
for larry  quarters also 
that s my good boy 
i m adding some acorns 
mr  crick 
you re here early 
must have a lot of people to extort 
no  no  just you 
  twig tea and banana bread 
  yes  ma am 
actually  it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe 
well  i won t be paying no matter
the percentage  mr  crick 
no  i know  but the percent
determines how big your cell is 
you know  you can call me harold 
yeah  i know  but i don t want to 
this is for ramona  honey 
  oh  thank you 
  you re very welcome 
what is that 
what are you marking 
oh  this is nothing 
why don t we start
with your backup documents   
   and the receipts
for the past three years 
sure 
what s this 
  my files 
  what 
my tax files 
you keep your files like this 
no  actually i m quite fastidious 
i put them in this box
just to screw with you 
  hi 
  hi  how are you 
so how was it  aruba 
ms  pascal  can i just ask you
a question about this receipt 
  it was fantastic 
  just wondering if this nine is a seven 
  and what did you do 
  i got a beautiful tan 
  i m just gonna guess it s a seven 
  i mean  i feel stress free 
do you need help with that 
  walk to heaven  i see the president 
  it s the taxman  hello  mr  taxman

bye now 
bye bye 
well  good night 
you want a cookie 
oh  no 
come on  they re warm and gooey 
they re fresh out of the oven 
no  i don t like cookies 
you don t like cookies 
  what s wrong with you 
  i don t know 
  everybody likes cookies 
  no  i know 
i mean  after a really awful 
no good day   
   didn t your mama ever make you
milk and cookies 
no  my mother didn t bake 
the only cookies i ever had
were store bought 
okay  sit down 
  no  i m  
  no 
sit down 
now   
   eat a cookie 
i really can t 
mr  crick  it was a really awful day 
i know  i made sure of it 
so pick up the cookie   
   dip it in the milk   
   and eat it 
that s a really  really good cookie 
so when did you decide
to become a baker 
  in college 
  oh  like a cooking college 
i went to harvard law actually 
  oh  i m sorry  i just assumed it was  
  no  no  it s fine  i didn t finish 
  did something happen 
  no 
i was barely accepted 
i mean  really barely 
the only reason they let me come
was because of my essay 
how i was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree 
anyway  we would have to participate
in these study sessions   
   my classmates and i 
sometimes all night long 
and so i d bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked 
sometimes i would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm   
   and then i d bring my little treats
to the study groups   
   and people loved them 
eat 
i made oatmeal cookies 
peanut butter bars   
   dark chocolate
macadamia nut wedges 
and everyone would eat
and stay happy   
   and study harder
and do better on the tests 
more and more people started
coming to the study groups   
   and i d bring more snacks 
i was always looking
for better and better recipes   
   until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants   
   and mocha bars
with an almond glaze   
   and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing 
and at the end of the semester
i had 27 study partners   
   eight mead journals
filled with recipes   
   and a d average 
so i dropped out 
i figured if i was gonna
make the world a better place   
   i would do it with cookies 
you like them 
i do 
i m glad 
thank you for forcing me
to eat them 
you re welcome 
i should go  oh  thank you 
for the cookies  i mean 
  why don t you take them home 
  oh  no 
  oh  come on 
  no  really  please 
  no  really  please 
  no  no  no  really  please 
i would like to  but i can t 
  you can t 
  no  no  i mean  
because  see  it constitutes a gift 
actually i shouldn t have even had
those other ones  so   
okay  well  i m not
gonna tell anyone 
  no  i know  but if you did   
  well  i m not going to 
i know  but if you did  
  what  you think i m gonna call the   
  no  no  i ll purchase them 
i m happy to purchase them 
how s that 
and then there are no issues 
  what 
  no 
  please 
  just   
  why don t i just   
  go home 
really  it s not a big deal 
go home 
okay 
did you    
you baked those cookies for me 
didn t you 
you were just trying to be nice
and i totally blew it 
this may sound like gibberish
to you   
   but i think i m in a tragedy 
professor hilbert  i ve totally failed
at the comedy tragedy thing 
in fact  i think she likes me even less 
  i know  it s great 
  what do you mean 
you ve proved something else
entirely 
the voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take 
you reset your watch 
it says you reset your watch 
you ride a bus 
it says you ride the bus 
you brush your teeth 
it says you brush your teeth 
it may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story 
  so i suggest we try something else 
  like what 
  try nothing  nothing 
  what about ms  pascal 
  forget her 
  forget her 
other than numbers 
she s all i think about 
harold  if you wanna stay alive 
you ll try something else 
  that something being nothing 
  nothing  exactly 
  nothing 
  let me explain this again 
some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises 
others are moved forward
by the characters themselves 
if i go through that door 
the plot continues 
the story of me through the door 
if i stay here   
   the plot can t move forward 
the story ends 
also if i stay here  i m late 
  don t do anything tomorrow 
  nothing 
stay home  don t answer the phone 
open the door  brush your teeth 
  what about work 
  call them 
  tell them you re not coming 
  don t go to work 
don t do anything that may
move the plot forward 
instead  let s see if the plot finds you 
marshall  you re not kicking 
  certain that these geese have never
known any home but this one 
a small lake in eastern poland 
pollution from a nearby factory
is slowly killing   
   the small fish and insects
on which these creatures feed 
all attempts to move the birds to
similar bodies of water have failed 
perhaps it is the familiarity alone
that keeps them here 
or perhaps it s an unwillingness
to lose the collective memory   
   of the once beautiful hills
that surround the lake 
and it takes only seconds
for the fiddler crabs to realize   
   that the wader
they might once have feared   
   has now become their prey 
the wounded bird knows its fate 
its desperate attempts to escape   
   only underscore the hopelessness
of its plight 
the primates  sad  soulful eyes
will be the first to be plucked out   
   then sold to cosmetic companies
around the world   
   for use in the testing of mascara
and artificial tears 
next  the monkeys  fur will be stripped
away from their limp corpses   
   and sewn together
to form pillows and comforters 
mr  zebra thought he was gonna
take a nice drink 
but you never know
who s gonna eat   
   when you re dining
at mother nature s restaurant 
that s gotta hurt  what does
this bald eagle wanna serve   
   with some kidney beans
and a fine chianti 
it s an eel  and again 
looks like old mr  crocodile
wanted some antelope   
   to clear that salty zebra
from his palate 
here s a struggle betting gentlemen
have been known to put money on 
when a mongoose encounters a cobra
it s hard to know who s gonna win 
but this time it looks like
it s    the cobra   
   who s putting the squeeze
on the mongoose 
but don t cash in your chips
just yet  gentlemen   
   because now it s the mongoose
who holds the winning card 
hey  hey 
hey  hey  hey  what are you doing  
  holy crapping hell 
  what the hell is that 
  stop the crane  stop it 
  stop the crane 
  hey 
  hey  what are you doing 
us  what are you doing 
i was watching tv 
  well  we re demolishing this place 
  are you nuts  i live here 
  is that a tv 
  yes  that s a tv  it s my tv 
  well  what s your tv doing in there 
  i said i live here  stupid 
it s where i keep my stuff 
my name s on the goddamn buzzer 
harold crick 
apartment 2 b  1893 mccarthy 
  did you say 1893 
  yes 
i m not exactly sure it was plot 
i was hoping you d say it was
just a really bad coincidence 
meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence 
getting a letter from the emperor
saying that he s visiting is plot 
having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball   
   is something else entirely 
harold  you don t control your fate 
  i know 
  you do 
okay  come with me 
hey  tom  can you leave that
till tomorrow 
you were right 
this narrator might very well kill you   
   so i humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life 
go live my life  i am living my life 
i d like to continue to live my life 
i know  of course  i mean all of it 
however long you have left 
you know  i mean  howard 
you could use it to have an adventure 
you know  invent something  or just
finish reading crime and punishment 
hell  harold  you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted 
what s wrong with you 
hey  i don t wanna eat
nothing but pancakes  i wanna live 
who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living   
   chooses pancakes 
harold  if you d pause to think
i believe you d realize   
   that that answer s
inextricably contingent   
   upon the type of life being led   
   and  of course 
the quality of the pancakes 
you don t understand
what i m saying 
yes  i do 
but you have to understand that this
isn t a philosophy or a literary theory   
   or a story to me  it s my life 
absolutely  so just go make it the one
you ve always wanted 
i never expected
that they would have  
  do you want one  two 
  i want one 
  one 
  i want two 
all right  so here s your room 
or as i like to call it  sleep pod two 
thanks  dave 
no problem  dude 
it ll be nice having you around 
  how long you planning on staying 
  i m not sure 
dave  can i pose a somewhat abstract 
purely hypothetical question 
sure 
if you knew you were gonna die   
   possibly soon   
   what would you do 
wow  i don t know 
am i the richest man in the world 
no  you re you 
do i have a superpower 
no  you re you 
i know i m me 
but do i have a superpower 
no  why would you
have a superpower 
i don t know 
you said it was hypothetical 
fine  yes  you re really good at math 
that s not a power  that s a skill 
okay  you re good at math
and you re invisible 
  and you know you re gonna die 
  okay  okay 
that s easy  i d go to space camp 
space camp 
yeah  it s in alabama  it s where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts 
i ve always wanted to go
since i was 9 
you re invisible
and you d go to space camp 
i didn t pick invisible 
you picked invisible 
aren t you too old
to go to space camp 
you re never too old
to go to space camp  dude 
space camp 
one hundred and twenty two
guitars 
seven hundred and thirty two
strings 
two hundred and fifty seven
pickups 
one hundred and eighty nine
volume knobs 
here harold stood  face to face
with his oldest desire 
and stand is almost all harold did 
it wasn t just about finding
a guitar 
it was about finding a guitar
that said something about harold 
unfortunately  this guitar said 
 when i get back to georgia 
that woman gonna feel my pain  
this one said something
along the lines of 
 why  yes  these pants are lycra  
these said   i m very sensitive 
very caring   
   and i have absolutely no idea
how to play the guitar  
 i m compensating for something 
guess what  
and then harold saw it 
a damaged and terribly mistreated
sea foam green fender   
   staring back at him 
despite its obvious maladies   
   the guitar spoke
with conviction and swagger 
in fact  it looked harold directly
in the eye and very plainly stated 
 i rock  
just breathe  watch it 
we ve got a 21  year old male
with a gunshot wound to the chest 
there you go 
shot in a gang fight 
harold s not in a gang 
man in tweed 
there s nothing wrong with him 
he just likes looking at sick people 
oddly spoken with disdain 
this isn t working 
well   i don t even know
why we re here 
i don t think we re supposed
to be here 
  you said i needed visual stimuli 
  i meant a museum 
i don t need a goddamn museum 
i need the infirm 
you are the infirm 
you re right  the problem is
these people aren t dead   
   they re just severely injured 
excuse me 
where are the dying people 
most of these people
are sick or injured  
which is great  don t get me wrong 
  but they re gonna get better 
which doesn t really help me 
is there any way to see the people
who aren t going to get better 
excuse me 
i d like to see  if at all possible 
the ones who aren t gonna make it 
you know  the dead for sure ones 
i m sorry 
are you suffering from anything 
just writer s block 
with every awkward strum   
   harold crick became stronger
in who he was   
   what he wanted 
and why he was alive 
harold no longer ate alone 
he no longer counted brushstrokes 
  harold  i ll see you 
  he no longer wore neckties 
bye  dave 
and  therefore  no longer worried
about the time it took to put them on 
he no longer counted his steps
to the bus stop 
instead  harold did that
which had terrified him before 
that which had eluded him
monday through friday   
   for so many years 
that which the unrelenting lyrics   
   of numerous punk rock songs
told him to do 
harold crick lived his life 
but despite resuscitating his life   
   reviving his hope  and instilling
a few wicked calluses   
   harold s journey
was still incomplete 
and harold s wristwatch wasn t about
to let him miss another opportunity 
ms  pascal 
  ms  pascal 
  mr  crick 
  hi 
  hi 
  hi 
  hi 
i m glad i caught you 
oh  yeah  why 
because i wanted
to bring these to you 
  really 
  yeah 
so you can t accept gifts 
but you can give them 
  listen  
  i don t know 
that seems a little inconsistent 
doesn t it  mr  crick 
very inconsistent  yes 
i ll tell you what 
i ll purchase them 
  no 
  no  no  no  really   
   i d like to purchase them 
what are they 
flours 
  what 
  i brought you flours 
and you carried them
all the way here 
ms  pascal  i ve been odd
and i know that i ve been odd 
and i want you 
  what 
  there s so many reasons 
there s so many influences in my life
that are telling me   
   at times quite literally   
   that i should come here
and bring you these   
   but i m doing this
because i want you 
you want me 
in no uncertain terms 
isn t there some very clear
and established   
   rule about fraternization 
  auditor auditee protocol 
  yeah 
yeah  but i don t care 
  why 
  because i want you 
well   
   do you mind carrying those
a little bit further 
okay 
okay 
did you make a key 
no  i just committed it to memory 
  the blue  that s barley flour 
  what s that one 
  the orange 
  yeah 
i forget 
right here 
do you wanna come up 
  to your place 
  yeah 
i guess i could 
wasn t that the idea with the flours
and everything 
honestly  i only figured it out
up to  i want you  
listen  mr  crick   
   i think i like you 
and before i do anything rash 
i d like to make sure 
i d like you to come up 
i d be honored 
great 
yeah  he was nuts though 
he got caught when he tried
to get the contract notarized 
no  no 
was it good 
thank you 
  you re welcome 
  can i help you 
no  no  i m gonna put them in the sink 
go sit down on the couch 
so do you play the guitar 
  what 
  do you play the guitar 
terribly  someone traded me that
for a wedding cake 
does that mean i have to claim it
on my taxes now 
  no  i ll leave it out of my final report 
  oh  thanks 
do you play 
not really  i only know one song 
oh  play it 
no  i don t know it that well  actually 
no  come on  i promise i m not gonna
laugh at you  play it 
no  no  no  maybe some other time 
all right 
ms  pascal 
  i   
  i know 
i want you too 
harold s life was filled with moments
both significant and mundane 
but to harold  those moments
remained entirely indistinguishable   
   except for this 
as ana let out a soft sigh and
repositioned herself against him   
   harold knew
somewhere in his heart   
   that this was one
of the significant moments 
he knew she was
falling in love with him 
professor hilbert  it s a comedy 
  what 
  a comedy 
the woman  the one who hates me 
ana pascal 
  last night   
  yeah 
she s falling in love with me 
  she is 
  it s like a miracle 
the voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night 
well  that s wonderful  harold 
i mean  it completely nullifies my list 
but that s fantastic 
what list 
these are seven living authors
whose prior work   
   would seem to make them
candidates to write your story   
   based on the criteria you and i
previously determined 
if your narrator is alive 
she s on this list 
but it appears the list
is of little use to you now 
now that you re gonna live
happily ever after 
oh  goodie  this woman  karen eiffel 
she s one of my favorite authors 
  hi 
  hi 
beautiful tragedies  just beautiful 
anyway   
   let me quickly copy this list for you 
just in case 
sociopathic author 
  i just wanted to thank you 
  of course 
listen  please  you must tell me if you
hear the voice of the narrator again   
   just for my own edification 
i will 
well  it s called death and taxes 
wow  you know  i m from texas 
no  not  texas   taxes 
death and taxes 
death and taxes 
taxes 
like the benjamin franklin quote 
precisely so 
this lady s a package 
i m telling you 
tell us  what is this next book
going to be about 
it s about interconnectivity 
the looming certainty of death 
men s fashion accessories 
  oh  my god  that s her 
  what 
  that s the voice  she s the narrator 
  no  that can t be right 
no  i m positive 
harold  this interview s a decade old 
i didn t think anyone actually
wore cuff links anymore 
that s her 
  she s british 
  she s her 
  karen eiffel 
  professor hilbert  i know that voice 
crap 
  what s wrong 
  first of all  she wasn t on my list 
i figured you would have mentioned
the accent and she doesn t   
she kills people 
  what 
  in every book she  
the books are all about  
they die  she kills them 
  kills who 
  the heroes 
four black veils  what is that 
it s about a girl who loses
several members of her family   
   in quick succession 
where is she 
she s untraceable  believe me 
i used to teach a class on her 
i ve written her letters  i mean 
she s a hermit  she s a recluse 
here  here s the last book she wrote 
look at the copyright  she hasn t
published anything in 10 years 
she had knowledge of the city 
does she live here 
she used to  yes  but i mean  
banneker press  2267 wallace street 
is that her publisher 
you re not listening  i said even
if you find her she s not gonna  
thank you for your help 
she only writes tragedies 
i don t believe in god 
okay  he s bringing her flours 
kay  where you been 
i went out to buy cigarettes   
   and i figured out
how to kill harold crick 
buying cigarettes 
as i was  
when i came out of the store   
   it came to me 
how 
well  penny 
like anything worth writing   
   it came inexplicably
and without method 
i see  then what happens 
it s perfect  actually  i can t believe
i didn t think of it earlier 
it s simple  ironic   
   possibly heartbreaking 
is that it 
yes 
  you wrote it on legal sheets 
  on the bus 
well  then 
so i ll finish it today 
i ll let the publishers know 
i ll begin packing my things 
i appreciate it 
  hi  hello  hi 
  may i help you

hi  harold  nice sweater

within moments  harold found himself
running across the plaza   
   heading for the nearest
pay phone 
at last  he spotted it 
but as harold neared the phone 
he saw it was occupied   
   by an octogenarian determined
to reach his daughter in denver   
   no matter how many quarters
it took 
fortunately  harold remembered
a bank of phones   
   in the sixth street subway tunnel 
the baby s name isn t mrs  epstein 
my daughter s name is mrs  epstein 
the first phone
failed to give a dial tone 
and the second
seemed to be splattered   
   with a fresh batch of mucus 
harold dialed the third phone   
   fervently making sure to give each
number key a specific forceful push 
don t answer that 
didn t you say this phone never r   
  hello

   in the grand scheme
it wouldn t matter 
  yes  it would 
  no 
i could change 
i could quit my job 
i could go away with ana 
i could be someone else 
harold  listen to me 
i can t die right now 
it s just really bad timing 
no one wants to die  harold 
but unfortunately we do 
harold   
harold  listen to me 
harold  you will die someday 
sometime 
heart failure at the bank 
choke on a mint 
some long  drawn out disease
you contracted on vacation 
you will die  you will absolutely die 
even if you avoid this death 
another will find you 
and i guarantee that it won t be nearly
as poetic or meaningful   
   as what she s written 
i m sorry   
   but it s the nature of all tragedies 
harold 
the hero dies 
but the story lives on forever 
  there s an empty seat right there 
  no  i wanna sit down over here 
kay 
kay 
how many people
do you think i ve killed 
  kay 
  how many 
  i don t know 
  eight 
  kay  
  i ve killed eight people  i counted 
they re fictional  get up 
harold crick isn t fictional 
  i don t  
  he isn t fictional  penny 
every book i ve ever written ends
with someone dying  every one 
really nice people too 
the book about helen
the schoolteacher 
i killed her
the day before summer vacation 
how cruel is that 
and the civil engineer  edward 
the one i trapped   
   with a heart attack in rush hour 
i killed him 
i killed   
penny  i killed them all 
miss eiffel  miss eiffel 
  harold 
  hi 
  i just finished it 
  you just   
yeah  i read it all in one read
on the bus 
it s lovely 
i like the part about the guitars 
well  thanks  thanks  goo  
well  listen  i m  
no  i read it and i loved it 
and there s only one way it can end 
i mean  i don t have much background
in literary anything   
   but this seems simple enough 
i love your book 
and i think you should finish it 
the night before his death   
   harold unsuspectingly went about
some usual business 
he finished his outstanding audits 
he made a few phone calls
he had been putting off 
listen  does your program
have an age limit 
and he traveled to ms  pascal s   
   where she made him meat loaf
and chocolate pudding   
   and the two watched old movies 
it was a nice enough evening 
and in any other circumstance
it would ve seemed commonplace 
in fact  the only thing
that made this night significant   
   was the morning it preceded 
i have to tell you something 
you do 
i do 
  is it a secret 
  sort of 
tell me 
i adore you 
i adore you too 
  that it 
  no 
i have to tell you this 
i just want you to listen carefully 
okay 
you can deduct the value
of all the food you give away   
     as a charitable contribution 
  harold 
no  no  no  in fact it amounts to more
than what you re currently withholding 
and it doesn t break any tax laws 
harold  the point
is to break the tax laws 
i wanna make the world
a better place too  ana 
i think that means
keeping you out of jail 
okay 
okay 
  yeah 
  okay 
if you come over here   
   and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear 
because i like it so much 
much had changed for harold
over the past few weeks 
his attitude towards work 
his habitual counting 
his love life 
but of all the transmutations
harold crick had undergone   
   perhaps the most significant
was that today on his return to work   
   he was not late
for the 8 17 kronecker bus 
what harold had not understood   
   about that wednesday
four weeks prior   
   was that the time he received from
his fellow commuter   
   was  in fact  three full minutes
later than the actual time   
   and  therefore  three full minutes
later   
   than the time to which his watch
and life had been previously set 
not the worst of errors 
but if harold had not set his watch
to the incorrect time   
   harold would have again
barely caught the 8 17 kronecker bus 
and he would not be approaching
the bus stop   
   precisely at 8 14
this particular friday 
excuse me 
harold 
an otherwise ignorable fact   
   until the unthinkable occurred 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
i need for everyone
to just stay seated 
come on  son 
  what happened  i didn t see him 
  it was not your fault 
he was trying to help the boy 
get your supervisor 
i don t believe this 
  it was all my fault  though 
  no  it wasn t 
is he okay 
  it looks likes he s breathing 
  i don t think he s breathing 
oh  my god 
come in 
excuse me 
are you professor hilbert 
yes 
hi  i m karen eiffel 
i believe we have
a mutual acquaintance 
please  sit down 
no  i just came by to   
here 
  is that it 
  yes 
have you read it 
is that all right 
yes 
i think  perhaps  you may be
interested in the new ending 
good afternoon 
oh  hi 
it s a pretty brave thing you did 
stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave 
kind of stupid  but pretty brave 
oh  yeah 
is that boy okay 
he s just fine  scratched up is all 
oh  good 
am i okay 
well  you re not dead 
on the other hand  it looks like
you cracked your head   
   you broke three bones
in your leg and foot   
   you suffered four broken ribs 
fractured your left arm   
   and severed an artery in your right 
which should ve killed you in minutes 
but amazingly   
   a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery   
   keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive   
   which is pretty cool 
yeah 
so with some physical therapy   
   a few months of rest 
you should be fine 
well  sort of  we weren t able
to remove the shard of watch   
   from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage 
you ll be okay 
you ll just have a piece of watch   
   embedded in your arm
the rest of your life 
you re very lucky to be alive 
mr  crick 
yeah 
  dr  mercator  mr  crick has a visitor 
  sure 
  my god  harold 
  hey 
  i m okay  it s all right 
  harold 
i m fine 
harold  you re not fine 
look at you  you re severely injured 
  no  i m fine 
  what    what happened 
i stepped in front of a bus 
what  why 
there was a boy 
i had to push him out of the way 
what 
i had to keep this boy from getting hit 
you stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy 
i didn t have a choice 
i had to 
it s    it s okay 
  it s not great 
  no 
it s okay  it s not bad 
it s not the most amazing piece
of english literature in several years   
   but it s okay 
you know   
   i think i m fine with  okay  
it doesn t make sense
with the rest of the book though 
no  not yet  i ll rewrite the rest 
my assistant said
she d go back to the publisher   
     and request more time 
  why 
don t know  it s awfully sweet though 
no  why did you change the book 
lots of reasons 
i realized i just couldn t do it 
because he s real 
because it s a book about a man   
   who doesn t know he s about to die
and then dies 
but if the man does know
he s going to die and dies anyway   
   dies willingly 
knowing he could stop it  then   
i mean  isn t that the type of man
you want to keep alive 
as harold took a bite
of bavarian sugar cookie   
   he finally felt as if everything
was going to be okay 
sometimes  when we lose ourselves
in fear and despair   
   in routine and constancy   
   in hopelessness and tragedy   
   we can thank god
for bavarian sugar cookies 
and fortunately 
when there aren t any cookies   
   we can still find reassurance
in a familiar hand on our skin   
   or a kind and loving gesture   
   or a subtle encouragement   
   or a loving embrace   
   or an offer of comfort 
not to mention hospital gurneys   
   and nose plugs   
   and uneaten danish   
   and soft spoken secrets   
   and fender stratocasters   
   and maybe the occasional piece
of fiction 
and we must remember
that all these things   
   the nuances  the anomalies 
the subtleties   
   which we assume
only accessorize our days   
   are  in fact  here for a much larger
and nobler cause 
they are here to save our lives
