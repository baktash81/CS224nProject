numbers
endless calculations
and remarkably few words
and his wristwatch said even less
every weekday for 12 years
harold would brush
each of his 32 teeth 76 times
thirtyeight times back and forth
thirtyeight times up and down
every weekday for 12 years
harold would tie his tie in a single
windsor knot instead of the double
thereby saving up to 43 seconds
his wristwatch thought the single
windsor made his neck look fat
but said nothing
every weekday for 12 years
harold would run at a rate of nearly
57 steps per block for six blocks
barely catching
the 817 kronecker bus
his wristwatch would delight
in the feeling of the crisp wind
rushing over its face
and every weekday for 12 years
harold would review 7 134
tax files
as a senior agent
for the internal revenue service
regs section 1 4692 b i diane
thanks
good morning irs
harold 89 times 1417
that adds up
only taking a 45 7minute
lunch break
and a 43minute coffee break
timed precisely by his wristwatch
oh great
yeah well go to mullens or well
beyond that
harold lived a life of solitude
he would walk home alone
he would eat alone
and at precisely 1113 every night
harold would go to bed alone
placing his wristwatch to rest
on the nightstand beside him
that was of course
before wednesday
on wednesday harolds wristwatch
changed everything
oh my god you got it
i got it
i got it
if one had asked harold
he would have said
that this particular wednesday was
exactly like all the wednesdays prior
and he began it the same way he
and he began it the same way
he always did
hello
he began it the same way
he always did
when others minds would
hello is someone there
when others minds would fantasize
about their upcoming day
or even try to grip onto
the final moments of their dreams
harold just counted brushstrokes
all right who just said
harold just counted brushstrokes
and how do you know im counting
brushstrokes
hello
it was remarkable how the simple
modest
it was remarkable h
it was remarkable how the simple
modest elements of harolds life
so often taken for granted
would become the catalyst
for an entirely new life
harold ran for the bus
his stiff leather shoes
making a terrible squeaking sound
as they flexed against the asphalt
and though this was
an extraordinary day
a day to be remembered
for the rest of harolds life
harold just thought
it was a wednesday
im sorry did you hear that
the voice did you hear it
harold thought it was a wednesday
dont worry it is wednesday
no no did you hear it harold
just thought it was a wednesday
whos harold
im harold
harold its okay its wednesday
no no i
never mind
harold couldnt concentrate
on his work
excuse me harold
his thoughts were scattered
his mind elsewhere
sorry
someone here should be able to fix
hold on a second
hey harold whats 67 times 453
when a coworker asked
the product of 67 and 453
you know what
i cant think while youre talking
he drew a blank
what
what
harold quickly answered 30351
what oh nothing 30351
despite the answer
really being 31305
wait wait wait 31305 sorry
dude i just totally caught
some insurance adjuster
claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle
ill tell you it is a shame
that they dont give out
an auditor of the year award
dude
you okay
dave im being followed
how are you being followed
youre not moving
its by a voice
what
im being followed
by a womans voice
okay
what is she saying
shes narrating
harold youre staring at boxes
what is she narrating
no no no i had to stop filing
watch watch listen listen
the sound the paper made
against the folder
had the same tone
as a wave scraping against sand
and when harold thought about it
he listened to enough waves
every day
to constitute what he imagined
to be a deep and endless ocean
did you hear that
you mean you filing
no no no the voice
no
frightening part is sometimes i do
imagine a deep and endless ocean
what ocean
the one made by the sound
forget it
new audits have a good day
thank you
all right we got a baker
and a securities trader
maybe you should take the baker
okay
okay
damn it damn it damn it
you miscreant
i understand
oh get bent taxman
taxman
taxman
taxman
go home
listen is there somewhere else
we could talk about this
no were gonna talk about this
right here
okay it says the file that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year
thats right
looks like only 78 percent
yep
so you did it on purpose
yep
so you must have been
expecting an audit
i was expecting a fine
or a sharp reprimand
a reprimand this isnt
boarding school ms pascal
you stole from the government
no i didnt steal from the government
i just didnt pay you entirely
ms pascal you cant just
not pay your taxes
yes i can
you can if you wanna get audited
only if i recognize your right
to audit me mr crick
ms pascal im right here
auditing you
now i have to go over
your past three years
to make sure
thats all you havent paid
fine
actually you know its not fine
listen im a big supporter
of fixing potholes
and erecting swing sets
and building shelters
i am more than happy
to pay those taxes
im just not such a big fan
of the percentage
that the government uses
for national defense
corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds
so i didnt pay those taxes
i think actually
i sent a letter to that effect
with my return
would it be the letter that begins
dear imperialist swine
yes
ms pascal what youre describing
is anarchy are you an anarchist
you mean am i a member of
an anarchist group yes
anarchists have a group
i believe so sure
they assemble
i dont know
wouldnt that completely
defeat the purpose
it was difficult for harold to imagine
ms pascal as a revolutionary
not now
her thin arms
what
hoisting protest signs
her long shapely legs
nothing
dashing from tear gas
harold wasnt prone to fantasies
and so he tried his best
to remain professional
but of course failed
he couldnt help but imagine
ms pascal
stroking the side of his face
with the soft blade of her finger
he couldnt help but imagine her
immersed in a tub
shaving her legs
and he couldnt help
but imagine her naked
stretched across his bed
mr crick
mr crick
yes what is it
youre staring at my tits
i wa i dont think i was
i dont think i would do that
if i was i can assure you
it was only as a representative
of the united states government
sorry im just having issues today
so ill be back on tuesday
harold suddenly found himself
beleaguered and exasperated
outside the bakery
shut up
cursing the heavens in futility
no im not im cursing you
you stupid voice
so shut up and leave me alone
hey watch it
excuse me
excuse me
are you miss eiffel
yes
excellent
may i ask what youre doing
research
oh am i interrupting
yes
im sorry im penny escher
im the assistant
your publishers hired
the spy
the assistant
i provide the same services
as a secretary
i dont need a secretary
then i will have to find some
other way of occupying my time
like watching me like a vulture
because the publishers
think i have writers block right
do you have writers block
are these pages
theyre letters to me
are you writing back
i dont respond to letters
and i suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes
no they came presmoked
yeah they said you were funny
what do you think about
leaping off a building
i dont think about
leaping off buildings
yes you do
no i try to think of nice things
everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings
well i certainly dont think about
leaping off of a building
they say
i read this in this
fantastically depressing book
that when you jump
from a building
its rarely the impact
that actually kills you
well im sure it doesnt help
theres a photograph
in the book called the leaper
its old but its beautiful
from above the corpse of a woman
whod just leapt to her death
theres blood around her head
like a halo
and her legs buckled underneath
her arms snapped like a twig
but her face is so serene
so at peace
and i think its because
when she died
she could feel the wind
against her face
i dont know how to kill harold crick
thats why they sent you
yes to help you
how are you gonna help me
you who never thinks
of leaping off buildings
what great inspiration
will you bestow on me
ill tell you the quaint ideas
youve gathered
in your adorable career
as an assistant
are to no avail
when faced with killing a man
i understand
do you i cant just
as much as i would like to
i cannot simply throw
harold crick off a building
miss eiffel kay ive been
an authors assistant for 11 years
ive helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books
and ive never missed the deadline
and i have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time
now i will be available to you
every minute of every day
until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page
i do not like loud music
i do not abide narcotics
and i will gladly and quietly
help you kill harold crick
i had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section
yeah
they said you were feeling
a little wibblywobbly
catch a little cubicle fever
oh i dont know i think im okay
harold a tree doesnt think
its a tree
it is a tree
why was harold talking to this man
this man was an idiot
this man used words like
wibblywobbly and convo
and explained that trees were trees
of course trees were trees
harold knew trees were trees
i am going to believe you harold
what harold didnt know
was why he couldnt shake
the smell of brownies
from his senses
why ms pascal had made
his fingertips quiver and lips go numb
harold
yes sorry
whats going on harold
well
nothing everythings fine
listen according to your records
you havent taken vacation
in a few years now
lets say you take a little break
use some of that vaca time
yeah ill think about it
harold
im not really supposed to do this
but
harold assumed his watch
was simply on the fritz
and never even considered that it
might be trying to tell him something
in fact harold had never once
paid attention to his watch
other than to find out the time
and honestly
it drove his watch crazy
and so on this particular
wednesday evening
as harold waited for the bus
his watch suddenly
stopped
sorry does anyone have the time
yeah i got 618
thanks
thus harolds watch thrust him
into the immitigable path of fate
little did he know that this simple
seemingly innocuous act
would result in his imminent death
what what
hey hello
what
why
why my death
hello
excuse me
when
how imminent
okay where are you
harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times
why wont you say anything
i heard you
that would result
in his imminent death
i heard you
come on you stupid voice
harold frantically grabbed his lamp
harold incensed shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason
and smashed it on the ground
kicking it repeatedly
harold took his kleenex box
threw it across the room
then stormed the closet
come on say something
something say something
say something
harold distraught
god
harold distraught
harold
im afraid what youre describing
is schizophrenia
no no its not schizophrenia
its just a voice in my head
i mean the voice isnt telling me
to do anything
its telling me what ive already done
accurately
and with a better vocabulary
mr crick you have a voice
speaking to you
no not to me about me
im somehow involved
in some sort of story
like im a character in my own life
but the problem is
that the voice comes and goes
like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me
and i need to find out what those
other parts are before its too late
before the story concludes
with your death
yes
mr crick i hate to sound
like a broken record
but thats schizophrenia
you dont sound like a broken record
but its just not schizophrenia
what if what i said was true
hypothetically speaking
if i was part of a story a narrative
even if it was only in my mind
what would you suggest that i do
i would suggest
you take prescribed medication
other than that
i dont know
i suppose i would send you to see
someone who knows about literature
okay
yeah thats a good idea
thank you
so youre the gentleman
who called me about the narrator
yes
this narrator says youre gonna die
yes
how long has it given you to live
i dont know
dramatic irony
itll fuck you every time
so you crazy or what
well
are you allowed to say that
to crazy people
i dont know
oh well how many stairs
in the hallway out there
what
you were counting them
as we walked werent you
no
of course
what bank do you work at
no bank irs agent
married
no
ever
engaged to an auditor
she left me for an actuary
how heartbreaking live alone
yes
any pets
no
friends
no well dave at work
i see the narrator
exactly what does he sound like
its a woman
a woman
is it a familiar woman
no
someone you know
no
did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom
i wasnt counting the tiles
coffee
no thank you
sure
yes
so this woman the voice
told you youre gonna die
she didnt tell me
she doesnt know i can hear her
but she said it
yes
and you believed her
shes been right
about a few other things
such as
how i felt about work
you dislike your work
yes
well not the most insightful voice
in the world is it
first thing on a list
of what americans hate work
second traffic third missing socks
see what im saying
sort of
i told you you were gonna die
you believe me
no
why
i dont know you
but you dont know this narrator
well
okay mr crick i cant help you
why
well im not an expert in crazy
im an expert in literature theory
and i gotta tell you thus far
there doesnt seem to be a single
literary thing about you
i dont doubt you hear a voice
but it couldnt possibly be a narrator
because frankly there doesnt seem
to be much to narrate
beside that this semester
im teaching five courses
im mentoring
two doctoral candidates
and im the faculty lifeguard
at the pool
i just thought you could possibly
perhaps you should keep a journal
write down what she said
or something
thats all i can suggest
i can barely remember it all
i just remember
little did he know that this simple
seemingly innocuous act
would lead to his imminent death
what
little did he know that this
did you say little did he know
yes
ive written papers
on little did he know
i used to teach a class
based on little did he know
i mean i once gave an entire seminar
on little did he know
son of a bitch harold
little did he know means theres
something he doesnt know
that means theres something
you dont know did you know that
i want you to come back friday
okay
no imminent
you could be dead by friday
come back tomorrow at 945
ten seconds ago
you said you wouldnt help me
its been a very revealing 10 seconds
harold
harold was deep in thought
for a few brief moments from
born boulevard to euclid avenue
all the calculations
and all the rules
and all the precision of harolds life
just faded away
how perfect then
that in this space
ana pascal would appear
ms pascal
ms pascal its harold crick
from the irs
excuse me
hi
hi
would you like a seat
nope
theres 11 open ones
i dont care
sorry about that
how are you
im lousy im being audited
of course
by a real creep too
i think i owe you an apology
really
irs agents
were given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work
unfortunately for you we arent tested
on tact or good manners
so i apologize
i ogled you
sorry
okay apology accepted
but only because you stammered
so youre a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too
no im just late
big flagburning to get to
actually
its my weekly evilconspiracy
and needlepoint group
you wanna come
i left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home
so
harold nervously made small talk
you have very straight teeth
very small talk
thanks theyre real
harold quickly calculated the odds
of making an ass of himself
in ratio to the amount of time
he stayed to chat
this is my stop i should go
he was elated and surprised
see you soon
by his somewhat flirtatious
encounter with ms pascal
so elated that he exited
the transit authority bus
a good 27 blocks too early
and would now have to walk
you aint down yet
thats right
tell us what is you aint got
nothin on me about emmett cole
what does this mean
well its about being around
in the world doing different things
doing what you wanna do
come in
mr crick come in come in please
how are you
im fine actually
you can turn that off
looks like our narrator
hasnt killed you quite yet
no not yet
good great have a seat
count the stairs outside
no
course not ive devised a test
how exciting is that
of 23 questions
which i think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator
now howard
harold
harold these may seem silly
but your candor is paramount
okay
so
we know its a womans voice
the story involves your death
its modern its in english
im assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city
sure
okay good
question one
has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home
anything gum money
a large wooden horse
im sorry
just answer the question
no
do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries
in large luxurious homes
to which let me finish
to which you may or may not
have been invited
no no no no
all right on a scale of one to 10
what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated
assassinated
one being very unlikely 10 being
expecting it around every corner
i have no idea
okay let me rephrase
are you the king of anything
like what
anything
king of the lanes
at the local bowling alley
king of the lanes
king of the lanes king of the trolls
king of the trolls
yes a clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards
anything
no
no thats ridiculous
agreed but lets start with ridiculous
and move backwards
now was any part of you at one time
part of something else
like do i have someone elses arms
well is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone
wood lye varied corpse parts
or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders
no look im sorry what do these
questions have to do with anything
the only way to find out
what story youre in
is to determine what stories
youre not in
odd as it may seem ive just ruled out
half of greek literature
seven fairy tales
10 chinese fables
and determined conclusively
that you are not king hamlet
scout finch miss marple
frankensteins monster
or a golem
arent you relieved to know
youre not a golem
yes i am relieved to know
that i am not a golem
good
do you have magical powers
may i ask what were doing out here
were imagining car wrecks
i see
and we cant imagine
car wrecks inside
no
did you know
that 41 percent of accidents
occur in times
of inclement weather
so do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases
really pneumonia
thats an interesting way to die
but how would harold
catch pneumonia
have you written
anything new today
no
did you read the poems i suggested
or make a list of words
buy new typing paper anything
no none of it
sitting in the rain wont write books
well that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books
whats this
its literature on the nicotine patch
i dont need a nicotine patch penny
i smoke cigarettes
well it may help
may help help what
help what penny
help write a novel
may help save your life
im not in the business of saving lives
in fact just the opposite
whats your favorite word
integer
good good good
do you aspire to anything
no
conquer russia
win a whistling contest
no
harold you must
have some ambition
i dont think so
some underlying dream think
well
ive always wanted my life
to be more musical
like west side story
no
like
what
well ive always wanted to learn
to play the guitar
okay
the last thing
to determine conclusively
is whether youre in a comedy
or a tragedy
to quote italo calvino
the ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces
the continuity of life
the inevitability of death
tragedy you die
comedy you get hitched
most comic heroes
fall in love with people
introduced after the story
has begun
usually people
who hate the hero initially
although i cant imagine anyone
hating you harold
professor hilbert im an irs agent
everyone hates me
right right good
have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you
i just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent
well that sounds like a comedy
try to develop that
four of these
you know i didnt get my honey
honey
lulu can you refill the honey
for larry quarters also
thats my good boy
im adding some acorns
mr crick
youre here early
must have a lot of people to extort
no no just you
twig tea and banana bread
yes maam
actually it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe
well i wont be paying no matter
the percentage mr crick
no i know but the percent
determines how big your cell is
you know you can call me harold
yeah i know but i dont want to
this is for ramona honey
oh thank you
youre very welcome
what is that
what are you marking
oh this is nothing
why dont we start
with your backup documents
and the receipts
for the past three years
sure
whats this
my files
what
my tax files
you keep your files like this
no actually im quite fastidious
i put them in this box
just to screw with you
hi
hi how are you
so how was it aruba
ms pascal can i just ask you
a question about this receipt
it was fantastic
just wondering if this nine is a seven
and what did you do
i got a beautiful tan
im just gonna guess its a seven
i mean i feel stressfree
do you need help with that
walk to heaven i see the president
its the taxman hello mr taxman
yeah
you can call me harold
okay
how the numbers going
pretty good
gonna find that 22 percent
22 percent
twentytwo 11 times 2
its prime numbers
you gonna tax the bathroom
no im not gonna tax the bathroom
could i use the bathroom then
go for it
okay i wanna use the bathroom
bye now
byebye
well good night
you want a cookie
oh no
come on theyre warm and gooey
theyre fresh out of the oven
no i dont like cookies
you dont like cookies
whats wrong with you
i dont know
everybody likes cookies
no i know
i mean after a really awful
nogood day
didnt your mama ever make you
milk and cookies
no my mother didnt bake
the only cookies i ever had
were storebought
okay sit down
no im
no
sit down
now
eat a cookie
i really cant
mr crick it was a really awful day
i know i made sure of it
so pick up the cookie
dip it in the milk
and eat it
thats a really really good cookie
so when did you decide
to become a baker
in college
oh like a cooking college
i went to harvard law actually
oh im sorry i just assumed it was
no no its fine i didnt finish
did something happen
no
i was barely accepted
i mean really barely
the only reason they let me come
was because of my essay
how i was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree
anyway we would have to participate
in these study sessions
my classmates and i
sometimes all night long
and so id bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked
sometimes i would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm
and then id bring my little treats
to the study groups
and people loved them
eat
i made oatmeal cookies
peanutbutter bars
darkchocolate
macadamianut wedges
and everyone would eat
and stay happy
and study harder
and do better on the tests
more and more people started
coming to the study groups
and id bring more snacks
i was always looking
for better and better recipes
until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants
and mocha bars
with an almond glaze
and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing
and at the end of the semester
i had 27 study partners
eight mead journals
filled with recipes
and a d average
so i dropped out
i figured if i was gonna
make the world a better place
i would do it with cookies
you like them
i do
im glad
thank you for forcing me
to eat them
youre welcome
i should go oh thank you
for the cookies i mean
why dont you take them home
oh no
oh come on
no really please
no really please
no no no really please
i would like to but i cant
you cant
no no i mean
because see it constitutes a gift
actually i shouldnt have even had
those other ones so
okay well im not
gonna tell anyone
no i know but if you did
well im not going to
i know but if you did
what you think im gonna call the
no no ill purchase them
im happy to purchase them
hows that
and then there are no issues
what
no
please
just
why dont i just
go home
really its not a big deal
go home
okay
did you
you baked those cookies for me
didnt you
you were just trying to be nice
and i totally blew it
this may sound like gibberish
to you
but i think im in a tragedy
professor hilbert ive totally failed
at the comedytragedy thing
in fact i think she likes me even less
i know its great
what do you mean
youve proved something else
entirely
the voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take
you reset your watch
it says you reset your watch
you ride a bus
it says you ride the bus
you brush your teeth
it says you brush your teeth
it may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story
so i suggest we try something else
like what
try nothing nothing
what about ms pascal
forget her
forget her
other than numbers
shes all i think about
harold if you wanna stay alive
youll try something else
that something being nothing
nothing exactly
nothing
let me explain this again
some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises
others are moved forward
by the characters themselves
if i go through that door
the plot continues
the story of me through the door
if i stay here
the plot cant move forward
the story ends
also if i stay here im late
dont do anything tomorrow
nothing
stay home dont answer the phone
open the door brush your teeth
what about work
call them
tell them youre not coming
dont go to work
dont do anything that may
move the plot forward
instead lets see if the plot finds you
marshall youre not kicking
certain that these geese have never
known any home but this one
a small lake in eastern poland
pollution from a nearby factory
is slowly killing
the small fish and insects
on which these creatures feed
all attempts to move the birds to
similar bodies of water have failed
perhaps it is the familiarity alone
that keeps them here
or perhaps its an unwillingness
to lose the collective memory
of the oncebeautiful hills
that surround the lake
and it takes only seconds
for the fiddler crabs to realize
that the wader
they might once have feared
has now become their prey
the wounded bird knows its fate
its desperate attempts to escape
only underscore the hopelessness
of its plight
the primates sad soulful eyes
will be the first to be plucked out
then sold to cosmetic companies
around the world
for use in the testing of mascara
and artificial tears
next the monkeys fur will be stripped
away from their limp corpses
and sewn together
to form pillows and comforters
mr zebra thought he was gonna
take a nice drink
but you never know
whos gonna eat
when youre dining
at mother natures restaurant
thats gotta hurt what does
this bald eagle wanna serve
with some kidney beans
and a fine chianti
its an eel and again
looks like old mr crocodile
wanted some antelope
to clear that salty zebra
from his palate
heres a struggle betting gentlemen
have been known to put money on
when a mongoose encounters a cobra
its hard to know whos gonna win
but this time it looks like
its the cobra
whos putting the squeeze
on the mongoose
but dont cash in your chips
just yet gentlemen
because now its the mongoose
who holds the winning card
hey hey
hey hey hey what are you doing
holy crapping hell
what the hell is that
stop the crane stop it
stop the crane
hey
hey what are you doing
us what are you doing
i was watching tv
well were demolishing this place
are you nuts i live here
is that a tv
yes thats a tv its my tv
well whats your tv doing in there
i said i live here stupid
its where i keep my stuff
my names on the goddamn buzzer
harold crick
apartment 2b 1893 mccarthy
did you say 1893
yes
im not exactly sure it was plot
i was hoping youd say it was
just a really bad coincidence
meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence
getting a letter from the emperor
saying that hes visiting is plot
having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball
is something else entirely
harold you dont control your fate
i know
you do
okay come with me
hey tom can you leave that
till tomorrow
you were right
this narrator might very well kill you
so i humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life
go live my life i am living my life
id like to continue to live my life
i know of course i mean all of it
however long you have left
you know i mean howard
you could use it to have an adventure
you know invent something or just
finish reading crime and punishment
hell harold you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted
whats wrong with you
hey i dont wanna eat
nothing but pancakes i wanna live
who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living
chooses pancakes
harold if youd pause to think
i believe youd realize
that that answers
inextricably contingent
upon the type of life being led
and of course
the quality of the pancakes
you dont understand
what im saying
yes i do
but you have to understand that this
isnt a philosophy or a literary theory
or a story to me its my life
absolutely so just go make it the one
youve always wanted
i never expected
that they would have
do you want one two
i want one
one
i want two
all right so heres your room
or as i like to call it sleep pod two
thanks dave
no problem dude
itll be nice having you around
how long you planning on staying
im not sure
dave can i pose a somewhat abstract
purely hypothetical question
sure
if you knew you were gonna die
possibly soon
what would you do
wow i dont know
am i the richest man in the world
no youre you
do i have a superpower
no youre you
i know im me
but do i have a superpower
no why would you
have a superpower
i dont know
you said it was hypothetical
fine yes youre really good at math
thats not a power thats a skill
okay youre good at math
and youre invisible
and you know youre gonna die
okay okay
thats easy id go to space camp
space camp
yeah its in alabama its where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts
ive always wanted to go
since i was 9
youre invisible
and youd go to space camp
i didnt pick invisible
you picked invisible
arent you too old
to go to space camp
youre never too old
to go to space camp dude
space camp
one hundred and twentytwo
guitars
seven hundred and thirtytwo
strings
two hundred and fiftyseven
pickups
one hundred and eightynine
volume knobs
here harold stood face to face
with his oldest desire
and stand is almost all harold did
it wasnt just about finding
a guitar
it was about finding a guitar
that said something about harold
unfortunately this guitar said
when i get back to georgia
that woman gonna feel my pain
this one said something
along the lines of
why yes these pants are lycra
these said im very sensitive
very caring
and i have absolutely no idea
how to play the guitar
im compensating for something
guess what
and then harold saw it
a damaged and terribly mistreated
seafoamgreen fender
staring back at him
despite its obvious maladies
the guitar spoke
with conviction and swagger
in fact it looked harold directly
in the eye and very plainly stated
i rock
just breathe watch it
weve got a 21 yearold male
with a gunshot wound to the chest
there you go
shot in a gang fight
harolds not in a gang
man in tweed
theres nothing wrong with him
he just likes looking at sick people
oddly spoken with disdain
this isnt working
well i dont even know
why were here
i dont think were supposed
to be here
you said i needed visual stimuli
i meant a museum
i dont need a goddamn museum
i need the infirm
you are the infirm
youre right the problem is
these people arent dead
theyre just severely injured
excuse me
where are the dying people
most of these people
are sick or injured
which is great dont get me wrong
but theyre gonna get better
which doesnt really help me
is there any way to see the people
who arent going to get better
excuse me
id like to see if at all possible
the ones who arent gonna make it
you know the deadforsure ones
im sorry
are you suffering from anything
just writers block
with every awkward strum
harold crick became stronger
in who he was
what he wanted
and why he was alive
harold no longer ate alone
he no longer counted brushstrokes
harold ill see you
he no longer wore neckties
bye dave
and therefore no longer worried
about the time it took to put them on
he no longer counted his steps
to the bus stop
instead harold did that
which had terrified him before
that which had eluded him
monday through friday
for so many years
that which the unrelenting lyrics
of numerous punkrock songs
told him to do
harold crick lived his life
but despite resuscitating his life
reviving his hope and instilling
a few wicked calluses
harolds journey
was still incomplete
and harolds wristwatch wasnt about
to let him miss another opportunity
ms pascal
ms pascal
mr crick
hi
hi
hi
hi
im glad i caught you
oh yeah why
because i wanted
to bring these to you
really
yeah
so you cant accept gifts

that seems a little inconsistent
doesnt it mr crick
very inconsistent yes
ill tell you what
ill purchase them
no
no no no really
id like to purchase them
what are they
flours
what
i brought you flours
and you carried them
all the way here
ms pascal ive been odd
and i know that ive been odd
and i want you
what
theres so many reasons
theres so many influences in my life
that are telling me
at times quite literally
that i should come here
and bring you these
but im doing this
because i want you
you want me
in no uncertain terms
isnt there some very clear
and established
rule about fraternization
auditorauditee protocol
yeah
yeah but i dont care
why
because i want you
well
do you mind carrying those
a little bit further
okay
okay
did you make a key
no i just committed it to memory
the blue thats barley flour
whats that one
the orange
yeah
i forget

i guess i could
wasnt that the idea with the flours
and everything
honestly i only figured it out
up to i want you
listen mr crick
i think i like you
and before i do anything rash
id like to make sure
id like you to come up
id be honored
great
yeah he was nuts though
he got caught when he tried
to get the contract notarized
no no
was it good
thank you
youre welcome
can i help you
no no im gonna put them in the sink
go sit down on the couch
so do you play the guitar
what
do you play the guitar
terribly someone traded me that
for a wedding cake

no come on i promise im not gonna
laugh at you play it
no no no maybe some other time
all right
ms pascal
i
i know
i want you too
harolds life was filled with moments
both significant and mundane
but to harold those moments
remained entirely indistinguishable
except for this
as ana let out a soft sigh and
repositioned herself against him
harold knew
somewhere in his heart
that this was one
of the significant moments
he knew she was
falling in love with him
professor hilbert its a comedy
what
a comedy
the woman the one who hates me
ana pascal
last night
yeah
shes falling in love with me
she is
its like a miracle
the voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night
well thats wonderful harold
i mean it completely nullifies my list
but thats fantastic
what list
these are seven living authors
whose prior work
would seem to make them
candidates to write your story
based on the criteria you and i
previously determined
if your narrator is alive
shes on this list
but it appears the list
is of little use to you now
now that youre gonna live
happily ever after
oh goodie this woman karen eiffel
shes one of my favorite authors
hi
hi
beautiful tragedies just beautiful
anyway
let me quickly copy this list for you
just in case
sociopathic author
i just wanted to thank you

hear the voice of the narrator again
just for my own edification
i will
well its called death and taxes
wow you know im from texas
no not texas taxes
death and taxes
death and taxes
taxes
like the benjamin franklin quote
precisely so
this ladys a package

the looming certainty of death
mens fashion accessories
oh my god thats her

the books are all about
they die she kills them

the heroes
four black veils what is that

i went out to buy cigarettes
and i figured out
how to kill harold crick
buying cigarettes
as i was
when i came out of the store
it came to me
how
well penny
like anything worth writing
it came inexplicably
and without method
i see then what happens
its perfect actually i cant believe
i didnt think of it earlier
its simple ironic
possibly heartbreaking
is that it
yes
you wrote it on legal sheets
on the bus
well then

oh dude the phones are out

the signals down
damn it
you all right
dave i need a favor
sure what is it
can i have some change
within moments harold found himself
running across the plaza
heading for the nearest
pay phone
at last he spotted it
but as harold neared the phone
he saw it was occupied
by an octogenarian determined
to reach his daughter in denver
no matter how many quarters
it took
fortunately harold remembered
a bank of phones
in the sixth street subway tunnel
the babys name isnt mrs epstein
my daughters name is mrs epstein
the first phone
failed to give a dial tone
and the second
seemed to be splattered
with a fresh batch of mucus
harold dialed the third phone
fervently making sure to give each
number key a specific forceful push
dont answer that
didnt you say this phone never r
hello

youre telling me
didnt you think you were crazy
sort of
but then you were right
about everything like everything
and then you said
little did he know
little did he know

jesus
which meant it was well you know
someone other than me

professor hilbert said
professor hilbert
professor jules hilbert

why i had to find you

youre not gonna kill me right
have you written it
i can no
have you written it
an outline
okay but its just an outline right

i may already be dead

please
okay
okay
and heres your uniform
its a go banettas outside
shell assign you your locker
and you roll
im ready
professor hilbert
hi harold
hi
you look tired
no no just calm
harold im sorry
you have to die
what
its her masterpiece
its possibly the most important novel
in her already stunning career
and its absolutely no good
unless you die at the end
ive been over it again and again
and i know how hard this is
for you to hear
youre asking me
to knowingly face my death
yes
really
yes
i thought youd
i thought youd find something
im sorry harold
cant we just try and just see
if she can change it
no
no
harold
in the grand scheme
it wouldnt matter
yes it would
no
i could change
i could quit my job
i could go away with ana
i could be someone else
harold listen to me
i cant die right now
its just really bad timing
no one wants to die harold
but unfortunately we do
harold
harold listen to me
harold you will die someday
sometime
heart failure at the bank
choke on a mint
some long drawnout disease
you contracted on vacation
you will die you will absolutely die
even if you avoid this death
another will find you
and i guarantee that it wont be nearly
as poetic or meaningful
as what shes written
im sorry
but its the nature of all tragedies
harold
the hero dies
but the story lives on forever
theres an empty seat right there
no i wanna sit down over here
kay
kay
how many people
do you think ive killed
kay
how many
i dont know
eight
kay
ive killed eight people i counted
theyre fictional get up
harold crick isnt fictional
i dont
he isnt fictional penny
every book ive ever written ends
with someone dying every one
really nice people too
the book about helen
the schoolteacher
i killed her
the day before summer vacation
how cruel is that
and the civil engineer edward
the one i trapped
with a heart attack in rush hour
i killed him
i killed
penny i killed them all
miss eiffel miss eiffel
harold
hi
i just finished it
you just
yeah i read it all in one read
on the bus
its lovely
i like the part about the guitars
well thanks thanks goo
well listen im
no i read it and i loved it
and theres only one way it can end
i mean i dont have much background
in literary anything
but this seems simple enough
i love your book
and i think you should finish it
the night before his death
harold unsuspectingly went about
some usual business
he finished his outstanding audits
he made a few phone calls
he had been putting off
listen does your program
have an age limit
and he traveled to ms pascals
where she made him meat loaf
and chocolate pudding
and the two watched old movies
it was a nice enough evening
and in any other circumstance
it wouldve seemed commonplace
in fact the only thing
that made this night significant
was the morning it preceded
i have to tell you something
you do
i do
is it a secret
sort of
tell me
i adore you
i adore you too
that it
no
i have to tell you this
i just want you to listen carefully
okay
you can deduct the value
of all the food you give away
as a charitable contribution
harold
no no no in fact it amounts to more
than what youre currently withholding
and it doesnt break any tax laws
harold the point
is to break the tax laws
i wanna make the world
a better place too ana
i think that means
keeping you out of jail
okay
okay
yeah
okay
if you come over here
and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear
because i like it so much
much had changed for harold
over the past few weeks
his attitude towards work
his habitual counting
his love life
but of all the transmutations
harold crick had undergone
perhaps the most significant
was that today on his return to work
he was not late
for the 817 kronecker bus
what harold had not understood
about that wednesday
four weeks prior
was that the time he received from
his fellow commuter
was in fact three full minutes
later than the actual time
and therefore three full minutes
later
than the time to which his watch
and life had been previously set
not the worst of errors
but if harold had not set his watch
to the incorrect time
harold would have again
barely caught the 817 kronecker bus
and he would not be approaching
the bus stop
precisely at 814
this particular friday
excuse me
harold
an otherwise ignorable fact
until the unthinkable occurred
oh my god oh my god
i need for everyone
to just stay seated
come on son
what happened i didnt see him
it was not your fault
he was trying to help the boy
get your supervisor
i dont believe this
it was all my fault though
no it wasnt
is he okay
it looks likes hes breathing
i dont think hes breathing
oh my god
come in
excuse me
are you professor hilbert
yes
hi im karen eiffel
i believe we have
a mutual acquaintance
please sit down
no i just came by to
here
is that it
yes
have you read it
is that all right
yes
i think perhaps you may be
interested in the new ending
good afternoon
oh hi
its a pretty brave thing you did
stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave
kind of stupid but pretty brave
oh yeah
is that boy okay
hes just fine scratched up is all
oh good
am i okay
well youre not dead
on the other hand it looks like
you cracked your head
you broke three bones
in your leg and foot
you suffered four broken ribs
fractured your left arm
and severed an artery in your right
which shouldve killed you in minutes
but amazingly
a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery
keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive
which is pretty cool
yeah
so with some physical therapy
a few months of rest
you should be fine
well sort of we werent able
to remove the shard of watch
from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage
youll be okay
youll just have a piece of watch
embedded in your arm
the rest of your life
youre very lucky to be alive
mr crick
yeah
dr mercator mr crick has a visitor
sure
my god harold
hey
im okay its all right
harold
im fine
harold youre not fine
look at you youre severely injured
no im fine
what what happened
i stepped in front of a bus
what why
there was a boy
i had to push him out of the way
what
i had to keep this boy from getting hit
you stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy
i didnt have a choice
i had to
its its okay
its not great
no
its okay its not bad
its not the most amazing piece
of english literature in several years
but its okay
you know
i think im fine with okay
it doesnt make sense
with the rest of the book though
no not yet ill rewrite the rest
my assistant said
shed go back to the publisher
and request more time
why
dont know its awfully sweet though
no why did you change the book
lots of reasons
i realized i just couldnt do it
because hes real
because its a book about a man
who doesnt know hes about to die
and then dies
but if the man does know
hes going to die and dies anyway
dies willingly
knowing he could stop it then
i mean isnt that the type of man
you want to keep alive
as harold took a bite
of bavarian sugar cookie
he finally felt as if everything
was going to be okay
sometimes when we lose ourselves
in fear and despair
in routine and constancy
in hopelessness and tragedy
we can thank god
for bavarian sugar cookies
and fortunately
when there arent any cookies
we can still find reassurance
in a familiar hand on our skin
or a kind and loving gesture
or a subtle encouragement
or a loving embrace
or an offer of comfort
not to mention hospital gurneys
and nose plugs
and uneaten danish
and softspoken secrets
and fender stratocasters
and maybe the occasional piece
of fiction
and we must remember
that all these things
the nuances the anomalies
the subtleties
which we assume
only accessorize our days
are in fact here for a much larger
and nobler cause
they are here to save our lives
