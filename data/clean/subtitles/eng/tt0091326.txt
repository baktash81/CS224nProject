danielsan
yeah coming
god this looks like the town

i think we went school together
i would introduce you but i forget name
how come if this is a fishing village
i dont see anybody fishing
yukiesan tell me last night
after war sato father bring
in big commercial fishing boat
inside two year all fish gone
all small boat gone
almost everything gone except old cannery
and lots of memories ichiro
when i left he was same place
doing same thing playing same tune
thats a shrine right
shinto shrine
boy it mustve been tough times
with all the fish gone huh
very tough
most people leave village for city
look for work
my father some others
invent whole new economy
go into vegetable business
save what was left of village
so what
so everyone owns their own little farm
no sato own village rent
thats a bummer
youre right familiar face
after school
kumiko teach obon dance to kids
o bon dance obon dance
its for the festival
in honor of the dead right
very good danielsan
yeah i remember reading about it last night
what is that a pillbox
probably left over from world war ii
boy it mustve been terrible here
15000 americans killed in like 10 days
yeah and 150000 okinawan and japanese
why we all so stupid
you have seen father
then we finish tonight
i bring a nephew for witness
then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight i not be there
your teacher coward
you leave me no choice
wait a second
danielsan
your father he want you
and you too
out of respect for my teacher
i give you three days to mourn
when finish i come back
you prepare to join him
you know when my father died
i spent a lot of time
thinking i wasnt such a great son
like maybe i could have listened
a little more
or spent some more time with him together
i felt so guilty you know like
like he did everything for me
and i didnt do anything for him
and then one day i realized i did
the greatest thing for him before he died
i was there with him
and i held his hand
and i said goodbye
very good danielsan time for next lesson
all right
you know i dont get something
if sato hates you so much
why does he give you time to mourn
my father was his teacher
inside the heart
sato still know right from wrong
but he still wants to kill you
sometime what heart know head forget
yeah but the guys looking to go to war
i dont understand
never stop war by taking part in one
yeah i know
but what if he threw that punch over there
what would you have done
block
you think you couldve
even you could have
