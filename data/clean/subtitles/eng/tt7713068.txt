miss montoya
the sionis family name

half the museums and
schools in gotham
and that makes him
immune to the law captain
harley montoyas day is
going almost as badly as mine
remember the guy
who stole her promotion
thats him
he had four people killed
alone last night
if roman sionis is
such a mastermind
howd he get fired
from his own fucking company
the janus corporation is
his fathers company
thank you
and by the way
they cut him off
where does the das office
stand on all this
harley to make
matters worse
the assistant da
thats her ex
the evidence that sionis is
linked to these murders
theres a shipment
coming in
erickson drugs
a diamond
munroe a diamond
wow montoya
should we call the feds for backup
montoya listen
i had a source at the club
his driver
he said that roman couldnt
stop talking about this thing
and he said that
he overheard
something about
laserencoding
now i did some research
i think
its the bertinelli diamond
you remember the bertinelli
massacre right
harley
quick history lesson
fifteen years ago
one of the wealthiest
mafia families in gotham
was gunned down
it was a power grab
but the real target
was the bertinellis
supersecret
offshore bank accounts
the details of which
were said to be encoded
in the atomic structure
of a 30carat diamond
the rock was lost
and with it the only key
to the bertinelli fortune
which is exactly
why roman sionis
is trying to
get his hands on it
thats what makes him
so dangerous
hes already
building an army
if he gets the diamond
hell have all the money
and connections
to bribe every single
judge and cop
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city
you said you had
someone on the inside
cell phone vibrating
yes hes stammering
hes no longer
there but
so basically
you have nothing
you are trying to go after
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in gotham
and all youve got is
rumors and a hunch
vibrating continues
well you know
the das office is building
a case against him too
isnt that right
miss yee
listen if the da
is willing to throw himself
out in front of this
its fine with me
captain no
listen munroe find me
some tangible connection
to sionis all right
yes sir
wait wait wait captain
this is my case okay
ive been working on this
for six months

can actually use detective

work in an asylum
fall in love
with your patient
break said patient
out of said asylum
begin a life of crime
jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman
get arrested
by the batman
go back to jail
get out of jail with a bomb on your neck
save the world go back to
jail and break out of jail
