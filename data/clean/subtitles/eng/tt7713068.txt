you gotta start
at the beginning 
too far  fine 
  this is me  harleen quinzel 
   giggling 
when i was a kid 
my dad traded me
for a six pack of beer 
but however many times
he tried to ditch me   
daddy 
     i kept coming back 
  ah 
eventually 
he found me a new home 
   harleen grunts 
   harley  the good sisters
of st  bernadette s
taught me a lot 
 groaning 
but i was never
an establishment kinda gal 
all things considered 
i did good 
i even went to college 
got my phd 
had my heart broken
once or twice 
finding love 
it s not easy 
so i threw myself
into my work 
became a psychiatrist 
that s when i met him 
  mr  j  my joker 
   harleen sighs happily 
 harley  oh  i fell hard 
like out of a plane
without a parachute 
right in
your dumb fucking face
  kinda hard 
   groans 
i lost all sense
of who i was 
  i only had eyes for puddin  
   joker laughing 
 harley  we all know the saying 
 behind every successful man
there s a badass broad  
well  that was me 
i was the brains
behind some of
  mr  j s greatest stunts 
  ha ha 
not that
he let anyone know it 
   henchmen cheering 
  puddin  
i guess all good things
have to come to an end 
 sobs 
so   
 harley screams 
   we broke up 
 harley yelps 
   sobbing 
  i handled it real mature 
but mr  j was super
broke up about it 
   continues sobbing 
    i hate myself for loving you  playing 
i got an amazing new place
that was all mine 
  midnight  gettin  uptight
where are you   
it gave me the space
to really reflect
on the mistakes of my past 
  i know i m hangin 
but i m still wantin  you  
i had to find
a new identity 
a new me 
 sobbing 
it wasn t easy 
but after a while 
i even opened myself up
to the possibility
of new love 
 harley gasps 
hi 
hello  nice baby 
 harley laughing 
here s the thing
about new love   
i take payment in kind 
     you have to feed it 
   hyena growling 
    i think of you every night and day  
   harley sobbing 
  you took my heart
then you took my pride away  
soon enough 
i was back on my feet 
ready to move on 
to make new friends 
 announcer on pa 
she means fucking business 
  oh  here we go 
   harley  whip me 
 announcer  she has taken
a whip from the pivot 
catapulted to the high side

 montoya  freeze 
 harley  with the walls

you re only a few years
younger than me 
and you re still
behind that desk 
you wanna go there 
come on  empty your pockets 
all of it 
 montoya  cassandra cain 
back already 
thought by now you d figure
out how not to get caught 
what  no comeback 
 coughs 
you all right 
you smell like shit 
 montoya scoffs 
yo  simpson 
any clean clothes
in lost and found 
these are serious accusations 
miss montoya 
the sionis family name
is on
half the museums and
schools in gotham 
and that makes him
immune to the law  captain 
 harley  montoya s day is
going almost as badly as mine 
remember the guy
who stole her promotion 
that s him 
he had four people killed
alone last night 
if roman sionis is
such a mastermind 
how d he get fired
from his own fucking company 
the janus corporation is
his father s company 
thank you 
and by the way 
they cut him off 
where does the da s office
stand on all this 
 harley  to make
matters worse 
the assistant da 
that s her ex 
the evidence that sionis is
linked to these murders   
there s a shipment
coming in 
 erickson  drugs 
  a diamond 
   munroe  a diamond 
wow  montoya 
should we call the feds for backup 
 montoya  listen 
i had a source at the club 
his driver 
he said that roman couldn t
stop talking about this thing 
and he said that
he overheard
something about
laser encoding 
now  i did some research 
i think
it s the bertinelli diamond 
you remember the bertinelli
massacre  right 
 harley 
quick history lesson 
fifteen years ago 
one of the wealthiest
mafia families in gotham
was gunned down 
it was a power grab 
but the real target
was the bertinellis 
super secret
offshore bank accounts 
the details of which
were said to be encoded
in the atomic structure
of a 30 carat diamond 
the rock was lost 
and with it  the only key
to the bertinelli fortune 
which is exactly
why roman sionis
is trying to
get his hands on it 
that s what makes him
so dangerous 
he s already
building an army 
if he gets the diamond 
he ll have all the money
and connections
to bribe every single
judge and cop
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city 
you said you had
someone on the inside 
   cell phone vibrating 
  yes  he s     stammering 
he s no longer
there  but   
so basically 
you have nothing 
you are trying to go after
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in gotham 
and all you ve got is
rumors and a hunch 
   vibrating continues 
  well  you know 
the da s office is building
a case against him  too 
isn t that right 
miss yee 
listen  if the da
is willing to throw himself
out in front of this 
it s fine with me 
captain  no 
listen  munroe  find me
some tangible connection
to sionis  all right 
  yes  sir 
  wait  wait  wait  captain 
this is my case  okay 
i ve been working on this
for six months 
we need something that we
can actually use  detective 
and  miss montoya 
we do have a dress code 
  look  i m sorry about that  but i   
  no 
that is my job
you are fucking with 
what is wrong
with you  renee 
me 
he gave my case away 
oh  poor renee 
why don t you pour yourself a drink 
it s almost noon 
wow 
 cell phone vibrating 
jesus  who the fuck is this 
what 
 lance 
why the fuck haven t you
been picking up your phone 
we ve got a situation 
what    what situation 
you didn t hear this
from me 
but you gotta find her
before someone else does 
she s got the diamond  and trust
me  roman will kill her 
my diamond  who 
who s got it 
this kid 
she s a pickpocket 
her name s cassandra cain 
holy fuck 
 dinging 
can i help you 
 in british accent  why  yes 
yes  you can 
i m here to
report a terrible crime 
and what terrible crime
is that 
  danger  playing 
 in normal voice 
this one 
 groans 
  danger  danger  
  danger  danger  
  ring the alarm
ring the alarm  
hi  boys 
 groans 
  danger  danger  
meeting s over 
 people screaming

 screams 
run  piggy  run 
 giggling 
where can i find
cassandra cain 
 harley  hold up  hold up 
i m telling this all wrong 
let s rewind 
for you to understand
why me 
the cop 
and that dame on the toilet   
her name s cassandra cain 
   are all looking for
this cain character   
i gotta take you back
a few days 
to that night i got shitfaced
at the black mask club 
 singing 
  this is a man s world  
  this is a man s world  
 harley  this is dinah lance 
  but it would be nothing  
 harley  but she
prefers black canary 
  nothing  
 harley 
she s got a killer voice 
  without a woman or a girl  
 harley  but there
was some other shit
going down that night 
 sionis 
   short notice like this 
i m not talking
superficial partnerships 
i m talking you and me
having each other s backs 
the golden lions can t just
wander into
gotham national bank 
i can 
loans  liquidity  laundering 
look  if you bring your boys
into the fold 
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together 
i m building
something special 
i appreciate your offer 
mr  sionis 
but with all due respect 
the golden lions
are a family business 
fuck family 
all due respect  but fuck that 
family s a fucking illusion 
you know what my family gave me 
nothing 
i know what everyone says 
 here comes roman sionis 
he was handed life
on a silver spoon  
 gin and tonics at 5 00  
 i ll have the duck  
blah  blah  blah 
fake fucking fucks 
 sionis scoffs 
but look at me now 
i ve located
the bertinelli diamond 
i m about to own this city 
not just the east end 
i am thinking big  baby 
and i want you there with me 
we could make
our own family 
mr  sionis 
the golden lions

in gotham
for nearly 100 years 
we have no need
of your protection 
 harley  he s gonna
regret that 
 muffled screaming 
 chuckles 
will you sleep on it 
will you do that for me 
run it by that
beautiful wife of yours 
and i ll come see you at the
docks  day after tomorrow

 sighs
