of joe kennedy 
who 
good  because you got to rob
to get rich in the reagan era 
they running a strange program 
more poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen 
they try to act like it don t exist 
 meanwhile  the rich get richer  
 and the poor get nothing 
times like these  people want
to get high  real high and real fast 
and this is going to do it 
and make us rich 
i mean  what 
people going crazy over this

he s a dope dealer 
that s what they do

i m not guilty 
you re the one who s guilty 
lawmakers  the politicians

making drugs legal 
just like with alcohol
during prohibition 
you re the one who s guilty 
let s kick the ballistics here 
ain t no uzis made in harlem 
not one of us in here
owns a poppy field 
this thing is bigger than nino brown 
this is big business 
this is the american way 
i m sure that the court
was enlightened     
     by your geopolitical tirade 
unfortunately  society at large
is not on trial here 
you are  mr  brown 
were you or were you not     
     head of the narcotics consortium 
the murderously bloody     
     cmb 
i could not hear you

who are you talking about 
mr  brown  what  they

a lot of people with me 
 order in the court 
 can i speak with my lawyer 
your honor  may counsel
approach the bench 
 what s going on 
 i don t know

the court is not pleased
with this application 
you understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge     
     the court  under law  can impose
a sentence of three years to life     
     with parole eligibility
after 1 2 months  do you understand 
absolutely 
how d you let this happen 
we wanted some of the crack
