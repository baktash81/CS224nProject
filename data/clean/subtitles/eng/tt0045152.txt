any story of my career   
would have to include my
lifelong friend  cosmo brown 
we were kids together  grew
up together  worked together 
yes 
well  dora  i ve had one motto
which i ve always lived by 
 dignity  always dignity  
this was instilled in me by mum
and dad from the very beginning 
they sent me to the finest
schools  including dancing school 
that s where i first met cosmo 
and with him  i used to perform for
mum and dad s society friends 
they used to make
such a fuss over me 
if i was very good  i was allowed to
accompany mum and dad to the theater 
they brought me up on shaw   
molière  the finest
of the classics 
to this was added rigorous
musical training   
at the conservatory of fine arts 
we rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy 
and at all times   
the motto remained   
    dignity  
 always dignity  
in a few years  we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour 
we played the finest symphonic
halls in the country 
fit as a fiddle
and ready for love
i can jump over
the moon up above
fit as a fiddle
and ready for love
haven t a worry
haven t a care
feelin  like a feather
that s floatin  on air
fit as a fiddle
and ready for love
soon the church bells will be ringin 
and a march with ma and pa
how the church bells
will be ringin 
with a hey nonny nonny
and a hot cha cha
hi diddle diddle
my baby s okay
ask me a riddle
i m happy to say
fit as a fiddle
and ready for love
audiences everywhere adored us 
get out of here 
finally we decided to
come to sunny california 
we were stranded    we were
staying here  resting up   
when offers from the movie
studios started pouring in 
we sorted them out and decided
to favor monumental pictures 
lina  you hate him  resist him 
keep that mood music going 
now  phil  you come in 
keep on grinding 
now you see her  now here s the bit 
bert  where you get it on the jaw 
cut

crash into the glasses  try it again 
okay  bert  bert 
oh  that s swell  just swell 
take him away  fellas 
you ll be all right  we ve lost
more stuntmen on these pictures   
it ll take hours to get a new
one from central casting 
mr  dexter  i can do that 
  you  you re a musician 
  that s a moot point 
no kidding  what s your name 
don lockwood  but the
fellas call me  donald  
wise guy  huh  okay  i ll try you 
get this guy into bert s suit 
and remember  lockwood  you might
be trading that fiddle in for a harp 
camera 
phil  come in  now you
see him  that s it 
now  here s where you
get it right on the jaw 
cut 
that was wonderful 
got any more little
chores you want done 
plenty 
okay 
my roles in these
films were urbane   
sophisticated   
suave 
and of course  all through
those pictures   
lina was  as always 
an inspiration to me 
warm and helpful 
a real lady 
hello  miss lamont  i m don
lockwood  the stuntman

the publicity department   
thought it d be better if don made
all the speeches for the team 
why 
you re beautiful  audiences
think you got a voice to match 
we gotta keep our stars from
looking ridiculous at any cost 
  no one s got that much money 
  what s wrong with the way i talk

so much more experience

a speech  i could memorize it 
sure  why don t you recite
the gettysburg address 
what do you know about it 
you piano player  are you anybody 
donnie  how can you let him talk
to me like that  your fiancée 
my fia   
lina  you ve been reading
those fan magazines again 
look  you shouldn t believe
all that banana oil   
that dora bailey dishes out 
now  try to get this straight 
there is nothing between us 
there has never been
anything between us 
  just air 
  oh  donnie  you don t mean that 
we ll be late for r f  s party 
better go in separate cars to break
up the mobs  come on  honey 
ta ta  donnie  see you there 
 donnie

haven t you heard  she s
irresistible  she told me so 
i can t get her out of my hair 
this romance for publicity   
the price of fame 
you ve got the glory 
the little heartaches go with it

i got no fame  i got no mansions 
i got no money  but i ve got

i d like to get out of this suit if
you re going by camden and sunset 
yes  i am 
i d like to know whose
hospitality i m enjoying 
selden  kathy selden 
enchanted  miss selden 
i m sorry i frightened you 
i was getting a little too
much love from my fans 
oh  that s what you
were running away from 
they did that to you 
that s terrible 
yes  yes  it is  isn t it 
it is terrible 
well  we movie stars
get the glory   
i guess we have to take the little
heartaches that go with it 
people think we lead lives
of glamour and romance   
but we re really lonely 
terribly lonely 
i really can t tell you how sorry
i am about taking you for a criminal 
but it was understandable  under the
circumstances  i knew i d seen you 
which of my pictures have you seen 
i don t remember 
i saw one once 
  you saw one once 
  i think you were dueling 
and there was a girl  lina lamont 
i don t go to the movies much 
if you ve seen one 
you ve seen them all 
thank you 
no offense 
movies are entertaining
for the masses   
but the personalities on the
screen don t impress me 
they don t talk or act 
they just make a lot of dumb show 
well  you know 
like that 
you mean  like what i do 
well  yes 
here we are  sunset and camden 
wait  you mean i m not an actor 
  pantomime isn t acting 
  of course not 
acting means great parts 
wonderful lines  glorious words 
shakespeare  ibsen 
what s your lofty
mission in life   
that lets you sneer at
my humble profession 
i m an actress  on the stage 
oh  on the stage 
i d like to see you 
what re you in now 
i could brush up on my english
or bring an interpreter 
that s if they d let
in a movie actor 
i m not in a play now 
but i m going to new york   
you re going to new york  and someday
we ll all hear of you  won t we 
kathy selden as juliet 
as lady macbeth  as king lear 
you ll have to wear a beard 
laugh if you want  but the stage
is a dignified profession 
why are you so conceited 
you re nothing but a shadow on film 
you re not flesh and blood 
  stop 
  what can i do  i m only a shadow 
keep away from me  just because
you re a big movie star   
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet  don t touch me 
fear not  sweet lady 
i will not molest you 
i am but a humble jester  and you 
you are too far above me 
farewell  ethel barrymore

i featured her before 
in lots of nightclub shows 
i ve seen her there 
she d be good as zelda s sister 
  that s a good idea 
  excuse me 
there may be blondes and brunettes
that are hard to resist
you surpass them like a queen
you ve got those lips
that were meant to be kissed
and you re over sweet 16
beautiful girl
what a gorgeous creature
beautiful girl
let me call a preacher
what can i do
but give my heart to you 
a beautiful girl
is like a great work of art
she s stylish
she s chic
and she also is smart
for lounging in her boudoir
this simple plain pajama
her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur
to lend a dash of drama
anyone for tennis 
well  this will make them cringe
and you ll knock  em dead at dinner
if your gown just drips with fringe
you simply can t be too modest
at the beach or by the pool
and in summertime  it s organdy
that ll keep you fresh and cool
you d never guess
what loud applause
this cunning hat receives
and you d never dream the things
that you could hide
within these sleeves
a string of pearls
with a suit of tweed
it s started quite a riot
and if you must wear
fox to the opera
dame fashion says   dye it 
black is best when you re in court
the judge will be impressed
but white is right
when you re a bride
and you want to be well dressed
beautiful girl
for you i ve got a passion
beautiful girl
you re my queen of fashion
i m in a whirl
over
my beautiful girl
  that s stupendous 
  thanks 
kathy  come here

casting you as zelda s sister 
that s wonderful 
hey  kathy

  wait a minute

a cake  it was meant for mr  lockwood 
goodbye  i m sorry

with humble player 
not exactly  but for lunch  don t you
tear a pheasant with miss lamont 
look  kathy  all that stuff about
lina and me is sheer publicity

articles in the fan magazines 
ohh  you read the fan magazines 
i pick them up in the beauty
parlor or the dentist s office   
just like anybody 
honest 
i buy four or five a month 
you buy four or five    
to get back to the main point   
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures   
did you say all my pictures 
now that i think of it 
i ve seen eight or nine of them 
eight or nine 
it seems to me
i remember someone saying 
 if you ve seen one 
you ve seen them all  
i did say some awful things
that night  didn t i 
no  i deserved them 
of course  i must admit i was
pretty much upset by them 
so upset that i haven t been able to
think of anything but you ever since 
honest 
honest

kathy   
kathy  look  i   
kathy  seeing you

a beautiful sunset 
mist from the distant mountains 
colored lights in a garden 
milady is standing on her balcony 
in a rose trellised bower   
flooded with moonlight 
we add 500 000
kilowatts of stardust 
a soft summer breeze 
and   
you sure look lovely
in the moonlight 
now that you have the proper
setting  can you say it

life was a song
you came along
i ve laid awake the
whole night through
if i but dared
to think you cared
this is what
i d say to you
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you
nature patterned you
and when she was done
you were all the sweet things
rolled up in one
you re like
a plaintive melody
that never lets me free
but i m content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me
but i m content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me

you re flirting with danger 
they will surely find you out 
your head is much too valuable 
she never could remember
where the microphone was 
 tis cupid himself
that called me here   
and i   
smitten by his arrow 
must fly to your side   
despite the threats
of madame guillotine 
but the night is
full of our enemies 
what you hitting him

but you re such big stars 
we might get by 
i never wanna see lockwood

wasn t it awful 
this is the worst
picture ever made 
i liked it 
well  take a last look at it 
it ll be up for auction
in the morning 
you re out of your mind 
it s saturday  no bank will
foreclose until monday 
  it wasn t so bad 
  that s what i told him 
there s no use kidding myself 
once they release the duelling cavalier 
lockwood and lamont are through 
the picture s a museum piece 
i m a museum piece 
things went wrong with
the sound  get the technical   
no  it wasn t that 
this is sweet of both
of you  but i   
something happened to me tonight 
everything you said
about me is true 
i m no actor 
i never was  just a
lot of dumb show 
i know that now 
well  at least you re
taking it lying down 
no kidding  cosmo 
did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen 
yeah  how about lina 
heh  i ran her a close second 
maybe it was a photo finish 
i m through 
you re not through 
why  of course not 
with your looks  you could
drive an ice wagon 
  or shine shoes 
  block hats 
  sell pencils 
  dig ditches 
or go back into vaudeville 
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
i could jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
too bad i didn t do that in duelling
cavalier  they might have liked it 
  why don t you 
  what 
  make a musical 
  a musical 
sure  make a musical 
the new don lockwood  he yodels 
he jumps about to music 
the only trouble is that
after duelling cavalier   
nobody d come to see me jump off the
woolworth building into a damp rag 
turn the duelling cavalier
into a musical 
  duelling cavalier 
  sure 
they ve got six weeks
before it s released 
add songs and dances 
trim bad scenes  add new ones 
and you got it 
hey  i think it ll work 
  of course 
  it s a cinch 
it may be crazy  but we ll do it 
the duelling cavalier

  yeah 
well  all right  if it s only

boys  this is great 
the duelling cavalier can be saved 
now  let s see 
the duelling cavalier with music

the dancing cavalier 
that s it  the dancing cavalier 
  remind me to make you a scriptwriter 
  thanks  have a cigar

now  what about the story 
we need modern musical numbers 
we throw a modern section into it 
the hero s a hoofer on broadway 
he sings and he dances 
one night  backstage  he s
reading the tale of two cities 
a sandbag hits his head 
he dreams he s back during
the french revolution 
this way  we get in the
modern dancing numbers 
but in the dream  we can
still use the costumes 
sensational  cosmo  remind
me to give you a raise 
  oh  r f 
  yes 
give me a raise 
he holds her in his arms
would you 
would you 
he tells her of her charms
would you 
would you 
they met as you and i
and they were only friends
but before   
   the story ends
he ll kiss her with a sigh
would you 
would you 
and if the girl were i
would you 
and would you dare to say
let s do the same
as they
i would
would you 
and would you dare to say
let s do the same
as they
i would
would you 
perfect  that selden girl is great 
i m gonna give her a big buildup 
  swell 
  how much is there left to do 
  one scene and a number 
  what number 
it s a new one  it s
for the modern part 
it s called  broadway melody  
it s the story of a young
hoofer who comes to new york 
first  we set the
stage with a song 
it goes like this 
don t bring a frown to old broadway
you gotta clown on broadway
your troubles there
they re out of style
for broadway always wears a smile
a million lights
they flicker there
a million hearts beat quicker there
no skies of gray
on that great white way
that s the broadway
melody
gotta dance

when i hear that happy beat
feel like dancin  down the street
to that broadway rhythm
writhing  beating
rhythm

when i hear that happy beat
feel like dancin  down the street
when i hear that happy beat

that s the broadway
melody
that s the idea  what
do you think of it 
i can t visualize it  i ll
have to see it on film first 
  on film  it ll be better yet 
  don t forget 
have selden re record
all of lina s dialogue 
  it s all set up 
  and remember   
don t let lina know about it 
all set in there 
right 
nothing can keep us apart 
our love will last till
the stars turn cold 
all right  kathy  go ahead 
nothing can keep us apart 
our love will last till
the stars turn cold 
that s great  perfect  cut 
till the stars turn cold 
oh  kathy  i love you 
i can t wait till this
picture s finished 
no more secrecy  i m gonna
let lina and everyone know 
your fans will be
bitterly disappointed 
from now on  there s only
one fan i m worried about 
there 
  what did i tell you 
  thanks  zelda  you re a real pal 
i want that girl off the lot at once 
she ain t gonna be my voice 
zelda told me everything 
  thanks  zelda  you re a real pal 
  anytime  don 
look  don and i   
don  don t you dare call him don 
i was calling him don
before you were born 
i mean    you were kissing him 
i was kissing her  i happen
to be in love with her 
that s ridiculous  everybody
knows you re in love with me 
ha  ha  now look  lina 
try and understand this 
i m going to marry her 
silly boy  she ain t
the marrying kind 
she s a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you 
well  i ll put a stop to that 
i m gonna go up and see r f  right now 
a little late 
the picture s finished 
if she weren t in it 
you d be finished too 
as far as i can see  she s
the only one who s finished 
who ll hear of her 
everybody  why do you think
zelda s in such a sweat 
kathy nearly stole the
picture from her 
she s only doing you a favor
in the dancing cavalier 
and she s getting full
screen credit for it too 
it ll say on the screen that i
don t talk and sing for myself 
of course  what do you think 
  they can t do that 
  it s already done 
there s a whole publicity
campaign planned 
publicity 
they can t make a fool out of me 
they can t make a laughingstock
out of lina lamont 
what do they think i am 
dumb or something 
why  i make more money   
than calvin coolidge   
put together 
 monumental pictures enthusiastic
over lina s singing and dancing  
i never said that 
 premiere tomorrow night to reveal
lina lamont  big musical talent  
you can t pull a switch like this
on the publicity department 
we were prepared for
the selden campaign 
now you do this  at
least keep us informed 
wait a minute  i don t
know anything about this 
what are we gonna do 
nothing 
absolutely nothing 
you wouldn t wanna call the
papers and say lina lamont   
is a big fat liar 
did you send this stuff out 
i gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town 
you ll never get away
with it  call the papers 
i wouldn t do that if i were you 
don t tell me what to do  lina 
what do you think i am 
dumb or something 
i had my lawyer go
over my contract 
contract 
and i control my
publicity  not you 
  yeah 
  yeah 
the studio is responsible for
every word printed about me 
if i don t like it  i can sue 
what 
i can sue 
if you tell the papers
about kathy selden   
it would be  detrimental and
deleterious  to my career 
i could sue you for
the whole studio 
  that s a lot of nonsense 
  says so 
right here 
contract dated june 8  1925 
paragraph 34  subdivision letter a 
 the party of the first part    
  that s me 
  you win  lina 
we better take kathy s
credit card off the screen 
all right  go ahead

premiere over with 
satisfied 
there s just one little thing more 
you want me to change the name of
the studio to lamont pictures  inc  
r f   you re cute 
now  i was just thinking 
you ve given her a part
in zelda s picture   
and you ll give her a
bigger one in the next 
so  what 
if she s done such a grand
job doubling for my voice   
don t you think she ought
to go on doing just that 
  and nothing else 
  you re out of your mind 
i m still more important
to the studio than she is 
i wouldn t do that to
her in a million years 
you d take her career away 
people don t do things like that 
people 
i ain t people 
i am a   
 a shimmering  glowing star
in the cinema firmament

with a happy refrain
and singin 
just singin  in the rain
i m singin  in the rain
just singin  in the rain
what a glorious feelin 
i m happy again
i m laughin  at clouds
so dark up above
the sun s in my heart
and i m ready for love
let the stormy clouds chase
stop that girl 
that girl running up the aisle 
stop her 
that s the girl whose voice
you heard and loved 
she s the real star of the
picture  kathy selden 
kathy 
you are
my lucky star
i saw you
from afar
two lovely eyes
at me they were gleaming
beaming
i was starstruck
you re all
my lucky charms
i m lucky
in your arms
