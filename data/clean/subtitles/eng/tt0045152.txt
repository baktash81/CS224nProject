lifelong friend cosmo brown

which ive always lived by
dignity always dignity
this was instilled in me by mum
and dad from the very beginning
they sent me to the finest
schools including dancing school
thats where i first met cosmo
and with him i used to perform for
mum and dads society friends
they used to make
such a fuss over me
if i was very good i was allowed to
accompany mum and dad to the theater
they brought me up on shaw
molière the finest
of the classics
to this was added rigorous
musical training
at the conservatory of fine arts
we rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy
and at all times
the motto remained
dignity
always dignity
in a few years we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour
we played the finest symphonic
halls in the country
fit as a fiddle

they just make a lot of dumb show

youre going to new york and someday
well all hear of you wont we
kathy selden as juliet
as lady macbeth as king lear
youll have to wear a beard
laugh if you want but the stage
is a dignified profession
why are you so conceited
youre nothing but a shadow on film
youre not flesh and blood
stop
what can i do im only a shadow
keep away from me just because
youre a big movie star
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet dont touch me
fear not sweet lady
i will not molest you
i am but a humble jester and you
you are too far above me

beautiful girl
what a gorgeous creature
beautiful girl
let me call a preacher
what can i do
but give my heart to you
a beautiful girl
is like a great work of art
shes stylish
shes chic
and she also is smart
for lounging in her boudoir
this simple plain pajama
her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur
to lend a dash of drama
anyone for tennis
well this will make them cringe
and youll knock em dead at dinner
if your gown just drips with fringe
you simply cant be too modest
at the beach or by the pool
and in summertime its organdy
thatll keep you fresh and cool
youd never guess
what loud applause
this cunning hat receives
and youd never dream the things
that you could hide
within these sleeves
a string of pearls
with a suit of tweed
its started quite a riot
and if you must wear
fox to the opera
dame fashion says dye it
black is best when youre in court
the judge will be impressed
but white is right
when youre a bride
and you want to be welldressed
beautiful girl
for you ive got a passion
beautiful girl
youre my queen of fashion
im in a whirl
over
my beautiful girl

parlor or the dentists office
just like anybody

i remember someone saying
if youve seen one

mist from the distant mountains
colored lights in a garden
milady is standing on her balcony
in a rosetrellised bower
flooded with moonlight

kilowatts of stardust
a soft summer breeze
and

in the moonlight

setting can you say it

ive laid awake the
whole night through
if i but dared
to think you cared
this is what
id say to you
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you
nature patterned you
and when she was done
you were all the sweet things
rolled up in one
youre like
a plaintive melody
that never lets me free
but im content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me
but im content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me

i am the noblest lady of the court
second only to the queen
yet i am the saddest
of mortals in france
what is the matter milady
im so downhearted theresa
my father has me betrothed
to the baron de landsfield
and i cant stand him
oh but hes such a catch
all the ladies of the court
wish they were in your shoes
my heart belongs to another
pierre de bataille
ever since i met him i cant
get him out of my mind
sounds good and loud huh
oh pierre
you shouldnt have come
youre flirting with danger
they will surely find you out
your head is much too valuable
she never could remember
where the microphone was
tis cupid himself
that called me here
and i
smitten by his arrow
must fly to your side
despite the threats
of madame guillotine
but the night is
full of our enemies
what you hitting him
with a blackjack
imperious princess of the night
i love you
oh pierre
i love you
i love you i love you i love you
i love you i love you
i love you i love you
i love you i love you
did somebody get paid
for writing that
sounds like a comedy
its a lockwoodlamont talkie
what
this is terrible
whats that
the sound its out
of synchronization
tell them to fix it

captured by rouge noir
of the purple terror
ohh oh my sword

this is the worst
picture ever made
i liked it
well take a last look at it
itll be up for auction
in the morning
youre out of your mind

foreclose until monday
it wasnt so bad
thats what i told him
theres no use kidding myself
once they release the duelling cavalier
lockwood and lamont are through
the pictures a museum piece
im a museum piece
things went wrong with
the sound get the technical
no it wasnt that
this is sweet of both
of you but i
something happened to me tonight
everything you said
about me is true
im no actor
i never was just a
lot of dumb show
i know that now
well at least youre
taking it lying down
no kidding cosmo
did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen
yeah how about lina
heh i ran her a close second
maybe it was a photo finish
im through
youre not through
why of course not
with your looks you could
drive an ice wagon
or shine shoes
block hats
sell pencils
dig ditches
or go back into vaudeville
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
i could jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
too bad i didnt do that in duelling
cavalier they might have liked it
why dont you
what
make a musical
a musical
sure make a musical
the new don lockwood he yodels
he jumps about to music
the only trouble is that
after duelling cavalier
nobodyd come to see me jump off the
woolworth building into a damp rag
turn the duelling cavalier
into a musical
duelling cavalier
sure
theyve got six weeks
before its released
add songs and dances
trim bad scenes add new ones
and you got it

the dancing cavalier
thats it the dancing cavalier
remind me to make you a scriptwriter
thanks have a cigar
thanks
now what about the story
we need modern musical numbers
we throw a modern section into it
the heros a hoofer on broadway
he sings and he dances
one night backstage hes
reading the tale of two cities
a sandbag hits his head
he dreams hes back during
the french revolution
this way we get in the
modern dancing numbers
but in the dream we can
still use the costumes
sensational cosmo remind
me to give you a raise
oh rf
yes
give me a raise
he holds her in his arms
would you
would you
he tells her of her charms
would you
would you
they met as you and i
and they were only friends
but before
the story ends
hell kiss her with a sigh
would you
would you
and if the girl were i
would you
and would you dare to say
lets do the same
as they
i would
would you
and would you dare to say
lets do the same
as they
i would
would you
perfect that selden girl is great
im gonna give her a big buildup
swell
how much is there left to do
one scene and a number
what number
its a new one its
for the modern part
its called broadway melody
its the story of a young
hoofer who comes to new york
first we set the
stage with a song
it goes like this
dont bring a frown to old broadway
you gotta clown on broadway
your troubles there
theyre out of style
for broadway always wears a smile
a million lights
they flicker there
a million hearts beat quicker there
no skies of gray
on that great white way
thats the broadway
melody

your fans will be
bitterly disappointed
from now on theres only
one fan im worried about
there
what did i tell you

i want that girl off the lot at once
she aint gonna be my voice
zelda told me everything
thanks zelda youre a real pal
anytime don
look don and i
don dont you dare call him don
i was calling him don
before you were born
i mean you were kissing him
i was kissing her i happen
to be in love with her
thats ridiculous everybody
knows youre in love with me
ha ha now look lina
try and understand this
im going to marry her
silly boy she aint
the marrying kind
shes a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you
well ill put a stop to that
im gonna go up and see rf right now
a little late
the pictures finished
if she werent in it
youd be finished too
as far as i can see shes
the only one whos finished
wholl hear of her
everybody why do you think
zeldas in such a sweat
kathy nearly stole the
picture from her
shes only doing you a favor
in the dancing cavalier
and shes getting full
screen credit for it too
itll say on the screen that i
dont talk and sing for myself
of course what do you think
they cant do that
its already done
theres a whole publicity
campaign planned
publicity
they cant make a fool out of me
they cant make a laughingstock
out of lina lamont
what do they think i am
dumb or something
why i make more money
than calvin coolidge
put together
monumental pictures enthusiastic
over linas singing and dancing
i never said that
premiere tomorrow night to reveal
lina lamont big musical talent
you cant pull a switch like this
on the publicity department
we were prepared for
the selden campaign
now you do this at
least keep us informed
wait a minute i dont
know anything about this
what are we gonna do
nothing
absolutely nothing
you wouldnt wanna call the
papers and say lina lamont
is a big fat liar
did you send this stuff out
i gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town
youll never get away
with it call the papers
i wouldnt do that if i were you
dont tell me what to do lina
what do you think i am
dumb or something
i had my lawyer go
over my contract
contract
and i control my
publicity not you
yeah
yeah
the studio is responsible for
every word printed about me
if i dont like it i can sue
what
i can sue
if you tell the papers
about kathy selden
it would be detrimental and
deleterious to my career
i could sue you for
the whole studio
thats a lot of nonsense
says so
right here
contract dated june 8 1925
paragraph 34 subdivision letter a
the party of the first part
thats me
you win lina
we better take kathys
credit card off the screen
all right go ahead
lets just get this
premiere over with
satisfied
theres just one little thing more
you want me to change the name of
the studio to lamont pictures inc
rf youre cute
now i was just thinking
youve given her a part
in zeldas picture
and youll give her a
bigger one in the next
so what
if shes done such a grand
job doubling for my voice
dont you think she ought
to go on doing just that
and nothing else
youre out of your mind
im still more important
to the studio than she is
i wouldnt do that to
her in a million years
youd take her career away
people dont do things like that
people
i aint people
i am a
a shimmering glowing star
in the cinema firmament

right there
