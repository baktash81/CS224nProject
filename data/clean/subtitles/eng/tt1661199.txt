not always as it was 
but as perhaps it could be 
with just a little bit of magic 
my darling 
to her mother and father 
she was a princess 
true  she had no title 
nor crown  nor castle 
but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom 
whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest s edge
where her people
had lived for generations 
with mr  goose
and all their animal family 
hello  there 
what do you think you re doing 
let the little ones have their share 
we don t want you getting
an upset stomach 
gus gus  you re a house mouse 
not a garden mouse 
isn t he  jacqueline 
and you mustn t eat mr  goose s food 
isn t that right  mummy 
do you still believe
that they understand you 
  don t they  mother 
  yes 
i believe that animals listen
and speak to us
if we only have the ear for it 
that s how we learn to look after them 
who looks after us 
fairy godmothers  of course 
and do you believe in them 
i believe in everything 
then i believe in everything  too 
her father was a merchant
who went abroad
and brought tribute back from
all of ella s subject lands 
ella 
where are my girls  my beautiful girls 
where are my darlings 
ella missed him terribly
when he was away 
but she knew he would always return 
  there she is 
  papa  welcome home 
how are you 
you ve grown 
haven t you  now 
  there you go  sir 
  what was that 
this 
i found it hanging on a tree 
i think there may be something inside 
it s so pretty 
in french  that is un papillon 
you re standing on my feet 
shall we 
look  mummy  i m dancing 
little papillon 
all was just as it should be 
they knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did
and to love each other so 
when i am king dilly  dilly
you shall be queen
lavender s green dilly  dilly
lavender s blue
you must love me dilly  dilly
for i love you
but sorrow can come to any kingdom 
no matter how happy 
and so it came to ella s home 
i m so sorry 
thank you  doctor 
this must have been
very difficult for you 
come 
ella 
ella  my darling 
i want to tell you a secret 
a great secret that will see you through
all the trials that life can offer 
you must always remember this 
have courage and be kind 
you have more kindness
in your little finger
than most people possess
in their whole body 
and it has power  more than you know 
  and magic 
  magic 
truly 
have courage and be kind  my darling 
will you promise me 
i promise 
good 
good 
and   
i must go very soon  my love 
please forgive me 
of course i forgive you 
i love you 
i love you  my darling 
i love you 
time passed  and pain turned to memory 
in her heart  ella stayed the same 
for she remembered
her promise to her mother 
have courage  and be kind 
father  however  was much changed 
but he hoped for better times 
 and thence home 
 and my wife and i singing 
to our great content 
 and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes 
 i know him not  
thus ends mr  pepys for today 
i do love a happy ending  don t you 
they re quite my favorite sort 
as well they should be 
ella 
i have come to the conclusion
that it s time  perhaps 
to begin a new chapter 
indeed  father 
you ll recall that some time ago 
in my travels 
i made the acquaintance
of sir francis tremaine 
yes 
the master of the mercer s guild 
is he not 
was 
the poor man has died  alas 
his widow 
an honorable woman 
finds herself alone 
though still in the prime of her life 
you re worried about telling me 
but you mustn t be 
not if it will lead to your happiness 
yes 
happiness 
do you think
i may be allowed one last chance 
even though i thought
such things were done with for good 
of course i do  father 
she ll merely be your stepmother 
and you ll have two lovely sisters
to keep you company 
have courage  be kind 
welcome  ladies  welcome 
she s skinny as a broomstick 
and that stringy hair 
you re very nice 
welcome  i m so happy to meet you 
you have such pretty hair 
  thank you 
  you should have it styled 
i m sure you re right 
  would you like a tour of the house 
  what did she say 
she wants to show us
around her farmhouse 
  she s proud of it  i think 
  do they keep animals inside 
how charming  how perfectly charming 
lucifer 
her stepmother to be
was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste 
and she  too  had known grief 
but she wore it wonderfully well 
you did not say
your daughter was so beautiful 
she takes after her   
her mother 
just so 
what does mummy mean 
what s so charming about it 
she s lying  that s just good manners 
shut up 
how long has your family lived here 
over 200 years 
and in all that time 
they never thought to decorate 
anastasia  hush 
they ll think you are in earnest 
ella s stepmother 
high spirited lady that she was 
set out to restore life
and laughter to the house 
you are awful  baron 
fortune favors me again 
well  look who s having
a party of their own 
jacqueline  teddy  matilda 
greedy gus gus 
just what   
yes  what do you think
you re up to  lucifer 
jacqueline is my guest 
and the eating of guests is not allowed 
go on  now 
you ve plenty of cat food
to keep you happy 
we ladies must help one another 
you re missing the party 
i imagine it s much
like all the other ones 
and i m leaving first thing  el 
no  but you re   
you re hardly back from the last trip 
do you have to go 
it s just a few months  my darling 
what would you like me
to bring you home from abroad 
you know  your sisters   
stepsisters  have asked for
parasols and lace 
what will you have 
bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey 
that s a curious request 
well  you ll have to take it with you
on your way
and think of me when you look at it 
and when you bring it back 
it means that you ll be with it 
and that s what i really want 
for you to come back 
no matter what 
i will 
ella  while i m away 
i want you to be good to your stepmother
and stepsisters  even though they may be
trying at times 
  i promise 
  thank you 
i always leave
a part of me behind  ella 
remember that 
and your mother s here  too 
though you see her not 
she s the very heart of this place 
and that s why
we must cherish this house 
always  for her 
i miss her 
do you 
very much 
remember the lace 
i simply must have it 
and my parasol 
for my complexion 
that means skin  if you don t know 
bye 
bye  ella 
i love you 
i love you  too 
bye 
ella  dear 
now  now  mustn t blub 
yes  stepmother 
you needn t call me that 
 madam  will do 
there isn t room for me
and all of your clothes 
well  then make yourself smaller 
anastasia and drisella
have always shared a room 
such dear  affectionate girls 
or    or better yet  disappear entirely 
you d like that  wouldn t you 
sometimes i could scratch your eyes out 
i think they re finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining 
well  my bedroom s the biggest
besides yours and father s 
perhaps they d like to share it 
what a wonderful idea 
what a good girl you are 
i can stay in the   
the attic 
quite so 
the attic 
yes 
only temporarily  while i have
all the other rooms redecorated 
the attic s so nice and airy
and you ll be away
from all of our fuss and bother 
you d be even more cozy
if you kept all this bric a brac
up there with you 
keep you amused 
well 
no one shall disturb me here 
hello  gus gus 
go on  gus gus  you can do it 
so this is where you take refuge 
me too  it would seem 
right 
who s going to help me 
simpleton 
that is the last straw 
our little sister  up there 
talking to the woodworm 
how very pleasant 
no cats 
and no stepsisters 
we have a halfwit for a sister 
i ve got two 
i heard that 
  who is she talking to 
  she s mad 
sing  sweet nightingale
  good morning 
  good morning  miss ella 
good morning  tom 
sing sweet   
hello  don t mind if i   
what a lovely chantecler  well done 
thanks 
   morning 
   morning 
thank you  miss ella 
you re welcome 
ella 
wake up  girls  it s lunch time 
mornings did not agree
with ella s stepsisters 
and they lacked accomplishment
in such domestic arts as keeping house 
in fact  they lacked
accomplishment in any art 
it was a lover and his lass
with a hey  and a ho
and a hey nonino
that o er the green corn field did pass
sweet lovers love
the spring
sweet lovers love
the spring
do shut up 
ella s great comfort
were the letters that father
would send from his travels 
the weeks away lengthened to months 
but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part 
miss ella  it s the mail coach 
until late one afternoon   
farmer john 
miss ella 
it s your father  miss 
he took ill on the road 
he s passed on  miss 
he s gone 
to the end  he spoke only of you  miss 
and your mother 
i was to give you this 
but what about my lace 
my parasol 
can t you see  none of that matters 
we re ruined 
how will we live 
thank you 
it must have been
very difficult for you 
how indeed to live 
economies had to be taken 
ella s stepmother
dismissed the household 
her stepmother and stepsisters
ever misused her 
and by and by they considered ella
less a sister than a servant 
and so ella was left to do all the work 
this was a good thing 
for it distracted her from her grief 
at least that was what
her stepmother said 
and she and her two daughters
were more than happy
to provide ella
with lots and lots of distraction 
in their defense 
they did share with her
the very food they ate 
or rather  the scraps from their table 
she had little in the way of friends 
well  her friends were very little 
there you are 
have dinner with me  won t you 
but those friends she had 
she treated with an open heart
and an open hand 
your table 
sometimes  by the end of the day 
the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in 
so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth
to keep warm 
i thought breakfast was ready 
it is  madam 
i m only mending the fire 
in future  can we not be called
until the work is done 
as you wish 
ella  what s that on your face 
madam 
it s ash from the fireplace 
do clean yourself up 
you ll get cinders in our tea 
i ve got a new name for her 
cinderwench 
i couldn t bear to look so dirty 
dirty ella 
cinder ella 
that s what we ll call you 
girls  you re too clever 
who s this for 
is there someone we ve forgotten 
it s my place 
it seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast 
serve it and still sit with us 
wouldn t you prefer to eat
when all the work is done  ella 
or should i say   cinderella  
cinderella 
names have power  like magic spells 
and of a sudden  it seemed to her
that her stepmother and stepsisters
had indeed transformed her
into merely a creature of ash
and toil 
run 
quickly  my friend 
or they ll catch you 
go 
easy 
perhaps it was just as well
that ella s stepsisters were cruel 
for had she not run to the forest 
she might never have met the prince 
easy  easy 
easy  boy 
come on  boy  slow down 
miss 
miss  are you all right 
hold on 
i m all right  thank you 
that s fine 
  are you all right 
  i m all right 
but you ve nearly frightened
the life out of him 
who 
the stag 
what s he ever done to you
that you should chase him about 
i must confess
i ve never met him before 
he is a friend of yours 
an acquaintance 
we met just now 
i looked into his eyes 
and he looked into mine 
and i just felt he had a great deal
left to do with his life 
that s all 
miss  what do they call you 
never mind what they call me 
you shouldn t be this deep
in the forest alone 
i m not alone  i m with you  mister   
what do they call you 
you don t know who i am 
that is   
they call me kit 
well  my father does
when he s in a good mood 
and
where do you live  mr  kit 
at the palace 
my father s teaching me his trade 
you re an apprentice 
of a sort 
that s very fine 
do they treat you well 
better than i deserve  most likely 
and you 
they treat me as well as they re able 
i m sorry 
it s not your doing 
nor yours either  i ll bet 
it s not so very bad 
others have it worse  i m sure 
we must
simply have courage
and be kind  mustn t we 
yes 
you re right 
that s exactly how i feel 
please don t let them hurt him 
but we re hunting  you see 
it s what s done 
just because it s what s done
doesn t mean it s what should be done 
right again 
then 
you ll leave him alone  won t you 
i will 
thank you very much  mr  kit 
there you are  your high   
it s kit  kit 
kit  i m kit  i m on my way 
well  we d better get a move on 
mr  kit 
as i said 
on my way 
i hope to see you again  miss 
and i  you 
you sound as if you re the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl 
she wasn t a  pretty girl  
well  she was a pretty girl 
but there was so much more to her 
how much more  you ve only met her once 
how could you know anything about her 
you told me you knew right away
when you met mother 
that s different 
your mother was a princess 
you would have loved her anyway 
i would never have seen her  because
it wouldn t have been appropriate 
and my father would have told me what
i m telling you and i would have listened 
  no  you wouldn t 
  yes  i would 
  no  you wouldn t 
  i would 
  you wouldn t 
  you re right 
well  how is he 
your majesty   
never mind 
if it takes that long to work out a way
to say it  i already know 
father   
way of all flesh  boy 
come 
we shall be late 
and punctuality is the   
politeness of princes 
his majesty  the king 
i m sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest 
is it any business of yours  grand duke 
your business is my business 
your royal highness 
it will not do to let the stag go free 
just because it s what s done
doesn t mean it s what should be done 
or something like that 
master phineus 
master of the paintbrush 
patiently awaits 
make him look marriageable 
master phineus 
we must attract a suitable bride 
even if he won t listen to a word i say 
i shall endeavor to please 
your majesty 
but i can t work miracles 
a splendid canvas  master phineus 
thank you 
as if he knows anything about art 
so  these portraits
will really be sent abroad 
to induce the high and mighty
to attend this ball you insist upon 
which is a tradition  which is beloved 
at which you will choose a bride 
fascinating 
if i must marry  could i not wed  say 
a good  honest country girl 
how many divisions will this
 good  honest country girl  provide us 
how will she make the kingdom stronger 
we are a small kingdom amongst
great states  your royal highness 
and it s a dangerous world 
listen  boy 
  taking you up  master phineus 
  good 
i want to see you and the kingdom safe 
all right  father 
on one condition 
let the invitations go to everyone 
not just the nobility 
the wars have brought sorrow on us all 
what do you think 
would that please the people 
it s beyond my wit  your majesty 
but i wouldn t mind a bit of a jolly 
i think we might have made a bargain 
a ball for the people 
and a princess for the prince 
sounds like a step in the right direction 
if you ask   
we didn t ask you 
i m so sorry 
naughty paint  naughty brush 
down  please  samson 
haven t even got a cushion 
right  down  down  not that   
oi  i m on the ground 
i am literally on the ground  sorry 
actually this is
a very good angle for you 
great nostrils 
could i have a longer brush 
you don t look well  miss 
not at all 
why do you stay there 
when they treat you so 
because i made my mother
and father a promise
to cherish the place we were so happy 
they loved our house
and now that they re gone 
i love it for them 
it s my home 
hear ye  hear ye 
quiet 
 know 
 on this day  two weeks hence 
 there shall be held  at the palace 
 a royal ball 
 at said ball 
 in accordance with ancient custom 
 the prince shall choose a bride 
 furthermore 
 at the behest of the prince 
 it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom 
 be she noble or commoner 
 is invited to attend 
 such is the command
of our most noble king  
excuse me  madam 
ella was enormously excited
to see kit  the apprentice 
and her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued
by the notion of meeting the prince 
i shall trick him into loving me 
see if i don t 
this is the most hugest news 
calm yourselves 
now listen to me 
one of you must win
the heart of the prince 
do that  and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared
when we came to this backwater 
i  a princess 
or rather  i 
a princess 
having delivered your news 
why are you still here 
you must return to town right away
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns 
three 
that s very thoughtful of you 
what do you mean 
to think of me 
think of you 
mummy  she believes
the other dress is for her 
poor  slow  little cinders 
how embarrassing 
you re too ambitious for your own good 
no  i only want to see my friend 
let me be very clear 
one gown for anastasia 
one for drisella 
and one for me 
she doesn t know what that means 
good  right  that s settled then 
now go 
every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince 
you must get there first before
the seamstress is drowning in work 
tell me what she said  drisella 
i speak french  not italian 
wake up  your royal highness 
you re in a daze 
i m sorry 
you ve been off since the hunt 
it s that wonderful girl 
i can t stop thinking about her 
but there are plenty of girls 
but her spirit  her goodness   
you don t suppose
she has a sister  do you 
i don t know 
i don t know anything about her 
perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball 
that is why you threw
the doors open  is it not 
captain  it was for the benefit
of the people 
of course  how shallow of me 
and if she comes  then what 
then you will tell her you re a prince 
and a prince may take
whichever bride he wishes 
  ha 
  ha 
yes   ha  
you know my father and the grand duke
will only have me marry a princess 
well  if this girl from the forest
is as charming as you say 
they may change their minds 
the day of the ball arrived
and the entire kingdom
held its breath in anticipation 
you want me to be your queen 
who  me 
tighter 
tighter 
tighter 
that s it 
a vision  sister 
likewise 
we must compete for the prince s hand 
but let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other 
of course not  dear sister 
i wouldn t dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball 
nor i of pushing you from
a moving carriage on the way there 
or i of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive 
we are sisters  after all 
and blood is so much thicker than water 
we shall let the prince decide 
what will he be like  i wonder 
what does it matter what he s like 
he s rich beyond reason 
wouldn t you like to know
a bit about him before you marry him 
certainly not  it might change my mind 
i bet you have never
ever spoken to a man 
have you  moon face 
i have  once 
to a gentleman 
some menial  no doubt 
some  prentice 
he was an apprentice  yes 
all men are fools 
that s what mama says 
the sooner you learn that  the better 
the first dance  milady 
prince charming  you re so naughty 
  i want to try it 
  no  i m wearing it 
no  no 
not for the first time 
ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers 
who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without 
my prince 
he will love me 
but i will be his queen 
if her stepmother
would not have a fourth dress made 
it seemed to ella
that there was no reason why
she would not try to run it up herself 
and besides  she did have a little help 
my dear girls 
to see you like this 
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince 
and to think
i have two horses in the race 
i daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters 
cinderella 
it cost you nothing 
it was my mother s old dress  you see 
and i took it up myself 
cinderella at the ball 
no one wants a servant for a bride 
after all i ve done   
i don t want to ruin anything 
i don t even want to meet the prince 
and you won t  because
there s no question of your going 
but  all of the maidens
of the land are invited 
by order of the king 
it is the king i am thinking of 
it would be an insult
to the royal personage
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags 
rags 
this was my mother s 
i m sorry to have to tell you
but your mother s taste
was questionable 
this thing is so old fashioned
it s practically falling to pieces 
the shoulder s frayed 
  it s falling to bits 
  and this 
it s a ridiculous  old fashioned joke 
how could you 
how could i otherwise 
i will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you 
it would ruin their prospects
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl 
because that is what you are 
and that is what you will always be 
now mark my words 
you shall not go to the ball 
go on  get going 
i m sorry  mother 
i m sorry 
i said i d have courage  but i don t 
not anymore 
i don t believe anymore 
excuse me 
can you help me  miss 
just a little crust of bread 
or better  a cup of milk 
yes 
yes  yes  yes 
i think i can find something for you 
why are you crying 
it s nothing 
nothing 
nothing 
what is a bowl of milk  nothing 
but kindness makes it everything 
now  i don t mean to hurry you 
but you really haven t got long  ella 
how do you know me 
who are you 
who am i 
i should think
you d have worked that one out 
i m your hairy dogfather 
i mean  fairy godmother 
you can t be 
why not 
they don t exist 
they re just made up for children 
didn t your own mother believe in them 
don t say no  because i heard her 
you heard her 
fiddle faddle  fiddle faddle 
right  first things first 
let me slip into something
more comfortable 
that s better

actually  i ve forgotten
what the trick is 
i just thought  if it

do you think that s what i meant to do 
run  run  darling

with the last echo of the last bell 
at the last stroke of midnight 
the spell will be broken
and all will return
to what it was before 
midnight 
midnight 
that s more than enough time 
  off you go then 
  thank you 
thank you 
goosey  go

do come on 
the lord veneering 
who are you looking for 
no one 
it s that girl in the forest  isn t it 
that s why you were so generous
with the invitations 
father  it was for the people 
i know you love the people  kit 
but i also know
that your head s been turned 
but you ve only met her once 
in the forest 
and you would have me
marry someone i met once  tonight 
a princess 
it s a princess or nothing 
hold the doors  one more coming in 
may i present her royal highness 
the princess chelina of zaragosa 
you are as handsome as your picture 
and your little kingdom is enchanting 
i hope the princess will not find
our  little kingdom  too confining 
miss ella 
thank you 
i m frightened  mr  lizard 
i m only a girl  not a princess 
and i m only a lizard  not a footman 
enjoy it while it lasts 
your majesty  your royal highness 
my lords  ladies and gentlemen 
distinguished visitors
and people of our land 
the prince shall now choose his partner
for the first dance 
let our ball commence 
excuse me 
a thousand apologies 
your royal highness 
i don t know what happened 
mr  kit 
it s you 
isn t it 
just so 
your highness   
if i may 
that is 
it would give me the greatest pleasure 
if you would do me the honor
of letting me lead you through this   
the first   
dance 
yes  dance 
that s it 
they re all looking at you 
believe me  they re all looking at you 
who is she 
i have no idea 
who s that  mama 
i m not exactly sure 
but this does not bode well 
that s a lovely dress she s got on 
  and how pretty she is 
  concentrate 
you must turn the prince s head 
you fools  now  get out there 
but no one s asked us to dance 
gentlemen 
may i present my daughters 
  anastasia  drisella 
  mademoiselle 
off you go 
smile 
come with me 
over there  smile 
so  you re the prince 
not  the prince   exactly 
there are plenty of princes
in the world  i m only a prince 
but your name s not really kit 
certainly it is 
and my father still calls me that 
when he s especially un peeved at me 
but you re no apprentice 
i am  an apprentice monarch 
still learning my trade 
oh  gosh 
look  please forgive me 
i thought you might treat me
differently if you knew 
i mistook you
for a good  honest country girl 
and now i see you didn t want
to overawe a plain soldier 
little chance of that 
no more surprises 
no more surprises 
is that you 
i hate myself in paintings  don t you 
no one s ever painted my portrait 
no  well  they should 
who is she 
she gave no name  your grace 
you didn t ask 
i was out of breath  your grace 
on account of introducing
princess blodwyn
of llanfairpwllgwyngyll   
  shut up  will you 
   shut up   absolutely 
i don t believe this 
no  not her 
won t they miss you at the ball 
maybe 
but let s not go back just yet 
what s wrong 
when i go back 
they will try to pair me off
with a lady of their choosing 
i m expected to marry for advantage 
well  whose advantage 
that is a good question 
well  surely you have a right
to your own heart 
and i must weigh that
against the king s wishes 
he s a wise ruler and a loving father 
well  perhaps he ll change his mind 
i fear he hasn t much time to do so 
poor kit 
people are saying she s a princess 
our prince seems quite taken with her 
she went straight for him 
you have to appreciate her efficiency 
but surely  if she is a princess 
this may be good 
i ve already promised him in marriage 
to the princess chelina 
but   
forgive me  your grace 
i did not mean to intrude 
no  it s you who have
to forgive me  madam 
your secret is safe with me 
i ve never shown this place to anyone 
a secret garden 
i love it 
please 
no  i shouldn t 
you should 
  i shouldn t 
  you should 
i will

please 
it s made of glass 
and why not

if i do  i think

lizards and pumpkins  and things

i ve loved it 
every second 
 lizards and pumpkins

your father needs you here 
captain

didn t you

hurry  mr  goose

hee ya

oh  my goodness

such bad timing

oh  dear 
no  no  no 
i m sorry 
you ll find it s very comfortable 
do shut up 
cinderella 
cinderella  we ll have to wake her up 
cinderella 
wake up  lazy bones 
tea and a plate of biscuits 
welcome back 
  you look cheerful 
  and wet 
i took a walk in the rain
to cheer myself up 
typical 
tea 
we did not communicate
through mere words 
our souls met 
precisely  my soul
and the prince s soul 
your soul was over
by the banquet tables 
you didn t see him dance with me 
dance with you 
he didn t even speak to you 
it was not our fault  mother 
it was that girl 
the mystery princess 
mystery princess 
my  what a charming notion 
she was no princess 
she was a preening interloper
who made a spectacle of herself 
a vulgar  young hussy
marched into the ball 
unaccompanied  if you will 
and to the horror of everyone 
threw herself at the prince 
and he actually danced
with the ugly thing 
  yes 
  yes 
it was pity 
he was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone  you see 
but not wanting to expose us
to the presumptuous wench any further 
  he took her apart 
  and told her off 
but she refused to leave
and the palace guards
chased her from the party 
i pity the prince  such bad taste 
they belong with each other 
well  it s no matter  girls 
the ball was a mere diversion 
the prince is not free
to marry for love 
he s promised to the
princess chelina of zaragosa 
the grand duke told me himself 
it s so very unfair 
yes 
the way of the world 
hello again 
thank you for your help 
it really was like a dream 
better than a dream 
ella couldn t wait to write down
all that had happened 
so that she might remember
every single bit of it
just as if she were telling
her mother and father
about the palace ball
and her time with the prince 
above all  the prince 
you ve come 
good 
father 
don t go 
i must 
you needn t be alone 
take a bride 
the princess chelina 
what if i commanded you to do so 
i love and respect you  but i will not 
i believe that we need not
look outside of our borders
for strength or guidance 
what we need is right before us 
and we need only have courage
and be kind to see it 
just so 
you ve become your own man 
good 
and perhaps 
in the little time left to me 
i can become the father you deserve 
you must not marry for advantage 
you must marry for love 
find that girl 
find her 
the one they re all talking about 
the forgetful one
  who loses her shoes 
     loses her shoes 
be cheerful  boy 
thank you  father 
thank you  kit 
i love you  son 
i love you  father 
once the time for mourning had passed 
a proclamation was sent out 
hear ye  hear ye 
hear ye 
know that our new king
hereby declares his love for
the mysterious princess
as wore
glass slippers to the ball 
and requests that she present herself
at the palace 
whereupon  if she be willing 
he will forthwith marry her
with all due ceremony 
are you looking for this 
there must be quite a story
to go with it 
won t you tell me 
no 
all right then 
i shall tell you a story 
once upon a time 
there was a beautiful young girl
who married for love 
and she had two loving daughters 
all was well 
but  one day  her husband 
the light of her life  died 
the next time 
she married for the sake
of her daughters 
but that man  too  was taken from her 
and she was doomed to look
every day upon his beloved child 
she had hoped to marry off
one of her beautiful 
stupid daughters to the prince 
but his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers 
and so 
i lived unhappily ever after 
my story would appear to be ended 
now  tell me yours 
did you steal it 
no 
it was given to me 
given to you 
given to you  nothing is ever given 
for everything  we must pay and pay 
that s not true 
kindness is free  love is free 
love is not free 
now  here is how you will pay me 
if you are to have what you desire 
no one will believe you 
a dirty servant girl without a family 
if you lay claim to the prince s heart 
but with a respectable gentlewoman
to put you forward 
you will not be ignored 
when you are married 
you will make me
the head of the royal household 
anastasia and drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords 
and i shall manage that boy 
but he s not a boy 
and who are you 
how would you rule a kingdom 
best to leave it to me 
that way we all get what we want 
no 
no 
i was not able to protect
my father from you 
but i will protect the prince
and the kingdom 
no matter what becomes of me 
well  that is a mistake 
no 
why 
why are you so cruel 
i don t understand it 
i ve tried to be kind to you 
you  kind to me 
yes 
and though no one deserves to be treated
as you have treated me 
why do you do it 
why 
because you are young 
and innocent  and good 
and i   
no 
may i ask where you got this 
from a ragged servant girl
in my household 
the mystery princess is a commoner 
you could imagine when i discovered
her subterfuge how horrified i was 
you told no one else 
not even my own daughters 
no one need ever know the truth 
you ve spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment 
and i should like to keep it that way 
are you threatening me 
yes 
so what do you want 
i should like to be a countess 
and i require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters 
done 
and the girl 
do with her what you will 
she s nothing to me 
  where 
  abandoned on the side of the road 
  and have you found her 
  the girl 
no  she s disappeared 
there must be some reason she vanished 
perhaps she has been prevented
from speaking 
do not lose heart  kit 
on the contrary 
lose heart and gain wisdom 
the people need to know
that the kingdom is secure 
that the king has a queen 
and the land may have an heir 
they want to face the future
with certainty 
agreed  then let us be certain 
i am king 
i say we shall seek out
the mystery princess 
even if she does not want to be found 
i have to see her again 
but if she s not found 
then for the good of the kingdom 
you must marry the princess chelina 
for the good of the kingdom 
very well  agreed 
but your highness   
but you will spare no effort 
your majesty  of course 
you have my word 
next 
the slipper traveled the length
and breadth of the kingdom 
visiting every maiden both high and low 
and every sort in between 
oh  lord 
you first  madam 
well  i ll give it a go 
right  i say  where do you want me 
up  up i go 
careful  my foot s a bit swollen 
i ve been   
it s the yeast 
the grand duke was true to his word 
he spared no effort
to demonstrate to the prince
that the mystery princess
was not to be found 
it fits 
  it doesn t fit you 
  it does fit 
  it doesn t fit 
  it s mine 
  i am the mystery princess 
  give back the shoe 
take the shoe away from her 
don t take the shoe away from me 
please  please 
please  it s my shoe 
make way for the slipper 
can i try the other foot 
i don t think so 
but whatever they tried 
the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens 
we found the mystery princess for ya 
what s wrong  captain 
we haven t found the girl 
i m disappointed for our king 
come on  now  don t lose heart 
there s one more house 
we must leave no stone unturned 
  horses 
  horses 
mother  it s our chance 
let them in 
gentlemen  what a wonderful surprise 
a moment of your time  good lady 
of course  your grace 
please  this way 
ella did not know who was downstairs 
nor did she care 
for surely no one had come to see her 
jacqueline  stop it 
it shrunk 
try again 
enough 
you must love me   
though ella was sad 
her spirit was not broken 
she knew that the ball 
and her time with the prince 
would become
beautiful  distant memories 
like those of her father and mother 
and her golden childhood 
it fits me 
bad luck  miss 
lavender s green dilly  dilly
lavender s blue
you must love me dilly  dilly
for i love you
very well 
our task is done  captain 
but fate may yet be kind to us  girls 
indeed  madam 
when i am king dilly  dilly
you shall be queen
lavender s green dilly  dilly
lavender s blue
if you love me
dilly  dilly
i will love you
let the birds sing dilly  dilly
and the lambs play
we shall be safe dilly  dilly  
do you hear that  your grace 
let s be off  captain 
just a moment 
madam 
there is no other maiden in your house 
none 
then has your cat learned to sing 
there s been enough play acting today 
captain  let s be off 
but she s lying  your grace 
nonsense  i trust the lady 
we re leaving 
grand duke 
your majesty 
what sweet singing 
makes me want to tarry just a little 
your majesty  i did not know   
captain  would you be so kind
as to investigate 
it would be my pleasure  your majesty 
if you love me dilly  dilly
i will love you
there  you see 
i told you it was no one
of any importance 
we ll see about that 
miss 
you are requested and required
to present yourself to your king 
i forbid you to do this 
and i forbid you to forbid her 
who are you to stop
an officer of the king 
are you an empress 
a saint 
a deity 
i am her mother 
you have never been
and you never will be my mother 
come now  miss 
just remember who you are  you wretch 
would who she was 
who she really was  be enough 
there was no magic
to help her this time 
this is perhaps the greatest risk
that any of us will take 
to be seen as we truly are 
have courage  and be kind 
who are you 
i am cinderella 
your majesty 
i m no princess 
i have no carriage 
no parents 
and no dowry 
i do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit 
but
if it does 
will you take me as i am 
an honest country girl who loves you 
of course i will 
but only if you will take me as i am 
an apprentice still learning his trade 
please 
cinderella 
ella 
my dear sister  i m sorry 
so very sorry 
shall we 
i forgive you 
forgiven or not 
cinderella s stepmother
and her daughters
would soon leave with the grand duke 
and never set foot in the kingdom again 
they would have loved each other 
we must have a portrait of you painted 
no  i do hate myself in paintings 
be kind 
and have courage 
and all will be well 
are you ready 
for anything  so long as it s with you 
my queen 
my kit 
and so kit and ella were married 
and i can tell you 
as her fairy godmother 
that they were counted to be
the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known 
and ella continued to see
the world not as it is 
but as it could be 
if only you believe in courage
and kindness and occasionally 
just a little bit of magic 
in a perfect storybook
the world is brave and good
a hero takes your hand
a sweet love
will find love
but life s a different game
the sorrow and the pain
only you can change your world tomorrow
let your smile light up the sky
keep your spirit soaring high
trust in your heart
and your sun shines forever and ever
hold fast to kindness
your light shines forever and ever
i believe in you and in me
we are strong
when once upon a time
in stories and in rhyme
a moment you can shine
and wear your own crown
be the one that rescues you
through the clouds you ll see the blue
trust in your heart
and your sun shines forever and ever
hold fast to kindness
your light shines forever and ever
i believe in you and in me
we are strong
a bird all alone on the wing
can still be strong and sing
sing
trust in your heart
and your sun shines forever and ever
hold fast to kindness
your light shines forever and ever
i believe in you and in me
we are strong
a dream is a wish your heart makes
when you re fast asleep
in dreams you will lose your heartaches
whatever you wish for you keep
have faith in your dreams and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true
a dream is a wish your heart makes
when you re fast asleep
in dreams you will lose your heartaches
whatever you wish for you keep
have faith in your dreams and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through
no matter how your heart is grieving
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish
will come true
  well done  ella
