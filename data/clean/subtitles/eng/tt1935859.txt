nothing you do matters 
you leave footprints on the
beach and somehow they are gone

which made me feel even worse

september 3rd  1943 
its okay  just   
just don t move 
there s an ambulance coming 
i know you think i m crazy 
but the bird will
explain everything 
will you do this tegrisco 
promise me 
i promise  yes  
i thought i could protect you 
i should have told you years ago 
grandpa  tell me   
tell me what 
grandpa 
shelly behind you 
there was no one there 
may i say jake   
that considering this
was only a month ago
i think you re doing
exceptionally well 
apart from being crazy 
having nightmares and anxiety
doesn t make you crazy 
and what about seeing
things which aren t there 
actually in dramatic situations
its not at all uncommon 
your subconscious mind draws
an image from a movie  or   
it was a story 
my grandpa told me
stories when i was a kid 
about monsters that
he fought in the war 
so there you go 
he was brutally attacked 
and in your head the man
who did it was inhuman 
a monster 
it wasn t a man though 
the cops said that dogs
scratched up the screen door 
and he chased them
off into the woods 
and the coroner said
he had a heart attack 
and the cops said
dogs went for the soft parts 
the dna had wounds of animals
so that s case closed 
he sounds like an
extraordinary gentleman 
were you very close 
puerto rico 
here 
there is a lake where the
water glows in the dark 
and a secret tunnel  that s
where i hid from the monsters 
he used to babysit me a lot 
and when i was with
him i felt special 
abe 
its like 11 o clock 
what is he doing up 
i m going to be an explorer 
grandpas told me about
my first voyage 
everything has already
been discovered  buddy 
pay no attention to your father 
he knows bubkiss 
come tegrisco    off to bed 
can you tell me a story 
the usual 
okay 
once upon a time there
was a little boy
where s the pictures 
pictures 
once upon a time a
little boy called abe 
that was you 
that was me and he lived
in a lovely children s home on
an little island near wales 
where the sun shone every day 
the headmistress 
miss peregrine   
was very clever 
and she smoked my pipe 
she could turn into a bird 
it was a home for special children 
like bronwyn   
and victor 
they were both as
strong as ten men 
and hugh
hugh had bees living inside him 
where is emma  she could float 
she was lighter than air 
she had to wear special
shoes made of lead
to keep her from floating away 
where is she now 
she s still on the island  i believe 
my mom and papa sent me there 
to live with the
special children 
and now tegrisco time to sleep 
he used to call me tegrisco 
its polish  for little tiger 
couldn t have picked a
less appropriate nickname 
i was always a chicken 
why your mom and
dad send you away 
where we lived in poland 
it was not safe 
there were monsters 
what kind of monsters 
huge ones 
with long arms and no eyes 
and tentacles like this 
the dumb thing was  for years i
actually believed his stories 
this is millard  he s invisible 
my teacher says they
are trick photos 
and did you believe her 
dad says that you get in one of those
places that you were traveling 
i would never lie to you  tegrisco 
but you did it 
about the home    the monsters 
dad told me 
your father knows very well that i
went to live in the children s home 
he said there were
monsters in poland 
just not the kind with tentacles 
he said you got sent away to wales
because there were bad people 
people who wanted to kill
anyone who was different
i do not want to talk
about this anymore 
he said children were special
but not the way you said 
you find something good 
aw  look at that 
it s awesome 
take that 
c mon buddy  lets roll 
how are you so okay 
jake  you were a lot closer
to him than i ever was 
he was a wonderful grandpa  but not   
not such a great dad  you know 
never seemed to pick a
job that didn t involve
late nights and long
trips away though 
me and aunt sussie i always kinda thought
he was maybe cheating on our mom 
i am sorry  buddy  i know how much
you worshipped him but there it is 
surprise  
happy birthday  cousin jake 
jake  its great you ve to come
to spend the summer with us 
wait till you see the new dogs 
can t wait 
its aunt sussie 
thought you might want
to open this one 
its from your grandpa 
found it while i was packing up  i figured
he meant to give it to you someday 
thanks 
 complete essays and other
writings of ralph waldo emerson  
to jake and the worlds
he has yet to discover 
 my dearest abe  
i hope this card finds you well 
the children and i yearn
to hear your news 
i do hope you will
visit us again soon 
 we should so love to see you  
 with admiration  alma peregrine  
hmm    only two years ago
i suppose its possible she
could still be still be alive 
right 
and i could meet her 
maybe even find out what it was
grandpa wanted me to know 
but what if she s dead 
dr  golan  we are very concerned
with jake s state of mind right now 
and there is no way i m putting my
life on hold to take you to wales 
dad could take me 
and he can even look at birds   
work in his book 
it means you get a break 
and as dr  golan said 
maybe i can move on 
like closure 
having an opportunity to
see this children s home
and separate fantasy
from reality 
may be useful and at the very least a
trip like this provides a chance to
say goodbye 
cairnholm  population of 92 
best known for its proximity to the
final resting place of the cruise liner
augusta which sank in 1915 
there is only one hotel 
that s us
i hope there s bourbon 
oh wow  jake  check it out 
that s a peregrine falcon

the tale of turning into a bird thing 
maybe  maybe that s really her

home by myself

take your time 
and i enjoy it 
come on  jakey  you know
your mom would freak 
what if we can find
someone to take me 
hey dudes

i was just wondering if any of you guys
might be interested in taking my son here 
to the other side of the island 
and what are your names 
i am worm and this
is epsy denty 
epsy bussines 
  i thought you changed that 
  no 
no  you did remember 
when lou said epsy bussines made
it look like cracked trousers 
yeah  but she said it sounded
like a personal hygiene problem 
wait  are these are
like nicknames or   
stage names of rappers
here in wales 
come on  worm  show
this shank how its done 
what  now 
i like to throw letters
in the churches 
my father is always
there  the very dog

september the 3rd  1943 
where    where did
they go after it 
the headmistress
and the children 
not one survivor 
poor little buggers    and
they were lovely too 
why didn t he tell us
that they all died 
he leaves to join the army and three
months everyone he knows gets killed 
not even grandpa can turn
that into a bedtime story 
no wonder he was
scared at being a dad 
being close to anyone 
listen 
if you need to talk about all
this with someone  buddy 
we should call dr  golan 
do you mind if i go hang out
with those other kids today 
they asked 
yeah  that s awesome
abe

and the twins 
and olive 
bromwin 
he s miller

none of us are dead 
oh my god  am i dead

before you started screaming  running
away and concussing yourself 
wait  what s happening

clear before we go into the loop 
you never know who
might be watching 
wait  before we

maybe he s army 
bollocks  listen to his accent

no  i m not i m a tourist
i say  we should get
the truth out of him
the old fashioned way 
come on  quick guys 
i can t believe you re real 
you re all real 
we ve been trying to tell you 
but i am special too 
what 
in the pub all of you saw it 
right 
everything was flying and breaking 
and that was me 
i was doing it with my mind 
no  that was me
miller  yeah 
are you naked  yeah 
a bomb drops on you in 1943 
it is 1943
september the 3rd  1943 
the whole day  every day 
its our loop 
right on time 
ms  peregrine 
delighted to meet you 
i do hope i m not going
to have the pub landlord
knocking on my door
with the police again 
i ve had to kill them
twice this month 
its been terribly inconvenient 
we may have broken some
things  that s all 
and olive may have
started a tiny fire 
but they were going
to hurt jake 
look at you 
the last time dear abe sent me a
photograph  you were a just a tiny todd 
don t you stand there  come in 
your tea is getting cold 
how did you know about the pub 
your weigh approximately
a 109 pounds  correct 
bronwyn and the twins returned
six minutes after you ran away 
i think i m missing something 
and quite apart from the fact that the
perceived safety of the pub makes it   
the most likely place to
which you would flee 
it would take you 18
minutes to run there 
emma and miller would
have been moments behind
with the horse and trap traveling
at around 8 2 miles per hour 
fact doing some sort of
kerfuffle in the pub
and the return journey
with your added weight 
you would arrive here
with 30 minutes past 4
now then  do you like sugar 
that will be enough  thank you olive 
nobody enjoys over boiled tea 
let me help you  enoch 
do not bother 
wouldn t want you to
interrupt the tea party 
i m so sorry for
your loss  jake 
you know  then 
i know if abe were alive 
you would have told
me you were coming 
shall we take our tea outside 
before he died he
told me to find you 
there was something
he wanted me to know 
he said you could
explain everything 
that s absolutely true  but there
are few things i can t explain 
we are in common
parlance   as peculiar
51 seconds late  fiona 
sorry ms  peregrine 
how many carrots you
need for supper 
just one will do 
as i was saying some
people are peculiar 
its a recessive gene carried
down through families 
yet  many generations can pass
without a peculiar child being born 
and alas  peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages 
hence  we live in places like this 
in wales 
anywhere will do if you
pick the right day 
that s fine now  fiona 
you see  i am a type of peculiar
called an ymbryne  that means i can   
you can turn into a bird 
well i do  but that s
not very useful 
an ymbryne s main skill is
the manipulation of time 
we chose a safe place  a
safe day and create a loop 
what do you mean 
a loop preserves
the last 24 hours 
reset the loop and the day
is yours to live in again 
reset it daily and you
can stay there forever 
entirely safe from
the outside world 
right on time
bronwyn  good girl 
and that s why we ymbrynes are
charged with the care of the young 
and no one ever gets older 
its best for everyone this way
i assure you 
each ymbryne commits herself to the
creation and upkeep of a place like this 
a home for peculiar children 
you ve met the twins 
this is claire
miller you ve met 
and that s hugh 
stop cheating hugh
miller thats a foul  again 
no it wasn t 
if you two cant play without squabbling 
wish you wouldn t play at all 
look who our referee is 
good afternoon  i m horace 
delighted to meet you 
we sorely needed some new blood here 
super shirt by the way 
thanks 
you know emma  of course 
and i think thats everyone 
didn t bronwyn have a brother 
yes  victor s upstairs 
wait  where did
enoch and olive go 
heaven knows 
enoch s been off ever since
we went to look for jake 
ms  peregrine there s a
policemen at the door 
he says it s about the pub 
we discuss this later  emma 
it wasn t their fault 
honestly  just they were
just trying to help 
thanks  you re not
as vet as i thought 
she s not really going
to kill anyone  is she 
not if she can talk
her way out of it 
would you help me
with something 
enoch usually does it but  like i
said  he is sulking somewhere 
is that because of me 
he is possessive 
so    what you need help with 
one of my daily chores 
put the baby squirrel
back in the tree 
what baby squirrel 
that happens every day 
like clockwork 
now  would you mind tying
that rope around my waist 
uh    yeah 
right  promise to hold on tight 
i knew we messed that up 
abe did too    the first time 
this used to be his job
emma    i need to tell you something 
he is dead 
i know  ms  peregrine guessed
and she s always right 
it s okay
i said goodbye to him
a long time ago 
were you close 
i thought we were 
for a while 
but i suppose not 
can i ask  was he like you 
he was like you  jake 
i need to go change for supper 
will you be dining with us 
i can t stay out late 
suppers at 5 30 
well that s pretty early 
the fact we are not all eight years of
old s seems to have eluded ms  peregrine 
you can borrow some of abe s clothes 
his room s in the attic
jake 
come meet enoch  properly 
well  you must feel pretty out of place 
don t worry  i am used to it 
i wasn t worried  some
advice for you though 
man to man 
if you think you re staying
just because you like emma 
don t bother 
you see she swore off romance years
ago when she got her heart broken 
and she s never gonna
change her mind 
enoch  i wasn t   
what are you doing 
isn t he amazing 
what did you do 
this 
jake  this is not even the fun part 
do you want to see the fun part 
they are like puppets 
just do anything i tell them 
it is even more fun with people 
you should have seen some of the
epic battles i used to have 
at my parent s funeral parlour 
you need a necktie 
so  what did my grandpa
do when he was traveling 
visited other loops 
really 
to do what 
jake  there are some questions
i can t answer  alright 
so it will be a lot easier for me
if you just stopped asking them 
hey  what are you doing 
miller  go and put
some clothes on 
polite persons do not
take the sup in the nude 
alright 
you can sit here jake 
look at enoch  he s jealous 
why would i be jealous 
all of you can go marry
jake for all i care 
do not be mean  enoch 
she doesn t want to 
she s just excited
to have a visitor 
nobody is marrying anybody 
now eat up your food
before it gets cold 
hugh 
where s your net 
it must be very
strange for you jake 
to meet your
grandfather s friends 
visiting another century 
there spaceships in
your time  jake 
like the flash gordon books 
now  now  olive  what did i
say about the questions 
we don t discuss the future here 
we enjoy living in
the here and now
claire  why aren t you eating 
she s embarrassed
in front of jake 
don t be  please 
so  jake  what is your peculiarity 
oh  i m    i m not peculiar 
and that my friends is why
he ll not be staying with us 
no matter how hard we
try to persuade him 
we ve spoken about this 
jake is just visiting 
do you not want to stay  jake 
tonight or   
forever  you should stay forever 
why would he if he doesn t have to 
he can live out there  grow older
and have a good time instead 
and leave  just like his grandfather did 
emma 
excuse me  where she s going 
that wasn t nice  enoch 
you know perfectly
well why abe left us 
to join the army 
and then he met a lady 
and had a nice wedding cake 
and a lovely little baby 
children 
i know you d all like a new friend 
but i m sure jake has plenty
of his own back in florida 
i think you should all get ready for
movie time while i answer that 
but you always let us stay for it 
hi  this is abe 
how is everyone 
yours has extra marshmallows  jake 
miller  put some pajamas on 
it is very hot in here 
stop moaning  excuse me 
my grandpa told me about this 
horace projects his dreams  right 
he used to listen to the radio 
gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart 
splendid  i ll take it 
it sounds about clothes mostly 
delighted to meet you 
super shirt by the way 
when did he dream this 
last night 
some of his dreams are prophetic 
but mostly they are about clothes 
prophetic as in  he can
see into the future 
the ymbryne  who is she 
mrs  peregrine  you know her 
don t be silly  horace was just
having a bad dream  thats all 
thats quite enough 
thank you horace 
i think probably get going 
you could stay the night  if you wanted to 
rather than walk home in the dark 
but the island is very safe  isn t it 
of course
i only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy 
jake could trip 
perhaps you could show
him the shortcuts 
should he ever need to avoid   
bumps 
wont you stay to see the restart 
it is really quite spectacular 
what was that 
it was my phone 
it s been dead the whole time
in the loop i guess now   
your phone 
yeah  i don t like it  a telephone 
you can call people   
and send written messages 
right  you ll love this 
you can take a picture 
press that    there    yeah 
see 
whats wrong 
its just funny to think that one
day you ll grow up like abe did 
get married    have children 
grandchildren 
you might even show
them this photograph 
and i ll still be here 
wha    can you leave some day 
and live in the present
if you wanted to 
no  more than a few minutes in your
time and the years would catch up 
you d age 
would    you re   
i think it is the ymbryne
from horace s dream 
are you sure it s not just a bird 
i mean  i don t know   
wouldn t it change 
she can t  not if she s hurt 
i need to take her inside 
you should go 
please do not say anything else 
i hate goodbyes
i ll come back tomorrow 
there s no hurry 
i ll be here forever 
hey

island where the hell were you 
i was just on my way back

crap o island  we re sticking together 
where are you going 
downstairs for a drink 
dearest peregrine

but one of my informants sent me this 
it would appear that some of mr  barron s
group were in black pool  england 
 if i recall  ms  avocet has a loop there  
 please warn her and suggest that
she make a new one right away  
 well hidden  
and take the greatest care yourself

emma said it was an ymbryne 
she  not  it   ymbrynes
are always female 
and emma was quite correct 
this is ms  avocet 
her loop is in black pool england 
that was a private letter  jake 
who is mr barron 
ms  peregrine  if my grandpa was
involved with dangerous people
i need to tell the police 
to the police 
are you implying abe
died an unnatural death 
i found him in the woods
with eyes missing 
i d say that was pretty unnatural 
unless essential  i don t
discuss unpleasant matters 
an ymbryne s is a duty to
protect children  jake 
i am not a child 
he wanted you to tell me everything 
oh  how frustrating for you 
between ms  peregrine rules and
my         not to scare you off 
it s like no ones telling you anything  
so why don t you then 
it s not like you want me here 
enoch  you can t 
you promised 
olive is right 
however  i know someone
who can break the rules

enoch  do not do this  please 
you didn t want us to spend time together 
that s what you said 
well  here we all are 
move  olive 
if you re going to be like then i
do not want to be your friend 
enoch  leave victor alone 
it really upsets bromwyn 
stop fussing  fiona  don t you
think jake should meet everybody 
he s trying to frighten
you away  jake 
he was always jealous of abe
and now he s jealous of you 
come and play with us instead
i d quite like to meet victor 
after you 
hello victor 
i m jake  i m sorry to disturb   
he can t hear you 
hello jake  i m victor  do you
want to know what killed me 
ah  there you are 
is he not with you 
its time for our daily walk 
emma  who killed victor  was it
the people with the white eyes 
i asked you not to ask questions 
i saw one the night my grandpa died 
if it really was one  you
have to tell ms  peregrinee 
could you recognize you recognize
him from a photograph 
do you have one 
then come on 
there s somewhere i go to be alone 
i have things there 
  is this the place 
  no  this is how we get there 
emma  your shoes  lead shoes 
  welcome to my secret hideout 
  how  how did you   
air  my peculiarity 
it does what i want
jake  before your grandfather retired 
he asked me to keep this safe 
this is my grandpa s old map 
it shows you where the loops are 
that s him  thats the man i saw 
who is he 
thats barron  he is the leader 
leader of what 
who are these people 
bad people    bad peculiars 
abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down 
these are the ones
he never found 
what do you mean  hunting  
they raided homes  whole homes
full of children left for dead 
abe took lives   
to save life s 
he only retired when you
were born to protect you 
from what 
if i tell you the rest  you have
to promise not to run away 
jake  you belong here 
you know that i don t 
i m not like you 
i m just ordinary 
no  but you re not 
jake  only a peculiar can
enter a time loop 
no  that can t be right 
i mean    i would know 
fine 
then i ll show you
something else 
hurry  you ll miss it 
ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect date to create a loop 
but ms  peregrinee   
had to make this one in a rush 
why 
because the germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house 
the point is  september
the 3rd  1943   
wasn t perfect 
the thing that killed
victor came back 
  wait  watch out 
  shhh  all bets are off 
you can see it  can t you 
no one else can 
its invisible  jake  that was
abe s greatest gift of all 
he could see the monsters 
we call them  hollowgasts  
hollows  for short 
my grandpa told me about people 
who turn into monsters 
is that what they are 
i will explain everything  jake 
i fear its my duty
now considering   
but you should know
that in doing so   
i m breaking a solemn promise 
i knew you were peculiar
when you were born
but your grandfather   
forbid me to tell you anything 
his dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood 
well i definitely had that 
he intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18 
he hoped his bed time
stories would pave the way 
here s my book 
many years ago 
a splinter faction emerged
among our people 
disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops 
that s mr  barron 
he believed that by harnessing the
essence of an ymbryne s powers 
he and his cronies 
could gain immortality and be
able to live outside loops 
he devised an experiment 
he kidnapped an ymbryne
not knowing or caring whether she
would survive the experiment 
but the fate of barron and his
group was more horrifying still 
why didn t barron turn into one 
he did  but years later he found a way to
reverse the effects    to regain humanity 
they had become not immortal
gods   but hollows 
invisible beasts  dangerous 
cold blooded  deadly 
remember i told you they raided loops 
this is why 
barron discovered that by consuming
the eyes of other peculiars   
especially children 
he began to change 
consume enough  and a hollow can
fully regain its human form 
just as barron and some
of his friends did 
the rest of them are
stuck as hollows 
are you saying that
barron ate my uncle s   
he needs no more eyes himself 
but i fear he led a hollow
to your grandfather  yes 
after the first
attacks on loops 
we all got better at hiding
   making new loops    keeping our 
whereabouts secret 
the hollows grew more
desperate every year
and barron wishes to
help his friends 
miss peregrine  come quickly 
miss avocet s awake 
oh miss peregrine  they
found my new loop 
the children    i tried to save them
but there were so many hollows   
  i don t know how i escaped 
  you are safe now 
none of us are safe 
they set up the
machine in my loop 
they put in in the cellar
at blackboat tower 
  they re still there   
  the machine 
the experiment 
they intend to do it again 
this time  he s using
more ymbrynes 
he still wants to be immortal 
do hollows only
attack peculiars 
of course not  they re
monsters  jake 
they ll slaughter
anything in their path 
well  some sheep on the
island were killed 
you don t think they re
here already  do you 
have you seen anyone
with white eyes 
i m sorry children 
we can t remain here 
what 
we leave on the first ferry 
off the island tomorrow 
pack anything of importance 
i ll make sandwiches
and lead you to bed 
are we leaving for good 
when are we coming back 
never  if ms  peregrine s not here
to reset the loop tomorrow night   
  the house gets bombed 
  what  our house 
don t cry  miss peregrine will find you
another lovely house    somewhere else 
once this loop closes  that s it 
i can t get back to my own time 
you didn t seem
very happy there 
i can t just leave 
i have a family 
and you felt ordinary  like
nothing you do changes anything 
and  now you have a chance to do
something that changes everything 
jake  were in danger   
and you re the only one
who can see the hollows 
yeah  i see them sure
but  i m not my grandpa 
i m not and i   i
can t fight  i can t kill somebody   
there s only one reason
that i d stay here 
please     just go 
jake    jake  here you are 
thank god 
when i heard they found
a body  i freaked 
  are there stray dogs around here 
  what are you talking about 
its like 
when they find an injured animal 
they go for the soft parts first 
same thing happened
to my father 
the police are on their way 
dad  i gotta go 
no    you don t jake 
if this wasn t an accident   
there s a lunatic on the island 
i ve known everyone on this island 
my whole life except you and him   
and he s been in the
pub all afternoon 
so have i    i was sleeping 
what about the blind fellow 
i mean   
i assumed he was blind 
the gentleman with the dark glasses 
arrived on the same ferry as me 
  i kept seeing him around 
  jake  jake 
  is your son alright 
  no  he has mental health issues 
  i can t   
  let me  i run 5 k s all the time 
hello 
hello  is that you  young man 
you came through    
you re a peculiar 
oh yes  and i m extremely
grateful to you 
it s terribly hard    to
find loops these days 
so you followed me from
the beach on purpose 
oh no  i ve been following
you much further than that 
dr  golan  
sometimes when it suits me   
the breadth of
my peculiarity is purely
limited by my imagination   
the only thing i can t change   
is my eyes 
mr  barron  how do you do 
i saw you  at your grandfather s 
i was hoping to get 
ms  peregrine s address
from him  but alas   
my traveling companion got
to him before i did   
and as you know  there s no
stopping a hungry hollowgasts 
speaking of my traveling companion   
he s coming 
and believe me when i say to you
you don t want to be here 
when he arrives 
so  lets be on your way   
shall we 
i mustn t forget our calendar 
could you fetch it from the
parlor please  miss avocet 
go and help the others 
miss  peregrinee what a
pleasure to meet you  at last 
may we come in 
children  would you make your
way down the stairs please 
i give the orders in
this house  mr  baron 
not today 
you should know that jake
has served his purpose 
if you value his life
i suggest everyone does as
they are told  children 
shush  no one tells my
children what to do 
children come down here  please 
ms  peregrine   
i thought i told you to be quiet 
children  for jake s safety  we are
going to do what mr  barron asks 
he wishes to take me with him
to his rendezvous in blackpool 
so for his protection  he would
like me to assume bird form 
preferably caged   
and he d like you to make your way into
a lockable room  such as the parlor 
as he wont release jake
if he fears an attack could be mounted
upon him once he loses his leverage 
correct  mr  barron 
you are sacrificing yourself
and all of us    for jake 
mr  barron travels
with a hollow  enoch 
once it arrives here 
we re all dead 
enoch  only jake can see them 
she means he s our only hope 
it s been my privilege 
to care for you all 
goodbye  my children 
now  let him go 
promise me one thing  jake 
that you will try to
look after them all 
i promise 
its getting dark  you won t even
be able to see their shadows 
we have to stay inside  its the
only place we stand a chance 
he s quite right 
now where does miss 
peregrine keep her weapon 
now    all right children 
make sure all the doors are locked
and the windows are latched 
everything must be sealed up tight 
now quickly  quickly go 
jake  i think tonight
you better answer that 
hello 
you    you don t know me 
i m jake 
ah  you re new  well 
welcome to the family jake 
now i can t talk long 
so just tell miss peregrine that
i m at the airbase  and i m fine 
i just wanted to say
that  i miss you
and if i disappointed
you  i m sorry   
and you re the best
grandpa in the world 
  fiona 
  got it 
miss  avocet  now children  now that
you are all here  there s a few rules 
your primary job is to stay safe 
leave the hollow to me 
i don t want to see any heroics 
now  those of you with garden tools 
i must insist that you   
no enoch  get back 
go  get to the attic 
take her 
go  go  get out  all come on 
alright    crap  its almost reset 
fiona  is there anything you can do
with that tree 
be careful 
we re going through the windows 
lets go 
come on 
claire  come on down 
go fiona 
let s move on 
  what was that 
  the loop closing  it is gone 
i m sorry jake 
what do we do now 
is there any sign of barron   
  and miss  peregrinee 
  gone  barron must have had a boat 
well  we have to go after them 
we know he is taking her to blackpool 
but blackpool is miles
away  and the next ferry
doesn t go for hours  
we ll never make it in time 
not unless we go by boat too 
so there s a loop here in blackpool 
its only six months old 
january 11th  2016 
with miss  avocet gone   
  it can t be reset 
  won t the loop closes 
then its back to real time 
jake  you know what
this means  don t you 
you re going to die 
thats not what i mean 
we have to get to our own time 
but you don t 
you can continue
to live in 2016 
but why would i do that 
if we kill barron 
he ll be gone but time will carry on 
he won t go to florida 
abe won t die and
you can go home 
i can see my grandpa 
listen  i can explain
everything to them 
i can persuade them to
take me to the island 
will you still there 
our old loop s gone    for good 
we wouldn t see
each other again 
i thought you wanted me to stay
i know you ll choose abe 
if i minded i wouldn t have told you 
so  we found miss  avocet s
loop on the map yet 
its here  but its new  she
made it earlier this year 
its my year 
if we don t get out before it closes 
we re stuck in january 2016 
great  so time catches up with all of us 
we all die except you 
plan  loop closes at 4 30 
i mean  we need to get in  rescue
the ymbrynes    and get out 
if we re not dead already 
miss  avocet said the machine is in the
cellar of the blackpool tower building 
that means we ll be
indoors with hollows 
no    we wont  i ve got a plan 
but i m going to need your help 
  this can t be it  can it 
  loop entrances can be anywhere 
the one in london is in a subway tunnel 
  sure  this is it 
  i think so
miller  there s something
i need you to do first 
alright  i know 
look  there s the tower 
its not far 
easy for you say  i m freezing 
ready 
all the doors to the cellar are locked 
the only way to reach the ymbrines is   
  thats backstage 
  how many hollows can you see 
four  its good news 
i think you and i have a very
different definition of good news 
it means barron s other friends
haven t arrived yet   
means they haven t started the experiment 
we re not too late 
ok emma  you ready 
you know what to say 
hey  jake 
our brethren should be
joining us momentarily 
this is a day   
hey  you down there 
we killed your hollow
friend mr  barron
and now we ve come for
miss  peregrinee 
bring her and all the other
ymbrines to the end of the pier
in five minutes    or
face the consequences 
these children must be as
insane as their headmistress
still    the hollows
will be glad of a feed 
where are you 
i know you re in here somewhere 
ah    good     listen to me 
i want you to follow
mr  archer   
and mr  clark 
they are going to take you down to
the pier for a little afternoon tea 
mr  archer  mr  clark 
gather the hollows and
take them to the pier 
those children killed malphus 
barron has had it for malphus
since he killed abe portman 
thats abe portman for months 
all i needed was a few minutes
to get the location of miss 
peregrine s loop from him 
but no 
malphus couldn t
wait and instead
i had to masquerade as
a psychiatrist for three weeks in florida 
have you ever been to florida 
did i not tell you to
gather the hollows 
what if it s a trap 
of course it is miss  edwards 
but what of it 
a couple of children against four hollows 
lets get this over with 
jake  i m atuck 
hurry up 
they are coming 
enoch now 
go now 
can be seen now 
emma  go 
don t just stand there 
get them 
alright  good job guys 
time for step 2 
save the ms  peregrine 
that s    sort of step 3 
first we ve got to deal with barron 
  they should ve been back by now 
  i said it was a trap 
if thats true  perhaps we
should move the ymbrynes now 
you are not serious 
do i not look serious  do i
not look like a man who has
trudged the globe looking
for just one more eye to eat
in hopes of regaining   
sufficient humanity to
return to his research 
a man who spent years   
hunting ymbrynes in
preparation for this night 
and 2    no  
3 days in wales   
pretending to look at birds 
i assure you i ll will not stand idly by 
to see my destiny derailed 
hugh  do it now 
come back here  get them 
low  get down 
you think you can
stand in my way 
you jake 
content to age and die as if you had
not the gift of peculiarity  at all 
i am a higher being 
i hold a secret to eternal life 
  sorry to interrupt 
  what the    
bronwyn 
you missed me again  jake 
i take it  accuracy is
not you peculiarity 
abe was a much worthier adversary 
don t let him get to the birds 
you must put me in contact
with your tailor 
ymbrynes    ymbrynes  here i come 
cold  wait till the blood
freezes in your veins 
that was your attempt to
rescue your friend  was it 
jake 
i ll hold him as long as i can
when are you going to realise you
are a terrible shot with that thing 
get the others 
i ll meet you at the 
loop entrance 
he s getting out 
eventually you re going
to run out of breath
and it ll all be over 
death for your beloved jake
and miss megan peregrinee   
and everlasting life for me 
olive  olive 
i m so sorry  olive 
all these years i never
appreciated you 
i didn t see how lucky i was 
i got so used to having you
there  i never realized 
you never realised  what 
find your children 
create new loops 
so jake 
i see you ve inherited your
grandfather s peculiarity 
you re just as
annoying as he was 
speaking of abe  if you should
see him in the afterlife 
give him my regards 
please  we can t risk
him taking you again 
enoch  where are the others 
there safe  olive is leading
them back to the ghost ship 
jake needs us 
barron s too strong 
you ve lost miss  peregrine 
you ve lost everything 
its over 
jake 
jake 
jake 
emma  wait  thats not me  it is barron 
don t listen to him  he is barron 
i m jake  that s barron 
well i got better shot than jake 
so neither of you move till we sort this 
listen to me  i m jake 
i grew up in florida and i
wanted to be an explorer 
i never thought nothing would ever
change because i was ordinary 
thats jake get barron 
wait  i told him all this 
she was my psychiatrist 
you deal with him 
i ll go find miss  peregrinee 
wait  i can prove that i m me 
because i am not ordinary
i can do something that no one else can
i can see the monsters 
wait  it s me 
enoch 
we need to go 
the loop is closing 
yeah 
those of us who are leaving 
emma   
you love your grandfather 
there s nothing more to explain 
no  i promised miss peregrine
that i d look after you all
and with her injured and
you without a loop   
she ll recover and until
then we ll be in 1943 
we ll only age one day at a time 
like normal people 
  which can be no bad thing 
  and what about the hollows 
as long as they are out
there  you are not safe 
we don t need you to
make us feel safe  jake 
because you made us feel brave 
and thats even better 
cmon guys  lets go 
and then we said goodbye and loop closed 
i was so scared that you wouldn t be here 
i d never see you again 
i am safe 
let me give you your birthday present 
grandpa  my birthday isn t for months 
for your travels  go to her 
jake 
you have the map 
you can go back to 1943 
even so  they took a boat 
i don t know where they are 
but you know where they were 
you have no idea how long
it took me to get here 
the closest loop was in
the california desert 
i used it to get
to the tokyo loop 
that led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942 
where i wound up joining the navy
