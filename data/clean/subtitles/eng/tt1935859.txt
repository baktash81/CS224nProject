nothing you do matters
you leave footprints on the
beach and somehow they are gone
like its just today over again
they say that your teen years are
for making friends and having fun
which made me feel even worse
hey amy its jake im
in your math class
hey do not forget your adult diapers
yeah right
jake

but that day everything changed
thanks for the ride shelly
how come you have to go
deal with your grandpa

im just gonna call grandpa

your pills today

september 3rd 1943
its okay just
just dont move
theres an ambulance coming
i know you think im crazy
but the bird will
explain everything
will you do this tegrisco
promise me
i promise yes
i thought i could protect you
i should have told you years ago
grandpa tell me
tell me what
grandpa
shelly behind you
there was no one there
may i say jake
that considering this
was only a month ago
i think youre doing
exceptionally well
apart from being crazy
having nightmares and anxiety
doesnt make you crazy
and what about seeing
things which arent there
actually in dramatic situations
its not at all uncommon
your subconscious mind draws
an image from a movie or
it was a story
my grandpa told me
stories when i was a kid
about monsters that
he fought in the war
so there you go
he was brutally attacked
and in your head the man
who did it was inhuman
a monster
it wasnt a man though
the cops said that dogs
scratched up the screen door
and he chased them
off into the woods
and the coroner said
he had a heart attack
and the cops said
dogs went for the soft parts
the dna had wounds of animals
so thats case closed
he sounds like an
extraordinary gentleman
were you very close
puerto rico
here
there is a lake where the
water glows in the dark
and a secret tunnel thats
where i hid from the monsters
he used to babysit me a lot
and when i was with
him i felt special
abe
its like 11 oclock
what is he doing up
im going to be an explorer
grandpas told me about
my first voyage
everything has already
been discovered buddy
pay no attention to your father
he knows bubkiss
come tegrisco off to bed
can you tell me a story
the usual
okay
once upon a time there
was a little boy
wheres the pictures
pictures
once upon a time a
little boy called abe
that was you
that was me and he lived
in a lovely childrens home on
an little island near wales
where the sun shone every day
the headmistress
miss peregrine
was very clever
and she smoked my pipe
she could turn into a bird
it was a home for special children
like bronwyn
and victor
they were both as
strong as ten men
and hugh
hugh had bees living inside him
where is emma she could float
she was lighter than air
she had to wear special
shoes made of lead
to keep her from floating away
where is she now
shes still on the island i believe
my mom and papa sent me there
to live with the
special children
and now tegrisco time to sleep
he used to call me tegrisco
its polish for little tiger
couldnt have picked a
less appropriate nickname
i was always a chicken
why your mom and
dad send you away
where we lived in poland
it was not safe
there were monsters
what kind of monsters
huge ones
with long arms and no eyes
and tentacles like this
the dumb thing was for years i
actually believed his stories
this is millard hes invisible
my teacher says they
are trick photos
and did you believe her
dad says that you get in one of those
places that you were traveling
i would never lie to you tegrisco
but you did it
about the home the monsters
dad told me
your father knows very well that i
went to live in the childrens home
he said there were
monsters in poland
just not the kind with tentacles
he said you got sent away to wales
because there were bad people
people who wanted to kill
anyone who was different
i do not want to talk
about this anymore
he said children were special
but not the way you said
you find something good
aw look at that
its awesome
take that
cmon buddy lets roll
how are you so okay
jake you were a lot closer
to him than i ever was
he was a wonderful grandpa but not
not such a great dad you know
never seemed to pick a
job that didnt involve
late nights and long
trips away though
me and aunt sussie i always kinda thought
he was maybe cheating on our mom
i am sorry buddy i know how much
you worshipped him but there it is
surprise
happy birthday cousin jake
jake its great youve to come
to spend the summer with us
wait till you see the new dogs
cant wait
its aunt sussie
thought you might want
to open this one
its from your grandpa
found it while i was packing up i figured
he meant to give it to you someday
thanks
complete essays and other
writings of ralph waldo emerson
to jake and the worlds
he has yet to discover
my dearest abe
i hope this card finds you well
the children and i yearn
to hear your news
i do hope you will
visit us again soon
we should so love to see you
with admiration alma peregrine
hmm only two years ago
i suppose its possible she
could still be still be alive
right
and i could meet her
maybe even find out what it was
grandpa wanted me to know
but what if shes dead
dr golan we are very concerned
with jakes state of mind right now
and there is no way im putting my
life on hold to take you to wales
dad could take me
and he can even look at birds
work in his book
it means you get a break
and as dr golan said
maybe i can move on
like closure
having an opportunity to
see this childrens home
and separate fantasy
from reality
may be useful and at the very least a
trip like this provides a chance to
say goodbye
cairnholm population of 92
best known for its proximity to the
final resting place of the cruise liner
augusta which sank in 1915
there is only one hotel
thats us
i hope theres bourbon

the tale of turning into a bird thing
maybe maybe thats really her

home by myself
and you can really
take your time
and i enjoy it
come on jakey you know
your mom would freak
what if we can find
someone to take me
hey dudes
dad i got this
i was just wondering if any of you guys
might be interested in taking my son here
to the other side of the island
and what are your names
i am worm and this
is epsy denty
epsy bussines
i thought you changed that
no
no you did remember
when lou said epsy bussines made
it look like cracked trousers
yeah but she said it sounded
like a personal hygiene problem
wait are these are
like nicknames or
stage names of rappers
here in wales
come on worm show
this shank how its done
what now
i like to throw letters
in the churches
my father is always

well get there quicker

a lost shoe boy
the childrens home
what happened to it
the german navy a bomb
fell right on the roof
september the 3rd 1943
where where did
they go after it
the headmistress
and the children
not one survivor
poor little buggers and
they were lovely too
why didnt he tell us
that they all died
he leaves to join the army and three
months everyone he knows gets killed
not even grandpa can turn
that into a bedtime story
no wonder he was
scared at being a dad
being close to anyone
listen
if you need to talk about all
this with someone buddy
we should call dr golan
do you mind if i go hang out
with those other kids today
they asked
yeah thats awesome
abe

and the twins
and olive
bromwin
hes miller

i mean he is he is
invisible hes still dead
none of us are dead
oh my god am i dead
no
you called me abe in the house
why
you look like him
just for a moment
before you started screaming running
away and concussing yourself
wait whats happening
we are waiting until the coast is
clear before we go into the loop
you never know who
might be watching
wait before we
before we go into what
please jake
ms peregrines waiting

maybe hes army
bollocks listen to his accent
its terrible
he is a spy
what
no im not im a tourist
i say we should get
the truth out of him
the oldfashioned way
come on quick guys
i cant believe youre real
youre all real
weve been trying to tell you
but i am special too
what
in the pub all of you saw it
right
everything was flying and breaking
and that was me
i was doing it with my mind
no that was me
miller yeah
are you naked yeah
a bomb drops on you in 1943
it is 1943
september the 3rd 1943
the whole day every day
its our loop
right on time
ms peregrine
delighted to meet you
i do hope im not going
to have the pub landlord
knocking on my door
with the police again
ive had to kill them
twice this month
its been terribly inconvenient
we may have broken some
things thats all
and olive may have
started a tiny fire
but they were going
to hurt jake
look at you
the last time dear abe sent me a
photograph you were a just a tiny todd
dont you stand there come in
your tea is getting cold
how did you know about the pub
your weigh approximately
a 109 pounds correct
bronwyn and the twins returned
six minutes after you ran away
i think im missing something
and quite apart from the fact that the
perceived safety of the pub makes it
the most likely place to
which you would flee
it would take you 18
minutes to run there
emma and miller would
have been moments behind
with the horse and trap traveling
at around 82 miles per hour
fact doing some sort of
kerfuffle in the pub
and the return journey
with your added weight
you would arrive here
with 30 minutes past 4
now then do you like sugar
that will be enough thank you olive
nobody enjoys over boiled tea
let me help you enoch
do not bother
wouldnt want you to
interrupt the tea party
im so sorry for
your loss jake
you know then
i know if abe were alive
you would have told
me you were coming
shall we take our tea outside
before he died he
told me to find you
there was something
he wanted me to know
he said you could
explain everything
thats absolutely true but there
are few things i cant explain
we are in common
parlance  as peculiar
51 seconds late fiona
sorry ms peregrine
how many carrots you
need for supper
just one will do
as i was saying some
people are peculiar
its a recessive gene carried
down through families
yet many generations can pass
without a peculiar child being born
and alas peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages
hence we live in places like this
in wales
anywhere will do if you
pick the right day
thats fine now fiona
you see i am a type of peculiar
called an ymbryne that means i can
you can turn into a bird
well i do but thats
not very useful
an ymbrynes main skill is
the manipulation of time
we chose a safe place a
safe day and create a loop
what do you mean
a loop preserves
the last 24 hours
reset the loop and the day
is yours to live in again
reset it daily and you
can stay there forever
entirely safe from
the outside world
right on time
bronwyn good girl
and thats why we ymbrynes are
charged with the care of the young
and no one ever gets older
its best for everyone this way
i assure you
each ymbryne commits herself to the
creation and upkeep of a place like this
a home for peculiar children
youve met the twins
this is claire
miller youve met
and thats hugh
stop cheating hugh
miller thats a foul again
no it wasnt
if you two cant play without squabbling
wish you wouldnt play at all
look who our referee is
good afternoon im horace
delighted to meet you
we sorely needed some new blood here
super shirt by the way
thanks
you know emma of course
and i think thats everyone
didnt bronwyn have a brother
yes victors upstairs
wait where did
enoch and olive go
heaven knows
enochs been off ever since
we went to look for jake
ms peregrine theres a
policemen at the door
he says its about the pub
we discuss this later emma
it wasnt their fault
honestly just they were
just trying to help
thanks youre not
as vet as i thought
shes not really going
to kill anyone is she
not if she can talk
her way out of it
would you help me
with something
enoch usually does it but like i
said he is sulking somewhere
is that because of me
he is possessive
so what you need help with
one of my daily chores
put the baby squirrel
back in the tree
what baby squirrel
that happens every day
like clockwork
now would you mind tying
that rope around my waist
uh yeah
right promise to hold on tight
i knew we messed that up
abe did too the first time
this used to be his job
emma i need to tell you something
he is dead
i know ms peregrine guessed
and shes always right
its okay
i said goodbye to him
a long time ago
were you close
i thought we were
for a while
but i suppose not
can i ask was he like you
he was like you jake
i need to go change for supper
will you be dining with us
i cant stay out late
suppers at 530
well thats pretty early
the fact we are not all eight years of
olds seems to have eluded ms peregrine
you can borrow some of abes clothes
his rooms in the attic
jake
come meet enoch properly
well you must feel pretty out of place
dont worry i am used to it
i wasnt worried some
advice for you though
man to man
if you think youre staying
just because you like emma
dont bother
you see she swore off romance years
ago when she got her heart broken
and shes never gonna
change her mind
enoch i wasnt
what are you doing
isnt he amazing
what did you do
this
jake this is not even the fun part
do you want to see the fun part
they are like puppets
just do anything i tell them
it is even more fun with people
you should have seen some of the
epic battles i used to have
at my parents funeral parlour
you need a necktie
so what did my grandpa
do when he was traveling
visited other loops
really
to do what
jake there are some questions
i cant answer alright
so it will be a lot easier for me
if you just stopped asking them
hey what are you doing
miller go and put
some clothes on
polite persons do not
take the sup in the nude
alright
you can sit here jake
look at enoch hes jealous
why would i be jealous
all of you can go marry
jake for all i care
do not be mean enoch
she doesnt want to
shes just excited
to have a visitor
nobody is marrying anybody
now eat up your food
before it gets cold
hugh
wheres your net
it must be very
strange for you jake
to meet your
grandfathers friends
visiting another century
there spaceships in
your time jake
like the flash gordon books
now now olive what did i
say about the questions
we dont discuss the future here
we enjoy living in
the here and now
claire why arent you eating
shes embarrassed
in front of jake
dont be please
so jake what is your peculiarity
oh im im not peculiar
and that my friends is why
hell not be staying with us
no matter how hard we
try to persuade him
weve spoken about this
jake is just visiting
do you not want to stay jake
tonight or
forever you should stay forever
why would he if he doesnt have to
he can live out there grow older
and have a good time instead
and leave just like his grandfather did
emma
excuse me where shes going
that wasnt nice enoch
you know perfectly
well why abe left us
to join the army
and then he met a lady
and had a nice wedding cake
and a lovely little baby
children
i know youd all like a new friend
but im sure jake has plenty
of his own back in florida
i think you should all get ready for
movietime while i answer that
but you always let us stay for it
hi this is abe
how is everyone
yours has extra marshmallows jake
miller put some pajamas on
it is very hot in here
stop moaning excuse me
my grandpa told me about this
horace projects his dreams right
he used to listen to the radio
gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart
splendid ill take it
it sounds about clothes mostly
delighted to meet you
super shirt by the way
when did he dream this
last night
some of his dreams are prophetic
but mostly they are about clothes
prophetic as in he can
see into the future
the ymbryne who is she
mrs peregrine you know her
dont be silly horace was just
having a bad dream thats all
thats quite enough
thank you horace
i think probably get going
you could stay the night if you wanted to
rather than walk home in the dark
but the island is very safe isnt it
of course
i only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy
jake could trip
perhaps you could show
him the shortcuts
should he ever need to avoid
bumps
wont you stay to see the restart
it is really quite spectacular
what was that
it was my phone
its been dead the whole time
in the loop i guess now
your phone
yeah i dont like it a telephone
you can call people
and send written messages
right youll love this
you can take a picture
press that there yeah
see
whats wrong
its just funny to think that one
day youll grow up like abe did
get married have children
grandchildren
you might even show
them this photograph
and ill still be here
wha can you leave some day
and live in the present
if you wanted to
no more than a few minutes in your
time and the years would catch up
youd age
would youre
i think it is the ymbryne
from horaces dream
are you sure its not just a bird
i mean i dont know
wouldnt it change
she cant not if shes hurt
i need to take her inside
you should go
please do not say anything else
i hate goodbyes
ill come back tomorrow
theres no hurry
ill be here forever
hey
have i been all this damn
island where the hell were you
i was just on my way back
sorry i lost track of time
i was having a blast with worm
and dirty d
dirty d
you know what this is
this is good

youre making real friends
doing teenage stuff
i think this is normal i am sure
that dr golan will approve
hey you american

hey look here there they are
theres dbag and wormman
did you do this
what no
of course not
it wasnt us
listen sir i dont know what happened
here but my son and his friends

would never do anything like this
bollocks we havent seen him
you paid us yesterday why would we
hang out with him today for free
jake were you with them or not
no im sorry
and you dont seriously
think i could do this
i think were done here sir
well can pass on a message for me

hadnt encouraged this cockamamie trip
maybe my son wouldnt be mopping
around all day in a derelict house
having a goddamn breakdown
hello
dad im not
im fine
youre not
you are not fine jake
coming here was a terrible
terrible idea
im sorry i lied
set your alarm for 800 am
i want to get to the beach early
the rest of the time left on this
crapoisland were sticking together
where are you going
downstairs for a drink
dearest peregrine
i dont wish to alarm you
but one of my informants sent me this
it would appear that some of mr barrons
group were in black pool england
if i recall ms avocet has a loop there
please warn her and suggest that
she make a new one right away
well hidden
and take the greatest care yourself
with love abe january 2016
who is ready to hit the beach
oh my goodness
unbelievable
im right in the middle
of a nesting are
what kind of idiot does that
actually the main nesting
area is over there
i can show you if you like
its marvelous to meet
a fellow birdspotter
john lamont franklyn portman
this is my son jake
john newmont
thats a hell of a camera you got there
oh thank you is absolutely fantastic
i am here to do some snaps
for a book im writing
so you gentlemen are
here on holiday
so you are not coming
to the beach today
whats the point
that guys gonna cover
on some big glossy book
no ones even wanna look at mine
i might just have a nice afternoon nap
i dont suppose you saw uncle oggie
on you travels this morning did you
hes usually here by now
i could go look for him
youre not going anywhere
jake youre back come and play
i need to see to ms peregrine first
do you know where she is
jake youre back
how wonderful
hows it doing
emma said it was an ymbryne
she not it ymbrynes
are always female
and emma was quite correct
this is ms avocet
her loop is in black pool england
that was a private letter jake
who is mr barron
ms peregrine if my grandpa was
involved with dangerous people
i need to tell the police
to the police
are you implying abe
died an unnatural death
i found him in the woods
with eyes missing
id say that was pretty unnatural
unless essential i dont
discuss unpleasant matters
an ymbrynes is a duty to
protect children jake
i am not a child
he wanted you to tell me everything
oh how frustrating for you
between ms peregrine rules and
my  not to scare you off
its like no ones telling you anything
so why dont you then
its not like you want me here
enoch you cant
you promised
olive is right
however i know someone
who can break the rules
want to meet him
enoch do not do this please
you didnt want us to spend time together
thats what you said
well here we all are
move olive
if youre going to be like then i
do not want to be your friend
enoch leave victor alone
it really upsets bromwyn
stop fussing fiona dont you
think jake should meet everybody
hes trying to frighten
you away jake
he was always jealous of abe
and now hes jealous of you
come and play with us instead
id quite like to meet victor
after you
hello victor
im jake im sorry to disturb
he cant hear you
hello jake im victor do you
want to know what killed me
ah there you are
is he not with you
its time for our daily walk
emma who killed victor was it
the people with the white eyes
i asked you not to ask questions
i saw one the night my grandpa died
if it really was one you
have to tell ms peregrinee
could you recognize you recognize
him from a photograph
do you have one
then come on
theres somewhere i go to be alone
i have things there
is this the place
no this is how we get there
emma your shoes lead shoes
welcome to my secret hideout
how how did you
air my peculiarity
it does what i want
jake before your grandfather retired
he asked me to keep this safe
this is my grandpas old map
it shows you where the loops are
thats him thats the man i saw
who is he
thats barron he is the leader
leader of what
who are these people
bad people bad peculiars
abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down
these are the ones
he never found
what do you mean hunting
they raided homes whole homes
full of children left for dead
abe took lives
to save lifes
he only retired when you
were born to protect you
from what
if i tell you the rest you have
to promise not to run away
jake you belong here
you know that i dont
im not like you
im just ordinary
no but youre not
jake only a peculiar can
enter a time loop
no that cant be right
i mean i would know
fine
then ill show you
something else
hurry youll miss it
ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect date to create a loop
but ms peregrinee
had to make this one in a rush
why
because the germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house
the point is september
the 3rd 1943
wasnt perfect
the thing that killed
victor came back
wait watch out
shhh all bets are off
you can see it cant you
no one else can
its invisible jake that was
abes greatest gift of all
he could see the monsters
we call them hollowgasts
hollows for short
my grandpa told me about people
who turn into monsters
is that what they are
i will explain everything jake
i fear its my duty
now considering
but you should know
that in doing so
im breaking a solemn promise
i knew you were peculiar
when you were born
but your grandfather
forbid me to tell you anything
his dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood
well i definitely had that
he intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18
he hoped his bedtime
stories would pave the way
heres my book
many years ago
a splinter faction emerged
among our people
disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops
thats mr barron
he believed that by harnessing the
essence of an ymbrynes powers
he and his cronies
could gain immortality and be
able to live outside loops
he devised an experiment
he kidnapped an ymbryne
not knowing or caring whether she
would survive the experiment
but the fate of barron and his
group was more horrifying still
why didnt barron turn into one
he did but years later he found a way to
reverse the effects to regain humanity
they had become not immortal
gods  but hollows
invisible beasts dangerous
coldblooded deadly
remember i told you they raided loops
this is why
barron discovered that by consuming
the eyes of other peculiars
especially children
he began to change
consume enough and a hollow can
fully regain its human form
just as barron and some
of his friends did
the rest of them are
stuck as hollows
are you saying that
barron ate my uncles
he needs no more eyes himself
but i fear he led a hollow
to your grandfather yes
after the first
attacks on loops
we all got better at hiding
making new loops keeping our
whereabouts secret
the hollows grew more
desperate every year
and barron wishes to
help his friends
miss peregrine come quickly
miss avocets awake
oh miss peregrine they
found my new loop
the children i tried to save them
but there were so many hollows
i dont know how i escaped
you are safe now
none of us are safe
they set up the
machine in my loop
they put in in the cellar
at blackboat tower
theyre still there
the machine
the experiment
they intend to do it again
this time hes using
more ymbrynes
he still wants to be immortal
do hollows only
attack peculiars
of course not theyre
monsters jake
theyll slaughter
anything in their path
well some sheep on the
island were killed
you dont think theyre
here already do you
have you seen anyone
with white eyes
im sorry children
we cant remain here
what
we leave on the first ferry
off the island tomorrow
pack anything of importance
ill make sandwiches
and lead you to bed
are we leaving for good
when are we coming back
never if ms peregrines not here
to reset the loop tomorrow night
the house gets bombed
what our house
dont cry miss peregrine will find you
another lovely house somewhere else
once this loop closes thats it
i cant get back to my own time
you didnt seem
very happy there
i cant just leave
i have a family
and you felt ordinary like
nothing you do changes anything
and now you have a chance to do
something that changes everything
jake were in danger
and youre the only one
who can see the hollows
yeah i see them sure
but im not my grandpa
im not and ii
cant fight i cant kill somebody
theres only one reason
that id stay here
please just go
jake jake here you are
thank god
when i heard they found
a body i freaked
are there stray dogs around here
what are you talking about
its like
when they find an injured animal
they go for the soft parts first
same thing happened
to my father
the police are on their way
dad i gotta go
no you dont jake
if this wasnt an accident
theres a lunatic on the island
ive known everyone on this island
my whole life except you and him
and hes been in the
pub all afternoon
so have i i was sleeping
what about the blind fellow
i mean
i assumed he was blind
the gentleman with the dark glasses
arrived on the same ferry as me
i kept seeing him around
jake jake
is your son alright
no he has mental health issues
i cant
let me i run 5 ks all the time
hello
hello is that you young man
you came through
youre a peculiar
oh yes and im extremely
grateful to you
its terribly hard to
find loops these days
so you followed me from
the beach on purpose
oh no ive been following
you much further than that
dr golan
sometimes when it suits me
the breadth of
my peculiarity is purely
limited by my imagination
the only thing i cant change
is my eyes
mr barron how do you do
i saw you at your grandfathers
i was hoping to get
ms peregrines address
from him but alas
my traveling companion got
to him before i did
and as you know theres no
stopping a hungry hollowgasts
speaking of my traveling companion
hes coming
and believe me when i say to you
you dont want to be here
when he arrives
so lets be on your way
shall we
i mustnt forget our calendar
could you fetch it from the
parlor please miss avocet
go and help the others
miss peregrinee what a
pleasure to meet you at last
may we come in
children would you make your
way down the stairs please
i give the orders in
this house mr baron
not today
you should know that jake
has served his purpose
if you value his life
i suggest everyone does as
they are told children
shush no one tells my
children what to do
children come down here please
ms peregrine
i thought i told you to be quiet
children for jakes safety we are
going to do what mr barron asks
he wishes to take me with him
to his rendezvous in blackpool
so for his protection he would
like me to assume birdform
preferably caged
and hed like you to make your way into
a lockable room such as the parlor
as he wont release jake
if he fears an attack could be mounted
upon him once he loses his leverage
correct mr barron
you are sacrificing yourself
and all of us for jake
mr barron travels
with a hollow enoch
once it arrives here
were all dead
enoch only jake can see them
she means hes our only hope
its been my privilege
to care for you all
goodbye my children
now let him go
promise me one thing jake
that you will try to
look after them all
i promise
its getting dark you wont even
be able to see their shadows
we have to stay inside its the
only place we stand a chance
hes quite right
now where does miss
peregrine keep her weapon
now all right children
make sure all the doors are locked
and the windows are latched
everything must be sealed up tight
now quickly quickly go
jake i think tonight
you better answer that
hello
you you dont know me
im jake
ah youre new well
welcome to the family jake
now i cant talk long
so just tell miss peregrine that
im at the airbase and im fine
i just wanted to say
that i miss you
and if i disappointed
you im sorry
and youre the best
grandpa in the world
fiona
got it
miss avocet now children now that
you are all here theres a few rules
your primary job is to stay safe
leave the hollow to me
i dont want to see any heroics
now those of you with garden tools
i must insist that you
no enoch get back
go get to the attic
take her
go go get out all come on
alright crap its almost reset
fiona is there anything you can do
with that tree
be careful
were going through the windows
lets go
come on
claire come on down
go fiona
lets move on
what was that
the loop closing it is gone
im sorry jake
what do we do now
is there any sign of barron
and miss peregrinee
gone barron must have had a boat
well we have to go after them
we know he is taking her to blackpool
but blackpool is miles
away and the next ferry
doesnt go for hours
well never make it in time
not unless we go by boat too
so theres a loop here in blackpool
its only six months old
january 11th 2016
with miss avocet gone
it cant be reset
wont the loop closes
then its back to real time
jake you know what
this means dont you
youre going to die
thats not what i mean
we have to get to our own time
but you dont
you can continue
to live in 2016
but why would i do that
if we kill barron
hell be gone but time will carry on
he wont go to florida
abe wont die and
you can go home
i can see my grandpa
listen i can explain
everything to them
i can persuade them to
take me to the island
will you still there
our old loops gone for good
we wouldnt see
each other again
i thought you wanted me to stay
i know youll choose abe
if i minded i wouldnt have told you
so we found miss avocets
loop on the map yet
its here but its new she
made it earlier this year
its my year
if we dont get out before it closes
were stuck in january 2016
great so time catches up with all of us
we all die except you
plan loop closes at 430
i mean we need to get in rescue
the ymbrynes and get out
if were not dead already
miss avocet said the machine is in the
cellar of the blackpool tower building
that means well be
indoors with hollows
no we wont ive got a plan
but im going to need your help
this cant be it can it
loop entrances can be anywhere
the one in london is in a subway tunnel
sure this is it
i think so
miller theres something
i need you to do first
alright i know
look theres the tower
its not far
easy for you say im freezing
ready
all the doors to the cellar are locked
the only way to reach the ymbrines is
thats backstage
how many hollows can you see
four its good news
i think you and i have a very
different definition of good news
it means barrons other friends
havent arrived yet
means they havent started the experiment
were not too late
ok emma you ready
you know what to say
hey jake
our brethren should be
joining us momentarily
this is a day
hey you down there
we killed your hollow
friend mr barron
and now weve come for
miss peregrinee
bring her and all the other
ymbrines to the end of the pier
in five minutes or
face the consequences
these children must be as
insane as their headmistress
still the hollows
will be glad of a feed
where are you
i know youre in here somewhere
ah good listen to me
i want you to follow
mr archer
and mr clark
they are going to take you down to
the pier for a little afternoon tea
mr archer mr clark
gather the hollows and
take them to the pier
those children killed malphus
barron has had it for malphus
since he killed abe portman
thats abe portman for months
all i needed was a few minutes
to get the location of miss
peregrines loop from him
but no
malphus couldnt
wait and instead
i had to masquerade as
a psychiatrist for three weeks in florida
have you ever been to florida
did i not tell you to
gather the hollows
what if its a trap
of course it is miss edwards
but what of it
a couple of children against four hollows
lets get this over with
jake im atuck
hurry up
they are coming
enoch now
go now
can be seen now
emma go
dont just stand there
get them
alright good job guys
time for step 2
save the ms peregrine
thats sort of step 3
first weve got to deal with barron
they shouldve been back by now
i said it was a trap
if thats true perhaps we
should move the ymbrynes now
you are not serious
do i not look serious do i
not look like a man who has
trudged the globe looking
for just one more eye to eat
in hopes of regaining
sufficient humanity to
return to his research
a man who spent years
hunting ymbrynes in
preparation for this night
and 2 no
3 days in wales
pretending to look at birds
i assure you ill will not stand idly by
to see my destiny derailed
hugh do it now
come back here get them
low get down
you think you can
stand in my way
you jake
content to age and die as if you had
not the gift of peculiarity at all
i am a higher being
i hold a secret to eternal life
sorry to interrupt
what the
bronwyn
you missed me again jake
i take it accuracy is
not you peculiarity
abe was a much worthier adversary
dont let him get to the birds
you must put me in contact
with your tailor
ymbrynes ymbrynes here i come
cold wait till the blood
freezes in your veins
that was your attempt to
rescue your friend was it
jake
ill hold him as long as i can
when are you going to realise you
are a terrible shot with that thing
get the others
ill meet you at the
loop entrance
hes getting out
eventually youre going
to run out of breath
and itll all be over
death for your beloved jake
and miss megan peregrinee
and everlasting life for me
olive olive
im so sorry olive
all these years i never
appreciated you
i didnt see how lucky i was
i got so used to having you
there i never realized
you never realised what
find your children
create new loops
so jake
i see youve inherited your
grandfathers peculiarity
youre just as
annoying as he was
speaking of abe if you should
see him in the afterlife
give him my regards
please we cant risk
him taking you again
enoch where are the others
there safe olive is leading
them back to the ghost ship
jake needs us
barrons too strong
youve lost miss peregrine
youve lost everything
its over
jake
jake
jake
emma wait thats not me it is barron
dont listen to him he is barron
im jake thats barron
well i got better shot than jake
so neither of you move till we sort this
listen to me im jake
i grew up in florida and i
wanted to be an explorer
i never thought nothing would ever
change because i was ordinary
thats jake get barron
wait i told him all this
she was my psychiatrist
you deal with him
ill go find miss peregrinee
wait i can prove that im me
because i am not ordinary
i can do something that no one else can
i can see the monsters
wait its me
enoch
we need to go
the loop is closing
yeah
those of us who are leaving
emma
you love your grandfather
theres nothing more to explain
no i promised miss peregrine
that id look after you all
and with her injured and
you without a loop
shell recover and until
then well be in 1943
well only age one day at a time
like normal people
which can be no bad thing
and what about the hollows
as long as they are out
there you are not safe
we dont need you to
make us feel safe jake
because you made us feel brave
and thats even better
cmon guys lets go
and then we said goodbye and loop closed
i was so scared that you wouldnt be here
id never see you again
i am safe
let me give you your birthday present
grandpa my birthday isnt for months
for your travels go to her
jake
you have the map
you can go back to 1943
even so they took a boat
i dont know where they are
but you know where they were
you have no idea how long
it took me to get here
the closest loop was in
the california desert
i used it to get
to the tokyo loop
that led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942
where i wound up joining the navy
