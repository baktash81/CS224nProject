do you think it ll happen now 
i must pay for what mr  brilliant did 
  it s over  kids  okay 
  mitchell is the man 
and  the man  calls all the shots

when i call mitchell 
he s gonna call the cops 
  so you can leave if you want 
  i am not leaving  joe 
you know when my old man
used to drink   
which was often   
he used to say to me 
 you will never amount to anything  
don t give up 
you re 21  lucas 
i m not 
it s too late 
put the glue in like this 
pop that sucker down right on top of it 
and then flip the   
hey  man  what are you doing 
don t get your thumbprints all over it 
look  there s thumbprints there now 
wanna wreck the whole record  dude 
you re crazy  man 
hey  mark 
you love gwar 
why don t you join the band 
mark  man  you play a mean guitar 
it s really a shame that you must die 
wait  hey  come on 
i love you  eddie 
do you need a new night manager 
  what are you doing later 
  i don t know 
i m either going to jail or hell 
i can t decide which 
wherever you re going 
would you have dinner with me first 
you bet 
 rest in peace  deb  
death is in the cards  huh 
lucas  why did you take that money 
do you have a plan 
no 
not a comprehensive plan 
i think you do 
a funeral 
  i am not going 
  you don t have a choice  if you re dead 
  what s rip mean 
  really idiotic party 
hey  man  there s your problem 
  somebody burned it 
  no 
if you were listening to records
and somebody burned it   
or put water on it or something 
it wouldn t wreck  em  just warp  em a bit 
sometimes that makes them
even sound better 
the only thing that can destroy records
is some freak who kicks  em   
  and throws  em on the ground 
  it s only  cause i m not in a band  right 
because you know if i was in a band
they would not be doing this to me 
if you didn t listen to cds 
  clapton on vinyl 
  could you be a bit more vague  man 
we got lots of clapton on vinyl  we got
clapton with john mayall  with yardbirds 
clapton with derek   the dominoes 
clapton with blind faith 
the rainbow concert from  73 
do you want him solo  unplugged 
you want him with cream 
  you wanted the tapes with jimmy page 
  cool 
  where is it 
  over there  man 
hey  eddie  do you have the shaggs
on 45  philosophy of the world 
i know that you have the album 
but i m looking for the 45   
  deb   
  did you know that their second album   
got stolen from
their family s trailer home   
  deb  can i see it 
  never found it again  i wonder what   
please 
shaggs are definitely
the hottest punk rock band 
i love radicals 
got it 
hey  eddie  would you play it for me 
yeah  no problem  i ll do anything for you 
we are gathered here today
to pay our last respects to debra 
she left us and never said why 
but i am really going to miss her 
and i wish that i could have known her
a little bit better 
  dogshit 
  hey  dead people don t talk 
  berko  would you like to say something 
  deb  i just   
i just want you to stay  that s all 
a j   do you have something to say 
well  is it better to know or not to know

supposed to be talking about me 
i know  i just can t stop
thinking about her 
she s not afraid of life 
and she s not afraid to be herself 
and i wish that i could be like that 
i wish i could be brave like gina 
you are brave 
you re getting out of here 
you re always talking about
how i do what i want to do   
but i don t 
i don t  because i want to sing in a band   
but i don t have the guts to even audition 
and i know that if i don t do something 
i m going to end up like my mother 
her life ended after high school 
you re never going to be like your mother
if you don t want to be like her 
you re going to be fine 
that is so sweet  i think i m going to barf 
excuse me 
  get down here 
  here 
hi  mark 
i used to pee in my bed 
i did  i wet my bed until i was 10 
my mother turned me over to the county   
when i was 10  too 
not for being a bed wetter 
but for being a bad seed 
anyway  three years went by   
and then joe came 
he took me out  and i became   
the person that i am today 
look 
i tried to kill myself with a lady bic 
a pink plastic razor with daisies on it

how could i forget  we re talking   
i wanted to talk to you
about this music town thing 
next week  you ll be the owner
of one of the many music towns   
  across this great land  correct 
  yes 
you like it because music town
raises prices  so you make more money 
  you re a smart boy 
  when music town comes in   
joe is out  a j  is out 
all the beautiful little tattooed 
gum chewing freaks are out as well 
and it pretty much goes
without saying  that i m out 
wish it had gone without saying 
but you won t shut up 
what i think lucas is trying to say
is that i m going to open my own store 
you don t have the start up capital 
  yes  he does 
  no  i don t 
but i will  i will get it 
mitch   
i quit 
  you knew  didn t you 
  about what 
everything  about me 
what i wanted to do 
i knew you weren t happy 
thank you for coming   bye  move along 
these are on sale with a coupon  right 
doesn t anybody work in this store

a j  
leave the merchandise  take your cup 
get out  bug someone outside 
now 
here s all your money  count it 
i hate this place  you love it 
let me sell it to you 
cheap 
thanks  you won t regret it 
asshole 
  i ll take it 
  give me that 
you 
  take the lead 
  what 
go on 
you re on 
perfect 
well  not entirely perfect 
hi  what are you doing up here 
  listen to me 
  hello  corey 
you re so special and so talented 
you have everything it takes 
more than everything it takes 
and you re really stupid
because you don t know that 
and i know you don t love me anymore
and i know that i blew it 
and if you don t go to art school   
if you don t understand how special
you are  then you know nothing 
i did love you and i still   
only i didn t realize it was love
because it was more than love   
and it wasn t just some stupid feeling
in my stomach 
i ll never love anybody as much as you 
and i hate you  why did you wait so long 
i quit 
i m going to art school   
in boston   
so i can be near you 
  really 
  yeah 
that guy  whatever his name is 
what s his name 
that dude with the shaved head 
the liar guy 
  henry rollins 
  yes  the guy with tattoos all over 
i admit  henry rollins is sort of a puss 
yeah  he s a total puss  his lyrics suck 
but you can t go and put down the misfits 
they had everything it took
to be a great punk band 
they had good bass lines
and strong guitar chords   
even though they were only three 
they didn t even compare to primus 
they were that old school stuff 
why get into primus 
  primus sucks 
  primus is the new stuff 
out with the old  in with the new 
religion s a bad thing if primus
is what s gonna come around 
  what are you talking about 
  the fact that primus has nothing 
they got good bass lines  i ll admit 
they have beautiful bass lines 
six string fretless bass   
okay  but they re not
as good as the pixies 
the pixies have way better bass lines
than primus 
so why didn t they stick around 
because people wanted to do solo careers
and explore themselves   
as single entities instead of a band 
but that s like money
