your first time would be
your back up against the daily totals
and your feet pounding against the safe
oh rexy stop that
youre so sexy
why are you being so nice to me
lets save our hallmark moment
hey whats up man
hows your head
its fine

you think ill still be working here
if i had 9000
yeah i think you would
i think you would too
when i call mitchell
hes gonna call the cops
so you can leave if you want
i am not leaving joe
you know when my old man
used to drink
which was often
he used to say to me
you will never amount to anything
dont give up
youre 21 lucas
im not
its too late
put the glue in like this
pop that sucker down right on top of it
and then flip the
hey man what are you doing
dont get your thumbprints all over it
look theres thumbprints there now
wanna wreck the whole record dude
youre crazy man
hey mark
you love gwar
why dont you join the band
mark man you play a mean guitar
its really a shame that you must die
wait hey come on
i love you eddie
do you need a new night manager
what are you doing later
i dont know
im either going to jail or hell
i cant decide which
wherever youre going
would you have dinner with me first
you bet
rest in peace deb
death is in the cards huh
lucas why did you take that money
do you have a plan
no
not a comprehensive plan
i think you do
a funeral
i am not going
you dont have a choice if youre dead
whats rip mean
really idiotic party
hey man theres your problem
somebody burned it
no
if you were listening to records
and somebody burned it
or put water on it or something
it wouldnt wreck em just warp em a bit
sometimes that makes them
even sound better
the only thing that can destroy records
is some freak who kicks em
and throws em on the ground
its only cause im not in a band right
because you know if i was in a band
they would not be doing this to me
if you didnt listen to cds
clapton on vinyl
could you be a bit more vague man
we got lots of clapton on vinyl we got
clapton with john mayall with yardbirds
clapton with derek  the dominoes
clapton with blind faith
the rainbow concert from 73
do you want him solo unplugged
you want him with cream
you wanted the tapes with jimmy page
cool
where is it
over there man
hey eddie do you have the shaggs
on 45 philosophy of the world
i know that you have the album
but im looking for the 45
deb
did you know that their second album
got stolen from
their familys trailer home
deb can i see it
never found it again i wonder what
please
shaggs are definitely
the hottest punk rock band
i love radicals
got it
hey eddie would you play it for me
yeah no problem ill do anything for you
we are gathered here today
to pay our last respects to debra
she left us and never said why
but i am really going to miss her
and i wish that i could have known her
a little bit better
dogshit
hey dead people dont talk
berko would you like to say something
deb i just
i just want you to stay thats all
aj do you have something to say
well is it better to know or not to know
you see i want to go to art school
but im afraid
jesus i hate this funeral
empire records open till midnight
this is mark
midnight
yes
help me help me
oh god
ill take care of him boss
okay
i really miss gina
thats really special but arent we
supposed to be talking about me
i know i just cant stop
thinking about her
shes not afraid of life
and shes not afraid to be herself
and i wish that i could be like that
i wish i could be brave like gina
you are brave
youre getting out of here
youre always talking about
how i do what i want to do
but i dont
i dont because i want to sing in a band
but i dont have the guts to even audition
and i know that if i dont do something
im going to end up like my mother
her life ended after high school
youre never going to be like your mother
if you dont want to be like her
youre going to be fine
that is so sweet i think im going to barf
excuse me
get down here
here
hi mark
i used to pee in my bed
i did i wet my bed until i was 10
my mother turned me over to the county
when i was 10 too
not for being a bedwetter
but for being a bad seed
anyway three years went by
and then joe came
he took me out and i became
the person that i am today
look
i tried to kill myself with a lady bic
a pink plastic razor with daisies on it
and a moisturizing strip
and it took me forever
just to get through my skin
i dont know
i was just really tired of being invisible

asshole
ill take it
give me that
you
take the lead
what
go on
youre on
perfect
well not entirely perfect
hi what are you doing up here
listen to me
hello corey
youre so special and so talented
you have everything it takes
more than everything it takes
and youre really stupid
because you dont know that
and i know you dont love me anymore
and i know that i blew it
and if you dont go to art school
if you dont understand how special
you are then you know nothing
i did love you and i still
only i didnt realize it was love
because it was more than love
and it wasnt just some stupid feeling
in my stomach
ill never love anybody as much as you
and i hate you why did you wait so long
i quit
im going to art school
in boston
so i can be near you
really
yeah
that guy whatever his name is
whats his name
that dude with the shaved head
the liar guy
henry rollins
yes the guy with tattoos all over
i admit henry rollins is sort of a puss
yeah hes a total puss his lyrics suck
but you cant go and put down the misfits
they had everything it took
to be a great punk band
they had good bass lines
and strong guitar chords
even though they were only three
they didnt even compare to primus
they were that old school stuff
why get into primus
primus sucks
primus is the new stuff
out with the old in with the new
religions a bad thing if primus
is whats gonna come around
what are you talking about
the fact that primus has nothing
they got good bass lines ill admit
they have beautiful bass lines
sixstring fretless bass
okay but theyre not
as good as the pixies
the pixies have way better bass lines
than primus
so why didnt they stick around
because people wanted to do solo careers
and explore themselves
as single entities instead of a band
but thats like money
