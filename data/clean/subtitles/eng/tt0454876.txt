the french part of india 
my father owned the zoo   
and i was delivered on short
notice by a herpetologist   
who was there to check on
the bengal monitor lizard 
mother and i were both healthy   
but the poor lizard escaped   
and was trampled by a
frightened cassowary 
the way of karma  huh 
the way of god 
that s quite a story 
i had assumed your father was a
mathematician because of your name 
far from it  i was named
after a swimming pool 
there is a swimming pool named  pi  
you see  my uncle francis was born
with too much water in his lungs 
they say the doctors
swung francis around
by the ankles to clear the water out   
and that s what gave him the
huge chest and skinny legs   
that made him such a great swimmer 
is francis actually your uncle 
he said he was friends with your father 
he s my honorary uncle 
i call him mamaji 
my father s best
friend  my swimming guru 
pl  i trained with him three
times a week at the ashram 
his lessons would save
my life in the end 
a mouthful of water will
not harm you  but panic will 
remember to breathe now 
don t hold your breath 
good boy 
i hope you don t mind vegetarian 
no  no  not at all 
and your name  huh 
you were going to tell me how
you got your name  i think 
oh  yes  i got it from something
mamaji once told my father 
you see  most travelers collect
postcards or teacups
on their journeys   
but not mamaji 
mamaji collects swimming pools 
he swims in every pool he comes upon 
one day  mamaji said to my father that 
of all the pools in the world   
the most beautiful was
a public pool in paris 
that the water there was so clear 
you could make your
morning coffee with it 
that a single swim
there changed his life 
before i was born  he said   
 if you want your son
to have a clean soul   
 you must take him one day to
swim in the piscine molitor   
i never understood why my father
took this so much to heart 
but he did  and i was named
 piscine molitor patel   
imagine me trying to explain that name 
i barely made it to
the age of 11 before   
hey  piscine 
are you pissing right now 
look at him  he s pissing 
pl  with one word  my name went from
an elegant french swimming pool   
to a stinking indian latrine 
i was  pissing  everywhere 
no pissing in the schoolyard 
pl  even the teachers started doing it 
not deliberately  of course 
so  then  what might occur
if we release gas too quickly 
pissing 
he said  pissing   
that s enough  order  order 
pl  when we returned the next
year for our first day of school 
i was prepared 
present  sir 
piscine patel 
good morning  lam piscine molitor patel 
known to all as   
pi  the sixteenth letter
of the greek alphabet   
which is also used in mathematics
to represent the ratio   
of any circle s
circumference to its diameter 
an irrational number of infinite length 
usually rounded to three digits   
as 3 14 
pi 
very impressive  pi  now  sit down 
and from then on  you were  pi  
pl  well  no  not quite 
nice try  pissing 
pl  but i still had the
whole day ahead of me 
french class was next 
je m appelle piscine molitor patel 
di   pi 
pl  then  geography 
these are the first 20
decimal places of pi 
pl  my last class of
the day was mathematics 
slowly  slowly  slowly 
three  seven  five  eight  nine 
eight  five  eight  nine 
it s right  he s really doing this 
pi  pi  pi 
pl  by the end of that day 
i was pi patel  school legend 
um  mamaji tells me you re
a legend among sailors  too 
out there  all alone 
oh  i don t even know how to sail 
and i wasn t alone out there 
richard parker was with me 
richard parker 
mamaji didn t tell me everything 
he just said i should look you
up when i got back to montreal 
so  what were you doing in pondicherry 
writing a novel 
by the way  i enjoyed your first book 
so  this new one  is it set in india 
no  portugal  actually  but
it s cheaper living in india 
ah  well  i look forward to reading it 
you can t 
i threw it out 
two years trying to bring
this thing to life   
and then one day  it
sputtered  coughed and died 
oh  i m sorry 
uh  i was sitting in this coffee
house in pondicherry one afternoon 
mourning my loss   
when this old man at the table
next to me struck up a conversation 
yeah  mamaji  he does that 
when i told him about my
abandoned book  he said   
 so  a canadian who s
come to french india
 in search of a story   
 well  my friend  i know an
indian in french canada   
 with the most incredible story to tell 
 it must be fate that the
two of you should meet   
well  i haven t spoken about
richard parker in so many years 
so  what has mamaji already told you 
he said you had a story that
would make me believe in god 
he would say that about a nice meal 
as for god  i can
only tell you my story 
you will decide for
yourself what you believe 
fair enough 
let s see  then  where to begin 
pondicherry is the
french riviera of india 
in the streets closest to the ocean 
you might think you were
in the south of france 
a few blocks inland  there s a canal 
just beyond that is indian pondicherry 
and the muslim quarter
is just to the west 
when the french handed
pondicherry back to us in 1954   
the town decided that some sort
of commemoration was in order 
my father  who was a clever
businessman  came up with one 
he ran a hotel  and he got
the idea to open a zoo   
in the local botanical gardens instead 
pl  as it also happened  my mother
was a botanist in the gardens 
they met  married  and a year
later my brother ra w  was born 
i came two years after that 
it sounds magical  growing up in   
amen 
yeah  let s eat 
i didn t know hindus said  amen   
catholic hindus do 
catholic hindus 
we get to feel guilty before
hundreds of gods  instead of just one 
but you re a hindu first 
none of us knows god until
someone introduces us 
i was first introduced
to god as a hindu 
there are 33 million gods
in the hindu religion 
how can i not come
to know a few of them 
i met krishna first 
yashoda once accused baby
krishna of eating dirt 
 tut  tut you naughty boy
  you shouldn t do that   
but he didn t 
that s what he told her 
 i didn t eat dirt   
yashoda said   no  well then     
 open your mouth   
so krishna opened his mouth 
and what do you think yashoda saw 
what  
she saw in krishna s mouth
the whole entire universe 
pl  the gods were my
superheroes growing up 
hanuman  the monkey god   
lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend lakshman 
ganesh  the elephant headed   
risking his life to defend the
honor of his mother  parvati 
vishnu  the supreme soul 
the source of all things 
vishnu sleeps  floating on
the shoreless cosmic ocean   
and we are the stuff of his dreaming 
spectacle 
don t let these stories and
pretty lights fool you  boys 
religion is darkness 
pl  my dear appa believed
himself part of the new india 
as a child  he had had polio 
he used to lie in bed racked with
pain  wondering where god was 
in the end  god didn t save
him  western medicine did 
my amma went to college   
and thought her family was
part of the new india as well   
until her parents cut her off   
because they thought she
was marrying beneath her 
her religion was the only
link she had to her past 
i met christ in the
mountains when i was 12 
we were visiting relatives 
tea growers in munnar 
it was our third day there 
ravi and i were terribly bored 
challenge  i ll give you two rupees 
run in to that church
and drink the holy water 
you must be thirsty 
here 
i brought you this 
why would a god do that 
why would he send his own son   
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people 
because he loves us 
god made himself approachable to us 
human  so we could understand him 
we can t understand god
in all his perfection 
but we can understand god s son
and his suffering as
we would a brother s 
that made no sense 
sacrificing the innocent to atone
for the sins of the guilty   
what kind of love is that 
but this son   
i couldn t get him out of my head 
young pl  if god is so
perfect and we are not   
why would he want to create all this 
why does he need us at all 
all you have to know
is that he loves us 
god so loved this world
that he gave his only son 
pl  the longer i
listened to the priest   
the more i came to like this son of god 
thank you  vishnu  for
introducing me to christ 
i came to faith through hinduism
and i found god s love through christ 
but god wasn t finished with me yet 
pl  god works in mysterious ways 
and so it was  he
introduced himself again 
this time by the name of allah 
allahu akbar 
pl  my arabic was never very good   
but the sound and feel of the
words brought me closer to god 
in performing salah   
the ground i touched
became holy ground   
and i found a feeling of
serenity and brotherhood 
this lamb is exquisite 
it s the best dish on the table 
you re all missing out 
you only need to convert to
three more religions  piscine   
and you will spend your life on holiday 
are you going to mecca
this year  swami jesus 
or to rome for your
coronation as pope pi us 
you stay out of this  ravi 
just as you like cricket 
pi has his own interests 
no  gita  ravi has a point 
you cannot follow three different
religions at the same time  piscine 
why not 
because believing in
everything at the same time   
is the same as not
believing in anything at all 
he s young  santosh  he s
still finding his way 
and how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path 
listen  instead of leaping
from one religion to the next   
why not start with reason 
in a few hundred years   
science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe   
than religion has in 10 000 
that is true 
your father is right 
science can teach us more
about what is out there   
but not what is in here 
some eat meat  some eat vegetable 
i do not expect us all to
agree about everything   
but i would much rather have you
believe in something
i don t agree with   
than to accept everything blindly 
and that begins with
thinking rationally 
do you understand 
good 
i would like to be baptized 
so  you re a christian and a muslim 
and a hindu  of course 
and a jew  i suppose 
well  i do teach a course on
the kabbalah at the university 
and why not  faith is
a house with many rooms 
but no room for doubt 
oh  plenty  on every floor 
doubt is useful 
it keeps faith a living thing 
after all  you cannot know
the strength of your faith
until it s been tested 
where s selvam  we shouldn t
be in here without him 
stop worrying 
i have seen him do
this a thousand times 
i want to meet our new tiger 
pi 
hello  richard parker 
a tiger  richard parker was a tiger 
yeah  he got his name
through a clerical error 
a hunter caught him drinking
from a stream when he was a cub   
and named him thirsty 
when thirsty got too big  the
hunter sold him to our zoo   
but the names got
switched on the paperwork 
the hunter was listed as thirsty 
and the tiger was called richard parker 
we laughed about it  and the name stuck 
let s go   
before we get into trouble 
i want to see him close up 
you re not a zookeeper 
come on 
that s it  richard parker 
it s for you 
no 
what are you thinking 
are you out of your mind 
who gave you permission
to come back here 
you have just ignored
everything i ve ever taught you 
i just wanted to say hello to him 
you think that tiger is your friend  
he s an animal  not a playmate 
animals have souls 
i have seen it in their eyes 
find selvam 
you re sure  sir   pi s just a boy 
do it  go ahead 
animals do not think like we do 
people who forget that
get themselves killed 
that tiger is not your friend 
when you look into his eyes   
you are seeing your own
emotions reflected back at you 
nothing else 
don t be stupid  say you re sorry 
what have you done  piscine 
you know what your father
said about coming back here 
i am sorry  i was   
what are you thinking 
this is between a father and his sons 
he said he s sorry 
you want to scar them for life 
scar them  that boy almost lost his arm 
but he s still a boy 
he will be a man sooner than you think 
and this is a lesson i do
not want them ever to forget 
selvam 
   and so has placed the
country in a state of emergency 
under the directive  the states
of gujarat and tamil nadu   
will be placed under the direct
authority of the central government 
police will be granted powers   
to arrest and indefinitely
detain citizens
responsible for the uprising 
pl  things changed after
the day of appa s lesson 
the world had lost
some of its enchantment 
school was a bore  nothing but
facts  fractions and french 
words and patterns that
went on and on  without end 
just like my irrational nickname 
i grew restless searching for something
that might bring meaning
back into my life 
and then  i met anandi 
mother made me study music 
and one day  my teacher
came down with the flu 
he asked if i could take his place 
playing rhythms for a dance class 
no 
if you do not concentrate   
you cannot express your
love of god through dance 
feel the ground beneath your feet 
open your gaze out onto the horizon 
let that spiritual energy pulse
through you and out into the world 
through abhinaya 
anandi  come to the front  lead them 
why are you following me 
what 
you were following me 
what does this mean 
in the dance  you went from pataka   
which means the forest 
and then you did   
samputa   
which means something that is hidden 
and after that  you did this 
and then you did chatura 
but at the very end  you did this 
none of the other dancers did that 
what did you mean  the god of
love is hiding in the forest 
no  that also means the lotus flower 
lotus flower is hiding in the forest 
why would a lotus flower
hide in the forest 
and this is richard parker 
he is the most magnificent creature
we ve ever had here 
look at the way he s turning his head 
showing off  like a dancer 
no  he heard something 
he s listening  you see 
we have talked about it for some time 
do you understand what i m saying  
pi  
sorry  you ve been   
worried 
for my family 
our animals are worth far
more abroad than here in india 
and if the town council
stops supporting us   
i don t know where we will be 
so  it is what we have to do 
do you understand 
i m sorry  what are we talking about 
we are leaving india 
what 
we are selling the zoo 
the zoo was never ours to sell 
the land belongs to the town 
but the animals are ours
and if we sell them   
we will have enough to start a new life 
but where would we go 
our life is here  appa 
canada 
i have some opportunities
for work in winnipeg 
i ll be shipping most of the
animals for sale in north america 
we can get freighter
passage for the whole family 
so   
it is settled 
we will sail like columbus 
but columbus was looking for india 
pl  it takes a lot
of work to sell a zoo 
before we left   
anandi and i had time enough
to break each other s hearts 
of course  i promised i
would come back one day 
it s funny 
i remember everything
else about our last day 
but i don t remember saying goodbye 
pi  they re serving dinner below 
piscine   
you have a whole life ahead of you 
we are doing this for you and ravi 
come inside and have some dinner 
vegetarian  please 
oh  my sons and i are vegetarians 
do you have anything   
no  no  no  not more gravy 
you don t want gravy  no 
no  i want something vegetarian 
oh 
pas de problème 
she asked if you have
something vegetarian 
the cow that produced
this liver was vegetarian 
the pigs that went into these
sausages were vegetarian 
very funny 
but my wife doesn t eat liver 
pas de problème 
then she can eat the sausage 
the rice  and the gravy 
or you can cook your own food 
haw dare you talk to my wife like that 
here s your rice 
i cook for sailors   
not curry eaters 
what did you say 
let go of me 
who do you think you are 
you re nothing but a servant 
i feed people  you feed monkeys 
hello 
i am happy buddhist 
so  i eat rice
next to gravy 
on ship  gravy is not meat 
is taste 
you try 
don t worry 
we will have plenty of fresh
supplies after we stop in manila 
why give orange juice tranquilizers 
she s not going to cause any trouble 
the stress of traveling is
not good for the animals   
and it helps with the seasickness 
we don t want to be cleaning
up after a seasick orangutan   
do we 
pl  my father was a businessman 
he had never tended the animals himself 
i realized   
leaving india must have been
harder for him than it was for me 
so   
have i forgotten anything 
i think you ve set the stage 
so far  we have an indian boy named
after a french swimming pool   
on a japanese ship full of
animals  heading to canada 
yes 
now  we have to send our boy into
the middle of the pacific and   
and make me believe in god 
yeah 
we ll get there 
it was four days out of manila   
above the mariana trench 
the deepest spot on earth 
our ship  the tsimtsum  pushed on 
bullishly indifferent
to its surroundings 
it moved with the slow  massive
confidence of a continent 
ravi 
did you hear that  ravi 
i m sleeping 
it s a thunderstorm  let s go watch 
are you crazy 
we will get hit by lightning 
no  we won t  it will
hit the bridge first 
don t tempt a storm  pi 
whoa 
oh 
more rain  more rain 
lord of storms 
whoa 
lightning 
ah 
amma 
appa 
ravi  get out  get out 
help me 
help 
get in the boat 
please  save my family 
don t scare  okay  wait  stay here 
you have to help them  please

no  no  my family  please 
we have to help them 
we don t have time 
my family s back there 
we help  you must go 
who let all the animals out 
you have to go now 
no  wait  my father  he can t swim 
go 
hang on to the boat  hold  hold 
bring it down 
hey  you  what are you doing 
jump 
hey  hey 
hey  over here  over here 
richard parker 
no  no 
no  go away  go away 
agh 
amma 
anna  ravi 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
hari 
looks as though your
drugs haven t worn off yet 
orange juice  orange juice 
welcome to pi s ark 
where is your boy  orange juice 
don t worry  i bet mother
and father found him 
they ll all be here soon 
hello 
hello 
anybody 
no 
stop it  no  stop m stop m 
no  no 
i m sorry  orange juice 
i don t have any
seasickness medicine for you 
supplies  oh  supplies 
yes  yes 
no  no 
no  no 
come on  come on 
come on 
mmm 
my name is pi patel 
i have been in a shipwreck 
i am on a lifeboat alone   
with a tiger 
please send help 
god  i give myself to you 
i am your vessel 
whatever comes  i want to know 
show me 
there are no lines 
set your house in order and dig
in for the battle to survive 
establish a strict schedule for eating 
keeping watch and getting rest 
do not drink urine or sea water 
keep busy but avoid
unnecessary exertion 
the mind can be kept occupied
by playing card games   
twenty questions  or  spy 
community singing is another
surefire way to lift the spirits 
telling stories is highly recommended 
above all  don t lose hope 
few things can sap the spirit
faster than seasickness 
waves are most strongly felt when a
boat turns sideways to the current 
a sea anchor is used as a drag to
keep the boat s head to the wind 
proper use of them can increase control
and reduce seasickness
during rough seas 
for castaways who must share
their lifeboats with large 
dangerous carnivores   
it s advisable to establish
a territory as your own 
try this method 
step one 
choose a day when waves
are moderate  but regular 
step two  with the lifeboat
facing into the waves   
making the ride as comfortable as
possible  blow your whistle soothingly 
step three  turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves   
accompanied by harsh 
aggressive use of the whistle 
with sufficient repetition   
the animal will associate
the sound of the whistle   
with the discomfort of seasickness 
similar methods have long
been used by circus trainers   
though they generally
lack access to rough seas 
let the trumpets blare 
let the drum rolls begin 
prepare to be amazed 
here it is  for your
enjoyment and instruction 
the show you ve been
waiting for all your life   
will soon begin 
are you ready for the miracle of it 
well  then  i give to you   
the astounding bengal tiger 
hello  richard parker 
sorry about the choppy ride 
mine  you understand  yours  mine 
you understand 
ew 
step four 
disregard steps one through three 
here  richard parker  i
got some water for you 
in the zoo  we fed our tigers an
average of five kilos of meat a day 
richard parker will
be getting hungry soon 
tigers are powerful swimmers 
and if he gets hungry enough   
i m afraid the little
bit of water between us
won t be any protection 
i need to find a way to feed him 
i can eat the biscuits but
god made tigers carnivores   
so i must learn to catch fish 
if  don t  i m afraid his last meal
will be a skinny  vegetarian boy 
patience 
what am i doing 
wait  i m thinking 
thirty two cartons of biscuits 
ninety three cans of water 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
thank you  lord vishnu 
thank you for coming in the form
of a fish and saving our lives 
thank you 
of course  i brought all
the biscuits and water
on the raft with me to keep them safe 
idiot 
hunger can change everything you
ever thought you knew about yourself 
here  it s yours 
oh ah 
mine  mine 
i can t risk my life every time
i have to climb onto
the boat for supplies 
it s time to settle this 
if we re going to live together 
we have to learn to communicate 
maybe richard parker can t be tamed 
but with god s will  he can be trained 
no 
good 
go  richard parker  go 
go on home  i ll leave you alone 
i ll respect that  i promise 
go  come on 
yes 
i never thought a small piece of shade
could bring me so much happiness 
that a pile of tools  a
bucket  a knife  a pencil   
might become my greatest treasures 
or that knowing richard parker
was here might ever bring me peace 
in times like these   
i remember that he has
as little experience
with the real world as i do 
we were both raised in
a zoo by the same master 
now we ve been orphaned  left to
face our ultimate master together 
without richard parker 
i would have died by now 
my fear of him keeps me alert 
tending to his needs
gives my life purpose 
dolphins 
hey  richard parker 
hey 
above all  don t lose hope 
eight  five  five 
zero  three  six  six   
zero  eight  zero  one   
three  six  zero 
four  six  six  eight   
what are you looking at 
talk to me 
tell me what you see 
words are all i have left to hang on to 
everything mixed up  fragmented 
can t tell daydreams  night
dreams  from reality anymo   
storm  richard parker 
no 
no 
praise be to god 
lord of all worlds 
the compassionate  the merciful 
ah 
come out 
richard parker  come
out  you have to see this 
it s beautiful 
don t hide yourself  he s come to us 
it s a miracle 
come out and see god  richard parker 
why are you scaring him 
oh  god 
i ve lost my family 
i ve lost everything 
i surrender  what more do you want 
i m sorry  richard parker 
we re dying  richard parker 
i m sorry 
amma  appa  ravi   
i m happy i m going to see you soon 
can you feel the rain 
god  thank you for giving me my life 
i m ready now 
richard parker 
mmm 
excuse me 
move 
move  excuse me 
hey  hey 
hey  come on 
hey 
hey  get away  this is my bed 
it was a human tooth 
don t you see  the
island was carnivorous 
carnivorous  like a venus flytrap 
yes  the whole island 
the plants  the water in those
pools  the very ground itself 
during the day  those
pools held fresh water 
but at night  some chemical process
turned the water in
those pools into acid   
acid that dissolved those fish   
that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees 
and richard parker running to the boat 
but where did the tooth come from 
years ago  some poor
fellow  just like me   
must have found himself
stranded on that island   
and  like me  thought he
might stay there forever 
but all that the island gave him
by day  it took away again by night 
to think  how many hours spent
with only meerkats for company 
how much loneliness taken on 
all i know is that eventually he died
and the island digested him   
leaving behind only his teeth 
i saw how my life would end
if i stayed on that island 
alone and forgotten 
i had to get back to
the world  or die trying 
i spent the next day preparing the boat 
i filled my stores with fresh water   
ate seaweed until my
stomach could take no more   
and brought as many
meerkats as i could fit
into the storage locker
for richard parker 
i couldn t leave without him  of course 
it would mean killing him 
and so  i waited for his return 
i knew he wouldn t be late 
richard parker 
no one has seen that
floating island since 
and you won t read about
those trees in any nature book 
and yet  if i hadn t found
those shores  i would have died 
if i hadn t discovered that tooth 
i would have been lost  alone forever 
even when god seemed
to have abandoned me   
he was watching 
even when he seemed
indifferent to my suffering   
he was watching 
and when i was beyond all hope
of saving  he gave me rest   
then gave me a sign
to continue my journey 
by the time we reached
the mexican shore 
i was afraid to let go of the boat 
my strength was gone  i was so weak 
i was afraid that in two feet of
water  so close to deliverance   
i would drown 
i struggled to shore
and fell upon the sand 
it was warm and soft   
like pressing my face
against the cheek of god 
and somewhere  two eyes were
smiling at having me there 
i was so spent  i could hardly move 
and so  richard parker went ahead of me 
he stretched his legs and
walked along the shore 
at the edge of the jungle  he stopped 
i was certain he was
going to look back at me   
flatten his ears to his head  growl 
that he would bring our
relationship to an end in some way 
but he just stared
ahead into the jungle 
and then  richard parker 
my fierce companion   
the terrible one who kept me alive   
disappeared forever from my life 
after a few hours  a member
of my own species found me 
he left and returned with
a group who carried me away 
i wept like a child 
not because i was overwhelmed at
having survived  although i was 
i was weeping because richard
parker left me so unceremoniously 
it broke my heart 
you know  my father was right 
richard parker never
saw me as his friend 
after all we had been through 
he didn t even look back 
but i have to believe there
was more in his eyes   
than my own reflection
staring back at me 
i know it  i felt it 
even if i can t prove it 
you know  i ve left so much behind 
my family  the zoo  india  anandi 
i suppose  in the end  the whole of
life becomes an act of letting go 
but what always hurts the most   
is not taking a moment to say goodbye 
i was never able to thank my
father for all i learned from him 
to tell him  without his lessons   
i would never have survived 
i know richard parker is a
tiger  but i wish i had said   
 it s over  we survived 
 thank you for saving my life 
i love you  richard parker 
 you will always be with me 
 may god be with you   
i don t know what to say 
it s hard to believe  isn t it 
it is a lot to take in 
to figure out what it all means 
if it happened  it happened 
why should it have to mean anything 
some of it is pretty incredible 
see  i was the only one
who survived the shipwreck 
so the japanese shipping company
sent two men to talk to me   
in the mexican hospital
where i was recovering 
i still have a copy of their report 
they had insurance claims to settle   
and they wanted to find
out why the ship sank 
they didn t believe me  either 
thousands of meerkats on a
floating carnivorous island   
and no one has ever seen it 
yes  just like i told you 
bananas don t float 
why are you talking about bananas 
you said the orangutan floated
to you on a bundle of bananas 
but bananas don t float 
are you sure about that 
of course they do  try it for yourself 
in any case  we are not here to
talk about bananas or meerkats 
look  i ve just told you
along story and i m very tired 
we are here because a japanese
cargo ship sank in the pacific 
something i never forget 
i lost my whole family 
get him some water 
we don t mean to push you 
and you have our deepest sympathies 
but we have come a long way   
and we are no closer to
understanding why the ship sank 
because i don t know 
i was asleep  something woke me up 
it could have been an
explosion  i can t be sure 
and then the ship sank 
what else do you want from me 
a story that won t
make us look like fools 
we need a simpler story for our report 
one our company can understand 
a story we can all believe 
so  a story without things
you ve never seen before 
that s right 
without surprises 
without animals or islands 
yes  the truth 
so  what did you do 
i told them another story 
four of us survived 
the cook and the sailor
were already aboard 
the cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard   
and mother held on to some bananas
and made it to the lifeboat 
the cook was a disgusting man 
he ate a rat 
we had food enough for weeks  but he
found the rat in the first few days   
and he killed it  dried
it in the sun and ate it 
he was such a brute  that man 
but he was resourceful 
it was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish 
we would have died in those
first few days without him 
the sailor was the same man who
brought rice and gravy  the buddhist 
we didn t understand much of what
he said  only that he was suffering 
he had broken his leg
horribly in the fall 
we tried to set it as best we
could  but the leg became infected   
and the cook said that we had
to do something or he d die 
the cook said he d do it 
but mother and i had
to hold the man down 
and i believed him  we needed to do it 
so   
i kept saying   i m sorry  i m sorry   
and he just kept looking
at me  his eyes were so   
i ll never understand the
point of that man s suffering 
i can still hear him 
the happy buddhist  he
only ate rice and gravy 
we didn t save him  of course 
he died 
the morning after  the cook
caught his first dorado   
and i didn t understand what he
had done at first  but mother did   
and i had never seen mother so angry 
 stop whining and be happy   he said 
 we need more food or we ll
die  that was the whole point   
 what was the whole
point   mother asked 
 you let that poor boy die in
order to get bait  you monster  
the cook got furious 
he started towards her
with his fist raised   
and mother slapped him
hard  right across the face 
i was stunned 
i thought he was going
to kill her right then 
but he didn t 
the cook didn t stop at bait either  no 
the sailor   
he went the same way the rat went 
the cook was a resourceful man 
it was a week later that he   
because of me 
because i couldn t hold
on to a stupid turtle 
it slipped out of my
hands and swam away 
and the cook came up and he
punched me on the side of my head   
and my teeth clacked and i saw stars 
i thought he was going
to hit me again   
but mother started pounding
on him with her fists   
screaming   monster  monster  
she yelled at me to go to the raft 
i thought she was coming
with me  or i d never have   
i don t know why i
didn t make her go first 
i think about that every day 
i jumped over and turned back
just as the knife came out 
there wasn t anything i could do 
i couldn t look away 
he threw her body overboard 
and then the sharks came 
and i saw what they   
i saw 
the next day  i killed him 
he didn t even fight back 
he knew he had gone too far   
even by his own standards 
he d left the knife out on the bench 
and i did to him what
he did to the sailor 
he was such an evil man 
but worse still  he   
he brought the evil out in me 
and i have to live with that 
i was alone in a lifeboat   
drifting across the pacific ocean 
and i survived 
pl  after that  they
had no more questions 
the investigators didn t seem
to like the story  exactly 
but they thanked me  they
wished me well  and they left 
so the stories   
both the zebra and the sailor   
broke their leg 
and the hyena killed the
zebra and the orangutan 
so    the hyena is the cook 
the sailor is the zebra 
your mother is the orangutan 
and you are   
the tiger 
can i ask you something 
of course 
i ve told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean 
neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship   
and no one can prove which
story is true and which is not 
in both stories  the ship sinks   
my family dies and i suffer 
true 
so  which story do you prefer  
the one with the tiger 
that s the better story 
thank you 
and so it goes with god 
mamaji was right 
it s an amazing story 
will you really let me write it 
of course 
isn t that why mamaji
sent you here  after all 
my wife is here 
do you want to stay for dinner 
she s an incredible cook 
i didn t know you had a wife 
and a cat and two children 
so  your story does have a happy ending 
well  that s up to you 
the story is yours now 
hmm 
 mr  patel s is an astounding
story of courage and endurance   
 unparalleled in the
history of shipwrecks 
 very few castaways can claim to
have survived so long at sea   
 and none in the company   
 of an adult bengal tiger   
hi  dad 
pl  we have a guest 
let me introduce you 
hi  hi
