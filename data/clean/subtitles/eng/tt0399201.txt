  you wanted to see me 
  yes  please 
please  sit down 
so  how is lincoln six echo today 
not so good  i guess 
why do you say that 
well  if i m here 
it means i m not so good 
that s a rather negative association 
my only job is to see that you re happy 
things are ok with you 
right 
your file shows that you ve
been interacting regularly
with jordan two delta 
  there s no law against friendship 
  no  no  we encourage it 
but  obviously 
proximity could become a concern 
i know the rules of proximity 
you ve been doing quite well
in most other areas 
proficient at work 
exercising rigorously 
but screening has picked up
some trace levels 
changes in your metabolism 
and you ve been having nightmares 
are you saying there s
something wrong with me 
why don t you tell me
about your dream 
well  it s the same dream every time 
i m on a boat  headed to the island 
a boat  what kind of boat 
a nice boat 
draw it for me  would you 
so  you are heading
toward the island 
what happens then 
  i drown 
  really 
  why do you think that is 
  i don t know  you tell me 
  maybe you re afraid of winning 
  why would i be afraid 
you tell me 
what s troubling you  lincoln 
well  it s   
it s just   
all right 
tuesday night is tofu night 
and i m asking myself  who decided
that everyone here likes tofu
in the first place 
and what is tofu  anyway 
and why can t i have bacon 
i line up every morning 
and i m not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast 
and   
let s talk about all the white 
why is everyone
wearing white all the time 
it s impossible to keep clean 
i always get the gray stripe 
i never get any color 
and i hand it in to be cleaned 
and someone cleans it  and folds it
neatly back in my drawer  but who 
who is that person  i don t know 
i just    i wanna know answers 
and i wish that there was more 
  more 
  yeah 
more than just waiting
to go to the island 
lincoln 
it s your nature
to question things 
but don t you realize how lucky you are 
that you survived the contamination 
that nature has left you
a garden of eden to repopulate 
that  lincoln  is your purpose 
right  and you 
arert you going to the island too 
no 
my responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate 
that s why people like me 
my staff and supervisors  we   
   we can t win the lottery 
let me see that 
you draw well 
 renovatio  
what does that mean 
i don t know 
it s always in my dream 
i d like to run some tests
on you  lincoln 
what sort of tests 
nice tests 
come with me 
take a seat 
ok  let s get you comfortable 
swing back 
  i thought these were nice tests 
  it s a synaptic brain scan 
totally harmless 
don t worry  it s painless 
  it hurts 
  not really 
  yeah  it does 
  no  it doesn t 
yeah  it really  really does 
the micro sensors
will move along your optic nerve 
they ll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours 
after which 
you ll pass them through your urine 
now  that might hurt 
six echo  you re late 
jones  you ever get bored doing this 
  doing what 
  this 
  i never really thought about it 
  i think about it a lot 
  about what 
  this boring job 
  what are we doing here 
  we re feeding the nutrient lines 
we eat food  food s gotta have
vitamins  right  it s good for us 
you don t ever wonder about anything 
where do these tubes go 
they start there 
and they go    right there 
hey  did you get a look
at the new guy 
seven foxtrot 
they found another survivor 
they keep finding them 
he ll probably win the lottery 
straight down  in the hole 
there you go  you try it 
straight down in the hole 
in the hole

did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination 
hey  mr  man with all the questions 
let me ask you this 
lottery s supposed
to be random  right 
right 
what if it s not 
what if it s rigged 
rigged 
i ve been working on this  here 
take a look at that 
it charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the island 
excluding  of course  the women 
picked to be breeders 
  what is this 
  i took the first letter in each name 
i assigned it a point value system 
based on the alphabet 
like the last guy 
starkweather  s equals 15 
q equals 15  s equals 19 
  do you see what i m saying 
  no 
well  maybe if you would listen to me 
i m trying to tell you 
you string the numbers together 
you divide it by the amount   
you multiply    you divide it by
the amount of    you divide it   
you divide it by the amount of people 
which is 25  a thousand plus five  2500 
you know what that spells 
j o n e s 
  i m winning the lottery tonight 
  did you pack

jones three echo  i need you
to concentrate in this lab 
sir  i want to focus more than anything 
i love my job  it s interesting

has been contaminated 
and it really worries me 
because he s a good friend of mine 
he s one of my best friends 
my only best friend 
he ll be fine  three echo 
sir  i have one question 
where do all the tubes go 
the human organism 
unique in all the universe
in its complexity 
the product of three billion years
of evolution 
perfect in every way  except one 
like all machines  it wears out 
for centuries  the idea
of replenishing the human body
has been
at the forefront of science 
we need to turn this bad day
into a good day 
  how 
  a terrific day  by selling 
by selling  sell  sell  sell 
you start  i finish 
ladies and gentlemen 
welcome to
the next generation of science 
the agnate 
an organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood
to match the client s age 
  you re looking at stage one
  this way  sir 
in its development 
within 12 months
it will be harvest ready 
providing a carrier for your baby 
a second pair of lungs  fresh skin 
all genetically indistinguishable
from your own 
and  in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015 
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state 
they never achieve consciousness 
they never think or suffer
or feel pain  joy  love  hate 
it s a product  ladies and gentlemen 
in every way that matters 
not human 
this is our public relations director 
mr  whitman 
he ll be happy
to answer any questions 
once again  thank you 
mr  whitman 
i want to talk about the smartest
investment you ll ever make 
and i want to tell you how you re
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer 
dr  merrick  albert laurent 
blackhawk security 
you come highly recommended
by the defense department  mr  laurent 
though i m unaware
of your personal qualifications 
my men are ex delta force  seals 
i was formerly with the gign 
french special forces 
i understand you had a corporate theft 
yes  that s what i told
the defense department 
the reality is a little more complex 
that s why i require your services 
we ve had a    security breach 
you have the defense department
at your disposal  why call me 
because their
investment here is sizeable 
one hundred and twenty
billion dollars  to be exact 
and i can t afford
for them to reconsider 
what you tell them
is your business  doctor 
i am in the business
of keeping my clients  confidence 
good 
two of our products have escaped 
impressive 
considering they re vegetative 
well  after several years
of trial and error 
we discovered that
without consciousness 
without human experience 
emotion  without life 
the organs failed 
how long have they been missing 
four hours and 36 minutes 
  they re on foot 
  yes 
wade  1 2 miles an hour 
five mile perimeter 
  standby for suspect description 
  we re on it 
follow me 
  come on  we gotta keep going 
  i have to stop  i can t run anymore 
  you gotta try 
  where 
  anywhere but here 
  but there s nothing 
everything s dead  lincoln 
what if we are contaminated 
then we d be dead 
there s no contamination 
it was a lie 
  what is it 
  i don t know 
but it s alive 
come on  it s mean  whatever it is 
let s rest in here 
jordan two delta s sponsor 
sarah jordan  is in a coma
after a car accident 
she s in need of multiple transplants 
how long does she have 
forty eight hours 
three days maximum 
tell me about six echo 
he was really the first one
to question his environment 
his whole existence here 
over the last few months 
he began demonstrating unstable behavior
and i can t account for it 
i m waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan 
what do they know
about the outside world 
very little 
we control them with
the memory of a shared event 
a global contamination 
it keeps them fearful of going outside 
the island is the one thing
that gives them hope 
gives them purpose 
everything we expose them to 
their programs  their can toons 
books  the games they play 
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills 
to avoid obvious complications 
they aren t imprinted
with an awareness of sex 
we find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether 
in a very real sense   
they re like children 
educated to the level of a 15 year old 
  what was that 
  i don t know 
but i want one 
look 
route 39  route 39 
come on 
i got it from a friend 
i think that s it 
what s up 
yeah  do you know
a guy named mccord 
yeah  we know that tool 
who s asking 
  i am 
  and you would be who 
  lincoln six echo 
  jordan two delta 
right 
y all some of those desert ufo freaks 
  u    what  no  i don t think so 
  no 
mccord 
well  lucky day  captain kirk 
he s in the can 
  he s in a can 
  taking a dump 
a dump  taking it where

to get on my nerves 
  it s the first door on the right 
  thank you 
i have to go 
he s taking a dump in a can 
  something to drink  jack 
  yes  please

hey  you son of a bitch

  how the hell did you get out 
  why do they lie to us  tell me

both of us are gonna be dead 
so  will you just

so we can be alone  ok

i have a little dog and i had a bike 
and a bike  right

with little tassels on the handlebars
and you rode it

our owners to know that we re alive 
just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn t mean they wanna meet the cow

how many laws merrick s breaking
to have you two hatched 
your sponsors
