thats a rather negative association
my only job is to see that youre happy
things are ok with you
right
your file shows that youve
been interacting regularly
with jordan two delta
theres no law against friendship
no no we encourage it
but obviously
proximity could become a concern
i know the rules of proximity
youve been doing quite well
in most other areas
proficient at work
exercising rigorously
but screening has picked up
some trace levels
changes in your metabolism
and youve been having nightmares
are you saying theres
something wrong with me
why dont you tell me
about your dream
well its the same dream every time
im on a boat headed to the island
a boat what kind of boat
a nice boat
draw it for me would you
so you are heading
toward the island
what happens then
i drown
really
why do you think that is
i dont know you tell me
maybe youre afraid of winning
why would i be afraid
you tell me
whats troubling you lincoln
well its
its just
all right
tuesday night is tofu night
and im asking myself who decided
that everyone here likes tofu
in the first place
and what is tofu anyway
and why cant i have bacon
i line up every morning
and im not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast
and
lets talk about all the white
why is everyone
wearing white all the time
its impossible to keep clean
i always get the gray stripe
i never get any color
and i hand it in to be cleaned
and someone cleans it and folds it
neatly back in my drawer but who
who is that person i dont know
i just i wanna know answers
and i wish that there was more
more
yeah
more than just waiting
to go to the island
lincoln
its your nature
to question things
but dont you realize how lucky you are
that you survived the contamination
that nature has left you
a garden of eden to repopulate
that lincoln is your purpose
right and you
arert you going to the island too
no
my responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate
thats why people like me
my staff and supervisors we
we cant win the lottery
let me see that
you draw well
renovatio
what does that mean
i dont know
its always in my dream
id like to run some tests
on you lincoln
what sort of tests
nice tests
come with me
take a seat
ok lets get you comfortable
swing back
i thought these were nice tests
its a synaptic brain scan
totally harmless
dont worry its painless
it hurts

the microsensors
will move along your optic nerve
theyll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours
after which
youll pass them through your urine
now that might hurt
six echo youre late

ive been working on this here
take a look at that
it charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the island
excluding of course the women
picked to be breeders
what is this
i took the first letter in each name
i assigned it a point value system
based on the alphabet
like the last guy
starkweather s equals 15
q equals 15 s equals 19
do you see what im saying
no
well maybe if you would listen to me
im trying to tell you
you string the numbers together
you divide it by the amount
you multiply you divide it by
the amount of you divide it
you divide it by the amount of people
which is 25 a thousand plus five 2500
you know what that spells

has been contaminated
and it really worries me
because hes a good friend of mine
hes one of my best friends
my only best friend
hell be fine three echo
sir i have one question
where do all the tubes go
the human organism
unique in all the universe
in its complexity
the product of three billion years
of evolution
perfect in every way except one
like all machines it wears out
for centuries the idea
of replenishing the human body
has been
at the forefront of science
we need to turn this bad day
into a good day
how
a terrific day by selling
by selling sell sell sell
you start i finish
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to
the next generation of science
the agnate
an organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood
to match the clients age
youre looking at stage one
this way sir
in its development
within 12 months
it will be harvestready
providing a carrier for your baby
a second pair of lungs fresh skin
all genetically indistinguishable
from your own
and in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state
they never achieve consciousness
they never think or suffer
or feel pain joy love hate
its a product ladies and gentlemen
in every way that matters
not human
this is our public relations director
mr whitman
hell be happy
to answer any questions
once again thank you
mr whitman
i want to talk about the smartest
investment youll ever make
and i want to tell you how youre
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer
dr merrick albert laurent
blackhawk security
you come highly recommended
by the defense department mr laurent
though im unaware
of your personal qualifications
my men are exdelta force seals
i was formerly with the gign
french special forces
i understand you had a corporate theft
yes thats what i told
the defense department
the reality is a little more complex
thats why i require your services
weve had a security breach
you have the defense department
at your disposal why call me
because their
investment here is sizeable
one hundred and twenty
billion dollars to be exact
and i cant afford
for them to reconsider
what you tell them
is your business doctor
i am in the business
of keeping my clients confidence
good
two of our products have escaped
impressive
considering theyre vegetative
well after several years
of trial and error
we discovered that
without consciousness
without human experience
emotion without life
the organs failed
how long have they been missing
four hours and 36 minutes
theyre on foot
yes
wade 12 miles an hour
five mile perimeter
standby for suspect description
were on it
follow me
come on we gotta keep going
i have to stop i cant run anymore
you gotta try
where
anywhere but here
but theres nothing
everythings dead lincoln
what if we are contaminated
then wed be dead
theres no contamination
it was a lie
what is it
i dont know
but its alive
come on its mean whatever it is
lets rest in here
jordan two deltas sponsor
sarah jordan is in a coma
after a car accident
shes in need of multiple transplants
how long does she have
fortyeight hours
three days maximum
tell me about six echo
he was really the first one
to question his environment
his whole existence here
over the last few months
he began demonstrating unstable behavior
and i cant account for it
im waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan
what do they know
about the outside world
very little
we control them with
the memory of a shared event
a global contamination
it keeps them fearful of going outside
the island is the one thing
that gives them hope
gives them purpose
everything we expose them to
their programs their cantoons
books the games they play
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills
to avoid obvious complications
they arent imprinted
with an awareness of sex
we find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether
in a very real sense
theyre like children
educated to the level of a 15yearold
what was that
i dont know
but i want one
look
route 39 route 39
come on
i got it from a friend
i think thats it
whats up

what are you talking about
some hag trophy wife

they take it from you
but i have a mother
i remember her
yeah i know
i grew up on a farm
i have a little dog and i had a bike
and a bike right
it was a pink flexiflyer
with little tassels on the handlebars
and you rode it
to your grandmothers
you ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies
yeah
no memory imprints
i seen them
a buddy of mine is a programmer
at the institute he showed me
theres only 12 stories
they change around little details
but theyre all pretty much the same
the life you think you had
before the contamination
it never happened
come on dont look at me like that
at least you had a bike
wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood be my guest
how long
how long have we been alive
youre echo generation

delta means youre four
three
the whole reason you exist is
cause everyone wants to live forever
its the new american dream
theres people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it
dont people care that they kill us
that they take parts from us
they dont know they think youre
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack
why do you think merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground
he doesnt want anybody knowing
the truth especially not sponsors
sponsors
the people that had you made
they like own you
but why doesnt merrick want
our owners to know that were alive
just because people wanna eat the burger
doesnt mean they wanna meet the cow
besides do you know
how many laws merricks breaking
to have you two hatched
your sponsors
cant have any part of that
theyre like high society
rich and famous
if they knew
merrick would be out of business
we have to find our sponsors
