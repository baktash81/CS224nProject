until i ask you

youve a right to live where you please
im a good girl i am
where do i come from
hawkestone
who said i didnt
blimey you know everything you do
you sir do you think
you could find me a taxi
madam its stopped raining

if you wanta go fortunetelling
cheltenham harrow
cambridge and
lndia
quite right
he aint a tec hes a bloomin busybody
do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall
i have thought of it
perhaps i will one day
hes no gentleman he aint
to interfere with a poor girl
how do you do it may i ask
simple phonetics the science of speech
thats my profession also my hobby
anyone can spot an lrishman
or a yorkshireman by his brogue
but i can place a man within six miles
i can place im within two miles in london
sometimes within two streets
ought to be ashamed of imself
unmanly coward
is there a living in that
oh yes
let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone
cease this detestable
boohooing instantly
or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship
i have a right to be here if i like
same as you
a woman who utters such disgusting
depressing noises
has no right to be anywhere
no right to live
remember youre a human with a soul
and the divine gift of articulate speech
your native language is the language
of shakespeare and
milton and the bible dont sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon
look at her a prisoner of the gutters
condemned by every syllable she utters
by right she should be taken out and hung
for the coldblooded murder
of the english tongue
heavens what a sound
this is what the british population
calls an elementary education
come sir i think youve picked
a poor example
did l
hear them down in soho square
dropping hs everywhere
speaking english any way they like
hey you sir did you go to school
what ya tike me for a fool
no one taught him take instead of tike
hear a yorkshireman or worse
hear a cornishman converse
ld rather hear a choir singing flat
chickens cackling in a barn
just like this one
garn
garn
l ask you sir what sort of word is that
lts aoow and garn
that keep her in her place
not her wretched clothes and dirty face
why cant the english
teach their children how to speak
this verbal class distinction
by now should be antique
lf you spoke as she does sir
instead of the way you do
why you might be selling flowers too
i beg your pardon
an englishmans way of speaking
absolutely classifies him
the moment he talks he makes
some other englishman despise him
one common language
im afraid well never get
oh why cant the english learn to
set a good example to people
whose english is painful to your ears
the scotch and the lrish
leave you close to tears
there even are places
where english completely disappears
why in america
they havent used it for years
why cant the english
teach their children how to speak
norwegians learn norwegian
the greeks are taught their greek
ln france every frenchman
knows his language from a to z
the french dont care
what they do actually
as long as they pronounce it properly
arabians learn arabian
with the speed of summer lightning
the hebrews learn it backwards
which is absolutely frightening
use proper english
youre regarded as a freak
oh why cant the english
why cant the english learn to speak
thank you
see this creature
with her curbstone english
thatll keep her in the gutter
till the end of her days
in six months i could pass her off
as a duchess at an embassy ball

for teachin me my own language
as you would for french
i wont give more than a shillin
take it or leave it
do you know pickering
if you think of a shilling
not as a simple shilling
but as a percentage of this girls income
it works out as fully equivalent of
60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire
by george its enormous
its the biggest offer i ever had
sixty pounds what are you talkin about
where would i get 60 pounds
i never offered you 60 pounds
hold your tongue
but i aint got 60 pounds

here
whats this for
to wipe your eyes to wipe any part
of your face that feels moist
remember thats your handkerchief

its no use to talk to her like that
she doesnt understand you

sandpaper if it wont come off

you cant walk over everybody like this
i
walk over everybody
my dear mrs pearce my dear pickering
i had no intention of walking over anybody
i merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl
i didnt express myself clearly
because i didnt wish to hurt her delicacy
or yours
but sir you cant take a girl up like that
as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach
why not
why not but you dont know
anything about her
what about her parents
she may be married
garn
there as the girl
very properly says garn
whod marry me
by george eliza
the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men
shooting themselves for your sake
before im done with you

no feelings we need worry about
well have you eliza
i got me feelings same as anyone else
mr higgins i must know on what terms
the girl is to be here

when youve finished teaching
you must look ahead a little sir
whatll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter mrs pearce
thats her own business

when im done well throw her back
then itll be her own business again
thatll be all right wont it
youve no feelin eart in ya
you dont care for nothin but yourself
ive ad enough of this im goin
you ought to be ashamed of yourself

ow do i know what might be in em
ive eard of girls bein drugged
by the likes o you
pledge of good faith
ill take one half
and you take the other
youll have boxes of them
barrels of them every day
youll live on them eh
i wouldnt ve ate it only im too ladylike
to take it out o me mouth
think of it eliza
think of chocolates and taxis
and gold and diamonds
i dont want no gold and no diamonds
im a good girl i am
higgins i really must interfere
mrs pearce is quite right
if this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months
for an experiment in teaching she must
understand thoroughly what shes doing
you are to stay here
for the next six months
learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop
if youre good and do what youre told
youll sleep in a proper bedroom
have lots to eat money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis
but if you are naughty and idle
youll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles
and be walloped by mrs pearce
with a broomstick
at the end of six months
you shall be taken to buckingham palace
in a carriage beautifully dressed
if the king finds out
that you are not a lady
the police will take you to the tower
of london where your head will be cut off
as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls
but if you are not found out
you shall have a present of
seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop
if you refuse this offer
you will be the most ungrateful
wicked girl
and the angels will weep for you
are you satisfied pickering
i dont understand
what youre talking about
could i put it more plainly or fairly
mrs pearce
come with me
thats right
bundle her off to the bathroom
youre a great bully you are
i wont stay here if i dont like it
i wont let nobody wallop me
dont answer back girl
ive always been a good girl i ave
in six monthsin three
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue
lll take her anywhere
and ill pass her off as anything
ill make a queen of that barbarous wretch
ive never had a bath in me life
not what youd call a proper one
you know you cant be a nice girl inside
if youre dirty outside
ill have to put you in here
this will be your bedroom
i couldnt sleep in here missus
its too good for the likes o me
i should be afraid to touch anythin
i aint a duchess yet you know
whats this
this where you wash clothes
this is where we wash ourselves eliza
and where im going to wash you
you expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over
not me
i shall catch me death
come along now
come along
take your clothes off
come on girl do as youre told
take your clothes off
here come on help me take these
take your hands off me
im a good girl i am
it aint right it aint decent
get your hands off me
im a good girl i am
forgive the bluntness
but if im to be in this business
l shall feel responsible for the girl
i hope its clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position
what that thing sacred i assure you
come now you know what i mean
this is no trifling matter
are you a man of good character
where women are concerned
have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned
yes very frequently
i havent the moment i let a woman
make friends with me
she becomes jealous exacting
suspicious and a damned nuisance
the moment that i make friends with
a woman i become selfish and tyrannical
so here i am a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so
well after all pickering
lm an ordinary man
who desires nothing more
than just an ordinary chance
to live exactly as he likes
and do precisely what he wants
an average man am i
of no eccentric whim
who likes to live his life
free of strife
doing whatever he thinks is best for him
oh just an ordinary man
but let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through
shell redecorate your home
from the cellar to the dome
then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you
let a woman in your life
and you are up against a wall
make a plan and you will find
she has something else in mind
so rather than do either
you do something else that neither
likes at all
you want to talk of keats or milton
she only wants to talk of love
you go to see a play or ballet
and spend it searching for her glove
let a woman in your life
and you invite eternal strife
let them buy their wedding bands
for those anxious little hands
ld be equally as willing
for a dentist to be drilling
than to ever let a woman in my life
lm a very gentle man
eventempered and goodnatured
whom you never hear complain
who has the milk of human kindness
by the quart in every vein
a patient man am i
down to my fingertips
the sort who never could
ever would
let an insulting remark escape his lips
a very gentle man
but let a woman in your life
and patience hasnt got a chance
she will beg you for advice
your reply will be concise
and shell listen very nicely
then go out and do precisely
what she wants
you were a man of grace and polish
who never spoke above a hush
now all at once youre using language
that would make a sailor blush
let a woman in your life
and youre plunging in a knife
let the others of my sex
tie the knot around their necks
ld prefer a new edition
of the spanish lnquisition
than to ever let a woman in my life
lm a quietliving man
who prefers to spend the evenings
ln the silence of his room
who likes an atmosphere as restful
as an undiscovered tomb
a pensive man am i
of philosophic joys
who likes to meditate contemplate
free from humanitys mad inhuman noise
a quietliving man
but let a woman in your life
and your sabbatical is through
ln a line that never ends
come an army of her friends
come to jabber and to chatter
and to tell her
what the matter is with you
shell have a booming boisterous family
who will descend on you en masse
shell have a large wagnerian mother
with a voice that shatters glass
let a woman in your life
l shall never let a woman
in my life
get out of ere jamie you get out too
come on doolittle and remember
drinks is to be paid for or not drunk
thanks for your ospitality george

i want my daughter thats what i want
see
of course you do
youre her father arent you
im glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left
shes in there yes take her away at once
what
take her away do you think i am going
to keep your daughter for you
now is this reasonable governor
is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that
the girl belongs to me you got er
where do i come in
how dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me
you sent her here on purpose
dont take a man up like that governor
the police shall take you up
this is a plan
a plot to extort money by threats
i shall telephone the police
have i asked you for a brass farthin
i leave it to this gentleman ere
have i said a word about money
well what else did you come for
what would a bloke come for
be uman governor
alfred you sent her here on purpose
so help me governor i never did
how did you know she was here
id tell you governor
if youd let me get a word in
im willing to tell ya
im wanting to tell ya
im waiting to tell ya
you know pickering this chaps got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric
observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild
lm willing to tell you im wanting
to tell you im waiting to tell you
thats the welsh strain in im
how did you know eliza was here
if you didnt send er
well she sent back for her luggage
and i got to ear about it
she said she didnt want no clothes
what was i to think from that governor
i ask you as a parent what was i to think
so you came here to rescue her
from worse than death eh
yes sir governor thats right
yes
mrs pearce
elizas father has come to take her away
give her to him will you
now wait a minute governor
wait a minute
you and me is men o the world aint we
men of the world are we
perhaps youd better go mrs pearce
i think so indeed sir
here governor
ive took a sort of a fancy to you and
if you want the girl i aint so set
on avin her home again
but what i might be open to
is an arrangement
all i ask is my rights as a father
youre the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing
i can see youre a straight sort governor
so
whats a five pound note to you
an whats eliza to me
i think you should know doolittle
that mr higgins intentions
are entirely honorable
of course they are governor
if i thought they wasnt id ask 50
you mean youd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds
have you no morals man
no i cant afford em governor neither
could you if you was as poor as me
not that i mean any arm but
if eliza is gonna have a bit out o this
why not me too
why not
look at it my way what am l
i ask ya what am l im one
o the undeserving poor thats what i am
think what that means to a man
it means hes up against
middleclass morality for all the time
if theres anything goin an i ask
for a bit of it its always the same story
youre undeservin so you cant have it
but my needs is as great as the most
deservin widows that ever got money
out of six different charities in one week
for the death o the same usband
i dont need less than a deservin man
i need more
i dont eat less earty than he does
and i drink
a lot more
im playin straight with you
i aint pretendin to be deservin
no im undeservin
and i mean to go on bein undeservin
i like it an thats the truth
but will you take advantage
of a mans nature
do him out of the price of
his own daughter what hes brought up
fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow
till shes growed big enough
to be interestin to you two gentlemen
is five pounds unreasonable
i put it to you
and i leave it to you
you know pickering if we took this man
in hand for three months
he could choose between a seat in
the cabinet and a popular pulpit in wales
wed better give im a fiver
hell make bad use of it im afraid
not me governor so elp me i wont
just one good spree
for meself an the missus
givin pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others
an satisfaction to you to know
it aint been throwed away
you couldnt spend it better
this is irresistible lets give im ten
the missus wouldnt have the eart
to spend ten
ten pounds is a lot o money
makes a man feel prudentlike
and then goodbye to appiness
no you just give me what i ask governor
not a penny less not a penny more
i rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality
why dont you marry that missus of yours
after all marriage isnt so frightening
you married elizas mother
who told you that governor
well nobody told me
i concluded naturally
if we listen to this man for another minute
well have no convictions left
five pounds i think you said
thank you governor
are you sure you wont have ten
no no perhaps another time
i beg your pardon miss
i wont say those ruddy vowels
one more time
blimey its eliza
i never thought shed clean up
so goodlooking
she does me credit dont she
what are you doin here
now you hold your tongue and dont
you give these gentlemen none o your lip
if you have any trouble with er
give er a few licks o the strap
thats the way to improve er mind
well good morning gentlemen
cheerio eliza

imaginative
and musical mixtures of sounds

how do you do
miss doolittle
good afternoon professor higgins
the first race was very exciting
miss doolittle
im so sorry that you missed it
will it rain do you think
the rain in spain stays mainly
in the plain
but in hartford hereford and hampshire
hurricanes hardly ever happen
how awfully funny
what is wrong with that young man
i bet i got it right
smashing
has it suddenly turned chilly
i do hope we wont have
any unseasonable cold spells
they bring on so much influenza
and the whole of our family
is susceptible to it
my aunt died of influenza so they said
but its my belief they done
the old woman in
done her in
yes lord love you
why should she die of influenza
when shed come through diphtheria
right enough the year before
fairly blue with it she was
they all thought she was dead
but my father he kept ladling gin
down her throat
then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon
dear me
now what call would a woman
with that strength in her
have to die of influenza
and what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me
somebody pinched it
and what i say is
them as pinched it done her in
done her in done her in did you say
whatever does it mean
thats the new small talk
to do somebody in means to kill them
but you surely dont believe
your aunt was killed
do i not
them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin let alone a hat
but it cant have been right
for your father
to pour spirits down her throat like that
it might have killed her
not her gin was mothers milk to her
besides he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it
do you mean that he drank
drank my word something chronic
here what are you sniggering at
the new small talk
you do it so awfully well
well if i was doing it proper
what was you sniggering at
have i said anything i oughtnt
not at all my dear
well thats a mercy anyhow
i dont know if theres time
before the next race to place a bet
but come my dear
i have a bet on number seven
i should be so happy if you would take it
youll enjoy the race ever so much more
thats very kind of you
his name is dover

there they are again
lining up to run
now theyre holding steady
they are ready for it look
lt has begun
come on come on dover
come on
come on dover
come on
come on dover
move your bloomin arse
oh my dear
youre not serious henry you dont
expect to take her to the embassy ball
dont you think shes ready for it
dear henry shes ready for a canal barge
her language may need
a little refining but
really henry if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is
then you must be potty about her
i advise you to give up
and not put yourself
or this poor girl through any more
its the most fascinating venture
ive ever undertaken
pickering and i are at it from morning
till night it fills our whole lives
teaching eliza talking to eliza
listening to eliza dressing eliza
youre a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll
heres the car
good evening sir
is dinner ready im famished
immediately sir
good evening professor higgins
when she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon
she completely done me in
and my heart went on
a journey to the moon
when she told about her father
and the gin
and i never saw a more enchanting farce
than the moment when she shouted
move your bloomin
yes sir
is miss doolittle in
whom shall i say is calling
freddy eynsfordhill
if she doesnt remember who i am
tell her im the chap
who was sniggering at her
yes sir
and will you give her these
wouldnt you like to come in
theyre having dinner
but you may wait in the hall
no thank you i want to drink in
the street where she lives
l have often walked
down this street before
but the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before
all at once am i several stories high
knowing im on the street where you live
are there lilac trees in the heart of town
can you hear a lark
in any other part of town
does enchantment pour
out of every door
no its just on the street where you live
and oh the towering feeling
just to know somehow you are near
the overpowering feeling
that any second you may suddenly appear
people stop and stare
they dont bother me
for theres nowhere else on earth
that i would rather be
let the time go by
l wont care if i
can be here on the street where you live
im terribly sorry sir
miss doolittle says she doesnt want
to see anyone ever again
but why she was unbelievable
so ive been told sir
is there any further message
tell her that ill wait
but it might be days sir even weeks
but dont you see ill be happier here
people stop and stare
they dont bother me
for theres nowhere else on earth
that i would rather be
let the time go by
l wont care if i
can be here on the street where you live
it really is higgins
its inhuman to continue
do you realize what youve got to teach
this girl in six weeks
youve got to teach her to walk talk
address a duke a lord
a bishop an ambassador
its absolutely impossible
higgins im trying to tell you
that i want to call off the bet
i know youre a stubborn man but so am l
this experiment is over
and nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant
you understand higgins its over
higgins if theres any mishap
at the embassy tonight
if miss doolittle suffers
any embarrassment
itll be on your head alone
eliza can do anything
suppose shes discovered
remember ascot
suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake
therell be no horses at the ball pickering
think of how agonizing it would be
if anything happened tonight
i dont know what id do
you could always rejoin your regiment
this is no time for flippancy higgins
the way youve driven her
the last six weeks
has exceeded all bounds
of common decency
for gods sake stop pacing
cant you settle somewhere
have some port itll quieten your nerves
im not nervous
where is it
on the piano
the cars here sir
good tell miss doolittle
tell miss doolittle indeed
ill bet you that damned gown doesnt fit
i warned you about these french designers
we shouldve gone to an english shop
they wouldve been on our side
have a glass of port
no thank you
are you so sure this girl will retain
everything youve hammered into her
well we shall see
suppose she doesnt
i lose my bet
theres one thing i cant stand about you
your confounded complacency
at a moment like this
with so much at stake
its utterly indecent
that you dont need a glass of port
and what about the girl you act
as though she doesnt matter at all
rubbish pickering of course she matters
what do you think ive been doing
all these months
what could possibly matter more
than to take a human being
and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her
its filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class
and soul from soul
oh she matters immensely
miss doolittle you look beautiful
thank you colonel pickering
dont you think so higgins
not bad not bad at all
maestro maestro
dont you remember me
no who the devil are you
im your pupil your first your greatest
your best pupil
im zoltan karpathy that marvelous boy
i made your name famous
throughout europe
you teach me phonetics
you cant forget me
why dont you have your hair cut
i dont have your imposing appearance
your figure your brow
if i had my hair cut
nobody would notice me
where did you get these old coins
these are decorations for languages
the queen of transylvania is here
im indispensable to her
at these official international parties
i speak 32 languages
i know everyone in europe
no imposter can escape my detection
professor karpathy
the greek ambassador
greek my foot
he pretends not to know english
but he cant deceive me
hes the son of a yorkshire watchmaker
he speaks english so villainously
that he cannot utter a word
without betraying his origin
i help him pretend but make him pay
through the nose i make them all pay
excuse me sir you are wanted upstairs
her excellency asked for you
viscount and viscountess saxon
baron and baroness of yorkshire
sir guy and lady scotauckland
the count and countess demereau
the viscount and viscountess hillyard
mr and mrs richard lanser
lord and lady clanders
miss eliza doolittle colonel pickering
miss eliza doolittle colonel pickering
professor higgins
your excellency
miss doolittle
how do you do
good evening colonel
good evening
what an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening
well who is she
oh a cousin of mine and higgins
excuse me
professor higgins
such a faraway look
as if shes always lived in a garden
so she has a sort of garden
henry must take eliza home at once
theres a language expert here
sort of you know imposterologist
i beg you pardon
the young lady with colonel pickering
find out who she is
with pleasure
the whole situation is highly explosive
tell me zoltan
some more about the greek ambassador
gladly but first i would love you
to present me to this glorious creature
does he really come from yorkshire
her majesty the queen of transylvania
and his royal highness prince gregor
charming quite charming
miss doolittle madam
miss doolittle my son would like
to dance with you
absolutely fantastic
a lot of tomfoolery
it was an immense achievement
well mr higgins
a triumph mrs pearce a total triumph
higgins you were superb
absolutely superb
tell us the truth now werent you
a little bit nervous once or twice
not during the whole evening
not when i saw we were going to win
i felt like a bear in a cage hanging about
it was an immense achievement
if i hadnt backed myself to do it
id have given up two months ago
absolutely fantastic
yes a lot of tomfoolery
higgins i salute you
the silly people dont know
their own silly business
tonight old man you did it
you did it you did it
you said that you would do it
and indeed you did
l thought that you would rue it
i doubted youd do it
but now i must admit it
that succeed you did
you should get a medal
or be even made a knight
oh it was nothing really nothing
all alone you hurdled
every obstacle in sight
now wait now wait
give credit where its due
a lot of the glory goes to you
but youre the one who did it
who did it who did it
as sturdy as gibraltar
not a second did you falter
theres no doubt about it
you did it
l must have aged a year tonight
at times i thought id die of fright
never was there a momentary lull
shortly after we came in
i saw at once wed easily win
and after that i found it deadly dull
you should have heard
the oohs and aahs
everyone wondering who she was
youd think theyd never seen
a lady before
and when the prince of transylvania
asked to meet her
and gave his arm to lead her to the floor
l said to him you did it
you did it you did it
they thought she was ecstatic
and so damned aristocratic
and they never knew
that you
did it
thank goodness for zoltan karpathy
if it hadnt been for him
i wouldve died of boredom
karpathy that dreadful hungarian
was he there
yes he was there all right
and up to his old tricks
that blackguard
who uses the science of speech
more to blackmail and swindle than teach
he made it the devilish business of his
to find out who this miss doolittle is
every time we looked around
there he was
that hairy hound from budapest
never leaving us alone
never have i ever known
a ruder pest
finally i decided it was foolish
not to let him have his chance with her
so i stepped aside
and let him dance with her
oozing charm from every pore
he oiled his way around the floor
every trick that he could play
he used to strip her mask away
and when at last the dance was done
he glowed as if he knew hed won
and with a voice too eager
and a smile too broad
he announced to the hostess
that she was a fraud
no
her english is too good he said
that clearly indicates that she is foreign
whereas others are instructed
ln their native language
english people arent
although she may have studied with
an expert dialectician and grammarian
l can tell that she was born
hungarian
not only hungarian but of royal blood
she is a princess
her blood he said
ls bluer than the danube is or ever was
royalty is absolutely written on her face
she thought i was taken in
but actually i never was
how could she deceive
another member of her race
l know each language on the map
said he
and shes hungarian
as the first hungarian rhapsody

be anxious but its all over now
nothing more to worry about

all this irritation is purely subjective
i dont understand im too ignorant

im sure you wont have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other
i didnt quite realize you were going away
you might marry you know
you see eliza all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the colonel
most men are the marrying sort
poor devils
youre not badlooking
youre really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes
not now when youve been crying
you look like the very devil but
when youre all right and quite yourself
youre what i would call attractive
go to bed have a good rest
get up in the morning
and have a look at yourself in the glass
you wont feel so bad
i daresay my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well
we were above that at covent garden
what do you mean
i sold flowers i didnt sell myself
now youve made a lady of me
im not fit to sell anything else
oh tosh eliza
dont insult human relations
by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it
dont marry the fellow if you dont want to
what else am i to do
oh there are lots of things
what about the old idea of a florist shop
im sure pickeringd set you up in one
hes got lots of money
hell pay for all those togs youre wearing
and that with the hire of the jewelryll
make a big hole in 200 pounds
come on now youll be all right
well i must be off to bed
im really devilish sleepy
i was looking for something what was it
your slippers
oh yes of course you shied them at me
before you go sir
do my clothes belong to me
or to colonel pickering
what the devil use would they be
to pickering
why bother about that
in the middle of the night
what may i take away with me
i dont want to be accused of stealing
stealing
you shouldnt have said that
that shows a want of feeling
im sorry im a common ignorant girl
and in my station i have to be careful
there cant be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me
please will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesnt
take the whole damned houseful
if you want
except the jewelry thats hired
will that satisfy you
stop please
will you take these to your room
and keep them safe
i dont want to run the risk
of them being missed
hand them over lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler id
ld ram them down
your ungrateful throat
the ring isnt the jewelers
its the one you bought me in brighton
i dont want it now
dont you hit me
hit you you infamous creature
how dare you suggest such a thing
its you whove hit me
youve wounded me to the heart
im glad ive got a little
of my own back anyhow
youve caused me to lose my temper
thats hardly happened to me before
i dont wish to discuss it further tonight
im going to bed
leave your own note for mrs pearce
about the coffee
for it wont be done by me
damn mrs pearce
damn the coffee and damn you
damn my own folly for having lavished
my hardearned knowledge
and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe
just you wait enry lggins
just you wait
youll be sorry
but your tears will be too late
you will be the one its done to
and youll have no one to run to
just you wait
l have often walked
down this street before
but the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before
all at once am i several stories high
knowing im on the street where you live
are there lilac trees in the heart of town
can you hear a lark
in any other part of town
does enchantment pour
out of every door
no its just on the street where you live
and oh the towering feeling
just to know somehow you are near
the overpowering feeling
that any second you may suddenly appear
people stop and stare they dont

didnt she say where to send her clothes
i told you sir she took them all with her
heres a confounded thing elizas bolted
last night mrs pearce let her go
without telling me about it
whatll i do i got tea this morning
instead of coffee
i dont know where anything is
what my appointments are
elizad know
damn it shes gone
did either of you frighten her last night
we hardly said a word to her
you were there
did you bully her after i went to bed
she threw the slippers at me
i never gave her the slightest provocation
the slippers came at my head
before i uttered a word
she used the most disgraceful language
i was shocked i dont understand
we always gave her every consideration
she admitted it
im dashed
pickering for gods sake
stop being dashed and do something
phone the police what are they there for
you cant give elizas name to the police
as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella
but why not i want to find the girl
she belongs to me
i paid five pounds for her
quite right hello scotland yard please
get me some coffee would you please
scotland yard
this is colonel pickering speaking
27a wimpole street
i want to report a missing person
miss eliza doolittle
about 21
i should say about 5 foot 7
her eyes let me think now her eyes
brown
brown
her hair good lord
sort of a nondescript neutral sort of
brown brown brown
you heard what he said
brown brown brown yes
no this is her residence 27a
yes about between 300 and 400
this morning i understand
no shes no relation no
well lets call her a good friend shall we
i beg your pardon
listen to me i dont like the tenor
of that question
what the girl does here is our affair
your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it
well im dashed
what in heaven
could have prompted her to go
after such a triumph at the ball
what could have depressed her
what could have possessed her
i cannot understand the wretch at all
higgins i have an old school chum
at the home office perhaps he could help
think ill give him a ring
whitehall 7244 please
women are irrational
thats all there is to that
their heads are full of
cotton hay and rags
theyre nothing but exasperating
lrritating vacillating calculating
agitating maddening
and infuriating hags
i want to speak
to mr brewster budgin please
yes ill wait
pickering why cant a woman
be more like a man
i beg your pardon
yes why cant a woman
be more like a man
men are so honest so thoroughly square
eternally noble historically fair
who when you win
will always give your back a pat
why cant a woman be like that
why does every one do
what the others do
cant a woman learn to use her head
why do they do everything
their mothers do
why dont they grow up
well like their father instead
why cant a woman take after a man
men are so pleasant so easy to please
whenever youre with them
youre always at ease
would you be slighted
lf i didnt speak for hours
would you be livid
lf i had a drink or two
would you be wounded
lf i never sent you flowers
well why cant a woman be like you
one man in a million may shout a bit
now and then
theres one with slight defects
one perhaps whose truthfulness
you doubt a bit
but by and large
we are a marvelous sex
why cant a woman take after a man
cause men are so friendly
goodnatured and kind
a better companion
you never will find
lf i were hours late for dinner
would you bellow
lf i forgot your silly birthday
would you fuss
would you complain
lf i took out another fellow
well why cant a woman be like us
is mr brewster budgin there
bruzzie youll never guess who this is
youre quite right it is good heavens
by george what a memory
how are you bruzzie
nice to hear your voice
what you dont say
has it really been 30 years bruzzie
right yes oceans of water
listen bruzzie ill tell you why i rang up
something rather unpleasant
has happened could i come and see you
i could yes now straight away
right good thank you
goodbye bruzzie thank you very much
mrs pearce im going along
to the home office
i do hope you find her colonel pickering
mr higgins will miss her
mr higgins will miss her eh
blast mr higgins ill miss her
mrs pearce
yes sir
wheres the colonel
hes gone to the home office sir
there you are im disturbed and he runs
for help now theres a good fellow
mrs pearce youre a woman
why cant a woman be more like a man
men are so decent
such regular chaps
ready to help you
through any mishaps
ready to buck you up
whenever you are glum
why cant a woman be a chum
why is thinking
something women never do
and why is logic never even tried
straightening up their hair
ls all they ever do
why dont they straighten up
the mess thats inside
why cant a woman behave like a man
lf i was a woman
whod been to a ball
been hailed as a princess
by one and by all
would i start weeping
like a bathtub overflowing
or carry on as if my home were in a tree
would i run off
and never tell me where im going
why cant a woman be like me
you mean that after youd done
this wonderful thing for them
without making a mistake
they just sat there
and never said a word
never petted you or admired you
or told you how splendid youd been
not a word
they just congratulated each other
on how marvelous theyd been
the next moment how glad they were
it was all over
and what a bore it had all been
this is appalling i should not
have thrown my slippers at him
i should have thrown the fire irons
whos that
henry i knew it wouldnt be too long
now remember
you not only danced with a prince
last night you behaved like a princess
mother the most confounded thing
do you
you
good afternoon professor higgins
are you quite well
of course you are you are never ill
would you care for some tea
dont you dare try that game on me
i taught it to you
get up come home and stop being a fool
youve caused me enough trouble
very nicely put indeed henry
no woman could resist such an invitation
how did this baggage get here
eliza came to see me this morning
and i was delighted to have her
if you dont promise to behave yourself
ill ask you to leave
im to put on my sunday manners
for this
thing that i created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of covent garden
thats precisely what i mean
ill see her damned first
however did you learn good manners
with my son around
it was very difficult i should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave
if it hadnt been for colonel pickering
he showed me that he felt
and thought about me
as if i were something better
than a common flower girl
you see mrs higgins
apart from the things one can pick up
the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isnt how she behaves
but how she is treated
ill always be a flower girl
to professor higgins
because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will
ill always be a lady to colonel pickering
because he always treats me
as a lady and always will
henry dont grind your teeth
the bishop is here
shall i show him into the garden
the bishop and the professor
good heavens no
i should be excommunicated
ill see him in the library
eliza if my son starts breaking up things
l give you full permission
to have him evicted
henry i suggest you stick to two subjects
the weather and your health
youve had a bit of your own back
as you say
have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more
you want me back to pick up
your slippers
and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you
i didnt say i wanted you back at all
then what are we talking about
well about you not about me
if you come back youll be treated
as you always have
i cant change my nature or my manners
my manners are exactly
the same as colonel pickerings
thats not true he treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess
i treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl
i see the same to everybody
the great secret is not a question
of good manners
or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner
but having the same manner
for all human souls
the question is not
whether i treat you rudely
but whether youve ever heard me
treat anyone else better
i dont care how you treat me
i dont mind your swearing at me
i shouldnt mind a black eye
ive had one before this
but i wont be passed over
get out of my way
for i wont stop for you
you talk about me as though
i was a motorbus
so you are a motorbus all bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody
but i can get along without you
dont you think i cant
i know you can i told you you could
youve never wondered i suppose
whether
whether i could get along without you
dont you try to get around me
youll have to
so i can without you or any soul on earth
i shall miss you eliza ive learned
something from your idiotic notions
i confess that humbly and gratefully
well you have my voice
on your gramophone
when you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on it has no feelings to hurt
well i cant turn your soul on
you are a devil
you can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily
as some can twist her arms to hurt her
what am i to come back for
for the fun of it thats why i took you on
you may throw me out tomorrow
if i dont do everything you want
yes and you may walk out tomorrow
if i dont do everything you want
and live with my father
yes or sell flowers
would you rather marry pickering
i wouldnt marry you if you asked me
and youre nearer my age then what he is
than he is
ill talk as i like youre not my teacher
thats not what i want
and dont you think it is
ive always had chaps enough
wanting me that way
freddy hill writes me twice
and three times a day sheets and sheets
in short you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is is that it
no i dont thats not the sort of feeling
i want from you
i want a little kindness
i know im a common ignorant girl
and youre a booklearned gentleman
but im not dirt under your feet
what i donewhat i did was not
for the taxis and the dresses
but because we were pleasant together
and i come tocame
to care for you
not to want you to make love to me
and not forgetting the difference
between us but
more friendly like
well of course thats how i feel
and how pickering feels
eliza youre a fool
thats not the proper answer
its the only answer
till you stop being an idiot
to be a lady you must stop
feeling neglected
if men dont spend half their time
sniveling over you
and the other half giving you black eyes
you find me cold unfeeling selfish
dont you
off with you to the sort of people you like
marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money
and thick lips to kiss you
and thick boots to kick you
if you cant appreciate what you have
then get what you can appreciate
i cant talk to you
you always turn everything against me
im always in the wrong
dont be too sure you have me
under your feet
to be trampled on and talked down
ill marry freddy i will
as soon as im able to support him
the poor devil who couldnt get a job
as an errand boy
even if he had the guts to try
dont you understand
i have made you a consort for a king
freddy loves me
that makes him king enough for me
i dont want him to work
he wasnt brought up to do it as i was
ill go and be a teacher
whatll you teach in heavens name
what you taught me ill teach phonetics
ill offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant hungarian
what that imposter that humbug
that toadying ignoramus
teach him my methods my discoveries
you take one step in that direction
ill wring your neck
wring away what do i care
i knew youd strike me one day
thats done you enry lggins it as
now i dont care for your bullyin
an your big talk
what a fool i was
what a dominated fool
to think you were the earth and sky
what a fool i was
what an addlepated fool
what a muttonheaded dolt was i
no my reverberating friend
you are not the beginning and the end
you impudent hussy
theres not an idea in your head or a word
in your mouth that i havent put there
therell be spring every year without you
england still will be here without you
therell be fruit on the tree
and a shore by the sea
therell be crumpets and tea without you
art and music will thrive without you
somehow keats will survive without you
and there still will be rain
on that plain down in spain
even that will remain without you
l can do
without you
you dear friend
who talk so well
you can go to
hartford hereford and hampshire
they can still rule the land without you
windsor castle will stand without you
and without much ado
we can all muddle through
without you
you brazen hussy
without your pulling it the tide comes in
without your twirling it the earth can spin
without your pushing them
the clouds roll by
lf they can do without you ducky
so can i
l shall not feel alone without you
l can stand on my own without you
so go back in your shell
i can do bloody well
by george i really did it
i did it i did it
l said id make a woman and indeed i did
l knew that i could do it
i knew it i knew it
l said id make a woman
and succeed i did
eliza youre magnificent
five minutes ago you were
a millstone around my neck
and now youre a tower of strength
a consort battleship
i like you this way
goodbye professor higgins
you shall not be seeing me again
mother
what is it henry whats happened
shes gone
well of course dear
what did you expect
what am i to do
do without i suppose
and so i shall
if the higgins oxygen burns up
her little lungs
let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her
shes an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine
let her go i can do without her
i can do without anyone
i have my own soul
my own spark of divine fire
bravo eliza
damn damn damn damn
lve grown accustomed to her face
she almost makes the day begin
lve grown accustomed to the tune
that she whistles night and noon
her smiles her frowns
her ups her downs
are second nature to me now
like breathing out and breathing in
l was serenely independent and content
before we met
surely i could always be that way again
and yet ive grown
accustomed to her looks
accustomed to her voice
accustomed to her face
marry freddy
what an infantile idea what a heartless
wicked brainless thing to do
but shell regret it shell regret it
its doomed before they even take the vow
l can see her now
mrs freddy eynsfordhill
ln a wretched little flat above a store
l can see her now not a penny in the till
and a bill collector beating at the door
shell try to teach the things i taught her
and end up selling flowers instead
begging for her bread and water
while her husband has
his breakfast in bed
ln a year or so
when shes prematurely gray
and the blossom in her cheek
has turned to chalk
shell come home and lo
hell have upped and run away
with a socialclimbing heiress
from new york
poor eliza
how simply frightful
how humiliating
how delightful
how poignant it will be
on that inevitable night
when she hammers on my door
ln tears and rags
miserable and lonely
repentant and contrite
will i take her in
or hurl her to the wolves
give her kindness
or the treatment she deserves
will i take her back
or throw the baggage out
well im a most forgiving man
the sort who never could ever would
take a position
and staunchly never budge
a most forgiving man
but i shall never take her back
lf she were crawling on her knees
let her promise to atone
let her shiver let her moan
lll slam the door
and let the hellcat freeze
marry freddy
but im so used to hear her say
good morning every day
her joys her woes
her highs her lows
are second nature to me now
like breathing out and breathing in
lm very grateful shes a woman
and so easy to forget
rather like a habit one can always break
and yet ive grown
accustomed to the trace
of something in the air
accustomed to her face
oh we are proud he aint above
givin lessons not im i eard im say so
i aint come here to ask
for any compliment
and if my moneys not good enough
i can go elsewhere
good enough for what
good enough for you
now you know dont ya
im come to ave lessons
and to pay for em too
make no mistake
what do you want my girl
i want to be a lady in a flowr shop
stead o sellin
at the corner of tottenham court road
but they wont take me unless i can talk
more genteel he said he could teach me
well ere i am ready to pay not askin
any favor and he treats me as if i was dirt
i know what lessons cost as well as you do
and im ready to pay
i wont give more than a shillin
take it or leave it
its almost irresistible
shes so deliciously low
so horribly dirty ill take it
