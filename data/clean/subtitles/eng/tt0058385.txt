really  sir  if you are a detective   
   you needn t protect me
against molestation from young women   
   until i ask you 
anyone could tell the girl meant no harm 
he ain t no tec  he s a gentleman 
look at his boots 
how are all your people down at selsey 
who told you my people

how do you come to be up so far east 
you were born in lisson grove 
what  arm is there
in my leavin  lisson grove 
it weren t fit for pigs to live 
i had to pay four and six a week 
live where you like but stop that noise 
come  come  he can t touch you 
you ve a right to live where you please 
i m a good girl  i am 
 where do i come from 
 hawkestone 
who said i didn t 
blimey  you know everything  you do

madam  it s stopped raining

if you wanta go fortune telling 
cheltenham  harrow   
   cambridge and   
   lndia 
quite right 
he ain t a tec  he s a bloomin  busybody 
do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall 
i have thought of it 
perhaps i will one day 
he s no gentleman  he ain t 
to interfere with a poor girl 
how do you do it  may i ask 
simple phonetics  the science of speech 
that s my profession  also my hobby 
anyone can spot an lrishman
or a yorkshireman by his brogue   
   but i can place a man within six miles 
i can place  im within two miles in london 
sometimes within two streets 
ought to be ashamed of  imself 
unmanly coward 
 is there a living in that 
 oh  yes 
let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone 
cease this detestable
boohooing instantly   
   or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship 
i have a right to be here if i like 
same as you 
a woman who utters such disgusting 
depressing noises   
   has no right to be anywhere 
no right to live 
remember  you re a human with a soul   
   and the divine gift of articulate speech 
your native language is the language
of shakespeare and   
   milton and the bible  don t sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon 
  look at her  a prisoner of the gutters
  condemned by every syllable she utters
  by right she should be taken out and hung
  for the cold blooded murder
of the english tongue  
heavens  what a sound 
  this is what the british population
  calls an elementary education  
come  sir  i think you ve picked
a poor example 
did l 
  hear them down in soho square
dropping h s everywhere
  speaking english any way they like
  hey  you  sir  did you go to school 
  what ya tike me for  a fool 
  no one taught him  take  instead of  tike 
  hear a yorkshireman  or worse
hear a cornishman converse
  l d rather hear a choir singing flat
  chickens cackling in a barn
just like this one
  garn 
  garn 
  l ask you  sir  what sort of word is that 
  lt s  aoow  and  garn 
that keep her in her place
  not her wretched clothes and dirty face
  why can t the english
teach their children how to speak 
  this verbal class distinction
by now should be antique
  lf you spoke as she does  sir 
instead of the way you do
  why  you might be selling flowers  too  
i beg your pardon 
  an englishman s way of speaking
absolutely classifies him
  the moment he talks he makes
some other englishman despise him
  one common language
i m afraid we ll never get
  oh  why can t the english learn to   
     set a good example to people
whose english is painful to your ears
  the scotch and the lrish
leave you close to tears
  there even are places
where english completely disappears
  why  in america
they haven t used it for years 
  why can t the english
teach their children how to speak 
  norwegians learn norwegian 
the greeks are taught their greek
  ln france every frenchman
knows his language from  a  to  z 
  the french don t care
what they do actually
  as long as they pronounce it properly
  arabians learn arabian
with the speed of summer lightning
  the hebrews learn it backwards
which is absolutely frightening
  use proper english 
you re regarded as a freak
  oh  why can t the english
  why can t the english learn to speak   
thank you

till the end of her days

who wants to see you  sir 
a young woman 
what does she want 
she s quite a common girl  sir 
very common indeed 
i should ve sent her away  only i thought   
   you wanted her to talk
into your machine 
 has she an interesting accent 
 simply ghastly 
good  let s have her in

this is rather a bit of luck 
i ll show you how i make records 
we ll set her talking  then i ll take
her down first in bell s visible speech   
   then in broad romic 
then we ll get her on the phonograph   
   so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you 
this is the young woman  sir 
good mornin   my good man

be off with you  i don t want you 
don t be so saucy 
you ain t  eard what i come for yet 
did you tell  im i come in a taxi 
nonsense  do you think a gentleman
like mr  higgins cares   
   what you came in 
oh  we are proud 
he ain t above givin  lessons  not  im 
i  eard  im say so 
i ain t come here to ask
for any compliment   
   and if my money s not good enough 
i can go elsewhere 
good enough for what 
good enough for you 
now you know  don t ya 
i m come to  ave lessons 
and to pay for  em  too  make no mistake 
well 
and what do you expect me to say 
well  if you was a gentleman 
you might ask me to sit down  i think 
don t i tell you i m bringin  you business 
should we ask this baggage to sit down   
   or shall we just throw her
out of the window 
i won t be called a baggage 
not when i ve offered to pay like any lady 
what do you want  my girl 
i want to be a lady in a flow r shop   
    stead of sellin  at the corner
of tottenham court road 
but they won t take me
unless i can talk more genteel 
he said  e could teach me 
well   ere i am ready to pay  im 
not asking any favor
and he treats me as if i was dirt 
i know what lessons cost as well as you do
and i m ready to pay 
how much 
now you re talkin  
i thought you d come off it
for a chance to get back   
   a bit of what you chucked
at me last night 
you d had a drop in   adn t you 
sit down 
 if you re goin  t  make a compliment of it  
 sit down 
sit down  girl  do as you re told 
what s your name 
eliza doolittle 
won t you sit down  miss doolittle 
i don t mind if i do 
how much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons 
oh  i know what s right 
my lady friend gets french lessons
for 18 pence an hour   
   from a real french gentleman 
you wouldn t have the face
to ask me the same   
   for teachin  me my own language
as you would for french 
i won t give more than a shillin  
take it or leave it 
do you know  pickering 
if you think of a shilling   
   not as a simple shilling 
but as a percentage of this girl s income   
   it works out as fully equivalent of   
   60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire 
by george  it s enormous 
it s the biggest offer i ever had 
sixty pounds  what are you talkin  about 
where would i get 60 pounds 
 i never offered you 60 pounds 
 hold your tongue 
but i ain t got 60 pounds 
don t cry  silly girl  sit down 
nobody s going to touch your money 
somebody ll touch you with a broomstick
if you don t stop sniveling 
sit down 
anybody d think you was my father 
if i decide to teach you 
i ll be worse than two fathers to you 
here 
what s this for 
to wipe your eyes  to wipe any part
of your face that feels moist 
remember  that s your handkerchief
and that s your sleeve 
don t confuse one with the other 
if you want to become a lady in a shop 
it s no use to talk to her like that 
she doesn t understand you 
give the  andkerchief to me 
he give it to me  not to you 
higgins  i m interested 
what about your boast   
   you could pass her off as a duchess
at the embassy ball 
i ll say you re the greatest teacher alive
if you do that 
i ll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can t do it 
i ll even pay for the lessons 
you re real good  thank ye  capt n 
it s almost irresistible 
she s so deliciously low 
so horribly dirty 
i ain t dirty  i washed my face an  hands
before i come  i did 
i ll take it  i ll make a duchess
of this draggle tailed guttersnipe 
we ll start today  this moment 
take her away and clean her 
sandpaper  if it won t come off 
is there a fire in the kitchen 
take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones 
just wrap her in brown paper
till they come 
you re no gentleman  you re not 
to talk o  such things 
i m a good girl  i am 
and i know what the likes of you are  i do 
we want none of your slum prudery here 
young woman 
you ve got to learn to behave
like a duchess 
take her away  mrs  pearce 
if she gives you any trouble  wallop her 
i ll call the police  i will 
i ve got no place to put her 
well  put her in the dustbin 
come  higgins  be reasonable 
you must be reasonable 
mr  higgins  you must 
you can t walk over everybody like this 
i 
walk over everybody 
my dear mrs  pearce  my dear pickering 
i had no intention of walking over anybody 
i merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl 
i didn t express myself clearly
because i didn t wish to hurt her delicacy   
   or yours 
but  sir  you can t take a girl up like that   
   as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach 
why not 
why not  but you don t know
anything about her 
what about her parents 
she may be married 
garn 
there  as the girl
very properly says    garn    
who d marry me 
by george  eliza   
   the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men   
   shooting themselves for your sake
before i m done with you 
i m goin  
he s off his chump  he is 
i don t want no balmies teachin  me 
mad  all right  mrs  pearce 
don t order those new clothes 
 throw her out 
 stop  i won t allow it 
go home to your parents  girl 
i ain t got no parents 
she ain t got no parents  what s the fuss 
nobody wants her  she s no use
to anyone but me  take her upstairs 
what s to become of her 
ls she to be paid anything 
do be sensible  sir 
what d she do with money 
she ll have food and clothes 
she ll drink if you give her money 
you are a brute  it s a lie 
nobody ever saw the sign o  liquor on me 
sir  you re a gentleman 
don t let  im speak to me like that 
does it occur to you  higgins 
the girl has some feelings 
no  i don t think so 
no feelings we need worry about 
well  have you  eliza 
i got me feelings same as anyone else 
mr  higgins  i must know on what terms
the girl is to be here 
what ll become of her
when you ve finished teaching 
you must look ahead a little  sir 
what ll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter  mrs  pearce 
that s her own business 
not yours  mr  higgins 
when i m done  we ll throw her back 
then it ll be her own business again 
that ll be all right  won t it 
you ve no feelin   eart in ya 
you don t care for nothin  but yourself 
i ve  ad enough of this  i m goin  
you ought to be ashamed of yourself 
have some chocolates  eliza 
 ow do i know what might be in  em 
i ve  eard of girls bein  drugged
by the likes o  you 
pledge of good faith 
i ll take one half 
and you take the other 
you ll have boxes of them 
barrels of them every day 
you ll live on them  eh 
i wouldn t  ve ate it  only i m too ladylike
to take it out o  me mouth 
think of it  eliza 
think of chocolates  and taxis   
   and gold and diamonds 
i don t want no gold and no diamonds 
i m a good girl  i am 
higgins  i really must interfere 
mrs  pearce is quite right 
if this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months   
   for an experiment in teaching  she must
understand thoroughly what she s doing 
you are to stay here
for the next six months   
   learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop 
if you re good and do what you re told 
you ll sleep in a proper bedroom   
   have lots to eat  money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis 
but if you are naughty and idle   
   you ll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles   
   and be walloped by mrs  pearce
with a broomstick 
at the end of six months 
you shall be taken to buckingham palace   
   in a carriage  beautifully dressed 
if the king finds out
that you are not a lady   
   the police will take you to the tower
of london where your head will be cut off   
   as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls 
but if you are not found out 
you shall have a present of   
   seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop 
if you refuse this offer   
   you will be the most ungrateful 
wicked girl   
   and the angels will weep for you 
are you satisfied  pickering 
i don t understand
what you re talking about 
could i put it more plainly or fairly 
mrs  pearce 
come with me 
that s right 
bundle her off to the bathroom 
you re a great bully  you are 
i won t stay here if i don t like it 
i won t let nobody wallop me 
don t answer back  girl 
i ve always been a good girl  i  ave 
in six months   in three 
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue   
   l ll take her anywhere
and i ll pass her off as anything 
i ll make a queen of that barbarous wretch 
i ve never had a bath in me life 
not what you d call a proper one 
you know you can t be a nice girl inside
if you re dirty outside 
i ll have to put you in here 
this will be your bedroom 
i couldn t sleep in here  missus 
it s too good for the likes o  me 
i should be afraid to touch anythin  
i ain t a duchess yet  you know 
what s this 
this where you wash clothes 
this is where we wash ourselves  eliza 
and where i m going to wash you 
you expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over 
not me 
i shall catch me death 
come along now 
come along 
take your clothes off 
come on  girl  do as you re told 
take your clothes off 
here  come on  help me take these  
take your hands off me 
i m a good girl  i am 
it ain t right  it ain t decent 
get your hands off me 
i m a good girl  i am 
forgive the bluntness 
but if i m to be in this business   
   l shall feel responsible for the girl 
i hope it s clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position 
what  that thing  sacred  i assure you 
come now  you know what i mean 
this is no trifling matter 
are you a man of good character
where women are concerned 
have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned 
yes  very frequently 
i haven t  the moment i let a woman
make friends with me   
   she becomes jealous  exacting   
   suspicious and a damned nuisance 
the moment that i make friends with
a woman i become selfish and tyrannical 
so here i am  a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so 
well  after all  pickering    
  l m an ordinary man
  who desires nothing more
  than just an ordinary chance
  to live exactly as he likes
  and do precisely what he wants
  an average man  am i
  of no eccentric whim
  who likes to live his life
  free of strife
  doing whatever he thinks is best for him
  oh  just an ordinary man
  but let a woman in your life
  and your serenity is through
  she ll redecorate your home
from the cellar to the dome
  then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you 
  let a woman in your life
  and you are up against a wall
  make a plan and you will find
she has something else in mind
  so rather than do either
you do something else that neither
  likes at all 
  you want to talk of keats or milton
  she only wants to talk of love
  you go to see a play or ballet
  and spend it searching for her glove
  let a woman in your life
  and you invite eternal strife
  let them buy their wedding bands
  for those anxious little hands
  l d be equally as willing
for a dentist to be drilling
  than to ever let a woman in my life 
  l m a very gentle man
  even tempered and good natured
whom you never hear complain
  who has the milk of human kindness
by the quart in every vein
  a patient man am i
down to my fingertips
  the sort who never could
ever would
  let an insulting remark escape his lips
  a very gentle man
  but let a woman in your life
  and patience hasn t got a chance
  she will beg you for advice
your reply will be concise
  and she ll listen very nicely
  then go out and do precisely
what she wants 
  you were a man of grace and polish
  who never spoke above a hush
  now all at once you re using language
  that would make a sailor blush
  let a woman in your life
  and you re plunging in a knife 
  let the others of my sex
  tie the knot around their necks
  l d prefer a new edition
of the spanish lnquisition
  than to ever let a woman in my life
  l m a quiet living man
  who prefers to spend the evenings
  ln the silence of his room
  who likes an atmosphere as restful
  as an undiscovered tomb
  a pensive man am i
of philosophic joys
  who likes to meditate  contemplate
  free from humanity s mad  inhuman noise
  a quiet living man
  but let a woman in your life
  and your sabbatical is through
  ln a line that never ends
come an army of her friends
  come to jabber and to chatter
and to tell her
  what the matter is with you 
  she ll have a booming  boisterous family
  who will descend on you en masse
  she ll have a large  wagnerian mother
  with a voice that shatters glass 
  let a woman in your life
  l shall never let a woman   
     in my life

doolittle  sir 
 professor higgins 
 here 
where 
good morning  governor 
i come about a very serious matter 
governor 
brought up in houndslow 
mother welsh  i should think 
what is it you want  doolittle 
i want my daughter  that s what i want 
see 
of course you do 
you re her father  aren t you 
i m glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left 
she s in there  yes  take her away at once 
what 
take her away  do you think i am going
to keep your daughter for you 
now  is this reasonable  governor 
is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that 
the girl belongs to me  you got  er 
where do i come in 
how dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me 
you sent her here on purpose 
don t take a man up like that  governor 
the police shall take you up 
this is a plan   
   a plot to extort money by threats 
i shall telephone the police 
have i asked you for a brass farthin  
i leave it to this gentleman  ere 
have i said a word about money 
well  what else did you come for 
what would a bloke come for 
be  uman  governor 
alfred  you sent her here on purpose 
so help me  governor  i never did 
how did you know she was here 
i d tell you  governor 
if you d let me get a word in 
i m willing to tell ya 
i m wanting to tell ya 
i m waiting to tell ya 
you know  pickering  this chap s got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric 
observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild 
  l m willing to tell you  i m wanting
to tell you  i m waiting to tell you   
that s the welsh strain in  im 
how did you know eliza was here
if you didn t send  er 
well  she sent back for her luggage
and i got to  ear about it 
she said she didn t want no clothes 
what was i to think from that  governor 
i ask you  as a parent  what was i to think 
so you came here to rescue her
from worse than death  eh 
 yes  sir  governor  that s right 
 yes 
mrs  pearce 
eliza s father has come to take her away 
give her to him  will you 
now wait a minute  governor 
wait a minute 
you and me is men o  the world  ain t we 
men of the world  are we 
perhaps you d better go  mrs  pearce 
i think so indeed  sir 
here  governor 
i ve took a sort of a fancy to you and   
   if you want the girl  i ain t so set
on  avin  her home again   
   but what i might be open to
is an arrangement 
all i ask is my rights as a father 
you re the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing 
i can see you re a straight sort  governor 
so   
   what s a five pound note to you 
an  what s eliza to me 
i think you should know  doolittle   
   that mr  higgins  intentions
are entirely honorable 
of course they are  governor 
if i thought they wasn t  i d ask 50 
you mean  you d sell your daughter
for 50 pounds 
have you no morals  man 
no  i can t afford  em  governor  neither
could you if you was as poor as me 
not that i mean any  arm  but   
   if eliza is gonna have a bit out o  this 
why not me  too 
why not 
look at it my way  what am l 
i ask ya  what am l  i m one
o  the undeserving poor  that s what i am 
think what that means to a man 
it means he s up against
middle class morality for all the time 
if there s anything goin  an  i ask
for a bit of it  it s always the same story 
  you re undeservin   so you can t have it   
but my needs is as great as the most
deservin  widows that ever got money   
   out of six different charities in one week
for the death o  the same  usband 
i don t need less than a deservin  man 
i need more 
i don t eat less  earty than he does
and i drink   
   a lot more 
i m playin  straight with you 
i ain t pretendin  to be deservin  
no  i m undeservin    
   and i mean to go on bein  undeservin  
i like it an  that s the truth 
but will you take advantage
of a man s nature   
   do him out of the price of
his own daughter  what he s brought up   
   fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow   
   till she s growed big enough
to be interestin  to you two gentlemen 
is five pounds unreasonable 
i put it to you 
and i leave it to you 
you know  pickering  if we took this man
in hand for three months   
   he could choose between a seat in
the cabinet and a popular pulpit in wales 
 we d better give  im a fiver 
 he ll make bad use of it  i m afraid 
not me  governor  so  elp me i won t 
just one good spree
for meself an  the missus   
   givin  pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others 
an  satisfaction to you to know
it ain t been throwed away 
you couldn t spend it better 
this is irresistible  let s give  im ten 
the missus wouldn t have the  eart
to spend ten 
ten pounds is a lot o  money 
makes a man feel prudent like 
and then goodbye to  appiness 
no  you just give me what i ask  governor 
not a penny less  not a penny more 
i rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality 
why don t you marry that missus of yours 
after all  marriage isn t so frightening 
you married eliza s mother 
who told you that  governor 
well  nobody told me 
i concluded  naturally    
if we listen to this man for another minute
we ll have no convictions left 
 five pounds  i think you said 
 thank you  governor 
are you sure you won t have ten 
no  no  perhaps another time 
i beg your pardon  miss 
i won t say those ruddy vowels
one more time 
blimey  it s eliza 
i never thought she d clean up
so good looking 
she does me credit  don t she 
what are you doin  here 
now  you hold your tongue and don t
you give these gentlemen none o  your lip 
if you have any trouble with  er 
give  er a few licks o  the strap 
that s the way to improve  er mind 
well  good morning  gentlemen 
cheerio  eliza 
there s a man for you 
a philosophical genius of the first water 
write to mr  ezra wallingford
and tell him   
   if he wants a lecturer  to get in touch
with mr  doolittle   
   a common dustman  one of
the most original moralists in england 
what did he come for 
say your vowels 
i know me vowels 
i knew  em before i come 
if you know them  say them 
ahyee  e  iyee  ow  you 
a  e  l  o  u 
that s what i said  ahyee  e  iyee  ow  you 
that s what i ve said for three days
an  i won t no more 
i know it s difficult  miss doolittle 
but try to understand 
there s no use explaining 
as a military man you should know that 
drilling is what she needs 
leave her alone or she ll turn to you
for sympathy 
very well  if you insist 
but have a little patience with her 
of course 
say   a   
you ain t got no  eart  you ain t 
i promise you  you ll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out   
   or there ll be no lunch 
no dinner  and no chocolates 
  just you wait   enry  lggins
just you wait
  you ll be sorry
but your tears will be too late
  you ll be broke and i ll have money
will i help you  don t be funny 
  just you wait   enry  lggins
just you wait
  just you wait   enry  lggins
till you re sick
  and you screams
to fetch a doctor double quick
  l ll be off a second later
and go straight to the theater
  ho  ho  ho   enry  lggins
just you wait 
  just you wait
until we re swimmin  in the sea
  and you get the cramp
a little ways from me
  when you yell you re gonna drown
i ll get dressed and go to town
  just you wait 
  one day i ll be famous
i ll be proper and prim
  go to st  james so often
i will call it st  jim
  one evening the king will say
 oh  liza  old thing
   l want all of england your praises to sing
   next week on the 20th of may
   l proclaim liza doolittle day
   all the people will celebrate
the glory of you
   and whatever you wish and want
i gladly will do 
   thanks a lot  king   says i
in a manner well bred
   but all i want is  enry  lggins   ead 
   done  
  says the king with a stroke
   guard  run and bring in the bloke 
  then they ll march you   enry  lggins 
to the wall
  and the king will tell me 
   liza  sound the call 
  as they raise their rifles higher
  l ll shout   ready  aim  fire  
  ho  ho  ho   enry  lggins  down you go
  just you wait    
all right  eliza  say it again 
  the rine in spine   
     stais minely in the pline   
  the rain in spain
stays mainly in the plain   
didn t i saiy that 
no  eliza  you didn t   saiy   that 
you didn t even   say   that 
every night before you go to bed 
where you used to say your prayers   
   l want you to say 
  the rain in spain
stays mainly in the plain   
fifty times 
you ll get much further with the lord
if you learn not to offend his ears 
now for your   h s   
pickering  this is going to be ghastly 
control yourself  higgins 
give the girl a chance 
i suppose you can t expect her
to get it right the first time 
come here  eliza  and watch closely 
now  you see that flame 
every time you pronounce the letter   h  
correctly the flame will waver   
   and every time you drop your   h  
the flame will remain stationary 
that s how to know
you ve done it correctly 
in time  your ear will hear the difference 
you ll see it better in the mirror 
now listen carefully 
  ln hartford  hereford and hampshire   
     hurricanes hardly ever happen   
now you repeat that after me 
  ln hartford  hereford and hampshire 
hurricanes hardly ever happen   
  ln  artford   ereford and  ampshire
 urricanes  ardly hever  appen   
oh  no  no 
have you no ear at all 
 should i do it over 
 no  please 
start from the very beginning 
just do this 
go on  go on 
does the same thing hold true in lndia 
have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter   
   but using it where it doesn t belong 
like   hever   instead of   ever   
the girl  higgins 
go on  go on 
  poor professor higgins
  poor professor higgins

i can t understand a word  not a word 
  with blackest moss  the flower pots

the noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men

imaginative   
   and musical mixtures of sounds 
and that s what you ve set yourself
out to conquer  eliza

where the devil can they be 
colonel pickering 
you re just in time for tea 
thank you  mrs  higgins 
may i introduce miss eliza doolittle 
my dear miss doolittle 
how kind of you to let me come

 lady boxington

miss doolittle 
good afternoon  professor higgins 
the first race was very exciting 
miss doolittle 
i m so sorry that you missed it 
will it rain  do you think 
  the rain in spain stays mainly
in the plain   
  but in hartford  hereford and hampshire 
hurricanes hardly ever happen   
how awfully funny 
what is wrong with that  young man 
i bet i got it right 
smashing 
has it suddenly turned chilly 
i do hope we won t have
any unseasonable cold spells 
they bring on so much influenza 
and the whole of our family
is susceptible to it 
my aunt died of influenza  so they said 
but it s my belief they done
the old woman in 
done her in 
yes  lord love you 
why should she die of influenza   
   when she d come through diphtheria
right enough the year before 
fairly blue with it she was 
they all thought she was dead 
but my father  he kept ladling gin
down her throat 
then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon 
dear me 
now what call would a woman
with that strength in her   
   have to die of influenza 
and what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me 
somebody pinched it 
and what i say is 
them  as pinched it  done her in 
done her in    done her in    did you say 
whatever does it mean 
that s the new small talk 
  to do somebody in   means to kill them 
but you surely don t believe
your aunt was killed 
do i not 
them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin  let alone a hat 
but it can t have been right
for your father   
   to pour spirits down her throat like that 
it might have killed her 
not her  gin was mother s milk to her 
besides  he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it 
do you mean that he drank 
drank  my word  something chronic 
here  what are you sniggering at 
the new small talk 
you do it so awfully well 
well  if i was doing it proper 
what was you sniggering at 
have i said anything i oughtn t 
not at all  my dear 
well  that s a mercy anyhow 
i don t know if there s time
before the next race to place a bet   
   but come  my dear 
i have a bet on number seven 
i should be so happy if you would take it 
you ll enjoy the race ever so much more 
that s very kind of you 
his name is dover 
come along 
  there they are again
  lining up to run
  now they re holding steady
  they are ready for it  look 
  lt has begun  
come on  come on  dover 
come on 
come on  dover 
come on 
come on  dover 
move your bloomin  arse 
oh  my dear 
you re not serious  henry  you don t
expect to take her to the embassy ball 
don t you think she s ready for it 
dear henry  she s ready for a canal barge 
her language may need
a little refining  but  
really  henry  if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is   
   then you must be potty about her 
i advise you to give up
and not put yourself   
   or this poor girl through any more 
it s the most fascinating venture
i ve ever undertaken 
pickering and i are at it from morning
till night  it fills our whole lives 
teaching eliza  talking to eliza 
listening to eliza  dressing eliza 
you re a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll 
here s the car 
good evening  sir 
 is dinner ready  i m famished 
 immediately  sir 
good evening  professor higgins 
  when she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon
  she completely done me in
  and my heart went on
a journey to the moon
  when she told about her father
and the gin
  and i never saw a more enchanting farce
  than the moment when she shouted
 move your bloomin      
 yes  sir 
 is miss doolittle in 
whom shall i say is calling 
freddy eynsford hill 
if she doesn t remember who i am   
   tell her i m the chap
who was   sniggering   at her 
yes  sir 
and will you give her these 
wouldn t you like to come in 
they re having dinner 
but you may wait in the hall 
no  thank you  i want to drink in
the street where she lives 
  l have often walked
down this street before
  but the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before
  all at once am i several stories high
  knowing i m on the street where you live
  are there lilac trees in the heart of town 
  can you hear a lark
in any other part of town 
  does enchantment pour
out of every door 
  no  it s just on the street where you live
  and  oh  the towering feeling
  just to know somehow you are near
  the overpowering feeling
  that any second you may suddenly appear
  people stop and stare 
they don t bother me
  for there s nowhere else on earth
that i would rather be
  let the time go by
  l won t care if i
  can be here on the street where you live  
i m terribly sorry  sir 
miss doolittle says she doesn t want
to see anyone ever again 
but why  she was unbelievable 
so i ve been told  sir 
is there any further message 
tell her that i ll wait 
but it might be days  sir  even weeks 
but don t you see  i ll be happier here 
  people stop and stare 
they don t bother me
  for there s nowhere else on earth
that i would rather be
  let the time go by
  l won t care if i
  can be here on the street where you live  
it really is  higgins 
it s inhuman to continue 
do you realize what you ve got to teach
this girl in six weeks 
you ve got to teach her to walk  talk 
address a duke  a lord   
   a bishop  an ambassador 
it s absolutely impossible 
higgins  i m trying to tell you
that i want to call off the bet 
i know you re a stubborn man  but so am l 
this experiment is over 
and nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant 
you understand  higgins  it s over 
higgins  if there s any mishap
at the embassy tonight   
   if miss doolittle suffers
any embarrassment   
   it ll be on your head alone 
eliza can do anything 
suppose she s discovered 
remember ascot 
suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake 
there ll be no horses at the ball  pickering 
think of how agonizing it would be 
if anything happened tonight 
i don t know what i d do 
you could always rejoin your regiment 
this is no time for flippancy  higgins 
the way you ve driven her
the last six weeks   
   has exceeded all bounds
of common decency 
for god s sake  stop pacing 
can t you settle somewhere 
have some port  it ll quieten your nerves 
i m not nervous 
 where is it 
 on the piano 
the car s here  sir 
good  tell miss doolittle 
tell miss doolittle indeed 
i ll bet you that damned gown doesn t fit 
i warned you about these french designers 
we should ve gone to an english shop 
they would ve been on our side 
 have a glass of port 
 no  thank you 
are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you ve hammered into her 
well  we shall see 
suppose she doesn t 
i lose my bet 
there s one thing i can t stand about you 
your confounded complacency 
at a moment like this 
with so much at stake   
   it s utterly indecent
that you don t need a glass of port 
and what about the girl  you act
as though she doesn t matter at all 
rubbish  pickering  of course she matters 
what do you think i ve been doing
all these months 
what could possibly matter more
than to take a human being   
   and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her 
it s filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class   
   and soul from soul 
oh  she matters immensely 
miss doolittle  you look beautiful 
thank you  colonel pickering 
don t you think so  higgins 
not bad  not bad at all 
maestro  maestro 
don t you remember me 
no  who the devil are you 
i m your pupil  your first  your greatest 
your best pupil 
i m zoltan karpathy  that marvelous boy 
i made your name famous
throughout europe 
you teach me phonetics 
you can t forget me 
why don t you have your hair cut 
i don t have your imposing appearance 
your figure  your brow 
if i had my hair cut 
nobody would notice me 
where did you get these old coins 
these are decorations for languages 
the queen of transylvania is here 
i m indispensable to her
at these official international parties 
i speak 32 languages 
i know everyone in europe 
no imposter can escape my detection 
professor karpathy 
the greek ambassador 
greek  my foot 
he pretends not to know english 
but he can t deceive me 
he s the son of a yorkshire watchmaker 
he speaks english so villainously
that he cannot utter a word   
   without betraying his origin 
i help him pretend  but make him pay
through the nose  i make them all pay 
excuse me  sir  you are wanted upstairs 
her excellency asked for you 
viscount and viscountess saxon 
baron and baroness of yorkshire 
sir guy and lady scot auckland 
the count and countess demereau 
the viscount and viscountess hillyard 
mr  and mrs  richard lanser 
lord and lady clanders 
miss eliza doolittle  colonel pickering 
miss eliza doolittle  colonel pickering 
professor higgins 
 your excellency 
 miss doolittle 
how do you do 
 good evening  colonel 
 good evening 
what an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening 
well  who is she 
oh  a cousin of mine  and higgins 
excuse me 
professor higgins 
such a faraway look 
as if she s always lived in a garden 
so she has  a sort of garden 
henry must take eliza home at once 
there s a language expert here 
 sort of  you know    imposterologist   
 i beg you pardon 
the young lady with colonel pickering    
find out who she is 
with pleasure 
the whole situation is highly explosive 
tell me  zoltan 
some more about the greek ambassador 
gladly  but first i would love you
to present me to this glorious creature 
does he really come from yorkshire 
her majesty  the queen of transylvania   
   and his royal highness prince gregor 
charming  quite charming 
miss doolittle  madam 
miss doolittle  my son would like
to dance with you 
absolutely fantastic 
a lot of tomfoolery 
it was an immense achievement 
well  mr  higgins 
a triumph  mrs  pearce  a total triumph 
higgins  you were superb 
absolutely superb 
tell us the truth now  weren t you
a little bit nervous once or twice 
not during the whole evening 
not when i saw we were going to win 
i felt like a bear in a cage hanging about 
it was an immense achievement 
if i hadn t backed myself to do it 
i d have given up two months ago 
absolutely fantastic 
yes  a lot of tomfoolery 
higgins  i salute you 
the silly people don t know
their own silly business 
  tonight  old man  you did it
you did it  you did it
  you said that you would do it
and indeed you did
  l thought that you would rue it
i doubted you d do it
  but now i must admit it
that succeed you did
  you should get a medal
or be even made a knight
  oh  it was nothing  really nothing
  all alone you hurdled
every obstacle in sight
  now wait  now wait
give credit where it s due
  a lot of the glory goes to you
  but you re the one who did it
who did it  who did it
  as sturdy as gibraltar
not a second did you falter
  there s no doubt about it
  you did it 
  l must have aged a year tonight
at times i thought i d die of fright
  never was there a momentary lull
  shortly after we came in
i saw at once we d easily win
  and after that i found it deadly dull
  you should have heard
the  oohs  and  aahs 
  everyone wondering who she was
  you d think they d never seen
a lady before
  and when the prince of transylvania
asked to meet her
  and gave his arm to lead her to the floor
  l said to him   you did it
you did it  you did it 
  they thought she was ecstatic
and so damned aristocratic
  and they never knew
that you   
     did it  
thank goodness for zoltan karpathy 
if it hadn t been for him
i would ve died of boredom 
karpathy  that dreadful hungarian 
was he there 
yes  he was there all right
and up to his old tricks 
  that blackguard
who uses the science of speech
  more to blackmail and swindle than teach
  he made it the devilish business of his
  to find out who this miss doolittle is
  every time we looked around
there he was
  that hairy hound from budapest
  never leaving us alone
never have i ever known
  a ruder pest
  finally i decided it was foolish
not to let him have his chance with her
  so i stepped aside
and let him dance with her
  oozing charm from every pore
he oiled his way around the floor
  every trick that he could play
he used to strip her mask away
  and when at last the dance was done
he glowed as if he knew he d won
  and with a voice too eager
and a smile too broad
  he announced to the hostess
that she was a fraud  
no 
   her english is too good   he said
 that clearly indicates that she is foreign
   whereas others are instructed
ln their native language
   english people aren t
   although she may have studied with
an expert dialectician and grammarian
   l can tell that she was born
   hungarian 
  not only hungarian but of royal blood
  she is a princess
   her blood   he said
 ls bluer than the danube is or ever was
   royalty is absolutely written on her face
   she thought i was taken in
but actually i never was
   how could she deceive
another member of her race 
   l know each language on the map 
said he
   and she s hungarian
as the first hungarian rhapsody   
  congratulations  professor higgins
  for your glorious victory
  congratulations  professor higgins
  you ll be mentioned in history  
well  thank god  that s over 
now i can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow 
 good night  mr  higgins

because i wanted to smash your face 
i could kill you  you selfish brute 
why didn t you leave me
where you picked me up 
you thank god it s all over  now you can
throw me back again  do you 
oh  so the creature s nervous after all 
claws in  you cat 
how dare you show your temper to me

how do i know what s to become of you 
what does it matter 
you don t care  i know you don t care 
you wouldn t care if i was dead 
i m nothing to you 
not as much as them slippers 
those slippers 
those slippers  i didn t think it meant
any difference now 
why have you suddenly begun
going on like this 
may i ask if you complain
of your treatment here 
no 
has anybody behaved badly 
colonel pickering  mrs  pearce 
no 
well you don t pretend
that i have treated you badly 
no 
well  i m glad to hear that 
perhaps you re tired
after the strain of the day 
would you have a chocolate 
no  thank you 
well  it s only natural that you should
be anxious  but it s all over now 
nothing more to worry about 
no  nothing more for you to worry about 
oh  god  i wish i was dead 
why  ln heaven s name  why 
now listen to me  eliza 
all this irritation is purely subjective 
i don t understand  i m too ignorant 
it s just imagination  nothing s wrong 
nobody s hurting you 
go to bed and sleep it off 
have a little cry and say your prayers 
you ll feel very much more comfortable 
i heard your prayers 
  thank god it s all over

now you re free 
and you can do what you like 
oh  what am i fit for 
what have you left me fit for 
where am i to go  what am i to do 
and what s to become of me 
that s what s worrying you  is it 
i wouldn t worry about that if i were you 
i m sure you won t have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other 
i didn t quite realize you were going away 
you might marry  you know 
you see  eliza  all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the colonel 
most men are the marrying sort 
poor devils 
you re not bad looking 
you re really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes 
not now  when you ve been crying 
you look like the very devil  but   
   when you re all right and quite yourself
you re what i would call attractive 
go to bed  have a good rest 
get up in the morning   
   and have a look at yourself in the glass 
you won t feel so bad 
i daresay  my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well 
we were above that at covent garden 
what do you mean 
i sold flowers  i didn t sell myself 
now you ve made a lady of me 
i m not fit to sell anything else 
oh  tosh  eliza 
don t insult human relations   
   by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it 
don t marry the fellow if you don t want to 
what else am i to do 
oh  there are lots of things 
what about the old idea of a florist shop 
i m sure pickering d set you up in one 
he s got lots of money 
he ll pay for all those togs you re wearing 
and that with the hire of the jewelry ll
make a big hole in 200 pounds 
come on now  you ll be all right 
well  i must be off to bed 
i m really devilish sleepy 
i was looking for something  what was it 
your slippers 
oh  yes  of course  you shied them at me 
before you go  sir 
do my clothes belong to me
or to colonel pickering 
what the devil use would they be
to pickering 
why bother about that
in the middle of the night 
what may i take away with me 
i don t want to be accused of stealing 
stealing 
you shouldn t have said that 
that shows a want of feeling 
i m sorry  i m a common  ignorant girl
and in my station i have to be careful 
there can t be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me 
please  will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn t 
take the whole damned houseful
if you want 
except the jewelry  that s hired 
will that satisfy you 
stop  please 
will you take these to your room
and keep them safe 
i don t want to run the risk
of them being missed 
hand them over  lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler  i d   
   l d ram them down
your ungrateful throat 
the ring isn t the jeweler s 
it s the one you bought me in brighton 
i don t want it now 
don t you hit me 
hit you  you infamous creature 
how dare you suggest such a thing 
it s you who ve hit me 
you ve wounded me to the heart 
i m glad  i ve got a little
of my own back anyhow 
you ve caused me to lose my temper 
that s hardly happened to me before 
i don t wish to discuss it further tonight 
i m going to bed 
leave your own note for mrs  pearce
about the coffee   
   for it won t be done by me 
damn mrs  pearce 
damn the coffee and damn you 
damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard earned knowledge   
   and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe 
  just you wait   enry  lggins
just you wait 
  you ll be sorry
but your tears will be too late
  you will be the one it s done to
  and you ll have no one to run to
  just you wait

didn t she say where to send her clothes 
i told you  sir  she took them all with her 
here s a confounded thing  eliza s bolted 
last night mrs  pearce let her go
without telling me about it 
what ll i do  i got tea this morning
instead of coffee 
i don t know where anything is 
what my appointments are 
 eliza d know 
 damn it  she s gone 
did either of you frighten her last night 
we hardly said a word to her 
you were there 
did you bully her after i went to bed 
she threw the slippers at me 
i never gave her the slightest provocation 
the slippers came at my head
before i uttered a word 
she used the most disgraceful language 
i was shocked  i don t understand 
we always gave her every consideration 
she admitted it 
i m dashed 
pickering  for god s sake 
stop being dashed and do something 
phone the police  what are they there for 
you can t give eliza s name to the police   
   as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella 
but why not  i want to find the girl 
she belongs to me 
i paid five pounds for her 
quite right  hello  scotland yard  please 
get me some coffee  would you please 
scotland yard 
this is colonel pickering speaking 
27a wimpole street 
i want to report a missing person 
miss eliza doolittle 
about 21  
i should say about 5 foot 7 
her eyes  let me think now  her eyes    
 brown 
 brown 
her hair  good lord 
sort of a nondescript neutral sort of  
brown  brown  brown 
you heard what he said 
brown  brown  brown  yes 
no  this is her residence  27a  
yes  about between 3 00 and 4 00
this morning  i understand 
no     she s no relation  no 
well  let s call her a good friend  shall we 
i beg your pardon 
listen to me  i don t like the tenor
of that question 
what the girl does here is our affair 
your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it 
well  i m dashed 
  what in heaven
could have prompted her to go 
  after such a triumph at the ball
  what could have depressed her 
  what could have possessed her 
i cannot understand the wretch at all  
higgins  i have an old school chum
at the home office  perhaps he could help 
think i ll give him a ring 
whitehall  7244  please 
  women are irrational
that s all there is to that
  their heads are full of
cotton  hay and rags
  they re nothing but exasperating
lrritating  vacillating  calculating
  agitating  maddening
and infuriating hags  
i want to speak
to mr  brewster budgin  please 
yes  i ll wait 
pickering  why can t a woman
be more like a man 
i beg your pardon 
yes  why can t a woman
be more like a man 
  men are so honest  so thoroughly square
  eternally noble  historically fair
  who  when you win
will always give your back a pat 
  why can t a woman be like that 
  why does every one do
what the others do 
  can t a woman learn to use her head 
  why do they do everything
their mothers do 
  why don t they grow up
well  like their father instead 
  why can t a woman take after a man 
  men are so pleasant  so easy to please
  whenever you re with them
you re always at ease
  would you be slighted
lf i didn t speak for hours 
  would you be livid
lf i had a drink or two 
  would you be wounded
lf i never sent you flowers 
  well  why can t a woman be like you 
  one man in a million may shout a bit
  now and then
there s one with slight defects
  one perhaps whose truthfulness
you doubt a bit
  but by and large
we are a marvelous sex
  why can t a woman take after a man 
  cause men are so friendly
good natured and kind
  a better companion
you never will find
  lf i were hours late for dinner
would you bellow 
  lf i forgot your silly birthday
would you fuss 
  would you complain
lf i took out another fellow 
  well  why can t a woman be like us   
is mr  brewster budgin there 
bruzzie  you ll never guess who this is 
you re quite right  it is  good heavens 
by george  what a memory 
how are you  bruzzie 
nice to hear your voice 
what  you don t say 
has it really been 30 years  bruzzie 
right  yes  oceans of water 
listen  bruzzie  i ll tell you why i rang up 
something rather unpleasant
has happened  could i come and see you 
i could  yes  now  straight away 
right  good  thank you 
goodbye  bruzzie  thank you very much 
mrs  pearce  i m going along
to the home office 
i do hope you find her  colonel pickering 
mr  higgins will miss her 
mr  higgins will miss her  eh 
blast mr  higgins  i ll miss her 
 mrs  pearce 
 yes  sir 
where s the colonel 
he s gone to the home office  sir 
there you are  i m disturbed and he runs
for help  now there s a good fellow 
mrs  pearce  you re a woman 
  why can t a woman be more like a man 
  men are so decent
such regular chaps
  ready to help you
through any mishaps
  ready to buck you up
whenever you are glum
  why can t a woman be a chum 
  why is thinking
something women never do 
  and why is logic never even tried 
  straightening up their hair
ls all they ever do
  why don t they straighten up
the mess that s inside 
  why can t a woman behave like a man 
  lf i was a woman
who d been to a ball
  been hailed as a princess
by one and by all
  would i start weeping
like a bathtub overflowing 
  or carry on as if my home were in a tree 
  would i run off
and never tell me where i m going 
  why can t a woman be like me   
you mean that after you d done
this wonderful thing for them   
   without making a mistake   
   they just sat there
and never said a word 
never petted you  or admired you 
or told you how splendid you d been 
not a word 
they just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they d been 
the next moment  how glad they were
it was all over   
   and what a bore it had all been 
this is appalling  i should not
have thrown my slippers at him 
i should have thrown the fire irons 
who s that 
henry  i knew it wouldn t be too long 
now  remember   
   you not only danced with a prince
last night  you behaved like a princess 
mother  the most confounded thing    
do you  
you 
good afternoon  professor higgins 
are you quite well 
of course you are  you are never ill 
would you care for some tea 
don t you dare try that game on me 
i taught it to you 
get up  come home and stop being a fool 
you ve caused me enough trouble 
very nicely put indeed  henry 
no woman could resist such an invitation 
how did this baggage get here 
eliza came to see me this morning
and i was delighted to have her 
if you don t promise to behave yourself
i ll ask you to leave 
i m to put on my sunday manners
for this   
   thing that i created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of covent garden 
that s precisely what i mean 
i ll see her damned first 
however did you learn good manners
with my son around 
it was very difficult  i should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave   
   if it hadn t been for colonel pickering 
he showed me that he felt
and thought about me   
   as if i were something better
than a common flower girl 
you see  mrs  higgins 
apart from the things one can pick up   
   the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn t how she behaves   
   but how she is treated 
i ll always be a flower girl
to professor higgins   
   because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will 
i ll always be a lady to colonel pickering   
   because he always treats me
as a lady and always will 
henry  don t grind your teeth 
the bishop is here 
shall i show him into the garden 
the bishop and the professor 
good heavens  no 
i should be excommunicated 
i ll see him in the library 
eliza  if my son starts breaking up things   
   l give you full permission
to have him evicted 
henry  i suggest you stick to two subjects 
the weather and your health 
you ve had a bit of your own back 
as you say 
have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more 
you want me back to pick up
your slippers   
   and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you 
i didn t say i wanted you back at all 
then what are we talking about 
well  about you  not about me 
if you come back you ll be treated
as you always have 
i can t change my nature or my manners 
my manners are exactly
the same as colonel pickering s 
that s not true  he treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess 
i treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl 
i see  the same to everybody 
the great secret is not a question
of good manners   
   or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner   
   but having the same manner
for all human souls 
the question is not
whether i treat you rudely   
   but whether you ve ever heard me
treat anyone else better 
i don t care how you treat me 
i don t mind your swearing at me 
i shouldn t mind a black eye 
i ve had one before this 
but i won t be passed over 
get out of my way 
for i won t stop for you 
you talk about me as though
i was a motorbus 
so you are a motorbus  all bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody 
but i can get along without you 
don t you think i can t 
i know you can  i told you  you could 
you ve never wondered  i suppose 
whether   
   whether i could get along without you 
don t you try to get around me 
you ll have to 
so i can  without you or any soul on earth 
i shall miss you  eliza  i ve learned
something from your idiotic notions 
i confess that humbly and gratefully 
well  you have my voice
on your gramophone 
when you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on  it has no feelings to hurt 
well  i can t turn your soul on 
you are a devil 
you can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily   
   as some can twist her arms to hurt her 
what am i to come back for 
for the fun of it  that s why i took you on 
you may throw me out tomorrow
if i don t do everything you want 
yes  and you may walk out tomorrow
if i don t do everything you want 
and live with my father 
yes  or sell flowers 
would you rather marry pickering 
i wouldn t marry you if you asked me
and you re nearer my age then what he is 
 than he is 
 i ll talk as i like  you re not my teacher 
that s not what i want
and don t you think it is 
i ve always had chaps enough
wanting me that way 
freddy hill writes me twice
and three times a day  sheets and sheets 
in short  you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is  is that it 
no  i don t  that s not the sort of feeling
i want from you 
i want a little kindness 
i know i m a common  ignorant girl 
and you re a book learned gentleman   
   but i m not dirt under your feet 
what i done   what i did was not
for the taxis and the dresses   
   but because we were pleasant together
and i come to   came   
   to care for you 
not to want you to make love to me   
   and not forgetting the difference
between us  but   
   more friendly like 
well  of course  that s how i feel 
and how pickering feels 
eliza  you re a fool 
that s not the proper answer 
it s the only answer
till you stop being an idiot 
to be a lady  you must stop
feeling neglected   
   if men don t spend half their time
sniveling over you   
   and the other half giving you black eyes 
you find me cold  unfeeling  selfish 
don t you 
off with you to the sort of people you like 
marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money   
   and thick lips to kiss you 
and thick boots to kick you 
if you can t appreciate what you have 
then get what you can appreciate 
i can t talk to you 
you always turn everything against me 
i m always in the wrong 
don t be too sure you have me
under your feet   
   to be trampled on and talked down 
i ll marry freddy  i will 
as soon as i m able to support him 
the poor devil who couldn t get a job
as an errand boy   
   even if he had the guts to try 
don t you understand 
i have made you a consort for a king 
freddy loves me 
that makes him king enough for me 
i don t want him to work 
he wasn t brought up to do it as i was 
i ll go and be a teacher 
what ll you teach  in heaven s name 
what you taught me  i ll teach phonetics 
i ll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant hungarian 
what  that imposter  that humbug 
that toadying ignoramus 
teach him my methods  my discoveries 
you take one step in that direction 
i ll wring your neck 
wring away  what do i care 
i knew you d strike me one day 
that s done you   enry  lggins  it  as 
now  i don t care for your bullyin 
an  your big talk 
  what a fool i was
  what a dominated fool
  to think you were the earth and sky
  what a fool i was
  what an addle pated fool
  what a mutton headed dolt was i
  no  my reverberating friend
  you are not the beginning and the end  
you impudent hussy 
there s not an idea in your head or a word
in your mouth that i haven t put there 
  there ll be spring every year without you
  england still will be here without you
  there ll be fruit on the tree
and a shore by the sea
  there ll be crumpets and tea without you
  art and music will thrive without you
  somehow keats will survive without you
  and there still will be rain
on that plain down in spain
  even that will remain without you
  l can do   
     without you
  you  dear friend
  who talk so well
  you can go to
  hartford  hereford and hampshire
  they can still rule the land without you
  windsor castle will stand without you
  and without much ado
we can all muddle through
  without you    
you brazen hussy 
  without your pulling it the tide comes in
  without your twirling it the earth can spin
  without your pushing them
the clouds roll by
  lf they can do without you  ducky 
so can i
  l shall not feel alone without you
  l can stand on my own without you
  so go back in your shell
i can do bloody well    
  by george  i really did it
i did it  i did it
  l said i d make a woman and indeed i did
  l knew that i could do it
i knew it  i knew it
  l said i d make a woman
and succeed i did  
eliza  you re magnificent 
five minutes ago you were
a millstone around my neck   
   and now you re a tower of strength 
a consort battleship 
i like you this way 
goodbye  professor higgins 
you shall not be seeing me again 
mother 
what is it  henry  what s happened 
she s gone 
well  of course  dear 
what did you expect 
what am i to do 
do without  i suppose 
and so i shall 
if the higgins  oxygen burns up
her little lungs   
   let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her 
she s an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine 
let her go  i can do without her 
i can do without anyone 
i have my own soul 
my own spark of divine fire 
bravo  eliza 
  damn  damn  damn  damn
  l ve grown accustomed to her face
  she almost makes the day begin
  l ve grown accustomed to the tune
that she whistles night and noon
  her smiles  her frowns
her ups  her downs
  are second nature to me now
  like breathing out and breathing in
  l was serenely independent and content
before we met
  surely i could always be that way again
  and yet i ve grown
accustomed to her looks
  accustomed to her voice
  accustomed to her face  
marry freddy 
what an infantile idea  what a heartless 
wicked  brainless thing to do 
but she ll regret it  she ll regret it 
it s doomed before they even take the vow 
  l can see her now
mrs  freddy eynsford hill
  ln a wretched little flat above a store
  l can see her now  not a penny in the till
  and a bill collector beating at the door
  she ll try to teach the things i taught her
  and end up selling flowers instead
  begging for her bread and water
  while her husband has
his breakfast in bed
  ln a year or so
when she s prematurely gray
  and the blossom in her cheek
has turned to chalk
  she ll come home and lo
he ll have upped and run away
  with a social climbing heiress
from new york
  poor eliza
  how simply frightful
  how humiliating
  how delightful
  how poignant it will be
on that inevitable night
  when she hammers on my door
ln tears and rags
  miserable and lonely
repentant and contrite
  will i take her in
or hurl her to the wolves 
  give her kindness
or the treatment she deserves 
  will i take her back
or throw the baggage out 
  well  i m a most forgiving man
  the sort who never could  ever would
  take a position
and staunchly never budge
  a most forgiving man
  but i shall never take her back
  lf she were crawling on her knees
  let her promise to atone
let her shiver  let her moan
  l ll slam the door
and let the hellcat freeze  
marry freddy 
  but i m so used to hear her say
   good morning  every day
  her joys  her woes
  her highs  her lows
  are second nature to me now
  like breathing out and breathing in
  l m very grateful she s a woman
and so easy to forget
  rather like a habit one can always break
  and yet i ve grown
accustomed to the trace
  of something in the air
  accustomed to her face  
oh  we are proud  he ain t above
givin  lessons  not  im  i  eard  im say so 
i ain t come here to ask
for any compliment   
   and if my money s not good enough 
i can go elsewhere 
good enough for what 
good enough for you 
now you know  don t ya 
i m come to  ave lessons 
and to pay for  em  too   
   make no mistake 
what do you want  my girl 
i want to be a lady in a flow r shop 
 stead o  sellin    
   at the corner of tottenham court road 
but they won t take me unless i can talk
more genteel  he said he could teach me 
well   ere i am ready to pay  not askin 
any favor  and he treats me as if i was dirt 
i know what lessons cost as well as you do
and i m ready to pay 
i won t give more than a shillin  
take it or leave it 
it s almost irresistible 
she s so deliciously low 
so horribly dirty  i ll take it
