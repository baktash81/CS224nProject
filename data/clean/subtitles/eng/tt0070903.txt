or at least  talented 
today i m going to read 
with a great deal of pleasure   
   a remarkably good story
from a surprising new source 
the name of the story is
 the all american smile  
and it s by hubbell gardiner 
 in a way  he was like the country
he lived in 
everything came too easily to him 
but at least he knew it 
about once a month he worried
that he was a fraud 
but then most everyone he knew
was more fraudulent 
sometimes he felt    
  there s really no reason
for us to change 
but of course by then  they were
too lost or too lazy 
it had always been too easy  
the trouble with some people
is they work too hard 
are you speaking to me

  no you don t 
you don t talk  you lecture 
what was that speech about yalta 
no one here needs you to explain it 
then why all those silly jokes 
j j  called roosevelt
the  yaltese falcon  
i thought it was pretty funny 
and selling your novel to hollywood 
i hope that s meant to be funny 
  why 
  why 
because you re too good
for hollywood  that s why 
maybe i d be lucky to sell a
book to hollywood 
you ve never even been there 
besides  this isn t the point 
can t we just relax and enjoy the party 
you get onto politics  and your sense
of humour goes right out the window 
i guess there are just
some things that are   
   difficult for me
to laugh about  hubbell 
than have a fickle minded
real live girl
i m sorry 
i got caught up at the studio and   
   then i met somebody from
the party who wondered  
what  what 
the first eight chapters 
you want to read it  read it 
but let s not discuss it 
all right 
if you don t like it  you have to say
you don t like it and why 
what if i like it 
waiter 
ahoy 
come in 
how you doing 
fine 
is that new 
it was in the other room 
looks good there 
plants are all growing 
how s your mother 
much better  like the news 
i might be able sell
my book to hollywood 
i know  j j  told me 
what do you think about that 
about living in sunshine
all year long   
   and going to work in a sports car 
sailing 
sounds wonderful 
would you like a drink 
no 
no  i just stopped 
i was out walking 
hey  thanks 
i love the way you write 
franklin roosevelt is dead 
most of you have already
heard the news 
but it will take days 
perhaps weeks  even months   
   for the final tragedy of
what happened at 5 45 this morning   
   to be fully comprehended 
what seems particularly touching
is that he will not be here   
   to share in a victory
so close at hand 
did you go see it 
i was talking to    
there was this older guy   
   on  you know  that
steel platform between cars 
i helped him open
a big door  he needed air 
jesus  i can t even remember
when he wasn t president 
a fourth term was too much
for the old man 
a third was too much
for my old man 
  at least it ll end those eleanor jokes 
  some were funny 
how about eleanor in the mine
with the hillbillies 
her face was covered
with grime  right 
grime  for chrissakes  judianne 
eleanor went down into   
   a mine and got her face black with
coal  the hillbillies saw her   
   big buckteeth shining  
her husband is dead 
dead 
yes  mrs  roosevelt went down
into the mines 
and when they asked her why 
she said   i am my husband s legs  
did you tell cripple jokes too 
is there anything that isn t a joke 
sorry 
who makes up jokes anyway 
j j  s old man 
scads of swell material here
for a good novel 
if you wanna write about this 
people who tell jokes
instead of feeling something 
let s meet every five years   
   or every time a president conks 
whichever s sooner 
  what are you doing 
  what are we doing here 
j j  s gonna buy your book and
we re all gonna go to hollywood 
take it easy 
lots of writers went there 
fitzgerald  
  he s dead 
  i know that 
it s none of your business anyway 
he died of booze   
     and people like you 
  damn it  stop it 
he s sorry for the joke 
why did you bring me here 
couldn t we have gone for a walk   
     or sit on a bench 
  i didn t want to feel sadder 
  what s wrong with feeling sadder 
  it won t help  the president died 
and everything in the world that
happens doesn t just happen to you 
behave yourself 
i don t care about behaving myself 
then don t  do what you want 
i wanna get out of here 
all right 
i meant us 
and then what 
see you later  katie 
oh  yeah  see you

they couldn t overthrow
louella parsons 
in  37  in munich

ten years in leavenworth  11 years in
twelveworth  or 5 and 10 in woolworth 
  to control thought 
censorship 
let s not dramatize this 
it ll all blow over 
  that line is necessary 
  it s the point of the whole scene 
the point s made by the
dancers in red  white and blue 
there are no dancers in his book 
you can t just have dancers 
please 
brooks  if we get this organized 
you ve got to talk

  george  is paula reisner a red 
  my heavens  i don t know  why 
  it s something i heard

the first amendment 
what 
well  well 
  think anybody knows what it says 
  katie does 
that s for sure 
some actor comes up to me   
   and says this line
doesn t make any sense 
what do you think 
if they go  it ll make more trouble 
they may not have jobs to come back to 
what do you want from me 
tell katie to stay out of it 
you tell her 
i will 
i ll buy tickets to that 
would you just tell her to go easy 
sure  you tell bissinger to go easy 
you re the producer 
what s eating you 
nothing  the war s over  right 
movies    
do you realize this is the first
job we ve ever had 
athletic scholarship 
doesn t that count 
doesn t count  buddy 
well  then  officer 
landing craft  south pacific 
nope 
why  we got paid  150 a month 
doesn t count 
  you want a drink 
  no 
there s a little trouble at home 
i have to keep my wits about me 
old carol ann 
don t take any crap 
to the both of us 
and all the absent friends 
class of  37 
  is this the gardiner house 
  and i m the gardener 
  how are you doing 
  okay  so far  
your lover chain smokes  no doubt to
compensate for his extreme shortness 
he has an enormous heart
and no sense of humour 
you found us out 
calls himself brooks kropatkin 
but it s not his real name 
  what is it 
  carpenter 
carpenter  who told you that 
j j  with whom i was not drinking   
   since he no longer drinks
due to trouble at home 
well  carol ann s 33 
not many moves left 
well  we re all 33  practically 
not you  not the quiz kid 
what were you  16 in college 
what s gonna happen 
you re going to washington 
i meant with j j  and carol ann 
that s another house  in this house 
the wife is going to d c 
gonna take the baby with you 
i thought i might 
nothing like an early education 
i d like her to learn
not to be frightened 
her 
him 
why don t you come with us 
we re kind of back
where we started  aren t we 
that s not true  hubbell 
okay  now why don t
we all stay home 
i can t 
  and named the names of
14 of his fellow actors 
he described their
various associations   
   with subversive organizations 
ten men of the original 19
who refused to testify    
and there he is   
   jack armstrong 
the all american boy 
  hey  you look good 
  i hate it 
i like it 
isn t she lovely 
america s sweetheart 
look at her go  i d forgotten 
she really was getting to those people 
take a look at some of those faces 
oh  she was a spellbinder 
i d forgotten about that 
she s beautiful 
i m exhausted 
do you have any comment
regarding the hollywood 10 
they re running toward martyrdom
for nothing but their own destruction 
they re standing up for principle 
if you don t like this
country  get out 
it s my country too 
they could ve denied everything 
they didn t want to 
can we do this
someplace else 
why are you here 
you might get put on a list 
i refuse to be intimidated 
well  those 10 men feel
exactly the same way 
free speech is all
we re talking about 
they re fighting for your right
to make any movie you want 
and all you can do is strut
around here making simple remarks 
could we get a statement
from mrs  gardiner 
i d like to ask these people
why they think we just fought a war 
what are you people afraid of 
shut your mouth  you commie bitch 
you two wait here
till the crowd clears 
are you okay 
you re bleeding 
i m fine 
it s always fun
meeting trains  you know 
i m sorry  hubbell 
i really didn t expect this 
you didn t expect to get a chance
to tell off the world either 
  is that what you think i m doing 
  you bet i do 
i m not telling off the world 
i m just standing up
for something i believe in 
you re not angry when
bissinger ridicules those men 
calling them martyrs because
they have guts   
   to fight for their bill of rights 
his bill of rights and yours 
we don t have any bill of rights 
we ll never have free speech 
we never will if people
won t take a stand 
we never will have because
people are scared 
this isn t college 
this is grown up politics  katie 
and it s stupid and dangerous 
you re telling me to shut up
because it s dangerous 
i m telling you it s a waste 
and that those men
are only gonna get hurt 
and that nothing is gonna change 
and after jail 
after years of bad blood   
   when it s practical for a fascist
producer to hire a communist writer   
   because his movie s
in trouble  he ll do it 
they ll make movies  have dinner 
they ll play tennis   
   make passes at each other s wives 
what did anybody go to jail for 
for what  a political spat 
you re telling me to close my eyes
and watch people being destroyed   
   so you can work in a town
that doesn t have spine enough   
   to stand up for
anything but a buck 
i m telling you that people are more
important than a goddamn witch hunt 
you and me  not causes 
not principles 
hubbell  people are their principles 
the heads of the studios have
reversed their positions   
   and any employee who   
   is an unfriendly witness
before the committee is   
   fired 
oh  jesus 
so now we have an official blacklist 
it s an open season
for witch hunters   
   and stool pigeons 
and now the problem is 
how to convince the public   
   that a stool pigeon is a hero 
you are like these
damn palm trees 
they don t belong here either 
they were brought in and they look it 
i m sure that they
don t like it either 
  what if he does  paula 
  what is more important to you 
he is 
that s your choice  katie 
  give him my love too 
  i will 
thanks  paula 
it s no reflection on anything
except that you re new to this   
   film technique 
especially for the novelist 
he s too close to his own material 
i m not a novelist 
i d like to think of myself   
   as a screenwriter 
i wanna be up front with you 
i know what changes have to be made 
but can you make them 
nobody else understands that story 
nobody knows it  it s mine 
mine 
i know where it came from 
i know what the heart of it is 
you remember those few days
before the war started 
before we had to change  
you don t lose what i know about it 
work with me 
work with me closely  fine 
and i know the dialogue from the book
is slowing the film up 
but i can fix that 
i learn fast  i always have 
things come  
christ  i can do it 
i know what you want 
i know what your concept is 
i ll make your changes 
let me 
with no resistance 
no 
no resistance 
bad times 
can t be all bad 
how s the picture 
troubled 
i m going back to new york 
new york 
when do you leave 
not until tomorrow 
i m getting rid of some things
in my apartment 
there s some champagne 
for bon voyage 
well  it s getting better 
better    
it s most unusual 
when it s slow  it seems
necessary to be slow 
of course  with the audience

we ll conduct the postmortem tomorrow 
good night  paula

katie  the day you die
