refuses to cooperate
l want you to go after him
again today in the asylum
and whos the subject

but l have to be able
to say we tried
so if he wont cooperate

be very careful
with hannibal lecter
dr chilton at the asylum

all the physical procedures
used with him
do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever
and youre to tell him
nothing personal starling
believe me you dont
want hannibal lecter
inside your head
just do your job
but never forget
what he is
and what is that
chllton oh hes a monster
a pure psychopath
so rare to capture one alive
from a research
point of view
lecter is our most
prized asset
well
you know we get a lot
of detectives here
but l must say
l cant ever remember
one as attractive
will you be in
baltimore overnight
because this can be quite
a fun town if you have
the right guide
well lm sure this
is a great town
dr chilton
but uh my instructions
are to talk to dr lecter
and report back
this afternoon
l see
lets make this quick then
weve tried to study him
of course
but hes much too
sophisticated for
the standard tests
oh my
does he hate us
he thinks
lm his nemesis
crawfords very clever
isnt he using you
clarlce what do
you mean sir
a pretty young woman
to turn him on
l dont believe lecters
even seen a woman
in eight years
and oh are you
ever his taste

uva doctor
lt is not a charm school

should be able to
remember the rules
man shoutlng
do not touch
the glass
do not approach
the glass
you pass him nothing
but soft paper
no pencils or pens
no staples or paper
clips on his paper
use the sliding food
carrier no exceptions
lf he attempts to
pass you anything
do not accept it
do you understand me
yes l understand sir
buzzer buzzlng
lm going to show you
why we insist on
such precautions
on the afternoon
of july 8 1 981
he complained
of chest pains
and was taken to
the dispensary
his mouthpiece
and restraints were
removed for an ekg
when the nurse
leaned over him
he did this to her
the doctors managed
to reset her jaw
more or less
save one of her eyes
his pulse never
got above 85
even when he
ate her tongue
l keep him in here
dr chilton
lf lecter feels
that youre his enemy
then uh well
maybe well have
more luck
if l go in by myself
what do you think
beeplng
you might have
suggested this
in my office
and saved me the time
yes sir but then l
l would have missed
the pleasure of
your company sir
when shes finished
bring her out

for yourself
whether or not lm
qualified enough
to do that
mmm
that is rather
slippery of you
agent starling
sit please
now then tell me
what did miggs say to you
multiple miggs
in the next cell
he hissed at you
what did he say
he said l can
smell your cunt
l see
l myself cannot
lnhallng
you use evyan skin cream
and sometimes you
wear lair du temps
but not today
did you do all these
drawings doctor
ah
that is the duomo
seen from the belvedere
you know florence
all that detail
just from memory
sir
memory agent starling
is what l have instead
of a view
well
perhaps youd care
to lend us your view on
this questionnaire sir
oh no no no no
you were doing fine
you had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy
you had established trust
with the embarrassing
truth about miggs
and now this hamhanded
segue into your
questionnaire
cllcklng tongue
lt wont do
lm only asking you to
look at this doctor
either you will
or you wont
yeah
jack crawford must
be very busy indeed
if he is recruiting help
from the student body
busy hunting that new one
buffalo bill
what a naughty boy he is
do you know why hes
called buffalo bill
please tell me
the newspapers
wont say
well it started as a bad joke
in kansas city homicide
they said this one likes
to skin his humps
why do you think
he removes their skins
agent starling

lt excites him
most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies
from their victims
l didnt

hmm
oh agent starling
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt little tool
no
l   l thought that
your knowledge
youre so ambitious
arent you
you know what you
look like to me
with your good bag
and your cheap shoes
you look like a rube
a wellscrubbed hustling
rube with a little taste
good nutrition has given
you some length of bone
but youre not more
than one generation
from poor white trash
are you agent starling
and that accent youve tried
so desperately to shed
pure west virginia
ln southern accent
what does your father do
ls he a coal miner
does he stink of the lamp
and oh how quickly
the boys found you
all those tedious
sticky fumblings in
the back seats of cars
while you could only
dream of getting out
getting anywhere
getting all the
way to the fbl
you see a lot doctor
but are you strong
enough to point
that highpowered
perception at yourself
what about it
why dont you
why dont you look at
yourself and write
down what you see
maybe youre afraid to
thuddlng

how to feel about this
you dont have to feel
any way about it
lecter did it
to amuse himself
look i know it
got ugly today
but you mentioned
a name at the end
mofet
any followup on her
uh well lecter
altered or destroyed
most of his
patients histories
prior to capture
so theres no record
of anyone named mofet
but uh l thought
the yourself reference
was uh too hokey
for lecter
so l figured
hes from baltimore
and l looked
in the phone book
and theres a
your self storage facility
right outside of
downtown baltimore sir
unit 31 was leased
for 1 0 years
prepaid in full
the contract
is in the name of
a miss hester mofet

why dont you ask me

the case file

why dont we talk
about miss mofet
you wanted me to find him
his real name is
benjamin raspail
a former patient of mine
whose romantic attachments
ran to shall we say
the exotic
l did not kill him
l assure you
merely tucked him away
very much as l found him
after hed missed
three appointments
lf you didnt kill him
then who did sir
who can say
best thing for him really
his therapy was going nowhere
his dress uh makeup
raspail was a transvestite
ln life oh no
garden variety
manicdepressive
tedious very tedious
and l just think of him
as a kind of experiment
a fledgling killers
first effort at
transformation
how did you feel
when you saw him
clarice
scared at first then
exhilarated
jack crawford is helping
your career isnt he
apparently he likes you

visualizes scenarios
exchanges

lts the sort of thing
that miggs would say
not anymore

buffalo billtype
situation
alrplane englne whlrrlng
crawford he keeps them
alive for three days
we dont know why
theres no evidence of rape
or physical abuse
prior to death
all the mutilation
you see there is
postmortem
okay three days
then he shoots them
skins them and dumps them
each body in
a different river
the water leaves us
no trace evidence
of any kind
thats fredrica bimmel
the first one
her body was the only one
he took the trouble
to weight down
so actually she was
the third girl found
after her he got lazy
okay lets see
circles where the girls
were abducted
arrows where their
bodies were found
this new one today
washed up here
elk river west virginia
look at him starling
tell me what you see
well hes a white male
serial killers tend to hunt
within their
own ethnic groups
hes not a drifter
hes got his own
house somewhere
not an apartment
why
what he does with
them takes privacy
hes in his 30s or 40s
hes got real
physical strength
combined with an older mans
uh selfcontrol
hes cautious precise
and hes never impulsive
hell never stop
why not
hes got a real taste
for it now
hes getting better
at his work
not bad starling

our top story
for this morning
catherine martin
the 25yearold daughter
of senator ruth martin
listed first as
a missing person
is now believed to
have been kidnapped
by the serial killer
known only as buffalo bill
memphis police
sources indicate
that the missing
girls blouse
has been identified
sliced up the back
in what has become
a kind of grim
alltoofamiliar
calling card
young catherine martin
as weve said
is the only daughter
of us senator ruth martin
the republican junior senator
from tennessee
and while her kidnapping
is not at this point
considered to be
politically motivated
nevertheless it has
stirred the government
to its highest levels
reached for a comment
on the ski slopes
of stowe vermont
the president
himself said to be
and i quote
intensely concerned
just moments ago
senator martin
taped this dramatic
personal plea
excuse me
martin im speaking now
to the person who is
holding my daughter
catherine is very
gentle and kind
talk to her and youll see
you have the power
you are in charge
i know you can feel
love and compassion
you have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world
that you can be merciful
as well as strong
that youre big enough
to treat catherine
better than the world
has treated you
you have that power
please
my daughter is catherine
ardella boy thats smart
release her unharmed
jesus thats really smart
man she keeps
repeating the name
lf he sees
catherine as a person
and not just an object
its harder to tear her up
please
release my little girl
what youre doing
miss starling
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview
and refusing to share
information with me
for the third time
sir l told you
this is just
a routine followup
on the raspail case
he is my patient
l have rights
l understand that sir
look l am not
just some turnkey
miss starling
this is the number for
the us attorneys
office
please either you
discuss this with him
or you let me do my job
do you understand
clarlce lf your profile
helps us catch buffalo bill
in time to save
catherine martin
the senator
promises you
a transfer
to the va hospital
at oneida park new york
with a view of
the woods nearby
maximum security
still applies
of course
youd have reasonable
access to books
best of all though
one week of the year
you get to leave
the hospital and
go here
plum lsland
every day of that week
you may walk on the beach
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour
under swat team surveillance
of course
and there you have it
a copy of the
buffalo bill
case file
a copy of the
senators offer
this offer is
nonnegotiable
and final
lf catherine martin dies
you get nothing
thuddlng
plum lsland
animal disease
research center
sounds charming
thats only part
of the island
theres a very
very nice beach
terns nest there
theres beautiful
terns hmm
lf l help you clarice
it will be turns
with us too
quid pro quo
l tell you things
you tell me things
not about this case
though about yourself
quid pro quo yes or no
yes or no clarice
poor little catherine
is waiting
go doctor
what is your worst
memory of childhood
the death of my father
tell me about it
and dont lie
or lll know
he was a town marshal
and one night
he surprised
two burglars
coming out of the back
of a drugstore
they shot him
was he killed outright
no he was very strong
he lasted more than a month
my mother died
when l was very young
so my father had become
the whole world to me
and when he left me
l had nothing
l was ten years old
youre very frank clarice
l think it would
be quite something to
know you in private life
quid pro quo doctor
so tell me about
miss west virginia
was she a large girl
yes
big through the hips roomy
they all were
what else
she had an object
deliberately inserted
into her throat
now that hasnt
been made public yet
we dont know
what it means
was it a butterfly
yes a moth
just like the one we found
in benjamin raspails head
an hour ago
why does he place
them there doctor
the significance
of the moth is change
caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa
and from thence into beauty
our billy wants
to change too
theres no correlation
in literature
between transsexualism
and violence
transsexuals
are very passive
clever girl
youre so close to the way
youre gonna catch him
do you realize that
no tell me why
after your fathers murder
you were orphaned
what happened next
l dont imagine
the answer is on those
secondrate shoes clarice
l went to live
with my mothers cousin
and her husband in montana
they had a ranch
was it a cattle ranch
sheep and horses
how long did you live there
two months
why so briefly
l ran away
why clarice
did the rancher make
you perform fellatio
did he sodomize you
no he was a very decent man
quid pro quo doctor
billy is not
a real transsexual
but he thinks he is
he tries to be
hes tried to be
a lot of things l expect
and you said that
l was very close
to the way
we would catch him
what did you mean doctor
there are three major centers
for transsexual surgery
johns hopkins
the university of minnesota
and columbus medical center
l wouldnt be surprised
if billy had applied
for sex reassignment
at one or all of them
and been rejected
on what basis
would they reject him
lecter look for severe
childhood disturbances
associated with violence
our billy wasnt born
a criminal clarice
he was made one through
years of systematic abuse
billy hates his own
identity you see
and he thinks that
makes him a transsexual
but his pathology
