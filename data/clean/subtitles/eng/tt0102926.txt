behavioral science 
yes  very much  sir

we re interviewing all
the serial killers

for a psycho behavioral
profile 
lt could be a real help
in unsolved cases 
most of them have been
happy to talk to us 
do you spook easily 
starling 
not yet  sir 
see  the one we want most 
refuses to cooperate 
l want you to go after him
again today in the asylum 
and who s the subject 
the psychiatrist
hannibal lecter 
hannibal the cannibal 
l don t expect him
to talk to you 
but l have to be able
to say we tried 
so if he won t cooperate 
l want just
straight reporting 
how s he look 
how s his cell look 
ls he sketching  drawing 
lf he is 
what s he sketching 
here s a dossier
on lecter 
a copy of our questionnaire
and a special ld for you 
have your memo on my desk
by 0800 wednesday 
okay 
excuse me  sir 
but why the urgency 
lecter s been in prison
for so many years now 
ls there some
connection between him
and buffalo bill maybe 
l wish there were 
l want your full
attention  starling 
yes  sir 
be very careful
with hannibal lecter 
dr  chilton at the asylum
will go over
all the physical procedures
used with him 
do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever 
and you re to tell him
nothing personal  starling 
believe me  you don t
want hannibal lecter
inside your head 
just do your job 
but never forget
what he is 
and what is that 
chllton  oh  he s a monster 
a pure psychopath 
so rare to capture one alive 
from a research
point of view 
lecter is our most
prized asset 
well 
you know  we get a lot
of detectives here 
but l must say 
l can t ever remember
one as attractive 
will you be in
baltimore overnight 
because this can be quite
a fun town if you have
the right guide 
well  l m sure this
is a great town 
dr  chilton 
but  uh  my instructions
are to talk to dr  lecter
and report back
this afternoon 
l see 
let s make this quick  then 
we ve tried to study him 
of course 
but he s much too
sophisticated for
the standard tests 
oh  my 
does he hate us 
he thinks
l m his nemesis 
crawford s very clever 
isn t he  using you 
clarlce  what do
you mean  sir 
a pretty young woman
to turn him on 
l don t believe lecter s
even seen a woman
in eight years 
and  oh  are you
ever his taste 
so to speak 
l graduated from
uva  doctor 
lt is not a charm school 
good  then you
should be able to
remember the rules 
 man shoutlng 
do not touch
the glass 
do not approach
the glass 
you pass him nothing
but soft paper 
no pencils or pens 
no staples or paper
clips on his paper 
use the sliding food
carrier  no exceptions 
lf he attempts to
pass you anything 
do not accept it 
do you understand me 
yes  l understand  sir 
 buzzer buzzlng 
l m going to show you
why we insist on
such precautions 
on the afternoon
of july 8  1 981  
he complained
of chest pains
and was taken to
the dispensary 
his mouthpiece
and restraints were
removed for an ekg 
when the nurse
leaned over him 
he did this to her 
the doctors managed
to reset her jaw 
more or less 
save one of her eyes 
his pulse never
got above 85 
even when he
ate her tongue 
l keep him in here 
dr  chilton 
lf lecter feels
that you re his enemy 
then  uh  well 
maybe we ll have
more luck
if l go in by myself 
what do you think 
 beeplng 
you might have
suggested this
in my office
and saved me the time 
yes  sir  but then l     
l would have missed
the pleasure of
your company  sir 
when she s finished 
bring her out 
hi  l m barney 
he told you  don t
get near the glass 
yes  he did 
clarice starling 
mmm hmm  nice to
meet you  clarice 
you can hang your coat
up here if you like 
thank you  l will 
he s past the others 
the last cell 
you keep to the right 
l put out
a chair for you 
oh  yes 
that s very good 
thank you 
l ll be watching 
you ll do fine 
lnmate  hi 
l can smell your cunt 
good morning 
dr  lecter  my name

may l speak with you 
you re one of
jack crawford s 
aren t you 
l am  yes  sir 
may l see your
credentials 
certainly 
closer  please 
closer 
that expires in one week 
you re not real fbl  are you 
l m still in training
at the academy 
jack crawford
sent a trainee to me 
yes  l m a student 
l m here to learn
from you 
maybe you can decide
for yourself
whether or not l m
qualified enough
to do that 
mmm 
that is rather
slippery of you 
agent starling 
sit  please 
now  then  tell me 
what did miggs say to you 
multiple miggs
in the next cell 
he hissed at you 
what did he say 
he said   l can
smell your cunt  
l see 
l myself cannot 
 lnhallng 
you use evyan skin cream 
and sometimes you
wear l air du temps 
but not today 
did you do all these
drawings  doctor 
ah  
that is the duomo 
seen from the belvedere 
you know florence 
all that detail
just from memory 
sir 
memory  agent starling 
is what l have instead
of a view 
well 
perhaps you d care
to lend us your view on
this questionnaire  sir 
oh  no  no  no  no 
you were doing fine 
you had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy 
you had established trust
with the embarrassing
truth about miggs 
and now this ham handed
segue into your
questionnaire 
 cllcklng tongue 
lt won t do 
l m only asking you to
look at this  doctor 
either you will
or you won t 
yeah 
jack crawford must
be very busy indeed 
if he is recruiting help
from the student body 
busy hunting that new one 
buffalo bill 
what a naughty boy he is 
do you know why he s
called buffalo bill 
please tell me 
the newspapers
won t say 
well  it started as a bad joke
in kansas city homicide 
they said   this one likes
to skin his humps  
why do you think
he removes their skins 
agent starling 
enthrall me with your acumen 
lt excites him 
most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies
from their victims 
l didn t 
no 
no  you ate yours 
you send that through now 
hmm 
oh  agent starling 
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt  little tool 
no 
l      l thought that
your knowledge     
you re so ambitious 
aren t you 
you know what you
look like to me
with your good bag
and your cheap shoes 
you look like a rube 
a well scrubbed  hustling
rube with a little taste 
good nutrition has given
you some length of bone 
but you re not more
than one generation
from poor white trash 
are you  agent starling 
and that accent you ve tried
so desperately to shed 
pure west virginia 
 ln southern accent 
what does your father do 
ls he a coal miner 
does he stink of the lamp 
and  oh  how quickly
the boys found you 
all those tedious 
sticky fumblings in
the back seats of cars 
while you could only
dream of getting out 
getting anywhere 
getting all the
way to the fbl 
you see a lot  doctor 
but are you strong
enough to point
that high powered
perception at yourself 
what about it 
why don t you     
why don t you look at
yourself and write
down what you see 
maybe you re afraid to 
 thuddlng 
a census taker once
tried to test me 
l ate his liver
with some fava beans 
and a nice chianti 
 hlsslng 
you fly back to school now 
little starling

advancement  of course 
now listen carefully 
look deep within yourself 
clarice starling

miggs is dead

all afternoon 
and miggs crying 
they found him
at bed check 
he d swallowed
his own tongue 
starling 
yeah  l m     
l m still here  sir 
l just      l don t know
how to feel about this 
you don t have to feel
any way about it 
lecter did it
to amuse himself 
look  i know it
got ugly today 
but you mentioned
a name at the end 
mofet 
any follow up on her 
uh  well  lecter
altered or destroyed
most of his
patients  histories
prior to capture 
so there s no record
of anyone named mofet 
but  uh  l thought
the  yourself  reference
was  uh  too hokey
for lecter 
so l figured 
he s from baltimore 
and l looked
in the phone book 
and there s a
 your self storage  facility 
right outside of
downtown baltimore  sir 
unit 31 was leased
for 1 0 years 
prepaid in full 
the contract
is in the name of
a miss hester mofet 
so nobody s been
in here since 1 980 
not to my knowledge 
privacy is a great concern
to my customers 
 gruntlng 
yes  l won t disturb
anything  l promise 
l ll be out of here
before you know it 
yes  actually  you can 
 door banglng 
lt s stuck 
we could return tomorrow

that garage 
thank you 
your bleeding has stopped 
how did you     
lt s nothing 
lt s just a scratch 
dr  lecter  whose head
is in that bottle 
why don t you ask me
about buffalo bill 
why  do you know
something about him 
l might  if l saw
the case file 
you could get that for me 
why don t we talk
about miss mofet 
you wanted me to find him 
his real name is
benjamin raspail 
a former patient of mine 
whose romantic attachments
ran to  shall we say 
the exotic 
l did not kill him 
l assure you 
merely tucked him away
very much as l found him 
after he d missed
three appointments 
lf you didn t kill him 
then who did  sir 
who can say 
best thing for him  really 
his therapy was going nowhere 
his dress  uh  makeup     
raspail was a transvestite 
ln life  oh  no 
garden variety
manic depressive 
tedious  very tedious 
and l just think of him
as a kind of experiment 
a fledgling killer s
first effort at
transformation 
how did you feel
when you saw him 
clarice 
scared at first  then 
exhilarated 
jack crawford is helping
your career  isn t he 
apparently  he likes you 
and you like him  too 
l never thought about it 
do you think jack crawford
wants you sexually 
true  he is much older 
but do you think he
visualizes scenarios 
exchanges 
fucking you 
that doesn t interest me 
doctor 
frankly  it s     
lt s the sort of thing
that miggs would say 
not anymore 
thank you  barney

never  ever let me

what l want is a view 
l want a window where l can
see a tree  or even water 
l want to be in
a federal institution
far away from dr  chilton 
what did you mean
by fledgling killer 
are you saying that
he s killed again 
l m offering you
a psychological profile
on buffalo bill 
based on the case evidence 
l ll help you catch him 
clarice 
you know who he is 
don t you

saddle up 
pack your field gear 
you re moving out 
you re going with crawford 
where 
found a girl s body
down in west virginia 
been in the water
about a week 
looks like a
buffalo bill type
situation 
 alrplane englne whlrrlng 
crawford  he keeps them
alive for three days 
we don t know why 
there s no evidence of rape
or physical abuse
prior to death 
all the mutilation
you see there is
postmortem 
okay  three days 
then he shoots them 
skins them  and dumps them 
each body in
a different river 
the water leaves us
no trace evidence
of any kind 
that s fredrica bimmel 
the first one 
her body was the only one
he took the trouble
to weight down 
so actually  she was
the third girl found 
after her  he got lazy 
okay  let s see 
circles where the girls
were abducted 
arrows where their
bodies were found 
this new one today
washed up here 
elk river  west virginia 
look at him  starling 
tell me what you see 
well  he s a white male 
serial killers tend to hunt
within their
own ethnic groups 
he s not a drifter 
he s got his own
house somewhere 
not an apartment 
why 
what he does with
them takes privacy 
he s in his 30s or 40s 
he s got real
physical strength 
combined with an older man s 
uh  self control 
he s cautious  precise 
and he s never impulsive 
he ll never stop 
why not 
he s got a real taste
for it now 
he s getting better
at his work 
not bad  starling 
questions 
yes  sir 
you haven t mentioned anything
about the information
contained in my report
or dr  lecter s offer  sir 
l m considering it 
that s why you sent me
in there  isn t it 
to get his help on
buffalo bill  sir 
well  if that was the
case  then l just     
l just wish l was

our top story
for this morning 
catherine martin 
the 25 year old daughter
of senator ruth martin 
listed first as
a missing person 
is now believed to
have been kidnapped
by the serial killer
known only as buffalo bill 
memphis police
sources indicate
that the missing
girl s blouse
has been identified 
sliced up the back
in what has become
a kind of grim 
all too familiar
calling card 
young catherine martin 
as we ve said 
is the only daughter
of u s  senator ruth martin 
the republican junior senator
from tennessee 
and while her kidnapping
is not  at this point 
considered to be
politically motivated 
nevertheless  it has
stirred the government
to its highest levels 
reached for a comment
on the ski slopes
of stowe  vermont 
the president
himself said to be 
and i quote 
 intensely concerned  
just moments ago 
senator martin
taped this dramatic
personal plea 
excuse me 
martin  i m speaking now
to the person who is
holding my daughter 
catherine is very
gentle and kind 
talk to her  and you ll see 
you have the power 
you are in charge 
i know you can feel
love and compassion 
you have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world
that you can be merciful
as well as strong

you have that power 
please 
my daughter is catherine 
ardella  boy  that s smart 
release her unharmed 
jesus  that s really smart 
man  she keeps
repeating the name 
lf he sees
catherine as a person
and not just an object 
it s harder to tear her up 
please 
release my little girl 
what you re doing 
miss starling 
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview
and refusing to share
information with me
for the third time 
sir  l told you 
this is just
a routine follow up
on the raspail case 
he is my patient 
l have rights 
l understand that  sir 
look  l am not
just some turnkey 
miss starling 
this is the number for
the u s  attorney s
office 
please  either you
discuss this with him 
or you let me do my job 
do you understand 
clarlce  lf your profile
helps us catch buffalo bill
in time to save
catherine martin 
the senator
promises you
a transfer
to the v a  hospital
at oneida park  new york 
with a view of
the woods nearby 
maximum security
still applies 
of course 
you d have reasonable
access to books 
best of all  though 
one week of the year 
you get to leave
the hospital and
go here 
plum lsland 
every day of that week
you may walk on the beach 
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour 
under swat team surveillance 
of course 
and there you have it 
a copy of the
buffalo bill
case file 
a copy of the
senator s offer 
this offer is
non negotiable
and final 
lf catherine martin dies 
you get nothing 
 thuddlng 
 plum lsland
animal disease
research center  
sounds charming 
that s only part
of the island 
there s a very 
very nice beach 
terns nest there 
there s beautiful     
terns  hmm 
lf l help you  clarice 
it will be  turns 
with us  too 
quid pro quo 
l tell you things 
you tell me things 
not about this case 
though  about yourself 
quid pro quo  yes or no 
yes or no  clarice 
poor little catherine
is waiting 
go  doctor 
what is your worst
memory of childhood 
the death of my father 
tell me about it 
and don t lie 
or l ll know 
he was a town marshal 
and one night
he surprised
two burglars
coming out of the back
of a drugstore 
they shot him 
was he killed outright 
no  he was very strong 
he lasted more than a month 
my mother died
when l was very young 
so my father had become
the whole world to me 
and when he left me 
l had nothing 
l was ten years old 
you re very frank  clarice 
l think it would
be quite something to
know you in private life 
quid pro quo  doctor 
so tell me about
miss west virginia 
was she a large girl 
yes 
big through the hips  roomy 
they all were 
what else 
she had an object
deliberately inserted
into her throat 
now  that hasn t
been made public yet 
we don t know
what it means 
was it a butterfly 
yes  a moth 
just like the one we found
in benjamin raspail s head
an hour ago 
why does he place
them there  doctor 
the significance
of the moth is change 
caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa 
and from thence into beauty 
our billy wants
to change  too 
there s no correlation
in literature
between transsexualism
and violence 
transsexuals
are very passive     
clever girl 
you re so close to the way
you re gonna catch him 
do you realize that 
no  tell me why 
after your father s murder 
you were orphaned 
what happened next 
l don t imagine
the answer is on those
second rate shoes  clarice 
l went to live
with my mother s cousin
and her husband in montana 
they had a ranch 
was it a cattle ranch 
sheep and horses 
how long did you live there 
two months 
why so briefly 
l ran away 
why  clarice 
did the rancher make
you perform fellatio 
did he sodomize you 
no  he was a very decent man 
quid pro quo  doctor 
billy is not
a real transsexual 
but he thinks he is 
he tries to be 
he s tried to be
a lot of things  l expect 
and you said that
l was very close
to the way
we would catch him 
what did you mean  doctor 
there are three major centers
for transsexual surgery 
johns hopkins 
the university of minnesota 
and columbus medical center 
l wouldn t be surprised
if billy had applied
for sex reassignment
at one or all of them
and been rejected 
on what basis
would they reject him 
lecter  look for severe
childhood disturbances
associated with violence 
our billy wasn t born
a criminal  clarice 
he was made one through
years of systematic abuse 
billy hates his own
identity  you see 
and he thinks that
makes him a transsexual 
but his pathology
is a thousand times
more savage
and more terrifying 
lt rubs the lotion

lt does this

sexual frustrations

and how do we begin
to covet  clarice

things to covet 
make an effort to answer now 
no  we just     
no  we begin by coveting
what we see every day
