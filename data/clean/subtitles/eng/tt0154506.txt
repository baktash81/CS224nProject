of what happened 
i d been on my own
for a while   
and getting kind of   
lonely and bored 
nothing to do all day 
and that s when
i started shadowing 
 shadowing  
shadowing  following 
i started to follow people 
  who 
  anyone at first  um   
i mean  that was the whole point 
somebody at random 
somebody who didn t know
who i was 
and then 
  and then    nothing 
   nothing  
nothing  i d just see   
where they went  what they did   
and go home afterwards 
why d you do it 
um  to see where they went 
anyone    i mean   
how can i explain 
you ever  um   
been to a football match 
just let your eyes   
go over  drift across
a crowd of people   
and they slowly stop
and fix on one person   
and all of a sudden that person
isn t part of the crowd anymore 
they ve become an individual 
just like that 
it just became irresistible 
  so you followed women 
  no  i didn t follow women 
it wasn t a sex thing 
i followed anybody 
i just wanted to see
where they went and what they did 
you were playing secret agent 
no  i m a writer 
well  i want to be a writer  anyway 
i was gathering material
for my characters 
well  to begin with 
after a while 
i spotted the dangers 
i d become hooked 
i had to start making up rules   
to just try
and keep it under control 
 never follow people for too long  
 don t follow women
down dark alleys after dark  
you know  stuff like that 
it was supposed
to just be completely random 
and when it stopped being random   
that s when it started to go wrong 
when i started to follow people   
specific people  when i selected   
a person to follow   
that was when the trouble started 
other people are interesting to me 
have you never   
listened to other people s
conversations on the bus   
or on the tube  seen people 
somebody on the street   
that looks interesting
or is behaving   
slightly    oddly or something
like that and wondered   
what their lives involved 
what they do   
where they come from 
where they go to 
you watch somebody s behavior 
and it raises   
a hundred thousand questions   
and i wanted to ask
those questions   
and i wanted to know
what the answers were 
and so i d follow people
to try and find out 
the most important rule was   
that even if i found out where
somebody worked or where they lived   
then you would never follow
the same person twice 
that was the most important rule 
that was the one that i broke first 
yes 
  uh  coffee  please 
  come on  it s lunch 
uh  toasted cheese sandwich as well 
mind if i join you 
who and why 
hi  yeah  um  i ll have
a black coffee please  and   
what s that 
another coffee  black 
you re obviously not a policeman  so
who are you and why are you following me 
i m sorry  i don t know
what you re talking about 
don t piss me about 
who the fuck are you 
oh  thank you very much 
sugar 
no  i wasn t   
i wasn t following you 
i    i   
i saw you with your bag 
i just thought
you looked interesting 
  what are you  a faggot 
  no  no 
okay  to tell you the truth 
i thought you were this guy   
that i was at school with 
i saw you walk in here  so i followed
you in just to see if it was him 
  but it wasn t 
  why didn t you ask me when you saw me 
 cause i d have been embarrassed
if it wasn t the person 
not as embarrassed
as you are now 
  no  i suppose not 
  what s your name 
bill 
well  bill  what do you do 
  actually  i m kind of   
  between jobs right now  yeah 
  yeah  that s right 
  what would you do 
  don t know 
  oh  come on  bill 
don t be coy  there s some burning
ambition inside you  isn t there 
there s something
of the starving artist in you  no 
  no  no 
  no 
  you re a painter 
  no    photos 
  no 
  writer    no 
  writer  eh 
  no 
  but you write 
  not much 
  but sometimes 
  sometimes  who doesn t 
me 
  so you re a writer 
  i didn t say that 
what makes you think
i m a writer  anyway 
an unemployed 20 something   
who fancies himself a writer   
a real leap into the unknown 
  well  i m not a writer 
  but you re interested in people 
  yeah 
  this person 
perhaps 
you haven t even
asked me my name yet   
  what s your name 
  or what s in my bag 
  what bag 
  my bag 
the one you ve been
looking at all morning 
what s your name 
and what s in your bag 
my name s cobb 
take a look for yourself 
what were you expecting 
drugs 
why would you nick their old cds 
easy to grab a load  easy to sell 
totally untraceable 
the other stuff s a bit more tricky 
you don t look like a burglar 
sounds like a compliment 
are you interested now 
gloves 
  people don t really do that  do they 
  you d be surprised 
does that really work 
wait and see 
beginner s luck 
see  nobody home 
okay  first things first 
we need a bag 
a bag 
to carry the stuff in 
why are you whispering 
don t you have one of your own 
yeah  it s a big bag with
 swag  written right across it 
ah  bingo 
okay  what do you fancy 
  nothing here of any value 
  you don t seem that concerned 
  i don t do it for the money 
  why do you do it 
for the adrenaline  and because 
like you  i m interested in people 
you can tell a lot about people
from their stuff 
  how old would you say these people are 
  don t know 
you can tell a lot from the futon  for
a start  young people have futons 
most people wouldn t be
anywhere near 40 with a futon 
and they ve got one laundry bag 
which means   
they re probably very used
to each other 
  probably about 25  over    they could be
20 and have been living together for years 
nah  no  look at the books 
they re college educated 
probably graduated
when they were 21 or 22 
moved in together in the last year 
you can tell more from the music 
and here is the box 
  what box 
  everyone has a box 
with men  it s usually a shoebox 
  are there valuables in it 
  no  more interesting  more personal 
things like snapshots  letters   
or trinkets from a christmas cracker 
see 
envelope  photo   
little calling cards  notes 
a sort of unconscious collection 
a display 
  what do you mean   display  
  well  display 
each thing tells something
very intimate about the people 
we re very privileged to see it 
it s very rare 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
what the   
what the hell d you do that for 
it s like a diary 
they hide it  but actually they want
someone to see it  that s what i do 
concealment  display   
flip sides of the same coin 
this way they know
that someone s seen it 
that s what it s all about   
interrupting someone s life   
making them see all the things
they took for granted 
like when they go back and buy
all this stuff from the shelves   
with the insurance money 
they ll have to think   
for the first time in a long time   
why they wanted all this stuff 
what it s for 
you take it away   
and show them what they had 
saucy  eh 
found these in the last flat 
think i ll just give them
something to chat about 
why would you do that 
she ll find them in his trousers
and ask him what he s been doing 
yeah  but why would you want
to fuck up their relationship 
don t you listen 
you take it away   
and show them what they had 
  fancy a drink 
  you ve gotta be joking 
oh  don t be fooled
by the supermarket label 
i seem to remember i ve had this before 
and it was actually quite good 
you d have had a bit of difficulty
doing this with your gloves on 
  so we actually gonna take anything 
  anything your heart desires 
although that s not really the point 
is it  i mean  it s just work 
i thought the whole point of burglary
was taking things 
no  this is the point    breaking in 
entering someone s life   
finding out who they really are 
i mean  don t you just feel it 
standing here   
drinking their wine   
people we ll never even meet 
would you like a drink 
i ve got some wine 
  holy f   
  shh 
you startled us  are you from the
agency  or are you viewing like us 
what are you doing in my flat 
  didn t the agent tell you we d be here
this afternoon    but we re not moving 
you must be the man of the house 
congratulations  you have a very nice home 
  but we re not moving 
  really 
oh  then i should check
with the agent then  love 
bye 
shit  we shouldn t have come up here 
we re gonna have to wait ages to get down 
there s a way up here 
jesus christ 
do you think they believed you 
of course they didn t
fucking believe me 
what the hell
do you think you were doing 
  i caught them on the hop  we surprised
them    how do you mean 
that bloke wasn t her boyfriend 
why do you think he didn t say anything 
no  she was up to no good  and she was
probably glad we weren t her boyfriend 
  you reckon 
  definitely  why else would she be home   
in the middle of the afternoon 
no  you just can t plan
for that kind of fucking shit 
we were unlucky  don t worry about it 
it won t happen again 
  yeah  well  i m not so sure 
  oh  yeah 
well  next time you can do
the fucking prep work 
  no  no  i didn t mean   
  no  i mean it 
take your mark  check it out   
for days  months  years  whatever 
  it ll be the next place we hit 
  yeah  all right 
  tell you what 
  what 
i feel bad about pulling
the panty routine on that bloke 
she s gonna give him loads of shit 
and she s the one fooling around 
a beer  please 
  buy you a drink 
  yeah 
  but you can t sleep with me 
  why is that 
 cause i m with the guy over there 
not that bald one 
he ll let you buy me a drink 
but sex is completely out of the question 
  still want to buy me that drink 
  no 
  so what s a nice girl like you   
  doing in a place like this 
doing with a bald old cunt like that 
it s a long story  and keep your voice
down   cause he does own this place 
i was trying to get your attention 
my name s daniel lloyd 
my friends call me danny 
so 
so you ve obviously had a bad day   
the kind that makes you feel like
everybody s out for their pound of flesh 
yeah 
i ve been having
quite a lot of days like that 
  say something to me 
  like what 
i ll see you outside in ten minutes 
  oh  i m sorry  it just   
  just came apart in your hands 
  it did  actually 
  yeah  i know  it was broken already 
it s all right 
somebody dropped it 
i ve been meaning to fix it   
but  uh   
i ll probably never get around to it 
so take a seat 
make yourself at home 
  so about you and this bald guy  then 
  what about him 
  going out with him 
  not exactly 
but you and him have
something going 
we used to go out with each other 
but that s been over for a long time 
so why did you tell me
you were with him 
to get rid of you 
so why  when you agreed to have
a drink with me  did we have to come here 
he still gets jealous  and  uh   
  i didn t feel like going back
to my place    why not 
i got burgled yesterday 
what s it feel like  being broken into 
most people ask 
 what did they take  
i m curious about the way people feel 
i m a writer 
gosh 
  so 
  so 
  so how d it feel 
  great 
sorry 
so this bald guy   
he s dangerous  is he 
  christ  you are a nosy bastard 
  dangerous like how 
dangerous like
criminal type dangerous 
dangerous like
 involved in bad things  type dangerous 
  what sort of bad things 
  the usual 
  girls  drugs  magazines 
  magazines 
and films  pornography 
and he owns a couple of clubs 
  wealthy type 
  yes 
and refined 
took me a long time to realize
the kind of things he was capable of 
and what sort of things are they 
perhaps another time 
i really think i should be going 
yeah 
  it s me    bill 
  what the fuck do you want 
  advice 
  on what 
  on a job 
  what fucking job 
  the job that i told you about 
  not interested 
yeah  i know that 
i m gonna do it myself 
wanna know something
about protection 
   protection  
  yeah  you know   
self defense  weapons 
stuff like that 
surprisingly enough  i thought
you might be able to give me some advice 
steel whip 
nunchucks  they re all right 
tools are good    sharpened
screwdriver  hammer  chisel   
   hammer  
  yeah  medium size  good rubber grip 
it s very nasty  if you get a claw hammer 
you can pry doors with it 
slip it into the back
of your waistband  you re set 
you still there 
why don t you get some of these 
for chrissake 
  where did you get them 
  stole them from middlesex hospital 
you can t buy them 
bin fucking go 
okay  you get the bag 
i ll check out the stuff 
  i got one 
  oh  that s good 
  may not need it  though  there s
fuck all here    really 
  well  what about the telly 
  it s fucking useless 
what are we  burglars or vandals 
well  if you re a burglar 
why don t you start burgling 
uh  what about the tapes 
  not much of a collection  and it s a
bit personal    what do you mean 
not the stuff you d play to your dinner party
guests to fill in gaps in conversation 
what sort of music s that 
i don t know  simply red 
fleetwood mac  that kind of shit 
  he s got taste 
  each to his own   
but he s a sad fucker
with no social life 
  ooh  nice machine 
  maybe he s a writer 
nah  if he was a writer 
he d have a word processor 
this guy wants to be a writer 
and those are two totally separate things 
  you checked this out 
  uh huh 
  you watched him go to work 
you saw his routine    yeah 
  what s his job 
  he works in a bank 
this guy s unemployed 
  no  he s not 
  look at the desk  he s unemployed 
people who have jobs don t have
this fucking shit in their homes 
he s either unemployed
or is a student   
which means he could be back
any fucking second  what the fuck is that 
i mean  you should recognize
the dole  boy  his fucking ub40 
you fucking asshole  you didn t
check this out at all  we re going now 
we re not gonna take anything 
no  we re not 
i don t feel like scrounging off   
some poor dole head fucker   
no offense 
none taken 
let s go to someplace
i ve checked out 
hi  make yourself at home 
i ll be down in just a minute 
  nice place 
  thanks 
feel a bit funny about it 
you know  since   
someone s been going through my stuff 
it s sort of creepy 
what d they take 
books  my camera  cds 
they even took a bag
from my cupboard to take it away in 
  apparently that s pretty standard 
  must be terrible  losing all that stuff 
insurance will cover most of it 
it s personal stuff that s worse 
 personal stuff   like what 
they  um 
rifled through my underwear 
shit  why would they do that 
come on  you know the kind of kinky 
voyeuristic shit men get into 
no  i m sorry 
i m not into any of that 
one other thing they did was
they took one of my earrings 
the didn t take the pair  they just
took one  just to really fuck me off 
you probably misplaced
the other one or something 
oh  no  i mean 
i had them on my dresser 
i came back 
and there was just one 
  so you just wear the other one now 
  gives me something to talk about 
i ll  uh   
i ll go and get some clothes on 
bill 
saucy  eh 
you haven t found a bag yet 
  is this her flat 
  yeah  she s a fox 
she s got pictures
of herself everywhere 
yeah  she looks good 
look at this stuff 
  you should take some of this stuff 
  no way 
suit yourself 
i m gonna take some  though 
look at her  she s a babe 
bingo 
why does she have
so many pictures of herself 
i think she s a model 
she s certainly vain 
is that about it 
yeah  i guess
that covers the useful stuff 
stereo s too big 
piano definitely too big 
i think   
i ll just misplace this for her 
  what is this place 
  used to be offices 
  how d you get the keys 
  broke in  changed the locks 
it s owned by one of those
management places  you know 
they never come around  and if they do  they ll
just think they ve mixed up their keys 
eventually they ll break in and change
the locks  but i ll be long gone by then 
london s full of these dead spaces 
above restaurants or shops 
whole buildings 
  do we leave the stuff here 
  no  that s your job 
you hang on to it till i let you know
we re ready to fence it 
  okay 
  unless   
you want to try to sell it yourself
and give me half of what you get 
i wouldn t know
what to do with it 
look  i was hard on you
on that last place   
but you ve got to understand 
i won t let anybody put me at risk 
  it s dangerous enough already 
  sure 
  an early supper  i think 
  i really can t afford it 
  it s covered 
  yeah 
okay 
authentic  i don t know 
but i like it 
so you keep on coming in here 
  i know  i like it  but   
  why  i don t know 
no  i do know why 
  why 
  well  because there s no windows   
and because it s dark  and nobody
can see you in the alcoves   
and so perhaps the bald guy
wouldn t come past 
  maybe 
  maybe  maybe this is where you bring
all the guys you go out with 
because you know that he s   
not just gonna be walking by 
popping in 
  maybe 
  maybe  yeah 
i thought it was over
between you two 
it is 
so how come you still go
to basement bars  then   
so that you can t be seen by him 
  because  as i ve told you before   
  because you re afraid of him   cause he s   
  because he s dangerous 
  dangerous 
dangerous    how how dangerous 
you keep on saying he s dangerous 
you never explain to me   
why you re so afraid of him 
okay 
he came around to my flat   
with a couple of his associates   
and    i didn t really know
what all this was about   
until this other guy arrived   
who apparently owed them
some money 
they didn t like this very much 
so they got a hammer 
they held him down  and they smashed
every single one of his fingers 
and then they smashed his skull 
someone get me
a tea towel or something 
you re joking with me 
no 
  you re not joking with me 
  uh uh 
this is why you don t
go out with him anymore 
no  no  no  that s because
he made a mess on my carpet 
that s not funny 
i know 
how on earth did you get
to fall in with somebody like this 
let s just change the subject  all right 
he s not the sort of bloke i d have
thought you d normally associate with 
  come on 
  what were you doing  were you   
 working  for him at the time 
that is none of your business 
i think you better find someone else
to start telling you little stories 
oh  come on 
i was just joking 
oh  jesus fucking christ 
think  think  think  think  think  think 
you re developing a taste for it 
the violating  the voyeurism   
oh  it s definitely you 
  i think not 
  i think so 
and before long you ll have developed a taste
for all the things that go with the proceeds 
  such as 
  well  all this 
do you make all your money
through burglary 
no  not all of it 
  in fact  you re gonna pay for this 
  i told you  i can t afford to 
don t worry  it won t really be you 
it ll be d  lloyd that pays for this 
i thought i d give you the pleasure
of pretending to pay 
  what am i supposed to do with this 
  sign it 
   sign it  
  sign it 
in your own handwriting 
then you can do anything you want with it 
 d  lloyd  
don t you ever worry
about being caught 
why else would i do it 
besides  i m not gonna get caught 
  what  you ve thought it all through 
  i ve thought it all through 
this is only the tip of the iceberg 
i will do things
that you don t even believe 
  such as   
  example 
sometimes when i m watching a flat 
i ll see that the owners   
are about to go on holiday 
i ll wait till they re gone 
then move in for a week or two 
you ve got to be joking 
no  happens a lot more
than you d believe 
how do you know
when they re gonna be back 
it s almost always marked
on the kitchen calendar 
christ 
jesus fucking christ 
  what s wrong 
  the woman    from the first flat 
  the one we broke into  she
just walked in    are you sure 
  yes  i am fucking sure 
  is she with the same bloke 
  no 
  it s all right  then 
  what if she sees us    she s with
her partner  she can t do anything 
i think that s
one hell of a chance to take 
what s she gonna say  we stole half a
bottle of indifferent red wine  calm down 
  do you mind if we skip dessert 
  yes  i fucking mind 
  she s coming this way 
  she s going to the loo 
  she saw me 
  oh  yeah 
she saw me  she recognizes us 
i think we should leave 
okay 
we ll leave  not that we ve got
anything to worry about   
except for you making
a fucking twat out of yourself 
i really hate it when i don t get to finish
a good meal with a cup of coffee 
  yeah  but   
  don t fucking say it 
she got a second look at me 
she recognized me 
that sort of thing makes me nervous 
if you re so worried about your appearance 
why don t you change it 
you know  new haircut 
new set of clothes 
your mother won t recognize you  just
because you break into people s homes   
doesn t mean you have to look
like a fucking burglar 
 everybody has a box  
  yeah 
  hello  it s bill 
oh  hello  bill 
what can i do for you 
not much  it s about the stuff 
what about the stuff 
i ve  uh  met this guy 
said he would fence most of it 
i thought i d have a go myself 
like you said 
i don t reckon
i ll get as much as you could   
but  um  you ll have half
of whatever i get 
how does that sound 
well  that sounds fine 
anything else 
  yeah  i took your advice 
  what advice 
about changing my appearance 
got my hair cut  i m all dressed up 
with no place to go 
god  bill  i wasn t being
entirely serious about that  you know 
yeah 
i just feel better this way 
  safer  huh 
  safer 
i ll give you a ring
when i get the money 
right 
what was all that about 
you 
your stuff  anyway 
he s gonna deal with it himself 
meaning 
meaning he took the bait 
and he s hooked 
he s gonna hang on to the stuff 
pretend to sell it  give me some money 
you may even get most of it back 
if you re lucky 
god  it s perfect 
the photos worked 
i even got him to cut his hair
and change his clothes 
so does that mean you ll tell me
where you hid my earring 
no 
and i wouldn t wait
for your panties either 
he s too embarrassed
to give those back to you 
shit  and did you have
to break my window 
couldn t you have found
a key or something 
no  that would ve been
three spare keys in a row 
even bill s not going to fall for that 
god  it was so embarrassing
when we went to his place 
right under the mat  just like i told him 
it s totally pathetic 
it was a new mat as well 
and i seriously think   
he bought this mat just so
he could put the key under it 
fuck off 
how did you know it was me 
that could ve been your mother
you just told to fuck off 
i meant it 
oh  come on  let me in 
i ve come to apologize 
  so apologize 
  i haven t been entirely honest with you 
i m doing a piece about burglaries 
what 
i m writing about burglaries 
about a friend of mine   
who breaks into people s houses 
that s why i asked you
so many questions about your break in 
i didn t tell you at the time  cause
i didn t want to upset you too much 
he s been breaking in  and i ve been   
i haven t stolen anything 
i just go along and   
see what happens 
is that it 
yes 
what s that got to do with anything 
now i ve been honest with you 
i want you to return the favor 
  i have been honest with you 
  you re still seeing the bald guy 
i was early the other day 
and i saw him leave 
  you said it was over 
  it is 
then why are you still seeing him 
he s blackmailing me 
  he s rich  why on earth would he   
  i didn t say anything about money 
  what s he blackmailing you with 
  photos 
of 
of me 
don t ask me anything else  i m not
feeding your seedy little fantasies 
you ve got me all wrong  you know 
  have i 
  yes 
  where are these pictures 
  in his office  why 
  i could take them 
  how 
i could break in 
me and this guy could do it 
there s got to be some valuable stuff
in his office  right 
  he sometimes keeps some money in
his safe    we can t get into his safe 
  that s where the photos are 
  what 
they re in an envelope   
the negatives and some of the prints 
  we can t do that 
  i know the combination 
how 
i ve seen him open it
loads of times 
i thought i might be able
to lift them myself 
that s what we ll do  then 
no one in their right minds
would steal from him 
if we don t get caught  it s not gonna
matter who it was we stole from   
and we re not going to get caught 
if you get them 
you won t look at the photos   
and you won t even look
in the envelope 
  of course not 
  i ve got your word on that 
you have my word 
  you re late 
  sorry 
i thought you said
you were gonna fence it yourself 
i got rid of most of it 
it ll take me a couple days
to get rid of all this 
that s what i thought 
is there something else
on your mind 
yeah  i want to hit a place 
i ve been scouting out
a couple places 
  a particular place  for some photos 
   photos  
yeah  for a friend 
  what s the place    the photos are in
a safe  but i ve got the combination 
well  if it s for a friend 
where s the money in it 
money s in the safe    probably 
 probably   whose office 
  a club owner  pornographer type 
  heavy 
yeah  looks like it 
what the fuck s going on 
  i m seeing someone 
  who 
  the owner of that bag 
  what 
the woman whose house we hit 
the one with the pictures of herself 
tell me you re fucking joking 
no 
i thought she looked interesting 
i followed her   
  we had a drink  and    now we re involved 
  have you slept with her 
yeah  we re gettin  on really well 
i wanted to give some of her stuff back
to her  but i thought that would mean   
you thought that would mean telling her
that you fucking robbed her 
how shrewd  i mean  how fucking
prudent of you not to tell her that 
that s a nice haircut  though 
nice suit as well 
  pity about the bloodstains on it 
  what blood   
you re on your own now 
here 
here s a present for you   
to get you started
on your new solo career 
  did you have to beat him 
  did you have to sleep with him 
  you told me to 
  i said you should if you had to   
but that s not really the same
as telling you to 
  did you enjoy it 
  did you enjoy beating him up 
of course 
look  i m in deep shit 
this is going to work 
do they really think
you re involved 
they ve already had me in
for questioning  haven t they 
it s not gonna be long before they find
the guy who saw me leave and pull me in 
  did he get a good look at you 
  no 
which is why i think
this is gonna work 
all we need is someone
of roughly the same appearance   
roughly the same way of working 
and we should be fine 
just tell them what really happened 
that you found her like that 
no  you wouldn t say that
if you saw what i saw 
no  i mean  this is horrible 
there s blood everywhere 
i mean  her head has been beaten 
she doesn t even look human anymore 
i mean  i d been there a while 
i may have left traces  prints 
forensic shit  i don t know 
the point is  the body s fresh 
it hasn t been dead long 
any witness might put me there
close enough to the time of death 
you just said the witness
didn t get a good look at you 
no  but that s not the point  is it 
a crime that brutal   
an old lady beaten to death 
if they even think it s me  they re gonna
try and pin it on me  aren t they 
no  we ve got to have someone else 
i ve even told them there s someone else 
  and if he s got an alibi 
  well  he s a loner 
he s perfect 
even strangers that have seen him before
aren t gonna recognize him   
because he s had his hair cut 
no  he s our man 
i ve got it 
i ve got to drop off
the fucking money first 
money  bundles of fucking money 
ow 
nothing  nothing 
 okay  
 okay  
i ll    i ll be around soon 
you promised me
you wouldn t open the envelope 
it wasn t sealed  they fell out 
   they fell out  
  so are you gonna explain 
i mean  what was it  was it all
just bullshit to get hold of the money 
there isn t usually any in there 
well  what  then 
it was for a friend 
the police think he did something 
and he didn t   
so he needs a decoy 
another likely suspect 
someone caught robbing a place using
the same way he does it  his methods 
 his methods  
who is the friend 
cobb 
broke into a place
a couple of weeks ago 
he found an old lady
bashed to death 
he ran off  someone saw him 
couple of days later  the police called him in
for questioning  they think he killed her 
he probably did 
no  he s a thief 
he s not a murderer 
so he told them
that they d got him confused   
with another burglar he knew 
one who used the same mo 
why me 
you set yourself up for it 
cobb noticed you following him
days before he actually approached you 
well  initially he thought
you were police   
  and then he followed you 
  he followed me 
he followed you
and realized you were just   
this sad little fucker
waiting to be used 
so you and cobb just went for it 
how could you do this to me 
to anybody 
it s not that serious 
you ve got the money 
you didn t kill the old lady 
you re just there to plant doubt
in the minds of the police 
they ll never charge you 
you were supposed to get caught
tonight breaking in 
they d pull you in  ask you about the old
lady  and you wouldn t know anything 
they could still have charged me
for breaking and entering 
but you did break and enter 
and for whatever reason 
you didn t get caught red handed 
he came in  he went down 
i didn t hang around long enough
to find out whether he could get up 
it s his blood on my hammer 
how could you do this to me 
it s nothing personal 
when i began this 
i didn t even know you 
  i m going to the police in the morning 
  you can t 
i m going 
and i m gonna tell them everything 
you can t 
 cause they won t believe you 
i m gonna tell them everything 
they ll believe me because it s the truth 
  not if you haven t got someone
to back up your story    you could 
i won t 
they ll make you  because your lies
won t stand up to the truth 
i wouldn t do this if i were you 
that s it 
i mean  if you ve got
any questions  then   
one or two 
you see  we don t actually have
any unsolved murders of old ladies   
  at the present 
  you must have 
there s no such ongoing investigation 
and we don t know
this mr  cobb of yours 
i warned you
he d look in the envelope 
he gave me his word 
i believed him 
it s nothing personal 
he couldn t help it 
i mean  he s a born peeper 
anyway  down to business 
 business  
perhaps there s   
something else
you d like to tell me  hmm 
anything 
  where s the hammer 
  it s in that bag 
what are you gonna do with it 
the old man was very specific
about how i should do things 
what s the old man
got to say about it 
well  he is letting me keep
all the money from his safe 
anything at all 
your side of things 
he says your demands
have become too unreasonable 
you ve become too greedy
in your blackmail 
he said something
about you being a witness   
to an incident
that happened in this very room 
he was very precise about exactly
how and where i should take care of things 
something about
a bloodstained carpet   
that you ve got stashed away
to back up your story   
should it ever be told 
did you talk to her 
we found her this morning 
what do you mean   found her  
her body 
we also found a hammer
with two types of blood on it 
one type i assume will match
the bloke you put in hospital 
all her fingers were smashed 
you must have tortured her
to get the combination 
i didn t touch her 
we also found
some interesting items in your flat   
in this shoebox under your bed 
among various items reported missing
by the deceased last week  we found   
these pairs of ladies  underwear 
are they hers 
i assume so 
since we found them stashed   
with these passport style
photographs of the deceased 
we also found this pearl earring   
which exactly matched   
the one worn by the deceased
at the time of her death 
  a little trophy 
  no 
it was cobb who planted it
when we turned over her place 
go and collar him 
i gave you his address 
we checked the address you gave us 
there s no cobb there 
the flat belongs to a mr   
d  lloyd 
he s just returned from holiday   
and he told us that while he was away 
his flat had been burgled 
not much was missing   
but his new credit card
hasn t yet arrived 
well  that was cobb 
we used it to   
pay for a meal in a restaurant
