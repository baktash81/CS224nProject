of what happened
id been on my own
for a while
and getting kind of
lonely and bored
nothing to do all day
and thats when
i started shadowing
shadowing
shadowing following
i started to follow people
who
anyone at first um
i mean that was the whole point
somebody at random
somebody who didnt know
who i was
and then
and then nothing
nothing
nothing id just see
where they went what they did
and go home afterwards
whyd you do it
um to see where they went
anyone i mean
how can i explain
you ever um
been to a football match
just let your eyes
go over drift across
a crowd of people
and they slowly stop
and fix on one person
and all of a sudden that person
isnt part of the crowd anymore
theyve become an individual
just like that
it just became irresistible
so you followed women
no i didnt follow women
it wasnt a sex thing
i followed anybody
i just wanted to see
where they went and what they did
you were playing secret agent
no im a writer
well i want to be a writer anyway
i was gathering material
for my characters
well to begin with
after a while
i spotted the dangers
id become hooked
i had to start making up rules
to just try
and keep it under control
never follow people for too long
dont follow women
down dark alleys after dark
you know stuff like that
it was supposed
to just be completely random
and when it stopped being random
thats when it started to go wrong
when i started to follow people
specific people when i selected
a person to follow
that was when the trouble started
other people are interesting to me
have you never
listened to other peoples
conversations on the bus
or on the tube seen people
somebody on the street
that looks interesting
or is behaving
slightly oddly or something
like that and wondered
what their lives involved
what they do
where they come from
where they go to
you watch somebodys behavior
and it raises
a hundred thousand questions
and i wanted to ask
those questions
and i wanted to know
what the answers were
and so id follow people
to try and find out
the most important rule was
that even if i found out where
somebody worked or where they lived
then you would never follow
the same person twice
that was the most important rule
that was the one that i broke first
yes
uh coffee please
come on its lunch
uh toasted cheese sandwich as well
mind if i join you
who and why
hi yeah um ill have
a black coffee please and
whats that
another coffee black
youre obviously not a policeman so
who are you and why are you following me
im sorry i dont know
what youre talking about
dont piss me about
who the fuck are you
oh thank you very much
sugar
no i wasnt
i wasnt following you
i i
i saw you with your bag
i just thought
you looked interesting
what are you a faggot
no no
okay to tell you the truth
i thought you were this guy
that i was at school with
i saw you walk in here so i followed
you in just to see if it was him
but it wasnt
why didnt you ask me when you saw me
cause id have been embarrassed
if it wasnt the person
not as embarrassed
as you are now
no i suppose not
whats your name
bill
well bill what do you do
actually im kind of
between jobs right now yeah
yeah thats right
what would you do
dont know
oh come on bill
dont be coy theres some burning
ambition inside you isnt there
theres something
of the starving artist in you no
no no
no
youre a painter
no  photos
no
writer  no
writer eh
no
but you write
not much
but sometimes
sometimes who doesnt
me
so youre a writer
i didnt say that
what makes you think
im a writer anyway
an unemployed 20something
who fancies himself a writer
a real leap into the unknown
well im not a writer
but youre interested in people
yeah
this person
perhaps
you havent even
asked me my name yet
whats your name
or whats in my bag
what bag
my bag
the one youve been
looking at all morning
whats your name
and whats in your bag
my names cobb
take a look for yourself
what were you expecting
drugs
why would you nick their old cds
easy to grab a load easy to sell
totally untraceable
the other stuffs a bit more tricky
you dont look like a burglar
sounds like a compliment
are you interested now
gloves
people dont really do that do they
youd be surprised
does that really work
wait and see
beginners luck
see nobody home
okay first things first
we need a bag
a bag
to carry the stuff in
why are you whispering
dont you have one of your own
yeah its a big bag with
swag written right across it
ah bingo
okay what do you fancy
nothing here of any value
you dont seem that concerned
i dont do it for the money
why do you do it
for the adrenaline and because
like you im interested in people
you can tell a lot about people
from their stuff
how old would you say these people are
dont know
you can tell a lot from the futon for
a start young people have futons
most people wouldnt be
anywhere near 40 with a futon
and theyve got one laundry bag
which means
theyre probably very used
to each other
probably about 25 over  they could be
20 and have been living together for years
nah no look at the books
theyre collegeeducated
probably graduated
when they were 21 or 22
moved in together in the last year
you can tell more from the music
and here is the box
what box
everyone has a box
with men its usually a shoebox
are there valuables in it
no more interesting more personal
things like snapshots letters
or trinkets from a christmas cracker
see
envelope photo
little calling cards notes
a sort of unconscious collection
a display
what do you mean display
well display
each thing tells something
very intimate about the people
were very privileged to see it
its very rare
hey hey hey hey
what the
what the helld you do that for
its like a diary
they hide it but actually they want
someone to see it thats what i do
concealment display
flip sides of the same coin
this way they know
that someones seen it
thats what its all about
interrupting someones life
making them see all the things
they took for granted
like when they go back and buy
all this stuff from the shelves
with the insurance money
theyll have to think
for the first time in a long time
why they wanted all this stuff
what its for
you take it away
and show them what they had
saucy eh
found these in the last flat
think ill just give them
something to chat about
why would you do that
shell find them in his trousers
and ask him what hes been doing
yeah but why would you want
to fuck up their relationship
dont you listen
you take it away
and show them what they had
fancy a drink
youve gotta be joking
oh dont be fooled
by the supermarket label
i seem to remember ive had this before
and it was actually quite good
youd have had a bit of difficulty
doing this with your gloves on
so we actually gonna take anything
anything your heart desires
although thats not really the point
is it i mean its just work
i thought the whole point of burglary
was taking things
no this is the point breaking in
entering someones life
finding out who they really are
i mean dont you just feel it
standing here
drinking their wine
people well never even meet
would you like a drink
ive got some wine
holy f
shh
you startled us are you from the
agency or are you viewing like us
what are you doing in my flat
didnt the agent tell you wed be here
this afternoon  but were not moving
you must be the man of the house
congratulations you have a very nice home
but were not moving
really
oh then i should check
with the agent then love
bye
shit we shouldnt have come up here
were gonna have to wait ages to get down
theres a way up here
jesus christ
do you think they believed you
of course they didnt
fucking believe me
what the hell
do you think you were doing
i caught them on the hop we surprised
them  how do you mean
that bloke wasnt her boyfriend
why do you think he didnt say anything
no she was up to no good and she was
probably glad we werent her boyfriend
you reckon
definitely why else would she be home
in the middle of the afternoon
no you just cant plan
for that kind of fucking shit
we were unlucky dont worry about it
it wont happen again
yeah well im not so sure
oh yeah
well next time you can do
the fucking prep work
no no i didnt mean
no i mean it
take your mark check it out
for days months years whatever
itll be the next place we hit
yeah all right

what
i feel bad about pulling
the panty routine on that bloke
shes gonna give him loads of shit
and shes the one fooling around
a beer please
buy you a drink
yeah
but you cant sleep with me
why is that
cause im with the guy over there
not that bald one
hell let you buy me a drink
but sex is completely out of the question
still want to buy me that drink
no
so whats a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this
doing with a bald old cunt like that
its a long story and keep your voice
down cause he does own this place
i was trying to get your attention
my names daniel lloyd
my friends call me danny
so
so youve obviously had a bad day
the kind that makes you feel like
everybodys out for their pound of flesh
yeah
ive been having
quite a lot of days like that
say something to me
like what
ill see you outside in ten minutes
oh im sorry it just
just came apart in your hands
it did actually
yeah i know it was broken already
its all right
somebody dropped it
ive been meaning to fix it
but uh
ill probably never get around to it
so take a seat
make yourself at home
so about you and this bald guy then
what about him
going out with him
not exactly
but you and him have
something going
we used to go out with each other
but thats been over for a long time
so why did you tell me
you were with him
to get rid of you
so why when you agreed to have
a drink with me did we have to come here
he still gets jealous and uh
i didnt feel like going back
to my place  why not
i got burgled yesterday
whats it feel like being broken into
most people ask
what did they take
im curious about the way people feel
im a writer
gosh
so

so howd it feel
great

so this bald guy
hes dangerous is he
christ you are a nosy bastard
dangerous like how

criminaltype dangerous

involved in bad things type dangerous
what sort of bad things
the usual
girls drugs magazines
magazines
and films pornography
and he owns a couple of clubs
wealthy type
yes
and refined
took me a long time to realize
the kind of things he was capable of
and what sort of things are they
perhaps another time
i really think i should be going
yeah
its me bill
what the fuck do you want
advice
on what
on a job
what fucking job
the job that i told you about
not interested
yeah i know that
im gonna do it myself
wanna know something
about protection
protection
yeah you know
selfdefense weapons
stuff like that
surprisingly enough i thought
you might be able to give me some advice
steel whip
nunchucks theyre all right
tools are good sharpened
screwdriver hammer chisel
hammer
yeah medium size good rubber grip
its very nasty if you get a claw hammer
you can pry doors with it
slip it into the back
of your waistband youre set
you still there
why dont you get some of these
for chrissake
where did you get them
stole them from middlesex hospital
you cant buy them
binfuckinggo
okay you get the bag
ill check out the stuff
i got one
oh thats good
may not need it though theres
fuckall here  really
well what about the telly
its fucking useless
what are we burglars or vandals
well if youre a burglar
why dont you start burgling
uh what about the tapes
not much of a collection and its a
bit personal  what do you mean
not the stuff youd play to your dinner party
guests to fill in gaps in conversation
what sort of musics that
i dont know simply red
fleetwood mac that kind of shit
hes got taste
each to his own
but hes a sad fucker
with no social life
ooh nice machine
maybe hes a writer
nah if he was a writer
hed have a word processor
this guy wants to be a writer
and those are two totally separate things
you checked this out
uhhuh
you watched him go to work
you saw his routine  yeah
whats his job
he works in a bank
this guys unemployed
no hes not
look at the desk hes unemployed
people who have jobs dont have
this fucking shit in their homes
hes either unemployed
or is a student
which means he could be back
any fucking second what the fuck is that
i mean you should recognize
the dole boy his fucking ub40
you fucking asshole you didnt
check this out at all were going now
were not gonna take anything
no were not
i dont feel like scrounging off
some poor dolehead fucker
no offense
none taken
lets go to someplace
ive checked out
hi make yourself at home
ill be down in just a minute
nice place
thanks
feel a bit funny about it
you know since
someones been going through my stuff
its sort of creepy
whatd they take
books my camera cds
they even took a bag
from my cupboard to take it away in
apparently thats pretty standard
must be terrible losing all that stuff
insurance will cover most of it
its personal stuff thats worse
personal stuff like what
they um
rifled through my underwear
shit why would they do that
come on you know the kind of kinky
voyeuristic shit men get into
no im sorry
im not into any of that
one other thing they did was
they took one of my earrings
the didnt take the pair they just
took one just to really fuck me off
you probably misplaced
the other one or something
oh no i mean
i had them on my dresser
i came back
and there was just one
so you just wear the other one now
gives me something to talk about
ill uh
ill go and get some clothes on
bill
saucy eh
you havent found a bag yet
is this her flat
yeah shes a fox
shes got pictures
of herself everywhere
yeah she looks good
look at this stuff
you should take some of this stuff
no way
suit yourself
im gonna take some though
look at her shes a babe
bingo
why does she have
so many pictures of herself
i think shes a model
shes certainly vain
is that about it
yeah i guess
that covers the useful stuff
stereos too big
piano definitely too big
i think
ill just misplace this for her
what is this place
used to be offices
howd you get the keys
broke in changed the locks
its owned by one of those
management places you know
they never come around and if they do theyll
just think theyve mixed up their keys
eventually theyll break in and change
the locks but ill be long gone by then
londons full of these dead spaces
above restaurants or shops
whole buildings
do we leave the stuff here
no thats your job
you hang on to it till i let you know
were ready to fence it
okay
unless
you want to try to sell it yourself
and give me half of what you get
i wouldnt know
what to do with it
look i was hard on you
on that last place
but youve got to understand
i wont let anybody put me at risk
its dangerous enough already
sure
an early supper i think
i really cant afford it
its covered
yeah
okay
authentic i dont know
but i like it
so you keep on coming in here
i know i like it but
why i dont know
no i do know why
why
well because theres no windows
and because its dark and nobody
can see you in the alcoves
and so perhaps the bald guy
wouldnt come past
maybe
maybe maybe this is where you bring
all the guys you go out with
because you know that hes
not just gonna be walking by
popping in
maybe
maybe yeah
i thought it was over
between you two
it is
so how come you still go
to basement bars then
so that you cant be seen by him
because as ive told you before
because youre afraid of him cause hes
because hes dangerous
dangerous
dangerous howhow dangerous
you keep on saying hes dangerous
you never explain to me
why youre so afraid of him
okay
he came around to my flat
with a couple of his associates
and i didnt really know
what all this was about
until this other guy arrived
who apparently owed them
some money
they didnt like this very much
so they got a hammer
they held him down and they smashed
every single one of his fingers
and then they smashed his skull
someone get me
a tea towel or something
youre joking with me
no
youre not joking with me
uhuh
this is why you dont
go out with him anymore
no no no thats because
he made a mess on my carpet
thats not funny
i know
how on earth did you get
to fall in with somebody like this
lets just change the subject all right
hes not the sort of bloke id have
thought youd normally associate with
come on
what were you doing were you
working for him at the time
that is none of your business
i think you better find someone else
to start telling you little stories
oh come on
i was just joking
oh jesus fucking christ
think think think think think think
youre developing a taste for it
the violating the voyeurism
oh its definitely you
i think not
i think so
and before long youll have developed a taste
for all the things that go with the proceeds
such as
well all this
do you make all your money
through burglary
no not all of it
in fact youre gonna pay for this
i told you i cant afford to
dont worry it wont really be you
itll be d lloyd that pays for this
i thought id give you the pleasure
of pretending to pay
what am i supposed to do with this
sign it
sign it
sign it
in your own handwriting
then you can do anything you want with it
d lloyd
dont you ever worry
about being caught
why else would i do it
besides im not gonna get caught
what youve thought it all through
ive thought it all through
this is only the tip of the iceberg
i will do things
that you dont even believe
such as
example
sometimes when im watching a flat
ill see that the owners
are about to go on holiday
ill wait till theyre gone
then move in for a week or two
youve got to be joking
no happens a lot more
than youd believe
how do you know
when theyre gonna be back
its almost always marked
on the kitchen calendar
christ
jesus fucking christ
whats wrong
the woman from the first flat
the one we broke into she
just walked in  are you sure
yes i am fucking sure
is she with the same bloke
no
its all right then
what if she sees us  shes with
her partner she cant do anything
i think thats
one hell of a chance to take
whats she gonna say we stole half a
bottle of indifferent red wine calm down
do you mind if we skip dessert
yes i fucking mind
shes coming this way
shes going to the loo
she saw me
oh yeah
she saw me she recognizes us
i think we should leave
okay
well leave not that weve got
anything to worry about
except for you making
a fucking twat out of yourself
i really hate it when i dont get to finish
a good meal with a cup of coffee
yeah but
dont fucking say it
she got a second look at me
she recognized me
that sort of thing makes me nervous
if youre so worried about your appearance
why dont you change it
you know new haircut
new set of clothes
your mother wont recognize you just
because you break into peoples homes
doesnt mean you have to look
like a fucking burglar
everybody has a box
yeah
hello its bill
oh hello bill
what can i do for you
not much its about the stuff
what about the stuff
ive uh met this guy
said he would fence most of it
i thought id have a go myself
like you said
i dont reckon
ill get as much as you could
but um youll have half
of whatever i get
how does that sound
well that sounds fine
anything else
yeah i took your advice
what advice
about changing my appearance
got my hair cut im all dressed up
with no place to go
god bill i wasnt being
entirely serious about that you know
yeah
i just feel better this way
safer huh
safer
ill give you a ring
when i get the money
right
what was all that about
you
your stuff anyway
hes gonna deal with it himself
meaning
meaning he took the bait
and hes hooked
hes gonna hang on to the stuff
pretend to sell it give me some money
you may even get most of it back
if youre lucky
god its perfect
the photos worked
i even got him to cut his hair
and change his clothes
so does that mean youll tell me
where you hid my earring
no
and i wouldnt wait
for your panties either
hes too embarrassed
to give those back to you
shit and did you have
to break my window
couldnt you have found
a key or something
no that wouldve been
three spare keys in a row
even bills not going to fall for that
god it was so embarrassing
when we went to his place
right under the mat just like i told him
its totally pathetic
it was a new mat as well
and i seriously think
he bought this mat just so
he could put the key under it
fuck off
how did you know it was me
that couldve been your mother
you just told to fuck off
i meant it
oh come on let me in
ive come to apologize
so apologize
i havent been entirely honest with you
im doing a piece about burglaries
what
im writing about burglaries
about a friend of mine
who breaks into peoples houses
thats why i asked you
so many questions about your breakin
i didnt tell you at the time cause
i didnt want to upset you too much
hes been breaking in and ive been
i havent stolen anything
i just go along and
see what happens
is that it
yes
whats that got to do with anything
now ive been honest with you
i want you to return the favor
i have been honest with you
youre still seeing the bald guy
i was early the other day
and i saw him leave
you said it was over
it is
then why are you still seeing him
hes blackmailing me
hes rich why on earth would he
i didnt say anything about money
whats he blackmailing you with
photos
of
of me
dont ask me anything else im not
feeding your seedy little fantasies
youve got me all wrong you know
have i
yes
where are these pictures
in his office why
i could take them
how
i could break in
me and this guy could do it
theres got to be some valuable stuff
in his office right
he sometimes keeps some money in
his safe  we cant get into his safe
thats where the photos are
what
theyre in an envelope
the negatives and some of the prints
we cant do that
i know the combination
how
ive seen him open it
loads of times
i thought i might be able
to lift them myself
thats what well do then
no one in their right minds
would steal from him
if we dont get caught its not gonna
matter who it was we stole from
and were not going to get caught
if you get them
you wont look at the photos
and you wont even look
in the envelope
of course not
ive got your word on that
you have my word
youre late
sorry
i thought you said
you were gonna fence it yourself
i got rid of most of it
itll take me a couple days
to get rid of all this
thats what i thought
is there something else
on your mind
yeah i want to hit a place
ive been scouting out
a couple places
a particular place for some photos
photos
yeah for a friend
whats the place  the photos are in
a safe but ive got the combination
well if its for a friend
wheres the money in it
moneys in the safe probably
probably whose office
a club owner pornographer type
heavy
yeah looks like it
what the fucks going on
im seeing someone
who
the owner of that bag
what
the woman whose house we hit
the one with the pictures of herself
tell me youre fucking joking
no
i thought she looked interesting
i followed her
we had a drink and now were involved
have you slept with her
yeah were gettin on really well
i wanted to give some of her stuff back
to her but i thought that would mean
you thought that would mean telling her
that you fucking robbed her
how shrewd i mean how fucking
prudent of you not to tell her that
thats a nice haircut though
nice suit as well
pity about the bloodstains on it
what blood
youre on your own now
here
heres a present for you
to get you started
on your new solo career
did you have to beat him
did you have to sleep with him
you told me to
i said you should if you had to
but thats not really the same
as telling you to
did you enjoy it
did you enjoy beating him up
of course
look im in deep shit
this is going to work
do they really think
youre involved
theyve already had me in
for questioning havent they
its not gonna be long before they find
the guy who saw me leave and pull me in
did he get a good look at you
no
which is why i think
this is gonna work
all we need is someone
of roughly the same appearance
roughly the same way of working
and we should be fine
just tell them what really happened
that you found her like that
no you wouldnt say that
if you saw what i saw
no i mean this is horrible
theres blood everywhere
i mean her head has been beaten
she doesnt even look human anymore
i mean id been there a while
i may have left traces prints
forensic shit i dont know
the point is the bodys fresh
it hasnt been dead long
any witness might put me there
close enough to the time of death
you just said the witness
didnt get a good look at you
no but thats not the point is it
a crime that brutal
an old lady beaten to death
if they even think its me theyre gonna
try and pin it on me arent they
no weve got to have someone else
ive even told them theres someone else
and if hes got an alibi
well hes a loner
hes perfect
even strangers that have seen him before
arent gonna recognize him
because hes had his hair cut
no hes our man
ive got it
ive got to drop off
the fucking money first
money bundles of fucking money
ow
nothing nothing
okay
okay
ill ill be around soon
you promised me
you wouldnt open the envelope
it wasnt sealed they fell out
they fell out
so are you gonna explain
i mean what was it was it all
just bullshit to get hold of the money
there isnt usually any in there
well what then
it was for a friend
the police think he did something
and he didnt
so he needs a decoy
another likely suspect
someone caught robbing a place using
the same way he does it his methods
his methods
who is the friend
cobb
broke into a place
a couple of weeks ago
he found an old lady
bashed to death
he ran off someone saw him
couple of days later the police called him in
for questioning they think he killed her
he probably did
no hes a thief
hes not a murderer
so he told them
that theyd got him confused
with another burglar he knew
one who used the same mo
why me
you set yourself up for it
cobb noticed you following him
days before he actually approached you
well initially he thought
you were police
and then he followed you
he followed me
he followed you
and realized you were just
this sad little fucker
waiting to be used
so you and cobb just went for it
how could you do this to me
to anybody
its not that serious
youve got the money
you didnt kill the old lady
youre just there to plant doubt
in the minds of the police
theyll never charge you
you were supposed to get caught
tonight breaking in
theyd pull you in ask you about the old
lady and you wouldnt know anything
they could still have charged me
for breaking and entering
but you did break and enter
and for whatever reason
you didnt get caught redhanded
he came in he went down
i didnt hang around long enough
to find out whether he could get up
its his blood on my hammer
how could you do this to me
its nothing personal
when i began this
i didnt even know you
im going to the police in the morning
you cant
im going
and im gonna tell them everything
you cant
cause they wont believe you
im gonna tell them everything
theyll believe me because its the truth
not if you havent got someone
to back up your story  you could
i wont
theyll make you because your lies
wont stand up to the truth
i wouldnt do this if i were you
thats it
i mean if youve got
any questions then
one or two
you see we dont actually have
any unsolved murders of old ladies
at the present
you must have
theres no such ongoing investigation
and we dont know
this mr cobb of yours
i warned you
hed look in the envelope
he gave me his word
i believed him
its nothing personal
he couldnt help it
i mean hes a born peeper
anyway down to business
business
perhaps theres
something else
youd like to tell me hmm
anything
wheres the hammer
its in that bag
what are you gonna do with it
the old man was very specific
about how i should do things
whats the old man
got to say about it
well he is letting me keep
all the money from his safe
anything at all
your side of things
he says your demands
have become too unreasonable
youve become too greedy
in your blackmail
he said something
about you being a witness
to an incident
that happened in this very room
he was very precise about exactly
how and where i should take care of things
something about
a bloodstained carpet
that youve got stashed away
to back up your story
should it ever be told
did you talk to her
we found her this morning
what do you mean found her
her body
we also found a hammer
with two types of blood on it
one type i assume will match
the bloke you put in hospital
all her fingers were smashed
you must have tortured her
to get the combination
i didnt touch her
we also found
some interesting items in your flat
in this shoebox under your bed
among various items reported missing
by the deceased last week we found
these pairs of ladies underwear
are they hers
i assume so
since we found them stashed
with these passportstyle
photographs of the deceased
we also found this pearl earring
which exactly matched
the one worn by the deceased
at the time of her death
a little trophy
no
it was cobb who planted it
when we turned over her place
go and collar him
i gave you his address
we checked the address you gave us
theres no cobb there
the flat belongs to a mr
d lloyd
hes just returned from holiday
and he told us that while he was away
his flat had been burgled
not much was missing
but his new credit card
hasnt yet arrived
well that was cobb
we used it to
pay for a meal in a restaurant
