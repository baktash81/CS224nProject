uh oh  the princess
is trapped
in the snow goblin s
evil spell 
quick  elsa  make a prince 
a fancy one 
oh  no  the prince
is trapped  too 
who cares about danger
when there s love 
ugh  anna  bleugh 
kissing won t save
the forest 
the lost fairies cry out 
what sound
does a giraffe make 
never mind 
they wake
the fairy queen   
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone 
and they all get married 
what are you playing 
enchanted forest 
the prince
and the princess   
hmm  that s like no enchanted
forest i ve ever seen 
you ve seen
an enchanted forest 
wait  what 
i have  once 
and you ve never
told us this before 
well  i could
tell you now  if you   
  okay  now 
  tell us now 
are you sure about this 
it s time they know 
let s make
a big snowman later 
if they can settle
and listen 
far away   
as north as we can go   
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest 
but its magic wasn t that of
goblin spells
and lost fairies 
it was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all   
those of air   
of fire   
of water   
and earth 
but it was also home
to the mysterious
northuldra people 
were the
northuldra magical  like me 
no  elsa 
they were not magical 
they just took advantage
of the forest s gifts 
their ways
were so different from ours   
but still 
they promised us friendship 
in honor of that 
your grandfather 
king runeard 
built them a mighty dam   
to strengthen their waters 
it was a gift of peace 
that s a big gift of peace 
and i was so honored
to get to go to the forest
to celebrate it 
stand tall  agnarr 
i wasn t
at all prepared
for what the day would bring 
we let down our guard 
we were charmed 
whoa  whoa 
it felt so   
magical 
but something went wrong 
they were attacking us 
get behind me 
it was
a brutal battle 
your grandfather   
father 
   was lost 
aah 
the fighting
enraged the spirits 
look out 
they turned
their magic against us all 
there was this voice   
   and someone saved me 
i m told the spirits
then vanished 
and a powerful mist
covered the forest 
locking everyone out 
and that night  i came home
king of arendelle 
whoa  papa  that was epic 
whoever saved you 
i love them 
i wish i knew
who it was 
what happened to the spirits 
what s in the forest now 
i don t know 
the mist
still stands 
no one
can get in 
and no one
has since come out 
so we re safe 
yes 
but the forest
could wake again 
and we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring 
and on that note 
how about we say good night
to your father 
but i still
have so many questions 
save them
for another night  anna 
you know i don t
have that kind of patience 
why did northuldra
attack us anyway 
who attacks people
who give them gifts 
do you think the
forest will wake again 
only ahtohallan knows 
octa who what 
when i was little   
my mother
would sing a song
about a special river
called ahtohallan   
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past 
about what we are
a part of 
wow 
will you sing it
for us  please 
okay 
cuddle close 
scooch in 
  where the northwind
  meets the sea
  there s a river
  full of memory
  sleep  my darling 
safe and sound
  for in this river 
all is found
  in her waters
  deep and true
  lie the answers
  and a path for you
  dive down deep
into her sound
  but not too far
or you ll be drowned
  yes  she will sing
to those who hear
  and in her song 
all magic flows
  but can you brave
what you most fear 
  can you face
what the river knows 
  where the northwind
  meets the sea
  there s a mother
  full of memory
  come  my darling 
homeward bound
  when all is lost
  then all is found  
  your majesty 
  oh 
they re ready 
excuse me 
i m coming 
do you hear that 
what 
never mind 
enjoying
your new permafrost  olaf 
i m just living
the dream  anna 
how i wish
  this could last forever 
  mmm 
and yet  change mocks us
with her beauty 
what s that 
forgive me 
maturity is making me poetic 
tell me  you re older
and thus all knowing   
do you ever worry
about the notion that   
nothing is permanent 
uh    no 
really 
wow  i can t wait until
i m ancient like you   
so i don t have to worry
about important things 
that s not what i mean 
i don t worry because   
well  i have you and elsa
and kristoff and sven   
and the gates
are open wide   
and i m not alone anymore 
  yes  the wind blows
a little bit colder
  and we re all getting older
  and the clouds are moving on
with every autumn breeze
  peter pumpkin
just became fertilizer
  and my leaf s
a little sadder and wiser
  that s why i rely
on certain certainties
  yes  some things
never change
  like the feel
of your hand in mine
  some things
stay the same
  like how we get along
just fine
  like an old stone wall
that ll never fall
  some things
are always true 
  some things never change
  like how
i m holding on tight to you
  the leaves
are already falling
  sven  it feels
like the future is calling
  are you telling me tonight
  you re gonna get down
on one knee 
  yeah  but i m really bad
at planning these things out
  like candlelight and
pulling of rings out
  maybe you should leave
all the romantic stuff to me 
  yeah  some things
never change
  like the love
that i feel for her
  some things stay the same
  like how reindeers
are easier
  but if i commit
and i go for it
  i ll know
what to say and do 
  right 
  some things never change
  sven  the pressure
is all on you
  the winds are restless
  could that be why
i m hearing this call 
  is something coming 
  i m not sure i want
things to change at all
  these days are precious
  can t let them slip away
  i can t freeze this moment
  but i can still go out
and seize this day 
oh 
  the wind blows
a little bit colder
  and you all look
a little bit older
  it s time to count
our blessings
  beneath an autumn sky
  we ll always live
in a kingdom of plenty
  that stands
for the good of the many 
  and i promise you the flag
of arendelle will always fly 
  our flag will always fly 
  our flag will always fly
our flag will always fly
  some things never change
  turn around
and the time has flown
  some things stay the same
  though the future
remains unknown
  may our good luck last
may our past be past
  time s moving fast 
it s true
  some things never change
  and i m holding
on tight to you
  holding on tight to you
    holding on tight to you
    holding on tight to you
  i m holding on tight
to you

  i can hear you

  while others don t
  there s a thousand reasons
i should go about my day
  and ignore your whispers
  which i wish
would go away  oh
  oh
  you re not a voice
  you re just
a ringing in my ear
  and if i heard you
  which i don t
  i m spoken for  i fear
  everyone i ve ever loved
is here within these walls
  i m sorry  secret siren
  but i m blocking out
your calls
  i ve had my adventure
i don t need something new
  i m afraid of what i m
risking if i follow you
  into the unknown
  into the unknown
  into the unknown
  what do you want 
   cause you ve been
keeping me awake
  are you here
to distract me
  so i make a big mistake 
  or are you someone out there
  who s a little bit like me
  who knows deep down
  i m not where
i m meant to be 
  every day s a little harder
  as i feel my power grow
  don t you know there s
part of me that longs to go
  into the unknown 
  into the unknown 
  into the unknown 
  whoa oh oh
  are you out there 
do you know me 
  can you feel me 
can you show me 
  where are you going 
don t leave me alone
  how do i follow you
  into the unknown   
air  fire  water  earth

the air rages 
no fire  no water 
the earth is next 
we have to get out 
it ll be okay 
evacuate to the cliffs 
oh  no 
i m gonna blow 
i ve got you 
yes 
everyone s out and safe 
  here  take one of these 
  huh 
you okay there  olaf 
oh  yeah 
we re calling this   
 controlling what you can when
things feel out of control  
okay  i don t understand 
you ve been hearing
a voice
and you didn t think
to tell me 
i didn t want to worry you 
we made a promise not
to shut each other out 
just tell me
what s going on 
i woke the magical spirits
at the enchanted forest 
okay  that s
definitely not
what i thought
you were gonna say 
wait  the enchanted forest 
the one
father warned us about 
yes 
why would you do that 
because of the voice 
i know it sounds crazy   
but i believe whoever
is calling me is good 
how can you say that 
look at our kingdom 
i know  it s just that
my magic can feel it 
i can feel it 
okay 
oh  no  what now 
the trolls 
  kristoff  we missed you 
  oh 
pabbie 
well  never a dull moment
with you two 
i hope you re prepared
for what you have done  elsa 
angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart 
why are they still angry 
what does all of this
have to do with arendelle 
let me see
what i can see 
the past is not
what it seems 
a wrong demands to be righted 
arendelle is not safe 
the truth must be found 
without it   
i see no future 
no future 
when one can see
no future   
all one can do
is the next right thing 
the next right thing
is for me to go
to the enchanted forest   
and find that voice 
kristoff  can i borrow
your wagon
  and sven 
  hmm 
i m not very comfortable
with the idea of that 
  you are not going alone 
  anna  no 
i have my powers
to protect me  you don t 
excuse me  i climbed
the north mountain   
survived a frozen heart 
and saved you
from my ex boyfriend   
and i did it
all without powers 
so  you know  i m coming 
me  too  i ll drive 
i ll bring the snacks 
i will look
after your people 
please make sure they stay
out of the kingdom
until we return 
of course 
let s let them know 
anna  i am worried
for her 
we have always feared
elsa s powers were too much
for this world 
now  we must pray
they are enough 
i won t let anything
happen to her 
hyah 
who s into trivia 
i am  okay 
did you know that water
has memory  true fact 
it s disputed by many 
but it s true 
did you know
men are six times
more likely to be
struck by lightning 
did you know gorillas
burp when they re happy 
did you know we blink
four million times a day 
did you know
wombats poop squares 
did you know
sleeping quietly
on long journeys
prevents insanity 
  yeah  that s not true 
  it is 
  it s true 
  definitely true 
no  it s the truth 
well 
that was unanimous 
but i will look it up
when we get home 
they re both asleep 
so  what do you
wanna do 
sven  keep us steady 
will ya 
  hmm   
  anna  ahem 
  anna 
  mm hmm 
remember
our first trip like this   
when i said
you d have to be crazy
to want to marry
a man you just met 
wait  what  crazy 
you didn t say i was crazy 
you think i m crazy 
no  i did 
  you were   
  huh 
   not crazy 
clearly 
just naive 
not naive  just  uh 
new to love  like i was 
and when you re new 
you re bound to get it wrong 
so you re saying
i m wrong for you 
what  no  no 
i m not saying
you re wrong  or crazy 
  kristoff  stop  please 
  good idea 
i hear it 
i hear the voice 
you do 
olaf  wake up 
  whoa 
  wow 
whoa  what the   
whoa 
promise me 
we do this together  okay 
i promise 
it s okay 
did you know
that an enchanted forest
is a place
of transformation 
i have no idea
what that means   
but i can t wait to see
what it s gonna do
to each one of us 
  hey 
  what is this 
  no pushing 
  stop it 
  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  it s too fast 
what was that 
no  no  no  no 
and we re locked in 
probably should have seen
that one coming 
this forest is beautiful 
ooh 
the dam  it still stands 
it was
in grand pabbie s visions 
but why 
i don t know  but it s still
in good shape  thank goodness 
what do you mean 
well  if that dam broke   
it would send
a tidal wave so big
it would wash away
everything on this fjord 
everything 
but arendelle s
on this fjord 
nothing s gonna happen
to arendelle  anna 
it s gonna be fine 
come here 
you know 
under different circumstances 
this would be a  uh 
pretty romantic place 
don t you think 
different circumstances 
you mean 
like with someone else 
what  no  no 
i m saying   
just in case we don t
make it out of here   
wait  what 
you don t think we re gonna
make it out of here 
no  no 
i mean  no 
we will make it out of here 
well  technically the odds
are kind of complicated 
but my point is   
in case we die   
  you think we re gonna die 
  no  no  no  no 
  where s elsa 
  we will die at some point 
i swore that
i wouldn t leave her side 
not in any
recent time will we die 
  elsa 
  but way far in the future 
we will die 
don t patronize me 
elsa 
there you are 
  you okay 
  i m fine 
okay  good 
where s olaf 
um   
anna 
elsa 
sven 
samantha 
i don t even know
a samantha 
whoa 
mm 
that s normal 
what was that 
samantha 
  this will all make sense
when i am older
  someday i will see
that this makes sense
  one day when i m old and wise
i ll think back and realize
  that these were all
completely normal events 
  i ll have all the answers
when i m older
  like why we re in this
dark enchanted wood
  i know in a couple years
  these will seem
like childish fears
  and so i know
this isn t bad  it s good
  excuse me
  growing up means adapting
  puzzling out your world
and your place
  when i m more mature
i ll feel totally secure
  being watched by something
with a creepy  creepy face
  see  that will all make
sense when i am older
  so there s no need
to be terrified or tense
  i ll just dream about a time
  when i m in my aged prime
   cause when you re older
  absolutely everything
makes sense   
this is fine 
  whoa 
  olaf 
hey  guys 
meet the wind spirit 
coming through 
ooh  i think
i m gonna be sick 
i d hold your hair back 
but i can t find my arms 
hey  stop 
elsa 
let her go 
anna 
be careful 
that s my sister 
prince agnarr 
for arendelle 
look out 
father 
  are you okay 
  i m fine 
what are these 
oh  they look like
moments in time 
what s that thing
you say  olaf 
the thing    oh 
my theory about
advancing technologies
as both our savior
and our doom 
no  not that one 
the one about   
  the one about cucumbers 
  no 
the thing about water 
oh  yeah 
water has memory 
the water that
makes up you and me
has passed through
at least four humans   
and or animals before us 
hmm 
and remembers everything 
the wind s back 
delicious 
i think
i ll name you gale 
get out of there  whoa 
  oh  hi 
  aren t you curious 
you in a better mood now 
father 
that s father 
this girl 
she s saving him 
she s northuldra 
what is that 
olaf  get behind me 
what are you gonna
do with that 
i have no idea 
lower your weapon 
and you lower yours 
arendellian soldiers 
threatening my people 
lieutenant 
invading my dance space 
yelena 
why does that soldier
look so familiar 
no  no  no 
lieutenant 
get the sword 
that was magic 
did you see that 
of course i saw it 
you chose a nice 
cold greeting 
they ve been trapped in
here this whole time 
  yeah 
  what do we do now 
i got this 
hi  i m olaf 
oh  sorry  yeah  i just
find clothes restricting 
bet you re wondering who
we are and why we re here 
it s really quite simple 
it began with two sisters 
one born with magical powers 
one born powerless 
their love of snowmen 
infinite 
anna  no  too high 
blast 
mama  papa  help 
slam 
doors shutting everywhere 
sisters torn apart 
well  at least
they have their parents 
their parents are dead 
oh 
oh  hi  i m anna 
i ll marry a man i just met 
elsa s gonna blow 
snow  snow  aah  run 
magic pulses
through my snowflakes 
i live 
ice palace for one 
ice palace for one 
get out  anna 
pew  pew 
  my heart 
  oh  my goodness 
only an act
of true love can save you 
here s
a true love s kiss 
you re not worth it 
guess what 
i m the bad guy 
what 
and anna
freezes to death forever 
oh  anna 
then she unfreezes 
oh  and then elsa woke up
the magical spirits   
and we were forced
out of our kingdom 
now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past   
but we don t have a clue
how to do that   
except elsa s hearing voices 
so we got that going for us 
any questions 
i think they got it 
are you really
queen of arendelle 
i am 
why would nature reward
a person of arendelle
with magic 
perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people 
my people are innocent 
we would have never
attacked first 
may the truth be found 
  mm   
  hi  i m sorry 
  uh  what s happening

but we re still strong 
and proud to serve arendelle

i believe
they have the answers
that may help us
free this forest 
trust me 
i just want to help 
we only trust nature 
when nature speaks   
   we listen 
this will all
make sense when i m older

hey  let me ask you 
how do you guys cope   
with the ever increasing
complexity of thought
that comes with maturity 
brilliant 
oh 
it s so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today 
our future s
in bright hands 
oh  no  no 
don t chew that 
you don t know
what i ve stepped in 
i can t seem
to get her attention 
or even say
the right thing 
well  you re in luck 
i know nothing
about women 
but i do know
that we have
the most amazing way
of proposing 
if we start now

it involves
a lot of reindeer 
whoa

oh  wow  why didn t that
make me feel better 
what else do you miss 
my father 
he passed
long before all this 
he was a great man 
built us a good life
in arendelle 
but taught me to never take
the good for granted 
he d say   be prepared 
 just when you think
you ve found your way 
 life will throw you
onto a new path  
what do you do
when it does 
don t give up 
take it one step
at a time and   
just do
the next right thing 
yeah 
you got it 
i wanna show you
something  may i 
you know air  fire 
water  and earth 
yes 
but  look 
there s a fifth spirit   
said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature 
a fifth spirit 
some say
they heard it call out
the day the forest fell 
my father heard it 
do you think
that is who s calling me 
maybe  alas 
only ahtohallan knows 
ahtohallan 
  dive down deep
into her sound
  but not too far
or you ll be drowned  
why do lullabies
always have to have
some terrible
warning in them 
i wonder
that all the time 
earth giants 
what are they
doing down here 
shh 
hide 
they re coming 
this is why
we don t play with fire 
oh  i can t stay mad at you 
why are you so cute 
please tell me you were not
about to follow them 
what if i can settle them
like i did the wind and fire 
or what if
they can crush you
before you even
get the chance 
remember  the goal
is to find the voice   
find the truth 
and get us home 
hey  guys 
that was close 
i know 
the giants sensed me 
they may come back here 
i don t want to put anyone
at risk again 
and you re right  anna 
we ve got
to find the voice 
we re going now 
okay  we re going 
let me just   
wait  where are
kristoff and sven 
oh  yeah  i think they
took off with that ryder guy
and a bunch of reindeer 
  they left 
  mm hmm 
just left
without saying anything 
who knows
the ways of men 
am i supposed to feel
this ridiculous 
oh  yeah  definitely 
everyone ready 
ready 
uh 
i could use a rehearsal 
i love love 
wait  you talk
for them  too 
i do 
it s like you can actually
hear what they re thinking 
yeah  and then
you just say it 
and then you just say it 
okay  here she comes 
princess anna
of arendelle   
my feisty  fearless 
ginger sweet love 
will you marry me 
um   
no 
the princess left
with the queen 
what  wait 
what  what 
i wouldn t try to follow 
they re long gone 
long gone 
so  yeah 
um  we re heading west
to the lichen meadows 
you can come with us
if you want 
hey  um   
i m really sorry that   
  no  it s fine 
  yeah  yep

  yeah  yeah 
  yep 
i know the woods 
  reindeers
are better than people
  sven  why is love so hard 
  you feel what you feel
  and those feelings are real
  come on  kristoff
  let down your guard
  again  you re gone
  off on a diff rent path
than mine
  i m left behind
  wondering
if i should follow
  you had to go
  and  of course 
it s always fine
  i prob ly could catch up
with you tomorrow
  but is this what it feels
like to be growing apart 
  when did i become the one
  who s always
chasing your heart 
  now i turn around and find
  i am lost in the woods
  north is south
right is left
  when you re gone
  i m the one
who sees you home
  but now i m lost
in the woods
  and i don t know
what path you are on
  i m lost in the woods
  up till now
  the next step
was a question of how
  i never thought it was
a question of whether
  who am i
  if i m not your guy 
  where am i
if we re not together 
  forever
  now i know
you re my true north
   cause i am
lost in the woods
  up is down
day is night
  when you re not there
  oh  you re my only landmark
  so i m lost in the woods
  wondering if you still care
  but i ll wait
  for a sign
    for a sign
    that i m your path
     cause you are mine
    you are mine
  until then
    i m lost in the woods
    lost in the woods
  in the woods
lost in the woods
  i m lost in the woods
  lost in the woods
i m lost
  i m lost in the woods  
hey  olaf  um 
maybe just one of you should do it 
i agree 
she s a little pitchy 
hey  gale s back 
what 
how can it be 
what is it 
mother
and father s ship 
but this isn t
the southern sea 
no  it isn t 
why is their ship here 
how is it here 
it must have been washed in
from the dark sea 
what were they doing
in the dark sea 
i don t know 
how did the ship
get through the mist 
i thought nobody could but us 
unless nobody was on it 
there s gotta be
something here 
wait  wait 
look around 
every arendellian ship
has a compartment 
waterproof 
that s very clever 
although 
it does make me wonder
why they don t just make
the whole ship waterproof 
here 
what language is this 
i don t know 
but look 
this is mother s handwriting 
 the end of the ice age 
 the river found  but lost 
 magic s source 
elsa s source  
it s a map 
they traveled north
and planned to cross
the dark sea to   
ahtohallan 
it s real 
octa who what 
ahtohallan 
it s a magical river
said to hold all the
answers about the past 
reinforcing my  water
has memory  theory  mm 
water has memory 
elsa 
i wanna know
what happened to them 
ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic 
we keep going
for elsa 
the waves are too high 
  iduna 
  agnarr 
elsa 
hey  hey  hey 
what are you doing 
this is my fault 
they were looking
for answers about me 
you are not responsible
for their choices  elsa 
no  just their deaths 
stop  no 
yelena asked 
why would the spirits
reward arendelle
with a magical queen 
because our mother
saved our father 
she saved her enemy 
her good deed
was rewarded with you 
you are a gift 
for what 
if anyone can resolve
the past   
if anyone can save arendelle
and free this forest 
it s you 
i believe in you  elsa 
more than anyone or anything 
honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit 
a bridge between
the magic of nature and us 
a fifth spirit 
that s who s been calling
me from ahtohallan 
the answers about the
past are all there 
so we go to ahtohallan 
not  we  
  me 
  what 
the dark sea is too
dangerous for us both 
no  no 
we do this together 
remember the song 
 go too far and
you ll be drowned  
who will stop you
from going too far 
you said you believed in me 
that this is
what i was born to do 
and i don t wanna
stop you from that 
i    i don t
wanna stop you
from being whatever
you need to be 
i just don t want
you dying   
trying to be everything
for everyone else  too 
don t do this alone 
let me help you  please 
i can t lose you  elsa

but i m sensing
some rising anger

she promised me
we d do this together 
yeah  uh huh 
but what i mean is 
i m sensing rising anger in me 
wait  you re angry 
um  i    i think so 
elsa pushed me away 
too 
and didn t even
say goodbye 
and you have every right
to be very  very mad at her 
and you said some things
never change 
but since then 
everything s done nothing
but change 
i know 
but look  i m still here
holding your hand 
yeah 
that s a good point  anna 
i feel better 
you re such a good listener 
   don t shush me 
that s rude 
no  no 
oh  the giants 
they re huge 
  hang on  olaf 
  huh 
try not
to scream 
found it 
thank you 
where are we 
in a pit
with no way out 
but with a spooky 
pitch black way in 
come on 
it ll be fun 
assuming we don t
get stuck here forever 
no one ever finds us   
and you starve
and i give up 
but  bright side 
elsa s gotta be doing
a whole lot
better than we are 
okay 
oh 
whoa

of course 
glaciers are
rivers of ice 
ahtohallan is frozen 
i hear you 
and i m coming 
  every inch of me
is trembling
  but not from the cold
  something is familiar
  like a dream i can
reach but not quite hold
  i can sense you there
  like a friend
i ve always known
  i m arriving
  and it feels like
i am home
  i have always
been a fortress
  cold secrets deep inside

  are you the one i ve been
looking for all of my life 
  show yourself
  i m ready to learn
  i ve never felt so certain
  all my life i ve been torn
  but i m here for a reason
  could it be the reason
i was born 
  i have always been
so different
  normal rules did not apply

hi  i m olaf 
and i like warm hugs 
i love you  olaf 
come on 
you can do it 
    here i stand
  oh 
  in the light of day  
oh  like a chicken
with the face of a monkey 
i just wasn t looking
where i was going 
but i m great actually 
prince hans
of the southern isles 
i love you 
i need to tell you
about my past 
and where i m from 
i m listening 
iduna 
what are you reading 
your majesty 
oh  some new
danish author 
king runeard 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
grandfather 
we bring arendelle s
full guard 
but they have given us no
reason not to trust them 
the northuldra
follow magic 
which means we can
never trust them 
grandfather 
magic makes people feel too powerful 
too entitled 
it makes them think they
can defy the will of a king 
that is not
what magic does 
that s just your fear 
fear is what
can t be trusted 
you see  the dam
will weaken their lands 
so they will
have to turn to me 
  dive down
deep into her sound
  but not too far 
or you ll be drowned
they will come
in celebration 
and then  we will know
their size and strength 
as you have welcomed us 
we welcome you   
our neighbors  our friends 
king runeard  the dam isn t
strengthening our waters 
it s hurting the forest 
it s cutting off
the north   
let    let s not
discuss this here 
let s meet on the fjord 
have tea 
find a solution 
no 
anna 
hmm  which lucky tunnel
do we choose 
you see  the dam
will weaken their lands 
so they will
have to turn to me 
king runeard  the dam 
it s hurting the forest 
elsa s found it 
what is it 
the truth about the past 
that s my grandfather   
attacking
the northuldra leader   
who wields no weapon 
the dam wasn t
a gift of peace 
it was a trick 
but that goes
against everything
arendelle stands for 
it does  doesn t it 
i know how to free
the forest 
i know what we have to do
to set things right 
why do you say that
so sadly 
we have to break the dam 
but arendelle
will be flooded 
that s why everyone
was forced out 
to protect them
from what has to be done 
oh  oh 
are you okay 
i could really use
a bright side  olaf 
bright side  um   
turtles can breathe
through their butts 
  huh 
  and i see a way out 
i knew i could
count on you 
come on  olaf  elsa s probably
on her way back right now 
we can meet her and   
olaf 
what s this 
are you okay 
i m flurrying 
wait  no  that s   
that s not it 
i m flurrying away 
the magic in me is fading 
what 
i don t think elsa s okay 
i think   
she may have gone too far 
no  no 
anna 
i m sorry 
you re gonna have to do
this next part on your own 
  okay 
  wait 
come here 
  i ve got you 
  oh 
that s good 
hey  anna 
i just thought of one thing
that s permanent 
what s that 
love 
warm hugs 
i like warm hugs 
i love you 
olaf  elsa 
what do i do now 
  i ve seen dark before
  but not like this
  this is cold this
is empty this is numb
  the life i knew
is over
  the lights are out
  hello  darkness
  i m ready to succumb
  i follow you around
  i always have
  but you ve gone to a place
i cannot find
  this grief has a gravity
  it pulls me down
  but a tiny voice
  whispers in my mind
  you are lost
  hope is gone
  but you must go on
  and do the next right thing
  can there be a day
beyond this night 
  i don t know anymore
what is true
  i can t find my direction
i m all alone
  the only star
that guided me was you
  how to rise
from the floor
  when it s not you
i m rising for 
  just do
the next right thing
  take a step
  step again
  it is all that i can
  to do the next right thing
  i won t look too far ahead
  it s too much
for me to take
  but break it down
to this next breath
  this next step
  this next choice
is one that i can make 
  so i ll walk through
this night
  stumbling blindly
toward the light
  and do
the next right thing
  and with the dawn
  what comes then 
  when it s clear
that everything
  will never be
the same again 
  then i ll make the choice
  to hear that voice
  and do
  the next right thing  
wake up 
wake up 
that s it 
come and get me 
come on 
over here 
that s right 
keep coming 
keep coming 
that ll work 
this way  guys 
what 
no  no  no  no 
she s leading them to the dam 
kristoff 
i m here 
what do you need 
  to get to the dam 
  you got it 
thank you 
come on  come on 
  help me up 
  we ll meet you around 
lieutenant mattias 
your highness 
what are you doing 
the dam must fall 
it s the only way to break
the mist and free the forest 
but we ve sworn to protect
arendelle at all costs 
arendelle has no future
until we make this right 
king runeard
betrayed everyone 
how do you know that 
my sister gave her life
for the truth 
please 
before we lose
anyone else 
look out 
destroy the dam 
come on 
throw your boulders 
that s it 
  i ve got her 
  anna 
hang on 
i m sorry
i left you behind 
i was just so desperate
to protect her 
i know  i know 
it s okay 
my love is not fragile 
wow 
look at the sky 
i just didn t realize
there was so much of it 
34 years   
five months   
and 23 days 
is it really you 
anna 
i thought i d lost you 
lost me 
you saved me  again 
i did 
and  anna 
arendelle did not fall 
it didn t 
the spirits all agreed 
arendelle deserves
to stand with you 
me 
you did what was right 
for everyone 
did you find
the fifth spirit 
you are
the fifth spirit 
you re the bridge 
well  actually 
a bridge has two sides 
and mother had
two daughters

and we ll continue
to do this together

  ah ah oh oh oh
  i can hear you but i won t
  some look for trouble
while others don t
  there s a thousand reasons
i should go about my day
  and ignore your whispers
which i wish would go away
  oh oh oh
  whoa oh
  you re not a voice
  you re just a ringing
in my ear
  and if i heard you
which i don t

  everyone i ve ever loved
is here within these walls
  i m sorry  secret siren
  but i m blocking out
your calls
  i ve had my adventure

risking if i follow you   
  into the unknown
  into the unknown
  into the unknown
  ah ah oh oh oh
  ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh
  what do you want 
   cause you ve been
keeping me awake

so i make a big mistake 
  or are you someone out there

  who knows deep down
i m not where i m meant to be 
  every day s a little harder
  as i feel your power grow

  where are you going

  how do i follow you
  into the unknown
  whoo   
  where the northwind
  meets the sea
  there s a river
  full of memory
  sleep  my darling
safe and sound
  for in this river 
all is found
  all is found
  when all is lost
then all is found
  in her waters
  deep and true
  lie the answers
and a path for you
  dive down deep
into her sound
  but not too far
or you ll be drowned
  she will sing
to those who hear
  and in her song
all magic flows
  but can you brave
what you most fear 
  can you face
what the river knows 
  until the river s
finally crossed
  you ll never feel
the solid ground
  you have to get
a little lost
  on your way
  to being found
  where the northwind
  meets the sea
  there s a mother
  full of memory
  come  my darling 
homeward bound
  where all is lost
  then all is found
  all is found
  all is found  
  again you re gone
  off on a diff rent path

what it feels like
  to be growing apart 
  when did i become the one
  who s always
