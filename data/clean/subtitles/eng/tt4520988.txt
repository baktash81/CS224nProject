uhoh the princess
is trapped
in the snow goblins
evil spell
quick elsa make a prince
a fancy one
oh no the prince
is trapped too
who cares about danger
when theres love
ugh anna bleugh
kissing wont save
the forest
the lost fairies cry out
what sound
does a giraffe make
never mind
they wake
the fairy queen
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone
and they all get married
what are you playing
enchanted forest
the prince
and the princess
hmm thats like no enchanted
forest ive ever seen
youve seen
an enchanted forest
wait what
i have once
and youve never
told us this before
well i could
tell you now if you
okay now
tell us now
are you sure about this
its time they know
lets make
a big snowman later
if they can settle
and listen
far away
as north as we can go
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest
but its magic wasnt that of
goblin spells
and lost fairies
it was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all
those of air
of fire
of water
and earth
but it was also home
to the mysterious
northuldra people
were the
northuldra magical like me
no elsa
they were not magical
they just took advantage
of the forests gifts
their ways
were so different from ours
but still
they promised us friendship
in honor of that
your grandfather
king runeard
built them a mighty dam
to strengthen their waters
it was a gift of peace
thats a big gift of peace
and i was so honored
to get to go to the forest
to celebrate it
stand tall agnarr
i wasnt
at all prepared
for what the day would bring
we let down our guard
we were charmed
whoa whoa
it felt so
magical
but something went wrong
they were attacking us
get behind me
it was
a brutal battle
your grandfather
father
was lost
aah
the fighting
enraged the spirits
look out
they turned
their magic against us all
there was this voice
and someone saved me
im told the spirits
then vanished
and a powerful mist
covered the forest
locking everyone out
and that night i came home
king of arendelle
whoa papa that was epic
whoever saved you
i love them
i wish i knew
who it was
what happened to the spirits
whats in the forest now
i dont know
the mist
still stands
no one
can get in
and no one
has since come out
so were safe
yes
but the forest
could wake again
and we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring
and on that note
how about we say good night
to your father
but i still
have so many questions
save them
for another night anna
you know i dont
have that kind of patience
why did northuldra
attack us anyway
who attacks people
who give them gifts
do you think the
forest will wake again
only ahtohallan knows
octawhowhat
when i was little
my mother
would sing a song
about a special river
called ahtohallan
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past
about what we are
a part of
wow
will you sing it
for us please
okay
cuddle close
scooch in
where the northwind
meets the sea
theres a river
full of memory
sleep my darling
safe and sound
for in this river
all is found
in her waters
deep and true
lie the answers
and a path for you
dive down deep
into her sound
but not too far
or youll be drowned
yes she will sing
to those who hear
and in her song
all magic flows
but can you brave
what you most fear
can you face
what the river knows
where the northwind
meets the sea
theres a mother
full of memory
come my darling
homeward bound
when all is lost
then all is found
your majesty
oh
theyre ready
excuse me
im coming
do you hear that
what
never mind
enjoying
your new permafrost olaf
im just living
the dream anna
how i wish
this could last forever
mmm
and yet change mocks us
with her beauty
whats that
forgive me
maturity is making me poetic
tell me youre older
and thus allknowing
do you ever worry
about the notion that
nothing is permanent
uh no
really
wow i cant wait until
im ancient like you
so i dont have to worry
about important things
thats not what i mean
i dont worry because
well i have you and elsa
and kristoff and sven
and the gates
are open wide
and im not alone anymore
yes the wind blows
a little bit colder
and were all getting older
and the clouds are moving on
with every autumn breeze
peter pumpkin
just became fertilizer
and my leafs
a little sadder and wiser
thats why i rely
on certain certainties
yes some things
never change
like the feel
of your hand in mine
some things
stay the same
like how we get along
just fine
like an old stone wall
thatll never fall
some things
are always true
some things never change
like how
im holding on tight to you
the leaves
are already falling
sven it feels
like the future is calling
are you telling me tonight
youre gonna get down
on one knee
yeah but im really bad
at planning these things out
like candlelight and
pulling of rings out
maybe you should leave
all the romantic stuff to me
yeah some things
never change
like the love
that i feel for her
some things stay the same
like how reindeers
are easier
but if i commit
and i go for it
ill know
what to say and do
right
some things never change
sven the pressure
is all on you
the winds are restless
could that be why
im hearing this call
is something coming
im not sure i want
things to change at all
these days are precious
cant let them slip away
i cant freeze this moment
but i can still go out
and seize this day
oh
the wind blows
a little bit colder
and you all look
a little bit older
its time to count
our blessings
beneath an autumn sky
well always live
in a kingdom of plenty
that stands
for the good of the many
and i promise you the flag
of arendelle will always fly
our flag will always fly
our flag will always fly
our flag will always fly
some things never change
turn around
and the time has flown
some things stay the same
though the future
remains unknown
may our good luck last
may our past be past
times moving fast
its true
some things never change
and im holding
on tight to you
holding on tight to you
holding on tight to you
holding on tight to you
im holding on tight

i woke the magical spirits
at the enchanted forest
okay thats
definitely not
what i thought
you were gonna say

the one
father warned us about

because of the voice
i know it sounds crazy

my magic can feel it
i can feel it
okay
oh no what now
the trolls
kristoff we missed you

angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart
why are they still angry
what does all of this
have to do with arendelle
let me see
what i can see
the past is not
what it seems
a wrong demands to be righted
arendelle is not safe
the truth must be found
without it
i see no future
no future
when one can see
no future
all one can do
is the next right thing
the next right thing
is for me to go
to the enchanted forest
and find that voice
kristoff can i borrow
your wagon
and sven
hmm
im not very comfortable
with the idea of that
you are not going alone
anna no
i have my powers
to protect me you dont
excuse me i climbed
the north mountain
survived a frozen heart
and saved you
from my exboyfriend
and i did it
all without powers
so you know im coming
me too ill drive
ill bring the snacks
i will look
after your people
please make sure they stay
out of the kingdom
until we return
of course
lets let them know
anna i am worried
for her
we have always feared
elsas powers were too much
for this world
now we must pray
they are enough
i wont let anything
happen to her
hyah
whos into trivia
i am okay
did you know that water
has memory true fact
its disputed by many
but its true
did you know
men are six times
more likely to be
struck by lightning
did you know gorillas
burp when theyre happy
did you know we blink
four million times a day
did you know
wombats poop squares
did you know
sleeping quietly
on long journeys
prevents insanity
yeah thats not true
it is
its true
definitely true
no its the truth
well
that was unanimous
but i will look it up
when we get home
theyre both asleep
so what do you
wanna do
sven keep us steady
will ya
hmm
anna ahem
anna
mmhmm
remember
our first trip like this
when i said
youd have to be crazy
to want to marry
a man you just met
wait what crazy
you didnt say i was crazy
you think im crazy
no i did
you were
huh
not crazy
clearly
just naive
not naive just uh
new to love like i was
and when youre new
youre bound to get it wrong
so youre saying
im wrong for you
what no no
im not saying
youre wrong or crazy
kristoff stop please
good idea
i hear it
i hear the voice
you do
olaf wake up
whoa
wow
whoa what the
whoa
promise me
we do this together okay
i promise
its okay
did you know
that an enchanted forest
is a place
of transformation
i have no idea
what that means
but i cant wait to see
what its gonna do
to each one of us
hey
what is this
no pushing
stop it
whoa whoa whoa
its too fast
what was that
no no no no
and were locked in
probably should have seen
that one coming
this forest is beautiful
ooh
the dam it still stands
it was
in grand pabbies visions
but why
i dont know but its still
in good shape thank goodness
what do you mean
well if that dam broke
it would send
a tidal wave so big
it would wash away
everything on this fjord
everything
but arendelles
on this fjord
nothings gonna happen
to arendelle anna
its gonna be fine
come here
you know
under different circumstances
this would be a uh
pretty romantic place
dont you think
different circumstances
you mean
like with someone else
what no no
im saying
just in case we dont
make it out of here
wait what
you dont think were gonna
make it out of here
no no
i mean no
we will make it out of here
well technically the odds
are kind of complicated
but my point is
in case we die
you think were gonna die
no no no no
wheres elsa
we will die at some point
i swore that
i wouldnt leave her side
not in any
recent time will we die
elsa
but way far in the future
we will die
dont patronize me
elsa
there you are
you okay
im fine
okay good
wheres olaf
um
anna
elsa
sven
samantha
i dont even know
a samantha
whoa
mm
thats normal
what was that
samantha
this will all make sense
when i am older
someday i will see
that this makes sense
one day when im old and wise
ill think back and realize
that these were all
completely normal events
ill have all the answers
when im older
like why were in this
dark enchanted wood
i know in a couple years
these will seem
like childish fears
and so i know
this isnt bad its good
excuse me
growing up means adapting
puzzling out your world
and your place
when im more mature
ill feel totally secure
being watched by something
with a creepy creepy face
see that will all make
sense when i am older
so theres no need
to be terrified or tense
ill just dream about a time
when im in my aged prime
cause when youre older
absolutely everything
makes sense
this is fine
whoa
olaf
hey guys
meet the wind spirit
coming through
ooh i think
im gonna be sick
id hold your hair back
but i cant find my arms
hey stop
elsa
let her go
anna
be careful
thats my sister
prince agnarr
for arendelle
look out
father
are you okay
im fine
what are these
oh they look like
moments in time
whats that thing
you say olaf
the thing oh
my theory about
advancing technologies
as both our savior
and our doom
no not that one
the one about
the one about cucumbers
no
the thing about water
oh yeah
water has memory
the water that
makes up you and me
has passed through
at least four humans
andor animals before us
hmm
and remembers everything
the winds back
delicious
i think
ill name you gale
get out of there whoa
oh hi
arent you curious
you in a better mood now
father
thats father
this girl
shes saving him
shes northuldra
what is that
olaf get behind me

do with that
i have no idea
lower your weapon
and you lower yours
arendellian soldiers
threatening my people
lieutenant
invading my dance space
yelena
why does that soldier
look so familiar
no no no
lieutenant
get the sword
that was magic
did you see that
of course i saw it
you chose a nice
cold greeting
theyve been trapped in
here this whole time
yeah
what do we do now
i got this
hi im olaf
oh sorry yeah i just
find clothes restricting
bet youre wondering who
we are and why were here
its really quite simple
it began with two sisters
one born with magical powers
one born powerless
their love of snowmen
infinite
anna no too high
blast
mama papa help
slam
doors shutting everywhere
sisters torn apart
well at least
they have their parents
their parents are dead
oh
oh hi im anna
ill marry a man i just met
elsas gonna blow
snow snow aah run
magic pulses
through my snowflakes
i live
ice palace for one
ice palace for one
get out anna
pew pew
my heart
oh my goodness
only an act
of true love can save you
heres
a true loves kiss
youre not worth it
guess what
im the bad guy
what
and anna
freezes to death forever
oh anna
then she unfreezes
oh and then elsa woke up
the magical spirits
and we were forced
out of our kingdom
now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past
but we dont have a clue
how to do that
except elsas hearing voices
so we got that going for us
any questions
i think they got it
are you really
queen of arendelle
i am
why would nature reward
a person of arendelle
with magic
perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people
my people are innocent
we would have never
attacked first
may the truth be found
mm
hi im sorry
uh whats happening
hmm
thats it
lieutenant mattias
library second portrait
on the left
you were our fathers
official guard
agnarr
what did happen
to your parents
our parents ship went
down in the southern sea
six years ago
i see him
i see him in your faces
really
soldiers
we may be getting on in years
but were still strong
and proud to serve arendelle
wait please
someone has called me here
if i can just find them
i believe
they have the answers
that may help us
free this forest

i just want to help
we only trust nature
when nature speaks
we listen

make sense when im older

our oldest families
it was our mothers

mother saved
fathers life that day
our mother was northuldra
we are called northuldra
we are the people of the sun
i promise you i will
free this forest
and restore arendelle
thats a pretty
big promise elsa
free the forest
wow
im sorry
its just uh some of us
were born in here
weve never even seen
a clear sky
i get it
the names ryder
kristoff
i heard the voice again
we need to go north
but the earth giants now
roam the north at night
you can leave
in the morning
im honeymaren
honeymaren
well do all we can
hey let me ask you
how do you guys cope
with the everincreasing
complexity of thought
that comes with maturity
brilliant
oh
its so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today
our futures
in bright hands
oh no no
dont chew that
you dont know
what ive stepped in
i cant seem
to get her attention
or even say
the right thing
well youre in luck
i know nothing
about women
but i do know
that we have
the most amazing way
of proposing
if we start now
well be ready by dawn
really
best part
it involves
a lot of reindeer
whoa
hey
back at home
halima still over
at hudsons hearth
she is
really
she married
mmmm
oh wow why didnt that
make me feel better
what else do you miss
my father
he passed
long before all this
he was a great man
built us a good life
in arendelle
but taught me to never take
the good for granted
hed say be prepared
just when you think
youve found your way
life will throw you
onto a new path
what do you do
when it does
dont give up
take it one step
at a time and
just do
the next right thing
yeah
you got it
i wanna show you
something may i
you know air fire
water and earth
yes
but look
theres a fifth spirit
said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature
a fifth spirit
some say
they heard it call out
the day the forest fell
my father heard it
do you think
that is whos calling me
maybe alas
only ahtohallan knows
ahtohallan
dive down deep
into her sound
but not too far
or youll be drowned
why do lullabies
always have to have
some terrible
warning in them
i wonder
that all the time
earth giants
what are they
doing down here
shh
hide
theyre coming
this is why
we dont play with fire
oh i cant stay mad at you
why are you so cute
please tell me you were not
about to follow them
what if i can settle them
like i did the wind and fire
or what if
they can crush you
before you even
get the chance
remember the goal
is to find the voice
find the truth
and get us home
hey guys
that was close
i know
the giants sensed me
they may come back here
i dont want to put anyone
at risk again
and youre right anna
weve got
to find the voice
were going now
okay were going

wait where are
kristoff and sven

like to be growing apart
when did i become the one
whos always
chasing your heart
now i turn around and find
i am lost in the woods
north is south
right is left
when youre gone
im the one
who sees you home
but now im lost
in the woods
and i dont know
what path you are on
im lost in the woods
up till now
the next step
was a question of how
i never thought it was
a question of whether
who am i
if im not your guy
where am i
if were not together
forever
now i know
youre my true north
cause i am
lost in the woods
up is down
day is night
when youre not there
oh youre my only landmark
so im lost in the woods
wondering if you still care
but ill wait
for a sign
for a sign
that im your path
cause you are mine
you are mine
until then
im lost in the woods
lost in the woods
in the woods
lost in the woods
im lost in the woods
lost in the woods
im lost
im lost in the woods
hey olaf um
maybe just one of you should do it
i agree
shes a little pitchy
hey gales back
what
how can it be
what is it
mother
and fathers ship
but this isnt
the southern sea
no it isnt
why is their ship here
how is it here
it must have been washed in
from the dark sea
what were they doing
in the dark sea
i dont know
how did the ship
get through the mist
i thought nobody could but us
unless nobody was on it
theres gotta be
something here
wait wait
look around
every arendellian ship
has a compartment
waterproof
thats very clever
although
it does make me wonder
why they dont just make
the whole ship waterproof
here
what language is this
i dont know
but look
this is mothers handwriting
the end of the ice age
the river found but lost
magics source
elsas source
its a map
they traveled north
and planned to cross
the dark sea to
ahtohallan
its real
octawhowhat
ahtohallan
its a magical river
said to hold all the
answers about the past
reinforcing my water
has memory theory mm
water has memory
elsa
i wanna know
what happened to them
ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic
we keep going
for elsa
the waves are too high
iduna
agnarr
elsa
hey hey hey
what are you doing
this is my fault
they were looking
for answers about me
you are not responsible
for their choices elsa
no just their deaths
stop no
yelena asked
why would the spirits
reward arendelle
with a magical queen
because our mother
saved our father
she saved her enemy
her good deed
was rewarded with you
you are a gift
for what
if anyone can resolve
the past

come on
you can do it
here i stand
oh
in the light of day
oh like a chicken
with the face of a monkey
i just wasnt looking
where i was going
but im great actually
prince hans
of the southern isles
i love you
i need to tell you
about my past
and where im from
im listening
iduna
what are you reading
your majesty
oh some new
danish author
king runeard
im sorry i dont understand
grandfather
we bring arendelles
full guard
but they have given us no
reason not to trust them
the northuldra
follow magic
which means we can
never trust them
grandfather
magic makes people feel too powerful
too entitled
it makes them think they
can defy the will of a king
that is not
what magic does
thats just your fear
fear is what
cant be trusted
you see the dam
will weaken their lands
so they will
have to turn to me
dive down
deep into her sound
but not too far
or youll be drowned
they will come
in celebration
and then we will know
their size and strength
as you have welcomed us
we welcome you
our neighbors our friends
king runeard the dam isnt
strengthening our waters
its hurting the forest
its cutting off
the north
let lets not
discuss this here
lets meet on the fjord
have tea
find a solution
no
anna
hmm which lucky tunnel
do we choose
you see the dam
will weaken their lands
so they will
have to turn to me
king runeard the dam
its hurting the forest
elsas found it
what is it
the truth about the past
thats my grandfather
attacking
the northuldra leader
who wields no weapon
the dam wasnt
a gift of peace
it was a trick
but that goes
against everything
arendelle stands for
it does doesnt it
i know how to free
the forest
i know what we have to do
to set things right
why do you say that
so sadly
we have to break the dam
but arendelle
will be flooded
thats why everyone
was forced out
to protect them
from what has to be done
oh oh
are you okay
i could really use
a bright side olaf
bright side um
turtles can breathe
through their butts
huh
and i see a way out
i knew i could
count on you
come on olaf elsas probably
on her way back right now
we can meet her and
olaf
whats this
are you okay
im flurrying
wait no thats
thats not it
im flurrying away
the magic in me is fading
what
i dont think elsas okay
i think
she may have gone too far
no no
anna
im sorry
youre gonna have to do
this next part on your own
okay
wait
come here
ive got you
oh
thats good
hey anna
i just thought of one thing
thats permanent
whats that
love
warm hugs
i like warm hugs
i love you
olaf elsa
what do i do now
ive seen dark before
but not like this
this is cold this
is empty this is numb
the life i knew
is over
the lights are out
hello darkness
im ready to succumb
i follow you around
i always have
but youve gone to a place
i cannot find
this grief has a gravity
it pulls me down
but a tiny voice
whispers in my mind
you are lost
hope is gone
but you must go on
and do the next right thing
can there be a day
beyond this night
i dont know anymore
what is true
i cant find my direction
im all alone
the only star
that guided me was you
how to rise
from the floor
when its not you
im rising for
just do
the next right thing
take a step
step again
it is all that i can
to do the next right thing
i wont look too far ahead
its too much
for me to take
but break it down
to this next breath
this next step
this next choice
is one that i can make
so ill walk through
this night
stumbling blindly
toward the light
and do
the next right thing
and with the dawn
what comes then
when its clear
that everything
will never be
the same again
then ill make the choice
to hear that voice
and do
the next right thing
wake up
wake up
thats it
come and get me
come on
over here
thats right
keep coming
keep coming
thatll work
this way guys
what
no no no no
shes leading them to the dam
kristoff

what do you need
to get to the dam
you got it
thank you
come on come on
help me up
well meet you around
lieutenant mattias
your highness
what are you doing
the dam must fall
its the only way to break
the mist and free the forest
but weve sworn to protect
arendelle at all costs
arendelle has no future
until we make this right
king runeard
betrayed everyone
how do you know that
my sister gave her life
for the truth
please
before we lose
anyone else
look out

come on
throw your boulders
thats it
ive got her
anna

im sorry
i left you behind
i was just so desperate
to protect her
i know i know

there was so much of it
34 years
five months
and 23 days
is it really you
anna
i thought id lost you
lost me
you saved me again
i did
and anna
arendelle did not fall

the spirits all agreed
arendelle deserves
to stand with you
me
you did what was right
for everyone
did you find
the fifth spirit

and mother had
two daughters

theres a thousand reasons
i should go about my day
and ignore your whispers
which i wish would go away
oh oh oh

youre just a ringing
in my ear
and if i heard you
which i dont
im spoken for i fear
everyone ive ever loved
is here within these walls
im sorry secret siren
but im blocking out
your calls
ive had my adventure
i dont need something new
im afraid of what im
risking if i follow you
into the unknown
into the unknown
into the unknown
ah ah oh oh oh
ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh
what do you want
cause youve been
keeping me awake
are you here to distract me
so i make a big mistake
or are you someone out there
whos a little bit like me
who knows deep down
im not where im meant to be
every days a little harder
as i feel your power grow
dont you know
theres a part of me
that longs to go
into the unknown
into the unknown
into the unknown
ah ah oh oh oh
ah ah oh oh oh
whoa oh oh

where are you going
dont leave me alone
how do i follow you
into the unknown
whoo
where the northwind
meets the sea
theres a river
full of memory
sleep my darling
safe and sound
for in this river
all is found
all is found
when all is lost
then all is found
in her waters
deep and true
lie the answers
and a path for you
dive down deep
into her sound
but not too far
or youll be drowned
she will sing
to those who hear
and in her song
all magic flows
but can you brave
what you most fear
can you face
what the river knows
until the rivers
finally crossed
youll never feel
the solid ground
you have to get
a little lost
on your way
to being found
where the northwind
meets the sea
theres a mother
full of memory
come my darling
homeward bound
where all is lost
then all is found
all is found
all is found
again youre gone
off on a diffrent path
than mine
im left behind
wondering if i should follow
you had to go
and of course
its always fine
i probly could catch up
with you tomorrow
but is this
what it feels like
to be growing apart
when did i become the one
whos always
chasing your heart
now i turn around
and find
i am lost in the woods
north is south
right is left
when youre gone
im the one
who sees you home
but now im lost
in the woods
and i dont know
what path you are on
im lost in the woods
up till now
the next step
was a question of how
i never thought it was
a question of whether
who am i
if im not your guy
where am i
if were not together
forever
now i know
youre my true north
cause i am lost
in the woods
up is down
day is night
when youre not there
oh youre my only landmark
so im lost in the woods
wondering if you still care
but ill wait
for a sign
for a sign
that im your path
cause you are mine
you are mine
until then
im lost in the woods
lost in the woods
in the woods
lost in the woods
im lost in the woods
lost in the woods
im lost
im lost in the woods
show yourself right now
elsa be who you are
oh i will mama i will
elsas dead
olafs dead
anna cries
and then a bunch of important
things happen that i forgot
but all that matters is
i was right
and water has memory
and thus
i live
and so do you
