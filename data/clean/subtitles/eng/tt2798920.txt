for nearly four months
i dont remember eating
how long did you think
you were inside
days
maybe weeks
what happened to josie radek
i dont know
what about sheppard
thorensen
dead
ventress
i dont know
then what do you know
this is a cell
like all cells
it is born
from an existing cell
and by extension
all cells were ultimately
born from one cell
a single organism
alone on planet earth
perhaps alone in the universe
about four billion
years ago
one became two
two became four
then eight 16 32
the rhythm
of the dividing pair
which becomes
the structure
of every microbe
blade of grass sea creature
land creature
and human
the structure
of everything that lives
and everything that dies
as students of medicine
as the doctors of tomorrow
this is where you come in
the cell were looking at
is from a tumor
female patient
early thirties
taken from the cervix
over the course
of the next term
we will be closely examining
cancer cells in vitro
and discussing
autophagic activity
professor
hi katie
i read the john sulston
paper last night
i still feel im not working
hard enough
im behind the other students
they find everything easier
you arent
and they dont okay
lena
dan
ive been looking
for you at lunch
but you never
seem to be around
ive been catching up
on some writing
all work and no play
its
not healthy
i wanted to ask
do you have plans saturday
sarah and i have
a few people over
a garden party
while the weather holds
actually i do have plans
i think itll be a lot of fun
thanks dan
i really appreciate it
but im going
to paint our bed
the bedroom
its been a year lena
youre allowed
to come to a barbecue
it is not a betrayal
or an insult to his memory
im gonna paint the bedroom
oh god
oh my god
i thought
you were gone
forever
kane
no one knew anything
about your unit
i contacted everyone
everyone i could
the other partners knew
just as little as me
was it covert
maybe
whats that mean maybe
okay yeah it was covert
yeah i think so
pakistan again
i dont know
where it was
or what it was
how is that possible
was was it warm
was there snow
did the people there
speak portuguese
or swahili or pashto
how long have you been back
i dont know
howd you get back
what base did you fly into
i dont know
what about the rest
of your unit
did they come back with you
you must be able
to tell me something
you vanished off the face
of the earth for 12 months
i deserve a better explanation
than no explanation
does it matter
kane
how did you get home
i was outside
outside the house
no
no i was outside the room
the room with the bed
the door was open
and i saw you
i recognized you
your face
i dont feel very well
stay with me baby
im right here with you
male 31 hemorrhage
in seizure
stay with me baby
i love you
baby look at me
can you do something
you call for a police escort
easy easy
out of the truck now
out
out of the truck now
what are you doing
move out out
dont shoot
out out out
what is going on
do not move
what are you doing
you cant move him
let him go let him go
let him go
you must be feeling dreadful
its a hangover from
the sedative you were given
come on sit down
who are you
my name is dr ventress
im a psychologist
why am i talking
to a psychologist
am i in
a psychiatric hospital
no
then what
where am i
wheres my husband
you served in the military
for seven years
im a professor
from johns hopkins
i want to know what the fuck
im doing here
you r research area
is the genetically programed
life cycle of a cell
where is my husband
yeah id like to talk
about sergeant kane
when did he arrive back home
i want to see a lawyer
youre not gonna be able
to see a lawyer
did he explain
how he got back
no
did he contact you at any
point while he was away
no
what did he tell you about
his mission when he returned
nothing
what about before he left
did he ever mention
where he was going
what he was doing
he never said i never asked
but you made regular requests
for information
from his unit co
until six months ago
and then you stopped
why was that
thought he was dead
time to move on
its not easy to move on
i didnt
im done answering questions
its your turn
your husbands here
hes extremely ill
in what way
multiple organ failure
massive internal bleeding
he must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation
some kind of virus
you have to tell me
where he was
what he was doing
i could actually help him
a religious event
an extraterrestrial event
a higher dimension
we have many theories
few facts
it started around
three years ago
blackwater national park
reported that a lighthouse
was surrounded
by something they termed
a shimmer
one of the wardens
went in to investigate
never returned
the event was classified
since then weve approached
by land by sea
sent in drones animals
and teams of people
but nothing comes back
and the boundarys getting
bigger its expanding
so far its eating into
barely populated swampland
which we evacuated
under the pretext
of a chemical spill
but that wont
last much longer
in a few months
the area will have grown
to where we are right now
and then
were talking cities
states
and so on
you say nothing comes back
but something has
yes
hes dying
yes
we need to come
to an agreement
about what to do with you
youre not going
to let me go home
is that what you want
to go home
no
i want to be with him
youre not talking to me
sorry
zoned out
thinking about
the next mission
no
i was just looking
at the moon
its always so weird seeing it
like that in the daylight
like god made a mistake
left the hall lights on
god doesnt make mistakes
thats somewhat key to
the whole beingagod thing
pretty sure he does
you know hes listening
right now dont you
you take a cell
circumvent the hayflick limit
you can prevent senescence
i was about to make
the exact same point
it means the cell
doesnt grow old
it becomes immortal
keeps dividing doesnt die
we see aging
as a natural process
but its actually
a fault in our genes
i get really turned on
when you patronize me
its really hot
without it i could keep
looking like this forever
okay well that could
constitute a mistake
you didnt tell me where
youre heading this time
i know theres something
strange about this mission
why
the silence around it
is louder than usual
kind of angling
for a clue here
so
well be under
the same hemisphere
what does that tell me
it tells you that if you
step outside and you look up
well be looking
at the same stars
holy fucking shit
what
are you kidding
what
you think thats what i do
while youre away
what
you think im out
in the garden
pining looking up at the sky
shut up
oh to think
my beloved kane
all right okay
is looking
at this selfsame moon
stop it
oh my distant celestial friend
no no
please care
for my brave soldier
jesus you know what you are
disrespectful seriously
not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces
but also to the president
you forgot the flag
im getting
to the motherfucking flag
oh my hero
screw you
okay
shes all by herself
dont you think
we should make friends
well obviously you should
yep ill do it
hey
hey
am i intruding
no not at all
cool
you know
always see you here alone
im guessing
you probably feel
weird or awkward
somewhat i guess
dont seriously dont
the people here put themselves
to sleep
in the fetal position
making cooing noises
its freaky you know
im anya
lena
nice to meet you
you too
why dont you come
and meet my crew
come make friends
come on
ladies meet lena
hi nice to meet you
hi nice to meet you
yeah thats cassie sheppard
and josie radek
hi
hi nice to meet you
do you want
to have a seat
thank you
so first day
at the southern reach
yes
thank you
youre welcome
you all been here a long time
yeah right from the start
im a geomorphologist
ive been testing the magnetic
fields around the boundary
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane
and ive been here
10 months ten months
paramedic from chicago
tried to join an ngo but
my application got flagged
so southern reach got me
only two months
im a physicist
i came straight from
my cambridge postdoc
shes very smart
whats your story lena
im from johns hopkins
biologist
there you go
biologist
told you she was smart
what
we had a bet
on your profession
and josie had biologist
of course
i had law enforcement
i had you as single
jesus do you have to hit on
everyone like all the time
come on fuck that
under the circumstances
i think im allowed to roll
the dice a few more times
under what circumstances
well yeah
crazy as it seems
crazy as it is
we are headed that way
youre going into the shimmer
six days and counting
you three
four
ventress
dr ventress
team leader
all women
scientists
the previous teams have been
largely military so yeah
what do you think
happened to them
well there are two theories
of what went wrong
in the shimmer
one something kills them
two they go crazy
and kill each other
there was one military
guy who made it out
yeah
sergeant
yeah but you heard about
the state that he was in
kane
i know why you went in
i am so sorry
and i know what i have to do
so you didnt tell
them about your connection
to sergeant kane
i thought
it would complicate things
what
what would it complicate
why are you going
into the shimmer
the mission statement is to
reach the supposed source of
the shimmer the lighthouse
enter acquire data
and return
but i dont think that
thats your mission statement
no
ive been watching the
phenomenon for a while now
i profile the volunteers
i pick the teams
they enter i watch
i watch it grow closer
theres only so long
one can do that
but you need to know
whats inside
yes i do
so do i
so thats the complication
you want to come with us
i cant do anything
for him here
soldierscientist
you can fight you can learn
you can save him
you requested to join
the mission
you knew all
other missions had failed
and the only survivor
was barely surviving
that was a brave choice
lowed him
im only trying to understand
what drove you
lowed him
so i went in
and then we get
some real meals
spaghetti heres radeks
vegetable crackers
cornbread thats not so bad
youre finally awake
got to give me a second
im a little disoriented
join the club
you dont remember
setting up camp do you
i dont remember anything
after we reached
the tree line
none of us do
and we did a food inventory
from the depletion it looks
like weve been out here for
at least three or four days
thats not possible
thats what i said
guys ive been checking
my comms and nav equipment
they boot up fine no problem
with the electronics
and the camera is working
but anything that sends
a signal out of the shimmer
is down
even though weve probably
got about 20 satellites
above us right now
and check this out
so we have got
no compass no comms
no coordinates
and no landmarks
well we know
were in the state park
we head south hit the ocean
then just follow the shoreline
until we hit
the perimeter wall
right
how do we know whats south
come on josie you know this
hour hand at the sun
split the difference between
the hour hand and 12
south
good were oriented
we werent really expecting
the comms equipment to work
were we
i mean theres been
three years of expeditions
and three years
of radio silence
lets pack up and get moving
weve already lost
a lot of the day
im gonna check this out
get us out of this damn swamp
all right
lets check out the hut
looks like someones about
to have a wedding
these are very strange
why
theyre all so different
to look at them
you wouldnt say
that theyre the same species
but theyre growing from
the same branch structure
so it has to be
the same species
its the same plant
its like theyre stuck
in a continuous mutation
a pathology
yeah well
youd sure as hell
call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human
jackpot
sheppard
mode of transportation
anything interesting in there
no its been long abandoned
maybe even before
radek
radek
radek
its got my bag
radek
somethings got my bag
its got my bag
josie whats happening
whats going on
grab my shoulder
get her come on
i got her
youre good youre good
okay
lets sit you down
help me with her bag
okay just breathe
its okay youre just fine
what the hell happened
something in the water
get up get up go
shit get back
sheppard
sheppard watch out
holy fuck
its exactly the same
as the flowers
look at the teeth
concentric rows
something here is making giant
waves in the gene pool
sharks have teeth like that
dont they
do you think
its a crossbreed
you cant crossbreed
between different species
lena this is getting heavy
the mutations
were subtle at first
more extreme as we grew
closer to the lighthouse
corruptions of form
duplicates of form
duplicates
echoes
is it possible
these were hallucinations
i wondered that myself
but they were shared
among all of us
it was dreamlike
nightmarish
not always
sometimes it was beautiful
you hurt
its just a bruise
must have gotten that
from the gator
yeah
so whered you learn
to shoot
i was in the military
before i was an academic
marines
army seven years
feels like a lifetime ago now
yeah
all other lives
feel like a lifetime ago
we were kids
i was married
which do you carry
around your neck
a husband or a child
husband
he was in the army too
thats thats how we met
was in the army he quit
kla
im sorry to hear that
guess there had
to be something
what do you mean
volunteering for this
its not exactly something
you do if your life is in
perfect harmony
were all damaged goods here
anya is sober
therefore an addict
and josie wears long sleeves
because she doesnt
want you to see
the scars on her forearms
shes tried to kill herself
no i think the opposite
trying to feel alive
ventress
yeah as far
as anyone knows
no friends no family
no partner no children
no concession in her at all
you
i also lost someone
not a husband though
a daughter leukemia
god im sorry
in a way
its two bereavements
my beautiful girl
and the person i once was
hey hey
we got something here
this used to be
the headquarters
of the southern reach
before the shimmer
swallowed it
more mutations
theyre everywhere
malignant
like tumors
is that the old mess hall
yeah
lets billet there come on
theres beds and bags
you think people are here
were here
yeah im gonna go
with the past tense
damn
shit
this shit is heavy
cant carry this
lena what you got going on
guys check this out
peyton mayer
kane shelley
those were the soldiers
on the last expedition
looks like they
were using this room
as their base of operations
why are some of the names
crossed out
lets not jump to conclusions
i dont know maybe we should
yeah
this is a planview
of the base right
yep this is the mess hall
thats the building were in
yep
i think that the times
by the names
are a guard rota
so if they were guarding the
perimeter we should too
copy that
yep
this might be able
to tell us something
for those that follow
i believe that means us
memory card
i should be able to play this
its working
all right
okay
okay_
okay
okay okay okay
okay
ready okay
shit
what is he doing
no stop stop
stop stop stop
hold him hold him down
there there
okay so we know what happened
to the last group
they went insane
there was something
alive inside that man
no that was a trick
of the light
what
ive been a paramedic
for 10 years all right
ive scraped people
off the side of the road
you see some weird shit
that was a trick of the light
his insides were moving
no it was shock radek
that was a shock response
watch it again
no im not gonna
fucking watch it again
that was not intestines
it was like a worm
okay then you
watch it sheppard
where are you going
whered she go
just ahead
what is it
i dont know
i dont want
to stay here tonight
we dont have a choice
please
come on
its too late in the day
for us to move on
come on lets go outside
thats nice of you
why arent you here
i got to leave a day early
what
wait today
right now
shit
but we had
a whole day planned
we were gonna drive
to the country
we cant
can you at least
now means right now
yeah
what is it
i do
love you
lena
i love you too
hey
the mystery unraveling
somethings unraveling
i think youre doing okay
look josies
getting some rest
yeah
with the help
of a little sedative
how about you get some sleep
some
im at least
as freaked as josie
im just hiding it better
i should check on ventress
yep
what are you doing up
youre not supposed
to relieve me until 300
im done sleeping
for the night
okay
come look at this
okay this is where we are
and thats the lighthouse
southwest is ville perdu
its a small community
we evacuated two years ago
i think we should
head there tomorrow
and then head out
for the coast
the following morning
good
you okay
i was gonna say when
you didnt tell the team
about your connection to kane
i wasnt sure
if that was a good idea
but after seeing
that footage
yeah
im not sure how they would
have reacted to you
why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission
is that what you think
were doing
committing suicide
you must have profiled him
you must have assessed him
he must have said something
so youre asking me
as a psychologist
yeah
then as a psychologist
id say youre confusing
suicide with selfdestruction
almost none of us
commit suicide
and almost all of us
selfdestruct
in some way
in some part of our lives
we drink or we smoke
we destabilize the good job
or the happy marriage
but these arent decisions
theyre
theyre impulses
in fact
youre probably
better equipped
to explain this than i am
what does that mean
youre a biologist
isnt selfdestruction
coded into us
programed into each cell
what was that
dont know
josie wake up
wake up josie come on
wake up
somethings happening
do you see anything
no
what happened
i heard a noise
what
somethings come through
the fence
through the fence
its ripped open
like a fucking zipper
i cant see anything
yeah neither can i
sheppard
sheppard
fuck
whats going on
sheppard was just next to me
and something took her
fuck fuck
sheppard
shit
help me
help me
sheppard
sheppard
we have to go back
we have to go back now
shes right
right
in what sense
weve been
attacked twice
we lost one of our own
we have evidence
the previous team
went nuts and chopped
each other up
i really dont know how much
more right she has to be
we havent reached
the lighthouse
we still dont
understand the cause
or the nature of the shimmer
we have data
observations photographs
she has hella footage
all of which
makes the phenomenon
less explicable not more
im gonna
get to the lighthouse
and im fine going on my own
you just need to decide
whether youre coming
with me or not
its like she doesnt even
notice that sheppard is dead
shes crazy
shes a crazy old bitch
and thanks for
the fucking backup lena
i didnt realize
there were sides
yeah
yeah there are sides
okay then i agree with you
we should go back
good okay great
there we go
okay so the three of us
can just pack up our
hold on a minute
hold on
we should go back yes
but it took us what
six days to get here
and the coast
is two days away
and as sheppard said
when we get to the coast
we can just follow it until
we hit the perimeter wall
youre saying that we get out
by going deeper in
yeah if you like yeah
like
no i dont fucking like
this isnt
some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse
is it
this is not about
the lighthouse okay
i believe that the coast
is the best route out
okay
you lied to them
i didnt know
what going back meant
why it would be safer
than going forward
you didnt know
but you made the decision
to continue as if you did
ventress made the decision
ventress had cancer
she was never coming back
you knew she was sick
i had guessed
and you wanted to continue
yes
i did
she could still be alive
its highly doubtful
we need to know
go
fine
im coming with you
ill go alone
did you find her
yeah
shes dead
you okay
fine
just leave me the fuck alone
well camp here tonight
its another two hours walk
up the coast
theyve grown this way
that doesnt make any sense
i think it does
at first i thought
the radio waves
were blocked by the shimmer
and thats why no one
inside could communicate
with base or gps
but the light waves
arent blocked
theyre refracted and
its the same with the radios
signals arent gone
theyre scrambled
that leaf in your hand
do you know what youd get
if you sequenced it
what
human hox genes
hox what does hox mean
theyre the genes
that define the body plan
the physical structure
and the plants
have human body plan
arms attached to shoulders
legs to hips
its literally not possible
its literally
whats happening
the shimmer is a prism
but it refracts everything
not just light
and radio waves
animal dna plant dna
all dna
what do you mean all dna
shes talking about our dna
shes talking about us
all right
i guess this is the bedroom
lets secure doors
and windows
this was a mistake
okay
you spend more time away from
your husband than with him
you cant talk to him
about work
and he wont talk
to you about his
and there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection
between us
have i covered the bases
you forgot to mention
your wife
i love my wife
shes blameless in this
come on lena
whats really going on here
you think that something
may have happened to him
or you think he knows
thats it isnt it
you think somehow hes found
out about our affair
has he found out
yes
you should go
no lena i
dan
im not interested in talking
or anything you have to say
just get dressed and get out
you know
its not me you hate
its yourself
no dan its you too
its never gonna happen again
you lying bitch
whats going on
no
you dont get to ask
that fucking question
you answer it
brother
boyfriend
husband
husband
why didnt you tell us
you knew
obviously
did you know
okay
so there are two theories
of what went wrong
in the shimmer
one is that something in here
killed them two
is that they went crazy
and they killed each other
josie nearly got killed
by an alligator
and cass did get killed
by a bear
so yes theory one it fits
but
i didnt actually see a bear
and neither did josie
the only people who saw a bear
were lena and ventress
so nothings confirmed
everythings on their word
everythings on lenas word
and what we know now
what we know
is that lena is a liar
shut the fuck up
lena youre a liar
did you kill cass
did you lose your shit
or do you think
that ive lost my shit
and now were just gonna
fuck each other up
thats theory two
when i look at my hands
and my fingerprints
i can see them moving
if i let you go
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints
but im not the one
tied to a chair
you are
help me
help me
help me
cass
you said she was dead
cass cass im coming
cass is that you
help me
help me
help
dont react
me
help
me
help me
what are you doing
im leaving
now
its not even light yet
i dont have time to wait
we are disintegrating
our bodies as fast as
our minds cant you feel it
its like the onset
of dementia
if i dont reach
the lighthouse soon
the person
that started this journey
wont be the person
that ends it
i want to be the one
that ends it
we should go josie
how long was your husband
in the shimmer
its hard to say exactly
theoretically
as long as a year
thats a long time to be
inside and remain intact
im not so sure he was intact
im right
about the refractions
arent i
yeah
i checked my blood last night
its in me
it will be in all of us
it was so strange hearing
sheppards voice
in the mouth
of that creature last night
i think as she was dying
part of her mind became
part of the creature
that was killing her
imagine dying frightened
and in pain
and having that as the only
part of you which survives
i wouldnt like that at all
ventress wants to face it
you want to fight it
but i dont think i want
either of those things
josie
josie
josie
one by one all gone
except you
how do you explain that
is it something
i need to explain
yes you do
i had to come back
im not sure any of them did
hey
hey
i thought i was a man
i had a life
people called me kane
and now im not so sure
if i wasnt kane what was i
was i you
were you me
my flesh moves like liquid
my mind is
just cut loose
i cant bear it
i cant bear it
i cant bear it
you ever seen
a phosphorus grenade go off
theyre kinda bright
shield your eyes
if you ever get out of here
you find lena
i will
no
five four three two
its the last phase
vanished into havoc
unfathomable mind
and now beacon
now sea
dr ventress
lena
we spoke
what was it we said
that i needed to know
what was inside
the lighthouse
that moments passed
its inside me now
whats inside you
its not like us
its unlike us
i dont know what it wants
or if it wants
but it will grow
until it encompasses
everything
our bodies and our minds
will be fragmented
into their smallest parts
until not one part remains
annihilation
so it was alien
can you describe its form
no
was it carbonbased or
i dont know
what did it want
i dont think
it wanted anything
but it it attacked you
it mirrored me
i attacked it
im not sure it even knew
i was there
it came here for a reason
it was mutating
our environment
it was destroying everything
it wasnt destroying
it was changing everything
it was making something new
making what
i dont know
a team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago
everything is ash
if what you encountered
was once alive
it seems its now dead
now will you tell me
what happened to my husband
when the shimmer disappeared
his blood pressure stabilized
and his pulse rate
started to rise
a few hours later
he was not only awake
he was lucid
hes still in isolation
obviously
