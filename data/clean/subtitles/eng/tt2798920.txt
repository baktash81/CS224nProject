for nearly four months 
i don t remember eating 
how long did you think
you were inside 
days 
maybe weeks 
what happened to josie radek 
  i don t know 
  what about sheppard 
thorensen 
dead 
ventress 
i don t know 
then what do you know 
this is a cell 
like all cells 
it is born
from an existing cell 
and by extension 
all cells were ultimately
born from one cell 
a single organism
alone on planet earth 
perhaps alone in the universe 
about four billion
years ago
one became two 
two became four 
then eight  16  32 
the rhythm
of the dividing pair 
which becomes
the structure
of every microbe 
blade of grass  sea creature 
land creature 
and human 
the structure
of everything that lives
and everything that dies 
as students of medicine 
as the doctors of tomorrow 
this is where you come in 
the cell we re looking at
is from a tumor 
female patient 
early thirties 
taken from the cervix 
over the course
of the next term 
we will be closely examining
cancer cells in vitro
and discussing
autophagic activity 
professor 
hi  katie 
i read the john sulston
paper last night 
i still feel i m not working
hard enough 
i m behind the other students 
they find everything easier 
you aren t 
and they don t  okay 
lena 
dan 
i ve been looking
for you at lunch 
but you never
seem to be around 
i ve been catching up
on some writing 
all work and no play 
it s   
not healthy 
i wanted to ask 
do you have plans saturday 
sarah and i have
a few people over 
a garden party
while the weather holds 
actually  i do have plans 
i think it ll be a lot of fun 
thanks  dan 
i really appreciate it 
but i m going
to paint our bed   
the bedroom 
it s been a year  lena 
you re allowed
to come to a barbecue 
it is not a betrayal
or an insult to his memory 
i m gonna paint the bedroom 
oh  god 
oh  my god 
i thought
you were gone
forever 
kane 
no one knew anything
about your unit 
i contacted everyone 
everyone i could 
the other partners knew
just as little as me 
was it covert 
maybe 
what s that mean   maybe  
okay  yeah  it was covert 
yeah  i think so 
pakistan again 
i don t know
where it was 
or what it was 
how is that possible 
was    was it warm 
was there snow 
did the people there
speak portuguese 
or swahili  or pashto 
how long have you been back 
i don t know 
how d you get back 
what base did you fly into 
i don t know 
what about the rest
of your unit 
did they come back with you 
you must be able
to tell me something 
you vanished off the face
of the earth for 12 months 
i deserve a better explanation
than no explanation 
does it matter 
kane 
how did you get home 
i was outside 
outside the house 
no 
no  i was outside the room 
the room with the bed 
the door was open 
and i saw you 
i recognized you 
your face 
i don t feel very well 
stay with me  baby 
i m right here with you 
male  31  hemorrhage 
in seizure 
stay with me  baby 
i love you 
baby  look at me 
can you do something 
you call for a police escort 
easy  easy 
  out of the truck now 
  out 
  out of the truck now 
  what are you doing 
  move  out  out 
  don t shoot 
  out  out  out 
  what is going on 
  do not move 
  what are you doing 
you can t move him 
let him go  let him go 
let him go 
you must be feeling dreadful 
it s a hangover from
the sedative you were given 
come on  sit down 
who are you 
my name is dr  ventress 
i m a psychologist 
why am i talking
to a psychologist 
am i in
a psychiatric hospital 
  no 
  then what 
where am i 
where s my husband 
you served in the military
for seven years 
i m a professor
from johns hopkins 
i want to know what the fuck
i m doing here 
you r research area
is the genetically programed
life cycle of a cell 
where is my husband 
yeah  i d like to talk
about sergeant kane 
when did he arrive back home 
i want to see a lawyer 
you re not gonna be able
to see a lawyer 
did he explain
how he got back 
no 
did he contact you at any
point while he was away 
no 
what did he tell you about
his mission when he returned 
nothing 
what about before he left 
did he ever mention
where he was going 
what he was doing 
he never said  i never asked 
but you made regular requests
for information
from his unit co
until six months ago 
and then you stopped 
why was that 
thought he was dead 
time to move on 
it s not easy to move on 
i didn t 
i m done answering questions 
it s your turn 
your husband s here 
he s extremely ill 
  in what way 
  multiple organ failure 
massive internal bleeding 
he must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation 
some kind of virus 
you have to tell me
where he was 
what he was doing 
i could actually help him 
a religious event 
an extraterrestrial event 
a higher dimension 
we have many theories 
few facts 
it started around
three years ago 
blackwater national park
reported that a lighthouse
was surrounded
by something they termed
a  shimmer  
one of the wardens
went in to investigate 
never returned 
the event was classified 
since then  we ve approached
by land  by sea 
sent in drones  animals 
and teams of people 
but nothing comes back 
and the boundary s getting
bigger  it s expanding 
so far  it s eating into
barely populated swampland 
which we evacuated
under the pretext
of a chemical spill 
but that won t
last much longer 
in a few months 
the area will have grown
to where we are right now 
and then
we re talking cities 
states 
and so on 
you say nothing comes back 
but something has 
yes 
he s dying 
yes 
we need to come
to an agreement
about what to do with you 
you re not going
to let me go home 
is that what you want 
to go home 
no 
i want to be with him 
you re not talking to me 
sorry 
zoned out 
thinking about
the next mission 
no 
i was just looking
at the moon 
it s always so weird seeing it
like that in the daylight 
like god made a mistake 
left the hall lights on 
god doesn t make mistakes 
that s somewhat key to
the whole being a god thing 
pretty sure he does 
you know he s listening
right now  don t you 
you take a cell 
circumvent the hayflick limit 
you can prevent senescence 
i was about to make
the exact same point 
it means the cell
doesn t grow old 
it becomes immortal 
keeps dividing  doesn t die 
we see aging
as a natural process 
but it s actually
a fault in our genes 
i get really turned on
when you patronize me 
it s really hot 
without it  i could keep
looking like this forever 
okay  well  that could
constitute a mistake 
you didn t tell me where
you re heading this time 
i know there s something
strange about this mission 
why 
the silence around it
is louder than usual 
kind of angling
for a clue here 
so   
we ll be under
the same hemisphere 
what does that tell me 
it tells you that if you
step outside and you look up 
we ll be looking
at the same stars 
holy fucking shit 
  what 
  are you kidding 
what 
you think that s what i do
while you re away 
what 
you think i m out
in the garden 
pining  looking up at the sky 
shut up 
oh  to think
my beloved kane   
all right  okay 
   is looking
at this selfsame moon 
stop it 
oh  my distant celestial friend   
no  no 
please care
for my brave soldier 
jesus  you know what  you are
disrespectful  seriously 
not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces 
but also to the president 
you forgot the flag 
i m getting
to the motherfucking flag 
oh  my hero 
  screw you 
  okay 
she s all by herself 
don t you think
we should make friends 
well  obviously you should 
yep  i ll do it 
hey 
hey 
  am i intruding 
  no  not at all 
cool 
you know 
always see you here alone 
i m guessing
you probably feel
weird or awkward 
somewhat  i guess 
don t  seriously  don t 
the people here put themselves
to sleep
in the fetal position 
making cooing noises 
it s freaky  you know 
i m anya 
lena 
  nice to meet you 
  you  too 
why don t you come
and meet my crew 
come make friends 
come on 
ladies  meet lena 
  hi  nice to meet you 
  hi  nice to meet you 
yeah  that s cassie sheppard
and josie radek 
  hi 
  hi  nice to meet you 
do you want
to have a seat 
thank you 
so  first day
at the southern reach 
yes 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
you all been here a long time 
yeah  right from the start 
i m a geomorphologist 
i ve been testing the magnetic
fields around the boundary 
which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane 
and i ve been here
10 months  ten months 
paramedic from chicago 
tried to join an ngo  but
my application got flagged 
so southern reach got me 
only two months 
i m a physicist 
i came straight from
my cambridge post doc 
she s very smart 
what s your story  lena 
i m from johns hopkins 
biologist 
  there you go 
  biologist 
  told you she was smart 
  what 
we had a bet
on your profession 
and josie had  biologist  
of course 
  i had  law enforcement  
  i had you as single 
jesus  do you have to hit on
everyone  like all the time 
come on  fuck that 
under the circumstances 
i think i m allowed to roll
the dice a few more times 
under what circumstances 
well  yeah 
crazy as it seems   
crazy as it is 
we are headed that way 
you re going into the shimmer 
six days and counting 
  you three 
  four 
ventress 
dr  ventress 
team leader 
  all women 
  scientists 
the previous teams have been
largely military  so yeah 
what do you think
happened to them 
well  there are two theories
of what went wrong
in the shimmer 
one  something kills them 
two  they go crazy
and kill each other 
there was one military
guy who made it out 
yeah 
sergeant 
yeah  but you heard about
the state that he was in 
kane 
i know why you went in 
i am so sorry 
and i know what i have to do 
so  you didn t tell
them about your connection
to sergeant kane 
i thought
it would complicate things 
what 
what would it complicate 
why are you going
into the shimmer 
the mission statement is to
reach the supposed source of
the shimmer  the lighthouse 
enter  acquire data 
and return 
but i don t think that
that s your mission statement 
no 
i ve been watching the
phenomenon for a while now 
i profile the volunteers 
i pick the teams 
they enter  i watch 
i watch it grow closer 
there s only so long
one can do that 
but you need to know
what s inside 
yes  i do 
so do i 
so that s the complication 
you want to come with us 
i can t do anything
for him here 
soldier scientist 
you can fight  you can learn 
you can save him 
you requested to join
the mission 
you knew all
other missions had failed 
and the only survivor
was barely surviving 
that was a brave choice 
lowed him 
i m only trying to understand
what drove you 
lowed him 
so i went in 
and then we get
some real meals 
spaghetti  here s radek s
vegetable crackers 
cornbread  that s not so bad 
you re finally awake 
got to give me a second 
i m a little disoriented 
join the club 
you don t remember
setting up camp  do you 
i don t remember anything
after we reached
the tree line 
none of us do 
and we did a food inventory 
from the depletion  it looks
like we ve been out here for
at least three or four days 
that s not possible 
that s what i said 
guys  i ve been checking
my comms and nav equipment 
they boot up fine  no problem
with the electronics 
and the camera is working 
but anything that sends
a signal out of the shimmer
is down 
even though we ve probably
got about 20 satellites
above us right now 
and check this out 
so we have got
no compass  no comms 
no coordinates 
and no landmarks 
well  we know
we re in the state park 
we head south  hit the ocean 
then just follow the shoreline
until we hit
the perimeter wall 
right 
how do we know what s south 
come on  josie  you know this 
hour hand at the sun 
split the difference between
the hour hand and 12 
south 
good  we re oriented 
we weren t really expecting
the comms equipment to work 
were we 
i mean  there s been
three years of expeditions
and three years
of radio silence 
let s pack up and get moving 
we ve already lost
a lot of the day 
i m gonna check this out 
get us out of this damn swamp 
all right 
let s check out the hut 
looks like someone s about
to have a wedding 
these are very strange 
why 
they re all so different 
to look at them 
you wouldn t say
that they re the same species 
but they re growing from
the same branch structure 
so it has to be
the same species 
it s the same plant 
it s like they re stuck
in a continuous mutation 
a pathology 
yeah  well 
you d sure as hell
call it a pathology
if you saw this in a human 
jackpot
sheppard 
mode of transportation 
anything interesting in there 
no  it s been long abandoned 
maybe even before   
radek 
radek 
  radek 
  it s got my bag 
radek 
something s got my bag 
it s got my bag 
  josie  what s happening 
  what s going on 
grab my shoulder 
get her  come on 
i got her 
you re good  you re good 
okay 
let s sit you down 
help me with her bag 
okay  just breathe 
it s okay  you re just fine 
  what the hell happened 
  something in the water 
get up  get up  go 
shit  get back 
sheppard 
sheppard  watch out 
holy fuck 
it s exactly the same
as the flowers 
look at the teeth 
concentric rows 
something here is making giant
waves in the gene pool 
sharks have teeth like that 
don t they 
do you think
it s a crossbreed 
you can t crossbreed
between different species 
lena  this is getting heavy 
the mutations
were subtle at first 
more extreme as we grew
closer to the lighthouse 
corruptions of form 
duplicates of form 
duplicates 
echoes 
is it possible
these were hallucinations 
i wondered that myself 
but they were shared
among all of us 
it was dreamlike 
nightmarish 
not always 
sometimes it was beautiful 
you hurt 
it s just a bruise 
must have gotten that
from the gator 
yeah 
so  where d you learn
to shoot 
i was in the military
before i was an academic 
marines 
army  seven years 
feels like a lifetime ago now 
yeah 
all other lives
feel like a lifetime ago 
we were kids 
i was married 
which do you carry
around your neck 
a husband or a child 
husband 
he was in the army  too 
that s    that s how we met 
 was  in the army  he quit 
k l a 
i m sorry to hear that 
guess there had
to be something 
what do you mean 
volunteering for this 
it s not exactly something
you do if your life is in
perfect harmony 
we re all damaged goods here 
anya is sober 
therefore an addict 
and josie wears long sleeves
because she doesn t
want you to see
the scars on her forearms 
she s tried to kill herself 
no  i think the opposite 
trying to feel alive 
ventress 
yeah  as far
as anyone knows 
no friends  no family 
no partner  no children 
no concession in her at all 
you  
i also lost someone 
not a husband  though 
a daughter  leukemia 
god  i m sorry 
in a way 
it s two bereavements 
my beautiful girl
and the person i once was 
hey  hey 
we got something here 
this used to be
the headquarters
of the southern reach
before the shimmer
swallowed it 
more mutations 
they re everywhere 
malignant 
like tumors 
is that the old mess hall 
yeah 
let s billet there  come on 
there s beds and bags 
you think people are here 
were here 
yeah  i m gonna go
with the past tense 
damn 
shit 
this shit is heavy 
can t carry this 
lena  what you got going on 
guys  check this out 
peyton  mayer 
kane  shelley 
those were the soldiers
on the last expedition 
looks like they
were using this room
as their base of operations 
why are some of the names
crossed out 
let s not jump to conclusions 
i don t know  maybe we should 
yeah 
this is a plan view
of the base  right 
yep  this is the mess hall 
  that s the building we re in 
  yep 
i think that the times
by the names
are a guard rota 
so if they were guarding the
perimeter  we should  too 
  copy that 
  yep 
this might be able
to tell us something 
 for those that follow  
i believe that means us 
memory card 
i should be able to play this 
it s working 
all right 
  okay 
  okay
okay 
  okay  okay  okay 
  okay 
ready  okay 
shit 
what is he doing 
no  stop  stop 
stop  stop  stop 
hold him  hold him down 
there  there 
okay  so we know what happened
to the last group 
they went insane 
there was something
alive inside that man 
no  that was a trick
of the light 
what 
i ve been a paramedic
for 10 years  all right 
i ve scraped people
off the side of the road 
you see some weird shit 
that was a trick of the light 
his insides were moving 
no  it was shock  radek 
that was a shock response 
watch it again 
no  i m not gonna
fucking watch it again 
that was not intestines 
it was like a worm 
okay  then you
watch it  sheppard 
where are you going 
  where d she go 
  just ahead 
what is it 
i don t know 
i don t want
to stay here tonight 
we don t have a choice 
  please 
  come on 
it s too late in the day
for us to move on 
come on  let s go outside 
that s nice of you 
why aren t you here 
i got to leave a day early 
what 
wait  today 
  right now 
  shit 
but we had
a whole day planned 
we were gonna drive
to the country 
  we can t 
  can you at least   
 now  means right now 
yeah 
what is it 
i do
love you 
lena 
i love you  too 
hey 
the mystery unraveling 
something s unraveling 
i think you re doing okay 
look  josie s
getting some rest 
yeah 
with the help
of a little sedative 
how about you  get some sleep 
some 
i m at least
as freaked as josie 
i m just hiding it better 
i should check on ventress 
yep 
what are you doing up 
you re not supposed
to relieve me until 3 00 
i m done sleeping
for the night 
okay 
come look at this 
okay  this is where we are 
and that s the lighthouse 
southwest is ville perdu 
it s a small community
we evacuated two years ago 
i think we should
head there tomorrow 
and then head out
for the coast
the following morning 
good 
you okay 
i was gonna say  when
you didn t tell the team
about your connection to kane 
i wasn t sure
if that was a good idea 
but after seeing
that footage 
yeah   
i m not sure how they would
have reacted to you 
why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission 
is that what you think
we re doing 
committing suicide 
you must have profiled him 
you must have assessed him 
he must have said something 
so you re asking me
as a psychologist 
yeah 
then as a psychologist 
i d say you re confusing
suicide with self destruction 
almost none of us
commit suicide
and almost all of us
self destruct 
in some way 
in some part of our lives 
we drink  or we smoke 
we destabilize the good job
or the happy marriage 
but these aren t decisions 
they re   
they re impulses 
in fact 
you re probably
better equipped
 to explain this than i am 
  what does that mean 
you re a biologist 
isn t self destruction
coded into us 
programed into each cell 
what was that 
don t know 
josie  wake up 
wake up  josie  come on 
wake up 
something s happening 
  do you see anything 
  no 
what happened 
i heard a noise 
what 
something s come through
the fence 
through the fence 
it s ripped open
like a fucking zipper 
  i can t see anything 
  yeah  neither can i 
sheppard 
sheppard 
  fuck 
  what s going on 
sheppard was just next to me 
and something took her 
fuck  fuck 
  sheppard 
  shit 
help me 
help me 
sheppard 
sheppard 
we have to go back 
we have to go back now 
she s right 
right 
in what sense 
we ve been
attacked twice 
we lost one of our own 
we have evidence
the previous team
went nuts and chopped
each other up 
i really don t know how much
more right she has to be 
we haven t reached
the lighthouse 
we still don t
understand the cause
or the nature of the shimmer 
we have data 
observations  photographs 
she has hella footage 
all of which
makes the phenomenon
less explicable  not more 
i m gonna
get to the lighthouse 
and i m fine going on my own 
you just need to decide
whether you re coming
with me or not 
it s like she doesn t even
notice that sheppard is dead 
she s crazy 
she s a crazy old bitch 
and thanks for
the fucking backup  lena 
i didn t realize
there were sides 
yeah 
yeah  there are sides 
okay  then i agree with you 
we should go back 
good  okay  great 
there we go 
okay  so the three of us
 can just pack up our   
  hold on a minute 
hold on 
we should go back  yes 
but it took us  what 
six days to get here 
and the coast
is two days away 
and as sheppard said 
when we get to the coast 
we can just follow it until
we hit the perimeter wall 
you re saying that we get out
by going deeper in 
yeah  if you like  yeah 
 like  
no  i don t fucking  like  
this isn t
some bullshit tactic
to get us to the lighthouse 
is it 
this is not about
the lighthouse  okay 
i believe that the coast
is the best route out 
okay 
you lied to them 
i didn t know
what going back meant 
why it would be safer
than going forward 
you didn t know 
but you made the decision
to continue as if you did 
ventress made the decision 
ventress had cancer 
she was never coming back 
you knew she was sick 
i had guessed 
and you wanted to continue 
yes 
i did 
she could still be alive 
it s highly doubtful 
we need to know 
go 
fine 
i m coming with you 
i ll go alone 
did you find her 
yeah 
she s dead 
you okay 
fine 
just leave me the fuck alone 
we ll camp here tonight 
it s another two hours  walk
up the coast 
they ve grown this way 
that doesn t make any sense 
i think it does 
at first  i thought
the radio waves
were blocked by the shimmer 
and that s why no one
inside could communicate
with base or gps 
but the light waves
aren t blocked 
they re refracted  and   
it s the same with the radios 
signals aren t gone 
they re scrambled 
that leaf in your hand 
do you know what you d get
if you sequenced it 
what 
  human hox genes 
  hox   what does  hox  mean 
they re the genes
that define the body plan 
the physical structure 
and the plants
have human body plan 
arms attached to shoulders 
legs to hips 
it s literally not possible 
it s literally
what s happening 
the shimmer is a prism 
but it refracts everything 
not just light
and radio waves 
animal dna  plant dna 
all dna 
what do you mean  all dna 
she s talking about our dna 
she s talking about us 
all right 
i guess this is the bedroom 
let s secure doors
and windows 
this was a mistake 
okay 
you spend more time away from
your husband than with him 
you can t talk to him
about work 
and he won t talk
to you about his 
and there is a clear physical
and intellectual connection
between us 
have i covered the bases 
you forgot to mention
your wife 
i love my wife 
she s blameless in this 
come on  lena 
what s really going on here 
you think that something
may have happened to him 
or you think he knows 
that s it  isn t it 
you think somehow he s found
out about our affair 
has he found out 
yes 
you should go 
  no  lena  i   
  dan 
i m not interested in talking 
or anything you have to say 
just get dressed and get out 
you know 
it s not me you hate 
it s yourself 
no  dan  it s you  too 
it s never gonna happen again 
you lying bitch 
  what s going on 
  no 
you don t get to ask
that fucking question 
you answer it 
brother 
boyfriend 
husband 
husband 
why didn t you tell us 
you knew 
obviously 
did you know 
okay 
so  there are two theories
of what went wrong
in the shimmer 
one is that something in here
killed them  two
is that they went crazy
and they killed each other 
josie nearly got killed
by an alligator 
and cass did get killed
by a bear 
so  yes  theory one  it fits 
but
i didn t actually see a bear 
and neither did josie 
the only people who saw a bear
were lena and ventress 
so nothing s confirmed 
everything s on their word 
everything s on lena s word 
and what we know now   
what we know
is that lena is a liar 
shut the fuck up 
lena  you re a liar 
did you kill cass 
did you lose your shit 
or do you think
that i ve lost my shit 
and now we re just gonna
fuck each other up 
that s theory two 
when i look at my hands
and my fingerprints 
i can see them moving 
if i let you go
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open 
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints 
but i m not the one
tied to a chair 
you are 
help me 
help me 
help me 
cass 
you said she was dead 
cass  cass  i m coming 
cass  is that you 
help me 
help me 
help   
don t react 
   me 
help   
   me 
help me 
what are you doing 
  i m leaving 
  now 
  it s not even light yet 
  i don t have time to wait 
we are disintegrating 
our bodies as fast as
our minds  can t you feel it 
it s like the onset
of dementia 
if i don t reach
the lighthouse soon 
the person
that started this journey
won t be the person
that ends it 
i want to be the one
that ends it 
we should go  josie 
how long was your husband
in the shimmer 
it s hard to say  exactly 
theoretically 
as long as a year 
that s a long time to be
inside and remain intact 
i m not so sure he was intact 
i m right
about the refractions 
aren t i 
yeah 
i checked my blood last night 
it s in me 
it will be in all of us 
it was so strange hearing
sheppard s voice
in the mouth
of that creature last night 
i think  as she was dying 
part of her mind became
part of the creature
that was killing her 
imagine dying frightened
and in pain
and having that as the only
part of you which survives 
i wouldn t like that at all 
ventress wants to face it 
you want to fight it 
but i don t think i want
either of those things 
josie 
josie 
josie 
one by one  all gone 
except you 
how do you explain that 
is it something
i need to explain 
yes  you do 
i had to come back 
i m not sure any of them did 
hey 
hey 
i thought i was a man 
i had a life 
people called me kane 
and now i m not so sure 
if i wasn t kane  what was i 
was i you 
were you me 
my flesh moves like liquid 
my mind is
just cut loose 
i can t bear it 
i can t bear it 
i can t bear it 
you ever seen
a phosphorus grenade go off 
they re kinda bright 
shield your eyes 
if you ever get out of here 
you find lena 
i will 
no 
five  four  three  two   
it s the last phase 
vanished into havoc 
unfathomable mind 
and now beacon 
now sea 
dr  ventress 
lena 
we spoke 
what was it we said 
that i needed to know
what was inside
the lighthouse 
that moment s passed 
it s inside me now 
what s inside you 
it s not like us 
it s unlike us 
i don t know what it wants 
or if it wants 
but it will grow
until it encompasses
everything 
our bodies and our minds
will be fragmented
into their smallest parts
until not one part remains 
annihilation 
so it was alien 
can you describe its form 
no 
was it carbon based or   
i don t know 
what did it want 
i don t think
it wanted anything 
but it    it attacked you 
it mirrored me 
i attacked it 
i m not sure it even knew
i was there 
it came here for a reason 
it was mutating
our environment 
it was destroying everything 
it wasn t destroying 
it was changing everything 
it was making something new 
making what 
i don t know 
a team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago 
everything is ash 
if what you encountered
was once alive 
it seems it s now dead 
now will you tell me
what happened to my husband 
when the shimmer disappeared 
his blood pressure stabilized
and his pulse rate
started to rise 
a few hours later 
he was not only awake 
he was lucid 
he s still in isolation 
obviously
