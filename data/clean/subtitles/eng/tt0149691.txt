soyou could catch him
and take him to court
and get all his money
you little snoop

how was the pot roast
nice it was nice
think youll ever
go back to wisconsin
not for anything in the world
yeah
well is it that bad
it was a dead end
thats whywe left
i sometimes think about
just picking up and leaving too
whenever a new shipment
of carpets comes into my store
i believe that
somewhere in the pile
theres one that flies
its been put there for me
some beautifully handwoven
16th century persian rug
from a thousandandone nights
and i sit myself down on it
and i wave goodbye
to everybody in the store
and fly right out of the front door
when i graduate this year
my carpets gonna fly me
back east to college
you better tell your carpet
to dropyou at ucla
id like to go back east
since when
ive been thinking about it

i have to say we have not been
to the grunion run
what is a grunion
its a little coastal fish
it comes up on shore
every once in a while
during high tide
and lays its eggs in the moonlight
and then it dies
its yet another example of a mother
giving her life for her child
well some of them die
not all of them
sounds really interesting
