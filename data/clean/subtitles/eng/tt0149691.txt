then why d you marry him 
that s none of your business 
besides  he was running
around with other women 
that s not true 
you made that up 
you wanted him to
soyou could catch him
and take him to court
and get all his money 
you little snoop 
and ted is not a homosexual 
i never said that 
yes  you did 
oh  no  i did not 
oh  yes  you did

but i never said it 
   light in the loafers  
is not exactly the same thing 
all right  mother 
ted said he loves you

ann  that summer i turned 17   
and i started planning my escape 
 blue danube waltz playing 
my mother finally found
a job she liked
at a convalescent home 
she was good at what she did 
here  look at yourself 
at last she had
a captive audience 
that was a good one 
good  good 
 slowly  waltz 
and where s that tongue
going on the   l   
waltz 
it would help ifwe had
a little bit snazzier
lipstick here jack 
ha ha ha 
ok jack  we gotta get her
some perky lipstick 
make that pucker 
let s try it again 
  wuh   
waltz 
i appreciate
how you are with my mother 
how you are with everybody 
she s coming along all right 
i d like to talk more about this 
afterwork 
i could take you out to
lunch or dinner some time 
uh  thanks 
tell you all about
the carpet business 
yeah  sometime 
bye  guys 
bye  ann 
must have bagged
a zillion groceries today 
you must be so tired 
i really appreciate
you going with me 
i just couldn t deal
with it by myself 
every time this guy looks
at me and asks me out 
it s just so sad 
he s so   nice 
when my wife died 
i started eating out all the time 
how was the pot roast 
nice  it was nice 
think you ll ever
go back to wisconsin 
  not for anything in the world 
  yeah 
well  is it that bad 
it was a dead end 
that s whywe left 
i sometimes think about
just picking up and leaving  too 
whenever a new shipment
of carpets comes into my store 
i believe that
somewhere in the pile
there s one that flies 
it s been put there for me 
some beautifully handwoven
16th century persian rug
from a thousandandone nights 
and i sit myself down on it
and i wave good bye
to everybody in the store
and fly right out of the front door 
when i graduate this year 
my carpet s gonna fly me
back east to college 
you better tell your carpet
to dropyou at ucla 
i d like to go back east 
since when 
i ve been thinking about it 
well  independence 
sounds like her mother 
she s not going back east 
she s going to ucla 
no  i m not 
honey  the hourly wage
bagging groceries at the supermarket
is never going to pay
for an eastern college 
but i m saving
and i can apply for financial aid
and grandma said she d try to help 
your grandma knows about this 
she said when the time comes
maybe she ll be able
to help out a little 
i d like to go away to college 
why 
because i want to get away 
you wanted to get out
of bay city  didn t you 
i want to get out
of beverly hills 
i m sorry i brought this up 
you re gonna end up back in bay city 
i didn t say that 
after all this time 
after all that i ve sacrificed 
jack  um   
have you two ever been
down to the grunion run 
no jack 
i have to say we have not been
to the grunion run 
what is a grunion 
it s a little coastal fish 
it comes up on shore
every once in a while
during high tide
and lays its eggs in the moonlight 
and then it dies 
it s yet another example of a mother
giving her life for her child 
well  some of them die 
not all of them 
sounds really interesting 
i d love to see that 
well  i d like to take you 
great 
i like him 
he gets on my nerves 
he likes you 
and if he asks you out again 
i hope you ll go 
he asked me to go to las vegas
for the weekend 
good  you should go 
you might have fun 
he is not my type 
he s not my idea of fun 
go to vegas  mom 
take a chance 
you don t have to fall
in love with him 
i m not asking you
to even sleep with him 
oh  thank you 
you could win the jackpot even 
all right  i will go to vegas 
fine  just stop it 
but you are going to ucla 
it s a state school 
it s all that we can afford 
and i do not want to hear
another word about it 
 exhales 
  jackpot
