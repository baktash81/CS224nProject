you have pushed it  young lady 
daddy  what happened to constantine 
uh  well   
constantine went to live in chicago
with her family 
people move on  skeeter 
but i do wish that she d
stayed down here with us 
i don t believe you 
 sighing 
she would ve written and told me 
did you fire her 
we were just a job to her  honey 
with them  it s all about money 
you ll understand that once you ve
hired help of your own 
  she raised me 
  she did not 
she worked here for 29 years 
it was a colored thing
and i put it behind me 
excuse me a moment  rebecca  my daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers 
 door slamming 
 birds calling 
what you doing hiding out here  girl 
i couldn t tell mama i didn t
get asked to the dance 
it s all right 
some things we just got to
keep to ourselves  right 
all the boys say i m ugly 
mama was third runner up in
the miss south carolina pageant 
i wish you d quit
feeling sorry for yourself 
now  that s ugly 
ugly is something that
goes up inside you 
it s mean and hurtful  like them boys 
now you re not one of them  is you 
i didn t think so  honey 
every day   
every day you re not
dead in the ground

from the point of view of the help 
these colored women
raise white children 
and in 20 years 
those children become the boss 
we love them and they love us 
but they can t even use the toilets
in our houses 
don t you find that ironic  miss stein 
i m listening 
margaret mitchell glorified
the mammy figure 
   sighing 
  who dedicates her whole life
to a white family 
but nobody ever asked mammy
how she felt about it 
so  a side to this never before heard

talks about it down here 
skeeter  who are you
talking to in there 
go away 
  who was that 
  my mother 
look

a place like jackson  mississippi 
i already have a maid

it feel   
is that your son 
yes  ma am

do you want to talk about the bathroom 
or anything about miss leefolt 
how she pays you  or has she ever
yelled at you in front of mae mobley

and read them to you 
ain t no different than writing down
my prayers 
ok 
sure 
i don t say my prayers out loud 
i can get my point across
a lot better writing them down 
i write an hour 
sometimes two  every night 
and after my prayers last night 
i got some stories down  too 
go ahead 
 my first white baby to ever look after
was named alton carrington speers 
it was 1925  and i had just turned 14 
i dropped out of school
to help mama with the bills 
alton s mama died of lung disease  
 sighs 
i loved that baby  and he loved me 
that s when i learned i could make
children feel proud of theyself 
alton used to always be asking me
how come i was black 
just ate him up 
and one time  i told him it was because
i drank too much coffee   chortling 
you should have seen his face 
this was just so great

you mean housekeeping 
jesus  i can t think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column 
except for maybe writing one 
well  i can 
working with a bunch of greasy 
stinky men in the middle of the ocean 
it sounds like a ploy to find a husband 
becoming an expert in keeping house 
well  aren t you a genius 
you figured out my whole scheme 
isn t that what all you girls
from ole miss major in   
   professional husband hunting 
who is hungry 
i m sorry  but were you dropped
on your head as an infant 
or were you just born stupid 
 coughing 
 squawking 
 chopping 
so  what can you cook 
oh  um  i can cook cornpone 
boil potatoes 
i can do grits 
 laughing 
well   
   i reckon if there s anything you
ought to know about cooking  it s this 
the most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar 
  you got gum in your hair 
   sizzling 
you got a squeaky door hinge   
crisco 
how pretty 
looks like frosting 
you got bags under your eyes 
want to soften your husband s
scaly feet 
mm hm  crisco 
but it s best for frying chicken 
frying chicken just   
   tend to make you
feel better about life 
at least me  anyway

that would be wrong 
don t give up on this  miss skeeter

they killed my son 
he fell carrying two by fours
at the mill 
truck run over him  crushed his lung 
 whispering  aibileen 
that white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck
