vegetables  like monkeys do 
honey  the reason that monkeys
eat so many fruits and vegetables

  low fat    and   diet   
words designed to scare us into
changing what has worked for years 
well  l say let s stay the course 
remember  a fat frank

l propose something that every
organism in this city will enjoy

  liquids  bed rest  just to be safe 
  we ll do no such thing 
l won t listen to the white blood cell
with the worst record in frank 
lkeep those opinions
in that mushy head   
   or you ll find yourself
in our next nosebleed  understood

now  why don t we find you
another   
   more capable officer to work with 
sir  if it s all the same to you   
   l think l ll stay with jones 
suit yourself 
you didn t have to do that 
l don t need your sympathy 
lt s not sympathy 
l m here to make frank feel better 
lf this alleged virus   
   impedes my mission 
l must pursue it 
yeah  whatever 
what did the mayor mean by   record   
you did something terrible 
didn t you 
sometimes being too careful
is all it takes 
how so 
l was cruising the digestive tract 
just minding my own business 
outside was shane s science fair 
everyone was excited 
the winner would get their picture
in the localpaper

that s how long the state says 
every time the tide came in 
they d flush   
   all the bad stuff out 
can you eat them 
well  if my hypotenuse is correct 
sure 
yeah  definitely 
you got yourself a sale 
you should check your math
on that one 
i was in the kidneys
while a 6 31 was in progress 
that s incoming shellfiish 
i went to the stomach  to be safe 
unscheduled shellfiish
now arriving at gate six 
and you must be shane s dad 
guilty as charged  frank detorre 
pleasure to meet you 
l am mrs  boyd

oh  my god  l got the giggles 
she s a sweetie pie 
she wants to go to the city

yeah  she told me that 
frank  it s so wonderful to see   
   shane participating
in the science fair 
since her mother passed away 
she s had a really hard time   
   being part of the group activities 
she s going to be okay 
and then i saw him 
he was on the clammiest oyster
l d ever seen 
mr  detorre

those oysters 
the oysters 
oh  yeah  that s zach s project

to push him along 
he just started it this morning 
which is funny 
we ll give him an  a  anyway 
we ll give him an  a  anyway 
mr  detorre 
there was no time for questions 
i did what i had to do 
look at that guy 
you can guess which photo
made it to the paper the next day 
overnight  frank became
the town laughingstock 
the photo ran in every daily
across the country 
he got fiired from his job
at the pea soup factory 
lucky for us  bob hooked up
frank with ajob at the zoo 
it was a 90  cut in pay 
but it was the best we could do 
needless to say 
none of this helped shane 
and as for me  l got suspended
for unnecessary force 
since then  every day l wonder 
  did l do the right thing   
from the description 
it sounds like you were justified 
excuse me 
oysters are filled
with dangerous bacteria 
l ve been trying to tell everybody 
  i never thought you d be on my side 
  i never thought you d be right
