rakel 
you are familiar with emanuel vigeland 
the brothers  work was most likely
influenced by their father 
who turned to drink  had an illegitimate
child with a younger woman 
you can clearly see in each artist s case 
the recurring themes of love 
perverted and betrayed   
edda  the good news is that
with this new version of the evisync 
from version 3 6 to version 4 0 
allows you to manually push the data
back to the server
using the cellular network 
the evisync will automatically
upload all the new data
to the central police server here 
every 12 hours 
we ve also done some work
on the fingerprint scanning software 
so  you will notice a significantly faster
opening time after scanning your fingerprint 
but please make sure
that your fingerprint scans
are done cleanly  and clearly from the start 
if you are experiencing
a high number of false scans 
this is probably because your fingerprints
were scanned incorrectly from the start 
 indistinct chatter 
that must be nearly

no  just relax  just relax 
 guests applauding 
stop  i run over a dozen companies 
when people ask me
why i ve given up so much
of my time to lead this bid 
i tell them it s because
i never had these opportunities 
when i was a boy 
the only winter sports i engaged in were
the uphill snow shovel
and the 50 meter firewood carry 
 all laughing 
that is why i believe
passionately that this cup
is about much more than just
publicity for our fair city 
homicides 
just missing persons for now 
but the pattern is disturbing 
and i received this 
prints 
it isn t just the letter 
he reported her missing before he killed her 
he was watching us the entire time 
what do you need 
a small team 
i ll set up a separate
incident room at the mill 
all right  but i don t want
a word of this to be leaked   
to the press 
press  yeah  not until
this fucking bid is over 
vetlesen 
you look very pretty tonight  you know that 
and now you re trying to   
you see  now you try to smile

harry  i ve got the names and the addresses

they do  however  perform abortions 
what is it 
  magnus  get me the list 
  magnus  what list 
the list of doctors at the gellion 
i m thinking that he s going after
women that he disapproves of 
here  all the doctors at gellion
from the last five years 
how did he know  how did he know
sylvia ottersen was pregnant 
 idar vetlesen  
birte becker had an appointment
with the same doctor 
 vetlesen clears throat 
dr  idar vetlesen 
yes  that s me 
step in 
birte becker and sylvia ottersen
were both patients of yours 
no  they were both patients at the clinic 
i never met sylvia ottersen 
harry  can you tell me who treated her 
no  i m bound by patient confidentiality 
she s dead 
oh   
oh  no 
right  well  doctor confidentiality 
in theory  would it be possible
for you to access her medical files 
even if you didn t treat her yourself 
well  in theory  yes 
the doctors at the clinic have access
to the files of every patient
should they choose to look at them 
which i did not 
what did you see birte becker about 
well  that is confidential 
how do you know arve stop 
  arve 
  hmm 
well  i ve known arve for years 
i do research in premature birth 
we have a small charity  and arve stop
is one of our biggest supporters 
huh  i wouldn t have thought that a man
who goes on so much about family values
would support a clinic
that specializes in abortion 
well  we specialize in many different areas 
and mr  stop supports
our research in premature birth 
so  do you see each other socially 
 chuckles  yeah  well 
that depends on how you mean   
it is quite simple  actually 
do you have friends in common 
yes  we mix in the same circles  so   
why are you   
have you ever practiced in other
parts of the country  dr  vetlesen

yes  yes  in bergen 
do you live alone 
yes  i  uh    i am a reluctant bachelor 
is there anyone in the house right now 
because i thought i saw someone
in the window when i passed 
well  if you want to take a look around 
i will need to see a search warrant 
in fact  if you don t mind 
i would like to call my lawyer
before i answer any more of your questions 
that won t be necessary  dr  vetlesen 
you can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time 
 door closes

jesus  anyone can see
he s trying to hide something 
edda  like a netflix type thing  oh  hey 
cloudberry 
if you hadn t told me to look out for it 
i d have assumed she was attached
to his security detail

vetlesen was his pimp 
and they were both in bergen
when the murders started 
i know how much you want this 
but you can t force the pieces to fit 
i called the gellion clinic 
and vetlesen wasn t even working
the day he was supposed to meet birte becker 
they found two dead bodies in his
house  and birte becker s phone 
yeah  well  isn t that convenient  then 
so  hagen has his killer and arve stop s
safe  and no questions are asked 
do you actually think he killed them 
i don t know 
i don t think either of us do for sure

it is a red volvo registered
to a mathias lund helgesen 
rjukan  2421 
the house is pretty remote 
there s an access road  but that s it 
and there s a big lake around it 
helicopters are grounded because
of the weather  but delta is on their way 
harry  anything on mathias  family 
magnus  okay  i ve got something here 
jonas lund helgesen  former police
officer  lost his job in  89 
a scandal involving
a woman drowning in a car 
probable suicide 
she had a son 
stop 
father unknown

magnus  harry 
harry  we ve lost him 
 rakel s cell phone ringing 
 whirring 
sit down  harry 
pass me the gun 
i didn t think you d find me 
perhaps the pills helped  after all 
i spoke to filip becker 
mathias  what s going to happen
when josephine becker
finds out he isn t her father 
she ll still love him 
wrong answer 
let s try again 
was it right for sylvia ottersen
to kill her unborn child
simply because she couldn t
keep track of who the father was 
that was her choice 
too short 
maybe she was afraid 
what about you  harry 
you have a woman who loves you 
a boy who s devoted to you 
why did you abandon them 
  they deserve better 
   mathias scoffs 
too easy 
   whimpering 
  because i m selfish 
i m an addict 
there isn t enough room for them 
 relieves pressure 
mathias  you know  when i first saw
your picture in the paper
with all those medals 
i thought   that man
must have a perfect family  
and here you are 
last question 
this boy  who doesn t even know
who his father is 
who s had to put up with so many men
like you and me taking his place   
does his mother deserve to live 
why don t you ask him 
 mathias groans 
 both grunting 
 harry screaming 
 harry groaning 
you all right 
kill him 
kill him 
kill him 
 wind howling 
 panting 
come on 
i m ready  i m here 
come on 
 gunshot 
 harry groaning 
 continues groaning 
i know why you blame her 
you ve been wrong the whole time 
it wasn t her 
it wasn t your mother who didn t want you 
it was your father 
it would ve been better for him
had you not been born 
 grunting 
 sighs deeply 
 panting 
the pathologist detected
traces of the drug  ketonal 
but the direct cause of death was drowning
as a result of blood filling her lungs 
twenty four stab wounds
were found in her mouth 
all at regular intervals and at
