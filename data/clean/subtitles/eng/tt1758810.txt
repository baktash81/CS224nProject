rakel
you are familiar with emanuel vigeland
the brothers work was most likely
influenced by their father
who turned to drink had an illegitimate
child with a younger woman
you can clearly see in each artists case
the recurring themes of love
perverted and betrayed
edda the good news is that
with this new version of the evisync
from version 36 to version 40
allows you to manually push the data
back to the server
using the cellular network
the evisync will automatically
upload all the new data
to the central police server here
every 12 hours
weve also done some work
on the fingerprint scanning software
so you will notice a significantly faster
opening time after scanning your fingerprint
but please make sure
that your fingerprint scans
are done cleanly and clearly from the start
if you are experiencing
a high number of false scans
this is probably because your fingerprints
were scanned incorrectly from the start
indistinct chatter

a whole week of mail this time

no wait wait
no its fine its fine
no just relax just relax
guests applauding
stop i run over a dozen companies
when people ask me
why ive given up so much
of my time to lead this bid
i tell them its because
i never had these opportunities
when i was a boy
the only winter sports i engaged in were
the uphill snow shovel
and the 50meter firewood carry
all laughing
that is why i believe
passionately that this cup
is about much more than just
publicity for our fair city
homicides
just missing persons for now
but the pattern is disturbing
and i received this
prints
it isnt just the letter
he reported her missing before he killed her
he was watching us the entire time
what do you need
a small team
ill set up a separate
incident room at the mill
all right but i dont want
a word of this to be leaked
to the press
press yeah not until
this fucking bid is over
vetlesen

forensic reports indicate
saw marks on her neck
status unmarried
two children by different fathers
harry ive got the names and the addresses
of sylvia ottersens boyfriends
now she went to the clinic
the second of november
but they wont break patient confidentiality
they do however perform abortions
what is it
magnus get me the list
magnus what list
the list of doctors at the gellion
im thinking that hes going after
women that he disapproves of
here all the doctors at gellion
from the last five years
how did he know how did he know
sylvia ottersen was pregnant
idar vetlesen
birte becker had an appointment
with the same doctor
vetlesen clears throat
dr idar vetlesen
yes thats me
step in
birte becker and sylvia ottersen
were both patients of yours
no they were both patients at the clinic
i never met sylvia ottersen
harry can you tell me who treated her
no im bound by patient confidentiality
shes dead
oh
oh no
right well doctor confidentiality
in theory would it be possible
for you to access her medical files
even if you didnt treat her yourself
well in theory yes
the doctors at the clinic have access
to the files of every patient
should they choose to look at them
which i did not
what did you see birte becker about
well that is confidential
how do you know arve stop
arve
hmm
well ive known arve for years
i do research in premature birth
we have a small charity and arve stop
is one of our biggest supporters
huh i wouldnt have thought that a man
who goes on so much about family values
would support a clinic
that specializes in abortion
well we specialize in many different areas
and mr stop supports
our research in premature birth
so do you see each other socially
chuckles yeah well
that depends on how you mean
it is quite simple actually
do you have friends in common
yes we mix in the same circles so
why are you
have you ever practiced in other
parts of the country dr vetlesen
scoffs
yes
i have in eidsvoll in lillehammer
i see you have a picture
of mon plaisir pavilion in bergen
yes yes in bergen
do you live alone
yes i uh i am a reluctant bachelor
is there anyone in the house right now
because i thought i saw someone
in the window when i passed
well if you want to take a look around
i will need to see a search warrant
in fact if you dont mind
i would like to call my lawyer
before i answer any more of your questions
that wont be necessary dr vetlesen
you can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time
door closes
harry hey
hey
what was that
what
he isnt a suspect yet we need
his permission to search the house
scoffs i know that
whyd you ask him about arve stop

and it was an innocent question
jesus anyone can see
hes trying to hide something
edda like a netflix type thing oh hey

laila aasen and arve stop

vetlesen was his pimp
and they were both in bergen
when the murders started
i know how much you want this
but you cant force the pieces to fit
i called the gellion clinic
and vetlesen wasnt even working
the day he was supposed to meet birte becker
they found two dead bodies in his
house and birte beckers phone
yeah well isnt that convenient then
so hagen has his killer and arve stops
safe and no questions are asked
do you actually think he killed them
i dont know
i dont think either of us do for sure
maybe this will bring your balls back
im gonna need your weapon
its right there in front of you

some local talent in the village nearby
harry whats his name
jonas lundhelgesen
jonas no please stop
magnus harry
harry weve lost him
rakels cell phone ringing
whirring
sit down harry
pass me the gun
i didnt think youd find me
perhaps the pills helped after all
i spoke to filip becker
mathias whats going to happen
when josephine becker
finds out he isnt her father
shell still love him
wrong answer
lets try again
was it right for sylvia ottersen
to kill her unborn child
simply because she couldnt
keep track of who the father was
that was her choice
too short
maybe she was afraid
what about you harry
you have a woman who loves you
a boy whos devoted to you
why did you abandon them
they deserve better
mathias scoffs
too easy
whimpering
because im selfish
im an addict
there isnt enough room for them
relieves pressure
mathias you know when i first saw
your picture in the paper
with all those medals
i thought that man
must have a perfect family
and here you are
last question
this boy who doesnt even know
who his father is
whos had to put up with so many men
like you and me taking his place
does his mother deserve to live
why dont you ask him
mathias groans
both grunting
harry screaming
harry groaning
you all right
kill him
kill him
kill him
wind howling
panting
come on
im ready im here
come on
gunshot
harry groaning
continues groaning
i know why you blame her
youve been wrong the whole time
it wasnt her
it wasnt your mother who didnt want you
it was your father
it wouldve been better for him
had you not been born
grunting
sighs deeply
panting
the pathologist detected
traces of the drug ketonal
but the direct cause of death was drowning
as a result of blood filling her lungs
twentyfour stab wounds
were found in her mouth
all at regular intervals and at
