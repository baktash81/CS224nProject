mmm 
i haven t got anything for you here 
  why not 
  well

look  i ll have it for you tonight

plaza athénée 
mike  who you have for
english lit  bayley  he sucks 
  which room is biesenthal s 
  107 
you were picked for his seminar 
you weren t 
ah  levy  good of you to come 
won t you join us 
tell us the subject of
your dissertation  please 
tyranny  sir 
the use of tyranny in
american political life 
such as 
maybe   
coolidge breaking up
the boston police strike 
roosevelt putting japanese americans
into concentration camps   
you might consider the
mccarthy business 
  sir 
  mccarthy 
senator from wisconsin  ran a
series of purges in the  50s 
yes  i m aware of that  sir 
i was planning a chapter on him 
a chapter  i see  yes  interesting 
well  you four have
the dubious honour
of having been picked from over
200 applicants for this seminar 
there s a shortage of natural resources 
breathable air and adequate claret 
but there s no
shortage of historians 
we grind you out like link sausages 
it s called progress 
manufactured doctorates
is called progress 
i say   let us hush this cry of progress
till 10 000 years have passed  
that s a quote  who said that 
come on  who said that 
well  somebody must know the answer 
tennyson  alfred lord tennyson 
you can t compete on a doctoral level
and not know locksley hall 
i hope you all flunk  dismissed 
  levy 
  yeah 
come 
oh  sit 
i knew your father 
rather well  in point of fact 
he was my mentor 
i know 
  there was another of you 
  i have an older brother 
a rich  successful businessman 
my father would have disowned him 
why are you at columbia
for your doctorate 
it s not just the way things worked out 
your father got his at columbia 
you can t fill his footsteps 
i m sorry to say 
you might end up leaving
larger tracks than that 
but they ll be your tracks 
they won t be his 
why didn t you answer
that tennyson question 
it was obvious you knew 
i don t know 
how am i to fathom your mind if
you continue to hide it from me 
if you persist 
i ll conclude you re a drone 
the mccarthy section is central
to your dissertation  yes 
the mccarthy section is
central to your dissertation  yes 
yes 
very worrisome 
you wish to write about a period in
our history that destroyed your father 
but we re talking about an
objective doctoral thesis 
it mustn t become a hysterical crusade 
that s not the way to clear him 
all right  you may go 
i don t have to worry about clearing
him  because he was innocent 
don t you think he was innocent  sir 
no  i think he was guilty 
he was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naive 
of not being able to cope with the
humiliation of being dismissed 
but of the charges 
i know he was innocent 
and if it matters  levy 
i wept the day he died 
it was a bad day for all of us  sir 
under no circumstances do anything 
but call as soon as you   
yes  i have the number 
bye 
bonjour  commander

here that we don t know about 
  can t you be more specific 
  yes 
i almost got my ass blown
off at the flea market 
i d like to find out by whom and why 
also  leclerc was not expecting me 
you sure you re not overusing
your limited imagination 
the bomb was not imaginary 
three bombs a day have gone
off since the strikes began 
  i know that 
  everyone with a grievance is busy 
  am i crazy 
  yeah  you re crazy 
  but you ll check it out 
  of course

we use you because you re the best

good evening 
i m not one to be mocked  behave   
don t give me shit about my behaviour 
not after what you ve been pulling 
  i ve done nothing 
  so chen acted on his own 
i don t mind you hiring him 
but getting my brother involved 
  it was nothing 
  it was a violation 
we do not involve family  ever 
think of it as a warning 
nothing more 
think of that as a warning
and nothing more 
you d like to fight  wouldn t you 
it will not happen 
i m much too old and
far too smart for that 
but we must talk  truthfully 
  are you to be trusted 
  no 
is that the truth  or are you
trying again to upset me 
  you ll go to the bank sooner or later 
  perhaps i ve already been 
if so  you wouldn t be here with me 
  what else do you know 
  i know you re panicking 
  you think you ll get robbed 
  who would do that 
  obviously  you think i would 
  well 
  can i trust you 
  you never could  you only had to 
we re talking of my safety 
  may i be candid 
  yes 
i couldn t give a fuck about you   
hello  hi  elsa

you can understand that  right 
good evening  sir

i m sorry to intrude  i was
a friend of your brother s 
my name is peter janeway 
call me janey  all my friends do 
i m not your friend 
listen 
  i m anxious as you to find who did this 
  i m a little more anxious 
  i think it may have been political 
  political  why 
considering what your brother did 
and your father  of course 
  what about my father 
  he was h v  levy  for christ sakes 
he s been dead for 20 years 
and he was innocent 
what are you saying 
get off my back  they ve been
after me for two hours 
i didn t mean to imply   
they told me they were done 
what are you saying 
i m sorry 
come in 
listen   
why don t we begin with
what happened tonight  hmm 
perhaps you could give
me some of the details 
i was here  doc died  you came 
that s it 
i m a demon for details 
  you want me to explain  then 
  that s right 
  where did your brother live 
  in washington 
  what did he do 
  oil business 
wrong 
i know exactly how
doc made his living 
the closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas 
  tell me what you re talking about 
  all right  follow me 
doc lived in washington 
which is the centre of   
  government 
  correct 
all the branches are competitive 
truth is they re all
paranoid schmucks 
when the gap gets too large between
what the fbi can handle effectively
and what the cia doesn t
wanna deal with  we step in 
  who s we 
  the division 
  and my brother worked with you 
  yes 
you re full of shit 
  what do you do exactly 
  we provide 
  provide what 
  anything 
and you two work together 
why didn t doc tell me 
why did he lie to me 
he was afraid you d be
disappointed in him  i expect 
we were very close for
many years  believe me 
i know whereof i speak 
doc was desperate to get here 
remember anything he said 
he said my name a couple of times 
okay  i m just guessing now 
but whoever killed him will
probably want to speak to you 
  i don t know anything 
  they won t know till they talk with you 
i m staying across the park 
at the carlyle 
and if you don t mind 
i d like to use you as bait 
  bait 
  yes 
  will they come tonight 
  no 
i know it s risky  and i don t wanna
force you to do it  it s up to you 
tub 
all right 
all right  i got it  here it is 
turn it off  all right 
shit  jesus 
shit 
help

something is safe or not
unless i know specifically
what you re talking about 
is it safe 
tell me what the  it  refers to 
is it safe 
yes  it s safe  it s very safe 
so safe you wouldn t believe it 
is it safe 
no  it s not safe 
it s very dangerous  be careful 
relax  relax 
come on  open  open  it s okay 
  that hurt  i should think it would 
  uh huh 
you should take better
care of your teeth 
you have quite a cavity here 
  is it safe 
  i told you i can t tell you   
  think he knows 
  of course  he s being very stubborn 
no  please  please don t  no 
it s okay 
is it not remarkable 
simple oil of cloves and
how amazing the results 
life can be that simple 
relief  discomfort 
now  which of these i next apply 
that decision is in your hands 
so take your time and tell me 
  is it safe 
  please   
please stop 
  take him 
  i got him 
more 
thank you 
more 
thank you  thank you 
things are coming together 
down  or your head gets blown off 
those two guys i wasted
work for christian szell 
  know that name 
  no 
he did experiments at auschwitz 
he was called the white angel 
der weiße engel  due to his white hair 
the wealthiest and most
wanted nazi left alive 
he s hiding out in uruguay 
in  45  szell told jews in auschwitz
he d help them escape for a price 
he started out with gold  naturally 
but went on to diamonds 
heard this 
szell saw the end early 
his brother took the
diamonds to america
to a safe deposit box in new york 
szell s brother had the key 
the only other key
szell kept in uruguay 
if he comes out to use it 
he ll expose himself to great risk 
everything went fine till his
brother got killed by an oil truck 
why was it natural
to start with gold 
he took it from the jews 
teeth before he burned them 
szell was a dentist 
he s not coming to america 
mr janeway  he s here 
no  we d have known it 
the dentist almost killed me 
he kept saying   is it safe  
white hair  keep your head down 
did he have white hair 
he was bald 
he s shaved his head 
he s here  and he s panicked 
  why is he after me 
  your brother was a diamond courier 
szell thinks doc said something
to you before he died 
  did he 
  you say my brother worked for szell 
no  he worked for us 
everything we do cuts both ways 
szell ratted on all his buddies 
he kept track on all the nazis 
when we wanted to bring
one in  we went to szell 
babe  you gotta do one
thing for me  just one thing 
  quit protecting doc 
  i m not 
  he kept alive to say something 
  he didn t 
  he must have  tell me 
  nothing 
shit 
i thought you killed them 
you killed them 
you killed them 
you killed them 
you fucking killed them 
you killed my brother 
i don t think he knows anything 
i think he knows too much 
you can afford to think
what you wish  i can t 
the gun had blanks 
the knife a retractable blade 
hardly original  but effective enough 
i think you ll agree 
i m told you are a graduate student 
brilliant  yeah 
you re an historian 
and i am part of history 
i should have thought you
would have found me interesting 
frankly  i am disappointed
in your silence 
why do you have so little accent 
i had alexia as a child 
alexia is a disease   
i know  it s where you can t
understand written speech 
highest marks 
at any event  my writing is childish still 
but i m a fanatic about spoken language 
i envy you your school days 
enjoy them 
it s the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you 
i know i behaved terribly 
but i had to be sure what you knew 
you see   
i m positive your
brother meant to rob me
when i left the bank
with my diamonds 
i don t know anything 
  did scylla plan the robbery alone 
  robbery 
  you know the value of diamonds 
  no  i don t 
neither do i  not in today s market 
tomorrow  i must go and find
out before i go to the bank 
you see   
your brother was incredibly strong 
strength is often inherited 
he died in your arms 
he travelled far and in
great pain to do that 
there has to be a reason 
i don t know anything 
karl 
please don t worry 
i m not going into that cavity 
that nerve s already dying 
a live  freshly cut nerve
is infinitely more sensitive 
so i ll just drill into a healthy
tooth until i reach the pulp 
unless  of course 
you can tell me that it s safe 
erhard 
he knew nothing  if he d known 
he would have told 
get rid of him 
i don t think you ve heard the news 
  what is that 
  your flight is at 1 00 tomorrow 
  you are a very confident young man 
  it s all a front 
just think of me as any
young executive on the come 
you re uncontrollable 
what you offer us is valuable  but it s
not worth the chaos you re causing 
and if i m unable to conclude
my business by 1 00 
you ll just have to
manage that  won t you 
as far as we re concerned 
mr szell  you re a relic 
and you re on your way 
i find you rather detestable 
may i say that without
hurting your feelings

jesus christ 
i was in a state
of hysteria  you know 
don t you want to take
a closer look than that 
  no 
  you see   
in a sense  one becomes
more emotional with age 
first after a lifetime of being
taken by friends and enemies alike 
and then  just when you think
you have your possession sure 
your health begins to go 
  that is  of course  the ultimate theft 
  that s close enough 
  in the circumstances  one s paranoia   
  close enough 
     gets out of hand 
  stop 
well 
what are you going
to do now  shoot me 
no  i don t think so 
then you ll take these from me 
if i could say a word about that
