you were picked for his seminar
you werent
ah levy good of you to come
wont you join us
tell us the subject of
your dissertation please
tyranny sir
the use of tyranny in
american political life
such as
maybe
coolidge breaking up
the boston police strike
roosevelt putting japaneseamericans
into concentration camps
you might consider the
mccarthy business
sir
mccarthy
senator from wisconsin ran a
series of purges in the 50s
yes im aware of that sir
i was planning a chapter on him
a chapter i see yes interesting
well you four have
the dubious honour
of having been picked from over
200 applicants for this seminar
theres a shortage of natural resources
breathable air and adequate claret
but theres no
shortage of historians
we grind you out like link sausages
its called progress
manufactured doctorates
is called progress
i say let us hush this cry of progress
till 10000 years have passed
thats a quote who said that
come on who said that
well somebody must know the answer
tennyson alfred lord tennyson
you cant compete on a doctoral level
and not know locksley hall
i hope you all flunk dismissed
levy
yeah
come
oh sit
i knew your father
rather well in point of fact
he was my mentor
i know
there was another of you
i have an older brother
a rich successful businessman
my father would have disowned him
why are you at columbia
for your doctorate
its not just the way things worked out
your father got his at columbia
you cant fill his footsteps
im sorry to say
you might end up leaving
larger tracks than that
but theyll be your tracks
they wont be his
why didnt you answer
that tennyson question
it was obvious you knew
i dont know
how am i to fathom your mind if
you continue to hide it from me
if you persist
ill conclude youre a drone
the mccarthy section is central
to your dissertation yes
the mccarthy section is
central to your dissertation yes
yes
very worrisome
you wish to write about a period in
our history that destroyed your father
but were talking about an
objective doctoral thesis
it mustnt become a hysterical crusade
thats not the way to clear him
all right you may go
i dont have to worry about clearing
him because he was innocent
dont you think he was innocent sir
no i think he was guilty
he was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naive
of not being able to cope with the
humiliation of being dismissed
but of the charges
i know he was innocent
and if it matters levy
i wept the day he died
it was a bad day for all of us sir
under no circumstances do anything
but call as soon as you
yes i have the number
bye

dont give me shit about my behaviour
not after what youve been pulling
ive done nothing
so chen acted on his own
i dont mind you hiring him
but getting my brother involved
it was nothing
it was a violation
we do not involve family ever
think of it as a warning
nothing more
think of that as a warning
and nothing more
youd like to fight wouldnt you
it will not happen
im much too old and
far too smart for that
but we must talk truthfully
are you to be trusted
no
is that the truth or are you
trying again to upset me
youll go to the bank sooner or later
perhaps ive already been
if so you wouldnt be here with me

im anxious as you to find who did this
im a little more anxious
i think it may have been political
political why
considering what your brother did
and your father of course
what about my father
he was hv levy for christ sakes
hes been dead for 20 years
and he was innocent
what are you saying

after me for two hours

what happened tonight hmm
perhaps you could give
me some of the details
i was here doc died you came
thats it
im a demon for details
you want me to explain then
thats right
where did your brother live
in washington
what did he do
oil business
wrong
i know exactly how
doc made his living
the closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas
tell me what youre talking about
all right follow me
doc lived in washington
which is the centre of
government
correct
all the branches are competitive
truth is theyre all
paranoid schmucks
when the gap gets too large between
what the fbi can handle effectively
and what the cia doesnt
wanna deal with we step in
whos we
the division
and my brother worked with you
yes
youre full of shit
what do you do exactly
we provide
provide what
anything
and you two work together
why didnt doc tell me
why did he lie to me
he was afraid youd be
disappointed in him i expect
we were very close for
many years believe me
i know whereof i speak
doc was desperate to get here
remember anything he said
he said my name a couple of times
okay im just guessing now
but whoever killed him will
probably want to speak to you
i dont know anything
they wont know till they talk with you
im staying across the park
at the carlyle
and if you dont mind
id like to use you as bait
bait
yes
will they come tonight

i know its risky and i dont wanna
force you to do it its up to you

that decision is in your hands
so take your time and tell me

please
please stop
take him

more
thank you

thank you thank you
things are coming together
down or your head gets blown off
those two guys i wasted
work for christian szell
know that name
no
he did experiments at auschwitz
he was called the white angel
der weiße engel due to his white hair
the wealthiest and most
wanted nazi left alive
hes hiding out in uruguay
in 45 szell told jews in auschwitz
hed help them escape for a price
he started out with gold naturally
but went on to diamonds
heard this
szell saw the end early
his brother took the
diamonds to america
to a safe deposit box in new york
szells brother had the key
the only other key
szell kept in uruguay
if he comes out to use it
hell expose himself to great risk
everything went fine till his
brother got killed by an oil truck
why was it natural
to start with gold
he took it from the jews
teeth before he burned them
szell was a dentist
hes not coming to america
mr janeway hes here
no wed have known it
the dentist almost killed me
he kept saying is it safe
white hair keep your head down
did he have white hair
he was bald
hes shaved his head
hes here and hes panicked
why is he after me
your brother was a diamond courier
szell thinks doc said something
to you before he died
did he
you say my brother worked for szell
no he worked for us
everything we do cuts both ways
szell ratted on all his buddies
he kept track on all the nazis
when we wanted to bring
one in we went to szell
babe you gotta do one
thing for me just one thing
quit protecting doc
im not
he kept alive to say something
he didnt
he must have tell me
nothing
shit
i thought you killed them
you killed them
you killed them
you killed them
you fucking killed them
you killed my brother
i dont think he knows anything
i think he knows too much
you can afford to think
what you wish i cant
the gun had blanks
the knife a retractable blade
hardly original but effective enough
i think youll agree
im told you are a graduate student
brilliant yeah
youre an historian
and i am part of history
i should have thought you
would have found me interesting
frankly i am disappointed
in your silence
why do you have so little accent
i had alexia as a child
alexia is a disease
i know its where you cant
understand written speech
highest marks
at any event my writing is childish still
but im a fanatic about spoken language
i envy you your school days
enjoy them
its the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you
i know i behaved terribly
but i had to be sure what you knew
you see
im positive your
brother meant to rob me
when i left the bank
with my diamonds
i dont know anything
did scylla plan the robbery alone
robbery
you know the value of diamonds
no i dont
neither do i not in todays market
tomorrow i must go and find
out before i go to the bank
you see
your brother was incredibly strong
strength is often inherited
he died in your arms
he travelled far and in
great pain to do that
there has to be a reason
i dont know anything
karl
please dont worry
im not going into that cavity
that nerves already dying
a live freshlycut nerve
is infinitely more sensitive
so ill just drill into a healthy
tooth until i reach the pulp
unless of course
you can tell me that its safe
erhard
he knew nothing if hed known
he would have told
get rid of him
i dont think youve heard the news
what is that
your flight is at 100 tomorrow
you are a very confident young man
its all a front
just think of me as any
young executive on the come
youre uncontrollable
what you offer us is valuable but its
not worth the chaos youre causing
and if im unable to conclude
my business by 100
youll just have to
manage that wont you
as far as were concerned
mr szell youre a relic
and youre on your way
i find you rather detestable
may i say that without
hurting your feelings
praise from caesar
im just doing my job
i believe in my country
so did we all
jesus
come on unlock it

i was in a state
of hysteria you know
dont you want to take
a closer look than that
no
you see
in a sense one becomes
more emotional with age
first after a lifetime of being
taken by friends and enemies alike
and then just when you think
you have your possession sure
your health begins to go
that is of course the ultimate theft
thats close enough
in the circumstances ones paranoia
close enough
gets out of hand
stop
