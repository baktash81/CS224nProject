mate tottenhams due north
are you lost or just fucking stupid
still a standup comedian eh dunham
all right mate
when the major was doing your job
he wasnt nearly so chatty
probably cause
he wasnt quite so nervous either
the major always preferred a scrap
to your yammer
whats all that what is that
yammer
you reckon mate i think you should get
on the next train and fuck off out of here
before something bad happens
jeering
wed be interested to see exactly what that is
youre not exactly topflight mob
these days are you
more like a twobob mob
laughter
see now thats just plain rude
but if you fancy it who are we to let you down
come on then
come on then you fucking poncey cunt
you fucking cunt you
chanting
fucking have it come on
lets go
im telling you you dont need lewis
i will trade you keeshon and maddux for lewis
and im gonna be losing out on this deal
because keeshon hes back
with the old coach hes back with parcells
and they are gonna be an unstoppable team
you know that i know that
look man he was
comeback player of the year you know
not many guys have thrown
over 6000 yards come on
let me call you back
i gotta deal with something
buckner that 10000
i think its a pretty good deal
we never had a deal jeremy
look i know you got screwed here
but i have my familys reputation to protect
a van holden getting expelled from harvard
no way
ive got a little more at stake here matt
buckner
come on man
my dad is definitely gonna get reelected
when i graduate ill totally hook you up

youve reached carl buckner
ill be in the lvory coast for 57 years
kabul this time
whatever
seriously though when you spoke to him
what did he say
i didnt tell him
he doesnt know
i probably would have done the same thing

and our little scrap makes the headline
bloody muckrakers
so what is this
bollocks journo bullshit
no no this the gse
shh lower it son
are you guys like an organised
political movement or something
no mate were a firm
you never heard of a firm in the states
no
every football team in europes got a firm
some have two
christ i forgot how clueless you yanks are
all youve seen of us
are the stadium riots on tv come on
woman two bacon sarnies
see west ham footballs mediocre but
our firm is top notch and everyone knows it
the gse green street elite
arsenal great football shit firm the gooners
tottenham shit football and a shit firm
the yids theyre called
i put their main lad
through a phonebox window
what about millwall
ah millwall
where to even fucking begin with millwall
millwall and west ham firms hate each other
more than any other firms
sort of like the yankees and the red sox
more like the israelis and the palestinians
we havent played millwall in ten years
their top boys this geezer
named tommy hatcher horrible old cunt
back in the majors day
tommys son was killed in a scrap
after that he went completely mental
lost the plot
whos the major
ah the major quite a legend round here
he ran the gse in the 90s
when i was coming up
hardest bastard you ever saw
they say we kind of lost our way when he left
but believe me my boys are bringing
the old gse reputation right back
so basically firms are gangs
kind of but were a far cry
from all that bloods and crips bullshit
shooting a machinegun out of a moving car
at an eightyearold girl thats just cowardly
see we might be into fighting and all that
but its really about reputation
humiliating another mob in a row
or doing something the other firms
get to hear or talk about
like a yank in his first fight
battering one of birminghams main lads
here you are love sit down
thank you
i dont know how to thank you
for what you did
dont give it another thought
yesterday was a good result for us
we had a laugh a few pints
cheered on the mighty hammers
we was completely outnumbered
but we stuck by our mates
and we stood our ground no matter what
thats what its all about
looking at the fucking state of him
dont fucking start all right
what did i say to you
one simple thing no trouble
it had nothing to do with me
