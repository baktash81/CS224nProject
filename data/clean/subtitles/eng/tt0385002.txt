go on  bruv  go on  bruv 
fuck me  if i knew we was going to a bar
mitzvah  i d have brought me fucking skullcap 
mate  tottenham s due north 
are you lost or just fucking stupid 
still a stand up comedian  eh  dunham 
all right  mate 
when the major was doing your job 
he wasn t nearly so chatty 
probably  cause
he wasn t quite so nervous either 
the major always preferred a scrap
to your yammer 
  what s all that  what is that 
  yammer 
you reckon  mate  i think you should get
on the next train and fuck off out of here 
  before something bad happens 
   jeering 
we d be interested to see exactly what that is 
you re not exactly top flight mob
these days  are you 
  more like a two bob mob 
   laughter 
see  now  that s just plain rude 
but if you fancy it  who are we to let you down 
  come on  then 
  come on  then  you fucking poncey cunt 
  you fucking cunt  you 
   chanting 
fucking have it  come on 
let s go 
i m telling you  you don t need lewis 
i will trade you keeshon and maddux for lewis 
and i m gonna be losing out on this deal 
because keeshon  he s back
with the old coach  he s back with parcells 
and they are gonna be an unstoppable team 
you know that  i know that 
look  man  he was
comeback player of the year  you know 
not many guys have thrown
over 6 000 yards  come on 
let me call you back 
i gotta deal with something 
buckner  that  10 000 
i think it s a pretty good deal 
we never had a deal  jeremy 
look  i know you got screwed here 
but i have my family s reputation to protect 
a van holden getting expelled from harvard 
no way 
i ve got a little more at stake here  matt 
buckner 
come on  man 
my dad is definitely gonna get re elected 
when i graduate  i ll totally hook you up 
thanks  bro 
you re really saving my ass 
you ve reached carl buckner  i m currently
on assignment in kabul and i m unreachable 
leave a message
at the foreign correspondents desk
at the washington bureau of the times
and we ll get back to you as soon as possible 
thanks so much 
this is a security announcement
at heathrow airport 
please keep your belongings with you
at all times 
 matt  my name is matt buckner 
last spring  i got kicked out of harvard
two months shy of my diploma 
but what i was about to learn  no lvy league
school in the world could teach me 
mind the gap 
please stand clear of the closing doors 
mind the gap  please stand clear 
 woman  matt 
  hi  hey 
  hey 
  oh  my god 
  it s so good to see you

uncle matt  meet ben 
  can you believe that 
  hey there  little guy 
  he s adorable 
  yeah 
it is so good to see you 
but what are you doing here 
it doesn t make sense  why would you have
been expelled if you didn t do anything wrong 
it was my roommate  he s a total cokehead 
somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched 
they found his stash in my stuff 
i guess he d been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time 
really 
  yeah  really 
  you could tell me if you were taking   
  it s not like that 
  so you fought it and they didn t believe you 
matt  you fought it  right 
look  you don t know who this guy is 
he s a van holden 
i wouldn t have even had a chance 
so what did dad say 
 you ve reached carl buckner  
 i ll be in the lvory coast for 57 years  
  kabul this time 
  whatever 
seriously  though  when you spoke to him 
what did he say 
  i didn t tell him 
  he doesn t know 
  i probably would have done the same thing 
  yeah 
once he finds out his golden boy
got kicked out of harvard 
he ll dive headfirst
into an empty swimming pool 
  gee  thanks

  the geezer you was just fighting 
  jeremy van fucking holden 
  you done yourself proud  mate 
now we ve all stopped kissing each other s
arses  see the first punch he threw 
  on the feminine side 
  a bit gay 
  little bit larry grayson 
  come on 
  come on  yous all wanna get pinched 
  let s push him out 
 police sirens 
morning  sunshine  how do you feel 
oh  a little sore 
english breakfast  double dose of aspirin 
you ll feel sweet as a nut  mate 
  yeah 
  i gotta piss like a racehorse 
fucking journos  look at this 
west ham wins three nil
in a blinding performance
and our little scrap makes the headline 
  bloody muckrakers 
  so  what is this 
bollocks journo bullshit 
  no  no  this  the gse 
  shh  lower it  son 
are you guys like an organised
political movement or something 
no  mate  we re a firm 
you never heard of a firm in the states 
  no 
  every football team in europe s got a firm 
some have two 
christ  i forgot how clueless you yanks are 
all you ve seen of us
are the stadium riots on tv  come on 
 woman  two bacon sarnies 
see  west ham football s mediocre  but
our firm is top notch and everyone knows it 
the gse  green street elite 
arsenal  great football  shit firm  the gooners 
tottenham  shit football and a shit firm 
the yids  they re called 
i put their main lad
through a phone box window 
  what about millwall 
  ah  millwall 
where to even fucking begin with millwall 
millwall and west ham firms hate each other
more than any other firms 
  sort of like the yankees and the red sox 
  more like the israelis and the palestinians 
we haven t played millwall in ten years 
their top boy s this geezer
named tommy hatcher  horrible old cunt 
back in the major s day 
tommy s son was killed in a scrap 
after that  he went completely mental 
lost the plot 
  who s the major 
  ah  the major  quite a legend round here 
he ran the gse in the  90s
when i was coming up 
hardest bastard you ever saw 
they say we kind of lost our way when he left 
but believe me  my boys are bringing
the old gse reputation right back 
so  basically  firms are gangs 
kind of  but we re a far cry
from all that bloods and crips bullshit 
shooting a machine gun out of a moving car
at an eight year old girl  that s just cowardly 
see  we might be into fighting and all that 
but it s really about reputation 
humiliating another mob in a row
or doing something the other firms
get to hear or talk about 
like a yank in his first fight
battering one of birmingham s main lads 
  here you are  love  sit down 
  thank you 
i don t know how to thank you
for what you did 
don t give it another thought 
yesterday was a good result for us 
we had a laugh  a few pints 
cheered on the mighty hammers 
we was completely outnumbered 
but we stuck by our mates
and we stood our ground  no matter what 
that s what it s all about 
  looking at the fucking state of him 
  don t fucking start  all right 
what did i say to you 
one simple thing  no trouble 
it had nothing to do with me 
he s walking home  he gets jumped 
  he s lucky we was there 
  you re a real hero  ain t you  mate 
and you saw the whole thing from your sofa 
concentrate on your family
and leave my business to me 
my family  what is it with you  eh
