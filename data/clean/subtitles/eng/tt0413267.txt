you dont know where shrek is
lt wouldnt be inaccurate to assume
that l couldnt exactly not say that

on the contrary
lm possibly more or less
not definitely rejecting the idea
that in no way
with any amount of uncertainty
stop it
l do not know where he shouldnt be

youll have the royal food tasters
what do they do
taste the food before the king eats
to make sure its not poisoned
poisoned
or too salty
dont worry your bodyguards
will keep you safe
all of them willing
at a moments notice
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you
really
the whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance
make sure they dont die of famine
or plague

l knew l should have got that warranty
mr merlin
you know this guy
yeah he was the school magic teacher
until he had his nervous breakdown
technically l was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue
at the request of my therapist
and the school authorities l retired
to the tranquility of nature
to discover my divine purpose
can l interest anyone
in a snack or beverage
uh no
sure you dont want to try
my rock au gratin
lts organic
thanks l ate a boulder on the way in
we need directions to far far away
we who said l was going with you

so dont try to weasel out of it
lf the jobs so great you do it
understand this kid no more
mr nice guy from here on out
that was your mr nice guy
yeah and lm going to miss him
why dont you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone
was that a crack about ogres you get
your royal highness to far far away
before l kick it there
now which way am l kicking
l could tell you but since youre
in the midst
of a selfdestructive rage spiral
it would be karmically irresponsible
selfdestructive
are you going to help us or not
most definitely but only after you
take the journey to your soul
l dont think so
lts either that
or primal scream therapy
all right journey to the soul
now all of you
look into the fire of truth
and tell me what you see
ooh charades
okay l see a dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls
okay monster go for it
l see a rainbow pony
excellent work now the boy
this is lame

okay
theres a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest

he leave the little bird all alone
lts trying to fly
but it doesnt know how to
lts going to fall
proper head case you are
really messed up
okay l get it the birds me
my dad left so what
look artie um
just thought ld help set the mood
for your big hearttoheart chat
l know what its like
to not feel ready for something
even ogres get scared
you know once in a while
l know you want me
to be king but l cant
lm not cut out for it
and l never will be
even my own dad knew
l wasnt worth the trouble
he dumped me at that school
first chance he got
and l never heard from him again
my dad wasnt really
the fatherly type either
l doubt he was worse than mine
oh yeah
my father was an ogre
he tried to eat me
l guess l should have realized it
he bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth
l guess thats pretty bad
lt may be hard to believe
what with my obvious charm
and good looks
but people used
to think l was a monster
and for a long time l believed them
but after a while
you learn to ignore
the names people call you
and just trust who you are
you know youre okay shrek
you just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap
thanks artie
the soaps because
you stink really bad
yeah l got that
this place is filthy
l feel like a hobo
lm sorry but this
isnt working for me
everythings always about you
lts not like your attitude is helping
maybe itjust bothers you
l was voted fairest in the land
you mean in that rigged election
give me a break rapunzel rapunzel
let down thy golden extensions
ladies let go of your petty complaints
and lets work together
so l guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly
in this stinkhole until we rot
no we get inside and find out
what charmings up to
l know hes a jerk and everything
but that charming
makes me hotter than july
thats it
come on this way

with speed with might
with soft and bouncy hair
through the blistering desert

across the stormiest sea
wet
facing creatures so vile
foul
so you can gaze upon me

lm not a talking tree
but you know
a good friend once told me
just because people treat you
like a villain or an ogre

or someone you want to be
the only person standing
in your way is you

what l mean is each of you
is standing in your own way
l always wanted to play the flute
ld like to open up a spa in france
