it s a sweet trip to the candy shop
you 
you can t lie 
so tell me  puppet    where is shrek 
well    l don t know where he s not 
you don t know where shrek is 
lt wouldn t be inaccurate to assume   
   that l couldn t exactly not say that
is or isn t almost partially incorrect 
so you do know where he is 
on the contrary 
l m possibly more or less
not definitely rejecting the idea
that in no way 
with any amount of uncertainty   
stop it 
   l do not know where he shouldn t be 
lf that indeed wasn t where he isn t 
even if he wasn t not where
l knew he was  it could mean   
on the good ship lollipop
enough  shrek went off
to bring back the next heir 
he s bringing back the next heir 
no 
hook  get rid of this new   king   
but bring shrek to me 
l have something special
in mind for him 
he ll never fall for your tricks 
oh  boy 
l can t believe it  me  a king 
l knew l came from royalty  but   
   l figured everyone forgot about me 
oh  no  ln fact the king
asked for you personally 
really  wow 
but l know it s not all fun and games 
lt really is
all fun and games  actually 
sure  you have to knight a few heroes 
launch a ship or two 
by the way  make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle 
any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle 
well  l ve heard
it s harder than it looks 
this is going to be huge 
parties  princesses 
castles  princesses 
you ll be living in the lap of luxury 
the finest chefs
will wait for your order 
and fortunately 
you ll have the royal food tasters 
what do they do 
taste the food before the king eats 
to make sure it s not poisoned 
  poisoned 
  or too salty 
don t worry  your bodyguards
will keep you safe 
all of them willing
at a moment s notice
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you 
really 
the whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance 
make sure they don t die of famine 
  or plague 
  plague is bad 
the coughing  the groaning 
the festering sores 
festering sores 
you are one funny kitty cat 
what did l say 
we don t want artie
getting the wrong idea 
artie

he s not exactly king material 
when did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king 
come on  why would l do that 
besides  he ll be ten times
better at it than me 
then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him

l ve been kidnapped by a monster
who s trying to relate to me 
  artie  wait 
  come on  help  hello 
greetings  cosmic children
of the universe 
welcome to my serenity circle 
please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex 
now prepare to   
l knew l should have got that warranty 
mr  merlin 
you know this guy 
yeah  he was the school magic teacher 
until he had his nervous breakdown 
technically  l was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue 
at the request of my therapist 
and the school authorities  l retired
to the tranquility of nature
to discover my divine purpose 
can l interest anyone
in a snack or beverage 
uh  no 
sure you don t want to try
my rock au gratin 
lt s organic 
thanks  l ate a boulder on the way in 
we need directions to far far away 
  we    who said l was going with you 
l did  people are counting on you 
so don t try to weasel out of it 
lf the job s so great  you do it 
understand this  kid  no more
mr  nice guy from here on out 
that was your mr  nice guy 
yeah  and l m going to miss him 
why don t you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone 
was that a crack about ogres  you get
your royal highness to far far away   
   before l kick it there 
now  which way am l kicking 
l could tell you  but since you re
in the midst
of a self destructive rage spiral 
it would be karmically irresponsible 
self destructive    
are you going to help us or not 
most definitely  but only after you
take the journey to your soul 
l don t think so 
lt s either that
or primal scream therapy 
all right  journey to the soul 
now  all of you 
look into the fire of truth
and tell me what you see 
ooh  charades 
okay  l see a dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls 
okay  monster    go for it 
l see a rainbow pony 
excellent work  now the boy 
this is lame 
you re lame  nowjust go for it 
okay 
there s a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest 
yes  stay with it 
the dad just flew away  why did
he leave the little bird all alone 
lt s trying to fly 
but it doesn t know how to 
lt s going to fall 
proper head case you are 
really messed up 
okay  l get it  the bird s me 
my dad left  so what 
look  artie  um   
just thought l d help set the mood   
   for your big heart to heart chat 
l know what it s like
to not feel ready for something 
even ogres get scared 
you know    once in a while 
l know you want me
to be king  but l can t 
l m not cut out for it 
and l never will be 
even my own dad knew
l wasn t worth the trouble 
he dumped me at that school
first chance he got   
   and l never heard from him again 
my dad wasn t really
the fatherly type  either 
l doubt he was worse than mine 
oh  yeah 
my father was an ogre 
he tried to eat me 
l guess l should have realized it 
he bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth 
l guess that s pretty bad 
lt may be hard to believe 
what  with my obvious charm
and good looks 
but people used
to think l was a monster 
and for a long time  l believed them 
but after a while 
you learn to ignore
the names people call you
and just trust who you are 
you know    you re okay  shrek 
you just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap 
thanks  artie 
the soap s because
you stink    really bad 
yeah    l got that 
this place is filthy 
l feel like a hobo 
l m sorry  but this
isn t working for me 
everything s always about you 
lt s not like your attitude is helping 
maybe itjust bothers you
l was voted fairest in the land 
you mean in that rigged election 
give me a break    rapunzel  rapunzel   
   let down thy golden extensions   
ladies  let go of your petty complaints
and let s work together 
so l guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly
in this stinkhole until we rot 
no  we get inside and find out
what charming s up to 
l know he s a jerk and everything 
but that charming
makes me hotter than july 
that s it 
come on  this way 
rapunzel  wait 
charming  let go of her 
but why would l want to do that 
what 
say hello  ladies 
to the new queen of far far away 
rapunzel  how could you 
jealous much 
soon you ll be back
where you started 
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers 
that is  if l let you last the week 
pookie  you promised not to hurt them

now forgive us 
we have a show to put on 
shrek will be back soon 
and you ll be sorry 
sorry  
don t you realize once shrek
sets foot in far far away

artie  duck 
ready the plank 
  shrek

cowards 
what has charming done with fiona 
she s going to get what s coming to her 
and there ain t nothing
you can do to stop him 
  we ve got to save her 
  but she s so far far away 
get yourself back
to worcestershire  kid 
no  shrek  hold on  l ve got an idea 
l am a buzzing bee 
mr  merlin 
they need a spell to get them   
   l mean us  back to far far away 
forget it  l don t have that kind
of magic in me anymore 
how about a hug 
that s the best kind of magic 
please  l know you can do it 
l said forget it 
but   
what s with you 
lt s just so hard  you know 
they need to get back 
 cause their kingdom s in trouble 
 cause there s a really bad man
