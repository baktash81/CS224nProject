yes  dad 
 the fire was burning furiously
at the end of the branch 
 mowgli struck right and left
and the wolves ran howling
 with the sparks burning their fur 
 at last there were only
akela  bagheera 
 and perhaps ten wolves
that had taken mowgli s part 
 then something began
to hurt mowgli inside him
 as he d never been hurt
in his life before 
 and he caught his breath and sobbed 
 and the tears ran down his face 
  what is it  what is it    he said 
  i do not wish to leave the jungle 
and i do not know what this is 
  am i dying  bagheera   
  no  little brother   said bagheera 
  those are only tears 
such as men use 
  now  i know thou art a man
and a man s cub no longer 
  let them fall  mowgli 
  they are only tears  
 so mowgli sat and cried
as though his heart would break 
 and he d never cried
in all his life before

  i will go to men

atten tion 
something s gotta be done
about that lofty bastard 
  crikey  they re big 
  yeah  so s that bloody victorian 
hello  australia  welcome 
antiques   
no  no  no 
i reckon it took 100 000 blokes
20 years to build that 
must ve been a lot of blokes around
with crook backs 
  it s not just a monument  you know 
  it s a bloody great pile of rubble 
the pharaoh  mate   
his wife and everything
they had were buried in there 
yeah    that s man s first attempt
to beat death 
thanks  professor  can you get
your mind back on the game 
let s think about
the west australians  first attempt
to beat the bloody vics 
something s gotta be done about
that long  thin streak of pelican shit 
yeah  get him  bill 
sort the bastard right out 
all right  men  you are shortly to be
let loose on the local inhabitants   
who  you will be surprised to find 
don t look at all like you 
a fact of which they are 
no doubt  eternally grateful 
first up  beware of the local eggs 
which can be distinguished
only by their antiquity 
the local liquor  which is poisonous 
and for those of you contemplating
some horizontal refreshment   
just be warned 
because those proverbial
few moments of pleasure   
are very likely to leave you
with a legacy which is horribly painful   
difficult to cure
and may get you sent home
to face embarrassing questions
from girlfriend and or    wife 
however  i know nothing i say
is going to discourage some of you 
so i m going to hand you over
to doc morgan
who has had it all and cured it all 
he will show you how to minimise
the risk  so pay attention 
company    atten tion 
quiet 
hey  hey  come back here  gippo

out of the way 
sorry  sir

all right  let s have some quiet 
as you all know   
this morning s exercise involves
a frontal assault on an enemy trench 
the enemy being some gentlemen
from the light horse 
now  these gentlemen 
presumably because their arses
are higher from the ground than ours   
tend to assume airs of superiority 
but they won t have their horses
with them today 
so i want you to go out there
this morning 
and short of actually killing them   
show them the stuff
the infantry is made of 
load 
keep calm and keep steady 
aim high 
fire at will 
fire

  this little bloke here is snowy 
  g day  where are you from 
out in the bush 
nice to meet you all 
  has he been talking about us 
  you know frank 
he likes the sound of his own voice 
i know more about you
than your mothers 
i should hope so 
what you re telling me  sir 
correct me if i m wrong 
is the infantry attack and our attack
on the nek are just diversions 
not just diversions  major 
vitally important diversions 
tonight  25 000 british troops
will land here at suvla bay 
our attacks are to draw the turks
on us so the british can get ashore 
sorry i didn t tell you
this before  secrecy is vital 
but  sir  the nek is a fortress 
with five machine guns
at point blank range 
we ve considered that 
we ll hit them with the heaviest barrage
of the campaign
just before your men go over the top 
by the time we ve finished 
there won t be a turk within miles 
the turks can keep us pinned down
at anzac forever 
this new british landing
is our only hope 
we must do what we can
to make it succeed 
because if it does succeed 
we ll have constantinople in a week   
and knock turkey out of the war 
  so  everything s ready 
  all the guns are in position 
we start the bombardment at dawn
and stop at 0430  sharp 
that s    just over
twelve hours from now 
 your name has been selected
at random by the ladies  auxiliary  
da da da    we hope this parcel
does its bit to keep up morale  
look at this 
crikey  they chose
the measurements at random  too 
some soap  ointment  lavender water   
talcum powder  eno s   
the old ducks have sent
half a chemists  
a cook book  
what do they think it is  a picnic 
  it s the thought that counts 
  it d count more if they d think 
oh  that does it 
the bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago
sent me a bill for seven and six 
how s the time 
half past four 
  when are you going over 
  half past five 
  you going for the ridge 
  no  what s it called 
lone pine 
  what are you blokes doing 
  we re going for the nek tomorrow 
the nek  turks got machine guns
everywhere up there 
ships  guns gonna knock  em out
before we go over 
like a drink 
go on  snow  the lord won t mind 
he turns a blind eye before a battle 
he s right 
hey  you beauty  snowy 
when are they going 
right about now 
serious cases to the tent 
slightly wounded over here 
put him aside 
down to the tent with that one
