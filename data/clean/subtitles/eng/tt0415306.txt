its always been like that
me and ricky
since we were little kids man
we go together like chinese food
and chocolate pudding lets face it

that dont really go together
we go together
like cocaine and waffles
no like for instance
if i say peanut butter and
ladies right
yep
no jelly
am i right
jelly
you like to put jelly on a lady
im gonna settle this thing
lets just get ourselves
a whole mess of cocktails
get drunk and work this thing out

so i was talking to nana on saturday
and her birthdays coming up
but i dont know what to get her
shes gonna be 88
get her a coffin
hey cal im sorry
about wrecking you today

i was thinking though one time
it would be really awesome if like
you could slingshot me in for a win
yeah but okay but if you won
how am i gonna win
yeah
think about it
no i was thinking about it
i mean its not like
youre finishing 1 8th
theres nothing wrong with silver
nothing wrong with silver at all
im just kidding you man
i dont wanna win
ill just bury it down inside
bury it deep down in there
and never bring it up again
its painful and i love you
get her a gigolo
what
a guy to have sex with her
no shes gonna be 88 and
you dont stop liking sex
when youre old
well i was thinking
more along the line of
like she likes afghans and quilts
shes probably got a million of those
how many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her
none
exactly
be thoughtful glenn
dont stop
what is that
someone made a tape of
something dying or something
hey turn that crap off
whats going on
i want this music out of my head
hey turn that off
turn that off right now
why did you stop the jazz music
was it not pleasant for you
no one plays jazz here
at the pit stop okay
so why is the song on the jukebox
we keep it on there
for profiling purposes
we also got
the pet shop boys and seal
my name is jean girard
and i am a racingcar driver
just like you
except i am from formula un
i am the greatest one
in the whole world
i have been following your career
with great interest monsieur bobby
i cant understand a word
youve said the whole time
did you eat peanut butter
or something
you sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth
i think what you are hearing
is my accent
i am french
you say youre french
we no we are not french
were american
because youre in america okay
greatest country on the planet
well what have you
given the world
apart from george bush cheerios
and the thighmaster
chinese food
chinese food
thats from china
pizza
ltaly
chimichanga
mexican
really smartypants
what did french land give us
we invented democracy
existentialism
and the blowjob
those are three pretty good things
hey
well that last ones pretty cool
you know the 69 with
the head near the that bit
we came up with it
we created the missionary position
youre welcome
ricky bobby
i have come here to defeat you
oh well theres strikes two and three
right there
did you hear what he just said
well welcome to america amigo
you are fast ricky bobby
but i am faster
all right you let go of me
you formula one jazz nutjob
like the frightened baby chipmunk
you are scared by anything
that is different
i will let you go ricky
but first i want you to say
i love crepes
dont you say it ricky
these colors dont run
im not gonna say it
good
hey look frenchy
i thought about it
so why dont you go ahead
and break my arm
i do not want to break your arm
monsieur bobby
but i am a man of my word
heres the deal
hes not gonna break it
because im gonna slip
out of it right now houdini
get down you little pancake
someone get me a beer
while im here
but you have forced me to do this
you are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous
just say i love crepes
you know just to put this in there i had
a whole mess of crepes this morning
theyre like pancakes
maybe even better
are they the really thin pancakes
yeah
they are the really thin pancakes
its just a french word for them
my god i love those
put any syrups you want on them
im saying think about it
they come with cheese sometimes
yes of course
a fromagecrepe
well why didnt someone
yell that right away
you know whats in
the crepe suzette
oh i love the crepe suzette
with the sugar
and lemon juice grand marnier
sugar and lemon juice
i wish i could crawi into
one of those right now
id eat my way out from the inside
they are tasty
either way this goes could we
get some after were done
absolutely were gonna do that
so what if you just said
i love really thin pancakes
that is a fair compromise no
that is a fair compromise
very fair actually
no because then everyone
would know i really meant crepes
thats a pretty good compromise
why do you want me
to break your arm so badly
you dont understand
because you dont understand liberty
you dont understand freedom
so you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the liberty bell
hey this is just
between you and me okay
i mean forget all these other guys
but he did give you a pretty
decent out but its your call
what do you think
dont say it
yeah im not gonna say it
break it pepe le pew
as you wish
he actually did it
all right you did it back off
i didnt say it
no you did not
your injury is one
of ignorance and pride
hold it right there
mr fancy pants foreigner
you just broke my bros arm
now youre about to get tasered
say hello to dr watts

i need you all to step away
from my driver
the hell you talking about my driver
what are you doing with a gun

jean girard is my new boy
at dennit racing hes here to win us
an overallpoints championship
something you apparently
have no interest in
hes gonna usher in a new era
mr dennit with all due respect
and remember
im saying with all due respect
that idea aint worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on
thats good thats good fun
thats good fun ricky
but that doesnt bother me anymore
because jean is the future
ricky the past
so jean introduce me
to your new teammates
everybody
this is my husband gregory
what
see you at the track
did he just say husband
sweet lord dennit hired a gay
frenchman as your teammate
the rooms starting to spin reai fast
because of gayness
cal i love you
ricky ricky oh god
fans and nascar everyone is talking
about this new driver jean girard
lets find out a little bit more about him
from our reporter davey wesling
talented eccentric dominating
these are the words
that define jean girard
before each race jean girard spends
time with his worldclass horses
who are also gay
jeans days are filled
with sundrenched walks
with his beloved husband gregory
though gregory is
no stayathome spouse
hes a worldclass trainer
of german shepherds
rolfe the nazi boyfriend
up on top
very nice very nice
only time will tell if jeans foray
into nas car
will end up in victory lane
well kiss my ass on sunday
lucius what the hell is going on
the man can drive
and check out his crew chief
over there
won the nobel prize
for physics back in 93
ladies and gentlemen
that is a new track record
as it stands now jean girard is sitting
on the pole which is of course
a statement of fact
and in no way a comment
on the drivers sexuai orientation
put a smile on your face
thats the future of dennit racing
that make you happy
im just thrilled mr dennit
i love seeing some french guy
break my record
while i got my arm wrapped up
like a fricking gordita

everyone knows that
i mean thats just life
look at don shula
legendary coach
look at that asian guy
who holds the world record
for eating all those hot dogs
in a row
look at rue mcclanahan
from the golden girls
all three people
all great champions all loved
do you wanna know why i think
that you should race again
sure why
okay its because
its what you love ricky
lt is who you were born to be
and here you sit thinking
well ricky bobby is not a thinker
ricky bobby is a driver
he is a doer
and thats what you need to do
you dont need to think
you need to drive
you need speed you need to go out
there and you need to rev your engine
you need to fire it up
you need to grab hold of the line
between speed and chaos
and you need to wrestle it
to the ground like a demon cobra
and then when that fear rises up
in your belly you use it
and you know that fear is powerful
because it has been there
for billions of years and it is good
and you use it and you ride it
you ride it like a skeleton horse
through the gates of hell
and then you win you win
you dont win for anybody else
you win for you you know why
because a man takes what he wants
he takes it all
and youre a man arent you
arent you
susan ive never heard you
talk like that
are we about to get it on
because im as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now
