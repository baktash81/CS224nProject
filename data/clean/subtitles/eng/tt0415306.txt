that was a hell of a race today 
 shake and bake in full effect 
 it s always been like that 
me and ricky 
since we were little kids  man 
we go together like chinese food
and chocolate pudding  let s face it 
yeah  but those are two things
that don t really go together 
we go together
like cocaine and waffles 
no  like  for instance 
if i say peanut butter and    
 ladies  right 
 yep 
 no  jelly 
 am i right 
 jelly 
 you like to put jelly on a lady 
i m gonna settle this thing 
let s just get ourselves   
   a whole mess of cocktails 
get drunk and work this thing out 
 work this thing out 
 that s right 
so i was talking to nana on saturday 
and her birthday s coming up   
   but i don t know what to get her 
she s gonna be 88 
get her a coffin 
hey  cal  i m sorry
about wrecking you today 
 i mean  but that was for the team 
 no  that s cool  that s cool  i know 
i was thinking  though  one time   
   it would be really awesome if  like 
you could slingshot me in for a win 
yeah  but   okay  but if you won   
    how am i gonna win 
 yeah 
 think about it 
 no  i was thinking about it 
i mean  it s not like
you re finishing 1 8th 
 there s nothing wrong with silver 
 nothing wrong with silver at all 
i m just kidding you  man 
i don t wanna win 
i ll just bury it down inside 
bury it deep down in there 
and never bring it up again 
it s painful  and i love you 
get her a gigolo 
 what 
 a guy to have sex with her 
no  she s gonna be 88 and    
you don t stop liking sex
when you re old 
well  i was thinking
more along the line of    
 like  she likes afghans and quilts 
 she s probably got a million of those 
how many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her 
 none 
 exactly 
be thoughtful  glenn 
don t stop 
what is that 
someone made a tape of
something dying or something 
hey  turn that crap off 
what s going on 
i want this music out of my head 
hey  turn that off 
turn that off right now 
why did you stop the jazz music 
was it not pleasant for you 
no one plays jazz here
at the pit stop  okay 
so why is the song on the jukebox 
we keep it on there
for profiling purposes 
we also got
the pet shop boys and seal 
my name is jean girard   
   and i am a racing car driver
just like you   
   except i am from formula un 
i am the greatest one
in the whole world 
i have been following your career
with great interest  monsieur bobby 
i can t understand a word
you ve said the whole time 
did you eat peanut butter
or something 
you sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth 
i think what you are hearing
is my accent 
i am french 
you say you re french 
we  no  we are not french 
we re american 
because you re in america  okay 
greatest country on the planet 
well  what have you
given the world   
   apart from george bush  cheerios 
and the thighmaster 
 chinese food 
 chinese food 
that s from china 
 pizza 
 ltaly 
 chimichanga 
 mexican 
really  smarty pants 
what did french land give us 
we invented democracy 
existentialism   
   and the blowjob 
 those are three pretty good things 
 hey 
well  that last one s pretty cool 
you know  the 69 with
the head near the   that bit 
we came up with it 
we created the missionary position 
 you re welcome 
 ricky bobby   
   i have come here to defeat you 
oh  well  there s strikes two and three
right there 
did you hear what he just said 
well  welcome to america  amigo 
you are fast  ricky bobby   
   but i am faster 
all right  you let go of me 
you formula one jazz nutjob 
like the frightened baby chipmunk   
   you are scared by anything
that is different 
i will let you go  ricky   
   but first i want you to say 
  i love crepes   
don t you say it  ricky 
these colors don t run 
 i m not gonna say it 
 good 
hey  look  frenchy 
i thought about it 
so why don t you go ahead
and break my arm 
i do not want to break your arm 
monsieur bobby   
   but i am a man of my word 
here s the deal 
he s not gonna break it   
   because i m gonna slip
out of it right now  houdini 
get down  you little pancake 
someone get me a beer
while i m here 
but you have forced me to do this 
you are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous 
just say    i love crepes   
you know  just to put this in there  i had
a whole mess of crepes this morning 
they re like pancakes 
maybe even better 
 are they the really thin pancakes 
 yeah 
they are the really thin pancakes 
it s just a french word for them 
 my god  i love those 
 put any syrups you want on them 
 i m saying  think about it 
 they come with cheese sometimes 
yes  of course 
a fromage crepe 
well  why didn t someone
yell that right away 
you know what s in
the crepe suzette 
 oh  i love the crepe suzette 
 with the sugar   
    and lemon juice  grand marnier 
 sugar and lemon juice 
i wish i could crawi into
one of those right now 
 i d eat my way out from the inside 
 they are tasty 
either way this goes  could we
get some after we re done 
 absolutely  we re gonna do that 
 so  what if you just said 
  i love really thin pancakes   
that is a fair compromise  no 
 that is a fair compromise 
 very fair  actually 
no  because then everyone
would know i really meant crepes 
that s a pretty good compromise 
why do you want me
to break your arm so badly 
you don t understand
because you don t understand liberty 
you don t understand freedom 
so you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the liberty bell 
hey  this is just
between you and me  okay 
i mean  forget all these other guys 
but he did give you a pretty
decent out  but it s your call 
what do you think 
 don t say it 
 yeah  i m not gonna say it 
break it  pepe le pew 
as you wish 
 he actually did it 
 all right  you did it  back off 
 i didn t say it 
 no  you did not 
your injury is one
of ignorance and pride 
hold it right there 
mr  fancy pants foreigner 
you just broke my bro s arm 
now you re about to get tasered 
 say hello to dr  watts 
 get him  cal 
i need you all to step away   
   from my driver 
the hell you talking about    my driver   
what are you doing with a gun 
don t you worry about my gun  ricky 
jean girard is my new boy
at dennit racing  he s here to win us   
   an overall points championship 
something you apparently   
   have no interest in 
he s gonna usher in a new era 
mr  dennit  with all due respect  
and remember 
i m saying    with all due respect   
  that idea ain t worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on 
that s good  that s good fun 
that s good fun  ricky   
   but that doesn t bother me anymore
because jean is the future   
   ricky  the past 
so  jean  introduce me
to your new teammates 
everybody 
this is my husband  gregory 
what

talented  eccentric  dominating 
these are the words
that define jean girard 
before each race  jean girard spends
time with his world class horses   
   who are also gay 
jean s days are filled
with sun drenched walks   
   with his beloved husband  gregory 
though gregory is
no stay at home spouse 
he s a world class trainer
of german shepherds 
rolfe  the nazi boyfriend 
up on top

ladies and gentlemen 
that is a new track record 
as it stands now  jean girard is sitting
on the pole  which is  of course   
   a statement of fact
and in no way a comment   
   on the driver s sexuai orientation 
put a smile on your face

 that make you happy 
 i m just thrilled  mr  dennit

great colonel sanders

monsieur bobby

good thing about coming to the races   
   and that is
the vibrations from the cars 
oh  i love when them cars whiz by 
can feel the motor   
   running up my legs 
ricky bobby  who never met
a sponsor he wouldn t push   
   has a fig newton sticker
on his windshield 
think nas car will
black flag him for that 
he sold the windshield 
this sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient  but i love fig newtons 
ricky bobby started this race
in the back   
   but he s making no friends
on the way to the front 
i m all about getting to the front tonight 
lucius  let s go  let s move it

this is not good 
 ricky

ricky 
peaches and cream 
the car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke 
ricky bobby appears to be okay

he found that wheelchair
in the hallway 
his paralysis is
entirely psychosomatic 
but we all need to go along with this 
because he s in a delicate state 
so when you say psychosomatic 
you mean  like   
   he could start a fire
with his thoughts 
no  not at all 
lt means it s all in his mind 
i m saying  sometimes you get a knock
on the head  you get speciai powers 
lt happens all the time

   after maybe the first day 
within the first hour  i gave that up

it s time to be mature about this
and just face facts 
i bought myself
a hundred thousand dollar   
   handicap accessible van   
   with the captain s chairs and the dvd
plasma screens in the back for the kids 
 you all paid up on that 
 yeah  that s all paid in full 
it s parked out there

   is i just gotta have a sit down
with carley and just let her know   
   that it s okay for her to seek
the comfort of other men 
because she s gotta run wild  you
can t keep something like that back 
hold on  man  hold

ls your name  by chance 
ricky bobby 
hey  screw you  man 
i got nothing because of you 
 i hate you 
 hey  ricky 
i am on fire  i am on fire 
susan 
and so then i got a marketing
job with nascar 
 really 
 yeah  it s great  it s great 
well  gosh  you look fantastic 
 thank you 
 i mean  you ve always looked good 
i mean  i m just   i m happy for you 
thank you 
but what about you 
how have you been 
what have you been doing 
well  they want me to race at talladega
next weekend  but i m not gonna do it 
because i m done 
i m done with the racing  with driving 
 why would you do that 
 because i ve really moved on 
i ve sent in my application to
the reai world   
   so i m hoping to hear back 
i m putting a lot of my eggs into
that basket  the mtv basket 
i m also thinking about getting a gun
and dealing crack 
being a crack dealer  but not like
a mean crack dealer  but like a    
you know  like a nice one 
just kind of friendly  like    hey   
   what s up  guys 
you want some crack   
i m just waiting on those two things
to kind of flesh themselves out 
you know what  ricky 
i have kept my mouth shut
for a really  really long time 
and i just don t think that i can
keep it shut anymore 
i just have to tell you that i think
you are making a big mistake 
 really 
 yes 
why is it that you always fall
for people who leave you 
have you noticed that 
like carley and your dad
and your sponsors 
and you always have
to prove yourself  wh   
well  you gotta listen
to me here  okay 
you gotta win to get love 
everyone knows that 
i mean  that s just life 
look at don shula 
legendary coach 
look at that asian guy
who holds the world record   
   for eating all those hot dogs
in a row 
look at rue mcclanahan
from the golden girls 
all three people 
all great champions  all loved 
do you wanna know why i think
that you should race again 
sure  why 
okay  it s because
it s what you love  ricky 
lt is who you were born to be 
and here you sit  thinking 
well  ricky bobby is not a thinker 
ricky bobby is a driver 
he is a doer 
and that s what you need to do 
you don t need to think 
you need to drive 
you need speed  you need to go out
there  and you need to rev your engine 
you need to fire it up 
you need to grab hold of the line
between speed and chaos   
   and you need to wrestle it
to the ground like a demon cobra 
and then  when that fear rises up
in your belly  you use it   
   and you know that fear is powerful
because it has been there   
   for billions of years  and it is good 
and you use it  and you ride it 
you ride it like a skeleton horse
through the gates of hell   
   and then you win  you win 
you don t win for anybody else 
you win for you  you know why 
because a man takes what he wants 
he takes it all 
and you re a man  aren t you 
aren t you 
susan  i ve never heard you
talk like that 
are we about to get it on 
because i m as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now 
 this is awesome 
 yes  it is 
 are you climbing on the table now 
 yes  sir 
i can t believe this 
this is like that whitesnake video
where the giri crawls on
