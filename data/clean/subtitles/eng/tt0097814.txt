which  uh  may or may not
be passing over our area soon 
i ll let you know as soon as we have
more information available 
but  fiirst  here s the weather forecast 
skies are clearing up 
thanks to a high pressure front
moving in from the mountains 
mild winds will be blowing in from the west   
  pushing the clouds out by this evening 
   bee buzzing 
there ll be a beautiful
full moon lighting up the skies   
so  if you ve been
planning something special 
tonight might be the night 
tomorrow also looks good
with clear skies and sun 
 clicks off radio 
  mornin

 bird chirps 
  jiji  wake up   tonight s the night 
  hmm 
hey  mom  oh 
hi  miss dora  hey  mom  it s gonna
be clear tonight 
and  guess what 
the radio says there ll be a full moon

again without asking 
don t worry  he doesn t mind 
please excuse me  miss dora 
mom  it s a perfect midnight
for me to leave home

full moon might be on a cloudy night 
and  i want to leave
on the perfect midnight 
huh  but  kiki    wait 
ohh   
 gasps 
uhh   
 sighs 
my  oh  my  what s this all about 
it s one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13   
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training 
  your little baby is 13 
   sighs 
my goodness  but time flies so quickly 
i know  she seems so young
to be leaving home now 
i remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town 
a little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick 
and  i was certain
she was much too young
to hold such an importantjob   
as resident witch 
   chuckles 
  yes  but i could fly  kiki
barely knows how to do that 
and  i have had no time
to teach her how to mix potions like me 
hmm  young people are all the same 
they all want to do something different 
but  i hope  you at least get to teach her   
  the potion that cures my rheumatism 
   laughs 
hurry up  we always said
we d leave on the perfect night  didn t we 
uh uh  our plan was that
we would stick around for
another month and play it safe 
i liked that plan 
and  if we put it off for a
month  and i find some wonderful
boyfriend  then what ll we do 
  uh oh 
  come on  jiji

thought i was a boy 
well  it s the way
you re dressed and all 
 groans  tell me  what kind of a boy
has these legs  mister 
bye  ladies  take care now 
  you get along with the crows 
  yep  we ve become real close friends 
wow 
  hello  everybody  i m home again 
   cawing 
  good afternoon  um  i wanna say i m sorry 
   cawing 
i m not an egg stealer  and i didn t mean to
cause you any problems 
why don t you go inside 
and i ll go get some water 
okay 
 gasps 
oh 
  like it 
  yes 
i have to say i became inspired after
the first time we met 
but    i really haven t got the face right 
i ve been waiting for you to come back
so i can try again 
  you mean that s me 
  sure is 
you know  you d make
my life a lot easier if you d model for me 
but i m not very beautiful 
what do you want me to do that for 
 laughing 
come on  kiki  you have got a great face 
you re very pretty 
now  don t you be nervous 
sit down over here 
raise your chin up a little 
look straight ahead  now  don t move 
painting and magical powers
seem very much the same 
sometimes i m unable to paint a thing 
you mean it 
then what  what happens 
kiki  please don t move 
it s hard to draw a moving target 
without even thinking about it 
i used to be able to fly 
now i m trying to look inside
myself to find out how i did it 
  but i just can t fiigure it out 
  you know  could be you re
working at it too hard 
maybe you shouldjust take a break 
yeah  but still  if i can t fly   
then stop trying 
take long walks  look at the scenery 
doze off at noon 
don t even think about flying 
and then  pretty soon 
you ll be flying again 
  you think my problems will   
  go away  that s right 
it s gonna be fine  i promise 
when i was your age 
i d already decided to become an artist 
i loved to paint so much 
i d paint all day until
i fell asleep right at my easel 
and then one day 
for some reason  i just
couldn t paint anymore 
i tried and tried 
but nothing i did seemed any good 
they were copies of paintings
i d seen somewhere before   
and not very good copies either 
i just felt like i d lost my ability 
that sounds like me 
it s exactly the same 
but then i found the answer 
you see  i hadn t
fiigured out what or why
i wanted to paint 
  i had to discover my own style 
  mm hmm 
when you fly  you rely on what s
inside of you  don t you 
uh huh  we fly with our spirit 
trusting your spirit 
yes  yes  that s exactly
what i m talkin  about 
that same spirit
is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake 
but we each need to find
our own inspiration  kiki 
sometimes it s not easy 
i guess i never gave much thought to why
i wanted to do this 
i got so caught up
in all the training and stuff 
maybe i have to find my own inspiration 
but am i ever gonna find it 
and is it worth all the trouble 
well  for example 
there were quite a few times   
when i thought of painting something
over that painting 
   kiki  but it ended up being so great 
  so i guess it s worth it 
today when i saw you
i thought  i wanna paint 
  you ve got such a great face 
  that s why i came 
 laughing 
hey  well  it s better than
you cleaning my floor again 
  let s turn out the lights and go to sleep 
  okay 
sorry about taking your bed from you 
aw  no problem 
  so you really think i ll fly again 
  sure 
you ll just have to wait
for the right inspiration to come along 
  you understand 
  uh huh 
mmm

  hey  let me tell you about
when she first came to town 
  you live around these parts 
 skipped item nr  685 
 woman 
   one day   
   the whole world looks   
  like an open page   
  and you ve been dancing
as fast as you can   
   with a smile on your   
  face   
  and then the earth and the sky   
   they all fiit together   
  and carry me away
as light as a feather   
   chase the clouds from the ground   
  in the big blue sky   
  don t wanna watch it all go by   
  so i m gonna fly   
  higher than   
  i ever could   
  feel the wind blow through my hair   
  feel the sun dance with the moon   
  and my feet can t stay   
   on the ground any longer   
   with every leap of faith   
  i feel a little stronger   
   wanna swing from a star   
  in the big blue sky   
  don t wanna watch it all go by   
  so i m gonna fly   
  and see for myself what it looks like   
  from up there   
  and taste the stardust in my mouth   
   chase the clouds   
   until they disappear   
  and if i can make   
  just one life better   
  bring a smile to
your face when you re
under the weather   
  and i m feelin like i ve fiinally
found my home   
  i ll plant the seeds
and watch them grow   
  and i m gonna   
  fly   
  fly   
  fly   
  fly
