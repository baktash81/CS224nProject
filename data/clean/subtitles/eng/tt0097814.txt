sighs
my oh my whats this all about
its one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training
your little baby is 13
sighs
my goodness but time flies so quickly
i know she seems so young
to be leaving home now
i remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town
a little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick
and i was certain
she was much too young
to hold such an importantjob
as resident witch
chuckles
yes but i could fly kiki
barely knows how to do that
and i have had no time
to teach her how to mix potions like me
hmm young people are all the same
they all want to do something different
but i hope you at least get to teach her
the potion that cures my rheumatism
laughs
hurry up we always said
wed leave on the perfect night didnt we
uhuh our plan was that
we would stick around for
another month and play it safe
i liked that plan

month and i find some wonderful
boyfriend then whatll we do

well its the way
youre dressed and all
groans tell me what kind of a boy
has these legs mister
bye ladies take care now
you get along with the crows
yep weve become real close friends
wow
hello everybody im home again
cawing
good afternoon um i wanna say im sorry
cawing
im not an egg stealer and i didnt mean to
cause you any problems
why dont you go inside
and ill go get some water
okay
gasps
oh
like it
yes
i have to say i became inspired after
the first time we met
but i really havent got the face right
ive been waiting for you to come back
so i can try again
you mean thats me
sure is
you know youd make
my life a lot easier if youd model for me
but im not very beautiful
what do you want me to do that for
laughing
come on kiki you have got a great face
youre very pretty
now dont you be nervous
sit down over here
raise your chin up a little
look straight ahead now dont move
painting and magical powers
seem very much the same
sometimes im unable to paint a thing
you mean it
then what what happens
kiki please dont move
its hard to draw a moving target
without even thinking about it
i used to be able to fly
now im trying to look inside
myself to find out how i did it
but i just cant fiigure it out
you know could be youre
working at it too hard
maybe you shouldjust take a break
yeah but still if i cant fly
then stop trying
take long walks look at the scenery
doze off at noon
dont even think about flying
and then pretty soon
youll be flying again
you think my problems will
go away thats right
its gonna be fine i promise
when i was your age
id already decided to become an artist
i loved to paint so much
id paint all day until
i fell asleep right at my easel
and then one day
for some reason i just
couldnt paint anymore
i tried and tried
but nothing i did seemed any good
they were copies of paintings
id seen somewhere before
and not very good copies either
i just felt like id lost my ability
that sounds like me
its exactly the same
but then i found the answer
you see i hadnt
fiigured out what or why
i wanted to paint
i had to discover my own style
mmhmm
when you fly you rely on whats
inside of you dont you
uhhuh we fly with our spirit
trusting your spirit
yes yes thats exactly
what im talkin about
that same spirit
is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake
but we each need to find
our own inspiration kiki
sometimes its not easy
i guess i never gave much thought to why
i wanted to do this
i got so caught up
in all the training and stuff
maybe i have to find my own inspiration
but am i ever gonna find it
and is it worth all the trouble
well for example
there were quite a few times
when i thought of painting something
over that painting
kiki but it ended up being so great
so i guess its worth it
today when i saw you
i thought i wanna paint
youve got such a great face
thats why i came
laughing
hey well its better than
you cleaning my floor again
lets turn out the lights and go to sleep
okay
sorry about taking your bed from you
aw no problem
so you really think ill fly again
sure
youll just have to wait
for the right inspiration to come along
you understand
uhhuh

and carry me away
as light as a feather

higher than
i ever could
feel the wind blow through my hair
feel the sun dance with the moon
and my feet cant stay
on the ground any longer
with every leap of faith
i feel a little stronger
wanna swing from a star
in the big blue sky
dont wanna watch it all go by
so im gonna fly
and see for myself what it looks like
from up there
and taste the stardust in my mouth
chase the clouds
until they disappear
and if i can make
just one life better
bring a smile to
your face when youre
under the weather
and im feelinlike ive fiinally
found my home
ill plant the seeds
and watch them grow
and im gonna
fly
fly
