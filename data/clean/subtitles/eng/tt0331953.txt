and asks if he wants to go in the jungle 
he says   yes  why not  
and go 
and whereas in the jungle    
lights are removed from the club    
start to put all sorts of questions    
believes that if local stories

he and i do not really worry 
she climbs on and starts  and his job 
but something does not seem out of place colette 
but i do not see anything 
it was dark and i and sees the job 
but then  boom 
a lightning illuminates the island and
at that moment    
coletti looks around and sees that there
only that it was in the middle of the cemetery    
and that others were watching him    
but sees that making love to a corpse 
one cold  dirty    
and from the pit 
and they say that    
phil coletti he went calm
hut attendant tombs    
has found a machete    
and cut off hundreds of pieces members 
and they say took that same machete    
and has cut his own dick and
ran screaming through the jungles 
no one had seen him after that 
but from then on    
phil coletti was known as    
machete phil
