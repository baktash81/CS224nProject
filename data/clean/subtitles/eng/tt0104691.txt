south out of fort carillon   
to war against
the british 
and i m helpin  raise new york s
militia to fill the crown s levy 
and the people here are
gonna join in that fight 
we ll see in the morning 
where re you boys headin  
we ll trap over the fall 
winter in can tuck ee 
find a delaware speaking
woman for uncas 
she will say   you are the one  
bear him many children 
then you can have a boy like me 
never 
you re too strong 
  turn me old too fast 
  that s what he s doin  to his mama 
john cameron 
thank you for your hospitality 
mohawk got no quarrel
with les francais 
traded furs with
les francais 
now les francais
bring huron  ottawa 
abenaki on to mohawk land 
now mohawk will fight
les francais and huron 
i speak for the twin rivers
mohawk of the six nations 
his majesty  king george ll 
is very grateful for your support 
  how far up the valley 
  up to fort william henry 
that s two nights
and abit from here 
  should be enough to remind you that france is our enemy 
  france is you r enemy 
and while we re at your fort 
what if the french attack our homes 
  what then  lieutenant 
  for your homes 
for king  for country 
that s why you men
ought to join this fight 
you do what you want
with your owns calp 
do not be tellin  us
what we ought to do with ours 
you call yourself a patriot 
a loyal subject to the crown 
i do not call myself
subject to much a tall 
i agree with some of what
nathaniel and john say 
but i believe england s
still our sovereign 
i m stayin  on my farm 
any man who goes  his family s welcome
to fort up with us till he comes back 
boys  my sense of it is   
we have enough here
to fill the county levy 
and it s a fight
we ought to make 
but first we gotta
get terms from generai webb 
we ll go to albany 
attention 
there ll be no conditions attached
to service in the british army 
help my man outside
with the baggage 
if they re not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes   
if the french
attack the settlements 
no colonial militia
is going to fort william henry 
they will report
or be pressed into service 
  any of the boys worth havin  can disappear 
  they will be found 
  where does that leave you 
  those men will be found 
i cannot imagine his majesty 
in all his benevolence 
would ever object to his
loyal american subjects   
defending their hearth and home 
their women and children 
does that mean they
will be granted leave   
to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked 
of course 
you got yourself
a colonial militia  general 
major duncan heyward
reporting  sir 
enroute to fort william henry
and bearing dispatches 
en route to fort william henry
and bearing dispatches 
  safe journey  i trust 
  yes 
and i didn t experience anything
so surprising from bristol to albany   
as that that
i witnessed here today 
and what was that 
the crown negotiating
the terms of service 
well  now  one has to reason with these
colonials to get them to do anything 
tiring  isn t it 
but that s the lay of the land 
i thought british policy is
 make the world england   sir 
i see you re to serve with the 35th
regiment of foot at fort william henry   
under colonel munro 
i ll be marching the 60th
to fort edward 
explain to the major 
he has little to fear   
from this general marquis de montcalm
in the first place 
and therefore scant need
of the colonial militia in the second 
because the french
haven t the nature for war 
their latinate
voluptuousness   
combines with their
gallic laziness 
and the result is  they d rathereat and
make love with their faces than fight 
might linquire if generai webb has
heard from colonei munro s daughters 
i was to rendezvous with them in albany
and escort them to the fort  sir 
you there  uh 
what does munro call you 
the scotsman has sent you   
one of his mohawk allies
to guide you 
magua 
the scotsman s daughters   
are at the poltroon s house 
a company of the 60th
will accompany you   
and magua will
show you the way 
dawn  at the encampment 
6 00 a  m  sharp  see to it you re there 
i ll take him for you  sir 
cora 
duncan 
  how long have you been in albany 
  for days and days 
  and your self  
  just arrived 
by god  it s good
to see you 
i don t know
what to say  duncan 
alice and i have depended upon you
and respected you   
since we were
all children 
i truly wish they did 
but my feelings don t 
don t go beyond friendship 
don t you see 
respect and friendship 
isn t that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married 
and all else
may grow in time 
  some say that s the way of it 
  some 
  cousin eugenie  my father 
  well  then  cora 
in my heart i know 
once we re joined   
we ll be the most
marvelous couple in london 
i m certain of that 
so why not let those
whom you trust  your father 
help settle
what s best for you 
in view of your indecision 
you should rely on their judgment 
and mine 
will you consider that 
please consider that 
yes 
  yes  i will 
  duncan 
by god  you ve grown up 
  we leave in the morning 
  yes  miss 
is han t sleep tonight  what an
adventure  have you seen the red man 
a few 
i absolutely cannot wait
to return to portman square 
having been
to the wilderness 
  it s so exciting  duncan 
  itcan be dangerous 
nonsense 
papa wouldn t have sent for us 
  would you like some tea 
  yes  thank you 
alice 
  can we rest soon 
  absolutely

scout  we must stop soon 
  women are tired

excuse me 
what did you say 
magua said 
understand english very well 
make ready  aim 
ready 
aim  flank right 
aah 
no  duncan 
in case your aim s
any better than your judgment 
aah 
your wounded should try
walkin  on back to albany 
they ll never make
a passage north 
  ahh 
  stop it  stop it 
  we need them to get out 
  why  she loosing the horses 
  why don t you ask him 
  too easy to track 
they ll be heard
for miles 
find your self a musket 
we were headed
to fort william henry 
we ll take you
as far as the fort 
we re walkin 
out of here fast 
unless all of you d rather wait for
the next huron war party to come by 
scout  i d like to
thank you for your help 
  how much further is it 
  night and a bit 
  appears we re well away from them 
  maybe 
maybe they ain t alone 
that huron captain back there 
the guide  he s a mohawk 
no mohawk  he s huron 
what reason did he have
to murder the girl 
  what 
  the dark haired one 
miss cora munro  murder her 
he never set eyes on her before today 
she s only been here a week 
blood vengeance 
a reproach or insult 
of course not 
how is it
you were so nearby 
came across the war party 
tracked  em 
then you re assigned
to fort william henry 
  nope 
  fort edward then 
headin  west to can tuck ee 
there is a waron 
how is it you are heading west 
well  we kind of face to the north 
and real sudden like  turn left 
i though tall our colonial scouts
were in the militia 
the militia is fighting
the french in the north 
i ain t your scout 
and we sure ain t in no damn militia 
ottawa  two francais 
what did you say 
mirrors 
tools  the clothes 
everything was inside 
they didn t take anything 
they were movin  fast 
a war party 
let us look after them 
leave them 
who ever they are 
though they re strangers 
they re at least entitled
to a christian burial 
  they can t be left behind 
  let us go  miss 
i will not 
i ve seen the face of war before  sir 
but i ve not seen war
made upon women and children 
nor most as cruel
as your indifference 
miss munro 
they re not strangers 
and theystayasthey lay 
why didn t you
bury these people 
anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign   
we passed that way 
you knew them well 
you were acting for our benefit 
and i apologize 
i misunderstood you 
well  that s to be expected 
  my father warned me about 
  your father 
chingachgook 
he warned me about people like you 
oh  he did 
  no 
why did they turn back 
burial ground 
where is your real family 
they buried my ma and pa
and my sisters 
chingachgook found me with two french
trappers  raised me up as his own 
i m sorry 
i do not remember 
i wasn t but one or two 
how did you
learn english 
my father sent uncas and i to reverend
whee lock s school when i wasten   
sowe would know
both worlds 
why were those people living
in this defenseless place 
after seven years indentured service
in virginia  they headed out here   
 cause the frontier s the only land
available to poor people 
out here they re
be holden to none 
not livin 
by another s leave 
their name was cameron 
john and alexandra cameron 
my father s people say that
at the birth of the sun   
and of his brother the moon 
their mother died 
so the sun gave
to the earth her body 
from which was
to spring all life 
and he drew forth from
her breast the stars 
the stars he threw into the night sky
to remind him ofher soul 
so there s
the camerons  monument 
my folks  too  i guess 
you are right  mr  poe 
we do not understand
what is happening here 
and it s not
as i imagined it would be 
thinking of it
in boston and london 
  sorry to disappoint you 
  no  on the contrary 
it is more deeply
stirring to my blood   
than any imagining
could possibly have been 
top of the next ridge 
the fort s down hill of it 
the men of the regiment
will fetch water from the lake 
build fires  and provide
every comfort and desire 
i can t wait to see papa 
aah 
fire 
fire 
aah 
aah 
open up 
  i m major duncan heyward 
  captain jeffrey beams 
  didn t expect you to make it through 
  let s go to munro 
hello  boys 
  nathaniel 
uncas  thought you and
nathaniel weren t joinin  up 
we didn t 
papa  papa 
alice  cora 
why are you here 
and where the hell
are my reinforcements 
get mr  phelps 
told you to stay away 
why did you disobey me  girls 
  when  how  i 
  my letter 
  there was none  there was no letter 
  what 
  i sent three couriers to webb 
  one called magua arrived 
  he delivered no message 
  does webb not even know we are besieged 
sir  webb has no idea  and he certainly
does not know to send reinforcements 
what happened to you 
  on the george road  attacked 
  we re fine 
are you all right 
  yes 
  what will happen here  papa 
  we ll be all right  girl 
  this magua led us in to it 
eighteen killed  these men came
to our aid  they guided us here 
thank you 
do you need anything 
  help our selves to a few horns from your powder stores 
  some food 
indebted to you 
  miss cora  how are you 
  hello  mr  phelps 
mrs  mccann will get some
dry clothes for you 
thank you 
go with your sister 
alice 
it ll be all right 
girl 
it ll be all right 
might i inquire after
the situation  sir 
given that i ve seen the french
engineering from the ridge above 
the situation is  his guns are bigger
than mine and he has more of them 
we keep our heads down while his
troops dig 30yards of trench a day 
when those trenches are 200yards
from the fort and within range 
he ll bring in
his 15 inch mortars 
lob explosive rounds
over our walls and pound us to dust 
they look to be
300 yards out 
if they re digging 30yards a day 
you have three days 
damn  damn 
this man here can make a run
straight through to webb 
three days is not enough time to get
to albany and back with reinforcements 
webb s not in albany  he marched
the 60th to fort edward two days ago 
webb is at edward 
  yes  sir 
  that s only 12 miles away 
he could have reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow 
you  sir  pick your man 
major heyward will provide adiversion 
i ll draft outadis patch  captain beams
will seek you out and give it to you later 
somethin  else 
cameron s cabin  frontier cabin 
came upon it yesterday 
it was burnt out  everyone murdered 
it was ottawa 
allied to the french 
aye  so 
it was a war party 
that means they re gonna be attackin 
up and down the frontier 
thank you  sir 
people here  mohawks  settlers 
have family out there 
that ll be all  sir 
things were done 
nobody was spared 
those considerations are subordinate
to the interests of the crown 
a terrible feature of war here
in the americas  major heyward 
best keep your eye fixed on our duty 
to defeat france 
that hangs on
a courier to webb 
for my children are the children
of the true faith 
my friendship and esteem
is boundless 
i will give you
three oxen for a feast 
and tomorrow  i will sing
the war song with you   
at the great council fire 
magua  how are things
with your english friends 
we re at one  join us 
hear what he
has to tell us 
the english
war chief  webb 
goes to fort edward
with 60th regiment 
he does not know that my father s army
attacks fort william henry 
magua was successful 
the other two couriers
died in the forest 
by now  munro would know his
dispatch did not get through 
  he ll send another 
  grey hair will try 
four or five 
including two women  entered the fort 
the grey hair s children
were under magua s knife 
they escaped 
they will be
under it again 
why do you hate
the grey hair  magua 
when the grey hair is dead 
magua will eat his heart 
before he dies 
magua will put his children
under the knife   
so the grey hair
will know   
his seed
is wiped out forever 
miss cora 
gentleman lookin  for you 
miss munro 
hello 
may i 
  it will seep  and then it s going to draw 
  thank you  miss 
 bout done holdin  hands
with miss munro 
we got some work to do 
what are you
looking at  sir 
i m looking at you  miss 
munro refused to believe
what happened 
he does not even
want to hear it 
well  he s gonna have to 
get to get her
by the west bastion 
ian  sharitarish 
ongewasgone and william 
tight weave 
silk 
another 40 yards 
fire 
aim  and fire 
wheel to the right 
on center  march 
  halt 
  ready 
set  fire 
aah 
and how am i to know
it wasn t a raid by common thieves 
the cabin was attacked bya war party
fighting with the french 
they re sweeping south down the frontier
attacking farms and mohawk villages 
  all the men are stuck here 
  i need proof more convincing than this man s opinion   
before i weaken the fort s defenses
by releasing the militia 
chingachgook s of the
same opinion about the raid 
taken together  that s gospel 
your fort will stand or fall
depending on webb s reinforcements 
not the presence
of the colonials 
i judge military matters here 
not you 
your judgment is not more important
than their right   
under agreement with webb
to defend their farms and families 
major heyward was there  he was
at john cameron s  he saw what it was 
what exactly did you see  major 
i saw nothing that would lead me to the
conclusion it was other than a raid   
by savages bent on thievery 
  you re a liar 
  major 
montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman  not a butcher 
easy for you to suppose  it s their women
and children alone on the farms  not yours 
  you for get yourself  sir 
  we re not forgettin  webb s promise 
british promises are honored 
and the militia will not be released 
because i need more definite proof
than this man s word 
nathaniel s word s been good on this
frontier a longtime before you got here 
this meeting is over 
the militia stays 
does the rule of english law
no longer govern 
has it been replaced
by absolutism 
if english law cannot be trusted  people
would do better making peace with the french 
  that is sedition 
  that is the truth 
i ll have you beaten
from this fort 
anyone fomenting on advocating the leaving of
fort william henry will be hung for sedition 
anyone actually caught leaving
will be shot for desertion 
my decision is final 
get out 
  cora 
shh 
i wanted to talk to you 
talk with duncan  cora 
i must manage 
i cannot be
an invalid schoolgirl 
  alice 
  i ll see if mr  phelps needs anything 
i m sorry 
i didn t mean to 
cora  when we come together back in england
and are married and away from this place 
what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all 
  i m certain of that 
  duncan  i promised you an answer 
you ve complimented me
with your persistence and patience 
but the decision i have come to is that
i d rather make the gravest of mistakes   
than to surrender
my own judgment 
please take this
as my final answer 
it must be no 
i see 
yeah  nathaniel 
but you weren t ever for being here 
that s right  is a wit
that way then and i see it that way now 
ian  if i had kin in the settlements 
hell be damn sure i d be long gone 
what do we do about
bein  under crown law 
i believe if they set aside
their la was and when they wish 
their law no longer
has rightful authority over us 
all they have over us
then is tyranny 
and i will not live under that yoke 
so i will stay here no longer 
anyone caught leavin  the fort could be
shot  so each man make your own decision 
those who are goin 
be backin an hour 
out the northern
sally port 
strike for the eastside of the swamp
till you clear the french picket line 
head north over the ridge 
then come about south east 
fork left in little meadow and you re
free of the outpost and skirmishes 
should veskun out of this long ago 
got no families  captain 
figured we d stay and give a hand 
  i ll cover you from the top of the bastion 
  you re not comin  with us 
i got a reason to stay 
that reason wear a striped skirt
and work in the surgery 
it does  no offense  but it s a better
looking reason than you  jack winthrop 
push hard   cause you gotta clear the
french outpost by dawn  good luck  jack 
  ongewasgone  are you stayin  
  yes 
  there  stoo many french 
  and so few of us to fight 
not too many to die  but we ve
given our word to our english fathers 
you  sir  as you were 
stand off 
take him 
as you were 
he saved us 
we re alive only because of him 
the man encouraged the colonials to desert 
in this very room  and in my presence 
  sir 
  he is guilty of sedition 
he must be tried and hanged like any other
criminal  regardless of what he did for my children 
but he knew the consequences
and he stayed 
are those the actions
of a criminal 
  duncan  do something 
  he knew the penalty for his actions 
he ought to pay
without sending you to beg 
you know he wouldn t send me 
you falsely spoke of what you saw 
what happened at the farm
was as nathaniel said 
but not with enough certainty to
out weigh british interests in this fort 
and who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment   
on england s policies
in her own possessions 
and to come and go without so much
as a by your leave 
they do not live their lives
by your leave 
they hack it out of wilderness with their
own two hands  bearing children along the way 
you are defending him because you ve
become infatuated with him 
duncan  you are a man
with a few admirable qualities 
but taken as a whole  i was wrong
to have thought so highly of you 
cora 
cora  i would do anything
i could to keep you from being hurt 
but this man is guilty of sedition and
subject to military justice and beyond pardon 
justice  if that s justice 
then the sooner french guns   
blow the english army out of america 
the better it will be for the people here 
  you do not know what you re saying 
  i know exactly what i m saying 
and if it is sedition 
then i am guilty of sedition too 
they re going to hang you 
why didn t you leave
when you had the chance 
because what i m interested in
is right here 
what can i do 
webb s reinforcements
will arrive or not 
if they do not arrive 
the fort will fall to the french 
if that happens 
stay close to your father 
stay close to him 
the french officers will try to protect
the officers among the english 
  no  i will find you 
  do not 
promise me 
the whole world s on fire 
isn t it 
who is it 
remember what i told you 
stay close to your father
and the officers 
colonel munro 
i have known you
as a gallant antagonist 
i am happy to make
your acquaintance as a friend 
and i yours 
monsieur le marquis 
please accept
my compliments   
for the strong and skillful defense
of your fortress 
under the command of a lesser man 
it would have fallen long ago 
given the superior numbers
and materials 
chance has allowed me
to array against you 
monsieur le marquis 
i am a soldier  not a diplomat 
you called this parlay for a better
reason than an exchange of compliments 
you have already done everything which
is necessary for the honor of your prince 
but now i beg you to listen
to the admonishments of humanity 
i beg you to consider
my terms for your surrender 
perhaps the general s glass
can reach as far as the hudson   
and seize the size and eminence
of the army of webb 
my scouts intercepted
this dispatch intended for you 
capitan de bougainville 
 to colonel munro 
sir  i regret to inform you   
that i have no men available
to send to your rescue 
it is quite impossible 
i advise you to seek terms
for surrender 
i remain 
jerome webb at fort edward   
this is the signature of webb 
and i know the temper of our men 
rather than spend the war in a french prison
hulk in hudson bay  they d fight to the end 
  you ve had your answer  monsieur le marquis 
  sir 
i beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many   
until you have listened
to what i have to say 
  go on 
  none of your men will see the inside of a prison barge 
they are free  so long as they
return to england   
and fight no more
on this continent 
and the civilian militia
return to their farms 
  their arms 
  they may leave the fortress fully armed 
my colors 
carry them to england
with pride 
allow me to consult
with my officers 
webb can burn in hell 
and we ll go back and dig our graves
behind those ramparts 
death and honor
are thought to be the same 
but today i have learned
that sometimes they are not 
sir 
monsieur le marquis  i am deeply touched
by such unusual and unexpected generosity 
my fort is yours
under the condition   
that i be given till dawn
to bury my dead 
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead   
and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons 
granted  monsieur 
is the hatchet buried between
the english and my french father 
  yes 
  not a warrior has a scalp   
and the white men
become friends 
my master
owns these lands   
and i have been ordered to drive off
the english squatters 
they have consented
to go 
so now i call them
enemies no longer 
magua took the hatchet
to color with blood 
it s still bright 
only when it s red 
then it will be buried 
so many suns have set
since magua struck the war post 
and where is that sun 
le subtil is the son of his people
and he has come to lead many of them 
but le subtil has power
with his huron people and others here 
i know well 
magua s village and lodges
were burnt 
magua s children were killed
by the english 
i was taken as slave
by the mohawk   
who fought for grey hair 
magua s wife believed
he was dead   
and became the wife
of another 
the grey hair
was the father of all that 
in time 
magua became blood brother
to the mohawk to become free 
but always in his heart
he is huron 
and his heart will be
whole again on the day   
the grey hair and
all his seed are dead 
my son magua s pain   
is my pain 
does the chief of the canadas believe
the english will keep the terms 
colonel munro would 
but generai webb will not
honor the agreement   
and send
their soldiers away 
i fear having let them go 
which i must 
i will only fight
the same men again   
when i drive
towards albany 
but i cannot break
the term of the surrender   
and sully the lilies
of france 
monsieur  the fort is yours 
left three ranks  make ready 
aim  set 
fire 
present fire 
fire  fire 
full company 
grey hair  before you die  know that i
will put under the knife your children   
so i will wipe your seed
from the earth forever 
lever her alone 
when you fall into british hands again 
i ll have you hanged 
faster 
take to the river 
  where are we going 
  nowhere 
  i don t understand 
  this is as far as we go 
if we re lucky  they ll figure we
beached our canoes and headed cross land 
if we re very lucky 
they ll figure we went over the falls 
  our only hope is that they pass us by 
  if they do 
take the south rim
down the mountain 
it s 12 miles cross country
to fort edward 
and if they don t 
you ll just have to forego
the pleasure of hangin  me 
powder 
  gone 
mine s soakin  wet 
our father 
did you see my father 
from a distance 
say nothing to alice 
get back 
yes  go ahead 
what the bloody hell
plan is this 
  i want you to go 
  if we got here s a chance there won t be a fight 
there s no powder  if we don t go in that 
there s no chance  none  you understand 
coward 
you stay alive 
if they don t kill you  they ll
take you north up to the huron lands 
submit  do you hear 
you re strong 
you survive 
you stay alive 
no matter what occurs 
i will find you 
no matter how long it takes 
no matter how far 
i will find you 
i don t speak huron 
do you speak french  major 
  no 
  translate for me in french  every word as i say it 
  i come to you unarmed and in peace   
to unstuff your ears 
sachem 
let the children of the dead
colonel munro go free 
take fire out of the english anger
over the murder of their helpless ones 
  sachem  the french fathers made peace 
magua broke it  it is false that the
french will be friends still to the huron 
would magua use the ways of
le francais and the yengeese 
  would you 
  yes 
  would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish   
with brandy and steal his lands
to sell them for gold to the white man 
  would huron have greed for
more land than a man can use 
would huron fool seneca
into taking all the furs   
of all the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey 
would the huron kill every man 
woman and child of their enemy 
those are the ways of the yengeese
and the francais traders   
and their masters in europe
infected with the sickness of greed 
magua s heart is twisted 
he would make himself
into what twisted him 
i am nathaniel of the yengeese 
hawkeye  adopted son of chingachgook
of the mohican people 
let the children of the dead munro
and the yengeese officer go free 
this belt  which is a record of the days
of my father s people  speaks for my truth 
  tell him i ll trade him  me for her 
  say it 
  stop it 
i am la longue carabine 
my death is a great honor
to the huron  take me 
did you tell him 
yes 
stop 
i said take me 
  take me 
  my compliments  sir  take her and get out 
what are they doing to duncan 
where s alice 
alice 
uncas 
great spirit
and maker of all life 
a warrior goes to you swift and straight
as an arrow shot into the sun 
welcome him  and let him take his place
at the council fire of my people 
he is uncas 
my son 
tell him to be patient
and ask death for speed 
for they are all there
but one 
i  chingachgook 
the last of the mohicans 
the frontier moves
with the sun 
and pushes the red man of these
wilderness forests in front of it   
until one day
there will be nowhere left 
then our race
will be no more 
or be not us 
that is my father s
sadness talking 
no  it is true 
the frontier place is for people
like my white son and his woman   
and their children 
and one day there will be
no more frontier 
and men like you
will go too 
like the mohicans 
and new people will come
