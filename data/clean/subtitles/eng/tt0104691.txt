les francais
now les francais
bring huron ottawa
abenaki on to mohawk land
now mohawk will fight
les francais and huron
i speak for the twin rivers
mohawk of the six nations
his majesty king george ll
is very grateful for your support
how far up the valley
up to fort william henry
thats two nights
and abit from here
should be enough to remind you that france is our enemy
france is you r enemy
and while were at your fort
what if the french attack our homes
what then lieutenant
for your homes
for king for country
thats why you men
ought to join this fight
you do what you want
with your owns calp
do not be tellin us
what we ought to do with ours
you call yourself a patriot
a loyal subject to the crown
i do not call myself
subject to much a tall
i agree with some of what
nathaniel and john say
but i believe englands
still our sovereign
im stayin on my farm
any man who goes his familys welcome
to fort up with us till he comes back
boys my sense of it is
we have enough here
to fill the county levy
and its a fight
we ought to make
but first we gotta
get terms from generai webb
well go to albany
attention
therell be no conditions attached
to service in the british army
help my man outside
with the baggage
if theyre not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes
if the french
attack the settlements
no colonial militia
is going to fort william henry
they will report
or be pressed into service
any of the boys worth havin can disappear
they will be found
where does that leave you
those men will be found
i cannot imagine his majesty
in all his benevolence
would ever object to his
loyal american subjects
defending their hearth and home
their women and children
does that mean they
will be granted leave
to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked
of course
you got yourself
a colonial militia general
major duncan heyward
reporting sir
enroute to fort william henry
and bearing dispatches
en route to fort william henry
and bearing dispatches
safe journey i trust
yes
and i didnt experience anything
so surprising from bristol to albany
as that that
i witnessed here today
and what was that
the crown negotiating
the terms of service
well now one has to reason with these
colonials to get them to do anything
tiring isnt it
but thats the lay of the land
i thought british policy is
make the world england sir
i see youre to serve with the 35th
regiment of foot at fort william henry
under colonel munro
ill be marching the 60th
to fort edward
explain to the major
he has little to fear
from this general marquis de montcalm
in the first place
and therefore scant need
of the colonial militia in the second
because the french
havent the nature for war
their latinate
voluptuousness
combines with their
gallic laziness
and the result is theyd rathereat and
make love with their faces than fight
might linquire if generai webb has
heard from colonei munros daughters
i was to rendezvous with them in albany
and escort them to the fort sir
you there uh
what does munro call you
the scotsman has sent you
one of his mohawk allies
to guide you
magua
the scotsmans daughters
are at the poltroons house
a company of the 60th
will accompany you
and magua will
show you the way
dawn at the encampment
600 a m sharp see to it youre there
ill take him for you sir
cora
duncan
how long have you been in albany
for days and days
and your self
just arrived
by god its good
to see you
i dont know
what to say duncan
alice and i have depended upon you
and respected you
since we were
all children
i truly wish they did
but my feelings dont
dont go beyond friendship
dont you see
respect and friendship
isnt that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married
and all else
may grow in time
some say thats the way of it
some
cousin eugenie my father
well then cora
in my heart i know
once were joined
well be the most
marvelous couple in london
im certain of that
so why not let those
whom you trust your father
help settle
whats best for you
in view of your indecision
you should rely on their judgment
and mine
will you consider that
please consider that
yes
yes i will
duncan
by god youve grown up
we leave in the morning
yes miss

adventure have you seen the red man

unless all of youd rather wait for
the next huron war party to come by
scout id like to
thank you for your help
how much further is it
night and a bit
appears were well away from them
maybe
maybe they aint alone
that huron captain back there
the guide hes a mohawk

what reason did he have
to murder the girl
what
the darkhaired one
miss cora munro murder her
he never set eyes on her before today
shes only been here a week
blood vengeance
a reproach or insult
of course not
how is it
you were so nearby

tracked em
then youre assigned
to fort william henry
nope
fort edward then
headin west to cantuckee
there is a waron
how is it you are heading west
well we kind of face to the north
and real suddenlike turn left
i though tall our colonial scouts
were in the militia
the militia is fighting
the french in the north
i aint your scout
and we sure aint in no damn militia
ottawa two francais
what did you say
mirrors
tools the clothes
everything was inside
they didnt take anything
they were movin fast
a war party
let us look after them
leave them
who ever they are
though theyre strangers
theyre at least entitled
to a christian burial
they cant be left behind
let us go miss
i will not
ive seen the face of war before sir
but ive not seen war
made upon women and children
nor most as cruel
as your indifference
miss munro
theyre not strangers
and theystayasthey lay
why didnt you
bury these people
anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign
we passed that way
you knew them well
you were acting for our benefit
and i apologize
i misunderstood you
well thats to be expected
my father warned me about
your father
chingachgook
he warned me about people like you
oh he did
no
why did they turn back
burial ground
where is your real family
they buried my ma and pa
and my sisters
chingachgook found me with two french
trappers raised me up as his own
im sorry
i do not remember
i wasnt but one or two
how did you
learn english
my father sent uncas and i to reverend
whee locks school when i wasten
sowe would know
both worlds
why were those people living
in this defenseless place
after seven years indentured service
in virginia they headed out here
cause the frontiers the only land
available to poor people
out here theyre
be holden to none
not livin
by anothers leave
their name was cameron
john and alexandra cameron
my fathers people say that
at the birth of the sun
and of his brother the moon
their mother died
so the sun gave
to the earth her body
from which was
to spring all life
and he drew forth from
her breast the stars
the stars he threw into the night sky
to remind him ofher soul
so theres
the camerons monument
my folks too i guess
you are right mr poe
we do not understand
what is happening here
and its not
as i imagined it would be
thinking of it
in boston and london
sorry to disappoint you
no on the contrary
it is more deeply
stirring to my blood
than any imagining
could possibly have been
top of the next ridge
the forts down hill of it
the men of the regiment
will fetch water from the lake
build fires and provide
every comfort and desire
i cant wait to see papa
aah
fire
fire
aah
aah
open up
im major duncan heyward
captain jeffrey beams
didnt expect you to make it through
lets go to munro
hello boys
nathaniel
uncas thought you and
nathaniel werent joinin up
we didnt
papa papa
alice cora
why are you here
and where the hell
are my reinforcements
get mr phelps
told you to stay away
why did you disobey me girls
when how i
my letter
there was none there was no letter
what
i sent three couriers to webb
one called magua arrived
he delivered no message
does webb not even know we are besieged
sir webb has no idea and he certainly
does not know to send reinforcements
what happened to you
on the george road attacked
were fine
are you all right
yes
what will happen here papa
well be all right girl
this magua led us in to it
eighteen killed these men came
to our aid they guided us here
thank you
do you need anything
help our selves to a few horns from your powder stores
some food
indebted to you
miss cora how are you
hello mr phelps
mrs mccann will get some
dry clothes for you
thank you
go with your sister
alice
itll be all right
girl
itll be all right
might i inquire after
the situation sir
given that ive seen the french
engineering from the ridge above
the situation is his guns are bigger
than mine and he has more of them
we keep our heads down while his
troops dig 30yards of trench a day
when those trenches are 200yards
from the fort and within range
hell bring in
his 15inch mortars
lob explosive rounds
over our walls and pound us to dust
they look to be
300 yards out
if theyre digging 30yards a day
you have three days
damn damn
this man here can make a run
straight through to webb
three days is not enough time to get
to albany and back with reinforcements
webbs not in albany he marched
the 60th to fort edward two days ago
webb is at edward
yes sir
thats only 12 miles away
he could have reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow
you sir pick your man
major heyward will provide adiversion
ill draft outadis patch captain beams
will seek you out and give it to you later
somethin else
camerons cabin frontier cabin
came upon it yesterday
it was burnt out everyone murdered
it was ottawa
allied to the french
aye so
it was a war party
that means theyre gonna be attackin
up and down the frontier
thank you sir
people here mohawks settlers
have family out there
thatll be all sir
things were done
nobody was spared
those considerations are subordinate
to the interests of the crown
a terrible feature of war here
in the americas major heyward
best keep your eye fixed on our duty
to defeat france
that hangs on
a courier to webb
for my children are the children
of the true faith
my friendship and esteem
is boundless
i will give you
three oxen for a feast
and tomorrow i will sing
the war song with you
at the great council fire
magua how are things
with your english friends
were at one join us
hear what he
has to tell us
the english
war chief webb
goes to fort edward
with 60th regiment
he does not know that my fathers army
attacks fort william henry
magua was successful
the other two couriers
died in the forest
by now munro would know his
dispatch did not get through
hell send another
grey hair will try
four or five
including two women entered the fort
the grey hairs children
were under maguas knife
they escaped
they will be
under it again
why do you hate
the grey hair magua
when the grey hair is dead
magua will eat his heart
before he dies
magua will put his children
under the knife
so the grey hair
will know
his seed
is wiped out forever
miss cora
gentleman lookin for you
miss munro
hello
may i
it will seep and then its going to draw
thank you miss
bout done holdin hands
with miss munro
we got some work to do
what are you
looking at sir
im looking at you miss
munro refused to believe
what happened
he does not even
want to hear it
well hes gonna have to
get to get her
by the west bastion
ian sharitarish
ongewasgone and william
tight weave
silk
another 40 yards
fire
aim and fire
wheel to the right
on center march
halt
ready
set fire
aah
and how am i to know
it wasnt a raid by common thieves
the cabin was attacked bya war party
fighting with the french
theyre sweeping south down the frontier
attacking farms and mohawk villages
all the men are stuck here
i need proof more convincing than this mans opinion
before i weaken the forts defenses
by releasing the militia
chingachgooks of the
same opinion about the raid
taken together thats gospel
your fort will stand or fall
depending on webbs reinforcements
not the presence
of the colonials
i judge military matters here
not you
your judgment is not more important
than their right
under agreement with webb
to defend their farms and families
major heyward was there he was
at john camerons he saw what it was
what exactly did you see major
i saw nothing that would lead me to the
conclusion it was other than a raid
by savages bent on thievery
youre a liar
major
montcalm is a soldier
and a gentleman not a butcher
easy for you to suppose its their women
and children alone on the farms not yours
you for get yourself sir
were not forgettin webbs promise
british promises are honored
and the militia will not be released
because i need more definite proof
than this mans word
nathaniels words been good on this
frontier a longtime before you got here
this meeting is over
the militia stays
does the rule of english law
no longer govern
has it been replaced
by absolutism
if english law cannot be trusted people
would do better making peace with the french
that is sedition
that is the truth
ill have you beaten
from this fort
anyone fomenting on advocating the leaving of
fort william henry will be hung for sedition
anyone actually caught leaving
will be shot for desertion
my decision is final
get out
cora
shh
i wanted to talk to you
talk with duncan cora
i must manage
i cannot be
an invalid schoolgirl
alice
ill see if mr phelps needs anything
im sorry
i didnt mean to
cora when we come together back in england
and are married and away from this place
what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all
im certain of that
duncan i promised you an answer
youve complimented me
with your persistence and patience
but the decision i have come to is that
id rather make the gravest of mistakes
than to surrender
my own judgment
please take this
as my final answer
it must be no
i see
yeah nathaniel
but you werent ever for being here
thats right is a wit
that way then and i see it that way now
ian if i had kin in the settlements
hell be damn sure id be long gone
what do we do about
bein under crown law
i believe if they set aside
their la was and when they wish
their law no longer
has rightful authority over us
all they have over us
then is tyranny
and i will not live under that yoke
so i will stay here no longer
anyone caught leavin the fort could be
shot so each man make your own decision
those who are goin
be backin an hour
out the northern
sallyport
strike for the eastside of the swamp
till you clear the french picket line
head north over the ridge
then come about south east
fork left in little meadow and youre
free of the outpost and skirmishes
shouldveskun out of this long ago
got no families captain
figured wed stay and give a hand
ill cover you from the top of the bastion
youre not comin with us
i got a reason to stay
that reason wear a striped skirt
and work in the surgery
it does no offense but its a better
looking reason than you jack winthrop
push hard cause you gotta clear the
french outpost by dawn good luck jack
ongewasgone are you stayin
yes
there stoo many french
and so few of us to fight
not too many to die but weve
given our word to our english fathers
you sir as you were
stand off
take him
as you were
he saved us
were alive only because of him
the man encouraged the colonials to desert
in this very room and in my presence
sir
he is guilty of sedition
he must be tried and hanged like any other
criminal regardless of what he did for my children
but he knew the consequences
and he stayed
are those the actions
of a criminal
duncan do something
he knew the penalty for his actions
he ought to pay
without sending you to beg
you know he wouldnt send me
you falsely spoke of what you saw
what happened at the farm
was as nathaniel said
but not with enough certainty to
out weigh british interests in this fort
and who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment
on englands policies
in her own possessions
and to come and go without so much
as a by your leave
they do not live their lives
by your leave
they hack it out of wilderness with their
own two hands bearing children along the way
you are defending him because youve
become infatuated with him
duncan you are a man
with a few admirable qualities
but taken as a whole i was wrong
to have thought so highly of you
cora
cora i would do anything
i could to keep you from being hurt
but this man is guilty of sedition and
subject to military justice and beyond pardon
justice if thats justice
then the sooner french guns
blow the english army out of america
the better it will be for the people here
you do not know what youre saying
i know exactly what im saying
and if it is sedition
then i am guilty of sedition too
theyre going to hang you
why didnt you leave
when you had the chance
because what im interested in
is right here
what can i do
webbs reinforcements
will arrive or not
if they do not arrive
the fort will fall to the french
if that happens
stay close to your father
stay close to him
the french officers will try to protect
the officers among the english
no i will find you
do not
promise me
the whole worlds on fire
isnt it
who is it
remember what i told you
stay close to your father
and the officers
colonel munro
i have known you
as a gallant antagonist
i am happy to make
your acquaintance as a friend
and i yours
monsieur le marquis
please accept
my compliments
for the strong and skillful defense
of your fortress
under the command of a lesser man
it would have fallen long ago
given the superior numbers
and materials
chance has allowed me
to array against you
monsieur le marquis
i am a soldier not a diplomat
you called this parlay for a better
reason than an exchange of compliments
you have already done everything which
is necessary for the honor of your prince
but now i beg you to listen
to the admonishments of humanity
i beg you to consider
my terms for your surrender
perhaps the generals glass
can reach as far as the hudson
and seize the size and eminence
of the army of webb
my scouts intercepted
this dispatch intended for you
capitan de bougainville
to colonel munro
sir i regret to inform you
that i have no men available
to send to your rescue
it is quite impossible
i advise you to seek terms
for surrender
i remain
jerome webb at fort edward
this is the signature of webb
and i know the temper of our men
rather than spend the war in a french prison
hulk in hudson bay theyd fight to the end
youve had your answer monsieur le marquis
sir
i beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many
until you have listened
to what i have to say
go on
none of your men will see the inside of a prison barge
they are free so long as they
return to england
and fight no more
on this continent
and the civilian militia
return to their farms
their arms
they may leave the fortress fully armed
my colors
carry them to england
with pride
allow me to consult
with my officers
webb can burn in hell
and well go back and dig our graves
behind those ramparts
death and honor
are thought to be the same
but today i have learned
that sometimes they are not
sir
monsieur le marquis i am deeply touched
by such unusual and unexpected generosity
my fort is yours
under the condition
that i be given till dawn
to bury my dead
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead
and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons
granted monsieur
is the hatchet buried between
the english and my french father
yes
not a warrior has a scalp
and the white men
become friends
my master
owns these lands
and i have been ordered to drive off
the english squatters
they have consented
to go
so now i call them
enemies no longer
magua took the hatchet
to color with blood
its still bright
only when its red
then it will be buried
so many suns have set
since magua struck the war post
and where is that sun
le subtil is the son of his people
and he has come to lead many of them
but le subtil has power
with his huron people and others here
i know well
maguas village and lodges
were burnt
maguas children were killed
by the english
i was taken as slave
by the mohawk
who fought for grey hair
maguas wife believed
he was dead
and became the wife
of another
the grey hair
was the father of all that
in time
magua became blood brother
to the mohawk to become free
but always in his heart
he is huron
and his heart will be
whole again on the day
the grey hair and
all his seed are dead
my son maguas pain
is my pain
does the chief of the canadas believe
the english will keep the terms
colonel munro would
but generai webb will not
honor the agreement
and send
their soldiers away
i fear having let them go
which i must
i will only fight
the same men again
when i drive
towards albany
but i cannot break
the term of the surrender
and sully the lilies
of france
monsieur the fort is yours
left three ranks make ready
aim set
fire
present fire
fire fire
full company
grey hair before you die know that i
will put under the knife your children
so i will wipe your seed
from the earth forever
lever her alone
when you fall into british hands again
ill have you hanged
faster
take to the river
where are we going
nowhere
i dont understand
this is as far as we go
if were lucky theyll figure we
beached our canoes and headed cross land
if were very lucky
theyll figure we went over the falls
our only hope is that they pass us by
if they do
take the south rim
down the mountain
its 12 miles cross country
to fort edward
and if they dont
youll just have to forego
the pleasure of hangin me
powder
gone
mines soakin wet
our father
did you see my father
from a distance
say nothing to alice
get back
yes go ahead
what the bloody hell
plan is this
i want you to go
if we got heres a chance there wont be a fight
theres no powder if we dont go in that
theres no chance none you understand
coward
you stay alive
if they dont kill you theyll
take you north up to the huron lands
submit do you hear
youre strong
you survive
you stay alive
no matter what occurs
i will find you
no matter how long it takes
no matter how far
i will find you
i dont speak huron
do you speak french major
no
translate for me in french every word as i say it
i come to you unarmed and in peace
to unstuff your ears
sachem
let the children of the dead
colonel munro go free
take fire out of the english anger
over the murder of their helpless ones
sachem the french fathers made peace
magua broke it it is false that the
french will be friends still to the huron
would magua use the ways of
le francais and the yengeese
would you
yes
would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish
with brandy and steal his lands
to sell them for gold to the white man
would huron have greed for
more land than a man can use
would huron fool seneca
into taking all the furs
of all the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey
would the huron kill every man
woman and child of their enemy
those are the ways of the yengeese
and the francais traders
and their masters in europe
infected with the sickness of greed
maguas heart is twisted
he would make himself
into what twisted him
i am nathaniel of the yengeese
hawkeye adopted son of chingachgook
of the mohican people
let the children of the dead munro
and the yengeese officer go free
this belt which is a record of the days
of my fathers people speaks for my truth
tell him ill trade him me for her
say it
stop it
i am la longue carabine
my death is a great honor
to the huron take me
did you tell him
yes
stop
i said take me
take me
my compliments sir take her and get out
what are they doing to duncan
wheres alice
alice
uncas
great spirit
and maker of all life
a warrior goes to you swift and straight
as an arrow shot into the sun
welcome him and let him take his place
at the council fire of my people
he is uncas
my son
tell him to be patient
and ask death for speed
for they are all there
but one
i chingachgook
the last of the mohicans
the frontier moves
with the sun
and pushes the red man of these
wilderness forests in front of it
until one day
there will be nowhere left
then our race
will be no more
or be not us
that is my fathers
sadness talking
no it is true
the frontier place is for people
like my white son and his woman
and their children
and one day there will be
no more frontier
and men like you
will go too
like the mohicans
and new people will come
