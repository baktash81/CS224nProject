we re all very different people 
we re not watusi 
we re not spartans 
we re americans
with a capital  a   huh 
you know what that means 
do you  that means
that our forefathers

decent country in the worid 
we are the wretched refuse 
we re the underdog 
we re mutts 
here s proof 
his nose is cold

who cried when old yeller
got shot at the end 
nobody cried
when old yeller got shot 
i m sure 
i cried my eyes out 
yeah 
so we re all dogfaces

that we all have in common 
we were all stupid enough
to enlist in the army 
we re mutants

and we don t have to worry   
about whether or not
we ve practiced 
we don t have to worry   
about whether captain stillman
wants to have us hung 
all we have to do   
is to be the great american
fighting soldier
