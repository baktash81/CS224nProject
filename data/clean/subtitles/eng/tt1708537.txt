wild animal actually comes
makes contact
amazing thing
first thing comes mind
see
course luna looking friends
friendship thats human idea
scientists call anthropomorphism
use human ideas like friendship
describe animals feelings
years theyve said wrong
thats one words
anthropomorphic police would let use
long time
sort friendships animals
scientists learned
way humans animals experience similar emotions
use words like friendship
whales developed friendships
understanding friends interact
great stuff
humans interact
friendly whale
nobody knew
lot people wanted find
news whale started travel
people got really excited
know theyd know wed seen

like many residents around nootka sound
luna went work timber industry
crews said
ought get goggles hard hat
put payroll
ed thorburn started calling bruno
thought boy luna
thats girls name

ed got interested research
particularly whether baby whale dangerous
mean incidents
killer whales responsible deaths
know like aquariums
history killer whale
ever nasty experience purposely
human wild

humans build wall minds
fear respect
wild beings
luna breaking

like thegmasti dancing
suzanne first got nootka sound
started
watching luna shore
feeling kinship
even distance

could animal different
could almost call extraterrestrial
anything common human beings
maybe
humans thought
animals serve us
philosophers said thoughts
today radio astronomers listen

biologists listening minds home
right earth
evidence lives barely noticed
mysterious familiar
ever imagined
whales sea million years
humans land long know
us built survival
learning depend family friends
separate ways
humans orcas learned thing
solitude incomplete
bear
many scientists think
kind complex social life
requires intricate intelligence
smart get along
maybe thats
seemed strange wonderful
maybe humans looked lunas eyes
saw something recognized
intent
awareness
longing fullyconscious life
living historic times
powerful
really hard thing explain
intensity contact
meant different things different people

captivity option
rumours flew like sparks wind
nootka sound
set fire among first nations
totally disrespectful first nations
want capture whale
throw cage something
