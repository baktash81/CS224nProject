 pats on back 
ray  so  number five is a 
number six is c 
 cell phone ringing 
hello 
we have a problem with fay 
what kind of problem 
he refuses to change into
the school s gym uniform 
he sits out every day 
look  he s only got a few days left 
no  i understand 
but it encourages insubordination 
now  no students wanna wear the uniform 
so  that makes him a leader 
if i can interject 
ray  the more serious issue here
is fahmarr s education 
he s years behind where he should be
in reading  math 
my advice  when fahmarr goes back home 
he should drop a grade 
but he s a smart kid 
he s too smart to be doing this poorly 
when your mom gets out of the hospital 
she should explore counseling for him 
hmm 
what you in for 
swearing 
said the big one 
you 
tax fraud 
 giggles 
let s go 
  nice talkin  to you 
  yeah 
fahmarr  did you know white kids
cut the edges off they toast
and don t get in trouble for it 
ray  oh  man 
why is everything so difficult with you 
the teacher says wear the gym clothes 
then just wear  em 
i leave my clothes in my locker 
someone s gonna take my lunch money 
they don t have locks 
that s  cause they don t need  em 
look around  no one s gonna go through
your pockets and steal your food money 
that s what mom did 
what are you talkin  about 
while you were livin  with your coaches 
i put money under my pillow
and i d hide it in my shoes 
she still find it  always 
i didn t know that 
and you wouldn t 
 cause you left me 
you still don t understand 
stop 
here  smallest size they had 
clemson gloves 
ooh  snap 
for real 
sorry for raisin  my voice 
don t start with the mushy stuff  ray 
you had me at nike 
but speakin  of mushy 
ain t you got that open mic thing tonight 
 sighs  not goin  anymore 
are you not goin  because of me 
somebody has to keep an eye on you 
 mimics italian accent  italian 
  he s already done enough 
   normal voice  yep 
standin  your girlfriend up
is real smooth 
or you could just be lookin 
for an excuse not to go
because you re   
scared of commitment 
oprah 
so you want me to babysit him 
 clears throat 
i ll be babysittin  you  mini me 
uh huh 
look  i just need you around
while i m gone for a few hours 
of course i will 
  as long as the rest of the crew knows 
  no 
there s no way the rest
of the team can find out 
and then coach  are you crazy 
they can keep secrets 
but the point is  we need help 
no offense  but it s become exhausting 
it doesn t have to be
if we lighten some of your load 
we about to get hazed 
this is ray s brother  fahmarr 
  what s up 
  what s good 
  what s up 
  what s up  little man 
so  when y all gonna tell me about
this secret you all was talkin  about

 ray chuckles

i loved it 
that was a good call  thank you 
seriously 
when i ran into you 
at the laundromat on campus 
you dropped some kids  underwear 
i didn t ask at first 
but also  i don t wanna be naive to think
that you couldn t have a kid

kaycee  my mom isn t a nurse 
she s a drug addict 
for the past month 
i had to bring my little brother
to live with me on campus
while she s in treatment 
that s the underwear you found
and why i was acting weird towards you 
why would you keep that from me 
i didn t want you to see me as baggage 
we all have baggage  ray 
but taking care of your family
isn t something you hide 
and it s nothing to be embarrassed about 
trust me  you don t know my family 
and you clearly don t know me 
i m sorry 
what else have you lied about 
that s it  i promise  that s it 
  what s his name 
  fahmarr 
but i call him fay 
i assume your father isn t around 
no  he left
a few years after fay was born 
is fay with your mom again  now 
no  she s in treatment
a little bit longer 
so  he s in a group home 
  and you re okay with that 
  kaycee  i have no choice 
fay being here
almost cost me my spot on the team

yeah 
door s always open  ray 
 door opens 
now  ray  we ve looked
into all the rules here 
you re in danger
of losing your scholarship
if they find him
living with you on campus 
it s a miracle you got away with it
as long as you did 
the last thing i wanna be
is a distraction to this team 
but i m the only person fay has right now 
so if that means leaving the team 
then i d have to accept that 
 sniffles 
let s go 
  where are we going 
  we re going to get your brother 
in order for this to work 
we have to move you out of the dorms
and get you an apartment you can t afford 
coach bowden 
he s on the fence about this 
worried if you can handle it 
juggling a lot right now  ray 
  i can handle it 
  i hope so 
once we get your brother 
that s a commitment 
he needs stability  now more than ever 
coach  why are you helping me 
that shirt you re wearing  son 
temporary custody
is effective immediately 
thank you 
he s all yours

simmons  cheap apartments

keep up your grades up 
i need you eligible 
pull over  coach 
yo 
mom s out of the equation  fay 
i love her and i want her to get better 
but we both know
there s a chance she might not 
so  right now  i m all you got 
and i m risking everything
for us to have a real life 
but you will not disrespect me anymore 
that s it 
north  you do what i say
and when i say it 
south  you go back to the system
and wait on mom 
your choice 
north

it makes you look more nervous 
and it is equally as important for her
to show you that she s interested as well

thank you  god bless you 
we re doing the lord s work today 
  let s go 
  woman  excuse me 
pastor  come on  everybody 
thank you so much  come on 
god gave you strong backs for a reason 
how you doing  ray 
let s get this right here 
samantha  oh  there they go 
somebody is gonna be an athlete
like his brother 
  watch him be the fastest 
  he will be  you re right 
a friendly competition
never hurt anything 
  yeah  yeah  he have a lot of energy 
  he sure does 
you know  all three  oh  my gosh 
ray  should ve seen him
in the dorm room  man 
 phone ringing 
fahmarr   on voicemail  it s ray and fay 
say what you gotta say  beep 
   voicemail beeps 
  simmons  i know you know who this is 
i need you to come down
as soon as you get this 
coach  it s me 
mike  ray   
i m here to determine if you ve received
any financial assistance
outside of your designated school stipend 
no one s giving me any money 
okay  that s good 
have you or your brother received
any rides from coaches and their wives 
rides 
yes  sometimes 
and you ve been
to coaches  homes for meals 
would you like my wife
to give him an itemized bill 
i m just doing my job  coach 
after all  we both work for clemson 
okay 
i also learned that the church
assisted you with free labor 
just moving junk to a dumpster 
but i didn t ask them to 
look  i understand 
but that could be considered
an improper benefit 
hold on here a second 
these are people trying to help him
and his little brother out 
now  fay living with ray
is not a violation 
people have visitors all the time 
look  it s my job to overreact so that
we don t get blind sided by infractions 
it s a thin line with these things 
and we prefer
to be on the right side of it 
 scoffs  i appreciate you  mike 
but your side of the line is crap 
i wonder if another player
has a sick grandfather
or a mother who can t pay the bills 
these rules are in place
so that schools recruit players
instead of buying them 
look  i m not thrilled with this 
but legally  if we re not careful 
this could be an issue 
we heard you the first time  mike 
get to the point 
ray 
if you wanna keep playing college ball 
something s got to give 
i m sorry 
 door closes 
i can t send him back 
they ll stick him in a group home 
coach  y all got my back  right 
i have everybody in this building s back 
but it s a fine line  ray 
the longer fay is here 
the bigger risk you run
of slipping up with some violation
we don t even see coming 
we re talking fines  lost scholarships 
  forfeiting wins 
  can t they make an exception 
i just want a waiver
that says i can get a little help 
no  you re asking the ncaa
to reverse themselves 
and before a game at that 
i m not asking them to reverse anything 
just consider my circumstances 
ray  i m considering your circumstances 
but this right here is a hail mary 
i don t think we re gonna win this one 
they re asking me to choose
between football and my brother 
but clearly  y all already chose 
simmons  ray 
ray  you will not disrespect us like that
while i am your coach 
you understand that 
we put our jobs on the line for you also 
this just got bigger than us 
  okay  so  i get it 
  you don t get it 
you re helping another black kid in need
so you can sleep better 
stop fronting like you care 
let me tell you something  son 
i grew up in  8 a night motels
with my mother till we got evicted 
so  when i played college ball 
she slept on a cot in my room 
does that sound familiar to you 
so  maybe i do know
a little bit of what you re going through 
and you cannot help
your brother or your mother
if you get thrown outta here
for violations 
i can t let him down 
i know  son 
and you have done more for that kid
than you can ever imagine 
it ain t fair  but it s reality 
well  i m not
accepting that reality again  coach 
i m tired of that excuse
hanging over my life 
so if you and everyone else
is done fighting with me 
i ll fight by myself 
used to it 
solomon  thank you  and speaking of which 
you look hungry 
eat you some of this 
fahmarr  this is caramel  so i like it 
daniel  i m hungry  too 
can i get a piece 
hey  fahmarr  where d you get that 
solo gave it to me 
yo  it s literally just a candy bar 
it s food paid for by the school 
in a few days 
i m gonna be asking the ncaa
to bend the rules so i can keep you here 
  you think this helps 
  my fault  man 
i m sorry 
ray 
you didn t call 
i wanted to see how you guys were 
we re fine 
kaycee  but i drove 
i could take you home 
your dad s alumni  he paid for that car 
no rides  no food  no help  so  stop 
everybody  stop 
we can take care of ourselves
by ourselves 
hope that article was worth it 
let s go  fay 
solomon  yo  i m sorry 
fresh  sorry  man 
solomon  i ll catch you  little bro 
goodbye  bro 
tobin  bye  nephew 
ray  fahmarr 
okay 
stop yelling at me 
why are you so mad  man 
you need to chill  bro 
 thunder rumbling 
fay 
i don t think i should get in 
thank you  though 
sorry  buddy 
from students  alumni and professors 
voicing their support
for ray and his brother 
we don t like this situation  either 
but between us  coach 
there s no way he s getting that waiver
passed this week 
at least you know where you stand on this 
look  i didn t ask ray mcelrathbey
to take his brother in 
no  you didn t 
you re asking him to give him up
or give up his future 
if we have any more perceived violations 
they could sanction the entire program 
and if i m being candid 
that s too much to risk for one player 
that s where you and me differ  mike 
 cause he s not just one player to me 
he s part of a family 
i ll take that risk any day of the week 
enjoy your reading 
fahmarr 
you want the rest of these noodles
 fore i throw  em away 
fahmarr 
 you belong at clemson  
fay 
thanks  bro 
solomon and tobin said
that he hasn t been to the bus stop 
oh  man  oh  man 
well  the rest of your team
has the campus covered 
and the cops
are checking the train station 
solomon  fahmarr 
yo  fay  where are you at  dawg 
tobin  ray ray s kid  man  come out 
kaycee   
  thank you 
  yeah  for what 
just for always being here for me 
even when i tried to push you away 
you didn t deserve that 
it s okay 
all right 
i m sorry  too 
 cell phone buzzing 
hello  pastor 
yes  yes  yes  i m not far at all 
we found him 
  oh  god 
  he s not far 
  just straight down the road 
  okay 
ray  where is he 
i was walking out of the diner
and i saw him hitchhiking 
i m not trying to be the reason
you gotta leave clemson 
when you were a kid 
i said that i d always be there for you 
that s one promise i ll never break 
whatever happens  we ll be okay  fay 
you and me  we ll be okay 
let s go 
ray ray  you know
i m with you till the end 
but swinging at the ncaa 
hey  whatever they decide is final 
and our coaches can t protect you 
tell fay i m pulling an all nighter
at the complex 
make sure he does his homework  please 
i don t understand  relinquishment 
it means that you d irrevocably terminate
all parental and custodial rights
from fahmarr 
and transfer them to ray 
  i can t do that 
  ma  you have to 
i m getting better  ray 
i go to group  i work with counselors now 
you said yourself 
you don t know
how long your rehab will take 
it s just a couple of months 
i ll be stable again 
fay needs someone right now 
not in a couple of months 
fay needs stability right now
and no one can give him that but me 
things will be different this time 
son  i promise 
mom   
we ve done this too many times 
but the reality is  you re sick 
and i pray every night
that the day you leave rehab 
you ll never go back 
but i can t keep risking fay s life
like this anymore 
it s not fair to him or me 
 ray sighs 
you ll always be his mother 
always be our mother  but   
you asked me to promise
that i ll always be there for him 
now i m asking you to be there for me 
sign the paper  mom 
sign the paper  mom 
where do i sign 
i ll leave you two alone 
 sighs 
you must be so mad at me 
can i have a hug 
 sniffles 
 softly  yeah 
 tonya sobbing 
i m so sorry i put you through all this 
i mma be all right 
i promise you  i mma be all right 
 knock at door 
coach 
hey 
come in  come in 
oh   sighs 
uh  sorry about that  coach 
sorry about that 
have a seat  have a seat  have a seat 
that s your speech for the hearing 
yes  sir 
 chuckles  not too sure what to say yet 
well  turns out it might not matter much 
simmons talked to mike ferro 
it s looking likely they re not gonna
grant your waiver  son 
i just wanted you to hear it from me 
i m still gonna go to the hearing 
not giving up until i hear it myself 
and something tells me
you don t know how to give up 
you know  press is having a field day
with this game saturday 
bowden bowl 
father versus son  all that nonsense 
the truth is 
when that game is over 
i ll meet my father mid field 
we re gonna hug 
and we re all gonna go out to eat 
 cause we re family 
that s what matters 
and i guess sometimes
i even take that privilege for granted 
some of the toughest men i know
could not endure
what you have these past few months 
you proved a lot of people wrong  ray 
including me 
 door opens 
 gate beeping 
 ray clears throat 
i m ray mcelrathbey 
i have a hearing today 
straight down the hall 
  thank you 
  mmm hmm 
 door opens 
 gate beeping 
man  petition will begin 
mr  mcelrathbey 
we have received your petition
for a waiver of ncaa rules
regarding assistance for you
and your brother 
and have reviewed it 
in addition to the petition 
you are entitled to a statement 
my   
 ray clears throat 
my brother and i
had it kinda tough growing up 
the kinda life that hardens you 
makes you think you don t need anyone 
that you could do everything by yourself 
i didn t have
a picture perfect family growing up 
it was always
just me and my little brother 
so  when i took fay in 
i figured that would stay the same 
i admit i underestimated
the responsibilities
of being a student athlete and having fay 
but the people in this room
kept telling me they would help
if i just let them 
i never wanted to be seen
as a charity case 
but i realize that wasn t true 
they saw me as family 
that s why they re all here
behind me today 
my coaches 
my teammates 
my community 
people i love 
clemson taught me it s okay
to open your heart and accept help 
everyone needs a little
every once in a while 
but believe me  i never meant to do that 
because clemson has given me
the opportunity to change my life 
and i never intentionally jeopardized
or hurt my school in any way 
but now i have to choose
between football and my brother 
so  before you make your decision 
i thought you should know
that i have already made mine 
 all murmuring 
waiver or not 
 gregory clears throat 
let the record reflect that
mr  mcelrathbey has given a court order
making him the permanent and legal
guardian of his brother  fahmarr 
there s no going back for me 
i m fay s brother 
his father  and anything else
he ll ever need me to be 
but these men are my brothers  too 
so  respectfully 
i ask you not to make me leave one family
so that i can care for another 
thank you 
the by laws require a majority vote
to approve a waiver 
 nay  to signify no waiver 
 yea  will support a waiver 
member davis 
a regretful nay 
gregory  mr  kolbrenner 
yea 
gregory  mr  johnson 
yea 
ms  o brien 
i m sorry to have to vote nay 
 all groaning 
 clears throat  well 
looks like i have the deciding vote 
but before i cast it 
let me just say that rarely
does the board
see such support for a cause 
and rarely do we have the pleasure
of hearing from such a dedicated
and impressive student athlete 
however  our emotions
cannot dictate our actions 
mr  mcelrathbey  what you are asking for
is unprecedented 
you want the ncaa
to allow a university and its community
to provide you assistance
so you can support
a member of your family 
and in this case 
considering the circumstances 
i find adequate justification
to create precedent 
my vote is yea 
 all cheering 
all donations will be administered through
a trust fund for fahmarr s benefit 
reasonable transportation
to and from school will be permitted 
after school care will be allowed 
 chuckles  congratulations  son 
 all clapping 
we ve been through a lot together 
i told you we d have to sacrifice 
both individually and as a team 
being selfless and committed
to what it takes to be a clemson tiger 
gentlemen 
you ve checked off every single box
a coach could ever ask for 
i wouldn t wanna run down that hill
with any other team 
fahmarr 
four and half  baby 
 all cheering 
 all whooping 
thank you  coach 
 continues cheering 
 all singing indistinctly 
player  that s right  that s right 
come on  come on 
whoo 
fay  take us out 
 crowd cheering 
let s go 
 both shouting 
bowden  one  two  three 
all  family 
 all cheering 
keller  let s go

let s play  let s play  let s play  yeah 
crowd   chanting  c l e m s o n 
twenty year old ramon mcelrathbey 
known as ray ray 
has been all over the news lately
for something he did off the field 
just last year 
he won a full football scholarship
to clemson university 
  but   
   audience clapping 
thank you for that 
but listen to this 
after his freshman year  troubles at home
brought him back to atlanta
to face another family crisis 
this fall  ray ray returned to clemson
with his little brother in tow 
now  mornings start at 6 30 a m 
ray ray gets fahmarr dressed
and off to school 
and then  he heads to class 
fahmarr is now a part
of the clemson football team 
ow 
oprah  he helps out in practices
and has become the unofficial team mascot 
 all cheering 
when they re losing 
i have to cheer them up 
or sometimes  i ll just give  em them
a pat on the back
if they re doing a good job 
the hardest part of being a parent is 
i guess  being a parent 
you re not the priority anymore 
oprah  but for ray ray 
the sacrifice is well worth it 
now  i really  really get the feeling
of how it feels to have a dad
that really cares 
and a dad that ll always be around 
oprah  last month  the ncaa
made a rare exception to the rule 
ray ray and fahmarr join us via satellite
from clemson university in south carolina 
thank you for joining us today  thank you 
 audience applauding 
yes  thank you  we ll be right back 
commentator  howard tries
to brush it aside  tries to cut back   
and finally  ripped down 
ray ray makes the play 
ray ray mcelrathbey 
and ray ray  earlier this year 
had to take in a younger brother  fahmarr 
and you just gotta applaud this young man
for taking over a tough situation 
female singer  i will trust in you
and know that you are with me
forever
i ll confide in you
 cause you re the only answer
that matters
even when in the darkness
you will be my light
even when i m hopeless
you will be my guide
i will not be shaken  i will not be moved
even in the chaos
i know that you re good
you re the keeper
protector
it is you that holds us together
when everything else fails us
it is you that holds us together
together   
holds us together
you re the keeper
protector
it is you that holds us together
when everything else fails us
it is you that holds us together
you re the keeper
protector
it is you that holds us together
when everything else fails us
it is you that holds us together
