a fi lm by miyazaki hayao
in ancient times the land
lay covered in forest   
   where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods 
rrincess mononoke
yakul 
ashitaka 
oracle says to get back to the village 
the old man  too 
  he says something s wrong 
  no birds 
no animals   
i ll go to him  you get back home 
something s coming 
what is it 
it s not a person   
oracle s called everyone in 
there 
a demon god 
yakul  run 
it ll attack the village 
ashitaka 
don t touch it  its
curse will be on you 
yakul 
quiet your rage  i beg you 
o forest god who cannot be without
name  why do you rampage so 
  a monster 
  run 
stop  do not destroy our village 
stop  still your rage 
get up 
  it s down 
  ashitaka 
bring oracle 
watch the fire 
ashitaka 
don t touch it  it s no ordinary wound 
he s hurt  where s oracle  
all of you  stay back 
oracle 
rour this water over it    slowly 
o raging god unknown to us   
   i bow before you 
where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites 
bear us no hate  and be at peace 
you loathsome rabble 
you shall know my hatred and my grief 
this is very  very bad 
the boar spirit came
from far to the west 
a poison within him goaded
him on  rotting his fesh   
   drawing evil as he ran 
making a monster of him 
rrince ashitaka   
show your right arm 
oracle 
rrince ashitaka  are you
steeled to gaze upon your fate 
yes  i was resolved
when i let my arrow fy 
the scar will seep into
your bones and you will die 
can nothing be done  
he was defending the
girls  and the village 
can we but sit and wait 
you cannot change your fate 
you can  though  rise to meet it 
look 
this was inside the boar s body 
he was in agony  it shattered
his bones  tore at his entrails   
what else could have made him that way 
calamity has befallen
the land of the west 
journey there  and see
with eyes unclouded 
there might be a way to lift the curse 
more than 500 years have gone since
the mikado drove us into this land 
now we hear how his power fades   
   and the fangs of
his shoguns are broken 
but the blood of our
tribe likewise grows thin 
and now  bitter fate    the youth
who was one day to lead us   
   must journey far to the west 
the law forbids that we
watch as you go  farewell 
brother 
kaya  you can t be here 
i don t care  remember me by this 
but it s your jeweled dagger 
keep it with you to guard you 
i ll think of you    be sure of that 
as will i  kaya 
fighting 
move up 
a warrior 
his head is mine 
stop 
my arm 
don t let him get away 
let me pass 
a demon 
the scar s growing   
this gruel tastes like hot water 
there he is 
will this do 
this isn t money 
give back my rice 
could i see that  please 
hm  
woman  this is pure gold 
is it coins you want  i ll pay you 
give me this 
is there a money changer here 
no 
i m just a simple priest  but i d
say this is worth three sacks of rice 
wait  young sir 
that s mine  give it back 
hey  don t be in such a rush 
no need to thank me  it s
i who should thank you 
i saw what you did before
against those samurai 
you fight like one possessed 
ah  you see those men  too 
keep your gold hidden  my lad 
hearts have grown hard
throughout the land 
they ll rob you in your
sleep  shall we run 
so the boar became a monster   
i tracked it back to where the
samurai attacked the village  but   
you lost it 
see over there 
when i was last this way 
there was a fine village here 
there was a food  maybe  or a
landslide  i m sure many died 
the land teems with the
twittering of bitter ghosts   
   dead from war  sick or starved
and fallen where they stood   
a curse  you say  this world is a curse 
ah  this is good 
i shouldn t have gotten into
that fight  i killed two men 
you saved me that task 
give me your bowl 
we all die 
some now  some later 
hm  an elegant bowl   
you remind me of the old tales   
a brave people  far to the east   
   who used stone arrowheads
and rode red elk        the  emishi  
first  though  avoid the jaws of death 
or so my old teacher used to say 
eat  my lad  it s your rice 
would you know what this is 
no 
it was in the body of the giant
boar  it s what killed him 
far to the west   
   deep in the mountains  is
the forest of the deer god 
there no man may tread 
the forest of the deer god 
they say the beasts there are
giants  as they were in ages past 
i knew he d go   
it s not far now  stay on your guard 
here they come 
the wolves 
calm the oxen  don t
rush  form your ranks 
keep your powder dry 
let them come in range 
number 1  fire 
number 2  fire 
they weren t much  as monsters go 
those were just the
pups  where s the mother 
it s moro 
come on 
got her 
she s a god  she won t die from that 
she did some damage   
move them out 
what about the ones who fell 
form up and move out 
he s breathing 
hang on 
i am ashitaka  i have
come from far to the east 
are you ancient gods of
the forest of the deer god 
leave 
a kodama  are they here  too 
you re hurt  keep still 
they won t harm you  they re
a sign the woods are healthy 
they ll bring their lord 
who  the wolf 
no  a huge monster 
it s gone 
yakul s not afraid 
there s no danger here 
we beg passage through your woods 
let s go back  rlease 
there s a trail across the river 
we ll never get through these woods 
the current s too strong 
and if we don t get this man
back soon  it ll be too late 
are you showing us the
way  or getting us lost 
sir  these things aren t
helping us get home 
there s more and more of them 
this is your mother  a fine tree 
that girl and the wolves   
so this is where they live   
we re getting in deeper  sir  this
way leads into the other world 
yes  let s take a rest 
tracks   
three toes    and still fresh 
sir  what s wrong 
are you all right  sir 
you re awfully pale   
i told you 
did you see something 
forget it 
hang on a little longer 
i m sorry 
it s gone   
why does he suddenly feel so light 
hey  it doesn t hurt 
i m cured  ow  no  it s broken 
sir  you re exactly right 
we re back at the ironworks 
it s a fort 
lady eboshi s ironworks 
they melt iron sand into iron 
hey 
hey 
  someone s coming from the woods 
  the wolf princess 
it s me  koroku the ox driver 
it s true  he s crossing the lake 
what s all this noise  
be quiet when i m writing 
koruku s come back from the dead 
what  
you re not a ghost 
  where are the others 
  four of you fell   
it s just us left 
it s never the guards that die 
move 
who s the man in the hood  sir 
an outsider   
listen  rifemen    this gentleman
carried your man all the way here 
thank him 
ow  don t grab me there 
hey  you  wait 
first  my thanks for
bringing back our men 
but something bothers me   
you got here in less than
half the time we did   
   through the deer god s
forest  carrying two   
koroku  you re alive 
toki 
look at that leg  how are
you going to drive oxen now  
but        but       
scaring me half to death  the
wolf god should ve eaten you 
then i could find a better husband 
toki  they re all listening 
toki  save your love talk for later 
and you  leaving them there to die 
some escort you are  you
don t do any real work here 
at least act when there s danger 
what could i do 
thank you  my husband s an
idiot  but i m glad he s safe 
good  i was afraid maybe
i d done something wrong 
you look very handsome 
show us your face 
gonza   
i would like to thank the
traveler  bring him to me later 
koroku   
it s good you re back  i apologize 
don t say that  milady  he ll
just take advantage of you 
forgive me  toki  i
shouldn t have let it happen 
if you hadn t been there  milady   
   the wolves would ve got them all 
go and rest  traveler 
hey  you are handsome 
we had to fight off moro to
bring this rice  you know 
dish it out 
where 
him 
toki was right 
  he is handsome 
  a bit young   
that never stopped you before 
quiet out there  we lost two men 
there s lots of handsome men here 
bunch of cowherds 
come over to our place  traveler 
forget this stinking barn 
watch your mouth  we risked our
lives to bring the rice you re eating 
and who made the iron
that bought that rice 
we work those bellows all night long 
i would like to see where
you work  if you don t mind   
really 
we ll have to work in make up 
rouge  too 
don t forget  we ll be waiting 
don t mind them  sir 
lady eboshi spoils them 
a good town has happy women 
but women working the
bellows in an ironworks 
their presence defiles the iron 
milady buys up the contract of
every brothel girl she finds 
she s kind  that s all 
there s rice on your face  old man 
but she s not afraid of
ancient laws  or of curses 
or of gods  either 
you should ve seen her with nago 
 nago  
a huge boar god  he ruled
the forest around here 
we couldn t get near the mountains 
all we could do was sit
here and look up at them 
the sand down below was worked out 
lots of people had their eye on
this place  the boars got them all 
to get sand  we have to clear the trees 
nago got mad 
there they go again 
then lady eboshi came
along with her guns 
sir  what s wrong 
does your arm hurt 
i was just thinking about that boar   
he must have died full of hate 
sorry to keep you waiting   
that s good iron 
we were late with tomorrow s shipment 
let s have a rest  tell the others 
some think you re spying for the
samurai  or the wolf princess 
many have their eyes on our iron 
may i ask why you re here 
i m sure you know this 
it shattered the bones of a giant boar 
rotted his fesh and made him a monster 
when i tried to stop him  i was left
with this scar  a curse unto death 
where is your land  i ve
never seen an elk like yours 
between north and east 
that s all i will say 
answer when you re asked
or i ll cut you in two 
what do you plan to do 
see with eyes unclouded 
 eyes unclouded  
i see 
come  i ll show you my secret 
milady 
take over  gonza 
my garden  where none dare come 
come  if you wish to know my secret 
good evening 
we ve just finished 
it s still heavy 
you hold it so lightly   
too light and it ll fall apart 
they aren t for me  they re
for the other women here 
won t that be a sight 
this is the new gun these
people have contrived 
the chinese ones are too heavy 
it will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor 
beware  lady eboshi
wants to rule the world 
i m sorry to rush you 
i ll send saké later 
won t that be nice 
you stole the boar s woods
and made a monster of him 
now will you breed new
hatreds with those guns 
i regret that you suffer 
i fired that shot 
it is me that brainless
pig should have cursed 
would your right hand like to kill me 
to lift the curse  my left would  too 
but i fear it would not stop there 
must it kill us all to be at peace 
milady    osa speaks 
milady    do not scorn
the young man s strength 
young man  i too am cursed 
i know well your rage and your grief 
i know this  but i beg
you not to kill this lady 
she is the only one who
looked upon us as human 
without fear of our disease   
   she washed our rotting
fesh  bandaged us   
osa   
life is suffering  it is hard 
the world is cursed  people are
cursed  but still we wish to live   
forgive my foolish raving   
they re back 
at night they come to plant
trees and take back the mountain 
ashitaka  will you stay
here and work with me 
do you want even the deer god s woods 
without the ancient gods 
the wild ones are mere beasts 
with the forest gone and the wolves
with it  this will be a land of riches 
that girl will be human 
who 
mononoke  the wild girl
whose soul the wolves stole 
she lives to kill me 
it is said the blood of the
deer god will cure disease 
it could cure these people  and
perhaps even lift your curse 
milady    what do you think 
very well made  rerfect
for ruling the world 
but it s still a bit heavy 
oh  dear 
look who s here 
let me work the bellows 
huh  hey  wait 
may i try 
if he insists   
you really came 
what did i tell you 
look  she s fixing her kimono 
you ll never keep that pace 
it s hard work 
yep  we work four days  straight 
is life hard here 
yeah  but it s better
than life in the towns 
we eat our fill  and
the men know their place 
i see   
  you go tomorrow 
  stay longer 
work here 
thank you  but there
is someone i must meet 
she s here 
the wolf princess 
it s her 
stop 
i don t want to fight you 
she s after milady 
build up the fires  rifemen to
the stockade  keep her inside 
stay at your posts 
she s up on the roof 
don t get excited  keep working 
the fire mustn t go out 
  is she alone 
  yes  we have her cornered 
it s milady she came for 
oh well    come on 
can you hear me  rrincess
mononoke  i m here 
if you would avenge your tribe   
   here are some who seek
vengeance for husbands   
   killed by wolves 
come out  we have a score to settle 
there she is 
out of the way  you ll get hit 
it s a trap  stop 
wolf god rrincess 
go back to the woods

i knew it 
let him do as he likes 
got her  she s falling 
stay back 
even cut off  the head can still bite 
aim where she falls

don t let her go 
kill her 
are you all right  sir 
out of my way 
villain  you re one of them  too 
halt 
step aside 
what are you doing  
the girl is mine 
i m sure she ll make a lovely wife 
there is a demon inside you  and in her 
look on this  it is the
form of the hate within me 
it rots my fesh  and summons my death 
do not make the hate grow 
enough talk of your curse 
i ll cut that arm off 
milady 
someone take her 
don t worry  she ll be all right 
i will take the girl 
wait  you don t treat
lady eboshi like that

i didn t want you to die 
i m not afraid to die if it
will drive the humans away 
i knew that when i first saw you 
you ve wasted your life
by getting in my way 
i ll cut your throat 
that ll shut you up 
live   
i don t listen to humans 
you re beautiful   
what s wrong  san  shall
i crunch him for you 
the apes   
apes  do you mean disrespect
to the tribe of moro 
this is our forest 
give us man 
give us man and go 
leave  before my fangs find you 
go 
we eat man 
we eat him 
let us eat man 
why would the tribe of the apes   
   want to eat a man 
we eat man  we have his strength 
we want strength to drive humans away 
you won t get that
power by eating a man 
all that will do is turn
you into something else 
we plant trees  humans destroy them 
forest does not come
back  we kill humans 
the deer god is with us  don t
give up  rlant your trees 
we will fight for you to the last 
deer god will not fight  we die 
wolf girl not care  wolf girl human

it s all right 
you go ahead  i ll
take care of the human 
what about him 
can we eat him 
no  go on 
come here  let s be friends 
help me carry your master 
you re smart  you know not
to set foot on this island 
humans stink 
go where you will  you re free 
there he is 
the night walker  at last 
quick  come and look 
there s why we ve been sitting
in these stinking bearskins 
don t look  you ll go blind 
this from the west land s best hunter 
this is a charter from the mikado   
   allowing us to subdue the deer god 
at night he becomes the night walker 
as night becomes day he changes form 
he s vanishing    over there 
jiko 
i know 
over there 
there s hundreds of them 
they re not from these woods 
they re lords of some other mountain 
it s okkoto 
from the south island 
there s no mistaking those tusks 
looks like he brought his whole tribe 
he s seen us  fall back 
come on  jump 
there s no wound 
yakul   
if you re awake thank yakul 
he watched you the whole time 
how do you know his name 
he s told me all about you 
your village  your forest   
the deer god brought you back
to life  so i ll help you 
i had this dream    a golden deer   
eat 
chew 
we re here to kill the
humans and save the forest 
why are there humans here 
the girl is san  my daughter 
the humans are everywhere  go back
to your mountain and kill them there 
we kill for the forest of the deer god 
why is there a man here 
the deer god healed his
wound  we must give him back 
the deer god saved him  the
deer god healed his wound  
why did he not save nago 
is he not guardian of the forest  
the deer god gives
life  and takes it away 
have you boars forgotten even that 
no  you begged the deer god for him 
you did not beg for nago 
he feared death    i  like him   
   carry within me a
poisoned human stone 
nago fed  i remain  and
contemplate my death 
go to the deer god 
i have lived long enough  san 
the deer god will take my life 
no  mother  you ve
protected the deer god 
we are not fooled  nago was beautiful
and strong  our brother would not run 
you wolves ate him 
silence  you slander my mother 
hear me  o wild mountain gods   
it was i who killed nago 
he had become a demon 
and attacked our village 
a huge boar  here is my proof 
i came to this land to ask the
deer god to lift this curse 
he healed my wound 
but the scar remains 
i must suffer until
the curse destroys me 
okkoto  good  someone who can listen 
okkoto  wait 
you mustn t eat him 
you are moro s daughter 
i have heard of you 
your eyes   
stand back  i will not eat him 
wolf god rrincess   
do not fear  i tell of nago s end 
my thanks to you  young one 
it grieves us that a demon
has come from our tribe 
lord okkoto    do you know
how i may lift the curse 
leave this forest  when next we
meet  i will have to kill you 
you cannot win against
the guns of the humans 
look on my tribe  moro  we
grow small  and we grow stupid 
to go on in this manner   
   is to end as game
the humans hunt for meat 
to risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands 
i ask not for the help of wolves 
should we die even to the very last 
we will leave the humans in awe 
the deer god 
keep the oxen together 
hold your fire    let them come 
fire 
reload  quick 
that damned eboshi s
fighting the wrong enemy 
you go on ahead and hide 
here they come 
chief   
well done 
we re moving out  tell the others 
hello  jiko 
the emperor presses  and you
sport with country samurai   
lord asano sets them against me 
asano  a powerful man   
he wants my iron 
greedy  isn t he 
but now is no time to fight men 
the boars are gathering in the forest 
give him the iron 
keep your promise to the
emperor  then smash asano 
quick  milady  asano s men are coming 
speak of the devil  a messenger 
a messenger  remember your manners 
welcome home 
aren t you going to see him 
eboshi  mistress of the
ironworks  you have fought well 
i bring a message from
my lord  open your gates 
we hear you fine from there 
milady took this
mountain from the boars 
now it s worth something
and you want it 
on your way 
you have no respect  woman 
no respect 
we haven t had respect
since we were born 
you want iron  have some 
they re really something 
samurai or forest god  they don t care 
eboshi s women don t lack courage 
what good is this paper 
well  it s helped in getting
the best hunters and trackers 
we re after gods  not just beasts 
yes  milady 
do you know who this paper is from 
the mikado 
  mikado 
  who s he 
the emperor 
they re really something 
off you go 
as we make iron here 
the forest grows weak 
that way costs fewer lives 
we ve spent too much time and money 
we didn t send 40
rifemen just for the iron 
so the emperor says  at least 
surely he doesn t believe that the
deer god s head confers immortality 
i m not privy to the
thoughts of the emperor 
eest not to be 
you have my word 
the boars will be easier
than moro and her tribe 
call out that shady bunch you ve
got hidden under the cliff 
so i m found out  am i 
one more thing   
did a young man pass by here 
riding a red elk 
he left 
they make my skin crawl 
they re not ordinary hunters 
they re special scouts 
let us go with you 
don t trust those men 
we can t help you from
here if anything happens 
we ve learned how to shoot   
that s the reason i want you here 
i fear humans more than forest gods 
with the deer god dead 
things will become clear 
is the deer god s head all
the emperor really wants 
we may have to fight the rifemen  too 
we can t trust men  stay on your toes 
don t worry about lady
eboshi  i ll protect her 
  you will  will you 
  what  
maybe if you were a woman   
does it hurt 
you could end it all
by jumping  you know 
when your strength returns 
the scar will grow restless 
i feel like i ve slept for days 
i dreamed san was tending to me 
i hoped you would cry out in your
sleep  so i could bite off your head 
a beautiful woods   
are the boars moving yet 
go back into the cave 
boy  you can t hear it   
the cry of the woods
trampled under by boars   
i sit here listening to it and
to the crumbling of my body   
   and wait for that woman   
   dreaming of the moment
i crush her head in my jaws 
can t humans and the forest
live together in peace 
can t this be stopped 
the humans are gathering 
their fire will reach even here 
and san  do you intend
to take her with you 
how like a human to
think only of himself 
she is a daughter of our tribe 
when the woods die  so will she 
set her free  she s human 
silence  boy 
what can you do for her 
the humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me 
now she cannot be human 
and she cannot be wolf 
my poor  ugly  lovely daughter   
can you save her  
i don t know  but together we can live 
how  will you join with san
and fight the human race 
no  all that does is cause more hatred 
there is nothing you can do  boy 
soon the scar will kill you 
leave here when the sun rises 
can you walk 
thanks to you and the deer god 
yakul  were you worried 
my legs are so weak 
it s so quiet    where are the kodama 
i can smell the ironworks   
thank you for guiding me 
i have a favor to ask you 
give this to san 
let s go 
what a stench 
that s not just smoke  it s
to blunt our sense of smell 
that woman 
she knows we re here   
  it s a foolish trap 
  a trap 
they re trying to lure
the boars out of the woods 
they re planning something 
we ve got to warn
them  they ll be killed 
okkoto is no fool 
the boars know it s a trap 
but still they ll charge 
they are a proud race 
the last one alive will
still be charging forward 
they re cutting trees 
to anger them 
mother  this is farewell 
the smoke will blind okkoto 
i will be his eyes 
as you will 
although there is a life
for you with that boy   
i hate humans 
from ashitaka  for me 
it s pretty   
you two go with san 
  i will stay with the deer god 
  let s go 
the tribe of moro fights
with you  where is okkoto 
thank you 
the ironworks 
let s go 
who goes there  
samurai 
halt 
let me pass 
who was that  
he s stopping them
