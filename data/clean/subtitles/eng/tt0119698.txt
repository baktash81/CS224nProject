a fi lm by miyazaki hayao
in ancient times the land
lay covered in forest
where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods
rrincess mononoke
yakul
ashitaka
oracle says to get back to the village
the old man too
he says somethings wrong
no birds
no animals
ill go to him you get back home
somethings coming
what is it
its not a person
oracles called everyone in
there
a demon god
yakul run
itll attack the village
ashitaka
dont touch it its
curse will be on you
yakul
quiet your rage i beg you
o forest god who cannot be without
name why do you rampage so
a monster
run
stop do not destroy our village
stop still your rage
get up
its down
ashitaka
bring oracle
watch the fire
ashitaka
dont touch it its no ordinary wound
hes hurt wheres oracle
all of you stay back
oracle
rour this water over it slowly
o raging god unknown to us
i bow before you
where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites
bear us no hate and be at peace
you loathsome rabble
you shall know my hatred and my grief
this is very very bad
the boarspirit came
from far to the west
a poison within him goaded
him on rotting his fesh
drawing evil as he ran
making a monster of him
rrince ashitaka
show your right arm
oracle
rrince ashitaka are you
steeled to gaze upon your fate
yes i was resolved
when i let my arrow fy
the scar will seep into
your bones and you will die
can nothing be done
he was defending the
girls and the village
can we but sit and wait
you cannot change your fate
you can though rise to meet it
look
this was inside the boars body
he was in agony it shattered
his bones tore at his entrails
what else could have made him that way
calamity has befallen
the land of the west
journey there and see
with eyes unclouded
there might be a way to lift the curse
more than 500 years have gone since
the mikado drove us into this land
now we hear how his power fades
and the fangs of
his shoguns are broken
but the blood of our
tribe likewise grows thin
and now bitter fate the youth
who was one day to lead us
must journey far to the west
the law forbids that we
watch as you go farewell
brother
kaya you cant be here
i dont care remember me by this
but its your jeweled dagger
keep it with you to guard you
ill think of you be sure of that
as will i kaya
fighting
move up
a warrior
his head is mine
stop
my arm
dont let him get away
let me pass
a demon
the scars growing
this gruel tastes like hot water
there he is
will this do
this isnt money
give back my rice
could i see that please
hm
woman this is pure gold
is it coins you want ill pay you
give me this
is there a moneychanger here
no
im just a simple priest but id
say this is worth three sacks of rice
wait young sir
thats mine give it back
hey dont be in such a rush
no need to thank me its
i who should thank you
i saw what you did before
against those samurai
you fight like one possessed
ah you see those men too
keep your gold hidden my lad
hearts have grown hard
throughout the land
theyll rob you in your
sleep shall we run
so the boar became a monster
i tracked it back to where the
samurai attacked the village but
you lost it
see over there
when i was last this way
there was a fine village here
there was a food maybe or a
landslide im sure many died
the land teems with the
twittering of bitter ghosts
dead from war sick or starved
and fallen where they stood
a curse you say this world is a curse
ah this is good
i shouldnt have gotten into
that fight i killed two men
you saved me that task
give me your bowl
we all die
some now some later
hm an elegant bowl
you remind me of the old tales
a brave people far to the east
who used stone arrowheads
and rode red elk the emishi
first though avoid the jaws of death
or so my old teacher used to say
eat my lad its your rice
would you know what this is
no
it was in the body of the giant
boar its what killed him
far to the west
deep in the mountains is
the forest of the deer god
there no man may tread
the forest of the deer god
they say the beasts there are
giants as they were in ages past
i knew hed go
its not far now stay on your guard
here they come
the wolves
calm the oxen dont
rush form your ranks
keep your powder dry
let them come in range
number 1 fire
number 2 fire
they werent much as monsters go
those were just the
pups wheres the mother
its moro
come on
got her
shes a god she wont die from that
she did some damage
move them out
what about the ones who fell
form up and move out
hes breathing
hang on
i am ashitaka i have
come from far to the east
are you ancient gods of
the forest of the deer god
leave
a kodama are they here too
youre hurt keep still
they wont harm you theyre
a sign the woods are healthy
theyll bring their lord
who the wolf
no a huge monster
its gone
yakuls not afraid
theres no danger here
we beg passage through your woods
lets go back rlease
theres a trail across the river
well never get through these woods
the currents too strong
and if we dont get this man
back soon itll be too late
are you showing us the
way or getting us lost
sir these things arent
helping us get home
theres more and more of them
this is your mother a fine tree
that girl and the wolves
so this is where they live
were getting in deeper sir this
way leads into the other world
yes lets take a rest
tracks
three toes and still fresh
sir whats wrong
are you all right sir
youre awfully pale
i told you
did you see something
forget it
hang on a little longer
im sorry
its gone
why does he suddenly feel so light
hey it doesnt hurt
im cured ow no its broken
sir youre exactly right
were back at the ironworks
its a fort
lady eboshis ironworks
they melt iron sand into iron
hey
hey
someones coming from the woods
the wolf princess
its me koroku the oxdriver
its true hes crossing the lake
whats all this noise
be quiet when im writing
korukus come back from the dead
what
youre not a ghost
where are the others
four of you fell
its just us left
its never the guards that die
move
whos the man in the hood sir
an outsider
listen rifemen this gentleman
carried your man all the way here
thank him
ow dont grab me there
hey you wait
first my thanks for
bringing back our men
but something bothers me
you got here in less than
half the time we did
through the deer gods
forest carrying two
koroku youre alive
toki
look at that leg how are
you going to drive oxen now
but but
scaring me half to death the
wolfgod shouldve eaten you
then i could find a better husband
toki theyre all listening
toki save your lovetalk for later
and you leaving them there to die
some escort you are you
dont do any real work here
at least act when theres danger
what could i do
thank you my husbands an
idiot but im glad hes safe
good i was afraid maybe
id done something wrong
you look very handsome
show us your face
gonza
i would like to thank the
traveler bring him to me later
koroku
its good youre back i apologize
dont say that milady hell
just take advantage of you
forgive me toki i
shouldnt have let it happen
if you hadnt been there milady
the wolves wouldve got them all
go and rest traveler
hey you are handsome
we had to fight off moro to
bring this rice you know
dish it out
where
him
toki was right
he is handsome
a bit young
that never stopped you before
quiet out there we lost two men
theres lots of handsome men here
bunch of cowherds
come over to our place traveler
forget this stinking barn
watch your mouth we risked our
lives to bring the rice youre eating
and who made the iron
that bought that rice
we work those bellows all night long
i would like to see where
you work if you dont mind
really
well have to work in makeup
rouge too
dont forget well be waiting
dont mind them sir
lady eboshi spoils them
a good town has happy women
but women working the
bellows in an ironworks
their presence defiles the iron
milady buys up the contract of
every brothel girl she finds
shes kind thats all
theres rice on your face old man
but shes not afraid of
ancient laws or of curses
or of gods either
you shouldve seen her with nago
nago
a huge boargod he ruled
the forest around here
we couldnt get near the mountains
all we could do was sit
here and look up at them
the sand down below was worked out
lots of people had their eye on
this place the boars got them all
to get sand we have to clear the trees
nago got mad
there they go again
then lady eboshi came
along with her guns
sir whats wrong
does your arm hurt
i was just thinking about that boar
he must have died full of hate
sorry to keep you waiting
thats good iron
we were late with tomorrows shipment
lets have a rest tell the others
some think youre spying for the
samurai or the wolf princess
many have their eyes on our iron
may i ask why youre here
im sure you know this
it shattered the bones of a giant boar
rotted his fesh and made him a monster
when i tried to stop him i was left
with this scar a curse unto death
where is your land ive
never seen an elk like yours
between north and east
thats all i will say
answer when youre asked
or ill cut you in two
what do you plan to do
see with eyes unclouded
eyes unclouded
i see
come ill show you my secret
milady
take over gonza
my garden where none dare come
come if you wish to know my secret
good evening
weve just finished
its still heavy
you hold it so lightly
too light and itll fall apart
they arent for me theyre
for the other women here
wont that be a sight
this is the new gun these
people have contrived
the chinese ones are too heavy
it will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor
beware lady eboshi
wants to rule the world
im sorry to rush you
ill send sak√© later
wont that be nice
you stole the boars woods
and made a monster of him
now will you breed new
hatreds with those guns
i regret that you suffer
i fired that shot
it is me that brainless
pig should have cursed
would your right hand like to kill me
to lift the curse my left would too
but i fear it would not stop there
must it kill us all to be at peace
milady osa speaks
milady do not scorn
the young mans strength
young man i too am cursed
i know well your rage and your grief
i know this but i beg
you not to kill this lady
she is the only one who
looked upon us as human
without fear of our disease
she washed our rotting
fesh bandaged us
osa
life is suffering it is hard
the world is cursed people are
cursed but still we wish to live
forgive my foolish raving
theyre back
at night they come to plant
trees and take back the mountain
ashitaka will you stay
here and work with me
do you want even the deer gods woods
without the ancient gods
the wild ones are mere beasts
with the forest gone and the wolves
with it this will be a land of riches
that girl will be human
who
mononoke the wild girl
whose soul the wolves stole
she lives to kill me
it is said the blood of the
deer god will cure disease
it could cure these people and
perhaps even lift your curse
milady what do you think
very well made rerfect
for ruling the world
but its still a bit heavy
oh dear
look whos here
let me work the bellows
huh hey wait
may i try
if he insists
you really came
what did i tell you
look shes fixing her kimono
youll never keep that pace
its hard work
yep we work four days straight
is life hard here
yeah but its better
than life in the towns
we eat our fill and
the men know their place
i see

youre smart you know not
to set foot on this island
humans stink
go where you will youre free
there he is
the nightwalker at last
quick come and look
theres why weve been sitting
in these stinking bearskins
dont look youll go blind
this from the west lands best hunter
this is a charter from the mikado
allowing us to subdue the deer god
at night he becomes the nightwalker
as night becomes day he changes form
hes vanishing over there
jiko
i know
over there
theres hundreds of them
theyre not from these woods
theyre lords of some other mountain
its okkoto
from the south island
theres no mistaking those tusks
looks like he brought his whole tribe
hes seen us fall back
come on jump
theres no wound
yakul
if youre awake thank yakul
he watched you the whole time
how do you know his name
hes told me all about you
your village your forest
the deer god brought you back
to life so ill help you
i had this dream a golden deer
eat
chew
were here to kill the
humans and save the forest
why are there humans here
the girl is san my daughter
the humans are everywhere go back
to your mountain and kill them there
we kill for the forest of the deer god
why is there a man here
the deer god healed his
wound we must give him back
the deer god saved him the
deer god healed his wound
why did he not save nago
is he not guardian of the forest
the deer god gives
life and takes it away
have you boars forgotten even that
no you begged the deer god for him
you did not beg for nago
he feared death i like him
carry within me a
poisoned human stone
nago fed i remain and
contemplate my death
go to the deer god
i have lived long enough san
the deer god will take my life
no mother youve
protected the deer god
we are not fooled nago was beautiful
and strong our brother would not run
you wolves ate him
silence you slander my mother
hear me o wild mountain gods
it was i who killed nago
he had become a demon
and attacked our village
a huge boar here is my proof
i came to this land to ask the
deer god to lift this curse
he healed my wound
but the scar remains
i must suffer until
the curse destroys me
okkoto good someone who can listen
okkoto wait
you mustnt eat him
you are moros daughter
i have heard of you
your eyes
stand back i will not eat him
wolfgod rrincess
do not fear i tell of nagos end
my thanks to you young one
it grieves us that a demon
has come from our tribe
lord okkoto do you know
how i may lift the curse
leave this forest when next we
meet i will have to kill you
you cannot win against
the guns of the humans
look on my tribe moro we
grow small and we grow stupid
to go on in this manner
is to end as game
the humans hunt for meat
to risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands
i ask not for the help of wolves
should we die even to the very last
we will leave the humans in awe
the deer god
keep the oxen together
hold your fire let them come
fire
reload quick
that damned eboshis
fighting the wrong enemy
you go on ahead and hide
here they come
chief
well done
were moving out tell the others
hello jiko
the emperor presses and you
sport with country samurai
lord asano sets them against me
asano a powerful man
he wants my iron
greedy isnt he
but now is no time to fight men
the boars are gathering in the forest
give him the iron
keep your promise to the
emperor then smash asano
quick milady asanos men are coming
speak of the devil a messenger
a messenger remember your manners
welcome home
arent you going to see him
eboshi mistress of the
ironworks you have fought well
i bring a message from
my lord open your gates
we hear you fine from there
milady took this
mountain from the boars
now its worth something
and you want it
on your way
you have no respect woman
no respect
we havent had respect
since we were born
you want iron have some
theyre really something
samurai or forest god they dont care
eboshis women dont lack courage
what good is this paper
well its helped in getting
the best hunters and trackers
were after gods not just beasts
yes milady
do you know who this paper is from
the mikado
mikado
whos he
the emperor
theyre really something
off you go
as we make iron here
the forest grows weak
that way costs fewer lives
weve spent too much time and money
we didnt send 40
rifemen just for the iron
so the emperor says at least
surely he doesnt believe that the
deer gods head confers immortality
im not privy to the
thoughts of the emperor
eest not to be
you have my word
the boars will be easier
than moro and her tribe
call out that shady bunch youve
got hidden under the cliff
so im found out am i
one more thing
did a young man pass by here
riding a red elk
he left
they make my skin crawl
theyre not ordinary hunters
theyre special scouts
let us go with you
dont trust those men
we cant help you from
here if anything happens
weve learned how to shoot
thats the reason i want you here
i fear humans more than forest gods
with the deer god dead
things will become clear
is the deer gods head all
the emperor really wants
we may have to fight the rifemen too
we cant trust men stay on your toes
dont worry about lady
eboshi ill protect her
you will will you
what
maybe if you were a woman
does it hurt
you could end it all
by jumping you know
when your strength returns
the scar will grow restless
i feel like ive slept for days
i dreamed san was tending to me
i hoped you would cry out in your
sleep so i could bite off your head
a beautiful woods
are the boars moving yet
go back into the cave
boy you cant hear it
the cry of the woods
trampled under by boars
i sit here listening to it and
to the crumbling of my body
and wait for that woman
dreaming of the moment
i crush her head in my jaws
cant humans and the forest
live together in peace
cant this be stopped
the humans are gathering
their fire will reach even here
and san do you intend
to take her with you
how like a human to
think only of himself
she is a daughter of our tribe
when the woods die so will she
set her free shes human
silence boy
what can you do for her
the humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me
now she cannot be human
and she cannot be wolf
my poor ugly lovely daughter
can you save her
i dont know but together we can live
how will you join with san
and fight the human race
no all that does is cause more hatred
there is nothing you can do boy
soon the scar will kill you
leave here when the sun rises
can you walk
thanks to you and the deer god
yakul were you worried
my legs are so weak
its so quiet where are the kodama
i can smell the ironworks
thank you for guiding me
i have a favor to ask you
give this to san
lets go
what a stench
thats not just smoke its
to blunt our sense of smell
that woman
she knows were here
its a foolish trap
a trap
theyre trying to lure
the boars out of the woods
theyre planning something
weve got to warn
them theyll be killed
okkoto is no fool
the boars know its a trap
but still theyll charge
they are a proud race
the last one alive will
still be charging forward
theyre cutting trees
to anger them
mother this is farewell
the smoke will blind okkoto

for you with that boy
