her being in such wonderful shape 
the cause of our trouble
was our inability to come up with a drug   
   short of paint thinner  that would be
at least somewhat novel to her system 
she s built up a tolerance to everything 
a tolerance 
she s taking her fucking afternoon nap 
shut up  lgby 
we re fine 
it s all the fucking tennis 
it s almost 6 00 
igby 
they ll do it  i don t know what it is 
but i know they ll do it 
 let s all drink to bay state  
 let s drink to julia  have you met her yet 
if she s anything like her sister    
we ll drink to johnny and julia and bay
state power and love and happiness and    
here you are 
for the love of pete

your mind last week 
 but i m not dirty

make you dirty for quite some time now 
but you do reek  darling 
of tobacco  from your   
   yellow toenails to your yellow fingernails
to your yellow teeth   
   to your yellow hair 
sorry to have offended 
me 
a piece of gristle 
not on an empty stomach  dear 
excuse me 
boys  your mother was quite right
to have chastised me 
good personal hygiene   
   is one of the most essential disciplines
a man can have   
   in this world 
chin chin 
don t indulge him anymore 
how can anyone be afraid of a clown 
just leave him 
c mon  old man 
this is no way to be on your birthday 
everybody s gone home 
there s nobody left downstairs 
it s just you and me  now 
hey 
it s just you and me  old man 
if heaven is such a wonderful place   
   then how was getting crucified
such a big fucking sacrifice 
mrs  slocumb 
it s wonderful to see you again 
i hope you drove 
no more beautiful place on god s earth   
   than connecticut at christmas time 
 oliver drove me down from the city 
 please 
congratulations on oliver 
i hear he s already established himself   
   as the cream of
the columbia freshman crop 
we do take a lot of pride
in seeing our boys succeed 
but of course  we re here to discuss   
   igby 
honor roll  you flunked everything 
not even a  d  in art this time 
 did you enjoy making me look like a fool 
 i dunno 
you don t know 
poor mrs  slocumb doesn t have a clue
what old lgby is up to 
 dithering  foolish lady  did you enjoy that 
 i dunno 
 i beg your pardon 
 no 
then what are you  a pathological liar 
i don t know 
you don t know  liar  you little liar 
how dare you  and where were you when
your brother was flunking out of school 
i was in college 
igby is not my fault 
did you even  for a second   
   think about how this reflects upon me 
no 
i am not going to go through this again 
you had a chance  you flunked everything 
that s almost impressive  it really is 
you know what s going to
happen to you now  mister 
do you know where your sterling
performance is going to take you now   
   iittle man 
choate 
 cadet report 
 oh  shit 
second watch is early 
lights out 
in your bunks 
you heard him  let s go 
all right  mr  patterson  lights out 
what part of  lights out 
don t you understand 
 turtle  the spray 
 ln your bunk  mistletoe 
all right  fredrick  you know the rules 
turtle 
both of you  lights out  in your bunks 
this is your godfather  igby 
are you listening to me 
this is the best thing that could have
happened to you  military school 
to get out of that comfortable world
you were raised in  strike out on your own 
you know those east coast country club
schools do you no good in the real world 
it might be tough now 
but it s gonna make you tough 
unlike the rest
of your coddled contemporaries 
fire 
and lgby goes down 
i bet you ve made some real buddies 
haven t you 
igby has buddies 
 haven t you got buddies 
 many 
you have that buddy
with the cute little name 
 that little buddy  tortoise 
 turtle 
turtle 
turtle 
he was my best buddy 
then his rifle backfired
and blew his face off 
we all learned a lesson
about weapon maintenance that day 
why didn t the school inform me 
it wasn t the school s fault 
they were great about it 
paid for the dry cleaning and everything 
not because they had to   
   but because it was the right thing to do 
i believe that certain people in life
are meant to fall by the wayside   
   to serve as warnings for the rest of us 
signposts along the way 
to where 
success 
our father would be a  slippery when
schizophrenic  sign  for instance 
along the highway of life 
this summer   
   i want you to come and work for me 
work with my crew 
renovate some of my new york properties 
you up to bein  exploited
by your old pal this summer

a teenager  bit of a problem 
every family has one 
what colleges are you lookin  at  son 
all of  em  really

georgie s favorite teacher from the academy 
who are you

i m in town for a little while   
   at the o hare hilton 
listen  what are you up to 
but i m an incredibly cool
and young teacher 
why  how old are you 
really 
you sound older than 11 
you re right  it s probably the cigarettes 
hello 
mimi slocumb  please 
this is she 
i m calling from the o hare hilton 
hi 
you can stand at attention there  slocumb 
what exactly
do you think you re doing here 
the ritz carlton was full 
you know i m very tense these days 
very anxious about all of lgby s trouble 
my son in drug camp  for god s sake 
and then you make me so very cross 
and i take the trouble to tell you
specifically what i require   
    a half a grapefruit and  
 mimi 
let s    
let s get off the maid 
help 
super cadet
has got this big smile on his face 
no one takes him seriously 
no one knows
that he s been expelled that morning 
they scream   
    jump   and surprise   
   he does a swan dive onto the pavement 
you can still see the stain in the pavement
where his head popped open 
every morning  i used that blotch to know
where to line up for breakfast formation 
do you contemplate suicide 
constantly 
you totally missed the point of my story 
 have l 
 completely 
it s about the hypocrisy of the place 
which i couldn t tolerate 
you let me do my job  and you do yours 
i m trying to fucking help you 
 you think i need help 
 apparently 
you think that i don t know
how to do my job 
no offense  but how good could you be 
working at this place 
you know  i can only be as effective
as you allow me to be 
just tried to help you with my story 
how did you feel about what the boy did 
i feel like he should ve really reconsidered
his fucking options  don t you 
 what are your options 
 i don t know yet 
who were you trying to hurt with the pills 
nobody  i was improvising as i went 
i actually didn t give it a lot of thought 
i think that you are much more aware
than even you realize 
yeah  well  you re an idiot  so  
what the fuck are you doing 
i don t like being called an idiot 
you prick  you can t fucking hit me 
next fall  you ll be starting
at yet another school 
are you gonna try to make an effort
this time around 
i m considering my options 
am i to understand you have four separate
doctors  all writing you prescriptions 
it s a point of convenience 
with no knowledge
of what the others are prescribing 
my dear man  i assure you 
i need my peppies 
perhaps if you cut down on the valium
and the sleeping pills   
    you d have more energy 
 without them i get very tense 
you get tense
because you pop speed like candy 
 bad mrs  slocumb 
 i beg your pardon 
patients actually tolerate
this cheeky little shit routine of yours 
find it cute  do they 
 mrs  slocumb  
 out 
 i m not well 
 you mean literally 
yes  literally  they ve run tests 
this doesn t seem so bad 
as nice a place as any to spend the spring 
round out your rough edges 
this ll do for ya 
i still want you
to come and work for me this summer 
stay with bunny and me
at the summer house  what do you think 
now  listen  the reason that mimi   
   your mother  hasn t been able to   
   visit you     i m sure she wanted to 
she went to the   
   hospital for a bit of a rest 
and they discovered something else 
something rather bad 
she s getting treatment for it  everybody s
damn confident she ll be fine  but    
you know what mastectomy is 
your house    
it s on the beach  right 
contract 
it s a contract  see 
families should be run like companies   
   with everybody s responsibilities
clearly defined 
children  at the age of reason   
   should be provided with legal
representation and a contract drawn up 
all the best relationships
are based on contracts 
bunny and i have a contract 
now that you re gonna come
and work for me   
   we re gonna have one 
and that piece of paper is your clean slate 
you know  you could just
take a later shuttle back to dc 
i m past the worst of it  i think 
i m meeting that dean
from st  anthony s  mckaye   
   in the morning 
to beg him to admit your brother this fall 
a mother s work is never done 
 d h  is collecting lgby today 
 yeah 
he s picking him up from  the camp  
what a great investment
that has proven to be 
getting to hear  for two months 
on a weekly basis   
   just how much my son hates me 
that s always been
one of his favorite topics of conversation 
his creation was an act of animosity 
why shouldn t his life be one 
listen  ollie  this summer  lgby s going to
bunk with you at columbia during the week 
you both can go to the hamptons
on the weekends 
of course 
i ll baby sit lgby all summer long 
you know  you have been
a very bad older brother 
and yet you re the one he hates 
basically  it s like reverse darwinism 
a situation in which
a less evolved species   
   is better equipped to survive
than a more evolved creature 
which  if you think about it 
isn t really reverse darwinism  so much as   
   bigger picture darwinism  if you will 
what 
 tommy 
 yeah 
what s happening 
did you hear that  we were out there for    
 what are you doing

  perchance to dream  
 he s done the protestant circuit 
mom must have some photos of the
head priest with an altar boy for them   
   to even be considering lgby 
 we re all at a bit of a loss as to  
 whenever i m at a loss  i dip into rilke 
rilke  that tortures me 
every christmas  some asshole
gives me this copy of young poet   
   with this patronizing note on the flap
about how it s supposed to change my life 
 maybe you should read it before judging it 
 i m pretty confident 
after all  one of the copies was from you 
i m oliver  and this is my little brother  lgby 
what kind of a name is  lgby  
it s the kind of a name that someone
named sookie is in no position to question 
sookie 
 where do you go to school 
 bennington 
ollie s majoring in neo fascism
at columbia 
 economics 
 semantics 
 what s your major 
 attitude 
 i ve gotta get back to the bar 
 that s where i m headed 
catch you kids later 
d h  brings you up a lot 
 captain charisma is my godfather 
 i know 
so  if something horrible  god forbid   
   were to befall my mother 
i would live with him and bunny 
 i know what godparents are 
 you re ripping apart my potential home 
 my being here offends you 
 your being here is great 
 i had no choice 
 no  really  i think you re great 
thank you 
it s him bringing you here that tortures me 
i love the fact that the captain
of the morality team invites his chick   
   to the same party as his wife  who isn t
the sharpest tool in the shed anymore 
and what s more  none of their supposed
mutual friends protects her 
none of them bats a fucking eyelash
at his hypocrisy  i love that  i really do 
embrace your moral hypocrisy 
d h  go for it 
 but me you re okay with 
 honestly 
listen  you know what 
if you re ever in the city 
you should pop by the loft 
we re done working on it 
i know 
no worries  mother 
igby is on his way to the airport 
the driver s been briefed
to take him directly to laguardia 
he ll be in st  anthony s loving custody
by this afternoon 
and happy birthday  mother 
much love 
sir 
it s my mother s birthday today  and i forgot 
is there any way that   
   we could just   
   make a quick stop
in the city somewhere  so   
   i can get her something 
she d be so surprised 
can i help you 
hey 
you remember me 
from the hamptons john birch cotillion 
yeah  how you doin  
come on in 
so  you said you d come by and you did 
a month later

 i love what the space has done to her 
 lgby 
 this is my friend  russel 
 hi 
 hi 
 lgby is d h  s    
 godson 
 russel s just  
 what 
he s just a brilliant artist 
so  what are you doing here 
celebrating 
st  anthony s accepted me 
congratulations 
i m on the lam 
 you want to stay here 
 lf there s enough room 
you can t stay here 
i don t even live here 
i rent this space to work in  i work here 
i pay rent 
d h  doesn t even know you re here 
it s kind of awkward 
great 
i don t know what you re gonna do 
because there isn t an extra key   
   and only d h  can get them made  so    
there s an extra key on the windowsill
in the hallway  the landing outside the door 
but it has to be here when d h  needs it 
 why would d h  need it 
 fuck you 
you can stay here for a couple days
and that s it 
contrary to popular belief 
d h  is my landlord 
i m an established artist  i work here 
my projects are supported 
i can t afford to fuck up my relationship
with my landlord  do you understand 
so  let yourself in and out   
   with the key 
but each time he reaches for it   
    it s there waiting for him 
 sure 
i don t wanna know you re here
or see any traces of you in here 
gotcha 
for a couple of days 
i m just gonna run to the bathroom 
so  you re an artist 
what kind of art 
what do you mean   what kind of art  
i mean do you paint  or what 
i got what you meant 
but you obviously didn t get what i meant 
an artist creates art 
regardless of what form the canvas takes 
 so  what do you do  paint 
 i m a performance artist 
so  you don t paint 
rachel thinks that d h  is going to   
    ieave his wifey and set up house with her 
 shut the fuck up  russel 
what do you think the chances of that are 
moneybuckets  take me away 
could you persuade your godfather
into letting me use one of his buildings   
   for one of my pieces 
 what would you want to do with it 
 i don t know 
russel is just  like   
   very brilliant 
 how old are you 
 i m 18 
i m very close to being 18 
 still no news on lgby 
 no 
he will turn up 
d h  is   
   spending more time in new york these
days than here in georgetown  so   
   he is bound to find him 
you know  listen 
i just want you to know that if you should   
   take a very bad turn   
   death  for instance    
not to worry about the boys 
d h  was so excited
about having them this summer   
   and  you know 
if we could be surrogates   
   and help the boys in any way 
you know that would make us very happy 
i just want you to know that 
not to mention the fact that he s    
over the years  he s invested   
   an awful lot emotionally
and  well  financially into the boys 
igby s tuition and such 
i mean  where else would you turn 
jason 
handsome 
 handsome  sad jason   
 shut up 
   who so depleted your finances
and your options 
i mean  the sacrifices
you ve made to the boys   
   i m just  well  how    
 how did you do it 
 stirrups and a turkey baster 
 bunny 
 yeah 
you are a feeble woman 
did i hear mimi 
she s just freshening up 
she s freshening up 
mimi 
did she leave  d h  
without saying goodbye 
she did leave a note 
of course she did 
sweet mimi 
can t you hit d h  up for some bucks 
i d ask him myself 
but i m not having sex with him 
 fuck you  get a job 
 please 
things have become fragile with d h 
what things 
me 
russel 
you re not even paying rent 
all you really need is pocket cash 
i have needs 
russel s always looking for assistants
for projects 
i m sure he d throw you work
as a favor to me  he loves me 
where the fuck are you 
on one of his artworks 
 shit 
 catch 
i know you  you re that boy
from the hamptons party 
iggy 
i met you at your uncle s party 
igby  he s my godfather  leave me alone 
igby 
what 
dime bag 
that got your attention 
pavlov s pothead 
i hear the sound of a bong clink
and my eyes begin to water 
that s funny 
thanks 
the park 
yeah 
you can t guard me  mindy 
c mon  where d it go 
oh  shit 
 you bitch 
 my ball  cuntface 
 are you a vegetarian 
 why would you ask that 
i ve just never seen anybody
roll a joint like that 
what does that have to do
with being a vegetarian 
they re just so precious 
i roll perfect joints 
 i m not putting them down  they re great 
 thank you 
it s incredible that a human being
could make such neat little joints 
you make it sound as if
i m anal or something 
 just because i can roll a perfect joint 
 not anal 
vegetarian 
what does that mean 
you don t roll
big rasta spliff joints  do you 
your joints are like salad joints 
not like a big   
   sloppy  bleeding cheeseburger 
that you rip into kind of a joint joint 
i guess marijuana
isn t a visceral experience for me 
 sex is for me 
 right 
okay  so i am a vegetarian 
but for purely moral reasons 
i thought you went to school
at brandeis or someplace 
bennington  i do 
 why aren t you there 
 i took a semester off 
i needed time to recuperate 
from what 
entenmann s cookies 
beer  diet pills  tension   
   iife 
my dad s been recuperating for six years 
what do you mean 
from life  nothing 
let s go 
you ve come a long way  baby 
you re funny 
hello  i m lt  ernest smith
from pershing academy 
 i m here to ask about a  
 those are fabulous 
 where did you get them 
 the army 
see  i m regular army 
mrs  slocumb found out
i was stationed in new jersey now   
   so she just thought that maybe lgby 
since he worked here this summer    
can i have these 
no 
i m asking about lgby slocumb 
anne frank  the soldiers are gone 
come out and play 
yum  with three  m s 
you have a huge crush on me  don t you 
fuck off 
how s your brother doing these days 
 i don t have a brother  i m an only child 
 oliver s your brother  i thought 
 he is  and yet    
 and yet what 
i was about to say that we were
both raised only children  but   
   that sounds like something
you would say 
what do you do 
i m preparing to leave 
where do you want to go 
far away 
i was thinking
about joining the peace corps 
go on my razor s edge experience 
discover the meaning of life 
whatever 
you need at least three years of college
to join the peace corps  don t you 
you do 
yeah  i had a friend at school who joined 
that could be a slight snag 
i haven t even gotten around
to taking my ged yet 
 so take it 
 i gotta go to hackensack 
so go  stop procrastinating 
it s almost christmas 
not going to new jersey isn t
procrastinating  it s common sense 
 do you want me to go with you 
 no 
i will 
all right  that d be great 
why aren t you in school now 
sheer ingenuity 
you re funny 
instead of saying
that someone or something is funny   
   why don t you just laugh 
 ls that better 
 much 
 gosh  i ve never been to a hideout before 
 shut up 
my boy   
   you look a bit   
   peaked 
i don t feel peaked 
say   
   give your    
give your mother a call 
let her know you re alive  yes 
you need to eat some red meat  my boy 
you re all pale 
i didn t know he was here 
the key was on the window 
we had lunch  i let him in 
how was i supposed to know that 
it wasn t my fault 
 we had an agreement  you fucked up 
 lt wasn t my fault 
you fucking idiot 
so    
i guess you have to pay rent this month 
rachel  stop 
she s a   
   dancer who doesn t dance  and   
   her friend is a painter who doesn t paint 
it s kind of a boho version of
island of the lost toys 
and she s a lot stronger than she looks 
i broke my butt 
you know what i think about
when i m this close to another body 
i think   
   one day   
   at one moment   
   this body that i m holding in my arms
will stop breathing   
   stop living   
   just   
   stop 
one day  you ll see my name in the obits
and you ll remember this moment 
you re a real fuckin  upper 
how did you end up at military school 
mimi 
 mimi 
 my mother 
you call your mother  mimi  
 heinous one  is a bit cumbersome 
right 
 medea  was already taken 
your mother sent you to military school 
in all fairness to her  i did get kicked out
of most of the schools on the east coast 
still  i just assumed that military school
was an empty threat  like with most parents 
she called that bluff 
do you resent her for sending you there 
i m glad i went 
it made everything clear to me 
like what 
the fight 
 15 minutes 
 okay 
downstairs  dressed 
waiting for your father  in 15 minutes   
   or you re taking the bus 
i know 
dad 
you see   
   igby   
   i feel this   
   great   
   pressure   
   coming down on me 
it s just constantly coming down on me   
   crushing me 
you make it sound sinister  that s
what good schools are for  to shape you   
   not brainwash you
in some evil  orwellian way  or   
   squash you
into something you re not  but    
i know my mother
teaches metaphysical poetry at vassar 
i really believe she tries  
my father went through the system and
it told him what he was supposed to want 
he achieved everything  and   
   then in his 40s  he flipped 
what did he really want 
sunny days 
now dad is in the maryland home
for the befuddled 
cuckoo for cocoa puffs 
so  you re never going back to school 
what are you planning to do with your life 
lgby  just kill time until  
my nervous breakdown comes along 
is your father dead 
no  why 
 cause when i talked about mine  you didn t
feel obligated to compare and contrast 
he s a theologian 
a jewish theologian
and a metaphysical poetess 
doesn t explain you 
what would 
cross dressing psychoanalysts 
heroin junkies 
 i don t know 
 thanks 
my parents   
   were two   
   very idealistic  incredibly bright   
   narcissists 
i was like their vanity project 
 oh  my god 
 what 
you torture me 
i was adopted  okay 
that would explain everything 
 cause  i mean 
how many vassar professors   
   and intellectual theologians
beget nymphomaniacal   
   pseudo bohemian j a p s 
actually  a lot  probably  right 
i m not a j a p 
 good morning  i m oliver  we met at the  
 right 
at that party in the hamptons 
 you re the fascist brother 
 he prefers  young republican  
i m sookie 
excuse me  i ve got to    
i m sorry 
 god  you re pathetic 
 thank you  fuckwit 
d h  told you i was here 
your little vacation s about to
come to a rather abrupt and severe end 
come again 
you re still a minor 
so 
since you re not interested
in taking care of your education   
   measures are being taken on your behalf 
what measures 
mom s coming up next weekend 
great 
 i m taking my equivalency test on friday 
 whatever 
i can vouch 
because i made the appointment 
 really 
 really 
oh  my god  it s almost the afternoon 
look  it was   
    nice meeting you  i m gonna take off 
 where are you headed 
my mom s  upper east side 
me  too  that s where i m staying 
amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics 
the geriatrics 
everyone s inferior to ollie in some way 
ask him  he ll tell ya 
let me give you a lift 
it s a write off for d h 
you can t pass up a free ride 
 friday 
 friday 
see ya 
it s not his real name 
he had a stuffed bear as a kid  digby bear 
they were british  i think 
and because he always got everything
wrong  he called it  lgby  
whenever he committed a crime 
he would say   l didn t do it  lgby did  
and to break him of this habit 
being as hip to child psych as she was   
   mimi started referring to him as lgby
every time he lied 
he lied a lot 
so  you work for your godfather 
igby s  d h   who is amazing 
his mind functions only to make money 
he thinks he has everything
he could possibly want   
   so he walks around acting the way he
thinks a happy and content man should act 
he s a parody 
 lf he s a parody  why do you work for him 
 he s an obscenely rich parody 
and if he wants to make me
in his image  hey 
what does your mother do 
she s a writer 
though mostly she just teaches now 
is she divorced 
never married 
 how come 
 doesn t like men 
 lesbian 
 no 
just a failed heterosexual 
listen  thanks for the lift 
shit 
what  did you lose your wallet 
i don t have the keys
to my aunt s apartment 
 the doorman won t let you in 
 he s totally senile  never remembers me 
i ll just wait for her 
wander around 
she ll be in this evening at some point 
 are you sure 
 yeah 
 could i use your phone 
 sure 
i mean  god 
can i get a receipt 
mimi   
   had been afraid someone
would find something embarrassing 
so up went her little soldier   
   while she waited downstairs 
this old lady led me to his desk 
and before she left me there  made sure
to give me a nice pat on the head 
i wanted to break her fucking hand 
so  i sat down in my father s chair
and i started looking in his desk 
each drawer that i opened was the same 
no books  no pencils   
   just row upon row
of meticulously stacked cigarettes 
thousands of them 
and all i could think was   
   not the extent to which
my father s sickness had damaged him   
   but rather 
 gosh   
    how would somebody do this without
anyone in the office being the wiser  
you know  not  my father s so far fucking
gone  he ain t never comin  back    
   but just 
 how the fuck
did he get all of these cigarettes   
    into this desk  
you were numb 
sookie   
   i am numb 
 everything all right here  folks  you okay 
 great 
excuse me  i m sorry 
do you want me to give this to you
or should i hang on to it 
i want you to pin it to my lapel
with my mittens and nametag 
 snippy  no bus ride treat for you 
 shut up 
you re being really immature about this 
if i m immature  you re prenatal 
god  to be impressed by that preppy prick 
we hung out  we re closer in age 
he s your brother 
you act like you hate him 
i do 
i do hate him  he s totally hateable 
evil  niblet fuck 
there s been a misunderstanding 
next fall is not good 
i need my son enrolled this spring 
have you spoken to his godfather 
d h  banes 
igby is his favorite charity 
he s sponsoring the boy  as in  financially 
what do we have to do  then 
to make it happen this spring

   he has agreed to admit you
after christmas 
 you ll be boarding there  
 i m not going back 
i passed the equivalency test 
i don t have to go back 
of course  i don t trust you with the train
fare  so if you just look up ollie   
   tell him that i will reimburse him
if he buys your ticket 
 i don t have his number 
 d h  does 
if it had just occurred to me
to mention it to ollie 
i saw him this afternoon 
for lunch  with his girlfriend 
in fact  you just missed him 
darling  by about   
   an hour and a half 
his connecticut one

 i didn t know he could get angry 
 he wasn t angry 
he felt obligated

your position as his prime punk 
i think if gandhi had had to hang out
with you for any prolonged period of time   
   he d have ended up
kicking the shit out of you

you think that he would bring you
back to our mother as a potential wife 
our mother 
she d be nice to your face 
but the first opportunity   
   she d pull him aside and warn him off 
 mongrel children have such
a hard time fitting in  dearest

he will use you up and marry some inbred   
   darien frau who will beget him

we re all hoping
that once he s healed from the accident   
   that he ll be able to   
   iead a fairly normal life
and be able to go back to a  
oh  no 
what happened 
apparently  as far as anyone can tell   
   he was 10 speeding a gazillion miles an
hour through central park   
   racing with all the other young turks 
he apparently caught his own reflection
in the handlebar mirror  and became so   
   aroused by it
that he burst his speedo shorts   
   which then got caught in the gears
and just threw him on his face  splatter 
luckily  someone had the presence of mind
to scrape his face off the pavement   
   and put it on ice 
 doctors were able to graft most of it back  
 i m sorry 
and you    
this is what you re up to 
bigger picture darwinism 
you two know each other 
wow 
igby slocumb was in my art class 
he was one of my students 
you used to call me miss piggy  didn t you

her one woman show wasn t terribly
well received at the pyramid tonight 
really 
the world isn t ready for peeka

 i told her 
lorna luft was just too fucking obscure 
people just think you re doing a bad liza 
 i love lorna 
 me  too 
your brother is looking for you 
your mom is dying 
yeah 
yeah 
you know what you have to think of it as 
what 
like an act of god 
if there were a god 
he d have acted a lot sooner 
 what 
 nothing 
 he left you a ticket 
 excellent 
it s non refundable 
he wanted me to tell you that 
dick 
i gotta take a piss 
toilet paper 
here

you re cute 
come on

what 
your poor mother 
i ve been hoarding seconal
like a proper junkie 
i m ready 
it s time to round up your brother 
what s this 
an ice cream sundae 
i accept 
i m going to dc this weekend
and kill my mother 
i m shocked 
ollie called me 
apparently  he called everybody 
stole your thunder 
asshole

 you re just angry and confused 
 oh  my god  don t do that to me 
 what 
 psych 101 me 
you re a furious boy  i mean 
eventually you won t be a boy   
    and it ll eat you up 
 furious boy 
the thought
that i m going to live my life without   
   ever having told her to fuck off 
is pretty goddamn infuriating 
do you hate my guts 
for a month i did 
now you re not even in my top five 
good 
i missed you 
my life is  i don t know 
i m drowning in assholes 
i m your friend 
listen  after    
i m not coming back  not to new york 
i know 
can we go to your mom s apartment
and have sex

you think that ll make you
feel better  it won t 
it ll just make you feel really empty and sad 
you re better off masturbating 
thank you for coming down 
didn t want to fuck up my inheritance  did l 
ollie has talked to you 
he explained what is to take place 
he said something about bludgeoning you
with a phone  but he didn t really   
   go into specifics 
the irony is that i took for granted
i d outlive you all 
you d think  in this family 
that i would be the least likely 
jason  happy as a clam 
he ll live forever in the institution  you  
you know  just because you re dying 
i m not going to apologize 
not for anything that i ve ever done 
why do you want me to be here  mother 
comic relief 
i m going for a walk 
 ollie  what are you drinking 
 scotch 
scotch 
 i guess d h  told you 
 what 
we ve decided to bump
all those incredibly prominent and   
   terribly chic persons that you were
expecting to speak at your memorial  and   
   have me speak for two hours or so 
what a clever idea 
you do understand  though 
don t you  that   
   it is customary in a eulogy to
at least make reference to the deceased 
i intend to  mother 
time permitting 
are we ready 
shall we do this 
you know  once we start  you must
get as much inside you as possible 
we ve been through this 
i don t want to have to do this again 
is that strawberry  i thought the idea was
to stop me from vomiting up the poison 
wait 
i take it you know d h  is your father 
no 
then i m really glad i told you 
make yum yum 
much love  all right 
c mon  wake up 
come on 
i m sorry 
listen    
do you wanna see the body
before they come to collect it 
i ve seen it 
excuse me 
hello  mrs  hathaway 
this is jason slocumb  jr 
i m afraid she can t 
 cause she s dead 
he s always enjoyed
being the bearer of bad tidings 
hello  mrs  bittle  it s lgby 
 lf you could sign this release 
 i d love to  mrs  bittle   
   but she s dead 
great job 
thank you 
aunt penelope 
 it s lgby 
 this all seems to be in order 
i m in washington 
this is for you and your helpers 
thank you very much 
that s very generous of you 
i m sure she d love to  aunt penelope 
except for one thing 
yes  aunt penelope  i m sure she was 
tuesday 
thank you 
bye bye 
it s ironic   
   that the first time
in my entire life that i feel   
   remotely affectionate toward her
is when she s dead 
you beat up her corpse 
after that 
the service is in two days 
you can stay in your old room 
you killed her  you bury her 
i m joking 
listen  i ve got this discount fare  and   
   it d be kinda hypocritical of me 
you know 
 you ll handle it like everything else  right 
 right 
you should hate me 
i don t 
 you should 
 i don t hate you 
don t be indulgent 
never that 
 you re going to california 
 yep  the sunshine state 
actually  florida s the sunshine state 
really 
three thousand fuckin  miles
away from here 
is there a number where we can reach you 
we  no 
you ll call when there is
