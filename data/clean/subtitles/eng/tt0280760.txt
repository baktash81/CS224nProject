her being in such wonderful shape
the cause of our trouble
was our inability to come up with a drug
short of paint thinner that would be
at least somewhat novel to her system
shes built up a tolerance to everything
a tolerance
shes taking her fucking afternoon nap
shut up lgby

of tobacco from your
yellow toenails to your yellow fingernails
to your yellow teeth
to your yellow hair
sorry to have offended

a piece of gristle

to have chastised me
good personal hygiene
is one of the most essential disciplines
a man can have
in this world
chinchin

everybodys gone home

if heaven is such a wonderful place
then how was getting crucified
such a big fucking sacrifice
mrs slocumb
its wonderful to see you again
i hope you drove
no more beautiful place on gods earth
than connecticut at christmas time
oliver drove me down from the city
please
congratulations on oliver
i hear hes already established himself
as the cream of
the columbia freshman crop
we do take a lot of pride
in seeing our boys succeed
but of course were here to discuss
igby
honor roll you flunked everything
not even a d in art this time
did you enjoy making me look like a fool
i dunno
you dont know
poor mrs slocumb doesnt have a clue
what old lgby is up to
dithering foolish lady did you enjoy that
i dunno
i beg your pardon
no
then what are you a pathological liar
i dont know
you dont know liar you little liar
how dare you and where were you when
your brother was flunking out of school
i was in college
igby is not my fault
did you even for a second
think about how this reflects upon me
no
i am not going to go through this again
you had a chance you flunked everything
thats almost impressive it really is
you know whats going to
happen to you now mister
do you know where your sterling
performance is going to take you now
iittle man
choate
cadet report
oh shit
second watch is early
lights out
in your bunks
you heard him lets go
all right mr patterson lights out
what part of lights out
dont you understand
turtle the spray
ln your bunk mistletoe
all right fredrick you know the rules
turtle
both of you lights out in your bunks
this is your godfather igby
are you listening to me
this is the best thing that could have
happened to you military school
to get out of that comfortable world
you were raised in strike out on your own
you know those east coast country club
schools do you no good in the real world
it might be tough now
but its gonna make you tough
unlike the rest
of your coddled contemporaries
fire
and lgby goes down
i bet youve made some real buddies
havent you
igby has buddies
havent you got buddies
many
you have that buddy
with the cute little name
that little buddy tortoise
turtle
turtle
turtle
he was my best buddy
then his rifle backfired
and blew his face off
we all learned a lesson
about weapon maintenance that day
why didnt the school inform me
it wasnt the schools fault
they were great about it
paid for the drycleaning and everything
not because they had to
but because it was the right thing to do
i believe that certain people in life
are meant to fall by the wayside
to serve as warnings for the rest of us
signposts along the way
to where
success
our father would be a slippery when
schizophrenic sign for instance
along the highway of life
this summer
i want you to come and work for me
work with my crew
renovate some of my new york properties
you up to bein exploited
by your old pal this summer

the bearer of this letter
has permission to use my credit card

that is so typical
ln town looking at schools are you
colleges
she had to fly home i have a brother
a teenager bit of a problem
every family has one
what colleges are you lookin at son
all of em really
just so long as its here
here in the midwest

georgies favorite teacher from the academy

im in town for a little while
at the ohare hilton
listen what are you up to
but im an incredibly cool
and young teacher
why how old are you
really
you sound older than 11
youre right its probably the cigarettes
hello
mimi slocumb please
this is she
im calling from the ohare hilton
hi
you can stand at attention there slocumb
what exactly
do you think youre doing here
the ritzcarlton was full
you know im very tense these days
very anxious about all of lgbys trouble
my son in drug camp for gods sake
and then you make me so very cross
and i take the trouble to tell you
specifically what i require
a half a grapefruit and
mimi
lets
lets get off the maid
help
super cadet
has got this big smile on his face
no one takes him seriously
no one knows
that hes been expelled that morning
they scream
jump and surprise
he does a swan dive onto the pavement
you can still see the stain in the pavement
where his head popped open
every morning i used that blotch to know
where to line up for breakfast formation
do you contemplate suicide
constantly
you totally missed the point of my story
have l
completely
its about the hypocrisy of the place
which i couldnt tolerate
you let me do my job and you do yours
im trying to fucking help you
you think i need help
apparently
you think that i dont know
how to do my job
no offense but how good could you be
working at this place
you know i can only be as effective
as you allow me to be
just tried to help you with my story
how did you feel about what the boy did
i feel like he shouldve really reconsidered
his fucking options dont you
what are your options
i dont know yet
who were you trying to hurt with the pills
nobody i was improvising as i went
i actually didnt give it a lot of thought
i think that you are much more aware
than even you realize
yeah well youre an idiot so
what the fuck are you doing
i dont like being called an idiot
you prick you cant fucking hit me
next fall youll be starting
at yet another school
are you gonna try to make an effort
this time around
im considering my options
am i to understand you have four separate
doctors all writing you prescriptions
its a point of convenience
with no knowledge
of what the others are prescribing
my dear man i assure you
i need my peppies
perhaps if you cut down on the valium
and the sleeping pills
youd have more energy
without them i get very tense
you get tense
because you pop speed like candy
bad mrs slocumb
i beg your pardon
patients actually tolerate
this cheekylittleshit routine of yours
find it cute do they
mrs slocumb
out
im not well
you mean literally
yes literally theyve run tests
this doesnt seem so bad
as nice a place as any to spend the spring
round out your rough edges
thisll do for ya
i still want you
to come and work for me this summer
stay with bunny and me
at the summer house what do you think
now listen the reason that mimi
your mother hasnt been able to
visit you im sure she wanted to
she went to the
hospital for a bit of a rest
and they discovered something else
something rather bad
shes getting treatment for it everybodys
damn confident shell be fine but
you know what mastectomy is
your house
its on the beach right
contract
its a contract see
families should be run like companies
with everybodys responsibilities
clearly defined
children at the age of reason
should be provided with legal
representation and a contract drawn up
all the best relationships
are based on contracts
bunny and i have a contract
now that youre gonna come
and work for me
were gonna have one
and that piece of paper is your clean slate
you know you could just
take a later shuttle back to dc
im past the worst of it i think
im meeting that dean
from st anthonys mckaye
in the morning
to beg him to admit your brother this fall
a mothers work is never done
dh is collecting lgby today
yeah
hes picking him up from the camp
what a great investment
that has proven to be
getting to hear for two months
on a weekly basis
just how much my son hates me
thats always been
one of his favorite topics of conversation
his creation was an act of animosity
why shouldnt his life be one
listen ollie this summer lgbys going to
bunk with you at columbia during the week
you both can go to the hamptons
on the weekends
of course
ill babysit lgby all summer long
you know you have been
a very bad older brother
and yet youre the one he hates
basically its like reverse darwinism
a situation in which
a less evolved species
is better equipped to survive
than a more evolved creature
which if you think about it
isnt really reverse darwinism so much as
biggerpicture darwinism if you will
what
tommy

head priest with an altar boy for them
to even be considering lgby
were all at a bit of a loss as to
whenever im at a loss i dip into rilke
rilke that tortures me
every christmas some asshole
gives me this copy of young poet
with this patronizing note on the flap
about how its supposed to change my life
maybe you should read it before judging it
im pretty confident
after all one of the copies was from you
im oliver and this is my little brother lgby
what kind of a name is lgby
its the kind of a name that someone
named sookie is in no position to question
sookie

ollies majoring in neofascism
at columbia
economics
semantics
whats your major
attitude
ive gotta get back to the bar

dh brings you up a lot
captain charisma is my godfather

so if something horrible god forbid
were to befall my mother
i would live with him and bunny
i know what godparents are
youre ripping apart my potential home
my being here offends you
your being here is great
i had no choice
no really i think youre great
thank you
its him bringing you here that tortures me
i love the fact that the captain
of the morality team invites his chick
to the same party as his wife who isnt
the sharpest tool in the shed anymore
and whats more none of their supposed
mutual friends protects her
none of them bats a fucking eyelash
at his hypocrisy i love that i really do
embrace your moral hypocrisy
dh go for it
but me youre okay with
honestly

if youre ever in the city
you should pop by the loft
were done working on it
i know

i love what the space has done to her
lgby
this is my friend russel
hi
hi
lgby is dhs
godson
russels just
what
hes just a brilliant artist
so what are you doing here
celebrating
st anthonys accepted me
congratulations
im on the lam
you want to stay here
lf theres enough room
you cant stay here
i dont even live here
i rent this space to work in i work here
i pay rent
dh doesnt even know youre here
its kind of awkward
great
i dont know what youre gonna do
because there isnt an extra key
and only dh can get them made so
theres an extra key on the windowsill
in the hallway the landing outside the door
but it has to be here when dh needs it
why would dh need it
fuck you
you can stay here for a couple days
and thats it
contrary to popular belief
dh is my landlord
im an established artist i work here
my projects are supported
i cant afford to fuck up my relationship
with my landlord do you understand
so let yourself in and out
with the key
but each time he reaches for it
its there waiting for him
sure
i dont wanna know youre here
or see any traces of you in here
gotcha
for a couple of days
im just gonna run to the bathroom
so youre an artist
what kind of art
what do you mean what kind of art
i mean do you paint or what
i got what you meant
but you obviously didnt get what i meant
an artist creates art
regardless of what form the canvas takes
so what do you do paint
im a performance artist
so you dont paint
rachel thinks that dh is going to
ieave his wifey and set up house with her
shut the fuck up russel
what do you think the chances of that are
moneybuckets take me away
could you persuade your godfather
into letting me use one of his buildings
for one of my pieces
what would you want to do with it
i dont know
russel is just like
very brilliant
how old are you
im 18
im very close to being 18
still no news on lgby
no
he will turn up
dh is
spending more time in new york these
days than here in georgetown so
he is bound to find him
you know listen
i just want you to know that if you should
take a very bad turn
death for instance
not to worry about the boys
dh was so excited
about having them this summer
and you know
if we could be surrogates
and help the boys in any way
you know that would make us very happy
i just want you to know that
not to mention the fact that hes
over the years hes invested
an awful lot emotionally
and well financially into the boys
igbys tuition and such
i mean where else would you turn
jason
handsome
handsome sad jason
shut up
who so depleted your finances
and your options
i mean the sacrifices
youve made to the boys
im just well how
how did you do it
stirrups and a turkey baster
bunny
yeah
you are a feeble woman
did i hear mimi
shes just freshening up
shes freshening up
mimi
did she leave dh
without saying goodbye
she did leave a note
of course she did
sweet mimi
cant you hit dh up for some bucks
id ask him myself

my ball cuntface

why would you ask that
ive just never seen anybody
roll a joint like that
what does that have to do
with being a vegetarian
theyre just so precious
i roll perfect joints
im not putting them down theyre great
thank you
its incredible that a human being
could make such neat little joints
you make it sound as if
im anal or something
just because i can roll a perfect joint
not anal
vegetarian
what does that mean
you dont roll
big rasta spliff joints do you
your joints are like salad joints
not like a big
sloppy bleedingcheeseburger
thatyouripintokindofajoint joint
i guess marijuana
isnt a visceral experience for me
sex is for me
right
okay so i am a vegetarian
but for purely moral reasons
i thought you went to school
at brandeis or someplace
bennington i do
why arent you there
i took a semester off
i needed time to recuperate
from what
entenmanns cookies
beer diet pills tension
iife
my dads been recuperating for six years

hello im lt ernest smith
from pershing academy
im here to ask about a
those are fabulous
where did you get them

im asking about lgby slocumb
anne frank the soldiers are gone

yum with three ms
you have a huge crush on me dont you
fuck off
hows your brother doing these days
i dont have a brother im an only child
olivers your brother i thought
he is and yet
and yet what
i was about to say that we were
both raised only children but
that sounds like something
you would say
what do you do
im preparing to leave
where do you want to go
far away
i was thinking
about joining the peace corps
go on my razors edge experience
discover the meaning of life
whatever
you need at least three years of college
to join the peace corps dont you
you do
yeah i had a friend at school who joined
that could be a slight snag
i havent even gotten around
to taking my ged yet
so take it
i gotta go to hackensack
so go stop procrastinating
its almost christmas
not going to new jersey isnt
procrastinating its common sense
do you want me to go with you
no
i will
all right thatd be great
why arent you in school now
sheer ingenuity
youre funny
instead of saying
that someone or something is funny
why dont you just laugh
ls that better
much
gosh ive never been to a hideout before
shut up
my boy
you look a bit
peaked
i dont feel peaked
say
give your
give your mother a call
let her know youre alive yes
you need to eat some red meat my boy
youre all pale
i didnt know he was here
the key was on the window

we had an agreement you fucked up
lt wasnt my fault
you fucking idiot
so
i guess you have to pay rent this month
rachel stop
shes a
dancer who doesnt dance and
her friend is a painter who doesnt paint
its kind of a boho version of
island of the lost toys
and shes a lot stronger than she looks
i broke my butt
you know what i think about
when im this close to another body
i think
one day
at one moment
this body that im holding in my arms
will stop breathing
stop living
just
stop
one day youll see my name in the obits
and youll remember this moment
youre a real fuckin upper
how did you end up at military school
mimi
mimi
my mother
you call your mother mimi
heinous one is a bit cumbersome
right
medea was already taken
your mother sent you to military school
in all fairness to her i did get kicked out
of most of the schools on the east coast
still i just assumed that military school
was an empty threat like with most parents
she called that bluff
do you resent her for sending you there
im glad i went
it made everything clear to me
like what
the fight
15 minutes
okay
downstairs dressed
waiting for your father in 15 minutes
or youre taking the bus
i know
dad
you see
igby
i feel this
great
pressure
coming down on me
its just constantly coming down on me
crushing me
you make it sound sinister thats
what good schools are for to shape you
not brainwash you
in some evil orwellian way or
squash you
into something youre not but
i know my mother
teaches metaphysical poetry at vassar
i really believe she tries
my father went through the system and
it told him what he was supposed to want
he achieved everything and
then in his 40s he flipped
what did he really want
sunny days
now dad is in the maryland home
for the befuddled
cuckoo for cocoa puffs
so youre never going back to school
what are you planning to do with your life
lgby just kill time until
my nervous breakdown comes along
is your father dead
no why
cause when i talked about mine you didnt
feel obligated to compare and contrast
hes a theologian
a jewish theologian
and a metaphysical poetess
doesnt explain you
what would
crossdressing psychoanalysts
heroin junkies
i dont know
thanks
my parents
were two
very idealistic incredibly bright
narcissists
i was like their vanity project
oh my god
what
you torture me
i was adopted okay
that would explain everything
cause i mean
how many vassar professors
and intellectual theologians
beget nymphomaniacal
pseudobohemian japs
actually a lot probably right
im not a jap
good morning im oliver we met at the
right
at that party in the hamptons
youre the fascist brother
he prefers young republican
im sookie
excuse me ive got to
im sorry
god youre pathetic
thank you fuckwit
dh told you i was here
your little vacations about to
come to a rather abrupt and severe end
come again
youre still a minor
so
since youre not interested
in taking care of your education
measures are being taken on your behalf
what measures
moms coming up next weekend
great
im taking my equivalency test on friday
whatever
i can vouch
because i made the appointment
really
really
oh my god its almost the afternoon
look it was
nice meeting you im gonna take off
where are you headed
my moms upper east side
me too thats where im staying
amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics
the geriatrics
everyones inferior to ollie in some way
ask him hell tell ya
let me give you a lift
its a writeoff for dh
you cant pass up a free ride
friday
friday
see ya
its not his real name
he had a stuffed bear as a kid digby bear
they were british i think
and because he always got everything
wrong he called it lgby
whenever he committed a crime
he would say l didnt do it lgby did
and to break him of this habit
being as hip to child psych as she was
mimi started referring to him as lgby
every time he lied
he lied a lot
so you work for your godfather
igbys dh who is amazing
his mind functions only to make money
he thinks he has everything
he could possibly want
so he walks around acting the way he
thinks a happy and content man should act
hes a parody
lf hes a parody why do you work for him
hes an obscenely rich parody
and if he wants to make me
in his image hey
what does your mother do
shes a writer
though mostly she just teaches now
is she divorced
never married
how come
doesnt like men
lesbian
no
just a failed heterosexual
listen thanks for the lift
shit
what did you lose your wallet
i dont have the keys
to my aunts apartment
the doorman wont let you in
hes totally senile never remembers me
ill just wait for her
wander around
shell be in this evening at some point
are you sure
yeah
could i use your phone
sure
i mean god
can i get a receipt
mimi
had been afraid someone
would find something embarrassing
so up went her little soldier
while she waited downstairs
this old lady led me to his desk
and before she left me there made sure
to give me a nice pat on the head
i wanted to break her fucking hand
so i sat down in my fathers chair
and i started looking in his desk
each drawer that i opened was the same
no books no pencils
just row upon row
of meticulously stacked cigarettes
thousands of them
and all i could think was
not the extent to which
my fathers sickness had damaged him
but rather
gosh
how would somebody do this without
anyone in the office being the wiser
you know not my fathers so far fucking
gone he aint never comin back
but just
how the fuck
did he get all of these cigarettes
into this desk
you were numb
sookie
i am numb
everything all right here folks you okay
great
excuse me im sorry
do you want me to give this to you
or should i hang on to it
i want you to pin it to my lapel
with my mittens and nametag
snippy no busride treat for you

oh no
what happened
apparently as far as anyone can tell
he was 10speeding a gazillion miles an
hour through central park
racing with all the other young turks
he apparently caught his own reflection
in the handlebar mirror and became so
aroused by it
that he burst his speedo shorts
which then got caught in the gears
and just threw him on his face splatter
luckily someone had the presence of mind
to scrape his face off the pavement
and put it on ice
doctors were able to graft most of it back

im your friend
listen after
im not coming back not to new york

thank you for coming down
didnt want to fuck up my inheritance did l
ollie has talked to you
he explained what is to take place
he said something about bludgeoning you
with a phone but he didnt really
go into specifics
the irony is that i took for granted
id outlive you all
youd think in this family
that i would be the least likely
jason happy as a clam
hell live forever in the institution you
you know just because youre dying
im not going to apologize
not for anything that ive ever done
why do you want me to be here mother
comic relief
im going for a walk
ollie what are you drinking
scotch
scotch
i guess dh told you
what
weve decided to bump
all those incredibly prominent and
terribly chic persons that you were
expecting to speak at your memorial and
have me speak for two hours or so
what a clever idea
you do understand though
dont you that
it is customary in a eulogy to
at least make reference to the deceased
i intend to mother
time permitting
are we ready
shall we do this
you know once we start you must
get as much inside you as possible
weve been through this
i dont want to have to do this again
is that strawberry i thought the idea was
to stop me from vomiting up the poison
wait
i take it you know dh is your father
no
then im really glad i told you
make yumyum
much love all right
cmon wake up
come on
im sorry
listen
do you wanna see the body
before they come to collect it
ive seen it
excuse me
hello mrs hathaway
this is jason slocumb jr
im afraid she cant
cause shes dead
hes always enjoyed
being the bearer of bad tidings
hello mrs bittle its lgby
lf you could sign this release
id love to mrs bittle
but shes dead
great job
thank you
aunt penelope
its lgby

except for one thing
yes aunt penelope im sure she was
tuesday
thank you
byebye
its ironic
that the first time
in my entire life that i feel
remotely affectionate toward her
is when shes dead
you beat up her corpse
after that
the service is in two days
you can stay in your old room
you killed her you bury her
im joking
listen ive got this discount fare and
itd be kinda hypocritical of me
you know
youll handle it like everything else right
right
you should hate me
i dont
you should
i dont hate you
dont be indulgent
never that
youre going to california
yep the sunshine state
actually floridas the sunshine state
really
three thousand fuckin miles
away from here
is there a number where we can reach you
