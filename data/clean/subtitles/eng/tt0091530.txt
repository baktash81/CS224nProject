by the spanish and portuguese settlers 
i don t think that s hitting
the right note  begin again 
your holiness  l write to you
in this year of our lord 1 758     
     from the southern continent of the
americas  from the town of asuncion     
     two weeks  march from
the great mission of san miguel 
these missions have protected the lndians
from the depredations of the settlers   
   and have earned much resentment
because of it 
the noble souls of these lndians
incline towards music 
indeed  many a violin played
in the academies of rome   
   have been made
by their nimble and gifted hands 
it was from these missions the jesuit
fathers carried the word of god   
    to those lndians still
existing in their natural state   
   and received in return   martyrdom 
the death of this priest
was to form the first link   
   in the chain of which
l now find myself a part 
continue 
as your holiness undoubtedly knows     
     iittle in this world
unfolds as we predict 
how could the lndians have supposed
that the death of that unsung priest     
    would bring among them a man whose life
was to become intertwined with their own 
thank you  father 
it was our territory 
julien s and mine 
i sent him  father 
i have to go up there myself 
can you see him 
no 
with an orchestra  the jesuits could
have subdued the whole continent 
so it was that the guarani
were brought finally to account   
    to the everlasting mercy of god   
   and to the short lived
mercy of man 
who are you 
so you re hunting above the falls now 
captain mendoza 
we re building a mission here 
 we ll make christians of these people 
 if you have the time 
it s your brother 
 alonzo  are they healthy 
 excellent 
good 
 are there many above the falls 
 yes 
 dangerous 
 yes 
 not against powder and shot 
 no 
i ve seen jesuits there 
 above the falls 
 yes 
damn them 
the mission is
to be called san carlos 
 don cabeza 
 mendoza 
take them away 
quickly  quickly now 
 you should find yourself a good woman 
 i have 
if you had 
you wouldn t look so gloomy 
 maybe you re right 
 about women  l m always right 
 how could l forget 
 you forget everything 
 i do  do l 
 you do 
good 
hello 
 good  now take them off 
 excellent 
you distract too easily 
on the day the senorita
can t distract my attention     
      i ll become a monk 
 on that day  felipe     
     half the ladies in this town
will become nuns 
pure gossip 
rodrigo is the lady s man 
rodrigo here is this lady s man 
felipe 
i love him  rodrigo 
since when have you loved felipe 
six months 
 six   
 i ve been trying to tell you 
i have 
yes  yes  yes  yes 
you have been trying to tell me 
so me you do not love 
not as l love felipe 
 rodrigo  that s the love that l need 
 i see 
and so l have no need 
you need so much 
you deserve so much 
rodrigo  you won t hurt him  will you 
no  l won t hurt him 
rodrigo  please 
 you laughed 
 i did not laugh 
most certainly you laughed 
 at whom are you laughing 
 don t do this 
quarrel with me 
oh  no 
so how goes it at your mission
above the falls 
 insects and twigs  father 
 no converts 
a few 
 and many near to it  thank the lord 
 thank the lord  indeed 
 do you know rodrigo mendoza 
 yes  l know him 
come with me 
i have a task  and you are
the only one who can do it 
he s been here for six months 
but he won t see anybody 
i think he wants to die 
so     
     you killed your brother 
and it was a duel 
and the law can t touch you 
is this remorse 
leave     
     priest 
maybe you wish l was your executioner 
perhaps that would be easier 
leave me alone 
 you know what l am 
 yes 
you re a mercenary 
you re a slave trader     
     and you killed your brother 
i know 
and you loved him 
although you chose
a strange way to show it 
are you laughing at me 
are you laughing at me 
i m laughing at you     
     because all l see is laughable 
i see a man running away  a man
hiding from the world  i see a coward 
go on 
go on 
so is that it 
ls this how you mean to go on 
 there is nothing else 
 there is life 
 there is no life 
 there is a way out  mendoza 
for me  there is no redemption 
god gave us the burden of freedom 
you chose your crime 
do you have the courage to choose
your penance  do you dare do that 
there is no penance
hard enough for me 
 but do you dare try it 
 do l dare 
do you dare to see it fail 
 father 
 aye 
how long must he carry
that stupid thing 
god knows  father john 
 ralph  here 
 thank you 
father 
he s done this penance long enough  and 
well  the other brothers think the same 
but he doesn t think so  john 
until he does  neither do l 
we re not the members of a democracy 
father  we re members of an order 
no 
no 
thank you 
thank you  lord  for our food
and all your other blessings  amen 
oh  good lord 
 did you cook this 
 yes 
did you put in all the chilies 
i m afraid l did 
i m sorry  i was trained
as a mercenary  not as a cook 
 this is true 
 it s dreadful 
 but the bread is good 
 it s not bad 
father  l want to thank you
for having me here 
you should thank the guarani 
how 
read this 
 though l have all faith
so that l could remove mountains   
   and have not love  l am nothing 
and though l bestow all my goods
to feed the poor   
   and though l give my body
to be burned   
   and have not love 
it profiteth me nothing 
love suffereth long and is kind 
love envieth not 
love vaunteth not itself 
is not puffed up 
when l was a child 
l spake as a child   
   l understood as a child 
l thought as a child 
but when l became a man 
l put away childish things 
but now abideth faith  hope  love    
these three 
but the greatest of these is love   
they ve agreed 
if you re going to become a jesuit 
you must accept my orders     
     as if they were the orders
of a commander  can you do that 
yes  father 
let us pray for our brother rodrigo 
christ  you led father lgnatius to
renounce the snares of this world     
     and to put on the livery
of labor and humiliation 
now we ask your blessing on rodrigo
as we welcome him into our community 
teach him to be generous 
to labor and not to count the cost     
     to serve with no reward 
save the doing of your will 
amen 
welcome home  brother 
this seeking to create
a paradise on earth   
   how easily it offends 
your holiness is offended   
   because it may distract from
that paradise which comes hereafter 
the spanish and portuguese kings
are offended   
   because a paradise of the poor
is seldom pleasing to those who rule 
and the settlers here are offended
for the same reason 
so it was this burden l carried
to south america 
to satisfy the portuguese wish
to enlarge their empire   
    to satisfy the spanish desire that
this would do them no harm   
    to satisfy your holiness   
    that these monarchs would threaten
no more the power of the church   
   and to ensure for you all   
    that the jesuits here could no longer
deny you these satisfactions 
i ve spent half my life
waiting for rome 
stop playing with that 
 what time is it 
 calm down 
ten to 
let me see how the children are doing 
good 
twenty four 
thirty nine 
over there  please 
 those are guarani 
 yes  your eminence 
 extraordinary 
 what 
very difficult to tell
what they re thinking 
 have you found this  senor hontar 
 i have 
i had that reaction when l first came 
your eminence 
pretty creature 
she ll fetch a lot of money in lisbon 
yes  well  perhaps
she doesn t want to go to lisbon 
perhaps not 
well  your eminence 
as to the missions       
we expect no political difference between
the papacy and spain and portugal 
why should there be 
between ourselves  your eminence 
the jesuits are too powerful here 
indeed 
 well  if you ll excuse me  gentlemen       
 your eminence 
by the way  gentlemen     
     i myself was a jesuit once 
so l had arrived in south america  my
head replete with the matters of europe 
but l soon began to understand 
for the first time   
    what a strange world
l had been sent to judge 
don cabeza  how can you possibly
refer to this child as an animal 
a parrot can be taught to sing 
your eminence 
yes  but how does one teach it
to sing as melodiously as this 
your eminence 
this is a child of the jungle 
an animal with a human voice 
if it were human 
an animal would cringe at its vices 
these creatures
are lethal and lecherous 
they have to be subdued by the sword
and brought to labor by the whip 
what they say is sheer nonsense 
father gabriel  of the mission of
san carlos  from which the boy comes 
and that is where 
that is here 
above the falls  in spanish territory 
no  that is territory which used
to be spanish  now it s portuguese 
 that is for his eminence to decide 
 no  that is a state matter 
it was decided by the treaty of madrid
and concluded by spain and portugal 
but surely the missions will remain
under church protection 
that is what his eminence
is here to decide  father gabriel 
continue  father 
your eminence  below the falls 
the jungle  if it has to be divided     
     may be divided between
the spanish and portuguese 
but above the falls  it still
belongs to god and the guarani 
there s no one else there 
and they are not naturally animals 
 they re naturally spiritual 
 spiritual 
 they kill their own young 
 that is true  may l answer that 
every man and woman is allowed
one child  if a third is born  it is killed 
but this is not some animal rite 
it s a necessity for survival 
they can only run
with one child apiece 
and what do they run from 
they run from us 
 that is  they run from slavery 
 rubbish 
 it is well known  
 rubbish  your eminence 
your eminence 
rubbish  rubbish 
silence 
in the territories covered by spain 
there is no slavery 
that institution is permitted
in the territories of our neighbors     
     the portuguese  and is  to my mind 
much misunderstood 
but here  in spanish territory     
     we run our plantation in accordance
with the laws of spain     
     and the precepts of the church 
that is a lie 
that is a lie 
i cannot and will not
accept a challenge from a monk 
 his cloth protects him 
 my cloth protects you 
in the name of the king 
l demand an apology 
i want an apology now 
damn you  l won t stand for this 
your eminence  we ve just seen
a good example of jesuit contempt     
     for the authority of the state 
member of your community 
father gabriel 
yes 
come 
 that was perfect 
 what 
a flash of jesuit temper was just
what we needed him to see 
 what do you mean 
 be patient  will you 
all we need is a little patience 
he knows what to do 
 you will apologize to don cabeza 
 what he said was a lie 
silence  you will apologize  go now 
 what was he before he joined you 
 a mercenary and a slave trader 
 will he apologize 
 yes  he will 
you should know that the spanish
do have slaves here 
they buy them from the portuguese 
amongst others 
 and don cabeza connives at this 
 yes 
profits by it too 
don cabeza wants the mission territories
to be taken over by the portuguese  why 
because the missions are the
only sanctuary left for the guarani 
without the shelter we provide
under spanish law     
     the lndians have no protection
against slavery 
they come to us of their own free will 
 truly 
 ask them  ask the guarani 
nine tenths of what they earn goes back
into the community  into their lives 
father gabriel  what do you think
is at issue here 
 the work of god is at issue 
 no  what is at issue     
     is the very existence of the
jesuit order  both here and in europe 
and l assure you that
the courts of europe are a jungle     
     in comparison with which
your jungle here is a tidy garden 
but is that to stand in our way 
thank you 
 but why must l apologize  why 
 because l order it 
 it was a lie 
 nevertheless  l order it 
don cabeza hates jesuits and lndians 
he and the portuguese are ruthless 
 can t you see that 
 of course 
 then why must l apologize 
 what better excuse can we give them     
     but that one of our order  albeit a
novice  publicly insults one of them 
now  you will apologize 
or are you no longer a jesuit 
by order of holy obedience 
without reservation     
     i ask don cabeza to pardon
my presumption and my insolence 
well  l accept 
why not 
but as l said before  l cannot accept
a challenge from a priest 
true  which makes my insolence
all the more insolent     
     and your pardon twice as gracious 
your eminence  l ask your pardon too 
i ask the pardon of this assembly 
i ask for the pardon of my brothers 
and l ask for your pardon     
      for insulting his excellency 
 thank you  that will do 
well  that was most gratifying 
your eminence 
do you think you could tell us about
your attitude to the transference     
      of the missions  territories 
 precisely 
i have kept these matters in the front
of my mind ever since l came here 
but l do not think
l should make a final decision     
     until l have seen these mission
territories with my own eyes 
there are numerous missions
that l should inspect 
but l have decided that
l shall begin with the oldest   
    the great mission of san miguel 
your holiness  a surgeon 
to save the body   
   must often hack off a limb 
but  in truth  nothing had prepared me
for the beauty and the power   
   of the limb that l
had come here to sever 
 very impressive 
 perhaps l m missing something 
i can t see any difference
between this plantation and my own 
that is the difference 
this plantation is theirs 
this is another difference 
a runaway slave  bought by
a spanish settler from a slave trader 
i see  is that lawful 
supply and demand is the law of trade 
 and the law of souls 
 what s a few cuts on the back     
     compared with what you offer them 
torments of hell  lmprisoned souls 
think of that  your eminence 
father lbaye  shall we continue 
what was your income last year 
last year  1 20 000 escudos 
and how was it distributed 
it is shared among them equally 
this is a community 
yes  there is a french radical group
that teaches that doctrine 
your eminence  it was the doctrine
of the early christians 
well  l am inexpressibly impressed
by your achievement  father 
 and will that save us 
 i hope it may  father 
the court of portugal is atheistic 
but you and l are christian catholics 
 and you serve a christian king 
 come  l also serve a catholic king 
you serve the marquis of pombal 
who is hostile the church     
     and rules your king 
i suggest we advise your king to postpone
the transfer of the mission territories     
     until portugal guarantees
their survival 
and l suggest we do this
in the hope of heaven     
     through the intercession
of our merciful redeemer 
in my opinion  the work of the
missions is the work of the devil 
they teach contempt for lawful profit 
and they disobey the king s authority 
the paramount vow of a jesuit
is a vow of obedience 
then let them obey 
tell them  your eminence 
am l disturbing you 
i fear l have bad tidings
from the marquis of pombal 
between ourselves  l should like
to express my personal regret 
he is determined to destroy
the power of the church 
and your christian community
is commercially competitive 
yes  it s very prosperous 
isn t that precisely why
you want to take it over 
you should ve achieved a noble failure
if you wanted the state s approval 
there s nothing we like better
than a noble failure 
it s deeply reassuring
to a trading nation such as my own 
you re not going to read it 
i don t need to read it
to know what it contains 
so  what will you do 
as my conscience dictates 
what else 
he s been in there five hours 
come with me to my mission
in san carlos 
there are so many distractions here 
it s hard to see anything clearly 
i think that  there  your prayers
might meet with better fortune 
i think  there  god would tell you
what it would be good to do 
and he d give you the strength
and the grace to do it     
     whatever it costs you 
the garden of eden 
it s a trifle overgrown 
though l knew  in europe  states were
tearing at the authority of the church   
   and though l knew that to
preserve itself there   
    the church must show
its authority over the jesuits here   
   l had to wonder whether these
lndians would not have preferred   
    that the sea and wind
had not brought any of us to them 
they say they don t understand
what you mean 
they want you to speak more clearly 
what do you want them to do 
they must leave the mission 
they say the mission is their home 
they must learn to submit
to the will of god 
tell them 
they say it was the will of god     
     that they left the jungle
and built the mission 
they don t understand
why god has changed his mind 
i cannot hope
to understand god s reasons 
he says  how does he know
you know god s will 
he thinks you speak not for god 
but for portugal 
i do not personally speak for god 
but l speak for the church     
     which is god s instrument on earth 
 he says  speak to the king of portugal 
 i have  he will not listen 
he said he is also a king 
he also will not listen 
he says they were wrong
ever to have trusted us 
 they re going to fight 
 you must persuade them not to fight 
i have failed to persuade you
to fight on their behalf 
if they do fight  it is absolutely
imperative that no one of you     
     should even seemed
to have encouraged them to do so 
and therefore  all of you will return
with me to asuncion tomorrow 
if anyone should disobey this 
he will be excommunicated 
cut off  cast out 
why must they fight 
 why can t they return to the jungle 
 because this is their home 
did you know this was going
to be your decision 
 yes 
 then why did you come  your eminence 
to persuade you not to resist the
transfer of the mission territories 
if the jesuits
resist the portuguese     
     the jesuit order
will be expelled from portugal 
and if portugal  then spain 
france  ltaly        who knows 
if your order is to survive at all     
     the missions here
must be sacrificed 
what were they saying 
they said the devil
lives in the forest 
 they want to stay here 
 and what did you say 
i said l d stay with them 
i want to renounce
my vows of obedience 
get out 
 i want to explain  
 get out  i won t listen to you 
just you 
no  it s ralph and john too 
what do you want  captain 
an honorable death 
they want to live  father 
they say that god has left them 
he s deserted them 
has he 
 you shouldn t have become a priest 
 but l am  and they need me 
then help them as a priest 
if you die with blood on your hands 
you betray everything we ve done 
you promised your life to god 
and god is love 
weren t you supposed
to be on guard last night 
look what happened 
get back there with the others 
they ve taken three guns 
gunpowder  pistols     
     and l don t know what else 
father  l ve come
to ask you to bless me 
no 
if you re right 
you ll have god s blessing 
if you re wrong 
my blessing won t mean anything 
if might is right     
     then love has no place
in the world 
it may be so 
but l don t have the strength
to live in a world like that 
i can t bless you 
down there  down there 
bring up both cannons 
quickly  quickly 
the other cannon as well 
indians  turn around 
turn around  face them 
fire 
we ll have to move the cannon 
move this cannon  move it 
and that one 
over there  shoot the priest 
get him 
 none of us wants to do this 
 i m not interested  get in position 
row 
after him  faster 
don t let the priest get away 
after him 
look out  the falls  halt 
back  back  halt 
go back 
and you have the effrontery to tell me
that this slaughter was necessary 
i did what l had to do 
given the legitimate purpose 
which you sanctioned     
     i would have to say  yes 
in truth  yes 
you had no alternative  your eminence 
we must work in the world 
the world is thus 
no  senor hontar     
     thus have we made the world 
thus have l made it 
so  your holiness   
   now your priests are dead 
and l am left alive 
but  in truth  it is l who am dead 
and they who live
