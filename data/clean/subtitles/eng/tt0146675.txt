well  good for you  your friend and
colleague  was he working for someone

if i did  it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one of their large shelves

now  this amulet
is from a masonic order   
in a former sub herald
of the vatican knights

of man s destruction and
the unholy s reign upon the earth 
why don t you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on 
who s after her  well  if you ll
excuse me  i ll try to explain 
kovak  you know anything about
the number of the beast 
revelation of st  john 
from his dream 
six six six  the number of the beast
is not six six six 
often in dreams  numbers appear
upside down and backwards 
so  six six six becomes nine nine nine 
like in 1999  the year of his return 
what does that have to do with me 
regressus diaboli 
the return of satan 
does any of this
look familiar to you 
she s been chosen 
he s in her blood 
the holy church has been searching
for you since the day you were born 
chosen for what  every thousand years 
on the eve of the millennium 
the dark angel comes and takes a body 
and then he walks the earth  looking for
a woman who will bear his child 
it all has to happen in that unholy hour
before midnight on new year s eve 
if he consummates
your flesh with this human body 
then he unlocks the gate of hell   
and everything as we know it
ceases to exist 
so  the prince of darkness
wants to conquer the earth 
but has to wait until an hour
before midnight of new year s eve 
is this eastern time  it s got
nothing to do with new year s eve 
it has to do with a temporary
celestial alignment 
the gregorian monks
studied the heavens 
they were able to calculate
the precise moment of this event 
they created our calendar
by mapping this event   
and counting backwards
from that moment 
it was a mistake to come here  it doesn t
matter whether you believe or not 
he s real  and he won t rest
till he finds this girl 
why did he pick me  because the stars
were right when you were born 
a man s body was also chosen 
just like yours 
if the devil does exist 
why doesn t your god do anything 
it s not my god  it s our god  and
he doesn t say that he will save us 
he says that we will save ourselves 
save myself  what am i supposed
to do  get a restraining order 
  we have to have faith 
  faith 
yes  faith 
it s an interesting concept 
if you read the bible 
you can t miss it  faith 
between your faith and my glock
nine millimeter  i take my glock 
come on  let s go 
i m afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil 
you did your job  you brought her here
to people of faith  we ll protect her 
  we ll hide her 
  you know  you live in a different world 
we have some real serious problems here 
and this is not solving them 
satan s greatest trick was convincing man
he didn t exist 
i don t  uh  
this all feels true to me 
you ll be safer with me  at least i can
fight this guy with something real 
you know what to do 
you feel it 
 softly 
i m sorry 
let him go

 scoffs  please 
he treated you like garbage 
you walked away
