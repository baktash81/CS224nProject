no way  i told you 
they re not coming here 
but what if they did 
they re gonna send me to the deep 
listen  relax  it s never gonna happen 
all right  boys 
pretty good today 
but let s talk technique 
hey  ragazzi  i need some help
with the nets 
you  the big  strong one 
  andiamo 
  i ll be right back 
hey  we re gonna win 
and you ll get your vespa 
why do you want a vespa  again 
oh  because it ll be amazing 
every day  me and alberto
are gonna ride someplace new 
and every night 
we ll sleep under the fish 
the fish  good 
how about you 
what ll you do when you win 
i ll get up
in front of everyone
and say   told you i d win  
yeah 
and then what 
well  that s it 
look  during school 
i live with my mamma in genova 
and every summer  i come here 
and everyone thinks
i m just some weird kid
who doesn t belong 
i think i know how you feel 
right  that s why we gotta win 
the town will cheer our names 
ercole s life will be ruined 
sorry  too much 
my mom says sometimes i m too much 
no way  not for me 
you know those aren t fish  right 
of course they are 
alberto told me all about it 
come with me 
this is a telescope 
old man bernardi lets me use it 
it makes faraway things seem close  look 
see any fish 
then what are all those 
stars  like the sun 
giant  raging balls of fire 
so  alberto was wrong 
and stars are circled by planets 
look 
that s saturno  it s my favorite 
it s the lightest of the planets 
they say if there was an ocean
big enough to hold it 
it would float in it 
whoa 
wow 
come on  luca 
  an8 so  this is how machines fly 
  an8 sì 
  an8 and there are big towns
called cities 
  an8 sì 
like even bigger than portorosso 
like genova  literally 20 times bigger 
and we re all on a big round rock 
floating around a star
in the  solar system  
so cool  right 
and is there anything
beyond the solar system 
only a galaxy full of solar systems 
  then what 
  a universe full of galaxies 
and then what 
and then   
i don t know 
but next year in advanced astronomy 
i m gonna use my school s telescope 
so  maybe i ll find out 
that thing s huge 
i wish i could show it to you 
just promise you ll tell me
everything you see 
sorry  too much 
never 
hey  luca  i ve been looking
everywhere for you 
  oh  sorry 
  just come on  let s go 
could i maybe borrow this 
just for tonight 
you can have it 
ha ha 
the universe is literally yours 
wow  thank you 
luca 
okay 
where are we going 
come on 
i got something to show you 
hey  you won t believe this 
those aren t fish 
  what 
  yeah 
giulia explained it to me 
they re fires 
but  like  one million times bigger 
uh  no  they re not 
soon you ll be ours  sweet vespa 
take a look 
i thought of every
single thing we re gonna need 
  an8 also  i added flames 
that s so cool 
oh  and we can bring
a telescope  too 
yeah  that shoots lightning 
no  no  no 
you look through it 
giulia says there s an even
bigger one at her school 
wait  what if we visit her there 
why would you wanna do that 
it kinda sounds interesting 
the whole reason we re getting a vespa
is to live on our own 
we don t need school 
we don t need anybody 
couldn t we just try it 
just for a few days 
luca  sea monsters can t go to school 
what do you think is gonna happen
when they see your fish face 
hey  look who it is 
and with no giulia to hide behind 
  come on  let s go 
  no 
something s fishy with you two 
i mean  besides the smell 
you re hiding something 
is it that we re smarter than you 
i mean  we re not really hiding that 
it s just kind of obvious 
you know  people think i m a nice guy 
always joking around 
but really  i m not 
  stop 
  wait your turn  piccoletto 
i want to make myself very clear 
this is my town 
number one   
   and number two  i don t want you in it 
i    i said stop 
put that down  piccoletto 
you ll hurt yourself 
let him go 
go  now  before i change my mind 
nobody wants you here  idioti 
keep running 
why did you make him mad 
we should ve left 
no  no  no  we re fine 
i had it under control 
all you gotta do
is follow my lead  remember 
rise and shine 
go  go  go  alberto  go 
nope  whoa   
buongiorno 
sea monster 
whew 
oh

uh   
hmm 
mm 
huh  hey 
  an8 that s amazing 
  an8 oh  wow 
i don t know  lorenzo 
was i too hard on him 
no  you were just trying
to keep him safe 
it s my fault 
i wasn t paying enough attention to him 
but i was the one who tried
to send him away 
i just never in a million years
would have thought he d do this 
it s like i don t even know   
you can do it  luca 
   who he is 
go  go 
  luca 
  luca 
luca  stop 
luca

uh    a shortcut 
steeper  rough terrain    i like it 
why aren t you training 
i m always training 
bravo  luca  that was your fastest yet 
ooh  guys  look 
that s the train to genova 
that goes to your school 
yeah 
i was wondering  actually 
is your school open to everyone 
well  it costs a little money 
but i guess 
great  thank you  giulia 
for showing us the boring thing
that takes us to the terrible place 
now  can we focus on what matters 
if we lose this race 
we re not going anywhere 
santa mozzarella  the downhill 
i know it looks scary 
but here s what you need to know   
would you stop bossing him around 
what is your problem 
i m his friend  i know what he needs 
oh  yeah 
well  then  what does he need 
me  we ll just ride it
like we did on the island  together 
  andiamo 
  no 
alberto  stop 
that s bruno talking 
no  i m pretty sure that s just me 
  stop  alberto 
  let it go 
look out 
porca paletta  what was that 
huh 
bah  not now  ciccio  eyes on the water 
  move  move 
  okay

hey  you re never allowed
on my bike again 
stick to food  big guy 
uh  what s going on 
nothing  let s just get back to training 
actually  we have something to ask you 
we were wondering
if we could come with you to your school 
santo pecorino  that s the best idea ever 
yes  of course 
uh  giulia  your school 
does it take all kinds of people 
i mean  what if some of them
were not human 
alberto   
what if some were  oh 
i don t know  sea monsters 
sea monsters 
i doubt your school would even
accept sea monsters  right 
ah  that s a weird joke  alberto 
yeah  i know  it s kinda hard to imagine 
so  let me just show you 
no 
  come on 
  giulia  wait 
we don t have time to goof around 
huh 
help 
don t hurt us 
  see  i knew this would   
  sea monster

to the boat 
we re gonna kill a sea monster 
oh  there you are  i made your favorite 
trenette al pesto 
where s alberto 
uh  he left  signor marcovaldo 
do you know where he went

he wants anyone looking for him 
maybe not  but just in case 
okay 
well  the two of us can still do the race 
you ll swim  you ll eat 
you ve done both before   
  luca  i   
     and i ll do the ride 
i mean  that s allowed  right 
  luca  luca
