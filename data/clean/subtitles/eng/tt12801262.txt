and every night
well sleep under the fish
the fish good
how about you
whatll you do when you win
ill get up
in front of everyone
and say told you id win
yeah
and then what
well thats it
look during school
i live with my mamma in genova
and every summer i come here
and everyone thinks
im just some weird kid
who doesnt belong
i think i know how you feel
right thats why we gotta win
the town will cheer our names
ercoles life will be ruined
sorry too much
my mom says sometimes im too much
no way not for me
you know those arent fish right
of course they are
alberto told me all about it
come with me
this is a telescope
old man bernardi lets me use it
it makes faraway things seem close look
see any fish
then what are all those
stars like the sun
giant raging balls of fire
so alberto was wrong
and stars are circled by planets
look
thats saturno its my favorite
its the lightest of the planets
they say if there was an ocean
big enough to hold it
it would float in it
whoa
wow
come on luca
an8so this is how machines fly
an8sì
an8and there are big towns
called cities
an8sì
like even bigger than portorosso
like genova literally 20 times bigger
and were all on a big round rock
floating around a star
in the solar system
so cool right
and is there anything
beyond the solar system
only a galaxy full of solar systems
then what
a universe full of galaxies
and then what
and then
i dont know
but next year in advanced astronomy
im gonna use my schools telescope
so maybe ill find out
that things huge
i wish i could show it to you
just promise youll tell me
everything you see
sorry too much
never
hey luca ive been looking
everywhere for you
oh sorry
just come on lets go
could i maybe borrow this
just for tonight
you can have it
haha
the universe is literally yours
wow thank you
luca
okay
where are we going
come on
i got something to show you
hey you wont believe this
those arent fish
what
yeah
giulia explained it to me
theyre fires
but like one million times bigger
uh no theyre not
soon youll be ours sweet vespa
take a look
i thought of every
single thing were gonna need
an8also i added flames
thats so cool
oh and we can bring
a telescope too
yeah that shoots lightning
no no no
you look through it
giulia says theres an even
bigger one at her school
wait what if we visit her there
why would you wanna do that
it kinda sounds interesting
the whole reason were getting a vespa
is to live on our own
we dont need school
we dont need anybody
couldnt we just try it
just for a few days
luca sea monsters cant go to school
what do you think is gonna happen
when they see your fish face
hey look who it is
and with no giulia to hide behind
come on lets go
no
somethings fishy with you two
i mean besides the smell
youre hiding something
is it that were smarter than you
