oh  but madame  this makes you
look like a vision  like a dream

oh  oh  oh  this is a big job  miss 
oh  bigger than the others

same as always  one bag of seed 
  you call this pay 
  it s chicken feed 
  what else could we give you

we can t give you our
eggs  they re too valuable 
and so are we 
after you  fetcher 
after i what 
  move 
  ooh 
hmm 
twenty two and nine 
fourteen shillings and threepence 
seven and sixpence times three 
two and nine 
fourpence halfpenny 
d
  oh  stupid  worthless creatures 
i m sick and tired of
making minuscule profits 
hmm 
hmm 
oh  yes 
those chickens are up to something 
quiet  i m onto something 
they re organized  i know it 
  i said  quiet 
  that ginger one 
i reckon she s their leader 
  mr  tweedy 
i may finally have found a way to
make us some real money around here 
and what are you on about 
ridiculous notions of escaping chickens 
  but    but   
  it s all in your head  mr  tweedy  say it 
it s all in me head 
it s all in me head 
now  you keep telling yourself that 
because i don t want to
hear another word about it 
  is that clear 
  yes  love 
but you know that ginger one   
they re chickens  you dolt 
apart from you  they re the most
stupid creatures on this planet 
they don t plot  they don t
scheme  and they are not organized 
  order  order 
  quiet  everyone  settle down 
i would like to call to order   
please  if you could just settle   
let s have some discipline
in the ranks  what  what 
  thank you  fowler 
  in my r a f  days 
we were never allowed to waste
time with unnecessary chitchat 
yes  thank you  fowler 
i   
right 
carry on 
now  i know our last escape
attempt was a bit of a fiasco 
but mac and i have come
up with a brand new plan 
  show  em  mac 
  right 
we tried going under the
wire and that didn t work 
so  the plan is  we go over it 
  this is us  right 
we get in like this 
wind her up and    let her go 
good grief  the turnip s bought it 
farmer s coming 
operation cover up 
whee 
ouch 
hmm 
huh 
  mr  tweedy 
  ooh  ouch 
  where are you 
  ooh  it s all in your head 
it s all in your head 
it s all in your head 
think  everyone  think 
what haven t we tried yet 
uh   
we haven t tried not trying to escape 
hmm  that might work 
what about edwina 
how many more empty nests will it take 
perhaps it wouldn t be empty if she d spent
more time layin  and less time escapin  
so laying eggs all your life   
and then getting plucked  stuffed
and roasted is good enough for you 
it s a livin  
you know what the problem is 
the fences aren t just round the
farm  they re up here in your heads 
there s a better place out
there somewhere beyond that hill 
and it has wide open
spaces and lots of trees   
and grass 
can you imagine that  cool  green grass 
  who feeds us 
  we feed ourselves 
  well  where s the farm 
  there is no farm 
  then where does the farmer live 
  there is no farmer  babs 
  is he on holiday 
  he isn t anywhere  don t you get it 
there s no morning head count  no
farmers  no dogs and coops and keys   
and no fences 
in all my life i ve never
heard such a fantastic   
load of tripe 
oh  face the facts  ducks 
the chances of us gettin  out
of here are a million to one 
then there s still a chance 
oh  no  oh  no  oh  no  what am i doing 
who are you trying to fool 
you can t lead this bunch of   
oh  heaven help us 
freedom 
huh 
whoa 
thank you  ladies and gentlemen 
you ve been a wonderful audience 
  ouch 
  oh  yes 
that s it 
get him inside quickly 
this is our way out of here 
we ll make posters 
no  what s on the poster  babs 
what s on the poster  we ll fly out 
he must be very important to have his
picture taken  what do you suppose he does 
isn t it obvious  he s a
professional flying rooster 
he flies from farm to
farm  giving demonstrations 
  do you suppose 
  oh  absolutely 
not in the dark  no 
no  not in there  no 
get out  good  gotta get   
who are you  where
am i  what s goin  on 
ouch  what happened to my wing 
you took a rather nasty fall 
and sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus 
i gave it a wee bit of a tweak 
jimmy  and wrapped her up 
was that english 
she said you sprained
your wing  she fixed it 
  i made the bandage 
  i i carried you in 
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
let s back up and start
from the top  where am i 
you re right  how rude of
us  we re just very excit   
this is a chicken farm 
and we re the chickens 
yeah  with you so far 
chicken farm  chickens   
i don t like the look of this one 
his eyes are too close together 
  father  please 
  and he s a yank 
easy  pops  cockfighting s
illegal where i come from 
and where is that exactly 
just a little place i call the land
of the free and the home of the brave 
  scotland 
  no  america 
oh  america 
poppycock  pushy americans  always
showing up late for every war 
overpaid  oversexed and over here 
what s eatin  grandpa 
oh  don t mind him  mister    mister 
the name s rocky  rocky the rhode
island red  rhodes for short 
  rocky rhodes 
  catchy  ain t it 
um  mr  rhodes  is this you 
uh  who wants to know 
a group of rather desperate chickens 
you see  if it is you  then you just
might be the answer to our prayers 
well  then  call me a miracle 
doll face   cause that s me 
and what brings you
to england  mr  rhodes 
why  all the beautiful
english chicks  of course 
give over 
you see  i m a traveler by nature 
i did that whole barnyard thing for a
while  but i couldn t really get into it 
hi  how are you  nope 
the open road  that s more my style 
yep  just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows 
in fact  you know what
they call me back home 
you re gonna love this 
the lone free ranger 
  ooh 
  isn t that great 
  i knew it was possible 
  oh  it s possible  all right 
  i knew the answer would come 
  amen 
we re all going to fly over that fence  and
mr  rhodes is going to show us how  right 
that s    what  did you say  fly  
  you can teach us 
  no  i can t 
listen  shh   
you hear that 
that s the open road calling my name 
and i was born to answer that call  bye 
he must have very good hearing 
okay  okay  where s
the exit  ah  this way 
mr  rhodes  um  perhaps i didn t
explain our situation properly 
we lay eggs day in and day out 
and when we can t lay
any more  they kill us 
it s a cruel world  doll face 
you might as well get used to it 
which part of  they kill
us  do you not understand 
i got my own set of
problems to worry about 
besides  this birdcage can t
be that hard to bust out of 
in fact  watch me 
it s not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two 
but this is about all of us 
  all of you 
  that s what i ve been trying to tell you 
wait a minute  let me get this straight 
you want to get every chicken in this
place out of here at the same time 
  of course 
  you re certifiable 
you can t pull off a stunt
like that  that s suicide 
where there s a will  there s a way 
couldn t agree more  i
will be leaving that way 
but   
  mr  rhodes  please   
  i m the type of guy
that likes to roam
around i m never in one   
so that s it  you re from the circus 
shh 
you re on the run  aren t you 
you wanna keep it down 
i m trying to lay low here 
i should turn you in right now 
  you wouldn t  would you 
  give me one reason why i shouldn t 
because i m    cute 
hey  hey  hey  what kind
of crazy chick are you 
  do you know what ll happen if he finds me 
  it s a cruel world 
i just decided  i don t like you 
i just decided  i don t
care  now  show us how to fly 
  with this wing 
  teach us then 
no 
he s valuable  you say 
  sure 
  get the torch 
now you listen here  sister 
i m not going back to that life 
i m a lone free ranger 
emphasis on free 
and that s what we want  freedom 
fancy that 
they re coming this way 
oh  oh  no  no  oh 
no  they re on to me 
teach us to fly and we ll hide you 
and if i don t 
was your father by any chance a vulture 
do we have a deal 
time to make good on that deal  doll   
the name is ginger 
  comfortable 
  not really 
  maybe this will help 
  nice hideout 
ouch  i had more room in my egg 
we ve held up our end of the
deal  tomorrow you hold up yours 
  what deal 
  the flying 
yeah  yeah  yeah  right 
right  right  don t worry 
i ll teach you everything i know 
now  which bunk is mine 
absolutely outrageous 
asking a senior officer
to share his quarters   
and with a noncommissioned
yank  no less 
  why  back in my day  i d never   
  hey 
you weren t exactly
my first choice either 
and scoot over  your wing s
on my side of the bunk 
your side of the bunk  the whole
bunk is my side of the bunk 
just    what s that
smell  is that your breath 
it s absolutely outrageous 
so you wanna fly  huh 
well  it ain t gonna be easy  and it
ain t gonna happen overnight either 
you see  flying takes three things 
hard work  perseverance and   
  hard work 
  you said hard work twice 
that s because it takes twice
as much work as perseverance 
codswallop 
now  the most important thing
is we have to work as a team 
which means    you do
everything i tell you 
right  let s rock and roll 
  oh  oh  oh 
  oh  oh  oh 
mrs  tweedy  the chickens are   
pecking 
and left  two  three 
and right  two  three 
and    stop right there  oh  yeah  down 
down  yeah  yeah  make little
circles  that s it  faster 
faster  oh  yes  perfect 
oh  that s the spot 
i thought you were going
to teach us how to fly 
that s what i m doing 
isn t there usually
some flapping involved 
hey  do i tell you how to lay eggs 
relax  we re making progress 
really  i can t help feeling
we re going around in circles 
what the    hey  cut it

poultry in motion 
birds of a feather flop together 
great work  ladies  great work

pain is your friend  okay 
it s a positive thing 
just keep the faith there  uh    what
was your name  agnes  you ll get there 
ducky  i think you flew four feet today 
right  four feet  from
the roof to the ground 
it s all part of the process 
ladies  nothing to worry about 
ya cheese eating little   
whoa 
that doesn t sound good  ha  ha  ha 
okay  the ground s
shaking  are we worried 
are we worried 
the circus  quick  hide me 
  hide me 
  come on 
one isn t awarded a medal like this
for flapping about like a lunatic  what 
now  see here  this is
an officer s quarters 
  quick  in here 
  get out of here immediately  sir 
give it a rest  pops 
out of here  i shall have you
on a charge within the week 
cheers  mate 
it s all in your head 
it s all in your head 
it s all in your head 
ooh 
what    what    what s all this then 
this is our future  mr  tweedy 
no more wasting time with petty egg
collection and minuscule profits 
no more eggs  but we ve
always been egg farmers 
me father and his father and all
their fathers  they was always   
poor  worthless  nothings 
but all that s about to change 
this will take tweedy s
farm out of the dark ages   
and into full scale
automated production 
  melisha tweedy will
be poor no longer 
ooh 
i ll put it together then  shall i 
this isn t good  mac 
whatever s in those boxes is for us 
and i don t think it s softer hay 
aye  hen  and i hate
to be the voice of doom 
but i ve been calculating my figures  and
i just don t think we re built for flyin  
but i saw him  he flew
in over that fence 
aye  aye  i believe you 
but if we could just see it for
ourselves  that may answer some questions 
you re right  i m sorry 
we ve been at this all week 
and we re getting nowhere 
if his wing were better  he could   
oh  i ll have a word with him 
where is he 
they didn t give me this
medal for being a yank nanny 
a simple  i don t know  would suffice 
beware of that one  young ginger 
that yank is not to be trusted 
that yank is our ticket out of here 
and the pig says to the horse 
 hey  fella  why the long face  
oh  oh  look  look 
oh  cocktail 
give over 
so  um  anyway   
remember those flying tips
tomorrow  they re very important 
keep thinking those flighty thoughts 
oh  yeah 
they re swell chicks  they really are 
look at what babs made me  a beak
warmer  isn t that the cutest 
and that bunty  she
really packs a punch 
is there a problem here 
  have we flown over that fence 
  not quite 
then there s a problem 
good things come to
those who wait  doll face 
ginger 
okay  how long did it take you 
to do what 
to learn how to fly 
apples and oranges  baby
doll  i m gifted  they re not 
you can t compare the two  okay 
the point is  these things take time 
which we are rapidly running out of 
we haven t even lifted
off the ground  why 
thrust 
i went over my calculations  and i figured
the key element we re missing is thrust 
l
  i didn t get a word of that 
thrust  other birds
like ducks and geese 
when they take off  what
do they have  thrust 
i swear she ain t usin  real words 
  she said we need more thrust 
  oh  thrust 
well  of course  we need thrust 
thrust and flying are like this 
that s flying and that s thrust 
  would you excuse us

chicken first to get the egg 
and then the egg   
you get the chicken out

the egg  obviously 
rollin  along  happy as larry 
then  crack  hatches
into the first chicken 
yeah  but where d the
egg come from  then 
what do you mean  where d it come from 
egg comes rollin  along  happy as larry 
it s wonderin 
where d it come from 
without a chicken  you get
no egg to come rollin  along 
well  conversely  without an
egg to hatch into the chicken 
then there will be no chicken to lay the
other egg that hatches into the chicken   
that lays the egg i
mentioned in the first place 
so we got two eggs now 
no  we re still talking
about the very first egg 
what happened about
the very first chicken 
it s in the very first egg
