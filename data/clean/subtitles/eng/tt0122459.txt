  oh  my god 
  marty  don t do it 
  what are you talking about 
now  robert   
this is none of my business 
i know that what s happened
has been    overwhelming 
and i know it s going to take you
a good while to sort it all out 
but while you re sorting  i want you
to remember that in all the times
i prayed that gracie would have
a second chance at life 
i always knew that if god blessed us
the heart she got
would have to be from
a very special person
if it were going to be at home in grace 
when she met you
her heart beat truly for the first time 
perhaps it was meant
to be with you always 
o  che bella bicicletta 
é sua

agli angeli spuntano le ali

ladies and gentlemen   bob rueland 
thank you for that introduction
and for your generous contribution 
i would like to thank everyone
who contributed time and energy 
my incredibly dedicated crew 
sitting right there 
and supervising veterinarian   my good 
my dear friend dr charles johnson 
hey  charlie 
he apparently will be signing autographs
after the ceremony 
the dedication ofthis new home
for sydney and his family
holds great personal meaning for me 
my late wife elizabeth
spent many years with sydney 
she taught him    so many things 
she envisioned this for him 
she taught him sign language 
she introduced him to his wife 
but more importantly 
it was her uncompromising passion
that brings us here together today 
so it is with great honour
that i dedicate this new habitat
in loving memory ofelizabeth rueland 
will everybody clear the dance floor
so that the bride and groom
may have the first dance 
oh  what ifl loved you
and i gave it my all 
what ifl told you
you re all i waited for 
what ifl held you tonight
and i made you feel oh so right 
what ifl loved you 
would you always be mine 
what ifl kissed you
the way you like to be kissed 
what ifl held you in my arms
so close like this 
what ifl touched you tonight
and i filled your body with delight 
what ifl loved you 
would you always be mine 
oh  what ifl sang you
a sweet lullaby 
what ifl gave you a dozen stars
that i pulled from the sky 
what ifl told you tonight
i wanna love you
for the rest ofyour life 
what ifl loved you 
would you always be mine 
what ifl loved you 
would you always be mine 
standin  at the corner
waitin  for a ride
to carry me away
thinkin   bout tomorrow
at the end ofthe day
i ve walked through every fire
and measured every mile
to see how far i ve gone
and all that really matters
ls i carry on
and here i am
like a soldier in the night  here i am
ready for the fight
oh  must be the master plan
cos here i am
and do you ever wonder
where the wind blows 
where it all will end 
some day i ll find the answers
and i won t be back again
and here i am
just like a soldier in the night
