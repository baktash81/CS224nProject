we ll use them for the party 
they re beautiful 
abuela claudia never had kids 
so she adopted the whole
block as her own 
adopted our sueñitos   too 
when i got to stanford   
   the isolation  abuela 
the loneliness 
i was  like   what am i doing
here  
mira  when
my mamá came from cuba   
ay  dios mío 
she felt like one tiny grain of sand
from the beaches we left behind 
what did she do 
she bought a winter coat
and a pair of velvet gloves 
her hands were cracked
from the cleaning fluids 
but the gloves hid that 
we had to assert our dignity in
small ways 
that s why these napkins are
beautiful 
that s why my mother s gloves
were beautiful 
little details that tell the
world  we are not invisible 
  respira  
  breathe  
  respira  
  this is my street  
  i smile at the faces  
    i ve known all my life  
  hey  nina  como estás 
  they regard me with pride  
  and everyone s sweet  
  they say 
 you re going places   
  so how can i say
that while i was away  
    i had so much to hide   
  hey  nina 
  hey  guys  it s me  
  the biggest disappointment
you know  
  the kid couldn t hack it  
  she s back and she s walkin 
real slow  
    welcome home  
    just breathe  
  sigué andando el
camino por toda su vida  
  respira  
    just breathe  
    y si pierdes mis  
  huellas 
que dios te bendiga  
    respira  
    as the radio plays  
  old forgotten boleros  
  i think of the days when this
city was mine  
  i remember the praise  
     ay  te adoro  te quiero   
    te adoro  
  the neighborhood waved
and said  
     nina  be brave and you re gonna be fine   
    te quiero  respira  
  and maybe it s me  
    but it all seems like lifetimes ago  
    respira  
  so what do i say to these
faces that i used to know   
   hey  i m home    
  mira  nina  
    hey     
    no me preocupo por ella  
  they re not worried
about me  
  mira  alli está
nuestra estrella  
  they are all counting on me
to succeed  
  ella si da la talla  
  i am the one
who made it out   
  the one who always made the
grade  
    but maybe i should have just stayed home  
    mira  nina  
  when i was a child  i stayed
wide awake  
  climbed to
the highest place  
  on every fire escape  
    restless to climb  
    respira  
  i got every scholarship  
  saved every dollar  
  the first to go to college  
    how do i tell them why  
    respira  
  i m coming back home   
  with my eyes on the horizon  
  just me and gwb  
  asking   gee  nina  
  what am i gonna be    
  straighten the spine  
  smile for the neighbors  
  everything s fine  
  everything s cool  
  the standard reply  
  lots of tests 
lots of papers  
  smile  wave goodbye  
  and pray to the sky 
oh  god  
    and how do i dare to say   
    nina  
    can i go in there and say  
    nina  
  i know that i m
letting you down  
nina 
  just     
  breathe  
the reality of an elite
school   
it s no joke  pop 
yeah  when i left  y all were 
like 
 it s gonna be great  go show
 em who we are  go represent  
the truth is   
is that most of the time i m at
stanford feels like a betrayal 
de verdad  of who 
of my family 
my community 
like the dean  he invited me
to this diversity dinner 
super wealthy donors  trustees 
the whole nine 
and i wore this black cocktail
dress and i was walking to my seat 
and one of the patrons shoved
her plate into my arms
and said   i ordered the
vegetarian option  
  no 
  yeah 
and all the servers  all
latino  shot me this look 
like   ooh  what s this
trigueña gonna do  
 ooh  what s she gon  do 
is she with us  or is she with them  
ah  bueno  there s no
shame in waiting tables 
and there s no shame
in having a different path 
like you 
dad    the deadline passed 
the extension
on spring tuition

classes  but we owe them

were tenuous before getting into this

top of the world  
  when the world was just
a subway map  
  and the one slash nine  
  climbed a dotted line
to my place  
  there s no nine train now  
right 
  i used to think  
  the bronx was a place
in the sky  
  when the world was just a
subway map  
  and my thoughts took shape  
  on that fire escape  
  can you remind me  
  of what it was like  
  at the top of the world   
  come with me  
oh  no 
  we begin july with a stop
at my corner fire hydrant  
  you would open it
every summer  
  i would bust it with a wrench
till my face got drenched  
    till i heard the sirens  
  yep 
    and then i ran like hell  
    you ran like hell  
    yeah  i ran like hell  
    i remember well  
  to your father s
dispatch window  
   hey  let me in  yo
they re coming to get me    
  you were always in constant
trouble  
no  i wasn t 
  then your dad would act all
snide but he d let me hide  
  you d be there inside  
  life was easier then  
  nina  everything is easier
when you re home  
  the street s a little kinder
when you re home

seems clearer  
  now that you are here or is
it me   
  maybe it s just me  
  we gotta go

  the sun is setting
and the light is getting low  
  are we going
to castle garden   
  maybe  maybe not  but way to
take a shot when the day is hot

a little ways away

    cool us down  
    welcome back to town  
    hey

buddies

puerto rico  
  who would i be
if i had never seen manhattan  
  if i lived in puerto rico
with my people  
  my people  
  i feel like all my life
i ve tried to find the answer  
  working harder 
learning spanish  
  learning all i can

the answer out at stanford

at the sea  
  thinking  where am i supposed
to be

proud of me

  sharing double beds
trying to catch a break  
  struggling with english  
  listening to friends finally

that her heart gave out

what they said  
  they said a combination
of the stress and the heat  
  why she never took her
medicine i ll never understand  
  i like to think
she went out in peace  
  with pieces of bread crumbs
in her hand  
  abuela claudia

  she sang the praises
of things we ignore  
  glass coke bottles 
bread crumbs  
  a sky full of stars  
  she cherished these things  
  she d say   alabanza   
  alabanza means to raise
this thing to god s face  
  and to sing quite literally
 praise to this

no  daddy  keep going 
hey  pop 
best days of my life 
it s creepy quiet 
usually  the one train s
up there  screeching 
yo  i was thinking   
there s so much stuff going on 
and all it just got me thinking about is 
like    all the people i care about the most 
and i just thought about you 
you re about
to change zip codes 
country codes  actually 
yeah  but
that s not till august 
i mean  you know  we got time 
usnavi   
i m the girl who paints nails 
there s plenty like me 
here and over there 
stop 
yo  you re an artist 
yo  your senior year
lab book   
i should ve been paying
attention to the board  but   
all them doodles you made 
yo  it was like   
wonder woman meets   
the simpsons meets   
guernica 
and i would   
i would watch  like   
i just want to see the whole
world through her eyes 
mira para allá 
benny  you know 
before i bought rosario s   
it was o hanrahan s 
the whole block was irish 
you know why i bought it 
my dad  he  uh    he pulled me
out of high school 
so that i could work on
the same farm as him 
making the same pennies 
i thought to myself 
 no  no  no  papi  
 that don t make no sense  
i m gonna drop out so somebody
else could get rich off of my work 
so i came here 
so i could make
my own damn work 
but  you never
finished high school 
but nina did 
you asked me 
 what a sueñito means  
i m not gonna sit here
and give you
some fairy tale version 
you know  a dream isn t some
sparkly diamond we get 
you know  sometimes  it s   
it s rough 
and it s not so pretty 
yeah 
daca was not a gift
from some benevolent saint  right 
  no 
  no 
  you made it happen  you fought for it 
  yes 
and that s why
it still continues now 
 cause what about the people who
don t qualify  like my niece  right 
she gets into college
without papers  but   
no work study for her 
no federal aid for her
so she doesn t get to go to college 
it s not right

  she said her niece couldn t go to college 
we can dream
bigger and better  right 
yo  sonny

i remember when i was your age 
they used to say   
 if you work hard
and you live by the rules 
the money will come 
the things will come 
and that  those things
will complete you  
but  they won t 
we work so hard to try and get there 
that we forget about what s right here 
i was gonna be like you 
share your stories 
share your stories 
there s nothing to be ashamed of 
tell our stories 
tell our stories 
tell our stories 
tell our stories 
tell our stories 
tell our stories 
dad  i know what i have to do 
you ve given me this amazing
education and i just need to use it 
and figure out how every
undocumented kid gets a pathway 
maybe stanford isn t a way out 
maybe it s a way back 
like abuela
always used to say   
asserting our dignity
in small ways 
wow 
this is it  huh  mija 
what 
this is the moment
when you do better than me 
not because of
some fancy degree   
it s  cause you can
see a future that i can t

appearances  appeals 
to a final decision   
could be five months 
or five years 
  five years

for a green card
or a rejection
