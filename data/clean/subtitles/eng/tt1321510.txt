abuela claudia never had kids
so she adopted the whole
block as her own
adopted our sueñitos  too
when i got to stanford
the isolation abuela
the loneliness
i was like what am i doing
here
mira when
my mamá came from cuba
ay dios mío
she felt like one tiny grain of sand
from the beaches we left behind
what did she do
she bought a winter coat
and a pair of velvet gloves
her hands were cracked
from the cleaning fluids
but the gloves hid that
we had to assert our dignity in
small ways
thats why these napkins are
beautiful
thats why my mothers gloves
were beautiful
little details that tell the
world we are not invisible
respira
breathe
respira
this is my street
i smile at the faces
ive known all my life
hey nina como estás
they regard me with pride
and everyones sweet
they say
youre going places
so how can i say
that while i was away
i had so much to hide
hey nina
hey guys its me
the biggest disappointment
you know
the kid couldnt hack it
shes back and shes walkin
real slow
welcome home
just breathe
sigué andando el
camino por toda su vida
respira
just breathe
y si pierdes mis
huellas
que dios te bendiga
respira
as the radio plays
old forgotten boleros
i think of the days when this
city was mine
i remember the praise
ay te adoro te quiero
te adoro
the neighborhood waved
and said
nina be brave and youre gonna be fine
te quiero respira
and maybe its me
but it all seems like lifetimes ago
respira
so what do i say to these
faces that i used to know
hey im home
mira nina
hey
no me preocupo por ella
theyre not worried
about me
mira alli está
nuestra estrella
they are all counting on me
to succeed
ella si da la talla
i am the one
who made it out
the one who always made the
grade
but maybe i should have just stayed home
mira nina
when i was a child i stayed
wide awake
climbed to
the highest place
on every fire escape
restless to climb
respira
i got every scholarship
saved every dollar
the first to go to college
how do i tell them why
respira
im coming back home
with my eyes on the horizon
just me and gwb
asking gee nina
what am i gonna be
straighten the spine
smile for the neighbors
everythings fine
everythings cool
the standard reply
lots of tests
lots of papers
smile wave goodbye
and pray to the sky
oh god
and how do i dare to say
nina
can i go in there and say
nina
i know that im
letting you down
nina
just
breathe
the reality of an elite
school
its no joke pop
yeah when i left yall were
like
its gonna be great go show
em who we are go represent
the truth is
is that most of the time im at
stanford feels like a betrayal
de verdad of who
of my family
my community
like the dean he invited me
to this diversity dinner
superwealthy donors trustees
the whole nine
and i wore this black cocktail
dress and i was walking to my seat
and one of the patrons shoved
her plate into my arms
and said i ordered the
vegetarian option

in having a different path

nina im not gonna be a ball
and chain
right i told you
we talked ab
here we go
what do you mean here we go
shh let me just listen to my
block
i used to think
we lived at the
top of the world
when the world was just
a subway map
and the oneslashnine
climbed a dotted line
to my place
theres no nine train now
right
i used to think
the bronx was a place
in the sky
when the world was just a
subway map
and my thoughts took shape
on that fire escape
can you remind me
of what it was like
at the top of the world
come with me
oh no
we begin july with a stop
at my corner fire hydrant
you would open it
every summer
i would bust it with a wrench
till my face got drenched
till i heard the sirens
yep
and then i ran like hell
you ran like hell
yeah i ran like hell
i remember well
to your fathers
dispatch window
hey let me in yo
theyre coming to get me
you were always in constant
trouble

then your dad would act all
snide but hed let me hide
youd be there inside

the streets a little kinder
when youre home

seems clearer
now that you are here or is
it me
maybe its just me
we gotta go
i wanna show you all i know
the sun is setting
and the light is getting low
are we going
to castle garden
maybe maybe not but way to
take a shot when the day is hot
i got a perfect shady spot
a little ways away
that oughta cool us down
cool us down
welcome back to town
hey

darkened youd hang out in bennett park

id imagine what would happen
if my parents had stayed in
puerto rico
who would i be
if i had never seen manhattan
if i lived in puerto rico
with my people
my people
i feel like all my life
ive tried to find the answer
working harder
learning spanish
learning all i can

the answer out at stanford

at the sea
thinking where am i supposed
to be

proud of me
when ive lost my way
then can i say
i couldnt get my mind off
you all day

beyond our streetlights
to reach the roof
you gotta bribe the supa

i remember nights
anger in the streets
hunger at the windows
women folding clothes playing
with my friends in the summer rain
mama needs a job
mama says were poor
one day you say
vamos a nueva york
and nueva york was far
but nueva york had work
and so we came
and now im wide awake
a million years too late

remembering what
we went through
nueva york

with the birds of la vibora
sharing double beds
trying to catch a break
struggling with english

polishing with pride
scrubbing the whole
of the upper east side
the days into weeks
the weeks into years

paramedics said
that her heart gave out
i mean thats basically
what they said
they said a combination
of the stress and the heat
why she never took her
medicine ill never understand
i like to think
she went out in peace
with pieces of bread crumbs
in her hand
abuela claudia
had simple pleasures
she sang the praises
of things we ignore
glass coke bottles
bread crumbs
a sky full of stars
she cherished these things
shed say alabanza
alabanza means to raise
this thing to gods face
and to sing quite literally
praise to this

should we take a break
no daddy keep going
hey pop
best days of my life
its creepy quiet
usually the one trains
up there screeching
yo i was thinking
theres so much stuff going on
and all it just got me thinking about is
like all the people i care about the most
and i just thought about you
youre about
to change zip codes
country codes actually
yeah but
thats not till august
i mean you know we got time
usnavi
im the girl who paints nails
theres plenty like me
here and over there
stop
yo youre an artist
yo your senior year
lab book
i shouldve been paying
attention to the board but
all them doodles you made
yo it was like
wonder woman meets
the simpsons meets
guernica
and i would
i would watch like
i just want to see the whole
world through her eyes
mira para allá
benny you know
before i bought rosarios
it was ohanrahans
the whole block was irish
you know why i bought it
my dad he uh he pulled me
out of high school
so that i could work on
the same farm as him
making the same pennies
i thought to myself
no no no papi
that dont make no sense
im gonna drop out so somebody
else could get rich off of my work
so i came here
so i could make
my own damn work
but you never
finished high school
but nina did
you asked me
what a sueñito means
im not gonna sit here
and give you
some fairy tale version
you know a dream isnt some
sparkly diamond we get
you know sometimes its
its rough
and its not so pretty
yeah
daca was not a gift
from some benevolent saint right
no
no
you made it happen you fought for it
yes
and thats why
it still continues now
cause what about the people who
dont qualify like my niece right
she gets into college
without papers but
no workstudy for her
no federal aid for her
so she doesnt get to go to college
its not right
what did she say
she said her niece couldnt go to college
we can dream
bigger and better right
yo sonny
whats going on man
lets do this yes
i knew i couldnt
get a license
but no college
she was talking
about undocumented folks
i remember when i was your age
they used to say
if you work hard
and you live by the rules
the money will come
the things will come
and that those things
will complete you
but they wont
we work so hard to try and get there
that we forget about whats right here
i was gonna be like you
share your stories
share your stories
theres nothing to be ashamed of
tell our stories
tell our stories
tell our stories
tell our stories
tell our stories
tell our stories
dad i know what i have to do
youve given me this amazing
education and i just need to use it
and figure out how every
undocumented kid gets a pathway
maybe stanford isnt a way out
maybe its a way back
like abuela
always used to say
asserting our dignity
in small ways
wow
this is it huh mija
what
this is the moment
when you do better than me
not because of
some fancy degree
its cause you can
see a future that i cant
hey
youre nuyoricua
were a people on the move
so yeah bring us with you
ignore anyone who doubts you
you take all the bruises baby
but you stay in the ring
i called
and its still available
but vanessa needs a cosigner and not
one whos about to leave the country
would you
as a personal favor
were all ready maam
thats señorita to you
