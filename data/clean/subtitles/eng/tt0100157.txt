  i said it s twine time   
 revs engine 
 woman 
what s that 
an old friend 
i was rummaging through a closet
and it was just sitting there 
it s nice  paul 
it s got character 
when i wrote my first book
i carried it in this   
  while i was looking for a publisher 
  i was a writer then 
  you re still a writer 
haven t been a writer
since i got in the misery business 
it s not a bad business 
and it would still be growing  too 
the first printing for misery s child
was the most ever 
over a million 
marcia  please 
misery chastain is putting
your daughter through college    
  bought you two houses
and seats to the knicks 
what thanks does she get 
you go and kill her 
i never meant for it to become my life 
if i hadn t gotten rid of her now 
i d have ended up writing her for ever 
now i m leaving for colorado
to try to finish the new book 
if i can make this work   
i might just have something
i want on my tombstone 
 thud 
 groans 
 distorted woman s voice 
i m your number one fan 
there s nothing to worry about 
you re gonna bejust fine 
i ll take good care ofyou 
i m your number one fan 
where   
we re just outside silver creek 
how long 
you ve been here two days 
you re gonna be ok 
  my name is annie wilkes 
  my number one fan 
yes  that s right 
i m also a nurse 
here  take these 
here 
  what are they 
  they re called novril  for your pain 
thank you 
how come i m not in the hospital 
the blizzard was too strong 
i couldn t risk trying to get you there 
i tried calling 
but the phone lines are down 
i   
agh   
you mustn t tire yourself 
you ve gotta rest 
you almost died 
open wide 
 groans 
your legs just sing grand opera
when you move  don t they 
it s not gonna hurt for ever  paul 
i promise you 
  will i be able to walk 
  of course you will 
and your arm will be fine  too 
your shoulder was badly dislocated 
it was a little stubborn 
but i finally popped it back in 
what l m most proud of
is the work l did on those legs 
considering what i had in the house 
i don t think a doctor could ve done better 
it s not nearly as bad as it looks 
you have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs 
the fibula in the right leg
is fractured  too 
i could hear the bones moving  so it s best
for your legs to remain immobile 
and as soon as the roads open 
i ll take you to a hospital 
meantime  you ve got
a lot of recovering to do    
  and i consider it an honour
that you ll do it in my home 
this is marcia sindell 
calling from new york city 
i d like to speak to the silver creek
chief of police or sheriff 
  which one do you want 
  whichever one s not busy 
well  i m pretty sure they re both not
busy  miz sindell  since they re both me 
i also happen to be president of
the policeman s benefit association    
  chairman of the patrolman s
retirement fund    
  and if you need a good fishing guide
you could do a lot worse 
call me buster 
everybody does 
what can i do for ya 
i m a literary agent and i   
i feel like a fool calling you    
  but i think one of my clients  paul
sheldon  may be in some kind of trouble 
  you mean paul sheldon the writer 
  uh huh 
  he s your client  huh 
  yes  he is 
well  everybody sure likes
those misery books 
yeah 
paul s been coming to the silver creek
lodge for years to finish his books 
i understand he s been up here
the last six weeks 
well  not quite 
i just called there 
they said he checked out last tuesday 
isn t that a little strange 
i don t know 
does he usually phone you
before he checks out of a hotel 
no  no  of course not 
it s just that his daughter hasn t heard from him   
  and when he has a new book
coming out he usually keeps in touch 
so when there wasn t
any word from him   
you think he might be missing  huh 
 sighs  i hate that i made this call 
tell me i m being silly 
oh  a little overprotective maybe  but   
tell you what i ll do 
nothing s been reported out here 
but i ll put his name through our system 
if anything turns up 
i ll call you right back 
i appreciate that 
thanks a lot 
goodbye  miz sindell 
we got a phone call 
busy morning 
yeah 
work  work  work 
virginia  when was that blizzard 
last tuesday 
why 
no reason 
i guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me 
 chuckles 
no  it wasn t a miracle at all 
  in a way  i was following you 
  you were following me 
well  it was no secret to me
you were staying at the silver creek    
  seeing as how
i m your number one fan an  all 
some nights i d just tool on
down there and sit outside   
  and look up at the light in your cabin 
i d try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the world s greatest writer 
  say that again  i didn t hear you 
  don t move now 
i wouldn t wanna hurt this neck 
well  the other afternoon
i was on my way home   
  and there you were  leaving the lodge 
i wondered why a literary genius would
go for a drive with a big storm coming 
i didn t know there
was a big storm coming 
well  lucky for you i did 
lucky for me  too    
  cos now you re alive
and you can write more books 
oh  paul  i ve read everything of yours 
the misery novels  
i know  em all by heart 
all eight of  em 
i love them so 
  well  you re very kind 
  and you re very brilliant 
like a baby 
all done 
thank you 
when do you think the phone lines ll be up 
i have to call my daughter    
  and i d like to call my agent
and let her know i m still breathing 
it shouldn t be much longer 
once the roads are open 
the phone lines ll be up in no time 
if you give me their numbers
i ll keep trying 
thank you 
could i ask you a favour 
i noticed in your case
there s a new paul sheldon book 
l wondered if maybe   
  you want to read it 
  well  if you wouldn t mind 
i do have a hard and fast rule as to
who reads my stuff at this early stage 
only my editor  my agent    
  and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death in a car wreck 
you ll never realise
what a rare treat you ve given me 
 groans 
boy  it s like clockwork
the way your pain comes 
i ll get the novril 
forgive me for prattling
away and making you feel all oogy 
what s your new book called 
i don t have a title yet 
what s it about 
i don t know 
i know it sounds crazy  but i haven t
written anything but misery for so long   
why don t you read it 
you can tell me what you think it s about 
maybe you can come up with a title 
like i could do that 
 man  there s nothing unusual
about mr sheldon s leaving  buster 
  you can tell by the champagne 
  maybe you can  libby 
see  he always orders a bottle
of dom pérignon when he s ready to go 
then he pays up and he s out the door 
no long distance phone calls
or federal express packages 
anything out of the ordinary 
i don t think mr sheldon likes
for things to be out of the ordinary 
considering who he is  famous an  all 
he doesn t put on airs 
drives up from new york
in the same car each time   65 mustang 
he says it helps him to think 
he s always been a good guest 
never makes a noise  never bothers a soul 
  i sure hope nothing s happened to him 
  so do i 
i bet that old mustang s
pulling into new york right now 
i m sure you re right 
thanks  libby 
my pleasure 
i know i m only 40 pages
into your book  but   
but what 
  nothing 
  no  no    what is it 
well  it s ridiculous 
who am i to make a criticism to someone like you 
it s all right  i can take it 
well  it s brilliantly written   
but then everything you write is brilliant 
pretty rough so far 
the swearing  paul 
there  i said it 
the  uh    the profanity bothers you 
it has no nobility 
these are slum kids 
i was a slum kid 
everybody talks like that 
they do not 
what do you think i say
when i go to the feed store in town 
 wally  give me a bag of that effing pig
feed and 10lb of that bitchly cow corn  
and in the bank do i tell mrs bollinger
 here s one big bastard of a cheque    
  give me some christing money  
there 
look there 
see what you made me do 
oh  paul  i m sorry 
i m so sorry 
oh   
sometimes i get so worked up 
can you ever forgive me 
it s    fine 
i love you  paul 
your mind 
your creativity 
that s all i meant 
well  this sure is fun 
virginia  when you re in this car
you re not my wife  you re my deputy 
well  this deputy d rather be home
under the covers with the sheriff 
  stop  stop 
  what 
  see that broken limb 
  could ve been the weight of the snow 
yeah 
could ve been a rotten branch 
the wind  could ve been a lot of things 
oh   
damn 
need some help 
no  i m enjoying myself 
thank you 
  you really think sheldon s out there 
  i hope not 
if he is  he s dead 
let s go to the newspaper office 
oh  i hope i didn t wake you 
no  that s fine 
look what i got 
they had it at the store  paul 
there was a whole batch of  em 
as soon as i saw it i slammed
my money down   i got the first copy 
  then the roads are open 
  the one to town is  but that s about it 
i called the hospital and talked
to the head orthopaedic surgeon   
  and i told him who you were
and what had happened 
he said as long as there s no infection
you re not in any danger 
as soon as the road to the hospital is
open they ll send an ambulance for you 
the phones are working 
well  mine s still out  but the ones in town
were working fine 
i called your agent 
oh  paul  i peeked at the very beginning 
what a wonderful first page 
  just to read the name misery chastain   
  my daughter will be going nuts 
  it s like a visit from my dearest friend 
  i should be home for her birthday today 
the agent said she d tell her you re ok    
  but you ll have to wait till tomorrow
to talk to her yourself 
oh  paul   
what a poet you are 
i made you my specialty 
scrambled eggs à la wilkes 
and i m on page 75 
i guess that means it s ok 
no 
no  it isn t  it s   
oh  pooh  i can t think of any words 
would  great  be insulting 
i can live with great 
no   
it s not just great  it s   
  perfect 
a perfect  perfect thing 
 grunting 
i thought it was time
you two should meet 
paul  say hello to my favourite beast
in the whole world   my sow misery 
misery 
yes 
i told you i was your number one fan 
yeah  i m  uh    starting to believe you 
this farm was kind of dreary  what with
just a few cows and chickens and me 
but when i got misery here everything changed 
she just makes me smile so 
she s a fine  uh   
pig  is what she is 
i m on page 300 now  paul    
  and it s better than perfect 
it s divine 
what s the ceiling that dago painted 
  the sistine chapel 
  yeah 
that and misery s child    
  those are the only two divine
things ever in this world 
 snorts 
when my husband left me 
i wasn t prepared 
it wasn t an easy time 
for a while i thought i might go crazy 
yeah  i know how that can be 
i don t know about you  but what i did
to get through it was i dove into work 
days  nights   
night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital 
i did a lot of reading 
that was when i first discovered misery 
she made me so happy 
she made me forget all my problems 
course  i suppose you had
a little something to do with that  too 
yeah  well   
i just kept reading them over and over 
i ve got two chapters to go on this one   
  and when i finish i ll turn right to the first
page and start reading it all over again 
i m  uh   
  done 
  yeah 
no problem 
thanks 
don t get me wrong 
i m not against marriage per se    
  but it d take a pretty special guy to make
me wanna walk down that aisle again 
yeah  it s  uh  not something
you should enter into lightly 
it boils down to respect 
people just don t respect
the institution of marriage any more 
they have no sense of real commitment 
well  i d love to stay here and chat    
  but i m right at the end
and i gotta find out what happens 
 door opens and closes 
you   
you dirty bird    how could you 
she can t be dead 
misery chastain cannot be dead 
annie  in 1871
women often died in childbirth 
her spirit is the important thing 
misery s spirit is still alive 
i don t want her spirit 
i want her 
and you murdered her 
no   
i didn t 
who did 
no one 
she    she died  she just slipped away 
slipped away 
slipped away 
she didn t just slip away 
you did it 
you did it 
you did it 
you did it 
you did it 
you murdered my misery 
annie   
i thought you were good  paul 
but you re not good 
you re just another lying old dirty birdie 
and i don t think i better
be around you for a while 
and don t even think
about anybody coming for you 
not the doctors  not your agent  not
your family  because i never called them 
nobody knows you re here 
and you better hope
nothing happens to me 
because if i die   
you die 
 door closes 
 another door closes 
 engine starts 
agh 
no  miz sindell  there s no point
in coming up here now 
everything that can be done is 
yes  we re working close with the state
police and the fbi s been informed 
right  right 
as soon as we know anything 
we ll let you know 
no bother at all 
call any time 
bye  miz sindell 
all right 
well  i sure appreciate it 
thank you 
according to sheldon s credit charges 
there s nothing after the silver creek 
and no calls about the article  either 
you poor  dear thing 
what are you doing on the floor 
it s all my fault 
if i d had a proper hospital bed
this never would ve happened 
here  let me help you back in 
 paul groans 
i know this hurts 
but it ll only take a few seconds 
upsy daisy 
oh   
ow   
  oh  please  wait  wait   
  oh  you re such a crybaby 
agh   
there you go 
comfy 
  perfect 
  you re such a kidder 
i have a big surprise for you 
but first there s something you must do 
you don t suppose i could have a little
snack while i m waiting for the surprise 
i ll get you everything you want 
but you must listen first 
sometimes my thinking
is a little muddy  i accept that 
it s why i couldn t remember all they
asked me on the witness stand in denver 
but this time i thought clearly 
i asked god about you    
  and god said  i delivered him unto you
so that you may show him the way  
  show me the way 
  yes 
when i mentioned a snack  i was thinking
more on the lines of cheese and crackers 
paul  this is no time for jokes 
you must rid the world of this filth 
you want me to burn my book 
i know this may be difficult for you 
but it s for the best 
it s really not difficult at all 
my agent made dozens of copies 
there s gonna be an auction in new york 
every publishing house in new york
is reading it now 
so if you want me to burn my book  fine 
you re not ridding the world of anything 
then light the match  paul 
it s no big deal 
so you ve indicated 
do it 
i know it s the only copy 
when you wrote your first book
you didn t make a copy   
  because you didn t think anybody
would take it seriously 
now you never make copies
because you re superstitious 
it s why you always
come back to silver creek 
you told that story to merv griffin
11 years ago 
merv griffin   
i ll tell you what 
it doesn t ever have to be published 
no one ever has to read it 
i ll just keep it for myself 
no one will even know it exists 
as long as it does exist 
your mind won t ever be free 
i think you should light the match  paul 
can t you see it s what god wants 
you re so brilliant i would think
you d certainly be able to see that 
we re put on this earth
to help people  paul 
like i m trying to help you 
please   
help me help you 
you re doing the right thing 
oh  my goodness 
goodness gracious 
oh  my   
oh  goodness 
heavens to betsy 
oh  goodness 
oh  my goodness 
heavens to betsy 
oh  goodness 
well  isn t that an oogy mess 
 helicopter 
that s the steadman place down there 
and that s the wilkes farm straight ahead 
that s no  65 mustang 
there s nothing else out this way 
let s circle back 
i do believe the winters are getting
shorter and shorter every year 
people say it has something to do
with the ozone layer 
what do you think 
i don t know 
yeah  well  it s a theory 
here s your novril 
we re back 
now  you ll have to remind us
who the audience chose 
they chose kevin 
congratulations  kevin andrews 
  hi  kevin 
  how you doing  chuck 
make yourselfat home back there 
and sheree will tell us about the date 
ok  first ofall i picked out
a very classy restaurant 
it was so classy 
and he shows up without no tie   
see  isn t this nice 
great 
ialways wanted to visit
the other side of the room 
ooh  and look what i got for you 
an electric razor 
so you can shave yourself now 
 razor buzzes 
if i knew this was the surprise
i d have burned all my books 
now  don t poke fun 
this is a very big day for you  paul 
you just sit tight and i ll set everything up 
  set what up 
  that s the big surprise 
your new studio 
after all  writers do need a place to work 
work 
you mean write 
what in the world do you think i d write 
oh  but  paul  i don t think 
i know 
now you ve gotten rid
of that manuscript    
  you can go back
to doing what you re great at 
you re gonna write a new novel 
your greatest achievement ever 
misery s return 
misery s return 
i know you didn t mean it when you killed her 
and now you ll make it right 
it ll be a book in my honour 
for saving your life and nursing you back to health 
oh  paul  you re gonna make me
the envy of the whole world 
you just expect me to whip
something off  is that it 
i expect nothing less
than your masterpiece 
you do understand that this is not the
ordinary way in which books get written 
i mean  some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation 
i have total confidence in your brilliance 
besides  the view will inspire you 
you just inhale that 
i ll be right back 
i guess you don t get bothered
by neighbours much 
don t worry  you ll have total solitude
so you can concentrate on your work 
great 
i got you this expensive
paper to type on    
  and i got a great deal on this 501b
clunker on account of it s missing an n 
i told the saleslady n was one of the
letters in my favourite writer s name 
it s two of the letters
in my favourite nurse s name  a nn ie 
you fooler 
did i do good 
you did great 
there is just one little thing 
uh   
i can t work on this paper 
see  it s corrasable bond 
it smudges 
so i thought maybe 
if you went back into town    
  you could bring me
some white long grain mimeo 
but mine cost the most 
so i don t see how it can smudge 
come here  i ll show you 
oh   
it does smudge after all 
isn t that fascinating 
i thought you d be interested 
i d like for you to be
in on everything  annie    
  not just the finished book 
but how it s written 
thank you for thinking of me 
anything else i can get while l m in town 
any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying 
would you like a tiny tape recorder 
or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers 
no  just the paper will be fine 
are you sure 
cos if you want i ll bring back
the whole store for you 
annie  uh  what s the matter 
i ll tell you what s the matter 
i go out of my way for you 
i do everything to try and make you happy 
i feed you  i clean you  i dress you 
and what thanks do i get 
 oh  you bought the wrong paper  annie 
i can t write on this  annie  
well  i ll get your stupid paper 
but you better show me   
  a little more appreciation  mister man 
agh 
 locks door 
shit 
come on   
come on  you ve written
about this  now do it 
 click 
what do you know 
it actually works 
what a surprise 
you crazy bitch 
agh 
 car approaches 
 click 
paul  i ve got your paper 
i hope it s enough 
it s three reams of long grain mimeo 
just the kind you asked for 
paul 
you re dripping with perspiration 
your colour is very hectic 
what have you been doing 
you know damn well what i ve been doing 
i ve been sitting here suffering 
i need my pills 
poor dear 
let s get you back in bed
and i ll get them for you 
i want my pills now 
  it ll only take a second 
  no 
i want my pain to go away  annie 
please  make it go away 
please  annie 
please 
it just breaks my heart to see you like this 
i ve done a lot of thinking on the drive   
here you go 
and i m absolutely certain the main
reason i ve never been more popular   
  is because of my temper 
you must be so mad at me 
the truth now 
well   
who doesn t let off
a little steam every once in a while 
my genius needs his rest before he writes 
 hums 
footsies up 
there you go 
here 
in case you think of any ideas 
well  i wouldn t expect too much 
don t be silly 
you ll be brilliant 
think of me as your inspiration 
i have faith in you  my darling 
catch this   
my darling 
the presumption must now be
that paul sheldon is dead 
we know he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle    
  but we have been unable to find his body
in the vicinity of the accident 
we also know if anyone had found him
they d have taken him to an area hospital 
undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow 
we ll find him after the first thaw 
that is  unless the animals got to him
first  which is a distinct possibility 
that was a statement from colorado
police chief sherman douglas 
you don t think he s dead  do you 
well  he might well be 
but not the way they say 
he never crawled out
of that car by himself 
you can see the dents on the door there 
someone pulled him out 
i m sorry  paul 
this is all wrong 
  what 
  you ll have to do it over again 
it s not worthy of you 
throw it all out 
except for naming the gravedigger
after me   you can leave that in 
i really value your criticism 
but maybe we re being a little hasty here 
paul  what you ve written just isn t fair 
  not fair 
  that s right 
when i was growing up in bakersfield
my favourite thing   
  was to go to the movies on saturdays
for the chapter plays 
  cliffhangers 
  i know that  mister man 
they also call them serials 
i m not stupid  you know 
anyway  my favourite was rocket man 
and once it was a no brakes chapter 
the bad guys stuck him in a car
on a mountain road  knocked him out    
  tore out the brakes
and started him to his death 
and he woke up and tried to get out    
  but the car went off a cliff before he
could escape  and crashed and burned    
  and i was so upset and excited 
and the next week i was first in line 
they start with the end of the last week    
  and there was rocket man trying
to get out  and here comes the cliff    
  and just before the car went off the cliff
he jumped free  and all the kids cheered 
but i didn t cheer 
i stood right up and started shouting   
   this isn t what happened last week 
have you all got amnesia  
 they just cheated us 
this isn t fair 
he didn t get out of the cockadoodie car  
they always cheated like that
in cl    chapter plays 
but not you 
not with my misery 
lan did ride for dr cleary at the end
of the last book  but his horse fell   
  and lan broke his shoulder and ribs
and never reached the doctor    
  so there couldn t be any experimental
blood transfusion that saved her life 
misery was buried in the ground at the
end  paul  so you ll have to start there 
is it fair 
should i continue 
you better 
oh  paul 
when lan realised that
the reason they d buried misery alive   
  was because the bee sting
had put her in that coma 
and gravedigger wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier   
  the same had happened
to lady evelyn hyde 
and then dr cleary deduced that misery
must be her long lost daughter   
  because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings  my heart just leapt 
i knew from the very first book
that misery had to be nobility   
    and i was right 
  yeah 
oh  paul  can i read each chapter
when you re finished 
i can fill in the n s 
will she be her old self now lan has
dug her out  or will she have amnesia 
have to wait 
will she still love him
with that special  perfect love 
  you ll have to wait 
  not even a hint 
mm mm 
ohhh 
misery s alive  misery s alive

give my best to denise 
bye 
well  whoever she is 
she sure likes to read a lot 
virginia  i m flattered that
you think i ve got that much energy 
i figured that if i can t find paul sheldon    
  at least i can find out
what he wrote about 
what d you expect to find 
a story about a guy
who drove off a cliff in a storm 
you see  it s just that kind of sarcasm
that s given our marriage real spice 
 liberace 
  i ll be seeing you
  in all the old familiar places   
  i hope you like it 
  it looks wonderful 
so do you 
mm   
i ve never had meatloaf this good

fresh tomatoes  never canned 
and to give it that extra zip i mix in
some spam with the ground beef 
ah

  let s have a toast 
  a toast

i just thought it d be nice 
are you kidding 
if anyone had ever told me that one day   
  i d be having a candlelit dinner
with paul sheldon in my own house    
  i woulda checked both legs
to see which one was being pulled 
will this do 
it s perfect 
to misery    and to annie wilkes 
who brought her back to life 
oh  paul 
i get goose bumps
every time i think about it 
oh   
oh  my god  what have i done 
oh  i m so sorry  paul 
i ruined your beautiful toast 
will you ever forgive me 
here  let me pour another one

 thunderclap 
here s your pills 
annie 
annie  what is it 
the rain 
sometimes it gives me the blues 
when you first came here   
i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon 
but now i know i love the rest of him  too 
i know you don t love me 
don t say you do 
you re a beautiful  brilliant 
famous man of the world   
  and i m   
not a movie star type 
you ll never know the fear
of losing someone like you   
  if you re someone like me 
why would you lose me 
the book s almost finished 
your legs are getting better 
soon you ll be wanting to leave 
why would i leave 
i like it here 
that s very kind of you 
but i ll bet it s not altogether true 
i have this gun 
sometimes i think about using it 
i better go now 
i might put bullets in it 
 there is a justice higher than that of man 
i will be judged by him  
what 
they re hauling misery into court 
that s nice 
there is a justice   
higher than that of man 
l will be judged   
by him

paul 
hm 
i know you ve been out

you ve been out of your room 
no  i haven t 
paul  my little ceramic penguin
in the study always faces due south 
i don t   
i don t know what you re talking about 
ceramic penguin 
is this what you re looking for 
i know you ve been out twice  paul 
at first i couldn t figure out how you did it 
but last night   
i found your key 
i know i left my scrapbook out 
i can imagine what
you might be thinking of me 
but you see  paul  it s all ok 
last night it came so clear 
i realise you just need more time 
eventually you ll come to accept
the idea of being here 
paul  do you know about the early days
at the kimberley diamond mines 
do you know what they did to
the native workers who stole diamonds 
don t worry 
they didn t kill them 
that would be like junking a mercedes
just because it had a broken spring 
no  they had to make sure
they could go on working    
  but they also had to make sure
they could never run away 
the operation was called  hobbling  
annie   
whatever you re thinking about doing 
please don t do it 
  annie  for god s   
  shh  darling 
trust me 
god s sake 
  it s for the best 
  annie  please 
agh

where the hell is that thing 
  what thing

  here it is  where it s supposed to be 
  what is it 
i m not sure

  well  i m glad you found it 
  there s that spice again

  hey  pete 
  buster 
  answer me a couple of things 
  if i can 
do you have any new
paul sheldon books 
well  we had a batch 
sold  em all out in three days 
you wouldn t happen to know
if miz wilkes bought one  would you 
are you kidding 
every time that fella writes a new book    
  she has me set aside the first copy 
has she been buying anything odd lately 
miz wilkes 
same old stuff 
lest you call paper odd 
  newspaper 
  no  the typing kind 
oh  that kind 
nothing odd about that 
  miz wilkes done something 
  not a thing 
 car approaches 
 footsteps 
agh 
i don t think i ll ever understand you 
i cook your meals    
   i tend to you
practically 24 hours a day    
  and you continue to fight me 
when are we going to develop a sense of trust 
oh  my 
sorry  i didn t mean to startle you 
but you didn t give me a chance to knock 
i guess you can tell i m not all
that used to visitors 
what can i do for you 
well  i was wondering  do you happen
to know anything about paul sheldon 
what do you want to know 
well  anything you could
tell me might help 
well  he was born in worcester 
massachusetts  45 years ago    
  the only child of franklin and
helene sheldon  mediocre student   
that isn t exactly the kinda
information i m after 
see  he s been missing
for some time now  and   
i know 
it s so upsetting 
i m his number one fan 
i ve got all his books 
every sentence he ever put down 
i m so proud
of my paul sheldon collection 
well  here i am prattling on
and my manners have just flown away 
i haven t invited you in 
please 
thank you 
of course  you must know
about that horrible accident 
  mind if i take a look around 
  of course not 
that accident almost killed me  too 
i prayed when i heard the news 
i got down on my knees
and i begged for it not to be true 
you re gonna laugh at what i m about
to say  but go ahead  i don t care 
when i was praying 
god told me to get ready 
  get ready for what 
  to be his replacement 
he gave so much pleasure
to so many people   
  and there s a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days    
  in case you hadn t noticed 
god told me 
since i was his number one fan    
  that i should make up new stories
as if i was paul sheldon 
so i went to town  and i bought
a typewriter  and paper to type on    
  the same kind paul sheldon used 
and i turned the guest bedroom into
a writing studio 
would you like to see it 
  sure 
  it s right this way 
i know how he wrote 
the kinds of words he used 
the wonderful stories he told   
i ve spent the last four weeks
trying to write like paul sheldon    
  but i can t do it right 
i try and i try  and i know all the words 
but it s just not the same 
well  maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it 
i could give you a coupla hundred pages
and you could tell me what you think 
i m not much of a critic 
well  i just thought   
oh  you d think i d never had a guest before 
would you like a cup of cocoa 
  no  really  i don t   
  it s no trouble 
there s some already made 
must get lonely 
living out here all by yourself 
well  if you can t enjoy
your own company    
  you re not fit company for anyone else 
well  you ve got a point there 
 both chuckle 
here you are 
well  thanks  miz wilkes  but i don t
wanna take up any more of your time 
i best be going 
but you didn t even taste your cocoa 
i m sure it s wonderful 
but i really should be getting back 
if you wouldn t mind  perhaps i could
pay you another visit sometime 
i d be delighted 
now that you know the way 
 clanking 
miz wilkes 
miz wilkes  are you all right 
 paul 
here 
here 
i m down here 
i m down here 
mr sheldon 
don t feel bad  paul 
it was bound to happen
sooner or later 
it s a sign 
you see  i ve known for some time
why i was chosen to save you 
you and i were meant
to be together for ever 
but now our time in this world must end 
but don t worry  paul 
i ve prepared for what must be done 
i put two bullets in my gun 
one for you and one for me 
oh  darling  it ll be so beautiful 
 footsteps 
now don t be afraid 
i love you 
i love you  too 
and you re right 
we are meant to be together 
and i know we must die 
but it must be   
so that misery can live 
we have the power
to give misery eternal life 
we must finish the book 
but the time is now 
soon others will come 
it s almost finished 
by dawn   
  we ll be able to give misery   
back to the world 
i ll fix you something to eat 
oh  paul  i m dying 
does she wind up with ian or windthorne 
you ll know very soon 
i ve just started the last chapter 
you know    when i finish   
i d like everything to be perfect 
i ll need three things 
what things 
you mean you don t know 
i was fooling  silly 
you need a cigarette  because
you used to smoke but quit    
  except when you finish a book 
and you have just one 
and the match is to light it  and you need
one glass of champagne  dom perig non 
dom perig non it is 
annie 
annie 
yes  paul 
i m almost done 
oh  paul  this is so romantic 
ian and windthorne duelling
for the right to misery s hand 
does ian win 
oh  don t tell me   
it s windthorne  right 
you ll know everything in a minute 
get the champagne 
oh   
oh   
did i do good 
you did perfect 
except for one thing 
this time we ll need    two glasses 
oh  paul 
remember how  all those years  nobody
knew who misery s real father was 
or if they d ever be reunited 
it s all right here 
does she finally marry ian 
or will it be windthorne 
it s all right here 
paul  you can t 
why not 
i learned it from you 
no  no  no 
not misery 
not my misery 
no 
not my misery 
i m gonna kill you  you lying cocksucker 
agh 
agh 
here  you want it 
you want it  
eat it 
eat it till you choke 
you sick  twisted fuck 
 annie screams 
this is it 
the very first copy 
the word i m getting
is the times review will be a love letter 
that ll be a first 
and my contacts at time and newsweek
say they re both raves 
and don t laugh  but i think
you ve got a shot at some prizes 
great 
i thought you d be thrilled 
you re being taken seriously 
i m delighted the critics are liking it
and i hope the people like it  too 
but   
i wrote it for me 
now  don t think
i m completely nuts  but   
  in some way   
annie wilkes   
  that whole experience  uh   
  helped me 
paul  since you brought her up    
  i have to ask this or l ll be
drummed out of the agents  union 
how would you feel about
a non fiction book about what went on 
gee  if i didn t know better
i d think you were suggesting   
  i dredge up the worst horror
of my life just to make a few bucks 
i thought you were over it 
i don t know if anyone could totally
get over something like that 
it s weird 
even though i know she s dead    
  i still think about her once in a while 
excuse me 
i don t mean to bother you 
but are you paul sheldon 
yes 
i just wanna tell you
i m your number one fan 
that s very sweet of you 
 liberace 
  i ll be seeing you
  in all the old familiar places
  that this heart of mine embraces
  all day through
  in that small café
  the park across the way
  the children s carousel
  the chestnut trees
  the wishing well
  i ll be seeing you
  in every lovely summer s day
  in everything that s light and gay
  i ll always think of you that way
  i ll find you in the morning sun
  and when the night is new
  i ll be looking at the moon
  but i ll be seeing you
  i ll be seeing you
in every lovely summer s day
  i ll be seeing you
in everything that s light and gay
  i ll always think of you that way
  i ll find you in the morning sun
  and when the night is new
  i ll be looking at the moon
