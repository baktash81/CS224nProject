an old friend
i was rummaging through a closet
and it was just sitting there
its nice paul
its got character
when i wrote my first book
i carried it in this
while i was looking for a publisher
i was a writer then
youre still a writer
havent been a writer
since i got in the misery business
its not a bad business
and it would still be growing too
the first printing for miserys child
was the most ever
over a million
marcia please
misery chastain is putting
your daughter through college
bought you two houses
and seats to the knicks
what thanks does she get
you go and kill her
i never meant for it to become my life
if i hadnt gotten rid of her now
id have ended up writing her for ever
now im leaving for colorado
to try to finish the new book
if i can make this work
i might just have something
i want on my tombstone
thud
groans
distorted womans voice
im your number one fan
theres nothing to worry about
youre gonna bejust fine
ill take good care ofyou
im your number one fan
where
were just outside silver creek
how long
youve been here two days
youre gonna be ok
my name is annie wilkes
my number one fan
yes thats right
im also a nurse
here take these
here
what are they
theyre called novril for your pain
thank you
how come im not in the hospital
the blizzard was too strong
i couldnt risk trying to get you there
i tried calling
but the phone lines are down
i
agh
you mustnt tire yourself
youve gotta rest
you almost died
open wide
groans
your legs just sing grand opera
when you move dont they
its not gonna hurt for ever paul
i promise you
will i be able to walk
of course you will
and your arm will be fine too
your shoulder was badly dislocated
it was a little stubborn
but i finally popped it back in
what lm most proud of
is the work l did on those legs
considering what i had in the house
i dont think a doctor couldve done better
its not nearly as bad as it looks
you have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs
the fibula in the right leg
is fractured too
i could hear the bones moving so its best
for your legs to remain immobile
and as soon as the roads open
ill take you to a hospital
meantime youve got
a lot of recovering to do
and i consider it an honour
that youll do it in my home
this is marcia sindell
calling from new york city
id like to speak to the silver creek
chief of police or sheriff
which one do you want
whichever ones not busy
well im pretty sure theyre both not
busy miz sindell since theyre both me
i also happen to be president of
the policemans benefit association
chairman of the patrolmans
retirement fund
and if you need a good fishing guide
you could do a lot worse
call me buster
everybody does
what can i do for ya
im a literary agent and i
i feel like a fool calling you
but i think one of my clients paul
sheldon may be in some kind of trouble
you mean paul sheldon the writer
uhhuh
hes your client huh
yes he is
well everybody sure likes
those misery books
yeah
pauls been coming to the silver creek
lodge for years to finish his books
i understand hes been up here
the last six weeks
well not quite
i just called there
they said he checked out last tuesday
isnt that a little strange
i dont know
does he usually phone you
before he checks out of a hotel
no no of course not
its just that his daughter hasnt heard from him
and when he has a new book
coming out he usually keeps in touch
so when there wasnt
any word from him
you think he might be missing huh
sighs i hate that i made this call
tell me im being silly
oh a little overprotective maybe but
tell you what ill do
nothings been reported out here
but ill put his name through our system
if anything turns up
ill call you right back
i appreciate that
thanks a lot
goodbye miz sindell
we got a phone call
busy morning
yeah
work work work
virginia when was that blizzard
last tuesday
why
no reason
i guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me
chuckles
no it wasnt a miracle at all
in a way i was following you
you were following me
well it was no secret to me
you were staying at the silver creek
seeing as how
im your number one fan an all
some nights id just tool on
down there and sit outside
and look up at the light in your cabin
id try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the worlds greatest writer
say that again i didnt hear you
dont move now
i wouldnt wanna hurt this neck
well the other afternoon
i was on my way home
and there you were leaving the lodge
i wondered why a literary genius would
go for a drive with a big storm coming
i didnt know there
was a big storm coming
well lucky for you i did
lucky for me too
cos now youre alive
and you can write more books
oh paul ive read everything of yours
the misery novels
i know em all by heart
all eight of em
i love them so
well youre very kind
and youre very brilliant
like a baby
all done
thank you
when do you think the phone linesll be up
i have to call my daughter
and id like to call my agent
and let her know im still breathing
it shouldnt be much longer
once the roads are open
the phone linesll be up in no time
if you give me their numbers
ill keep trying
thank you
could i ask you a favour
i noticed in your case
theres a new paul sheldon book
l wondered if maybe
you want to read it
well if you wouldnt mind
i do have a hardandfast rule as to
who reads my stuff at this early stage
only my editor my agent
and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death in a car wreck
youll never realise
what a rare treat youve given me
groans
boy its like clockwork
the way your pain comes
ill get the novril
forgive me for prattling
away and making you feel all oogy
whats your new book called
i dont have a title yet
whats it about
i dont know
i know it sounds crazy but i havent
written anything but misery for so long
why dont you read it
you can tell me what you think its about
maybe you can come up with a title
like i could do that
man theres nothing unusual
about mr sheldons leaving buster
you can tell by the champagne
maybe you can libby
see he always orders a bottle
of dom pérignon when hes ready to go
then he pays up and hes out the door
no longdistance phone calls
or federal express packages
anything out of the ordinary
i dont think mr sheldon likes
for things to be out of the ordinary
considering who he is famous an all
he doesnt put on airs
drives up from new york
in the same car each time 65 mustang
he says it helps him to think
hes always been a good guest
never makes a noise never bothers a soul
i sure hope nothings happened to him
so do i
i bet that old mustangs
pulling into new york right now
im sure youre right
thanks libby
my pleasure
i know im only 40 pages
into your book but
but what
nothing
no no what is it
well its ridiculous
who am i to make a criticism to someone like you
its all right i can take it
well its brilliantly written
but then everything you write is brilliant
pretty rough so far
the swearing paul
there i said it
the uh the profanity bothers you
it has no nobility
these are slum kids
i was a slum kid
everybody talks like that
they do not
what do you think i say
when i go to the feed store in town
wally give me a bag of that effing pig
feed and 10lb of that bitchly cow corn
and in the bank do i tell mrs bollinger
heres one big bastard of a cheque
give me some christing money
there
look there
see what you made me do
oh paul im sorry
im so sorry
oh
sometimes i get so worked up
can you ever forgive me
its fine
i love you paul
your mind
your creativity
thats all i meant
well this sure is fun
virginia when youre in this car
youre not my wife youre my deputy
well this deputyd rather be home
under the covers with the sheriff
stop stop
what
see that broken limb
couldve been the weight of the snow
yeah
couldve been a rotten branch
the wind couldve been a lot of things
oh
damn
need some help
no im enjoying myself
thank you
you really think sheldons out there
i hope not
if he is hes dead
lets go to the newspaper office
oh i hope i didnt wake you
no thats fine
look what i got
they had it at the store paul
there was a whole batch of em
as soon as i saw it i slammed
my money down  i got the first copy
then the roads are open
the one to town is but thats about it
i called the hospital and talked
to the head orthopaedic surgeon
and i told him who you were
and what had happened
he said as long as theres no infection
youre not in any danger
as soon as the road to the hospital is
open theyll send an ambulance for you
the phones are working
well mines still out but the ones in town
were working fine
i called your agent
oh paul i peeked at the very beginning
what a wonderful first page
just to read the name misery chastain
my daughter will be going nuts
its like a visit from my dearest friend
i should be home for her birthday today
the agent said shed tell her youre ok
but youll have to wait till tomorrow
to talk to her yourself
oh paul
what a poet you are
i made you my specialty
scrambled eggs à la wilkes
and im on page 75
i guess that means its ok
no
no it isnt its
oh pooh i cant think of any words
would great be insulting
i can live with great
no
its not just great its
perfect
a perfect perfect thing
grunting
i thought it was time
you two should meet
paul say hello to my favourite beast
in the whole world  my sow misery
misery
yes
i told you i was your number one fan
yeah im uh starting to believe you
this farm was kind of dreary what with
just a few cows and chickens and me
but when i got misery here everything changed
she just makes me smile so
shes a fine uh
pig is what she is
im on page 300 now paul
and its better than perfect
its divine
whats the ceiling that dago painted
the sistine chapel
yeah
that and miserys child
those are the only two divine
things ever in this world
snorts
when my husband left me
i wasnt prepared
it wasnt an easy time
for a while i thought i might go crazy
yeah i know how that can be
i dont know about you but what i did
to get through it was i dove into work
days nights
night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital
i did a lot of reading
that was when i first discovered misery
she made me so happy
she made me forget all my problems
course i suppose you had
a little something to do with that too
yeah well
i just kept reading them over and over
ive got two chapters to go on this one
and when i finish ill turn right to the first
page and start reading it all over again
im uh
done
yeah
no problem
thanks
dont get me wrong
im not against marriage per se
but itd take a pretty special guy to make
me wanna walk down that aisle again
yeah its uh not something
you should enter into lightly
it boils down to respect
people just dont respect
the institution of marriage any more
they have no sense of real commitment
well id love to stay here and chat
but im right at the end
and i gotta find out what happens
door opens and closes
you
you dirty bird how could you
she cant be dead
misery chastain cannot be dead
annie in 1871
women often died in childbirth
her spirit is the important thing
miserys spirit is still alive
i dont want her spirit
i want her
and you murdered her
no
i didnt
who did
no one
she she died she just slipped away
slipped away
slipped away
she didnt just slip away
you did it
you did it
you did it
you did it
you did it
you murdered my misery
annie
i thought you were good paul
but youre not good
youre just another lying old dirty birdie
and i dont think i better
be around you for a while
and dont even think
about anybody coming for you
not the doctors not your agent not
your family because i never called them
nobody knows youre here
and you better hope
nothing happens to me
because if i die
you die
door closes
another door closes
engine starts
agh
no miz sindell theres no point
in coming up here now
everything that can be done is
yes were working close with the state
police and the fbis been informed
right right
as soon as we know anything
well let you know
no bother at all
call any time
bye miz sindell
all right
well i sure appreciate it
thank you
according to sheldons credit charges
theres nothing after the silver creek
and no calls about the article either
you poor dear thing
what are you doing on the floor
its all my fault
if id had a proper hospital bed
this never wouldve happened
here let me help you back in
paul groans
i know this hurts
but itll only take a few seconds
upsydaisy
oh
ow
oh please wait wait
oh youre such a crybaby
agh
there you go
comfy
perfect
youre such a kidder
i have a big surprise for you
but first theres something you must do
you dont suppose i could have a little
snack while im waiting for the surprise
ill get you everything you want
but you must listen first
sometimes my thinking
is a little muddy i accept that
its why i couldnt remember all they
asked me on the witness stand in denver
but this time i thought clearly
i asked god about you
and god said i delivered him unto you
so that you may show him the way
show me the way
yes
when i mentioned a snack i was thinking
more on the lines of cheese and crackers
paul this is no time for jokes
you must rid the world of this filth
you want me to burn my book
i know this may be difficult for you
but its for the best
its really not difficult at all
my agent made dozens of copies
theres gonna be an auction in new york
every publishing house in new york
is reading it now
so if you want me to burn my book fine
youre not ridding the world of anything
then light the match paul
its no big deal
so youve indicated
do it
i know its the only copy
when you wrote your first book
you didnt make a copy
because you didnt think anybody
would take it seriously
now you never make copies
because youre superstitious
its why you always
come back to silver creek
you told that story to merv griffin
11 years ago
merv griffin
ill tell you what
it doesnt ever have to be published
no one ever has to read it
ill just keep it for myself
no one will even know it exists
as long as it does exist
your mind wont ever be free
i think you should light the match paul
cant you see its what god wants
youre so brilliant i would think
youd certainly be able to see that
were put on this earth
to help people paul
like im trying to help you
please
help me help you
youre doing the right thing
oh my goodness
goodness gracious
oh my
oh goodness
heavens to betsy
oh goodness
oh my goodness
heavens to betsy
oh goodness
well isnt that an oogy mess
helicopter
thats the steadman place down there
and thats the wilkes farm straight ahead
thats no 65 mustang
theres nothing else out this way
lets circle back
i do believe the winters are getting
shorter and shorter every year
people say it has something to do
with the ozone layer
what do you think
i dont know
yeah well its a theory

if i knew this was the surprise
id have burned all my books
now dont poke fun
this is a very big day for you paul
you just sit tight and ill set everything up
set what up
thats the big surprise
your new studio
after all writers do need a place to work
work
you mean write
what in the world do you think id write
oh but paul i dont think
i know
now youve gotten rid
of that manuscript
you can go back
to doing what youre great at
youre gonna write a new novel
your greatest achievement ever
miserys return
miserys return
i know you didnt mean it when you killed her
and now youll make it right
itll be a book in my honour
for saving your life and nursing you back to health
oh paul youre gonna make me
the envy of the whole world
you just expect me to whip
something off is that it
i expect nothing less
than your masterpiece
you do understand that this is not the
ordinary way in which books get written
i mean some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation
i have total confidence in your brilliance
besides the view will inspire you
you just inhale that
ill be right back
i guess you dont get bothered
by neighbours much
dont worry youll have total solitude
so you can concentrate on your work
great
i got you this expensive
paper to type on
and i got a great deal on this 501b
clunker on account of its missing an n
i told the saleslady n was one of the
letters in my favourite writers name
its two of the letters
in my favourite nurses name annie
you fooler
did i do good
you did great
there is just one little thing
uh
i cant work on this paper
see its corrasable bond
it smudges
so i thought maybe
if you went back into town
you could bring me
some white longgrain mimeo
but mine cost the most
so i dont see how it can smudge
come here ill show you
oh
it does smudge after all
isnt that fascinating
i thought youd be interested
id like for you to be
in on everything annie
not just the finished book
but how its written
thank you for thinking of me
anything else i can get while lm in town
any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying
would you like a tiny tape recorder
or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers
no just the paper will be fine
are you sure
cos if you want ill bring back
the whole store for you
annie uh whats the matter
ill tell you whats the matter
i go out of my way for you
i do everything to try and make you happy
i feed you i clean you i dress you

what a surprise
you crazy bitch
agh
car approaches
click
paul ive got your paper
i hope its enough
its three reams of longgrain mimeo
just the kind you asked for
paul
youre dripping with perspiration
your colour is very hectic
what have you been doing
you know damn well what ive been doing
ive been sitting here suffering
i need my pills
poor dear
lets get you back in bed
and ill get them for you
i want my pills now
itll only take a second
no
i want my pain to go away annie
please make it go away
please annie
please
it just breaks my heart to see you like this
ive done a lot of thinking on the drive
here you go
and im absolutely certain the main
reason ive never been more popular
is because of my temper
you must be so mad at me
the truth now
well
who doesnt let off
a little steam every once in a while
my genius needs his rest before he writes
hums
footsies up
there you go
here
in case you think of any ideas
well i wouldnt expect too much
dont be silly
youll be brilliant
think of me as your inspiration
i have faith in you my darling
catch this
my darling
the presumption must now be
that paul sheldon is dead
we know he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle
but we have been unable to find his body
in the vicinity of the accident
we also know if anyone had found him
theyd have taken him to an area hospital
undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow
well find him after the first thaw
that is unless the animals got to him
first which is a distinct possibility
that was a statement from colorado
police chief sherman douglas
you dont think hes dead do you
well he might well be
but not the way they say
he never crawled out
of that car by himself
you can see the dents on the door there
someone pulled him out
im sorry paul
this is all wrong
what
youll have to do it over again
its not worthy of you
throw it all out
except for naming the gravedigger
after me  you can leave that in
i really value your criticism
but maybe were being a little hasty here
paul what youve written just isnt fair
not fair
thats right
when i was growing up in bakersfield
my favourite thing
was to go to the movies on saturdays
for the chapter plays
cliffhangers
i know that mister man
they also call them serials
im not stupid you know
anyway my favourite was rocket man
and once it was a nobrakes chapter
the bad guys stuck him in a car
on a mountain road knocked him out
tore out the brakes
and started him to his death
and he woke up and tried to get out
but the car went off a cliff before he
could escape and crashed and burned
and i was so upset and excited
and the next week i was first in line
they start with the end of the last week
and there was rocket man trying
to get out and here comes the cliff
and just before the car went off the cliff
he jumped free and all the kids cheered
but i didnt cheer
i stood right up and started shouting
this isnt what happened last week
have you all got amnesia
they just cheated us
this isnt fair
he didnt get out of the cockadoodie car
they always cheated like that
in cl chapter plays
but not you
not with my misery
lan did ride for dr cleary at the end
of the last book but his horse fell
and lan broke his shoulder and ribs
and never reached the doctor
so there couldnt be any experimental
blood transfusion that saved her life
misery was buried in the ground at the
end paul so youll have to start there
is it fair
should i continue
you better
oh paul
when lan realised that
the reason theyd buried misery alive
was because the bee sting
had put her in that coma
and gravedigger wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier
the same had happened
to lady evelynhyde
and then dr cleary deduced that misery
must be her longlost daughter
because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings my heart just leapt
i knew from the very first book
that misery had to be nobility
and i was right
yeah
oh paul can i read each chapter
when youre finished
i can fill in the ns
will she be her old self now lan has
dug her out or will she have amnesia
have to wait
will she still love him
with that special perfect love
youll have to wait
not even a hint
mmmm
ohhh
miserys alive miserys alive
oh its so romantic
oh this whole house
is gonna be filled with romance
im gonna put on my liberace records
you do like liberace dont you
whenever he played radio city
who do you think was in the front row
im gonna play my records all day long
to inspire you
hes my alltime favourite
annie
would you have dinner with me tonight
to celebrate miserys return
i couldnt have done it without you
oh paul
it would be an honour
no hes not here
i dont know where he is
he never tells me anything any more
hes probably out
having an affair somewhere
wait a minute
hes coming in now
its jim taylor
he wants to know
who youre having an affair with
hello jim
whats doing
jim weve been through this before
if you have benches
in front of your store
people are gonna want to sit on em
well i dont like him either but im not
gonna come over and tell him to move
give my best to denise
bye
well whoever she is
she sure likes to read a lot
virginia im flattered that
you think ive got that much energy
i figured that if i cant find paul sheldon
at least i can find out
what he wrote about
what dyou expect to find
a story about a guy
who drove off a cliff in a storm
you see its just that kind of sarcasm
thats given our marriage real spice
liberace
ill be seeing you
in all the old familiar places
i hope you like it
it looks wonderful
so do you
mm
ive never had meatloaf this good
what do you do to it
my secret is i only use
fresh tomatoes never canned
and to give it that extra zip i mix in
some spam with the ground beef
ah
cant get this in a restaurant in new york
lets have a toast
a toast
yes
to um to misery
let me pour you some wine
oh
whoa
no
to misery
wait
lets do this right
do you have any candles
oh um
i dont know
i
i think so
ill go look
did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair
oh you
i just picked things up over the years
well it certainly says you
you really think so
oh absolutely
listen if you cant find any its ok
i just thought itd be nice
are you kidding
if anyone had ever told me that one day
id be having a candlelit dinner
with paul sheldon in my own house
i woulda checked both legs
to see which one was being pulled
will this do
its perfect
to misery and to annie wilkes
who brought her back to life
oh paul
i get goose bumps
every time i think about it
oh
oh my god what have i done
oh im so sorry paul
i ruined your beautiful toast
will you ever forgive me
here let me pour another one
can we pretend this never happened
to misery
to misery

paul this is positively
the best misery youve ever written
thunderclap
heres your pills
annie
annie what is it
the rain
sometimes it gives me the blues
when you first came here
i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon
but now i know i love the rest of him too
i know you dont love me
dont say you do
youre a beautiful brilliant
famous man of the world
and im
not a moviestar type
youll never know the fear
of losing someone like you
if youre someone like me
why would you lose me
the books almost finished
your legs are getting better
soon youll be wanting to leave
why would i leave
i like it here
thats very kind of you
but ill bet its not altogether true
i have this gun
sometimes i think about using it
i better go now
i might put bullets in it
there is a justice higher than that of man
i will be judged by him
what
theyre hauling misery into court
thats nice
there is a justice
higher than that of man
l will be judged
by him

paul my little ceramic penguin

i dont know what youre talking about
ceramic penguin
is this what youre looking for
i know youve been out twice paul
at first i couldnt figure out how you did it
but last night
i found your key
i know i left my scrapbook out
i can imagine what
you might be thinking of me
but you see paul its all ok
last night it came so clear
i realise you just need more time
eventually youll come to accept
the idea of being here
paul do you know about the early days
at the kimberley diamond mines
do you know what they did to
the native workers who stole diamonds
dont worry
they didnt kill them
that would be like junking a mercedes
just because it had a broken spring
no they had to make sure
they could go on working
but they also had to make sure
they could never run away
the operation was called hobbling
annie
whatever youre thinking about doing
please dont do it
annie for gods
shh darling
trust me
gods sake
its for the best
annie please

come on misery
come on misie
hey pete
buster
answer me a couple of things
if i can
do you have any new
paul sheldon books
well we had a batch
sold em all out in three days
you wouldnt happen to know
if miz wilkes bought one would you
are you kidding
every time that fella writes a new book
she has me set aside the first copy
has she been buying anything odd lately
miz wilkes
same old stuff
lest you call paper odd
newspaper
no the typing kind
oh that kind
nothing odd about that
miz wilkes done something
not a thing
car approaches
footsteps
agh
i dont think ill ever understand you
i cook your meals
i tend to you
practically 24 hours a day
and you continue to fight me
when are we going to develop a sense of trust
oh my
sorry i didnt mean to startle you
but you didnt give me a chance to knock
i guess you can tell im not all
that used to visitors
what can i do for you
well i was wondering do you happen
to know anything about paul sheldon
what do you want to know
well anything you could
tell me might help
well he was born in worcester
massachusetts 45 years ago
the only child of franklin and
helene sheldon mediocre student
that isnt exactly the kinda
information im after
see hes been missing
for some time now and
i know
its so upsetting
im his number one fan
ive got all his books
every sentence he ever put down
im so proud
of my paul sheldon collection
well here i am prattling on
and my manners have just flown away
i havent invited you in
please
thank you
of course you must know
about that horrible accident
mind if i take a look around
of course not
that accident almost killed me too
i prayed when i heard the news
i got down on my knees
and i begged for it not to be true
youre gonna laugh at what im about
to say but go ahead i dont care
when i was praying
god told me to get ready
get ready for what
to be his replacement
he gave so much pleasure
to so many people
and theres a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days
in case you hadnt noticed
god told me
since i was his number one fan
that i should make up new stories
as if i was paul sheldon
so i went to town and i bought
a typewriter and paper to type on
the same kind paul sheldon used
and i turned the guest bedroom into
a writing studio
would you like to see it
sure
its right this way
i know how he wrote
the kinds of words he used
the wonderful stories he told
ive spent the last four weeks
trying to write like paul sheldon
but i cant do it right
i try and i try and i know all the words
but its just not the same
well maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it
i could give you a coupla hundred pages
and you could tell me what you think
im not much of a critic
well i just thought
oh youd think id never had a guest before
would you like a cup of cocoa
no really i dont
its no trouble
theres some already made
must get lonely
living out here all by yourself
well if you cant enjoy
your own company
youre not fit company for anyone else
well youve got a point there
both chuckle
here you are
well thanks miz wilkes but i dont
wanna take up any more of your time
i best be going
but you didnt even taste your cocoa
im sure its wonderful
but i really should be getting back
if you wouldnt mind perhaps i could
pay you another visit sometime
id be delighted
now that you know the way
clanking
miz wilkes
miz wilkes are you all right
paul
here
here
im down here
im down here
mr sheldon
dont feel bad paul
it was bound to happen
sooner or later
its a sign
you see ive known for some time
why i was chosen to save you
you and i were meant
to be together for ever
but now our time in this world must end
but dont worry paul
ive prepared for what must be done
i put two bullets in my gun
one for you and one for me
oh darling itll be so beautiful
footsteps
now dont be afraid
i love you
i love you too
and youre right
we are meant to be together
and i know we must die
but it must be
so that misery can live
we have the power
to give misery eternal life
we must finish the book
but the time is now
soon others will come
its almost finished
by dawn
well be able to give misery
back to the world
ill fix you something to eat
oh paul im dying
does she wind up with ian or windthorne
youll know very soon
ive just started the last chapter
you know when i finish
id like everything to be perfect
ill need three things
what things
you mean you dont know
i was fooling silly
you need a cigarette because
you used to smoke but quit
except when you finish a book
and you have just one
and the match is to light it and you need
one glass of champagne dom perignon
dom perignon it is
annie
annie
yes paul
im almost done
oh paul this is so romantic
ian and windthorne duelling
for the right to miserys hand
does ian win
oh dont tell me
its windthorne right
youll know everything in a minute
get the champagne
oh
oh
did i do good
you did perfect
except for one thing
this time well need two glasses
oh paul
remember how all those years nobody
knew who miserys real father was
or if theyd ever be reunited
its all right here
does she finally marry ian
or will it be windthorne
its all right here
paul you cant
why not
i learned it from you
no no no
not misery
not my misery
no
not my misery
im gonna kill you you lying cocksucker
agh
agh
here you want it
you want it
eat it
eat it till you choke
you sick twisted fuck
annie screams
this is it
the very first copy
the word im getting
is the times review will be a love letter
thatll be a first
and my contacts at time and newsweek
say theyre both raves
and dont laugh but i think
youve got a shot at some prizes
great
i thought youd be thrilled
youre being taken seriously
im delighted the critics are liking it
and i hope the people like it too
but
i wrote it for me
now dont think
im completely nuts but
in some way
annie wilkes
that whole experience uh
helped me
paul since you brought her up
i have to ask this or lll be
drummed out of the agents union
how would you feel about
a nonfiction book about what went on
gee if i didnt know better
id think you were suggesting
i dredge up the worst horror
of my life just to make a few bucks
i thought you were over it
i dont know if anyone could totally
get over something like that
its weird
even though i know shes dead
i still think about her once in a while
excuse me
i dont mean to bother you
but are you paul sheldon
yes
i just wanna tell you
im your number one fan
thats very sweet of you
liberace
ill be seeing you
in all the old familiar places
that this heart of mine embraces
all day through
in that small café
the park across the way
the childrens carousel
the chestnut trees
the wishing well
ill be seeing you
in every lovely summers day
in everything thats light and gay
ill always think of you that way
ill find you in the morning sun
and when the night is new
ill be looking at the moon
but ill be seeing you
ill be seeing you
in every lovely summers day
ill be seeing you
in everything thats light and gay
ill always think of you that way
ill find you in the morning sun
and when the night is new
ill be looking at the moon
