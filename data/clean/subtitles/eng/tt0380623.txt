and exotic local wildlife 
my mom calls it home

like suddenly you re on a new
planet  breathing a new atmosphere 
can you scan this
into match  com 
mom  i m busy 
doing what 
do you have to
do this right away 
can t you just
wait this time   
and see if you meet a guy
the normal way 
have you seen these lines 
i am in a race against time 
now get on in there
and scan this thing 
every second counts 
tick tock  tick tock 
if a student brings a cell phone
to school  it will be confiscated   
regardless of how   
excuse me  i don t even
know why we re here 
it s not like they re going to be
my teachers four months from now 
that s negative imaging 
holly 
   are not permitted
in the school building

and kept in your lockers 
now  i d like to introduce to you
the head of our guidance department 
dr  charles fitch 
all right  fitchy 
hey  fitch 
hey  dr  fitch 
hey there  everyone 
let me tell you how i run
the guidance department 
i have an open door policy  which
means you can stop by my office   
whenever you want 
i also have
an open mind policy 
there are no stupid questions 
so please  if you have something
on your mind  knock on my door 
mom 
or raise your hands 
woman in the back  go ahead  hi 
instead of once a year  have you
considered a monthly forum where   
students and teachers could exchange
thoughts in an effort to enhance   
communication and bridge gaps 
that s a   
that s a great comment 
mrs   
miss hamilton 
i also wondered if you d thought of
monthly mixers for single parents 
not that i don t want to meet
married parents as well 
i would 
it s just that sometimes
we single parents   
have different concerns
than married ones 
different priorities 
if you know what i mean 
and by priorities i mean 
i need to meet a good man 
in that case 
where do i sign up 
okay  well 
this was interesting 
where were we here 
so you re just not going to talk
to me for the rest of your life 
come on  holly 
every unmarried parent there
appreciated the suggestion 
did it ever occur to you that
the point of the meeting   
wasn t for the needs
of the single parent 
that the point of the meeting
was maybe for  i don t know   
the kids 
well  sure 
i was just thinking   
about you 
because you re always
thinking about you 
she s doing it again 
only this time 
i can t smile and play along 
because the truth is
i m tired   
of bubble wrap and change of address
cards  of figuring out new towns   
and finding new friends 
it s just not fun anymore 
it s just not 
you know what
the entire student body   
is talking about this morning 
the krispy kreme truck that
got in a wreck on eighth avenue 
there s donuts
everywhere 
it s a total free for all 
between the excitement and the
sugar buzz  everyone s pretty much   
forgotten everything that
happened before 8 00 this morning 
it could have been worse 
don t worry  it will be 
it always starts the same 
i mean  she starts out hopeful 
and then when the perfect man   
doesn t come around in two
weeks  she gets desperate   
and hooks up with some loser 
some guy who s not even
good enough to mop her floors 
and then  when it doesn t work
out  because it never works out   
we pack up and move again  and
there s nothing i can do about it 
i can t even run away
because that s what she does 
i thought you said you didn t
mind all the moving around 
i didn t  i mean  i don t 
i just got here 
the river bistro 
what are we doing here 
i can t even afford to pee
in a place like this 
much less actually eat here 
relax 
it s under control 
my uncle s the owner 
him 
you ve got to be kidding 
no  him 
no  you didn t do that 
did you 
well  how long
did you keep her waiting 
what  an hour 
of course she s mad 
what  hold on 
this is holly 
hi 
hi  holly 
nice to meet you 
why wouldn t she be mad 
well  there s only one thing
you can do  flowers 
and you can t go cheap 
either  nope 
a dozen  long stemmed 
he knows about females 
he knows more about females
than i know about females 
in my opinion 
roses always work  always 
he doesn t actually
believe that  does he 
but who am i to know 
call me tomorrow and let me
know how it worked out  bye 
yes  i do believe that 
don t you 
that flowers always work 
yeah 
not if the guy s a loser 
the flowers aren t going to
change anything 
flowers are
just flowers  right 
wow  your friend s
so cynical 
sounds like
she s not into romance 
you know what 
this is for you 
why 
because a flower like this
is perfect 
and giving a woman a dozen
of them  it s like saying   
there is such a thing
as perfect 
and it s out there 
don t give up 
you ll find it 
really 
a yellow rose says
all of that 
actually a yellow rose
is for your sick grandma 
for a woman  a red rose 
but if you really want to knock her
socks off  you give her an orchid 
why  what do orchids say 
you ever seen an orchid 
how it floats in the water 
so delicate and beautiful 
when a woman gets an orchid   
well  she feels like   
she s floating on a cloud
of infinite possibility 
i swear i ll pay you back 
i still don t get how flowers
from you will fix things 
well  they re not flowers 
they re orchids 
and they re not from me 
they re from her perfect man 
then let him pay 
i would  if he existed 
i m lost 
do you remember
what your uncle said 
an orchid will make
my mom feel special 
which will make her happy 
and not so desperate 
which would make me happy 
and then everybody wins 
holly 
what 
are you sure this is
a good idea  i m sure 
a few flowers
never hurt anyone 
 annoying mammal  
six letters 
hey  mom 
badger 
boy  am i thirsty 
was that the buzzer 
five letters for
 in line to get  maybe  
mom  wasn t that
the buzzer 
the times thinks
they re so clever 
i ve got to go take
a shower right now 
hey 
excuse me 
hello  that s my flower 
no  it s not  it s mine 
is your name jean 
no  that s my girlfriend 
okay  what s the card say 
it says 
 to my dearest girlfriend   
 on her birthday  i love you
so     give me my flower back 
could you be
any more crazy 
i was just
bringing them to you 
wow  how beautiful 
who are those for 
me 
isn t that weird 
someone left me flowers 
who  what s the card say 
let s see 
 how many women can look like
a goddess in a bakery uniform 
 you are a vision  
who sent them 
 a secret admirer  
who could it be 
well  obviously  someone
that saw you at the shop 
yeah  but how would
he know my name 
well  you wear a nametag 
don t you 
or where i live 
duh  google 
or that i love orchids 
maybe he followed you home 
it s very strange 
no  it s probably scary 
mom  look  this is
the most romantic thing   
that a man has
ever done for you 
quit questioning it
and enjoy it 
you are absolutely right 
why are you wearing jeans
under your robe 
how would you like to have
bruises all over your body 
your uncle is a genius 
it worked 
she was singing happy songs 
she never sings happy songs 
yeah  well  neither do i  but
don t send me flowers  okay 
i like it that way 
hey 
hey  check it out  do i got
juice or what  look at jean 
a little attention from me and
she s all poofed up like a peacock 
it s the guy peacock
who poofs up 
you know what i m saying 
it s an animal thing 
she s like a lioness letting
the lion know she s ready 
it s the guy lion
who poofs up  too 
people  don t forget
to read chapters 42 and 43 
there will be
a test on friday 
peter  can i see you
a minute  please 
hurry up 
what s that 
nothing 
is that supposed to be me 
no  it s somebody else 
the face 
this looks exactly
like my face 
no  it isn t 
okay  the face
a little bit 
but that woman
is on a horse 
you re not on a horse 
that s a completely
different person 
it s pretty good 
my dad sponsored comic book
conventions when i was a kid 
he d take me 
if you hang around long
enough  you pick it up 
so you hung out
with your dad a lot 
no  actually  after he
and my mom split up   
that s pretty much the
only thing we did together 
but  hey  at least i
learned how to draw  right 
divorce as a career builder 
that s nice 
so  hey 
have you ever been 
divorced  not yet 
no  to a comic convention 
no  not that  either 
well  there s one
coming up 
six weeks from now 
westside convention center 
it sounds geeky 
but it s kind of fun 
yeah  i m not much
of a planner  you know 
has anyone been
asking for me 
like who 
i don t know 
anyone 
no 
hey  jean 
this has your name
written all over it 
dolores  you re crazy 
no  she s right  you re
way too good for this place 
this contest is
for professionals 
i mean  i m basically
a salesperson 
explain this to me 
how come when it s a man
you re looking at   
you re blind to his flaws   
but when it s you 
flaws is all you see 
hmm 
mmm 
is it you 
yeah  it s me  babe 
hi

lenny is your secret admirer 
nothing s impossible 
no  some things are 
like a man that sends you an
orchid  the most romantic flower

and sends you a yellow rose 
that s the kind of flower   
that someone sends their sick
grandmother in the hospital 
i ll get it 
mom  please 
can you just listen to me 
i read that note  okay 
a man like that   
a poet  he doesn t take
a woman to a styx concert 
well  it s different 
so is a peanut butter
and glue sandwich 
that doesn t mean
you eat it 
holly  i like this guy

would it kill you
to give him a chance 
princess zoe

ciao 
  domo arigato  mr  roboto  
  mata ahoo hima de  
  domo arigato  mr  roboto  
  himitsu wo shiri tai  
  you re wondering who i am  
  secret  secret 
i ve got a secret  
  machine or mannequin  
lenny  i don t think
that s styx 
no  they re kilroy  they re
a tribute band to styx 
  secret  secret 
i ve got a secret   
yeah  the singer s not
as good as the original 
but if you close your eyes  you
can t even tell the difference 
yeah  you can tell 
we have a question 
mel  put those
two tables together 
kid  can it wait 
i m a little busy 
no  it s really important 
it s for our school assignment 
due tomorrow 
we need to know what the
perfect man would do   
as a follow up
to the orchid 
well  can t we talk
about it tomorrow 
wait  what could be more
important than the perfect man 
duh  perfect shoes 
lance  please 
don t  lance  please  me 
take a break
and help these girls out 
you try the new shiraz   
sit at your table and let good
old lance handle the floor 
all right  five minutes 
don t play with your hair
at the bar  lance 
so  what are you writing a school
paper on  dating or something 
yeah 
well  what class would that be  english 
i m looking at romantic
heroes  like in literature 
you know   
romeo 
right  or heathcliff 
taking guys like that   
and comparing them to their
real life counterparts 
but you don t believe
in romance 
i m stretching 
well  girls  i m really
not an authority on this 
hot 
what makes today s
perfect man perfect 
what is it that he says or does
that makes him a woman s perfect man 
well  that depends 
every woman s different 
but yet  orchids work
for all of them 
well  as a gesture  they do 
i mean  but that s just a   
that s a beginning 
that s   
he s got to have
a deeper connection than that 
he s got to know
what makes her tick 
which is why  if you don t
know who the woman is   
it s rather a moot point 
she listens to patsy cline
when she s sad 
hypothetically 
say she does 
then what 
patsy cline s her sad music 
wait a minute 
now 
this is very happy music 
keep it  but you know what 
even if he does
cheer her up   
he can t be a guy
that s afraid of tears 
  babe  i love you   
it s like he wrote
it about us 
what if she s into word games 
scrabble  you know 
stuff like that 
oh  yeah  good stuff 
a little wit  a little
wordplay  i like that 
and if she s been
dumped a lot  then what 
a lot 
that s a tough one 
i guess the perfect guy
would be   
he d be someone who could   
he could be anywhere
in the world   
but he chooses
to be with her because   
life is better with her
by his side 
what do you think 
did i pass the test 
very nice to meet you 
stop it 
big problem 
hey  cutie 
hi  amber 
hey  okay  designer dress 
bias cut  wedding chic 
where s the problem 
it s a small fortune 
no  that s a lie 
it s a large fortune 
it s your day  do it 
really 
yeah 
i adore you 
okay  what about the cake 
you know what  girls 
i got to go to work  really 
i was thinking of something
layers  chocolate  strawberry 
amber  let s talk
about it tomorrow 
lance  step away
from the purse 
she s gorgeous 
yeah 
together they look like the winners
of a genetic lottery  come on 
here  let me get this
for you  you got it 
thanks  well  lenny  l   
whoops  we re wet  watch it 
i don t even know
what to say  it s been   
now  jean 
i had a fantastic time 
i got to tell you 
i really  you know 
i really  i could get
used to this 
you re a good kisser 
it was a really good time 
all right  so 
i ll see you at work  okay 
my shoes 
i m sorry 
how was the  80s flashback 
you scared me 
his stupid car is louder
than a jumbo jet 
he probably woke up
the whole entire neighborhood 
holly  for me  would you
give lenny a chance 
mom  for me 
would you go slow this time 
you don t know
who else is out there 
no  but here s what i do know 
tonight i had
a pretty good time 
 oh what a tangled web
we weave
 when first
we practice to deceive  
who wants to talk
about what that means 
he needs to write her a letter  who 
the perfect man 
adam  care to elucidate 
yeah  you 
what do you think sir walter
scott was talking about 
you re going to forge a
letter  i have to  if i don t   
my mom s going to be
walking down the aisle   
to the sound of mr  roboto 
well  i think  it s that
lies get complicated 
because 
usually if you tell a lie 
you have to tell another lie 
except she s totally going to
recognize my handwriting 
she won t recognize mine 
true 
and each lie turns into
another lie   
and another lie  and it
makes things complicated 
until  eventually  you re left
with this big mess of lies   
that you can t
find your way out of 
we ll do it right after school  perfect 
perfect 
all right  i ll buy that 
alana  what does  tangled web 
symbolize

but what can i say 
desperate times call
for desperate measures 
trust me  if you met lenny   
you d lick the envelope
and lend me a stamp

to think things out 
what kind of things 
well  you know

whether she s going to form   
a powerful alliance
with a prince or go it alone

hi  girls 
mommy  are you sick 
what 
you don t look normal 
i got a letter 
what kind of letter 
it s a love letter 
what does it say 
one second 
hey  you  give me that 
 my dearest jean 
 the letters j e a n used to spell
out just another word for denim  
this guy is great  mom 
 but  since i found you  i
hear those four letter words   
 and all i think about is
another four letter word 
 love  l o v e  
love 
yeah 
he loves you 
that s what he said 
zoe  he s trying
to be romantic 
 being near you is like
standing on a triple word score  
he plays scrabble 
 everything matters
three times as much 
 the sun shines three times
as bright   
 and i am three times
as happy  
what s this 
he gave you a present 
i like him now 
smart  witty  romantic 
you can t still think
this guy is lenny  right 
it is kind of hard to picture
lenny playing scrabble 
come on  mom  let s dance 
you go  mom 
mom 
no 
come on 
i can t believe it 
and he sent you
a present  too 
yeah  a cd of a band i d
never heard of  but i loved 
it s like he knows me better
than i know myself 
so why is he hiding 
he s not hiding  he s just    just what 
excuse me  can you help me 
dinner s ready 
there must be something wrong
with him 
who 
mr  wonderful 
what  no  there s nothing
wrong with him  he s perfect 
then why all the secrecy 
why doesn t he just come on over 
show his face  and say hello 
like a normal person 
listen to yourself 
the man wants to be
the least bit romantic   
and all of sudden you think
he s not normal 
how do i know if he is  and if
he is  what does he look like 
is he tall  is he short 
does he have blond  curly hair 
straight  black hair  what 
i bet he has a big 
fat wart on his nose 
i bet that he s really 
really handsome 
and how would you know 
he writes like
he s really handsome 
honey  have you seen pictures
of shakespeare  bald  skinny 
does that
even really matter 
yes  because you can t have
a relationship with a man   
you ve never laid eyes on 
honey  i ve got a party of 50
coming in a half an hour 
it will only
take a second 
oh  you can take my picture 
just be sure to get my good side 
over here  brad pitt  over
here  david spade  not so cute 
no  i m just swamped 
i m sorry 
hey  uncle ben  what s that stuff
you put on top of your spinach salad 
parmesan what 
cheese 
ben  it s a nice name 
uncomplicated 
dependable  ben 
and it s way better than lenny 
and he s way cuter than lenny 
don t you be mean about
lenny  he s a good egg 
just not the egg for me 
i like this egg  i want
this egg to be my boyfriend 
when s he coming over 
as soon as he gets back 
well  where did he go 
he s opening up a new
restaurant in china 
and the phone lines there
are impossible  evidently 
so as soon as he gets back 
he s going to call 
cool  what else
does the letter say 
that s private 
excuse me 
china 
how are we ever going
to get a stamp from china 
we won t 
now that he s traveling 
he asked her to send   
her e mail address
to his e mail address 
he has
an e mail address 
brooklyn boy  this new
account that i m setting up 
well  at least it s consistent 
since everyone lies in cyberspace 
but we can t use the computer at
my house in case my mom finds it 
i d offer ours  except
my brother s on 24l7   
buying those
little yu gi oh cards on ebay 
who else 
it s kind of messy 
it s kind of dark 
oh  yeah 
should be on 
thank you so much
for letting me do this 
you must think that i m crazy  but
at least my mom s happy  you know 
it s such a change   
 cause she usually spends most of
her time depressed or with idiots 
maybe i should try it 
my mom only smiles once a month
when the alimony check comes 
and if she s been dumped
a lot  then what 
a lot 
that s a tough one 
i guess the perfect guy
would be   
he could be anywhere
in the world   
but he chooses
to be with her because   
life is better with her
by his side 
dear passionate baker   
i m spending my days with
very serious business people   
and i know i should be listening
to every word they say   
but all i keep thinking is   
what am i doing
all the way in china 
unbelievable  listen to this 
come on  let s go 
it s from ben 
 i planned this restaurant
before i d ever laid eyes on you 
 if i had to do it over   
 i d buy the building right
next to yours and open there  
he d rather be with me 
why don t you write him back 
good 
excuse me 
dear brooklyn boy   
if your food s half as good
as your letters   
nothing would make me happier than
having your restaurant on my block 
but i d hate to deprive
the nation of china   
of that kind of satisfaction  so
open your restaurant there first 
dear passionate baker   
as long as
i m in the kitchen cooking   
it doesn t matter where i am 
it s a real specific kind
of satisfaction  isn t it   
cooking for people 
i m only a baker  but i put as
much creativity and passion   
into my cakes
as a painter puts on a canvas 
granted  when all s said and
done  all i ve made is a cake 
but then again  you can t eat
the mona lisa 
waiting  the passionate baker 
dear passionate baker   
creativity and passion  huh 
i m starting to figure out
what makes you tick 
and as for the mona lisa   
after a few thousand years   
people are going to get tired
of her smile 
but a good fudge brownie
is eternal 
dear brooklyn boy   
i m modest about some things 
but not this 
i make the best fudge brownies
on the planet 
well  it just so happens   
i make the best
homemade ice cream 
ice cream and brownies 
now that s a good combo 
that s all i m looking for 
my own good combo 
someone i can bring out
the best in   
and someone that brings out
the best in me 
how you doing 
surprise  surprise 
lenny  there s something
i need to tell you 
we don t need words 
i know what you re going to say 
and i feel the exact same way 
no  this is important
for me to say 
i met someone   
 and his name is lenny   
 and he s rocking my world  
i know 
and i know you re scared 
i m scared  too 
but i also know if the
world turned upside down   
baby  i know you d always
be around my mind 
the best of times 
these are  the best of times  
i met someone else 
what 
i mean  i didn t meet
someone  but i might 
but the perfect man is standing
right here  next to my cuddles 
lenny  i m sorry 
i really am 
you are a great guy 
i m sorry this wasn t   
 the best of times  
  these are
the worst of times   
hey 
i m in the middle of writing my mom
an e mail and she just logged on 
im her 
should i 
yeah  it will make ben
seem more real  won t it 
okay 
fancy running into you here 
what time is it there 
late 
i thought it would be morning 
it is  late morning 
what are you doing 
just thinking 
about what 
you d be bored 
try me 
if i stop replying 
you ll know i fell asleep 
well  i have kids 
have i mentioned that 
no  that s great 
two daughters 
seven and sixteen 
they re lucky to have you
as a mom 
you are the only person
on earth who would say that 
and it s just because
you haven t met me 
i ve made
so many mistakes 
everyone makes mistakes 
yeah  well  i make
whoppers  over and over   
and my kids are the ones
who suffer 
it s not fair 
this wasn t the plan 
you know 
i had a big future in mind
when i was younger 
i was going to be
a famous baker 
like julia child 
but with desserts 
i was going to go
to a fancy cooking school 
write cookbooks 
make people fall in love
with baking again 
i had
all the applications  too 
i was in the middle of filling them
out when i learned i was pregnant 
i thought
it was good news 
a baby fit into my
happily ever after plan just fine 
but it didn t fit
into the guy s 
or maybe it was me
that didn t fit 
whichever  i was on my own 
so you had your kid instead
of fulfilling your dream 
i guess i did 
if you had to do it all over  would
you have gone to school instead 
life definitely would have
been easier if i d done that 
gotten my act together first 
had kids later 
but those kids   
wouldn t be holly
and zoe 
and life without holly and
zoe  i can t even imagine it 
it s just no life at all 
special message   
to all you bloggers out there
being raised by single moms

the flowers and the letters
and the e mails and everything 
the phone call  a
friend of mine did that 
but it wasn t all made up 
there was a man  there is 
most of what i wrote
came from him 
so there s a man out there
laughing at me  too 
no  he doesn t know 
he thought   
how could you be
so cruel 
i wasn t trying to be cruel 
i was trying
to make you happy 
well  you have a lot
to learn about happiness 
you haven t exactly
showed me a road map  mom 
oh  so this is my fault  i
brought this humiliation on myself 
what  because we moved
around a little bit 
a little 
whatever  a lot 
you never seemed to mind 
yes  i did  you just never heard
any of it if it wasn t about you 
that is not true  i hear
everything you say to me 
you hear 
but you don t listen 
you never listen
to anything i want 
all right  fine 
what do you want 
i want a mom that sees in herself
what zoe and i see every day 
that s talented
and pretty and funny   
and cooks great
and dances great   
and doesn t need a man
to be those things 
okay  so maybe
the perfect man wasn t real 
but the perfect you is 
s l l e n c e 
hi 
hi 
i m sorry that i didn t
call you back 
i ve been really busy 
i drew you something 
 princess holly  
well  a side of her anyway 
i realized she doesn t
need an army to protect her 
you don t let anybody close enough
to hurt you in the first place 
wait  holly 
i want to move 
what 
i hate this place 
i m over it 
and i want to move now 
we ve moved more times for
you than i can even count 
and just this once 
i want to move for me 
hi  hi  i m adam  holly s friend 
is she home 
no  she s out
getting packing boxes 
why 
we re moving 
arizona  red rocks 
you want her to call 
no 
thank you 
could you give this to her 
sure 
and tell her she only saw
one side of the drawing 
i was inspired 
i miss you 
why did you bug out
on me 
newsflash 
everyone s scared 
that s no reason
to run away 
it s what my mom does 
and you want to end up
like your mom 
some role model 
i heard once that   
iove is friendship on fire 
that s how i feel
about you 
do you really have
to go 
holly  guess what 
i get to be in a spelling bee 
c o o l 
what are you doing 
unpacking 
yeah  but why 
i thought that we all agreed that
it was time for a new adventure 
this is our new adventure 
staying is our new adventure 
what 
why can t you ever do
anything that i want 
i want to be alone 
nobody wants to be alone 
i do 
okay  i m through with these
people and i want new ones 
unfortunately  honey pie  new
people are only new for a day 
after that 
they re just people 
who will excite you 
disappoint you   
scare you a little bit 
and  boy  i know how tempting it
is to run away when that happens 
it s good for avoiding things 
but the problem is you end up   
avoiding yourself 
avoiding people you love 
you end up avoiding life 
so  i ve decided to start
setting an example for you girls 
i m going to try showing you
what sticking it out looks like 
really get to know people 
and let people
get to know us 
i don t promise to be any
good at it  but i will try 
because i want you and zoe to
be better at this than i am 
i want you to learn
how to let people in 
he s a sweet boy  i think
it would be worth it

but i don t think so

i should stay this way   
until i get my feet
back on the ground 
i see  yeah

you know  i should probably
take a dating moratorium  too

get my head together and   
exactly

staying turned out to be   
the greatest adventure of all 
and let me tell you  it has
made me do some crazy things 
like plan ahead and paint my room
and hang pictures on the wall 
i mean  i used a nail
and everything
