entire us spy satellite program
which he s gonna sell to a buyer
from that auction site
on your computer last night 
bob   
if we lose control of our satellites 
we re completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks 
that s why i had to go back to
your office and get you  jet 
i need your super sweet
accounting skills
to help me figure out the
last piece of this puzzle
which is the transaction
number from the winning bid 
that ll tell us where
the deal is going down 
that way  we can get the black badger 
i can t do it without you  jet 
stop the car 
you stop the car right now 
stop the car 
okay  okay 
that s a great idea  jet 
we should get off the grid right now 
calvin  whoa 
all right  we re clear 
okay 
okay  let s just take
some deep breaths 
okay  deep breaths 
all you gotta do is get out of this car
and have a rational

let me tell you something about harris 
you can t trust her  all right 
she s already trying to frame
me for my partner s murder 
you killed your partner 
no 
i would never do that 
the black badger killed my partner 
let me explain to you something  dude 
this is what happened 
after the black badger stole the
satellite encryption codes 
my partner phil and i tracked
him to a penthouse in kiev 
hey  phil 
yeah 
i ll see you on the other side 
see you on the other side 
all right 
god  i love that guy 
bob  he knew we were coming 
so he set a trap 
hey  bob  bob 
no 
bob  phil was my partner 
my teammate
and i couldn t save him 
no 
 explosion 
it was awful  cal 
it was a setup 
right from the get go 
damn  man 
the black badger was never there 
i should ve been the one
on that elevator  not phil 
god 
okay  bob  please   
i m begging you  man  can
you just let me go home 
cj  i totally understand 
but right now  agent

up the yin yang 
she s got contract killers

larry 
thought you retired

but you re worth a lot of
money  bob  dead or alive 
well  tough luck 
because i ve got back up

jet 
 groans 
okay 
 phone ringing 
hey  baby  i know 
i m sorry i m late 
the stupid koplin deposition ran long 
i m leaving right now 
i ll meet you at the house 
no  no  no 
don t go home 
don t go home 
why  what s going on 
nothing  nothing 
i m just running late  too 
so i was gonna say let s just
meet at dr  dan s office 
yeah  okay 
is everything all right 
yeah  yeah  why 
everything s fine 
uh  because you kind of sound like
ray liotta at the end of goodfellas 
 laughs  what 
that s so funny  babe 
that s such a good reference 
that s classic mags right there 
so  okay  so you re not
gonna go home  right 
okay  fine 
i won t go home 
i ll meet you at dr  dan s 
see you soon 
okay  all right  bye 
all right  bye 
get in 
 stammering  i m gonna
address the elephant
in the room 
okay  first of all  you   
you guys  i want to say sorry to 
because what you re probably
thinking is not what happened 
accidents 
i know you re like 
 how can you accidentally
pistol whip somebody
 and shoot somebody  
well  it can happen 
okay  today is proof
that it can happen  so   
i m glad i got to
get that off my chest 
relax  mr  joyner 
i believe you 
okay  thank you 
trust me  i know a scared shitless
civilian when i see one 
you don t have to convince me 
you got him over here 
that is me 
right now  i m not comfortable 
okay  i am scared  okay 
i don t have no shit in my system 
if i sat down on a toilet 
nothing s coming out 
farts or just air 
 slow whistles 
 hissing 
it d sound like lasers 
thank you for that description 
mr  joyner 
let me explain something 
bob s last forced psych eval
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality 
bob became obsessed with a ghost 
a figment of his imagination 
he started calling 
 the black badger  
this obsession led to an instability 
first reported by his partner 
phil  three weeks ago 
just before phil
was killed in the field 
do you know how phil died 
yeah  uh  bob told me that
the black badger killed him 
what 
what 
mr  joyner  bob stone
is the black badger 
phil was bob s partner of six years 
his best friend 
see you on the other side 
see you on the other side 
hey  bob 
agent harris  after he stole
the satellite encryption codes
bob betrayed phil 
no 
he killed him to cover his tracks 
and  after that  bob went rogue 
this is all that s left of phil 
um  this is pornhub 
oh  shit  shit 
shit  sorry 
there you go 
calvin  oh  oh  god 
oh  i didn t see that coming 
 breathes heavily 
oh  man 
it s a hell of a way to go 
okay  wait a minute 
why wouldn t bob just go sell the
satellite encryption codes himself 
because in a black market 
blind bidding situation
the buyer and the seller 
they don t know each other 
they need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up
and when to make the exchange 
the transaction number from the
auction site gives them that 
which means bob still needs you 
which is why we find ourselves
in a little catch and release
scenario 
you are the only one bob trusts 
that s why we re
putting you in the field 
the next time you re with bob 
press this button 
we re going to have him cold 
now  go take care of your marriage 
oh  one more thing 
don t tell your wife shit 
all right 
maggie  i just don t know
what s wrong 
i mean  the man that i married 
the person i knew in high school 
he was filled with
drive and desire  i mean   
we used to sneak off every lunch hour
and make out under the gym bleachers 
like  that guy  back then 
he wanted things  you know 
dr  dan  hmm 
hey  i m sorry i m late  i
couldn t find the parking 
hi  no  no  it s okay 
we got started without you 
babe  calvin 
this is dr  dan 
hello  calvin 
oh  shit  oh  jeez  what s the matter 
holy shit  get behind me 
honey    calvin  what 
it s okay  maggie 
it s okay  just relax 
this is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process 
it is 
what 
it is 
it absolutely is 
calvin  this is a very safe place 
please  sit down 
this is not a safe place  no  no  no 
honey  it s a   
no  this is most definitely
not a safe place 
me and my wife
are leaving  let s go 
no  no  no  you are
going to sit down   
and we are going to go through
this therapeutic process   
yes   together  as a couple 
um    fine  fine  fine 
sit down  thank you 
fine 
okay  guys 
why don t we start off
with a little bit of word association 
okay 
this is exciting 
i ve heard this can really
open a couple up 
uh  maggie  i m going to
offer you a word 
and you respond however you re moved to
from here 
okay 
black 
white 
water 
ocean 
sunshine 
happy 
i m very impressed  maggie 
really 
you re very in tune 
i m very in tune 
calvin  you re next 
i do not want to do this 
relax  calvin 
there are no wrong answers 
up 
down 
mmm 
 mmm   what is that 
what re you writing in your book 
it s fine  don t freak out 
nobody s freaking out 
i just don t understand
the rules to the game 
freaking out 
let s switch gears for a second  okay 
why don t we try a simple
role playing exercise 
calvin  you be calvin
and i will become maggie 
 gasps  mmm 
i m confused 
it s called  soul gazing  
stare into my soul
and i ll stare into yours 
maggie  this   
hey  shh 
there s no talking 
and don t look away 
 whispers 
stare into my soul 
you are not my   
shh  there s no talking 
babe  i m not staring   
 whispers  me and you 
stay with me  i m your wife 
you are not my wife 
 both exclaiming 
 gasps 
how could you hit your wife 
how can i   
how can i what 
you hit your wife 
no   
he hit me 
okay 
he hit you 
okay

i know what you re   
come here 
oh  my god 
you   
you know what 
we re leaving  let s go 
this is not real 
it s real to me 
you know what  calvin 
if you can t commit
to working on our marriage 
then you need to let me know 
maggie  you   
 door opens 
 chuckling 
what 
oh  my god 
you re   
something s not right 
come on  jet  listen 
come on  come on  jet 
now  i know things got a
little rough there at the end 
but the truth is  with all the heat
that you have coming down on you 
maggie is definitely safer without you 
and  trust me  when this
whole thing is said and done
and you basically save
the entire free world 
she s going to forgive you 
it ll all work itself out 
it ll all work itself out 
okay  bob  you know  i m sick
of playing games with you 
where s the real dr  dan 
 mumbling 
what what 
oh  my    dr  dan  i had
nothing to do with this 
he s fine  i ll get you
some water in a little bit 
 mumbling 
thanks  doc 
 door closes 
you know   
that s it  that is it 
that is it 
all right  jet 
i see that harris has
given you a button to push 
relax  i would ve taken the same
deal  too  if i was in your shoes 
otherwise  she wouldn t let
you out of her sight  right 
it makes perfect sense 
but you re not going to
press the button  right 
you got the top secret
satellite codes 
yes or no 
this ain t the time to bullshit me 
okay  my ass is sweating 
i m nervous 
don t bullshit me 
of course not  dude 
hey  hey  come on 
of course  i don t have the codes 
why would i go through
all this trouble  then 
i need your skill set  jet 
to help me get the bank transaction
numbers to the winning bid 
we already know it s going down tonight
from the countdown on your computer 
now  all we need is
the  where  
and the bank transaction numbers
will give us the  where  
that s why i need you 
your job gives you access to
exactly that kind of information 
then we can get the badger 
we can get the buyer
in one fell swoop 
and it ll all be over tonight 
please  i swear 
you gotta believe me 
can t you just get us
the transaction number 
not when the money originates
from an offshore account 
when that happens  then only a certified
international banking official
can access it 
but  it shouldn t be a problem 
we just give this guy the offshore
account numbers that you gave me 
then he can give us
the transaction number
without knowing that he s
committing treason when he does it 
sound familiar 
ouch  low blow  cj 
hey  besides  it s only
treason if we re wrong 
who s this mystery man 
it s trevor 
 laughing 
trevor 
trevor  this week
just keeps getting better 
you know  i mean   
robbie wheirdicht and calvin  the
golden jet  joyner in my office

my client s all on me to get
this stuff handled right away 
so  you know  if we could   
say no more  it s my pleasure

digital red tape 
i m happy to help  you know

pinning this whole thing on you 
it s gotta be her 
 sighs  i don t know  jet 
i m pretty sure she thinks
i m the black badger

hey  just for the record 
i think you d make a great dad 
did you just fake this whole thing 
yeah  kinda 
oh  you gotta be shitting me glory

and  hey  between me and you 
i know you ve been
struggling a little bit 
you know what i m struggling
with right now  bob 
not whooping your ass 
 chuckles  okay  jet

you know why 
because i don t have a bulletproof vest
and i don t have a gun 
which means that you
are my bulletproof vest 
my little black ass is gonna stay
behind you  you re not leaving me 
that s exactly why
you should stay up here 
look  if you went down in that
garage and you got shot to death

i d be super bummed out 
i don t want that 
it s safer for you up here 
if something happened up here 
what am i supposed to do  bob 
how do i get your attention 
make a bird call 
 squawking 
does that sound like
a bird to you  huh 
that s my biggest weakness 
i can t make bird noises

my best friend is here with me 
and he taught me what it means
to be the hero of your own story 
would you hold this for me  please 
being the hero of your own story
isn t about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains 
it s about overcoming
bullies in your life 
whatever or whomever they may be 
it s about putting it all out there
for everyone
to see 
and it s realizing that  in life 
the most important thing
that you can be   
is yourself
