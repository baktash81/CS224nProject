the black badger killed my partner
let me explain to you something dude
this is what happened
after the black badger stole the
satellite encryption codes
my partner phil and i tracked
him to a penthouse in kiev
hey phil
yeah
ill see you on the other side
see you on the other side
all right
god i love that guy
bob he knew we were coming
so he set a trap
hey bob bob
no
bob phil was my partner
my teammate
and i couldnt save him
no
explosion
it was awful cal
it was a setup
right from the getgo
damn man
the black badger was never there
i shouldve been the one
on that elevator not phil
god
okay bob please
im begging you man can
you just let me go home
cj i totally understand
but right now agent
harris and her taskforce
has that place surveilled
up the yinyang
shes got contract killers
looking for us
your place isnt safe
oh my god maggie
maggie what the hell am i
supposed to do about maggie
shouts get down jet
calvin screams

money bob dead or alive
well tough luck

jet
groans
okay
phone ringing
hey baby i know
im sorry im late
the stupid koplin deposition ran long
im leaving right now

dont go home
why whats going on
nothing nothing
im just running late too
so i was gonna say lets just
meet at dr dans office
yeah okay
is everything all right
yeah yeah why
everythings fine
uh because you kind of sound like
ray liotta at the end of goodfellas
laughs what

thats such a good reference
thats classic mags right there
so okay so youre not
gonna go home right
okay fine
i wont go home
ill meet you at dr dans
see you soon
okay all right bye
all right bye
get in
stammering im gonna
address the elephant
in the room
okay first of all you
you guys i want to say sorry to
because what youre probably
thinking is not what happened
accidents
i know youre like
how can you accidentally
pistolwhip somebody
and shoot somebody
well it can happen
okay today is proof
that it can happen so
im glad i got to
get that off my chest
relax mr joyner
i believe you
okay thank you
trust me i know a scaredshitless
civilian when i see one
you dont have to convince me
you got him over here
that is me
right now im not comfortable
okay i am scared okay
i dont have no shit in my system
if i sat down on a toilet
nothings coming out
farts or just air
slow whistles
hissing
itd sound like lasers
thank you for that description
mr joyner
let me explain something
bobs last forced psych eval
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality
bob became obsessed with a ghost
a figment of his imagination
he started calling
the black badger
this obsession led to an instability
first reported by his partner
phil three weeks ago
just before phil
was killed in the field
do you know how phil died
yeah uh bob told me that
the black badger killed him
what
what
mr joyner bob stone
is the black badger
phil was bobs partner of six years
his best friend
see you on the other side
see you on the other side
hey bob
agent harris after he stole
the satellite encryption codes
bob betrayed phil
no
he killed him to cover his tracks
and after that bob went rogue
this is all thats left of phil
um this is pornhub
oh shit shit
shit sorry
there you go
calvin oh oh god
oh i didnt see that coming
breathes heavily
oh man
its a hell of a way to go
okay wait a minute
why wouldnt bob just go sell the
satellite encryption codes himself
because in a black market
blindbidding situation
the buyer and the seller
they dont know each other
they need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up
and when to make the exchange
the transaction number from the
auction site gives them that
which means bob still needs you
which is why we find ourselves
in a little catchandrelease
scenario
you are the only one bob trusts
thats why were
putting you in the field
the next time youre with bob
press this button
were going to have him cold
now go take care of your marriage
oh one more thing
dont tell your wife shit
all right
maggie i just dont know
whats wrong
i mean the man that i married
the person i knew in high school
he was filled with
drive and desire i mean
we used to sneak off every lunch hour
and make out under the gym bleachers
like that guy back then
he wanted things you know
dr dan hmm
hey im sorry im late i
couldnt find the parking
hi no no its okay
we got started without you
babe calvin
this is dr dan
hello calvin
oh shit oh jeez whats the matter
holy shit get behind me
honey calvin what

its okay just relax
this is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process
it is
what
it is
it absolutely is
calvin this is a very safe place
please sit down
this is not a safe place no no no
honey its a
no this is most definitely
not a safe place
me and my wife

no no no you are
going to sit down
and we are going to go through
this therapeutic process
yestogether as a couple
um fine fine fine

im swaddling you
i know what youre doing
im swaddling you
i know what youre
come here
oh my god
you
you know what
were leaving lets go
this is not real
its real to me
you know what calvin
if you cant commit
to working on our marriage
then you need to let me know
maggie you
door opens
chuckling
what
oh my god
youre
somethings not right
come on jet listen
come on come on jet
now i know things got a
little rough there at the end
but the truth is with all the heat
that you have coming down on you
maggie is definitely safer without you
and trust me when this
whole thing is said and done
and you basically save
the entire free world
shes going to forgive you
itll all work itself out
itll all work itself out
okay bob you know im sick
of playing games with you
wheres the real dr dan
mumbling
whatwhat
oh my dr dan i had
nothing to do with this
hes fine ill get you
some water in a little bit
mumbling
thanks doc
door closes
you know
thats it that is it
that is it
all right jet
i see that harris has
given you a button to push
relax i wouldve taken the same
deal too if i was in your shoes
otherwise she wouldnt let
you out of her sight right
it makes perfect sense
but youre not going to
press the button right
you got the topsecret
satellite codes
yes or no
this aint the time to bullshit me
okay my ass is sweating
im nervous
dont bullshit me
of course not dude
hey hey come on
of course i dont have the codes
why would i go through
all this trouble then
i need your skill set jet
to help me get the bank transaction
numbers to the winning bid
we already know its going down tonight
from the countdown on your computer
now all we need is
the where
and the bank transaction numbers
will give us the where
thats why i need you
your job gives you access to
exactly that kind of information
then we can get the badger
we can get the buyer
in one fell swoop
and itll all be over tonight
please i swear
you gotta believe me
cant you just get us
the transaction number
not when the money originates
from an offshore account
when that happens then only a certified
international banking official
can access it
but it shouldnt be a problem
we just give this guy the offshore
account numbers that you gave me
then he can give us
the transaction number
without knowing that hes
committing treason when he does it
sound familiar
ouch low blow cj
hey besides its only
treason if were wrong
whos this mystery man
its trevor
laughing
trevor
trevor this week
just keeps getting better
you know i mean
robbie wheirdicht and calvin the

my clients all on me to get
this stuff handled right away

digital red tape

youre like a chocolate
google mimics beeping
bob dont do that

sighs

were gonna catch the buyer and
the badger just like that
phone chimes
boston
sighs
were gonna need a plane
you ever steal a plane before
i stole some starbursts one time
mmmhmm

check it out
the universe provides
calvin oh

bob
bob

breathing heavily
door opens
hey uh i need a plane

his names snake gyllenhaal
he guards my lunch
okay thats enough
its gotta be harris right
what do you mean
i mean shes gotta be
the black badger
its the only thing that makes sense
i mean shes had access
to the encryption codes
and shes so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you
its gotta be her
sighs i dont know jet
im pretty sure she thinks
im the black badger
she worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room
engine sputtering
hold on wait wait

were completely outta gas
oh my oh
screaming
were going down jet
theres nothing i can do
oh shit
really quickly
whats the one thing you wish
youd done in your life
the one thing i wish i hadnt done
is not get in a plane with a guy
who didnt check the goddamned fuel
why wouldnt you check the fuel
no something thats real
whats the one thing you
regret not doing for you
oh my god
i think were gonna die
wailing

i regret not being a father
maggie i shouldve gave you a kid

continues crying
sighs
that wasnt so hard right what
hey just for the record
i think youd make a great dad
did you just fake this whole thing
yeah kinda
oh you gotta be shitting me glory
no not at all
i just thought that maybe
facing your own death situation
might help motivate you
to clarify some of your goals in life
and hey between me and you
i know youve been
struggling a little bit
you know what im struggling
with right now bob
not whooping your ass
chuckles okay jet
hey youre really cute when you cry
stop it enough
i dont get it
i mean if these
coordinates are correct
we should be standing
right on top of it
well the deal doesnt go down
for another 30 minutes jet
so were kinda early
no
why would you do it
out in the open like this
