a place of unparalleled beauty
and fecundity 
these islands may host
to a vibrant ecosystem below 
a vast organism known
as the coral reef 
life in this watery metropolis
thrives among the twists and turns 
nooks and crannies and back alleys 
and near the reef s edge 
the varied and colorful terrain
gives way to a small town
by the name of bikini bottom 
here  one can find
crustaceans   
money 
   sea stars   
   octopi   
   various and diverse plankton   
   the occasional
squirrel scientist   
good morning  otto 
you re almost ready for the world 
good morning  the machines will rise
to become masters
over all organic life 
   and yes  the sea sponge

with his beloved pet snail gary

chancellor  look  look at me 
3 000 years old
and check out my skin 
it s like a baby s butt 
ageless  sire  looking fresh 
i owe it to my subjects
to look fabulous  don t you think 
there are other obligations  sire 
like ruling and stuff  let s see 
i need your signature
on these taxes  decrees 
this here declaration of war
and my paycheck 
  is that right 
  yeah 
very good 
chancellor 
when will you learn to focus
on what really matters 
a monarch s regime is only as powerful
as his skin care regime 
word 
you know  some say i have a face
like a greek god 
well  you are a greek god  so   
wait  is   
  is that a wrinkle 
  where 
it is  it s a wrinkle 
i look like an old avocado that s been
left and forgotten in the fridge 
here it comes 
i m ugly 
now  where is it 
the crawly thing
with the round shell and the eyes 
where is it 
here you go  sire  your royal snail 
thank you 
this mollusk has the rejuvenating
power of a thousand facials 
what  is it empty 
take it away 
bring me another sea snail at once 
  chancellor 
  okay 
full disclosure  man 
we re out of snails 
what 
in fact  the entire
snail population has been   
what s the word  yeah  depleted 
you re telling me there are
  no more snails 
  there are no more snails 
  and you re confident of that 
  relatively confident 
chancellor  for the love of hermes 
my kingdom for a snail 
no  i m being hasty 
half my kingdom for a snail 
no  a boon  yes 
i ll grant a boon to whomever
shall bring me a snail 
gotcha 
i ll draw up the decree  sire 
a royal decree from king poseidon 
 to all citizens of the sea 
 the king requires a snail at once 
 blah blah blah
skin care blah blah    
wait a minute 
a snail 
no  it s too perfect 
get rid of gary  get rid of spongebob 
oh  yeah

spongebob 
patrick  if something
were to happen to gary  i  well   
i don t know what i d do 
i m sorry  buddy 
hey  maybe he left a clue 
look  a clue 
gary s been snail napped 
and taken
to the lost city of atlantic city 
really 
that s awesome 
now we know where he is 
not really that awesome  patrick 
listen to this 
 made famous by the glitzy
palace poseidon calls home 
 the lost city
of atlantic city is a scary 
 vice ridden cesspool
of moral depravity  
all that  and it s lost  too 
 king poseidon has proven
himself a whimsical tyrant 
 known for executing his subjects
by beheading them
 in a flamboyant floor
show extravaganza  
 our advice for those
travelling here is   
    don t  
this king poseidon
sounds like a tough customer 
yeah  tough 
so what  this is about friends 
and friends don t let friends
become somebody else s face cream 
not what friends do 
so what if it s dangerous and scary 
so what 
what is stopping me right now
from going there  rescuing gary
and standing up to this king poseidon 
  i don t know 
  well  i do 
  what is it 
  i   
   don t have the courage 
gary 
tartar sauce 
what s the next best thing to courage 
resolve 
  fortitude 
  nah 
  commitment 
  nope 
  wherewithal  bravery 
  no 
  valor  grit 
  what  no 
  heroism  gallantry 
  nah 
  moxie 
  a buddy  a wingman 
a wingman 
a friend 
really  patrick  you d go with me 
yeah  right behind you 
do i smell a road trip 
that could be my breath 
okey dokey 
now  let s drill down on a plan 
pat  you re in charge of transpo 
just remember  i don t drive
and you don t have a car 
beep  beep 
hey  boys 
don t know if you have any use
for this old thing 
if you re going
on any trips or journeys
or quests or rescue missions 
but if you are  otto is your ticket 
  otto 
  otto 
just tell ol  otto where you want
to go and it will take you there 
all aboard 
  you re fired

to the lost city of atlantic city
and don t ever come back 
never hurts to employ
a little hyperbole 
it is my pleasure to serve you 
bon voyage  boys 
i m ready  they re dead 
this is gonna be like
one of those buddy movies 
we re the buddies 
not sure
that really applies  patrick  but   
why not 
we re two dudes setting out
with a common goal 
we ll argue about something dumb 
fight and break up 
only to come back together
when we realize
neither could do it without the other 
it s simple yet magical 
yeah 
it feels more to me like
the journey of a singular hero 
who against all odds 
triumphs over adversity 
i say buddy movie
and you say whatever
that dumb thing was you just said 
really  dumb thing  i m dumb 
i love your sense of irony  patrick 
thank you 
i love my sense of ironing  too 
maybe if your head
wasn t packed full of sand 
you could have ironing 
well  better a head full of sand
than a head full of rocks  like yours 
that s it  stop the car 
yeah  stop the car  otto 
sorry  patrick  really 
i shouldn t have said
you have rocks in your head 
i shouldn t have said
your brain was made of sand 
that was mean and dumb 
okay  let s just forget it 
never happened 
hop on in  guys 
come on  guys 
nope

where is spongebob 
where are we 
we must be dreaming 
you amuse me  spongebob 
two people can t have the same dream 
let alone be
in that same dream at the same time 
that would be
philosophically untenable 
indeed  you proffer
a metaphysical conundrum 
wait  we re talking like smart people 
this must be a dream 
plus  we re on the surface
and we re   
   breathing air  so   
yeah 
air 
hey  town up ahead 
 goner gulch  
that s a funny name 
 the inferno saloon

of saying  no public restrooms  
hello

go anywhere

you re fired

soul on the menu
major checklist 
ghouls  goblins guard the exit 
the fire in his eyes
ain t hard to catch it 
el diablo  the haunting
taunting veterano 
it s scary  i know 
the goner gulch
where the drama is 
but don t hate the game

barge into my demon s lair   
   telling my zombies   
   that you re gonna
free their souls   
   like it ain t no thing 
well  mr  diablo 
the good thing is we re in a dream

all bent out of shape about it 
  it s not real 
   cause it s a dream 
who told you that 
that crazy bush guy 
maybe 
what he should ve told you
was it s not a dream 
he might be right  patrick

coin laundry s right down the street 
that s pathetic 
get away from those curtains 
  what  these curtains 
  these are nice curtains 
they are  so soft 
that s weird 
these curtains are making
a strange sound 
i think the curtain rod
needs some oil 
once the rod goes 
you re probably better off
getting a whole new set of curtains 
mr  diablo  do you have
any other cur   
patrick  i think
we should get out of here 
hey  everybody

and tempt you
with her fleeting games of chance 
whatever you do  don t be led astray 
don t lose focus
and don t forget why you came here

to the sanctuary
of our revered sovereign 
to rob him of his very lifeblood

how indeed dare you 
guilty 
lemont 
hold it 
if it please the court 
i d like to say something
in spongebob s defense 
it does not please the court 
sit down 
squirrel with fishbowl on head 
but  sire  a strong defense
makes for a better show 
isn t that right  audience 
all right  i ll allow it 
thank you  your honor 
ladies and gentlemen  spongebob has
always been there for me 
even going
all the way back to summer camp 
in fact  that s where we all met 
i m   
ready 
look at all the cool activities 
camping  canoeing 
seahorse back riding 
tug of war  whale watching 
do you mind 
juggling contests 
shrink wrap soccer  and more 
hey  y all critters
of the sea  look out below 
i m sandy cheeks from texas 
hi  sandy  i m spongebob 
pleased to meet ya 
does everybody wear spacesuits
in texas 
they do if they wanna
visit you underwater critters 
we all breathe air on the surface 
it s just our way
of synthesizing oxygen 
same as you do with water 
are you a scientist 
naw  i m just a squirrel 
i can t be a scientist 
even though it s kinda my dream 
sandy cheeks  you take that back 
i bet you can do anything 
really 
me a scientist 
science 
you re a hoot  little dude 
i d be just as likely
to live down here
in a glass dome with a tree in it 
you never know 
he s the one that told me 
no matter who i was 
or where i came from 
i should follow my dream 
that s a friend  people 
and that s why  in my eyes   
spongebob is no criminal 
he s the best little fella to ever
walk the sea bottom  and that s   
that s just how i feel about it  so   
please  don t hurt him 
this man broke the law 
the law of   you should stay home
 and accept the fact
that somebody stole your snail  
the law of   there s probably
nothing i can do about it  
well  in this sea star s opinion 
those laws should be broken
and spongebob is proof of it 
all he s guilty of
is having the fortitude
to try and rescue a friend 
how do i know 
i was just a lonely bump on a log
when i first met him 
hi  my name   
hi  my name   
hello  my name is spongebob 
what s your name 
i m pa pa patrick 
why are you crying  pa pa patrick 
i m homesick 
well  that s a pretty good reason 
maybe all you need is a friend 
i don t have any friends 
  well  you ve got one now 
  really 
  who is it 
  it s me 
  do you mean it 
  of course  come on 
that sweet little sponge
rescued this miserable
little sea star 
and things haven t changed
that much today  your honor 
my heart  buddy 
i don t like spongebob 
in fact  i revile him 
anyway  i  too 
met this nabob in summer camp 
i remember it like it was yesterday 
it was my big night 
the annual camp coral talent show 
and first prize
was the coveted campy award 
thank you  larry 
remember  people 
don t forget to vote 
as far as i was concerned 
the trophy was as good as mine 
hey  squidward   
quiet  i m in pregame right now 
i ve got an award to win 
aka waka maka mia
was a puffer fish 
the campy is mine 
i bathed the audience
with the sounds
of my heavenly clarinet playing 
thank you  squidward  just lovely 
thank you 
and the campy goes to   
i ll take that 
   spongebob and patrick 
no 
this isn t happening  no  mommy 
i was robbed 
and never to play the clarinet again 
no 
  squidward 
  go away 
patrick and i were
talking to one of the counselors
and guess what 
there was a big mistake
and you actually won the campy award 
that s right  yup 
  i did 
  in a landslide 
so weird
they would ve miscounted like that 
but i guess it s possible   
  nice work  squidward 
  no one deserves it more 
and don t ever stop playing this 
my clarinet 
look at me  i really did it 
which is why  even though
i can t stand spongebob 
but at the same time  well   
i love him 
i love him and i hate him 
he s like ice cream with salt on it 
because he s sweet and super annoying 
he s nice
and nails on chalkboard annoying 
okay  fine 
he s mostly super freaking annoying 
but this little nattering noodge   
   is my friend 
and he doesn t deserve to die 
i ll be saying my piece now 
if it be pleasing the court 
i suppose i could stand up here
and tell you
how spongebob changed me life 
but i won t 
i might even speak
about how he inspired me
when i was just a small time vendor
with a broken down luncheonette 
but  i won t 
heck  i d probably mention
how he encouraged me
to start me own restaurant 
you should open up
your own restaurant  someday 
the krusty krab  made famous
by me delicious krabby patties 
two for one wednesdays  by the way 
pass these around 
but  i won t 
nay  you ll hear
none such praise from me 
because it wouldn t do him
full justice 
it wouldn t begin to describe
the size of the lad s heart 
which is huge 
and he puts that heart
into everything he does 
  the cooking   
  order up 
   cleaning   
     serving up
the delicious krabby patties 
but that s the funny thing 
i used to think
me secret krabby party formula   
   was also the secret to me success 
we serve breakfast till 11 00 
by the way  12 00 on weekends 
it wasn t until spongebob
came to work for me 
that i realized the formula is more
than just a list of ingredients
and flavor capturing methods 
it s more than
a jealously guarded recipe 
the real secret formula   
   is sitting right here 
spongebob squarepants 
get ready 
maestro 
a formula is something like a recipe 
a recipe is something like a plan 
with elements and measurements 
all mixed together by a steady hand 
but careful you must be
or you ll be sad you see 
if somehow in the mix  it has no soul 
so what s the one ingredient 
that turns this awesome sauce
to liquid gold 
i ll tell ya 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
you  you 
the honey in my tea 
you know is you  you 
you  you 
the bubbles in the boil 
the one essential oil 
it s true 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
spongebob 
you  you 
what in the wide watery world 
would it be like without you 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
you  you 
the honey in my tea 
you know is you  you 
you  you 
the bubbles in the boil 
the one essential oil  it s true 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
spongebob 
you  you 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
  spongebob 
  so entertaining 
the secret to the formula is you  you 
you  you 
hilarious 
my snail

stepping on it

rather impolite  don t you think 
it was all their idea  sire 
and i   
   loved it 
wait  so you re not mad at us 
no 
it s been a while since i ve enjoyed
such toe tapping entertainment 
all is forgiven 
and all charges are dropped 
on one condition 
spongebob will return my snail to me
without any more shilly shally 
wait  what 
just hand over the snail
and you can all go free 
but    i   
spongebob 
sage  is that you

the courage you seek is inside you 
and it will come to you
in your hour of need

i m sorry  but i won t do it 
what 
i love gary too much and he loves me 
if we didn t have each other 
we d be so sad 
well  it wouldn t really matter
what you d do to us 
and look  today 
thanks to these amazing friends 
my heart feels
twice as big as it ever did 
especially after
what they risked for me 
flouting the law and defying
the mighty king of the sea 
defying  really 
i wouldn t say defying the king 
humiliating you
in front of your subjects 
  do go on 
  more like admiring 
  and totally agreeing with 
  i just came to see kelpy g 
and they did it all for me 
i m sure you d understand
if you had friends like these 
friends like these 
wait  what  friends like these 
of course i have friends like these 
i have all kinds of friends 
i have buddies  i have besties 
i have home slices  palsy walsies

chancellor  give us an exact number

what  give me that 
what about my adoring fans 
  nope

what about my personal trainer 
  my therapist

sorry 
apollo  take me now

do you mean it 
yes  but friends don t kidnap
friends  pet snails 
but i need that snail 
look  i have a horrible 
disgusting wrinkle 
jumping jellyfish 
it s the size of the mariana trench 
kidding  looks don t matter 
we don t care about little
imperfections or even big ones 
 just look at squidward 
 what s that supposed to mean 
what s important is what s inside 
and i m sure
you can be a fair and kind king
to all the creatures of the sea 
i know you ve got it in you  sir 
if you d just let
your hair down a little 
my hair  wait a minute 
are you suggesting that i don t need
this gorgeous mane of wavy locks 
that i don t require this neck clip 
be gone  perfect shiny teeth 
this is so freeing 
to heck with this chest plate
and girdle 
  too far 
  no  not at all 
no  you look great 
thank you 
i find this so exhilarating 
30 age appropriate

to stand up to a powerful king
