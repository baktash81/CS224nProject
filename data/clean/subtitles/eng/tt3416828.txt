the universe   
a vast expanse
of space and matter 
it includes all that we see 
and all that we know

orchestrated plan 
a chance series of events 
or something

and expert salsa dancer 
 singing 
 salsa music playing 
 music stops 
whoo 
i have one eye
but all my original teeth 
would you like to

no  thank you 
and this must be nectarine 
um    peaches 
semantics  my dear 
i am deeply honored 
sweet eye patch 
very gangsta 
thank you 
i like this kid 
manny  buck 
whoa 
what are you doing here 
well  i    what 
i m trying 
but how do you tell
someone they re doomed 
he s stumped   laughs 
we re not doomed  buck 
it was just a meteor shower 
and the show s over 
ahh 
oh  quite the contrary 
old chap 
it s just beginning 
you see  i found a prophecy 
 dramatic drumming 
do you mind 
boy  he really sucks the fun
out of everything  doesn t he 
fun sucker 
i read this tablet
front to back 
and the story it tells
is very disturbing 
every hundred million
years or so 
the world gets
a cosmic cleansing 
before the dinosaurs 
there were these horseshoe
crab looking thingies 
ugh  yuck 
then  at the bottom
of this mountain range 
an asteroid hit 
boom  bye bye 
next  dinosaurs 
mountain range  asteroid 
boom  bye bye 
and coming up next  mammals 
mountain range 
asteroid  boom 
bye bye 
 giggles  stupid mammals 
that s us 
 gasps 
mmm 
yep  and there she is 
the mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us 
even going underground
won t save us this time 
hey  that wasn t
there before 
and look what
it s doing to the sky 
no worries 
because i ve got a plan 
really  to stop
an asteroid 
look  the last two asteroids
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot 
and it s about to
happen again 
we ve got to go there
and see what s attracting
the asteroid 
once we know
why it s coming   
we can figure out how to
send it somewhere else 
that plan is so dumb 
i wish it had a face
so i could smack it 
let me get this straight 
instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid   
you want us to run
directly towards it 
i know it sounds suboptimal 
but the good news is   
it ll kill us
no matter where we went 
well  that s reassuring 
okay  but even if
we get to the crash site   
how are we supposed to change
what is literally
written in stone 
ah  my cynical friend 
the dinos were wiped off
the face of the earth 
but some escaped 
they changed their fate
and we can change ours  too 
who s with me 
 crickets chirping 
so  what do you think 
honestly  i m worried
the weasel s right 
 in high pitched voice  no 
don t listen to the weasel 
he s a raving loon 
 laughs  sorry  i just love
playing devil s advocate 
and looking fabulous 
well  buck has saved
our lives before  right 
but what if
he can t this time 
i don t know
what to believe 
but i m afraid
our lives will be over
before they begin 
 chiseling 
okay 
i guess we re in 
crash and eddie
reporting for duty 
 laughs  doody 
 both laughing 
excellent 
and dirty word processed 
now  we better
get on the road
because time till
impact is roughly   
2 days  4 hours 
1 minute and 16 seconds 
15 seconds  14 seconds   
i think we get it 
i think we re
all gonna get it 
whoo  we look so cool 
whoa 
 chuckling 
 coughing 
ugh  what is this stuff 
 screaming 
 exhales 
 groans 
 roaring 
where is he  when i am through
with that one eyed weasel   
he s going to need
two eye patches 
i admire your
bloodthirstitude  gertie 
but you heard them 
an asteroid is coming 
 laughs 
this changes things 
 yelps 
holy snowballs 
it s freezing up here 
parts are retracting
into other parts   screams 
would you please stop
acting like a parakeet 
it s a good thing you got
your mother s eyes   
or you d be
totally useless 
well  that s just
hurtful   screams 
 neck cracks 
 screams 
what do you see 
 sighs  nothing  nothing 
 screaming 
deadly asteroid
screaming towards earth 
wait  there he is 
that s too bad 
he is really far away 
probably too far
to reach by flight 
oh  well 
let s just go home 
we are not retreating 
until that weasel
came along   
our family made
an honest living
stealing dino eggs 
an honest living  stealing 
kind of ironic 
don t you think 
besides 
why take out the weasel
if the asteroid is
just gonna take us out 
so much sight 
so little vision 
if we stop the weasel
and his friends
from diverting
the asteroid   
kablooie 
it kills the weasel
and everyone else   
while we glide
safely above it all 
it ll be our paradise 
 laughing evilly 
that s seems
highly implausible 
just from
a scientific standpoint 
 both growl 
fine  it s a great plan 
dynamite 
one of the top
three or four
species annihilation plans
i ve ever heard 
that s better 
now let s make sure
that asteroid hits 
why can t we just
fear the apocalypse
like a normal family

and we will get married 
but maybe it s the universe
telling us we won t 
sid  whoa  whoa  whoa 
you re going to let
one tiny little   
300 mile wide asteroid
ruin your plans 
how can we think
about our future
when we may not have one 
hey  we re going to
stop this thing
and you ll get married 
bada bing  bada boom 
well  not boom 
forget i said boom 
 gasps 
i know

you don t just wing the
happiest day of your life

you strangle it
with good intentions 
ooh  let s start

updo with a top bun 
traditional 
or updo with a fishtail braid 
flirtatious 
 giggling 
but maybe a little trashy 
ugh 
and garter belts 
today  ed is modelling
laced daisies 
while crash is rocking
a more elegant ivy   
that s all about the calves 
ooh  we need
a seating chart 
the singles table 
the kids table 
the weird relatives table   
the smelly table 
two more smelly tables 
 scoffs  look at him 
julian  oh

gimme a hug  bro dad 
 clears throat  look at
that pretty bird there 
 squawks 
yeah  that is a pretty bird 
good eye  manny 
 chuckles  yeah 
the sky is
literally falling   
and she thinks
we re just gonna
let her stroll
into the wilderness   
with mr  no plans
bouncy walk 
stop picking on him 
come on  el  you re not
still mad at me  are you 
no  i m not still mad 
because that s not
how i want to spend
what could be our
final days together 
but if we somehow survive
that planet killing
hunk of space rock   
you re in for it 
if we survive 
we lose our daughter 
well  i ve been thinking
about that  too 
what if   
ooh  i know  we destroy
the relationship  right 
that way we never
have to let her go   
and she ll just stay
our little girl forever 
 laughing 
no  you psychopath 
what if we convince them
to stay near us 
oh  that s better 
i like it  but how 
the way we always
get her to do what we want 
we make her think
it s her idea 
you sneaky  sneaky minx 
 giggles 
let s just hope
we haven t lost our touch 
found it 
behold  mammals 
a sneak preview
of the asteroid to come 
a space rock 
fresh from the cosmos 
mmm  mmm  mmm 
i taste iron  carbon 
 gargles 
oh  and a hint of nickel 
 sighs 
space tastes lonely 
hey  look 
i found another one 
me  too 
 both screaming 
hmm   
hey  yours is
attracted to me 
no  yours is
attracted to me 
 grunting and screaming 
 eddie sobs 
we re just too attractive 
stupendous 
now we have something
to play with
during our final hours 
you re missing
the point  tiger 
they re magnets 
and if these space rocks
are magnetic   
so is that 
this can only
mean one thing 
and that would be   
allow me 
 both scream 
whoa 
where are we 
 echoing  you are
in my brain 
hmm  kind of chilly 
 clears throat  gentlemen 
here s what we know 
space rocks  magnetic 
asteroid  also  magnetic 
 gasps  famed astrophysicist
neil debuck weasel 
he knows the cosmos 
ipso facto 
thusly and ergo   
the crash site must have
a heap of these things
attracting the asteroid 
ooh  pythagoras buck 
he s got the right angle 
what if we use
the magnets
to attract the asteroids
somewhere else 
as in  not towards earth 
theoretically speaking 
if we can launch enough
of these into space   
they will pull
the asteroid off course 
thus  saving the world 
 all cheering 
so  we just need to
go to the crash site   
and launch a bunch of
rocks into space 
 chuckles 
that s easy  right 
oh  yeah  sounds like
a real piece of cake 
this is progress 
now we know exactly what
we don t know how to do 
vamanos  mammals 
this trail will take us
directly to the crash site 
all right  kids 
 laughs 
let s have some fun 
 laughs 
oh 
 whimpers 
okay  everyone 
follow the trail 
never leave the trail 
 distant screeching 
hmm 
 gasps 
okay  everyone 
leave the trail 
into the forest 
chop  chop 
but you just said

don t you 
well played  weasel 
stay sharp  kids

for getting around the river 
let s see if the tablet s
ancient wisdom will guide us 
hmm

we could definitely
divert the asteroid
with a magnet that size 
i mean that thing
is enormous 
it s massive  it s   
   going to be impossible
to get off the ground 
it s entirely possible 
in a way that we don t
