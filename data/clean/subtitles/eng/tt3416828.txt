grunting

groaning
right on the spleen
utterly useless
but totally hurts
laughs hey buck
welcome back buddy
wait this halfasnack
is the dinosaur whisperer
and expert salsa dancer
singing
salsa music playing
music stops
whoo
i have one eye
but all my original teeth
would you like to
count them ah
no thank you
and this must be nectarine
um peaches
semantics my dear
i am deeply honored
sweet eye patch
very gangsta
thank you
i like this kid
manny buck
whoa
what are you doing here
well i what
im trying
but how do you tell
someone theyre doomed
hes stumped laughs
were not doomed buck
it was just a meteor shower
and the shows over
ahh
oh quite the contrary
old chap
its just beginning
you see i found a prophecy
dramatic drumming
do you mind
boy he really sucks the fun
out of everything doesnt he
fun sucker
i read this tablet
front to back
and the story it tells
is very disturbing
every hundred million
years or so
the world gets
a cosmic cleansing
before the dinosaurs
there were these horseshoe
crablooking thingies
ugh yuck
then at the bottom
of this mountain range
an asteroid hit
boom byebye
next dinosaurs
mountain range asteroid
boom byebye
and coming up next mammals
mountain range
asteroid boom
byebye
giggles stupid mammals
thats us
gasps
mmm
yep and there she is
the mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us
even going underground
wont save us this time
hey that wasnt
there before
and look what
its doing to the sky
no worries
because ive got a plan
really to stop
an asteroid
look the last two asteroids
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot
and its about to
happen again
weve got to go there
and see whats attracting
the asteroid
once we know
why its coming
we can figure out how to
send it somewhere else
that plan is so dumb
i wish it had a face
so i could smack it
let me get this straight
instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid
you want us to run
directly towards it
i know it sounds suboptimal
but the good news is
itll kill us
no matter where we went
well thats reassuring
okay but even if
we get to the crash site
how are we supposed to change
what is literally
written in stone
ah my cynical friend
the dinos were wiped off
the face of the earth
but some escaped
they changed their fate
and we can change ours too
whos with me
crickets chirping
so what do you think
honestly im worried
the weasels right
in highpitched voice no
dont listen to the weasel
hes a raving loon
laughs sorry i just love
playing devils advocate
and looking fabulous
well buck has saved
our lives before right
but what if
he cant this time
i dont know
what to believe
but im afraid
our lives will be over
before they begin
chiseling
okay
i guess were in
crash and eddie
reporting for duty
laughs doody
both laughing
excellent
and dirty word processed
now we better
get on the road
because time till
impact is roughly
2 days 4 hours
1 minute and 16 seconds
15 seconds 14 seconds
i think we get it
i think were
all gonna get it
whoo we look so cool
whoa
chuckling
coughing
ugh what is this stuff
screaming
exhales
groans
roaring
where is he when i am through
with that oneeyed weasel
hes going to need
two eye patches
i admire your
bloodthirstitude gertie
but you heard them
an asteroid is coming
laughs
this changes things
yelps
holy snowballs
its freezing up here
parts are retracting
into other parts screams
would you please stop
acting like a parakeet
its a good thing you got
your mothers eyes
or youd be
totally useless
well thats just
hurtful screams
neck cracks
screams
what do you see
sighs nothing nothing
screaming
deadly asteroid
screaming towards earth
wait there he is
thats too bad
he is really far away
probably too far
to reach by flight
oh well
lets just go home
we are not retreating
until that weasel
came along
our family made
an honest living
stealing dino eggs
an honest living stealing
kind of ironic
dont you think
besides
why take out the weasel
if the asteroid is
just gonna take us out
so much sight
so little vision
if we stop the weasel
and his friends
from diverting
the asteroid
kablooie
it kills the weasel
and everyone else
while we glide
safely above it all
itll be our paradise
laughing evilly
thats seems
highly implausible
just from
a scientific standpoint
both growl
fine its a great plan
dynamite
one of the top
three or four
species annihilation plans
ive ever heard
thats better
now lets make sure
that asteroid hits
why cant we just
fear the apocalypse
like a normal family
gasps

badabing badaboom

let her stroll
into the wilderness
with mr no plans
bouncy walk
stop picking on him
come on el youre not
still mad at me are you
no im not still mad
because thats not
how i want to spend
what could be our
final days together
but if we somehow survive
that planetkilling
hunk of space rock
youre in for it
if we survive
we lose our daughter
well ive been thinking
about that too
what if
ooh i know we destroy
the relationship right
that way we never
have to let her go
and shell just stay
our little girl forever
laughing
no you psychopath
what if we convince them
to stay near us
oh thats better
i like it but how
the way we always
get her to do what we want
we make her think
its her idea
you sneaky sneaky minx
giggles
lets just hope
we havent lost our touch
found it
behold mammals
a sneak preview
of the asteroid to come
a space rock
fresh from the cosmos
mmm mmm mmm
i taste iron carbon
gargles
oh and a hint of nickel
sighs
space tastes lonely
hey look
i found another one
me too
both screaming
hmm
hey yours is
attracted to me
no yours is
attracted to me
grunting and screaming
eddie sobs
were just too attractive
stupendous
now we have something
to play with
during our final hours
youre missing
the point tiger
theyre magnets
and if these space rocks
are magnetic
so is that
this can only
mean one thing
and that would be
allow me
both scream
whoa
where are we
echoing you are
in my brain
hmm kind of chilly
clears throat gentlemen
heres what we know
space rocks magnetic
asteroid also magnetic
gasps famed astrophysicist
neil debuck weasel
he knows the cosmos
ipso facto
thusly and ergo
the crash site must have
a heap of these things
attracting the asteroid
ooh pythagoras buck
hes got the right angle
what if we use
the magnets
to attract the asteroids
somewhere else
as in not towards earth
theoretically speaking
if we can launch enough
of these into space
they will pull
the asteroid off course
thus saving the world
all cheering
so we just need to
go to the crash site
and launch a bunch of
rocks into space
chuckles
thats easy right
oh yeah sounds like
a real piece of cake
this is progress
now we know exactly what
we dont know how to do
vamanos mammals
this trail will take us
directly to the crash site
all right kids
laughs
lets have some fun
laughs
oh
whimpers
okay everyone
