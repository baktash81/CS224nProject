you can really examine
the culture of the moment
by looking at
the tropes of the time
like um the masked killer
the final girl
the different rules
dont split up dont have sex
both chuckling
dont answer the phone
exactly exactly exactly
its all cliché

comes an opportunity
for outsider art
a voice for the voiceless

this was found next to the body
at the apartment crime scene
dna says that it belonged
to someone named richie kirsch
does that ring a bell
were familiar with him
but the one that attacked us
had a different mask on
it was kind of more beat up
like it was older
uh
i got to ask
do you have alibis
for earlier tonight
i was at a party
with my friends
i was at my therapists
i can give you his information
you can call to check
and then i met tara
at that party
where i tased someone
unrelated
was that before
or after this happened
student murderer
sam what the fuck
is wrong with you bitch
you got a problem with me before
the point is
we were with people all night
so our roommates dad
just happened to pull our case
thatd be a crazy coincidence right
yeah
the detective who had the case
he offered it to me
because it involves quinn
um but i can totally give it
back if youre uncomfortable
its up to you
its fine
so if the man who attacked you
did steal your license
and plant it next to the body
itd probably be somebody
close to you
how long have you known
your friends
well we moved here
with mindy and chad
for summer semester
like six months ago
so quinn um ethan anika
all since then
i think i can vouch for quinn
so thats one less
do either of you have anyone
that might want to target you
not anyone whos still alive

chuckles
your two vics
were residents of my city

i have been investigating
their online activity
for the past few months
wow
why
i take a special interest
in ghostface attacks
kirby
hey sam
what
kirby tara
youre the fbi mmhmm
you guys know each other
yeah
we went
to woodsboro high together
she was a senior
when i was a freshman
we share a certain history yeah
im not trying to get into
a jurisdictional
pissing contest here
i just want to help
ill show you mine et cetera
thank you
he left this mask at the bodega
dna traces of two individuals
charlie walker jill roberts
both deceased
the ghostface killers of 2011
charlie walker gave me this
like i said
i take a special interest
is this the mask he was wearing
when he attacked you
no
so hes leaving them on purpose
which means whoevers doing this
is a student of the killers
who came before
maybe he believes
sam is the latest
in a long line
yeah good luck with that
were getting out of town
im sorry thats not possible
youre both persons of interest
in a double homicide
so youre not allowed
to leave town sorry
are you serious
hes right
but if we work together were going
reporters chattering
samantha do you have an alibi
for last nights murders
tara do you feel safe
around your sister
tara tara
gale weathers channel 4
do you ladies
think youre the reason
the ghostface killer
has come to the big apple
scoffs
crowd gasps
scoffs nice try sweetie
but ive done this dance before
gruntscrowd gasps
stay away from usreporters clamoring
are you still mad at me
you said you wouldnt write
a book about what happened
and then you wrote a book
about what happened
oh come on
somebody was gonna write
about it
its what i do
i heard you couldnt sell
the movie rights
its all about truecrime
limited series these days
after everything
we went through together
what would dewey think
thats a low blow
so was your book
you called me unstable
and a born killer
thats taken out of context
thats literally a quote
you dont think
what you wrote
with whats happening to us
sam come on
hey i talked to sidney
shes not coming here
is she
she sends her love
but shes taking mark
and the kids someplace safe
she deserves
to have her happy ending
on that much we agree
hey i want to catch this fucker
as much as you do
maybe
or maybe youre just afraid
that without ghostface
in your life
youre gonna fade away
taxi departing
you fools youre in danger
cant you see
theyre after you
theyre after all of us
our wives
our children everyoneknocks on door
theyre here already
youre next

youre next youre next
youre next

dr stone who is it
youre a day early
for trickortreating you know
dog barking in distance
red right hand playing
students chattering
take a little walk
to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
mindy okay nerds listen up
as terrifying as this all is
im actually glad
i get a chance to redeem myself
for not calling the killers
last time
yep
its fine okay
the way i see it someone is out
to make a sequel to the requel
um whats a requel
youre beautiful sweetie
lets hold questions to the end
stab 1 took place in woodsboro
stab 2 took place in college
so we think that
the killer is trying
that is one possibility
heroes now in college
check
suspicious new characters
brought in
andor body count
check check and check
but it cant just be
about stab 2
why not
it would make sense
if this were just a sequel
but were not in a sequel
because nobody
just makes sequels anymore
were in a franchise
and there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise
i had a feeling
rule one
everything is bigger
than last time
bigger budget bigger cast
bigger body count
longer chases shootouts beheadings
you got to top what came before
to keep people coming back
beheadings
beheadings
rule two
whatever happened last time
franchises only survive
by subverting expectations
if the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds
with letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities
you can bet
the opposite will be true here
and rule three
no one is safe
legacy characters
cannon fodder at this point
usually brought back
only to be killed off
in some cheap bid for nostalgia
its not looking too good
for gale and kirby
oh and thats
not even the worst part
this is the part where she
tells us the worst part
the worst part is
franchises are just
continuing episodic installments
which means main characters
are completely expendable now too
laurie strode nancy thompson
ellen ripley
sally hardesty jigsaw
tony stark james bond
i mean even luke skywalker
all died so their franchises
could live on
that means its not
just the friend group
any of us could go at any time
especially sam and tara
ethan wait any of usmindy yeah
stammers
am i in the friend groupmindy yeah
am i like
one of the targetsmindy mmhmm
am i gonna die a virgin
that was a weird overshare
but it brings us
to our current suspects
ethan
the shy dorky guy
who no one suspects
because hes so shy and dorky
why am i on the suspect list
because im randomly
chads roommate
roommate lotteries can be juked
you could have fixed it
to get next to us
quinn
the slutty roommate
a horror movie
smacks lips classic
sex positive
but thank you
mmhmm um how did you come
to live with sam and tara
i answered their ad online
okay say no more
youve already implicated
yourself enough
it was an anonymous ad mindy
and you know we vetted her
plus her dad is a cop
and that makes it more likely
that shes the killer
because having a cop dad
is a great cover
do you not remember
how these movies work tara
is she always like this
and finally anika
kisseskisses
never trust the love interest
okay so we have our rules
and we have our suspects
but wait
what about you guys
i mean i think its pretty safe
to rule out the four of us
who went through this last year
in woodsboro
agreed
um not agreed
what if the trauma
you all went through
caused one
or more of you to snap
yeah or the fame you got
from the killings
i mean lets be honest here
some of the theories online
about sam are
dont you fucking dare
okay shes right though
i mean face facts
if were all suspects
youre all suspects
people chattering
remember samantha carpenters
alibi the therapist
bailey he was stabbed
to death through the nose
through the nose
how messed up is that
its pretty messed up
he turned her in
for making threatening remarks
ended up dead
and guess which patients
notes were stolen
so sam kills her own alibi and
steals her own session notes
maybe
another mask
was found at the scene
its a dna match
for roman bridger
the ghostface
who was directing stab 3
its like hes leaving us
reallife franchise easter eggs
like dropping
the killers masks in reverse
almost like hes counting down
to something
what happens
when he gets to one
so weve had nine
ghostface killers so far
nine i thought in the movies
forget about the movies
the movies dont matter
look last year was
amber freeman and richie kirsch
whose masks we found
at the first crime scene
along with the bodies
of two film students
who killed their professor
earlier that same night
then it was jill roberts
and charlie walker
theirs at the bodega
roman bridger was the only
single ghostface
kudos to him for ambition
his mask
was found at the shrinks
which leaves mickey altieri
nancy loomis stu macher
and billy loomis number one
and the father
of our chief suspect
well whoevers doing this
is leading us back to sam
cell phone ringing
i will check in later
and tell your daughter
to stay sharp
proximity to the carpenters
is proximity to ghostface
door opens
hey jack would you call
the atlanta field office
dig up what you can
on agent reed
soft pop music
playing on speakers
i think you should
get out of the city
you know considering
what happened to you
i i wouldnt blame you
if you wanted to go
thats very thoughtful of you
but um
i dont think
im going anywhere
mindy gagging

thisll be so fun
a little slumber party
with the core four
core four
yeah
did you give us a nickname
i sure did
weve been through
a lot together
and its a pretty cool nickname
thats debatable
its extremely debatable
you cant just give yourself
a nickname dingus
of course i can dingus
because i just did
core four up top
no
down low
get that away from me
please
for the love of god
i would like a little more
respect and support
from my fellow members
of the core four
guys what the hell
were hearing from sources
inside the homicide division
that the prime suspect is none
other than samantha carpenter
one of the survivors of
the woodsboro killings in 2022
seen here attacking a woman
on the street last night
bleep is wrong with you
you got a problem with me
knock it off
student stay away from her
she knows what she did
reporter in the wake
of the woodsboro tragedy
rumors sprouted online
that carpenter was actually
responsible for the killings
blaming the crimes
on her boyfriend richie kirsch
and teen amber freetv turns off

because she wouldnt talk to me
so now neither of us

im sorry to say this
but fuck her
my parents sucked too
but you can still
make your own family
even if its just
with one person
and if you lose that one person
you just you keep going
and maybe
you find another loner
and you look after each other
howd you get past
what happened to you
inhales

i almost died
after i was stabbed
technically i did die

im your backup
so were really doing
the phone tracing thing
that never works in the movies
itll be all keep him talking
sam two more minutes
ive almost got him
and then he hangs up just
before we can get a lock
i can trace a call
in under 15 seconds
well youve got them
out there as bait
because the killer usually calls
from somewhere nearby
and you think theyre safe
because its broad daylight
in a public place
look i am here okay
and so is bailey
this is exactly
how our uncle randy died
broad daylight
public place
yanked into a van
stab stab stab no more randy

i agree
whispering call the police
ghostface i figured
after all these years
youd want an interviewcell
phone vibrating
well you figured right
so whats your motive
this time
you angry at the movies or you
just trying to stay relevant
ghostface
i could ask you the same
dont you know
the legacy characters
nobody cares
about last centurys heroes
then why bother with me at allghostface
call it nostalgia
or maybe
you deserve to be punished
for all that money you made
off the misery of others
maybe its time
someone made a buck
you know youre like the tenth
guy to try this right
and spoiler alert
it never works out
for the dipshit in the mask
oh but they certainly
leave a mark
richie and amber

how does it feel
to lose the only man
fuck you
how does it feel to know
that you werent
there for him at the end
chuckles
not there to give him comfort
as he died screaming
in his own guts
youre the one
whos gonna die screaming

be around to see it

stay the fuck back
we know its you kirby
stammers
one of them knocked me out
bailey kirby stop
get away from the girls
what are you doing
did you kill quinn
did you kill my daughter
jesus christ
whatever hes been saying
to you dont listen to him
hes probably the killer
behind you
gasps
great job
both of you
you
yeah of course me
frankly i expected more
from the two of you
after what you did to us
what do you mean us
bailey chuckling tada
mindy was right
chuckles
it was easy to juke
the roommate lottery
all i had to do to meet you
was room with a conceited
condescending alpha
literally named chad
fuck it felt good to kill him
this was your grandmothers
sam
nancy loomis
really runs in
your fucking family doesnt it
speaking of family wait for it
my names not ethan landry
is it dad
dadchuckles
wait if its you two
that just leaves
mindy
hey roomies
you didnt see
that one coming did you
yeah because you died
kind of didnt though
it was a good way
to get off the suspect list
stab gale weathers
stab mindy on the train
that sort of thing
yep and i just made sure
i was first on the scene
so i could switch her body out
with a fresh one
little fake blood a prosthetic
youd be amazed at what
a grieving father
i got stu machers mask
he was my favorite
nice thats number three
thats two
which leaves
your fathers
this is what weve
been counting down to sam
im gonna need you to put it on
fuck you
bailey laughs
ooh
stay the fuck away from her
bailey come on
what what is this
you did this as a family
hell yeah bitch
you should know
better than anyone
theyre still not getting it
i dont know what you believe
but i didnt commit
those murders in woodsboro
we know that
of course you didnt
you think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory
come on who do you think
started the rumors about you
giggles
do you know how easy it was
to turn sam
from the hero of woodsboro
how easy it is
to convince the world
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best
because its not enough
to just kill someone these days
you have to assassinate
their character first
so when dad here discovers
your horribly mutilated bodies
gasps
posed with sam
wearing her fathers mask
hell say some poor dumb bastard
read on the internet
and took matters
into their own deluded hands
exactly thats why
its the perfect alibi
and all the best lies
are based on the truth
and youre a killer
