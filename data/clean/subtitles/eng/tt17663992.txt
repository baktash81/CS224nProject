what s your favorite
um  not that one 
 both laughing 
so why slashers 
well  i just  you know 
i think it s interesting 
you can really examine
the culture of the moment
by looking at
the tropes of the time 
like  um  the masked killer 
the final girl 
the different rules 
don t split up  don t have sex 
 both chuckling 
don t answer the phone 
exactly  exactly  exactly 
it s all cliché 
but out of those clichés
comes an opportunity
for outsider art 
a voice for the voiceless 
you might say 
mmm  whispers 
jesus christ

a rom com guy 
 chuckles  okay  i think i m on hudson

 door opens 
this was found next to the body
at the apartment crime scene 
dna says that it belonged
to someone named richie kirsch 
does that ring a bell 
we re familiar with him 
but the one that attacked us
had a different mask on 
it was kind of more beat up 
like it was older 
uh   
i got to ask   
do you have alibis
for earlier tonight 
i was at a party
with my friends 
i was at my therapist s 
i can give you his information 
you can call to check
and then i met tara
at that party 
where i tased someone 
unrelated 
was that before
or after this happened 
 student  murderer 
 sam  what the fuck
is wrong with you  bitch 
you got a problem with me  before 
the point is 
we were with people all night 
so  our roommate s dad
just happened to pull our case 
that d be a crazy coincidence  right 
  yeah 
  the detective who had the case 
he offered it to me
because it involves quinn 
um  but i can totally give it
back if you re uncomfortable 
it s up to you 
it s fine 
so if the man who attacked you
did steal your license
and plant it next to the body 
it d probably be somebody
close to you 
how long have you known
your friends 
well  we moved here
with mindy and chad
for summer semester 
like  six months ago 
so  quinn  um  ethan  anika   
all since then 
i think i can vouch for quinn 
so that s one less
do either of you have anyone
that might want to target you 
not anyone who s still alive

oh  you lost 
 chuckles 
your two vics
were residents of my city
before they moved here
for college 
i have been investigating
their online activity
for the past few months 
wow 
why 
i take a special interest
in ghostface attacks 
  kirby 
  hey  sam 
what 
 kirby  tara 
you re the fbi  mm hmm 
  you guys know each other 
  yeah 
we went
to woodsboro high together 
she was a senior
when i was a freshman 
we share a certain history  yeah 
i m not trying to get into
a jurisdictional
pissing contest here 
i just want to help 
i ll show you mine  et cetera 
thank you 
he left this mask at the bodega 
dna traces of two individuals 
charlie walker  jill roberts 
both deceased 
the ghostface killers of 2011 
charlie walker gave me this 
like i said 
i take a special interest 
is this the mask he was wearing
when he attacked you 
no 
so he s leaving them on purpose 
which means whoever s doing this
is a student of the killers
who came before 
maybe he believes
sam is the latest
in a long line 
yeah  good luck with that 
we re getting out of town 
i m sorry  that s not possible 
you re both persons of interest
in a double homicide 
so you re not allowed
to leave town  sorry 
  are you serious 
  he s right 
but if we work together    we re going 
 reporters chattering 
samantha  do you have an alibi
for last night s murders 
tara  do you feel safe
around your sister 
tara  tara 
gale weathers  channel 4 
do you ladies
think you re the reason
the ghostface killer
has come to the big apple 
 scoffs 
 crowd gasps 
 scoffs  nice try  sweetie 
but i ve done this dance before 
 grunts  crowd gasps 
stay away from us  reporters clamoring 
are you still mad at me 
you said you wouldn t write
a book about what happened 
and then you wrote a book
about what happened 
oh  come on 
somebody was gonna write
about it 
it s what i do 
i heard you couldn t sell
the movie rights 
it s all about true crime
limited series these days 
after everything
we went through together 
what would dewey think 
  that s a low blow 
  so was your book 
you called me  unstable 
and a  born killer  
  that s taken out of context 
  that s literally a quote 
you don t think
what you wrote
with what s happening to us 
 sam  come on 
hey  i talked to sidney 
she s not coming here 
  is she 
she sends her love 
but she s taking mark
and the kids someplace safe 
she deserves
to have her happy ending 
on that much  we agree 
hey  i want to catch this fucker
as much as you do 
maybe 
or maybe you re just afraid
that without ghostface
in your life 
you re gonna fade away 
 taxi departing 
you fools  you re in danger 
can t you see 
they re after you 
they re after all of us 
our wives 
our children  everyone  knocks on door 
they re here already 
you re next 
 continues on tv 
you re next  you re next 
you re next 
 knocks on door 
 dr  stone  who is it 
you re a day early
for trick or treating  you know 
 dog barking in distance 
  red right hand  playing 
 students chattering 
  take a little walk
to the edge of town  
  and go across the tracks     
 mindy  okay  nerds  listen up 
as terrifying as this all is 
i m actually glad
i get a chance to redeem myself
for not calling the killers
last time 
  yep 
  it s fine  okay 
the way i see it  someone is out
to make a sequel to the requel 
um  what s a requel 
you re beautiful  sweetie 
let s hold questions to the end 
stab 1 took place in woodsboro 
stab 2 took place in college 
so we think that
the killer is trying
that is one possibility 
heroes now in college 
check 
suspicious new characters
brought in
and or body count 
check  check and check 
but it can t just be
about stab 2 
  why not 
  it would make sense
if this were just a sequel 
but we re not in a sequel 
because nobody
just makes sequels anymore 
we re in a franchise 
and there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise 
  i had a feeling 
  rule one 
everything is bigger
than last time 
bigger budget  bigger cast 
bigger body count 
longer chases  shoot outs  beheadings 
you got to top what came before
to keep people coming back 
  beheadings 
  beheadings 
rule two 
whatever happened last time 
franchises only survive
by subverting expectations 
if the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds
with letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities 
you can bet
the opposite will be true here 
and rule three 
no one is safe 
legacy characters 
cannon fodder at this point 
usually brought back
only to be killed off
in some cheap bid for nostalgia 
it s not looking too good
for gale and kirby 
oh  and that s
not even the worst part 
this is the part where she
tells us the worst part 
the worst part is
franchises are just
continuing episodic installments
which means main characters
are completely expendable now  too 
laurie strode  nancy thompson 
ellen ripley 
sally hardesty  jigsaw 
tony stark  james bond   
i mean  even luke skywalker   
all died so their franchises
could live on 
that means it s not
just the friend group 
any of us could go at any time 
especially sam and tara 
 ethan  wait  any of us  mindy  yeah 
 stammers 
am i in the friend group  mindy  yeah 
am i  like 
one of the targets  mindy  mm hmm 
am i gonna die a virgin 
that was a weird overshare 
but it brings us
to our current suspects 
ethan 
the shy  dorky guy
who no one suspects
because he s so shy and dorky 
why am i on the suspect list 
because i m randomly
chad s roommate 
roommate lotteries can be juked 
you could have fixed it
to get next to us 
quinn 
the slutty roommate 
a horror movie   
 smacks lips     classic 
 sex positive  
but    thank you 
mm hmm  um  how did you come
to live with sam and tara 
i answered their ad online 
okay  say no more 
you ve already implicated
yourself enough 
it was an anonymous ad  mindy 
and you know we vetted her 
plus her dad is a cop 
and that makes it more likely
that she s the killer 
because having a cop dad
is a great cover 
do you not remember
how these movies work  tara 
is she always like this 
and finally    anika 
 kisses  kisses 
never trust the love interest 
okay  so  we have our rules
and we have our suspects 
but wait 
what about you guys 
i mean  i think it s pretty safe
to rule out the four of us
who went through this last year
in woodsboro 
  agreed 
  um  not agreed 
what if the trauma
you all went through
caused one
or more of you to snap 
yeah  or the fame you got
from the killings
i mean  let s be honest here 
some of the theories online
about sam are   
don t you fucking dare 
okay  she s right  though 
i mean  face facts   
if we re all suspects 
you re all suspects 
 people chattering 
remember samantha carpenter s
  alibi  the therapist 
 bailey  he was stabbed
  to death  through the nose 
through the nose 
how messed up is that 
it s pretty messed up 
he turned her in
for making threatening remarks 
ended up dead 
and guess which patient s
notes were stolen 
so sam kills her own alibi and
steals her own session notes 
maybe 
another mask
was found at the scene 
it s a dna match
for roman bridger 
the ghostface
who was directing stab 3 
it s like he s leaving us
real life franchise easter eggs 
like dropping
the killers  masks in reverse 
almost like he s counting down
to something 
what happens
when he gets to one 
so we ve had nine
ghostface killers so far 
nine  i thought in the movies   
forget about the movies 
the movies don t matter 
look  last year was
amber freeman and richie kirsch 
whose masks we found
at the first crime scene
along with the bodies
of two film students
who killed their professor
earlier that same night 
then it was jill roberts
and charlie walker   
theirs at the bodega 
roman bridger was the only
single ghostface 
kudos to him for ambition 
his mask
was found at the shrink s 
which leaves mickey altieri 
nancy loomis  stu macher   
and billy loomis  number one 
and the father
of our chief suspect 
well  whoever s doing this
is leading us back to sam 
 cell phone ringing 
i will check in later 
and tell your daughter
to stay sharp 
proximity to the carpenters
is proximity to ghostface 
 door opens 
hey  jack  would you call
the atlanta field office 
dig up what you can
on agent reed 
 soft pop music
playing on speakers 
i think you should
get out of the city 
you know  considering
what happened to you
i    i wouldn t blame you
if    you wanted to go 
that s very thoughtful of you 
but  um 
i don t think
i m going anywhere 
 mindy gagging 
will you two
just make out already 
that is so inappropriate 
  dude 
get it over with 
 sam  here you go 
 mindy  sam  sam  yep 
we do not have to stay here 
well  too bad  i insist 
safety in numbers 
this ll be so fun 
a little slumber party
with the core four 
   core four  
  yeah 
  did you give us a nickname 
  i sure did 
we ve been through
a lot together 
and it s a pretty cool nickname 
  that s debatable 
  it s extremely debatable 
you can t just give yourself
a nickname  dingus 
of course i can  dingus 
because i just did 
  core four  up top 
  no 
  down low 
  get that away from me 
please 
  for the love of god 
i would like a little more
respect and support
from my fellow members
of the core four 
guys  what the hell 
we re hearing from sources
inside the homicide division
that the prime suspect is none
other than samantha carpenter 
one of the survivors of
the woodsboro killings in 2022 
seen here attacking a woman
on the street last night 
 bleep  is wrong with you 
you got a problem with me 
knock it off 
 student  stay away from her 
she knows what she did 
 reporter  in the wake
of the woodsboro tragedy
rumors sprouted online
that carpenter was actually
responsible for the killings 
blaming the crimes
on her boyfriend  richie kirsch
and teen amber free    tv turns off 
i know you re not a fan
of the way
and that i ve been giving you
a really hard time 
but i can say
that none of us can relate
to what you are experiencing 
and i m really  really sorry
that you have to do that alone 
 sniffles 
it s not your fault 
 sniffles 
and i know i shouldn t care
what people think

 kirby 
how did you find it 
it s called
 investigative journalism 
how didn t you find it 
weren t you tracking them 
 kirby  i went through
their financial records
this was not in any of them 
doesn t make sense 
don t worry 
i m just really good at my job 
you ll get there 
 sighs 
 lock beeps 
 lock beeps 
 sam  what is this place 
what s with all the security 
 electricity buzzes 
it s a movie theater 
 gale 
it s not just a theater 
it s a shrine 
 machinery powering up 
creaking 
whoa 
they ve got
the whole goddamn franchise 
  chad 
  mmm 
this was uncle randy s 
they ve got everything 
is that    the knife i was stabbed with 
you all have been through
so much 
who drew all these 
 gale  dewey 
hey  how d they get
all this stuff 
isn t this evidence 
 gale  well  cops like money 
and evidence can get lost
pretty easily 
present company excluded 
of course 
um  why am i here exactly 
my alibi checks out 
so i can keep an eye on you  roomie 
 gale  the killer must have
found this place
before he murdered jason
and greg 
and then he took the masks
off the mannequins 
all nine  from stu and billy
to amber and richie 
 billy  hot damn 
how fucking cool is this place 
fuck  no 
 billy  fuck  yes 
come on  sam

billy and sam 
team loomis 
get ready to slice up
more motherfuckers 
 tara  what are you doing 
i don t know 
 chad  so 
somebody killed
these chucklefucks
and took over 
someone who believes that sam
masterminded woodsboro 
 mindy  if this were
a normal stab movie 
this would be the killer s lair 
which means this isn t
a normal stab movie 
 quivers 
 kirby 
the tv that killed stu macher 
 mindy 
if you believe he s dead 
i hear you re a horror fan 
  it s been said 
  mmm 
mmm 
best nightmare on elm street 
 both  the original 
best friday the 13th 
part ii the final chapter 
had a crush on corey feldman 
okay  respect 
 chuckles 
psycho ii is   
 both     underrated 
candyman 
the original or requel 
 both  both 
okay  okay 
game recognize game 
hmm 
 inhales 
you okay 
sam  when do i get
to be a normal person again 
i don t know 
i don t want
to be a part of this 
i don t want to be a part
of some stupid legacy
because i m    because of me 
i m sorry  thunder rumbling 
just drop it  sam 
tara 
 kirby  i got her 
that seemed intense 
ever since i came back
into her life  i ve just   
made a mess of it 
hey 
where s your mother in all this 
she cut me off
when i told tara
then tara cut her off
because she wouldn t talk to me 
so now neither of us
have a mother 
i m sorry to say this 
but fuck her 
my parents sucked  too 
but you can still
make your own family 
even if it s just
with one person 
and if you lose that one person 
you just    you keep going 
and maybe
you find another loner 
and you look after each other 
how d you get past
what happened to you 
 inhales 
 clicks tongue 
i almost died
after i was stabbed 
technically  i did die 
for four minutes 
when i recovered   
i got mad 
i didn t want
to spend the rest of my life
i wanted the monsters
to be afraid of me 
i like that 
 door opens  bailey  sorry to interrupt 
think i might have an idea
about how to turn the tables
on this creep 
yeah  we re in 
sorry  gale 
no press allowed 
police business 
i m good at my job  too 
 people chattering 
you should have stayed
with the others 
that s not gonna happen 
there s no point in both of us
putting ourselves at risk 
i m not 
i m your backup 
so we re really doing
the phone tracing thing
that never works in the movies 
it ll be all   keep him talking 
sam  two more minutes 
i ve almost got him  
and then he hangs up just
before we can get a lock 
i can trace a call
in under 15 seconds 
well  you ve got them
out there as bait 
because the killer usually calls
from somewhere nearby 
and you think they re safe
because it s broad daylight
in a public place 
look  i am here  okay 
and so is bailey 
this is exactly
how our uncle randy died 
broad daylight 
public place 
yanked into a van 
stab  stab  stab  no more randy 
huh 
hey  sam 
stay frosty out there  okay 
we re good 
 people chattering 
 cell phone ringing 
 phone continues ringing 
you re gonna die  you know 
 ghostface 
no  you re gonna die  samantha 
choking on your own blood
while i hack up your sister 
unless we find you first 
 ghostface  for a mastermind 
you re not very bright 
waiting for me to call 
desperately hoping i m nearby
so the police can grab me 
but i m not nearby 
i m a step ahead 
be seeing you  samantha 
  did you get it 
  yep  geolocation
he s on the upper west side 
he s inside
an apartment building 
halfway across the city 
  on west 96th 
  how did you know that 
gale 
 sighs 
 no press  
bitch  last time i saw you 
you were in glee club 
forgive me if i don t trust you
to keep them safe 
  here you go  baby 
  thanks 
my friend danny works
on the upper west side 
he can get there quicker 
yeah 
or he could finish her off 
is it possible he s the killer 
fuck 
we have to get there now 
it s 50 blocks away 
we don t even know if it s true 
  sam  wait  take a minute 
  we don t have a minute 
you have to trust me 
we got to make the right call 
he s already     tara  sam 
get in 
what s she doing 
hey  get out of my car 
what do you think you re doing 
that s an official vehicle  hey 
should we use the sirens 
did you think
we d steal a police car
and not use the sirens 
  do you have a license 
  fuck  yeah 
what are you doing  siren wailing 
it s a cop car 
you can t steal a cop car 
 phone ringing 
 gale s partner 
that ll be our food 
hello 
not the food  it s for you 
who is it 
may i ask who s calling  please 
he says it s the killer 
hello  ghostface  hello  gale 
strange that you and i
have never spoken on the phone 
this is long overdue 
i agree 
 whispering  call the police 
 ghostface  i figured
after all these years
you d want an interview  cell
phone vibrating 
well  you figured right 
so  what s your motive
this time 
you angry at the movies or you
just trying to stay relevant 
 ghostface 
i could ask you the same 
don t you know
the legacy characters
nobody cares
about last century s heroes 
then why bother with me at all  ghostface 
call it nostalgia 
or maybe
you deserve to be punished
for all that money you made
off the misery of others 
maybe it s time
someone made a buck
you know you re like the tenth
guy to try this  right 
and spoiler alert 
it never works out
for the dipshit in the mask 
oh  but they certainly
leave a mark
richie and amber
managed to butcher dewey 
carved him up
like a christmas goose 
how does it feel
to lose the only man
fuck you 
how does it feel to know
that you weren t
there for him at the end 
 chuckles 
not there to give him comfort
as he died screaming
in his own guts 
you re the one
who s gonna die screaming 
maybe  but you won t
be around to see it 
you couldn t stop
what happened to dewey 
just like you re not
gonna be able to stop this 
 glass shatters  screaming 
 screams 
 grunts 
 ghostface grunting 
oh  god 
 banging on door 
 keypad beeping

 gasps 
great job 
both of you 
  you

frankly  i expected more
from the two of you
after what you did to us 
what do you mean   us  
 bailey chuckling  ta da 
mindy was right 
 chuckles 
it was easy to juke
the roommate lottery 
all i had to do to meet you
was room with a conceited 
condescending alpha
literally named chad 
fuck  it felt good to kill him 
this was your grandmother s 
sam 
nancy loomis 
really runs in
your fucking family  doesn t it 
speaking of family    wait for it 
my name s not ethan landry 
is it  dad 
 dad   chuckles 
wait  if it s you two 
that just leaves   
mindy 
hey  roomies 
you didn t see
that one coming  did you 
  yeah  because you died 
  kind of didn t  though 
it was a good way
to get off the suspect list 
stab gale weathers 
stab mindy on the train 
that sort of thing 
yep  and i just made sure
i was first on the scene
so i could switch her body out
with a fresh one 
little fake blood  a prosthetic 
you d be amazed at what
a grieving father
i got stu macher s mask 
he was my favorite 
nice  that s number three 
that s two 
which leaves   
your father s 
this is what we ve
been counting down to  sam 
i m gonna need you to put it on 
fuck you 
 bailey laughs 
ooh 
stay the fuck away from her 
   bailey  come on 
  what  what is this 
you did this as a family 
hell yeah  bitch 
you should know
better than anyone 
they re still not getting it 
i don t know what you believe 
but i didn t commit
those murders in woodsboro 
we know that 
of course you didn t 
you think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory 
come on  who do you think
started the rumors about you
 giggles 
do you know how easy it was
to turn sam
from the hero of woodsboro
how easy it is
to convince the world
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best 
because it s not enough
to just kill someone these days 
you have to assassinate
their character first 
so when dad here  discovers 
your horribly mutilated bodies   
 gasps 
posed with sam
wearing her father s mask 
he ll say some poor dumb bastard
read on the internet
and took matters
into their own deluded hands 
exactly  that s why
it s the perfect alibi 
and all the best lies
are based on the truth 
and you re a killer 
  just like your father 
  no  i m not 
yes  you are  you motherfucker 
you killed our brother 
what are you talking about 
you said your brother died
in a car accident 
 ethan  no  no  no 
you sweet  dumb thing 
he died in woodsboro
at the hands
of your bitch sister 
 thunder rumbling 
you re richie s family 
yeah 
ding ding ding ding 
she s finally starting
now  it wasn t
until i saw that photograph
of what you d actually done
to him that i knew 
that i knew you had to fucking
die  you had to be punished 
along with anyone else
who stands in our way 
there she is 
there s the fucking killer 
great parenting job  by the way 
shut your whore fucking mouth 
 tara  shit  sam  you okay 
have i been a perfect dad  no 
have i maybe overindulged
richie s love
yeah  maybe 
for me 
they re just a little dark 
but   
richie really loved them 
he loved them 
he even made a few of his own 
did you know  did you know 
so you think i didn t post
a holiday special 
well  i tried to 
i really did try 
that i could interact with 
there s a very special bond
between a father
and his first son 
 thunder rumbling 
which is why i helped him
build this collection 
this was all his 
yes  he s
a very passionate collector 
and he inspired others 
we had to kill those two
wannabe film students
because  well 
we had to kill you first  sam 
i put the theater in their name 
then good old detective bailey
but i didn t have to because 
by golly 
that gale weathers
is one hell of a journalist 
i built a tribute to my son 
which is why this is
where you have to die  sam 
surrounded by all the things
he loved the most 
what happens next 
after you re done with us
you just disappear 
no  we got to hurry
over to the hospital
and make sure mindy
and gale don t pull through 
everyone who had anything to do
with the death of my son
  fuck yeah  they do 
  yeah 
now put on the mask 
he was     sighs 
so pathetic 
 scoffs 
  that s not true 
  yeah  your son 
he was a man baby
who made his girlfriend
do all the killing 
he was a strong 
virile young man 
he was a limp dick little fuck
who cried
before i slit his throat 
shut the fuck up 
 coughing
