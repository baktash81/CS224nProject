good morning  angels 
good morning  angels 
good morning  charlie 
dylan  alex  natalie  i hope you re
ready for your next assignment 
meet eric knox  a brilliant engineer
and founder of knox technologies   
   an up and coming communications
software company 
last night  knox was kidnapped   
   and his voice identification
software was stolen 
who s the lady 
vivian wood 
president of knox technologies 
oh  she did it 
i guess we can all go home then 
angels  meet vivian wood 
our new client 
she s hired us to find eric knox 
hello 
who d have the most to gain
from knox s disappearance 
me  probably  i m his partner 
before we were partners   
   we were friends 
does knox have any enemies 
roger corwin  he s owner   
   of red star  the largest
communications satellite firm 
six months ago 
he tried to buy knox technologies 
when knox refused to sell 
corwin lost it 
charming 
was there a ransom demand 
nothing  but i know he s still alive 
i ll study the garage footage 
something may be there 
so corwin is our only lead 
hopefully  he ll take us to knox 
corwin gets a weekly massage
at madame wong s house of blossoms 
that s our chance to feel him out 
he said what 
 over my dead body  
i can accept those terms 
it s getting a little chilly in here 
yoko  i could use some warming up 
at your service 
good 
could we get started this millennium 
banzai 
ooh  yeah 
you re holding a lot of tension   
   in your 4th and 5th vertebrae 
i know 
let me see if i can work that   
   out 
by activating the right energy points 
you can increase circulation   
   alleviate pain   
   or even   
   render a man unconscious 
okay  let s go 
palm pilot 
got the car key 
i got his schedule 
you must have dozed off 
you re very good   
   with your hands 
i could use someone
like you on my staff

aren t going anywhere near your staff 
if corwin is behind knox s
disappearance   
   someone else
is doing his dirty work 
how s it coming
with the kidnapping footage 
i m enhancing a reflection
from the car window 
may i take your order  
three cheeseburgers  three
french fries and three cherry pies 
what do you guys want 
here s one of the kidnappers 
creepy thin man

and see if he works for corwin 
what s corwin doing tonight 
who s up for crashing a party 
bos

this place  it s japanese  is it not 
it s a 1 3th century shinto temple 
i had it    
i had it fedex d from kyoto 
blowfish 
isn t that poisonous 
it s a rare delicacy for the man who
has no fear of an excruciating death 
technically  1 in 60 is fatal 
tastes like chicken 
that would go
very nicely with broccoli 
the man laughs at death 
good work  bos 
get him to talk about knox 
at last  a worthy adversary 
let s see if you can survive
a test of intuition and judgment 
nat  that bartender is cute 
i m working 
he likes you 
go back and flirt a little 
that was fast 
i m not called balls out natalie
for nothing 
right 
i never saw you working here before 
i m new  i m like a virgin 
i mean  it s my first time   
   here at corwin s 
oh  boy  she s going down 
no way  he s into her 
just pick up the tray and walk away 
no  no  stay  stay and talk to him 
flip your hair 
flip your goddamn hair 
excuse me  i don t usually do this 
but i was wondering  
unless you re already
seeing someone else 
yeah 
 of course you are 
 no 
i m not seeing anyone 
free 
okay  thursday 
my favorite day 
great  i ll get tickets 
i love tickets 
what do you know 
a guy who speaks natalie 
where s j d  
will somebody help me up  please 
hello  girls  are you hearing me 
thin man  1 0 00 
why do they always run 
watch it 
nat 
brace 
jump 
check them all 
 clear 
 clear 
clear 
knox 
great work  angels 
but our job s only half finished 
there  s still the matter
of mr  knox s stolen technology 
what s so special about your software 
it s     it s really quite amazing 
we developed a program  you see 
everyone s voice is unique 
it has a unique signature   
   like a snowflake 
and it can be mapped  
audio dna  it makes it impossible to
disguise or scramble a voice signal 
which is why corwin wants it 
of course  all red star s satellites
have global positioning systems 
combine that
with voice identification  
  any cell phone could be a homing
device 
no one could hide 
imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands 
the end of privacy 
that s where you come in  angels 
corwin is premiering his red star
racer at the california speedway 
our chance to plant
a hidden camera on corwin 
looks like it s off to the races 
angels 
when roger corwin first got
involved in the world of racing   
   a lot of people said it was
a stopgap for my waning libido 
i had them all fired 
what s so funny  i did 
thanks for coming
to this little test run 
nat   
   i m going in 
but what can i say 
it s a red star day for me 
then it s back
to the day to day grind   
   of world domination
and enslavement 
hi 
work your magic 
it s hot out there 
it s hot in here too 
maybe i can make
you more comfortable 
oh  i ve come undone 
that feels good 
thank you 
i like what you ve done with it 
ours has bigger mirrors 
i love cars 
you like fast cars 
i like fast everything 
oh  my god 
thanks for the ride 
you re welcome 
mission accomplished  tomorrow 
corwin will give us a tour of red star 
ride  em  cowboy  make me proud 
nat 
what s going on 
we got a friend on the track 
that creep from chinatown 
creepy thin man 
it s a round track 
he s not going anywhere 
she s going after him 
the micro camera has allowed us
to study red star s layout 
the mainframe is right behind
that door 
that s where my software would be 
but the security looks incredible 
 restricted access 
 fingerprint i d 
retinal scanner 
angels  break it down 
only two red star directors
can access the mainframe 
to gain access  they have
to synchronize their entrance 
a gelatin scanning plate
takes exact fingerprints 
a laser accurate to  009 millimeters
scans the retina 
it is accessible only through
a monitored airless antechamber 
there s only one way to get through
undetected  be invisible 
the floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity 
any contact exceeding  25 seconds
triggers the alarm 
sounds impossible 
sounds like fun 
director 1
director 2
mein siegenbock ist sexy 
they got the wrong address 
you ready to whip them into shape 
alex 
you must be miss aarons  i m doris 
sorry about the confusion 
i had you scheduled for next week 
i don t know what happened 
that s what i m here to find out 
you are the efficiency expert 
yes 
i am 
bitch 
i heard that 
your methodologies are antiquated
and weak 
your procedures of approval ensure
that only the least radical ideas   
   are rewarded 
meanwhile  your competition is
innovating 
ow 
you 
what was the last
suggestion you made 
to make the coke machine free 
why 
caffeine helps us program 
perfect  smart   
   simple and logical 
what did your boss say 
he said no 
question 
who builds this company s products 
you do 
engineers do 
not managers 
they should be answering to you 
not you to them 
who else has an idea
like this man s coke machine 
all right  tell me 
better yet   
   can anyone show me 
red star mainframe level 4
it s not working 
there  s only one way to get through
undetected  be invisible 
the floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity 
any contact which exceeds  25 seconds
will trigger the alarm 
thank you  sir 
i hope you don t mind
if we look around 
so we have complete access
to red star s computer 
and they have no idea
we can peek inside 
you guys are tremendous  thanks 
i need evidence of knox technologies
software in the red star system 
 where is it 
 bosley has it in the laptop 
it has a direct link
to the red star mainframe 
bosley 
maybe we should be doing
our own analysis 
surely eric would be
the best person to  
our goal was to learn if red star
had stolen your software 
it would be unethical
to let you access their systems 
if we get proof  we ll tell you 
that makes sense 
that s cool  right 
right  viv 
you know  knox may not be
out of danger yet 
smile  don t panic the client 
one of us should check
security at his house 
absolutely  i agree 
 everything okay 
 yeah  nothing up here 
wow  that was cool 
who s the green beret 
my dad 
that s nice 
that s the guy who killed him 
yeah  they were
in army intelligence together 
this was his best friend
and he turned on him 
i m sorry 
thanks 
why do you keep it 
to remind me  be careful who you
trust  don t take any wooden nickels 
what about you 
did you ever have parents 
i mean   i know you have parents 
but i mean  
where s your mom 
she died when i was 6 
and i never met my father 
you never met your father 
now you work for   
   a man you ve never seen 
that s an interesting trend 
that was smooth 
want to play scrabble 
don t worry about it 
i got somebody  
that s okay 
what are they called  you know    
so  okay 
 this is a panic button 
 okay 
if you just press it 
then any one of us   
   whoever s closest  will be here
if there s any problem 
like that  okay 
right now  that would be you 
but you don t have a problem 
yeah  i do 
i don t know   
   how to make chicken 
scrabble

excuse me 
you re bad 
guys  finally you warm up a bit 
dylan  it s nat  vivian wood
is a fake and an all around bitch 
her assassin just paid me a visit 
we gotta warn knox 
i m at his house now 
you are 
you know what 
call alex and meet me at the agency 
dylan  shit 
don t stand next to the window 
it s not safe 
toga 
listen  i just found out that  
who s that 
working undercover 
it s a full service job 
i ll bet 
i can see by your  gown 
that you re unarmed 
some maniac could just stroll in
and blow you both to bits 
viv  you re obsessed  all work
and no play makes viv a dull girl 
i have to tie up some loose ends here 
so take a seat 
want some champagne 
 enemy  
i know 
sad news 
your girlfriends are dead 
and corwin 
i don t think it s gonna work out 
you and me 
which is a real bummer 
since you  dylan   
   are a tomcat in the sack 
let me get this straight  you re a
woman  women have natural intuition 
and you re a detective  and you had
no idea that this was going to happen 
 l knew 
 she knew 
and i know what ll happen next 
tell her  baby 
all the angels are going to heaven 
and bosley 
we ll keep him  we like him 
and his computer 
he s special 
corwin had nothing to do with this 
no  but i never really liked him 
 and the kidnapping was a setup 
 afraid so 
and red star was a setup 
you got it all figured out 
any other questions 
why 
ask your boss 
charlie 
you re after charlie 
charlie  charlie  charlie 
they say that in death   
   all life s questions are answered 
will you let me know 
let s go get charlie 
come on 
are you all right 
 what s going on 
 something s going on 
where s dylan 
they say in death 
all life s questions are answered 
will you let me know 
what are we doing 
house of pancakes  sizzler 
you are the cheapest man
on the planet 
what did it look like 
oh  i don t know  it was  like 
all cool and stuff 
you ve never seen a booby 
 have too 
 have not 
 i ve seen lots of boobies 
 yeah  right 
a little help 
don t ask 
where s knox  is he okay 
oh  he s great  he s the bad guy 
the kidnapping was a setup 
he s behind it all 
what  why 
he wasn t exactly forthcoming
when he shot me out the window 
bosley 
he s safe  knox already has him 
wait a minute 
let me get this straight 
bosley s with the man   
   who tried to kill us  that s safe 
he won t kill bosley
until he kills charlie 
kills charlie 
oh  jesus 
i don t know what his plan is 
but i know that we can stop him 
if knox thinks we re dead 
why blow up the agency 
why does he want charlie 
we do know that he wanted us
to break into red star 
imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands 
knox used us to access the mainframe
not to get back his software   
   but for control of their global
positioning satellites 
knox s software can match charlie s
voice over the phone 
and use red star satellites
to track him 
but why would knox go to so much
trouble to find charlie 
that s the guy who killed him 
they were in army intelligence
together 
his best friend turned on him 
knox thinks charlie killed his father 
so if he can intercept
charlie s call   
   he can locate him 
but knox has to get charlie
on the phone first 
 but the only one charlie calls is  
 bosley 
may i have some ice water  please

mission accomplished 
i think the client was blown away 
eric knox was born john mccadden 
it seems his life s mission
was to bring me down 
his dad was in my army intelligence
unit  working as a double agent 
when he was discovered 
the other side killed him 
i guess that s not
the story knox heard 
charlie  i ve really enjoyed
working on this assignment   
   and i eagerly anticipate
returning to work 
bosley s had one too many buddhas 
he s definitely had a few 
i have a team rebuilding the office 
it ll be better than new
when you get back 
thank you  charlie 
is there any chance
you ll be joining us  charlie 
i d love to  angels 
but i have some precious treasures
to watch over 
come on  charlie  it ll be fun 
we re drinking from coconuts
and buddhas 
how will we ever know
you truly exist   
   unless you come
have a coconut with us 
faith  angels  it s called faith 
to charlie 
to charlie 
to charlie 
to charlie 
let me toast you ladies 
with some ice cubes 
safe

i should go  i really should 
let s see if i can win the teddy bear
