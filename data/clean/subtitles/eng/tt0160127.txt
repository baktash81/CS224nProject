and founder of knox technologies
an upandcoming communications
software company
last night knox was kidnapped
and his voiceidentification

oh she did it
i guess we can all go home then
angels meet vivian wood
our new client
shes hired us to find eric knox
hello
whod have the most to gain
from knoxs disappearance
me probably im his partner
before we were partners
we were friends
does knox have any enemies
roger corwin hes owner
of red star the largest
communications satellite firm
six months ago
he tried to buy knox technologies
when knox refused to sell
corwin lost it
charming
was there a ransom demand
nothing but i know hes still alive
ill study the garage footage
something may be there
so corwin is our only lead
hopefully hell take us to knox
corwin gets a weekly massage
at madame wongs house of blossoms
thats our chance to feel him out
he said what
over my dead body
i can accept those terms
its getting a little chilly in here
yoko i could use some warming up
at your service
good
could we get started this millennium
banzai
ooh yeah
youre holding a lot of tension
in your 4th and 5th vertebrae
i know
let me see if i can work that
out
by activating the right energy points
you can increase circulation
alleviate pain
or even
render a man unconscious
okay lets go
palm pilot
got the car key
i got his schedule
you must have dozed off
youre very good
with your hands
i could use someone
like you on my staff
thanks for the offer but my hands
arent going anywhere near your staff
if corwin is behind knoxs
disappearance
someone else
is doing his dirty work
hows it coming
with the kidnapping footage
im enhancing a reflection
from the car window
may i take your order
three cheeseburgers three
french fries and three cherry pies
what do you guys want
heres one of the kidnappers
creepy thin man
now we just look for him
and see if he works for corwin
whats corwin doing tonight
whos up for crashing a party
bos

no problem
its a mictransmitter
put it on your back molar
i know its a mouthmic

thats incredible

your smile
thanks
this place its japanese is it not
its a 1 3thcentury shinto temple
i had it
i had it fedexd from kyoto
blowfish
isnt that poisonous
its a rare delicacy for the man who
has no fear of an excruciating death
technically 1 in 60 is fatal
tastes like chicken
that would go
very nicely with broccoli
the man laughs at death
good work bos
get him to talk about knox
at last a worthy adversary
lets see if you can survive
a test of intuition and judgment
nat that bartender is cute
im working
he likes you
go back and flirt a little
that was fast
im not called ballsout natalie
for nothing
right
i never saw you working here before
im new im like a virgin
i mean its my first time
here at corwins
oh boy shes going down
no way hes into her
just pick up the tray and walk away
no no stay stay and talk to him
flip your hair
flip your goddamn hair
excuse me i dont usually do this
but i was wondering
unless youre already
seeing someone else
yeah
of course you are
no
im not seeing anyone
free
okay thursday
my favorite day
great ill get tickets
i love tickets
what do you know
a guy who speaks natalie
wheres jd
will somebody help me up please
hello girls are you hearing me
thin man 1 000
why do they always run
watch it
nat
brace
jump
check them all
clear
clear
clear
knox
great work angels
but our jobs only halffinished
there s still the matter
of mr knoxs stolen technology
whats so special about your software
its its really quite amazing
we developed a program you see
everyones voice is unique
it has a unique signature
like a snowflake
and it can be mapped
audio dna it makes it impossible to
disguise or scramble a voice signal
which is why corwin wants it
of course all red stars satellites
have global positioning systems
combine that
with voice identification
any cell phone could be a homing
device
no one could hide
imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands
the end of privacy
thats where you come in angels
corwin is premiering his red star
racer at the california speedway
our chance to plant
a hidden camera on corwin
looks like its off to the races
angels
when roger corwin first got
involved in the world of racing
a lot of people said it was
a stopgap for my waning libido
i had them all fired
whats so funny i did
thanks for coming
to this little test run
nat
im going in
but what can i say
its a red star day for me
then its back
to the daytoday grind
of world domination
and enslavement
hi
work your magic
its hot out there
its hot in here too
maybe i can make
you more comfortable
oh ive come undone
that feels good
thank you
i like what youve done with it
ours has bigger mirrors
i love cars
you like fast cars
i like fast everything
oh my god
thanks for the ride
youre welcome
mission accomplished tomorrow
corwin will give us a tour of red star
ride em cowboy make me proud
nat
whats going on
we got a friend on the track
that creep from chinatown
creepy thin man
its a round track
hes not going anywhere
shes going after him
the micro camera has allowed us
to study red stars layout
the mainframe is right behind
that door
thats where my software would be
but the security looks incredible
restricted access
fingerprint id
retinal scanner
angels break it down
only two red star directors
can access the mainframe
to gain access they have
to synchronize their entrance
a gelatin scanning plate
takes exact fingerprints
a laser accurate to 009 millimeters
scans the retina
it is accessible only through
a monitored airless antechamber
theres only one way to get through
undetected be invisible
the floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity
any contact exceeding 25 seconds
triggers the alarm
sounds impossible
sounds like fun
director 1
director 2
mein siegenbock ist sexy
they got the wrong address
you ready to whip them into shape
alex
you must be miss aarons im doris
sorry about the confusion
i had you scheduled for next week
i dont know what happened
thats what im here to find out
you are the efficiency expert
yes
i am
bitch
i heard that
your methodologies are antiquated
and weak
your procedures of approval ensure
that only the least radical ideas
are rewarded
meanwhile your competition is
innovating
ow
you
what was the last
suggestion you made
to make the coke machine free
why
caffeine helps us program
perfect smart
simple and logical
what did your boss say
he said no
question
who builds this companys products
you do
engineers do
not managers
they should be answering to you
not you to them
who else has an idea
like this mans coke machine
all right tell me
better yet
can anyone show me
red star mainframe level 4
its not working
there s only one way to get through
undetected be invisible
the floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity
any contact which exceeds 25 seconds
will trigger the alarm
thank you sir
i hope you dont mind
if we look around
so we have complete access
to red stars computer
and they have no idea
we can peek inside
you guys are tremendous thanks
i need evidence of knox technologies
software in the red star system
where is it
bosley has it in the laptop
it has a direct link
to the red star mainframe
bosley
maybe we should be doing
our own analysis
surely eric would be
the best person to
our goal was to learn if red star
had stolen your software
it would be unethical
to let you access their systems
if we get proof well tell you
that makes sense
thats cool right
right viv
you know knox may not be
out of danger yet
smile dont panic the client
one of us should check
security at his house
absolutely i agree
everything okay
yeah nothing up here
wow that was cool
whos the green beret
my dad
thats nice
thats the guy who killed him

in army intelligence together
this was his best friend

her assassin just paid me a visit
we gotta warn knox
im at his house now
you are
you know what
call alex and meet me at the agency
dylan shit
dont stand next to the window
its not safe
toga
listen i just found out that
whos that
working undercover
its a fullservice job
ill bet
i can see by your gown
that youre unarmed
some maniac could just stroll in
and blow you both to bits
viv youre obsessed all work
and no play makes viv a dull girl
i have to tie up some loose ends here
so take a seat
want some champagne
enemy
i know
sad news
your girlfriends are dead
and corwin
i dont think its gonna work out
you and me
which is a real bummer
since you dylan
are a tomcat in the sack
let me get this straight youre a
woman women have natural intuition
and youre a detective and you had
no idea that this was going to happen
l knew
she knew
and i know whatll happen next
tell her baby
all the angels are going to heaven
and bosley
well keep him we like him
and his computer
hes special
corwin had nothing to do with this
no but i never really liked him
and the kidnapping was a setup
afraid so
and red star was a setup
you got it all figured out
any other questions
why
ask your boss
charlie
youre after charlie
charlie charlie charlie
they say that in death
all lifes questions are answered
will you let me know
lets go get charlie
come on
are you all right
whats going on
somethings going on
wheres dylan
they say in death
all lifes questions are answered
will you let me know
what are we doing
house of pancakes sizzler
you are the cheapest man
on the planet
what did it look like
oh i dont know it was like
all cool and stuff
youve never seen a booby
have too
have not
ive seen lots of boobies
yeah right
a little help
dont ask
wheres knox is he okay
oh hes great hes the bad guy
the kidnapping was a setup
hes behind it all
what why
he wasnt exactly forthcoming
when he shot me out the window
bosley
hes safe knox already has him
wait a minute
let me get this straight
bosleys with the man
who tried to kill us thats safe
he wont kill bosley
until he kills charlie
kills charlie
oh jesus
i dont know what his plan is
but i know that we can stop him
if knox thinks were dead
why blow up the agency
why does he want charlie
we do know that he wanted us
to break into red star
imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands
knox used us to access the mainframe
not to get back his software
but for control of their global
positioning satellites
knoxs software can match charlies
voice over the phone
and use red star satellites
to track him
but why would knox go to so much
trouble to find charlie
thats the guy who killed him
they were in army intelligence
together
his best friend turned on him
knox thinks charlie killed his father
so if he can intercept
charlies call
he can locate him
but knox has to get charlie
on the phone first
but the only one charlie calls is
bosley
may i have some ice water please
fly to me angels please come
please fly to me angels
i had a long talk with a squirrel once
longer than ive talked to most humans
