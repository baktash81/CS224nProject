and l d like to point out
it s paparazzi free 
you know when l come here most
is when l have to make a speech   
and l get nervous 
 you get nervous 
 sure 
see that 
sometimes when l have
to stand up in front of people   
   my heart kind of races 
and l can t remember my words 
 same here  l know 
 really  same with you 
wow  well  in my business 
it s not a good thing 
 what do you do 
 what do l do 
l want to show you something 
l hold on to this 
a paper clip 
was that a paper clip 
lt was 
l had to find something   
   to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart 
like a    
 like a lightning rod 
 like a lightning rod  exactly 
all the energy
goes into the paper clip 
and then what s left is 
your speech 
yeah  a smooth 
and l d like to think   
very compelling speech 
some of the best speakers
in history   
a paper clip 
let me see 
 henry kissinger 
he wasn t known
for his speaking abilities 
no  he wasn t 
 was he 
well  imagine what he would ve
been like without the 
 he would ve really sucked 
 he would ve what 
 really sucked 
 right

have to expose myself 
 when you put it that way  
 l didn t  you put it that way 
l don t care how much
you pay for dinner 
you shouldn t serve yourself up 
no matter what the cause 
so why don t you tell me
what you really think 
you really want me
to tell you what l think 
lf mr  wanton maddox  or whatever

ex illiterate senior citizen who learned   
    to read while fighting nazis

on medication   
   or a democrat 
did you check  or

thanks 
 good job 
come in 
 miss ventura 
l assume you know the reason
you ve been called here 
l think so 
 yes  sir 
do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is 
location 
loyalty and trust 
would you say those are qualities
that you possess 
l would 
 yes  sir 
miss burns agrees 
and she s urged me
to consider you 
we had no idea you were
interested in management   
   until miss kehoe brought us
your application 
by the way  you forgot
your social security number   
   and your 
mother s maiden name 
lf you just fill them in
and sign right there  perfect 
normally  you d go through the program
and train for a year as a butler  but  
 given the circumstances  
 due to overbooking and understaffing   
   we decided to accelerate
your application 
and move you into management
after the six week training 
with the proviso that you
pass the practical exam   
   and fulfill each requirement
for every station 
so you see  miss ventura 
sometimes   
   when life shuts one door 
it opens a window 
so jump 
steph  where are you 
l know you re in here 
 don t tell me you re busted 
 no  you are 
you know what 
you had no right 
what are you talking about 
you filled out
an application for me 
 they re considering you 
 do you know what you ve done 
 l did you a favor 
 no  lf you wanna do me a favor   
   then mind your own business
once in a while 
for two years  you ve yapped
about getting out of uniform   
and what ideas you got 
this morning  l m having coffee
with rosalie from personnel   
   and l ask her 
l go    marisa got a shot   
she goes    marisa who   
l go    marisa ventura  she s applied   
she goes    lf she applied 
l d slip it to the top of the pile   
so l just act real nonchalantlike
and l go    are you sure   
so she goes  she double checks 
and she tells me 
  marisa ventura ain t never applied
for no management program ever   
lmagine my shock and dismay 
my own partner 
lying to me like that 
then l figured maybe you were
too chickenshit  so l did it myself 
lf they took you 
you d be happy 
and if they didn t  you wouldn t know
the difference  so sue me 
these are the golden years 
we gotta prove our mothers wrong 
don t waste them 
what we did today was wrong 
but you didn t really lie 
not technically 
now you re starting
to sound like nixon 
letting someone believe
something s true when it s not   
   is just as much
a lie as a lie is 
l let him think l was staying in the
suite  not cleaning it  l m the maid 
l hate to break it to you 
but l don t think he s after your money

accidentally bump into him 
 l mean  do you think that s too obvious 
 no 
 a harry winston wreath 
 morning 
lsn t that that maid 
l mean  where would a maid get
that necklace  l thought maybe  
l ll fast forward through this  and you
just point her out if you see her 
oh  wait  could you just
go back on that bit 
l mean 
 it could be her 
let s just  
can we just go forward 
wait 
 that s my dolce coat 
 how could you have missed that 
 l m sorry  sir 
l ll have maintenance
get there with a plunger 
and l ll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that 
excuse me  sir  mr  bextrum wants
to see both of you in the park suite 
lionel  marisa 
oh  well  that s interesting 
she told me her name was maria 
l thought it would be impolite
to correct you 
and l suppose you think
it s polite to steal people s clothes 
 l didn t steal  
 miss ventura  mr  bextrum has spent   
   30 minutes trying to persuade
miss lane not to press charges 
l suggest you say as 
little as possible 
we have it all on video 
was everything returned 
 yes  sir 
 oh  chris  l m terribly sorry   
   to interrupt you  we thought you
should know what was going on 
 what is going on 
 the woman you thought was a guest   
   on this floor is 
the maid on this floor 
aren t you 
 marisa 
no  wait 
 her name is caroline 
no  chris  darling  that s my name 
she steals clothes  identities  
what the hell s happening here 
why are you dressed that way 
caroline 
ls this true 
yeah  it is 
jesus christ  the press is gonna
have a field day with this one 
there s no reason 
to involve the press 
how will you prevent her
from speaking 
this would never happen
at the four seasons 
l can assure you it has never
happened here before either 
lionel  you are slipping  you should ve
noticed something  l am disappointed 
please  mr  bextrum 
he had nothing to do with this 
of course  sir 
 l understand 
we ll talk about this later 
miss ventura  you no longer work here 
go to security 
hand in your passes   
   and you ll be escorted
from the building 
 yes  sir 
 ls that really necessary 
chris  let the man do his job 
 okay 
oh  chris 
oh  chris  l can t help but feel
that this is partly my fault 
lt isn t 
 spare yourself 
at least let me buy you lunch 
after all  we ve only got each other
to get through this humiliation 
caroline  the first lunch was a mistake 
a second would be complete torture 
drinks  then 
l need your nametag  passkey
and your ld card 
 sorry  marisa  but l have to 
 l understand 
god  don t tell me
they fired you over this too 
no 
actually  l made a decision
a moment ago 
lt was long overdue 
you quit 
sometimes   
   we re forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves 
thank you 
thanks 
 keef  bye 
to serve people   
   takes dignity 
and intelligence 
but remember 
they re only people with money 
and although we serve them 
we are not their servants 
what we do  miss ventura 
does not define who we are 
what defines us is how
well we rise after falling 
l think you ll make a wonderful
manager someday 
and it s been my great honor
to have worked with you 
marisa 
marisa  caroline  marisa 
l don t know which name to use 
marisa 
l don t get it 
 what just happened 
what don t you get 
 l m the maid 
what was all this 
 some kind of bet 
a little game of what 
 get the guests 
l was trying on her clothes 
and you were there   
   and you invited
me out  and everything  
and you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested 
who s kidding who here 
think you would ve looked at me
if you knew l was the maid 
 well    
 come on 
with respect for
your big hearted politics   
    l don t think so  mr  assemblyman 
 you didn t give me a chance 
you stand on your soapbox  judging
everyone  so sure they re judging you 
and you think they re not 
come on  half the time  l m
a stereotype they make fun of 
the other half of the time  l m
invisible  maybe that s the point 
the first time you saw me  l was cleaning
your bathroom  only you didn t see me 
was l supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak 
 you can t nail me for that 
 what are you doing 
not now 
 jerry  just

 marisa 
l just want the truth

that wanted to see what it felt like   
   to have someone like you look
at me the way you did  just once 
and l m sorry

l d like to make 
a short statement 
and it will be all
that l have to say about this    
this invasion of my privacy 
l happened to meet
miss ventura and her son   
   during my stay
at a hotel in new york 
and we became friends 
there are people from all walks
of life who i count as friends 
and my only regret in this instance
is that one of them  miss ventura   
   was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media   
   as a result of that 
friendship with me 
l need these numbers
to be plus 1 0 percent

any congressmen or presidents 
thanks very much 
we have to wrap this up 
jerry  he s not done
