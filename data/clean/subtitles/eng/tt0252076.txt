exilliterate senior citizen who learned
to read while fighting nazis
l thought your mother was in florida
just make sure shes not married
on medication
or a democrat
did you check or
rufus
sure okay great
can l talk to you for a second
l want you to find out who
caroline is in the park suite
dont write it down

thanks
good job
come in
miss ventura
l assume you know the reason
youve been called here
l think so
yes sir
do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is
location
loyalty and trust
would you say those are qualities
that you possess
l would
yes sir
miss burns agrees
and shes urged me
to consider you
we had no idea you were
interested in management
until miss kehoe brought us
your application
by the way you forgot
your social security number
and your
mothers maiden name
lf you just fill them in
and sign right there perfect
normally youd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler but
given the circumstances
due to overbooking and understaffing
we decided to accelerate
your application
and move you into management
after the sixweek training
with the proviso that you
pass the practical exam
and fulfill each requirement
for every station
so you see miss ventura
sometimes
when life shuts one door
it opens a window
so jump
steph where are you
l know youre in here
dont tell me youre busted
no you are
you know what
you had no right
what are you talking about
you filled out
an application for me
theyre considering you
do you know what youve done
l did you a favor
no lf you wanna do me a favor
then mind your own business
once in a while
for two years youve yapped
about getting out of uniform
and what ideas you got
this morning lm having coffee
with rosalie from personnel
and l ask her
l go marisa got a shot
she goes marisa who
l go marisa ventura shes applied
she goes lf she applied
ld slip it to the top of the pile

excuse me sir mr bextrum wants
to see both of you in the park suite
lionel marisa

she told me her name was maria
l thought it would be impolite
to correct you
and l suppose you think
its polite to steal peoples clothes
l didnt steal
miss ventura mr bextrum has spent
30 minutes trying to persuade
miss lane not to press charges
l suggest you say as
little as possible
we have it all on video
was everything returned
yes sir
oh chris lm terribly sorry
to interrupt you we thought you
should know what was going on
what is going on
the woman you thought was a guest
on this floor is
the maid on this floor
arent you
marisa
no wait
her name is caroline
no chris darling thats my name
she steals clothes identities
what the hells happening here
why are you dressed that way
caroline
ls this true
yeah it is
jesus christ the press is gonna
have a field day with this one
theres no reason
to involve the press
how will you prevent her
from speaking
this would never happen
at the four seasons
l can assure you it has never
happened here before either
lionel you are slipping you shouldve
noticed something l am disappointed
please mr bextrum
he had nothing to do with this
of course sir
l understand
well talk about this later
miss ventura you no longer work here
go to security
hand in your passes
and youll be escorted
from the building
yes sir
ls that really necessary
chris let the man do his job
okay
oh chris
oh chris l cant help but feel
that this is partly my fault
lt isnt
spare yourself
at least let me buy you lunch
after all weve only got each other
to get through this humiliation
caroline the first lunch was a mistake
a second would be complete torture
drinks then
l need your nametag passkey
and your ld card
sorry marisa but l have to
l understand
god dont tell me
they fired you over this too
no
actually l made a decision
a moment ago
lt was long overdue
you quit
sometimes
were forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves
thank you
thanks
keef bye
to serve people
takes dignity
and intelligence
but remember
theyre only people with money
and although we serve them
we are not their servants
what we do miss ventura
does not define who we are
what defines us is how
well we rise after falling
l think youll make a wonderful
manager someday
and its been my great honor
to have worked with you
marisa
marisa caroline marisa
l dont know which name to use
marisa
l dont get it
what just happened
what dont you get
lm the maid
what was all this
some kind of bet
a little game of what
gettheguests
l was trying on her clothes
and you were there
and you invited
me out and everything
and you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested
whos kidding who here
think you wouldve looked at me
if you knew l was the maid
well

with respect for
your bighearted politics
l dont think so mr assemblyman
you didnt give me a chance
you stand on your soapbox judging
everyone so sure theyre judging you
and you think theyre not
come on half the time lm
a stereotype they make fun of
the other half of the time lm
invisible maybe thats the point
the first time you saw me l was cleaning
your bathroom only you didnt see me

myself while taking a leak
you cant nail me for that
what are you doing
not now
jerry just

that wanted to see what it felt like
to have someone like you look
at me the way you did just once
and lm sorry
