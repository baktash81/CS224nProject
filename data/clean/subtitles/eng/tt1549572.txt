beautiful
but nothing special
until shown in rapid succession 
suddenly jupiter was alive 
breathing 
i was hypnotized
i was 17 when i got
my acceptance letter to mit 
  one  two  three  mit 
  okay  wait   
i felt like anything was possible 
i don t want to eat
the apple of cynicism 
and it was 
 flava   flava 
 flava   flava 
  yo  what s up  baby 
  it s your boy flava  f l a v a 
thatis your dude
with the big mouth  yo 
i don t know if you heard the news 
but the scientists say   
they just discovered
another planet super close to us   
with the conditions
that could support life 
really  well  now it s visible
up in the night sky 
they say if you look just east
of the north star  you ll see it 
it s a litte blue spot 
i want all you lovers out there
to make a wish   
on a tiny blue star   
as i play this hot joint for you
right now 
it s your boy flava 
that s easy 
what rhymes with     honey  
he s like   aii
right  enough with it   
what rhymes 
let s do some animals 
  you wanna give him some animals 
  yeah 
what rhymes
with   lion  
oh  my gosh 
   pion 
    a pion 
a small puma of the high himalayas 
did we figure out
what this guy s name is 
bob 
bob the robot 
he looks to me like a bob 
go ahead 
feel her 
she s in there  all right 
i hope so 
what rhymes with   
 light  
   light  
  oh  that s a good one 
and by all
appearances  the  uh  planet   
seems to be a mirror to our own 
from the continental structures
to the oceans 
even their cities are our cities 
and where are
we in terms of communication 
that s exactly my point 
if this planet is sustaining
intelligent life   
of comparable
levels to our own   
that s a very significant point 
so far we have nothing 
we have a jumble of radio signals 
the strongest of which
are military radars 
but even those radio signals are not
something we can parse out and understand 
  we don t 
  even know it really exists 
it could be some
cosmic mirror of sorts 
you ve written
extensively about that   
as the most likely explanation for why
it s identical to our own planet 
this planet exists 
it has mass and it has
a clearly detectable orbit 
it s even having radio signals 
so did you have a crew
on the inside 
do you have any tattoos 
  jeffrey 
  i m just asking 
you hear about that guy who s having
the contest to go to the other earth 
i mean  it s so stupid 
they re gonna get sucked
into a black star and die 
hmm 
is it good to be home 
yeah 
you know 
if you need anything   
oh  towels 
night 
good night  mom 
three  two  one 
booster ignition  and liftoff 
this will be
a trip like no other 
we will give those that travel with us
a unique and life changing experience 
travel to earth two 
now booking 
i was thinking i would like
to do something with my hands 
you know  maybe 
maybe outdoors  maybe not 
come on  i mean  you could
do something with your hands 
but you have such a great mind 
i don t wanna really be around too
many people or do too much talking 
all right 
well  there s a maintenance position
open at west haven high school 
just imagine that you re a sleep
and then you wake 
you re not sure where you are 
you re not sure
if anyone else is around 
what would you probably do first 
you likely would look around
and say   hello  
hello   
you re attempting to find 
 am i alone    
we here on earth
would like to know 
me and rob got into this
huge  stupid fight last night 
really  about what 
  i don t know 
  we were hanging out  and he just started fighting   
  hey 
  oh  hi 
what are you guys doing 
um  skipping chemistry 
  really 
  yeah 
guess who just texted me 
who  kyle 
is he gonna pick us up 
yo  it s the winter solstice 
that s right 
the shortest day of the year 
which means it will also be
the longest night of the year 
so take advantage 
you know what i m talking about 
also  today marks the anniversary of the
discovery of earth two a few years back 
can you remember
what you were doing that night 
i know i remember 
i met this girl from bridgeport   
that had a thing for the flava 
thatis right  baby 
you know how we do 
baby if you re still out there 
boo  holler at your boy 
flava  f l a v a  yeah 
not only do i got a big mouth 
i got a  uh 
you know my number
call me  mmm 
company that s underwriting
civilian travel to earth two
keith  with all the risks   
and all the unknowns 
why are you doing this 
i don t think
governments should dictate exploration 
and i don t think we should
automaticaly ban average citizens   
from being the first to see
this new world 
when early explorers first
set out west across the atlantic 
most people thought
the world was flat 
most people thought
if you sailed far enough west 
you would drop off a plane
into nothing 
these vessels sailing out
into the unknown   
they weren t carrying noblemen
or aristocrats  artists  merchants 
they were crewed by people
living on the edge of life 
the madmen  orphans 
ex convicts  outcasts   
like myself 
as a felon  i m an unlikely
candidate for most things 
but perhaps not for this 
perhaps i am the most likely 
rhoda 
hi  alex

okay 
it s typical for planets   
like mercury  venus 
mars and jupiter   
to have a period
during their orbit   
in which they are
obscured by the sun   
and no long observable from earth 
it s called superior conjunction 
if they remain behind the sun   
so  are you from new haven 
yeah 
still have family there 
mm hmm 
you like working
at maid in haven

yeah  have you

rhoda 
rhoda  all right 
good night  rhoda 
i ll see you next week 
good night 
listen to me 
keep your mind clear 
and that s it 
you will have peace of mind 
my dear  don t worry 
learn to adjust yourself 
the distance is not inordinately great 
but one of the challenges you have   
on interplanetary travel   
is prolonged weightless conditions 
you re in zero  g    
there is a possibility of
cosmic rays coming from stars 
and that could be
dangerous to them 
but once there 
you have no idea
what you te about to encounter 
what really are the beings
on this other planet like 
what happened 
i tried to do too much 
thanks 
you know that story
of the russian cosmonaut 
mm mmm 
thanks 
so  the cosmonaut 
mm hmm 
he s the first man ever
to go into space 
right  the russians
beat the americans 
mm hmm 
so he goes up
in this big spaceship 
but the only habitable
part of it s very small 
so the cosmonaut s in there 
and he s got this portal window 
and he s looking out of it  and he
sees the curvature of the earth   
for the first time 
i mean  the first man to ever
look at the planet he s from 
and he s lost in that moment 
and all of a sudden
this strange ticking   
begins coming out
of the dashboard 
okay  yeah 
rips out the control panel  right 
takes out his tools 
trying to find the sound 
trying to stop the sound 
but he can t find it 
he can t stop it  it keeps going 
few hours into this 
begins to feel like torture 
a few days go by
with this sound 
and he knows that
this small sound   
will break him 
he ll lose his mind 
what s he gonna do 
he s up in space 
alone  in a space closet 
he s got 25 days left to go   
with this sound 
so the cosmonaut decides   
the only way
to save his sanity   
is to fall in love with this sound 
so he closes his eyes   
and he goes into
his imagination 
and then he opens them 
he doesn t hear ticking any more 
he hears music 
and he spends
the remainder of his time   
sailing through space
in total bliss   
and peace 
why    are you cleaning houses 
i like to clean 
nobody likes to clean 
some people build houses 
some people decorate them 
some people clean them 
how old are you 
did you go to college 
no 
i read 
a wise choice 
i was a college professor 
you learn more doing it by yourself 
did you hear about
that contest 
mmm 
  the shuttle to earth two 
  mmm 
i submitted an essay 
you did 
it s silly 
you d go 
yes 
you don t know what s out there 
that s why i would go 
it s a bad idea 
in plato s allegory of the cave 
the people living in the cave   
all they knew 
what was in the cave 
and one day
one of them gets out   
and goes out and   
sees the real world 
comes back and tells the others 
you know what happened to him 
they beat him up 
they didn t believe it 
 that can t be    they said 
i don t think we re ready
to know what s out there 
it s a bad idea 
so you d rather
stay in the cave 
i mean 
if galileo had felt that 
we d still think we re the center of the
universe  that the sun is orbiting us 
i mean  they tried to burn him
at the stake for that 
yeah  maybe they should have 
we still think we re
the center of the universe 
we call ourselves earth one 
and them earth two 
you think they called
themselves earth two 
probably not 
did you wash that 
did you wash that sweater  yeah 
yes  i didn t dry it  i   
i laid it 
give me that 
why did you wash that 
stop washing things 
just stop washing things 
leave them alone  please 
just go 
this isn t a planet with little
green men and blue avatars 
it s essentially a mirror earth 
if we strike them 
they could strike us 
if we attempt to enslave them 
they could enslave us 
it s the perfect scenario
for mutually assured destruction 
preparations are nearing completion   
for interplanetary travel
to earth two 
the modifed saturn 5 rocket
has undergone rigorous testing   
fo meet federal
aerospace guidelines 
protesters are calling this
a modern day tower of babel 
where s purdeep 
checked out 
when s he coming back 
i don t think he is 
poured bleach in his ears 
what 
yeah

he blinded himself 
yeah 
you didn t know 
he said he was tired
of seeing himself everywhere 
hi 
hi

to the passenger side 
just  cause there s
traffic and  oh 
i tried to reach you at your work  but
they said they had never heard of you 
um  management

i d finally got to
a content place in my life 
our son was five  and my wife
was pregnant with a girl 
and then   
they were killed 
drunk driver 
a teenager 
i was in a coma 
and i was sleeping
all the time 
and i was so    angry 
so afraid of what i might
do to that kid  you know 
so i made sure my brother got
all the court documents 
the driver was a minor 
so i never found out the name 
are you still there 
he can t hear or see anything 
okay 
thank you 
you re welcome 
rhoda 
you are wondering why 
no 
no 
no

you might want to hear 
shoot a three for it 
okay  okay  okay  okay 
okay  okay  wait  wait 
um  i ll give you a hint 
do you wanna get high 
with you 
no  no 
do you want to get high 
they called 
number s on your door 
seriously 
seriously 
wait  hey 
you better write back to me
this time  okay 
united space ventures 
keith harding s office 
hello  this is  uh 
rhoda williams 
my brother gave me this number 
rhoda  yes 
just a moment 
rhoda  yes 
hi  it s keith harding 
i got your letter 
i was very moved by it 
you know  when i was 15 
my headmaster said to me 
he said  uh 
 harding  yo ll either go to prison
or be a millionaire  
yeah  well  i m   
i m grateful it was the latter 
but  uh  it s a fine line 
and finer than you would think 
you still want to
go to space  rhoda 
do i   
yes 
well you can 
the seat is yours 
kerry ll be in touch with you
with the details 
i ll see you soon 
  within our lifetimes 
  we have marveled 
as biologists have managed to look
at ever smaller and smaller things 
and astronomers have looked
further and further   
into the dark night sky 
back in time and out in space 
but maybe
the most mysterious of all   
is neither the small
nor the large 
it s us  up close 
could we even
recognize ourselves 
and if we did 
would we know ourselves 
what would we say to ourselves 
what would we learn
from ourselves 
what would we really
like to see   
if we could
stand outside ourselves   
and look at us 
hi 
a nice surprise 
you re all dressed up 
do you remember that essay
contest i told you about 
travel to earth two 
uh huh 
i won 
i m gonna go to space 
you won  that s great 
that s fantastic 
we have to celebrate  come here 
come on  we have to 
come here 
we have to celebrate 
first things first   
is to start with a drink 
we have to celebrate 
i can t believe   
how many people 
how many people wrote in 
that is   
i m so happy for you 
to the coming true
of your most improbable dream 
congratulations 
next step is a feast 
i m gonna cook you a
celebration feast  yeah 
okay 
okay 
okay  uh  food 
we need food first 
and   
do they know
how prepared you are 
i mean  with the joan tallis
costume  for halloween 
i will be fully
trained in the mojave desert 
oh  well  that s comforting 
they made me sign this waiver 
basically every other line of it
says   lf you die  it s your fault   
and you seem  you
seem totally okay with that 
you know  you ll need
an executor for your will 
do you have one 
no  but i don t have anything 
okay  so nothing to no one 
sounds pretty easy 
i think i could handle that 
um  burial or cremation 
i think my body would
probably burn up on reentry 
or be lost in space  so   
okay  ashes to ashes 
dust to dust 
we ll have to hold
a memorial service 
who would you like to attend 
i don t know 
you 
don t go 
please don t go 
we re so close
to something here 
we can t 
why can t we 
you know that we can t 
i know that we have 
stay  please 
let me tell you a story 
and if  after 
you still want me to stay 
i will stay 
it s about a girl 
at the start  she s   
naive 
reckless 
she does something that is   
unforgivable 
and one day 
she goes to apologize 
but she loses her nerve 
she s weak 
she lies to him 
and then   
she thinks that she might 
in the smallest ways 
be able to make his life
just a little bit better 
and so she wakes up
every day just to do that 
and some days
she thinks it s for him 
other days  she worries
that it s for herself 
that it was really just a way
to survive what i have done 
but i think that
i do make you happy 
oh  my god 
i know that you make me happy 
it was my fault 
i killed your wife and your son 
you better leave 
get out 
get out now 
now 
  the mistery fight member 
  is 21 year old rhodawilliams 
who is rumored to be
an ex convict 
her records are of limit
to the public 
as the alleged crime
occurred when she was under age 
there are reports of offers up to
three million dollars on the web   
for a ticket
aboard usv s flight 
we re getting word now that she s
arriving at her residence in new haven 
where robert hughes is standing by 
oh  oh  can you get   
right here 
rhoda  are you going to space 
rhoda williams 
rhoda 
just one photo 
rhoda 
you couldn t have told us 
we had to find out from the media 
i ju   
i just found out 
i wasn t sure i wanted to go 
i didn t   
are you going 
i m gonna go 
well  now 
now  wait a minute 
i mean  don t you think we  we should
have a discussion about this 
oh  they re in the backyard now 
look  rob 
rhoda  rhoda 
joining me
now from washington  d c 
astrophysicist
dr  richard berendzen 
the original proponent of this
extraordinary broken mirror theory 
dr  berendzen 
tell me the significance of this theory 
why it excites you
and how this changes   
the possibilities of the planet
known as earth two 
in the grand
history of the cosmos 
more than 13 000 million years old 
our earth is replicated elsewhere 
but maybe there s another way
of seeing this world 
if any small variation arises   
they look this way
you look that way   
suddeny maybe everything changes 
and now you begin to wonder 
what else is different 
or one might say that   
you have an exact mirror image
which suddenly is shattered 
and there s a new reality
