beautiful
but nothing special
until shown in rapid succession
suddenly jupiter was alive
breathing
i was hypnotized
i was 17 when i got
my acceptance letter to mit
one two three mit
okay wait
i felt like anything was possible
i dont want to eat
the apple of cynicism
and it was
flava flava
flava flava
yo whats up baby
its your boy flava flava
thatis your dude
with the big mouth yo
i dont know if you heard the news
but the scientists say
they just discovered
another planet super close to us
with the conditions
that could support life
really well now its visible
up in the night sky
they say if you look just east
of the north star youll see it
its a litte blue spot
i want all you lovers out there
to make a wish
on a tiny blue star
as i play this hot joint for you
right now
its your boy flava
thats easy
what rhymes with honey
hes like aii
right enough with it
what rhymes
lets do some animals
you wanna give him some animals
yeah
what rhymes
with lion
oh my gosh
pion
a pion
a small puma of the high himalayas
did we figure out
what this guys name is
bob
bob the robot
he looks to me like a bob
go ahead
feel her
shes in there all right
i hope so
what rhymes with
light
light
oh thats a good one
and by all
appearances the uh planet
seems to be a mirror to our own
from the continental structures
to the oceans
even their cities are our cities
and where are
we in terms of communication
thats exactly my point
if this planet is sustaining
intelligent life
of comparable
levels to our own
thats a very significant point
so far we have nothing
we have a jumble of radio signals
the strongest of which
are military radars
but even those radio signals are not
something we can parse out and understand
we dont
even know it really exists
it could be some
cosmic mirror of sorts
youve written
extensively about that
as the most likely explanation for why
its identical to our own planet
this planet exists
it has mass and it has
a clearly detectable orbit
its even having radio signals
so did you have a crew
on the inside
do you have any tattoos
jeffrey
im just asking
you hear about that guy whos having
the contest to go to the other earth
i mean its so stupid
theyre gonna get sucked
into a black star and die
hmm
is it good to be home
yeah
you know
if you need anything
oh towels
night
good night mom
three two one
booster ignition and liftoff
this will be
a trip like no other
we will give those that travel with us
a unique and lifechanging experience
travel to earth two
now booking
i was thinking i would like
to do something with my hands
you know maybe
maybe outdoors maybe not
come on i mean you could
do something with your hands
but you have such a great mind
i dont wanna really be around too
many people or do too much talking
all right
well theres a maintenance position
open at west haven high school
just imagine that youre a sleep
and then you wake
youre not sure where you are
youre not sure
if anyone else is around
what would you probably do first
you likely would look around
and say hello
hello
youre attempting to find
am i alone
we here on earth
would like to know
me and rob got into this
huge stupid fight last night
really about what
i dont know
we were hanging out and he just started fighting
hey
oh hi
what are you guys doing
um skipping chemistry
really
yeah
guess who just texted me
who kyle
is he gonna pick us up
yo its the winter solstice
thats right
the shortest day of the year
which means it will also be
the longest night of the year
so take advantage
you know what im talking about
also today marks the anniversary of the
discovery of earth two a few years back
can you remember
what you were doing that night
i know i remember
i met this girl from bridgeport
that had a thing for the flava
thatis right baby
you know how we do
baby if youre still out there
boo holler at your boy
flava flava yeah
not only do i got a big mouth
i got a uh
you know my number
call me mmm
company thats underwriting
civilian travel to earth two
keith with all the risks
and all the unknowns
why are you doing this
i dont think
governments should dictate exploration
and i dont think we should
automaticaly ban average citizens
from being the first to see
this new world
when early explorers first
set out west across the atlantic
most people thought
the world was flat
most people thought
if you sailed far enough west
you would drop off a plane
into nothing
these vessels sailing out
into the unknown
they werent carrying noblemen
or aristocrats artists merchants
they were crewed by people
living on the edge of life
the madmen orphans
exconvicts outcasts
like myself
as a felon im an unlikely
candidate for most things
but perhaps not for this
perhaps i am the most likely
rhoda

really its okay
okay
its typical for planets
like mercury venus
mars and jupiter
to have a period
during their orbit
in which they are
obscured by the sun
and no long observable from earth
its called superior conjunction
if they remain behind the sun
so are you from new haven

rhoda
rhoda all right
good night rhoda
ill see you next week
good night
listen to me
keep your mind clear
and thats it
you will have peace of mind
my dear dont worry
learn to adjust yourself
the distance is not inordinately great
but one of the challenges you have
on interplanetary travel
is prolonged weightless conditions
youre in zero g
there is a possibility of
cosmic rays coming from stars
and that could be
dangerous to them
but once there
you have no idea
what you te about to encounter
what really are the beings
on this other planet like
what happened
i tried to do too much
thanks
you know that story
of the russian cosmonaut
mmmmm
thanks
so the cosmonaut
mmhmm
hes the first man ever
to go into space
right the russians
beat the americans
mmhmm
so he goes up
in this big spaceship
but the only habitable
part of its very small
so the cosmonauts in there
and hes got this portal window
and hes looking out of it and he
sees the curvature of the earth
for the first time
i mean the first man to ever
look at the planet hes from
and hes lost in that moment
and all of a sudden
this strange ticking
begins coming out
of the dashboard
okay yeah
rips out the control panel right
takes out his tools
trying to find the sound
trying to stop the sound
but he cant find it
he cant stop it it keeps going
few hours into this
begins to feel like torture
a few days go by
with this sound
and he knows that
this small sound
will break him
hell lose his mind
whats he gonna do
hes up in space
alone in a space closet
hes got 25 days left to go
with this sound
so the cosmonaut decides
the only way
to save his sanity
is to fall in love with this sound
so he closes his eyes
and he goes into
his imagination
and then he opens them
he doesnt hear ticking any more
he hears music
and he spends
the remainder of his time
sailing through space
in total bliss
and peace
why are you cleaning houses
i like to clean
nobody likes to clean
some people build houses
some people decorate them
some people clean them
how old are you
did you go to college
no
i read
a wise choice
i was a college professor
you learn more doing it by yourself
did you hear about
that contest
mmm
the shuttle to earth two
mmm
i submitted an essay
you did
its silly
youd go
yes
you dont know whats out there
thats why i would go
its a bad idea
in platos allegory of the cave
the people living in the cave
all they knew
what was in the cave
and one day
one of them gets out
and goes out and
sees the real world
comes back and tells the others
you know what happened to him
they beat him up
they didnt believe it
that cant be  they said
i dont think were ready
to know whats out there
its a bad idea
so youd rather
stay in the cave
i mean
if galileo had felt that
wed still think were the center of the
universe that the sun is orbiting us
i mean they tried to burn him
at the stake for that
yeah maybe they should have
we still think were
the center of the universe
we call ourselves earth one
and them earth two
you think they called
themselves earth two
probably not
did you wash that
did you wash that sweater yeah
yes i didnt dry it i
i laid it
give me that
why did you wash that
stop washing things
just stop washing things
leave them alone please
just go
this isnt a planet with little
green men and blue avatars
its essentially a mirror earth
if we strike them
they could strike us
if we attempt to enslave them
they could enslave us
its the perfect scenario
for mutually assured destruction
preparations are nearing completion
for interplanetary travel
to earth two
the modifed saturn 5 rocket
has undergone rigorous testing
fo meet federal
aerospace guidelines
protesters are calling this
a modernday tower of babel
wheres purdeep
checked out
whens he coming back
i dont think he is
poured bleach in his ears
what
yeah
why would he do that
look i dont know
i mean whyd he pour bleach in his eyes
he blinded himself
yeah
you didnt know
he said he was tired
of seeing himself everywhere

id finally got to
a content place in my life
our son was five and my wife
was pregnant with a girl
and then
they were killed
drunk driver
a teenager
i was in a coma
and i was sleeping
all the time
and i was so angry
so afraid of what i might
do to that kid you know
so i made sure my brother got
all the court documents
the driver was a minor
so i never found out the name
are you still there
he cant hear or see anything
okay
thank you
youre welcome

this time okay
united space ventures
keith hardings office
hello this is uh
rhoda williams
my brother gave me this number
rhoda yes
just a moment
rhoda yes
hi its keith harding
i got your letter
i was very moved by it
you know when i was 15
my headmaster said to me
he said uh
harding yoll either go to prison
or be a millionaire
yeah well im
im grateful it was the latter
but uh its a fine line
and finer than you would think
you still want to
go to space rhoda
do i
yes
well you can
the seat is yours
kerryll be in touch with you
with the details
ill see you soon
within our lifetimes
we have marveled
as biologists have managed to look
at ever smaller and smaller things
and astronomers have looked
further and further
into the dark night sky
back in time and out in space
but maybe
the most mysterious of all
is neither the small
nor the large
its us up close
could we even
recognize ourselves
and if we did
would we know ourselves
what would we say to ourselves
what would we learn
from ourselves
what would we really
like to see
if we could
stand outside ourselves
and look at us
hi
a nice surprise
youre all dressed up
do you remember that essay
contest i told you about
travel to earth two
uhhuh
i won
im gonna go to space
you won thats great
thats fantastic
we have to celebrate come here
come on we have to
come here
we have to celebrate
first things first
is to start with a drink
we have to celebrate
i cant believe
how many people
how many people wrote in
that is
im so happy for you
to the coming true
of your most improbable dream
congratulations
next step is a feast
im gonna cook you a
celebration feast yeah
okay
okay
okay uh food
we need food first
and
do they know
how prepared you are
i mean with the joan tallis
costume for halloween
i will be fully
trained in the mojave desert
oh well thats comforting
they made me sign this waiver
basically every other line of it
says lf you die its your fault
and you seem you
seem totally okay with that
you know youll need
an executor for your will
do you have one
no but i dont have anything
okay so nothing to no one
sounds pretty easy
i think i could handle that
um burial or cremation
i think my body would
probably burn up on reentry
or be lost in space so
okay ashes to ashes
dust to dust
well have to hold
a memorial service
who would you like to attend
i dont know
you
dont go
please dont go
were so close
to something here
we cant
why cant we
you know that we cant
i know that we have
stay please
let me tell you a story
and if after
you still want me to stay
i will stay
its about a girl
at the start shes
naive
reckless
she does something that is
unforgivable
and one day
she goes to apologize
but she loses her nerve
shes weak
she lies to him
and then
she thinks that she might
in the smallest ways
be able to make his life
just a little bit better
and so she wakes up
every day just to do that
and some days
she thinks its for him
other days she worries
that its for herself
that it was really just a way
to survive what i have done
but i think that
i do make you happy
oh my god
i know that you make me happy
it was my fault
i killed your wife and your son
you better leave
get out
get out now
now
the mistery fight member
is 21yearold rhodawilliams
who is rumored to be
an exconvict
her records are of limit
to the public
as the alleged crime
occurred when she was under age
there are reports of offers up to
three million dollars on the web
for a ticket
aboard usvs flight
were getting word now that shes
arriving at her residence in new haven
where robert hughes is standing by
oh oh can you get
right here
rhoda are you going to space
rhoda williams
rhoda
just one photo
rhoda
you couldnt have told us
we had to find out from the media
i ju
i just found out
i wasnt sure i wanted to go
i didnt
are you going
im gonna go
well now
now wait a minute
i mean dont you think we we should
have a discussion about this
oh theyre in the backyard now
look rob
rhoda rhoda
joining me
now from washington dc
astrophysicist
dr richard berendzen
the original proponent of this
extraordinary broken mirror theory
dr berendzen
tell me the significance of this theory
why it excites you
and how this changes
the possibilities of the planet
known as earth two
in the grand
history of the cosmos
more than 13000 million years old
our earth is replicated elsewhere
but maybe theres another way
of seeing this world
if any small variation arises
they look this way
you look that way
suddeny maybe everything changes
and now you begin to wonder
what else is different
or one might say that
you have an exact mirror image
which suddenly is shattered
and theres a new reality
and there in lies the opportunity
and the mystery
what else
what new what now
stay away
get away from me
please let me in please
just stay stay away from me
stay away
john
john
stay away from me
john please let me in
stay away from me
open the door
im warning you stay away from me
please
i have something i have to explain
i have to tell you please
wait
okay
john
do it
i heard on tv about a theory
they think
that the moment
we first saw the other earth
was the moment
our synchronicity was broken
that was just
over four years ago
maybe theyre up there
maybe not but
maybe
we are just
days before the launch
of the united space ventures
civilian shuttle
members of the crew
of this dangerous voyage
have been training intensely
here at the mojave spaceport
the media blackout
was finally lifted
with a press conference
early this morning
im feeling privileged
and
oddly im proud
