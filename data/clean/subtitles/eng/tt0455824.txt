is only onesixth
of what it was once worth
we need the money ramsden
but maitland
is just about to muster the fats
what
get thethe big cows ready for market
ramsden you and i both know
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows
at least not of the animal variety
lady ashley
ii do think thats a bit harsh
oh ramsden drink your tea
lady ashley
what do you intend to do
i intend to travel
to this cattle station
sell it
and bring maitland home myself
but lady ashley its australia
darling sarah i implore you do not travel
outbreak of war imminent stop

run after your boong friend cause as far
as this towns concerned you are a black
you work with them
you eat with them
and you sleep with them
oh crikey
when you see her wave your hat
what are you waiting for an invitation
i hate coming to town
lady sarah ashley
a genuine aristocrat
living right here in darwin
administrator were at war
oh
as the officer
in charge of livestock purchases
for the armed forces
shes quite a looker
i fail to see
what lady sarah ashley
has to do with carneys stranglehold
of the beef industry
her husband lord ashley
claims hes mustering fats
at faraway downs
faraway downs
faraway downs
the only cattle station
in the whole of the north
not owned by leslie king carney
lord maitland ashley
is mustering on faraway downs
yeah yeah
isnt quite what we had in mind is it neil
no yeah
and now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat
doesnt look like theyre gonna sell
faraway downs to me neil
ah she wont last
a delicate english rose withers
in the outback hmm
you with me
if you must know i am to be met
by my husbands trusted man
a mr drover
the bloody drover
bring it yes
move it
look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome
my fianc√© neil fletcher
manages faraway downs
good day
a bit pale
not a badlooking sheila
but whats the story on the luggage
wants to settle down
in the outback does she
if she stays and lord ashley manages to
get his cattle down onto that wharfthere
then weve got a competitor
for the army contract neil
carneys control of every
cattle station in the north
jeopardizes the supply of beef
to our troops
but its a poor war that doesnt make
a decent patriot rich so
i dont want a single beast
from faraway downs
to set a hoof on that wharf
you with me neil
yeah yeah nature will take its course
what about the missus
no ive arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route
give her a taste of the outback

that strange woman
she fireem that fletcher

from that day on
we call her mrs boss
why would fletcher block the water pump
i dont know all crazy
white fella blackfella all crazy
crazy
mr flynn
milady
dont get up
the truth mr flynn
this uh ledger
which um fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband
is a tale of decline and ruin
redolent of the great gibbon
there is however another
kept for the benefit
of mr carney
in which is recorded
all the unbranded
fat cattle
siphoned off across the river and into his herd
and the boy
hes fletchers son isnt he
as with all things fletcher
its impossible to prove anything
still if carneys good christian wife
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself
fletchers chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed
im going to the authorities
and i will be telling them
carney is the authority here
are you suggesting
i let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what its worth
im suggesting that you continue
to do what your husband set out to do
drove
drove the cattle to darwin
would you mind
i need a drink
my lady drove
drove the cattle to darwin
sell them to the army
and youll break carneys monopoly
use the profits to put faraway downs
back on its feet
you go back to london
youre sitting pretty
for the rest of your life
thats what maitland
said he was doing
and theres no reason
why you cant do the same
there is just one small problem
having dismissed fletcher
theres no one to muster the cattle
hyah hyah
flynn mrs boss
its the drover
drover drover
hyah
hyah
yeah drover yeah
teach me how to
break them brumbies
see any boys in there
no
goolaj go see if theyre
out in the top paddock
mr drover
just get the bloody brumbies in there
ill find out what the hells going on
teach me to break them horses
fill the water trough son
i need to speak to you
where the hell are
all the bloody stockmen eh
thats what i need to speak to you about
wheres fletcher
we disagreed and i dismissed him
dismissed
yes
wa hang on what about the cattle
well it beggars belief
but as he was leaving
he deliberately let the cows out of
the uh i dont knowwhatever you call it
and they ran off
damn do you realize woman
what youve done
mr drover do not take that tone with me
thank you very much
dont take that tone with you huh
no
im asking you woman
do you know what youve done
i wont get another drove this late in the season
youve cost me my living
cant you just round them up
round them up huh oh round them up yeah
yes you just go get them
1500 head of cattle
oh
scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men
thats a great idea stupid cow
mr drover
i was right to dismiss mr fletcher
on moral grounds
moral grounds
youre at that again are ya
let me guess
he wanted to uh exploit you did he
fancy you did he
what
stop it i
is there any man in this
world who doesnt fancy you
please
huh
mr fletcher is working for mr carney
they were pushing the best
of the unbranded cattle
across the river
onto mr carneys property
they were stealing
theres no surprises there
no hes a bad man
all right all right
but look you cant prove it right
well
you cant
and you cant win against carney
so just take my advice lady
grab king carneys offer and go the hell
back to england as quickly as possible
that way youd make everybody happy
especially me
so youre just going to walk away
i learned a long time ago
not to fight other peoples wars
wait wait wait mr drover wait
please please please
mr drover please please wait
please i
listen you said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a
with a bush brumby
if you agree to help me i
i will give you my capricornia
and how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men huh
oh crikey
mum was a drovers boy for fletcher
bandy was a drovers boy
a long time ago
some white stockmen like to have
an aboriginal woman on the drove
to keep em company at night

and i am going to bring
faraway downs back to life
i dont follow you
well this is perfect
im going to need a manager
well i thought that
it would be a good job for you
anyway i almost forgot something
i got a suit for you
whoa whoa whoa whoa stop dont do that
do what
the thing you do
when you get a head full of ideas
like crossing the kuraman
come on mate
you dont know what youre talking about
running a station manager
im a drover all right
no man hires me no man fires me
so you dont want to go to the ball
ball
sarah
im as good as black to that mob up there
i mix with dingoes not not duchesses
they keep out of my way
and i keep out of theirs
thats the way it is
just because it is
doesnt mean it should be
but thats the way it is
cheer up little fella
you and that chinaman gonna take me out
on a big night at the pictures
how
you cant take halfcaste
to picture show
coppers take him
he wont be halfcaste
he got every right to be there
we use magic
you got every right to be there
cause youre a special boy
hes a special boy
nobody gonna stop you
from going nobody
somewhere
over the rainbow
way up high
theres a land that i heard of
once in a lullaby
somewhere over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams
that you dare to dream
really do come true
how good of you lady ashley
to take an interest
in dr barkers work on the mission
well actually administrator
my interest is of a more personal nature
i must say lady ashley
smashing
would you excuse me
amongst the leading lights of darwin
i was wondering if you could
introduce me to dr barker
sarah
ah captain dutton
lady ashley ill leave you
in the capable hands of the captain
im sure he would be happy
to introduce you to dr barker
i want to talk to you
her husband barely in the grave
and there she is
cavorting with the captain
his mother has passed away
and that dress
yes
bidding should go through the roof
he is a little boy
he needs someone to look after him
sarah
im desperate to speak to dr barker
im going to adopt him its only a matter
of time before they take him away
adopting an aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize
neil come on
i want to talk with lady ashley
yeah no we will later love
i dont mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight i wont be jealous
shes an inspiration
yeah shes full of surprises
but surely doctor life on the station
with people who care for these children
is far better than life
on a government institution
oh the auction
our gracious patroness lady ashley
bravo
now for the auction of the first dance
the mixedrace children must be dislocated
from the primitive fullblood aborigine
do i hear a first bid please
five pounds here
five pounds
how else are we to breed the black out of them
i bid more than that for a dance with mrs allsop
remember its for the mission
has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this
lady ashley please
for the war effort do i hear 20 pounds
its a fact of science that the aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring
fifty pounds
fifty pounds
seventy pounds
ninetyfive
no mother forgets her child dr barker
lady ashley
this is most inappropriate
that is a new record
we cant very well ask their fathers can we
how dare you
going once
or perhaps we should
going twice
after all theyre right here in this room
thats a lie
500 quid
500 pounds
well indeed
if it isnt the man who
almost singlehandedly
made the australian beef industry
what it is today
mr king carney
of the carney cattle company
for the benefit of the missions
well theres nothing more to say
but let the king take his prize
can i get a picture please smile
ah
let me say lady ashley
just how sorry i was
to hear of your husbands death
at the hands of that wild savage
a savage yes mr carney
but you and i both know that my husband
was not killed by an aborigine
no i did not know that
perhaps you should ask mr fletcher
are you making an accusation
not one i can prove
in business ive been fortunate
in family a little less so
im prepared to go to 75000 pounds
this is not about the money mr carney
there is a little boy
there is a
there are people who are living
living on the station
for whom i am responsible
and who will take care of them
a cattle station is like a country
and you have no one to look after it
now i can offer protection
to every man woman and child
and child
you will do that
how can i keep you at your word
ill put it in the contract
king carney and lady ashley
that was a marvelous treat
no one can close a deal
more quickly than king carney
now the raffle for the war effort
the last flying boat
leaves tomorrow because of the war
will i tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract
but the true blue australian man
like king carney is
inform your lawyer
uh
inform your lawyer that faraway downs
is no longer for sale
foxtrot
here you are
well you didnt think i was gonna
waste my dance lesson did you
lets really give the bastards
something to talk about huh

a song to light the darkest night
and guide me from afar
and i will never
be afraid
now i know youre somewhere
youre everywhere to me
the warming of the sun
upon the earth beneath my feet
and when the rain falls down
you tell the story
and i will hear you
always near you
by the boab tree
from the sunburnt plains
of faroff north australia
came a fella born to ride
the wide brown land
oh he grew up running wild
but soon by all was styled
as the countrys greatest
everdrovin man
though his legend rode the winds
from broome to darwin
they loved and loathed him
right from end to end
for when the drover gave his heart
to a girl whose skin was dark
from that day on
he was no white mans friend
so goes the drovers story
you will hear it near and far
and in the end
its all hell ever own
it says the outcast is a free man
lfhe sleeps under the stars
makes the blanket
of the southern skies his home
but the drover is a man
of constant shadows
haunted by his pain
his past and name
for every mile he rides
what he cannot hide
is the longing in his heart
to love again
so goes the drovers story
youll hear it near and far
and in the end
its all hell ever own
it says the outcast is a free man
if he sleeps under the stars
makes the blanket
