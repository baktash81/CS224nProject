this land my people

but white fellas call it   
australia 
but this story not begin that day 
this story begin a little while ago
in a land far  far away 
that land called england 
my husband must sell faraway downs 
but the offer from
this  cattle king  mr  carney   
is only one sixth
of what it was once worth 
we need the money  ramsden 
but maitland
is just about to muster the fats 
what 
get the the big cows ready for market 
ramsden  you and i both know   
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under   
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows 
at least not of the animal variety 
lady ashley 
i i do think that s a bit harsh 
  oh  ramsden  drink your tea 
  lady ashley 
what do you intend to do 
i intend to travel
to this cattle station   
sell it   
and bring maitland home myself 
but  lady ashley  it s australia 
darling sarah  i implore you  do not travel 
outbreak of war imminent  stop 
 maitland  your concern
regarding war duly noted  stop 
have plan concerning cattle 
sale to king carney not necessary 
  need more time  stop 
   nonsense  stop 
expect contract for sale of station
to be drawn by time of my arrival  stop 
cannot meet you  stop

oh  crikey 
when you see her  wave your hat 
what are you waiting for  an invitation 
i hate coming to town 
lady sarah ashley 
a genuine aristocrat
living right here in darwin 
administrator  we re at war 
oh 
as the officer   
in charge of livestock purchases
for the armed forces 
  she s quite a looker 
  i fail to see   
what lady sarah ashley   
has to do with carney s stranglehold
of the beef industry 
her husband  lord ashley   
claims he s mustering fats
at faraway downs 
  faraway downs 
  faraway downs 
the only cattle station
in the whole of the north   
not owned by leslie  king  carney 
  lord maitland ashley
is mustering on faraway downs 
 yeah  yeah 
  isn t quite what we had in mind  is it  neil 
  no  yeah 
and now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat 
doesn t look like they re gonna sell
faraway downs to me  neil 
ah  she won t last 
a delicate english rose withers
in the outback  hmm 
you with me 
if you must know  i am to be met 
by my husband s trusted man 
a mr  drover 
the bloody drover 
bring it  yes 
move it 
look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome 
my fianc√©  neil fletcher 
manages faraway downs 
good day 
a bit pale 
not a bad looking sheila 
but what s the story on the luggage 
wants to settle down
in the outback  does she 
if she stays and lord ashley manages to
get his cattle down onto that wharfthere   
then we ve got a competitor
for the army contract  neil 
carney s control of every
cattle station in the north   
jeopardizes the supply of beef
to our troops 
but it s a poor war that doesn t make
a decent patriot rich  so   
i don t want a single beast
from faraway downs   
to set a hoof on that wharf 
  you with me  neil 
  yeah  yeah  nature will take its course 
what about the missus 
no  i ve arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route 
give her a taste of the outback

why would fletcher block the water pump 
i don t know  all crazy 
  white fella  blackfella  all crazy 
  crazy 
 mr  flynn 
  milady 
  don t get up 
the truth  mr  flynn 
this  uh  ledger   
which  um  fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband   
is a tale of decline and ruin   
redolent of the great gibbon 
there is  however  another   
kept for the benefit   
of mr  carney   
in which is recorded
all the unbranded   
fat cattle   
  siphoned off across the river and into his herd 
and the boy 
he s fletcher s son  isn t he 
as with all things fletcher 
it s impossible to prove anything 
still  if carney s good christian wife   
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself   
fletcher s chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed 
i m going to the authorities 
and i will be telling them 
  carney is the authority here 
  are you suggesting   
i let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it s worth 
i m suggesting that you continue
to do what your husband set out to do 
drove 
drove the cattle to darwin 
would you mind 
i need a drink 
my lady  drove 
drove the cattle to darwin 
sell them to the army   
and you ll break carney s monopoly 
use the profits to put faraway downs
back on its feet 
you go back to london 
you re sitting pretty
for the rest of your life 
that s what maitland
said he was doing 
and there s no reason
why you can t do the same 
there is just one small problem 
having dismissed fletcher 
there s no one to muster the cattle 
hyah  hyah 
flynn  mrs  boss 
it s the drover 
drover  drover 
hyah 
hyah 
yeah  drover  yeah 
teach me how to
break them brumbies 
  see any boys in there 
  no 
goolaj  go see if they re
out in the top paddock 
  mr  drover 
  just get the bloody brumbies in there 
  i ll find out what the hell s going on 
  teach me to break them horses 
  fill the water trough  son 
  i need to speak to you 
where the hell are
all the bloody stockmen  eh 
  that s what i need to speak to you about 
  where s fletcher 
  we disagreed  and i dismissed him 
  dismissed 
  yes 
  wa  hang on  what about the cattle 
well  it beggars belief 
but as he was leaving   
he deliberately let the cows out of
the  uh  i don t know whatever you call it   
and they ran off 
damn  do you realize  woman 
what you ve done 
mr  drover  do not take that tone with me 
thank you very much 
  don t take that tone with you  huh 
  no 
i m asking you  woman 
do you know what you ve done 
i won t get another drove this late in the season 
you ve cost me my living 
  can t you just round them up 
  round them up  huh  oh  round them up  yeah 
  yes  you just go get them 
  1 500 head of cattle 
oh 
scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men 
that s a great idea  stupid cow 
mr  drover 
i was right to dismiss mr  fletcher   
on moral grounds 
moral grounds 
you re at that again  are ya 
let me guess 
he wanted to  uh  exploit you  did he 
  fancy you  did he 
  what 
stop it  i  
is there any man in this
world who doesn t fancy you 
  please 
  huh 
mr  fletcher is working for mr  carney 
they were pushing the best
of the unbranded cattle   
across the river
onto mr  carney s property 
they were stealing 
  there s no surprises there 
  no  he s a bad man 
all right  all right 
but look  you can t prove it  right 
  well 
  you can t 
and you can t win against carney 
so just take my advice  lady 
grab king carney s offer and go the hell
back to england as quickly as possible 
that way you d make everybody happy 
especially me 
so you re just going to walk away 
i learned a long time ago
not to fight other people s wars 
wait  wait  wait  mr  drover  wait 
please  please  please

  somewhere  
  over the rainbow  
 way up high  
  there s a land that i heard of 
  once in a lullaby  
  somewhere over the rainbow  
  skies are blue  
  and the dreams  
  that you dare to dream  
  really do come true   
how good of you  lady ashley   
to take an interest
in dr  barker s work on the mission 
well  actually  administrator 
my interest is of a more personal nature 
i must say  lady ashley 
  smashing 
  would you excuse me 
amongst the leading lights of darwin 
i was wondering if you could
introduce me to dr  barker 
  sarah 
  ah  captain dutton 
lady ashley  i ll leave you
in the capable hands of the captain 
i m sure he would be happy
to introduce you to dr  barker 
  i want to talk to you 
  her husband barely in the grave   
and there she is
cavorting with the captain 
  his mother has passed away 
  and that dress 
yes 
bidding should go through the roof 
he is a little boy 
he needs someone to look after him 
  sarah 
  i m desperate to speak to dr  barker 
i m going to adopt him  it s only a matter
of time before they take him away 
adopting an aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize 
neil  come on 
i want to talk with lady ashley 
yeah  no  we will later  love 
i don t mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight  i won t be jealous 
  she s an inspiration 
  yeah  she s full of surprises 
but surely  doctor  life on the station
with people who care for these children   
is far better than life
on a government institution 
oh  the auction 
our gracious patroness  lady ashley 
bravo 
now  for the auction of the first dance 
the mixed race children must be dislocated
from the primitive  full blood aborigine 
  do i hear a first bid  please 
  five pounds here 
  five pounds  
  how else are we to breed the black out of them 
i bid more than that for a dance with mrs  allsop 
remember  it s for the mission 
has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this 
  lady ashley  please 
  for the war effort  do i hear 20 pounds 
it s a fact of science that the aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring 
  fifty pounds 
  fifty pounds 
  seventy pounds 
  ninety five 
no mother forgets her child  dr  barker 
  lady ashley 
  this is most inappropriate 
100 
  that is a new record 
  we can t very well ask their fathers  can we 
  how dare you 
  going once 
  or perhaps we should 
  going twice 
  after all  they re right here in this room 
  that s a lie 
500 quid 
500 pounds 
well  indeed 
if it isn t the man who 
almost single handedly   
made the australian beef industry   
what it is today 
mr  king carney
of the carney cattle company 
for the benefit of the missions 
well  there s nothing more to say   
but let the king take his prize 
  can i get a picture  please  smile 
  ah 
let me say  lady ashley 
just how sorry i was   
to hear of your husband s death   
at the hands of that wild savage 
a savage  yes  mr  carney   
but you and i both know that my husband
was not killed by an aborigine 
no  i did not know that 
perhaps you should ask mr  fletcher 
  are you making an accusation 
  not one i can prove 
in business  i ve been fortunate 
in family  a little less so 
i m prepared to go to 75 000 pounds 
this is not about the money  mr  carney 
there is a little boy 
there is a 
there are people who are living 
living on the station   
for whom i am responsible 
and who will take care of them 
a cattle station is like a country 
and you have no one to look after it 
now  i can offer protection   
to every man  woman and child 
and child 
you will do that 
how can i keep you at your word 
i ll put it in the contract 
 king carney and lady ashley 
that was a marvelous treat 
no one can close a deal
more quickly than king carney 
now  the raffle for the war effort 
the last flying boat   
leaves tomorrow because of the war 
will i tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract 
but the true blue australian man
like king carney is 
inform your lawyer 
uh 
inform your lawyer that faraway downs
is no longer for sale

the rain will fall

let s go home 
there s no place like it

why we tell story
is the most important of all 
that s how you keep them people
belong you   
always 
oh 
mrs  boss  i sing you to me 
here 
and i will hear you 
  sing and i will hear you  
  no matter where you are  
  a song to light the darkest night  
  and guide me from afar 
  and i will never 
  be afraid  
  now i know you re somewhere  
  you re everywhere to me  
  the warming of the sun  
  upon the earth beneath my feet  
  and when the rain falls down  
  you tell the story  
  and i will hear you  
  always near you  
  by the boab tree   
   from the sunburnt plains
of far off north australia  
  came a fella born to ride
the wide  brown land  
  oh  he grew up running wild  
  but soon by all was styled  
  as the country s greatest
ever drovin  man  
  though his legend rode the winds
from broome to darwin  
  they loved and loathed him
right from end to end  
  for when the drover gave his heart  
  to a girl whose skin was dark  
  from that day on
he was no white man s friend  
  so goes the drover s story  
  you will hear it near and far  
  and in the end
it s all he ll ever own  
  it says the outcast is a free man  
  lfhe sleeps under the stars  
  makes the blanket
of the southern skies his home  
  but the drover is a man
of constant shadows  
  haunted by his pain
his past and name  
  for every mile he rides  
  what he cannot hide  
  is the longing in his heart  
  to love again  
  so goes the drover s story  
  you ll hear it near and far 
  and in the end
it s all he ll ever own  
  it says the outcast is a free man  
  if he sleeps under the stars  
  makes the blanket
