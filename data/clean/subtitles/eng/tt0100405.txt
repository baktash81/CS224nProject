they were really into american
heavy metal  mustangs  corvettes 
  ah 
  they bought  em cheap and fixed  em up  i paid attention

heavy metal    home 
millage ville  georgia

possibility things are gonna go wrong 
that s why i enjoy this so much 
oh  by the way  phil  about your car 
  oh  god  what 
  it corners like it s on rails

that mean  edward  edward 
hi 
well  good morning 
red

  no  there s no hurry 
are you hungry

why don t you sit
and have something to eat 
i  uh  took the liberty
of ordering everything on the menu 
i didn t know what you d like 
  thanks 
  all right  good 
  did you sleep well 
  yeah  too good 
  i forgot where i was 
  occupational hazard 
yeah  did you sleep 
uh  yes  a little 
on the couch 
i was  uh  working
last night 
you don t sleep 
you don t do drugs 
you don t drink 
you hardly eat 
what do you do  edward 
 cause i know you re not a lawyer 
that s right 
there are four
other chairs here 
oh 
  so what do you do 
  i buy companies 
what kind of companies 
uh  i buy companies that are
in financial difficulty 
if they have problems  you must
get  em for a bargain  huh 
well  the company
i m buying this week 
i m getting for the bargain
price of about one billion 
  a billion dollars 
  yes 
wow  you must be
really smart  huh 
i only got through
the eleventh grade 
how far did you go
in school 
i went all the way 
your folks must be
really proud  huh 
so you don t actually
have a billion dollars  huh 
no  i get some of it
from banks  investors 
it s not an easy thing to do 
  and you don t make anything and you don t build anything 
  no  no 
  so what do you do with the companies once you buy them 
  i sell them 
here  let me do that 
you sell them 
well  i    don t sell the whole company 
i break it up into pieces   
and then i sell that off 
it s worth more than the whole 
so it s sort of like  um  stealing cars
and selling  em for the parts  right

that you re a 
  relative

mr  lewis  my grandfather believes
the men who create a company   
  should control its destiny 
  where s the salad 
uh  the salad comes
at the end of the meal 
that s the fork i knew 
let me  uh  put it another way 
between your public statements and the
rumors flying around on this thing 
we find it very hard to figure out what
your real intentions are 
i don t know about you  but i ve never
been able to figure which goes with what 
you know  there was a time when
we built ships the size of cities 
  men like my grandfather made this country 
  who ordered this 
the gentleman did  ma am  bon appetite 
these are escargot  it s french
for snails  it s a delicacy 
try it  david 
mr  lewis  if you were to get control 
and i don t think you will  but if you did 
what do you plan to do
with the company 
break it up
and sell off the pieces 
i m sure you ll understand
i m not thrilled at the idea   
of your turning 40 years of my work
into your garage sale 
at the price i m paying for this stock  mr 
morse  you are going to be a very rich man 
i m rich enough  i just want
to head my shipyard 
slippery little suckers 
it happens all the time 
i met your father 
what s his name 
  carter 
  yeah  carter  carter lewis 
he s not quite the bastard
everybody says he is 
  no  i have the franchise on that 
  does that make him proud 
i doubt it  it doesn t
really matter now  he passed away 
oh  i hadn t heard 
i m sorry 
i m sorry too 
mr  morse  you asked for this meeting 
what can i do for you 
  leave my company alone 
  i can t do that  i own ten million shares 
  i ll buy your stock back 
  you don t have the money 
we will  we re getting a contract
to build ten destroyers 
there will be no contract  the contract
is now buried in appropriations committee 
  and it will remain there 
  and how the hell did you pull something like that 
you got dirty politicians in
your pockets now or something 
easy  easy 
calm down  calm down  david 
  mr  lewis plays hardball 
  yes  yes  i do 
i ve heard enough of this  vivian 
it was a great pleasure to meet you 
i m sorry  grandfather 
i ve gotta get some air  mr  lewis 
i d better join my grandson

vivian  i m serious 
come  i m not looking 
it s really high  look  no hands

the truth is  it really is totally
irrelevant whether i like this man or not 
i will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business 
i know 
kit s always saying to me 
 don t get emotional
when you turn tricks   
that s why no kissing 
it s too personal 
it s like what you re saying

i think i liked  fine  better 
you know what  just tell me one thing 
why did you make me get all dressed up 
well  for one thing 
the clothing was appropriate 
no  what i mean is  if you
were gonna tell everybody i m a hooker 
  why didn t you just let me wear my own
clothes  okay    i did not  i did not 
i mean  in my own clothes  when someone
like that guy stuckey comes up to me 
i can handle it 
i m prepared 
i m very sorry  i m not happy with
stuckey at all for saying or doing that 
but he is my attorney 
i ve known him for ten years 
he thought you were some kind of
industrial spy  the guy s paranoid 
are you my pimp now  you think you
can pass me around to your friends 
  i m not some little toy 
  look  i know you re not my toy  vivian 
vivian  i m speaking to you 
come back here 
i hate to point out the obvious 
but you are  in fact  a hooker 
  and you are my employee 
  look  you don t own me  i decide  okay 
i say who  i say when 
i  i say who 
i refuse to spend the next three days fighting
with you  i said i was sorry  i meant it 
that s the end of it 
i m sorry i ever met you 
i m sorry i ever
got into your stupid car 
as if you had so many more
appealing options 
i ve never had anyone
make me feel as cheap as you did today 
somehow  i find that
very hard to believe 
where are you going 
i want my money 
i want to get out of here 
come on 
i m sorry 
i wasn t prepared
to answer questions about us 
it was stupid and cruel 
i didn t mean it 
i don t want you to go 
  will you stay the week 
  why 
i saw you talking to david morse 
i didn t like it 
we were just talking 
i didn t like it 
down 
you hurt me 
yes 
don t do it again 
first guy i ever loved
was a total nothing 
second was worse 
my mom called me
a bum magnet 
if there was a bum within a 50 mile
radius  i was completely attracted to him 
that s how i ended up here 
i followed bum number three 
oh 
so here i was  no money 
no friends  no bum 
and you chose this as your profession 
i worked at a couple
fast food places 
parked cars at wrestling 
and i couldn t make the rent 
i was too ashamed to go home 
that s when i met kit 
she was a hooker
and made it sound so great 
so one day i did it 
i cried the whole time 
but then i got some regulars
and  you know 
it s not like anybody plans this 
it s not your childhood dream 
you could be
so much more 
people put you down enough 
you start to believe it 
i think you are a very bright 
very special woman 
the bad stuff
is easier to believe 
you ever notice that 
  tell him i ll call him on monday 
  yes  sir 
  where you going  did he sign these 
  no  he said he had to leave 
  edward  you can t disappear now  we re in this too deep 
  don t panic  philip 
morse isn t going anywhere 
i ll be back here in the morning 
  did you send the tickets to the hotel  thank you 
  yes  sir 
  where are you going 
  i have a date 
with the hooker 
be careful  philip 
  do i look okay 
  mmm 
  mmm 
  something s missing 
well  nothin  else is gonna fit
into this dress  i ll tell ya that 
well  maybe
something in this box 
i don t want you to get too excited 
this is only on loan 
oh 
they really let you borrow this
from the jewelry store 
i m a very good customer 
if you were gonna buy this 
how much would it cost 
quarter of a million 
a quarter
of a million dollars 
so  where we goin  
it s a surprise 
if i forget to tell you later 
i had a really good time tonight 
thank you 
when you re not fidgeting 
you look very beautiful   
and very tall 
  you re a dream
coming true  
  i can t believe how i have  
  fallen for you  
  you are the one  
  who s led me to the sun  
    how could i know  
  you don t want to go to san francisco in a limousine 
    i was lost without you  
  i ve never been on a plane before 
  and i want to tell you
