in financial difficulty
if they have problems you must
get em for a bargain huh

im buying this week
im getting for the bargain
price of about one billion
a billion dollars
yes
wow you must be
really smart huh
i only got through
the eleventh grade
how far did you go
in school
i went all the way
your folks must be
really proud huh
so you dont actually
have a billion dollars huh
no i get some of it
from banks investors

mr lewis my grandfather believes
the men who create a company
should control its destiny
wheres the salad
uh the salad comes
at the end of the meal
thats the fork i knew
let me uh put it another way
between your public statements and the
rumors flying around on this thing
we find it very hard to figure out what
your real intentions are
i dont know about you but ive never
been able to figure which goes with what
you know there was a time when
we built ships the size of cities
men like my grandfather made this country
who ordered this
the gentleman did maam bon appetite
these are escargot its french
for snails its a delicacy
try it david
mr lewis if you were to get control
and i dont think you will but if you did
what do you plan to do
with the company
break it up
and sell off the pieces
im sure youll understand
im not thrilled at the idea
of your turning 40 years of my work
into your garage sale
at the price im paying for this stock mr
morse you are going to be a very rich man
im rich enough i just want
to head my shipyard
slippery little suckers
it happens all the time
i met your father
whats his name
carter
yeah carter carter lewis
hes not quite the bastard
everybody says he is

does that make him proud
i doubt it it doesnt
really matter now he passed away
oh i hadnt heard
im sorry
im sorry too
mr morse you asked for this meeting
what can i do for you
leave my company alone
i cant do that i own ten million shares
ill buy your stock back
you dont have the money
we will were getting a contract
to build ten destroyers
there will be no contract the contract
is now buried in appropriations committee

and how the hell did you pull something like that
you got dirty politicians in
your pockets now or something
easy easy

mr lewis plays hardball

the truth is it really is totally
irrelevant whether i like this man or not
i will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business

its too personal
its like what youre saying

i followed bum number three
oh
so here i was no money
no friends no bum
and you chose this as your profession
i worked at a couple
fast food places
parked cars at wrestling
and i couldnt make the rent
i was too ashamed to go home
thats when i met kit
she was a hooker
and made it sound so great
so one day i did it
i cried the whole time
but then i got some regulars
and you know
its not like anybody plans this
its not your childhood dream
