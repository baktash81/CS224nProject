oliver didn t have the house yet

  mrs marshall  more wine 
  please 
  your crystal is lovely 
  thank you 
  lt s not waterford 
  baccarat 
then we are paying our associates too much 
actually  we got it quite reasonably 
lt s    lt s kind of an interesting story 
why don t you tell it  barb 
well    we were in paris   
lt was our fifth anniversary 
we d had lunch in this wonderful place in
the market district  called the pa day crishon 
  pied de cochon 
  thanks 
we were wandering around
and we came upon the   
rue de paradis 
where the baccarat
has its factory and museum 
l didn t know about this before l met oliver 
my mother bought her glasses at the a p 
you know  the kind with the raised flowers
that always chipped off after a few weeks 
they were always yellow  remember 
anyway  here we were in this immense room
filled with all that baccarat had ever made 
a field of crystal  lt was so    so pretty 
l mean  l felt   
whatever the word 
and suddenly  from the next room 
we heard the sound of glass breaking 
well  l looked at oliver and oliver
looked at me  and then    oh    no 
before that 
there was this big  black limousine 
now  this is important 
well  before the limousine   
to make a long story short  a couple
had ordered a design for their anniversary 
when it was ready 
they were getting a divorce 
the woman had smashed her half 
and l convinced the man to sell us
his half cheap  just to spite her 
and  uh    that s our baccarat story 
well  l think everybody
had a great time  don t you 
  to make a long story short  no 
  l m sorry  you were just rambling on   
tell your own story next time you care
so desperately what everybody thinks 
fuckface 
  they re my bosses 
  they re gavin s bosses  too 
lt didn t stop him from getting
a footjob at dinner 
gavin doesn t care about making partner 
he doesn t have a wife and kids  l do 
you wanna keep living in this apartment 
because you do not buy a house
on an associate s salary 
at least  not the kind of house that we want 
ok  l care what they think 
l care  all right  l care 
shoot me 
and that phoney laugh 
that was a genuine laugh 
all right  all right  maybe l overdid it 
l was just trying to keep things going 
god  l hope they didn t notice
what ajerk l am 
they never seem to 
  dear homeowner 
l love your house   
  lf you ever consider selling 
please    contact me   
  barbara rose   
mom  l m gonna be late for practice 
you ve been doing this for a year
and nobody s called 
this is a great house  l love this house 
lt s a waste oftime 
l bet l get this house  five bucks 
five bucks 
  hello 
  oh  l was just leaving a note 
how kind  please  won t you come in 
all right 
l don t believe we ve met 
  barbara rose 
  l m maureen 
l don t remember mother mentioning you 
but she had so many friends 
oh  oh  l m very sorry 
thank you  she went peacefully 
what am l going to do with this old place 
l just can t bear to put it up for sale and have
a bunch of strangers tromping through it 
lf l could just find someone
who would love it as much as mom did 
that s more important to me
than whatever money we get for it 
lf you know anybody
who might be interested   
  can we go up and pick our rooms 
  we can do whatever we want  lt s our house 
who gets first pick  as if l had to ask 
don t get scared  we ll do it together 
l just feel kind of strange 
l mean  this house is so beautiful
and we live here 
this is who we are  this is me 
  l ll be home early 
  where are you going 
to work  l wish l didn t have to 
but somebody s got to pay for all this 
  lt s saturday 
  come on  this is a great day 
you got the fun part 
kitchen first 
everything was working for the roses 
let me restate that 
the roses were working for everything 
over the next six years  oliver dug in 
made senior partner 
the kids lopped off 70  80 pounds 
and barbara laboured seven days a week
to create the perfect home
that oliver always dreamed of 
not easy for a girl who grew up
drinking her milk
from glasses with chipped  yellow flowers 
there were a million choices   
and she sweated every one of  em 
she refiinishedall the tables herself 
lt took sixmonths
to get the floors exactly right 
a hundred sundays to fiind the perfect
staffordshire fiigures andplates
that she put over the fiireplace 
when you work thathard on something 
eventually you have to fiinish
and face the awful question 
  what s left to do   
  are you working 
  yes  ls it important 
yes  kind of  l hope so 
stephanie mayes called to say
thank you for dinner the other night 
she said the pâté l made was so good
l should go into business 
so l asked her if she really meant it
and she said she did 
so l took a pound over to her
and collected  35 
l d almost forgotten
what it felt like to make money 
  you sold liver to our friends 
  she paid me in cash  oliver 
somehow that felt different from
the money l get cashing a cheque 
lt made me feel like   
trading in the volvo on one ofthose   
four wheel drive things with the big 
knobby tyres and the 200 horsepower engine 
so l did  l m gonna pick it up tomorrow 
thank you so much for telling me 
and you think that you    need this 
l mean  the volvo was a fine car 
  l ll pay for it with my own money 
  how much does it cost 
all right  l know it was kind of crazy
but l just    wanted it  ok 
25 000 
so you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pâté 
maybe l will  maybe l m starting a business 
  but ifyou don t want me to  uh   
  no  no  no  no  no  you do it 
do it  do it 
l m doing it 
wait a minute  wait one minute 
l do not understand  what s the  uh   
what s the attitude 
l told you l would handle it 
yeah  and l didn t see anything happening
so l went to ed and l set up the interview 
  l would have done it 
  yeah  but sometimes you need a little push 
we all need a little push 
we agreed that 
if you re doing this liver bit 
we would need someone
to take care ofthe house  right 
right  oliver  right again 
oh  come on  let s not argue  ok 
just think about it for a minute 
lf you don t want to interview the lady 
l will send her home 
l m only trying to make your life easier 
somehow the thought of a stranger living
in my house just seems weird  you know 
doesn t it  l don t mean just for us 
but for you  too 
  oh  but then l guess you do this all the time 
  no  no 
l try this as a means offinding
room and board and a little money 
l m also attending a few classes
at william and mary college 
but that won t interfere with my duties 
that s great  l m happy for you   really 
  so  do l get the job 
  the fact is  susan  l don t need a live in 
this was my husband s suggestion 
l have raised two kids on my own
and now they re about to go offto college 
  they were both accepted at harvard 
  that s a nice school  too 
thanks 
so  anyway  it ll just be
oliver and me here at home 
although l am getting going
my own catering business 
but let s face it 
l don t need to work for the money 
and that does not make me one ofthese
women who is married to a successful man
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children 
and then has to validate herself as a human
being  because her children are leaving her 
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery
or going into interior design
in her husband s office  no 
l have a wonderful house 
crammed with beautiful things 
l did this house myself  l did a greatjob 
not that l am necessarily
a slave to materialism  no 
but l am proud ofwhat l have accomplished 
although l suppose some people find my life
disgusting  disgusting is too strong a word 
no  l would not say that many people
would respectthe choices l have made 
although women would  women like me 
but then l don t care what they think
because l can t stand who they are 
what l m trying to say  susan 
is that l don t need a live in 
well    thanks for the interview
and good luck  and god bless you 
l would like you to understand
that  if l were to hire you 
my life would probably change 
you would be this new element in the house 
well   
let me show you where your room is 
hey  bennie  dumb dog 
hey  bennie

l m gonna meet him
at his club in philadelphia 
he s mine 
look how crazy you are

your nerve endings get irritated  you know

could you get this hiatal hernia  say 
by being squeezed
between someone s legs

thank you  gavin 
  salud 
  salud 
all those lives going on out there   
people we ll never meet   
experiencing things we ll never know 
we can t know 
ln your own life  by this point 
you think you know what s gonna be but   
  but you don t know 
  you don t know 
lt s always just when you think
you got it figured out
when  bingo  something comes along
and knocks you right on your ass 
why do you think barbara
didn t come to the hospital 
l don t know 
she probably had a good reason 
hiya  bennie  come here  sweetheart 
where is everybody  huh 
l guess you re the only one who
gives a damn about me in this family 
oliver 
you don t know how happy l am to see you 
  you didn t come to the hospital 
  no 
no  well  l called and   
well  everything seemed to be   
under control 
l just    l didn t want to disturb you 
disturb me 
well  l wasn t doing much  just dying 
oliver  you weren t dying 
  you didn t even call 
  of course l did  l talked to someone 
  not to me 
  well  l talked to a nurse and   
she said that you weren t dying 
well  l thought l was dying 
l wrote you a note   
in case you didn t get there in time 
l can t read your handwriting 
l was on a gurney being rushed
to lntensive care in excruciating pain 
lt says 
  my love  by the time you
receive this  l may be gone   
  my life was    fun   
  full    beyond my dreams   
  all l have    and all l am  l owe to you   
  you gave me courage
to surpass what l know l am 
the strength to     
oh  this is where l had a spasm 
l can t read it  but the next line says 
  l lie here  feeling my life ebb away   
  l cling to your image   
  l will take you with me to eternity   
  l cherish you   
  l thank merciful god for you   
l didn t have the strength to sign it 
l m    l m sure they  um   
they would ve told me who it was from 
l can t believe
you didn t call us at school  mother 
l didn t see any point in alarming you until
there was something to be alarmed about 
your mother didn t want
to disturb anybody today 
yeah  well  you still should have called 
you should have 
l m sure your mother didn t want
to worry you needlessly 
the important thing is your father is alive 
we ve always been a family
that communicated 
lf anything important happens 
everyone should know about it 
that s the rule 
  what s going on 
  l m very upset 
lt s 3 o clock in the morning 
turn the television off 
l wasn t sure why l didn t go to the hospital 
but now l think l know 
l d just like to put today behind us  ok 
ok 
l was gonna drive to the hospital 
but l knew you were ok 
cos l never think that anything really terrible
could happen to me or the kids or you 
and l was getting on the expressway 
and suddenly l had this very strong
feeling that you were dead 
and l knew what it would feel like
to be alone in this house 
to not have you in my life 
and l got so scared  l had to pull over 
well  you don t have to be scared any more 
l got scared because l felt happy 
you were happy because l was dead 
l was happy to be free 
like a weight had been lifted 
  like a weight had been lifted 
  yeah 
so  how am l supposed to respond 
you tell me you wished l was dead  
l thought it was important 
l think you owe me an apology  barbara 
lf you have something to say 
l d like to hear it 
l want a divorce 
no  you don t 
you can t have one 
l ve thought about this a lot 
l really don t want to be
married to you any more 
why do you want a divorce 
did    did l do something 
did l    did l notdo something 
l can t give you specifics  oliver 
  well  try 
  l don t want to try 
ls there somebody else  another man 
no 
  a woman 
  you wish 
l should be the one asking for a divorce 
l was rushed to hospital
suffering from severe   
lndigestion 
oh  you re such an expert
at making me look like ajerk 
ok  ok  ok  l m sorry 
l m the bad person 
let s just blame me for this 
no  no  l think l need   
l think you owe me 
after this many pretty goddamn good
years of marriage  a solid reason 
l worked my ass offto make enough money
to provide you with a good life 
and you owe me a reason that makes sense 
so let s hear it 
come on  let s hear it  let s hear it 
because   
when l watch you eat 
when l see you asleep 
when l look at you lately 
l just wanna smash your face in 
come on  smash my face 
come on  you wanna smash my face 
the next time    l hit back 
and you d better get yourself
a damn good lawyer 
the best your money can buy 
  what does she want 
  child support 
l ve always taken care of my kids 
and they will be 18 in one year 
which makes it nice for you 
  what about alimony 
  barbara  against my advice  waives alimony 
l m making money with my business 
l get a lot of referrals  l can support myself 
well  l m a lucky guy 
my client is being more than fair  mr rose 
she s waived alimony and she s willing to
waive her rights against your law practice
in exchange for the house and all of
its contents  except your shaving gear and   
his clothing 
  everything l made went into that house 
  l found that house 
every piece offurniture is where it is
because l put it there  lt is my house 
lf your client has finished yammering 
explain to her
that a wife does not
automatically get the house 
l thought you told her that
she was entitled to anything and everything 
  l told her what 
  yes   
here it is 
l quote    my love 
by the time you     
boy  what a handwriting 
  by the time you receive this  l may be gone   
  all l am and all l have  l owe to you   
you wrote this  mr rose 
excuse me  mr thurmont  you tiny 
little  worm like  infinitesimal prick 
could l have a word with my wife  please 
certainly 
lf this is a who can sink lowest fastest
contest  you won 
by showing him my letter 
you have sunk below the deepest layer
of prehistoric frog shit
at the bottom of a new jersey scum swamp 
l may have let you have the house 
but now   
you ll never get it 
you will never get that house 
do you understand 
you will never get that house 
  we ll see 
  yeah    we ll see 
maybe l shouldn t have
let you see that letter 
dear girl  by the time this is all over 
you ll think oftoday
as one ofyour lighter moments 
what do you call 500 lawyers
at the bottom ofthe ocean 
an excellent start 
l used to resentjokes like that 
now l see them as simple truths 
lawyers   
hello 
honey  l can t talk right now 
l m with a client 
love you  miss you  want you    bye 
l recently married 
which is the last thing l ever thought
l d do after what happened to the roses 
when it comes to women   
l hope l m a better man now than l was 
l know l m a better lawyer 
when it comes to divorce 
l ll never make another mistake
like l made with oliver 
let s just concentrate on the job at hand 
she wants the house  you want the house 
  l m the one who s living in a hotel room 
  not for long 
  she claims she found the house 
  she did find it  right 
yeah  but that s not the point  she says
she made it what it is  she didn t  she didn t 
l m not keeping score but  if l were 
it d be about 83 to 6 in my favour 
of all the really    good stuff 
those wonderful staffordshire dogs   
ln fact  most ofthe staffordshires  l found 
and that art deco rug and  uh   
and that stove in the kitchen  she wouldn t
have bought it if l hadn t pushed her 
shoes  that s what she s good at buying 
l gotta have shelves in the closet
or she d have them all over the place 
here we go  you re gonna love this 
civil code  title 16 9 0 4  section c 
l used this once for a freebie divorce
l did for my cousin paulie  total loser 
read 
  for the purposes of subsections
one and two of paragraphs     
here  skip down to   
  parties who have pursued separate lives     
  parties who have pursued separate
lives sharing neither bed nor board
shall be deemed to have lived apart
even though they reside
under the same roof     
even though they reside
under the same roof 
yeah  the law was put on the books
for poor people 
folks who couldn t afford
separate residences  but we can use it 
  so l can move back in 
  lfyour divorce is settled in court 
it shows you re committed to the property 
plus  you can see she doesn t sell the assets 
l can work on her 
get her to fold on the house 
no  no  oliver  you don t even
deal with her  you avoid her 
women can be a lot meaner than we think 
never underestimate her as an adversary 
don t talk to her 
no  no  no  l won t  don t worry about me 
gavin   
  thank you 
  all right 
all right  go on  go home 
  this is the stupidest thing you ve ever done 
  second stupidest 
  you can t stay here 
  the law says l can 
title 16 9 0 4  section c 
look it up  tootsie pie 
ok  mom  you re on 
let me see that bag 
ls that what you re gonna put on top 
  yes  it is 
  fine 
josh  plug it in  please 
  lt s a short 
  lt s not a short 
one ofthe ornaments
is touching the sockets 
fine 
you take care of it  oliver 
come on  it s christmas time 
let s get festive 
  l have to go out 
  l got stuff l gotta do in my room 
  oh  god  my house is on fire 
  mine too  babe 
really  you idiot 
wait up  babe 
oh  my god 
omar  do something 
  fire 
  mom 
fire  fire 
call the police  l ll get the extinguisher 
991  999  911 
  stay out ofthe way 
  coming through 
  one  store in a cool place 
two  hold upright  pull pin out    ok 
    three  stand back  aim away from face   
  do it 
  dad  hurry 
  all right  ok  ok  all right  ok  ok 
dad  the curtain 
lt s over  thank god l was here 
the whole house could have gone up 
ok  ok  l ll get a sponge
and start cleaning up 
maybe a rake    or a bulldozer 
lt might not have been the lights 
you always know 
rather than argue about who supposedly
did what  l d like to reach some accord 
  time is passing 
  l d love to be done with this  too 
right  lfwe leave settlement to the court 
the lawyers get everything 
so l ve come up with a fair solution 
  you wanna hear it 
  yes 
now  l understand your point of view 
you ve invested 18 years in this marriage 
that s worth a lot 
a tremendous amount   163 800 
  how did you arrive at that number 
  fairly 
  you do almost the same things as susan 
  no  she s in college  she should make more 
barbara 
there is no comparison whatsoever
between what she does and   
her salary is a base  so l doubled it 
and that wasn t enough 
and then l tripled it 
and that s how l came up with this figure 
 490 633  approximately 
l shall give you that in cash  lt won t be easy 
lt ll be harder than hell 
but l m gonna do it 
you just have to  you know 
agree to give up the house 
you owe me  you ve gotten more out of
knowing me than l ve got out of knowing you 
l m not even gonna ask you what that means 
l found this house  l bought everything in it 
with my money  lt s a lot easier to spend it
than it is to make it  honeybun 
you might not have made it
if not for me  sweet cakes 
you weren t even multiorgasmic
before you met me 
you expect me to keep
reassuring you sexually 
even now when we disgust each other  
don t let this bother you 
lt s all gonna work out 
the red areas are hers 
the yellow areas are mine 
green is neutral 
the kitchen was difficult  but barbara
came up with the idea oftime allotment 
this seems rational to you both 
yeah 
oliver  my father used to say
that a man could never outdo a woman
when it came to love or revenge 
why don t you let her have the house 
there are other houses  and other women 
no  no  no  l m going to win because
l ve got her to accept the ground rules 
oliver  there is no winning in this 
lt s only degrees of losing 
l got more square footage 
sorry to disturb you  but l was wondering
if l could borrow a sleeping tablet 
  did oliver send you for it 
  no  actually  no 
all right  you got me there 
which is good  because l m
uncomfortable with the charade 
lt s nice to see somebody still
caring for somebody in this house 
  good night  susan 
  so  there will be no pills 
oh  kitty  kitty  wait 
kitty  kitty   
do you want me to call around
to find an open drugstore 
l ll find one 
  should l come 
  lt s up to you 
  these are my favourite kind of cars 
  lt s a morgan 
of course 
lt s cosy 
  what was that 
  a bump of some sort 
oh  kitty  oh  mein gott 
look  why don t you go into the house
and find a large ziploc bag 
  ziploc

that supposed to scare me 
lf you re looking for trouble 
barbara  you found it

you killed my cat  you re making me nuts 
will you please     l m asking you to leave

  mrs rose 
l didn t think l should leave her in reception 
what with all the    you know 
yeah  l know    yeah  l know 
barbara 
you really shouldn t be here because
it might be viewed by some as unethical 
well  l am here    ethical or not 
you don t mind if l tape this
just so no one gets confused
about what was said 
what s on your mind 
well  since you re the one who
advised oliver to move back in 
l thought you would
advise him to move out 
why  sounds like you two
have things worked out 
with the red areas and the green areas 
gavin  ever since this thing started 
l ve had trouble sleeping 
most mornings l wake up sobbing 
l m sorry  that s shitty 
but this morning    l woke up screaming 
and l couldn t stop 
l need this to end  this has to end 
  l suggested selling the house   
  no 
ok  you both seem to agree on that 
gavin 
l don t have much money 
but l could pay you 
that d be illegal 
besides money 
what would it take to get you
to help me  gavin 
put your shoes on  barbara 
l haven t been into feet since  82 
  have you ever made angry love 
  ls there any other way 
stop it 
this is ridiculous  button up 
you wanna settle this  let s all sit down
and work it out  find some compromise 
  there is no compromise 
  then l can t help you 
worth a shot 
you know where l am
if you change your mind 
sometimes l wonder what might have
happened    if l d taken her offer 
but l didn t 
l should have seen her toes
in the pit of my crotch as a cry for help 
  stinking bitch 
  dumb bastard 
  slut 
  scum 
  filth 
  faggot

  yes  l do love you 
and about drugs   don t do  em  and sex

each ofthem can hold    at least 200 pounds 
we re coming 
mein gott  they are dead 
some story  huh 
what s the moral 
other than dog people should marry
dog people and cat people  cat people 
l don t know 
lt could be just this 
a civilised divorce
is a contradiction in terms 
maybe because ofwhat happened 
l ve become too traditional 
maybe it s not natural to stay
married to one person for life 
my parents did it 
63 years 
a few of  em good 
so  look  here it is 
we can begin 
when it comes to your wife 
l m going to urge you to be generous
to the point of night sweats 
the all important thing is to get you through
this as quickly and cleanly as possible
so that you can begin rebuilding your life 
ok 
or   
you can get up
and go home 
and try to find some shred
of what you once loved about
