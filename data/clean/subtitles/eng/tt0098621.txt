mrs marshall more wine
please
your crystal is lovely
thank you
lts not waterford
baccarat
then we are paying our associates too much
actually we got it quite reasonably
lts lts kind of an interesting story
why dont you tell it barb
well we were in paris
lt was our fifth anniversary
wed had lunch in this wonderful place in
the market district called the paday crishon
pied de cochon
thanks
we were wandering around
and we came upon the
rue de paradis
where the baccarat
has its factory and museum
l didnt know about this before l met oliver
my mother bought her glasses at the ap
you know the kind with the raised flowers
that always chipped off after a few weeks
they were always yellow remember
anyway here we were in this immense room
filled with all that baccarat had ever made
a field of crystal lt was so so pretty
l mean l felt
whatever the word
and suddenly from the next room
we heard the sound of glass breaking
well l looked at oliver and oliver
looked at me and then oh no
before that
there was this big black limousine
now this is important
well before the limousine
to make a long story short a couple
had ordered a design for their anniversary
when it was ready
they were getting a divorce
the woman had smashed her half
and l convinced the man to sell us
his half cheap just to spite her
and uh thats our baccarat story
well l think everybody
had a great time dont you
to make a long story short no
lm sorry you were just rambling on
tell your own story next time you care
so desperately what everybody thinks
fuckface
theyre my bosses
theyre gavins bosses too
lt didnt stop him from getting
a footjob at dinner
gavin doesnt care about making partner
he doesnt have a wife and kids l do
you wanna keep living in this apartment
because you do not buy a house
on an associates salary
at least not the kind of house that we want
ok l care what they think
l care all right l care
shoot me
and that phoney laugh
that was a genuine laugh
all right all right maybe l overdid it
l was just trying to keep things going
god l hope they didnt notice
what ajerk l am
they never seem to
dear homeowner
l love your house
lf you ever consider selling
please contact me
barbara rose
mom lm gonna be late for practice
youve been doing this for a year
and nobodys called
this is a great house l love this house
lts a waste oftime
l bet l get this house five bucks
five bucks
hello
oh l was just leaving a note
how kind please wont you come in
all right
l dont believe weve met
barbara rose
lm maureen
l dont remember mother mentioning you
but she had so many friends
oh oh lm very sorry
thank you she went peacefully
what am l going to do with this old place
l just cant bear to put it up for sale and have
a bunch of strangers tromping through it
lf l could just find someone
who would love it as much as mom did
thats more important to me
than whatever money we get for it
lf you know anybody
who might be interested
can we go up and pick our rooms
we can do whatever we want lts our house
who gets first pick as if l had to ask
dont get scared well do it together
l just feel kind of strange
l mean this house is so beautiful
and we live here
this is who we are this is me
lll be home early
where are you going
to work l wish l didnt have to
but somebodys got to pay for all this
lts saturday
come on this is a great day
you got the fun part
kitchen first
everything was working for the roses
let me restate that
the roses were working for everything
over the next six years oliver dug in
made senior partner
the kids lopped off 70 80 pounds
and barbara laboured seven days a week
to create the perfect home
that oliver always dreamed of
not easy for a girl who grew up
drinking her milk
from glasses with chipped yellow flowers
there were a million choices
and she sweated every one of em
she refiinishedall the tables herself
lt took sixmonths
to get the floors exactly right
a hundred sundays to fiind the perfect
staffordshire fiigures andplates
that she put over the fiireplace
when you work thathard on something
eventually you have to fiinish
and face the awful question
whats left to do
are you working
yes ls it important
yes kind of l hope so
stephanie mayes called to say
thank you for dinner the other night
she said the pâté l made was so good
l should go into business
so l asked her if she really meant it
and she said she did
so l took a pound over to her
and collected 35
ld almost forgotten
what it felt like to make money
you sold liver to our friends
she paid me in cash oliver
somehow that felt different from
the money l get cashing a cheque
lt made me feel like
trading in the volvo on one ofthose
fourwheel drive things with the big
knobby tyres and the 200horsepower engine
so l did lm gonna pick it up tomorrow
thank you so much for telling me
and you think that you need this
l mean the volvo was a fine car
lll pay for it with my own money
how much does it cost
all right l know it was kind of crazy
but l just wanted it ok
so you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pâté
maybe l will maybe lm starting a business
but ifyou dont want me to uh
no no no no no you do it
do it do it
lm doing it
wait a minute wait one minute
l do not understand whats the uh
whats the attitude
l told you l would handle it
yeah and l didnt see anything happening
so l went to ed and l set up the interview
l would have done it
yeah but sometimes you need a little push
we all need a little push
we agreed that
if youre doing this liver bit
we would need someone
to take care ofthe house right
right oliver right again
oh come on lets not argue ok
just think about it for a minute
lf you dont want to interview the lady
l will send her home
lm only trying to make your life easier
somehow the thought of a stranger living
in my house just seems weird you know
doesnt it l dont mean just for us
but for you too
oh but then l guess you do this all the time
no no
l try this as a means offinding
room and board and a little money
lm also attending a few classes
at william and mary college
but that wont interfere with my duties
thats great lm happy for you  really
so do l get the job
the fact is susan l dont need a livein
this was my husbands suggestion
l have raised two kids on my own
and now theyre about to go offto college
they were both accepted at harvard
thats a nice school too
thanks
so anyway itll just be
oliver and me here at home
although l am getting going
my own catering business
but lets face it
l dont need to work for the money
and that does not make me one ofthese
women who is married to a successful man
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children
and then has to validate herself as a human
being because her children are leaving her
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery
or going into interior design
in her husbands office no
l have a wonderful house
crammed with beautiful things
l did this house myself l did a greatjob
not that l am necessarily
a slave to materialism no
but l am proud ofwhat l have accomplished
although l suppose some people find my life
disgusting disgusting is too strong a word
no l would not say that many people
would respectthe choices l have made
although women would women like me
but then l dont care what they think
because l cant stand who they are
what lm trying to say susan
is that l dont need a livein
well thanks for the interview
and good luck and god bless you
l would like you to understand
that if l were to hire you
my life would probably change
you would be this new element in the house
well

ln your own life by this point
you think you know whats gonna be but
but you dont know
you dont know
lts always just when you think
you got it figured out
when bingo something comes along
and knocks you right on your ass
why do you think barbara
didnt come to the hospital
l dont know
she probably had a good reason
hiya bennie come here sweetheart
where is everybody huh
l guess youre the only one who
gives a damn about me in this family
oliver
you dont know how happy l am to see you
you didnt come to the hospital
no
no well l called and
well everything seemed to be
under control
l just l didnt want to disturb you
disturb me
well l wasnt doing much just dying
oliver you werent dying
you didnt even call
of course l did l talked to someone
not to me
well l talked to a nurse and
she said that you werent dying
well l thought l was dying
l wrote you a note
in case you didnt get there in time
l cant read your handwriting
l was on a gurney being rushed
to lntensive care in excruciating pain
lt says
my love by the time you
receive this l may be gone
my life was fun
full beyond my dreams
all l have and all l am l owe to you
you gave me courage
to surpass what l know l am
the strength to
oh this is where l had a spasm
l cant read it but the next line says
l lie here feeling my life ebb away
l cling to your image
l will take you with me to eternity
l cherish you
l thank merciful god for you
l didnt have the strength to sign it
lm lm sure they um
they wouldve told me who it was from
l cant believe
you didnt call us at school mother
l didnt see any point in alarming you until
there was something to be alarmed about
your mother didnt want
to disturb anybody today
yeah well you still should have called
you should have
lm sure your mother didnt want
to worry you needlessly
the important thing is your father is alive
weve always been a family
that communicated
lf anything important happens
everyone should know about it
thats the rule
whats going on
lm very upset
lts 3 oclock in the morning
turn the television off
l wasnt sure why l didnt go to the hospital
but now l think l know
ld just like to put today behind us ok
ok
l was gonna drive to the hospital
but l knew you were ok
cos l never think that anything really terrible
could happen to me or the kids or you
and l was getting on the expressway
and suddenly l had this very strong
feeling that you were dead
and l knew what it would feel like
to be alone in this house
to not have you in my life
and l got so scared l had to pull over
well you dont have to be scared any more
l got scared because l felt happy
you were happy because l was dead
l was happy to be free
like a weight had been lifted
like a weight had been lifted
yeah
so how am l supposed to respond
you tell me you wished l was dead
l thought it was important
l think you owe me an apology barbara
lf you have something to say
ld like to hear it
l want a divorce
no you dont
you cant have one
lve thought about this a lot
l really dont want to be
married to you any more
why do you want a divorce
did did l do something
did l did l notdo something
l cant give you specifics oliver
well try
l dont want to try
ls there somebody else another man
no
a woman
you wish
l should be the one asking for a divorce
l was rushed to hospital
suffering from severe
lndigestion
oh youre such an expert
at making me look like ajerk
ok ok ok lm sorry
lm the bad person
lets just blame me for this
no no l think l need
l think you owe me
after this many pretty goddamn good
years of marriage a solid reason
l worked my ass offto make enough money
to provide you with a good life
and you owe me a reason that makes sense
so lets hear it
come on lets hear it lets hear it
because
when l watch you eat
when l see you asleep
when l look at you lately
l just wanna smash your face in
come on smash my face
come on you wanna smash my face
the next time l hit back
and youd better get yourself
a damn good lawyer
the best your money can buy
what does she want
child support
lve always taken care of my kids
and they will be 18 in one year
which makes it nice for you
what about alimony
barbara against my advice waives alimony
lm making money with my business
l get a lot of referrals l can support myself
well lm a lucky guy
my client is being more than fair mr rose
shes waived alimony and shes willing to
waive her rights against your law practice
in exchange for the house and all of
its contents except your shaving gear and
his clothing
everything l made went into that house
l found that house
every piece offurniture is where it is
because l put it there lt is my house
lf your client has finished yammering
explain to her
that a wife does not
automatically get the house
l thought you told her that
she was entitled to anything and everything
l told her what
yes
here it is
l quote my love
by the time you
boy what a handwriting
by the time you receive this l may be gone
all l am and all l have l owe to you
you wrote this mr rose
excuse me mr thurmont you tiny
little wormlike infinitesimal prick
could l have a word with my wife please
certainly
lf this is a whocansinklowestfastest
contest you won
by showing him my letter
you have sunk below the deepest layer
of prehistoric frog shit
at the bottom of a new jersey scum swamp
l may have let you have the house
but now
youll never get it
you will never get that house
do you understand
you will never get that house
well see
yeah well see
maybe l shouldnt have
let you see that letter
dear girl by the time this is all over
youll think oftoday
as one ofyour lighter moments
what do you call 500 lawyers
at the bottom ofthe ocean
an excellent start
l used to resentjokes like that
now l see them as simple truths
lawyers
hello
honey l cant talk right now
lm with a client
love you miss you want you bye
l recently married
which is the last thing l ever thought
ld do after what happened to the roses
when it comes to women
l hope lm a better man now than l was
l know lm a better lawyer
when it comes to divorce
lll never make another mistake
like l made with oliver
lets just concentrate on the job at hand
she wants the house you want the house
lm the one whos living in a hotel room
not for long
she claims she found the house
she did find it right
yeah but thats not the point she says
she made it what it is she didnt she didnt
lm not keeping score but if l were
itd be about 83 to 6 in my favour
of all the really good stuff
those wonderful staffordshire dogs
ln fact most ofthe staffordshires l found
and that artdeco rug and uh
and that stove in the kitchen she wouldnt
have bought it if l hadnt pushed her
shoes thats what shes good at buying
l gotta have shelves in the closet
or shed have them all over the place
here we go youre gonna love this
civil code title 16904 section c
l used this once for a freebie divorce
l did for my cousin paulie total loser
read
for the purposes of subsections
one and two of paragraphs
here skip down to
parties who have pursued separate lives
parties who have pursued separate
lives sharing neither bed nor board
shall be deemed to have lived apart
even though they reside
under the same roof
even though they reside
under the same roof
yeah the law was put on the books
for poor people
folks who couldnt afford
separate residences but we can use it
so l can move back in
lfyour divorce is settled in court
it shows youre committed to the property
plus you can see she doesnt sell the assets
l can work on her
get her to fold on the house
no no oliver you dont even
deal with her you avoid her
women can be a lot meaner than we think
never underestimate her as an adversary
dont talk to her
no no no l wont dont worry about me
gavin
thank you
all right
all right go on go home
this is the stupidest thing youve ever done
second stupidest
you cant stay here
the law says l can
title 16904 section c
look it up tootsie pie
ok mom youre on
let me see that bag
ls that what youre gonna put on top
yes it is
fine
josh plug it in please
lts a short
lts not a short
one ofthe ornaments

you take care of it oliver
come on its christmas time
lets get festive
l have to go out

dad the curtain
lts over thank god l was here
the whole house could have gone up
ok ok lll get a sponge
and start cleaning up
maybe a rake or a bulldozer
lt might not have been the lights
you always know
rather than argue about who supposedly
did what ld like to reach some accord
time is passing
ld love to be done with this too
right lfwe leave settlement to the court
the lawyers get everything
so lve come up with a fair solution
you wanna hear it
yes
now l understand your point of view
youve invested 18 years in this marriage
thats worth a lot
a tremendous amount 163800
how did you arrive at that number
fairly
you do almost the same things as susan
no shes in college she should make more
barbara
there is no comparison whatsoever
between what she does and
her salary is a base so l doubled it
and that wasnt enough
and then l tripled it
and thats how l came up with this figure
490633 approximately
l shall give you that in cash lt wont be easy
ltll be harder than hell
but lm gonna do it
you just have to you know
agree to give up the house
you owe me youve gotten more out of
knowing me than lve got out of knowing you
lm not even gonna ask you what that means
l found this house l bought everything in it

reassuring you sexually
even now when we disgust each other

green is neutral
the kitchen was difficult but barbara
came up with the idea oftime allotment
this seems rational to you both

oliver my father used to say
that a man could never outdo a woman
when it came to love or revenge
why dont you let her have the house
there are other houses and other women
no no no lm going to win because
lve got her to accept the ground rules
oliver there is no winning in this
lts only degrees of losing
l got more square footage
sorry to disturb you but l was wondering
if l could borrow a sleeping tablet

uncomfortable with the charade

no divorce lawyer can doubt that
we can nail her shes having
a blacktie dinner at 8 oclock tonight
the food critic from the post
called to confirm the time
she sent me this phoney
exterminators notice
saying the house is being gassed
for termites so ld stay away
she can have dinner parties
she lied about the exterminator
she can lie
she took two of my staffordshire figures
any dealer would give you
at least 1000 for them
she is financing her dinner with my things
l want to file criminal charges
and l want her thrown in jail
unless you have proof there arent grounds
wait a minute whose side are you on
did she get to you
did you bang her

some story huh
whats the moral
other than dog people should marry
dog people and cat people cat people
l dont know
lt could be just this
a civilised divorce
is a contradiction in terms
maybe because ofwhat happened
lve become too traditional
maybe its not natural to stay
married to one person for life
my parents did it
63 years
a few of em good
so look here it is
we can begin
when it comes to your wife
lm going to urge you to be generous
to the point of night sweats
the allimportant thing is to get you through
this as quickly and cleanly as possible
so that you can begin rebuilding your life
ok
or
you can get up
and go home
and try to find some shred
of what you once loved about
