ladies and gentlemen
a most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words
please welcome senator pat geary
of the state of nevada
and there is mrs geary
thank you very much
this is a very very happy day
for me and my wife mrs geary
we see nevada far too seldom
but today we can join with
old friends we can make new friends
and we help celebrate
a young mans first communion
and also to thank that boys family
for a magnificent contribution
to the state
i have here in my hand a check
made out to the university
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of
anthony vito corleone
the check is signed by
that young mans parents
whom i think we should recognize
mike pat kay stand up please
let the folks see you
folks i want you to join me
in giving a real nevada thank you
to mr and mrs michael corleone
we also have as a special added
attraction the sierra boys choir
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement
to honor their host
mr michael corleone
boys
the plaque
okay fellows did you get that one
okay thats good
now senator
just you and mrs corleone
my lawyer tom hagen senator geary
he arranged everything
through your man turnbull
yes yes
sit down
i thought that you and i
would talk alone
i trust these men
with my life senator
to ask them to leave
would be an insult
well its perfectly all right with me
but i am a blunt man and i intend
to speak very frankly to you
maybe more frankly
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before
the corleone family
has done well in nevada
you own or control
two major hotels in vegas
and one in reno
the licenses were grandfathered in
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission
now my sources tell me
that you plan to make a move
against the tropigala
they tell me that within a week
youre going to move klingman out
quite an expansion
however it will leave you
with a little technical problem
the license will still be
in klingmans name
turnbull is a good man
yeah well lets cut out
the bullshit
i dont want to spend
more time here than i have to
you can have the license
the price is 250000 dollars
plus 50 of the gross monthly
of all four hotels mr corleone
the price for the license
is less than 20000 dollars right
thats right
why would i pay more than that
because i intend to squeeze you
i dont like your kind of people
i dont like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair
dressed up in those silk suits
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent americans
ill do business with you
but the fact is
that i despise your masquerade
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family
senator
were both part of the same hypocrisy
but never think
it applies to my family
all right all right
some people have to play little games
you play yours
lets say that youll pay me
because its in your interest
i want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow one more thing
dont you contact me again ever
from now on you deal with turnbull
open that door son
senator you can have my answer now
if you like
my offer is this
nothing
not even the fee
for the gaming license
which i would like you to put up
good afternoon gentlemen

clemenza promised the rosato brothers
three territories after he died
you took over

clemenza promised them lu cazzo
he promised them nothing
he hated them more than i do
frankie they feel cheated
youre sitting up
in the sierra mountains
and youre drinking
whats he drinking
champagne
champagne cocktails and passing
judgment on how i run my family
your familys still called corleone
and youll run it like a corleone
my family doesnt eat here
doesnt eat in las vegas
and doesnt eat in miami
with hyman roth
youre a good old man and i like you
you were loyal to my father for years
the rosato brothers
are taking hostages
they spit right in my face
all because theyre backed up
by that jew in miami
i know thats why
i dont want them touched
not touched
no i want you to be fair with them
you want me to be fair with them
how can you be fair to animals
tom listen they recruit spics
they recruit niggers
they do violence
in their grandmothers neighborhoods
and everything with them is whores
and junk dope
and they leave the gambling to last
i want to run my family without you
on my back i want those rosatos dead
no
morte
i have business thats important with
hyman roth i dont want it disturbed
then you give your loyalty to a jew
before your own blood
you know my father did business
with hyman roth he respected him
your father did business with
hyman roth he respected hyman roth
but he never trusted hyman roth
or his sicilian messenger boy
johnny ola
youll have to excuse me im tired

i want everybody here to know theres
not going to be no trouble from me
don corleone
cicci the door

ive already made my plans
the old man had too much wine
its late
hows the baby
sleeping inside me
does it feel like a boy
yes it does michael
kay
im sorry about all the people today
bad timing
it couldnt be helped though
it made me think
of what you once told me
in five years the corleone family
will be completely legitimate
that was seven years ago
i know im trying darling
did you see this
why are the drapes open
kay are you all right
are you hit
no
its all right
stop stop
halt
theyre still on the property
please stay inside
keep them alive
well try
alive
stay by the door
yeah come in
mike are you all right
yeah
theres a lot i cant tell you tom
and i know
thats upset you in the past
you felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence
but its because i admire you
and love you
that i kept things secret from you
now youre the only one i can trust
fredo
well hes got a good heart
but hes weak and hes stupid
and this is life and death
tom youre my brother
i always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you mikey
a real brother

if what i think has happened
has happened
im leaving here tonight
i give you complete power over fredo
and his men rocco neri everyone
im trusting you
with the lives of my wife
and my children
the future of this family
if we catch them will we find out
we wont catch them
unless im very wrong
theyre dead already
they were killed by somebody
close to us
inside very very frightened
that they botched it
you dont think that rocco and neri
had something to do with this
see all our people are businessmen
their loyalty is based on that
one thing i learnt from pop
was to try to think
as people around you think
on that basis anything is possible
mike theyre dead

i want to get out of here
theyre lying there dead
over here theres two of them
looks like they were hired
out of new york

in my home
i want you to help me take my revenge
michael anything what can i do

i dont have your brain for big deals

it was hyman roth
that tried to have me killed
i know it was him
jesus christ mike
jesus christ lets get them all
now while weve got the muscle
this used to be my fathers old study
its changed
i remember there used to be
a big desk here
i remember when i was a kid
we had to be quiet
when we played near here
i was very happy that this house
never went to strangers
first clemenza took it over now you
my father taught me many things here
he taught me in this room
he taught me
keep your friends close
but your enemies closer
if hyman roth sees
that i interceded in this
in the rosato brothers favor
hell think his relationship with me
is still good
thats what i want him to think
i want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship
then ill be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was

most respected gentlemen
welcome to havana
i want to thank
this distinguished group
of american industrialists
for continuing to work with cuba
for the greatest period of prosperity
in her entire history
mr william shaw
representing the
general fruit company
messrs corngold and dant
of united telephone
and telegraph company
mr petty
regional vice president of
the pan american mining corporation
mr robert allen
of south american sugar
mr michael corleone of nevada
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities
and my old friend and associate
from florida
mr hyman roth
i would like to thank
united telephone and telegraph
for their christmas gift
a solid gold telephone
perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it
mr president
yes
could you discuss the rebel activity
and what this can mean
to our businesses
of course
heavy stuff
i assure you that although the rebels
have started a campaign in las villas
my staff indicates with assurance
that well drive them out of
santa clara before the new year
i want to put you all at ease
we will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools
he said that theyre making an arrest
and in a few minutes
hell let us through
johnny
its nothing
just some lousy bandits
the police are cleaning them up
viva fidel
i hope my age is correct
im always accurate about my age
make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it
im very pleased
youre all able to come from
such distances to be with me today
when a man comes
to this point in his life
he wants to turn over
the things hes been blessed with
turn them over to friends
as a reward for the friends hes had
and to make sure that everything
goes well after hes gone
not for years
hear hear
well see the doctors would disagree
but what do they know
these are wonderful things
that weve achieved in havana
and theres no limit
to where we can go from here
this kind of government knows
how to help business to encourage it
the hotels here are bigger
and swankier
than any of the joints in vegas
we can thank our friends
in the cuban government
which has put up half the cash
with the teamsters
on a dollar for dollar basis
and has relaxed restrictions
on imports
what im saying is that we have now
what we have always needed
real partnership with a government
smaller piece
you all know michael corleone
and we all remember his father
at the time of my retirement
or death
i turn over all my interests in
the havana operation to his control
but all of you will share
the nacionale will go
to the lakeville road boys
the capri to the corleone family
the sevilla biltmore also
but eddie levine will bring in the
pennino brothers
dino and eddie for a piece
and to handle the casino operations
weve saved a piece
for some friends in nevada
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home
i want all of you to enjoy your cake
so enjoy
happy birthday
i chaim
i saw an interesting thing
happen today
a rebel was being arrested
by the military police
rather than be taken alive
he exploded a grenade he had
in his jacket
he killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him
those rebels are lunatics
maybe so
but it occurred to me
that the soldiers are paid to fight
the rebels arent
what does that tell you
they can win
this country has had rebels
for 50 years its in their blood
i know ive been coming here
since the 20s
we were running molasses
from havana when you were a baby
the trucks were owned by your father
michael
id rather we talked about this
when were alone
the two million
never got to the island
it mustnt be known
that you held back the money
because you worried about the rebels
sit down michael sit down
if i could only live to see it
to be there with you
what i wouldnt give
for 20 more years
here we are protected
free to make our profits
without kefauver
the goddamn justice department
and the fbi
ninety miles away in partnership
with a friendly government
ninety miles its nothing
just one small step for a man looking
to be president of the united states
and having the cash
to make it possible
michael
were bigger than us steel
mikey how are you okay
hi freddy corleone
mio frati
jesus christ what a trip
i thought what if somebody knows
what ive got in here
can you imagine that
2 million on the seat next to me

you want to count it
whats going on
im totally in the dark
the family is making
an investment in havana
this is a gift for the president
thats great havanas great
its my kind of town
anybody i know in havana
dont know hyman roth johnny ola
no ive never met them
listen mikey im kind of
kind of nervous from the trip

married a woman like you did

for once in my life be more like pop
its not easy to be a son fredo
its not easy
mama used to say
you dont belong to me
you were left on the doorstep

my sixth sense tells me fredo brought
a bag full of money where is it
youre pulling out
just want to just want to wait
how do you feel
terrible
id give four million to be able
to take a painless piss
who had frank pentangeli killed
the rosato brothers
i know but who gave the goahead
i know i didnt
there was this kid i grew up with
he was younger than me
sort of looked up to me you know
we did our first work together
worked our way out of the street
things were good
during prohibition
we ran molasses into canada
made a fortune your father too
as much as anyone
i loved him and trusted him
later on he had an idea
to build a city
out of a desert stopover
for gis going to the west coast
that kids name was moe greene
and the city he invented

michael your father loves you
very much
mr cicci from the year 1942
to the present time
you were an employee
of the genco olive oil company
thats right
but in actuality you were a member
of the corleone crime organization
no we called it
the corleone family senator
what was your position
at first like everybody else
i was a soldier
what is that
a button you know senator
no i dont know tell me
when the boss says

mr questadt
you mean you kill people

you kill people at
the behest of your superiors
yeah thats right
and the head of your family
is michael corleone
yeah counselor michael corleone
did you ever get such an order
directly from michael corleone
no i never talked to him
mr cicci could you amplify
your answer a bit
do what
could you expand on your answer
im particularly interested
in knowing
was there always a buffer involved
someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order
right a buffer
the family had a lot of buffers
you may find this very amusing but
the members of this committee do not
tell me something ma
what did papa think
deep in his heart
he was being strong
strong for his family
but by being strong for his family
could he
lose it
youre thinking about your wife
about the baby you lost
but you and your wife can
always have another baby
no i meant lose his family
but you can never lose your family
times are changing
its my pleasure
i dont want money
take it as a gift
if theres something i can do for you

signora colombo why did you
come to see me
your wife told me to ask
if you could help me
shes in bad trouble
her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog
he told her to get rid of the animal
but her little boy loves that dog
so she hid it
when the landlord found out he
got mad and told her to leave
now she cant stay even if she
gets rid of it
im so ashamed
he said hed get the police to
throw us out on the street
im sorry but
i could give you a couple dollars
to help you move
i cant move
i want you to talk to him

they break the windows
they dirty the floors
a real pigsty
my name is vito corleone
signora colombo
is a friend of my wife
she says shes been evicted
for no good reason
shes a poor widow she has nobody
to take care of her
she has no relatives no money
all she has is this neighborhood
i already rented the place

vito what do you think
well make a big business
new york city
would you speak up please
new york city
are you the son of vito corleone
yes i am
where was he born
corleone sicily
did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as godfather
godfather is a term
used by his friends
one of affection and respect
mr chairman i would like to verify
the witness statement
for years many of my constituents
have been of italian descent
ive come to know them well
they have honored me with
their support and their friendship
i can proudly say that
some of my very best friends
are italianamericans
however mr chairman unfortunately
i have to leave these proceedings
in order to preside over
a very important meeting
of my own committee
before i leave i do want to say this
that these hearings on the mafia
are in no way whatsoever
a slur upon the great italian people
i can state from my own knowledge
and experience
that italianamericans are among
the most loyal most lawabiding
patriotic hardworking
american citizens in this land
it would be a shame mr chairman
if we allowed a few rotten apples
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel
because from the time
of christopher columbus
to the time of enrico fermi
to the present day
italianamericans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation
they are the salt of the earth
and one of the backbones
of this country
im sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague
mr corleone you have been advised
as to your legal rights
we have testimony from
a previous witness one willi cicci
he stated that you are head
of the most powerful mafia family
in the country
are you
no im not
he testified that you are
personally responsible
for the murder of a new york
police captain in 1947
and with him a man
named virgil sollozzo
do you deny this
yes i do
is it true that in the year 1950
you devised the murder of the heads
of the five families in new york
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power
its a complete falsehood
mr questadt
is it true you have
a controlling interest
in three major hotels in las vegas
no its not true
i own some stock in
some of the hotels there
but very little
i also have stock in ibm and itt
do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in new york state
no i do not
senator my client
would like to read a statement
mr chairman i think this statement
is totally out of order at this time
sir my client has answered this
committees questions with sincerity
he hasnt taken the fifth amendment
so this statement should be heard
no ill allow mr corleone
to read his statement
ill put it in the record
in the hopes of clearing
my family name
to give my children their share
of the american way of life
without a blemish on their name
and background
i have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation
i consider it
a great personal dishonor
to have to deny that i am a criminal
i wish to have the following noted
for the record
that i served my country faithfully
in world war two
and was awarded the navy cross
for actions in defense of my country
that i have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime
that no proof linking me
to any criminal conspiracy
whether it is called mafia
or cosa nostra or any other name
has ever been made public
i have not taken refuge
behind the fifth amendment
although its my right to do so
i challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me
and if they do not
i hope they will have the decency
to clear my name
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it
im sure were impressed
particularly with
your love for our country
well be in recess
until 1000 am monday
when we will produce a witness
wholl corroborate
the charges against you
at which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury
i remind you that youre still
under subpoena adjourned
tentoone shot you said
a tentoone shot
he would take the fifth and id lose
you sound like my bookie
i owe that monkey my life
well just get a good nights sleep
yeah
youve got a big day tomorrow
ive got you a new suit
new shirt new tie
ill shave you myself in the morning
youll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow americans
tomorrow my life wont be worth
a nickel after tomorrow
come on i saw this 19 times
youve got a great home here
for the rest of your life
nobody gets near you
youre not going anywhere
thats great beautiful
some deal i made
youll live like a king
youll be a hero
youll live better here
than most people outside
some deal
alive pentangeli is alive
how did they get their hands on him
roth he engineered it michael
when frankie went to make a deal with
the rosato brothers
they tried to kill him
he thought you doublecrossed him
our people with the detectives
said he was half dead scared
and shouted that youd turned on him
they already had him on possession
bookmaking murder one and more
the fbi has him airtight
hes on an army base 24hour guards
we cant get to him youve opened
yourself to five counts of perjury
what about fredo what does he know
he says he doesnt know anything
and i believe him
roth he played this one beautifully
im going to talk to fredo

i was kept pretty much in the dark
i didnt know all that much
what about now is there anything
you can help me out with
anything you can tell me now
theyve got pentangeli
i didnt know
it was going to be a hit mike
i swear to god i didnt know
johnny ola bumped into me
in beverly hills
he said that he wanted to talk
he said that you and roth
were in on a big deal together
and that there was something in it
for me if i could help him out
he said that you were being tough
on the negotiations
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast
it would be good for the family
and you believed that story
you believed that
he said there was something in it
for me on my own
ive always taken care of you fredo
taken care of me
youre my kid brother
you take care of me
did you ever think about that
did you ever once think about that
send fredo off to do this
send fredo off to do that
let fredo take care of some
mickey mouse nightclub somewhere
let fredo fetch somebody
at the airport
im your older brother
but was stepped over
its the way pop wanted it
its not the way i wanted it
i can handle things im smart
not like everybody says
like dumb im smart
and i want respect
is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation
anything more
the senate lawyer questadt
he belongs to roth
fredo
youre nothing to me now
not a brother not a friend
i dont want to know you
or what you do
i dont want to see you at the hotels
i dont want you near my house

where do you live now
i live in an army barracks
with the fbi guys
we have here a witness
that will further testify
to michael corleones rule
of a criminal empire
that controls all gambling
this witness has had no buffer
between himself and michael corleone
he can corroborate enough charges
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against michael corleone
senator
thank you chairman
mr pentangeli
mr pentangeli were you a member
of the corleone family
did you serve under caporegime
peter clemenza

mr pentangeli you
you are contradicting
your own sworn statement
i ask you again sir
here and now under oath
were you at any time a member
of a crime organization
led by michael corleone
i dont know nothing about that
i was in the olive oil business
with his father
but that was a long time ago
we have a sworn affidavit
your sworn affidavit
that you murdered
on the orders of michael corleone
do you deny this confession
and do you realize
what will happen if you do
the fbi guys promised me a deal
so i made up a lot of stuff about
michael corleone just to please them
but it was all lies everything
they kept saying
michael corleone did this
and michael corleone did that
so i said yeah sure why not

him away from that twomule town
he could have been big here
he could have had his own family
tom
what do i do now
frankie
you were always interested
in politics and history
i remember you talking about hitler
back in 33
yeah i still read a lot
i get good stuff in there
you were around the oldtimers
who built the organization
of the families
basing them on the old roman legions
with regimes capos
and soldiers
and it worked
yeah it worked
those were the great old days
you know
we was like the roman empire
the corleone family
was like the roman empire
yeah
it was once
frankie
when a plot
against the emperor failed
the plotters were always
given a chance
to let their families
keep their fortunes right
only the rich guys
the little guys got knocked off
and all their estates
went to the emperors
unless they went home
and killed themselves
then nothing happened
and their families were taken care of
that was a good break a nice deal
yeah
they went home
and sat in a hot bath
opened up their veins
and bled to death
and sometimes they had a little party
before they did it
dont worry about anything
