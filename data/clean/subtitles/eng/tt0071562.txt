to see your brother 
like everybody else 
ladies and gentlemen   
a most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words 
please welcome senator pat geary
of the state of nevada 
and there is mrs  geary 
thank you very much 
this is a very  very happy day
for me and my wife mrs  geary 
we see nevada far too seldom 
but today we can join with
old friends  we can make new friends
and we help celebrate
a young man s first communion 
and also to thank that boy s family
for a magnificent contribution
to the state 
i have here in my hand a check
made out to the university 
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of  
anthony vito corleone 
the check is signed by
that young man s parents
whom i think we should recognize 
mike  pat  kay  stand up  please 
let the folks see you 
folks  i want you to join me
in giving a real nevada thank you
to mr  and mrs  michael corleone 
we also have  as a special added
attraction  the sierra boys choir
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement
to honor their host 
mr  michael corleone 
boys 
the plaque 
okay  fellows  did you get that one 
okay  that s good 
now  senator 
just you and mrs  corleone 
my lawyer tom hagen  senator geary 
he arranged everything
through your man turnbull 
  yes  yes 
  sit down 
i thought that you and i
would talk alone 
i trust these men
with my life  senator 
to ask them to leave
would be an insult 
well  it s perfectly all right with me
but i am a blunt man and i intend
to speak very frankly to you 
maybe more frankly
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before 
the corleone family
has done well in nevada 
you own  or control 
two major hotels in vegas
and one in reno 
the licenses were grandfathered in
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission 
now my sources tell me
that you plan to make a move
against the tropigala 
they tell me that within a week 
you re going to move klingman out 
quite an expansion 
however  it will leave you
with a little technical problem 
the license will still be
in klingman s name 
turnbull is a good man 
yeah  well  let s cut out
the bullshit 
i don t want to spend
more time here than i have to 
you can have the license 
the price is 250 000 dollars 
plus 50  of the gross monthly
of all four hotels  mr  corleone 
the price for the license
is less than 20 000 dollars  right 
that s right 
  why would i pay more than that 
  because i intend to squeeze you 
i don t like your kind of people 
i don t like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair
dressed up in those silk suits
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent americans 
i ll do business with you 
but the fact is
that i despise your masquerade 
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family 
senator 
we re both part of the same hypocrisy 
but never think
it applies to my family 
all right  all right 
some people have to play little games 
you play yours 
let s say that you ll pay me
because it s in your interest 
i want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow  one more thing 
don t you contact me again  ever 
from now on you deal with turnbull 
open that door  son 
senator  you can have my answer now
if you like 
my offer is this   
nothing 
not even the fee
for the gaming license 
which i would like you to put up 
good afternoon  gentlemen 
ladies  i didn t know
you were out here 
  honey  we have to go

and your respect 
that casino   
registered owners 
jacob lawrence  allan barclay 
beverly hills attorneys 
the real owners are
the old lakeville road group
and our friend in miami 
klingman runs it
and owns a piece of it too 
but i ve been instructed to tell you
that if you move him out 
our friend in miami will go along 
it s very kind of him 
tell him it s greatly appreciated 
hyman roth always makes money
for his partners 
one by one  our old friends are gone 
death  natural or not 
prison  deported   
only hyman roth is left  because he
always made money for his partners

  you re my brother  don t apologize 
clemenza promised the rosato brothers
three territories after he died 
you took over
and didn t give it to them 
i welched 
clemenza promised them lu cazzo 
he promised them nothing 
  he hated them more than i do 
  frankie  they feel cheated 
you re sitting up
in the sierra mountains

your family s still called corleone 
and you ll run it like a corleone 
my family doesn t eat here 
doesn t eat in las vegas   
   and doesn t eat in miami   
   with hyman roth 
you re a good old man and i like you 
you were loyal to my father for years 
the rosato brothers
are taking hostages 
they spit right in my face 
all because they re backed up
by that jew in miami 
i know  that s why
i don t want them touched 
  not touched 
  no  i want you to be fair with them 
you want me to be fair with them 
how can you be fair to animals 
tom  listen  they recruit spics 
they recruit niggers 
they do violence
in their grandmothers  neighborhoods 
and everything with them is whores 
and junk  dope 
and they leave the gambling to last 
i want to run my family without you
on my back  i want those rosatos dead 
  no 
  morte 
i have business that s important with
hyman roth  i don t want it disturbed 
then you give your loyalty to a jew
before your own blood 
you know my father did business
with hyman roth  he respected him 
your father did business with
hyman roth  he respected hyman roth 
but he never trusted hyman roth
or his sicilian messenger boy 
johnny ola 
you ll have to excuse me  i m tired 
and i m a little drunk 
i want everybody here to know  there s
not going to be no trouble from me 
don corleone 
cicci  the door

i ve already made my plans 
the old man had too much wine 
it s late 
how s the baby 
  sleeping inside me 
  does it feel like a boy 
yes  it does  michael 
kay 
i m sorry about all the people today 
bad timing 
it couldn t be helped  though 
it made me think
of what you once told me 
 in five years the corleone family
will be completely legitimate  
that was seven years ago 
i know  i m trying  darling 
did you see this 
why are the drapes open 
kay  are you all right

stay by the door 
yeah  come in 
  mike  are you all right 
  yeah 
there s a lot i can t tell you  tom 
and i know
that s upset you in the past 
you felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence 
but it s because i admire you
and love you
that i kept things secret from you 
now you re the only one i can trust 
fredo 
well  he s got a good heart 
but he s weak and he s stupid 
and this is life and death 
tom  you re my brother 
i always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you  mikey 
a real brother 
i know that 
you re going to take over

if what i think has happened 
has happened 
i m leaving here tonight

with the lives of my wife
and my children 
the future of this family 
  if we catch them  will we find out   
  we won t catch them 
unless i m very wrong 
they re dead already 
they were killed by somebody
close to us 
inside  very  very frightened
that they botched it 
you don t think that rocco and neri
had something to do with this 
see    all our people are businessmen 
their loyalty is based on that 
one thing i learnt from pop
was to try to think
as people around you think 
on that basis  anything is possible 
mike  they re dead 
right outside my window 
i want to get out of here 
they re lying there dead 
over here  there s two of them

fanucci s with the black hand 
the whole neighborhood pays him 
even my father  in the grocery store 
if he s italian   
   why does he bother other italians 
he knows they have nobody
to protect them 
forget that  did you like my angel 
if you re happy  i m happy

hey  you speak italian

fanucci s mad  says the
neighborhood s getting sloppy 
people don t pay on time

says he s been too nice to everyone 
so fanucci s changing 
sure  he wants double
from everybody 
even from my father 
i m a friend  right  so you ll
let him work here 
i ve got some bad news 
i feel rotten
about telling you this   
but fanucci    he s got a nephew   
and you have to give him my job 
you ve always been good to me 
ever since i came here 
you looked after me like a father 
i thank you

it s almost over 
  do you follow the football game 
  not for a while i haven t 
i enjoy watching football
in the afternoon 
one of the things i love
about this country  baseball too 
ever since arnold rothstein
fixed the world series in 1919 
i heard you had some trouble 
stupid 
people behaving like that with guns 
the important thing
is you re all right 
good health
is the most important thing 
more than success  more than money 
more than power 
i came here because
there s going to be more bloodshed 
i wanted you to know 
so another war won t start 
nobody wants another war 
frank pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the rosato brothers 
when i refused 
he tried to have me killed 
he was stupid  i was lucky 
i ll visit him soon 
the important thing is that
nothing interferes
with our plans for the future 
nothing is more important 
  you re a wise and considerate man 
  and you re a great man  mr  roth 
  there s much i can learn from you 
  whatever i can do to help  michael 
  excuse me  lunch 
  come in 
  thank you  my dear 
  you re going to break your eardrums 
  enjoy it 
  thank you 
you re young  i m old and sick 
what we ll do in the next few months
will make history 
it s never been done before 
not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible 
frank pentangeli is a dead man 
you don t object 
he s small potatoes 
what s up 
we got company 
what s going on 
michael corleone is here 
where is he 
he s in your den  you better hurry 
he s been waiting a half hour 
is something wrong 
i wish you would have let me know
you were coming 
  i could have prepared something 
  i didn t want you to know 
  you heard what happened 
  i almost died  we were so relieved   
in my home 
in my bedroom where my wife sleeps 
where my children come to play 
in my home 
i want you to help me take my revenge 
michael  anything  what can i do 
settle these troubles
with the rosato brothers 
i don t understand  i don t   
i don t have your brain for big deals 
but this is a street thing 
that hyman roth in miami 
he s backing up those sons of bitches 
  i know he is 
  so why ask me to lay down to them 
it was hyman roth
that tried to have me killed 
i know it was him 
jesus christ  mike 
jesus christ  let s get them all 
now while we ve got the muscle 
this used to be my father s old study 
it s changed 
i remember there used to be
a big desk here 
i remember when i was a kid 
we had to be quiet
when we played near here 
i was very happy that this house
never went to strangers 
first clemenza took it over  now you 
my father taught me many things here 
he taught me in this room 
he taught me 
 keep your friends close 
but your enemies closer  
if hyman roth sees
that i interceded in this 
in the rosato brothers  favor 
he ll think his relationship with me
is still good 
that s what i want him to think 
i want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship 
then i ll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was 
  yeah 
  fredo  this is johnny ola 
  we need some more help 
  johnny 
jesus christ

i don t know  you ve got me in
deep enough already 
everything will be all right 
pentangeli says
he s willing to make a deal 
all we want to know is if he s
on the level 
or if he ll bring his boys 
you lied to me 
i don t want you to call me anymore

and there s no limit
to where we can go from here 
this kind of government knows
how to help business  to encourage it 
the hotels here are bigger
and swankier
than any of the joints in vegas 
we can thank our friends
in the cuban government
which has put up half the cash
with the teamsters 
on a dollar for dollar basis
and has relaxed restrictions
on imports 
what i m saying is that we have now
what we have always needed   
real partnership with a government 
smaller piece 
you all know michael corleone
and we all remember his father 
at the time of my retirement 
or death 
i turn over all my interests in
the havana operation to his control 
but all of you will share 
the nacionale will go
to the lakeville road boys 
the capri to the corleone family 
the sevilla biltmore also 
but eddie levine will bring in the
pennino brothers 
dino and eddie  for a piece
and to handle the casino operations 
we ve saved a piece
for some friends in nevada
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home 
i want all of you to enjoy your cake 
so  enjoy 
  happy birthday 
  i  chaim 
i saw an interesting thing
happen today 
a rebel was being arrested
by the military police 
rather than be taken alive 
he exploded a grenade he had
in his jacket 
he killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him 
  those rebels are lunatics 
  maybe so 
but it occurred to me 
that the soldiers are paid to fight 
the rebels aren t 
  what does that tell you 
  they can win 
this country has had rebels
for 50 years  it s in their blood 
i know  i ve been coming here
since the  20s 
we were running molasses
from havana when you were a baby 
the trucks were owned by your father 
michael 
i d rather we talked about this
when we re alone 
the two million
never got to the island 
it mustn t be known
that you held back the money
because you worried about the rebels 
sit down  michael  sit down 
if i could only live to see it 
to be there with you 
what i wouldn t give
for 20 more years 
here we are  protected 
free to make our profits
without kefauver 
the goddamn justice department
and the fbi 
ninety miles away  in partnership
with a friendly government 
ninety miles  it s nothing 
just one small step for a man looking
to be president of the united states
and having the cash
to make it possible 
michael 
we re bigger than u s  steel 
mikey  how are you  okay 
  hi  freddy corleone 
  mio frati 
jesus christ  what a trip 
i thought   what if somebody knows
what i ve got in here  
can you imagine that 
 2 million on the seat next to me 
  excuse me 
  it s okay 
you want to count it 
what s going on 
i m totally in the dark 
the family is making
an investment in havana 
this is a gift for the president

married a woman like you did

for once in my life  be more like pop 
it s not easy to be a son  fredo

mama used to say

  okay  nice to see you  mr  paul

a bag full of money  where is it 
  you re pulling out

i d give four million to be able
to take a painless piss 
  who had frank pentangeli killed 
  the rosato brothers 
i know  but who gave the go ahead 
i know i didn t 
there was this kid i grew up with 
he was younger than me 
sort of looked up to me  you know 
we did our first work together 
worked our way out of the street 
things were good 
during prohibition
we ran molasses into canada 
made a fortune  your father  too 
as much as anyone 
i loved him and trusted him 
later on he had an idea
to build a city
out of a desert stop over
for g i s going to the west coast 
that kid s name was moe greene
and the city he invented
was las vegas 
this was a great man 
a man of vision and guts 
and there isn t even
a plaque  signpost
or statue of him in that town 
someone put a bullet through his eye 
no one knows who gave the order 
when i heard it  i wasn t angry 
i knew moe  i knew he was headstrong 
talking loud  saying stupid things 
so when he turned up dead 
i let it go 
and i said to myself 
 this is the business we ve chosen  
i didn t ask
who gave the order  because it had
nothing to do with business 
that two million in a bag
in your room   
i m going in to take a nap 
when i wake  if the money
is on the table 
i know i have a partner 
if it isn t  i know i don t

young man  i hear you and
your friends are stealing goods 
but you don t even send a
dress to my house  no respect 
you know i ve got three daughters 
this is my neighborhood 
you and your friends should
show me some respect 
you should let me wet
my beak a little 
i hear you and your friends
cleared  600 each 
give me  200 each 
for your own protection 
and i ll forget the insult 
you young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me 
otherwise the cops will
come to your house 
and your family will be ruined 
of course if i m wrong about how much
you stole   i ll take a little less 
and by less  i only mean  
a hundred bucks less 
now don t refuse me 
understand  paisan 
i understand 
my friends and i share all the money 
so first  i have to talk to them 
tell your friends i don t want a lot 
just enough to wet my beak 
don t be afraid to tell them 
600 bucks   
suppose we don t pay 
you know his gang  tessio 
real animals 
maranzalla himself let fanucci
work this neighborhood 
he s got connections
with the cops  too 
we have to pay him 
 200 each    everybody agreed 
why do we have to pay him 
vito  leave this to us 
he s one person  we re three 
he s got guns  we ve got guns 
why should we give him the
money we sweated for 
this is his neighborhood 
i know two bookies who don t give
anything to fanucci 
who 
joe the greek and frank pignattaro 
they don t pay fanucci 
if they don t pay fanucci  then
somebody else collects for maranzalla 
we ll all be better off if we
pay him  don t worry 
now what i say stays in this room 
if you both like  why not give me
 50 each to pay fanucci 
i guarantee he ll accept
what i give him 
if fanucci says  200   
   he means it  vito 
i ll reason with him 
leave everything to me 
i ll take care of everything 
i never lie to my friends 
tomorrow you both go talk to fanucci 
he ll ask for the money 
tell him you ll pay whatever he wants 
don t argue with him 
then i ll go and get him to agree 
don t argue with him  since
he s so tough 
how can you get him to take less 
that s my business 
just remember that i did you a favor 
is it a deal 
yes 
his family s out of the house 
fanucci s alone in the cafe 
vito  here s my  50  buona fortuna 
are you sure he s going to go for it 
i ll make an offer he don t refuse 
don t worry 
it looks like there s  
  100 under my hat 
i was right

i m short of money right now 
i ve been out of work    so just
give me a little time

help you  let me know 
you ve done well for yourself 
enjoy the festa 
this is too violent for me 
what ve you got there 
michael  your father loves you
very much 
mr  cicci  from the year 1942
to the present time 
you were an employee
of the genco olive oil company 
that s right 
but in actuality you were a member
of the corleone crime organization 
no  we called it
the corleone family  senator 
what was your position 
at first  like everybody else 
i was a soldier 
  what is that 
  a button  you know  senator 
no  i don t know  tell me 
when the boss says
 push a button  on a guy 
i push a button  see  senator 
mr  questadt 
  you mean you kill people 
  what 
you kill people at
the behest of your superiors 
yeah  that s right 
and the head of your family
is michael corleone 
yeah  counselor  michael corleone 
did you ever get such an order
directly from michael corleone 
no  i never talked to him 
mr  cicci  could you amplify
your answer a bit 
  do what 
  could you expand on your answer 
i m particularly interested
in knowing 
was there always a buffer involved 
someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order 
right  a buffer 
the family had a lot of buffers 
you may find this very amusing  but
the members of this committee do not 
tell me something  ma 
what did papa think   
deep in his heart 
he was being strong   
strong for his family 
but by being strong for his family   
   could he   
   lose it 
you re thinking about your wife   
about the baby you lost 
but you and your wife can
always have another baby 
no  i meant    lose his family 
but you can never lose your family 
times are changing 
it s my pleasure 
i don t want money 
take it as a gift 
if there s something i can do for you 
you come  we talk 
signora colombo  why did you
come to see me 
your wife told me to ask
if you could help me 
she s in bad trouble 
her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog 
he told her to get rid of the animal 
but her little boy loves that dog 
so she hid it 
when the landlord found out  he
got mad and told her to leave 
now she can t stay even if she
gets rid of it 
i m so ashamed 
he said he d get the police to
throw us out on the street 
i m sorry  but   
i could give you a couple dollars
to help you move 
i can t move 
i want you to talk to him 
tell him i want to stay here 
what s your landlord s name 
his name is signor roberto 
he lives on fourth street  near here 
they break the windows 
they dirty the floors   
a real pig sty 
my name is vito corleone 
signora colombo
is a friend of my wife 
she says she s been evicted
for no good reason 
she s a poor widow  she has nobody
to take care of her 
she has no relatives  no money 
all she has is this neighborhood 
i already rented the place
to another family 
i told her that i d talk to you 
that you re a reasonable man 
she got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble 
so let her stay 
impossible 
are you sicilian 
no  i m calabrese 
we re practically paisan

i already rented it 
i ll look like an idiot 
besides  the new tenants
pay more rent 
how much more a month 
five bucks 
here s six months increase in advance 
but don t tell her about it 
she s very proud 
come see me in another six months 
of course  the dog stays  right 
the dog stays 
who the hell are you
to come give me orders 
watch out or i ll kick your
sicilian ass right into the street 
do me this favor 
i won t forget it 
ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me 
they ll tell you i know how
to return a favor

he s been asking all around
the neighborhood about you 
i hope i m not disturbing you

of course signora colombo can stay 
i m giving back the money you gave me 
un  due  three  four

i ll lower it  5 
i ll lower it   10

  vito  what do you think 
  we ll make a big business 
  new york city 
  would you speak up  please 
new york city 
  are you the son of vito corleone 
  yes  i am 
  where was he born 
  corleone  sicily 
did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as godfather 
godfather is a term
used by his friends 
one of affection and respect 
mr  chairman  i would like to verify
the witness  statement 
for years many of my constituents
have been of italian descent 
i ve come to know them well 
they have honored me with
their support and their friendship 
i can proudly say that
some of my very best friends
are italian americans 
however  mr  chairman  unfortunately
i have to leave these proceedings
in order to preside over
a very important meeting
of my own committee 
before i leave  i do want to say this 
that these hearings on the mafia
are in no way whatsoever
a slur upon the great italian people 
i can state from my own knowledge
and experience
that italian americans are among
the most loyal  most law abiding 
patriotic  hard working
american citizens in this land 
it would be a shame  mr  chairman 
if we allowed a few rotten apples
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel 
because from the time
of christopher columbus
to the time of enrico fermi
to the present day 
italian americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation 
they are the salt of the earth 
and one of the backbones
of this country 
i m sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague 
mr  corleone  you have been advised
as to your legal rights 
we have testimony from
a previous witness  one willi cicci 
he stated that you are head
of the most powerful mafia family
in the country 
  are you 
  no  i m not 
he testified that you are
personally responsible
for the murder of a new york
police captain in 1947
and with him a man
named virgil sollozzo 
  do you deny this 
  yes  i do 
is it true that in the year 1950
you devised the murder of the heads
of  the five families  in new york
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power 
  it s a complete falsehood 
  mr  questadt 
is it true you have
a controlling interest
in three major hotels in las vegas 
no  it s not true 
i own some stock in
some of the hotels there 
but very little 
i also have stock in ibm and it t 
do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in new york state 
no  i do not 
senator  my client
would like to read a statement 
mr  chairman  i think this statement
is totally out of order at this time 
sir  my client has answered this
committee s questions with sincerity 
he hasn t taken the fifth amendment 
so this statement should be heard 
no  i ll allow mr  corleone
to read his statement 
i ll put it in the record 
in the hopes of clearing
my family name
to give my children their share
of the american way of life
without a blemish on their name
and background 
i have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation 
i consider it
a great personal dishonor
to have to deny that i am a criminal 
i wish to have the following noted
for the record   
that i served my country faithfully
in world war two
and was awarded the navy cross
for actions in defense of my country 
that i have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime 
that no proof linking me
to any criminal conspiracy
whether it is called mafia
or cosa nostra or any other name
has ever been made public 
i have not taken refuge
behind the fifth amendment 
although it s my right to do so 
i challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me
and if they do not 
i hope they will have the decency
to clear my name
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it 
i m sure we re impressed 
particularly with
your love for our country 
we ll be in recess
until 10 00 a m  monday
when we will produce a witness
who ll corroborate
the charges against you 
at which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury 
i remind you that you re still
under subpoena  adjourned 
ten to one shot  you said 
a ten to one shot
he would take the fifth  and i d lose 
you sound like my bookie 
i owe that monkey my life 
  well  just get a good night s sleep 
  yeah 
you ve got a big day tomorrow 
i ve got you a new suit 
new shirt  new tie 
i ll shave you myself in the morning 
you ll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow americans 
tomorrow    my life won t be worth
a nickel after tomorrow 
come on  i saw this 19 times 
you ve got a great home here 
for the rest of your life 
nobody gets near you 
you re not going anywhere 
that s great  beautiful 
some deal i made 
you ll live like a king 
you ll be a hero 
you ll live better here
than most people outside 
some deal 
alive  pentangeli is alive 
  how did they get their hands on him 
  roth  he engineered it  michael 
when frankie went to make a deal with
the rosato brothers
they tried to kill him 
he thought you double crossed him 
our people with the detectives
said he was half dead  scared 
and shouted that you d turned on him 
they already had him on possession 
bookmaking  murder one and more 
the fbi has him airtight 
he s on an army base  24 hour guards 
we can t get to him  you ve opened
yourself to five counts of perjury 
what about fredo  what does he know 
he says he doesn t know anything 
and i believe him 
roth  he played this one beautifully 
i m going to talk to fredo 
i haven t got a lot to say  mike 
we have time 
i was kept pretty much in the dark 
i didn t know all that much 
what about now  is there anything
you can help me out with 
anything you can tell me now 
they ve got pentangeli 
i didn t know
it was going to be a hit  mike 
i swear to god i didn t know 
johnny ola bumped into me
in beverly hills 
he said that he wanted to talk 
he said that you and roth
were in on a big deal together 
and that there was something in it
for me if i could help him out 
he said that you were being tough
on the negotiations
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast 
it would be good for the family 
and you believed that story 
you believed that 
he said there was something in it
for me  on my own 
  i ve always taken care of you  fredo 
  taken care of me 
you re my kid brother 
you take care of me 
did you ever think about that 
did you ever once think about that 
 send fredo off to do this 
send fredo off to do that  
 let fredo take care of some
mickey mouse nightclub somewhere  
 let fredo fetch somebody
at the airport  
i m your older brother 
but was stepped over 
  it s the way pop wanted it 
  it s not the way i wanted it 
i can handle things  i m smart 
not like everybody says 
like dumb  i m smart
and i want respect 
is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation 
anything more 
the senate lawyer  questadt 
he belongs to roth 
fredo 
you re nothing to me now 
not a brother  not a friend 
i don t want to know you 
or what you do 
i don t want to see you at the hotels 
i don t want you near my house 
when you see our mother 
i want to know in advance 
so i won t be there 
you understand 
mikey 
i don t want anything to happen to him
while my mother s alive 
there s more people
than at a ballgame in here 
  hey  there s willi cicci 
  frankie five angels   
this committee will come to order 
  state your name  please 
  frank pentangeli 
  where were you born 
  partinico  it s outside of palermo 
where do you live now 
i live in an army barracks
with the fbi guys 
we have here a witness
that will further testify
to michael corleone s rule
of a criminal empire
that controls all gambling 
this witness has had no buffer
between himself and michael corleone 
he can corroborate enough charges
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against michael corleone 
  senator 
  thank you  chairman 
mr  pentangeli 
mr  pentangeli  were you a member
of the corleone family 
did you serve under caporegime 
peter clemenza 
and under vito corleone 
also known as the godfather 
i never knew any godfather 
i have my own family 
mr  pentangeli  you   
you are contradicting
your own sworn statement 
i ask you again  sir 
here and now under oath   
were you at any time a member
of a crime organization
led by michael corleone

connie 
tom  sit down 
our friend and business partner 
hyman roth  is in the news 
  did you hear about it 
  i hear that he s in israel 
the high court in israel
turned down his request to live there 
his passport s been invalidated 
except to return here 
he landed in buenos aires yesterday 
he offered them a million dollars
if they d let him live there 
  they turned him down 
  he s going to try panama 
panama won t take him 
not for a million 
not for ten million 
his condition is reported as terminal 
he s only got six months left 
he s had the same heart attack
for 20 years 
that plane goes to miami 
that s right 
that s where i want it met 
impossible 
they ll turn him over to the
internal revenue  customs and fbi 
it s not impossible 
nothing s impossible 
it would be
like trying to kill the president 
  there s no way we can get to him 
  tom  you surprise me 
if anything in this life is certain 
if history has taught us anything 
it s that you can kill anyone 
  rocco 
  difficult  not impossible 
good 
why did you ask me
if something was wrong when i came in 
i thought you were going to tell me
that you were moving your family
to vegas
and that you d been offered
the vice presidency
of the houstan hotels there 
i thought you d tell me that 
must i tell you every offer
i turn down 
  let s do business 
  all right 
just consider this  michael 
just consider it 
roth and the rosatos are on the run 
are they worth it 
are they strong enough 
is it worth it  you ve won 
do you want to wipe everybody out 
i don t feel i have to
wipe everybody out  tom 
just my enemies  that s all 
are you with me in these things 
or what 
because if not 
you can take your wife 
your family and your mistress
and move them all to las vegas 
why do you hurt me  michael 
i ve always been loyal to you 
what is this 
so    you re staying 
yes  i m staying 
what do you want me to do 
hey  anthony 
how would you like it if i taught you
how to catch the really big fish 
  would you like that 
  okay 
you know  when i was your age 
i went out fishing
with all my brothers
and my father  everybody 
i was the only one that caught a fish 
nobody else could catch one 
do you know how i did it 
every time i put the line in the water
i said a hail mary
and every time i said a hail mary 
i caught a fish 
do you believe that  it s true 
that s the secret 
do you want to try it out on the lake 
okay 
what else have you got 
everything will be okay 
  did my brother go back 
  yeah  don t worry 
he s ten times tougher than me 
my brother  he s old fashioned 
he didn t want dinner 
just wanted to go home 
that s my brother  nothing could get
him away from that two mule town 
he could have been big here 
he could have had his own family 
tom 
what do i do now 
frankie 
you were always interested
in politics and history 
i remember you talking about hitler
back in  33 
yeah  i still read a lot 
i get good stuff in there 
you were around the old timers 
who built the organization
of the families 
basing them on the old roman legions 
with  regimes    capos 
and  soldiers  
  and it worked 
  yeah  it worked 
those were the great old days 
you know 
we was like the roman empire 
the corleone family
was like the roman empire 
yeah 
it was once 
frankie 
when a plot
against the emperor failed 
the plotters were always
given a chance
to let their families
keep their fortunes  right 
only the rich guys 
the little guys got knocked off
and all their estates
went to the emperors 
unless they went home
and killed themselves 
then nothing happened 
and their families were taken care of 
that was a good break  a nice deal 
yeah 
they went home
and sat in a hot bath
opened up their veins
and bled to death 
and sometimes they had a little party
before they did it 
don t worry about anything 
frankie five angels
