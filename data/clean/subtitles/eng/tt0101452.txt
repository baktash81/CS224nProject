time has told 
i ll go back and change that 
with the aid of my secret weapons

replicas only 
furnished with my agenda 
now  what is your mission 
  first  we totally kill bill and ted 
  then we take over their lives 
then we utterly destroy them 
at the battle of the bands  we give
their speech except totally different 
and thus a new future is born 
a great future 
don t tell us 
you programmed us 
  he s totally a robot 
  so are you 
we re total metal heads 
shut up 
now 
  what is the fuel 
  fear 
  what is the engine 
  discipline 
  what is the ideal 
  order 
and how do we achieve it 
death to bill and ted 
catch you later  evil dude

in the 20th century   
   the princesses
from medieval england 
joanna and elizabeth 
and we are   
   wyld stallyns 
you tell me you re
the greatest band  but you stink 
we don t understand it either 
you can t sing 
  the girls can play  but you guys 
  girls mature faster than guys 
plus  they started
in the 15th century 
what do you mean 
  they re from medieval england 
  ted  shut up 
medieval england  iowa 
the battle of the bands is
the biggest event in the area 
we re talking
about a  25 000 first prize   
   a two year record deal and exposure
to people in the business 
we re even live on channel 12  if you
were me  would you put you guys on 
no way 
since you work for pretzels  n  cheese 
i ll give you a shot 
excellent 
but last  midnight 
by that time  everyone will be gone 
that s all right 
we re used to that 
we cleaned out ted s brother s
junior high dance 
they turned on  la bamba 
while he was playing his solo 
shut up  ted 
guys  do yourself a favor 
prepare a little 
work on your act 
think of something 
don t worry 
we won t let you down

the day after tomorrow

or a little street sweeper
but sooner or later
you dance with the reaper
get down with your bad self

and the best time to be   
   is now 
and all we can say is
