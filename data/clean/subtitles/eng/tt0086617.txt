under the sign of capricorn 
occupation  journalist with the
australian broadcasting service 
jakarta  first assignment
as foreign correspondent 
you re an enemy here  hamilton 
like all westerners 
president sukarno
tells the west to go to hell   
and today sukarno
is the voice of the third world 
  where you get visa 
  sydney 
something wrong with that 
mr  hamilton  mr  hamilton 
  welcome to indonesia 
  thanks  you re   
kumar  from jakarta office 
hortono  driver 
  where s potter 
  mr  potter has gone  he left this 
where s he gone 
back to australia 
please follow me 
he was supposed to stay
and brief me 
he said he was sorry 
his wife was sick 
of what  him 
no  of jakarta  boss 
our first air conditioned hotel 
here  americans and europeans
pay to be kept cold 
who s this 
cia 
nah  he s an embassy office boy 
look at him 
you re both wrong 
he s the new a b s  man 
how did our diminutive friend
know that 
that little twerp knows everything 
guy hamilton  right 
  right 
  billy kwan 
i did a lot of film work
for potter 
how do you do 
i felt sorry for you 
dumped in your first posting
without contacts 
adrift  hoping to
bluff your way through 
wally o sullivan  sydney herald 
  read your stuff 
  mere trifles  dear boy 
kevin condon 
photo journo for theta 
  and pete curtis  washington post 
  hi 
  pleasant flight 
  yeah  it was all right 
  this your first overseas post 
  yes  it is  yeah 
pity about potter takin  off 
can be hard here without contacts 
i ll survive 
  taxi  sir 
  no  thanks 
you should take a taxi 
it s dangerous walking there 
  taxi  sir 
  no 
most of us become children again
when we enter the slums of asia 
last night i watched you
walk back into childhood   
in all its opposite intensities   
laughter and misery 
the crazy and the grim   
toy town and a city of fear 
hey  english  huh 
hey  capitalist 
is it always like that here 
don t take it personally 
you re just a symbol of the west 
feel more like a spittoon 
  where are we going 
  this is a little market for the poor 
 and the people asked him  saying 
 what shall we do then   
  what s that 
  it s from luke 
chapter 3  verse 10 
 what then must we do  
tolstoy asked the same question 
he wrote a book with that title 
he got so upset
about the poverty in moscow   
that he went one night
into the poorest section   
and just gave away
all his money 
you could do that now 
five american dollars would be a fortune
to one of these people 
wouldn t do any good 
just be a drop in the ocean 
ah  that s the same conclusion
tolstoy came to 
  i disagree 
  what s your solution 
well  i support the view that you just
don t think about the major issues 
you do whatever you can about
the misery that s in front of you 
add your light
to the sum of light 
  you think that s naive 
  yup 
  it s all right  most journalists do 
  we can t afford to get involved 
typical journo s answer 
good luck for tomorrow 
you ll need it 
go home  get some sleep 
take the one behind me 
you re ambitious  self contained   
moderate to conservative in politics 
and despite your naïveté   
i sense a potential 
something immediately apparent 
a possibility 
could you be the unmet friend 
boss  take off your sunglasses
when you go in 
palace guards say they can
tell assassin by his eyes 
  good morning 
  good morning 
missed anything 
yeah  63 minutes
of excruciating boredom 
i got a feeling he s gonna make
a pronouncement this morning 
oh  really  kevin 
what makes you say that 
  just a thought 
  yeah 
when a thought crosses your mind  it s
been on the shortest trip in jakarta 
what happens next 
soon as sukarno s finished breakfast 
we go up 
  how do you know when he s finished 
  he throws his scraps to us 
sorry  chaps 
age before beauty 
one  two  three 
testing  testing 
it ll do his image a world of good 
the president will act   
  of course i will   
  general 
no  not now 
just come up here for a minute 
are you gonna leave the u n  or not 
korea respect sukarno 
not like   
let me put it this way  if you
don t leave  what are you gonna do 
can i come to your place 
if you leave the u n  
what are you gonna do 
in short  jakarta is a city where
the questions outnumber the answers   
but one thing is certain 
that sukarno s tightrope shuffle
between the communist p k  i   
and the right wing military   
is looking more precarious
as the hours tick by 
this is guy hamilton
in jakarta for a b s  news 
  is that all 
  what do you mean 
  you could have written that from here 
  what about the tightrope image 
everyone else thinks sukarno
is in control 
guy  that wasn t news 
it was travelogue 
sydney out 
  didn t like it  eh  boss 
  stop callin  me boss 
sorry 
have one of these 
  why are you creepin  around 
  i m sorry  i didn t hear you come in 
  geez 
  i keep equipment here 
potter gave me a key 
do you want it back 
huh  keep it 
  did you get an interview today 
  what 
  did you get an interview 
  no  i didn t 
you re in trouble 
do you realize that 
it s early days yet 
all the top doors are shut
to western journalists 
  curtis got an interview 
  curtis and wally have got reputations 
they can t be ignored 
your only way in is personal contacts 
potter sabotaged you 
you want me to shoot myself 
ten years i ve waited for this 
and if i mess it up   
they ll send me back to the news room
in sydney  and that s a graveyard 
if you could get
any interview you want   
excluding one with sukarno 
who would it be 
  the leader of the communist party 
  i ll get it 
i can get you to him tomorrow 
  he doesn t give interviews 
  he does when he needs to 
he s a friend of mine 
i ve already spoken to him about you 
  why are you on speaking terms with   
  lf you want it   
it s yours 
it should make quite a stir
internationally 
if you can get me to aidit  i ll give
you all the film work you can handle 
exclusive 
that s great  old man  that s what
i ve always wanted  a real partnership 
why the break to me 
why not potter 
i didn t like him 
we ll make a great team 
you  for the words 
me  for the pictures 
i can be your eyes 
  thank you very much  mr  aidit 
  let s go  guy 
we ll keep in touch 
i ll take this straight
to the airport 
  you ll be rushing to catch the flight 
  i ll make it 
if you shot that out of focus 
i ll kill you 
you worry about the words 
hamilton 
identification  guy hamilton
in jakarta  lead in for story 
exclusive interview with head
of the indonesian communist party 
piece begins in five seconds 
 sukarno has yielded to the
demands of communist party members   
 in indonesian cabinet that
a  fifth force  is to be established  
  that s bullshit 
  the worrying thing is   
it s well written bullshit 
and it s right here in my paper 
my paper wants me to match it 
here they are now 
sir guy and the black dwarf 
congratulations  hamilton 
you ve squeezed the test match
into two columns 
sorry about that 
  want a beer 
  great 
ali 
you really think sukarno s gonna let
the commies have their own army 
  that s what aidit said 
  aidit s lying 
  maybe 
  why report it 
  maybe he isn t 
  you know why he let you interview him 
no  tell us  pete 
because he knew a more experienced
journalist wouldn t have even filed it 
really  pete 
if aidit told you he had a toothache 
you d file it 
you ve been after him for months
trying to get him to tell you something 
the story stinks  and you know it 
sukarno s not stupid 
he lets the communists have arms  and
we ll have a civil war here tomorrow 
  yeah  that s right 
  there better not be 
  i m gettin  married in december 
  don t lose any sleep over it 
this story s bullshit 
and when i file   
i m gonna piss on it
from a great height  mate 
you do that  buddy 
it s about the only   
  guy  no 
  simmer down  stop it 
  did you see that 
  forget it 
next time  pal 
jesus 
i must confess  hamilton   
that i probably would have infused it
with a little more skepticism   
but bitter resentment won t prevent me
from admitting it was a good piece 
well done 
now smile and shake hands 
beauty among the squalor 
i took that with a 200 millimeter 
got a natural elegance  haven t they 
all i ever see you shoot are tits 
quit trying to sell us
the pursuit of abstract beauty   
and admit you re a pervert 
billy  you re a professional 
is that pornography or art 
if it s in focus  it s pornography 
if it s out of focus  it s art 
definitely art  mmm 
they really are
exquisite creatures  aren t they 
let me ask you something  i ve
worried about this since you got here 
  what do you do for sex 
  you re worried about that 
whenever i hit the front page 
i get a hard on 
  so what do you do 
  i go up to the cemetery 
are you a necrophiliac 
it s where the prostitutes hang out 
fantastic girls  hamilton 
best value for your money ass
in asia 
i ll take you up there
right now  huh 
  some other time 
  wise man 
  they re riddled with vd 
  you never heard of penicillin 
you will love this action 
you want to spend the night 
costs you one dollar 
starvation s a great aphrodisiac 
keep it up  billy  we ll just
nail you to the old cross  huh 
he can afford to be virtuous 
he s holding hands
with the best lookin  chick in town 
she s a friend 
sure she is  billy 
you d find that kind of relationship
hard to understand 
get me the nails 
i m gonna hang the little bastard up
right now 
you ve been holdin  out on me 
here we are  come on 
not too much  hamilton 
take it easy 
all right  that s enough 
hey  billy  grab one of these 
go on  go on 
come on  out of the way 
we re trying to eat here 
you ever have these 
this stuff is terrific 
i want you to meet your new best friend 
i bought him for you 
dance for my pal 
  do a dance for my pal 
  okay 
  get him outta here 
  i bought him for you  pal 
he s yours 
he goes wherever you go 
oh  god 
  it was just a joke 
  just a joke 
  hey  wally   
  forget it 
  sorry 
  billy  it was a joke 
forget it 
billy  what s that weird noise 
it s the bamboo 
but there is a spirit here 
i hear him outside at night 
he came inside one night and spilled
some bottles of developer 
  do you really believe that stuff 
  absolutely  old man 
the unseen is all around us   
particularly here in java 
g day  sport 
g day 
one of us 
air conditioning  huh  i thought you
were living like the people 
i keep a lot of film stock here 
it s kinder to it 
kinder to you too  eh 
okay  okay  but everything else here
is your basic indonesia 
a normal man
of normal intelligence   
capable of having
normal children   
but whose body is a joke 
but the one great advantage
of being a dwarf   
is that you can be wiser than
other people and no one envies you 
you re not a dwarf 
that s what i like
about you  guy 
you don t care  do you 
or maybe you just don t see 
  want some tea 
  love some 
this picture of sukarno   
  it s me 
  it s you  yeah 
i dressed for the part 
he s quite a hero of mine 
i think he s a genius 
he s really trying to do
something for his people 
to them  he s a god 
that s the real jakarta 
scrounging for handfuls of rice
to keep alive another day 
that s a story you journos
don t tell in your reports 
  nobody wants to hear it 
  tell them anyway 
why don t you exhibit these 
i don t care about the photographs 
i care about the content 
i m not very aesthetically minded 
that explains all those
terrible shirts you get around in 
you like my puppets 
if you want to understand java   
you have to understand
the wajang   
the sacred shadow play 
the puppet master was a priest 
that s why they call sukarno
the great puppet master   
balancing the left
with the right 
their shadows are souls 
and the screen is heaven 
you must watch their shadows   
not the puppets 
the right in constant struggle
with the left 
the forces of light and darkness
in endless balance 
in the west  we want answers
for everything 
everything is right or wrong
or good or bad 
but in the wajang  no such
final conclusions exist 
look at prince arjuna 
he s a hero 
but he can also be fickle
and selfish 
krishna says to him   
 all is clouded
by desire  arjuna   
 as a fire by smoke   
 as a mirror by dust 
 through these 
it blinds the soul  
pretty good stuff 
this is the princess srikandi 
noble and proud but headstrong 
arjuna will fall in love with her 
who s this one 
he s very special 
the dwarf  semar 
what does he do 
he serves the prince 
that s my jilly 
there s someone
you should get to know 
  who 
  the chap with the mustache 
he s british military attaché 
  colonel 
  ah  kwan

  colonel ralph henderson

i m master   
just as i m master
in the darkroom   
stirring my prints
in the magic developing bath 
i shuffle like cards
the lives i deal with 
their faces stare out at me 
people who will become
other people 
people who will become old 
betray their dreams   
become ghosts 
ibu 
doctor  ibu  doctor 
you understand 
can t make her understand
that the canal   
which she and udin bathe in
and drink from carries disease 
in another country 
she would be a decent woman 
here she begs
and perhaps sells herself 
her tragedy is repeated
a million times in this city 
 what then must we do  
 we must give with love to whomever
god has placed in our path

the lombok famine
wasn t exactly speculation 
i ll get my coat

a bit melodramatic 
that s only my opinion 
my flatmate was moved to tears

  curfew 
  good night 
good night

i m sorry if i offended you last night 
about your famine story 
oh  no  a bit of constructive
criticism never goes astray 
what did you think
was melodramatic about it 
  i did offend you 
  no  you didn t 
  yes  i did 
  it was a good piece 
i know what you were talking about 
i was there for two months in lombok 
i thought there was
one reference too many to children   
with gaunt rib cages
and dull  listless eyes 
  the rest of it was fine 
  you were there 
rib cages and eyes
are the real thing  eh 
perhaps you only needed
to mention it once 
  they always do that 
  what 
they wanna touch
your white skin 
i m curious about something 
what s that 
why did you let ralph
win that swimming race 
you re observant  aren t you 
  why d you do it 
  it seemed important to him 
  are you always that generous 
  oh  no 
  so why 
  i don t know 
i guess he reminded me of my father 
same bald head  mustache 
  he was killed in the war 
  how d you know that 
  billy told me 
  billy told you 
billy  anyone home 
was philippe a good journalist 
  one of the best 
  where is he now 
saigon 
  did billy tell you 
  yeah 
you and he have become
quite a team 
he thinks the world of you 
god  i don t know why 
  you re everything he d like to be 
  he s a strange little guy  you know 
how does he get me an interview
with the top communist in indonesia 
  you think he s an agent 
  well  maybe 
you don t know him very well 
he s a cameraman 
how does he get such good contacts 
i don t know 
people trust him 
he breezes into every embassy reception
whether he s invited or not 
no one can get up the courage
to ask him to leave 
he s keeping a file on me  why does he
do that if he s not an agent 
  he keeps files on many people 
  what kind of people 
people he cares about 
  has he told you about lbu 
  who s that 
a woman he s adopted
from the kampong 
billy s got a woman 
more than that 
  that s not his kid  is it 
  no 
he gives them food
and money  that s all 
the old boy 
  would you like a cup of tea 
  better not 
i got interviews to do at priok 
you wanna come 
to priok 
you can keep an eye
on the melodrama 
what do you do at the embassy 
apart from socializing 
i work with ralph 
you a spy 
you re a spook  aren t you 
if i were  i d hardly
tell you  would i 
what agency did philippe work for 
when did he go to saigon 
a long time ago

the situation  surviving on
a few handfuls of rice   
on this famine stricken island
of lombok 
but it s the faces
you can t forget 
like images
in a recurring nightmare   
they just keep coming back 
haunted faces   
staring blankly back from the windows
of tumbledown hovels   
the hollow  lifeless eyes 
skin stretched tight across bones   
hands outstretched 
dull  listless eyes imploring 
i move as if in a dream   
through the agony
that is famine

bryant  jillian edith 
nationality  british 
born  1938  under the sign of pisces 
i must be mad 
occupation 
assistant to military attaché   
british embassy  jakarta 
former postings 
brussels  singapore 
little religious feeling   
yet has a reverence for life 
this is a spirit
like a wavering flame   
which only needs care
to burn high 
if this does not happen  she could
lapse into the promiscuity   
and bitterness
of the failed romantic 
what s funny 
you re looking pooped  kid 
good luck to you 
they re only jealous 
i hear she really
turns it on  huh 
that what you heard 
you saw it 
the guy s a lunatic 
i think our boy s in love 
okay  start her up 
switch her off 
yes  sir 
why london 
  why are you transferrin  there 
  why do you want to go to saigon 
it s the center of things 
i ll be able to find out what s really
going on in the world   
not have to read about it
in the yellow press like most people 
why don t you stay 
why should i 
hmm  mr  hamilton 
what is it 
you re soaking 
what is it  what s wrong 
we got a coded message through
from singapore this morning 
a ship left shanghai a few days ago
with arms for the p k i 
civil war 
yes 
i m not giving you some scoop 
i want you to save your life 
  i know  but you can t expect   
  lf the p k i  take over   
they ll slaughter
every european in jakarta 
i can get you out on a plane 
  i ll talk to ralph 
  no  jill  i m staying 
nothing will keep the communists
and the muslims apart now 
not even sukarno 
i wonder how they re
gonna get the stuff in 
probably a port up north 
yeah  they ll come in up north 
under a false bill of lading 
tennis rackets  toilet seats 
you can t use this 
then you shouldn t have told me 
hello  billy 
what are you doing here 
waiting for you 
should be more work for you soon 
i m trackin  something down 
  about an arms shipment 
  jill told you 
getting nowhere on it 
you shouldn t even be looking 
why not 
she told you in confidence 
the same as she told me 
if you break the story 
everyone will know it came from her 
  i ll only run it with my own evidence 
  that should ease your conscience 
everyone will still know
where it came from 
i can t let a story
like that just lie 
i m not running any story until
i get independent confirmation 
that s the best i can do 
if the communists have the slightest
idea what you re after  you re dead 
when that arms shipment comes in 
this whole country blows up 
i m talking to you 
if i don t follow
something like this   
i might as well go
and grow watermelons 
you have changed 
you are capable of betrayal 
is it possible
i was wrong about you 
you abuse your position as journalist
and grow addicted to risk 
you attempt to rule neat lines
around yourself   
making a fetish of your career   
and making all relationships
temporary   
lest they disturb that career 
why can t you give yourself 
why can t you learn to love 
a shipment that size does not come into
the country without somebody noticing 
perhaps there is no such shipment 
no such shipment 
  come back in two days 
  keep an eye peeled 
be careful who you talk to
about this matter 
i m not p k i  
but i might have been 
  no luck  boss 
  not a bloody thing 
  why are we stopped here 
  it s getting late 
  we ll have a rest and a swim 
  no  we got too much work to do 
tomorrow

is a friend  we stay here sometimes 
cheers 
i ll see you after siesta 
you are in old java now  boss 
you re p k i   aren t you 
my country suffers under a great weight
of poverty and corruption 
is it wrong to want to change that 
when the killing starts 
are you gonna be part of it 
  sometimes there s no other way 
  yeah  sure  kumar 
you must not ask anymore
about the shipment 
  you know when it s arriving 
  maybe it s already here 
  that s the confirmation i need 
  listen to me 
i am unimportant in the party 
even tiger lily s more highly placed 
they have a death list 
you are on it 
come on

people are out there fighting
in the streets for rice 
i shot some footage 
does anybody want it 
it s a temporary shortage 
why don t you tell them
the true story  gentlemen 
why don t you tell them that sukarno
makes empty speeches   
and builds monuments to his vanity
while his people starve to death 
tell them that he says 
 eat rats  
you were the one who told us
he was a great man 
he was  that s why
his betrayal is so hideous 
steady on  billy 
i ve never agreed with you   
on just how much the people
mean to sukarno 
the only thing he wanted to do for
his people was to go to bed with them 
the female ones  that is 
you re right  he does use his people
as objects of pleasure  but so do you 
only you do it with boys 
what did you say 
you little bastard
