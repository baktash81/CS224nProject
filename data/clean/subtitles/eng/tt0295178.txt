   i created a way for us to make
huge sums of legitimate money   
   and still maintain the ethics
and the business practices   
   of an evil organization 
i have turned us into a talent agency 
the hollywood talent agency 
  really 
  by charging a list clients 9 percent   
   rather than the traditional 10 percent 
we ve been able to sign such stars   
   as george clooney   
  ooh 
two  julia roberts   
  hey 
   and leo dicaprio 
 whispers 
leo 
and the best part of the whole scheme
is we all get our own assistants 
hi  i m number three 
 yells 
whoa 
i m really excited to be part of the team
here at hta 
very impressive  number two   
   but i finally have the perfect plan 
in the  70s  there lived
a dutch metallurgical hedonist   
   by the name of johann van der smut 
 yawns 
he loved gold so much   
   he even lost his genitalia
in an unfortunate smelting accident 
hence the name   
   goldmember 
 snoring 
he invented a cold fusion power unit   
   for a  tractor beam    
 tractor beam    
   powerful enough
to pull a meteor to earth 
the meteor was called   
    midas 22  
it s made of solid gold 
 whispers 
is he sleeping 
well  that s okay 
i guess mini me won t get any   
 yells
