important lesson you will ever learn   
   at penguin elementary 
does anyone know what that is

  it s our heartsong  miss 
  thank you  gloria  excellent  yes 
without our heartsong 
we can t be truly penguin  can we 
no 
but  my dears  it s not something
that i can actually teach you 
does anybody know why 
anyone  anyone 
you can t teach it to us  ma am   
   because we have to find
our heartsongs all by ourselves 
well done  you 
it s the voice you hear inside   
   who you truly are 
yes  thank you  gloria 
excellent  lovely  thank you 
so let s all be very still now 
take a moment and let it come to you

really get jiggy with that  lovely 
i m ready  i got one 
oh  i thought you might  gloria 
midnight creeps so slowly
into hearts of those
who need more than they get
daylight deals a bad hand
to a penguin
who has laid too many bets
that s as far as i got so far 
  oh  yes  lovely  really lovely 
  that s beautiful 
well  mumble  since
you seem so keen to share 
mine s sort of a boom and a 
and another boom 
you heard that in there 
  do you like it 
  i m afraid that s not a tune 
  it s not 
  no  dear  a tune is like 
oh  okay 
who is that 
that is the offspring of memphis
and norma jean 
the wee hippity hopper 
it s not funny 
no  no  not in the least 
a penguin without a heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all 
i think he broke my ear 
in all my years  i ve never  i mean   
and you having such fine voices 
well  it s bizarre 
did anything happen  you know 
during early development 
no  all fine  normal incubation 
  right 
  wasn t it  honey 
yeah  yeah  it was a tough winter 
i guess 
right  right 
  he did hatch a little late   
  yes  i understand  yes 
  to think he might spend his life alone   
  quite  quite 
   never to meet his one true love 
oh  please  miss viola 
isn t there something we can do 
well  there is always mrs  astrakhan 
mrs  astrakhan 
if anyone can  mrs  astrakhan can 
can t sing 
can t sing  rubbish  darling 
every little penguin has a song 
when i have finished   
   your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple 
now  to begin 
first  we must find a feeling 
happy feeling  sad feeling 
maybe lonely feeling 
you feel it 
good  now  let it out 
be spontaneous 
that  what is that 
i m being spontan you us 
darling  you want to meet beautiful girl 
you want to make the egg 
oh  yes 
well  sing  and no jiggy jog 
do not move muscle 
no moving 
twinkle  twinkle  little star
enough 
okay  we go back to the top 
forget body  look inside soul 
feel the feeling  enormous feeling 
so enormous it fills whole body 
it must escape or you explode 
  now  open your little beak 
  come on 
yes  yes  lift up the head  that s it 
now    now   
now
disaster  catastrophe 
i never fail before 
never  never

   umph  
  that s right  a great big  umph  
i m going fishing 
oh  mumble 
that first hard summer   
    while his mom and dad
were working overtime   
    on the great commute to the sea   
    mumble found a place
away from disapproving eyes   
    where a funky little fella
could be himself 
hey  what you doing there  flipper bird 
nothing  what are you doing 
nothing  just dropped in
for a little lunch 
there s food  here 
leg or wing 
oh  no  no  wait  not me  i m a penguin 
exactly  the flipper birds 
that s you  eat the fish 
the flying birds  that s me

and lately  there ain t a lot of fish 
  so   
  this time i m getting the juicy bits 
  me first 
  hey  you want a piece of me 
hey  hey  hey 
i m trying to think about lunch 
wait  watch this 
yeah  that s weird  all right  listen 
for once  we re gonna do this civilized 
  now  get in line   
  hey  what s that on your leg 
  what  this little thing 
  oh  no  don t start him on that 
shut up  the little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question 
  a question like that deserves an answer 
  here we go 
i got two words for you 
 alien abduction  
  oh  you had to ask 
  have mercy 
quiet 
now  little buddy 
there is something out there 
creatures  not like us 
bigger  fiercer  and smarter too 
  ask me how i know 
  how 
because i ve been captured by them 
that s how 
unbelievable 
what do you mean  unbelievable  
it s true 
i m sitting on a rock 
minding my own business   
   when suddenly  they re onto me 
these beings  like big ugly penguins 
fat  flabby faces with front ways eyes   
   no feathers  no beaks 
and these    these appendages 
they probe me  they tie me up 
they strap me down 
they take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me 
and then  blackout 
gosh 
i woke up and there s this   
this thing on me 
every flying bird is dissing me 
 hey  what s happening  yellow leg  
it was humiliating 
and then what 
it was humiliating 
what more do you want 
they could have eated you 
yeah  yeah 
i guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature 
can i appeal to your better nature

paying no mind to his dancing heart   
    the kid saw out his school days
at the back of the class   
    lost in his imaginings 
now it s dark and i m   
what fabulous worlds lay out there 
far beyond the ice 
i won t be afraid
was there any place   
    where one small penguin
without a heartsong   
    could ever truly belong 
in my room
and so  a thousand generations ago   
   our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers

behold  noah  look 
this was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising 
stop  stop 
stop this unruly nonsense 
stop it right now 
a little self control  if you please 
you bring this disorder  this aberration 
to the very heart of our community 
have you lost your minds 
  we re just having fun 
  harmless fun 
 harmless   it is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us 
excuse me  smiley  can you speak
plain penguin  please 
he thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me 
do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we re in harmony 
when you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways   
   you offend the great  guin 
you invite him to withhold his bounty 
  he rules the seasons 
  he giveth and he can taketh away 
wait a minute 
happy feet can t cause a famine 
if thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it  then what did 
i think it comes from outside 
way beyond the ice 
there are things out there 
things we don t understand 
  mysteries 
  mind boggling mysteries 
  mystic beings 
  yeah  aliens 
  he s mad 
  no  aliens 
  i hear they re smart 
  he s insane 
no  they might be smarter than all of us 
who knows 
he drove the fish away 
now he s ranting this rubbish 
  hey  let me tell something to you 
  don t touch me  you filthy vermin 
  hey  watch it 
  and so it follows 
dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom 
  you  mumble happy feet  must go 
  hear  hear 
don t you take one step  sweetheart 
you have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools 
norma jean  i ll deal with this 
pa 
mumble  you must renounce
your so called friends   
   your peculiar thoughts 
your strange ways 
  memphis 
  if we are devout   
   sincere in our praise 
the fish will return 
  but  pa   
  listen  boy  i was a backslider myself 
i was careless
and now we re paying the price 
what s this got to do with mumble 
  it s why he is the way he is 
  there s nothing wrong with him 
  face it  our son s all messed up 
  he s not messed up  hear me 
  believe me  i know 
  how can you say that 
because when he was just an egg 
i dropped him 
memphis 
mumble 
oh  my poor little mumble 
but  mom  i m perfectly fine 
  no  no  you re not  boy 
  that s right 
for all our sakes  you must stop
this freakiness with the feet 
your father speaks wisely 
heed his suffering heart and repent 
but it just doesn t make any sense 
then your arrogance leaves us no choice 
no  wait 
please  son  you can do this 
it ain t so hard 
don t ask me to change  pa 
because i can t 
and that  my brethren  is the end of it

the great  guin didn t put things
out of whack  the aliens did 
a fool returns this day
to mock our suffering

we were happy with
the joy the day would bring
i wish those days
would come back once more
come back those days  those days
come back  don t go
come here  babe  come on back 
come on back
  come on back
  come on back
  come on back
  come on back
i love them  i love them
i love them  i love them
those days  those days
those days  those days
those days
