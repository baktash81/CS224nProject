it was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander
that we avoided total annihilation 
we ve been preparing for them to come back 
ever since 
the international fleet decided
that the world s smartest children
are the planet s best hope 
raised on war games  their decisions
are intuitive  decisive  fearless 
i am one of those recruits 
i ve watched through his eyes 
i ve listened through his ears
and i tell you  he s the one 
that s what you said about his brother 
brother tested out impossible for other reasons
    nothing to do with his tactical abilities 
  i gotcha  i gotcha 
  try there    go back 
he s gonna crush  em 
god  
  you can t do that 
  you ve got to use what is around you 
no no 
i had you all the way through the belt 
you might have calculated your trajectory
wrong due to the incoming asteroids 
don t   lecture me  wiggin 
you cheated 
it was a good game   
thanks 
hey 
play again 
sorry 
tomorrow  maybe 
you see  he s got a talent for strategy 
his humility could be false 
part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing
an ego driven opponent 
which makes him even smarter 
he may be a genius but we need someone
the others will follow   a leader 
he can t win on his own 
well  let s see how he handles rejection 
andrew wiggin  andrew    ender wiggin   
please report to the infirmary 
ender wiggin to the infirmary 
  hello ender 
  hello 
that nasty monitor is coming out today 
please  lie face down 
am i off the program 
  did i do something wrong 
  that s not really for me to say 
lie down 
the sooner we get this done 
the sooner you can move on 
ready 
this won t hurt a bit 
where do you think you re going  wiggin 
washed out  huh 
  come on 
  come on  get him in there 
come on  chief    one on one 
for real this time 
  no games 
  he s got no monitor now 
no one wants you now  wiggin 
one on one 
then why are your boys holding me 
let s go 
come on  man 
  stay down 
  i m gonna kill you  chief      
take it easy  ender 
you might be thinking of
ganging up on me   
but just remember what i do to people
who try to hurt me 
he said i was cheating   
he said that was why i was off the program 
and i kept on kicking him   
  doesn t matter 
     even after he was down 
  he will never bully you again 
  all i could think was   
   what would peter do 
  i m just like him  now 
  no  no  you re nothing like him ender 
nothing like whom 
  i thought you had a game 
  rained out   
  what s he crying about 
  i m not crying 
my monitor s gone  now i m just like you 
you mean mom   dad spent all that money on a third
and now he s off the program  too 
stop it  peter  he made it farther than either of us 
hey  drop out 
remember how to play formics and astronauts 
  that s it  where is mom 
  no  don t 
  i ll play 
  put the mask on    you can be the bug 
  peter  you re sick 
  stay out of this  valentine 
  okay bug  you started it  you attack first 
  let me in 
  come on  fight back  at last  we ve got one of you alive 
  peter  stop 
you know  i could kill you just like this 
  please 
  i should ve been chosen 
deep space intel shows us that the
number of enemy ships already
deployed is 10 times those
we faced during the first invasion 
the formics are rebuilding and strengthening
their fleet  we must conquer or die 
turn it off please  john 
why  you d rather not know
what s going on in the world 
we must never again bear witness
to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people
i d rather you talk to your son 
our survival demands total commitment
to the destruction of the enemy   
if you want  i ll go away 
so you don t have to be embarrassed 
ender  no one is embarrassed 
i am a third 
i should never have been born 
no  we wanted you  ender 
we just needed permission 
john  please say something 
it s a tough program  ender 
when they brought me to this country 
there was less competition and still i didn t make it 
you have nothing to be ashamed of   
   nothing 
 sensor alert  front door   
please state your name  
colonel hyrum graff  director of training  international fleet 
this is my colleague  major anderson  may we 
why d you keep kicking him 
you had already won the fight 
  did you enjoy it 
  no 
then why  speak up  son 
knocking him down was the first fight 
i wanted to win all the next ones  too 
so they d leave me alone 
don t you think you should have
asked a grown up for help 
nonsense  he can fight his own battles 
colonel  he was obviously being bullied and he defended himself 
son   
i d like to offer you a place in our program 
but you took away my monitor 
the final step in our evaluation is always to
see what happens when the monitor is removed 
and he passed 
he put a child in the hospital 
it s not what he did  it s why he did it 
it was tactical  a strategy to stop future attacks 
andrew  you don t have to do this 
ender and i should have
a private conversation 
  absolutely not 
  with all respect sir  you really can t stop me 
formics might have wiped us
out the last time  you know 
a brilliant commander is the
only thing that saved us 
mazer rackham 
mazer rackham 
we need minds like yours  ender 
young people integrate complex data more easily than adults 
will the monitor be reinstalled 
no 
you graduated 
to battle school 
privacy rights are restored 
if there s a chance  because of you  the formics
might leave us alone forever   
then i have to ask you to come with me 
it s what i was born for  right 
valentine was too compassionate for battle school 
my brother peter washed out
because he was too quick to violence 
colonel graff said i needed to find a balance
between those emotions if i were to succeed 
join the others 
go on 
  you re late 
  out of my control 
i m ender 
ender 
what kind of name is that 
what s your name 
name is bean 
  bean 
  grew up on the streets  not with a bean       
  i m gonna be   
  bag  give him the bag 
close the bag 
  you alright 
  yeah 
what re you doing  wiggin 
  nothing  sir 
  something funny 
i asked you a question  launchy 
sir  the way you re floating  horizontally 
i thought that was funny 
really  why 
because in zero gravity  there is no right side up 
you may think you re vertical and we may be horizontal 
  is that funny 
  sir  no sir 
yes  it is 
alai  you know what he is talking about 
  yes  sir 
  no  you don t 
there s only one kid on this launch
with any brains at all so far   
   and that s ender wiggin 
 all new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation  the yellow lights  
 all new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation  the yellow lights  
so you made them hate me 
i told them you were the best 
we need a julius caesar  a napoleon 
we hope that would be you 
  caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted 
  napoleon lost in the end 
not before he conquered the known world 
  dismissed 
  yes  sir 
he has a complicated response to authority 
he wants to please the overbearing father figure
but resents the lack of reciprocated affection 
his isolation can never be broken
and he must never believe anyone will help him 
oh look  it s the smartass 
thanks 
thought i d have to ask to be by the door 
 state your name  
  ender wiggin 
  don t freeze your balls  kid 
  attention on deck 
at ease 
listen up  launchies 
my name is sergeant james dap  ask me a
legitimate question and i will give you a direct answer  
but if you are looking for a shoulder
to cry on  use your pillow 
  do i look like i m joking  snots 
  sir  no  sir 
good 
you are to work as a team  
you will all make this bunkroom  your home 
you will keep your home clean 
there are separate showers for both sexes 
if you are found in an area not designated to your gender 
i will personally neuter you 
  am i clear 
  class is in five  follow the yellow lights 
yellow like your cowardly selves 
welcome to battle school 
a great responsibility rests on each of you 
when the enemy first invaded  we were not ready 
millions of innocent lives were lost 
that must never be allowed to happen again 
we threw everything we had at the invaders 
and in the midst of that decisive battle 
a legendary hero emerged 
we will never forget what the enemy did
but we defeated them 
and we will do so again 
let the courage of mazer rackham
be your inspiration 
wakey wakey 
rise and shine 
put on your battle room suits
that s the padded one with the helmet and the weapon 
do not attempt to fire the weapon 
holster it  let s move it launchies  you ve got 10 minutes 
at ease 
this is the battle room 
in here  the floor s been designed
to create an earth like gravitational pull 
step through that gate
and you are in a zero g environment 
wiggin 
get up here 
  what do i do now  sir 
  go on in 
alright now  push off 
nicely done 
these guys are still trying to
stay up the way they came in 
but like you said in the shuttle 
there is no up or down in space 
but we ll need some way
to orientate in here   
   maybe the enemy s gate is down 
  i get it  like they re a bug to be
crushed under our feet 
  what do you think this does 
  let s find out 
whoa  won t acts harmless         
  what do you think it does when it hits the suit 
  good question 
  shoot me in the leg 
  we shoot each other  same time 
ready 
  whoa  my leg s frozen 
  mine too 
i can t bend my knee   
shoot me in the chest   
come on  i m getting away 
  this is amazing   
i can t move at all now 
that s enough 
you re flapping around like
a bunch of drunken ducks 
if you expect to compete with the
other teams in this school   
    you ve got a lot to learn 
sergeant  explain the game 
you will train to compete as a team
against other teams 
you get 1 point for a hit to a limb 
six for a torso hit
  which will immobilize you completely     
   but if either side gets one cadet
through the enemy s gate unharmed   
   that army will win 
regardless of points already scored 
  am i clear 
  sir  yes sir 
dear valentine  so this is battle school   
every day  hours of training   
   and far more homework
than we ever had on earth 
we train in hand to hand combat   
   it keeps us in shape   
   and aggressive 
  and up  and one  two 
  i feel peter in me whenever i fight   
  wiggin 
    i wish i didn t 
we ve been studying formic flight
patterns for three months now    
   they seem entirely random 
the truth is
we really don t understand our enemy   
   and no one ever adequately explains how mazer rackham
actually defeated the entire fleet 
the colonel said he expects me to lead
but how  what makes a good leader 
everyone here is very different 
so many many things to learn 
always very little sleep 
please write back 
i haven t heard from you   
how are you 
is peter behaving 
are you getting my e mails  i miss   
attention on deck 
evening  launchies  at ease 
i m pleased to see that most
of you are performing well   
   as you know  competition for
command school is tough   
   some in the higher ranks have failed to
meet our standards and are being sent home 
so    i may have the opportunity
to promote some of you 
look to your left 
look to your right 
these are not your friends 
they are competition 
  keep up the hard work 
  ten shun 
sir 
is our email being blocked 
it s just that none of us
received any replies from home 
all communication is being
temporarily held back 
  why sir 
  launchy  it is not your place   
your families will not understand
what we re doing here   
   and none of you need the distraction
of their replies 
i thought our privacy rights
had been restored  sir 
you have the right to privately
think whatever you wish  wiggin 
but there s too much at stake to allow your
unfiltered thoughts  
   to leave this facility 
yes  sir 
keep it up snot  and you will
never make it to command school 
  i thought it was a legitimate question 
  what 
  you said if we have a legitimate question   
  drop and give me twenty 
  you think you re the smartest kid in the school 
  no  sir 
  you will never be a commander 
i will never salute you 
  yes you will  sergeant 
  give me twenty more 
get up 
you do not speak unless spoken to 
am i clear 
sir  yes  sir 
  even if i have a legitimate question 
  shut it  wiggin 
now go to sleep  all of you 
you heard him 
get some sleep 
we ve only 3 passing scores on
the deep space navigation test 
alai  bean and ender 
what happened here 
  they re probably cheating 
  your mother cheated that s why you look like a plumber 
  zip it       you think this is a game 
  no  ma am 
  we are preparing for war 
  yes  ma am 
now the problem was simple   
how do you slingshot your forces   
   into an attack position
on the blind side of this moon   
   using the gravitational pull from this planet 
this is basic rocket science  people 
ender  get down here and explain 
ma am  i think bean or alai
have a better hang on this than i do 
all right 
alai  come and explain 
ma am  we aim to approach the planet
in the direction it s moving   
     that way we benefit from it s energy of motion 
  something   
  go on  alai 
  of course  there s a moon we have to pass here 
that complicates things 
because the moon s moving in
the opposite direction to us 
we get a gravitational break in   
who sent this 
who sent what  bernard 
nothing 
oh 
  if you can t take it bernard  don t dish it out 
  yes  ma am

  let me be clear 
i intend to trade you a s a p 
my army is undefeated in the last 21 battles   
   i might try to make it to
command school within 6 months   
   you can get your training

  he s all heart 
  shut it  nica       
watch your mouth  mick 
here s the deal  snot   
   when we go into battle  you will not pass
through the gates until all my soldiers are through   
   then  you will remain just inside the gates 
with your weapon undrawn and unfired till the game ends 
  so i must do nothing 
  you re to keep out of the way 
you bunk in the back of the room 
you know  bonzo
doesn t like to lose   
   he doesn t want an untrained launchy
screwing up his perfect maneuvers   
   but the battle room is open 24 7  during
free time  i could show you some moves 
ready 
   3    2    1 
impressive 
your turn

you need half a second to recharge 
  at least you don t have any bad habits 
  i don t have any good ones  either 
i ll give you those 
relax 
further your target  the longer
you have to hold the beam 
fire 
leave it longer 
   it s the difference between a tenth and a half second
but in battle  that s a long time   
aim  fire  hold  recharge 
that s it 
learn where your trigger actually
fires and ride the edge 
now you re getting it 
3    2    1

you said the game would reveal
his state of mind  not grow with it 
how did his psycho
brother end up in the game 
  he s obviously feeling some psychological pressure   
  of course he s feeling pressure  anderson   
   this is a boot camp  for kids who
are gonna have to face a real enemy 
the game is a thought relationship between the child
and the computer  together they create stories   
then change the story 
this story s written by the child s
emotional reality  i can t change that 
i don t know how these images
got into the game 
erase the game 
you ve done well 
very well 
top test scores in class 
highest battle room ratings 
but you have a habit of
upsetting your commander 
i find it hard to respect someone
just because they outrank me  sir 
  puts you in a difficult position 
doesn t it 
you don t like taking orders from bonzo 
no  sir 
perhaps you d prefer to give them yourself 
  sir 
  how d you like to lead
sir  i ve never heard of a dragon army 
we discontinued the name four years ago 
no dragon army ever won a battle 
  then why not a new name  sir

  we can t let you go 
  you ve come so far   
  and i wanna talk to my sister 
the fleet owns you  ender 
strategos would never allow it 
send me home colonel 
or i will resign 
don t threaten me  boy 
i m not the enemy 
i m not so sure 
i won t play this game anymore 
i quit 
what are you gonna do 
waste millions on a loser 
you wanted to see me 
you can t resign 
you have an obligation to stay here
my father trained horses  i ve raised
yearlings since i was 5 years old 
i know a thoroughbred when i see one 
we can t lose him 
my god  you really don t see
them as children  do you 
it used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15 
when the war is over 
we can have the luxury of debating the
when it s over 
what will be left of the boy 
what does it matter
if there s nothing left at all 
we re using these children to win the war 
and if they come home  it s my job to put them back together again 
thanks for what you ve done 
where s ender 
  hello valentine 
  why are you here  did something happen 
i need you to take a ride with me 
he s gonna be happy to see you 
c mon  you just want him to re enlist 
i want him to save lives 
what about his life 
been sitting by bonzo s bed   
   waiting for him to recover   
   he may never wake up 
  ender  he attacked first 
  and i fought back 
i ve had a lot of fights  val 
i ve won because i  ve always
understood what my enemy thinks 
  but when i truly understand them   
  you also love them 
i think it s impossible to truly understand
someone and not love them the way they love themselves 
but in that moment   
  you beat them 
  i destroy them 
i make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again 
ender  they want me
to talk you into going back 
  i told them i won t cooperate 
  i don t think you are hiding here just because you care about bonzo 
i think you re hiding because you re afraid 
afraid you don t know your enemy   
   afraid you might lose  but   
   but what if you are the
next mazer rackham 
you can t hide here forever 
if you sit here   
   if you don t try    we will all be lost 
i ll miss you 
i ll miss you too 
i need to know that you will
not block my e mails again 
attention  prepare for transporter
docking operations 
i thought we were going
back to battle school 
  we re not 
  where are we going 
much further 
 dear valentine   
   i must now travel to our advance command base near the formics home planet
where i ll begin final training 
if successful  i ll command
the entire invasion fleet 
i wish there was another way   
   but war seems inevitable 
stay safe 
love 
ender  
not very hospitable  is it 
we took it from the formics 
27 years after rackham s victory 
flushed them out of these tunnels
like rats from a sewer   
   drove them all the way back to their home planet 
  how long did they live here 
  we re not sure   
   this was a forward staging post
for their invasion of earth 
built our base here to be
closer to their home planet
to allow instantaneous communication
by ansible with our attack fleet 
if they re on their home planet 
do we have them contained 
  for now 
  if we have them boxed in 
for the same reason that you kept kicking
that bully before i recruited you 
the purpose of this war
is to prevent all future wars 
your training begins first thing
tomorrow morning 
sergeant dap will show you
to your quarters 
yes  sir 
we re still reseeding the atmosphere   
   it s breathable  but thin 
in the event of an evacuation 
two breaths every minute from one of these
will compensate for lower levels
of surface oxygen 
lights out in five 
who are you 
look this may be amusing to you 
but they ll come looking for me 
you want to fight me  is that the test 
to see if i ll attack an old man 
well  i won t 
i ll just sit this one out 
  okay  you win 
  since when do you tell the enemy when he s won 
i surprised you once  why didn t you
destroy me immediately after 
  i thought you were a teacher 
  there is no teacher but the enemy 
enemy will tell you where you re weak 
where he s strong  from now on  i am your enemy  got it 
yes 
good 
during training  i will devise
the strategy of your enemy 
remember he is stronger than you  from
now on  you are always about to lose 
sir 
do you have a name 
mazer rackham 
what  you thought i was dead 
sir   
   i ve been building models of your plane
since i was six years old 
i have a question  sir 
on the vids    they always cut out right
after you destroy the one carrier 
why 
get dressed 
sir  i ve already seen this 
i wanna know what happens after 
just watch 
after the explosion cleared   
   everything was incredibly still 
their ships just stopped shooting 
then they started falling out of the sky 
scroll back  please 
to just after you lost your wingman 
there  play back  please 
you took cover in the cloud   
   you couldn t see anything   
   so you must have been using your hud 
there  stop 
you saw something 
what did you see in your hud 
very good  ender 
thermal imaging from the satellite 
the enemy is in red 
what pattern do you see 
it seems random   
but it s not 
there s an epicenter 
there 
really 
you took out that one particular ship 
and the rest just   
   gave up 
why 
to what animals are the formics most often compared 
  ants 
  which have   
a queen   
   who directs the worker ants 
what she thinks  they do 
without her  they can t think for themselves   
and they die 
  you destroyed the queen s ship   
  i must have  yes 
  but you can t be certain 
  no 
the soviet      hegemon insisted
we keep it classified 
that s why they never
showed the rest of the battle 
or my face 
to the world  i m dead 
colonel 
your face 
you mean why is it marked 
my father was a maori   
    lost him in the war 
 tä moko    
is a way to connect to my past 
it s a way for me to speak for the dead 
sir 
  have you ever seen a queen 
  no  no one has 
but if the formics have rebuilt their
fleet  there must be more than one queen 
yes  of course       
what happened when you attacked here 
  did you find one 
  no 
why did they come 
water 
attention 
officer on deck 
  hey bean 
  ho commander 
petra 
we thought you were iced  we were
gonna have to have dink take over   
that was never gonna happen 
  salaam  alai 
  salaam  commander 
  bernard 
  good to see you  sir 
at ease 
while you ve been skinny dipping 
the colonel s been flogging us to death on the simulator 
alright  take your seats 
in a matter of weeks  we may be called on to fight
a real battle  let s bring your commander up to speed 
our latest probe images will give you an idea
of what s happening on the enemy planet 
like us  they appear to have a
population growth rate that s unsustainable 
for now  they re contained on their planet 
but time is not on our side 
where are they 
high surface temperatures limit their
above ground activity to just a few hours a day 
what s most alarming    
   is the rate at which their military power is expanding 
but they ve not yet moved against us 
no 
they re planning to colonize another planet 
before they breed themselves into extinction 
our orders are to defeat them before
they pose an irreversible threat 
their very existence is a threat 
is that clear  commander 
  clear  sir 
  good 
carry on  colonel 
we will begin with fighter real      simulations
that best approximate real battles 
you will command overall strategy 
your toon leaders will each command a battle group 
you will issue orders to them   
   they will issue orders to their squadron to drone pilots 
finally  your entire fleet must support  
protect your most important asset   
    70 billion of pure destruction   
   the md 500   
   which petra is trained to fire 
  md 
  molecular detachment device  
   we call her the  little doctor  
particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels   
   at the focus point  they
reach critical effective mass 
chain reaction spreads outwards 
shattering molecular bonds 
leaves nothing standing 
that s the beauty of the  little doctor  
no need to identify the
specific ship of the queen   
   the chain reaction takes
out the entire swarm 
but i ll only get one shot 
once the formics see how she works 
they won t come together again 
you will have to win this
war  one battle at a time 
once our battle fleet is detected entering the formic solar
system  we will have no alternative but to engage   
   i trust we have chosen our commander well 
  there s greatness in him  sir 
  a killer instinct  too  i hope 
absolutely 
let s hope he s all you claim him to be 
we ll be with you soon 
good night 
good night  sir 
 dear valentine    
   so this is command school 
i m finally here 
being a third  i ve always been so afraid i might fail   
   that i might not measure up   
they made me a leader 
and i promise you that i ll do
everything i can to win this war 
i know if anything ever happened to you 
i would never forgive myself  
what are they doing 
harvesting water 
if you re gonna use me 
i need to be closer 
too risky  let s not reveal our best weapon
on what should be an easy attack 
alai  bean 
your droids peel away 
track them from below the ice
and read their path       
they re swarming 
they see us 
deploy all drones  give me four
isobaric formations with 90 degree offsets 
open fire 
alai  on my count  fire directly up into the ice 
good strategem       
   3    2    1 
now 
as our training progresses  the simulations
are becoming more and more complex  and real 
the pressure to win  day after day   
month after month   is intense 
we get very little sleep   
   somedays it s hard to keep up 
  i got the breakaway 
  great work  bean 
squadrons 43 through 57  switch to
quadrant foxtrot 3889 
ender  watch our right flank 
we need backup for bernard 
i see it 
  bernard  you flank them 
  copy that  using 10 through 18 
alai  to your right 
dink  compensate for the pull of
planet g8 and go full throttle 
bean  pop up and sync to  sierra       
i could        lima  
do  sierra  now 
bernard  watch your speed 
dink  you re closing too fast 
  you said full throttle 
  pull back now  dink 
gahh 
you can t absorb these kind of losses  war isn t
a game where you get to reboot and start over 
sir  i can t win if i don t take any risks 
nobody s saying not to take risks   
   just don t try and control everything 
bean improvised on the mop ups 
you focus on the big picture 
delegate more to your teams 
my teams are burned out   
   how can they be effective
if they don t get any sleep 
sleep deprivation is part of your training 
a battle with the formics could last for days 
if i d been smarter  i could have annihilated petra s
little doctor while you were micro managing bean 
that can t happen  understand 
  yes  sir 
  do you 
cause i ve trained others  each one so hopeful 
each one ultimately a failure 
alright  colonel 
he understands 
  so i am not the first 
  no 
but you will be the last 
there is no time to train anyone else 
so tomorrow colonel rackham
will run your final simulation 
what if i win tomorrow  what happens 
you ll be ready  to face the real enemy 
and you ll be the finest commander
we ve ever trained 
one more simulation 
then i may have to go to war 
what happens when it s no longer a game 
real war is different  i still know nothing about my enemy 
what if they could talk to us 
  they can t  dissections show no vocal cords 
  there are other ways to communicate 
ender  this is not a conversation
we should be having at 1 a m 
what if they could  think  to one another 
what if we could  think  to them 
you need to sleep 
we ve a graduation battle tomorrow 
right 
  we re gonna get crushed 
  we won t get crushed  we have you 
  goodnight petra 
  goodnight ender 
you still think he s the one 
we re committed  this boy has the
empathy to think like a formic   
   understand them  and anticipate them 
he s not ready 
we re never ready 
you know when you re ready enough 
easy  sir 
it s graduation day 
good luck  sir 
attention 
at ease 
sir 
we have an audience 
commander wiggin 
the strategos is here today to
witness your final simulation 
if you are successful  he will endorse your
promotion to battle commander of the entire fleet 
yes  sir 
this simulation is based around
the enemy s home planet 
good luck  commander 
thank you  sir 
stay calm 
shoot straight 
here we go 
  they re waiting 
  maybe they think we come in peace 
i don t think mazer intends for
us to find a diplomatic solution 
what s he waiting for 
just give him a minute 
ender  what do we do 
ender 
the enemy s gate   is down 
petra  you re up 
they re spread too wide
for a chain reaction 
  she s right 
  just let him follow his instinct 
all battle groups  deploy
drones  protect your carriers 
alai  you re squadron five 
engage 
this is suicidal 
oh crap  they re swarming 
close enough for you now  petra 
once i fire  i need time to recharge 
understood 
go for the center 
fire now 
  whoo  she did it 
  yeah 
give me full scalar      
we re not done yet 
  but we are so screwed 
  no  we re not 
  charged  petra 
  no  i need 2 minutes 
  all fighters fall back and surround her ship 
  copy that 
i want rings within rings  layers
upon layer  every fighter we have 
  ender  you re gonna leave our transporters defenseless 
  if we re gonna win this battle  dink 
when the outer layer is hit  the rest will continue
to drift with us like a shield  do it now 
he s abandoning his entire fleet 
he s in command 
there s no stopping him now 
90 seconds  ender 
no  no  no  i m losing my carriers 
my dreadnoughts are out 
i don t care about dreadnoughts 
just protect petra 
like we protected alai when we fought bonzo 
i hope you know what you re doing 
  ready  petra 
  60 seconds  what am i aiming for 
the planet 
what 
we destroy the planet 
we destroy the queens 
game over 
ender  my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight 
we will clear a path 
all fighters maintain a clockwise rotation 
focus all firepower forward 
  ender  we re entering the atmosphere 
  we need to slow down 
we can t  we re one unit now 
we re not equipped to handle the heat
of passing through an atmosphere 
our drones are our heat shield 
keep falling  let gravity do the work 
this shield won t hold forever 
we don t need forever 
30 seconds 
i still don t have a clear shot 
we re burning up 
bean  on my count  accelerate the fighters from
the nose of the formation in a continuous stream 
  yes  sir 
  like bullets from a rifle 
we will drill a hole through the swarm 
  petra  you ll only get a second 
  that s all i need 
    3    2    1
now  bean 
shields have reached at 5        
now  petra 
now 
  10 seconds 
  they ve broken the shield 
fire petra 
we re out of time 
we did it 
how about that 
game over 
what s he saying 
restoring the ansible connection 
what is this 
why are we watching these images 
ender 
thank you 
brilliant  absolutely brilliant 
thank god for you  son 
why are these images
in the program 
ender   
   we won 
what do you mean   we won  
i beat him  
he runs the simulations 
he said it was a game 
it was them or us  ender 
there was no other way 
with this victory   
   you ve won all future battles 
you destroyed them   for all of us 
  stand down 
  move  move  please  move 
  ender   
  stay away from me 
you lied 
  son  we were afraid if we told you  you d  
  what  refuse to play 
  they attacked us 1st         
  no  they waited 
  what were they waiting for 
  who   cares  
we lost a thousand men on the
transporters you abandoned 
i abandoned them in order to win 
  yes    and they died proudly for us 
  they might not have died at all 
  if i d known it was real  i would ve   
  what  called for a dialogue 
  they can t even speak 
     watched them 
what were they thinking  were they building an army for a second invasion 
  or  or simply preparing to defend themselves   
  ender  stop      from us 
they came to earth to establish a colony 
we chased them away 
  and in fifty years  they never returned 
  it makes no difference now 
i will bear the shame
of this genocide  forever 
  no  you will be remembered as a hero 
  i will be remembered as a killer 
  it was us or them 
  and you re sure we ve killed every last one of them 
i saw their whole planet destroyed 
how do you know there isn t another
colony or another queen out there 
       we won  that s all that matters 
  no 
the way  we win  matters 
don t hurt him 
  go on  you need to let him rest 
  can i stay with him 
just so he s not alone   
please   
yes  of course   
c mon  let s let him rest 
   what if they could talk to us   
   what were they thinking   
valentine 
   what if we could think to them   
  valentine 
  ender 
ender  wait 
ender 
what are you doing  ender 
  i know what she wants 
  ender 
 warning  you are leaving an oxygen   balanced environment        
ender  stop 
it s not safe 
ender 
breathe  just breathe 
in my game  i saw this place 
what are you talking about 
the formics accessed the game through me 
their thoughts  my dreams 
all mixed together 
they were trying to communicate 
what are you doing 
go back 
no 
please 
i have to do this 
 dear valentine 
   i now know my dreams
were never my own 
they came from her 
she was always trying
to communicate with me 
i know the formics
better than any living soul 
i stole their future from them 
now i must find a way to make amends  
you re dying 
is it a queen 
i ll find her a new home 
i promise 
 i miss you  valentine 
you won t be hearing from me for a while 
i need to find out if i m
as gifted at peace as i am at war 
they ve rewarded me the rank of admiral
