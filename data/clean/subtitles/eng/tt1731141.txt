it was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander
that we avoided total annihilation
weve been preparing for them to come back
ever since
the international fleet decided
that the worlds smartest children
are the planets best hope
raised on wargames their decisions
are intuitive decisive fearless
i am one of those recruits
ive watched through his eyes
ive listened through his ears
and i tell you hes the one
thats what you said about his brother
brother tested out impossible for other reasons
nothing to do with his tactical abilities
i gotcha i gotcha
try there go back
hes gonna crush em
god
you cant do that
youve got to use what is around you
no no
i had you all the way through the belt
you might have calculated your trajectory
wrong due to the incoming asteroids
dont lecture me wiggin
you cheated
it was a good game
thanks
hey
play again
sorry
tomorrow maybe
you see hes got a talent for strategy
his humility could be false
part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing
an egodriven opponent
which makes him even smarter
he may be a genius but we need someone
the others will follow  a leader
he cant win on his own
well lets see how he handles rejection
andrew wiggin andrew ender wiggin
please report to the infirmary
ender wiggin to the infirmary
hello ender
hello
that nasty monitor is coming out today
please lie face down
am i off the program
did i do something wrong
thats not really for me to say
lie down
the sooner we get this done
the sooner you can move on
ready
this wont hurt a bit
where do you think youre going wiggin
washed out huh
come on
come on get him in there

no games
hes got no monitor now
no one wants you now wiggin
oneonone
then why are your boys holding me
lets go
come on man
stay down
im gonna kill you chief
take it easy ender
you might be thinking of
ganging up on me
but just remember what i do to people
who try to hurt me
he said i was cheating
he said that was why i was off the program
and i kept on kicking him
doesnt matter
even after he was down
he will never bully you again
all i could think was
what would peter do
im just like him now
no no youre nothing like him ender
nothing like whom
i thought you had a game
rained out
whats he crying about
im not crying
my monitors gone now im just like you
you mean mom  dad spent all that money on a third
and now hes off the program too
stop it peter he made it farther than either of us
hey drop out
remember how to play formics and astronauts
thats it where is mom
no dont
ill play
put the mask on you can be the bug
peter youre sick
stay out of this valentine
okay bug you started it you attack first
let me in
come on fight back at last weve got one of you alive
peter stop
you know i could kill you just like this
please
i shouldve been chosen
deep space intel shows us that the
number of enemy ships already
deployed is 10 times those
we faced during the first invasion
the formics are rebuilding and strengthening
their fleet we must conquer or die
turn it off please john
why youd rather not know
whats going on in the world
we must never again bear witness
to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people
id rather you talk to your son
our survival demands total commitment
to the destruction of the enemy
if you want ill go away
so you dont have to be embarrassed
ender no one is embarrassed
i am a third
i should never have been born
no we wanted you ender
we just needed permission
john please say something
its a tough program ender
when they brought me to this country
there was less competition and still i didnt make it
you have nothing to be ashamed of
nothing
sensor alert front door
please state your name
colonel hyrum graff director of training international fleet
this is my colleague major anderson may we
whyd you keep kicking him
you had already won the fight
did you enjoy it
no
then why speak up son
knocking him down was the first fight
i wanted to win all the next ones too
so theyd leave me alone
dont you think you should have
asked a grown up for help
nonsense he can fight his own battles
colonel he was obviously being bullied and he defended himself
son
id like to offer you a place in our program
but you took away my monitor
the final step in our evaluation is always to
see what happens when the monitor is removed
and he passed
he put a child in the hospital
its not what he did its why he did it
it was tactical a strategy to stop future attacks
andrew you dont have to do this
ender and i should have
a private conversation
absolutely not
with all respect sir you really cant stop me
formics might have wiped us
out the last time you know
a brilliant commander is the
only thing that saved us
mazer rackham
mazer rackham
we need minds like yours ender
young people integrate complex data more easily than adults
will the monitor be reinstalled
no
you graduated
to battle school
privacy rights are restored
if theres a chance because of you the formics
might leave us alone forever
then i have to ask you to come with me
its what i was born for right
valentine was too compassionate for battle school
my brother peter washed out
because he was too quick to violence
colonel graff said i needed to find a balance
between those emotions if i were to succeed
join the others
go on
youre late
out of my control
im ender
ender
what kind of name is that
whats your name
name is bean
bean
grew up on the streets not with a bean
im gonna be
bag give him the bag
close the bag
you alright
yeah
whatre you doing wiggin
nothing sir
something funny
i asked you a question launchy
sir the way youre floating horizontally
i thought that was funny
really why
because in zero gravity there is no right side up
you may think youre vertical and we may be horizontal
is that funny
sir no sir
yes it is
alai you know what he is talking about
yes sir
no you dont
theres only one kid on this launch
with any brains at all so far
and thats ender wiggin
all new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation the yellow lights
all new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation the yellow lights
so you made them hate me
i told them you were the best
we need a julius caesar a napoleon
we hope that would be you
caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted
napoleon lost in the end
not before he conquered the known world
dismissed
yes sir
he has a complicated response to authority
he wants to please the overbearing father figure
but resents the lack of reciprocated affection
his isolation can never be broken
and he must never believe anyone will help him
oh look its the smartass
thanks
thought id have to ask to be by the door
state your name
ender wiggin
dont freeze your balls kid
attention on deck
at ease
listen up launchies
my name is sergeant james dap ask me a
legitimate question and i will give you a direct answer
but if you are looking for a shoulder
to cry on use your pillow
do i look like im joking snots
sir no sir
good
you are to work as a team
you will all make this bunkroom your home
you will keep your home clean
there are separate showers for both sexes
if you are found in an area not designated to your gender
i will personally neuter you
am i clear
class is in five follow the yellow lights
yellow like your cowardly selves
welcome to battle school
a great responsibility rests on each of you
when the enemy first invaded we were not ready
millions of innocent lives were lost
that must never be allowed to happen again
we threw everything we had at the invaders
and in the midst of that decisive battle
a legendary hero emerged
we will never forget what the enemy did
but we defeated them
and we will do so again
let the courage of mazer rackham
be your inspiration
wakey wakey
rise and shine
put on your battle room suits
thats the padded one with the helmet and the weapon
do not attempt to fire the weapon
holster it lets move it launchies youve got 10 minutes
at ease
this is the battle room
in here the floors been designed
to create an earthlike gravitational pull
step through that gate
and you are in a zerog environment
wiggin
get up here
what do i do now sir
go on in
alright now push off
nicely done
these guys are still trying to
stay up the way they came in
but like you said in the shuttle
there is no up or down in space
but well need some way
to orientate in here
maybe the enemys gate is down
i get it like theyre a bug to be
crushed under our feet
what do you think this does
lets find out
whoa wont acts harmless
what do you think it does when it hits the suit
good question
shoot me in the leg
we shoot each other same time
ready
whoa my legs frozen
mine too
i cant bend my knee
shoot me in the chest
come on im getting away
this is amazing
i cant move at all now
thats enough
youre flapping around like
a bunch of drunken ducks
if you expect to compete with the
other teams in this school
youve got a lot to learn
sergeant explain the game
you will train to compete as a team
against other teams
you get 1 point for a hit to a limb
six for a torso hit
which will immobilize you completely
but if either side gets one cadet
through the enemys gate unharmed
that army will win
regardless of points already scored
am i clear
sir yes sir
dear valentine so this is battle school
every day hours of training
and far more homework
than we ever had on earth
we train in handtohand combat
it keeps us in shape
and aggressive
and up and one two
i feel peter in me whenever i fight
wiggin
i wish i didnt
weve been studying formic flight
patterns for three months now
they seem entirely random
the truth is
we really dont understand our enemy
and no one ever adequately explains how mazer rackham
actually defeated the entire fleet
the colonel said he expects me to lead
but how what makes a good leader
everyone here is very different
so many many things to learn
always very little sleep
please write back
i havent heard from you
how are you
is peter behaving
are you getting my emails i miss
attention on deck
evening launchies at ease
im pleased to see that most
of you are performing well
as you know competition for
command school is tough
some in the higher ranks have failed to
meet our standards and are being sent home
so i may have the opportunity
to promote some of you
look to your left
look to your right
these are not your friends
they are competition
keep up the hard work
tenshun
sir
is our email being blocked
its just that none of us
received any replies from home
all communication is being
temporarily held back
why sir
launchy it is not your place
your families will not understand
what were doing here
and none of you need the distraction
of their replies
i thought our privacy rights
had been restored sir
you have the right to privately
think whatever you wish wiggin
but theres too much at stake to allow your
unfiltered thoughts
to leave this facility
yes sir
keep it up snot and you will
never make it to command school
i thought it was a legitimate question
what
you said if we have a legitimate question
drop and give me twenty
you think youre the smartest kid in the school
no sir
you will never be a commander
i will never salute you
yes you will sergeant
give me twenty more
get up
you do not speak unless spoken to
am i clear
sir yes sir
even if i have a legitimate question
shut it wiggin
now go to sleep all of you
you heard him
get some sleep
weve only 3 passing scores on
the deep space navigation test
alai bean and ender
what happened here
theyre probably cheating
your mother cheated thats why you look like a plumber
zip it you think this is a game
no maam
we are preparing for war
yes maam
now the problem was simple
how do you slingshot your forces
into an attack position
on the blind side of this moon
using the gravitational pull from this planet
this is basic rocket science people
ender get down here and explain
maam i think bean or alai
have a better hang on this than i do
all right
alai come and explain
maam we aim to approach the planet
in the direction its moving
that way we benefit from its energy of motion
something
go on alai
of course theres a moon we have to pass here
that complicates things
because the moons moving in
the opposite direction to us
we get a gravitational break in
who sent this
who sent what bernard
nothing
oh
if you cant take it bernard dont dish it out
yes maam
welcome to games and recreation
cerebral control initiated
one is poison one is not
choose right and you go to fairyland
hes found the mind game
decide well punch or hell
ha ha
who authorized his access to this
i did
try again mickey mouse
to what end
not every battle can be won hyrum
reveals his state of mind if you
wont let me assess him oneonone
i need some other way to know
what hes feeling
i dont care how hes feeling
i want him to toughen up learn how to lead
but before we make him a leader
lets see how he deals with frustration
come on
oh dear
whatchu doin
playing a stupid game
no matter what i choose i die
its rigged
youre back one more time
can i watch
sure
one is poison one is not choose
right and you go to fairyland

command school within 6 months
you can get your training

hes all heart
shut it nica
watch your mouth mick
heres the deal snot
when we go into battle you will not pass
through the gates until all my soldiers are through
then you will remain just inside the gates
with your weapon undrawn and unfired till the game ends
so i must do nothing
youre to keep out of the way
you bunk in the back of the room
you know bonzo
doesnt like to lose
he doesnt want an untrained launchy
screwing up his perfect maneuvers
but the battle room is open 247 during
free time i could show you some moves

you need half a second to recharge
at least you dont have any bad habits

relax
further your target the longer
you have to hold the beam
fire
leave it longer
its the difference between a tenth and a half second

fires and ride the edge

valentine
how can you be in my game
well done
youre a killer now
nightmares launchy
keep em to yourself
you said the game would reveal
his state of mind not grow with it
how did his psycho
brother end up in the game
hes obviously feeling some psychological pressure
of course hes feeling pressure anderson
this is a boot camp for kids who
are gonna have to face a real enemy
the game is a thought relationship between the child
and the computer together they create stories
then change the story
this storys written by the childs
emotional reality i cant change that
i dont know how these images
got into the game
erase the game
youve done well
very well
top test scores in class
highest battle room ratings
but you have a habit of
upsetting your commander
i find it hard to respect someone
just because they outrank me sir
puts you in a difficult position
doesnt it
you dont like taking orders from bonzo
no sir
perhaps youd prefer to give them yourself
sir
howd you like to lead
sir ive never heard of a dragon army
we discontinued the name four years ago
no dragon army ever won a battle
then why not a new name sir
because we already have the uniforms
and who will be in this army sir
misfits like you
oddballs who might just be brilliant
with the right commander
your new quarters
your soldiers are being notified now
youll address them in 15 minutes
do you think theyll follow me
attenhut
officer on deck

you dont even like me
i didnt select this army bernard
but i intend to make it the best

i cant be expected to do all the
thinking in this army can i bean

please dont lie to me
were gonna send him home
back to earth
i want to go with him
we cant let you go
youve come so far
and i wanna talk to my sister
the fleet owns you ender
strategos would never allow it
send me home colonel
or i will resign
dont threaten me boy
im not the enemy
im not so sure
i wont play this game anymore
i quit
what are you gonna do
waste millions on a loser
you wanted to see me
you cant resign
you have an obligation to stay here
my father trained horses ive raised
yearlings since i was 5 years old
i know a thoroughbred when i see one
we cant lose him
my god you really dont see
them as children do you
it used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15
when the war is over
we can have the luxury of debating the
when its over
what will be left of the boy
what does it matter
if theres nothing left at all
were using these children to win the war
and if they come home its my job to put them back together again
thanks for what youve done
wheres ender
hello valentine
why are you here did something happen
i need you to take a ride with me
hes gonna be happy to see you
cmon you just want him to reenlist
i want him to save lives
what about his life
been sitting by bonzos bed
waiting for him to recover
he may never wake up
ender he attacked first
and i fought back
ive had a lot of fights val
ive won because i ve always
understood what my enemy thinks
but when i truly understand them
you also love them
i think its impossible to truly understand
someone and not love them the way they love themselves
but in that moment
you beat them
i destroy them
i make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again
ender they want me
to talk you into going back
i told them i wont cooperate
i dont think you are hiding here just because you care about bonzo
i think youre hiding because youre afraid
afraid you dont know your enemy
afraid you might lose but
but what if you are the
next mazer rackham
you cant hide here forever
if you sit here
if you dont try we will all be lost
ill miss you
ill miss you too
i need to know that you will
not block my emails again
attention prepare for transporter
docking operations
i thought we were going
back to battle school
were not
where are we going
much further
dear valentine
i must now travel to our advance command base near the formics home planet
where ill begin final training
if successful ill command
the entire invasion fleet
i wish there was another way
but war seems inevitable
stay safe
love
ender
not very hospitable is it
we took it from the formics
27 years after rackhams victory
flushed them out of these tunnels
like rats from a sewer
drove them all the way back to their home planet
how long did they live here
were not sure
this was a forward staging post
for their invasion of earth
built our base here to be
closer to their home planet
to allow instantaneous communication
by ansible with our attack fleet
if theyre on their home planet
do we have them contained
for now
if we have them boxed in
for the same reason that you kept kicking
that bully before i recruited you
the purpose of this war
is to prevent all future wars
your training begins first thing
tomorrow morning
sergeant dap will show you
to your quarters
yes sir
were still reseeding the atmosphere
its breathable but thin
in the event of an evacuation
two breaths every minute from one of these
will compensate for lower levels
of surface oxygen
lights out in five
who are you
look this may be amusing to you
but theyll come looking for me
you want to fight me is that the test
to see if ill attack an old man
well i wont
ill just sit this one out
okay you win
since when do you tell the enemy when hes won
i surprised you once why didnt you
destroy me immediately after
i thought you were a teacher
there is no teacher but the enemy
enemy will tell you where youre weak
where hes strong from now on i am your enemy got it
yes
good
during training i will devise
the strategy of your enemy
remember he is stronger than you from
now on you are always about to lose
sir
do you have a name
mazer rackham
what you thought i was dead
sir
ive been building models of your plane
since i was six years old
i have a question sir
on the vids they always cut out right
after you destroy the one carrier
why
get dressed
sir ive already seen this
i wanna know what happens after
just watch
after the explosion cleared
everything was incredibly still
their ships just stopped shooting
then they started falling out of the sky
scroll back please
to just after you lost your wingman
there play back please
you took cover in the cloud
you couldnt see anything
so you must have been using your hud
there stop
you saw something
what did you see in your hud
very good ender
thermal imaging from the satellite
the enemy is in red
what pattern do you see
it seems random
but its not
theres an epicenter
there
really
you took out that one particular ship
and the rest just
gave up
why
to what animals are the formics most often compared
ants
which have
a queen
who directs the worker ants
what she thinks they do
without her they cant think for themselves
and they die
you destroyed the queens ship
i must have yes
but you cant be certain
no
the soviet hegemon insisted
we keep it classified
thats why they never
showed the rest of the battle
or my face
to the world im dead
colonel
your face
you mean why is it marked
my father was a maori
lost him in the war
tä moko
is a way to connect to my past
its a way for me to speak for the dead
sir
have you ever seen a queen
no no one has
but if the formics have rebuilt their
fleet there must be more than one queen
yes of course
what happened when you attacked here
did you find one
no
why did they come
water
attention
officer on deck
hey bean
ho commander
petra
we thought you were iced we were
gonna have to have dink take over
that was never gonna happen
salaam alai
salaam commander
bernard
good to see you sir
at ease
while youve been skinnydipping
the colonels been flogging us to death on the simulator
alright take your seats
in a matter of weeks we may be called on to fight
a real battle lets bring your commander up to speed
our latest probe images will give you an idea
of whats happening on the enemy planet
like us they appear to have a
population growth rate thats unsustainable
for now theyre contained on their planet
but time is not on our side
where are they
high surface temperatures limit their
aboveground activity to just a few hours a day
whats most alarming
is the rate at which their military power is expanding
but theyve not yet moved against us
no
theyre planning to colonize another planet
before they breed themselves into extinction
our orders are to defeat them before
they pose an irreversible threat
their very existence is a threat
is that clear commander
clear sir
good
carry on colonel
we will begin with fighterreal simulations
that best approximate real battles
you will command overall strategy
your toon leaders will each command a battle group
you will issue orders to them
they will issue orders to their squadron to drone pilots
finally your entire fleet must support
protect your most important asset
70 billion of pure destruction
the md500
which petra is trained to fire
md
molecular detachment device
we call her the little doctor
particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels
at the focus point they
reach critical effective mass
chain reaction spreads outwards
shattering molecular bonds
leaves nothing standing
thats the beauty of the little doctor
no need to identify the
specific ship of the queen
the chain reaction takes
out the entire swarm
but ill only get one shot
once the formics see how she works
they wont come together again
you will have to win this
war one battle at a time
once our battle fleet is detected entering the formic solar
system we will have no alternative but to engage
i trust we have chosen our commander well
theres greatness in him sir
a killer instinct too i hope
absolutely
lets hope hes all you claim him to be
well be with you soon
good night
good night sir
dear valentine
so this is command school
im finally here
being a third ive always been so afraid i might fail
that i might not measure up
they made me a leader
and i promise you that ill do
everything i can to win this war
i know if anything ever happened to you
i would never forgive myself
what are they doing
harvesting water
if youre gonna use me
i need to be closer
too risky lets not reveal our best weapon
on what should be an easy attack
alai bean
your droids peel away
track them from below the ice
and read their path
theyre swarming
they see us
deploy all drones give me four
isobaric formations with 90 degree offsets
open fire
alai on my count fire directly up into the ice
good strategem
3 2 1
now
as our training progresses the simulations
are becoming more and more complex and real
the pressure to win day after day
month after monthis intense
we get very little sleep
somedays its hard to keep up
i got the breakaway
great work bean
squadrons 43 through 57 switch to
quadrant foxtrot 3889
ender watch our right flank
we need backup for bernard
i see it
bernard you flank them
copy that using 10 through 18
alai to your right
dink compensate for the pull of
planet g8 and go full throttle
bean pop up and sync to sierra
i could  lima
do sierra now
bernard watch your speed
dink youre closing too fast
you said full throttle
pull back now dink
gahh
you cant absorb these kind of losses war isnt
a game where you get to reboot and start over
sir i cant win if i dont take any risks
nobodys saying not to take risks
just dont try and control everything
bean improvised on the mopups
you focus on the big picture
delegate more to your teams
my teams are burned out
how can they be effective
if they dont get any sleep
sleep deprivation is part of your training
a battle with the formics could last for days
if id been smarter i could have annihilated petras
little doctor while you were micromanaging bean
that cant happen understand
yes sir
do you
cause ive trained others each one so hopeful
each one ultimately a failure
alright colonel
he understands
so i am not the first
no
but you will be the last
there is no time to train anyone else
so tomorrow colonel rackham
will run your final simulation
what if i win tomorrow what happens
youll be ready to face the real enemy
and youll be the finest commander
weve ever trained
one more simulation
then i may have to go to war
what happens when its no longer a game
real war is different i still know nothing about my enemy
what if they could talk to us
they cant dissections show no vocal cords
there are other ways to communicate
ender this is not a conversation
we should be having at 1 am
what if they could think to one another
what if we could think to them
you need to sleep
weve a graduation battle tomorrow
right
were gonna get crushed
we wont get crushed we have you
goodnight petra
goodnight ender
you still think hes the one
were committed this boy has the
empathy to think like a formic
understand them and anticipate them
hes not ready
were never ready
you know when youre ready enough
easy sir
its graduation day
good luck sir
attention
at ease
sir
we have an audience
commander wiggin
the strategos is here today to
witness your final simulation
if you are successful he will endorse your
promotion to battle commander of the entire fleet
yes sir
this simulation is based around
the enemys home planet
good luck commander
thank you sir
stay calm
shoot straight
here we go
theyre waiting
maybe they think we come in peace
i dont think mazer intends for
us to find a diplomatic solution
whats he waiting for
just give him a minute
ender what do we do
ender
the enemys gate is down
petra youre up
theyre spread too wide
for a chain reaction
shes right
just let him follow his instinct
all battle groups deploy
drones protect your carriers
alai youre squadron five
engage
this is suicidal
oh crap theyre swarming
close enough for you now petra
once i fire i need time to recharge
understood
go for the center
fire now
whoo she did it
yeah
give me full scalar
were not done yet
but we are so screwed
no were not
charged petra
no i need 2 minutes
all fighters fall back and surround her ship
copy that
i want rings within rings layers
upon layer every fighter we have
ender youre gonna leave our transporters defenseless
if were gonna win this battle dink
when the outer layer is hit the rest will continue
to drift with us like a shield do it now
hes abandoning his entire fleet
hes in command
theres no stopping him now
90 seconds ender
no no no im losing my carriers
my dreadnoughts are out
i dont care about dreadnoughts
just protect petra
like we protected alai when we fought bonzo
i hope you know what youre doing
ready petra
60 seconds what am i aiming for
the planet
what
we destroy the planet
we destroy the queens
game over
ender my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight
we will clear a path
all fighters maintain a clockwise rotation
focus all firepower forward
ender were entering the atmosphere
we need to slow down
we cant were one unit now
were not equipped to handle the heat
of passing through an atmosphere
our drones are our heat shield
keep falling let gravity do the work
this shield wont hold forever
we dont need forever
30 seconds
i still dont have a clear shot
were burning up
bean on my count accelerate the fighters from
the nose of the formation in a continuous stream
yes sir
like bullets from a rifle
we will drill a hole through the swarm
petra youll only get a second
thats all i need
3 2 1
now bean
shields have reached at 5
now petra
now
10 seconds
theyve broken the shield
fire petra
were out of time
we did it
how about that
game over
whats he saying
restoring the ansible connection
what is this
why are we watching these images
ender
thank you
brilliant absolutely brilliant
thank god for you son
why are these images
in the program
ender
we won
what do you mean we won
i beat him
he runs the simulations
he said it was a game
it was them or us ender
there was no other way
with this victory
youve won all future battles
you destroyed themfor all of us
stand down
move move please move
ender
stay away from me
you lied
son we were afraid if we told you youd
what refuse to play
they attacked us 1st
no they waited
what were they waiting for
who cares
we lost a thousand men on the
transporters you abandoned
i abandoned them in order to win
yes and they died proudly for us
they might not have died at all
if id known it was real i wouldve
what called for a dialogue
they cant even speak
watched them
what were they thinking were they building an army for a second invasion
oror simply preparing to defend themselves
ender stop from us
they came to earth to establish a colony
we chased them away
and in fifty years they never returned
it makes no difference now
i will bear the shame
of this genocide forever
no you will be remembered as a hero
i will be remembered as a killer
it was us or them
and youre sure weve killed every last one of them
i saw their whole planet destroyed
how do you know there isnt another
colony or another queen out there
we won thats all that matters
no
the way we win matters
dont hurt him
go on you need to let him rest
can i stay with him
just so hes not alone
please
yes of course
cmon lets let him rest
what if they could talk to us
what were they thinking
valentine
what if we could think to them
valentine
ender
ender wait
ender
what are you doing ender
i know what she wants
ender
warning you are leaving an oxygen  balanced environment
ender stop
its not safe
ender
breathe just breathe
in my game i saw this place
what are you talking about
the formics accessed the game through me
their thoughts my dreams
all mixed together
they were trying to communicate
what are you doing
go back
no
please
i have to do this
dear valentine
i now know my dreams
were never my own
they came from her
she was always trying
to communicate with me
i know the formics
better than any living soul
i stole their future from them
now i must find a way to make amends
youre dying
is it a queen
ill find her a new home
i promise
i miss you valentine
you wont be hearing from me for a while
i need to find out if im
as gifted at peace as i am at war
theyve rewarded me the rank of admiral
