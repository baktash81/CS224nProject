i got bacon here  got breakfast 
vegetarian  dad 
  since when 
  a year and a half 
must have found a turtle s nest 
i m not going near it  must be sick
or something if it s out in the daytime 
sure is enjoying those eggs 
what  no  no  no  no 
no 
oh  my god 
she s losing it  dad 
big time 
a sea turtle laid eggs 
the raccoons will eat them
if i don t keep them away 
really 
when a female lays her eggs 
the raccoons smell them and   
they ll eat every one if they can 
this web site told me
to call the aquarium   
and see if i could get someone
to come here and protect them 
  but my battery s dead 
  there s a number to the aquarium   
on the wall by the phone  honestly 
i don t know how they ll improve on   
on that 
hey  veronica 
no  ronnie  it s fantastic  i like it 
you re overreacting 
  hey  dad  can we fly a kite today 
  absolutely not 
we re flying three kites today 
all of us 
you re dreaming  dad 
yeah  i d like to report some
sea turtle eggs outside of my house 
sure 
  what 
  you said  outside my house  
i like that 
did you go to  like 
a nice guy schooi or something 
what s with all your smiling lately 
seriously  it s creepy 
is my     is my smile creepy 
well  i don t know  let s see it 
i m doing it 
kind of  but i think
you need to show teeth 
my grandmother used
to drive one of those 
  she did 
  yeah 
barely 
is that milkshake giri 
you should go spill that soda on her 
hey 
hi  nice look 
i almost didn t recognize you
with your shirt on 
i m sorry  i was stupid 
  yeah 
  it must have been the game 
i get a little    jacked up 
you know  i laid awake that night 
just remembering it 
felt like a jerk for hours 
i seriously doubt that happened 
you re wrong 
i ll see you around 
i hope so 
what should i call you
when that happens 
  ronnie 
  ronnie 
bye  ronnie

you work for the aquarium 
i thought you were a mechanic 
  i don t work there  i volunteer there 
  i called yesterday

  there were raccoons here all night 
  really 
  where are they now 
  i scared them away 
yeah  i m not surprised 
i m a little scared 
that s really funny 
you know  i d like to see
you sleep out here all night   
while it s freezing with a baseball bat
in your hand and raccoons terrorize you 
  you really slept out here all night 
  no 
my hair looks like this all by itself 
i wasn t gonna mention
the hair  but   
this all your creation 
  do you have a problem with it 
  not really 
other than the fact
that when the eggs hatch 
turtles won t be able
to get back to the sea  so   
they ll starve and die 
hey 
blaze 
blaze  what s wrong 
i saw how you looked at him 
at marcus  i saw you 
  what are you talking about 
  i love him  ok 
  so stay away 
  i am not interested   
you re iying 
i watched you flirt with him

and now  our william
will go there as well 
  where will you be going  ronnie 
  i m not

anywhere planned for me  or   
i just haven t figured out
the whole college thing yet 
but   
will  pass ronnie some roast beef 
  no  thank you 
  i told you  ronnie s a vegetarian 
  really 
  yeah 
  why 
  just reasons 
i mean  it s not that i don t
like people that like meat 
i mean  they re fine  just that   
  how you been  dad 
  oh  i been good  good 
you know  i was going through
some of mikey s stuff the other day 
  and if you have time   
  that s enough  tom 
well  she s a lot prettier
than you described her  will 
thank you  dad 
you bringing her to the wedding 
he didn t tell you  his sister s
getting married in a couple of weeks 
no  i don t think you
did mention that  will 
  would you like to come 
  will 
your sister told me
that you were bringing ashley 
i sent out her invitation
just yesterday 
  ronnie  this is silly 
  drop it  will 
i can t drop it  you re mad 
  i m not mad 
  you re mad 
i m not  you want to go to your sister s
wedding with your ex girlfriend 
  it s not a big deai 
  not as a date 
she s a friend of my sister s 
i said it was ok if she came 
honestly  it s not a big deal
because i don t wanna go   
to some wedding
where i don t know anybody 
  ronnie   
  and you just forgot to mention   
you re going to vanderbilt 
you told me you re going to columbia 
no  i didn t 
i told you i was accepted to columbia 
ronnie  it s complicated  ok 
my parents are   
  not a good time to disappoint them 
  what s complicated  it s your life 
  go to the college that you want to 
  it s not that simple 
look  we don t have to do this 
  what do you mean 
  maybe you should find someone   
that s more suited to your lifestyle 
you know  with her own rich parents 
  her own perfect mansion   
  ronnie 
there is nothing perfect
about that house 
can you not see that  my parents
are holding on by a thread 
perfect  nothing s been perfect
in my family for a long time 
i had a brother  mikey 
he died last year 
how 
car accident 
my mom was driving 
mikey and i were in the back seat 
goofing off  playing mercy 
we were being idiots 
she turned around to tell us to stop 
and she lost controi of the car 
he was killed instantly 
it s just so hard
to feei happy in that house 
it s the only reason
i didn t invite you to the wedding 
i went out with those girls
because i was   
trying to feei something again 
no one has made me feei
like you do  ronnie 
i don t want to lose you 
i love you  will 
i love you too 
and  since you asked   
   there is something
that you don t know about me 
come here 
what are we doing here 
hey  did you have a good time 
what 
i played today 
that s   
that s good  how did it feei 
like i never stopped 
dad   
i d probably talk about this with
a girlfriend if i had one here  but   
i don t  so   
so you wanna talk

dear ronnie  i miss the hours
we spent together at the piano 
i miss being your teacher 
i know you see me as having left you 
but when your mother and i split up 
i was in a lot of pain 
i just needed to come home 
i regret moving away from you
and jonah more than anything 
i hope you ll forgive me 
your mom tells me you
completely failed your sats 
but i know how smart you have to be
to get every single question wrong 
congratulations  ronnie 
i ve told you before that none of what
happened between your mother and me   
had anything to do with you or jonah 
love is fragile  ronnie 
and we re not always
its best caretakers 
we just muddle through
and do the best we can   
and hope this fragile thing survives 
against all odds 
he s probably started college by now 
do you miss him 
what he did was wrong  dad 
yeah 
it was 
i can tell you this 
  he misses you 
  i doubt it 
you don t even know who you are  ronnie

you are the kindest  sweetest   
most beautifui daughter
in the whole world

kind of obligated to say that  dad 
yeah  it is in the handbook 
i don t have too many lectures
left on my timecard 
so i really want you to hear this  ok 
someday  you are
gonna open your heart 
and you re gonna play again 
and it s not gonna be
to make your mother happy 
and it s not gonna be to make me happy 
it ll be for you 
because    music and   
love   
they re gonna bring you joy 
thank you
