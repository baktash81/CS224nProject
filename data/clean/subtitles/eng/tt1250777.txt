he leaps tall buildings in a single bound 
up in the sky 
is it a bird  is it a plane 
   mailman by day 
guardian by night 
he protects new york
from the forces of evil 
   the world has been protected by extraordinary men and
women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime 
he has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings 
i always wondered why nobody did it
before me
i mean  all those comic
books  movies  tv shows   
you d think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume 
is everyday life really so
exciting 
are schools and offices so thrilling 
that i m the only one who ever fantasized about this 
c mon  be honest with yourself 
at some point in our lives 
we all wanted to be a super hero 
that s not me  by the way 
that s some armenian guy with a history of
mental health problems 
who am i 
i m  kick ass 
that s me  back before any of this
crazy shit happened 
guess i was the last person you d expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong
with me 
but there s not nothing special either
i wasn t into sports
i wasn t a mathlete   
or a hard core gamer   
i didn t have a piercing 
or an eating disorder 
or three thousand
friends on myspace 
my only superpower was being invisible to girls
and out of my friends  man  i wasn t even the funny one 
like most people my age  i just
existed 
good morning  class
please open your books to act ii  scene ii
kick in my bedroom door  you d
probably find me watching tv 
or talking to my friend todd on skype 
you watching family guy 
nope 
me neither 
check on  nippleslip com    it s good
or  jerking off  
mostly to my english teacher
dave lizewski  don t think i
haven t noticed you looking at my tits 
oh     i want your
hand all over me    dave   
please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day
was making deposits in the wack off warehouse for later
though  to be honest i didn t take much to set me off 
i swear  when hormones balance out
shares in kleenex are gonna take a dive  man 
dave lizewski
shouldn t you be looking at hamlet right now 
yes  mrs  zane
sorry
but don t get me wrong
i like girls in my own age  too 
especially katie deauxma 
hey gorgeous 
hey 
oh  no
ah  you meant   erika
i know  i
knew that 
i was just kidding 
o k   cool 
oh  my god
hey  look i m todd s mom 
oh  that s funny  this is your dad
no that s still my mom  actually
what the fuck 
i was just a regular guy 
no radioactive spiders 
no refugee status from a doomed alien world 
you know what  todd said they do still make count
chocula  they just don t sell it in the store anymore 
my mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen 
as opposed to a
gunman in an alley 
so if you were hoping for any   
i will avenge you  mother 
   you re outta luck 
in the eighteen months
since my mother died 
the only epiphany i had was realizing that 
life just goes on 
did they change the bee s face 
no
how come nobody s ever tried to be
a superhero 
well  i dunno  probably
 cause it s fucking impossible  dip shit 
what  putting on a mask and helping
people  how is that impossible 
that s not a superhero  though  it has to have super
super is like  being stronger than everybody and flying and shit 
that s just hero 
no  it s not even hero  it s just fuckin 
psycho 
hello  bruce wayne 
he didn t have any powers 
yes  but he had all expensive shit
that doesn t exist 
i thought you meant  like how come
no one does it in real life 
yeah  todd  that s what i meant 
dude if anybody did it in real life
they d get their ass kicked 
they d be dead in like  a day 
    a day 
o k   i m not saying they should do it 
i just can t figure out why nobody
does 
seriously  out of all the millions of people who love superheroes
you d think
one would give it a try 
jesus  guys  doesn t it bug you 
why do thousands of people wanna be paris
hilton  and nobody wants to be spider man 
yeah  what s with that  she has 
like  no tits at all 
maybe it s the porn tape 
he doesn t have a porn tape 
you guys never saw one night in
spider man 
guess who 
is it just me  or do you feel kinda
sorry for chris d amico 
yeah  must be terrible to have a
rich dad and everything you want 
i wish you hadn t said anything   cause i feel like i m gonna start crying 
no  the fact that he s  
  always on his own 
we should  like  talk to him 
see if he wants to hang with us 
   i m not saying that we should talk to him  but
think about it  c mon it d be awesome  if he was
our friend  no one would ever fuck with us again 
go on then  todd 
you know  i  i can get up   
no  no  
you wanna go talk to him

the joker s force field leaving him totally vulnerable
pussy patrol

come on  be honest with yourself
would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble
and we wish we can help
but we don t
the world i lived in 
heroes only exist in comic books
but i guess that would have been ok  if bad guys were make believe too 
but they are not
frankie  i m telling you man  i swear i m not making this up 
this fucking guy    comes outta nowhere
kicks our asses and steals all the coke
this would be the guy that looks
like batman 
i didn t say he looked like batman 
you did tre  you said the the guy looked like batman
and you said like a mask and
stuff and a cape  yeah like batman 
i didn t say like batman  
i never said  batman  
ok
let me tell you the problem i
got with that  tre 
our mole with the
russians tells things a little different 
according to him  you ve sold him my coke
and you took the money
that s a fucking lie 
i can t believe that you would believe this shit from
a fucking russian  man 
let me see  tre  hey  what s more likely 
that you re a greedy little cocksucker 
or that all my coke was stolen by superman 
batman 
i never said batman 
enough
my son is waitin  out there in the car
to go to the movies 
and i aint gonna to disappoint him
joe  you re in charge

and i ll have an icee 
mixed
like  when they mix the red one and the blue one 
 gun shot in background 
and a pack of twizzlers 
the comic books had it wrong 
it didn t take a trauma  or cosmic
rays or a power ring to make a superhero 
   just the perfect combination of
optimism and naivety 
you are fucking awesome 
c mon
daddy  i m scared 
c mon mindy  honey 
be a big girl now 
there s nothin  to be afraid of 
is it gonna hurt bad 
oh  child  only for a second  sugar 
a handgun bullet travels at    more than 
700 miles an hour 
700 miles an hour 
so at close range like this  the force is gonna take
you off your feet  for sure 
but it s really no more painful than a punch in the chest 
i hate getting punched in the
chest 
you re gonna be fine  baby doll 
how was that 
not so bad 
kinda fun  huh 
now you know how it feels 
you won t be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a glock

that s what you get 
i ll be honest 
there wasn t a whole lotta crime
fighting in those first few weeks 
but even so  my new vocation kept
me plenty busy 
i called it preparation 
but if you called it fantasizing 
it woulda been hard to argue 
all i knew was i never felt so good about myself 
fuck 
okay  maybe i was still in the beta testing
phase 
but it was a start 
what the fuck are you looking at 
nothing
get the fuck out of here
like every serial killer already knew  eventually
fantasizing just doesn t do it for you anymore 
it was time to engage
what the fuck 
what the fuck are you looking at 
i said what the fuck are you looking at 
two cheapshit losers screwing with a car that
somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for 
say what 
leave it be man 
this motherfucker is obviously high 
i m not high 
i just think it sucks you guys think you can do
what you want 
just walk away from the car 
and we can just forget about this 
you crazy  man 
fuck this shit 
shit  get outta here 
i came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell
anybody about the costume

oh hey  i read those old ditko spider mans
you gave me  they re actually pretty good 
yeah  they are 
and it s been a whole week since i ve heard from rasul 
that s great 
once upon a time  there were two super cops called
daddy and marcus   
who were very good at getting bad guys
frank damico was the baddest guy of them all
and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy 
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing
that could have happened to daddy 
prison was not his natural habitat
he was very upset 
with daddy in prison
his pregnant wife was all alone 
and could not cope 
but all clouds have a silver lining 
and out of her death  
mindy was born
marcus became the child s guardian
and daddy started a plan of his very own 
five years later he left prison
and he was ready
now it s time for mindy to get ready too 
how d you find me marcus 
one of us is still a cop  remember 
now you brain washed mindy 
you say brain washed
i say made it into a game 
what you call this  playing  damon 
vigilante justice  mass murder  c mon  partner 
so where is she 
she s safe  
can i see her   
i miss her 
i miss you both 
i appreciate your concern 
but you need to go now 
i should warn you that asshole 
gigante  is looking for kick ass 
he got something to do with you damon 
you started some kinda fucked up
superhero club

beautiful and as kind 
and    lovely as you 
you deserve better 
dave

my mom has the burglar alarm set downstairs 
you should probably use the window 
or
you could just stay 
stay 
like when we have a sleepover 
i m sorry  i didn t mean to scare you

daddy  i think i found one

brains out if i got the chance

showing if we leave   
hell yeah

welcome back to breaking news a world wide web broadcast of the
new york superhero who calls himself kick ass 
is about to be shown live  rumors have it that this will be kick ass 
farewell appearance that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting
but as word of mouth continues to spread  internet providers are predicting
that it could be one of the most widely viewed live events in web history 
hey  where s dave 
hey have you guys noticed  
he s with katie   
obviously 
why else would i be here 
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes

you re on the news 
call me
we go now over live to the countdown clock as we are moments away 
showtime
hello boys and girls  now this    uh

gentlemen please  yeah 
oh this looks very painful   
due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to
broadcast the events currently streaming live on the internet
no no
misguided miscalculations suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity
stunt  it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my
fucked up nerve endings 
i ve gotta tell ya 
that hurt 
the silent killer
but not half as much as the idea of
leaving everything behind 
katie
my dad 
todd and marty
and all the
things i d never do 
like learn to drive 
or see what me and katie s
kids would look like 
or find out
