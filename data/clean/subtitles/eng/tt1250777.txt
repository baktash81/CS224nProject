he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
up in the sky
is it a bird is it a plane
mailman by day
guardian by night
he protects new york
from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and
women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings
i always wondered why nobody did it
before me
i mean all those comic
books movies tv shows
youd think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume
is everyday life really so
exciting
are schools and offices so thrilling
that im the only one who ever fantasized about this
cmon be honest with yourself
at some point in our lives
we all wanted to be a super hero
thats not me by the way
thats some armenian guy with a history of
mental health problems
who am i
im kickass
thats me back before any of this
crazy shit happened
guess i was the last person youd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong
with me
but theres not nothing special either
i wasnt into sports
i wasnt a mathlete
or a hardcore gamer
i didnt have a piercing
or an eating disorder
or three thousand
friends on myspace
my only superpower was being invisible to girls
and out of my friends man i wasnt even the funny one
like most people my age i just
existed
good morning class
please open your books to act ii scene ii
kick in my bedroom door youd
probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on skype
you watching family guy
nope
me neither
check on nippleslipcom its good
or jerking off
mostly to my english teacher
dave lizewski dont think i
havent noticed you looking at my tits
oh i want your
hand all over me dave
please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day
was making deposits in the wackoff warehouse for later
though to be honest i didnt take much to set me off
i swear when hormones balance out
shares in kleenex are gonna take a dive man
dave lizewski
shouldnt you be looking at hamlet right now
yes mrs zane
sorry
but dont get me wrong
i like girls in my own age too
especially katie deauxma
hey gorgeous
hey
oh no
ah you meant  erika
i know i
knew that
i was just kidding
ok cool
oh my god
hey look im todds mom
oh thats funny this is your dad
no thats still my mom actually
what the fuck
i was just a regular guy
no radioactive spiders
no refugee status from a doomed alien world
you know what todd said they do still make count
chocula they just dont sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen
as opposed to a
gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother
youre outta luck
in the eighteen months
since my mother died
the only epiphany i had was realizing that
life just goes on
did they change the bees face
no
how come nobodys ever tried to be
a superhero
well i dunno probably
cause its fucking impossible dipshit
what putting on a mask and helping
people how is that impossible
thats not a superhero though it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
thats just hero
no its not even hero its just fuckin
psycho
hello bruce wayne
he didnt have any powers
yes but he had all expensive shit
that doesnt exist
i thought you meant like how come
no one does it in real life
yeah todd thats what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life
theyd get their ass kicked
theyd be dead in like a day
a day
ok im not saying they should do it
i just cant figure out why nobody
does
seriously out of all the millions of people who love superheroes
youd think
one would give it a try
jesus guys doesnt it bug you
why do thousands of people wanna be paris
hilton and nobody wants to be spiderman
yeah whats with that she has
like no tits at all
maybe its the porn tape
he doesnt have a porn tape
you guys never saw one night in
spiderman
guess who
is it just me or do you feel kinda
sorry for chris damico
yeah must be terrible to have a
rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadnt said anything cause i feel like im gonna start crying
no the fact that hes
always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
im not saying that we should talk to him but
think about it cmon itd be awesome if he was
our friend no one would ever fuck with us again
go on then todd
you know i i can get up
no no
you wanna go talk to him
nuhuh dave should go
dave should go
why dave you should totally go go
youre a dick
dont be afraid dave

yeah
you think i just shat my pants or what
sea ya
yeah i would just klick his ass
when did you ever kick anyones ass
whatever man i wouldve just gone for his knees

what im saying is that in the joker portion when he got in evaran when he vowed to penetrate
the jokers force field leaving him totally vulnerable
pussy patrol
phones money
dude not again
come on
phone i dont have one
somebody else jacked it last week
pussy
gimme the bag
its just comics
yo you wanna get cut
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself
would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble
and we wish we can help
but we dont
the world i lived in
heroes only exist in comic books
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
but they are not
frankie im telling you man i swear im not making this up
this fucking guy comes outta nowhere
kicks our asses and steals all the coke
this would be the guy that looks
like batman
i didnt say he looked like batman
you did tre you said the the guy looked like batman
and you said like a mask and
stuff and a cape yeah like batman
i didnt say like batman
i never said batman
ok
let me tell you the problem i
got with that tre
our mole with the
russians tells things a little different
according to him youve sold him my coke
and you took the money
thats a fucking lie
i cant believe that you would believe this shit from
a fucking russian man
let me see tre hey whats more likely
that youre a greedy little cocksucker
or that all my coke was stolen by superman
batman
i never said batman
enough
my son is waitin out there in the car
to go to the movies
and i aint gonna to disappoint him
joe youre in charge
thanks
thats gotta be the worst fuckin excuse i ever heard tre
screaming
sorry you had to wait buddy
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
its ok were cool
were only gonna miss the trailers
yeah but i wanted to
get some popcorn
when we get in there get chris some
popcorn
okay
what do you wanna drink wanna pepsi
yeah thats fine
get him a pepsi
and ill have an icee
mixed
like when they mix the red one and the blue one
gun shot in background
and a pack of twizzlers
the comicbooks had it wrong
it didnt take a trauma or cosmic
rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of
optimism and naivety
you are fucking awesome
cmon
daddy im scared
cmon mindy honey
be a big girl now
theres nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad
oh child only for a second sugar
a handgun bullet travels at more than
700 miles an hour
700 miles an hour
so at close range like this the force is gonna take
you off your feet for sure
but its really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the
chest
youre gonna be fine baby doll
how was that
not so bad
kinda fun huh
now you know how it feels
you wont be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a glock
i wouldnt have been scared anyways

oh child you always knock me for a loop
you know what
we gonna get you two
two
one   two
thats what you get
ill be honest
there wasnt a whole lotta crime
fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept
me plenty busy
i called it preparation
but if you called it fantasizing
it woulda been hard to argue
all i knew was i never felt so good about myself
fuck
okay maybe i was still in the beta testing
phase
but it was a start
what the fuck are you looking at
nothing
get the fuck out of here
like every serial killer already knew eventually
fantasizing just doesnt do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck
what the fuck are you looking at
i said what the fuck are you looking at
two cheapshit losers screwing with a car that
somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
say what
leave it be man
this motherfucker is obviously high
im not high
i just think it sucks you guys think you can do
what you want
just walk away from the car
and we can just forget about this
you crazy man
fuck this shit
shit get outta here
i came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell
anybody about the costume
he promised he wouldnt
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why cant i have a gun
i am a security guard
youre a doorman now you dont get a gun no more
look at me i look like a putz

and its been a whole week since ive heard from rasul
thats great
once upon a time there were two super cops called
daddy and marcus
who were very good at getting bad guys
frank damico was the baddest guy of them all
and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing
that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural habitat
he was very upset
with daddy in prison
his pregnant wife was all alone
and could not cope
but all clouds have a silver lining
and out of her death
mindy was born
marcus became the childs guardian
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
and he was ready
now its time for mindy to get ready too
howd you find me marcus
one of us is still a cop remember
now you brainwashed mindy
you say brainwashed

showing if we leave

frank were ready
enjoy the show
you patchedup with this thing
i sure am big brother
watch and learn
welcome back to breaking news a world wide web broadcast of the
new york superhero who calls himself kickass
is about to be shown live rumors have it that this will be kickass
farewell appearance that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting
but as wordofmouth continues to spread internet providers are predicting
that it could be one of the most widely viewed live events in web history
hey wheres dave
hey have you guys noticed
hes with katie
obviously
why else would i be here
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didnt you tell this is what you were doing
youre on the news
call me
we go now over live to the countdown clock as we are moments away
showtime
hello boys and girls now this uh
well you know who this guy is
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
come on in guys say hello
yeah
yeah there they are
hello hello
now big daddy and kickass
are gonna help us show you why
being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is
thats when k is at the beginning of the but you dont pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that mustve hurt
lets see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
now in france they say the word stick like this
baton
we have some of kickass batons
were gonna show you what they can do
go ahead boys
in america we say stick like this
baseball bat
for hittin knees
hands
its also good for hittin balls
we dont do em individually we do em all together
gentlemen please yeah
oh this looks very painful
due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to
broadcast the events currently streaming live on the internet
no no
misguided miscalculations suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity
stunt it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my
fucked up nerve endings
ive gotta tell ya
that hurt
the silent killer
but not half as much as the idea of
leaving everything behind
katie
my dad
todd and marty
and all the
things id never do
like learn to drive
or see what me and katies
kids would look like
or find out
what happened on lost
and if youre reassuring yourself
that im gonna make it through this since im talking to you now
quit being such a smart ass
hell dude youve never seen sin city
sunset boulevard american beauty
