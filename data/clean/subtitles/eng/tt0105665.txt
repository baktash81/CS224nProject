and help out 
l ll get the phone 
chet  l m calling you
from portland  oregon 
lt s regional
bureau chief fordon cole   
calling from portland  oregon 
ok  fordon 
oregon 
l ve got a girl
that s been murdered 
seventeen years old 
named teresa banks 
chet 
l ve got a surprise for you 
something interesting
l would like to show you 
arrangements are being made   
and l will meet you at
the private portland airport 
ok  fordon 
chet  food to see you 
chet  give sam stanley
the glad hand 
he s come over from spokane 
lt s a pleasure 
l ve heard a lot about you 
sam s the man who cracked
the whitman case 
congratulations 
l heard about that 
chet  your surprise 
her name is lil 
she s my mother s sister s girl 
federal 
food luck  chet 
sam  you stick with chet 
he s got his own m o  
modus operandi 
you fellas can reach me
in the philadelphia offices 
l m flying out today 
that really was something
with the dancing girl 
what exactly did that mean 
l ll explain it to you 
remember lil s
wearing a sour face 
what do you mean 
her face had a sour look on it 
we re going to have problems
with the local authorities 
they re not going to be
receptive to the fbl 
both eyes blinking
means trouble higher up 
the eye is the local authority 
sheriff and a deputy
would be my guess 
you notice she had
one hand in her pocket   
which means
they re hiding something 
and the other hand
made into a fist   
which means
they ll be belligerent 
lil was walking in place   
which means there s
a lot of legwork involved 
cole said lil was
his mother s sister s girl 
now  what s missing
in that sentence 
the uncle  not cole s uncle   
but probably the sheriff s
uncle is in federal prison 
let me ask you something 
did you notice
anything about the dress 
the dress was altered
to fit her 
l noticed a different color
thread where it was taken in 
fordon said you were good 
tailored dress
is our code for drugs 
notice what was pinned to it 
a blue rose 
food  but l can t
tell you about that

trailer park for a month 
we ll check that 
worked as a waitress
at hap s diner 
worked the night shift 
food place for dinner
when we re through here 
no one came to claim the body 
no known next of kin 
crushed skull 
probable cause  repeated blows
to the back of the head   
by a blunt 
obtuse angled object 
l wonder where her ring is 
personal effects include
a watch  undergarment   
pink waitress uniform 
the ring s missing 
seems to be
an interesting contusion   
under the ring finger
of the left hand 
accidental 
agent desmond  could you hold
the finger for me  please 
there s something in there

blue rose cases 
the clues found by
special agent desmond

have led to dead ends 
the letter extracted
