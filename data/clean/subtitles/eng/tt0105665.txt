you fellas can reach me
in the philadelphia offices
lm flying out today
that really was something
with the dancing girl
what exactly did that mean
lll explain it to you
remember lils
wearing a sour face
what do you mean
her face had a sour look on it
were going to have problems
with the local authorities
theyre not going to be
receptive to the fbl
both eyes blinking
means trouble higher up
the eye is the local authority
sheriff and a deputy
would be my guess
you notice she had
one hand in her pocket
which means
theyre hiding something
and the other hand
made into a fist
which means
theyll be belligerent
lil was walking in place
which means theres
a lot of legwork involved
cole said lil was
his mothers sisters girl
now whats missing
in that sentence
the uncle not coles uncle
but probably the sheriffs
uncle is in federal prison
let me ask you something
did you notice
anything about the dress
the dress was altered
to fit her
l noticed a different color
thread where it was taken in
fordon said you were good
tailored dress
is our code for drugs
notice what was pinned to it
a blue rose
food but l cant
tell you about that

blue rose cases
the clues found by
special agent desmond

have led to dead ends
the letter extracted
from beneath the fingernail
