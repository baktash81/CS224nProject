for dreamland studios 
this beautiful mobile home
you see before you   
is the current hideout of
the notorious beauty divine   
the filthiest person alive 
because of this cover story   
in one of your sleazier
national tabloids   
she has been forced
to go underground   
disguising her appearance   
and adopting the alias
of babs johnson 
with her live her trusted
traveling companion cotton   
her delinquent son crackers   
and her mentally ill mother
miss edie 
let s take a peek inside

and l sleep in the other room 
we all have our own rooms
this time

l know how

l ll be right back 
across town  located in
the teeming metropolis   
known as downtown baltimore   
live connie and raymond marble 
two jealous perverts   
that hate divine s
fame and notoriety   
more than anything
in the whole world 
for connie and raymond marble 
it was the beginning of the end 
well  miss sandstone   
after looking over
your qualifications   
my husband and l have decided
that you re not exactly   
what we had in mind
for the job 
not only have you
never heard of divine   
which is one
of the key elements   
for this particular job   
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience 
and to be honest  we feel
you are sort of a dullard 
why do you say that 
l did everything you asked 
l even found out
who this divine was 
too late  too late   
and  naturally  you did
everything l asked  my dear 
you would never have
gotten to this plateau   
of the job placement test 
l mean  surely 
you can see our point 
we re not in a position
to just take anyone 
this is a high security job 
as you can well imagine   
and we personally just don t
feel that you meet our   
oh  how should l say   
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process 
well  why did you
hold me up for so long 
why did you keep
asking me to come back 
l had another job
l could ve taken 
how could l have gotten
information   
about this divine you talk of 
l don t know her 
you could ve given me
some lead as to how   
l could ve gathered this data
you wanted about her 
you led me to believe
l had this job 
well  miss sandstone   
miss  uh  sandy sandstone   
you just must ve been wrong in
your assumptions  weren t you 
l mean  surely 
you ve heard the expression   
  don t count your chickens   
well  apply it 
l never gave you a final answer
on this whole thing   
and  as far as you believing
that you had the job   
well  l ve never even
considered   
that you would be the applicant
that we would choose 
you don t know enough 
l mean  l wish everyone
was like you   
and had never heard of divine   
but  unfortunately 
it just isn t like that 
now  if you wouldn t mind   
l do have a busy day
ahead of me 
there s really nothing
left to discuss 
well  what am l
supposed to do now 
that s what l d like to know 
you can eat shit for all
l care  miss sandstone   
or eat anything that you like
or do anything that you like 
just don t assume that l want
to know your troubles 
now  if you wouldn t mind 
l m a busy woman   
with a full day s work
ahead of me 
please remove yourself
from my office 
you re a real cunt 
do you know that 
a real fucking cunt 
how can you be
so shitty to people 
how can you stand yourself 
l guess there s just two kinds
of people  miss sandstone   
my kind of people and assholes 
lt s rather obvious
which category you fit into 
have a nice day 
eat the bird  bitch 
you ready  ma 
you ready yet 
l m ready  darling 
just let me say good bye
to mama and cotton 
l ll be out in a minute  honey 
ok  ma  but get the lead
out of your ass   
or l ll be late for my date 
all right 
yes  won t l be late
for my date 
you are gonna love my date 
you ll like her as much as l do 
l m going to bring her
back real soon   
for you all to enjoy

is satisfying my customers

thank you 
bye bye  now 
we ll see who s
the filthiest person alive 
we ll just see 
and where is that raymond 
where is he 
how could he leave me alone   
when there s so much
to be taken care of 
please come home  raymond 
l need you so badly 
can you hurry  driver 
l ll be late for my appointment 
l m going as fast as l can 
lady  without breaking the law 
3800 greymeadow  right 
that s what l said  wasn t it 
2 30 
you can shove 2 30  hack 
why  hello  cookie 
l do hope you re hungry 
l could go for a sandwich 
bologna 
well   
l ll get right to the point 
l can get you information
about divine 
lots of information  l think 
if things go well today 
l have a date
with her son crackers 
well  this is  of course 
an encouraging development 
this is an important
assignment  cookie 
we could all benefit  
you  financially   
and  raymond and l   
well  our social standing
is involved to a great degree 
l may have to degrade myself
in front of divine s son 
he s into a very strange
sex scene 
l m going to have to put up
with unheard of atrocities   
in order to pump the information
you need out of him 
but  first  l have to know
exactly what you want to know   
because my so called date
is this afternoon 
well  cookie  as you know   
divine has achieved
a sort of fame lately   
both locally
and on the national level 
you may have heard the term 
  the filthiest person alive   
l have heard the term  yes 
the papers call her that   
and she is known as that
to a limited extent   
in your more crime conscious
sections of the city 
well  we feel this to be
an untrue statement 
we feel that raymond
and l far surpass her   
in every aspect
of the term   filth   
as you know  we run a baby ring 
oh  it s really
a very simple process 
we keep two girls
at all times   
who are impregnated
by channing   
our rather fertile servant 
we sell the babies
to lesbian couples   
and then we invest the money   
in various businesses
around town 
we own a few
pornography shops   
plus  we front money
to a chain of heroin pushers   
in the inner city
elementary schools 
we feel that the attention   
that s been focused
on divine lately   
is most unfair 
she is merely a common thief
and murderer 
unfortunately  for us 
our line of work   
limits our chances
for publicity and travel   
but this does not mean
that we wish to go unnoticed 
after all  we ve not
worked all these years   
in order to be upstaged
by this fat hog   
that calls herself divine 
so we must catch her
off guard  you see   
before she realizes
she is being attacked 
we need information
as to how they live   
where they live 
how many people  their names   
their daily schedules
for the week 
ln other words   
we want to know how
we can plague her the most   
how we can make her life
as miserable as possible   
how we can prove to her   
that she is shit
compared to us  
shit compared to the filth
that we have in our minds   
shit compared to what we know
to be the filthiest delight 
well  does crackers know
that his so called date   
is actually a spy
sent by the marbles 
this is my grandma edie 
what s the matter with her 
what s the matter with her 
there ain t nothing
the matter with her 
she s just my grandma 
that s all 
why are those eggs
all over her face 
l guess she was just hungry 
that s all 
you see  she sort of
has some problems 
nothing serious  but  you know  
l mean  she just loves eggs   
always has 
sit tight  l ll go see
if miss cotton s up yet 
she s here  miss cotton

and she will

even more than the thought
of original sin itself

eternally united to you   
through an invisible cord
of finely woven filth   
that even god himself
could never  ever break 
that old black magic

theme of witchcraft

l thought for sure
it was the cops 
who could ve sent me
this package 
who would dare send me
a package like this 
the return address is
  the filthiest people alive   
who would dare use that title 
who would dare  
wrapped all fancy 
lt s just a birthday present 
babs

cotton 
l smell deep  dark trouble 
oh  my god almighty 
someone has sent me
a bowel movement 
oh  babs 
a turd  mama  a turd 
who could ve sent this 
a turd 
oh  a turd  oh  babs 
this is a direct attack
on my divinity   
a direct attack
on the peace and harmony   
of our last few weeks here   
an outrageous attempt   
to humiliate and disgrace
my private life 
someone will pay for this 
someone will pay with their life
for this grossly offensive act 
mama  nobody sends you a turd
and expects to live  nobody 
why would anybody
do this to us  why 
look  look  here s a card 
read it  cotton 
lt s a birthday card 
a fucking birthday card 
well  what does it say  
oh  god  babs 
  happy birthday  fatso   
  you are no longer
the filthiest person alive 
  we are   
signed    the filthiest
people alive   
just as l thought  
a deliberate attempt
to seize my title 
eggman didn t do it  babs 
l know the eggman didn t do it 
l don t think he did 
either  mother 
now  shut up
and let me think  will you 
that cookie was asking
questions  crackers 
l heard her 
she s right  ma  she s right 
but why would she
send us a turd 
who knows  who knows 
these are obviously
jealous people  
jealous of our careers 
of all of our press 
why else would they sign that
  the filthiest people alive   
everyone knows that that title
has become my trademark 
why  to use it in this way   
is only to insinuate that
they are filthier than l 
how could anyone
seriously believe that 
how could anyone
be filthier than divine 
l m afraid
our little vacation   
must come to an end 
this must be nipped in the bud 
lt s already out of hand 
now we must outfilth   
the asshole or assholes
that sent this 
and then they must die 
connie and raymond marble   
while you are away 
the servants will play 
well  miss sandstone   
after going over
your qualifications   
mr  marble and l feel
that you are not exactly   
what we had in mind
for the job 
not only have you never
heard of divine   
which is one
of the key elements   
for this particular job   
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience 
and to be perfectly honest   
we feel that you are
sort of a dullard 
why isn t channing here
to take off my coat 
he s getting lazier and lazier
as each day ends  raymond 
l ll speak to him 
we must remember that channing
isn t as intelligent as us 
this is a high security job 
as you can well imagine   
and we personally
just don t feel   
that you meet our  
oh  how should l say  
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process 
who on earth is that 
sounds like channing 
well  doing what 
l d like to know 
l love you  raymond 
l love you more than
anything in this world 
l love you
more than my own filthiness   
even more
than my own hair color 
more than the sound
of bones breaking   
the sound of the death rattle 
oh  my 
and l  connie   
l  connie  also love you   
more than anything
l could ever imagine   
more than
my own hair color   
more than the sound
of babies screaming   
the sound of dogs dying 
what do you think
you re doing  
what is the meaning
of this outrage  
let me at him  
l ve been waiting
to do this for a lifetime 
no  connie  no 
how do you dare to be
dressed as you are 
how do you dare to be saying
the things we heard you say 
no  please  listen 
l didn t mean any harm  
let me go  connie 
you little asshole 
you d better start explaining 
how dare you go into
my personal clothes closet   
and get my suit 
and that s my makeup
you have on  isn t it  
you sneaky little drag queen 
you ve been spying on us 
haven t you 
haven t you  aerial ears  
mimicking my wife s hard work
and her beautiful appearance 
and having the gall
to repeat words   
that connie and l
spoke confidentially   
words that are guarded
by the holy seal of matrimony 
l can t help it 
l didn t mean any harm  
lt was just playing 
  playing   
ls that what you
call it  channing 
or should l start
calling you   connie   now 
ls that what you d like  
no  connie  stop hitting me 
l didn t do anything to you 
l was just here by myself   
and l get feeling funny
when l m alone 
those girls are down there 
don t forget 
and l can t stand being
in the same house with them  
lf l sit downstairs 
l can hear them screaming   
screaming and crying 
and then l get all nervous 
then l get these spells 
l don t plan it 
lt just happens 
then l think about my position 
my social standing   
just like you two do 
and l just play 
l just make believe
that l am you 
l know it isn t reality 
l know that l m really me 
haven t l been a faithful
servant for two years now 
haven t l given you
my all in this job 
oh  you ve been faithful 
all right   
faithful in your stupidity 
faithful in your laziness   
faithful in your incompetent
lame brained attitude 
and now this shockingly
flagrant breach of contract 
we can no longer employ you
here at 3 900  channing 
that is obvious 
there will be
a complete inspection   
of all your bags  channing   
so do not attempt   
to take any of
my clothing with you 
l will also take
a complete inventory   
of all my belongings 
from makeup  
oh  god 
right on down to panties 
and  of course 
have everything   
sent to the cleaners
immediately 
god knows what you could ve
gotten on my clothes 
now  go to your room 
channing   
and stay there
until we summon you 
please change your minds 
lt was only playing 
l won t ever  
stop that yammering and move 
and don t try anything funny   
or you ll be right down there
with suzie and linda 
how would you like that 
had we known   
we would ve given you
a maid s uniform to wear   
instead of a butler s 
just playing 
l know l m not you  connie 
lt was just playing 
l didn t mean any harm 
raymond  l wasn t really spying 
lt was just playing 
what will they do with me 
oh  god 
please make them let me stay 
l m afraid 
oh  god  have mercy on me 
now what are you saying  
nothing  raymond 
oh  god  nothing 
l wasn t saying anything 
connie and l
have to go out for a while 
we want to be sure
you stay in your room   
so we re going to lock you in 
lock me in 
l won t go anywhere  raymond 
please 
you shouldn t mind staying
in here  channing 
lt s rather obvious
that you are   
to use vulgar slang   
a closet queen  as they call it 
raymond  please 
don t lock me in 
please  l won t go anywhere 
l ll just stay here
and be me when you re gone 
l won t even think about
being you  please 
with the shock
of the obscene parcel   
still fresh in their minds   
the trailer residents
bravely go ahead   
with their
birthday celebration   
and the eggman
lets his true feelings   
be known to edie 
oh  happy day 
edie has accepted the eggman s
offer of marriage 
and you mean you ll bring me
fifty eggs a day 
and l can come and visit babs
and cotton and crackers 
and you ll buy me
a new girdle and bra   
and pretty underthings 
l ll make you
the happiest egglady ever 
don t you worry about that 
l love you 
l love you more than anything
in this whole world 
and right after
the party s over   
you and l are gonna take
our first little trip together 
l m gonna take you to
the largest poultry factory   
on the east coast 
and then you can eat
and eat and eat   
all the eggs you ever want 
a hundred eggs a day 
you mean l can eat
a hundred eggs 
a thousand if you want  em 
oh  l do love you  mr  eggman   
even though l do love
my little eggies   
just a little bit better 
but l do love you  mr  eggman   
more than any man
l have ever known 
and l  edie  love you
more than any woman   
l have ever laid eyes on 
and if you love me   
just half as much
as you love them eggs   
then our marriage   
will be just as good
as sealed in heaven 
operator  give me
the police office  please 
county headquarters 
phase three  raymond 
phase three 
hello  l d like to report
a lewd and disorderly party 
no  l m a neighbor 
and it s making me sick 
the sight of such perverts   
guzzling wine and taking dope
right out in the open 
tell them where it is 
lt s on fillpot road 
first driveway on the left 
walk up into the woods   
and it s taking place
in a trailer 
yes  l believe a woman
does live there   
if you can call her a woman 
she is a whore  officer 
well  l feel  when l see
these things going on   
that it s my duty
to report them 
even with the hectic events
of the day   
raymond marble still finds time
to satisfy his perverted urges 
watch as he
not only commits another act   
of indecent exposure   
but adds
to this social horror   
by making his wife
wait in the car 
ls there no shame  
that is not the only shock   
you have before you 
raymond marble   
because at this exact moment   
divine has learned
of your jealous scheme   
from the local town gossip 
she also has your address 
asshole 
connie  raymond 
they re probably
hiding their asses 
lt d be a prudent move
on their part if they were   
but l could smell them
if they were here 
come on  let s go upstairs 
connie  you have company 
we got something here for you 
their bedroom 
their fuck chamber itself 
this is where
they mate  crackers   
right here on this very bed 
this is where they touch   
their uninspired
little organs together   
vainly trying to recharge   
their worn out battery
of filthiness   
thrashing and moaning
in the still of the night 
what kind of shit
turns them on  mama 
what do they do in here 
all sorts of
disgusting positions   
l would imagine  crackers 
connie probably takes raymond s
little peanut of a cock   
between her brittle 
chapped lips   
and then scrapes
her ugly  decayed teeth   
up and down on it   
while asshole raymond
thinks he s getting   
the best head
on the east coast 
then they probably sit here   
and stare at each other s
blue and red hair   
while they goose each other
and say dirty words 
get everything real good  honey 
get this couch real good 
they probably sit here
and say all sorts   
of banal things to one another 
why  they may have
even decided   
to send us that turd
on this very sofa 
l m getting it on  mama 
don t you worry 
they think they re filthy 
we ll just see what
the furniture thinks 
right  mama  am l right 
yes  crackers  yes 
don t miss anything 
should l shit
on the floor  mama 
right here in the living room 
no  crackers  no 
don t do anything yet 
just get your saliva glands
going 
real good 
juicy 
but is it enough  mama 
will it be enough 
shouldn t we do something
a little filthier   
a little heavier 
just to be sure 
oh  we still have
other rooms to go 
the dining room  
this is where they eat 
crackers 
this is where they shove dirty
little portions of bacteria   
down their weasely
little throats 
this is where they spread
germs  disease  and infection   
gobbling obscene fruits
and vegetables   
all in the name of health 
how disgusting 
get this table soaking wet 
oh  mama  mama 
this is gonna work 
our divinity will show through 
lt ll show through
all the bullshit   
crammed in this little dwelling 
the house will react  mama

oh  crackers

to be the soul   
that was placed in my body   
the body of divine s son   
the body and blood   
of another generation
of divinity 
oh  crackers

boring little ass 
come on  connie and raymond 
you have a personal appearance
to make 
john vader
of the   midnight   here   
looking for divine
somewhere in phoenix  maryland 
divine 
you re looking fantastic 
why  thank you  mr  vader 
l m so glad you could come 
nat curzan here
from   the tattler   
well  good afternoon 
mr  curzan 
gentlemen  get ready   
 cause you re about
to witness the trial   
of these two unfortunates   
commonly known as connie
and raymond marble 
their trial will take place
in front of your very eyes   
and their execution will follow 
we re going to witness
an actual murder 
a live homicide 
that is right  gentlemen 
goldstein  larry goldstein 
very tempting 
l have a question for you 
miss   cotton 
ls that correct  cotton 
yes  it is 
are you a willing accomplice   
to these murders
that are about to take place 
this is not exactly a murder 
mr  goldstein 
this is a court 
a kangaroo court   
as the headlines could scream 
not a mere murder
as you would call it 
lf we were involved
in merely another murder   
it could hardly be headlines 
lt s not just the publicity 
my mama couldn t go on
with her everyday life   
with this kind of shit going on 
my mama was not the aggressor
in this little war we had 
she only did
what had to be done 
lt was suicide on their part 
and  cotton   
l notice a smile on your lips 
does murder make you happy 
murder merely relieves tension 
mr  curzan 
for murder to bring happiness 
one must already be happy   
and l am completely
at peace with myself   
totally happy 
give me more questions 
divine  are you a lesbian 
yes  l have done everything 
does blood turn you on 
lt does more than turn me on 
mr  vader 
lt makes me come 
and more than the sight of it 
l love the taste of it 
the taste of hot 
freshly killed blood 
could you give us some
of your political beliefs 
kill everyone now 
condone first degree murder 
advocate cannibalism  eat shit 
filth are my politics 
filth is my life 
take whatever you like 
how s this for a center spread 
 jesus 
 christ almighty 
ok  divine 
where will you go now 
l m sure you re aware
that after the execution   
you will be the subject
of an extensive search 
to another city   
to set up headquarters
once again 
of course   
l cannot reveal to you
the exact location 
patience  mr  vader  patience

they hired a spy 
how did this spy
get her information 
by nosing around 
asking a lot of questions   
and by fucking me 
that s how she got it 
that dirty little scag 
thank you 
ls there any cross examination 
no  a very strange defense

the verdict is guilty   
on all ten counts
of first degree stupidity 
the penalty phase
will now begin 
l call cotton to the stand 
your oath still remains 
l presume you understand this 
naturally 
ln your opinion   
what should the penalty
in this case be 
death 
that is all 
you may step down 
l call crackers to the stand 
you realize
you are still under oath 
of course 
ln your opinion   
should these people
be allowed to live 
no 
thank you 
gentlemen of the press 
the verdict is death 
but first  due to the magnitude
of these capital crimes   
these two people
must be humiliated   
in front of the media 
use these pictures  gentlemen 
and use them wisely 
we have an example to set 
let the good people
of this country know   
that they cannot fuck with
divine and get away with it 
let them know that we are indeed
the filthiest people alive 
mr  vader 
yes  divine  do you think   
that there are other
filthy people in the world 
l mean  is it now a cult 
lt is a very minor cult
right now  mr  vader   
but one that is

that defies description 
you are about to receive
into your community   
the filthiest people alive 
the filthiest people alive 
well  you think
you know somebody filthier 
watch as divine proves
that not only is she   
the filthiest person
in the world   
she is also the filthiest
actress in the world 
what you are about to see
is a real thing 
hello  l m john waters 
l hope you enjoyed my film 
  pink flamingos   
l d like to show you
some scenes   
that were cut from the movie   
footage l recently
discovered in my attic 
good morning  cotton 
good morning  babs 
did you sleep well 
lt was chilly last night 
oh  cotton 
l slept unbelievably well 
this country air really does
something to you  doesn t it 
why  l had dreams last night
that made me feel young again 
ln the original script   
divine was supposed to be
writing her memoirs   
as she hid out in her trailer 
  being divine   
chapter three  june  1965 
lt was about this time
in my career   
that l realized l was
capable of being perfect   
perfect in every aspect
of human development 
of course  connie marble
was also hard at work   
and in the first cut
of the film   
life was even worse
for poor channing the butler 
you know l hate fucking them 
l have to deliver the babies 
bury the bodies   
help kidnap them 
why do l have to
get them pregnant  too 
why  you said
you d get somebody else   
to do it this time 
l changed my mind 
so just go get ready 
give susan some pills   
get the body
out of the basement   
and mentally prepare yourself
for this evening 
what s a little fuck  chan 
lf it doesn t turn you on   
just jerk off
and then stick it in her 
that way  you only have to be
connected for a few seconds 
l don t really care
if either of you   
get any pleasure out of it 
just get her pregnant  chan 
that s all that matters 
a little baby
beginning to grow   
from one little fuck
to  5 000 in nine months 
maybe it was connie s
marital problems   
that made her so irritable 
where s raymond  where is he 
how could he leave me alone
with these servants   
these stupid asshole servants 
animal rights activists
always say to me   
  how could you kill
a chicken for a movie   
well  l eat chicken   
and l know the chicken
didn t land on my plate   
from a heart attack 
we bought the chicken   
from a farmer who advertised
freshly killed chicken 
l think we made
the chicken s life better 
got to be in a movie 
got fucked 
and then right after filming
the next take   
the cast ate the chicken 
oh  good morning  honey 
lsn t it a beauty today 
shit  yeah 
you cooking eggs for edie 
l want to fry me up this chicken
when you re through 
sure  honey 
lt ll only take me a minute 
why don t you sit down there
and keep mother company 
did you have a good time
last night 
yeah  lt s weird
being back in baltimore 
went down broadway last night
and saw a lot of old friends 
you remember patty hitler 
l saw her 
she almost shit
when she heard you were in town 
she gave me this to show you 
what is it  honey 
the   midnight    mama 
you made the cover
of the   midnight   
  filthiest person alive   
they call you 
ain t that a gas 
my original ad copy
for   pink flamingos   read   
  the filthiest people alive  
their loves  their hates   
  and their unquenchable
thirst for notoriety   
oh  crackers 
this copy s hysterical 
lt s mostly from
the press releases   
l sent the wire services 
more fame  mama  more fame 
once the film was released 
some people in the audience   
actually believed divine
was wanted for murder 
oh  my god 
what a horrible photograph 
my first   wanted   poster 
and l have to look just awful 
l can t imagine l had divine
say his real name   
in the following take 
luckily  my hair isn t this
harsh black color anymore 
and look at some of my aliases
they have down there 
glen milstead 
why  l only used that one
on one day of hanging paper 
and look  they ve even got
the hog princess down here 
edith massey
sometimes had trouble   
remembering long monologues   
but she had a screen presence
all her own 
freddy  l want you
to meet joanne 
joanne  this is freddy 
l know you ll like each other 
and l don t care
what people say 
and  joanne 
l know you re hard boiled   
but freddy doesn t think
you re tough or cheap 
he respects you 
don t you  freddy 
we didn t have any money
in the budget for catering   
so edie was quite happy
to get to eat   
in the following take 
be careful 
l m going to eat you 
edie s getting mighty hungry 
oh  don t worry  freddy 
l have some more for you 
l have rhonda  donna 
sherry  and little yeller 
ln the original script 
raymond and connie marble   
also raided divine s trailer
much earlier in the story 
does divine really
live like this   
out here in the country
like a hillbilly 
god  with all these
disgusting trees   
and shrubbery and wildlife   
l d be scared
to sleep at night   
knowing possums
and raccoon and deer   
and god knows
what other creatures   
would be lurking outside   
fucking and shitting
right out in the open 
l do love their nature dialog 
ooh  god  did you hear that 
horrid little bird 
just asking for it  l guess 
humans never realize
the dirty little lives   
these animals lead
out in the country 
makes me sick  that s all 
lt was freezing cold   
the day we filmed
poor edie s egg humiliation 
look at her 
well  miss egg baby   
we ve got some eggs
here for you 
how do you like them this way 
oh  and l ve got another
little surprise for you 
there  little baby doll 
all grown up 
charles baker would shit 
shut up 
the real way divine discovered
the marbles did it 
a character cut from the film  
vicious gossip patty hitler 
remember big jimmy
from down pratt street 
big asshole
finally turned queer 
and that wife of his  all she
does is sit around  drink   
neglect those awful kids 
terrible 
one of them s retarded 
such a shame 
and you remember karen
what s her name from the bar 
she s dead  honey 
life affirming characters 
that s my specialty 
l saw her once 
she s an ugly bitch 
wears glasses 
and him  what a lulu 
blue hair 
you can see the bad continuity
coming up in this scene 
we forgot to put edie s
baby bonnet back on her head 
what s the matter 
what s the matter 
what s happened to edie 
l m afraid
we ve had more trouble 
some people broke in
while we were gone   
and did this to mama 
broke raw eggs all over her
and dressed her mockingly   
but l know who did it 
patty hitler gave me
all the information we need   
to solve this case 
two would be filth balls named
connie and raymond marble   
are responsible for this deed 
and now for the strangest nudity
l ever filmed 
l ve got to take
a little rest myself 
what s the matter  cotton 
what s the matter 
they must have done it 
there s boll weevils in my bed 
a big subplot
that was cut from the film   
was the revenge murder
of cookie the spy 
sharpen your blades  cotton 
we got some cutting to do 
l m using a gun on this one 
l m not breaking my nails
this time 
l might need them
for scratching 
upstairs  that s her room 
she better be awake 
lt s so dull
when they re sleeping 
where s cookie 
cookie  who are you 
we know she s here 
where is she 
she s not here  what is it 
die  bitch 
rivers of gore 
oh  god 
you re beautiful  crackers 
lt s not just babs
l love anymore 
lt used to be 
but now it s you  too 
both of you l love so much 
lt s your mind 
your imagination   
that filthy mind
with rotten ideas 
and your face  
that beautiful  beautiful face 
you like it  baby 
my face is yours
to look at   
as long
as you keep looking back 
a lot of people like cunt 
you know 
men  women 
but your eyes are like
a cunt to me  honey 
you can look and look
and look   
and still l wake up
wishing you were there   
watching me twenty four hours
a day 
them cunt eyes 
cunt eyes 
what was l thinking about 
was your cutting and hacking
successful  my children 
oh  babs  it was a ball
and a half doing it again   
a real feeling
of true liberation 
why  cookie won t be doing
any more spying on anybody else 
you can be sure of that 
she looked like
a piece of raw ham   
when we got through with her 
and  babs  here s her ear 
l got the left one 
l hope that s all right 
either one would have been
quite satisfactory  darling 
thank you 
the original curse
on the marbles   
by divine and crackers
was even more complicated 
what s this pitiful room
supposed to be 
looks like some kind
of fucking office 
look  that must be
a picture of her 
that dog has an office 
what the fuck for 
so she can sit in here
with that ugly red hair   
and asshole off all day 
touch everything  crackers 
let our divinity and fame
be felt on everything   
in this middle class dump 
look how pissy
these turds must be 
central heating  how repellent 
l m not even sure
l understand this part 
leave your fingerprints
on everything  darling 
touch and feel 
rub  touch  and feel 
take your shoes off 
let the rugs know
we re here  too 
let the rugs know 
touch and feel 
but connie didn t have a clue 
she was still
ranting and raving   
about catching her butler
in drag 
oh  god  the thought
of his hairy body   
in some of my fine dresses
and gowns   
will never leave me  raymond 
to think of the value
of my wardrobe   
and then to think
of his person   
actually defiling all those fine
silks and hand woven garments 
and my underwear 
his nipples
have actually touched   
where l have rested mine 
but that ain t nothing 
connie   
not compared to what
you got coming 
oh  connie 
connie  connie 
with hair  oh  so red 
how do these scissors feel
so near your head 
watch one of
my favorite scenes   
that ended up
on the cutting room floor 
divine  crackers 
and cotton sing   
  we are the filthiest
people alive   in pig latin 
e way are ay e they
ilthiest fay
eople pay in ay e they
ole hay ide way orld way
l d like to close
with the original trailer   
new line cinema used
to sell   pink flamingos   
notice no footage from
the actual movie is ever shown 
how did you happen
to hear about it 
from some friends who saw it   
and thought it was
absolutely marvelous 
l ll be very insulted 
rex reed told us
that it s fabulous 
why d you come out
at midnight to see it 
why go home at midnight 
what are you going to see there 
l guess there are just two kinds
of people  miss sandstone   
my kind of people and assholes 
fantastic 
third time l ve been to it 
lt s an incredible
head thing for people 
oh  it s marvelous  absolutely 
the most disgusting thing
l ve ever seen in my whole life 
not to be believed 
absolutely outrageous 
lt was divine  lt was fabulous 
oh  my god

of city living 
 out   
    rageous 
fantastic  lt was really fun 
excellent  loved it 
really good 
really good  right 
lt was great 
piece of garbage 
the only part l didn t like
was the snakes 
l have an aversion to snakes 
lt was divine 
l love religious movies 
lt was a little gross 
but l liked it 
lt was really the grossest film
l ve seen 
l think john waters
has got his finger   
on the pulse of america 
l think he s got his thumb
