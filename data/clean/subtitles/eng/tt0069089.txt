for dreamland studios
this beautiful mobile home
you see before you
is the current hideout of
the notorious beauty divine
the filthiest person alive
because of this cover story
in one of your sleazier
national tabloids
she has been forced
to go underground
disguising her appearance
and adopting the alias
of babs johnson
with her live her trusted
traveling companion cotton
her delinquent son crackers
and her mentally ill mother
miss edie

lll be right back
across town located in
the teeming metropolis
known as downtown baltimore
live connie and raymond marble
two jealous perverts
that hate divines
fame and notoriety
more than anything
in the whole world
for connie and raymond marble
it was the beginning of the end
well miss sandstone
after looking over
your qualifications
my husband and l have decided
that youre not exactly
what we had in mind
for the job
not only have you
never heard of divine
which is one
of the key elements
for this particular job
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience
and to be honest we feel
you are sort of a dullard
why do you say that
l did everything you asked
l even found out
who this divine was
too late too late
and naturally you did
everything l asked my dear
you would never have
gotten to this plateau
of the job placement test
l mean surely
you can see our point
were not in a position
to just take anyone
this is a highsecurity job
as you can well imagine
and we personally just dont
feel that you meet our
oh how should l say
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process
well why did you
hold me up for so long
why did you keep
asking me to come back
l had another job
l couldve taken
how could l have gotten
information
about this divine you talk of
l dont know her
you couldve given me
some lead as to how
l couldve gathered this data
you wanted about her
you led me to believe
l had this job
well miss sandstone
miss uh sandy sandstone
you just mustve been wrong in
your assumptions werent you
l mean surely
youve heard the expression
dont count your chickens
well apply it
l never gave you a final answer
on this whole thing
and as far as you believing
that you had the job
well lve never even
considered
that you would be the applicant
that we would choose
you dont know enough
l mean l wish everyone
was like you
and had never heard of divine
but unfortunately
it just isnt like that
now if you wouldnt mind
l do have a busy day
ahead of me
theres really nothing
left to discuss
well what am l
supposed to do now
thats what ld like to know
you can eat shit for all
l care miss sandstone
or eat anything that you like
or do anything that you like
just dont assume that l want
to know your troubles
now if you wouldnt mind
lm a busy woman
with a full days work
ahead of me
please remove yourself
from my office
youre a real cunt
do you know that
a real fucking cunt
how can you be
so shitty to people
how can you stand yourself
l guess theres just two kinds
of people miss sandstone
my kind of people and assholes
lts rather obvious
which category you fit into
have a nice day
eat the bird bitch
you ready ma
you ready yet
lm ready darling
just let me say goodbye
to mama and cotton
lll be out in a minute honey
ok ma but get the lead
out of your ass

you are a wonderful
wonderful person
thank you
well thank you ladies
lf it wasnt for you l wouldnt
be in this business
and thats all l care about
is satisfying my customers
and making sure
that the babies
are placed in good homes
thank you
byebye now
well see whos
the filthiest person alive
well just see
and where is that raymond
where is he
how could he leave me alone
when theres so much
to be taken care of
please come home raymond
l need you so badly
can you hurry driver
lll be late for my appointment
lm going as fast as l can
lady without breaking the law
3800 greymeadow right
thats what l said wasnt it
you can shove 230 hack
why hello cookie
l do hope youre hungry
l could go for a sandwich
bologna
well
lll get right to the point
l can get you information
about divine
lots of information l think
if things go well today
l have a date
with her son crackers
well this is of course
an encouraging development
this is an important
assignment cookie
we could all benefit
you financially
and raymond and l
well our social standing
is involved to a great degree
l may have to degrade myself
in front of divines son
hes into a very strange
sex scene
lm going to have to put up
with unheard of atrocities
in order to pump the information
you need out of him
but first l have to know
exactly what you want to know
because my socalled date
is this afternoon
well cookie as you know
divine has achieved
a sort of fame lately
both locally
and on the national level
you may have heard the term
the filthiest person alive
l have heard the term yes
the papers call her that
and she is known as that
to a limited extent
in your more crimeconscious
sections of the city
well we feel this to be
an untrue statement
we feel that raymond
and l far surpass her
in every aspect
of the term filth
as you know we run a baby ring
oh its really
a very simple process
we keep two girls
at all times
who are impregnated
by channing
our rather fertile servant
we sell the babies
to lesbian couples
and then we invest the money
in various businesses
around town
we own a few
pornography shops
plus we front money
to a chain of heroin pushers
in the inner city
elementary schools
we feel that the attention
thats been focused
on divine lately
is most unfair
she is merely a common thief
and murderer
unfortunately for us
our line of work
limits our chances
for publicity and travel
but this does not mean
that we wish to go unnoticed
after all weve not
worked all these years
in order to be upstaged
by this fat hog
that calls herself divine
so we must catch her
off guard you see
before she realizes
she is being attacked
we need information
as to how they live
where they live
how many people their names
their daily schedules
for the week
ln other words
we want to know how
we can plague her the most
how we can make her life
as miserable as possible
how we can prove to her
that she is shit
compared to us
shit compared to the filth
that we have in our minds
shit compared to what we know
to be the filthiest delight
well does crackers know
that his socalled date
is actually a spy
sent by the marbles
this is my grandma edie
whats the matter with her
whats the matter with her
there aint nothing
the matter with her
shes just my grandma
thats all
why are those eggs
all over her face
l guess she was just hungry
thats all
you see she sort of
has some problems
nothing serious but you know
l mean she just loves eggs
always has
sit tight lll go see
if miss cottons up yet
shes here miss cotton

lt shouldnt be long now
before l get it going

a package like this
the return address is
the filthiest people alive
who would dare use that title
who would dare
wrapped all fancy
lts just a birthday present
babs
no its no birthday present
cotton
l smell deep dark trouble
oh my god almighty
someone has sent me
a bowel movement
oh babs
a turd mama a turd
who couldve sent this
a turd
oh a turd oh babs
this is a direct attack
on my divinity
a direct attack
on the peace and harmony
of our last few weeks here
an outrageous attempt
to humiliate and disgrace
my private life
someone will pay for this
someone will pay with their life
for this grossly offensive act
mama nobody sends you a turd
and expects to live nobody
why would anybody
do this to us why
look look heres a card

lts a birthday card
a fucking birthday card
well what does it say
oh god babs
happy birthday fatso
you are no longer

we are
signed the filthiest
people alive
just as l thought
a deliberate attempt
to seize my title
eggman didnt do it babs
l know the eggman didnt do it
l dont think he did
either mother
now shut up
and let me think will you
that cookie was asking
questions crackers
l heard her
shes right ma shes right
but why would she
send us a turd
who knows who knows
these are obviously
jealous people
jealous of our careers
of all of our press
why else would they sign that
the filthiest people alive
everyone knows that that title
has become my trademark
why to use it in this way
is only to insinuate that
they are filthier than l
how could anyone
seriously believe that
how could anyone
be filthier than divine
lm afraid
our little vacation
must come to an end
this must be nipped in the bud
lts already out of hand
now we must outfilth
the asshole or assholes
that sent this
and then they must die
connie and raymond marble
while you are away
the servants will play
well miss sandstone
after going over
your qualifications
mr marble and l feel
that you are not exactly
what we had in mind
for the job
not only have you never
heard of divine
which is one
of the key elements
for this particular job
but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience
and to be perfectly honest
we feel that you are
sort of a dullard
why isnt channing here
to take off my coat
hes getting lazier and lazier
as each day ends raymond
lll speak to him
we must remember that channing
isnt as intelligent as us
this is a high security job
as you can well imagine
and we personally
just dont feel
that you meet our
oh how should l say
our admittedly sometimes
stringent screening process
who on earth is that
sounds like channing
well doing what
ld like to know
l love you raymond
l love you more than
anything in this world
l love you
more than my own filthiness
even more
than my own hair color
more than the sound
of bones breaking
the sound of the death rattle
oh my
and l connie
l connie also love you
more than anything
l could ever imagine
more than
my own hair color
more than the sound
of babies screaming
the sound of dogs dying
what do you think
youre doing
what is the meaning
of this outrage
let me at him
lve been waiting
to do this for a lifetime
no connie no
how do you dare to be
dressed as you are
how do you dare to be saying
the things we heard you say
no please listen
l didnt mean any harm
let me go connie
you little asshole
youd better start explaining
how dare you go into
my personal clothes closet
and get my suit
and thats my makeup
you have on isnt it
you sneaky little drag queen
youve been spying on us
havent you
havent you aerialears
mimicking my wifes hard work
and her beautiful appearance
and having the gall
to repeat words
that connie and l
spoke confidentially
words that are guarded
by the holy seal of matrimony
l cant help it
l didnt mean any harm
lt was just playing
playing
ls that what you
call it channing
or should l start
calling you connie now
ls that what youd like
no connie stop hitting me
l didnt do anything to you
l was just here by myself
and l get feeling funny
when lm alone
those girls are down there
dont forget
and l cant stand being
in the same house with them
lf l sit downstairs
l can hear them screaming
screaming and crying
and then l get all nervous
then l get these spells
l dont plan it
lt just happens
then l think about my position
my social standing
just like you two do
and l just play
l just make believe
that l am you
l know it isnt reality
l know that lm really me
havent l been a faithful
servant for two years now
havent l given you
my all in this job
oh youve been faithful
all right
faithful in your stupidity
faithful in your laziness
faithful in your incompetent
lamebrained attitude
and now this shockingly
flagrant breach of contract
we can no longer employ you
here at 3900 channing
that is obvious
there will be
a complete inspection
of all your bags channing
so do not attempt
to take any of
my clothing with you
l will also take
a complete inventory
of all my belongings
from makeup
oh god
right on down to panties
and of course
have everything
sent to the cleaners
immediately
god knows what you couldve
gotten on my clothes
now go to your room
channing
and stay there
until we summon you
please change your minds
lt was only playing
l wont ever
stop that yammering and move
and dont try anything funny
or youll be right down there
with suzie and linda
how would you like that
had we known
we wouldve given you
a maids uniform to wear
instead of a butlers
just playing
l know lm not you connie
lt was just playing
l didnt mean any harm
raymond l wasnt really spying
lt was just playing
what will they do with me
oh god
please make them let me stay
lm afraid
oh god have mercy on me
now what are you saying
nothing raymond
oh god nothing
l wasnt saying anything
connie and l
have to go out for a while
we want to be sure
you stay in your room
so were going to lock you in
lock me in
l wont go anywhere raymond
please
you shouldnt mind staying
in here channing
lts rather obvious
that you are
to use vulgar slang
a closet queen as they call it
raymond please
dont lock me in
please l wont go anywhere
lll just stay here
and be me when youre gone
l wont even think about
being you please
with the shock
of the obscene parcel
still fresh in their minds
the trailer residents
bravely go ahead
with their
birthday celebration
and the eggman
lets his true feelings
be known to edie
oh happy day
edie has accepted the eggmans
offer of marriage
and you mean youll bring me
fifty eggs a day
and l can come and visit babs
and cotton and crackers
and youll buy me
a new girdle and bra
and pretty underthings
lll make you
the happiest egglady ever
dont you worry about that
l love you
l love you more than anything
in this whole world
and right after
the partys over
you and l are gonna take
our first little trip together
lm gonna take you to
the largest poultry factory
on the east coast
and then you can eat
and eat and eat
all the eggs you ever want
a hundred eggs a day
you mean l can eat
a hundred eggs
a thousand if you want em
oh l do love you mr eggman
even though l do love
my little eggies
just a little bit better
but l do love you mr eggman
more than any man
l have ever known
and l edie love you
more than any woman
l have ever laid eyes on
and if you love me
just half as much
as you love them eggs
then our marriage
will be just as good
as sealed in heaven
operator give me
the police office please
county headquarters
phase three raymond
phase three
hello ld like to report
a lewd and disorderly party
no lm a neighbor
and its making me sick
the sight of such perverts
guzzling wine and taking dope
right out in the open
tell them where it is
lts on fillpot road
first driveway on the left
walk up into the woods
and its taking place
in a trailer
yes l believe a woman
does live there
if you can call her a woman
she is a whore officer
well l feel when l see
these things going on
that its my duty
to report them
even with the hectic events
of the day
raymond marble still finds time
to satisfy his perverted urges
watch as he
not only commits another act
of indecent exposure
but adds
to this social horror
by making his wife
wait in the car
ls there no shame
that is not the only shock
you have before you
raymond marble
because at this exact moment
divine has learned
of your jealous scheme
from the local town gossip
she also has your address
asshole
connie raymond
theyre probably
hiding their asses
ltd be a prudent move
on their part if they were
but l could smell them
if they were here
come on lets go upstairs
connie you have company
we got something here for you
their bedroom
their fuck chamber itself
this is where
they mate crackers
right here on this very bed
this is where they touch
their uninspired
little organs together
vainly trying to recharge
their wornout battery
of filthiness
thrashing and moaning
in the still of the night
what kind of shit
turns them on mama
what do they do in here
all sorts of
disgusting positions
l would imagine crackers
connie probably takes raymonds
little peanut of a cock
between her brittle
chapped lips
and then scrapes
her ugly decayed teeth
up and down on it
while asshole raymond
thinks hes getting
the best head
on the east coast
then they probably sit here
and stare at each others
blue and red hair
while they goose each other
and say dirty words
get everything real good honey
get this couch real good
they probably sit here
and say all sorts
of banal things to one another
why they may have
even decided
to send us that turd
on this very sofa
lm getting it on mama
dont you worry
they think theyre filthy
well just see what
the furniture thinks
right mama am l right
yes crackers yes
dont miss anything
should l shit
on the floor mama
right here in the living room
no crackers no
dont do anything yet
just get your saliva glands
going
real good
juicy
but is it enough mama
will it be enough
shouldnt we do something
a little filthier
a little heavier
just to be sure
oh we still have
other rooms to go
the dining room
this is where they eat
crackers
this is where they shove dirty
little portions of bacteria
down their weasely
little throats
this is where they spread
germs disease and infection
gobbling obscene fruits
and vegetables
all in the name of health
how disgusting
get this table soaking wet
oh mama mama
this is gonna work
our divinity will show through
ltll show through
all the bullshit
crammed in this little dwelling
the house will react mama

that is right gentlemen
goldstein larry goldstein
very tempting
l have a question for you
misscotton
ls that correct cotton
yes it is
are you a willing accomplice
to these murders
that are about to take place
this is not exactly a murder
mr goldstein
this is a court
a kangaroo court
as the headlines could scream
not a mere murder
as you would call it
lf we were involved
in merely another murder
it could hardly be headlines
lts not just the publicity
my mama couldnt go on
with her everyday life
with this kind of shit going on
my mama was not the aggressor
in this little war we had
she only did
what had to be done
lt was suicide on their part
and cotton
l notice a smile on your lips
does murder make you happy
murder merely relieves tension
mr curzan
for murder to bring happiness
one must already be happy
and l am completely
at peace with myself
totally happy
give me more questions
divine are you a lesbian
yes l have done everything
does blood turn you on
lt does more than turn me on
mr vader
lt makes me come
and more than the sight of it
l love the taste of it
the taste of hot
freshly killed blood
could you give us some
of your political beliefs
kill everyone now
condone firstdegree murder
advocate cannibalism eat shit
filth are my politics
filth is my life
take whatever you like
hows this for a center spread
jesus
christ almighty
ok divine
where will you go now
lm sure youre aware
that after the execution
you will be the subject
of an extensive search
to another city
to set up headquarters
once again
of course
l cannot reveal to you
the exact location
patience mr vader patience
another time another story
and now for the trial
you sit here
back here

this is a court of law
l call to the stand
miss cotton
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth

how did this spy
get her information
by nosing around
asking a lot of questions
and by fucking me
thats how she got it
that dirty little scag
thank you
ls there any crossexamination
no a very strange defense
l must say
you may step down
gentlemen
the verdict is guilty
on all ten counts
of firstdegree stupidity
the penalty phase
will now begin
l call cotton to the stand
your oath still remains
l presume you understand this
naturally
ln your opinion
what should the penalty
in this case be
death
that is all
you may step down
l call crackers to the stand
you realize
you are still under oath
of course
ln your opinion
should these people
be allowed to live
no
thank you
gentlemen of the press
the verdict is death
but first due to the magnitude
of these capital crimes
these two people
must be humiliated
in front of the media
use these pictures gentlemen
and use them wisely
we have an example to set
let the good people
of this country know
that they cannot fuck with
divine and get away with it
let them know that we are indeed
the filthiest people alive
mr vader
yes divine do you think
that there are other
filthy people in the world
l mean is it now a cult
lt is a very minor cult
right now mr vader
but one that is
growing and growing
growing faster
than you could imagine
l will be queen one day
and my coronation
will be celebrated
all over the world
do not forgetl am divine

something to you doesnt it
why l had dreams last night
that made me feel young again
ln the original script
divine was supposed to be
writing her memoirs
as she hid out in her trailer
being divine
chapter three june 1965
lt was about this time
in my career
that l realized l was
capable of being perfect
perfect in every aspect
of human development
of course connie marble
was also hard at work
and in the first cut
of the film
life was even worse
for poor channing the butler
you know l hate fucking them
l have to deliver the babies
bury the bodies
help kidnap them
why do l have to
get them pregnant too
why you said
youd get somebody else
to do it this time
l changed my mind
so just go get ready
give susan some pills
get the body
out of the basement
and mentally prepare yourself
for this evening
whats a little fuck chan
lf it doesnt turn you on
just jerk off
and then stick it in her
that way you only have to be
connected for a few seconds
l dont really care
if either of you
get any pleasure out of it
just get her pregnant chan
thats all that matters
a little baby
beginning to grow
from one little fuck
to 5000 in nine months
maybe it was connies
marital problems
that made her so irritable
wheres raymond where is he
how could he leave me alone
with these servants
these stupid asshole servants
animal rights activists
always say to me
how could you kill
a chicken for a movie
well l eat chicken
and l know the chicken
didnt land on my plate
from a heart attack
we bought the chicken
from a farmer who advertised
freshly killed chicken
l think we made
the chickens life better
got to be in a movie
got fucked
and then right after filming
the next take
the cast ate the chicken
oh good morning honey
lsnt it a beauty today

l want to fry me up this chicken
when youre through

ltll only take me a minute
why dont you sit down there
and keep mother company

being back in baltimore
went down broadway last night
and saw a lot of old friends

l saw her
she almost shit
when she heard you were in town
she gave me this to show you
what is it honey
the midnight mama
you made the cover
of the midnight
filthiest person alive

aint that a gas
my original ad copy
for pink flamingos read
the filthiest people alive
their loves their hates
and their unquenchable
thirst for notoriety
oh crackers
this copys hysterical
lts mostly from
the press releases
l sent the wire services
more fame mama more fame
once the film was released
some people in the audience
actually believed divine
was wanted for murder
oh my god
what a horrible photograph
my first wanted poster
and l have to look just awful
l cant imagine l had divine
say his real name
in the following take
luckily my hair isnt this
harsh black color anymore
and look at some of my aliases
they have down there
glen milstead
why l only used that one
on one day of hanging paper
and look theyve even got
the hog princess down here
edith massey
sometimes had trouble
remembering long monologues
but she had a screen presence
all her own
freddy l want you
to meet joanne
joanne this is freddy
l know youll like each other
and l dont care
what people say
and joanne
l know youre hardboiled
but freddy doesnt think
youre tough or cheap
he respects you
dont you freddy
we didnt have any money
in the budget for catering
so edie was quite happy
to get to eat
in the following take
be careful
lm going to eat you
edies getting mighty hungry
oh dont worry freddy
l have some more for you
l have rhonda donna
sherry and little yeller
ln the original script
raymond and connie marble
also raided divines trailer
much earlier in the story
does divine really
live like this
out here in the country
like a hillbilly
god with all these
disgusting trees
and shrubbery and wildlife
ld be scared
to sleep at night
knowing possums
and raccoon and deer
and god knows
what other creatures
would be lurking outside
fucking and shitting
right out in the open
l do love their nature dialog
ooh god did you hear that
horrid little bird
just asking for it l guess
humans never realize
the dirty little lives
these animals lead
out in the country
makes me sick thats all
lt was freezing cold
the day we filmed
poor edies egg humiliation
look at her
well miss egg baby
weve got some eggs
here for you
how do you like them this way
oh and lve got another
little surprise for you
there little baby doll
all grown up
charles baker would shit
shut up
the real way divine discovered
the marbles did it
a character cut from the film
vicious gossip patty hitler
remember big jimmy
from down pratt street
big asshole
finally turned queer
and that wife of his all she
does is sit around drink
neglect those awful kids
terrible
one of thems retarded
such a shame
and you remember karen
whatshername from the bar
shes dead honey
lifeaffirming characters
thats my specialty
l saw her once
shes an ugly bitch
wears glasses
and himwhat a lulu
blue hair
you can see the bad continuity
coming up in this scene
we forgot to put edies
baby bonnet back on her head
whats the matter
whats the matter
whats happened to edie
lm afraid
weve had more trouble
some people broke in
while we were gone
and did this to mama
broke raw eggs all over her
and dressed her mockingly
but l know who did it
patty hitler gave me
all the information we need
to solve this case
two wouldbe filth balls named
connie and raymond marble
are responsible for this deed
and now for the strangest nudity
l ever filmed
lve got to take
a little rest myself
whats the matter cotton
whats the matter
they must have done it
theres boll weevils in my bed
a big subplot
that was cut from the film
was the revenge murder
of cookie the spy
sharpen your blades cotton
we got some cutting to do
lm using a gun on this one
lm not breaking my nails
this time
l might need them
for scratching
upstairs thats her room
she better be awake
lts so dull
when theyre sleeping
wheres cookie
cookie who are you
we know shes here
where is she
shes not here what is it
die bitch
rivers of gore
oh god
youre beautiful crackers
lts not just babs
l love anymore
lt used to be
but now its you too
both of you l love so much
lts your mind
your imagination
that filthy mind
with rotten ideas
and your face
that beautiful beautiful face
you like it baby
my face is yours
to look at
as long
as you keep looking back
a lot of people like cunt
you know
men women
but your eyes are like
a cunt to me honey
you can look and look
and look
and still l wake up
wishing you were there
watching me twentyfour hours
a day
them cunt eyes
cunt eyes
what was l thinking about
was your cutting and hacking
successful my children
oh babs it was a ball
and a half doing it again
a real feeling
of true liberation
why cookie wont be doing
any more spying on anybody else
you can be sure of that
she looked like
a piece of raw ham
when we got through with her
and babs heres her ear
l got the left one
l hope thats all right
either one would have been
quite satisfactory darling
thank you
the original curse
on the marbles
by divine and crackers
was even more complicated
whats this pitiful room
supposed to be
looks like some kind
of fucking office
look that must be
a picture of her
that dog has an office
what the fuck for
so she can sit in here
with that ugly red hair
and asshole off all day
touch everything crackers
let our divinity and fame
be felt on everything
in this middleclass dump
look how pissy
these turds must be
central heating how repellent
lm not even sure
l understand this part
leave your fingerprints
on everything darling
touch and feel
rub touch and feel
take your shoes off
let the rugs know
were here too
let the rugs know
touch and feel
but connie didnt have a clue
she was still
ranting and raving
about catching her butler
in drag
oh god the thought
of his hairy body
in some of my fine dresses
and gowns
will never leave me raymond
to think of the value
of my wardrobe
and then to think
of his person
actually defiling all those fine
silks and handwoven garments
and my underwear
his nipples
have actually touched
where l have rested mine
but that aint nothing
connie
not compared to what
you got coming
oh connie
connie connie
with hair oh so red
how do these scissors feel
so near your head
watch one of
my favorite scenes
that ended up
on the cutting room floor
divine crackers
and cotton sing
we are the filthiest
people alive in pig latin
eway areay ethey

ld like to close
with the original trailer
new line cinema used
to sell pink flamingos
notice no footage from
the actual movie is ever shown
how did you happen
to hear about it
from some friends who saw it
and thought it was
absolutely marvelous
lll be very insulted
rex reed told us
that its fabulous
whyd you come out
at midnight to see it
why go home at midnight
what are you going to see there
l guess there are just two kinds
of people miss sandstone
my kind of people and assholes
fantastic
third time lve been to it
lts an incredible
head thing for people
oh its marvelous absolutely
the most disgusting thing
lve ever seen in my whole life
not to be believed
absolutely outrageous
lt was divine lt was fabulous
oh my god
what are you doing
lts absolutely better
than cries and whispers
l think its the future
of city living
out
rageous
fantastic lt was really fun
excellent loved it
really good
really good right
lt was great
piece of garbage
the only part l didnt like
was the snakes
l have an aversion to snakes
lt was divine
l love religious movies
lt was a little gross
but l liked it
lt was really the grossest film
lve seen
l think john waters
has got his finger
on the pulse of america
l think hes got his thumb
