deactivate the security shield 
the security deflector shield
will be deactivated   
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission 
stand by 
you are clear to proceed 
we re starting our approach 
inform the commander
that lord vader s shuttle has arrived 
sir 
lord vader  this is an unexpected
pleasure  we re honoured 
you may dispense
with the pleasantries  commander 
i m here to put you back on schedule 
i assure you  lord vader 
my men are working as fast as they can 
perhaps i can find
new ways to motivate them 
i tell you this station
will be operational as planned 
the emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation 
but he asks the impossible 
i need more men 
then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives 
  the emperor s coming here 
  that is correct  commander   
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress 
we shall double our efforts 
i hope so  commander  for your sake 
the emperor is not
as forgiving as i am 
of course i m worried 
and you should be too 
lando calrissian and poor chewbacca
never returned from this awful place 
don t be so sure 
if i told you half the things
i ve heard about this jabba the hutt   
you d probably short circuit 
r2  are you sure
this is the right place 
i d better knock  i suppose 
there doesn t seem to be anyone here 
let s go back and tell master luke 
goodness gracious me 
i don t think
they re going to let us in  r2 
we d better go 
r2  wait 
oh  dear  r2 
r2  i really don t think
we should rush into all this 
oh  r2 
r2  wait for me 
just you deliver master luke s message
and get us out of here 
oh  my 
oh  no 
oh  my 
we bring a message
to your master  jabba the hutt 
and a gift 
what gift 
he says that our instructions
are to give it only to jabba himself 
i m terribly sorry  i m afraid he s ever
so stubborn about these sort of things 
r2  i have a bad feeling about this 
good morning 
the message  r2 
the message 
greetings  exalted one 
allow me to introduce myself 
i am luke skywalker 
jedi knight and friend to captain solo 
i know that you are powerful 
mighty jabba   
and that your anger with solo
must be equally powerful 
i seek an audience with your greatness
to bargain for solo s life 
with your wisdom  i m sure
we can work out an arrangement   
which will be mutually beneficial   
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation 
as a token of my goodwill 
i present to you a gift   
these two droids 
what did he say 
both are hard working
and will serve you well 
this can t be 
r2  you re playing the wrong message 
he s no jedi 
there will be no bargain 
we re doomed 
i will not give up
my favourite decoration 
i like captain solo where he is 
r2  look  captain solo 
and he s still frozen in carbonite 
what could possibly
have come over master luke 
was it something i did  he never
expressed any unhappiness with my work 
how horrid 
good  new acquisitions 
you are a protocol droid 
are you not 
i am c 3po   
yes or no will do 
well  yes 
how many languages do you speak 
i am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily   
splendid  we have been
without an interpreter   
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid   
and disintegrated him 
disintegrated 
guard  this protocol droid
might be useful 
fit him with a restraining bolt   
and take him back up to
his excellency s main audience chamber 
r2  don t leave me 
you re a feisty little one   
but you ll soon learn some respect 
i have need for you on
the master s sail barge   
and i think you ll fill in nicely 
ah  do that again 
i have come for the bounty
on this wookiee 
oh  no  chewbacca 
at last we have the mighty chewbacca 
yes  i am here 
your worshipfulness 
yes 
the illustrious jabba
bids you welcome   
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25 000 
i want 50 000  no less 
 50 000  no less  
what did i say 
the mighty jabba asks why
he must pay 50 000 
because he s holding
a thermal detonator 
this bounty hunter
is my kind of scum   
fearless and inventive 
jabba offers the sum of 35   
and i do suggest you take it 
he agrees 
just relax for a moment 
you re free of the carbonite 
you have hibernation sickness 
  i can t see 
  your eyesight will return in time 
  where am i 
  jabba s palace 
who are you 
  someone who loves you 
  leia 
i gotta get you out of here 
what s that 
i know that laugh 
hey  jabba 
look  jabba  i was just
on my way to pay you back 
i got a little sidetracked 
it s not my fault 
it s too late for that  solo 
you may have been a good smuggler   
but now you re bantha fodder 
look   
take him away 
jabba  i ll pay you triple 
you re throwing away a fortune here 
don t be a fool 
bring her to me 
we have powerful friends 
you re gonna regret this 
i m sure 
i can t bear to watch 
chewie 
chewie  is that you 
wait a minute 
i can t see  pal 
what s going on 
luke  luke s crazy 
he can t even take care of himself 
much less rescue anybody 
a jedi knight 
i m out of it for a little while 
everybody gets delusions of grandeur 
i m all right  pal 
i m all right 
i must speak with jabba 
no bargain 
you will take me to jabba now 
you serve your master well 
and you will be rewarded 
at last  master luke s
come to rescue me 
master 
luke skywalker  jedi knight 
i told you not to admit him 
i must be allowed to speak 
he must be allowed to speak 
you weak minded fool 
he s using an old jedi mind trick 
you will bring captain solo
and the wookiee to me 
your mind powers
will not work on me  boy 
nevertheless   
i m taking captain solo
and his friends 
you can either profit by this
or be destroyed 
it s your choice  but i warn you
not to underestimate my powers 
master luke  you re standing on   
there will be no bargain  young jedi 
i shall enjoy watching you die 
oh  no  the rancor 
bring me solo and the wookiee 
they will all suffer for this outrage 
han 
  are you all right 
  fine  together again  huh 
  wouldn t miss it 
  how are we doin 
  same as always 
  that bad  huh 
  where s leia 
  i m here 
oh  dear 
his high exaltedness 
the great jabba the hutt   
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately 
good  i hate long waits 
you will therefore be taken
to the dune sea   
and cast into the pit of carkoon   
nesting place
of the all powerful sarlacc 
doesn t sound so bad 
in his belly  you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering   
as you are slowly digested
over 1 000 years 
on second thought 
let s pass on that 
you should have bargained  jabba 
that s the last mistake
you ll ever make 
i think my eyes are getting better 
instead of a big dark blur 
i see a big light blur 
there s nothing to see 
i used to live here  you know 
you re gonna die here 
you know  convenient 
just stick close to chewie and lando 
i ve taken care of everything 
great 
soon you will learn to appreciate me 
i m terribly sorry 
r2  what are you doing here 
i can see you re serving drinks 
but this place is dangerous 
they re going to execute master luke 
and if we re not careful  us too 
i wish i had your confidence 
victims of the almighty sarlacc   
his excellency hopes
that you will die honourably 
but should any of you
wish to beg for mercy   
the great jabba the hutt
will now listen to your pleas 
3po  you tell that slimy piece
of worm ridden filth   
he ll get no such pleasure from us 
right 
this is your last chance 
free us or die 
move him into position

i ll meet you back at the fleet 
hurry  the alliance
should be assembled by now 
  i will 
  luke  thanks 
thanks for coming after me 
now i owe you one 
that s right  r2 
we re going to the dagobah system 
i have a promise to keep   
to an old friend 
rise  my friend 
the death star will be
completed on schedule 
you ve done well  lord vader 
now i sense you wish to continue
your search for young skywalker 
yes  my master 
patience  my friend 
in time  he will seek you out 
when he does 
you must bring him before me 
he has grown strong 
only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the force 
as you wish 
everything is proceeding
as i have foreseen 
that face you make   
look i so old to young eyes 
no  of course not 
i do 
yes  i do 
sick have i become 
old and weak 
when 900 years old you reach   
look as good you will not 
soon will i rest 
yes  forever sleep 
earned it i have 
master yoda  you can t die 
strong am i with the force   
but not that strong 
twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall 
that is the way of things   
the way of the force 
but i need your help 
i ve come back
to complete the training 
no more training do you require 
already know you
that which you need 
then i am a jedi 
not yet 
one thing remains   
vader  you must confront vader 
then    only then   
a jedi will you be 
and confront him you will 
master yoda   
is darth vader my father 
rest i need 
yes 
rest 
yoda  i must know 
your father he is 
told you  did he 
yes 
unexpected this is 
and unfortunate 
unfortunate that i know the truth 
no 
unfortunate that
you rushed to face him   
that incomplete
was your training   
that not ready
for the burden were you 
i m sorry 
remember  a jedi s strength
flows from the force 
but beware 
anger  fear  aggression   
the dark side are they 
once you start down the dark path   
forever will it dominate your destiny 
do not   
do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor   
or suffer your father s fate you will 
when gone am i   
the last of the jedi will you be 
the force runs strong in your family 
pass on what you have learned 
there is   
another   
skywalker 
i can t do it  r2 
i can t go on alone 
yoda will always be with you 
obi wan 
why didn t you tell me 
you told me vader betrayed
and murdered my father 
your father was seduced
by the dark side of the force 
he ceased to be anakin skywalker
and became darth vader 
when that happened   
the good man who was
your father was destroyed 
so what i told you was true   
from a certain point of view 
a certain point of view 
luke  you re going to find
that many of the truths we cling to   
depend greatly
on our own point of view 
anakin was a good friend 
when i first knew him   
your father was already a great pilot   
but i was amazed how strongly
the force was with him 
i took it upon myself
to train him as a jedi 
i thought that i could instruct him
just as well as yoda 
i was wrong 
there is still good in him 
he s more machine now than man   
twisted and evil 
i can t do it  ben 
you cannot escape your destiny 
you must face darth vader again 
i can t kill my own father 
then the emperor has already won 
you were our only hope 
yoda spoke of another 
the other he spoke of
is your twin sister 
but i have no sister 
to protect you both
from the emperor   
you were hidden from your father
when you were born 
the emperor knew  as i did   
if anakin were to have any offspring   
they would be a threat to him 
that is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous 
  leia is my sister 
  your insight serves you well 
bury your feelings deep down  luke 
they do you credit   
but they could be made
to serve the emperor 
look at you  a general  huh 
someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the battle of tanaab 
don t look at me  pal 
i just said you were a fair pilot 
i didn t know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack 
i m surprised they didn t
ask you to do it 
who says they didn t 
but i ain t crazy 
you re the respectable one  remember 
the emperor s made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come 
the data brought to us by the bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location   
of the emperor s new battle station 
we also know
that the weapon systems   
of this death star
are not yet operational 
with the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy   
in a vain effort to engage us   
it is relatively unprotected 
but most important of all   
we ve learned that
the emperor himself   
is personally overseeing
the final stages   
of the construction
of this death star 
many bothans died
to bring us this information 
admiral ackbar  please 
you can see here the death star
orbiting the forest moon of endor 
although the weapon systems on this
death star are not yet operational   
the death star does have
a strong defence mechanism 
it is protected by an energy shield   
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of endor 
the shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted 
once the shield is down 
our cruisers will create a perimeter   
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure   
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor 
general calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack 
good luck 
you re gonna need it 
general madine 
we have stolen a small imperial shuttle 
disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code   
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator 
sounds dangerous 
wonder who they found
to pull that off 
general solo 
is your strike team assembled 
my team s ready  i don t have
a command crew for the shuttle 
it s gonna be rough 
i didn t wanna speak for you 
  that s one 
  general  count me in 
i m with you too 
  what is it 
  ask me again sometime 
hi  han  chewie 
 exciting  is hardly the word
i would choose 
look  i want you to take her 
i mean it  take her 
you need all the help you can get 
she s the fastest ship in the fleet 
all right  old buddy 
i know what she means to you 
i ll take good care of her 
she won t get a scratch 
all right 
right 
i got your promise 
not a scratch 
would you get going  you pirate 
good luck 
you too 
  got her warmed 
  yeah  she s coming up 
i don t think the empire had wookiees
in mind when they designed her  chewie 
hey  you awake 
yeah  i just got a funny feeling 
like i m not gonna see her again 
come on  general  let s move 
right  chewie  let s see
what this piece of junk can do 
  ready  everybody 
  all set 
here we go again 
all right  hang on 
what is thy bidding  my master 
send the fleet
to the far side of endor 
there it will stay until called for 
what of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near sullust 
it is of no concern 
soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young skywalker will be one of us 
your work here is finished  my friend 
go out to the command ship
and await my orders 
yes  my master 
if they don t go for this  we re gonna
have to get out pretty quick 
we have you on our screen now 
please identify 
shuttle tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield 
shuttle tydirium  transmit
the clearance code for shield passage 
transmission commencing 
now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid 
it ll work  it ll work 
vader s on that ship 
don t get jittery  luke 
there are a lot of command ships 
keep your distance  chewie  but don t
look like you re keeping your distance 
i don t know  fly casual 
where is that shuttle going 
shuttle tydirium 
what is your cargo and destination 
parts and technical crew
for the forest moon 
do they have a code clearance 
it s an older code  sir 
but it checks out 
i was about to clear them 
i m endangering the mission 
i shouldn t have come 
it s your imagination  kid 
come on  let s keep
a little optimism here 
shall i hold them 
no  leave them to me 
i will deal with them myself 
as you wish  my lord  carry on 
they re not going for it  chewie 
shuttle tydirium   
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately 
follow your present course 
okay  i told you
it was gonna work 
no problem 
i told you it was dangerous here 
  should we try and go around 
  it ll take time 
this whole party will be
for nothing if they see us 
chewie and i will take care of this 
you stay here 
quietly  there might be
more of them out there 
hey   
it s me 
go for help  go 
great  come on 
over there  two more of them 
i see them  wait  leia 
hey  wait 
quick  jam their comlink

keep on that one 
i ll take these two 
general solo  somebody s coming

  i thought she was with you 
we got separated 
we better go look for her 
take the squad ahead  we ll meet
at the shield generator at 0300 
come on  r2 
we ll need your scanners 
don t worry  master luke 
we know what to do 
and you said it was pretty here 
cut it out 
i m not gonna hurt you

trouble is  i don t know where here is 
maybe you can help me 
come on  sit down 
i promise i won t hurt you 
now come here

that s right 
come on 
look  it s a hat

aren t you 
what is it 
freeze 
come on  get up 
  get your ride  take her back to base 
  yes  sir 
what the   
come on 
let s get out of here 
i told you to remain
on the command ship 
a small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on endor 
yes  i know 
my son is with them 
  are you sure 
  i have felt him  my master 
strange that i have not 
i wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear  lord vader 
they are clear  my master 
then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him 
he will come to me 
i have foreseen it 
his compassion for you
will be his undoing 
he will come to you 
and then you will bring him before me 
as you wish 
master luke 
there s two more
wrecked speeders back there 
and i found this 
i m afraid that r2 s sensors
can find no trace of princess leia 
i hope she s all right 
what  chewie 
what  chewie 
i don t get it 
it s just a dead animal 
chewie  wait  don t 
nice work 
great  chewie 
great  always thinking
with your stomach 
take it easy  let s just figure
a way to get out of this thing 
han  can you reach my lightsabre 
yeah  sure 
r2  i m not sure
that s such a good idea 
it s a very long drop 
hey  point that thing
someplace else 
hey 
han  don t  it ll be all right 
chewie  give them your crossbow 
oh  my head 
oh  my goodness 
do you understand
anything they re saying 
oh  yes  master luke 
remember that i am fluent
in over six million forms   
what are you telling them 
 hello   i think 
i could be mistaken   
they re using a very primitive dialect   
but i do believe they think
i am some sort of god 
why don t you use your divine
influence and get us out of this 
i beg your pardon  general solo 
but that just wouldn t be proper 
proper 
it s against my programming
to impersonate a deity 
why  you   
my mistake 
he s an old friend of mine 
hey 
i have a really bad feeling about this 
what did he say 
i m rather embarrassed 
general solo   
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour 
your royal highness 
these are my friends 
3po  tell them
they must be set free 
somehow i got the feeling
that didn t help us very much 
3po  tell them
if they don t do as you wish   
you ll become angry
and use your magic 
but  master luke  what magic 
i couldn t possibly   
tell them 
you see  master luke 
they didn t believe me   
just as i said they wouldn t 
wait 
what s happening 
put me down 
help 
somebody 
somebody help 
master luke  r2  quickly

  what s going on 
  i don t know 
wonderful  we are now
a part of the tribe 
just what i always wanted 
short help s better than
no help at all  chewie 
the scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator 
good  how far is it 
ask him 
we need some fresh supplies too 
try and get our weapons back 
hurry up 
i haven t got all day 
luke  what s wrong 
leia  do you remember

she died when i was very young 
what do you remember 
just images really  feelings 
tell me 
she was    very beautiful 
kind    but sad 
why are you asking me this 
i have no memory of my mother 
i never knew her 
luke  tell me 
what s troubling you 
vader is here 
now  on this moon 
how do you know 
i felt his presence 
he s come for me 
he can feel when i m near 
that s why i have to go 
as long as i stay  i m endangering
the group and our mission here 
  i have to face him 
  why 
he s my father 
your father 
there s more  it won t be easy
for you to hear it  but you must 
if i don t make it back 
you re the only hope for the alliance 
don t talk that way 
you have a power i don t understand
and could never have 
you re wrong  leia 
you have that power too 
in time  you ll learn
to use it as i have 
the force is strong in my family 
my father has it 
i have it 
and   
my sister has it 
yes  it s you  leia 
i know 
somehow   
i ve always known 
then you know
why i have to face him 
luke  run away 
far away 
if he can feel your presence 
then leave this place 
  i wish i could go with you 
  no  you don t 
you ve always been strong 
but why must you confront him 
because there is good in him 
i ve felt it 
he won t turn me over
to the emperor 
i can save him  i can turn him
back to the good side 
i have to try 
hey  what s going on 
nothing  i just wanna
be alone for a little while 
nothing 
tell me 
what s going on 
i can t tell you 
could you tell luke 
is that who you could tell 
i m sorry 
hold me 
this is the rebel that surrendered 
although he denies it 
i believe there may be more of them   
and i request permission
to conduct a further search of the area 
he was armed only with this 
good work  commander 
leave us 
conduct your search
and bring his companions to me 
yes  my lord 
the emperor has been expecting you 
i know  father 
so  you have accepted the truth 
i ve accepted the truth that you were
once anakin skywalker  my father 
that name no longer
has any meaning for me 
it is the name of your true self 
you ve only forgotten 
i know there is good in you 
the emperor hasn t
driven it from you fully 
that was why
you couldn t destroy me 
that s why you won t bring me
to your emperor now 
i see you have constructed
a new lightsabre 
your skills are complete 
indeed you are powerful 
as the emperor has foreseen 
come with me 
obi wan once thought as you do 
you don t know the power
of the dark side 
i must obey my master 
i will not turn 
and you ll be forced to kill me 
if that is your destiny 
search your feelings  father 
you can t do this 
i feel the conflict within you 
let go of your hate 
it is too late for me  son 
the emperor will show you
the true nature of the force 
he is your master now 
then my father is truly dead 
the main entrance
to the control bunker   
is on the far side
of that landing platform 
  this isn t gonna be easy 
  don t worry 
chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this 
what s he saying 
he says there s a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge 
admiral  we re in position 
all fighters accounted for 
proceed with the countdown 
all groups assume attack coordinates 
don t worry 
my friend s down there 
he ll have that shield down on time 
or this ll be
the shortest offensive of all time 
all craft  prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark 
all right  stand by 
back door  huh  good idea 
it s only a few guards 
this shouldn t be too much trouble 
it only takes one to sound the alarm 
then we ll do it real quiet like 
  oh  my  princess leia 
  quiet 
i m afraid our furry companion   
has gone and done something
rather rash 
there goes our surprise attack 
look  over there  stop him 
not bad for a little furball 
there s only one left 
you stay here 
we ll take care of this 
i have decided that we shall stay here 
hey 
welcome  young skywalker 
i have been expecting you 
you ll no longer need those 
guards  leave us 
i m looking forward
to completing your training 
in time  you will call me master 
you re gravely mistaken 
you won t convert me
as you did my father 
oh  no  my young jedi 
you will find that
it is you who are mistaken   
about a great many things 
his lightsabre 
ah  yes  a jedi s weapon 
much like your father s 
by now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side 
so will it be with you 
you re wrong 
soon i ll be dead   
and you with me 
perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet 
yes 
i assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here 
your overconfidence
is your weakness 
your faith in your friends is yours 
it is pointless to resist  my son 
everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design 
your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon   
are walking into a trap 
as is your rebel fleet 
it was i who allowed the alliance   
to know the location
of the shield generator 
it is quite safe
from your pitiful little band 
an entire legion
of my best troops awaits them 
i m afraid the deflector shield   
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive 
all right 
up  move 
quickly  quickly 
han  hurry 
the fleet will be here any moment 
charges  come on  come on 
oh  my  they ll be captured 
wait  come back 
r2  stay with me 
freeze 
you rebel scum 
  all wings report in 
  red leader standing by 
  grey leader standing by 
  green leader standing by 
lock s foils in attack positions 
may the force be with us 
we ve gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield    up or down 
how could they be jamming us
if they don t know   
if we re coming 
break off the attack 
the shield is still up 
i get no reading  you sure 
pull up  all craft pull up 
take evasive action  green group 
stick close to holding sector mv 7 
admiral  we have
enemy ships in sector 47 
it s a trap 
fighters coming in 
there s too many 
accelerate to attack speed 
draw their fire away from the cruisers 
copy  gold leader 
come  boy 
see for yourself 
from here  you will witness
the final destruction of the alliance   
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion 
you want this   
don t you 
the hate is swelling in you now 
take your jedi weapon 
use it 
i am unarmed 
strike me down with it 
give in to your anger 
with each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant 
it is unavoidable 
it is your destiny 
you  like your father   
are now   
mine 
all right  move it 
hello  i say  over there 
were you looking for me 
bring those two down here 
they re on their way 
r2  are you sure this was a good idea 
freeze 
don t move 
we surrender 
the code s changed 
  we need r2 
  here s the terminal 
r2  where are you 
we need you at the bunker
right away 
going  what do you mean 
going where  r2 
wait  r2  this is
no time for heroics 
come back 
watch yourself  wedge 
three from above 
  red three  red two  pull in 
  got it 
three of them coming in  20 degrees 
cut left 
i ll take the leader 
they re heading
for the medical frigate 
pressure s steady 
only the fighters are attacking 
what are the stardestroyers waiting for 
we re in attack position  sir 
  hold here 
  we re not going to attack 
my orders are from the emperor himself 
he has something special planned 
we only need to
keep them from escaping 
as you can see 
my young apprentice   
your friends have failed 
now witness the firepower   
of this fully armed
and operational battle station 
fire at will  commander 
fire 
that blast came from the death star 
that thing s operational 
home 1  this is gold leader 
we saw it 
all craft prepare to retreat 
you won t get
another chance at this  admiral 
we have no choice  general calrissian 
our cruisers can t repel
firepower of that magnitude 
han will have that shield down 
we ve gotta give him more time 
we re coming 
come on 
r2  hurry 
my goodness 
why did you have to be so brave 
well  i suppose i could
hot wire this thing 
i ll cover you 
yes  i said closer 
move as close as you can   
and engage those stardestroyers
at point blank range 
at that close range  we won t last long
against those stardestroyers 
we ll last longer than we will
against that death star   
and we might
take a few of them with us 
she s gonna blow 
i m hit 
your fleet is lost   
and your friends on the endor moon
will not survive 
there is no escape   
my young apprentice 
the alliance will die   
as will your friends 
good 
i can feel your anger 
i am defenceless 
take your weapon 
strike me down
with all of your hatred   
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete 
  look 
  get him off of there 
i think i got it 
i got it 
are you all right 
  let s see 
  it s not bad 
  freeze 
  oh  dear 
don t move 
  i love you 
  i know 
hands up 
stand up 
stay back 
get down here 
she s wounded 
no  wait 
i got an idea 
good 
use your aggressive feelings  boy 
let the hate flow through you 
obi wan has taught you well 
i will not fight you  father 
you are unwise
to lower your defences 
your thoughts betray you  father 
i feel the good in you  the conflict 
there is no conflict 
you couldn t bring yourself
to kill me before   
and i don t believe
you ll destroy me now 
you underestimate
the power of the dark side 
if you will not fight   
then you will meet your destiny 
good 
good 
  watch out  squad at 06 
  i m on it  gold leader 
good shot  red two 
we re sure in the middle of it now 
come on  han  old buddy 
don t let me down 
it s over  commander 
the rebels have been routed 
they re fleeing 
we need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit 
send three squads to help 
  open the back door 
  sir 
throw me another charge 
you cannot hide forever  luke 
i will not fight you 
give yourself to the dark side 
it is the only way
you can save your friends 
yes 
your thoughts betray you 
your feelings for them are strong   
especially for   
sister 
so you have a twin sister 
your feelings have now
betrayed her too 
obi wan was wise
to hide her from me 
now his failure is complete 
if you will not turn
to the dark side   
then perhaps she will 
never 
good 
your hate has made you powerful 
now  fulfil your destiny   
and take your father s place at my side 
never 
i ll never turn to the dark side 
you ve failed  your highness 
i am a jedi   
like my father before me 
so be it  jedi 
move  move 
the shield is down  commence attack
on the death star s main reactor 
we re on our way  red group 
gold group  all fighters follow me 
i told you they d do it 
if you will not be turned   
you will be destroyed 
young fool 
only now  at the end   
do you understand 
your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side 
you have paid the price
for your lack of vision 
father  please 
now  young skywalker   
you will die 
i m going in 
here goes nothing 
lock onto the strongest power source 
it should be the power generator 
form up  stay alert 
we could run out of space real fast 
split up and head back to the surface 
see if you can get a few
of those tie fighters to follow you 
copy  gold leader 
that was too close 
we ve got to give
those fighters more time 
concentrate all fire
on that super stardestroyer 
sir  we ve lost our
bridge deflector shields 
intensify the forward batteries 
i don t want anything to get through 
intensify forward firepower 
too late 
help me take this mask off 
but you ll die 
nothing can stop that now 
just for once   
let me   
look on you with my own eyes 
now go  my son 
leave me 
no  you re coming with me 
i ll not leave you here 
i ve got to save you 
you already have  luke 
you were right 
you were right about me 
tell your sister   
you were right 
father 
i won t leave you 
there it is 
wedge  go for the power regulator
on the north tower 
copy  gold leader 
i m already on my way out 
move the fleet
away from the death star 
they did it 
i m sure luke wasn t
on that thing when it blew 
he wasn t 
i can feel it 
you love him 
don t you 
yes 
all right  i understand 
fine
