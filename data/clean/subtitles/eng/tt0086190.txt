deactivate the security shield
the security deflector shield
will be deactivated
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission
stand by
you are clear to proceed
were starting our approach
inform the commander
that lord vaders shuttle has arrived
sir
lord vader this is an unexpected
pleasure were honoured
you may dispense
with the pleasantries commander
im here to put you back on schedule
i assure you lord vader
my men are working as fast as they can
perhaps i can find
new ways to motivate them
i tell you this station
will be operational as planned
the emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation
but he asks the impossible
i need more men
then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives
the emperors coming here
that is correct commander
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress
we shall double our efforts
i hope so commander for your sake
the emperor is not
as forgiving as i am
of course im worried
and you should be too
lando calrissian and poor chewbacca
never returned from this awful place
dont be so sure
if i told you half the things
ive heard about this jabba the hutt
youd probably shortcircuit
r2 are you sure
this is the right place
id better knock i suppose
there doesnt seem to be anyone here
lets go back and tell master luke
goodness gracious me
i dont think
theyre going to let us in r2
wed better go
r2 wait
oh dear r2
r2 i really dont think
we should rush into all this
oh r2
r2 wait for me
just you deliver master lukes message
and get us out of here
oh my
oh no
oh my
we bring a message
to your master jabba the hutt
and a gift
what gift
he says that our instructions
are to give it only to jabba himself
im terribly sorry im afraid hes ever
so stubborn about these sort of things
r2 i have a bad feeling about this
good morning
the message r2
the message
greetings exalted one
allow me to introduce myself
i am luke skywalker
jedi knight and friend to captain solo
i know that you are powerful
mighty jabba
and that your anger with solo
must be equally powerful
i seek an audience with your greatness
to bargain for solos life
with your wisdom im sure
we can work out an arrangement
which will be mutually beneficial
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation
as a token of my goodwill
i present to you a gift
these two droids
what did he say
both are hardworking
and will serve you well
this cant be
r2 youre playing the wrong message
hes no jedi
there will be no bargain
were doomed
i will not give up
my favourite decoration
i like captain solo where he is
r2 look captain solo
and hes still frozen in carbonite
what could possibly
have come over master luke
was it something i did he never
expressed any unhappiness with my work
how horrid
good new acquisitions
you are a protocol droid
are you not
i am c3po
yes or no will do
well yes
how many languages do you speak
i am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily
splendid we have been
without an interpreter
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid
and disintegrated him
disintegrated
guard this protocol droid
might be useful
fit him with a restraining bolt
and take him back up to
his excellencys main audience chamber
r2 dont leave me
youre a feisty little one
but youll soon learn some respect
i have need for you on
the masters sail barge
and i think youll fill in nicely
ah do that again
i have come for the bounty
on this wookiee
oh no chewbacca
at last we have the mighty chewbacca
yes i am here
your worshipfulness
yes
the illustrious jabba
bids you welcome
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25000
i want 50000 no less
50000 no less
what did i say
the mighty jabba asks why
he must pay 50000
because hes holding
a thermal detonator
this bounty hunter
is my kind of scum
fearless and inventive
jabba offers the sum of 35
and i do suggest you take it
he agrees
just relax for a moment
youre free of the carbonite
you have hibernation sickness
i cant see
your eyesight will return in time
where am i
jabbas palace
who are you
someone who loves you
leia
i gotta get you out of here
whats that
i know that laugh
hey jabba
look jabba i was just
on my way to pay you back
i got a little sidetracked
its not my fault
its too late for that solo
you may have been a good smuggler
but now youre bantha fodder
look

jabba ill pay you triple
youre throwing away a fortune here

youre gonna regret this
im sure
i cant bear to watch
chewie
chewie is that you

whats going on
luke lukes crazy
he cant even take care of himself
much less rescue anybody
a jedi knight

you serve your master well
and you will be rewarded
at last master lukes

master
luke skywalker jedi knight
i told you not to admit him
i must be allowed to speak
he must be allowed to speak
you weakminded fool
hes using an old jedi mind trick
you will bring captain solo
and the wookiee to me
your mind powers
will not work on me boy
nevertheless
im taking captain solo
and his friends
you can either profit by this
or be destroyed
its your choice but i warn you
not to underestimate my powers
master luke youre standing on
there will be no bargain young jedi
i shall enjoy watching you die
oh no the rancor
bring me solo and the wookiee
they will all suffer for this outrage
han
are you all right
fine together again huh
wouldnt miss it
how are we doin
same as always
that bad huh
wheres leia
im here
oh dear
his high exaltedness
the great jabba the hutt
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately
good i hate long waits
you will therefore be taken
to the dune sea
and cast into the pit of carkoon
nesting place
of the allpowerful sarlacc
doesnt sound so bad
in his belly you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering
as you are slowly digested
over 1000 years
on second thought
lets pass on that
you should have bargained jabba
thats the last mistake
youll ever make
i think my eyes are getting better
instead of a big dark blur
i see a big light blur
theres nothing to see
i used to live here you know
youre gonna die here
you know convenient
just stick close to chewie and lando
ive taken care of everything
great
soon you will learn to appreciate me
im terribly sorry
r2 what are you doing here
i can see youre serving drinks
but this place is dangerous
theyre going to execute master luke
and if were not careful us too
i wish i had your confidence
victims of the almighty sarlacc
his excellency hopes
that you will die honourably
but should any of you
wish to beg for mercy
the great jabba the hutt
will now listen to your pleas
3po you tell that slimy piece
of wormridden filth
hell get no such pleasure from us

ill meet you back at the fleet
hurry the alliance
should be assembled by now
i will
luke thanks
thanks for coming after me
now i owe you one
thats right r2
were going to the dagobah system
i have a promise to keep
to an old friend
rise my friend
the death star will be
completed on schedule
youve done well lord vader
now i sense you wish to continue
your search for young skywalker
yes my master
patience my friend
in time he will seek you out
when he does
you must bring him before me
he has grown strong
only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the force
as you wish
everything is proceeding
as i have foreseen
that face you make
look i so old to young eyes
no of course not
i do
yes i do
sick have i become
old and weak
when 900 years old you reach
look as good you will not
soon will i rest
yes forever sleep
earned it i have
master yoda you cant die
strong am i with the force
but not that strong
twilight is upon me
and soon night must fall
that is the way of things
the way of the force
but i need your help
ive come back
to complete the training
no more training do you require
already know you
that which you need
then i am a jedi
not yet
one thing remains
vader you must confront vader
then only then
a jedi will you be
and confront him you will
master yoda
is darth vader my father
rest i need
yes
rest
yoda i must know
your father he is
told you did he
yes
unexpected this is
and unfortunate
unfortunate that i know the truth
no
unfortunate that
you rushed to face him
that incomplete
was your training
that not ready
for the burden were you
im sorry
remember a jedis strength
flows from the force
but beware
anger fear aggression
the dark side are they
once you start down the dark path
forever will it dominate your destiny
do not
do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor
or suffer your fathers fate you will
when gone am i
the last of the jedi will you be
the force runs strong in your family
pass on what you have learned
there is
another
skywalker
i cant do it r2
i cant go on alone
yoda will always be with you
obiwan
why didnt you tell me
you told me vader betrayed
and murdered my father
your father was seduced
by the dark side of the force
he ceased to be anakin skywalker
and became darth vader
when that happened
the good man who was
your father was destroyed
so what i told you was true
from a certain point of view
a certain point of view
luke youre going to find
that many of the truths we cling to
depend greatly
on our own point of view
anakin was a good friend
when i first knew him
your father was already a great pilot
but i was amazed how strongly
the force was with him
i took it upon myself
to train him as a jedi
i thought that i could instruct him
just as well as yoda
i was wrong
there is still good in him
hes more machine now than man
twisted and evil
i cant do it ben
you cannot escape your destiny
you must face darth vader again
i cant kill my own father
then the emperor has already won
you were our only hope
yoda spoke of another
the other he spoke of
is your twin sister
but i have no sister
to protect you both
from the emperor
you were hidden from your father
when you were born
the emperor knew as i did
if anakin were to have any offspring
they would be a threat to him
that is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous
leia is my sister
your insight serves you well
bury your feelings deep down luke
they do you credit
but they could be made
to serve the emperor
look at you a general huh
someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the battle of tanaab
dont look at me pal
i just said you were a fair pilot
i didnt know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack
im surprised they didnt
ask you to do it
who says they didnt
but i aint crazy
youre the respectable one remember
the emperors made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come
the data brought to us by the bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location
of the emperors new battle station
we also know
that the weapon systems
of this death star
are not yet operational
with the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy
in a vain effort to engage us
it is relatively unprotected
but most important of all
weve learned that
the emperor himself
is personally overseeing
the final stages
of the construction
of this death star
many bothans died
to bring us this information
admiral ackbar please
you can see here the death star
orbiting the forest moon of endor
although the weapon systems on this
death star are not yet operational
the death star does have
a strong defence mechanism
it is protected by an energy shield
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of endor
the shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted
once the shield is down
our cruisers will create a perimeter
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor
general calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack
good luck
youre gonna need it
general madine
we have stolen a small imperial shuttle
disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator
sounds dangerous
wonder who they found
to pull that off
general solo
is your strike team assembled
my teams ready i dont have
a command crew for the shuttle
its gonna be rough
i didnt wanna speak for you
thats one
general count me in
im with you too
what is it
ask me again sometime
hi han chewie
exciting is hardly the word
i would choose
look i want you to take her
i mean it take her
you need all the help you can get
shes the fastest ship in the fleet
all right old buddy
i know what she means to you
ill take good care of her
she wont get a scratch
all right
right
i got your promise
not a scratch
would you get going you pirate
good luck
you too
got her warmed
yeah shes coming up
i dont think the empire had wookiees
in mind when they designed her chewie
hey you awake
yeah i just got a funny feeling
like im not gonna see her again
come on general lets move
right chewie lets see
what this piece of junk can do
ready everybody
all set
here we go again
all right hang on
what is thy bidding my master
send the fleet
to the far side of endor
there it will stay until called for
what of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near sullust
it is of no concern
soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young skywalker will be one of us
your work here is finished my friend
go out to the command ship
and await my orders
yes my master
if they dont go for this were gonna
have to get out pretty quick
we have you on our screen now
please identify
shuttle tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield
shuttle tydirium transmit
the clearance code for shield passage
transmission commencing
now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid
itll work itll work
vaders on that ship
dont get jittery luke
there are a lot of command ships
keep your distance chewie but dont
look like youre keeping your distance
i dont know fly casual
where is that shuttle going
shuttle tydirium
what is your cargo and destination
parts and technical crew
for the forest moon
do they have a code clearance
its an older code sir
but it checks out
i was about to clear them
im endangering the mission
i shouldnt have come
its your imagination kid
come on lets keep
a little optimism here
shall i hold them
no leave them to me
i will deal with them myself
as you wish my lord carry on
theyre not going for it chewie
shuttle tydirium
deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately
follow your present course
okay i told you
it was gonna work
no problem
i told you it was dangerous here
should we try and go around
itll take time
this whole party will be
for nothing if they see us
chewie and i will take care of this
you stay here
quietly there might be
more of them out there
hey
its me
go for help go

i told you to remain
on the command ship
a small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on endor
yes i know
my son is with them
are you sure
i have felt him my master
strange that i have not
i wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear lord vader
they are clear my master
then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him
he will come to me
i have foreseen it
his compassion for you
will be his undoing
he will come to you
and then you will bring him before me
as you wish
master luke
theres two more
wrecked speeders back there
and i found this
im afraid that r2s sensors
can find no trace of princess leia
i hope shes all right

chewie wait dont
nice work

with your stomach
take it easy lets just figure
a way to get out of this thing
han can you reach my lightsabre

thats such a good idea
its a very long drop
hey point that thing
someplace else
hey
han dont itll be all right
chewie give them your crossbow
oh my head
oh my goodness
do you understand
anything theyre saying
oh yes master luke
remember that i am fluent
in over six million forms
what are you telling them
hello i think
i could be mistaken
theyre using a very primitive dialect
but i do believe they think
i am some sort of god
why dont you use your divine
influence and get us out of this
i beg your pardon general solo
but that just wouldnt be proper
proper
its against my programming
to impersonate a deity
why you
my mistake
hes an old friend of mine
hey
i have a really bad feeling about this
what did he say
im rather embarrassed
general solo
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour
your royal highness
these are my friends
3po tell them
they must be set free
somehow i got the feeling
that didnt help us very much
3po tell them
if they dont do as you wish
youll become angry
and use your magic
but master luke what magic
i couldnt possibly
tell them
you see master luke
they didnt believe me
just as i said they wouldnt
wait
whats happening
put me down
help
somebody
somebody help
master luke r2 quickly

carbon
sarlacc
whats going on
i dont know

i havent got all day
luke whats wrong
leia do you remember
your mother
your real mother

she was very beautiful
kind but sad
why are you asking me this
i have no memory of my mother
i never knew her
luke tell me
whats troubling you
vader is here
now on this moon
how do you know
i felt his presence
hes come for me
he can feel when im near
thats why i have to go
as long as i stay im endangering
the group and our mission here
i have to face him
why
hes my father
your father
theres more it wont be easy
for you to hear it but you must
if i dont make it back
youre the only hope for the alliance
dont talk that way
you have a power i dont understand
and could never have
youre wrong leia
you have that power too
in time youll learn
to use it as i have
the force is strong in my family
my father has it
i have it
and
my sister has it
yes its you leia
i know
somehow
ive always known
then you know
why i have to face him
luke run away
far away
if he can feel your presence
then leave this place
i wish i could go with you
no you dont
youve always been strong
but why must you confront him
because there is good in him
ive felt it
he wont turn me over
to the emperor
i can save him i can turn him
back to the good side
i have to try
hey whats going on
nothing i just wanna
be alone for a little while
nothing
tell me
whats going on
i cant tell you
could you tell luke
is that who you could tell
im sorry
hold me
this is the rebel that surrendered
although he denies it
i believe there may be more of them
and i request permission
to conduct a further search of the area
he was armed only with this
good work commander
leave us
conduct your search
and bring his companions to me
yes my lord
the emperor has been expecting you
i know father
so you have accepted the truth
ive accepted the truth that you were
once anakin skywalker my father
that name no longer
has any meaning for me
it is the name of your true self
youve only forgotten
i know there is good in you
the emperor hasnt
driven it from you fully
that was why
you couldnt destroy me
thats why you wont bring me
to your emperor now
i see you have constructed
a new lightsabre
your skills are complete
indeed you are powerful
as the emperor has foreseen
come with me
obiwan once thought as you do
you dont know the power
of the dark side
i must obey my master
i will not turn
and youll be forced to kill me
if that is your destiny
search your feelings father
you cant do this
i feel the conflict within you
let go of your hate
it is too late for me son
the emperor will show you
the true nature of the force
he is your master now
then my father is truly dead
the main entrance
to the control bunker
is on the far side
of that landing platform
this isnt gonna be easy
dont worry
chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this
whats he saying
he says theres a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge
admiral were in position
all fighters accounted for
proceed with the countdown
all groups assume attack coordinates
dont worry
my friends down there
hell have that shield down on time
or thisll be
the shortest offensive of all time
all craft prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark
all right stand by
back door huh good idea
its only a few guards
this shouldnt be too much trouble
it only takes one to sound the alarm
then well do it real quietlike
oh my princess leia
quiet
im afraid our furry companion
has gone and done something
rather rash
there goes our surprise attack
look over there stop him
not bad for a little furball
theres only one left
you stay here
well take care of this
i have decided that we shall stay here
hey
welcome young skywalker
i have been expecting you
youll no longer need those
guards leave us
im looking forward
to completing your training
in time you will call me master
youre gravely mistaken
you wont convert me
as you did my father
oh no my young jedi
you will find that
it is you who are mistaken
about a great many things
his lightsabre
ah yes a jedis weapon
much like your fathers
by now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side
so will it be with you
youre wrong
soon ill be dead
and you with me
perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet
yes
i assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here
your overconfidence
is your weakness
your faith in your friends is yours
it is pointless to resist my son
everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design
your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon
are walking into a trap
as is your rebel fleet
it was i who allowed the alliance
to know the location
of the shield generator
it is quite safe
from your pitiful little band
an entire legion
of my best troops awaits them
im afraid the deflector shield
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive
all right
up move
quickly quickly
han hurry
the fleet will be here any moment
charges come on come on
oh my theyll be captured
wait come back
r2 stay with me
freeze
you rebel scum
all wings report in
red leader standing by
grey leader standing by
green leader standing by
lock sfoils in attack positions
may the force be with us
weve gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield up or down
how could they be jamming us
if they dont know
if were coming
break off the attack
the shield is still up
i get no reading you sure
pull up all craft pull up
take evasive action green group
stick close to holding sector mv7
admiral we have
enemy ships in sector 47
its a trap
fighters coming in
theres too many
accelerate to attack speed
draw their fire away from the cruisers
copy gold leader
come boy
see for yourself
from here you will witness
the final destruction of the alliance
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion
you want this
dont you
the hate is swelling in you now
take your jedi weapon
use it
i am unarmed
strike me down with it
give in to your anger
with each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant
it is unavoidable
it is your destiny
you like your father
are now
mine
all right move it
hello i say over there
were you looking for me
bring those two down here
theyre on their way
r2 are you sure this was a good idea
freeze
dont move
we surrender
the codes changed
we need r2
heres the terminal
r2 where are you
we need you at the bunker
right away
going what do you mean
going where r2
wait r2 this is
no time for heroics
come back
watch yourself wedge
three from above
red three red two pull in
got it
three of them coming in 20 degrees
cut left
ill take the leader
theyre heading
for the medical frigate
pressures steady
only the fighters are attacking
what are the stardestroyers waiting for
were in attack position sir
hold here
were not going to attack
my orders are from the emperor himself
he has something special planned
we only need to
keep them from escaping
as you can see
my young apprentice
your friends have failed
now witness the firepower
of this fully armed
and operational battle station
fire at will commander
fire
that blast came from the death star
that things operational
home 1 this is gold leader
we saw it
all craft prepare to retreat
you wont get
another chance at this admiral
we have no choice general calrissian
our cruisers cant repel
firepower of that magnitude
han will have that shield down
weve gotta give him more time
were coming
come on
r2 hurry
my goodness
why did you have to be so brave
well i suppose i could
hotwire this thing
ill cover you
yes i said closer
move as close as you can
and engage those stardestroyers
at pointblank range
at that close range we wont last long
against those stardestroyers
well last longer than we will
against that death star
and we might
take a few of them with us
shes gonna blow
im hit
your fleet is lost
and your friends on the endor moon
will not survive
there is no escape
my young apprentice
the alliance will die
as will your friends
good
i can feel your anger
i am defenceless
take your weapon
strike me down
with all of your hatred
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete
look
get him off of there
i think i got it
i got it
are you all right
lets see
its not bad
freeze
oh dear
dont move
i love you
i know
hands up
stand up
stay back
get down here
shes wounded
no wait
i got an idea
good
use your aggressive feelings boy
let the hate flow through you
obiwan has taught you well
i will not fight you father
you are unwise
to lower your defences
your thoughts betray you father
i feel the good in you the conflict
there is no conflict
you couldnt bring yourself
to kill me before
and i dont believe
youll destroy me now
you underestimate
the power of the dark side
if you will not fight
then you will meet your destiny
good
good
watch out squad at06
im on it gold leader
good shot red two
were sure in the middle of it now
come on han old buddy
dont let me down
its over commander
the rebels have been routed
theyre fleeing
we need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit
send three squads to help
open the back door
sir
throw me another charge
you cannot hide forever luke
i will not fight you
give yourself to the dark side
it is the only way
you can save your friends
yes
your thoughts betray you
your feelings for them are strong
especially for
sister
so you have a twin sister
your feelings have now
betrayed her too
obiwan was wise
to hide her from me
now his failure is complete
if you will not turn
to the dark side
then perhaps she will
never
good
your hate has made you powerful
now fulfil your destiny
and take your fathers place at my side
never
ill never turn to the dark side
youve failed your highness
i am a jedi
like my father before me
so be it jedi
move move
the shield is down commence attack
on the death stars main reactor
were on our way red group
gold group all fighters follow me
i told you theyd do it
if you will not be turned
you will be destroyed
young fool
only now at the end
do you understand
your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side
you have paid the price
for your lack of vision
father please
now young skywalker
you will die
im going in
here goes nothing
lock onto the strongest power source
it should be the power generator
form up stay alert
we could run out of space real fast
split up and head back to the surface
see if you can get a few
of those tie fighters to follow you
copy gold leader
that was too close
weve got to give
those fighters more time
concentrate all fire
on that super stardestroyer
sir weve lost our
bridge deflector shields
intensify the forward batteries
i dont want anything to get through
intensify forward firepower
too late
help me take this mask off
but youll die
nothing can stop that now
just for once
let me
look on you with my own eyes
now go my son

no youre coming with me
ill not leave you here
ive got to save you
you already have luke
you were right
you were right about me
tell your sister

wedge go for the power regulator
on the north tower
copy gold leader
