are being embezzled by you
stashing them in swiss bank
account number 32254766
to be precise
thats me your turn
im all ears
good day
door opens
imbeciles

the whole thing
time for my nineminute power nap
who was the woman
not really the point of the story
the storys about how lucky i am
but anyway she had a kid
kids a snowflake
special blahblahblah
it was a basic shakedown
situation actually
maybe she
maybe she just really loved her kid
maybe she only had one person
to take care of

ive discovered she likes to throw women
who offend her sensibilities
out of her parties
old women women in gold
ow
sad women
woman gasps
women who carry poodles

estella willed her fortune
to her dear friend
cruella de vil
cant you idiots see
that estella person its a trick

you wait ill get even
cruella the good thing
about evil people is
you can always trust them
to do something well
evil
estella would die like her mother did
but not quite
a wellcut skirt is a lifesaver girls
remember that
shed go to prison
for throwing someone off a cliff
wrong someone but theres something about
poetic justice thats just so
poetic
goodbye estella
she was with her mother now
ill take it from here
but cruella was alive
all right we should put on
some music or something
lighten the mood
sniffles
shes not actually dead mate shes
sighs
how can you not get choked up at all this
oh man
cruella and i call that a happy ending
rock music playing
horace gasps

so what now
ive got a few ideas
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
shes born to be bad
so run for the hills
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
the fear on your face
it gives me a thrill
who wants to be nice
who wants to be tame
all of you good guys
yall seem the same
original criminal
dressed to kill
just call me cruella de vil
call me crazy call me insane
but youre stuck in the past
and im ahead of the game
a life lived in penance
it just seems a waste
and the devil has much better taste
and i tried to be sweet
i tried to be kind
but i feel much better now that im
out of my mind
oh there always line in the gates of hell
but i go right to the front gate
cause i dress this well
rip it up leave it all in tatters
beauty is the only thing that matters
the fabric of your little world is torn
embrace the darkness
be really blind
cruella de vil
the fear on your face
it gives me a thrill
humming
doorbell ringing
whining
roger hello pongo
roger singing
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
if she doesnt scare you
no evil thing will
to see her is to take a certain chill
