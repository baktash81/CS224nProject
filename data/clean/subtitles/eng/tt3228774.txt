   woman groaning 
   baby crying 
cruella  oh  no 
we re starting here  okay 
from the very beginning
i ve always made a statement 
not everyone appreciated that 
that s unfortunate 
cruella  but i wasn t for everyone 
speaking of statements  here s one 
that necklace is the reason i m dead 
but i m getting ahead of myself 
from an early age 
i realized i saw the world
differently than everyone else 
look 
well  that s not the pattern 
you have to follow the pattern 
there s a way of doing things 
  that s ugly 
  cruella  including my mother 
that s cruel 
your name s estella  not cruella 
 gasps 
cruella  it wasn t her i was challenging 
it was the world 
but of course my mother knew that 
that s what worried her 
remember  you belong here
as much as anyone 
they re lucky to have you 
agreed 
hey  what do you say to cruella
when she tries to get the better of you 
thank you for coming  but you may go now 
good  now say goodbye to her 
goodbye  cruella 
and wear the hat 
i don t need the hat 
well  be polite  and good 
and friendly 
 rock music playing 
cruella  how does the saying go 
 i am woman  hear me roar  
well  that wasn t much
of a thing back in 1964 
but it was about to be 
hi  my name s estella

 boys laughing 
cruella   ignore them  
didn t i just say   hear me roar  
students   chanting 
fight  fight  fight 
cruella  that didn t sit well
with some people 
this is a blot on your copybook 
cruella  okay  that didn t
sit well with a lot of people 
 students laughing 
enough 
she deserved it 
cruella  but i found friends
in unlikely places 
estella  hello

there s a dog 
buddy  i found him 
cruella  and not this guy 
her  anita darling 
what a fabulous name 
   students laughing 
   gasps 
 rock music continues 
you could say
i pretty much roared my way
through all of primary school 
 school bell ringing 
almost 
well  i think it s clear what happens now 
estella  you are expelled   
i m withdrawing her from your school 
i m expelling her 
it s too late because
i withdrew her first 
so that can t be on her record 
i d said expelled  i d already said it 
hadn t 
didn t 
and might i say  your school
seems to turn out horrible children
with no creativity or compassion 
or genius 
you re out   scoffing 
 loudly  out 
cruella  being a genius is one thing 
raising a genius  however 
does come with its challenges 
london  here we come 
well  we don t really have a choice 
you have no school 
it s nothing to celebrate 
 sighs  well

in a small town anyway

regent s park  perfect 
when we get to the city 
first thing we ll do 
we ll go to the fountain 
and we ll have a cup of tea
and we ll start planning
how to make this london thing work 
why are you in your best dress 
i need to make a stop
on our way to the city 
just ask a friend for a little help
to get us on our feet 
what friend

 upbeat music playing 
cruella  i meant it when i said it

cruella  i figured while mum was busy
seeing her mysterious friend

 indistinct chatter 
 upbeat music playing

i wanted to be a fashion designer

cruella  he was right  i was a fugitive 
   estella sobbing

my last show was a triumph 
shall i read to you from tattletale 
 baroness designs stunned
with her reinvention of the a line
   with a bias cut and higher line that   
   coughs 
    reshapes the silhouette
in such an audacious way
 the audience broke into
rapturous applause at first sight 
 she really is a genius  
i ll read that bit again  shall i 
 she really is a genius  
a triumph 
take a moment to revel in it 
 inhales deeply 
oh  that s enough  new show

soy salmon  lemon zest risotto 
cucumber sliced into two inch diagonals
at an eighth of an inch width
sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley 
shredded  not torn 
right 
as the department stores
that stock your range 
we thought perhaps
we could give you some input 
feedback 
oh  great  i ll start  shall i 
my feedback 
you re short  you re fat 
you smell like an anchovy 
you re color blind 
but you pretend you aren t 
you re a man
who can t take responsibility 
your revenues are down 15  
your foot traffic by 12 and a half 
yes  i do my own research 
your store hasn t been refurbished
since the blitz 
people don t know whether to buy a frock
or duck and cover 
and most of the funds meant for refurbs
are being embezzled by you 
stashing them in swiss bank
account number 32254766
to be precise 
that s me  your turn 
i m all ears 
good day 
   door opens 
  imbeciles 
 door closes 
lunch  now 
oh  finally  someone competent 
whoa

actually  he s a good lawyer 
hi 
hi 
piano s nice 
yes 
time for my nine minute power nap 
box up my lunch  estella 
 grunts 
it could do with a lining 
you could use tulle to puff it out 
give it some body 
that s what i just said 
 upbeat music playing 
baroness 
keep up  estella 
jewels 
and  estella  make the bodice
pencil thin 
estella  did you make it pencil thin

the baroness said
she thinks i m something 
i think that s good 
everything s going so well  mum 
i m really trying to be
the estella that you wanted 
mostly  it s working 
i just wish you were here to see it 
baroness  there s something
about it that irritates me
and i always trust my instincts 
i thought maybe
if you tighten the silhouette   
oh  you thought  did you 
i think it s better 
actually  it is 
 chuckles 
your necklace 
oh 
family heirloom  funny story  actually 
an employee once stole it 
no  she did not 
 hesitates  sorry 
slight tone delivery problem  i meant   
 no  she did not  
did she work for you 
mmm  once  years before 
she stole this 
was stupid enough to come back
and then she fell off a cliff and died 
how terrible 
yes  it was  actually 
it was during my winter ball
and her death really overshadowed
the whole thing 
time for my nine minute power nap 
who was the woman 
not really the point of the story 
the story s about how lucky i am 
but anyway  she had a kid 
kid s a snowflake 
special  blah blah blah 
it was a basic shakedown
situation actually 
maybe she   
maybe she just really loved her kid 
maybe she only had one person
to take care of
and she failed dismally 
 dramatic music plays 
 door opens 
   clears throat 
  speak 
baroness  we have that meeting
at the ritz 
oh  for heaven s sakes 
 sighs 
necklace 
roger  shoes 
don t touch the ankle 
roger  yes  sorry  it s in 
baroness  come along 
 door opens 
 door closes 
cruella  my mother hadn t
failed dismally  i had 
and i wasn t going to fail her again 
told you  she always comes here 
oi 
you all right 
she called my mum a thief 
said she failed as a mother 
what  your mum 
she knew your actual mum 
yeah  it turns out
that was her party we were at 
mum worked for her once 
i dropped the necklace
as i was running away 
she must ve found it 
it s mine  so i m taking it back 
  taking it  as in   
  stealing it 
yeah 
ladies and gentlemen 
i give you    the angle 
 upbeat music playing 
her black and white ball 
that s where we ll do it 
it s our biggest job ever 
oi  horace  attention 
estella  we need to know
their security setup 
power nap  nine minutes 
estella  where the cameras are 
where the guards are posted 
and what the schedules are 
we need to know every detail
and every blind spot 
 conversing in french 
 sighs 
 in english  okay 
the toilet s just on the left 
and then go straight down to the end 
thanks 
 alarm rings 
estella  then  all we need to do
is disable the security system 
bypass the cameras 
open the safe  steal the necklace
during the biggest party of the season 
so many people  her security
will be stretched to the limit
and just to be sure  a distraction 
where i get the key
to the keypad and safe 
right  so what is the distraction 
i ve discovered she likes to throw women
who offend her sensibilities
out of her parties 
  old women  women in gold 
  ow 
  sad women 
   woman gasps 
  women who carry poodles 
   gasps 
but also stunningly dressed women
who pull the focus off of her 
what about one of the elderly broads 
me  horace  i will be the distraction 
all right 
besides  wreaking havoc at galas
is my personal specialty 
well  i don t know about that 
but here s a problem   
won t she recognize you 
that s a good point 
  i guess 
  and when that happens 
won t you lose your job 
it s not on the board 
  a job i think you love 
  are you thinking 
i mean  she sees you re talented  right 
yes  yes 
well  maybe   
maybe you don t need the necklace 
maybe   
mate  come on  it s the angle 
  it s just a necklace 
  i want it back 
she s the boss 
and you re right 
you re right  she will recognize me 
so estella can t go to the ball 
but i know someone who can 
 indistinct chatter 
 r b music playing 
horace  right  let s do it 
yeah  let s go and ruin someone s day 
you mean the baroness 
obviously  i mean the baroness

  someone could be anyone   
  let s just do this  horace 
 grunts 
not tonight  son 
well  you know what 
they said it was an emergency 
this is a private event 
kind of vermin i deal with 
they don t wait for an invitation 
what they do is  they get in 
they bite posh people
who then froth at the mouth 
their eyes spin in the back of their heads
and then the posh people die 
that s a beautiful story  mate 
i almost welled up  yeah 
freeze  freeze 
whatever you do  don t turn around 
   snarling 
   screaming 
well  don t just stand there 
get in and get him out 
i told you not to turn around

i hate to ruin your party 
but i ve come to evict you 
 chuckles  don t be absurd 
this is the key that was in the necklace
that unlocks the box
my birth certificate was in 
hello  mother 
it all makes sense now 
what 
that you re so extraordinary 
of course  you re mine 
i ve longed for someone in my life
who was as good as me 
you left me to die 
a mistake 
and one we can get past  i know it 
i disagree 
good evening 
the baroness asks that you join her
  on the terrace 
  lovely 
gentlemen  the baroness would like
to invite you outside  please 
you re not here for revenge 
you re here because
you re a brilliant designer
and a wicked genius
and you need to be among your own kind 
me 
your real mother 
who made a mistake
and let something extraordinary go 
we are very alike  i suppose 
 siren blaring 
good evening 
madam  ravishing as always 
the baroness requests
your presence outside 
 hesitates  i m sorry 
you are 
i am 
can i hug you 
yes 
you re not going to push me
off the cliff  are you 
 whispers  you re so funny  dear 
so funny 
i love it 
  idiot 
   grunts 
 all gasping 
 gasps 
 guests exclaiming 
she jumped 
did you see  she jumped 
she tried to drag me with her 
she jumped  she jumped  she jumped 
why are you looking at me like that 
 breathing heavily  oh 
she jumped 
what are you doing with those handcuffs 
she jumped 
cruella  so i told you i died 
estella  that is 
poor thing 
she couldn t even get anyone
to come to her own funeral 
that seemed like an unhappy ending 
murdered tragically
by her very own mother 
  idiot 
   grunts 
a few things 
before she died 
estella willed her fortune
to her dear friend   
cruella de vil 
can t you idiots see 
that estella person  it s a trick 
she s really cruella 
cruella  cruella de vil 
it s spelled  devil  
but it s pronounced  de vil  
you wait  i ll get even 
cruella  the good thing
about evil people is
you can always trust them
to do something  well 
evil 
estella would die like her mother did 
but not quite 
a well cut skirt is a lifesaver  girls 
remember that 
she d go to prison
for throwing someone off a cliff 
wrong someone  but there s something about
poetic justice that s just so
poetic 
goodbye  estella 
she was with her mother now 
i ll take it from here 
but cruella was alive 
all right  we should put on
some music or something 
lighten the mood 
 sniffles 
she s not actually dead  mate  she s   
 sighs 
how can you not get choked up at all this 
oh  man 
cruella  and i call that a happy ending 
 rock music playing 
 horace gasps 
has  uh  genghis put on a bit of weight 
so  what now 
i ve got a few ideas 
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
she s born to be bad
so run for the hills
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
the fear on your face
it gives me a thrill
who wants to be nice 
who wants to be tame 
all of you good guys
y all seem the same
original  criminal
dressed to kill
just call me cruella de vil
call me crazy  call me insane
but you re stuck in the past
and i m ahead of the game
a life lived in penance
it just seems a waste
and the devil has much better taste
and i tried to be sweet
i tried to be kind
but i feel much better now that i m
out of my mind
oh  there always line in the gates of hell
but i go right to the front gate
 cause i dress this well
rip it up  leave it all in tatters
beauty is the only thing that matters
the fabric of your little world is torn
embrace the darkness
be really blind
cruella de vil
the fear on your face
it gives me a thrill
 humming 
 doorbell ringing 
 whining 
roger  hello  pongo 
roger   singing 
cruella de vil
cruella de vil
if she doesn t scare you
no evil thing will
to see her is to take a certain chill
