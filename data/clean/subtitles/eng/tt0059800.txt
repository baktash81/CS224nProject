at this moment 
rather him than me 
at least you ve been saved
the effort of removing him 
colonel bouvar passed away
in his sleep  so they tell me 
you sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself 
i am  jacques bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues 
is there anything else our
french station can do for monsiuer bond 
later  perhaps 
as i said  later  come on 
madame   
i ve come to offer
my sincere condolences 
my dear colonel bouvar   
i don t think you should have
opened that car door by yourself 
no well dressed man
should be without one 
yes  very practical 
get inside 
  they re coming to get me 
  hurry 
he always runs
while others walk
he acts
while other men just talk
he looks at this world
and wants it all
so he strikes
like thunderball
he knows the meaning
of success
his needs are more
so he gives less
they call him
the winner who takes all
and he strikes
like thunderball
any woman he wants
he ll get
he will break any heart
without regret
his days of asking
are all gone
his fight goes on
and on and on
but he thinks that the fight
is worth it all
so he strikes
like thunderball
hey  no parking here 
pardon  monsieur largo 
the international brotherhood for
the assistance of stateless persons   
is purely philanthropic 
we re not interested in politics   
only in your rehabilitation 
we have been able to arrange for
visas at the brazilian consulate 
the brotherhood
will look after you until   
  good morning  mr  largo 
  good morning 
  nice to have you back again 
  thank you  my dear 
  we pay back everything 
  there will be no need 
we have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim 
sit down  number two 
we will discuss   
your nato project later 
i regret to inform you all
of the death of spectre number six 
colonel jacques bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin 
his services will be greatly missed 
we will now proceed with the area
financial reports  number seven 
blackmail of the double agent
matsou fujiwa 
unfortunately  only 40 million yen 
  all the man had

our expectations were considerably
higher  number 11 
competition from latin america 
prices are down 
i anticipated that factor 
are you quite sure all monies   
have been accounted for
by yourself and number nine 
  to the penny  number one 
  on the contrary   
i have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly   
guilty of embezzlement 
spectre is a dedicated fraternity   
whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members 
the culprit is known to me 
i have decided
on the appropriate action 
let us now proceed with new business 
we will hear from number two 
who s in charge of our nato project   
the most ambitious spectre
has ever undertaken 
your report  number two 
thank you  number one 
our intention
is to demand a ransom   
from the
north atlantic treaty powers   
of 280 million dollars   
100 million pounds 
i have sent spectre agent count lippe
to the south of england   
where he is making
the necessary preparations 
he is at a health clinic   
conveniently located
near the nato air base

pushed the switch accidentally 
you better come along with me 
spend a few minutes in the steam room 
it ll help to relax you 
  yes 
  might even shrink you back to size 
somebody s going to wish
today had never happened

angelo 
your breathing equipment 
isolates you from the oxygen supply 
gamma gas  instantaneous 
type you just used  and most important   
not enough 
100 000 dollars is not enough 
  what are you trying to say 
  i changed my mind 
two years of my life   
studying the film  the reports   
plastic operations  voice lessons 
make it a quarter of a million 
or get someone else 
  there is no one else 
  exactly  i am derval 
put that away  angelo is right 
i ll inform number one
we made a new arrangement 
this is merely a down payment 
all right  but against
a quarter of a million 
  agreed 
  his watch

and you ll be accompanied   
by a nato representative 
commandant derval   
major derval of nato 
it s a routine flight 
you ll be flying a vulcan   
at an altitude of 45 000 feet   
armed with two atomic bombs 
m o s  type 
fuses as usual
in the white security box 
oh  those damned aeroplanes 
they re enough to drive you mad 
unless  of course 
it s that mink glove of yours 
i ll shut out the noise 
james  where are you going 
nowhere  i thought
i d take a little exercise 
you must be joking 
come on 
quiet 
can i help you 
county police here 
hello 
  what s going on 
  i don t know 
could it be the front doorbell 
  it most certainly could not 
  hello 
haven t you had enough exercise
for one evening 
it s funny you should say that 
point of return   
45 minutes  30 seconds 
switch from manual to auto 
it s set on automatic  commandant   
would you care to change places
with the copilot 
  better view up here 
  i d be delighted 
this is southern radar 
you are now under
positive radar control 
this is avoiding action 
request you report your position 
take this  will you 
what s the flap  dawson 
o b n r  sir  nato training flight 
air traffic flashed us 
they lost it on radar  we haven t
been able to pick it up anywhere 
was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen 
rapidly 
we can t scan below 300 feet 
  she may have gone down 
  was she in trouble 
not according to the last report 
which came from about here 
  she is armed  isn t she 
  two atomic weapons  m o s  type 
get everything you can into the area 
a thorough search 
notify the admiralty at once 
top priority  absolute security 
  ask them to contact washington 
  very good  sir 
is there anything else in sight 
no  all clear 
switch on
the underwater landing lights 
open the underwater hatch 
  stand by to winch in the submarine 
  man the winches 
  give these bomb fuses to mr  kutze 
  right  sir 
get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers 
kutze  are you pleased
with your new toys 
some new safety device 
a secret control 
what can they have that the great
ladislav kutze cannot handle 
life was much simpler
in my warsaw laboratory 
your share will amount to
how many nobel prizes 
pull forward 
more  hold it 
paris  sir 
number one on the scrambler 
number two speaking 
phase two completed 
number two has done well 
unlike count lippe   
whose choice of angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project 
send a message to the execution branch 
you will write 
or telephone at the least 
day by day  i m truly sorry
i have to dash off like this 
there s been a bit
of a flap at the office 
  what kind of work do you do 
  i travel   
sort of a licensed troubleshooter 
mr  angelo  heart attack last night 
i m not surprised 
  keep in touch 
  anytime  james  anyplace 
another time  another place 
  you are late 
  yes 
some people on the road
really burn you up these days 
in the conference room 
something pretty big 
every double 0 man in europe has been
rushed in  and the home secretary too 
his wife s probably lost her dog 
well  now that we re all here   
the prime minister
has asked the home secretary   
to come and represent him here today 
the home secretary 
gentlemen  the tape
that you are about to hear   
was received at 10 downing street
this morning 
my dear prime minister 
two atomic bombs   
numbers 4 5 6 and 4 5 7   
which were aboard nato flight 7 5 9   
are now in the possession of spectre 
unless within the next seven days
your government   
pays to us
100 million pounds sterling   
in a manner to be designated by us   
we shall destroy
a major city in england   
or the united states of america 
please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging   
for big ben to strike seven times   
at 6 00 p  m  tomorrow 
the prime minister and the president   
have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed   
that unless the bombs are recovered 
payment will have to be made 
to avoid general panic   
complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements 
the prime minister has asked
that your department   
take charge of the operation 
thank you  sir john 
this circle represents
the full flying range of the vulcan 
extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash   
or landing  and worldwide reports
have proved negative   
on all airfields large enough
to handle the vulcan 
  that s all we have  sir 
  thank you  sir john 
i ll leave you to carry on 
we ll keep you in touch from number 10 
thank you  sir 
you may now open the folders
in front of you 
code name  thunderball 
as you can see 
we ve very little to go on 
all the members of the crew   
had top security clearance 
you ll find their photographs
and service records in your files 
you ll be working with nato  c i  a   
and all allied intelligence units 
that s all   
until you discuss your
individual assignments with me 
i ve assigned you
to station c  canada 
group captain pritchard here
will be your air force liaison 
sir  i respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to nassau 
is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports 
perhaps this  sir 
  well 
  there was a photograph of that man   
in this dossier you gave us 
his name is derval 
i saw him last night at shrublands 
but he was dead 
oh  no  sir  not possible 
he was seen   
boarding the vulcan
and took off last night 
if 007 says he saw derval
last night and he was dead   
that s enough for me
to initiate inquiries 
yes  of course 
  who is this girl 
  derval s sister 
  do you know where she is now 
  nassau 
do you think she s worth going after 
i wouldn t put it quite that way 
we ve only got four days 
don t spend your time sitting around 
no  sir  i won t 
good luck 
thank you  sir 
smashing figure 
i don t suppose   
that has anything to do
with your request 
was there ever a man
more misunderstood 
you can t pull the wool over my eyes 
you may be able to con the old man 
but i know better  i could   
so do i  miss moneypenny 
and i ll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man 
i think i had a hat when i came in

your luck was due to change 
we ll soon find out 
any objection to raise the limit 
500 pounds shall we say 
  too big for me 
  count me out too 
perhaps you would like
to take the shoe 
my friend won t mind  mr   
  bond 
  oh  yes  mr  bond

let s see what it does for the cards 
  no

to buy the lady a drink 
  i would appreciate that 
  then i must pass the shoe

beluga caviar  dom perignon   55

interesting 
  my key  it s 304  please 
  thank you  304 
  i m sorry  no mail 
  thank you 
well  hello  00   
that s a fine way
to treat the c i a 
sorry about that  felix 
but you were about to say 007 
here 
have you killed him 
you know me better than that 
here you go  smiler 
have you seen everything
you came to see 
go back to your friends and report 
tell them  the little fish i throw back
into the sea  give it to him 
you re going to shoot me in the back 
the gun  i mean 
get out 
  who was he 
  like i said  a small fish   
working for a mr  largo 
he s got a yacht
we should take a look at later 
  quist to see mr  largo 
  open up 
yes  it s quist 
gently  my friend 
  what did you find 
  nothing 
  you saw bond 
  yes  i saw him 
what happened 
you let him get the better of you 
hey  there 
did you finally make contact 
you re late  felix leiter 
this is pinder  our man here 
  how do you do 
  this way  gentlemen 
  who s the girl 
  paula kaplan  my assistant here 
he has no plans
to visit the united states 
now here s a special announcement   
from the overseas service
of the b b c 
big ben actually did strike
seven times at 6 00 this evening 
this was caused
by a mechanical failure   
which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898 
and here once again
are the headlines 
obviously stalling for time 
  oh  no 
  ah  007 
  what a wonderful surprise 
  for me too 
i must say  i find this business
of equipping you in the field   
on the run  as it were   
highly irregular 
here we have a geiger counter 
useful and unobtrusive 
the sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count 
  it s waterproof  of course 
  but of course 
now  here s something i want you
to use with special care 
  with special care 
  everything you give me   
is treated with equal contempt 
yes  i know 
but that s an underwater camera 
it takes eight pictures   
in rapid succession
by pressing that button there 
  is that clever 
  if you can take pictures   
in the dark with an infrared film  yes 
try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self  007 
here s a miniature very pistol   
which fires a bright red flare 
a distress signal 
you should keep it on you
day and night 
i resent that remark 
look  do you mind 
now  in the event of a re breather
not being available   
you can use this device
for short periods only  of course 
say  about four minutes 
  clever 
  you ll only use it as a last resort 
it closes
to a convenient pocket size 
assuming one has a convenient pocket 
now pay attention 
a recently developed   
harmless radioactive device 
harmless 
it sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver 
  what am i supposed to do with this 
  obviously  you   
swallow it 
now 
let s hope she ll still be lying
in the same place tonight 
we ll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later 
good idea 
take her in 
a container will be dropped
off the coast of burma   
in the megui archipelago   
latitude 20 degrees north 
longitude 60 degrees east   
at 20 hundred hours
greenwich mean time on may 27 
it will hold blue white
flawless diamonds between   
three and eight carats 
total value to be not less than
100 million pounds   
present market price 
after we have
recovered the container   
and verified its contents   
you will be notified on
radio frequency 16 23 megacycles   
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered 
kenniston  you d better get on
to de beers at once 
yes  sir 
well  gentlemen 
unless those bombs are found   
i m very much afraid
we ll have to pay their price 
  sir 
  oh  yes 
signal from 007 in nassau 
one or two things
that might interest us 
the disco volante is still in the
harbor  lying off the casino channel 
the catamaran is there too 
so we can use it for cover 
that s fine  you can drop me
in the water behind her 
  any further news from london 
  no 
zero hour is still
20 hundred hours on the 27th 
  that s just 55 hours from now 
  yes  shall we go 
  okay  this will do here 
  we ll meet back at pinder s 
good luck 
turn the underwater lights on 
tv  closed circuit 
hand grenades 
ready 
down there 
there 
hey  there s something there 
look  must have hit him
with the propeller 
let s get back and tell largo 
  can i have a lift 
  sure 
thank you 
you just about saved my life 
my outboard capsized 
so i had to swim ashore 
how far do you go 
you better fasten your safety belt 
what s your name 
james bond 
fiona volpe 
  do you fly here often 
  do i make you nervous 
no  it s just that
i have no desire   
to be capsized twice in one night 
at least you won t
have to swim ashore 
have you been here before  mr  bond 
no  i haven t 
but this is the road to nassau 
yes  eventually 
  well  this is as far as i go 
  me too  this is my hotel 
  what a coincidence 
  yes  so convenient 
you look pale 
i hope i didn t frighten you 
you see  i ve always
been a nervous passenger 
some men just don t like to be driven 
no  some men just don t like
to be taken for a ride 
look at this 
an underwater hatch 
yeah  so that s how
they could leave and get back 
yes  and nobody saw them 
obviously the whole operation   
was carried out underwater 
that s where we ll have to look
for the plane  come on 
i ll bring the prints
to the hotel when they re dry 
don t forget the air force searched
the area 250 miles out of nassau 
it must be beyond that radius 
that s if the disco volante
was out that night 
sure she was  but harbor control
said for only six hours 
she couldn t cover 500 miles
in that time  no 
about 90 miles is her limit for
six hours  and that s out and back 
i reckon we ve got to go further out 
we ll need more gas for that 
all right 
let s get back to nassau 
  we haven t got much time 
  you re right  we haven t 
pull 
of course they are watching us 
what else have they to do 
  you would like bond dead 
  i can think of no better arrangement 
because he tries to make love
to your woman 
because he is bond  and as an enemy
of spectre  he should be killed 
mark 
if bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness   
his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here 
when the time is right 
he will be killed  pull 
i shall kill him 
a separate pool 
for sharks  no less  move in 
hold on that line 
that s largo s place  all right 
my next port of call 
  mr  largo 
  yes  sir 
thank you 
  can i help 
  why  mr  bond 
  of course you can 
  that looks particularly inviting 
  welcome to palmyra 
  it s a pleasure 
i just hope i m not
interrupting anything 
  what do you mean 
  i thought you had another visitor 
that gun  it looks
more fitting for a woman 
you know much about guns 
no  i know a little about women 
mr  jenni  mr  vargas 
mr  vargas  mr  jenni 
  which is which 
  i thought you might have met   
mr  vargas the other night 
  yes  i believe i did 
  drink  sir 
  rum collins 
  yes 
just about that hour  isn t it 
for you  of course 
vargas does not drink 
does not smoke   
does not make love 
what do you do  vargas 
every man has his passion 
mine is fishing 
what is yours  mr  bond 
well  i m not what you d call
a passionate man 
i think it s time i went to change 
you must let me show you around 
  i d love that 
  i thought you might 
pull 
  what could be easier 
  perhaps you would call one for me 
  of course  pull 
  it seems terribly difficult 
no  it isn t  is it 
i collect big game fish
for various marine institutions 
magnificent creatures 
charming 
the notorious golden grotto sharks 
the most savage  the most dangerous 
they know when it s time
for them to be fed 
  that boat  is she yours 
  yes  i m very proud of her 
what does she do  about 15 knots 
better than that  near 20 
  perhaps you d like to see over her 
  yes  i would very much 
  lunch is ready 
  thank you  my darling 
come along  mr  bond 
the conch chowder smells delicious 
domino  i was just thinking 
as i ll be busy this evening 
perhaps mr  bond will be kind enough   
to take you to the jankanoo 
our local mardi gras 
you ll be my guest tonight 
  that s very kind of you 
  it will be my pleasure 
our mr  bond must have
a very high opinion of himself 
opinion 
yes  he has a date with me too 
excuse me 
  let me go 
  over here 
don t let her make so much noise 
use the chloroform 
largo did promise
he d come  didn t he 
he ll be here  don t worry 
i think that man is waving at you 
come down here 
quick 
excuse me for a second 
  james  paula s gone 
  what do you mean  gone 
she just checked out of the hotel 
you look after domino  watch her 
  do you think she was onto something 
  i don t know  but i gotta find out 
  you watch out for her 
  right 
all right  thank you 
the governor s not very happy 
but you ll have   
a power cut as requested
all over the island 
i don t give a damn
about the rest of the island 
  i want the lights out in palmyra 
  you ll have it 
what do you mean  she won t talk 
don t worry  she will 
what s wrong 
  is it a power failure 
  yes  all over the island 
switch over
to the emergency generator 
largo told you to be careful 
i didn t kill her 
she must have taken some poison 
a capsule in the mouth 
what do you think  cyanide 
she s dead 
ricardo  someone s got him 
search that way 
and you  the shark pool 
  what happened 
  i don t know 
leave him  this way 
stop it 
you fools  he s got
you all shooting at each other 
over here 
no  i ve got a better idea 
lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat 
yes  sir 
sorry  old chap 
better luck next time 
tell leiter to stay with the girl 
i ll get back to him as soon as i can 
  anything else 
  tell him paula s dead 
aren t you in the wrong room 
not from where i m standing 
since you re here  would you mind
giving me something to put on 
anyway  i m very glad to see you again 
i m glad to see you again 
i had the feeling
you ve been avoiding me 
i had no idea that
we were next door neighbors 
they just moved me down
this afternoon 
it s extraordinary  isn t it 
almost as if   
as if it was intended 
yes  it is extraordinary 
shouldn t you get out
of those wet clothes 
you ll catch your death of cold 
look  you know
we re going to be too late 
  too late for what 
  the jankanoo 
i promised my friends
i d meet them there 
perhaps you know them  the largos 
questions  all i get is questions 
but the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow 
enough to drive you wild 
do you like wild things 
wild  you should be
locked up in a cage 
this bed feels like a cage 
all these bars 
do you think i ll be safe 
you made a shocking mess out of
my hair  you sadistic brute 
will you zip me up  please 
no wonder you can
get dressed so quickly 
on the way  we can have a little talk 
you may find it interesting  come on 
i m coming 
i hate to think
i m gonna miss anything 
and now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk 
friends of yours  no doubt  come in 
you dress quickly too 
i didn t see that gun in the mirror 
not that it matters  but that
was under the pillow all the time 
when did you find out 
you re wearing the same ring
as largo 
  it s a ring i like to wear 
  then it has its dangers 
vanity  mr  bond 
  it s something you know so much about 
  my dear girl 
don t flatter yourself  what i did
this evening was for king and country 
you don t think it gave me
any pleasure  do you 
but of course 
i forgot your ego 
james bond  who only has
to make love to a woman   
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing 
she repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue 
but not this one 
what a blow it must have been 
you having a failure 
well  you can t win them all 
we ll take him out the front way 
go and get the car 
careful  mr  bond 
now what 
get through to palmyra and tell them
we ve been held up by the jankanoo 
  like to have a drink  man 
  get him away 
  don t you try anything now 
  get out of here 
  it s real firewater 
  get out of here 
after him  get him 
you haven t seen anything 
look 
follow him  you that side  you there 
stay with us 
  thank you  i d love to 
  love to what 
  you re mad  do you know that 
  yes  isn t everyone 
may i cut in 
you should have told me
your wife was here 
do you come here often 
it s no good trying to escape 
i don t want to escape 
strange as it may seem 
i ve grown accustomed to your face 
why don t you come with us quietly 
you don t seem to understand 
you see  i enjoy my dancing 
do you mind if my friend
sits this one out  she s just dead 
you ll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at aden to refuel 
you will then proceed
to the megui archipelago   
to make your drop precisely at   
20 degrees north 
60 degrees east 
the diamonds will be
in a special container 
i hate to give in like this 
paying the blood money 
letting them beat us 
  have you an alternative suggestion 
  i m afraid i haven t 
your man  007 
i thought he was on to something 
  i thought so too  sir 
  false alarm 
  i m afraid so 
  he obviously has   
a highly developed sense of 
shall we say  drama 
if 007 thought
he was on to something   
it s a great pity he didn t make sure
before he started to shout the odds 
well  we have exactly
14 hours and 50 minutes 
then i suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can  shan t we 
well  that s it  james 
we ve looked about everywhere 
we ve got to find that plane 
you won t find it down there 
that s the golden grotto 
  golden grotto 
  yeah  all you ll find   
down there are sharks 
take her down  i want a closer look 
  at what 
  never mind  take her down  quick 
set her down 
i think we ve found it 
there s something camouflaged
down there  i ll take a look 
shoot one of those sharks 
it ll keep the others occupied 
i don t know how long the others
will take before they finish him off   
  but they ll be back 
  i ll keep an eye on them 
good 
  she s down there  all right 
  are the bombs on board 
  no 
  great  what s our next move 
we ll check on the disco volante 
if the bombs aren t aboard her now 
they soon will be 
who are you going to ask  largo 
no  i don t think we ll have to 
i hope we didn t frighten the fish 
ow  sea egg spines 
they re poisonous 
here  give me your arm 
sit down 
now turn over 
this is going to hurt a bit 
it s the first time i ve
tasted women  they re rather good 
you re the only man
to ever make me cry 
except perhaps francois 
my brother  when we were children 
domino  i have to tell you something 
i m sorry  james  i didn t mean
to embarrass you  speaking of love 
  i must hurt you again 
  you re going away 
so sorry  my dear  but it s all over 
no  it s about your brother 
what about him 
he s dead 
what happened 
it s a long story 
and it involves your friend largo 
i need your help 
of course 
that s why you made love to me 
look  i can t explain
what this is all about 
  but you must trust me 
  because you want me to help you 
largo had your brother murdered 
or it was on his orders 
hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon   
if you don t help me 
that much we do know 
but there s something we don t   
the bombs  when they re being loaded
aboard the disco volante 
  how could i know that 
  that you ll have to find out 
it won t be easy 
it could be very dangerous 
what can he do to me
he hasn t already done 
then you ll do it 
  yes 
  good 
this is a geiger counter 
you press this lever 
if it starts clicking 
it means the bombs are aboard 
  what do i do then 
  go straight up on deck 
as the disco volante is being watched 
you ll be spotted 
vargas  behind you 
really 
he must have followed us 
i think he got the point 
it should have been largo 
largo  when did he expect you back 
very soon now  he said not to be late 
he was most insistent 
you better go straight back  i ll take
care of vargas and everything here 
understand i m doing this for
my brother  for what he did to him 
but promise you will kill largo
for me  whatever happens 
  we haven t much time 
  all right 
oh  something i remembered 
it may not be important 
  tell me  everything s important 
  there s a small bridge over the canal 
largo never allows strangers
to go near it 
by the canal there s a flight of steps 
  where do they lead to 
  down into the sea   
on the far side of palmyra 
perhaps it is important after all 
put on your equipment 
did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the disco 
yes  sir  signal received at   
  if she is on board  where is 007 now 
  that s the question 
stand by  five seconds 
watch my signal 
  prepare to get underway 
  aye  aye  sir 
captain  weigh anchor 
get underway immediately 
once we pick up the merchandise 
head for our target area  miami 
the disco volante s leaving  sir 
  i told you to stay in your cabin 
  it s stuffy in there 
  i want a breath of air 
  my dear  did you not hear me 
  where did you get that 
  i bought it this morning 
  let me see 
  no  why should i 
mr  bond gave you this little toy 
i imagine  and vargas is dead 
no  my dear 
there is no escape for you 
like your friend 
you ve been a little too clever 
and now you are caught 
you have given me
much pleasure  domino 
but in return  unless you tell me
how much bond knows   
i ll be forced to cause you great pain 
this for heat  these for cold 
applied scientifically and slowly 
very  very slowly 
  what do you want 
  we re activating the bombs 
  you said you wanted to be told 
  oh  yes 
a private little matter between
the young woman and myself 
go 
do not live in hope  my dear 
there is no one to rescue you 
now go on 
it s a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed   
is still working 
straight ahead 
go right 
that s him 
hold it 
up 
get your radio man
on to orlando beach 
warn them the target is miami 
also  the bomb is transferred
from the disco volante   
onto a wreck off fowley point 
right  hang on to that 
and the kitchen sink 
on you  everything looks good 
take this 
good luck 
  weigh anchor 
  aye  aye  sir 
  make smoke 
  making smoke now 
  stand by for conversion 
  standing by 
jettison cocoon 
cocoon s away 
keep firing  they re closing 
fire more  more 
wait a minute 
we ve still got one bomb aboard 
he s gone mad 
please talk to them for me 
tell them that i only did what
i had to do  what i was told to do 
  where is he 
  the bomb cannot be exploded now 
i threw the arming device
into the sea 
  do you understand 
  yes 
get him 
  i m glad i killed him 
  you re glad 
  who s he 
  i don t know  but he helped me 
  look out  the rocks 
  the reef 
he s jammed the controls 
come on
