okay  one dance 
  this is officer thomas 
  my name is lorraine warren 
i know how this is
going to sound 
but there s going to be a tragedy
at the brookfield boarding kennels 
debbie 
  arne   
  bruno 
no  stop 
arne 
bruno  stop 
arne  help me 
arne  whoa  what is going on 
what are you doing 
arne  please stop it 
baby 
what the hell 
no  stop 
hey 
you okay there 
hey 
you okay 
now  you just stay right there  okay 
don t move 
i think i hurt someone 
this is sergeant thomas 
i have one victim down 
multiple stab wounds 
residents of brookfield
were shocked this afternoon
by the broad daylight murder
of bruno sauls 
sauls  the manager
of a local dog kennel 
was stabbed 22 times 
this is the first murder in
that town s 193 year history 
who shall ascend
into the hill of the lord 
or who shall stand
in his holy place 
he that hath clean hands 
and a pure heart 
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity 
nor sworn deceitfully 
he shall receive the blessing
from the lord 
and righteousness from the god
of his salvation 
right  that s enough 
thank you 
well 
these religious objects
would ve been enough
to provoke an inhuman spirit 
if there was one present 
does that mean
he s not possessed 
the fact that he can read
from the bible just seals it 
so  what does this mean 
then   
i m just crazy 
well    you re not possessed 
but that doesn t mean
that you weren t 
i    invited this
thing into me 
and that s the reason
that he s dead 
so  you know 
whatever happens to me 
i ve got it coming 
no  you don t 
look   
i was there 
whatever is going on   
whatever happened that day   
that was not arne 
we re going to help you
in every way that we can 
if the demon s gone 
what can you do now 
who s your lawyer 
he was found covered
in the victim s blood 
the murder weapon belongs to him and
it s got his fingerprints all over it 
nobody s disputing any of that 
arne knows that he s going to prison 
all we re saying is that there
were mitigating circumstances 
mitigating circumstances 
look  i don t think he should
get the death sentence  either 
but i am not going
before a grand jury
and saying he was possessed
by demons 
it s never been done 
yes it has  it s been done
twice in england 
the michael taylor case
was just a few years ago 
let me rephrase that 
it s never been done successfully 
then let us help you 
ed and i have proven the existence
of the demonic hundreds of times 
you ve proven it to the church 
this is a court of law 
the standards of evidence
are completely different 
the courts accepts
the existence of god
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth 
i think it s about time they
accept the existence of the devil 
how are you going
to convince a jury
if you can t even convince me 
i ll tell you what 
you come over to our house for dinner 
we ll show you the evidence
we ve collected over the years 
introduce you to annabelle 
if you re not convinced 
we ll butt out 
deal 
all right 
show me what you got 
mr  johnson  to count one of
indictment number s a j 1 2 1 6 
which charges you with
first degree murder 
a class a felony 
how do you plead 
your honor 
my client pleads not guilty
by reason of
demonic possession 
this is ridiculous 
i can walk down a flight of stairs 
oh  hush  you shouldn t
even be out of bed 
lorraine 
i just talked to a friend of
mine in the prosecutor s office 
he s gonna go for
the death penalty 
i ll build the case 
but that kid is gonna either live or die
depending on what you two find 
well  we won t let him down 
i hope not 
keep me posted 
so  what now 
we ve never had to prove
a possession after the fact 
demons don t just
disappear like this 
there s something else
going on here 
something that we missed
the first time 
where do we start 
at the beginning 
it s july 18th  1981 
this is ed warren 
here with lorraine   
and judy glatzel 
deborah glatzel 
david glatzel
and arne johnson 
all right  let s get started 
who was there when david first
started exhibiting this behavior 
we all were 
it was the day we moved in 
there you go 
go have fun with them 
  wanna order some pizza 
  yeah sure  i ll do that right now 
  hey 
  put that box down a second 
  why 
  i just   
what are you doing 
  have a look   
  what is    arne 
you know you re supposed to
do this when you get married 
okay  so maybe
we ll do that too 
oh 
no 
mom 
i didn t know
what happened 
it was like a dream 
and nobody believed me
when i told them 
but that was the first time
i saw it 
i don t get it 
how could he have invited a demon 
he was only in here for a few minutes 
there wasn t even anything
in here 
where was the water bed 
where that rug is 
the wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured 
  mind if i have a look 
  please 
that s not water damage 
hon  will you let me
handle this 
you re going to ruin your dress
if you go in there 
so  um  the guest room s about
15 feet in and to the right 
okay 
  just be careful 
  just hold my purse 
lorraine  are you all right 
yeah  i m fine  ed 
it s just a rat 
it s a witch s totem 
used by satanists
in their rituals 
remember how i told you that an
inhuman spirit needs to be invited 
and you couldn t imagine
how david could do that 
well  you were right 
he didn t 
we think david was cursed 
and on the night
of the exorcism 
the curse was passed
from david into arne 
cursed 
are you saying someone
did this to us    on purpose 
we ve heard of
satanic rituals like this 
the demon is summoned 
the possessed individual takes
a life and the demon departs 
which is why arne was able to
read from the bible afterwards 
yeah  we think whoever cursed
david  used this to draw the demon 
and we d like you to start
mailing these out
to every police department
you can find 
start locally 
and  just find out if they ve
ever seen anything like this 
there might be someone else
we can ask about this 
do you remember the priest
who helped expose the
disciples of the ram cult 
it would ve been about
10 or 12 years ago   
  father kastner 
  yeah  you re right 
only it isn t  father  anymore 
he s been retired for a while 
he tried to help those people 
he tried to understand
why they did what they did 
if anyone is going to be able to
tell us what this is  it s him 
father kastner 
i didn t hear the car drive in 
would either of you care
for an omelet 
we had breakfast before
we left home 
i m ed warren 
this is my wife lorraine 
i have chicken shit
on my hands 
thank you 
forget you ever saw this 
you ve seen it before 
no  but i ve seen ones like it 
this is sophisticated 
it s a very nasty piece of work 
what i don t understand is   
is why 
david  the little boy who was
possessed  he didn t do anything wrong 
why would someone
target this family 
why 
the  why  is irrelevant 
the  why  is counter to everything
that the satanist stands for 
his sole aim is chaos 
his nectar is despair 
but someone had to
put it under their house 
so  what does this tell you
about the person who made it 
come with me 
i don t want to go down there 
what is this 
it s the reason you re here 
i collected these while i was
studying the disciples of the ram 
  you should burn all this 
  i ve thought of it 
but i felt it was safer
to keep them locked 
i like taking guns
off the streets 
i don t suppose you have
all these books organized
using the dewey decimal system 
do you 
no  no  no  i do not 
the clues you seek could
be anywhere  or  they   
or  they may not be here
at all 
ed  don t 
i studied
these people for nine years 
they worshipped satan and his
demons with blood sacrifice 
they defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals 
and they committed acts of blasphemy   
which i shall never speak of 
but    these acts gave
them power 
the trial of the disciples 
the lead prosecutor 
his wife was pregnant 
a few days after the disciples
were all found guilty 
his baby was born
six weeks early 
with its heart
outside of its body 
three months later 
his wife committed suicide
by laying her neck
on a railroad track 
a master satanist is not an
adversary to be taken lightly 
we know the dangers 
better than you might think 
this boy  who s headed
to the death chamber   
is saving him worth
everything you have 
because that s what it may
very well cost 
so  you gonna clean it up 
or what 
i m sorry 
what 
  color me
your color  darling  
  i know who you are  
  come up off
your color chart  
  i know where
you re coming from  
  i know who you are  
it was here 
i swear to god  it was here 
look what the perron family
sent 
oh  that was sweet of them 
  i got it 
  ed  let me 
it s okay  it s okay 
it s okay 
  hello 
  ed 
we ve got a bite 
i just got off the phone with a
homicide detective in danvers 
he wants to talk to you guys 
he says he says he s seen it 
katie lincoln and jessica strong
went missing about four months ago 
they were best friends
in high school 
katie s body was found
near here  stabbed 22 times 
we still haven t found jessica 
but when we searched her home
back in may   
we found this 
so  you re the experts 
what can you tell me
about this 
well  to be honest  not much 
only that if this totem works the
same way as the one in brookfield 
it s possible that your
missing girl was possessed 
look  i ve read all about what you
two think happened in brookfield 
but i m only interested in leads
that are grounded in reality 
good  so are we 
we were actually hoping there might
be something in this case file
that might help prove
arne s story 
no  no  no 
i brought you here to help me 
not the other way around 
now  we ve been looking
for a link to some sort of
satanic cult ever since
we found that thing 
and these devil worshippers 
they re just people 
crazy  evil people 
but  people 
maybe we can help each other 
we need to see your casefile   
and you need to find
the missing girl 
so  give us a chance 
  to do what exactly 
  to find jessica 
we ve been combing through these forests
for over three months now  mrs  warren 
i can see things that
your people can t 
one of these is the knife used
on katie lincoln 
the others i just pulled
from the evidence locker 
and what  you want her to pick
out the murder weapon 
mmm hmm 
i ll take you out there 
but first i want to see what she can do 
absolutely not  my wife s gift
is not a sideshow attraction 
if she is what you say she is 
then this shouldn t be a problem 
mr  warren  right 
  no way  forget it  we   
  it s this one 
it was a one in three chance 
this song s appropriate 
you know  i actually met
elvis once 
  oh  yeah 
  mmm hmm 
  was that before or after he died 
  before   
and after 
you missed a turn 
the spot where you found katie s
body  it was back that way 
they re in danvers 
right now 
if they can find some way to
connect what happened there to
what happened to you  then   
you know  it s   
it s a pattern 
they might even find out
who did this 
okay  well  that sounds great 
right 
  it s great 
  baby   
what s going on 
nothing 
i m fine 
i m tired  you know   
come on 
you re keeping something
from me 
don t you think
i can tell that 
look  i m fine  totally fine 
it s cold in here 
yeah  right 
it s like  they re trying to freeze us
out  or something 
i remember what it felt like 
you re always cold 
and you re never alone 
david  what are you
talking about 
that s why you can t sleep 
because it s never quiet in your head 
sometimes you think something 
then you re not sure
if it was really you 
but now you re seeing it 
it s here with you 
and it s telling you to do things 
arne  what is it telling
you to do 
you sure you should be tromping
through the woods like this 
yeah  i m fine 
then what are
you worried about 
afraid she won t be
able to do it 
no 
i m afraid that she will 
ed  something terrible
happened here 
katie  wait up 
hey 
i got you something 
they were selling them
at the may festival this year 
your parents still dragging you
up there for that 
every year  since i was six 
it s dumb  but 
i thought this was cool 
it reminded me of the ones
we made in high school 
will you help me put it on 
sure 
all right  that s enough 
hon  that s enough 
that s enough  come on 
katie  katie  oh  my god 
what did i do 
hon  no 
lorraine 
lorraine 
lorraine 
ed 
no 
it s okay  i got you 
i got you 
she s down there 
ed  she s down there 
blood pressure s
a little high 
i m gonna give you
a vasodilator 
it s a pill  you re gonna
put it under your tongue 
it ll open up
your blood vessels 
yeah  i have those 
i left them at home 
yeah  well 
i wouldn t do that anymore if i were you 
mind giving us a minute 
recovery team found a body 
  is it   
  we re not sure 
look  i know what
it looks like 
but  i don t want any of this getting
out until we have a positive id
from the coroner 
you know  we dragged
this basin  twice 
had to pull teeth to get
it done a third time 
we never would ve done it
if it weren t for you 
i m just glad we could help 
let me know where
you re staying 
and i ll get that casefile
to you in the morning 
hello 
oh  my god  i ve been leaving
messages all day 
  what s wrong 
  it s arne  it followed him 
you said this was over 
but now he s trapped in there with
this thing and it s telling him
  to kill himself 
  debbie 
just calm down and listen to me  i need
you to call the prison chaplain  um   
  father newman 
  father newman  tell him that
arne needs to be put on a 24 hour
suicide watch  he s got   
what  hello 
what is this thing 
arne 
god gives everyone the right
to defend themselves 
this demon   
it s not here of its own
free will  it was summoned 
that doesn t make me feel
any better 
that means  we know that this
is a curse 
and curses can be broken 
all right 
then  how do we do that 
back at the glatzel house 
i touched david s hand
and i saw something 
i didn t know what it was then 
but i think that i was connected to
the person who is responsible for this 
ed  that body they found   
if it s jessica 
if it s really her 
then that connection
could still be open 
there s gotta be another way 
okay    okay 
okay 
the lord is my shepherd 
there is nothing i shall want 
he maketh me to lie down in
green pastures   
there s nobody there 
we ll leave a note 
oh  boy 
please be careful 
do you see anything 
no  there s nothing 
there s nothing here 
i m not sensing it 
  lorraine  what is it 
  the connection 
it s here 
do you see anything 
yes 
yes  there are    some stairs 
i heard a train 
but now   
there s an altar 
all those black candles 
there s 12 of them 
in a circle 
oh  ed 
okay  that s enough 
come back 
i can t 
lorraine 
it s a woman 
can you see her 
i am her 
can you tell where she is 
i don t know  i   
she s doing it again 
she s reaching out to arne 
she s trying to complete
the curse 
oh  she has him 
she has arne 
oh  no  no 
no  no  oh  god 
end this black sabbath 
by the blood of calvary
i command it 
i got a cutter  c 19 
come on  kid 
how are you doing this 
god has shown you to me 
then your god has damned you 
ed  the connection
works both ways 
lorraine 
you need to come back 
lorr   
lorraine 
you need to break
the connection 
drop her hand 
lorraine  let go of her hand 
ed   
she knows who we are 
we are so sorry 
oh  we re so sorry 
how s arne 
he ll be all right 
they got him sedated 
we got the casefile 
there s got to be something here that
connects these girls back to him 
that s great 
i got something
to show you  too 
i found it in the stregheria 
it s early renaissance 
the church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft 
now   
my latin is rusty  but   
i think this   
is talking about
a human sacrifice 
one by murder
and the other by suicide 
does it say how to stop it 
yeah  it looks like   
you can break the curse by destroying
the altar it was cast from 
but   
this part looks like aramaic 
this next part 
i can t read it 
but you stopped her 
maybe she ll give up now 
she can t 
once started  the curse
must be completed 
her soul depends on it 
we ll find another way 
was there anything
in your vision
that might help us
find her altar 
it was cold 
there was water dripping
from the ceiling 
i think i heard a train 
but it sounded strange somehow 
like  um   
i don t know  muffled 
well  maybe it was underground 
could be  i don t know where 
this woman targeted
david and jessica 
maybe there s
a connection there 
let me take a look at the   
take a look at the   
file 
lorraine 
lorraine 
lorraine 
where is she 
you know  the two of you have
gathered quite the collection 
if you hurt her   
oh  don t worry  mr  warren 
you re so close 
i d hate for you
to give up now 
he who calls forth the water of the sea 
the lord of hosts is his name 
deliver thy servant
from all the workings
of unclean spirits 
fear and flee  unclean spirit 
ed 
ed 
i m sorry 
ed  it was her 
it was her 
  ed  what the hell is going on 
  help me find it 
find what 
where is it 
ed 
ed 
she was here 
she was in our house 
when did these get here 
they just arrived yesterday
while you guys
were driving home 
they were fresh
when they got here 
we have
to find this woman 
we ve identified the curse
and now we have
jessica s casefile 
there has to be
something in here 
okay  i m gonna take the book
to be translated 
there has to be a clue about
where we can find the altar 
so what do we do 
you should go be with arne 
he s gonna need you tonight
more than ever 
ask father newman for help 
drew  you and me are gonna
tear into those files 
we ve got to find a link
between these cases 
and a satanist s power
is strongest at night  so   
let s hope she doesn t
try anything before then 
they ve stopped his sedation 
he ll be coming around soon 
there s nothing
in these interviews 
her friends barely saw her
after she got back from college 
didn t that
seem strange to you 
i mean  we re here 
the glatzels live here 
just 15 minutes away 
but jessica lived
180 miles from here 
why is this one so far away 
hey  where did jessica
find her totem 
i just saw something
about that 
it was in an interview
with her parents 
it was in a box 
 she brought it back home
in a box from college  
where d she go to college 
fairfield 
this woman lives in the area 
still a lot of ground to cover 
yeah  but not
a lot of train tracks 
remember lorraine s vision 
she said she heard a train 
what time was it 
maybe we can start
eliminating some of these 
probably
close to midnight 
then it can t be
either of these two 
the commuter lines
don t run that late 
that just leaves
this freight line
that crosses the river here 
the river 
oh  dear god 
mrs  warren 
i m sorry  father 
we tried calling 
but we couldn t reach you 
we were hoping you d help us
translate a passage from this book 
of course  come in 
thank you 
give me your keys 
you stay here  call the police 
what do you want me
to tell them 
anything 
just get  em out there 
it s the curse 
it says  the curse needs three
victims to be complete 
it refers to them as   
 the child  the lover
and the man of god  
the embodiment of god s work 
purity  love  faith 
has there been another 
it s ed  it s my husband 
last night we found a totem
in his office 
that is unfortunate 
here  come with me 
there s something
i need to show you 
father 
i ve been here many years   
starting when i was a priest 
the church
used this mill for storage 
it s where they put the things
that they were afraid of 
things they didn t understand 
you had a child 
her mother died in childbirth 
the church couldn t know 
so i raised her here 
in secret 
it was just the two of us 
our happiness
filled this house 
i continued my studies
into the occult 
i wanted to protect her
from all this 
instead i created
a fascination 
we must be careful
how our obsessions are passed
to our children 
 he who dwells in the shelter
of the most high
will rest in the shadow
of the almighty 
i will say of the lord 
 he is my refuge
and my fortress 
my god  in whom i trust   
it s just the wiring 
you know  state building 
debbie 
arne 
what is it 
she s    she s close 
you knew 
we came to you for help
and you knew this whole time 
she s my daughter 
i couldn t   
i didn t want to see 
after all these years 
i thought she d come back
to me again 
and now i know
the real reason she s here 
there are tunnels
under this land 
she would explore them
as a child 
her altar must be down there 
it s the only thing
that can break her curse 
we need to destroy it 
she s here 
go 
i failed as a priest 
and i failed as a father 
please  god 
don t let me fail
