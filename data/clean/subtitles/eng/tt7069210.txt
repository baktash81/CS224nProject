okay bruno go nightnight
no not until we dance
yes no were not dancing
one dance one dance
i dont want to dance bruno
okay one dance
this is officer thomas
my name is lorraine warren
i know how this is
going to sound
but theres going to be a tragedy
at the brookfield boarding kennels
debbie
arne
bruno
no stop
arne
bruno stop
arne help me
arne whoa what is going on
what are you doing
arne please stop it
baby
what the hell
no stop
hey
you okay there
hey
you okay
now you just stay right there okay
dont move
i think i hurt someone
this is sergeant thomas
i have one victim down
multiple stab wounds
residents of brookfield
were shocked this afternoon
by the broad daylight murder
of bruno sauls
sauls the manager
of a local dog kennel
was stabbed 22 times
this is the first murder in
that towns 193year history
who shall ascend
into the hill of the lord
or who shall stand
in his holy place
he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity
nor sworn deceitfully
he shall receive the blessing
from the lord
and righteousness from the god
of his salvation
right thats enough
thank you
well
these religious objects
wouldve been enough
to provoke an inhuman spirit
if there was one present
does that mean
hes not possessed
the fact that he can read
from the bible just seals it
so what does this mean
then
im just crazy
well youre not possessed
but that doesnt mean
that you werent
i invited this
thing into me
and thats the reason
that hes dead
so you know
whatever happens to me
ive got it coming
no you dont
look
i was there
whatever is going on
whatever happened that day
that was not arne
were going to help you
in every way that we can
if the demons gone
what can you do now
whos your lawyer
he was found covered
in the victims blood
the murder weapon belongs to him and
its got his fingerprints all over it
nobodys disputing any of that
arne knows that hes going to prison
all were saying is that there
were mitigating circumstances
mitigating circumstances
look i dont think he should
get the death sentence either
but i am not going
before a grand jury
and saying he was possessed
by demons
its never been done
yes it has its been done
twice in england
the michael taylor case
was just a few years ago
let me rephrase that
its never been done successfully
then let us help you
ed and i have proven the existence
of the demonic hundreds of times
youve proven it to the church
this is a court of law
the standards of evidence
are completely different
the courts accepts
the existence of god
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth
i think its about time they
accept the existence of the devil
how are you going
to convince a jury
if you cant even convince me
ill tell you what
you come over to our house for dinner
well show you the evidence
weve collected over the years
introduce you to annabelle
if youre not convinced
well butt out
deal
all right
show me what you got
mr johnson to count one of
indictment number saj1216
which charges you with
firstdegree murder
a classa felony
how do you plead
your honor
my client pleads not guilty
by reason of
demonic possession
this is ridiculous
i can walk down a flight of stairs
oh hush you shouldnt
even be out of bed
lorraine
i just talked to a friend of
mine in the prosecutors office
hes gonna go for
the death penalty
ill build the case
but that kid is gonna either live or die
depending on what you two find
well we wont let him down
i hope not
keep me posted
so what now
weve never had to prove
a possession after the fact
demons dont just
disappear like this
theres something else
going on here
something that we missed
the first time
where do we start
at the beginning
its july 18th 1981
this is ed warren
here with lorraine
and judy glatzel
deborah glatzel
david glatzel
and arne johnson
all right lets get started
who was there when david first
started exhibiting this behavior
we all were
it was the day we moved in
there you go
go have fun with them
wanna order some pizza
yeah sure ill do that right now
hey
put that box down a second
why
i just
what are you doing
have a look
what is arne
you know youre supposed to
do this when you get married
okay so maybe
well do that too
oh
no
mom
i didnt know
what happened
it was like a dream
and nobody believed me
when i told them
but that was the first time
i saw it
i dont get it
how could he have invited a demon
he was only in here for a few minutes
there wasnt even anything
in here
where was the water bed
where that rug is
the wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured
mind if i have a look
please
thats not water damage
hon will you let me
handle this
youre going to ruin your dress
if you go in there
so um the guest rooms about
15 feet in and to the right
okay
just be careful
just hold my purse
lorraine are you all right
yeah im fine ed
its just a rat
its a witchs totem
used by satanists
in their rituals
remember how i told you that an
inhuman spirit needs to be invited
and you couldnt imagine
how david could do that
well you were right
he didnt
we think david was cursed
and on the night
of the exorcism
the curse was passed
from david into arne
cursed
are you saying someone
did this to us on purpose
weve heard of
satanic rituals like this
the demon is summoned
the possessed individual takes
a life and the demon departs
which is why arne was able to
read from the bible afterwards
yeah we think whoever cursed
david used this to draw the demon
and wed like you to start
mailing these out
to every police department
you can find
start locally
and just find out if theyve
ever seen anything like this
there might be someone else
we can ask about this
do you remember the priest
who helped expose the
disciples of the ram cult
it wouldve been about
10 or 12 years ago
father kastner
yeah youre right
only it isnt father anymore
hes been retired for a while
he tried to help those people
he tried to understand
why they did what they did
if anyone is going to be able to
tell us what this is its him
father kastner
i didnt hear the car drive in
would either of you care
for an omelet
we had breakfast before
we left home
im ed warren
this is my wife lorraine
i have chicken shit
on my hands
thank you
forget you ever saw this
youve seen it before
no but ive seen ones like it
this is sophisticated
its a very nasty piece of work
what i dont understand is
is why
david the little boy who was
possessed he didnt do anything wrong
why would someone
target this family
why
the why is irrelevant
the why is counter to everything
that the satanist stands for
his sole aim is chaos
his nectar is despair
but someone had to
put it under their house
so what does this tell you
about the person who made it
come with me
i dont want to go down there
what is this
its the reason youre here
i collected these while i was
studying the disciples of the ram
you should burn all this
ive thought of it
but i felt it was safer
to keep them locked
i like taking guns
off the streets
i dont suppose you have
all these books organized
using the dewey decimal system
do you
no no no i do not
the clues you seek could
be anywhere or they
or they may not be here
at all
ed dont
i studied
these people for nine years
they worshipped satan and his
demons with blood sacrifice
they defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals
and they committed acts of blasphemy
which i shall never speak of
but these acts gave
them power
the trial of the disciples
the lead prosecutor
his wife was pregnant
a few days after the disciples
were all found guilty
his baby was born
six weeks early
with its heart
outside of its body
three months later
his wife committed suicide
by laying her neck
on a railroad track
a master satanist is not an
adversary to be taken lightly
we know the dangers
better than you might think
this boy whos headed
to the death chamber
is saving him worth
everything you have
because thats what it may
very well cost
so you gonna clean it up
or what
im sorry
what
color me
your color darling
i know who you are
come up off
your color chart
i know where
youre coming from
i know who you are
it was here
i swear to god it was here
look what the perron family
sent
oh that was sweet of them
i got it
ed let me
its okay its okay
its okay
hello
ed
weve got a bite
i just got off the phone with a
homicide detective in danvers
he wants to talk to you guys
he says he says hes seen it
katie lincoln and jessica strong
went missing about four months ago
they were best friends
in high school
katies body was found
near here stabbed 22 times
we still havent found jessica
but when we searched her home
back in may
we found this
so youre the experts
what can you tell me
about this
well to be honest not much
only that if this totem works the
same way as the one in brookfield
its possible that your
missing girl was possessed
look ive read all about what you
two think happened in brookfield
but im only interested in leads
that are grounded in reality
good so are we
we were actually hoping there might
be something in this case file
that might help prove
arnes story
no no no
i brought you here to help me
not the other way around
now weve been looking
for a link to some sort of
satanic cult ever since
we found that thing
and these devilworshippers
theyre just people
crazy evil people
but people
maybe we can help each other
we need to see your casefile
and you need to find
the missing girl
so give us a chance
to do what exactly
to find jessica
weve been combing through these forests
for over three months now mrs warren
i can see things that
your people cant
one of these is the knife used
on katie lincoln
the others i just pulled
from the evidence locker
and what you want her to pick
out the murder weapon
mmmhmm
ill take you out there
but first i want to see what she can do
absolutely not my wifes gift
is not a sideshow attraction
if she is what you say she is
then this shouldnt be a problem
mr warren right
no way forget it we
its this one
it was a oneinthree chance
this songs appropriate
you know i actually met
elvis once
oh yeah
mmmhmm
was that before or after he died
before
and after
you missed a turn
the spot where you found katies
body it was back that way
theyre in danvers
right now
if they can find some way to
connect what happened there to
what happened to you then
you know its
its a pattern
they might even find out
who did this
okay well that sounds great
right
its great
baby
whats going on
nothing
im fine
im tired you know
come on
youre keeping something
from me
dont you think
i can tell that
look im fine totally fine
its cold in here
yeah right
its like theyre trying to freeze us
out or something
i remember what it felt like
youre always cold
and youre never alone
david what are you
talking about
thats why you cant sleep
because its never quiet in your head
sometimes you think something
then youre not sure
if it was really you
but now youre seeing it
its here with you
and its telling you to do things
arne what is it telling
you to do
you sure you should be tromping
through the woods like this
yeah im fine
then what are
you worried about
afraid she wont be
able to do it
no
im afraid that she will
ed something terrible
happened here
katie wait up
hey
i got you something
they were selling them
at the may festival this year
your parents still dragging you
up there for that
every year since i was six
its dumb but
i thought this was cool
it reminded me of the ones
we made in high school
will you help me put it on
sure
all right thats enough
hon thats enough
thats enough come on
katie katie oh my god
what did i do
hon no
lorraine
lorraine
lorraine
ed
no
its okay i got you
i got you
shes down there
ed shes down there
blood pressures
a little high
im gonna give you
a vasodilator
its a pill youre gonna
put it under your tongue
itll open up
your blood vessels
yeah i have those
i left them at home
yeah well
i wouldnt do that anymore if i were you
mind giving us a minute
recovery team found a body
is it
were not sure
look i know what
it looks like
but i dont want any of this getting
out until we have a positive id
from the coroner
you know we dragged
this basin twice
had to pull teeth to get
it done a third time
we never wouldve done it
if it werent for you
im just glad we could help
let me know where
youre staying
and ill get that casefile
to you in the morning
hello
oh my god ive been leaving
messages all day
whats wrong
its arne it followed him
you said this was over
but now hes trapped in there with
this thing and its telling him
to kill himself
debbie
just calm down and listen to me i need
you to call the prison chaplain um
father newman
father newman tell him that
arne needs to be put on a 24hour
suicide watch hes got
what hello
what is this thing
arne
god gives everyone the right
to defend themselves
this demon
its not here of its own
free will it was summoned
that doesnt make me feel
any better
that means we know that this
is a curse
and curses can be broken
all right
then how do we do that
back at the glatzel house
i touched davids hand
and i saw something
i didnt know what it was then
but i think that i was connected to
the person who is responsible for this
ed that body they found
if its jessica
if its really her
then that connection
could still be open
theres gotta be another way
okay okay
okay
the lord is my shepherd
there is nothing i shall want
he maketh me to lie down in
green pastures
theres nobody there
well leave a note
oh boy
please be careful
do you see anything
no theres nothing
theres nothing here
im not sensing it
lorraine what is it
the connection
its here
do you see anything
yes
yes there are some stairs
i heard a train
but now
theres an altar
all those black candles
theres 12 of them
in a circle
oh ed
okay thats enough
come back
i cant
lorraine
its a woman
can you see her
i am her
can you tell where she is
i dont know i
shes doing it again
shes reaching out to arne
shes trying to complete
the curse
oh she has him
she has arne
oh no no
no no oh god
end this black sabbath
by the blood of calvary
i command it
i got a cutter c19
come on kid
how are you doing this
god has shown you to me
then your god has damned you
ed the connection
works both ways
lorraine
you need to come back
lorr
lorraine
you need to break
the connection
drop her hand
lorraine let go of her hand
ed
she knows who we are
we are so sorry
oh were so sorry
hows arne
hell be all right
they got him sedated
we got the casefile
theres got to be something here that
connects these girls back to him
thats great
i got something
to show you too
i found it in the stregheria
its early renaissance
the church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft
now
my latin is rusty but
i think this
is talking about
a human sacrifice
one by murder
and the other by suicide
does it say how to stop it
yeah it looks like
you can break the curse by destroying
the altar it was cast from
but
this part looks like aramaic
this next part
i cant read it
but you stopped her
maybe shell give up now
she cant
once started the curse
must be completed
her soul depends on it
well find another way
was there anything
in your vision
that might help us
find her altar
it was cold
there was water dripping
from the ceiling
i think i heard a train
but it sounded strange somehow
like um
i dont know muffled
well maybe it was underground
could be i dont know where
this woman targeted
david and jessica
maybe theres
a connection there
let me take a look at the
take a look at the
file
lorraine
lorraine
lorraine
where is she
you know the two of you have
gathered quite the collection
if you hurt her
oh dont worry mr warren
youre so close
id hate for you
to give up now
he who calls forth the water of the sea
the lord of hosts is his name
deliver thy servant
from all the workings
of unclean spirits
fear and flee unclean spirit
ed
ed
im sorry
ed it was her
it was her
ed what the hell is going on
help me find it
find what
where is it
ed
ed
she was here
she was in our house
when did these get here
they just arrived yesterday
while you guys
were driving home
they were fresh
when they got here
we have
to find this woman
weve identified the curse
and now we have
jessicas casefile
there has to be
something in here
okay im gonna take the book
to be translated
there has to be a clue about
where we can find the altar
so what do we do
you should go be with arne
hes gonna need you tonight
more than ever
ask father newman for help
drew you and me are gonna
tear into those files
weve got to find a link
between these cases
and a satanists power
is strongest at night so
lets hope she doesnt
try anything before then
theyve stopped his sedation
hell be coming around soon
theres nothing
in these interviews
her friends barely saw her
after she got back from college
didnt that
seem strange to you
i mean were here
the glatzels live here
just 15 minutes away
but jessica lived
180 miles from here
why is this one so far away
hey where did jessica
find her totem
i just saw something
about that
it was in an interview
with her parents
it was in a box
she brought it back home
in a box from college
whered she go to college
fairfield
this woman lives in the area
still a lot of ground to cover
yeah but not
a lot of train tracks
remember lorraines vision
she said she heard a train
what time was it
maybe we can start
eliminating some of these
probably
close to midnight
then it cant be
either of these two
the commuter lines
dont run that late
that just leaves
this freight line
that crosses the river here
the river
oh dear god
mrs warren
im sorry father
we tried calling
but we couldnt reach you
we were hoping youd help us
translate a passage from this book
of course come in
thank you
give me your keys
you stay here call the police
what do you want me
to tell them
anything
just get em out there
its the curse
it says the curse needs three
victims to be complete
it refers to them as
the child the lover
and the man of god
the embodiment of gods work
purity love faith
has there been another
its ed its my husband
last night we found a totem
in his office
that is unfortunate
here come with me
theres something
i need to show you
father
ive been here many years
starting when i was a priest
the church
used this mill for storage
its where they put the things
that they were afraid of
things they didnt understand
you had a child
her mother died in childbirth
the church couldnt know
so i raised her here
in secret
it was just the two of us
our happiness
filled this house
i continued my studies
into the occult
i wanted to protect her
from all this
instead i created
a fascination
we must be careful
how our obsessions are passed
to our children
he who dwells in the shelter
of the most high
will rest in the shadow
of the almighty
i will say of the lord
he is my refuge
and my fortress
my god in whom i trust
its just the wiring
you know state building
debbie
arne
what is it
shes shes close
you knew
we came to you for help
and you knew this whole time
shes my daughter
i couldnt
i didnt want to see
after all these years
i thought shed come back
to me again
and now i know
the real reason shes here
there are tunnels
