band leader  everyone okay 
boy 2  sorry 
band leader 
let s go from where we left off 
leo  that morning was the first time
i ever saw her 
but before we talk about her 
i have to tell you something about me 
and i m sorry i have to tell you 
but i do 
when i was a kid  my dad died 
i know it s sad  but it s true 
and it happened 
and it s something
you need to know about me 
but here s the good news 
when he was alive  he was the best 
he was funny and silly and   
he had this amazing porcupine tie
he used to wear all the time 
and when he died 
my mom let me wear it to his funeral 
and after that 
i wore it pretty much every day 
fighting dinosaurs  tie 
eating sugar pops  tie 
oh  man  those were so good 
here i am playing the trumpet 
wearing the tie 
and on moving day  you guessed it  tie 
we were moving to mica  arizona 
my mom said she got a good job there
and that it was quiet and far away 
she said we could start fresh 
just the two of us 
but guess what 
mica was quieter
than i ever could ve imagined 
nothing ever happened here 
like  zero things 
it was a town that felt like
something was missing 
and they wanted to win 
  they just couldn t 
   impact grunt 
there were no trophies 
no celebrations  no stories 
because it had been that way for so long 
it just felt normal 
and as the new kid  that meant i became
the center of attention real fast 
and not in a good way 
and right then  i knew 
if i wanted to survive 
it was better to lay low 
i was gonna have to be
just like everybody else 
gloria  leo 
leo  no one would see me 
no one would hear me 
i was gonna disappear 
and then  on my ninth birthday   
and every birthday after that   
boom  another tie 
and another  and another 
look at these boxes  they re amazing 
hey  it s a trumpet 
i had no idea who they were from 
but whoever it was  they made sure
that for one moment  every year 
i couldn t forget who i was 
happy birthday  kid 
  thank you 
  be safe 
leo  and that brings us back
to where we started 
back to my 16th birthday 
back to the first time i saw her

more questions than answers

zack james with the 65 yard run

leo  until that night 
i had always thought
mud frogs were an odd choice for a mascot 
you see  mud frogs spend
most of their time sleeping 
they sleep at the bottom of dry ponds
in the desert  buried in mud for months 
they do this
when there s no food or water 
and then  one day  the rain comes 
and just like that  they re awake 
we were the mud frogs 
and we always had been 
we were just waiting for it to rain 
did you ask her  about hot seat 
oh  uh   
yeah  no  i asked her last week 
she said she doesn t wanna do it 
you asked her last week
and you never told me 
there was a lot going on 
did you really ask her 
when she said no  what did you say 
did you tell her how important it is 
  tell her about the throne of flames

with my mom  too 
we travel a lot 
she does costumes for plays 
and she s always talking about
how she wants to sell the house
and live on the road 
but i told her i wanted to go
to a real school

 leo chuckles 
i start at my toes 
till everything from my neck down is gone 
and then comes the hard part  my senses 
my nose  my ears  my eyes  my mouth 
if i ve done a good job at the end 
there s just nothing 
and then i see and i hear 
but not with my eyes and ears 
 cause they re gone obviously 
now that i m nothing 
there s no difference between me
and everything else 
i m a stone 
i m a paper cup 
i m rain 
 raindrops pattering 
 raining

 both laughing 
 both continue laughing

to betray her own school

on hot seat 
 dramatic music plays 
 music stops 
so  before we get into more recent events 
let s start at the beginning 
  is your name really stargirl 
  yes 
  so you were born stargirl caraway 
  oh  no 
 soft chuckle  come on 
you know you can t lie on hot seat 
i m not lying  my name really is stargirl 
it s just not the name i was born with 
okay  what name were you born with 
susan 
so then why stargirl 
we re made from the dust of dead stars 
   audience laughs softly 
  kevin  okay  let s turn up the heat 
um   
what brought you to mica high
in the first place 
  i understand you were homeschooled 
  i was 
stargirl  um    i   
camera two  go in close on stargirl 
kevin  yes 
i just wanted to make some friends 
  you have a weird way of showing it 
  come on  you know how this show works 
save your comments and questions
for later 
uh  okay  so i understand that you
came on here today because
you wanted to set the record straight
about what happened at friday s big game 
tell us  why d you do it 
he was hurt and he was alone 
  he was on the other team 
  and he was killing us 
  guys  seriously 
  he needed help 
there s coaches and medics for that 
he didn t wanna let go of my hand 
what makes you think
you know what everybody wants 
 crowd murmurs 
i    i don t think i   
you re right  you don t think 
everybody else seems to be able to 
but then you re not like everybody else 
you do all these nice things for people
that are really just selfish 
like the bike you left my brother 
i went to the thrift store
and asked them who bought it
and when they started to describe you 
i knew who they meant 
did you even know why the bike was there 
did it ever occur to you to find out 
i think that s all the time we have   
go on  hillary 
hillary  my mom didn t think
he was ready for a bike 
but my dad insisted 
after the accident 
my dad took it to the thrift store hoping
someone could at least use it  right 
then it shows up on our doorstep 
did you know my brother got so badly hurt
that he ll never ride a bike again 
my parents didn t know
who would do something like that 
so i went to the thrift store 
and  yeah  here we are 
 indistinct murmuring 
 exhales 
mr  robineau  okay  everyone 
it s time to go home 
 leo sighs 
girl  it got really hot 
leo  stargirl  please wait 
we can fix this 
there has to be a way to fix this 
some things just take time 
or maybe you don t have to do
all the things that you do 
what do you mean 
leo  you could just hang out 
like  when it s just us 
so you can go back to blending in 
  this isn t about me 
  it s not 
you were the one
that said you wanted to make friends 
  i do 
  then listen to them 
why can t you just be
more like everybody else 
is that what you want 
i don t know 
but i think you d be happy 
i think we could be happy 
stargirl 
stargirl  come on  i ll drive you home 
i d rather walk 
it s getting dark 
i know 
 cell phone vibrates 
 cell phone vibrates 
stargirl 
 text message alert 
 chuckles 
do you still wanna go with me later 
  to tucson 
  yeah 
yeah  of course  i do  susan 
 song playing on radio 
did you change your speech 
what 
oh  uh   
yeah 
what s the topic 
um  whether or not the government
should be involved in internet censorship 
mr  robineau  interesting choice 
well  what happened to   
it was too weird 
 text message alert 
 text message alert 
 applause 
we often ask ourselves
how much involvement
the government should have in our affairs 
especially how it pertains
to how we obtain information 
 cell phone ringing 
 shushing 
 indistinct 
 crowd murmuring 
 exhales 
i don t know why i was giving that speech 
i don t know
why i do a lot of things lately 
i bet you find that  too  right 
 chuckles 
and it s because we don t think 
we just do 
we don t take a step back and process 
everything s so instant these days 
how can we 
dinner in minutes 
a thousand photographs in one burst 
you have to  like  something this second 
you have to know
how you feel about everything 
you can t be unsure
or confused or change your mind 
there s no time to figure out who you are 
you have to know right now 
have you ever seen a flower grow 
i mean  of course not 
it s nearly impossible
to wait for anything that takes that long 
but  if you did  it would change you 
it would slow you down 
it would remind you
that real things take time 
and it s magic  too  isn t it 
i mean  so are 1 000 photographs
in one burst 
but a flower 
you plant a seed in the ground
and a whole world develops
and stretches out and opens up 
it s easy to get confused
when we re moving so fast 
and to think we re doing the right thing
when really we re not 
but if we re lucky 
we could find a balance 
we could take a step back 
we could take a breath 
next time you see a flower sticking up
out of the ground or in a vase 
just remember
that part of what makes it beautiful
is how long it took to grow 
 crowd cheering 
well done  miss caraway  well done indeed 
 bell rings 
teacher  guys  don t forget 
chapters six and seven for tomorrow 
you never know what might be coming up 
 indistinct chatter 
we ll make an announcement
tomorrow morning 
hey 
i m really proud of you 
i m sorry 
for what 
well  i mean 
maybe it was silly  but i   
i guess i thought maybe some of them
would be happy you won 
people aren t happy because they win 
they win  cause they re happy 
susan  i   
were you even listening 
  to what 
  my speech 
of course 
that was stargirl 
i m stargirl 
susan didn t win that trophy  i did 
but you were talking about balance and   
i know that you think
that this would make it easier 
but i can t just be somebody else 
but you re susan  you are 
that s your name 
you re off the hook for the dance 
by the way 
you can t go with someone
who doesn t exist 
 cell phone ringing 
  hey 
  kevin  hey 
i didn t see you at school 
uh  yeah  i was in and out pretty quickly 
it s cool she won 
you don t really think that 
i do  for real 
well  then you are the only one 
so  uh  i was  um   
i was thinking about the first day we met 
  i got to school  late  of course 
   chuckles 
and the playground was completely empty
except for this kid lying in the middle 
 chuckles 
i thought you were dead 
i don t know 
maybe that s all she was doing 
maybe she was just helping someone
get back up 
i know we haven t talked since the  um   
i m sorry about the show 
are you kidding me 
i m a legend 
it s all anyone s talking about 
that s probably the best thing
that s ever happened to me 
  good night  kevin 
  later 
gloria  this came for you 
is it from her 
stargirl 
oh  man 
the cars 
were you ever afraid
of what people thought of you
when you were my age 
like  to the point where
you did things you wish you didn t do 
you just describing a teenager 
 both chuckle 
your dad
was one of the only people i ever knew
who was always completely himself 
do you still  um   
do you still miss him 
 voice breaking  every day 
i mean  not all day  every day 
but definitely every day 
i don t ever wanna stop missing him 
i don t either 
when we moved here after he died 
it was the first time
i really had to think about who i was 
your dad was such a big personality
and he just   
he took up so much
space 
and even though it was painful 
i finally had to figure out
who i wanted to be 
   gloria sniffles 
  did you 
 gloria chuckles 
well  i know more now than i did then 
i mean  of course 
i just wanna tell you everything 
i wanna give you all the answers 
but those are my answers 
figuring out who we are is probably
the one thing no one else can do for us 
 laughs 
i think i still have some
of your dad s old records in the garage 
should we go look 
 gloria laughs 
 singing 
everybody s always obsessin 
 bout what everybody thinks about them
but i don t wanna be like them  no
i just wanna dance  dance
don t wanna think about nothin 
just keep the stereo pumpin  and dance
i just wanna dance  dance
don t wanna think about nothin 
just put on somethin 
that s bumpin  and dance
with my eyes wide open
 indistinct conversations 
i can escape
whoa oh oh
i m wakin  up
i m wakin  up while i m sleepin 
i m wakin  up  i m wakin  up
while i m sleepin 
hi 
nice tie 
um  you look    you look  um   
  thanks  leo 
  you re welcome  stargirl 
are you ready for your surprise 
i have no idea 
we have a special request
for this next song
and a special guest
to sing it with us  leo borlock 
 crowd murmuring 
  what 
  girl  leo 
you got this 
boy  leo s gonna sing 
i don t know what song you re doing 
singer  yeah  you do  you know  the cars 
by the way  killer tie  man 
 music playing 
sorry  sorry 
 music continues playing 
 inaudible 
 singing 
i don t mind you comin  here
and wastin  all my time
 cause when you re standin   oh  so near
i kinda lose my mind
 faint cheering 
it s not the perfume that you wear
it s not the ribbons in your hair
and i don t mind you comin  here
and wastin  all my time
i don t mind you hangin  out
and talkin  in your sleep
it doesn t matter where you ve been
as long as it was deep  yeah
you always knew to wear it well
and you look so fancy  i can tell
and i don t mind you hangin  out
and talking in your sleep
i guess you re just what i needed
i needed someone to feed
i guess you re just what i needed
just what i needed
i needed someone to bleed
yeah 
i never said i was sorry 
i m really sorry 
 crowd murmuring 
leo  and just like that  she was gone 
her mom sold the house 
i imagine they were on the road somewhere 
but even though she was gone 
she was everywhere 
 indistinct 
leo  but i still didn t know 
was it real 
or was it something else 
archie  dinosaurs can kind of do a number
on your brain  can t they 
leo  what 
archie  they seem magical 
these enormous beasts 
roaming some mystical place 
but they were real 
and they were here 
look at this bone 
now there is nothing more real than that 
but that doesn t make it any less magical 
you think things have to be real or magic 
but the best things are both 
she asked me to show you something 
leo  and there  in her office 
i finally saw her 
all her glitter and ribbons
and magic tricks 
information found just like anyone else 
only nobody else did find it 
 cause nobody else cared to 
who cares about strangers  birthdays 
or stories about other people 
 thunder rumbling 
leo  who would take the time
for someone they don t even know 
and the time to learn and grow when
they realize they did something wrong 
and even though i couldn t find her 
she still found a way 
every now and then 
to find me 
for a while 
she was all anyone could talk about 
where did she go  why did she leave 
and why was she here in the first place 
did it all happen for a reason 
or was it just one of those things 
it got to the point
where people started to wonder
if she d been a ghost or an alien 
or maybe out of boredom 
we just made her up 
as the years went by 
the stories got more elaborate 
she played every instrument
in the marching band 
she could make flowers
appear out of thin air 
she knew what you were thinking
before you did 
one time  i even heard she could fly 
later  when those of us
who were there got together 
we would laugh about it 
laugh at how ridiculous they were 
at how some kids would believe anything 
but as the memories became stories 
and the stories became memories 
even we began to wonder 
she was just a girl  wasn t she 
 screaming 
leo  a girl just like anyone else 
it was silly to even talk about it 
after all  nothing ever happened here 
nothing at all 
 singing  give me love
give me love
give me peace on earth
give me light
give me life
keep me free from birth
give me hope  help me cope
with this heavy load
trying to touch and reach you
with heart and soul
oh  my lord please
take hold of my hand
and i might understand you
won t you please
oh  won t you
gimme love
give me love
give me peace on earth
give me light
give me life
keep me free from birth
give me hope
help me cope
with this heavy load
tryin  to touch you  tryin  to reach you
with my heart and soul
oh  my lord please
take hold of my hand
and i might understand you
won t you please
oh  won t you 
don t say maybe
just await me
we can stay here
for as long as we want
make forever last a while
leave the light on
after the song
leaves and goes to a far off ocean
lay here with me
and i ll catch you
falling into me
falling into you
letting go of all the things
i thought were true
falling into me
as i m falling into you
it seems so clear
that i don t know what to do
i speak too much
you stay closed off
but i can see
your thoughts in the stardust
shining back at me
as i catch you
falling into me
falling into you
letting go of all the things
i thought were true
falling into me as i m falling into you
it seems so clear
that i don t know what to do
one day i ll be old and ugly
will you still be thinking of me 
if we were as brave as we are now
and i ll catch you
thinking of me as i m thinking of you
letting go of all the things
i thought were true
as you re falling into me
i m falling into you
it seems so clear
