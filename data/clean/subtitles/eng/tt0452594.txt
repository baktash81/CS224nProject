but wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent
okay byebye

happy holidays
marilyn dean gallery
hold please
will you excuse me
for a moment
sure go ahead
christopher
yes sweetie
hi honey
hi
christmas was months ago
dont remind me
i miss it so much
yeah i know
but today is not a holiday
i know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone
and they dig the energy
that i give them
okay im just saying
i dont think marilyn dean
will dig the energy
oh no
shes the one that told me
to be creative so
i know its just okay
what is the next holiday
coming
the fourth of july
is that whats next
well if you want
to get technical
theres memorial day
theres flag day
some people recognize
fathers day as a holiday
i dont
i get it i get it
well on those days
you can say happy holidays
every other day
good morning good afternoon
good evening
marilyn dean gallery
okay
okay
im so sorry about that
oh no
so now this is a new piece
by zakrzewska
what do you think of this
can i be honest with you
please
other than taking
an art history class
in college
which i pretty much
slept through i dont have
the first clue about art
or how to go about buying it
i mean like that painting
i mean i dont see the point
in buying something that
i could have done myself
yeah i completely agree
with you
you know an art teacher
of mine once said
never buy a piece of art
that you dont have to have
you know dont worry
about who the artist is
or how much its worth
i mean you have to live
with it every day you have
to walk by it every day
you know you have to
really love it you have
to really appreciate it
its kind of like
picking a mate
hey honey
hi
hows it going
its good
oh wow you got
a lot happening
i know
very exciting
i am starving
oh careful thats really
thats very hot
oh thats hot hot hot
yep
jesus
hey honey
youve got to really
you should get ready okay
oh you look great
thank you
got a lot of nice stuff
got a pizza
all kinds of stuff
terrific
i just need you
to decide what to
you know i did everything
gary
yeah
oh come on really
you got three lemons
what my baby wants
my baby gets you know that
yeah but i wanted 12
baby wanted 12
why would you want 12 lemons
because im making
a 12lemon centerpiece
so no ones actually
even eating them
theyre just show lemons
yeah theyre just
show lemons shown in
the center of the table
im glad you find that
amusing
but i cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons
well
cant you just use like
maybe a drinking glass
im not gonna use
a drinking
we could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece
im not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece
you know what
ive got an idea
why dont we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it
guess what now weve made
a better meal versus something
visually nice to look at
what are you do
whats happening here
what are you doing
what are you doing
oh i had
such a long day on the bus
i need a little bit
of down time
my feet are killing me
gary come on
my feet are killing me too
im exhausted
i worked all day
went to the market
i cleaned this entire condo
and then ive been cooking
for the last three hours
come on help set the table
sweetheart
what
youve done such a great job
already dont you want
to finish it yourself
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment
set the table
listen to me
do you think that
when michelangelo right
was painting
the sixteenth chapel
that he said
hey guys you know
i did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels
but why dont you help me
design this one
and maybe
you could help me
give me a brush
and you guys can grab brushes
and we can all make a great chapel
no he didnt
and you wanna know
what the results were
a masterpiece
okay its the sistine chapel
not the sixteenth
and i bet when michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes
they didnt bring him three
yeah okay all the talking
is really starting
to drain me
and now im gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what i missed here
honey look gary just
down times important
gary please just
take a shower okay
down times important
cause this is what
i dont want to have happen
i dont want the doorbell
to ring im then forced
to answer the door
entertain people
and im still cooking dinner
yeah
okay
youre absolutely right
lets do that the second
that this innings over
gary
theres one out all ready
theyre gonna be here
in 20 minutes
baby have you ever seen
a shower of mine take
more than four minutes

to good use
this place is
so well balanced
thanks mom
yeah the energy in this place
is just amazing
yes
well the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing
if we had a pool table
gary weve already
discussed that
were gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place
the place is plenty big now
if you wanted a pool table
because
gary
yeah you could take
the dining room table
go ahead and move her
in the living room
really
plenty of room
and put a dining room table
in the living room okay
how do you
i mean what do you do
with a dining room table
eat on it
wed have no furniture
in the living
wheres the furniture go
all im saying is
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool

i completely understand
theres halls and stuff
i mean you can go
we will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place
thank you
the food is outstanding

okay everybody
time for the joke of the day
knock knock
dad dad come on
whos there
norma lee
norma lee who
normally i dont go around
knocking on doors
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia
i got a joke
i got a joke
hows it going
i got a joke for you
what do you get when you cross
a gay eskimo and a black guy
all right look
i think weve had enough
with the jokes for tonight
thank you though
lets just talk
with each other
all right
i saw that three brothers
article in the trib this week
sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff
basically our big goal is to
try to take chicago tourism
by air land and sea
were still in the ground
phase with the buses
but as soon as we get
our infantry established
then well take it
to the squids
yeah
boats boats
oh boats
as soon as we control
the waterway then well
bring in air supports
and then well pretty much
control everything
you know dennis
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions
its really inspiring
oh thanks
because i understand
how you feel that passion
and sharing it
with other people i think
thats what lifes about
i dont feel that about
boats and squibs squids
squids
sorry
yeah
but i do feel it
about singing
with my a cappella group
the tone rangers
although its not
as aggressive as your dream
its really
more of a brotherhood
its like a musical team
its like a symphony of guys
guy symphony
and its very hard
to describe the true magic
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony
its transcendent
but its still very real
i guess the best way
to put it in words is just
even that doesnt do it
that doesnt do it
because thats just
one person
and what im talking about is
the pulse of the collective
oh heck let me just
show you how its done
dad how about
a little percussion
taptaptappy
taptaptappy

bag of lemons
honest to god

you know what im serious
i really am
i am too

to yourself you know
you could have said
yeah i think im gonna
get brooke some flowers
you said
on our very first date
that you dont like flowers
that theyre a waste of money
every girl likes flowers
gary
you said that you
dont like flowers
im supposed
to take that to mean
that you do like flowers
no this is not about
youre not
god youre not getting it
youre not getting this
gary okay
its not about the lemons
its not about the flowers
its not about the dishes
its just about
how many times do i have to
drop hints about the ballet
you know i cant stand
brooke come here
weve talked about
the damn ballet
i hate the goddamn ballet
you got a bunch of dudes
in tights flopping around
for three hours
its like a medieval
techno show its a nightmare
i sit there in a sweat
the whole thing i do
wondering when the hells
the goddamn nightmare
gonna end
go to a damn ballet
its not about you
loving the ballet gary
its about the
person that you love
loves the ballet
and you wanting to spend time
with that person
not when theyre
at the ballet
okay forget the ballet
forget the ballet
i will
we dont go anywhere together
we just went
to ann arbor together

what do you
how do you show up for me
im up on the bus
every goddamn day for you
come on you
im busting my ass
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city
so i can make enough money
to support both of us
and hopefully you wont
have to work one day
i want to work
all i ask brooke
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation
that i just get 20 minutes
to relax when i come home
instead of being attacked
with questions and nagged
the whole damn time
you think that i nag you
thats all you do
all you do is nag me
the bathrooms a mess
your belt doesnt match
hey gary you should
probably go work out
nothing i ever do
is ever good enough
i just want to be left
the hell alone
really is that
what you want gary
is that what you want
yeah
thats what you want
yeah
fine great
do whatever the hell you want
you leave your socks
all over this house
dress like a pig
play your stupidass
video game
i dont care im done
what
im done
i dont deserve this
i really do not deserve this
i deserve somebody
who gives a shit
im not spending one more
second of this life
with some inconsiderate prick
youre a prick
addie it just became
so clear tonight
how much he takes me
for granted
what happened
just the same old shit
i asked him to do one thing
and he didnt do it
then he complained
that he had to do anything
and i just felt like
i had no choice
no sweetie
you did have a choice okay
and it sounds like you
made the right one
you respected yourself
but its just not what i want
i dont want to break up
with him
i dont i just want him
to say thank you i want him
to want to do the dishes
i just want him to want
to take me to the ballet
i want him to get me
12 lemons you know
i just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it
okay you know what
im putting on my shoes
and im gonna be there
in 15 minutes
no ad dont
please i really dont
want to see anybody
i really dont
but look im worried
about you okay
and i can hear you in there
banging around your dishes
and i dont want you
getting out your clorox
and your rubber gloves
and taking this out
on the kitchen
look look look
okay tonight just
it just got a little
out of hand
and hopefully
hes just gonna realize
that hes got some changes
to make and hes gonna
hes gonna come home
and apologize
okay
thats whats gonna happen
i feel like i dont
you know like you dress
however you want to dress
you know
do whatever you want to do
im done with
the relationship
whatever
so its just kind of
youre done
with the relationship
well youre obviously
hurt about it
she got to you youre hurt
im not
its nothing to be ashamed of
she hurt you
will you look at me
im not heartbroken
im a little shocked
im a little surprised
gary youre devastated
now whats the name
of the guy shes doing
im gonna solve your problem
whats his name
what are you talking about
have you checked her email
i dont check emails
i dont
you can get a program
that records keystrokes
it costs like 20 bucks
very easy to use okay
you get a password you check
her email you find out
everything about her
thats how i found out
about the puerto rican
that stacy was
running around with
okay
you are reading
a little too much
into this situation
there is no one shes
running around with okay
we had a fight
over the groceries
i brought home
youre probably right
shes probably not
sleeping with anybody
no not what its about
okay
maybe shes with
another guy maybe not
shes not
i dont know
im not columbo okay
but what we do know
is that she doesnt want
to be with you anymore
i mean i hate to be shitty
about it and so cut and dry
but lets face it
she says she doesnt
want to be with you
and i believe her
now we gotta figure it out
and youre gonna
need a place to go
and lick your wounds
while you get your head
right over this thing
i dont need a place to go
and lick my wounds
youre gonna stay with me
im not gonna hear it
look it
im not moving
out of the place
oh youre not moving out
no i put money in the place
i put half my money
in the place
youre obviously not
the one calling the shots
in this case
yeah but i own the place
with her
yeah
but its not up to her
who gets to keep
the goddamn place
if you find out
who shes sleeping with
maybe we could leverage it
i want you to listen to me
you listen to me
im gonna leave you a key
i dont need a key
why
cause shes gonna put
shes gonna move out
of the place johnny
did she say
she was moving out

im gonna keep the place

figure of speech its brooke

and since you and i
are no longer a couple

for two singles on the team
why do you look confused
i dont have any idea
whats happening
ive come to play on the team
look gary i just dont think
its a good idea
for you and i to be around
each other any more
than we have to right now
i completely agree
maybe you should go
play some pinball
no i think you should leave
okay
brooke when a man makes
a commitment to a team
he honors that commitment
he doesnt let emotions
or personal issues
get in the way of victory
and ive made a commitment
to this team
they dont want you here
either gary
yeah sure they dont
they dont
theyre my friends
but youre not
a strong bowler
thats not the point
you know what lets just
why dont we let them decide
gary dont no
dont involve them okay
thats unnecessary
whats wrong castro
castro
well castro doesnt
let people vote as a team
okay ask them
thank you
okay everyone
team vote here
by a show of hands
just put it up when you
make a decision
who here agrees with brooke
and thinks i should leave
the bowling team
shocker
band of brothers
you should rent it sometime
good luck everyone
riding miss gutter ball
to the finals
hey gary
yeah
im gonna need
your shirt back
what
well were gonna have to
replace you and you know
we get docked 10 pins
if everyones not in matching
pin shakers uniforms
my shirt says gary on it
granted
but actually
we know a guy named gary
and hes not as tall as you
but hes a pretty good bowler
im gonna have to request
that i have my wrist guard
back then
im sorry thats mine
just give me
the goddamn wrist guard
please thank you
i hope your wrist snaps
wow okay you see that
you know what i mean
yeah that was awesome
you just had your
exboyfriend who you wish
you were still dating
voted off the bowling team

to get him right
where i want him
wheres that
shirtless in the parking lot
addie
youre not getting this
gary loves this bowling team
hes hurt right now
hes feeling pretty bad
hes gonna go out there
and hes gonna get drunk
hes gonna make
a complete fool of himself
and he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely
and pretty pathetic
and then its just
gonna hit him
whats gonna hit him
that not only is he
out a girlfriend
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece
and maybe that life
was pretty great
and maybe i was the glue
that was holding it all
together
and if he wants
that life back
hes gonna have no choice
but to change

youre an infant
yeah im an infant
go enjoy your room brooke
cause im gonna enjoy mine
okay
you know what
i might enjoy
some payperview
options tonight
its gonna be a long one
sweetheart
and i got nothing to do manana
but sleep in
boogie nights
aint no doubt
we are here to party
what are you doing
boogie nights
come on now
got to get it started
ricky you and
the get along gang leave
or im gonna
throw you out of here
personally you understand
actually gary
this is brookes bedroom
so technically
you dont have
jurisdiction here
but i think itd be really fun
if you sang with us
come on gary
i think youll like it
you got 10 seconds
to get out of here
or im gonna break
your damn magic whistle
you understand
what im saying to you
move this group
out of my house now
gary you cant take
a pitch pipe
out of a guys hand
when hes in the middle
of a very funky groove
you can get hurt
doing something like that
im tapping out
im tapping out
here we go from the bridge
party night
get on down
with the sound of the music
boogie nights
do it do it
what kind of bullshit move
was that
im sorry what
what happened
oh dont be coy with me
you sent that animal over here
to attack me when i was
hung over and weak
oh no look all i know
is the tone rangers
they needed someplace
to rehearse
so i very clearly
told richard
stay in my room
which you explained to me
was my space to do
with what i want
is that how
you want to play it
cause ill play it like that
ill play it like
lionel richie
all night long lady
oh yeah
ill call some guys
from my neck of the woods
and were not talking brooke
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples
were talking about polacks
that dont have
a goddamn future
right
thats right
we can make shit
real uncomfortable
around here
and thats what
were gonna do
please come on
you know what
youre just embarrassed
because richard
kicked your ass
richard did not kick my ass
what richard did was attack me
when i was half asleep
really
is that how you see it
theres a really big gap
between getting
your ass kicked
and having
a dancing singing sprite
fool you with trickery
and then strike your throat
before you know that
youre even in a fight
and i wouldnt expect
someone like you
to understand that
because all you ever do
is make moves from
up in your ivy tower
wow you have officially
gone off the reservation
im an adult
i talk through shit
he ran out of ideas
god listen by the way
theres messages
on the voice mail
regarding game night
which is obviously
not gonna happen

call people and tell them
that its canceled
why would i cancel game night

shoe seven times
its a sock asshole
you call yourself an artist
yes
a threeyearold with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this
im sorry i dont have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built
im the one who should
be sorry brooke
i shouldnt sit here
and pick on your art
no
because you got
the nuts part down
picasso
all you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear
thats van gogh
you idiot
and your insults
are much more effective
when theyre accurate
dont talk to me about
being goddamn accurate
i can talk to you
about anything that i want
cause you couldnt even
draw a sock
you dont do anything right
youre a lazy
everyone said
shoe shoe shoe
at first
i figured that the split
was just something temporary
something that you two
would work out and get past
but after tonight
i think its pretty clear
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together
theres not a shot in hell
gary
im just
i got you
as your friend
and as your realtor
im not gonna
leave here tonight
until we decide
what to do about this condo
because this living situation
is obviously not working out
gary
well the only logical thing
that i can think of
is for her to move out
of the condo
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for
the labor that i did
all around the condo
what what
what pay you compensation
for your labor
we fixed this place up
together
are you nuts
stop calling me nuts
i swear to god
i fixed the
you went around with a sponge
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit
thats what youre saying
that i did
theres no
that was
thats called aesthetics
it warmed this place up
so it didnt look like
an army barracks
which it was about to
ill tell you what
its called in his language
depreciated
thats what its called
you dont even know
what that means
unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
zuluvoodooland taste
all right
let me tell you
something else
its gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall
the holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called
oh please gary
youre gonna have
to cost money to fix that
what i did brooke
has concrete value
to the condo
i added concrete
well lets just go on record
were dealing with facts here
i did the tiling
in the bathroom
have you seen
i did the new track lighting
that tile is the
shittiest tile job
i did the plumbing
the plumbing
thats realty terms
okay lets talk
about your plumbing
this is his plumbing
we have two temperatures
in our bathroom
we get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite
thats it thats all we get
its my problem
that she doesnt know how
to pace a shower
now all of a sudden
thats my fault
i get a minute
to take a shower
one minute
one minute of warmth
oh jesus one minute
thats it thats correct
thank god youre not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in chicago on time
this is basic logic
you are out of your mind
you have lost it
let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse
cheese and rice
you guys are gonna kill
each other now lets just
realistically speaking
neither one of you
can afford this mortgage
on your own okay
and thats a shame
because this building will
continue to increase in value
i get nothing but
phone calls about it
all right
waiting for a unit to open up
so as your realtor
the last thing i would suggest
is selling
but as your friend
i just i dont see
any other solution
you take your halves
you go your separate ways
and you get on
with your lives
i know that selling is not
the easiest thing but
i do think that its the best
and to be honest
this is a situation
where i would just as soon
not take a commission
thats great thank you
thats great
thank you for that
i wish i didnt have to
you know
but company policy says
i cannot waive that
but i was just
you know im saying
in theory you know
in this situation
cause were friends
i wish i could waive it
no can do though
as soon as you can
i would love to get
a set of keys from you guys
you just drop them off
okay great there they are
ill be bringing by
people all week
you wont even know im here
the good news is
should move quickly
all right
okay to leave you two
alone now
got to get back to jen
very excited about
the win tonight
okay
addie
if the condo sells
i think im gonna lose him
yeah but game night
was so light and fun
im really surprised
to be hearing this
okay you know what
thats not constructive
really
i just yeah i need
a new plan addie i dont
im just kidding its me
im gonna have to
call you back
whenever one of my friends
is down we all go on
like happy patrol
i was actually having
a very serious conversation
christopher do not sing
if youre happy
and you know it
clap your hands
if youre happy
and you know it
clap your hands
if youre happy
and you know it
youre going to smile to
pack up your shit and go home
okay you know what
this is not his fault
he was just really trying
to cheer me up and it
did i or did i not give you
the day off to be sad
yes but i
well todays not that day
and unfortunately for you
i cant afford to look weak
no please
you have warned me
so many times
and you have yet to fire me
i think you and i both know
that to find and train
somebody new
its gonna cost you time
and its gonna cost you money
and i dont think you want
to spend either one of those
now look im just gonna
take a wild guess here
but you dont become
marilyn dean
without knowing
how to handle men
okay now just listen
to my problem
tell me how to fix it
and then well all
go back to work
okay what is this problem
so severe
that has caused you to
blaspheme in the synagogue
of marilyn dean
well its gary
i broke up with him
in hopes that losing me
would make him
want to change
and thats you know
and ive just ended up
pushing him you know
farther and farther away
thats it
yeah
honey this is not
surrealism or cubism
its paintbynumbers
go see mischa
my personal waxer at the spa
ask her for the telly savalas
the telly savalas
compliments of m dean
then go show gary
your immaculate canvas
and let him see another man
eager to paint it got it
got it
who loves you baby
wow impressive
three sharp hands landed
what an amazing display
of punching technique
the crowd jumps
that punch rocked him
they sense hes on the verge
of hitting the canvas
the roaring for anticipation
of a knockout
we are witnessing
a great fight
hes displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands
bulldog terrorizing
his opponent down he goes
hard punch slams him
to the canvas
one two three

i didnt really know
that the concert mattered
all that much to you
exactly
hold on a second here
let me talk for a second
gary
brooke you broke up with me
then you have guys
coming over here for dates
and all of a sudden
you ask me to go
to some concert
i mean i just figured that
you know
gary
i just i dont know
how we got here
our entire relationship
ive gone above
and beyond for you for us
and i mean ive cooked
ive picked your shit up
off the floor
ive laid your clothes
out for you like you were
a fouryearold
i support you
i supported you your work
if we ever had dinner
or anything
i make the plans
i take care of everything and
i just dont feel like you
appreciate any of it
i dont feel
you appreciate me
and all i want is to
is for you to just show me
that you care
why didnt you just
say that to me
gary ive tried ive tried
yeah but never like that
you mightve said
some things that you meant
to imply that brooke
but im not a mind reader
i doubt it would matter
you are who you are
just leave me alone okay
right now just shut my door
listen
all right gary just please
just leave the room
listen to me
gary just
i dont want to be
near you right now
listen to me
i just want to
please just shut the door
please
i know look i know
you feel bad but you know
what are you gonna do
i mean what does she expect
for me to want to go with
the girl who dumped me
i dont know she probably
just wanted you you know
to show her the respect
of not standing her up
or some shit who knows
well damn it
i should have just said
no in the first place
i dont know why i called
you know what
its her fault she got hurt
you shouldnt even feel bad
about it she should have
expected it from you
youre a fun guy okay
everybody likes you
youre the quickest guy
i know anytime we go out
i have a blast
all right but you know
everybody who knows you
knows youre gonna do
what you want to do
and if its not what the
other person wants to do
well thats their problem
thats bullshit
its not bullshit
theres plenty of times
i do shit that
i dont want to do
thats ridiculous no
like when
thats bullshit to say
about me
when have we ever
done something
you didnt want to do
you know i dont know
off the top of my head
i dont keep score
whens the last time
we went to a sox game
the sox
not when theyre playing
the cubs either
we always do what you want
to do and she always did
what you want to do
its who you are
everybody thinks
that youre their friend
okay
but the fact of the matter is
that theres not one person
that i know that
you trust enough
to let close enough
that they could hurt you
and her big problem
is that you really liked her
i mean she is the one girl
you really liked
and no matter what she did
and how hard she tried
you were never gonna
let your guard down
that poor girl
never stood a chance
marilyn
marilyn
yeah
im sorry i just
oh just get in here
oh okay
im sorry excuse me
marilyn i just
i just wanted to let you know
that today is gonna be
my last day
im gonna be traveling
for a bit
heres a blank check
write down a number i dont
want to know what it is
and go back to work
no no its not about that
i cant accept that
brooke
travis get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here
if you make it to rome
search out an establishment
called the padre negro
ask for a strapping young
fellow named alberto
compliments of m dean
well thank you
i appreciate that
yeah and honey
take as long as you want
because when youre done
your job will be right here
waiting for you
and if you discover a path
that doesnt lead back here
well i hope youll text
i will
and like i said
the apartments a mess
but im moving so
its okay relax about
the place i dont care
okay thisll just take
a second
okay
hello
hey im in here
dont say anything i
howre you doing
could i talk to you in private
for a second
you know what
this is really
not a good time
and obviously you have
something happening here
so well just be in
no no i dont have
anything going on
this is actually for you
im just gonna wait outside
no no wait
no no really its okay
i really cant do this
right now
brooke this whole thing
has been really tough on me
and ive tried to act
like it hasnt been
that tough on me
but the first sunday
after me and you broke up
it all kind of really hit me
and i think
it partially hit me
because sunday was sort of
always our day that we
would do stuff together
but i didnt have any idea
you still cared so much
and you know
when i saw you crying
the other night
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life
gary
let me just try to say
some of these things here
its just
look
i know that ive caused you
a lot of pain
and the funny thing is
all i really want to do
is make you happy
i just want to make you smile
now ive had a lot of time
to think about
some of the things
that went on and i know
brooke that i dont always
do the right thing
or always say
the right things
but i am willing to try
to do things differently
and id be happy to go
take a dance class
well i would honestly
i would like to go do that
or go travel
i mean id even be willing
to go to the ballet
although i would much rather
do the dance class
or take a trip somewhere
but i realize
thats not the point
i realize that the point
isnt that at all
because its not really
about doing things
that you love to do always
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love
and i love you
gary
just give me one second here
ive missed you so much
i promise you brooke
i will do whatever it is
that i have to do
to never hurt you again
i love you and im sorry
okay thats it
thats all i
oh god
thats all i wanted to say
so you can go ahead now
with anything that
youre feeling to say
i dont know what to say
just say whatever
you feel inside
i dont feel the same way
i dont i just
i dont know
oh god
i just i think
i dont know
but i dont think i have
anything left to give
im sorry
i was hoping for
it doesnt matter
oh this is now
beyond awkward
theres some new guy
standing out in the hallway
and i think im gonna go
okay
thank you
i made a dinner
and i dont know if
its any good or not
but youre welcome to have it
okay
gary thats really
thats not what
you think that it is
its okay
im gonna go take a walk
im sorry about that
no
im sorry i imposed
no thats fine please
so what do you think
i think youre right
i think its great
good
okay
okay
so
i will have that wrapped up
packed up sorry
and delivered
thank you for taking the time
to show it to me okay
sure
yeah im gonna run
okay ill walk you out
no no no
i can its okay
so the thing that
i was most afraid
of happening happened
and i dont regret it at all
because now she knows
how i feel
do you know what i mean
yeah
i think
what you got to do now
is really think hard
because you have
to find somebody
that cant be traced back
to either of us
to visit this guy
what are you talking about
i dont
the guy who came with her
i dont need anything
to happen to the guy
but if they could trace him
back to either one of us
its not about him
i dont care about that
its a problem
the guy hes not a
theyre not dumb
cops are smart trust me
okay but hes not
a problem to me
right
listen to me
promise me that youre
not gonna do anything
i got you
its better if nobody
you dont know anything
what are you talking about
ill take care of it
i dont want you
to take care of anything
john do me a favor
im being serious with you
i know i know
smart youre smart
no im not
im being honest with you
i dont want anything
to happen to him
me either
promise me youre not
gonna have anyone
do anything to this guy
but youve gotta
tell me exactly
what youre gonna tell them
if the cops come to you
because if we tell
a different story
nothing
promise me one thing
we dont care
john im gonna go home
i cant do this
im exhausted
right go home just make sure
your neighbors know
youre going home
do me a favor
they got phone records make
a couple phone calls tonight
especially around 1000
okay please dont
do anything all right
i dont mean it like
i mean honestly
no no i got it
for all you know
nothings happening
i dont want anything
to happen
right
say it louder
what are you doing here
so early
hey
everything okay

i just wanna get
my day started
but i just wanted to say that

so thats it
for all my stuff
if you want you could give me
your key and ill drop it off
at rigglemans
all right
thanks
gary
you know theres
a thousand things i
i would have done differently
me too
sort of actually
when i see this space i
realize that if we didnt have
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch
a pool table
would have fit nicely
yeah
although the oversized couch
did come in very useful the
last couple of weeks so
yes it i guess
have a good trip
thanks
chicago is called
the second city
because after the
great chicago fire of 1871
chicago was rebuilt
on its ruins
the city came back
even bigger and stronger
than it originally was
so its not really an insult
its more of a badge of honor
to be called
the second city
okay people you might
be able to get away
with that reaction at work

if you cant blow it out here
then where the hell
can you blow it out
