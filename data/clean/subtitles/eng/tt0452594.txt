hi  honey 
hi 
christmas was months ago 
don t remind me 
i miss it so much 
yeah  i know 
but today is not a holiday 
i know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone
and they dig the energy
that i give them 
okay  i m just saying 
i don t think marilyn dean
will  dig  the energy 
oh  no 
she s the one that told me
to be creative  so   
i know  it s just    okay 
what is the next holiday
coming 
the fourth of july

some people recognize
father s day as a holiday 
i don t 
i get it  i get it 
well  on those days
you can say   happy holidays    
every other day 
 good morning  good afternoon 
 good evening 
marilyn dean gallery    
okay 
okay 
i m so sorry about that 
oh  no 
so  now this is a new piece
by zakrzewska 
what do you think of this 
can i be honest with you 
please 
other than taking
an art history class
in college 
which i pretty much
slept through  i don t have
the first clue about art
or how to go about buying it 
i mean  like that painting 
i mean  i don t see the point
in buying something that
i could have done myself 
yeah  i completely agree
with you 
you know  an art teacher
of mine once said 
 never buy a piece of art
that you don t have to have    
you know  don t worry
about who the artist is
or how much it s worth 
i mean  you have to live
with it every day  you have
to walk by it every day 
you know  you have to
really love it  you have
to really appreciate it 
it s kind of like
picking a mate 
hey  honey 
hi 
how s it going 
it s good 
oh  wow  you got
a lot happening 
i know 
very exciting 
i am starving 
oh  careful  that s really   
that s very hot 
oh  that s hot  hot  hot 
yep 
jesus 
hey  honey 
you ve got to really   
you should get ready  okay 
oh  you look great 
thank you 
got a lot of nice stuff 
got a pizza 
all kinds of stuff 
terrific 
i just need you
to decide what to   
you know  i did everything 
gary 
yeah 
oh  come on  really 
you got three lemons 
what my baby wants 
my baby gets  you know that 
yeah  but i wanted 12 
baby wanted 12 
why would you want 12 lemons 
because i m making
a 12 lemon centerpiece 
so  no one s actually
even eating them 
they re just show lemons 
yeah  they re just
show lemons  shown in
the center of the table 
i m glad you find that
amusing 
but i cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons 
well 
can t you just use  like 
maybe a drinking glass 
i m not gonna use
a drinking   
we could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece 
i m not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece 
you know what 
i ve got an idea 
why don t we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether 
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it 
guess what  now we ve made
a better meal versus something
visually nice to look at 
what are you do   
what s happening here 
what are you doing 
what are you doing 
oh  i had
such a long day on the bus 
i need a little bit
of down time 
my feet are killing me 
gary  come on 
my feet are killing me  too 
i m exhausted 
i worked all day 
went to the market 
i cleaned this entire condo
and then i ve been cooking
for the last three hours 
come on  help set the table 
sweetheart 
what 
you ve done such a great job
already  don t you want
to finish it yourself
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment 
set the table 
listen to me 
do you think that
when michelangelo  right 
was painting
the sixteenth chapel 
that he said 
 hey  guys  you know 
i did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels 
 but why don t you help me
design this one 
 and maybe
you could help me   
give me a brush
 and you guys can grab brushes 
and we can all make a great chapel  
no  he didn t 
and you wanna know
what the results were 
a masterpiece 
okay  it s the sistine chapel 
not the sixteenth 
and i bet when michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes 
they didn t bring him three 
yeah  okay  all the talking
is really starting
to drain me 
and now i m gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what i missed here 
honey  look  gary  just   
down time s important 
gary  please just
take a shower  okay 
down time s important 
 cause this is what
i don t want to have happen 
i don t want the doorbell
to ring  i m then forced
to answer the door 
entertain people 
and i m still cooking dinner 
yeah 
okay 
you re absolutely right 
let s do that  the second
that this inning s over   
gary

might be a little more amazing
if we had a pool table 
gary  we ve already
discussed that 
we re gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place 
the place is plenty big now 
if you wanted a pool table
because   
gary

plenty of room 
and put a dining room table
in the living room  okay 
how do you   
i mean  what do you do
with a dining room table 
eat on it 
we d have no furniture
in the living   
where s the furniture go 
all i m saying is 
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool

i completely understand 
there s halls and stuff 
i mean  you can go   
we will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place 
thank you

okay  everybody 
time for the joke of the day 
knock  knock 
dad  dad  come on 
who s there 
norma lee 
norma lee  who 
normally  i don t go around
knocking on doors 
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia 
i got a joke 
i got a joke 
how s it going 
i got a joke for you 
what do you get when you cross
a gay eskimo and a black guy 
all right  look 
i think we ve had enough
with the jokes for tonight 
thank you  though 
let s just talk
with each other 
all right 
i saw that three brothers
article in the trib this week 
sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff 
basically  our big goal is to
try to take chicago tourism
by air  land and sea 
we re still in the ground
phase with the buses 
but as soon as we get
our infantry established 
then we ll take it
to the squids 
yeah 
boats  boats 
oh  boats 
as soon as we control
the waterway  then we ll
bring in air supports
and then we ll pretty much
control everything 
you know  dennis 
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions 
it s really inspiring 
oh  thanks 
because i understand
how you feel that passion 
and sharing it
with other people  i think
that s what life s about 
i don t feel that about
boats and squibs    squids 
squids 
sorry 
yeah 
but i do feel it
about singing 
with my a cappella group 
the tone rangers 
although it s not
as aggressive as your dream 
it s really
more of a brotherhood 
it s like a musical team 
it s like a symphony of guys 
guy symphony 
and it s very hard
to describe the true magic
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony 
it s transcendent 
but it s still very real 
i guess the best way
to put it in words is just   
even that doesn t do it 
that doesn t do it
because that s just
one person 
and what i m talking about is
the pulse of the collective 
oh  heck  let me just
show you how it s done 
dad  how about
a little percussion 
tap tap tappy 
tap tap tappy 
and  mom  high hat 
good  mom

i m not with you 
come  come 
with the kick drum

the kick drum kind of guy 
i d rather be just a listener
and enjoy all the banging
that he s doing and the   
you know  gary 
that s your prerogative 
that s your right  to listen 
meantime  i ve gotta talk
to brooke about something

gary  come on 
i don t want to do them later 
let s just do them now 
it ll take 15 minutes

i busted my ass all day

and then cooking that meal 
and i worked today

let me see if i m
following this  okay  are you
telling me that you re upset
because i don t have
a strong desire
to clean dishes 
no  i m upset because
you don t have a strong desire
to offer to do the dishes 
i just did 
after i asked you 
jesus  brooke 
you re acting crazy again 
don t you call me crazy 
i am not crazy 
i didn t call you crazy 
you just did 
i didn t call you   
no  i didn t 
i said you re acting crazy 
you know what  gary 
i asked you to do
one thing today 
one very simple thing 
to bring me 12 lemons
and you brought me three 
god damn it  if i knew
that it was gonna be
this much trouble 
i would have brought home
24 lemons  even 100 lemons 
you know what i wish 
i wish everyone that was
at that goddamn table
had their own little private
bag of lemons 
honest to god 
gary  it s not
about the lemons 
well  that s all
you re talking about 
i m just saying
it d be nice if you did
things that i asked 
it would be even nicer
if you did things without
me having to ask you 
well  i do seem to remember
doing something for you
this morning
without you asking 
gary  come on 
what  i m serious  come here 
you know what  i m serious 
i really am 
i am  too 
come on 
you knew i was working today
and i made that meal 
and you could have thought
to yourself  you know 
you could have said 
 yeah  i think i m gonna
get brooke some flowers    
you said
on our very first date
that you don t like flowers 
that they re a waste of money 
every girl likes flowers 
gary 
you said that you
don t like flowers 
i m supposed
to take that to mean
that you do like flowers 
no  this is not about   
you re not   
god  you re not getting it 
you re not getting this 
gary  okay 
it s not about the lemons 
it s not about the flowers 
it s not about the dishes 
it s just about   
how many times do i have to
drop hints about the ballet 
you know i can t stand   
brooke  come here 
we ve talked about
the damn ballet 
i hate the goddamn ballet 
you got a bunch of dudes
in tights flopping around
for three hours 
it s like a medieval
techno show  it s a nightmare 
i sit there in a sweat 
the whole thing  i do 
wondering when the hell s
the goddamn nightmare
gonna end 
go to a damn ballet 
it s not about you
loving the ballet  gary 
it s about the
person that you love
loves the ballet
and you wanting to spend time
with that person 
not when they re
at the ballet 
okay  forget the ballet 
forget the ballet 
i will 
we don t go anywhere together 
we just went
to ann arbor together 
to ann arbor 
to the
michigan notre dame game 
you think screaming 
drunk kids and leprechauns
doing backflips  that s fun 
that s fun for me 
come on  man 
i did that for you 
what do you   
how do you show up for me 
i m up on the bus
every goddamn day for you 
come on  you   
i m busting my ass
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city 
so i can make enough money
to support both of us
and hopefully you won t
have to work one day 
i want to work 
all i ask  brooke 
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation 
that i just get 20 minutes
to relax when i come home 
instead of being attacked
with questions and nagged
the whole damn time 
you think that i nag you 
that s all you do 
all you do is nag me 
 the bathroom s a mess    
 your belt doesn t match    
 hey  gary  you should
probably go work out    
nothing i ever do
is ever good enough 
i just want to be left
the hell alone 
really  is that
what you want  gary 
is that what you want 
yeah 
that s what you want 
yeah 
fine  great 
do whatever the hell you want 
you leave your socks
all over this house 
dress like a pig 
play your stupid ass
video game 
i don t care  i m done 
what 
i m done 
i don t deserve this 
i really do not deserve this 
i deserve somebody
who gives a shit 
i m not spending one more
second of this life
with some inconsiderate prick 
you re a prick 
addie  it just became
so clear tonight
how much he takes me
for granted 
what happened 
just the same old shit 
i asked him to do one thing
and he didn t do it 
then he complained
that he had to do anything 
and i just felt like
i had no choice 
no  sweetie 
you did have a choice  okay 
and it sounds like you
made the right one 
you respected yourself 
but it s just not what i want 
i don t want to break up
with him 
i don t  i just want him
to say thank you  i want him
to want to do the dishes 
i just want him to want
to take me to the ballet 
i want him to get me
12 lemons  you know   
i just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it 
okay  you know what 
i m putting on my shoes
and i m gonna be there
in 15 minutes 
no  ad  don t 
please  i really don t
want to see anybody 
i really don t 
but  look  i m worried
about you  okay 
and i can hear you in there
banging around your dishes 
and i don t want you
getting out your clorox
and your rubber gloves 
and taking this out
on the kitchen 
look  look  look 
okay  tonight just   
it just got a little
out of hand 
and hopefully
he s just gonna realize
that he s got some changes
to make and he s gonna   
he s gonna come home
and apologize 
okay 
that s what s gonna happen 
i feel like  i don t   
you know  like  you dress
however you want to dress 
you know 
do whatever you want to do 
i m done with
the relationship 
whatever 
so  it s just kind of 
 you re done
with the relationship  
well  you re obviously
hurt about it 
she got to you  you re hurt 
i m not 
it s nothing to be ashamed of 
she hurt you 
will you look at me 
i m not heartbroken 
i m a little shocked 
i m a little surprised 
gary  you re devastated 
now  what s the name
of the guy she s doing 
i m gonna solve your problem 
what s his name 
what are you talking about 
have you checked her e mail 
i don t check e mails 
i don t   
you can get a program
that records keystrokes 
it costs  like  20 bucks 
very easy to use  okay 
you get a password  you check
her e mail  you find out
everything about her 
that s how i found out
about the puerto rican
that stacy was
running around with 
okay 
you are reading
a little too much
into this situation 
there is no one she s
running around with  okay 
we had a fight
over the groceries
i brought home

sleeping with anybody 
no  not what it s about 
okay 
maybe she s with
another guy  maybe not 
she s not 
i don t know 
i m not columbo  okay 
but what we do know
is that she doesn t want
to be with you anymore 
i mean  i hate to be shitty
about it  and so cut and dry 
but let s face it 
she says she doesn t
want to be with you 
and i believe her 
now  we gotta figure it out 
and you re gonna
need a place to go
and lick your wounds
while you get your head
right over this thing 
i don t need a place to go
and lick my wounds 
you re gonna stay with me 
i m not gonna hear it 
look it   
i m not moving
out of the place 
oh  you re not moving out 
no  i put money in the place 
i put half my money
in the place 
you re obviously not
the one calling the shots
in this case 
yeah  but i own the place 
with her 
yeah 
but it s not up to her
who gets to keep
the goddamn place 
if you find out
who she s sleeping with 
maybe we could leverage it 
i want you to listen to me 
you listen to me 
i m gonna leave you a key 
i don t need a key 
why 
 cause she s gonna put

i m not moving
out of the place 
i ll leave you a key 
hey  how s it going 
i almost got it 
yeah 
you know  i was thinking 
you know what you should do 
is you should find somebody
who looks like brooke 
but even hotter and  you know 
bang the shit out of her 
what the hell s
wrong with you 
what 
logs

i am fixing
the goddamn engine

i m going through
a little bit of a
life change here  dennis 
i would really appreciate
a little bit of sensitivity 
please 
i know they re
both french  but that has
nothing to do with it 
because manet was earlier
and    no  monet and manet

i m sorry  i beg to differ 
excuse me  sir  can i have her
call you back personally 
yes  okay  thank you 
sorry  brooke

who am i 
marilyn dean 
and where are we 
the marilyn dean gallery 
and of whom is that portrait 
that is marilyn dean 
yeah 
you know  your personal life
is your personal life 
but you look like shit 
and when you look like shit 
marilyn dean looks like shit 
and now it is my business 
and when it comes to my
business  i don t like
anything that s distracting 
so  i want you to take
the rest of the day off
to be sad
and then come back
to work tomorrow ready
to take care of business 
got it 
oh  hey  brooke  how are you 
what the hell are you doing 
well  my whole life 
i always wanted my own place
with my own pool table 
i finally got my own place 
but you would not allow me
to have a pool table 
i just kind of figured
i d rectify that today 
and it does feel good 
i m gonna go ahead
and put the four ball
in the corner pocket 
nice 
i m sorry  can i   
a little room for the
shooter  please 
it s hard to shoot
with someone standing   
thank you 
wow 
well  i guess he feels
threatened that you broke up
with him and he s acting out 
okay  look  brooke 
men are like children 
you know  and they   
sweetie  it s a
figure of speech  it s brooke 
and i love you so much 
and you re my man
and you know that 
you re amazing  i love you 
listen  and they re gonna
test boundaries to see
what they can get away with 
i think there s three things
that gary needs to know 
one  this type of behavior
is not unnoticed 
two  it s not acceptable 
and three  you know 
you re definitely not gonna
tolerate it  right 
yes 
and brooke  remember 
we re always owning
our actions  right 
and we re always
healthy with it  yes 
yes 
i don t wanna finish the game 
i got showings  okay 
i gotta buy the cookie spray 
i gotta clean up the dog 
and now i m really leaving
 cause i don t want
to hear that  okay 
thank you for the pool 
thank you for the snacks 
i m going to get a cab 
i ll split it with you 
what are you  12 
brooke  that is not healthy 
i m trying to make a point 
and what is that point 
my point s your point 
your three points 
that it s not unnoticed 
that it was not acceptable 
and that it would definitely
not be tolerated 
not exactly what i meant 
unbelievable 
i knew it 
hey  gang 
found my shirt on the floor 
thanks for laying it out 
gary  are you here
for couples bowling 
yeah 
well  don t you think
you and i should discuss
something first 
like what  how your
47 average is killing us 
okay  great  no 
gary  this is couples bowling 
and since you and i
are no longer a couple 
because you have chosen
not to participate
constructively
in our relationship 
we re now singles 
so  there s not room
for two singles on the team 
why do you look confused 
i don t have any idea
what s happening 
i ve come to play on the team 
look  gary  i just don t think
it s a good idea
for you and i to be around
each other any more
than we have to right now 
i completely agree 
maybe you should go
play some pinball 
no  i think you should leave 
okay 
brooke  when a man makes
a commitment to a team 
he honors that commitment 
he doesn t let emotions
or personal issues
get in the way of victory 
and i ve made a commitment
to this team 
they don t want you here
either  gary 
yeah  sure  they don t 
they don t 
they re my friends 
but you re not
a strong bowler 
that s not the point 
you know what  let s just   
why don t we let them decide 
gary  don t  no 
don t involve them  okay 
that s unnecessary 
what s wrong  castro 
castro 
well  castro doesn t
let people vote as a team 
okay  ask them 
thank you 
okay  everyone 
team vote here 
by a show of hands 
just put it up when you
make a decision 
who here agrees with brooke
and thinks i should leave
the bowling team 
shocker 
band of brothers 
you should rent it sometime 
good luck  everyone 
riding miss gutter ball
to the finals 
hey  gary 
yeah 
i m gonna need
your shirt back 
what 
well  we re gonna have to
replace you  and you know
we get docked 10 pins
if everyone s not in matching
pin shakers uniforms 
my shirt says  gary  on it 
granted 
but actually 
we know a guy named gary 
and he s not as tall as you 
but he s a pretty good bowler 
i m gonna have to request
that i have my wrist guard
back then 
i m sorry  that s mine 
just give me
the goddamn wrist guard 
please  thank you 
i hope your wrist snaps 
wow  okay  you see that 
you know what i mean 
yeah  that was awesome 
you just had your
ex boyfriend  who you wish
you were still dating 
voted off the bowling team 
well  i had to do that
to get him right
where i want him 
where s that 
shirtless in the parking lot 
addie 
you re not getting this 
gary loves this bowling team 
he s hurt right now 
he s feeling pretty bad 
he s gonna go out there
and he s gonna get drunk 
he s gonna make
a complete fool of himself 
and he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely
and pretty pathetic 
and then it s just
gonna hit him 
what s gonna hit him 
that not only is he
out a girlfriend 
but his life is just
falling apart piece by piece
and maybe that life
was pretty great 
and maybe i was the glue
that was holding it all
together 
and if he wants
that life back 
he s gonna have no choice
but to change 
how about this 
i feel like we just found hell 
when did you start
coming to knobby joints
like this 
i might be the greatest
you ve ever seen  pal

well  you ve become
an indoor cat 
you ve been getting your milk
brought to you

your mtv generation 
your technology 
your text message

richard is not gay

 cause i m gonna enjoy mine 
okay 
you know what 
i might enjoy
some pay per view
options tonight 
it s gonna be a long one 
sweetheart 
and i got nothing to do manana
but sleep in 
boogie nights
ain t no doubt
we are here to party
what are you doing 
boogie nights
come on now 
got to get it started
ricky  you and
the get along gang leave
or i m gonna
throw you out of here
personally  you understand 
actually  gary 
this is brooke s bedroom 
so  technically 
you don t have
jurisdiction here 
but i think it d be really fun
if you sang with us 
come on  gary 
i think you ll like it 
you got 10 seconds
to get out of here
or i m gonna break
your damn magic whistle 
you understand
what i m saying to you 
move this group
out of my house  now 
gary  you can t take
a pitch pipe
out of a guy s hand
when he s in the middle
of a very funky groove 
you can get hurt
doing something like that 
i m tapping out 
i m tapping out 
here we go  from the bridge 
party night
get on down
with the sound of the music
boogie nights
do it  do it
what kind of bullshit move
was that 
i m sorry  what 
what happened 
oh  don t be coy with me 
you sent that animal over here
to attack me when i was
hung over and weak 
oh  no  look  all i know
is the tone rangers 
they needed someplace
to rehearse 
so i very clearly
told richard 
 stay in my room  
which you explained to me
was my space to do
with what i want 
is that how
you want to play it 
 cause i ll play it like that 
i ll play it like
lionel richie 
all night long  lady 
oh  yeah 
i ll call some guys
from my neck of the woods 
and we re not talking  brooke 
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples 
we re talking about polacks
that don t have
a goddamn future 
right 
that s right 
we can make shit
real uncomfortable
around here 
and that s what
we re gonna do 
please  come on 
you know what 
you re just embarrassed
because richard
kicked your ass 
richard did not kick my ass 
what richard did was attack me
when i was half asleep 
really 
is that how you see it 
there s a really big gap
between getting
your ass kicked
and having
a dancing  singing sprite
fool you with trickery
and then strike your throat
before you know that
you re even in a fight 
and i wouldn t expect
someone like you
to understand that 
because all you ever do
is make moves from
up in your ivy tower 
wow  you have officially
gone off the reservation 
i m an adult 
i talk through shit 
he ran out of ideas 
god  listen  by the way 
there s messages
on the voice mail
regarding game night

not gonna happen 
so you might want to
call people and tell them
that it s canceled 
why would i cancel game night 
well  i mean   
if it s our turn to host game 
i m gonna host
goddamn game night 
you want to host game night

here we go 
we re mind melding

it doesn t have

just has to be
something we can get 
shoe  shoe   
shoe  shoe  shoe  shoe 
shoeless joe jackson 
draw something different 
no one s getting it 
shoe  what  is that
a smaller shoe 
baby shoe 
smaller shoe  baby shoes 
shoes 
baby shoes 
smaller shoe  gumshoe 
smaller shoes 
gumshoe  gumshoe 
running olympics 
inside the shoe 
inside a shoe  a bubble   
lining 
stop pointing at the shoe 
we re not   
no one s guessing shoe 
stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different 
draw something different 
you   
goddamn it 
no one s guessing shoe 
you drew a big shoe 
then a small shoe 
and no one got it 
you gotta draw something
different  everyone said
 shoe  seven times 
it s a sock  asshole 
you call yourself an artist 
yes 
a three year old with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this 
i m sorry  i don t have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built 
i m the one who should
be sorry  brooke 
i shouldn t sit here
and pick on your art 
no 
because you got
the nuts part down 
picasso 
all you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear 
that s van gogh 
you idiot 
and your insults
are much more effective
when they re accurate 
don t talk to me about
being goddamn accurate 
i can talk to you
about anything that i want 
 cause you couldn t even
draw a sock 
you don t do anything right 
you re a lazy   
everyone said 
 shoe  shoe  shoe  
at first 
i figured that the split
was just something temporary 
something that you two
would work out and get past 
but after tonight
i think it s pretty clear
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together 
there s not a shot in hell 
gary 
i m just   
i got you 
as your friend
and as your realtor 
i m not gonna
leave here tonight
until we decide
what to do about this condo 
because this living situation
is obviously not working out 
gary 
well  the only logical thing
that i can think of
is for her to move out
of the condo 
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for
the labor that i did
all around the condo 
what  what 
what  pay you compensation
for your labor 
we fixed this place up
together 
are you nuts 
stop calling me nuts 
i swear to god 
i fixed the   
you went around with a sponge 
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit 
that s what you re saying
that i did 
there s no   
that was   
that s called aesthetics 
it warmed this place up
so it didn t look like
an army barracks 
which it was about to 
i ll tell you what
it s called in his language 
depreciated 
that s what it s called 
you don t even know
what that means 
unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
zulu voodoo land taste 
all right 
let me tell you
something else 
it s gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall 
the holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called 
oh  please  gary 
you re gonna have
to cost money to fix that 
what i did  brooke 
has concrete value
to the condo 
i added concrete   
well  let s just go on record 
we re dealing with facts here 
i did the tiling
in the bathroom 
have you seen   
i did the new track lighting 
that tile is the
shittiest tile job 
i did the plumbing 
the plumbing 
that s realty terms 
okay  let s talk
about your plumbing 
this is his plumbing 
we have two temperatures
in our bathroom 
we get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite 
that s it  that s all we get 
it s my problem
that she doesn t know how
to pace a shower 
now all of a sudden
that s my fault 
i get a minute
to take a shower 
one minute 
one minute of warmth 
oh  jesus  one minute 
that s it  that s correct 
thank god you re not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in chicago on time 
this is basic logic 
you are out of your mind 
you have lost it 
let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse 
cheese and rice 
you guys are gonna kill
each other  now  let s just   
realistically speaking 
neither one of you
can afford this mortgage
on your own  okay 
and that s a shame 
because this building will
continue to increase in value 
i get nothing but
phone calls about it 
all right 
waiting for a unit to open up 
so  as your realtor 
the last thing i would suggest
is selling 
but as your friend 
i just  i don t see
any other solution 
you take your halves 
you go your separate ways 
and you get on
with your lives 
i know that selling is not
the easiest thing  but
i do think that it s the best 
and to be honest 
this is a situation
where i would just as soon
not take a commission 
that s great  thank you 
that s great 
thank you for that 
i wish i didn t have to 
you know

i cannot waive that 
but i was just   
you know  i m saying
in theory  you know 
in this situation 
 cause we re friends 
i wish i could waive it 
no can do  though 
as soon as you can 
i would love to get
a set of keys from you guys 
you just drop them off 
okay  great  there they are 
i ll be bringing by

okay to leave you two
alone now

very excited about
the win tonight 
okay 
addie 
if the condo sells 
i think i m gonna lose him 
yeah  but game night
was so light and fun 
i m really surprised
to be hearing this 
okay  you know what 
that s not constructive 
really 
i just    yeah  i need
a new plan  addie  i don t   
i m just kidding  it s me 
i m gonna have to
call you back 
whenever one of my friends
is down  we all go on 
like  happy patrol 
i was actually having
a very serious conversation 
christopher  do not sing 
if you re happy
and you know it
clap your hands
if you re happy
and you know it
clap your hands
if you re happy
and you know it
you re going to smile to   
pack up your shit and go home 
okay  you know what 
this is not his fault 
he was just really trying
to cheer me up and it   
did i or did i not give you
the day off to be sad 
yes  but i   
well  today s not that day 
and unfortunately for you 
i can t afford to look weak 
no  please 
you have warned me
so many times
and you have yet to fire me 
i think you and i both know
that to find and train
somebody new 
it s gonna cost you time 
and it s gonna cost you money 
and i don t think you want
to spend either one of those 
now  look  i m just gonna
take a wild guess here 
but you don t become
marilyn dean
without knowing
how to handle men 
okay  now  just listen
to my problem 
tell me how to fix it 
and then we ll all
go back to work 
okay  what is this problem
so severe
that has caused you to
blaspheme in the synagogue
of marilyn dean 
well  it s gary 
i broke up with him
in hopes that losing me
would make him
want to change 
and that s  you know   
and i ve just ended up
pushing him  you know 
farther and farther away 
that s it 
yeah 
honey  this is not
surrealism or cubism 
it s paint by numbers 
go see mischa 
my personal waxer at the spa 
ask her for the telly savalas 
the telly savalas 
compliments of m  dean 
then go show gary
your immaculate canvas
and let him see another man
eager to paint it  got it 
got it 
who loves you  baby 
wow  impressive 
three sharp hands landed 
what an amazing display
of punching technique 
the crowd jumps 
that punch rocked him 
they sense he s on the verge
of hitting the canvas 
the roaring for anticipation
of a knockout 
we are witnessing
a great fight 
he s displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands 
bulldog terrorizing
his opponent  down he goes 
hard punch slams him
to the canvas 
one  two  three 
four  five  six  seven  eight 
nine  ten  it s over

jealous of some guy
with computer skills 
let s say he doesn t have
computer skills  but he s got
a big old elephant hog on him 
would that bother you
or would you be
okay with that 
not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works 
my mind works great

sad is  instead of putting
 1 000 into your mortgage
every month 
you waste it on rent 
that s what sad is 
oh  you re broke up 
you re confused 
brokenhearted 
heartbreak is not
having that money
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money 
so that after taxes
you can invest 
you know  you re confused 
are you finished 
look  i need
the damn tour logs

logs are  those logs are
bullshit is what they are 
you got the receipts

things yourself

i planned on going
to the concert 
it s just  i stopped by
johnny o s and we   
it doesn t fucking matter 
okay 
would you just leave my room
and shut the door 
jesus 
please 
i didn t really know
that the concert mattered
all that much to you 
exactly 
hold on a second here 
let me talk for a second 
gary   
brooke  you broke up with me 
then you have guys
coming over here for dates 
and all of a sudden
you ask me to go
to some concert 
i mean  i just figured that 
you know 
gary 
i just    i don t know
how we got here 
our entire relationship
i ve gone above
and beyond for you  for us 
and i mean  i ve cooked 
i ve picked your shit up
off the floor 
i ve laid your clothes
out for you like you were
a four year old 
i support you 
i supported you  your work 
if we ever had dinner
or anything 
i make the plans 
i take care of everything and
i just don t feel like you
appreciate any of it 
i don t feel
you appreciate me 
and all i want is to   
is for you to just show me
that you care 
why didn t you just
say that to me 
gary  i ve tried  i ve tried 
yeah  but never like that 
you might ve said
some things that you meant
to imply that  brooke 
but i m not a mind reader 
i doubt it would matter 
you are who you are 
just leave me alone  okay 
right now  just shut my door 
listen 
all right  gary  just  please 
just leave the room 
listen to me 
gary  just   
i don t want to be
near you right now 
listen to me 
i just want to   
please  just shut the door 
please 
i know  look  i know
you feel bad  but  you know 
what are you gonna do 
i mean  what does she expect 
for me to want to go with
the girl who dumped me 
i don t know  she probably
just wanted you  you know 
to show her the respect
of not standing her up
or some shit  who knows 
well  damn it 
i should have just said
no in the first place 
i don t know why i called   
you know what 
it s her fault she got hurt 
you shouldn t even feel bad
about it  she should have
expected it from you 
you re a fun guy  okay 
everybody likes you 
you re the quickest guy
i know  anytime we go out 
i have a blast 
all right  but  you know 
everybody who knows you
knows you re gonna do
what you want to do 
and if it s not what the
other person wants to do 
well  that s their problem 
that s bullshit 
it s not bullshit 
there s plenty of times
i do shit that
i don t want to do 
that s ridiculous  no 
like when 
that s bullshit to say
about me 
when have we ever
done something
you didn t want to do 
you know  i don t know 
off the top of my head 
i don t keep score   
when s the last time
we went to a sox game 
the sox 
not when they re playing
the cubs  either 
we always do what you want
to do and she always did
what you want to do 
it s who you are 
everybody thinks
that you re their friend 
okay 
but the fact of the matter is
that there s not one person
that i know that
you trust enough
to let close enough
that they could hurt you 
and her big problem
is that you really liked her 
i mean  she is the one girl
you really liked 
and no matter what she did
and how hard she tried 
you were never gonna
let your guard down 
that poor girl
never stood a chance 
marilyn 
marilyn 
yeah 
i m sorry  i just   
oh  just get in here 
oh  okay 
i m sorry  excuse me 
marilyn  i just   
i just wanted to let you know
that today is gonna be
my last day 
i m gonna be traveling
for a bit 
here s a blank check 
write down a number  i don t
want to know what it is 
and go back to work 
no  no  it s not about that 
i can t accept that 
brooke 
travis  get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here 
if you make it to rome 
search out an establishment
called the padre negro 
ask for a strapping young
fellow named alberto 
compliments of m  dean 
well  thank you 
i appreciate that 
yeah  and  honey 
take as long as you want 
because when you re done 
your job will be right here
waiting for you 
and if you discover a path
that doesn t lead back here   
well  i hope you ll text 
i will 
and  like i said 
the apartment s a mess 
but i m moving  so   
it s okay  relax about
the place  i don t care 
okay  this ll just take
a second 
okay 
hello 
hey  i m in here 
don t say anything  i   
how re you doing 
could i talk to you in private
for a second 
you know what 
this is really
not a good time 
and obviously you have
something happening here 
so we ll just be in   
no  no  i don t have
anything going on 
this is actually for you 
i m just gonna wait outside 
no  no  wait 
no  no  really  it s okay 
i really can t do this
right now 
brooke  this whole thing
has been really tough on me
and i ve tried to act
like it hasn t been
that tough on me 
but the first sunday
after me and you broke up 
it all kind of really hit me 
and i think
it partially hit me
because sunday was sort of
always our day that we
would do stuff together 
but i didn t have any idea
you still cared so much 
and  you know 
when i saw you crying
the other night 
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life 
gary 
let me just try to say
some of these things here 
it s just   
look 
i know that i ve caused you
a lot of pain 
and the funny thing is 
all i really want to do
is make you happy 
i just want to make you smile 
now  i ve had a lot of time
to think about
some of the things
that went on  and i know 
brooke  that i don t always
do the right thing
or always say
the right things 
but i am willing to try
to do things differently 
and i d be happy to go
take a dance class 
well  i would  honestly 
i would like to go do that 
or go travel 
i mean  i d even be willing
to go to the ballet 
although i would much rather
do the dance class
or take a trip somewhere 
but i realize
that s not the point 
i realize that the point
isn t that at all 
because it s not really
about doing things
that you love to do always 
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love 
and i love you 
gary 
just give me one second here 
i ve missed you so much 
i promise you  brooke 
i will do whatever it is
that i have to do
to never hurt you again 
i love you and i m sorry 
okay  that s it 
that s all i   
oh  god 
that s all i wanted to say 
so you can go ahead now
with anything that
you re feeling to say 
i don t know what to say 
just say whatever
you feel inside 
i don t feel the same way 
i don t  i just   
i don t know 
oh  god 
i just  i think   
i don t know 
but i don t think i have
anything left to give 
i m sorry 
i was hoping for   
it doesn t matter 
oh  this is now
beyond awkward 
there s some new guy
standing out in the hallway
and i think i m gonna go 
okay 
thank you 
i made a dinner 
and i don t know if
it s any good or not 
but you re welcome to have it 
okay 
gary  that s really   
that s not what
you think that it is 
it s okay 
i m gonna go take a walk 
i m sorry about that 
no 
i m sorry i imposed 
no  that s fine  please 
so  what do you think 
i think you re right 
i think it s great 
good 
okay 
okay 
so 
i will have that wrapped up 
packed up  sorry 
and delivered 
thank you for taking the time
to show it to me  okay 
sure 
yeah  i m gonna run 
okay  i ll walk you out 
no  no  no 
i can    it s okay 
so  the thing that
i was most afraid
of happening happened
and i don t regret it at all 
because now she knows
how i feel 
do you know what i mean 
yeah 
i think 
what you got to do now
is really think hard 
because you have
to find somebody
that can t be traced back
to either of us
to visit this guy 
what are you talking about 
i don t   
the guy who came with her 
i don t need anything
to happen to the guy 
but if they could trace him
back to either one of us   
it s not about him 
i don t care about that 
   it s a problem 
the guy  he s not a   
they re not dumb 
cops are smart  trust me 
okay  but he s not
a problem to me

last couple of weeks  so

chicago is called
the second city
because after the
great chicago fire of 1871 
chicago was rebuilt
on its ruins 
the city came back
even bigger and stronger
than it originally was 
so it s not really an insult 
it s more of a badge of honor
to be called   
the second city 
okay  people  you might
be able to get away
with that reaction at work 
but you are on vacation here 
if you can t blow it out here 
then where the hell
can you blow it out 
ladies and gentlemen 
show me that you mean it 
do not make me ask you twice 
are you ready to see chicago

i said  are you ready
to see chicago 
yes 
are you ready to see chicago
