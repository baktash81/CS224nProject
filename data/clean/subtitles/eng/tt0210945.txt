my daddy coached in alexandria 
he worked so hard my mama left him 
but i stayed with coach 
he needed me on that field 
up until 1971 in alexandria 
there was no race mixing 
then the school board 
forced us to integrate 
they combined the white school
and the black school into one 
called t c  williams high school 
murderer  murderer 
that summer 
a black teenager was killed
by a white store owner 
and the city
was on the verge of exploding 
you ve caused enough damage 
  this is my store 
  back off 
go left  go left  left 
come on  kirk  don t let ray
back you down like that 
you re twice his size 
what are they doing 
if they keep playing like that 
we ll lose every game 
i didn t think that was so bad 
looks good  gerry 
i see you been working 
thanks  thanks a lot  coach 
listen  with the schools
integrating and all 
some of the guys are
worried about losing
their starting positions 
well  that s something we re
just gonna have to figure out 
but you don t worry about that now 
you just keep at it  all right 
yes  coach 
hey  guys 
it s coming down 
it s coming down at the store 
they want to burn the place up
 cause that colored kid got shot 
come on  man  let s go 
hey  hey 
coach 
you just get sheryl
to the school now  herb 
get in the truck 
gerry  alan  ray 
if you ever want to play for me again 
get in the truck  now 
you boys are gonna cool off 
come with me to my office 
help me finish packing my things 
gerry  son  your heart s
in the right place 
but you ought to know better
than to embarrass the coach like that 
bertier  hell  why don t you just
kick them all off the team 
i don t want to play with
any of those black animals 
i see him 
who are you 
i m herman boone 
i m the new assistant coach 
well  from the looks of things 
i d say we got all the help
we need around here 
why ain t you outside there
with all your little friends  hollering 
this was the time
that was arranged for me
to meet with coach yoast 
i never miss an appointment 
well  maybe you
just better reschedule 
coach boone 
the school board made the decision
to put you on my staff 
i did not hire you 
well  i came up here to coach at g w 
i didn t ask the schools to redistrict 
i didn t ask to be assigned to your staff 
so i guess we re both in a situation
we don t want to be in 
but i can guarantee you this  coach 
i come to win 
win  coach yoast here
has been nominated
to the virginia high school
hall of fame 
fifteen winning seasons 
i won a couple of titles
down in north carolina 
that s aa ball 
this here s virginia  we play aaa 
what an opportunity for me  then 
to learn
from the best 
are those people the movers 
no  looks like
they re moving in here 
lord 
how many of them are there 
it only takes one 
then we re gonna be overrun by  em 
nicky  mommy  where are you
taking my teddy bear 
that  come on  y all 
where is everybody 
nicky  yes 
look there 
here comes some more of  em 
that s dr  day 
that negro from the school board 
what s he doing here 
the school board has decided
that negro  herman boone 
is gonna be the head coach at t c 
it s not fair  my daddy s head coach 
this is gonna be his hall of fame year 
and no one is trying to take away
your daddy s future place in the hall 
you can t just walk in here
and take my daddy s job away 
that is enough  sheryl  that s enough 
sheryl 
it s all right  bill  i feel the same way 
it s those agitators and race mixers
i feel like taking a swat at 
troublemakers in the berg are ready
to put a torch to the city 
you want us to burn up like watts 
every head coach in the system
is white 
we had to give them something 
it s the world we live in 
god help us all 
i left north carolina
because i was passed over
for a job that i had rightfully earned 
gave it to a white coach down there 
couldn t even tie up
his own football cleats 
now you are asking me
to do the same thing to this man 
i can t do that 
herman 
folks in carolina say
you marched with dr  king 
say you stood toe to toe with the klan 
said you re a race man 
that s right  i m also a family man 
coach boone 
black folks have never had anything
in this city to call their own 
except humiliation and despair 
dr  day  excuse me 
herman  i think you d
better look outside 
so  you see  we need you 
coach boone 
come on  meet the people 
coach boone  i m charles campbell 
this here is my boy julius 
he can be the finest defensive end
in the whole state if you push him to it 
i ve heard a lot about you 
you re like an answer to our prayers 
now  wait a minute 
i m not an answer to your prayers 
i m not a savior or jesus christ 
martin luther king 
or the easter bunny 
i m a football coach  that s all 
  just a football coach 
  you re our coach 
you re our coach 
coach boone 
boone  boone  boone 
what do you want 
is coach yoast here 
we re busy
interviewing for head coaching jobs 
gotten 11 offers and
certainly no time for you 
well  come on in 
i ve got an office out back 
look  i can t even
spell diplomacy 
and i m sorry about
the way things went down 
but make no mistake  i am qualified
to be this school s head coach 
sure  you ve been in  what 
4 or 5 programs in the past 10 years 
with 4 or 5 championships 
this isn t about me 
i m worried about my boys 
well  i ain t gonna cook  em
and eat  em 
the best player will play 
color won t matter 
from the looks of our
little situation we got us here 
i d say it s about all that does 
yeah  you re right 
we re in a tough spot  coach 
you  me  the whole city 
i think it would go a long way
to smooth things over
if you would stay  work on the staff 
be a defensive coordinator 
assistant head coach 
work under you 
if that s the way you see it 
good night  coach 
it s been a rare privilege
to have lived here as long as i have
coaching your boys 
i ll be taking the year off

   after which i ll be moving to loudoun 
taking the head coaching job
at loudoun high

you got anger  that s good 
you re gonna need it  son 
you got aggression  that s even better 
you re gonna need that  too 
but any little two year old child
can throw a fit 
football is about controlling that anger 
harnessing that aggression
into a team effort
to achieve perfection 
some coaches  they cut a player
if they think he s not up to snuff 
when they think he s hurting the team 
this is a public school program 
i will never  ever cut a player
who comes out to play for me 
but when you put that uniform on 
that titan uniform 
you better come to work 
we will be perfect
in every aspect of the game 
you drop a pass  you run a mile 
you miss a blocking assignment 
you run a mile 
you fumble the football 
and i will break my foot off
in your john brown hindparts 
and then you will run a mile 
perfection 
let s go to work 
move  move those feet 
get up  boy  get up  get up

setting a good example
for our boys and for the community 
i don t scratch my head unless it itches 
and i don t dance unless
i hear some music 
i will not be intimidated 
that s just the way it is 
if you want to carry
your sinful pride with you
to your grave  that s your business 
but when your sins
endanger my little girl 
it becomes mine 
my sins 
you think my sins had something to do
with what happened last night 
i m sorry about what
happened to your daughter

today at 12 noon 
press conference 
listen  what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing 
but we are not gonna parade around
talking about football at a time like this 
hold on  i m not talking about parading 
i m talking about going out there 
presenting a strong  united front 
now  i m hurting
just like you are  yoast 
but the season is not over yet 
i did    we did not come this far
to just break down
and lose now 
everything s not always
about winning and losing 
i m a winner 
i m going to win 
is this even about football anymore 
or is it just about you 
coach boone 
coach  you lost bertier 
is your defense in trouble 
you cannot replace a gerry bertier 
as a player or person 
i don t know  mama 
maybe yoast was right 
maybe i pushed  em too hard 
gerry had an accident 
sometimes life s just hard 
for no reason at all 
you think i was blinded
by my own ambition 
whatever kind of ambition it took
to do what you did around here 
this world could use
a lot more of it  herman 
bertier  hey  coach 
hey  coach 
this for me 
i want you to be my eyes
