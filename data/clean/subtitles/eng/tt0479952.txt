so technically speaking  he can t be
a member of the pride  it s nonsense 
i had forgotten about the rite of passage 
what is it  what s this rite of passage 
it s a traditional coming of age ceremony 
young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills 
  sort of a show of skill talent show type of deal

we survive the concrete jungle 
when we need food  we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand 
  am i right 
  she s right 
when we need shelter 
we build skyscrapers 
  exactly 
  when we need water  we build a dam 
we re new yorkers  for crying out loud 
if we can make it there 
we can make it anywhere 
i m coming  king julien

  you re not nervous  are you 
  nah  it s my thing  you know  it s kinda what i do

a dance battle sort of thing 
  like a dance off 
  aa    sure 
great  i love that  freestyle 
who d be a good match for me 
just to keep things interesting 
well  i wish i could help

alakay has failed the test 
who would have ever imagined
that today zuba would have to banish   
   his own son 
zuba  no 
zuba  yes 
sadly  the alpha lion
must cast out all failures

who could possibly take zuba s place 
anyone 
someone  no one

this tremendous burden 
teetsi  get the hat

  like what 
i would love to become
a professional whistler 
i m pretty amazing at it now 
but i want to get like even better

you know what else i would do 
i would invade a neighboring country
and impose my own ideology 
even if they didn t want it 
easy for you to say  you re a king

only just a sad little head 
there must be something
you want to do before you die

you re a dead man anyway 
yeah  yeah 
you re right 
you ve got to march
right up to this woman 
look her right in the eye  lean forward 
just a little  or almost all the way 
then you let her lean forward
a little until you re   
   just lips  distance
away from each other 
then you just tell her 
how much you hate her

exactly  shirley 
i m bob

the only water on the reserve 
if you re thirsty  you ll have to look
for water off the reserve 
  off the reserve 
  it s too dangerous 
hunters would shoot us 
no one leaves the reserve and survives 
i left the reserve 
and survived 
i could do something about this

like we get in new york all the time  
i ll just travel upriver   
  upriver 
  off the reserve

and bring back your water 
great  i d help you pack  but by the
looks of that hat  i see you re all set

any water 
no  just more diamonds and gold 
ok  don t give up hope 
listen up  i will help you 
there s only one way
to get your precious water 
i  your beloved king julien
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends  the water gods 
in the volcano 
what does that do 
what does that do  excellent question 
my sacrifice goes in the volcano 
the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice 
 thank you for the sacrifice  
 here  have another sacrifice 
 no  i ve had enough for the day  
 i m gonna be very insulted
unless you have another  
 i don t want another sacrifice  ok  
 look at you  you look skinny  
 no  i think i had enough  is that clear  
the gods eat the sacrifice 
they are grateful 
they give me some of their water 
and then i give it to you 
what 
does it work 
no  i mean  yes 
well  maurice 
ah  it s fifty fifty 
we ll do it 
excellent 
now all i need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano
and get eaten by gods 
any hands  hands  anybody 
i need someone  perhaps
who has never found love 
who could look death straight
in the eyeball  a real  genuine hero 
  i ll do it 
  melman 
hurry up  before we all
come to our senses 
melman  what is wrong with you 
i m dying anyway  if there s a chance
it ll get you water  it ll be worth it 
are you nuts 
gloria  i just want you to know
