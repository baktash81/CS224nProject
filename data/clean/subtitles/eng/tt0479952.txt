when we need water we build a dam
were new yorkers for crying out loud
if we can make it there

hey alakay i just happened to walk by
i thought id wish you luck
youre not nervous are you
nah its my thing you know its kinda what i do
in my opinion the key to this whole thing
is choosing the right competitor
oh you mean this is like
a dance battle sort of thing
like a danceoff
aa sure
great i love that freestyle
whod be a good match for me
just to keep things interesting
well i wish i could help
but thats strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred

oh no this is horrible
alakay has failed the test
who would have ever imagined
that today zuba would have to banish
his own son
zuba no
zuba yes
sadly the alpha lion
must cast out all failures
then im no longer the alpha lion
dad what are you doing
dad no you cant do this
who could possibly take zubas place
anyone
someone no one
you sir
i guess not
well i this is all very awkward
but i suppose i could carry
this tremendous burden
teetsi get the hat
as your new leader
i hereby banish alakay
he shall wear this hat of shame
and leave the watering hole
for a thousand years or life
whichever comes last
come on shoo shoo get out of here
you should have told us son
you should have told us
that you werent a real king
you never told me
id have to fight anybody
what did you expect son
i dont know maybe a little fatherly
advice like hey son its a fight
youre a lion arent you
but i never fought another lion in my life
no i guess not you dance
and other stuff the point is
your pal makunga set me up back there

the gods eat the sacrifice
they are grateful
they give me some of their water
and then i give it to you

does it work
