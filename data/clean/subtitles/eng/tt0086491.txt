it is sometimes said   
   that where there is no hope 
there is no life 
case in point 
the residents of sunnyvale rest home 
where hope is just a memory 
but hope just checked in to sunnyvale   
   disguised as an elderly optimist   
   who carries his magic
in a shiny tin can 
vitamin a is for the scalp 
the hair  vision and teeth 
vitamin b is for the  uh  hair
and mucous membrane 
vitamin c is for the circulatory system 
very important for that part 
and let s not forget calcium
for good strong bones and teeth 
before we get to that  though   
   i always recommend
a little lemon juice in the diet 
  yes  i take lemon juice  yeah 
good diet  healthy senior citizens 
now to e  this is an important one 
if you ve enjoyed healthy sex
throughout your life

continue to enjoy well into your 80 s

so long 
every second saturday he carries
those cases down to his kid s car 
and every second saturday

stretch  breathe 
the answer is   it s been
nicknamed  scourge of the sons of han

maybe he ll get mad at you 
like he did to his real sister   
   and take away your mouth

   together  we can master it   
   and learn from it 
use it in ways you never
thought of before 
i d like to be your teacher  anthony

ah 
all right 
look in your pocket 
never mind 
what you re looking at could be the end   
   of a particularly terrifying nightmare 
it isn t  it s the beginning 
introducing mr  john valentine 
air traveler 
his destination  the twilight zone 
ladies and gentlemen   
   this storm has developed
a little faster than we had anticipated 
we re maneuvering about 
finding the smoothest spots with radar 
there s a chance that we might hit
some whoopsie daisies   
   so i m asking you to return to your seats
and fasten seat belts 
please extinguish your cigarettes 
store anything that might fly about
the aircraft 
  look out the window and enjoy the flight 
  hello  in there 
can you hear me 
hello 
oh  hi  it s a passenger that s been
in there for a long time 
  tall  fair haired 
  yeah  yeah  seat 4a 
oh  valentine  had a feeling about him 
white knuckle type 
  how are we gonna get him out 
  is something wrong 
  everything s fine  return to your seat 
  mr  valentine  may i help you 
just a moment 
dionne  why don t you knock 
something could be wrong 
let s give him a few more minutes 
are you okay 
no problem 
mr  valentine  i know how you feel 
lots of people are nervous about flying 
but if you look at statistics 
you re safer up here than on the ground 
  that s right  safer than your bathroom 
  oh  i ll be perfectly fine 
okay 
everything s gonna be fine 
we re gonna help you back to your seat 
actually  the chances of drowning
in the bathtub   
   is something like
800 thousandths of a percent 
whereas air crash fatalities 
from last year s figures   
   the number of passengers
who traveled last year   
   is equal to the population
of the whole country 
  okay  i got you 
  that s 426 504 000 
i forgot the rest specifically 
who died actually at home 
they outnumber the people much more 
and  whereas driving   
driving  just forget it 
i mean  the percentage
of people who die driving 
  twenty two  23 percent of   
here you go  mr  valentine

no smoking 
oh  my god 
there s something out there 
there s something moving 
i m sure i saw it 
  out there on the wing 
where 
  there s a man on the wing of this plane 
what 
where 
there s a man   
where 
i don t see   
of course there isn t anything 
there was somebody there 
you ve gotta believe me 
i saw him  green and slimy 
  leave the poor man alone 
  i m only trying to help 
you ve got to humor them 
it was lightning 
at first i thought it was an animal 
some kind of bird or something 
but it was a man 
there was flames coming out
of the engine   
   and then a flash and then smoke 
maybe it was a technician who was
caught on the plane when it took off 
how could he survive out there 
the air s too thin 
the blast of the wind 
it s so cold 
it s impossible  isn t it 
my god  i feel so stupid 
can you imagine 
a naked man crawling along
the wing of an airplane at 35 000 feet 
there s no reason to feel embarrassed 
mr  valentine 
just try to get some sleep 
it s amazing  the mind 
how the eyes can make you see something
that isn t even there 
there s a man in seat 3f
who s completely freaking out 
you re just gonna have to deal with him 
it s all right 
you don t have to stay with me 
i know you have other passengers
to attend to 
  i d be happy to sit with you till you sleep 
  no 
it s probably easier for me if i m alone 
  are you sure 
  i m sure 
i m drowsy already 
see  ha  ha 
okay 
hostess  get the handcuffs 
i saw it  i saw it 
i m all right  i m all right  i m all right 
don t touch me  don t touch me 
let him up 
faa security 
you want me to take care of this 
no  he ll be all right 
you ve gotta land this plane 
look  just take your seat 
can you get this together here  please 
get everybody to sit down 
sit down  get in your seats 
i want all the passengers
in their seats 
you ve got to get out of the sky 
thank you

  it s all right  deep breaths 
  you know where you are 
  yes  you gotta get us on the ground 
  take care of the little girl

  what has she done this time 
take deep breaths  mr  valentine 
deep  long breaths 
that s it  slow  relax 
that s it 
we re safe 
we re gonna have a little talk 
now  what seems to be the problem 
would you look out that window  please 
what was i supposed to see out there 
nothing 
nothing at all  i m sorry i shouted 
mr  valentine 
you ve got to see this my way 
i m the first officer of an airplane
in a severe storm 
now  i have an irrational passenger 
you re threatening the safety of this aircraft
and frightening the passengers 
you either calm down
or we re gonna handcuff you 
listen  there is something wrong
with this airplane 
if somebody doesn t do something about it 
we re all gonna die 
that s d i e  die 
you big silly 
you used to be a normal person 
shelly 
  sit down  darling  come on  okay 
mr  valentine 
what do you think s wrong
with this aircraft 
there s an engine out 
which one 
the one on the outside 
outboard number 1 
it s out  isn t it 
  what makes you think that 
  never mind about that  it s true  isn t it 
nine minutes ago 
outboard 1 was struck by lightning 
  there was a flameout and we lost it 
  lightning 
lightning 
mr  valentine 
this aircraft has four engines 
the possibility of us losing one
of the remaining three is remote 
are you sure it was just lightning 
absolutely 
listen  we re gonna be landing
in about 20 minutes 
there is the highest probability
that we ll survive this flight 
okay 
we ll see you downstairs in 20 minutes 
sit down 
buckle them up 
are you okay 
no  no  no  no 
i love you  baby 
hail mary  full of grace 
the lord is with thee 
oh  my god 
we re gonna die 
please  sir 
would you please just take your seat 
nothing  nothing  help 
sir  sir 
mommy  mommy

that s very bad manners  you know 
didn t anyone ever
teach you manners  huh 
come on  come on 
we re all gonna die 
damn 
my gun 
oh  my god  he s got a gun 
and that s exactly how it happened 
i m practically a hero 
would you believe that 
if that weather hadn t broke   
   we would have never have gotten
this baby down 
what a hell of a night 
we got the storm  we got the flameout 
and then that freak show 
not to mention the gun 
the gun was awful 
  he didn t have a gun 
  he had a gun 
no  no  no  he didn t have a gun 
it was my gun 
  i m faa  i m authorized to have a gun 
  he was so crazy 
he smashed the window 
what was he trying to do  get out 
it s claustrophobia 
they d rather fall to the ground
than stay aboard 
  i ve seen it happen  i ve seen it 
  you d have to be wacko 
he was frightened 
but i didn t think he was crazy 
but he said he saw something
out on the wing alive 
max  we lost number 1 
check out number 2  will you 
somebody give me a light 
i want the gear pinned 
  let s chock these tires 
right 
franco  let me know what s going on
with these flaps 
i wanna know if there s any fuel
leaking out of this baby 
and get these people out of here 
yeah  that s fine  maxie 
everything s okay here  max 
max  max  max 
holy toledo 
hey  you guys  what happened up there 
that s enough of that noise  huh 
who needs it anyway 
how about a little music 
sure 
hey  that s   
that s   
i love creedence 
so you had a big scare up there  huh 
oh  yeah 
wanna see something really scary 
there is a fifth dimension
beyond that which is know to man 
it is the middle ground
between light and shadow   
   between science and superstition
