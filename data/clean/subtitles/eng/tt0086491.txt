it is sometimes said
that where there is no hope
there is no life
case in point
the residents of sunnyvale rest home
where hope is just a memory
but hope just checked in to sunnyvale
disguised as an elderly optimist
who carries his magic
in a shiny tin can
vitamin a is for the scalp
the hair vision and teeth
vitamin b is for the uh hair
and mucous membrane
vitamin c is for the circulatory system
very important for that part
and lets not forget calcium
for good strong bones and teeth
before we get to that though
i always recommend
a little lemon juice in the diet
yes i take lemon juice yeah
good diet healthy senior citizens
now to e this is an important one
if youve enjoyed healthy sex
throughout your life
theres no reason why you cant
continue to enjoy well into your 80s

theres a man
where
i dont see
of course there isnt anything
there was somebody there
youve gotta believe me
i saw him green and slimy
leave the poor man alone
im only trying to help
youve got to humor them
it was lightning
at first i thought it was an animal
some kind of bird or something
but it was a man
there was flames coming out
of the engine
and then a flash and then smoke
maybe it was a technician who was
caught on the plane when it took off
how could he survive out there
the airs too thin
the blast of the wind
its so cold
its impossible isnt it
my god i feel so stupid
can you imagine
a naked man crawling along
the wing of an airplane at 35000 feet
theres no reason to feel embarrassed
mr valentine
just try to get some sleep
its amazing the mind
how the eyes can make you see something
that isnt even there
theres a man in seat 3f
whos completely freaking out
youre just gonna have to deal with him
its all right
you dont have to stay with me
i know you have other passengers
to attend to
id be happy to sit with you till you sleep
