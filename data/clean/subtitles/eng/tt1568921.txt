haru    how many times
have i told her 
  i ll be right back 
  okay 
haru 
you re blocking the driveway again 
sho 
where are you 
don t touch 
these aren t for you 
  arrietty 
  what 
you went outside again  didn t you 
and you might clean up
this room  young lady 
it s my own little garden 
if you ask me 
it looks like a mess 
oh  is that a bay leaf 
oh well  i guess this means
your birthday comes early 
enough for a whole year 
but the bay tree s
so far away 
if a human bean saw you   
i m always careful 
the world is full of
dangerous creatures 
your great uncle   
    was eaten by a frog  right 
doesn t that shiso smell lovely 
yes  it does 
with a bit of sugar
i could make shiso juice 
wait till tonight 
i ll borrow some for you 
my first borrowing ever 
i ve been practicing night and day 
papa s home 
welcome back 
  papa  about tonight   
  there s a boy in the house 
i saw him 
  no  arrietty   
  he didn t see me 
i hid behind the bay leaf 
papa  we re still going  aren t we 
i won t hear of it 
it s too dangerous 
but he s just a child 
papa  i ve been waiting
for such a long time 
the children can be more savage
than the grownups 
i ll be fine 
youngsters go to bed early 
thank you papa 
but pod   
the boy s sick 
don t worry  we ll be fine 
but still   
stop worrying  mother 
we ll be extra careful 
arrietty will be 14 soon 
someday she ll have to
survive without our help 
sometimes i think
we re the last borrowers in the world 
whatever you need 
just ask haru 
all right 
haru  i m depending on you 
yes ma am 
let s shut the screen 
keep the bugs out 
shouldn t you wear something darker 
i already decided 
i hope you can borrow
some tissue paper 
and a bit of sugar  perhaps 
we could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea 
but anything s just fine 
we ll be back soon 
please be careful 
we will 
arrietty 
sorry 
  hold these for me 
  yes  papa 
hold on tight 
arrietty 
ready 
everything s so huge 
the world of human beans 
the sugar s over there 
wait for me down there 
papa  you re great 
now let s get that tissue 
papa  look 
your first borrowing 
be careful  it s sharp 
i will 
papa  borrowing is such fun 
look down there 
rats  steer clear of them 
they re trouble 
i m not afraid 
i m ready for anything 
i ve got this 
sometimes it s best not to
go looking for danger 
what is this place 
human beans made it
for their dolls 
it s just perfect for us 
i m sure mother would love
that dresser over there 
these things aren t for borrowing 
if anything went missing
they d know right away 
oh   
don t be afraid 
i saw you 
in the garden 
it was you  wasn t it 
my mother told me about you 
she saw little people here
when she was young 
was it you that she saw 
was it 
i m sorry  papa 
he saw me today 
out in the garden 
i should ve been more careful 
i hope he didn t frighten you 
best not tell your mother 
it will only worry her 
all right 
you don t always have to run 
observe them first  then decide 
we re home 
safe and sound 
and    
things didn t go well this time 
this light gave out
before we finished 
oh dear 
we had to give up
on the sugar 
don t give it a thought 
at least you re safe and sound 
arrietty  you found something 
show your mother your first borrowing 
what a pretty pin 
time for bed 
good night 
she looks worn out 
shall i make some tea 
sho 
come in the house 
you ll catch cold out there 
a cube of sugar 
but whatever for 
he left it by the grating 
it s probably the same one
i dropped last night 
what 
what do you mean 
you dropped it 
don t touch it 
do you understand 
it s a trap 
they re trying to catch us 
we ll have to stop borrowing
for a while 
maybe they already
know where we are 
pod  we ll have to move 
this was such a lovely house 
now we ll have to
start all over again 
well  let s see how things go 
now eat  soup s getting cold 
why did it have to be sugar 
thank you arrietty 
i wanted to hang everything
while the sun s out 
you know i love doing laundry 
  i m going to nap for a bit 
  all right 
 you forgot something 
you came back 
wait  don t go 
please leave us alone 
i wanted to tell you that 
i want to talk to you 
human beans are dangerous 
if we re seen  we have to leave 
my parents said so 
you have a family 
i envy you 
don t you have one 
yes  but i practically
never see my father 
mother s so busy at work 
she barely has time for me 
really   
my name s sho 
what s your name 
do you have one 
of course i have a name 
it s arrietty 
arrietty    arrietty   
that s pretty 
won t you let me see you 
just for a moment 
just a peek  please 
what s happening 
oh my gosh  it s a crow 
you can t come in here 
what got into that bird 
they never behave like that 
maybe it s nesting season
or something 
now i have to replace this screen 
where do we keep them 
are you all right 
maybe you should take
some of your medicine 
thanks  haru 
i feel fine 
the nesting season  eh 
have yourself
a nice long rest now 
papa   
  i told you to stay away 
  i m sorry 
i wanted to do
something to help 
but he didn t see me 
you put your family in danger 
i won t say it again 
understand 
yes 
we d better start looking 
it s time 
pod   
 you forgot something 
afternoon  package for you 
thanks again ma am 
it s pretty hot out there 
listen  know any good
pest control companies 
pest control 
here s one   squeaky klean service  
squeaky klean service 
let me just write that down 
haying problems with mice 
maybe it s mice 
or maybe it s something else 
between us  it s little people 
i ve seen them myself 
a crow tried to
fly into your room 
i hope it didn t scare you 
don t worry  aunt sadako 
haru chased it out 
i was so astonished 
i never saw such a huge   
excitement s the worst thing
in the world for his heart 
he came here for peace and quiet 
if anything were to happen
before the operation   
i know  i know 
i realize his mother s
terribly busy at work 
but to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child 
it must be terribly hard for you
without your mother 
i don t mind 
i suppose the divorce
couldn t be helped 
but why can t she be here 
when he needs her so 
aunt sadako  who made
that little house in my room 
it s amazing 
you mean the doll house 
that doll house
belongs to your mother 
she left it here
when she moved out 
it was hers 
my father had it
made to order in england 
it was for the little people 
my father claimed he d seen them 
he waited for so many years 
he always said that house
was a present for them 
but i m afraid they never
showed themselves again 
not in my father s lifetime 
nor in mine 
young master  did you happen to see
any little people in your room 
unfortunately    no 
it s been in our family
for four generations 
if you like it 
it will be yours someday 
you mean it 
yes 
have you looked inside 
it s quite beautiful 
  haru  could you turn off the lights 
  yes m 
this is the living room 
all the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker 
isn t it wonderful 
here s the library on the first floor 
there s even a bathroom 
but the next room
is my personal favorite 
haru  could you open that up 
let s see 
i think it opens this way 
everything is so detailed 
detailed and just like
the real thing 
that s a real oven 
you could use it for baking 
beautiful  just beautiful 
what a pity father s dream
never came true 
and it s been so long   
maybe the little people
are gone now 
mother  we ve had
these pictures three years 
don t you want new ones 
i love those pictures 
i ve always dreamed
i d see the real ocean someday 
besides  there s no point
changing them now 
papa s later than usual 
i hope he didn t get caught
in that downpour 
  papa 
  that s the back door 
papa  welcome back   
twisted my leg 
it s lucky spiller found me 
pod 
oh dear  you re hurt 
hurry  bring him in 
does it hurt 
it s not broken 
i ll be fine in no time 
i ll get some cold water 
here s a towel  better dry off 
who s this 
it s not just the
three of us after all 
gotta go 
wait  at least stay
and have some tea 
i ll see to your father 
get spiller a cup of tea 
thank you spiller 
papa s so lucky you came along 
we re so grateful for your help 
listen  have you seen
other borrowers 
you see  we thought
we might be the only ones left 
this many 
then cousin lupy must be okay 
can i see your bow 
you use this for hunting 
give that back 
it s not a toy 
subtitle by
aldi arman
gotta go 
won t you stay
and have a bite 
got this 
a cricket s leg 
want some  it s real good 
no thanks 
take care 
thanks again 
i ll see him out 
you were looking
for a new place 
i tripped and fell  couldn t move 
then spiller came 
really   
his territory reaches past the river 
and he knows a few
places we could live 
that s good i suppose 
i d hate to camp out 
but i doubt we ll find anything
quite as nice as this 
i m glad there are
still others like us 
do you have friends
and family  spiller 
family  no  just me 
well  i hope you
can come again 
my mother s stew
is the best in the world 
haru 
arrietty  your stitches
need to be closer together 
pull it apart and do it again 
why do we need
such a big sack anyway 
i m going to look in on papa 
papa  can i come in 
how s your leg 
i ll be walking soon 
papa 
are we going to move 
we were seen 
we ve no choice but to move 
i don t think every
human bean is dangerous 
arrietty   
before you were born  there were
two other families living in this house 
one family went missing 
they just disappeared 
the other one moved away 
they were seen by humans 
no matter what happens 
we ve got to survive 
papa   
what in heaven s name 
is this an earthquake 
mother 
it won t open 
the frame s buckled 
the    the wall 
homily 
homily 
i always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this 
gather only the things we need 
we can t carry all that 
and homily  take nothing
from the doll house 
i ll make sure it s safe 
  stay with your mother 
  yes papa 
you finally came 
do you like your new kitchen 
our house is a disaster 
but it doesn t matter 
i came to say goodbye 
can i look 
you re beautiful 
we have to move 
we were seen 
borrowers aren t meant to be seen 
borrowers    
we borrow from human beans 
things we need 
things they won t miss 
soap and cookies and sugar 
electricity and gas  too 
even my great grandfather
was a borrower 
no one ever saw them 
probably 
it s all my fault 
niya  don t be like that 
be nice to her 
are there other little people
like you in the house 
no  it s just my father
and mother and me 
what about in other houses 
i m sure there are some 
i ve only met one so far 
oh 
soon you ll be the only one left 
every year there s fewer of you  right 
you re a doomed species  you know 
that s not true 
there s lots more of us 
spiller said so 
spiller 
he s one of us 
and he said there s lots more 
do you know how many people
there are in the world 
there are 6 7 billion of us 
six point seven billion    
what about you 
i don t know 
there s probably
just a few of you 
until my mom told me 
i didn t know little people existed 
lots of species
are already extinct 
i ve only seen them
in books  though 
so many beautiful species   
but the environment changed 
so they died out 
it s sad  but that s what fate
has in store for your kind 
fate  you say 
you re the one who changed things 
now we have to move away 
we have to survive 
that s what papa said 
so we re leaving 
even though it s dangerous 
we ll make do  we always have 
you don t know anything about us 
we re not going
to die out that easily 
i m sorry 
you re right 
i m the one
who s going to die 
it s my heart 
they re going to operate
next week  but it s probably hopeless 
your heart    
i ve always been sick 
i can t play like other kids 
from the moment i saw you 
i wanted to protect you 
i can t even do that 
i hope you can forgive me 
i didn t know
you were so sick 
what in the world
is this doing here 
it s the kitchen
from the doll house 
found you 
what s wrong 
my mother    i heard her voice 
this really is a great kitchen 
you re not the only
little one here  i bet 
i have to go 
let me out  help me 
the ceiling s tilted 
hello  squeaky klean service 
can you make
an urgent house call 
there s something small
in the house  no  not mice 
not mice 
i don t want them killed 
you need trapping services 
yes  that s it 
i want you to trap them 
sho  sho 
arrietty

momma

around first 
take your time 
now who can this be 
haru  haru 
what s going on here 
it s finally happened 
the little people are here 
little people 
that s right 
and what little thieves they are 
it s really true 
they steal from
all over the house 
that s why things
were going missing 
haru  what s gotten into you 
all these years i thought
it was my imagination 
well  it wasn t 
you certainly didn t need
to call the exterminators 
we d better hurry 
the house is full of them 
you ll believe me
when you see this 
this is their nest 
nest 
it looks like a pile
of old junk to me

the exterminators away 
now  wait just a minute 
the doll house 
young master  may we come in
for a minute

such a pleasure to look at 
wait  i can prove it 
i have one of them in a jar 
i wonder what s gotten into haru 
hmm 
fresh herbs  how lovely 
someone was making tea 
it s just as my father said 
there are little people living here 
yes  there are 
so haru really saw them 
though she accused them of stealing 
they re not thieves at all 
they re borrowers 
i mean  i wish
i could see them 
i bet they re here somewhere 
i m sure they are 
excuse me  ma am 
where d you like us to start 
are you all right 
it got away 
i had one and it got away 
it s not just my imagination 
there are little people here 
next time i swear
i ll get them 
how far is it to where
we re meeting spiller 
it s just outside the forest 
then we head down river 
i m already worn out 
i ll never make it that far 
let s hurry 
i can t do it   
better have something to eat 
we ll be walking till morning 
what 
i m so sorry 
it s my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house 
that s in the past 
we ll make another wonderful house 
the three of us together
