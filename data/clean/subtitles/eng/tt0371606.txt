i m not making this up 
i know it s here 
there s a piece
of the sky somewhere   
   somewhere
on the ground here 
it was shaped like that 
  it looks like a stop sign 
  yes 
only it doesn t say  stop 
and it s blue and it has a cloud on it 
and it hit me on the head 
  it looked like a stop sign 
  wait  what s that 
  son  is this what hit you

no  dad  it was definitely
a piece of the sky 
piece of the sky

it was just an acorn that hit my son 
a little acorn 
  no  dad  no 
  quiet  son 
this is embarrassing enough already 
chicken little 
what were you thinkin  
why put your town s safety
in jeopardy 
how could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn 
  but it    a big acorn level fluh 
  what did he say 
  a big acorn level fluh   
  it was a big acorn 
  it was an ape throwing coleslaw 
  a big acorn level fluh   
gesundheit 
ladies and gentlemen 
it s just gibberish 
  gibberish of an insane person 
  come on  buck 
your kid went and
scared us all half to death 
well  what can i tell you  folks 
my son 
you know    kids do crazy stuff 
you have kids  it s   
no  dad  it wasn t an acorn 
it was    it was a piece of the sky 
really  it was 
you gotta believe me 
a movie  a movie 
they re makin  a movie 
when  when will everybody
forget your big mistake 
first it was all over the papers 
then they wrote a book about it 
then the book on tape 
then the board game 
the spoons with your face on it   
and then the web site 
the commemorative plates 
  you saw them  right 
  i saw them 
can t eat off  em 
  they re not microwave safe 
  you saw the billboards 
i saw them 
there s a bumper sticker 
i knew it was only a matter of time 
billboards i could live with 
posters i could even live with 
but a bumper sticker 
it s    it s like glued on forever 
it doesn t matter  you know why 
because i ve got a plan 
yeah  about that 
well  remember how i told you
it would be better
for you to lay low 
don t call attention to yourself 
  yes  but i   
  see  it s like a game 
yeah  a game of hide and seek  except
the goal is never to be found  ever 
great  now 
we ve got a plan  right 
i ll see ya later 
remember  lay low 
yeah  ok 
bye 
look  mama 
there s the crazy chicken 
yes  it is  crazy chicken  you re so
smart  we don t make eye contact  bye 
that s it  today is a new day 
it was a recipe for disaster
a four course meal of  no sirree 
it seemed that happily ever after
was happy everyone was after me
it was a cup of good intentions
a tablespoon of one big mess
a dash of overreaction
and i assume you know the rest
one little slip
one little slip
it was a fusion of confusion
with a few confounding things
i guess i probably took
the wrong direction
well i admit i might ve
missed a sign or two
i took a right turn at confusion
a left when i should ve gone
straight on through
i ran ahead with my assumptions
and we all know
what that can do
one little slip
it was a fusion of confusion
and a few confounding things
i get the feeling in this town
i ll never live  til i live down
the one mistake that seems
to follow me around
but they ll forget about the sky
when they all realize
this guy s about to try
to learn to fly
or hit the ground
how s it going 
it was a cup of good intentions
a tablespoon of one big mess
a dash of overreaction
and i assume you know the rest
one little slip
one little slip
it was a humble little stumble
with a big ungraceful
one little slip
it was a fusion of confusion
with a few confounding things
very well  foxy loxy

  but  it s   
what s got to happen now is
the nut needs to be cracked open 
and not one little chip
at a time  but    bam 
smash  bits of emotion flying
everywhere  anger  frustration 
denial  fear  deep depression  in fact 
you see what i m saying 
all right  forget the nut part 
here s the main thing 
you have got to stop messing around 
and deal with the problem 
  but   
  here s the real solution

 stop the squawk and try the talk   
beautiful duckling says 
 avoiding closure with your
parents can cause early molting   
see  closure 
come on  repeat after me 
you  your dad  talk talk

in the air  ladies and gentlemen 
it s been two decades since
oakey oaks has beaten rivals
the spud valley taters 
down by only a single run 
with a player in scoring position 
we finally have a chance again 
this excitement isn t about
the fun of baseball  the prize

this battle has taken a heavy toll
on our hometown heroes 
after nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries 
the acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster 
hopefully  there s just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win 
up next    chicken little 
clearly a long shot  folks 
little hasn t been up to bat once
since joining the team 
  he s gonna lose the game for us 
  but wait

and advance to first  that powerhouse 
foxy loxy can step up
and save us all

nervous  gangly  barely able to hold
the pine  little advances to the box 
he s going to bat from the right 
make it the left  no  the right

  easy out 
looks like left field s
found something better to do 
center field s got a hunger pang
in his second stomach
  and right field s digging for grubs 
  play ball 
why him  why now 
i won t embarrass you  dad 
not this time 
here s the wind up  the pitch 
it s a high cutter

here s the pitch 
curve ball low and outside  he swings 
strike two

i ve never said these words before 
but he s actually
rounding home plate 
  goosey loosey steps on home   
  today s a new day 
we have a tie game 
they re scrambling in the alley 
looks like rodriguez has it 
nope  it s the center fielder 
mayhem in the outfield 
as rodriguez is fired to second 
catch is complete 
but where s the ball 
little touches the bag
and keeps going  a hunt for the rock 
the fielders are having trouble 
commotion out there 
  it s stuck  it s stuck 
  tip the cow 
it s the old tip the cow play 
the kid heads for the hot corner 
a stand up triple 
  yes 
  hold up  no 
he s going for the whole enchilada 
the ball of wax 
kit and the caboodle 
go back 
you re never gonna make it 
he s trying to lighten his load 
the outfield behind 
little s on all cylinders 
he slides for the dish 
it s going to be a photo finish at home 
you re out 
oh  folks 
folks  what a heartbreaker 
  wait 
  wait  wait 
wait a cotton picking second 
hold your horses  here 
and horses hold your breath 
this might not be over  he

moment  the smells  the sounds 
there s a new winner in town
and his name is chicken little 
that was just a lucky hit

of the world
here s the wind up and the pitch 
  a knuckleball 
  he swings 
  crack 
  it s going 
  he rounds first  to second 
  it hits high off the wall 
he flies past third
and heads for the plate 
it s a scramble for the ball 
it s gonna be close
