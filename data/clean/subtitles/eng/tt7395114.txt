they probably couldn t point  em out
to you on a map 
but i guarantee 
they d be there all the same 
how and why so many people
from those two piddlin  places on that map
could end up connected
has a lot to do with our story 
some would claim it was just dumb luck 
while others might swear
it was god s intention 
but i d say
with the way things turned out 
it was a little bit of both 
in 1957  it d take someone
approximately ten hours
to drive from coal creek
to a paper mill town
in southern ohio called meade 
once you got to meade 
knockemstiff was only a short drive away 
four hundred or so people
lived in knockemstiff
in 1957 
nearly all of them connected by blood
by one godforsaken calamity or another 
be it lust or necessity
or just plain ignorance 
the russells had rented the house on top
of the mitchell flats for nine years now 
but most of the neighbors down below
still considered them outsiders 
hey  dad 
you re coming with me today  boy 
years ago 
willard had fitted together
a weathered cross above a fallen tree
in a small clearing behind his house 
he came every morning and evening
to talk to god 
it seemed to his son that his father
fought the devil all the time 
now  you pray on   
what happened today 
now  remember  be honest 
no bullshittin   he ll know 
when he prayed 
his mind would often drift back
to the war in the south pacific
and the day that he and a couple
of other soldiers came across the body
of gunnery sergeant miller jones 
holy shit 
fuck 
what s it say 
miller jones 
fuck 
we gotta do something 
the japs just left him up there 
next stop  meade  ohio

the man whose seat he took
would also meet his match

i ain t gonna sleep tonight as it is 
i wish helen left with us 
well  she might have come with us 
if you d paid her a little more attention 
the right man

emma was concerned
something bad might happen
if she couldn t keep her promise to god 
helen did  in fact  meet the man
she would marry that afternoon

welling up inside him now 
the urge to get right with his maker
before something bad
happened to his family 
where d you go 
i was just looking the land over

 gene dinwoodie 
tommy matson  and orville buckman

arvin loved her like his own sister 
  sister fucker 
  he would do anything to protect her 
no matter what the weather was 
lenora would visit her mother s grave
after school 
some days
she d even read the bible out loud 
and imagine her mother was listening 
though he wasn t one for praying
arvin would often drive her
and keep her company 
arvin 
it was a sight
you didn t end up in the hospital 
yeah  well  there s a lot of no good
sons of bitches out there 
well  lord  arvin  you ve been saying that
almost since the day i met you

maybe you should try praying for  em then 
would that hurt none 
you already do enough for all of us 
and where s it doing you much good  huh 
you know what would do you good 
to not be wandering behind school
by your own self  like i told you 
fuckin  gene dinwoodie 
do you ever think about   
how we ended up orphans
living in the same house 
no 
besides  you might not even be an orphan 
as far as everybody
around here is concerned
your daddy s probably still out there
somewhere alive and kicking 
fuck  he might even come over that hill
any day now  dancing a jig 
i hope so 
i pray every day he will 
even if it means he did something 
i ve already forgiven him

 emma was known
as one of the best cooks in the county 
when people praised her food 
she always told them
that she couldn t fry an egg
until she found the lord 
and that he was the one
that guided her hand
and made everything turn out good 
all right 
my heart s in my stomach 
that hat  you know better 
hello there 
pleased to meet you  reverend 
emma russell 
nice to meet you too  what you got there

from the chicken livers
around in his mouth 
he felt the stirrings
of a sermon coming on 
blessed   
are they who hunger   
and thirst   
for righteousness 
hope you like them  reverend 
 preston loved
the way people listened to him
and held onto every word 
hmm 
he was grateful
his mother decided all those years ago
that he was going to be a preacher 
he d never win a fist fight 
but he could recite
the book of revelation in his sleep 
friends   
there s no doubt   
we re all humble people gathered here 
  amen 
  amen 
y all have been awful nice to me

of my heart for the welcome 
yes

the poor soul   
that brung in them chicken livers
on that beat up plate   
let s just say i m inspired to preach
on it for a minute before we eat 
sure   
some of us are better off than others 
and i see   
plenty of white meat and red meat
laid out on this table 
and i suspect that the folks
that carried them platters in
  eat mighty good sometimes 
  yes  sir 
but poor people   
got to bring what they can afford 
so them organs   
is a sign to me   
telling me that i should 
as the new preacher of this church 
sacrifice myself 
so that y all can have a share
of the good meat tonight 
and that s what i m going to do  friends 
i m going to eat these organs 
 cause i model myself
on the good lord jesus
whenever he gives me the chance 
and today   
he s blessed me with another opportunity
  to follow in his footsteps 
  amen 
now  don t you worry
about that pus gutted blowhard 
i bet he ain t got two nickels
to rub together 
i never been
so embarrassed in all my life 
i could ve crawled right under the table 
  all right  i m gonna go talk to him 
  no  arvin 
none of that 
he sure ain t the preacher
i was hoping for 
grandma  that ain t no preacher 
he s as bad as they got on the damn radio 
heck  i bet he just wanted
them chicken livers all for his own self 
that s why he did that 
you see the way he was gobbling them down 
you shouldn t talk like that  arvin 
preacher teagardin wouldn t be here
if the lord hadn t sent him 
whoo  lenora 
hey  chicken shit 
that preacher s a little flashy 
are you not coming 
no  i got some things to do
before we go home 
can t we go do them after i see mama 
no  you go on  i ll be back 
go on 
   stand on the verge
of a big breakthrough 
god has said in the next few years 
we stand on the verge of paradise 
but there s something wrong 
and i m gonna tell you 
we ve got to have prayer power
and spiritual power 
in south vietnam 
soldiers fight with arms 
but now our spirit   
who is it out there 
lenora laferty  preacher teagardin 
girl  you been crying 
it s nothing 
i just get down sometimes   
uh   
the kids at school  they like to tease 
and i ain t gonna have family there
come next year 
i was like you when i was your age 
full of the lord 
some of them other kids just   
came down hard on me 
what did you do about it 
well   
it was a rough time 
they was just jealous 
envy 
brings out the worst in people 
especially the young ones 
i don t know
if you have anywhere you gotta be 
but  uh   
maybe we can take a drive 
there s a quiet place i found
i like to go and pray on things 
like his father years before 
arvin had always been careful
about picking his time 
he knew he d stand a better chance
if he didn t try to take on
all the dirty bastards at once 
what was that 
nothing 
it must not have got shut all the way 
let s get them bloomers off  come on 
you    close that door 
goddamn better be worth it 
you piece of shit 
stop it 
motherfucker 
hey  orville  will you start it up  man 
i don t think it s the spark plugs 
hey   
no  hey  gene  you want another twinkie 
i m all right  thank you 
wait   
wait  i m sorry  i m sorry 
want your fuckin  twinkie now 
is that what you want 
no 
you touch my sister again   
i ll kill you 
do you understand me 
yes 
  do you understand me 
  i m so sorry 
now  we can feel the lord our here 
can t we 
it s kind of you to come all this way 
lenora   
have you truly opened yourself
to the lord with   
preacher sykes or   
any other preacher 
once   
reverend sykes wept with me 
hmm 
that s not my meaning 
have you shown yourself
as the lord made you 
you mean in my birthday suit  no 
  no 
  no 
to show yourself
as the lord made his first children 
is to truly turn yourself to him   
and his witnessing of it 
now  that s courage itself 
meaning i take off my clothes 
come on and pray with me 
lord  lenora is showing herself to you 
see her  lord 
as you made her 
she presents herself to you now 
give her the strength 
we are together
before the lord 
amen 
amen 
sorry i didn t come today 
it s okay 
i know there s other things
you wanna be doing probably 
so  i can come on my own from now on 
 like her mother years ago 
lenora felt the same force
that drew helen to roy laferty 
the girl imagined that she could touch
the love emanating from the preacher 
thirty three to athens 
50 to clarksville   
seventy nine north to pittsburgh 
thirty three  50  79 
thirty three  50  79 
thirty three  50  79

that young  good looking hitchhikers
were the best 
what the fuck is going on out here

lee  ain t nothin  there 
let me by 
lawman 
when the man who puts extra money
in your pockets asks why you re as red
as a newborn baby 
you tell him who the whore is 
bodecker believed
people were like dogs 
once they start digging 
they don t wanna stop 
first  it would just be
that the sheriff had a whore for a sister 
and after that  all the bribes
and other shit that had piled up
since he d first pinned on a badge 
and if he wasn t careful 
eventually someone would find out
about his own dealings with leroy 
my boy  my boy 
  it s been a while 
  yeah 
  whatcha having  honey 
  coffee  ain t staying long 
you got a new toy 
it s an english firearm

untraceable 
untraceable

me losing money
is gonna cost you your cut 
it didn t have anything to do with you 
it does now 
bobo  you ever go and beat the shit
outta someone i made my money off

never crossed my mind 
thinking about that 
guy running against me
is going door to door
telling folk i look the other way
when it comes to sandy 
bobo  don t eat my scraps 
give over the envelope 
there s debt you owe me 
what i m gonna lose at the bar 
horse shit

and you know that
 cause you re a loaded diaper
like everyone else who works for me
or because all of meade
knows you re dirty 
that s your weekly earnings
 til we re square 
now  get the fuck out of my diner 
bodecker knew
that leroy and his errand boy bobo
would kill him soon enough
if he made any more trouble 
he had an election to think about
and couldn t afford any liabilities 
my bar is off limits and so is
your whore sister  you understand

  i told you i don t like this anymore 
ain t it fair
if i hate the way some of  em cry 
not that you d appreciate it 
but tears make for a good photograph 
what sandy didn t understand
was that to his way of thinking

only in the presence of death
could he feel the presence
of something like god 
no  no  no 
please  please  please 
don t you    don t you touch
that fuckin  camera there  son 
the sick fuck 
how about we check into a motel 
get a couple of steaks 
and relax for a day or two 
how does that sound 
private gary matthew bryson
won t be reporting to fort eustis 
but he ain t a coward 
he went and got himself killed 
buried by the mechums river
in west virginia 
chopped up pretty bad in a suitcase 
no  i won t speak to nobody else 
i ve heard of cases
in my reading
about sin
where someone got so sick   
over some sin
they felt
they had committed that was so terrible
that they   
started imagining things 
back  i read a story about   
people 
poor people 
barely
able to write   
thinking they re   
the president
or   
or a hollywood celebrity
like ava gardner 
i   
i don t understand
what you re talking about 
the thing is  that s the part of it 
the book says   
it s not 
not understanding 
see  think about it 
how   
could i be
the daddy   
when all we done
is spend time with the lord 
late night 
played cards
over at elder stubbs s garage again 
you win this time 
no  not really 
saw fred dinwoodie over there 
he said his boy is just about healed up 
i still think
you could have held back a little bit 
well  he ain t bothered lenora since 
him or his candy ass buddies 
i gotta go check in on her 
she ain t been feeling too good 
you keep an eye on her for me
while we re at church 
lenora had stopped asking arvin
to join her at helen s grave 
he didn t mind much 
his mind
would always drift back to willard
and the prayer log and his poor dog jack 
besides  he d gotten a job
working on the road crew
and was busy making some money 
i never missed church before 
i m so ashamed 
you ain t got nothing to be ashamed of 
i m sure the lord will forgive you
for missing one sunday 
ol  jesus probably had
his fair share of bad mornings 
i love you  arvin 
how s about we  uh   
go see your mama s grave
when you re better 
sound all right 
the good book   
is filled with good men
and women
suffering delusions 
eve in the garden 
noah   
naked  drunk 
bringing shame upon his family 
the idol
the jews bowed before in the desert 
and even the lord jesus himself
was presented with delusions in the desert
that only through his faith   
and his strength   
  overcame 
  mm hmm 
praise jesus 
the lord s delusion in the desert
was a game   
of the so called  devil  
and what the lord experienced   
was a delusion
that would ve kept him from saving us 
but he did not fall for it 
it is our delusions
that lead us to sin 
striking a mother or a wife
for something that you thought they said 
neglecting work or sunday service 
for that matter 
right  you said it 
some girl   
gets a feeling for a fella
and lets him have her holy gift 
delusions 
blaspheming the lord
in your mind and in your heart
for some wrong done to you
by another person 
that s true 
you re saying you don t   
remember all the things
we did in your car 
i m saying you must be crazy 
coming in the lord s house
and talking all this trash 
look  my advice to you  girl   
is you figure some way to get rid of it 
 cause otherwise   
it s gonna be you  a whore mother 
and her little bastard child
running around 
living in that poor old woman s house
who raised you 
if nothing else  think of her 
she ll die from the shame of it all 
come on 
come on 
lenora suddenly knew
she was making a mistake 
grandma wouldn t be ashamed
and she and her baby would be okay 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
no  no  no 
grandma 
grandma 
no  no  no 
grandma 
grandma 
no one would know
she wasn t a suicide
and that in the end 
she was all right with her maker 
oh  lord 
there s just some things
we can t understand 
but you take her into your arms 
uh  ain t somebody   
saying prayers or   
need to have a word with you  arvin 
  all right  see ya  buddy 
  yep 
see ya tomorrow 
about what 
it s  uh   
it s about lenora 
what about her 
i came by here instead of home
so nothing s   
put on your grandmother 
 put on   what do you mean 
well   
ol  dudley  in the coroner s   
i ain t never heard of no dudley 
well  he s a drunk   
but he ain t no liar 
did you know lenora was carrying a baby 
that s bullshit 
that son of a bitch is lying 
i tell ya   
dudley ain t a liar 
he came to me privately
so as your family knew 
i felt he was right 
now  i might ve put my foot
in something  it   
wasn t my intentions 
you know that preacher
ain t said no words for her 
not for people that kill themselves 
uncle   
arvin wanted so much
to be able to tell them goodbye 
but they would be better off
not knowing anything
if the law came looking for him 
you have to be good to grandma 
you know that she ain t hardly been out
of her bed since the funeral 
yeah 
grandma needs you 
all right 
dear grandma   
i m writing to you
because i cannot say goodbye to your face 
i love you and i will always remember
the things that you have done for me 
what i m about to do 
i do because i have to 
not because i want to 
please do not try and find me 
love  your grandson  arvin 
excuse me 
excuse me 
preacher 
got time for a sinner 
i ve been doing wrong
and i wanna get right by the lord 
well  that s what i m here for 
i ve done   
lustful acts 
yeah 
that could be a big problem 
especially for the young people 
go on  tell me about it 
i got me a pretty wife at home 
one that ll do pretty much anything i ask 
but i treat her real bad 
well  when you say anything 
what do you mean 
just what i said 
sometimes she ll be going down
on me with   
well  you know  her mouth 
heck  i get so excited i start forcing it 
she ever puke on you 
they got a little trigger 
back there in their throat 
yeah  well  that ain t my problem 
well  what s the problem then  son 
this guy i work with
has got himself a daughter 
real young thing 
just started high school 
one day i got this girl in my truck
and i drove her out into the sticks
and i   
had my way with her 
did she put up a fight 
no 
but  you see  the problem is  is   
once i d had a taste 
i just couldn t get enough 
i kept taking that girl there
any chance i got 
so i d strip her clothes off 
but i d make her pray
before we got started 
why don t you take that hat off  boy 
sometimes i d even   
keep her panties 
now  i d just   
sniff  em as she rode off on her bike 
and then i d go home
to that whore of a wife of mine
and make her bake me a cake
like i was celebrating 
what in the hell is this 
you ve been spying on me  boy 
i ve been watching your every move
for the last couple weeks 
you can t get enough
of that reaster girl  can you 
is that how you did my lenora too 
so   
mrs  russell s boy 
all right 
don t do anything you ll regret  son 
why don t you put the gun down and   
we can talk all about it 
go ahead and talk 
it wasn t my fault 
and lenora   
was just like this   
this reaster girl 
she wouldn t let me be 
but i want you to know that i   
i pray for that girl s soul
every night 
do you pray for her baby s soul too 
look  i didn t have   
nothing to do with that 
she came to me   
  saying she got that way from a boy   
  don t fuckin  lie to me 
lies   
the lies   
the lies are hers 
she got it in her head
that i was the father 
that i was gonna take care of everything 
god dammit  boy

for no bastard child 
it would ruin me  man

he had to get away from this place
or any he ever called home 
but in this moment  he felt a sudden force
pulling in back towards knockemstiff 
no matter what else happened

those things about his father
that still ate at his heart 
come on

jackie deshannon here on kbwb 
jackie first toured with the beatles   
 bobo  go there do this

huh 
   at hopkins automotive 
and now  for the wixy sports scoreboard 
carl

  carl 
  just   
  god dammit  carl 
he s going to ohio

where you headed 
meade  ohio  you heard of it 
the paper mill town  right 
yeah  that s right 
we re passing right through it 
what you going to meade for 
  just visiting 
  got family there 
no  i used to live there a long time ago 
well  probably ain t changed much 
little towns never do 
where is it y all live 
in chesterfield 
we re headed up to chicago  illinois 
we like picking up strangers
along the way  don t we 
meet new people  don t we  hon 
sure do 
oh  shit 
my old billy don t work like it used to 
i m gonna have to   
pull over and take a leak somewhere here 
is that all right by you 
sure 
there should be a road
somewhere up here on the right 
  here 
  no  a little further 
little further  slow down 
turn in right here 
this is good 
right here 
yeah  this ll work 
i won t be long 
oh  shoot 
damn 
that s gonna be one fine sunset 
you have to be patient with me
while i get a few shots off 
hon  give me the key 
don t you worry none 
we ve got some hooch in the back and   
well  sandy s good company 
the thought of killing carl
and taking off
with the boy in the backseat
suddenly crossed sandy s mind 
he was young  but that didn t mean
she couldn t make it work 
tell you what  son  why don t you ste   
shit 
no  calm down  please 
i don t wanna shoot you  put the gun down 
  i don t want to shoot 
  i m so sorry 
carl  you want sandals or heels 
heels 
serial murderers
aren t the most trusting kind 
carl brought the additional quality
of being maniacally paranoid 
sandy s behavior
before they left home made him uneasy 
and carl thought it d be better if he was
the only one with a loaded weapon 
poor sandy never stood a chance 
her gun was loaded with blanks 
jim lacey 
new burlington  indiana 
carl never photographed
a more symmetrical face 
this photo really meant something to him 
jim had been their first 
sheriff bodecker 
this is deputy howser  come in  over 
sheriff  you there 
a farmer called in a double homicide
off the 506  i need you here 
i m sorry  lee  this is fucked up 
what do you mean 
it s your sister and her husband 
carl was shot twice 
sandy once 
it looks like it was a nine millimeter 
sandy got one shot off but   
her gun was loaded with blanks 
  jesus christ 
  lee 
give me a couple minutes here
alone with her 
she d always been
sort of fucked up 
but lee blamed carl
for the way she d gone downhill 
regardless of all that 
she was still his baby sister 
but the sheriff couldn t help but think
of his own situation for a moment 
he thought about that photo
he found of her
and worried about what else
people might find
if he didn t get to it first 
reverend roy laferty 
durham  north carolina 
though the poor fucker had been
completely worthless as a model 
carl was insistent on keeping a record
of both his successes and his failures 
howdy 
you look like you ve been traveling 
  yeah 
  where you headed 
there used to be a house and a barn
up on the hill over there 
some lawyer owned it  you know it 
sure i do 
up in the mitchell flats 
still there 
well  i ll be damned 
you re that russell boy  ain t you 
i just thought  seeing as i was this way 
i d stop by and see the old place again 
son  i hate to tell you this 
but that place burned some years ago 
they think some kids did it 
wasn t nobody ever living there
since you and your folks 
well  heck  i come all this way 
i may as well walk up there anyways 
sure  just cut across clarence s pasture 
he won t say nothing 
i never did thank you
for the night my dad died 
you were awful kind of me 
and i just want you to know
that i ain t never forgot it 
you had that pie smeared
all across your face 
damn bodecker thought it was blood 
remember that 
yeah  i remember everything
about that night 
he ain t the lawman that i expected 
shame about his sister though 
why  what happened 
well  his sister and her husband
were found dead 
not far from meade 
you come back to see me 
we ll sit out and drink some beer 
i ll do that 
lee 
got a call from sheriff thompson
in lewisburg  west virginia 
wants you to call him back
as soon as possible 
i had a man shot down here two days back 
he was a preacher 
and we re suspecting it s a boy
that used to live up around your parts 
that right 
how d he kill the man 
a couple shots 
pistol  probably a luger
that the boy s known to have 
  that s a nine millimeter  ain t it 
  that s right 
what d you say the boy s name was 
i didn t say  but it s arvin russell 
both of his parents died up around there 
as i understand it 
father was a suicide 
and he s been living down here
with the grandmother and the uncle 
listen  i don t think the boy s dangerous 
from what i m hearing 
this preacher might ve deserved killing 
is this boy driving 
could be 
he owns an ol  busted up chevy 3100   54 
i don t know
that it d make it all the way up there 
at this point  he might be hitchhiking 
dark hair  not bad looking  quiet 
who s gonna bury jack 
i don t know 
i don t know
who s gonna wanna touch that thing 
look  kid   
my daddy didn t do anything
like what your daddy did up there 
but he did up and leave me 
my mama  and my sister 
he just went off to the shoe factory
one morning and never came back 
and there was nothing to do
but forget his sorry ass 
some people were born
just so they could be buried 
arvin thought about the days
leading up to his mother s death 
how willard wanted so much
for her to live 
his father
would have done anything to save her 
fuck the blood and stink 
the heat and the insects 
anything 
arvin said to himself 
and suddenly he realized 
standing in his father s church 
that he d had no other choice 
that willard had needed to go
wherever charlotte went 
arvin russell 
i know you re down there somewhere 
it s sheriff bodecker  son 
got some questions to ask you 
sorry about that 
goddamn bird scared me 
i ain t here to hurt you 
and i know that you don t wanna hurt me 
come on out so we can have us a talk 
okay 
i figured this might be where you d come 
remember that night
you brought me up here 
that was an awful thing your daddy did 
god dammit  boy  don t   
don t fuck with me 
put the gun down  sheriff 
i got one pointed right at you 
can t do that  son 
just set it on the ground and step away 
what 
just set it on the ground and step away 
so you can kill me like you did my sister
and that preacher down in west virginia  
i m not a bad person  sheriff 
that preacher weren t no good 
he hurt my sister so bad
she killed herself  sheriff 
i had no choice 
i hate to be the one to tell you this 
sheriff  but your sister   
and her husband 
they weren t no good neither 
i got a snapshot in my pocket here
of her hugging on some dead guy 
you let loose that gun
and i ll show it to you 
i had no choice 
they were gonna kill me  i swear 
i begged her to put the gun down 
i m sorry 
though it seemed to arvin
as if hours went by
while he listened
to the sheriff fight to stay alive 
it actually took the man
only a few minutes to die 
thank you  mister 
i didn t think
anybody was gonna pick me up 
looks like you had a rough day 
yeah 
uh  where you headed 
i ain t figured that out yet 
where you headed 
cincinnati 
  all right 
  that okay for you 
uh   
yeah  i ve been meaning
to get up that way 
    to make known
his final decision
to significantly increase
the number of us troops
deployed to south vietnam 
he explained the reason for his actions
in these historic words 
we intend to convince the communists
that we cannot be defeated
by force of arms
or by superior power 
they re not easily convinced 
arvin didn t want
to fall asleep sitting next to a stranger 
and as he fought hard to stay awake 
his mind began taking him places 
he started to think maybe the law
would recognize he had done good 
maybe he d be forgiven 
maybe he d even be able to see grandma
and uncle earskell again 
or maybe that was too risky 
what happened 
but still   
maybe he d meet a girl 
start a family like his daddy did 
as the thoughts came  he wasn t sure
if he was going backwards or forwards 
he knew wherever this was 
it felt nicer than knockemstiff 
no fighting or screaming or pain 
then the thought of enlisting
got into his brain 
and he wasn t sure if he was thinking
about himself or willard anymore 
he didn t want
to end up in a war like his father 
but he was good at fighting 
maybe that s where he belonged 
grandma would tell him to pray on it
