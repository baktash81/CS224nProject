they probably couldnt point em out
to you on a map
but i guarantee
theyd be there all the same
how and why so many people
from those two piddlin places on that map
could end up connected
has a lot to do with our story
some would claim it was just dumb luck
while others might swear
it was gods intention
but id say
with the way things turned out
it was a little bit of both
in 1957 itd take someone
approximately ten hours
to drive from coal creek
to a paper mill town
in southern ohio called meade
once you got to meade
knockemstiff was only a short drive away
four hundred or so people
lived in knockemstiff
in 1957
nearly all of them connected by blood
by one godforsaken calamity or another
be it lust or necessity
or just plain ignorance
the russells had rented the house on top
of the mitchell flats for nine years now
but most of the neighbors down below
still considered them outsiders
hey dad
youre coming with me today boy
years ago
willard had fitted together
a weathered cross above a fallen tree
in a small clearing behind his house
he came every morning and evening
to talk to god
it seemed to his son that his father
fought the devil all the time
now you pray on
what happened today
now remember be honest
no bullshittin hell know
when he prayed
his mind would often drift back
to the war in the south pacific
and the day that he and a couple
of other soldiers came across the body
of gunnery sergeant miller jones
holy shit
fuck
whats it say
miller jones
fuck
we gotta do something
the japs just left him up there

he would do anything to protect her
no matter what the weather was
lenora would visit her mothers grave
after school
some days
shed even read the bible out loud
and imagine her mother was listening
though he wasnt one for praying
arvin would often drive her
and keep her company
arvin
it was a sight
you didnt end up in the hospital
yeah well theres a lot of no good
sons of bitches out there
well lord arvin youve been saying that
almost since the day i met you
you know thats because its true
maybe you should try praying for em then
would that hurt none
you already do enough for all of us
and wheres it doing you much good huh
you know what would do you good
to not be wandering behind school
by your own self like i told you
fuckin gene dinwoodie
do you ever think about
how we ended up orphans
living in the same house
no
besides you might not even be an orphan
as far as everybody
around here is concerned
your daddys probably still out there
somewhere alive and kicking
fuck he might even come over that hill
any day now dancing a jig
i hope so
i pray every day he will
even if it means he did something
ive already forgiven him

what you got planned
after school arvin
cliff baker says he can get me
on the crew laying blacktop
on the greenbrier stretch off route 60
yeah

oh my old mans holding me here
better than getting shipped off
to vietnam i expect
yeah i suppose so
everyone says
they like the way i do them but i
well just get him a big steak then
you know
i cant afford anything like that
grandma quit worrying about it
hes just a preacher
anyway everyone says aint no one
doesnt like you you know that
so chicken livers it is
its nice to meet you reverend
its nice to meet you
nice to meet you reverend
nice to meet you
emma was known
as one of the best cooks in the county
when people praised her food
she always told them
that she couldnt fry an egg
until she found the lord
and that he was the one
that guided her hand
and made everything turn out good
all right
my hearts in my stomach
that hat you know better
hello there
pleased to meet you reverend
emma russell
nice to meet you too what you got there
as preston teagardin swished the juice
from the chicken livers
around in his mouth
he felt the stirrings
of a sermon coming on
blessed
are they who hunger
and thirst
for righteousness
hope you like them reverend
preston loved
the way people listened to him
and held onto every word
hmm
he was grateful
his mother decided all those years ago
that he was going to be a preacher
hed never win a fist fight
but he could recite
the book of revelation in his sleep
friends
theres no doubt
were all humble people gathered here
amen
amen
yall have been awful nice to me
and i thank you from the bottom
of my heart for the welcome
yes
but friends
the poor soul
that brung in them chicken livers
on that beatup plate
lets just say im inspired to preach
on it for a minute before we eat
sure
some of us are better off than others
and i see
plenty of white meat and red meat
laid out on this table
and i suspect that the folks
that carried them platters in
eat mighty good sometimes
yes sir
but poor people
got to bring what they can afford
so them organs
is a sign to me
telling me that i should
as the new preacher of this church
sacrifice myself
so that yall can have a share
of the good meat tonight
and thats what im going to do friends
im going to eat these organs
cause i model myself
on the good lord jesus
whenever he gives me the chance
and today
hes blessed me with another opportunity
to follow in his footsteps
amen
now dont you worry
about that pusgutted blowhard
i bet he aint got two nickels
to rub together
i never been
so embarrassed in all my life
i couldve crawled right under the table
all right im gonna go talk to him
no arvin
none of that
he sure aint the preacher
i was hoping for
grandma that aint no preacher
hes as bad as they got on the damn radio
heck i bet he just wanted
them chicken livers all for his own self
thats why he did that
you see the way he was gobbling them down
you shouldnt talk like that arvin
preacher teagardin wouldnt be here
if the lord hadnt sent him
whoo lenora
hey chicken shit
that preachers a little flashy
are you not coming
no i got some things to do
before we go home
cant we go do them after i see mama
no you go on ill be back
go on
stand on the verge
of a big breakthrough
god has said in the next few years
we stand on the verge of paradise
but theres something wrong
and im gonna tell you
weve got to have prayer power
and spiritual power
in south vietnam
soldiers fight with arms
but now our spirit
who is it out there
lenora laferty preacher teagardin
girl you been crying
its nothing
i just get down sometimes
uh
the kids at school they like to tease
and i aint gonna have family there
come next year
i was like you when i was your age
full of the lord
some of them other kids just
came down hard on me
what did you do about it
well
it was a rough time
they was just jealous
envy
brings out the worst in people
especially the young ones
i dont know
if you have anywhere you gotta be
but uh
maybe we can take a drive
theres a quiet place i found
i like to go and pray on things
like his father years before
arvin had always been careful
about picking his time
he knew hed stand a better chance
if he didnt try to take on
all the dirty bastards at once
what was that
nothing
it must not have got shut all the way
lets get them bloomers off come on
you close that door
goddamn better be worth it
you piece of shit
stop it
motherfucker
hey orville will you start it up man
i dont think its the spark plugs
hey
no hey gene you want another twinkie
im all right thank you
wait
wait im sorry im sorry
want your fuckin twinkie now

no
you touch my sister again
ill kill you
do you understand me
yes
do you understand me
im so sorry
now we can feel the lord our here
cant we
its kind of you to come all this way
lenora
have you truly opened yourself
to the lord with
preacher sykes or
any other preacher
once
reverend sykes wept with me
hmm
thats not my meaning
have you shown yourself
as the lord made you
you mean in my birthday suit no
no
no
to show yourself
as the lord made his first children
is to truly turn yourself to him
and his witnessing of it
now thats courage itself
meaning i take off my clothes
come on and pray with me
lord lenora is showing herself to you
see her lord
as you made her
she presents herself to you now
give her the strength
we are together
before the lord
amen
amen
sorry i didnt come today
its okay
i know theres other things
you wanna be doing probably
so i can come on my own from now on
like her mother years ago
lenora felt the same force
that drew helen to roy laferty
the girl imagined that she could touch
the love emanating from the preacher
thirtythree to athens
50 to clarksville
seventynine north to pittsburgh
thirtythree 50 79
thirtythree 50 79
thirtythree 50 79

lawman
when the man who puts extra money
in your pockets asks why youre as red
as a newborn baby
you tell him who the whore is
bodecker believed
people were like dogs
once they start digging
they dont wanna stop
first it would just be
that the sheriff had a whore for a sister
and after that all the bribes
and other shit that had piled up
since hed first pinned on a badge
and if he wasnt careful
eventually someone would find out
about his own dealings with leroy
my boy my boy
its been a while
yeah
whatcha having honey
coffee aint staying long
you got a new toy
its an english firearm
its really rare
its got special bullets
untraceable

or because all of meade

thats your weekly earnings
til were square
now get the fuck out of my diner
bodecker knew
that leroy and his errand boy bobo
would kill him soon enough
if he made any more trouble
he had an election to think about
and couldnt afford any liabilities
my bar is off limits and so is
your whore sister you understand

i told you i dont like this anymore
aint it fair
if i hate the way some of em cry
not that youd appreciate it

what sandy didnt understand

could he feel the presence
of something like god
no no no
please please please
dont you dont you touch
that fuckin camera there son
the sick fuck
how about we check into a motel
get a couple of steaks
and relax for a day or two
how does that sound
private gary matthew bryson
wont be reporting to fort eustis
but he aint a coward
he went and got himself killed
buried by the mechums river
in west virginia
chopped up pretty bad in a suitcase
no i wont speak to nobody else
ive heard of cases
in my reading
about sin
where someone got so sick
over some sin
they felt
they had committed that was so terrible
that they
started imagining things
back i read a story about
people
poor people
barely
able to write
thinking theyre
the president
or
or a hollywood celebrity
like ava gardner
i
i dont understand
what youre talking about
the thing is thats the part of it
the book says
its not
not understanding
see think about it
how
could i be
the daddy
when all we done
is spend time with the lord
late night
played cards
over at elder stubbss garage again
you win this time
no not really
saw fred dinwoodie over there
he said his boy is just about healed up
i still think
you could have held back a little bit
well he aint bothered lenora since
him or his candyass buddies
i gotta go check in on her
she aint been feeling too good
you keep an eye on her for me
while were at church
lenora had stopped asking arvin
to join her at helens grave
he didnt mind much
his mind
would always drift back to willard
and the prayer log and his poor dog jack
besides hed gotten a job
working on the road crew
and was busy making some money
i never missed church before
im so ashamed
you aint got nothing to be ashamed of
im sure the lord will forgive you
for missing one sunday
ol jesus probably had
his fair share of bad mornings
i love you arvin
hows about we uh
go see your mamas grave
when youre better
sound all right
the good book
is filled with good men
and women
suffering delusions
eve in the garden
noah
naked drunk
bringing shame upon his family
the idol
the jews bowed before in the desert
and even the lord jesus himself
was presented with delusions in the desert
that only through his faith
and his strength
overcame
mmhmm
praise jesus
the lords delusion in the desert
was a game
of the socalled devil
and what the lord experienced
was a delusion
that wouldve kept him from saving us
but he did not fall for it
it is our delusions
that lead us to sin
striking a mother or a wife
for something that you thought they said
neglecting work or sunday service
for that matter
right you said it
some girl
gets a feeling for a fella
and lets him have her holy gift
delusions
blaspheming the lord
in your mind and in your heart
for some wrong done to you
by another person
thats true
youre saying you dont
remember all the things
we did in your car
im saying you must be crazy
coming in the lords house
and talking all this trash
look my advice to you girl
is you figure some way to get rid of it
cause otherwise
its gonna be you a whore mother
and her little bastard child
running around
living in that poor old womans house
who raised you
if nothing else think of her
shell die from the shame of it all
come on
come on
lenora suddenly knew
she was making a mistake
grandma wouldnt be ashamed
and she and her baby would be okay
oh my god
oh my god
no no no
grandma
grandma
no no no
grandma
grandma
no one would know
she wasnt a suicide
and that in the end
she was all right with her maker
oh lord
theres just some things
we cant understand
but you take her into your arms
uh aint somebody
saying prayers or
need to have a word with you arvin
all right see ya buddy
yep
see ya tomorrow
about what
its uh
its about lenora
what about her
i came by here instead of home
so nothings
put on your grandmother
put on what do you mean
well
ol dudley in the coroners
i aint never heard of no dudley
well hes a drunk
but he aint no liar
did you know lenora was carrying a baby
thats bullshit
that son of a bitch is lying
i tell ya
dudley aint a liar
he came to me privately
so as your family knew
i felt he was right
now i mightve put my foot
in something it
wasnt my intentions
you know that preacher
aint said no words for her
not for people that kill themselves
uncle
arvin wanted so much
to be able to tell them goodbye
but they would be better off
not knowing anything
if the law came looking for him
you have to be good to grandma
you know that she aint hardly been out
of her bed since the funeral
yeah
grandma needs you
all right
dear grandma
im writing to you
because i cannot say goodbye to your face
i love you and i will always remember
the things that you have done for me
what im about to do
i do because i have to
not because i want to
please do not try and find me
love your grandson arvin
excuse me
excuse me
preacher
got time for a sinner
ive been doing wrong
and i wanna get right by the lord
well thats what im here for
ive done
lustful acts
yeah
that could be a big problem
especially for the young people
go on tell me about it
i got me a pretty wife at home
one thatll do pretty much anything i ask
but i treat her real bad
well when you say anything
what do you mean
just what i said
sometimes shell be going down
on me with
well you know her mouth
heck i get so excited i start forcing it
she ever puke on you
they got a little trigger
back there in their throat
yeah well that aint my problem
well whats the problem then son
this guy i work with
has got himself a daughter
real young thing
just started high school
one day i got this girl in my truck
and i drove her out into the sticks
and i
had my way with her
did she put up a fight
no
but you see the problem is is
once id had a taste
i just couldnt get enough
i kept taking that girl there
any chance i got
so id strip her clothes off
but id make her pray
before we got started
why dont you take that hat off boy
sometimes id even
keep her panties
now id just
sniff em as she rode off on her bike
and then id go home
to that whore of a wife of mine
and make her bake me a cake
like i was celebrating
what in the hell is this
youve been spying on me boy
ive been watching your every move
for the last couple weeks
you cant get enough
of that reaster girl can you

and lenora
was just like this
this reaster girl
she wouldnt let me be
but i want you to know that i
i pray for that girls soul
every night
do you pray for her babys soul too
look i didnt have
nothing to do with that
she came to me
saying she got that way from a boy
dont fuckin lie to me

the lies are hers
she got it in her head
that i was the father
that i was gonna take care of everything
god dammit boy

he had to get away from this place
or any he ever called home
but in this moment he felt a sudden force
pulling in back towards knockemstiff
no matter what else happened
he had to try to set right
those things about his father
that still ate at his heart
come on
fuck
morning lee
heya bobo
sorry to come by so early
i was on my way to work and
i thought i might chew your ear

yeah
ill take coffee if you got any
coming up
leroy here
hes upstairs
pistols in the dining room

its a fine piece
wonder if youd consider selling me it
well i just got it
but everythings got a price i guess
you know
one thing i never can get is the

jackie deshannon here on kbwb
jackie first toured with the beatles
bobo go there do this

and now for the wixy sports scoreboard
carl

carl
we dont even know where hes going
carl
just
god dammit carl
hes going to ohio
no one from home thats your rule
lets just see where hes going sandy
morning
where you headed
meade ohio you heard of it
the papermill town right
yeah thats right
were passing right through it
what you going to meade for
just visiting
got family there
no i used to live there a long time ago
well probably aint changed much
little towns never do
where is it yall live
in chesterfield
were headed up to chicago illinois
we like picking up strangers
along the way dont we
meet new people dont we hon
sure do
oh shit
my old billy dont work like it used to
im gonna have to
pull over and take a leak somewhere here
is that all right by you
sure
there should be a road
somewhere up here on the right
here
no a little further
little further slow down
turn in right here
this is good
right here
yeah thisll work
i wont be long
oh shoot
damn
thats gonna be one fine sunset
you have to be patient with me
while i get a few shots off
hon give me the key
dont you worry none
weve got some hooch in the back and
well sandys good company
the thought of killing carl
and taking off
with the boy in the backseat
suddenly crossed sandys mind
he was young but that didnt mean
she couldnt make it work
tell you what son why dont you ste
shit
no calm down please
i dont wanna shoot you put the gun down
i dont want to shoot
im so sorry
carl you want sandals or heels
heels
serial murderers
arent the most trusting kind
carl brought the additional quality
of being maniacally paranoid
sandys behavior
before they left home made him uneasy
and carl thought itd be better if he was
the only one with a loaded weapon
poor sandy never stood a chance
her gun was loaded with blanks
jim lacey
new burlington indiana
carl never photographed
a more symmetrical face
this photo really meant something to him
jim had been their first
sheriff bodecker
this is deputy howser come in over
sheriff you there
a farmer called in a double homicide
off the 506 i need you here
im sorry lee this is fucked up
what do you mean
its your sister and her husband
carl was shot twice
sandy once
it looks like it was a nine millimeter
sandy got one shot off but
her gun was loaded with blanks
jesus christ
lee
give me a couple minutes here
alone with her
shed always been
sort of fucked up
but lee blamed carl
for the way shed gone downhill
regardless of all that
she was still his baby sister
but the sheriff couldnt help but think
of his own situation for a moment
he thought about that photo
he found of her
and worried about what else
people might find
if he didnt get to it first
reverend roy laferty
durham north carolina
though the poor fucker had been
completely worthless as a model
carl was insistent on keeping a record
of both his successes and his failures
howdy
you look like youve been traveling
yeah
where you headed
there used to be a house and a barn
up on the hill over there
some lawyer owned it you know it
sure i do
up in the mitchell flats
still there
well ill be damned
youre that russell boy aint you
i just thought seeing as i was this way
id stop by and see the old place again
son i hate to tell you this
but that place burned some years ago
they think some kids did it
wasnt nobody ever living there
since you and your folks
well heck i come all this way
i may as well walk up there anyways
sure just cut across clarences pasture
he wont say nothing
i never did thank you
for the night my dad died
you were awful kind of me
and i just want you to know
that i aint never forgot it
you had that pie smeared
all across your face
damn bodecker thought it was blood
remember that
yeah i remember everything
about that night
he aint the lawman that i expected
shame about his sister though
why what happened
well his sister and her husband
were found dead
not far from meade
you come back to see me
well sit out and drink some beer
ill do that
lee
got a call from sheriff thompson
in lewisburg west virginia
wants you to call him back
as soon as possible
i had a man shot down here two days back
he was a preacher
and were suspecting its a boy
that used to live up around your parts
that right
howd he kill the man
a couple shots
pistol probably a luger
that the boys known to have
thats a nine millimeter aint it
thats right
whatd you say the boys name was
i didnt say but its arvin russell
both of his parents died up around there
as i understand it
father was a suicide
and hes been living down here
with the grandmother and the uncle
listen i dont think the boys dangerous
from what im hearing
this preacher mightve deserved killing
is this boy driving
could be
he owns an ol busted up chevy 3100 54
i dont know
that itd make it all the way up there
at this point he might be hitchhiking
dark hair not bad looking quiet
whos gonna bury jack
i dont know
i dont know
whos gonna wanna touch that thing
look kid
my daddy didnt do anything
like what your daddy did up there
but he did up and leave me
my mama and my sister
he just went off to the shoe factory
one morning and never came back
and there was nothing to do
but forget his sorry ass
some people were born
just so they could be buried
arvin thought about the days
leading up to his mothers death
how willard wanted so much
for her to live
his father
would have done anything to save her
fuck the blood and stink
the heat and the insects
anything
arvin said to himself
and suddenly he realized
standing in his fathers church
that hed had no other choice
that willard had needed to go
wherever charlotte went
arvin russell
i know youre down there somewhere
its sheriff bodecker son
got some questions to ask you
sorry about that
goddamn bird scared me
i aint here to hurt you
and i know that you dont wanna hurt me
come on out so we can have us a talk
okay
i figured this might be where youd come
remember that night
you brought me up here
that was an awful thing your daddy did
god dammit boy dont
dont fuck with me
put the gun down sheriff
i got one pointed right at you
cant do that son
just set it on the ground and step away
what
just set it on the ground and step away
so you can kill me like you did my sister
and that preacher down in west virginia
im not a bad person sheriff
that preacher werent no good
he hurt my sister so bad
she killed herself sheriff
i had no choice
i hate to be the one to tell you this
sheriff but your sister
and her husband
they werent no good neither
i got a snapshot in my pocket here
of her hugging on some dead guy
you let loose that gun
and ill show it to you
i had no choice
they were gonna kill me i swear
i begged her to put the gun down
im sorry
though it seemed to arvin
as if hours went by
while he listened
to the sheriff fight to stay alive
it actually took the man
only a few minutes to die
thank you mister
i didnt think
anybody was gonna pick me up
looks like you had a rough day
yeah
uh where you headed
i aint figured that out yet
where you headed
cincinnati
all right
that okay for you
uh
yeah ive been meaning
to get up that way
to make known
his final decision
to significantly increase
the number of us troops
deployed to south vietnam
he explained the reason for his actions
in these historic words
we intend to convince the communists
that we cannot be defeated
by force of arms
or by superior power
theyre not easily convinced
arvin didnt want
to fall asleep sitting next to a stranger
and as he fought hard to stay awake
his mind began taking him places
he started to think maybe the law
would recognize he had done good
maybe hed be forgiven
maybe hed even be able to see grandma
and uncle earskell again
or maybe that was too risky
what happened
but still
maybe hed meet a girl
start a family like his daddy did
as the thoughts came he wasnt sure
if he was going backwards or forwards
he knew wherever this was
it felt nicer than knockemstiff
no fighting or screaming or pain
then the thought of enlisting
got into his brain
and he wasnt sure if he was thinking
about himself or willard anymore
he didnt want
to end up in a war like his father
but he was good at fighting
maybe thats where he belonged
grandma would tell him to pray on it
