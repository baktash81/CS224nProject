penthouse apartment
of perhaps the most unlikely
genius the world has ever known
oh sorry you caught me
doing my yoga
you were expecting
downward dog
perhaps chuckles
my name is mr peabody
and since were going to be
spending some time together
id like to tell you
a little bit about myself
you see
ever since i was a pup
it was clear that
i was different
dog barking
peabody i tried
to fit in
no thank you
but never could
as i grew i saw more and
more of my littermates
being chosen by their new families
snarling
but for some reason
i never was
come on boy
fetch the stick
but why wont you
just throw it again
its an exercise in futility
i dont want this one
mommy hes sarcastic
wait wait come back
throw the stick
ill stay ill heel
ill even shake hands
bark bark
so without
a family of my own
i dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge
culture and athletics
gasps of awe
cheering
i received my degree at harvard
valedogtorian of course
students yay
and then i devoted myself
to helping mankind
i pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy
cow farts
audience yay
resolved geopolitical
conflicts around the globe
cheering
and in my spare time
i invented the fist bump
planking tearaway pants
autotune
the backside ollie
and zumba
man singing
now go
stop
drop
pause
but what im most proud of
is my son sherman
hi mr peabody
oh whispering have you
told them about the wabac
whispers i was
just getting to that
when i adopted sherman i vowed
to be the best father i could be
to prepare him for all
the wonders of the world
present and past
and so sherman inspired the
greatest invention of my life
a time machine
elevator bell dings
of course time travel
can be a bit unpredictable
there are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way
lets just say
the leaning tower of pisa
wasnt always leaning
echoing but theres
nothing like learning
the lessons of
history firsthand
right sherman
where are we going
today mr peabody
not where sherman
when
sherman whoa this is the
biggest house ive ever seen
peabody its the palace of
versailles home of marie antoinette
you know she was mostly
famous for one thing
cake
i love cake so much
giggles
marie antoinette sure likes cake mr
peabody
marie chuckling oh
indeed she does
marie was a woman with a
prodigious appetite
for all things
covered with frosting
but her expensive tastes made her
the target of much criticism
why
because sherman
during maries reign
the common people
of france were exceedingly poor
youve got any bread
no im exceedingly poor
now can we have some cake
mais oui
oh yeah sorry
laughs
may we have some cake
mais oui
maybe she cant hear me
through the hair
sherman what
the queen means is
ah laughs
let them eat cake
when the queen heard the poor of
paris could not even buy bread
she said
let them eat cake
no
i heard it myself
its a scandal
its an outrage
down with the queen
down with the monarchy
wait
what kind of cake
crowd chanting in french
all gasp
smashing party your majesty
but now im afraid
sherman and i must be
sherman sherman
sherman
sherman
sherman here
sherman whistles
hey mr peabody
what are you doing in here
smacks lips
trying these other cakes
theres one in here with whipped
cream and strawberries thats
pretty fantastic
sherman
dont you remember
why i told you to stay
close to me during
the french revolution
because after
the french revolution
it was gonna rain
close
i said after the
french revolution comes
the reign of terror
all screaming
crowd continues
chanting in french
round up the aristocrats
indistinct cheering
grunts
groans
crowd shouting indistinctly
the queen and her
aristocratic cronies
must pay the price
for their gluttony
we will slaughter them
like the dogs they are
starting with this one
crowd cheering
sherman mr peabody
what should i do
nothing sherman
just stay right there
but mr peabody
everything is going
to be fine sherman
just stay right there
off with his head
cheering
mr peabody groans
a cantaloupe
the lowest of the fruits
who dares to insult me
with this melon
get that dog
panting mr peabody
how did you escape
its simple sherman
i noticed the distance
between the sewer lids
reasoned that there must be one
directly under
the guillotine platform
noted the loose board
under the basket
computed the angle at
which the setting sun
would bounce off your glasses
momentarily blinding
the executioner
and chose that moment to swipe
the executioners melon
giving me the added weight to tip
the boards facilitating my exit
thats amazing
its not amazing
it was just a matter
of keeping my head
laughs
keeping your head
i dont get it
there he is
after them
come sherman quick
coughs oh this
water tastes terrible
interestingly thats not water
spitting
haha
ive got you now
indeed you have
monsieur robespierre
and what a master
of the chase you are
oh you noticed
of course
doubling back on me like that
that was genius
thank you
i just hope you dont take
my little confederate here
i depend on him so completely
get over here you
gasps
drats
youre devilishly clever
i know and much quicker
than you as well
but are you quick
enough for this
haha see quick
quick yes but not too smart
oh another cantaloupe
your sword
all right sherman
looks like its time
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing
go
both grunting
attack parry
thrust repeat
no
remise
screams
peabody good boy
soldiers laughing
grunts
oh
all gasp
growling
gasping huh
haha you missed
i never miss
rumbling
gasping
soldiers screaming
peabody hop on
sherman whoa
whoa whoa
yeah whoa
yeah
do you smell that sherman
it wasnt me mr peabody
i know it wasnt you
its the methane gas
in the sewer system
and given the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees fahrenheit
were about to use it
to blast out of here
hang on
sherman whoo
wow
nice landing eh sherman
oof
so what did you
learn today sherman
that french revolution
was crazy
how so
all those guys getting
their heads chopped off
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasnt right
and think marie antoinette could
have avoided the whole revolution
if shed simply issued an edict
to distribute
bread amongst the poor
but then she couldnt
have had her dessert
why not mr peabody
because sherman you cant have
your cake and edict too
laughs
i dont get it
mechanical humming
where are we gonna go tomorrow mr
peabody
ancient rome
the wild west 1492
no sherman tomorrow we wont
be going to any of those places
oh why not
because tomorrows adventure
is one that youre going to
be taking all on your own
what do you mean
mr peabody
dont you remember
its your first day of school
oh can i drive
of course not
peabody remember sherman
i before e except after c
i know mr peabody
and dont forget about
the commutative principle
two plus three
equals three plus two
i know mr peabody
and if you have to
go to the bathroom
just raise your hand proudly
and say i have to go
i will mr peabody
and remember the no2 pencil
is standard for most uses
but there are times
when a no 1 comes in handy
i left a little pencil chart
in your backpack
which you can consult if it
ever becomes a judgment call
sherman i think
ill be okay
okay bye mr peabody
peabody wait
see you after school
sherman
i gotta go i gotta
sign up for the clubs
no one is more in
favor of participation
in fraternal
organizations than i
but before you go
i want you to have this
thanks what is it
a dog whistle
blowing
shuddering
it doesnt work
mr peabody
groans it works
fine sherman

purdy mr peabody thank you for
coming in on such short notice
to discuss
the problem with sherman
oh its not a problem
at all principal purdy
i fully expected this
you did
yes
and as with all things
shermanrelated i prepared for it
heres a curriculum
that takes shermans
advanced preparation
into account
but wont require you to have
him skip one or more grades
mr peabody
here are some prealgebra worksheets
an advanced reading list
and a link to
a website i created
so he can start
studying mandarin chinese
it is after all
the language of the future
mr peabody
im not saying he shouldnt study
french too principal purdy
im saying have him do both
mr peabody
what not enough swahili
speaking swahili
sherman got into a fight today
oh dear
pictures were taken
for insurance purposes
grunion he bit her
i must say it doesnt look
good for you mr peabody
after all you are a dog
who may i ask are you
i am ms grunion from the bureau
of child safety and protection
were required by law to contact
them whenever theres an
incident
sherman has never done
anything like this before
im sure he must
have had a reason
well the girl was being
a bit of a bully
grunion quiet purdy
its normal for
children to tease
its not normal
for them to bite
clearly its because of
how hes being raised
in my opinion
a dog can never be
a suitable parent
to a little boy
i must point out
ms grunion
that i won
the right to adopt sherman
in a court of law
and the court can
take it away from you
ill be coming to your home tomorrow
evening to conduct an investigation
if i discover that you are in
any way an unfit parent
i will see to it sherman is
removed from your custody
pencil sharpener whirring
permanently
i hope ive made myself clear
crystal
sherman im sorry
i bit her mr peabody
i wont do it again
youre darn tooting
you wont do it again
this kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable
and rather uncharacteristic given
how you feel about mr gandhi
what on earth provoked it
sighing she called me a dog
well all right then
thank you for telling me
try and get some sleep
i love you mr peabody
i have a deep regard
for you as well sherman

cooing

beautiful beautiful boy
mr peabody
you are a nobel
prizewinning scientist
an advisor to heads of state
a captain of industry
why would you
want to adopt a boy
because your honor
when i found sherman it reminded
me of how i started out in life
and now i want to give him
the one thing i always wanted
a home
and youre sure youre capable
of meeting all the challenges
of raising a human boy
with all due respect
how hard could it be
very well then
if a boy can adopt a dog
i see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy
sherman gurgles

wabac without permission
the only mistake
mr peabody ever made
was me
sherman
youre absolutely
right sherman
what kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy
maybe youre right
ms grunion
but theres one thing
you havent considered
whats that
im a dog too
if being a dog means youre like mr
peabody

his back on you

ooh grunting
its getting closer
what are we going to do
this is the greatest collection
of geniuses ever assembled
surely we can come up with another
way of getting to the past
i can build a catapult
we go very fast
but remember as you approach
the speed of light
gravity will get too strong
oh indeed for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction
how about we just punch
that big hole in the face
overlapping chatter
i have an idea
hey everybody i have an idea
yes what is it sherman
why not go to the future
the future
ive never been there before so
its probably not as messed up
sherman thats it
are you thinking
what im thinking
not usually
its exactly what
you all just said
except the total opposite
if we set the wabac for the
future and go very very fast
well create our own
gravitational field
thats equal and opposite
to the rip in
the spacetime continuum
laughs oh my
i dont get it
were gonna fly up there and
punch that big hole in the face
yes
sherman youre a genius
but peabody
how far into
the future must you go
just a few seconds
ought to do it
and then well
slingshot right back
are you sure this
is going to work
dont worry penny
just remember
im a grunts
genius
sherman
i need to reprogram the wabac
all right mr peabody
that means you have to drive
in order to make the leap
into the future
the wabac will
have to go very fast
faster than its
ever gone before
are you ready sherman
im ready
exhales
come on sherman you can do it
