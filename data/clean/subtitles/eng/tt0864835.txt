penthouse apartment   
of perhaps the most unlikely
genius the world has ever known 
oh  sorry  you caught me
doing my yoga 
you were expecting
downward dog 
perhaps   chuckles 
my name is mr  peabody 
and since we re going to be
spending some time together   
i d like to tell you
a little bit about myself 
you see 
ever since i was a pup   
it was clear that
i was different 
 dog barking 
peabody  i tried
to fit in   
no  thank you 
   but never could 
as i grew  i saw more and
more of my littermates   
being chosen by their new families 
 snarling 
but for some reason 
i never was 
come on  boy 
fetch the stick 
but why  won t you
just throw it again 
it s an exercise in futility 
i don t want this one 
mommy  he s sarcastic 
wait  wait  come back 
throw the stick 
i ll stay  i ll heel 
i ll even shake hands 
bark  bark 
so  without
a family of my own   
i dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge   
culture  and athletics 
 gasps of awe 
 cheering 
i received my degree at harvard 
vale dog torian  of course 
students  yay 
and then  i devoted myself
to helping mankind 
i pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy 
 cow farts 
audience  yay 
resolved geopolitical
conflicts around the globe 
 cheering 
and in my spare time   
i invented the fist bump 
planking  tearaway pants   
auto tune   
the backside ollie   
and zumba 
man   singing 
now go
stop
drop
pause
but what i m most proud of
is my son  sherman 
hi  mr  peabody 
oh   whispering  have you
told them about the wabac 
 whispers  i was
just getting to that 
when i adopted sherman  i vowed
to be the best father i could be 
to prepare him for all
the wonders of the world 
present and past 
and so  sherman inspired the
greatest invention of my life   
a time machine 
 elevator bell dings 
of course  time travel
can be a bit unpredictable 
there are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way 
let s just say 
the leaning tower of pisa
wasn t always leaning 
 echoing  but there s
nothing like learning
the lessons of
history firsthand 
right  sherman 
where are we going
today  mr  peabody 
not  where   sherman 
 when  
sherman  whoa  this is the
biggest house i ve ever seen 
peabody  it s the palace of
versailles  home of marie antoinette 
you know  she was mostly
famous for one thing 
cake 
i love cake so much 
 giggles 
marie antoinette sure likes cake  mr 
peabody 
marie   chuckling  oh 
indeed she does 
marie was a woman with a
prodigious appetite   
for all things
covered with frosting 
but her expensive tastes made her
the target of much criticism 
why 
because  sherman   
during marie s reign 
the common people
of france were exceedingly poor 
you ve got any bread 
no  i m exceedingly poor 
now  can we have some cake 
mais  oui 
oh  yeah  sorry 
 laughs 
 may we  have some cake 
mais  oui 
maybe she can t hear me
through the hair 
sherman  what
the queen means is   
ah   laughs 
let them eat cake 
when the queen heard the poor of
paris could not even buy bread   
she said 
 let them eat cake  
no 
i heard it myself 
it s a scandal 
it s an outrage 
down with the queen 
down with the monarchy 
wait 
what kind of cake 
 crowd chanting in french 
 all gasp 
smashing party  your majesty 
but now  i m afraid
sherman and i must be   
sherman  sherman 
sherman 
sherman 
sherman  here 
sherman   whistles 
hey  mr  peabody 
what are you doing in here 
 smacks lips 
trying these other cakes 
there s one in here with whipped
cream and strawberries that s   
pretty fantastic 
sherman   
don t you remember
why i told you to stay
close to me during
the french revolution 
because after
the french revolution   
it was gonna rain 
close 
i said   after the
french revolution comes   
the reign of terror  
 all screaming 
 crowd continues
chanting in french 
round up the aristocrats 
 indistinct cheering 
 grunts 
 groans 
 crowd shouting indistinctly 
the queen and her
aristocratic cronies   
must pay the price
for their gluttony 
we will slaughter them
like the dogs they are 
starting with this one 
 crowd cheering 
sherman  mr  peabody 
what should i do 
nothing  sherman 
just stay right there 
but  mr  peabody 
everything is going
to be fine  sherman 
just stay right there 
off with his head 
 cheering 
mr  peabody   groans 
a cantaloupe 
the lowest of the fruits 
who dares to insult me
with this melon 
get that dog 
 panting  mr  peabody 
how did you escape 
it s simple  sherman 
i noticed the distance
between the sewer lids   
reasoned that there must be one
directly under
the guillotine platform   
noted the loose board
under the basket   
computed the angle at
which the setting sun
would bounce off your glasses   
momentarily blinding
the executioner   
and chose that moment to swipe
the executioner s melon   
giving me the added weight to tip
the boards  facilitating my exit 
that s amazing 
it s not amazing 
it was just a matter
of keeping my head 
 laughs 
 keeping your head  
i don t get it 
there he is 
after them 
come  sherman  quick 
 coughs  oh  this
water tastes terrible 
interestingly  that s not water 
 spitting 
ha ha 
i ve got you now 
indeed you have 
monsieur robespierre 
and what a master
of the chase you are 
oh  you noticed 
of course 
doubling back on me like that 
that was genius 
thank you 
i just hope you don t take
my little confederate  here 
i depend on him so completely 
get over here  you 
 gasps 
drats 
you re devilishly clever 
i know  and much quicker
than you as well 
but are you quick
enough for this 
ha ha  see  quick 
quick  yes  but not too smart 
oh  another cantaloupe 
your sword 
all right  sherman 
looks like it s time
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing 
go 
 both grunting 
attack  parry 
thrust  repeat 
no 
remise 
 screams 
peabody  good boy 
 soldiers laughing 
 grunts 
oh 
 all gasp 
 growling 
 gasping  huh 
ha ha  you missed 
i never miss 
 rumbling 
 gasping 
 soldiers screaming 
peabody  hop on 
sherman  whoa 
whoa  whoa 
yeah  whoa 
yeah 
do you smell that  sherman 
it wasn t me  mr  peabody 
i know it wasn t you 
it s the methane gas
in the sewer system 
and given the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees fahrenheit   
we re about to use it   
to blast out of here 
hang on 
sherman  whoo 
wow 
nice landing  eh  sherman 
oof 
so  what did you
learn today  sherman 
that french revolution
was crazy 
how so 
all those guys getting
their heads chopped off   
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn t right 
and think  marie antoinette could
have avoided the whole revolution   
if she d simply issued an edict
to distribute
bread amongst the poor 
but then  she couldn t
have had her dessert 
why not  mr  peabody 
because  sherman  you can t have
your cake and edict  too 
 laughs 
i don t get it 
 mechanical humming 
where are we gonna go tomorrow  mr 
peabody 
ancient rome 
the wild west  1492 
no  sherman  tomorrow we won t
be going to any of those places 
oh  why not 
because tomorrow s adventure   
is one that you re going to
be taking all on your own 
what do you mean 
mr  peabody 
don t you remember 
it s your first day of school 
oh  can i drive 
of course not 
peabody  remember  sherman 
 i  before  e   except after  c  
i know  mr  peabody 
and don t forget about
the commutative principle 
two plus three
equals three plus two 
i know  mr  peabody 
and if you have to
go to the bathroom   
just raise your hand proudly
and say   i have to go  
i will  mr  peabody 
and remember  the no 2 pencil
is standard for most uses   
but there are times
when a no  1 comes in handy 
i left a little pencil chart
in your backpack   
which you can consult if it
ever becomes a judgment call 
sherman  i think
i ll be okay 
okay  bye  mr  peabody 
peabody  wait 
see you after school 
sherman 
i gotta go  i gotta
sign up for the clubs 
no one is more in
favor of participation
in fraternal
organizations than i 
but before you go 
i want you to have this 
thanks  what is it 
a dog whistle 
 blowing 
 shuddering 
it doesn t work 
mr  peabody 
 groans  it works
fine  sherman 
it s just a frequency
only dogs can hear 
oh  cool 
let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you   
that no matter what
challenges you face 
no matter how far
away i might seem   
bye  mr  peabody

but they re not true 
he did cross the delaware river 
christmas night  1776  though 
my dad took me there this summer

 bell ringing 
purdy  mr  peabody  thank you for
coming in on such short notice   
to discuss
the problem with sherman 
oh  it s not a problem
at all  principal purdy 
i fully expected this 
you did 
yes 
and  as with all things
sherman related  i prepared for it 
here s a curriculum
that takes sherman s
advanced preparation
into account   
but won t require you to have
him skip one or more grades 
mr  peabody   
here are some pre algebra worksheets 
an advanced reading list   
and a link to
a website i created
so he can start
studying mandarin chinese 
it is  after all 
the language of the future 
mr  peabody 
i m not saying he shouldn t study
french  too  principal purdy 
i m saying have him do both 
mr  peabody 
what  not enough  swahili 
 speaking swahili 
sherman got into a fight today 
oh  dear 
pictures were taken   
for insurance purposes 
grunion  he bit her 
i must say  it doesn t look
good for you  mr  peabody 
after all  you are a dog 
who  may i ask  are you 
i am ms  grunion from the bureau
of child safety and protection 
we re required by law to contact
them whenever there s an   
incident 
sherman has never done
anything like this before 
i m sure he must
have had a reason 
well  the girl was being
a bit of a bully   
grunion  quiet  purdy 
it s normal for
children to tease 
it s not normal
for them to bite 
clearly  it s because of
how he s being raised 
in my opinion 
a dog can never be
a suitable parent
to a little boy 
i must point out 
ms  grunion   
that i won
the right to adopt sherman
in a court of law 
and the court can
take it away from you 
i ll be coming to your home tomorrow
evening to conduct an investigation 
if i discover that you are  in
any way  an unfit parent   
i will see to it sherman is
removed from your custody 
 pencil sharpener whirring 
permanently 
i hope i ve made myself clear 
crystal 
sherman  i m sorry
i bit her  mr  peabody 
i won t do it again 
you re darn tooting
you won t do it again 
this kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable 
and rather uncharacteristic  given
how you feel about mr  gandhi 
what on earth provoked it 
 sighing  she called me a dog 
well  all right then 
thank you for telling me 
try and get some sleep 
i love you  mr  peabody 
i have a deep regard
for you as well  sherman 
 beautiful boy playing

you re busy making other plans
beautiful  beautiful 
beautiful  beautiful boy
 cooing 
beautiful  beautiful 
beautiful  beautiful boy
mr  peabody   
you are a nobel
prize winning scientist 
an advisor to heads of state 
a captain of industry 
why would you
want to adopt a boy 
because  your honor   
when i found sherman  it reminded
me of how i started out in life 
and now  i want to give him
the one thing i always wanted 
a home 
and you re sure you re capable
of meeting all the challenges   
of raising a human boy 
with all due respect 
how hard could it be 
very well  then 
if a boy can adopt a dog   
i see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy 
 sherman gurgles 
da da 
no  sherman  not  da da  
you shall call me
 mr  peabody  
or  in less formal moments 
simply  peabody

and i have to

 rhythmic clacking 
everything going swimmingly 
ugh 
why didn t you tell me
she was coming over here 
because i didn t want you to worry

listen to your bellyaching 
thank you for your honesty

i don t know what you think we re
supposed to do in here anyway 
she hates me 
share your interests 
tell a witty anecdote 
mr  peabody   
i hate her 
sherman 
every great relationship   
starts from a place of conflict 
and evolves into
something richer 
bonne chance 
make it work 
but don t tell her

penny  don t even
think about it

oh 
oh  grand vizier  would you mind
telling the precious princess  here   
precisely what it means
to marry the young pharaoh

to him in eternity   
through the sacred ceremonies
of disembowelment
and mummification   
as described in the holy texts 
um  hold up a second

designed to assist
the pharaohs  souls
in their journey
to the afterlife 
and they may assist us as well 
oh  this depicts the god anubis
sailing the boat of ra
to the underworld

why  anubis  why 
plagues  plagues 
if this marriage
pact is sealed   
i will shower down upon the
land uncountable plagues 
oy  again with the plagues 
why did i ever move to egypt 
but  anubis  the sun
god  ra  has decreed   
that this girl is to be
the boy king s wife 
that s so funny 
i was talking to the sun god 
ra  just the other day   
and he told me
he changed his mind 
really 
old  flip flop ra   we call
him here in the underworld 
but it s too late  we ve
already paid for the catering 
too bad  you re going
to lose your deposit 
 all groaning 
more smoke  sherman  this
canine subterfuge is working 
deliver the girl   
to the gates of the city 
and leave her there   
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith 
only in this manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided 
all  the girl must go 
ow 
anubis has spoken 
take this girl to the gates

leonardo  i can t even tell my
left brain from my right anymore 
how many times i got to
tell you  mona lisa 
mona lisa 
leonardo  i can t
paint the picture   
until you smile 
leonardo  tell me one thing

the sunshine  the pasta 
all the things that make italy such
a popular tourist destination

i paint the paintings 
i make the machines 
i don t tell the jokes 
perhaps  i can be
of assistance  you see   
humor is not immune
to the laws of science 
using algorithms 
we can extrapolate
what is universally
considered  funny    
thus producing a formula that is
scientifically
certain to cause laughter 
case in point  the pratfall 
is everyone amused 
hmm 
the data
was so clear  ooh 
don t worry  mr  peabody 
i got it 
sherman    ahh

 crashing 
 laughing 
 speaking italian 
hold that smile 
hold it right there 
no move  no move 
 sighs 
peabody  well  leo  if my

to send us home

in the space time continuum 
if you arrest me 
i won t be able to fix   
blah  blah  blah

with your fancy jargon   
and that little
red tie of yours

you don t know
what you re doing 
please  before it s too late 
 straining 
sherman  wait 
give him another chance 
he s through with chances  now 
he has to pay for his mistakes 
but i m the one who
made all the mistakes 
i m the one who used the
wabac without permission 
the only mistake
mr  peabody ever made   
was me 
sherman 
you re absolutely
right  sherman 
what kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy 
maybe you re right 
ms  grunion 
but there s one thing
you haven t considered 
what s that 
i m a dog  too 
if being a dog means you re like mr 
peabody   
who never turns
his back on you   
and who s always there to
pick you up when you fall   
and loves you no matter
how many times you mess up   
if that s what it
means to be a dog   
then  yeah  i m a dog  too 
i m a dog  too

 people murmuring 
boy   gasps  george washington

to be self evident   
that all men  and some dogs 
are created equal

what are we going to do 
this is the greatest collection
of geniuses ever assembled 
surely we can come up with another
way of getting to the past 
i can build a catapult 
we go very fast 
but  remember  as you approach
the speed of light   
gravity will get too strong 
oh  indeed   for every action  there
is an equal and opposite reaction  
how about we just punch
that big hole in the face 
 overlapping chatter 
i have an idea 
hey  everybody  i have an idea 
yes  what is it  sherman 
why not go to the future 
the future 
i ve never been there before  so
it s probably not as messed up 
sherman  that s it 
are you thinking
what i m thinking 
not usually 
it s exactly what
you all just said   
except the total opposite 
if we set the wabac for the
future  and go very  very fast   
we ll create our own
gravitational field   
that s equal and opposite   
to the rip in
the space time continuum 
 laughs  oh  my   
i don t get it 
we re gonna fly up there and
punch that big hole in the face 
yes 
sherman  you re a genius 
but  peabody   
how far into
the future must you go 
just a few seconds
ought to do it 
and then we ll
slingshot right back 
are you sure this
is going to work 
don t worry  penny 
just remember 
i m a     grunts 
genius 
sherman   
i need to reprogram the wabac 
all right  mr  peabody 
that means you have to drive 
in order to make the leap
into the future   
the wabac will
have to go very fast 
faster than it s
ever gone before 
are you ready  sherman 
i m ready 
 exhales 
come on  sherman  you can do it 
now  mr  peabody 
sherman  we need more speed

 gasps
