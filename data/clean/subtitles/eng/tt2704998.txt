theres a snap
heres the hold
cell phone chimes
ooh
and a text
that was interference
annie sorry honey i know
how much that meant to you
come on
dr chin is ready for you
uh great
i think weve determined
why youve been
having trouble conceiving
max okay lets have it
annie okay great
oh whats that look is it me
of course its me
im not loving your semen
oh
your count is excellent
but your motility
is well below normal
thats too bad
what would cause that
it can be genetic
environmental factors
nine times out of 10 though
its psychological
have you been feeling
anxious or stressed
no i dont think so
not really
highpitched uh
hes always a little stressed
you dont have to write
im not
honey shes writing it down
well max is very competitive
as am i
we sure are
one of the reasons
i fell in love with him
maybe that makes him
a little more prone
to stress than normal people
normal people
how long has this
been going on max
its not going on
oh well you did say
even when you were a kid
you would freak out
if you lost at anything
oh i was a kid
especially if you lost
to your brother
hmm
hey is that what this is
no
you have been so uptight
since you found out that
brooks is coming to town
i dont think thats true
could that be a factor in all this
lets be fair
sibling rivalry
can be very powerful
cain and abel the baldwins
the what
the brothers
im not sure
why were discussing this
shes not a therapist
youre not a therapist right
with all respect
no but i am a doctor
sure
and i believe in treating
the whole patient
so what is it
about your brother
that makes you
feel emasculated
are we gonna do this
were right next to the room
where i masturbated
i think he has it in his head
that brooks is cooler
and more successful
and hotter than he is
i never said hotter
hes charming
thats interesting
and is he single
max whats that
i dont know
if i mentioned it
but keith and i
are on a trial separation
oh
keith
uh keith
so do you think your brother would
wanna grab a cup of coffee with me
sighs gosh i dont know
well it doesnt hurt to ask
hurts a little scoffs
now is he a tall fella
cause im only 52
were all done with my semen
he is taller than max
dr chin good
annie but he did date
this ballerina once
and she was just
a teenytiny little thing
ooh
honey gary
dont mention
game night okay
mmmhmm
good evening max
hey gary
annie
hello there
hi gary
just checking the mail
oh yeah
some people check it
earlier in the day
but theres always a risk
that the mail carrier
hasnt come yet
this spares me the chance of
a futile trip to the mailbox
uhhuh
plus it allows bastian here
the opportunity to urinate
you have a good one
any plans for this evening
max no
perhaps a game night
were just gonna stay in
just the two of us
mmmhmm
boring
mmm
i see
i do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights
you bet
ive always enjoyed the
camaraderie of good friends
competing in games
of chance and skill
yeah yeah well
well do that

the two of us
three bags of tostitos scoops

there was a special
on these tonight
three for one
three for one

oh its a murder
mystery party
brooks not just
any murder mystery
i found this company
they do it super real
they use legit actors
youre not gonna know

ryan laughs excitedly
chuckles
max thats terrible news
contained within
these dossiers
are the clues you will require
to find the kidnappers
youd like for us
to do that yeah
the bureaus whats
the bureaus role in this

you people are in real danger
and youre
running out of time
and i agent henderson
will not stand idly by

okay
we were broken up at the time
i got a hand job
from karen waller
so you had every right to
so why not just tell me
okay fine
it was 10 years ago
i was at a gas station
and i noticed a guy
at the next pump
it was denzel washington
hold up
it actually was denzel
yeah
he was really nice
he made some joke
about how premium gas
is probably the same
as regular
i took a chance
and i asked him
if he wanted to get drinks
he said yes
we both got a little tipsy
i offered to pay for drinks
and he let me
which i thought
was pretty cool
we danced for hours
eventually we ended up
back at his place
and one thing led to another
it was just this crazy thing
that happened
and in a weird way
it made me realize
the only person
i ever wanna be with is you
nah
nah i dont believe it
oh you
mmmmmm chuckles
well i took a picture
with him at the club
i put it in a hidden folder
denzel and michelle
yeah baby thats not denzel
yeah it is
mmm no its not
dude looks
a lot like denzel
but its not him
youre crazy thats
look at that thats denzel
okay let me ask you this
did he say he was denzel
well no
he tried to introduce himself
and i cut him off
because i told him
i knew who he was
what kind of car did he drive
a bmw
hmm
three series
mmm what was his place like
it was a twobedroom condo
and he used the spare room
as an office so
do you hear
what youre saying right now
hold on let me see
clears throat
kevin when you zoom in
the nose gives it away right
goddamn
mmmhmm
look dont beat yourself up
about it okay

look if youre not into this
you kinda gotta tell me
listen
i wanna have a baby but
how do i explain this um
do you remember how we used to
play pacman at fisker lanes
and we could play all night
do you remember this one time i
made it all the way up to level 86
and you were not too far behind right
85 but
and then i kicked your ass
at galaga
so anyway what is the point
mmm anyway
do you remember
how we stayed alive so long
all we did was
we ate the pellets
we never ate the fruit because
the fruit is how they get you
oh youre doing a metaphor
yes but heres the problem
no matter how long you and i
stayed alive in the game
