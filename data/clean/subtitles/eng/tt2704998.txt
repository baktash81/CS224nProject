   rock music continues 
   all cheering 
  annie  lot of pressure here 
  max  yeah 
annie  you miss 
you lose it all 
max  stay outta my head 
and you know you have
a distinct advantage
with the smaller hands  right 
your goal posts
are not as big 
well  i guess you
should ve married uma thurman 
yeah  that would ve
been great 
there s a snap 
  here s the hold 
   cell phone chimes 
  ooh 
  and a text 
that was interference 
annie  sorry  honey  i know
how much that meant to you 
  come on 
  dr  chin is ready for you 
uh  great 
i think we ve determined
why you ve been
having trouble conceiving 
  max  okay  let s have it 
  annie  okay  great 
oh  what s that look  is it me 
of course it s me 
i m not loving your semen 
  oh 
  your count is excellent 
but your motility
is well below normal 
  that s too bad 
  what would cause that 
it can be genetic 
environmental factors 
nine times out of 10  though 
it s psychological 
have you been feeling
anxious or stressed 
no  i don t think so 
not really 
 high pitched  uh   
he s always a little stressed 
you don t have to write   
i m not   
honey  she s writing it down 
well  max is very competitive 
as am i 
we sure are 
one of the reasons
i fell in love with him 
maybe that makes him
a little more prone
to stress than normal people 
 normal people  
how long has this
been going on  max 
it s not going on 
oh  well  you did say
even when you were a kid 
you would freak out
if you lost at anything 
oh  i was a kid 
especially if you lost
to your brother 
hmm 
hey  is that what this is 
no 
you have been so uptight
since you found out that
brooks is coming to town 
i don t think that s true 
  could that be a factor in all this 
  let s be fair 
sibling rivalry
can be very powerful 
cain and abel  the baldwins 
  the what 
  the brothers 
i m not sure
why we re discussing this 
she s not a therapist 
you re not a therapist  right 
with all respect 
  no  but i am a doctor 
  sure 
and i believe in treating
the whole patient 
so  what is it
about your brother
that makes you
feel emasculated 
are we gonna do this 
we re right next to the room
where i masturbated 
i think he has it in his head
that brooks is cooler
and more successful
and hotter than he is 
i never said  hotter  
he s charming 
that s interesting 
and is he single 
max  what s that 
i don t know
if i mentioned it 
but keith and i
are on a trial separation 
  oh 
  keith 
uh  keith 
so  do you think your brother would
wanna grab a cup of coffee with me 
 sighs  gosh  i don t know 
well  it doesn t hurt to ask 
hurts a little   scoffs 
now  is he a tall fella 
 cause i m only 5 2  
we re all done with my semen 
he is taller than max 
dr  chin  good 
annie  but he did date
this ballerina once 
and she was just
a teeny tiny little thing 
ooh 
honey  gary 
don t mention
game night  okay 
mmm hmm 
  good evening  max 
  hey  gary 
  annie 
  hello there 
hi  gary 
just checking the mail 
oh  yeah 
some people check it
earlier in the day 
but there s always a risk
that the mail carrier
hasn t come yet 
this spares me the chance of
a futile trip to the mailbox 
uh huh 
plus  it allows bastian here
the opportunity to urinate 
you have a good one 
any plans for this evening 
max  no 
perhaps a game night 
we re just gonna stay in 
  just the two of us 
  mmm hmm 
  boring 
  mmm 
i see 
i do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights 
you bet 
i ve always enjoyed the
camaraderie of good friends
competing in games
of chance and skill 
yeah  yeah  well 
we ll do that 
but tonight it s just
the two of us 
three bags of tostitos scoops 
i notice 
there was a special
on these tonight 
three for one 
three for one 
yup 
how can that be profitable
for frito lay 
these corporations 
i don t know
what they re doing 
 chuckles 
well  you two
enjoy each other 
it s often we don t appreciate
what we have until it s gone 
  max  i think that s it 
  annie  okay 
bye bye 
if gary sees the others
coming  we re screwed 
no  no  honey 
it s not gonna be a problem 
i was very clear with everyone
to park far away
and just to sneak in quietly 
you know 
but now  i mean 
you don t think
we re being dicks  do you 
should we just
still invite the guy 
he really seemed
like he wanted to play

of red wine and rosemary 
  that sounds so yummy  though 
  damn it

annie  i m sorry 
now  the bulgarian s guys

and the only way

marlon freeman guy 
i can t believe your brother s
been lying to us this whole time 
he s even cooler
than we thought 
honey  i think you sewed
my arm to my sleeve 
i didn t even know morgan
freeman collected faberge eggs 
aren t those worth
millions of dollars 
it s marlon freeman 
but that s just an alias 
somehow  we gotta find out his
real name  find out his address 
  police computer 
  max  what do you mean 
i once dated this girl
whose father was a cop 
she showed me
her dad s police computer 
it has a database with
every known alias on it 
i bet we could find marlon
wayans  real name on it 
so  if we called her up 
would she let you go
on her dad s computer 
no  no way  that ended badly 
so  how are we gonna get into
a police computer
without the cops knowing

michelle 
that s all i can think about 
and that s saying a lot 
considering we got
eyes wide fight club
going on downstairs 
why is this
so important to you 
because  michelle  look 
i am losing my mind here 
okay 
we were broken up at the time 
i got a hand job
from karen waller 
so you had every right to 
so  why not just tell me 
okay  fine 
it was 10 years ago 
i was at a gas station 
and i noticed a guy
at the next pump 
it was denzel washington 
hold up 
it actually was denzel 
yeah 
he was really nice 
he made some joke
about how premium gas
is probably the same
as regular 
i took a chance 
and i asked him
if he wanted to get drinks 
he said yes 
we both got a little tipsy 
i offered to pay for drinks 
and he let me 
which i thought
was pretty cool 
we danced for hours 
eventually  we ended up
back at his place 
and one thing led to another 
it was just this crazy thing
that happened
and  in a weird way 
it made me realize
the only person
i ever wanna be with is you 
nah 
nah  i don t believe it 
  oh  you   
  mmm mmm   chuckles 
well  i took a picture
with him at the club 
i put it in a hidden folder 
denzel and michelle 
yeah  baby  that s not denzel 
yeah  it is 
mmm  no  it s not 
dude looks
a lot like denzel 
but it s not him 
you re crazy  that s   
look at that  that s denzel 
okay  let me ask you this 
did he say he was denzel 
well  no   
he tried to introduce himself 
and i cut him off
because i told him
i knew who he was 
  what kind of car did he drive 
  a bmw 
  hmm 
  three series 
mmm  what was his place like 
it was a two bedroom condo 
and he used the spare room
as an office  so   
do you hear
what you re saying right now 
hold on  let me see 
 clears throat 
kevin  when you zoom in 
the nose gives it away  right 
  goddamn 
  mmm hmm 
look  don t beat yourself up
about it  okay 
there is some good news 
 imitates denzel washington 
if you wanna get with denzel 
he s standing right here 
 laughs  because the real
denzel ain t got shit on me 
 both laughing 
honey  how does this monster
have five kids 
we don t get to have one 
well  his wife looks like
she s about 15 
uh    yeah  my sperm are fine 
right  right  no  i know 
honey  we re just gonna   
we re gonna keep plugging away
until something sticks  okay 
gee  you really sound like a
guy who wants to have a kid 
well  you know  i m just   
i m a little distracted
right now  honey 
as you might imagine 
look  if you re not into this 
you kinda gotta tell me 
listen 
i wanna have a baby  but
how do i explain this  um   
do you remember how we used to
play pac man at fisker lanes
and we could play all night 
do you remember this one time  i
made it all the way up to level 86 
  and you were not too far behind  right 
  85  but   
and then i kicked your ass
at galaga 
  so anyway  what is the point 
  mmm    anyway 
do you remember
how we stayed alive so long 
all we did was
we ate the pellets 
we never ate the fruit because
the fruit is how they get you 
oh  you re doing a metaphor 
yes  but here s the problem 
no matter how long you and i
stayed alive in the game 
neither one of us ever made it
up to the leader board 
and you think
if we have a baby 
we ll be officially
settling down 
and you ll never make it
onto the leader board of life 
that s such a good metaphor 
yeah  no  it s not 
  it s kind of bullshit 
  why 
  what are we  16 years old 
  no 
  you wanna go backpacking through europe  huh 
  uh uh 
you wanna  like 
have some wine coolers
on a football field
with rebecca de mornay 
not specifically 
you know who s always gone
for the fruit  max 
your criminal brother 
and that is why
the ghosts
are about to eat him 
look who s embracing
the metaphor 
i was so   
wow  you know what 
all this time 
i ve just been thinking
that if i helped you
beat brooks 
you would be less stressed

beat brooks 
you wanna be brooks
