to deputy chief of mission

an8speaks russian
indistinct chatter
emily thank you
james mm
emily lovely as ever
ah
you do brighten up
the old place
oh thank you
emily
sir
please sit down
ah
ive brought you boys a present
ah thank you
rachel step out
door opens
door closes
i fear a nuclear war is coming
and i want to help you
prevent it
its got my attention
emily hes smart
gave us a photo
only wed have copies of
from a few years ago
in our embassy in turkey
say hello to colonel oleg
vladimirovich penkovsky
code name ironbark
artillery officer
during the war
decorated 13 times
now hes back in moscow
running the state committee
for scientific research
but thats just a cover
hes gru
why they toss him
hand like this
i keep place to my chest
james because they have
no way to make contact
the cia is weak in moscow
after that
disaster with popov am i right
were thin on the ground
we need your help
lets get him out
weve got a number of
good officers in our embassy
ill have one make contact
with penkovsky
get this sorted out
emily i did have a thought
this is a gru colonel
hes so visible
im worried
we could blow penkovsky
just by making an approach
thats always a risk what would
the cia have us do instead
i dont know
maybe use someone
outside the embassy
who the kgb wont suspect
say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world
do we know of someone
who could fit the bill
greville i have to warn you
i have a pretty good feeling
about this
oh hell
man 1 laughs
man 2 laughs
man 1 and greville
that is the saddest thing
ive ever seen
greville grunts
well serves me right
i should keep my mouth shut
man 1 laughs
man 2
now we have to make it up
we probably have some brochures
man 1 of what
greville
a drink first i think
you know my reputation
parts i want you to know anyway
chuckles
i represent
the top manufacturers
who sell the best products
on the market
so in combination with you
gentlemen knowing your business
i think itd be much better if
instead of my usual song
and dance
i just listen you tell me what
your problems are
and if i think i have a client
that may have a solution
lets talk it through
if not lets keep drinking
so tell me what do you need
man thanks greville
greville bye
thunder rumbling
it still doesnt add up
well did you miss something
maybe
door bangs
like carrying the four
oh yes
oh yes
greville how are you
oh very well except our son
keeps confusing me
helping with his homework
with me doing it for him
greville oh
how was your day
greville oh the usual
some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up
no really
you should have seen me
i sold a dozen lace by throwing
the easiest putt
in the history of putting
i feel filthy
no no
you have to play golf badly
but arent you used to that
greville uhhuh
well just think
another 23 years of this
and then were off
to the good life
or i could retire early
andrew you dont want
to go to university do you
telephone ringing
andrew not really
greville perfect
well im not feeding
either of you
then what youre smiling at
be at least 50 years
until you can retire
james greville wynne please
yeah let me see if hes home
sounds like work
no tell them im in my chair
yes hes just walked in
greville wynne
greville this is james dobie
from the board of trade
we met last year
yes yes at the reception
of whitehall
james
how good to hear from you
james hello
james greville
i hope you dont mind
my friend helen is a consultant
in from the states
i thought why not
greville wynne a real pleasure
helen talbot likewise
james tells me youve been
working in eastern europe
hmm more and more
tremendous opportunities
plenty of demand
no local supplies
czechoslovakia hungary
ghastly food chuckles
chuckles
what about the soviet union
greville
oh not just yet someday
id like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first
actually now might be
the perfect time
oh really why
what did you hear
well
helen and i have associates
who would be interested
to see what might come of it
it would be a real service
to great britain
and the world
indistinct chatter
forgive me im just a bit
sorry james
i know you said you had
an office in board of trade
but
is it possible
that you actually work
at a different branch
of her majestys government
oh my
this is unexpected
stammers
sorry i i dont understand
why im im
im just a salesman
exactly an ordinary salesman
with no connection
to the government
look this is all fascinating
i mean i really cant believe
im actually having lunch
with spies chuckles
but chuckles
clears throat
i couldnt possibly
what would you want me to do
nothing dodgy nothing illegal
just what you would
naturally do
greville
im sorry i dont follow
someone in your field
hoping to do business
in the soviet union
how would you get started
well i suppose id set up
a meeting
with the state committee
for scientific research
in moscow
that sounds fine
so you want me to go to moscow
and then
do business
all this secrecy
must seem absurd
but i promise its to help you
we want you to act exactly like
the ordinary businessman
you are
thatll be much easier
if you dont know any details
right but would i be putting
myself in danger
that detail i i have to know
greville
let me put this delicately
youre a middleaged businessman
who drinks a bit too much
and isnt exactly in top shape
during the war
you were a private
never even saw combat
my point is if this mission
was the least bit dangerous
you really are the last man
wed send
well thank you for putting it
so delicately
helen make sure you wear it
while youre in moscow
what does this do
shoot poison dart
thank you so much greville
youre a good man
and i know we can count on you
to be discreet
sheila hows your day
greville oh it was fine
mine was wonderful
thank you so much for asking
so sorry ive got a head
full of contracts
uh you out with uh tomado
werent you
yes we were at the club
planning the charity dinner
that was amusing
huh
before you ask if you have
to come yes you have to come
ive had an interesting lead
sheila really
might look at doing a little bit
of work in the soviet union
sheila hmm do stay out
of the gulag darling

after you
oleg it is good you have dealt
with other communist
governments
but so far from home
do you not prefer to work
in england
i do what i can
to keep things interesting
oleg chuckles
but then
theres the political situation
this is not good time
for east and west
well what i like to say
is no matter what
the politicians are doing
factories still need machines
machines still need parts
im a businessman
so i stick to business
oleg chuckles
greville hmm
do you have a family
i do a boy hes ten
i wanted a boy very much
then we had a girl
now shes my world
mm likely not destroying

laughs
both slurp
i want to show you another side
of russia

greville
it was a gift from a friend

i sent word to your friend

i think the word is amateur
yes exactly amateur
ive dreamt of this moment
for a very long time thank you
i wish i could tell you
how much this means
i think id rather
that you didnt tell me
what happens now
i dont need to do anything
do i
oleg no you go home
then you invite me
to visit london
with a trade delegation
to meet your clients
your government would allow you
they would be thrilled
part of my job
is to steal technology
from the west
your friend is clever
well oleg may i call you oleg
in english
my name doesnt sound good
call me alex
alex
youre a good amateur
sighs
greville sighs
lets twist again playing
since you took me

to the west end
some of the finest theater
in the world
alex that would be good
come on lets twist again
like we did last summer
yeah lets twist again

an8 man speaking russian

all singing in russian
greville off you go
man hello
greville hello goodbye
speaks russian
door opens
door closes
greville sighs
helen
we know youre a patriot
we know how hard
this must be for you
colonel
whatever brought you here
it must frighten you more than
the danger of being here
khrushchev
khrushchev frightens me
he is impulsive chaotic
a man like him should have
no clear command
the west has fallen for his lie
a lie that soviet regime
is growing soft it is not
khrushchev wants confrontation
with america
hes looking for one
do you have anything
you could share with us
documents perhaps
would you like to read
the new edition
of military thought
i need assurances from you
if it becomes necessary
i must able to defect
with my family
absolutely whenever you want
i will remain in place
and keep you updated
on the kremlins thinking
but tell your government
they must use
my information wisely
not as a weapon
but as a tool to bring peace
despite what khrushchev claims
americas nuclear arsenal
is still far superior to ours
we do not yet have
first strike capacity
you can annihilate us
but we cannot annihilate you
but that wont worry
the politburo
do you think in the end
thatll keep khrushchev
from going too far
you have to be up
in a few hours
im fine
no hes right
we can finish this up
tomorrow night
and one last thing
we need to talk about greville
dont worry you wont have
to deal with him anymore
no
it was penkovskys idea
youre perfect
youre a civilian
so the kgb
wont be watching you
youll be in and out of moscow
anyway to setup contracts
you still wont know
any specifics
youll just be a courier
just a courier
for russian sea
my god i cant believe
youre bloody serious
weve gone over it
with penkovsky
we believe the risk
to you is minimal
and well pay you
i make my own money
thank you very much
i have a wife and a child
either of you have a family
oh no
dont suppose you could tell me
about that
not a lot you can tell me about
is there helen james
i can tell you wed both
put ourselves in harms way
when necessary and this
is terribly necessary greville
then might i suggest you
find someone
whos suited for it
sorry i really have done
all i can for you
helen greville listen
the fourminute warning
it wont do you any good
what
helen the fourminute warning
before a soviet nuclear missile
hits the uk
no i know what that
what are you talking about
that thats what this has
all been about
nuclear war come on
see heres the problem for you
your house is a 12minute drive
from your office
ten minutes if you really push
right
and youre usually out
on a sales call anyway
so youre not getting back
to sheila in time
and andrews school
thats nine minutes
from your house
15 from your office
and no ones
getting to him either
hell get herded
into the school basement
i looked up the building plans
thats a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter
same with your basement
actually
only the government
has decent shelters
what do you do
hmm
you can spend those four minutes
trying to get sheila
on the phone
but you wont be able
to get through
or you can think about
how you might have helped
stop this from happening
but you didnt
and then thats it
how dare you
truly well be better off
if he doesnt do it
hell do it
doorbell rings
greville no i got it
sheila all right
alex hello
welcome do come in
oh hello
alex hello
oh vodka lovely
i was just saying to greville
we didnt drink
nearly enough last night
thank you uh do come in
alex thank you
this is for andrew
very kind thank you
this way
dad told me about moscow
whats it like in the rest
of russia
it is very beautiful
especially where i come from
a lot of trees a lot of sky
you feel
very alone but in a good way
greville id like to see that
but then of course
your government
isnt all that keen
on foreigners
just wandering around
do the russians really hate us
that much
i think theyd like our children
to be a little more polite
andrew
our politicians
hate your politicians
and yours hate ours
do not forget that
but the people your father
and i we do business
we spend time together
i meet his family
maybe were only two people
but this is how things change
andrew hmm
what if i get caught
you wont
you dont know that
theyd execute me correct
not if they thought youre just
a courier that you took packages
but didnt know
what was in them
they would hold you to trade
for one of theirs
for how long
a couple of years
oh just a couple of years
rotting in some russian gulag
they will not catch us
the kgb will have no idea
listen im better at this
than they are
fine but im not
alex look your work
it is only deception
controlling your emotion
i watched you do it in moscow
you did it tonight
its really not the same thing
if were caught they would
definitely execute me
well im very sorry
but thats your choice
alex that is how sure i am
that you can do this
im betting my life on it
greville how can i explain
this to sheila
alex
she cannot know the truth
for her own safety for yours
greville
i cant tell her any of it
alex no
well what have you told
your wife
because you know what shed say
dont do it
im right arent i
sheilas no fool
and in the past ive
given her reason
not to trust me dully
then you have to lie better
there are good lies
sometimes a lie is gift
an act of love
im sorry it has to be you
but greville
it has to be you
in moscow you must
at all times
follow the rules of the art
in english theres a word
tradecraft
alex yes
you must follow tradecraft
everyone you meet
assume they are kgb
waiters hotel staff
my driver everyone
even if they are
not actual kgb officers
they still make reports
to kgb
greville ooh
alex every russian is an eye
of the state
every room youre in
assume it is bugged
james even inside our embassy
alex
especially inside your embassy
still our embassy will be
a good failsafe
in the event of any
complication
alex
the kgb also uses lip readers
you wont be able to tell
who they are
so never discuss
groans
anything sensitive
unless i do first
hows your family
very well thank you
hows yours
alex we will be seeing
each other often
to throw off suspicion
i will tell my colleagues
i recruited you as a source
james youll keep
colonel penkovsky supplied
with material
on steel manufacturing
industrial production
and so on
unclassified
but hard to come by
greville theyll believe
i would do that
alex of course
you are a greedy capitalist
you want to keep
the contracts coming
and from now on every moment
youre in moscow
you will be selling one thing
the idea that you are
an ordinary businessman
and nothing more
than an ordinary businessman
greville
well gentlemen i hope
this is the first of many
thank you all very very much
for good health
and for business
i should get you to the airport
yes yes please
helen
do you have any questions
gentlemen till next time
thank you
greville i want to be certain
of one thing
i need to know
that if anything happens to me
my wife and son
will be provided for
man you have my word
and i speak for the crown
an8speaks russian
thank you alex bye
thank you
both moan
sheila breathes heavily
my where did that come from
i missed you

ironbarks the real thing
well this just became
the biggest thing
going in the whole
soviet section
now if i keep you on this

inhales hell
this is almost worth
all the bullshit
of dealing with the brits
how is it with those assholes
theyre good guys
i just have to make them think
theyre in charge
oh this is such an honor
im im learning so much
chuckles
man over tv
despite growing tensions
between america and the soviet
until this morning
there was essentially
free passage
between east and west berlin
but overnight without warning
the communist authorities
have barricaded off the city
in response
president kennedy has vowed
to increase
americas military presence
directly speaking
with general clay
who is stationed in berlin
grev would you think its safe
to keep going to moscow
greville
yes certainly its fine
sheila even with all this
thats in berlin darling
nowhere near moscow
sheila
yes i know where berlin is
and i know the russians
and the americans
greville please do let me
are killing any
run my business
man over tv
today in the arctic
the soviet union

the most powerful
nuclear weapon ever detonated
i have the figures
you were asking

typewriter keys clacking
man over tv
today every inhabitant
of this planet
woman just down there
every man
woman and child
man right here maam
lives under a nuclear sword
of damocles
hanging by the slenderest
of thread
capable of being cut
at any moment by accident
or miscalculation
or by madness
the weapons of war
must be abolished
before they abolish us
groaning
greville

i didnt want you
to be involved
its the business
yeah weve
hit a bit of a rough patch
woman
that makes sense doesnt it
men and money
my god colin went almost mad
last year
when his job
looked the tiniest bit shaky
sighs
i wish it made sense
but its not just that
its everything
hes exercising all the time
and hes become so
energetic in bed
that all sounds so awful
laughs poor you chuckles
im so sorry i shouldnt joke
clears throat
i know greville had
an indiscretion once before but
it doesnt mean
hes having an affair now
then why is he so secretive
with me
and defensive
and its always worse
whenever he comes home
from moscow
thats when it all started
moscow
clicks tongue oh
sheila might be better
if you didnt have to travel
so much
better for our family
greville darling i told you
its very important
we need the money
sheila the money
greville money yes
i thought you needed the club
and you havent caught
any expenses
and now were going
to a smart restaurant

greville im asking you to stop
going to moscow
im asking you as your wife

greville alex

is something the matter
just a bit of trouble at home
sighs
one day you will be able
to tell sheila
what you have done
and shell be very proud of you
that might be a bit too late
sometimes vera
she also struggles with my work
yes but your wife married
a soldier
mine married a salesman
alex you know why
my government will not let you
travel outside moscow
they want to hide the suffering
in the city life is all right
but in the country
where im from

for nina
i want her to be free
from the state
someday if our work succeeds
when i feel the danger is over

my clearance
but i dont think its coming
from intercepts
it feels like they might have
a source
an8man speaking russian
an8khrushchev speaks russian
man i i just dont see it
for them to actually do that
to try and sneak nukes
into our backyard
i mean it would be
itll be like an act of war
even khrushchev
isnt that crazy
all i can tell you
is that ironbark
wouldnt be in the job
he or she is in

can they get a u2 in the air
this time of year theres just
too much cloud cover
til october youre all i got
mmhmm
when i went back to my hotel
they searched my room
but they didnt find anything
obviously he wouldnt be here
if they had
im saying hes still
in the clear
it could just have been
a routine check which he passed
thats it greville
were pulling you out
greville
but what about penkovsky
i didnt have a chance
to warn him
well have to find another way
to communicate with him
but you dont need to worry
about that
no you dont understand
thats why hes in danger
as well
if the kgb have been looking
at me
theyll be looking at him too
hes still set to come here
for the trade fair next month
doesnt he
greville yes
james then hes all right
if he was under suspicion
theyd never let him
leave the country
indistinct chatter

whatever he likes hes more
than earned his retirement
and greville so have you
outstanding work

inhales deeply understood
well thank you

this government as promised
has maintained
the closest surveillance
of the soviet military buildup
on the island of cuba
within the past week
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact
that a series of offensive
missiles sites
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island
the purpose of these bases
can be none other
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability
against the western hemisphere
it shall be the policy
of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile
launched from cuba
against any nation
in the western hemisphere
as an attack
by the soviet union
on the united states
requiring a full
retaliatory response
upon the soviet union
i call upon chairman khrushchev
to halt and eliminate
this clandestine

so theres no way to coordinate
with him or plan it out
wed have to kidnap him
and his family off the street
helen itd be a disaster
greville and if they
wont let them leave then what
james it was my idea
to bring you into all this
i never should have done that
to you im sorry
well then thats it
were just going to abandon him
and let the kgb murder him
whenever they get round to it
this is a hard truth
but if things were
the other way around
penkovsky would abandon you
no no he would not
hes a professional
we use people
he would do
just what im doing now
move on go home
go home to your family
youre wrong
what
youre the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that
but not penkovsky
youve met him once i know him
he would never leave me to die
and im not leaving him
james im afraid
its not your decision
you said the problem was
theres no way to coordinate
to let penkovsky know about
the escape plan
but there is a way
me
i can tell him
if i go back to moscow
you would do that
yes
james no he wouldnt
because he hasnt entirely
lost his mind
james be a bloody professional
im volunteering to bring back
the best source
of soviet intelligence
you got at a time
where russia and america
are on the brink of nuclear war
you talk about using people
for gods sake use me
if you go back to moscow
ill go with you
at no risk to herself
shell have diplomatic immunity
she thinks youre a fool
helen i will do everything
in my power to get both of you
out of there

within 24 hours
indistinct chatter from tv
indistinct clamor
officer 1 strip

officer 2 shouts
officer 1 speaks russian
grunts

cell door opens
cell door closes
officer speaks russian
greville breathes heavily
fly buzzing
one two three
helen thank you
you were right
you were right too
we had to try
mrs wynne im james dobie
with the board of trade
may we come in
yes please
oh my god
james its absurd of course
the foreign office is hard
at work sorting this out
but its a delicate situation
why
oleg penkovsky has been arrested
as well which is quite serious
the russians are claiming
greville was caught up
in some sort of
well espionage
the foreign office will be
in touch soon
and while
this is all being resolved
the crown will provide
for you and your son
its true isnt it
whats true
greville was working
with penkovsky like they say
james no no of course not
can i call greville
i need to speak to him
i dont think thats
no i have to i have to
i have to tell him that
im sorry
breathing heavily
i thought he was
my god ive been so stupid
door opens
andrew mommy
andrew go to your room
andrew who are
andrew go to your room
james
im a friend of your fathers
he told me you have
quite the trophy collection
could you show me
andrew please its all right
door closes
dont tell me its not true
i know my husband
i know hes been acting
dont tell me its not true
there are things
i cant say to you
i can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man
and he needs you now
he needs your help mrs wynne
you see once the russians
realize greville is innocent
your government will be able
to get him home safe
in time
but if the russians do decide
that greville actually
is some kind of spy
im so sorry
scoffs
helen
so when you talk to anybody
that means your family
your friends andrew
and especially the press
you have to tell them
that none of this
could possibly be true
and you have to be
very convincing
can you do that
can you do that for greville
i cant imagine what penkovsky
couldve confessed to
i im sorry
i dont know what this is
we know everything
we know that penkovsky gave you
packages to take to the west
well yes a few times
then you admit it
admit what i didnt know
that i was doing anything wrong
you think stealing
soviet intelligence
wasnt wrong
greville if that is what
was happening i didnt know it
i never asked him
what was in the packages
i didnt think
it was my business
who did you give these
packages to
greville
well i dropped them off
in various addresses
around london
i never thought anything of it
mr wynne
you were asking me to believe
that you are very very stupid
greville oh well yes
i suppose in your world i am
but look im just a salesman
i want my clients to like me
so if that meant doing
a favor for penkovsky
every now and then
i really didnt see the harm
exhales
groans
hi
ah that is so sweet of you
chuckles
oh but i wish i could
invite you in im just
im in the middle of 20 things
oh no no thats fine
im so glad to see youre well
its been ages
weve all been worried
yes well do say hello for me
of course i saw that ridiculous
piece in the mail
its so absurd
you dont think there could be
any truth to it do you
what theyre saying
about greville
dont be ridiculous
how could greville ever spy
on soviets
he couldnt even hide
his affair for me
right
thank you again for dropping by
and this was so sweet of you
oh
we should have tea
ill be in touch thank you
yes
oh all right bye
clears throat
bulb buzzing
breathing heavily
oleg for years the americans
have had the nuclear missiles
in turkey
aimed right at us
oh but how dare
we put missiles in cuba
is that fair
i dont know
mm
do you realize your country
has left you here to die
no sir
i dont believe thats true
indistinct
why
why
why for god sake
what have i done banging
i didnt do anything
i didnt do it you
you fucking animals
sobs
cell door opens
greville gasps
officer
you will not touch sit down
sit down
oh my god darling
i know ive been ill
but im on the mend now
and this will help
this will help
very much
what are they doing
what the hell are you people
doing to him
greville its not like that
theyve been quite respectful
given the circumstance
you mustnt fault them
really you mustnt
what youre going through
its all so unfair
im sorry for what happened
i feel wretched
for doubting you
no no couldnt be helped
im really so glad youre here
i missed you both
very much
the foreign office said
thats a very good sign
im being allowed to visit you
hmm
sheila they said it might
it might still take a while yet
to get you home
since the russians backed down
in cuba
theyre being very stubborn
right now
what happened in cuba
well they removed the missiles
its its all fine now
no more about this
sheila
and were trying very hard
it might take another
it might take another year
or two
tell me something about home
tell me what i have
to look forward to
well the gardens cooperating
a bit
finally chuckles
and we have tomatoes this year
and andrew he
he passed his maths exam
somehow chuckles
chuckles
youd be proud
how are you
im
im all right
really
if you can be strong enough
for this
when you come home
i hope we can start again
and i was very foolish
im sorry
but i just want you to know that
every moment ive been here
i have done nothing
but think about
how im going to get home
to you
really
i will
i will snivels
man its a matter of who
we cant send someone
of real value
not for wynne
wynne wasnt valuable
were all alive arent we
hes not an officer
is the point
if we propose an officer
of theirs that sends a message
about how we perceive wynne
the wrong message
if you let wynne die over there
and he will die
a lot sooner than you think
no one will ever trust mi6
to protect them
ever again
james sighs
you feel guilty
i know
but you were doing your job
and wynne
is our countryman emily
i promise
well get him home
oleg if you think penkovsky
will protect you
you think too highly of him
he betrayed his country
his family
why not you
it is every man for himself
yes
hi
i have not seen a mirror
for a long time
i like to think
im still quite worth
for the time
i wasnt sure
id ever see you again
im so sorry
youre here greville
i hope you can forgive me
for this
and for what i had to do
what you mean
what you had to do
i held back
for as long as i could
i have to protect
my family greville
to save them i had to tell
the kgb the truth
all of the truth
i told them
i gave you pictures that
helped americans
find missiles in cuba
and of course i told them
you didnt know what was
in the packages i gave you
greville
i thought i could make
the world a safer place
but i failed
all this
betraying my country
my people all for nothing
alex
of course i forgive you
i have to look
after my family too
easier now i know
theres not gonna be
a nuclear war
because khrushchev
withdrew his missiles
cell door opens
because of you
because of you
you
you did it alex you did it
you you did it
because of you alex
you did it
indistinct chatter
alex
maybe were only two people
but this is how things change
andrew daddy where are you
man mr wynne youve just
spoken to your wife
what were your first words
to her
and what were her first
words to you
frankly
were both rather speechless
there were no words
for a moment
man do you have any idea
of what youre going to do
in the future
oh i want to get back
to my normal business activities
as soon as i possibly can
man well is that
to the same company
with my own company
man 2 will you travel
in east europe again
