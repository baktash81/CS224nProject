  an8  speaks russian 
  an8  speaks russian 
  an8  speaks russian 
  an8  speaks russian 
excuse me 
could you give me a light 
yeah  sure 
you re americans  yes 
yes  sir 
we re on a summer trip 
please 
take this to your embassy 
it is vital 
i have no other way 
come on  let s get out of here 
do not go back to your hotel 
straight to the embassy 
give this only
to deputy chief of mission 
understand 
  an8  speaks russian 
 indistinct chatter 
   emily  thank you 
   james  mm 
  emily  lovely as ever 
  ah 
you do brighten up
the old place 
oh  thank you 
  emily 
  sir 
  please sit down 
  ah 
i ve brought you boys a present 
ah  thank you 
rachel  step out 
 door opens 
   door closes 
  i fear a nuclear war is coming
and i want to help you
prevent it 
it s got my attention 
 emily  he s smart 
gave us a photo
only we d have copies of
from a few years ago
in our embassy in turkey 
say hello to colonel oleg
vladimirovich penkovsky 
code name  ironbark  
artillery officer
during the war 
decorated 13 times 
now he s back in moscow
running the state committee
for scientific research 
but that s just a cover 
he s gru 
why they toss him 
hand like this
i keep place to my chest 
 james  because they have
no way to make contact 
the cia is weak in moscow
after that   
disaster with popov  am i right 
we re thin on the ground 
we need your help 
let s get him out 
we ve got a number of
good officers in our embassy 
i ll have one make contact
with penkovsky 
  get this sorted out 
   emily  i did have a thought 
this is a gru colonel 
he s so visible 
i m worried
we could blow penkovsky
just by making an approach 
that s always a risk  what would
the cia have us do instead 
i don t know 
maybe use someone
outside the embassy
who the kgb won t suspect 
say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world 
do we know of someone
who could fit the bill 
 greville  i have to warn you 
i have a pretty good feeling
about this 
oh  hell 
   man 1 laughs 
   man 2 laughs 
 man 1  and greville 
that is the saddest thing
i ve ever seen 
 greville grunts 
well  serves me right 
  i should keep my mouth shut 
   man 1 laughs 
 man 2 
now we have to make it up 
we probably have some brochures 
 man 1  of what 
 greville 
a drink first  i think 
you know my reputation 
parts i want you to know anyway 
 chuckles 
i represent
the top manufacturers
who sell the best products
on the market 
so in combination with you
gentlemen knowing your business 
i think it d be much better if
instead of my usual song
and dance 
i just listen  you tell me what
your problems are 
and if i think i have a client
that may have a solution 
let s talk it through 
if not  let s keep drinking 
so tell me  what do you need 
   man  thanks  greville 
   greville  bye 
 thunder rumbling 
it still doesn t add up 
well  did you miss something
maybe 
 door bangs 
  like carrying the four 
  oh  yes 
  oh  yes 
   greville  how are you 
oh  very well  except our son
keeps confusing me
helping with his homework
with me doing it for him 
 greville  oh 
  how was your day 
   greville  oh  the usual 
some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up 
no  really 
you should have seen me 
i sold a dozen lace by throwing
the easiest putt
in the history of putting 
  i feel filthy 
  no  no 
you have to play golf badly 
  but aren t you used to that 
   greville  uh huh 
well  just think
another 23 years of this
and then we re off
to the good life 
or i could retire early 
andrew  you don t want
to go to university  do you 
   telephone ringing 
   andrew  not really 
   greville  perfect 
  well  i m not feeding
either of you 
then what you re smiling at 
be at least 50 years
until you can retire 
   james  greville wynne  please 
  yeah  let me see if he s home 
  sounds like work 
  no  tell them i m in my chair 
yes  he s just walked in 
  greville wynne 
  greville  this is james dobie
from the board of trade 
we met last year 
yes  yes  at the reception
of whitehall 
james 
how good to hear from you 
  james  hello 
   james  greville 
i hope you don t mind 
my friend helen is a consultant
in from the states 
i thought   why not  
greville wynne  a real pleasure 
helen talbot  likewise 
james tells me you ve been
working in eastern europe 
hmm  more and more 
tremendous opportunities 
plenty of demand 
no local supplies 
czechoslovakia  hungary 
  ghastly food   chuckles 
   chuckles 
what about the soviet union 
 greville 
oh  not just yet  someday 
i d like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first 
actually now might be
the perfect time 
oh  really  why 
what did you hear 
well 
helen and i have associates
who would be interested
to see what might come of it 
it would be a real service
to great britain 
and the world 
 indistinct chatter 
forgive me  i m just a bit   
sorry  james 
i know you said you had
an office in board of trade 
but   
is it possible
that you actually work   
at a different branch
of her majesty s government 
oh  my 
this is unexpected 
 stammers 
sorry  i    i don t understand 
why  i m    i m   
i m just a salesman 
exactly  an ordinary salesman
with no connection
to the government 
look  this is all fascinating 
i mean  i really can t believe
i m actually having lunch
with spies   chuckles 
but     chuckles 
 clears throat 
   i couldn t possibly   
  what would you want me to do 
  nothing dodgy  nothing illegal 
just what you would
naturally do 
 greville 
i m sorry  i don t follow 
someone in your field
hoping to do business
in the soviet union 
how would you get started 
well  i suppose i d set up
a meeting
with the state committee
for scientific research
in moscow 
that sounds fine 
so you want me to go to moscow
and then   
do business 
all this secrecy
must seem absurd
but i promise  it s to help you 
we want you to act exactly like
the ordinary businessman
you are 
that ll be much easier
if you don t know any details 
right  but would i be putting
myself in danger 
that detail  i    i have to know 
greville 
let me put this delicately 
you re a middle aged businessman
who drinks a bit too much
and isn t exactly in top shape 
during the war 
you were a private 
never even saw combat 
my point is  if this mission
was the least bit dangerous 
you really are the last man
we d send 
well  thank you for putting it
so delicately 
 helen  make sure you wear it
while you re in moscow 
what does this do 
shoot poison dart 
thank you so much  greville 
you re a good man 
and i know we can count on you
to be discreet 
 sheila  how s your day 
 greville  oh  it was fine 
mine was wonderful 
thank you so much for asking 
so sorry  i ve got a head
full of contracts 
uh  you out with  uh  tomado 
weren t you 
yes  we were at the club 
planning the charity dinner 
  that was amusing 
  huh 
before you ask if you have
to come  yes  you have to come 
  i ve had an interesting lead 
   sheila  really 
might look at doing a little bit
of work in the soviet union 
 sheila  hmm  do stay out
of the gulag  darling 
  an8  speaks russian 
 woman speaking russian over pa 
how do you do  greville wynne 
pleasure 
how do you do  greville wynne 
pleasure 
how do you do  how do you do 
and this is the head
of our committee 
oleg penkovsky 
 greville 
ah  pleasure to meet you 
thank you for coming 
i m not here to tell you
what is best
for soviet industry 
 speaks russian 
you gentlemen know that
far better than i ever will 
 speaks russian 
i m here simply
to open a door   
 speaks russian 
   to the top manufacturers
in the west 
 speaks russian 
your proposal is interesting 
  would you like to have lunch 
  of course   
after you 
 oleg  it is good you have dealt
with other communist
governments
but so far from home 
do you not prefer to work
in england 
i do what i can
to keep things interesting 
 oleg chuckles 
but then 
there s the political situation 
this is not good time
for east and west 
well  what i like to say
is no matter what
the politicians are doing 
factories still need machines 
machines still need parts 
i m a businessman 
so i stick to business 
 oleg chuckles 
 greville  hmm 
  do you have a family 
  i do  a boy  he s ten 
i wanted a boy very much 
then we had a girl   
now she s my world 
mm  likely not destroying
your home like our son 
 both chuckle 
now    most important question 
if you want to do business
in moscow 
i need to know   
yes 
   can you hold your alcohol 
  it s my one true gift   laughs 
   laughs 
 both slurp 
i want to show you another side
of russia 
  are you free this evening 
  certainly 
where are we off to 
do you know cinderella 
embarrassed to say 
i ve never been to the ballet 
then your trip is already
worth it 
if you will  mister 
shh 
 music playing 
your tie clip  i like it 
where did you get it 
 greville 
it was a gift from a friend 
  is your friend american 
  yes

it is safe 
i sent word to your friend 
you re  um   
  i think the word is  amateur  
  yes  exactly  amateur 
i ve dreamt of this moment
for a very long time  thank you 
i wish i could tell you
how much this means 
i think i d rather
that you didn t tell me 
what happens now 
i don t need to do anything 
do i 
 oleg  no  you go home 
then you invite me
to visit london
with a trade delegation
to meet your clients 
your government would allow you 
they would be thrilled 
part of my job
is to steal technology
from the west 
your friend is clever 
well  oleg  may i call you oleg 
in english 
my name doesn t sound good 
call me alex 
alex 
you re a good amateur 
 sighs 
 greville sighs 
  let s twist again  playing 
since you took me
to the bolshoi 
i suppose i should take
all of you
to the west end 
some of the finest theater
in the world 
 alex  that would be good 
  come on let s twist again
like we did last summer   
  yeah let s twist again
like we did last year   
  an8    man speaking russian 
    do you remember when

 all singing in russian 
   greville  off you go 
   man  hello 
 greville  hello  goodbye 
 speaks russian 
 door opens 
 door closes 
 greville sighs 
 helen 
we know you re a patriot 
we know how hard
this must be for you 
colonel 
whatever brought you here   
it must frighten you more than
the danger of being here 
khrushchev 
khrushchev frightens me 
he is impulsive  chaotic 
a man like him should have
no clear command 
the west has fallen for his lie 
a lie that soviet regime
is growing soft  it is not 
khrushchev wants confrontation
with america 
he s looking for one 
do you have anything
you could share with us 
documents  perhaps 
would you like to read
the new edition
of military thought 
i need assurances from you 
if it becomes necessary   
i must able to defect
with my family 
absolutely  whenever you want 
i will remain in place   
and keep you updated
on the kremlin s thinking 
but tell your government   
they must use
my information wisely 
not as a weapon   
but as a tool to bring peace 
despite what khrushchev claims 
america s nuclear arsenal
is still far superior to ours 
we do not yet have
first strike capacity 
you can annihilate us
but we cannot annihilate you 
but that won t worry
the politburo 
do you think in the end
that ll keep khrushchev
from going too far 
you have to be up
in a few hours 
  i m fine 
  no  he s right 
we can finish this up
tomorrow night 
and one last thing   
we need to talk about greville 
don t worry  you won t have
to deal with him anymore 
  no 
  it was penkovsky s idea 
you re perfect 
you re a civilian 
so the kgb
won t be watching you 
you ll be in and out of moscow
anyway to setup contracts 
you still won t know
any specifics 
you ll just be a courier 
just a courier
for russian sea   
my god  i can t believe
you re bloody serious 
we ve gone over it
with penkovsky 
we believe the risk
to you is minimal 
and we ll pay you 
i make my own money 
thank you very much 
i have a wife and a child 
either of you have a family 
oh  no 
don t suppose you could tell me
about that 
not a lot you can tell me about 
is there  helen  james 
i can tell you we d both
put ourselves in harm s way
when necessary and this
is terribly necessary  greville 
then might i suggest you
find someone
who s suited for it 
sorry  i really have done
all i can for you 
 helen  greville  listen 
the four minute warning 
it won t do you any good 
  what 
   helen  the four minute warning
before a soviet nuclear missile
hits the uk 
no  i know what that   
what are you talking about 
that    that s what this has
all been about 
nuclear war  come on 
see  here s the problem for you 
your house is a 12 minute drive
from your office 
ten minutes if you really push 
right 
and you re usually out
on a sales call anyway 
so you re not getting back
to sheila in time 
and andrew s school 
that s nine minutes
from your house 
15 from your office 
and no one s
getting to him either 
he ll get herded
into the school basement 
i looked up the building plans 
that s a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter 
same with your basement 
actually 
only the government
has decent shelters 
what do you do 
hmm 
you can spend those four minutes
trying to get sheila
on the phone
but you won t be able
to get through 
or you can think about
how you might have helped
stop this from happening   
but you didn t 
and then  that s it 
how dare you 
truly  we ll be better off
if he doesn t do it 
he ll do it 
 doorbell rings 
 greville  no  i got it 
 sheila  all right 
   alex  hello 
  welcome  do come in 
  oh  hello 
   alex  hello 
oh  vodka  lovely 
i was just saying to greville
we didn t drink
nearly enough last night 
  thank you  uh  do come in 
   alex  thank you 
this is for andrew 
very kind  thank you 
this way 
dad told me about moscow 
what s it like in the rest
of russia 
it is very beautiful 
especially where i come from 
a lot of trees  a lot of sky 
you feel   
very alone but in a good way 
 greville  i d like to see that 
but then of course
your government
isn t all that keen
on foreigners
just wandering around 
do the russians really hate us
that much 
i think they d like our children
to be a little more polite 
andrew 
our politicians
hate your politicians 
and yours hate ours 
do not forget that 
but the people  your father
and i  we do business 
we spend time together 
i meet his family 
maybe we re only two people   
but this is how things change 
 andrew  hmm 
  what if i get caught 
  you won t 
you don t know that 
they d execute me  correct 
not if they thought you re just
a courier that you took packages
but didn t know
what was in them 
they would hold you to trade
for one of theirs 
for how long 
  a couple of years 
  oh  just a couple of years
rotting in some russian gulag 
they will not catch us 
the kgb will have no idea 
listen  i m better at this
than they are 
fine  but i m not 
 alex  look  your work   
it is only deception 
controlling your emotion 
i watched you do it in moscow 
you did it tonight 
it s really not the same thing 
if we re caught  they would
definitely execute me 
well  i m very sorry
but that s your choice 
 alex  that is how sure i am
that you can do this 
i m betting my life on it 
 greville  how can i explain
this to sheila 
 alex 
she cannot know the truth 
for her own safety  for yours 
 greville 
i can t tell her any of it 
 alex  no 
well  what have you told
your wife 
because you know what she d say 
 don t do it  
i m right  aren t i 
sheila s no fool 
and in the past  i ve   
given her reason
not to trust me dully 
then you have to lie better 
there are good lies 
sometimes a lie is gift   
an act of love 
i m sorry it has to be you 
but  greville   
it has to be you 
in moscow  you must
at all times
follow the rules of the art 
in english  there s a word 
  tradecraft 
   alex  yes 
you must follow tradecraft 
everyone you meet 
assume they are kgb 
waiters  hotel staff 
my driver  everyone 
even if they are
not actual kgb officers 
they still make reports
to kgb 
 greville  ooh 
 alex  every russian is an eye
of the state 
every room you re in 
assume it is bugged 
 james  even inside our embassy 
 alex 
especially inside your embassy 
still  our embassy will be
a good fail safe
in the event of any   
complication 
 alex 
the kgb also uses lip readers 
you won t be able to tell
who they are 
  so never discuss   
   groans 
   anything sensitive
unless i do first 
how s your family 
very well  thank you 
how s yours 
 alex  we will be seeing
each other often 
to throw off suspicion 
i will tell my colleagues
i recruited you as a source 
 james  you ll keep
colonel penkovsky supplied
with material
on steel manufacturing 
industrial production
and so on 
unclassified 
but hard to come by 
 greville  they ll believe
i would do that 
 alex  of course 
you are a greedy capitalist 
you want to keep
the contracts coming 
and from now on  every moment
you re in moscow 
you will be selling one thing 
the idea that you are
an ordinary businessman
and nothing more
than an ordinary businessman 
 greville 
well  gentlemen  i hope
this is the first of many 
thank you all very  very much 
for good health
and for business 
i should get you to the airport 
yes  yes  please 
 helen 
do you have any questions 
gentlemen   till next time 
thank you 
 greville  i want to be certain
of one thing 
i need to know
that if anything happens to me 
my wife and son
will be provided for 
 man  you have my word   
and i speak for the crown 
  an8  speaks russian 
thank you  alex  bye 
thank you 
 both moan 
 sheila breathes heavily 
  my  where did that come from 
  i missed you 
  well  just this one time 
  oh  every time  darling 
 man  they re really gearing up
for war 
this is phenomenal 
ironbark s the real thing 
well  this just became
the biggest thing
going in the whole
soviet section 
now  if i keep you on this   
am i gonna regret it 
no  sir 
 inhales  hell 
this is almost worth
all the bullshit
of dealing with the brits 
how is it with those assholes 
they re good guys 
i just have to make them think
they re in charge 
oh  this is such an honor 
i m    i m learning so much 
 chuckles 
 man over tv 
despite growing tensions
between america and the soviet 
until this morning 
there was essentially
free passage
between east and west berlin 
but overnight  without warning 
the communist authorities
have barricaded off the city 
in response 
president kennedy has vowed
to increase
america s military presence 
directly speaking
with general clay
who is stationed in berlin 
grev  would you think it s safe
to keep going to moscow 
 greville 
yes  certainly  it s fine 
 sheila  even with all this 
that s in berlin  darling 
nowhere near moscow 
 sheila 
yes  i know where berlin is
and i know the russians
and the americans   
   greville  please do let me   
     are killing any   
   run my business 
 man over tv 
today in the arctic 
the soviet union
had a successful test
of its tsar bomba
or king of bombs 
with a yield of 50 megatons 
this is by far
the most powerful
nuclear weapon ever detonated 
i have the figures
you were asking 
thank you very much 
very helpful 
 typewriter keys clacking 
 man over tv 
today  every inhabitant
  of this planet   
   woman  just down there 
   every man 
woman and child   
 man  right here  ma am 
   lives under a nuclear sword
of damocles   
hanging by the slenderest
of thread   
capable of being cut
at any moment by accident
or miscalculation
or by madness 
the weapons of war
must be abolished
before they abolish us 
 groaning 
 greville 
do you have anything for me 
 alex  tomorrow 
 vomits  coughs 
 pants 
 sniffles  pants 
 typewriters key clacking 
  andrew 
  yeah 
where are the raincoats 
oh  right 
sorry

the forecast is a sun 
no  it s not fine 
what if the forecast is wrong 
what if it rains 
well  we ll want to stay
in the tent anyway 
we can read books 
it ll be lovely 
it s not the point 
the point is 
i told you to pack
the raincoats 
i made myself perfectly clear 
so why didn t you do it 
greville  are you certain
this is how you want
  to start our holiday 
  answer me 
 andrew  i   
i   
forgot 
you forgot  you know 
that s fantastic 
i ve got a son who s too dumb
to remember something   
  greville  greville  greville 
     as simple as packing the   
your father didn t mean that 
shall we start again  hmm 
is he all right 
 sighs 
he s asleep  it s a good sign 
here 
  will you be all right 
  oh  fine   mumbles 
i really needed this holiday
and it s a good idea 
glad we came here 
it s not just tonight 
you ve been so different lately 
greville  what s going on 
look  i didn t want to tell you
before because i   
i didn t want you
to be involved 
it s the business 
yeah  we ve   
hit a bit of a rough patch 
 woman 
that makes sense  doesn t it 
men and money 
my god  colin went almost mad
last year
when his job
looked the tiniest bit shaky 
 sighs 
i wish it made sense
but it s not just that 
it s everything 
he s exercising all the time
and he s become so   
  energetic in bed 
  that all sounds so awful 
 laughs  poor you   chuckles 
i m so sorry  i shouldn t joke 
 clears throat 
i know greville had
an indiscretion once before but
it doesn t mean
he s having an affair now 
then why is he so secretive
with me 
and defensive 
and it s always worse
whenever he comes home
from moscow 
that s when it all started 
moscow 
 clicks tongue  oh 
 sheila  might be better
if you didn t have to travel
so much   
better for our family 
 greville  darling  i told you 
it s very important 
  we need the money 
   sheila  the money 
   greville  money  yes 
  i thought you needed the club 
and you haven t caught
any expenses
and now we re going
to a smart restaurant 
really  not quite certain 
how i m supposed
to respond to that 
i mean  why can t we live
the good life  it s why i work 
greville  i m asking you to stop
going to moscow 
i m asking you as your wife 
oh  i know what you re thinking 
  there is no one else  i swear 
  i forgave you once 
i never said i would again 
hello  nina 
very nice to meet you 
she s never seen
a foreigner before 
 indistinct 
 vera speaks russian 
my wife apologizes 
we cannot invite you for dinner 
to bring a foreigner
into one s home  it is not done 
it s all right  i d understand 
 sighs 
you have a lovely family 
thank you 
 greville  alex   
when do you think
you ll be ready to defect 
 alex  it is best if we
do not talk about that 
is something the matter 
just a bit of trouble at home 
 sighs 
one day  you will be able
to tell sheila
what you have done
and she ll be very proud of you 
that might be a bit too late 
sometimes vera 
she also struggles with my work 
yes  but your wife married

a source 
  an8  man speaking russian 
  an8  khrushchev speaks russian 
 man  i    i just don t see it
for them to actually do that
to try and sneak nukes
into our backyard 
  i mean  it would be   
  it ll be like an act of war 
even khrushchev
isn t that crazy 
all i can tell you
is that ironbark

if he or she were an idiot 
i hope we take this seriously

 man  ironbark gave us
camouflage profiles
for different kinds
of missile installations
so we could tell  em apart 
as soon as we get some
u 2 photos
we ll know if cuba s got nukes
or not 
and whether russian missiles
can reach mainland us
for the first time 
can they get a u 2 in the air 
this time of year there s just
too much cloud cover 
 til october you re all i got 
mm hmm 
when i went back to my hotel
they searched my room 
but they didn t find anything 
obviously he wouldn t be here
if they had 
i m saying he s still
in the clear 
it could just have been
a routine check which he passed 
that s it greville 
we re pulling you out 
 greville 
but what about penkovsky 
i didn t have a chance
to warn him 
we ll have to find another way
to communicate with him 
but you don t need to worry
about that 
no  you don t understand 
that s why he s in danger
as well 
if the kgb have been looking
at me 
they ll be looking at him too 
he s still set to come here
for the trade fair next month 
  doesn t he 
   greville  yes 
 james  then he s all right 
if he was under suspicion
they d never let him
leave the country 
 indistinct chatter 
but you will still help him
to defect  won t you 
whatever he likes  he s more
than earned his retirement
and greville so have you 
outstanding work 
oh  my god 
so    so  that s it 
cuba  what about cuba 
do try not to worry
about any of this anymore 
put it all out of your head 
best you can 
 inhales deeply  understood 
well  thank you 
what the hell are you doing 
we re shutting down wynne  now 
please recall 
wynne is a british national 
any fallout from his capture
would cause
a major embarrassment
for the government 
we have to know
what penkovsky knows about cuba 
which at the moment is nothing 
he ll be here next month 
we ll debrief him them 
that s all

this government  as promised 
has maintained   
the closest surveillance
of the soviet military build up
on the island of cuba 
within the past week
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact
that a series of offensive
missiles sites
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island 
the purpose of these bases
can be none other
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability
against the western hemisphere 
it shall be the policy
of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile
launched from cuba
against any nation
in the western hemisphere
as an attack
by the soviet union
on the united states 
requiring a full
retaliatory response
upon the soviet union 
i call upon chairman khrushchev
to halt and eliminate
this clandestine

  telegram 
  thank you 
 greville 
it s time  it s got to be 
   james  time for what 
   greville  time to get him out 
 james 
greville  we can t get him out 
 greville  of course you can 
well then 
what did you mean when you said
you were gonna help him
to defect 
 james  family holiday
to east germany 
crossover in berlin 
to try and smuggle them
right out of moscow 
  i wouldn t dream of it 
   greville  but you re mi6
and cia 
i can t get anywhere near
penkovsky now 
so there s no way to coordinate
with him or plan it out 
we d have to kidnap him
and his family off the street 
 helen  it d be a disaster 
 greville  and if they
won t let them leave  then what 
 james  it was my idea
to bring you into all this 
i never should have done that
to you  i m sorry 
well then  that s it 
we re just going to abandon him
and let the kgb murder him
whenever they get round to it 
this is a hard truth 
but if things were
the other way around 
  penkovsky would abandon you 
  no  no  he would not 
he s a professional 
we use people 
he would do
just what i m doing now 
move on  go home 
go home to your family 
you re wrong 
what 
you re the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that 
but not penkovsky 
you ve met him once  i know him 
he would never leave me to die 
and i m not leaving him 
 james  i m afraid
it s not your decision 
you said the problem was 
there s no way to coordinate
to let penkovsky know about
the escape plan
but there is a way 
me 
i can tell him   
if i go back to moscow 
  you would do that 
  yes 
 james  no  he wouldn t 
because he hasn t entirely
lost his mind 
james  be a bloody professional 
i m volunteering to bring back
the best source
of soviet intelligence
you got at a time
where russia and america
are on the brink of nuclear war 
you talk about using people 
for god s sake use me 
if you go back to moscow 
i ll go with you 
at no risk to herself 
she ll have diplomatic immunity 
  she thinks you re a fool 
   helen  i will do everything
in my power to get both of you
  out of there 
   james  but i am telling you 
don t do it 
 door opens

 helen  thank you 
you were right 
you were right  too 
we had to try 
mrs  wynne  i m james dobie
with the board of trade 
  may we come in 
  yes  please 
  oh  my god 
   james  it s absurd  of course 
the foreign office is hard
at work sorting this out 
  but it s a delicate situation 
  why 
oleg penkovsky has been arrested
as well  which is quite serious 
the russians are claiming
greville was caught up
in some sort of   
well  espionage 
the foreign office will be
in touch soon 
and while
this is all being resolved 
the crown will provide
for you and your son 
  it s true  isn t it 
  what s true 
greville was working
with penkovsky like they say 
 james  no  no  of course not 
can i call greville 
i need to speak to him 
  i don t think that s   
  no  i have to    i have to   
i have to tell him that
i m sorry 
 breathing heavily 
i thought he was   
  my god  i ve been so stupid 
   door opens 
   andrew  mommy 
  andrew  go to your room 
   andrew  who are   
  andrew  go to your room 
 james 
i m a friend of your father s 
he told me you have
quite the trophy collection 
could you show me 
andrew please  it s all right 
 door closes 
don t tell me it s not true 
i know my husband 
i know he s been acting 
don t tell me it s not true 
there are things
i can t say to you 
i can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man 
and he needs you now 
he needs your help  mrs  wynne 
you see  once the russians
realize greville is innocent 
your government will be able
to get him home safe 
in time 
but if the russians do decide   
that greville actually
is some kind of spy   
i m so sorry 
 scoffs 
 helen 
so when you talk to anybody   
that means your family   
your friends  andrew 
and especially the press   
you have to tell them
that none of this
could possibly be true 
and you have to be
very convincing 
can you do that 
can you do that for greville 
i can t imagine what penkovsky
could ve confessed to 
i    i m sorry 
i don t know what this is 
we know everything 
we know that penkovsky gave you
packages to take to the west 
  well  yes  a few times 
  then you admit it 
admit what  i didn t know
that i was doing anything wrong 
you think stealing
soviet intelligence
wasn t wrong 
 greville  if that is what
was happening  i didn t know it 
i never asked him
what was in the packages 
i didn t think
it was my business 
who did you give these
packages to 
 greville 
well  i dropped them off
in various addresses
around london 
i never thought anything of it 
mr  wynne   
you were asking me to believe
that you are very  very stupid 
 greville  oh  well  yes 
i suppose in your world i am 
but  look  i m just a salesman 
i want my clients to like me 
so if that meant doing   
a favor for penkovsky
every now and then 
i really didn t see the harm 
 exhales 
 groans 
hi 
  ah  that is so sweet of you 
   chuckles 
oh  but i wish i could
invite you in  i m just   
i m in the middle of 20 things 
oh  no  no  that s fine 
i m so glad to see you re well 
it s been ages 
we ve all been worried 
yes  well  do say hello for me 
of course  i saw that ridiculous
piece in the mail 
it s so absurd 
you don t think there could be
any truth to it  do you 
what they re saying
about greville 
don t be ridiculous 
how could greville ever spy
on soviets 
he couldn t even hide
his affair for me 
  right 
  thank you again for dropping by
  and this was so sweet of you 
  oh 
we should have tea 
  i ll be in touch  thank you 
  yes 
oh  all right  bye 
 clears throat

 oleg  for years the americans

oh  but how dare
we put missiles in cuba   
is that fair 
  i don t know 
  mm 
do you realize your country
has left you here to die 
no  sir 
i don t believe that s true 
 indistinct 
why 
why 
why  for god sake 
what have i done   banging 
i didn t do anything 
i didn t do it  you   
you fucking animals

 officer 
you will not touch  sit down 
sit down 
oh  my god  darling 
i know i ve been ill 
but i m on the mend now   
and this will help 
this will help 
  very much 
  what are they doing 
what the hell are you people
doing to him 
 greville  it s not like that 
they ve been quite respectful
given the circumstance 
you mustn t fault them 
really  you mustn t 
what you re going through   
it s all so unfair 
i m sorry for what happened 
i feel wretched
for doubting you 
no  no  couldn t be helped 
i m really so glad you re here 
i missed you both   
very much 
the foreign office said 
that s a very good sign
i m being allowed to visit you 
  hmm 
   sheila  they said it might   
it might still take a while yet
to get you home
since the russians backed down
in cuba
they re being very stubborn
right now 
what happened in cuba 
well  they removed the missiles 
it s    it s all fine now 
no more about this 
 sheila 
and we re trying very hard 
it might take another   
it might take another year   
or two 
tell me something about home 
tell me what i have
to look forward to 
well  the garden s cooperating
a bit 
finally   chuckles 
and we have tomatoes this year 
and andrew  he   
he passed his maths exam
  somehow   chuckles 
   chuckles 
you d be proud 
how are you 
i m   
i m all right 
really 
if you can be strong enough
for this   
when you come home   
i hope we can start again 
and i was very foolish 
i m sorry 
but i just want you to know that
every moment i ve been here 
i have done nothing
but think about
how i m going to get home
to you 
really 
i will 
i will   snivels 
 man  it s a matter of who 
we can t send someone
of real value 
not for wynne 
wynne wasn t valuable 
we re all alive  aren t we 
he s not an officer 
is the point 
if we propose an officer
of theirs that sends a message
about how we perceive wynne
the wrong message 
if you let wynne die over there 
and he will die 
a lot sooner than you think 
no one will ever trust mi6
to protect them 
ever again 
 james sighs 
you feel guilty 
i know 
but you were doing your job
and wynne
is our countryman  emily 
i promise   
we ll get him home 
 oleg  if you think penkovsky
will protect you   
you think too highly of him 
he betrayed his country   
his family   
why not you 
it is every man for himself 
yes 
hi 
i have not seen a mirror
for a long time 
i like to think
i m still quite worth   
for the time 
i wasn t sure
i d ever see you again 
i m so sorry
you re here greville 
i hope you can forgive me
for this   
and for what i had to do 
what you mean 
what you had to do 
i held back   
for as long as i could 
i have to protect
my family  greville 
to save them  i had to tell
the kgb the truth 
all of the truth 
i told them   
i gave you pictures that   
helped americans
find missiles in cuba 
and of course i told them   
you didn t know what was
in the packages i gave you 
greville   
i thought i could make
the world a safer place   
but i failed 
all this   
betraying my country 
my people  all for nothing 
alex   
of course i forgive you 
i have to look
after my family  too 
easier now i know
there s not gonna be
a nuclear war   
because khrushchev
withdrew his missiles   
   cell door opens 
     because of you 
because of you 
you 
you did it  alex  you did it 
you  you did it 
because of you  alex 
you did it 
 indistinct chatter

maybe we re only two people   
but this is how things change 
 andrew  daddy  where are you 
 man  mr  wynne  you ve just
spoken to your wife 
what were your first words
to her
and what were her first
words to you 
frankly 
we re both rather speechless 
there were no words
for a moment 
 man  do you have any idea
of what you re going to do
in the future 
oh  i want to get back
to my normal business activities
as soon as i possibly can
