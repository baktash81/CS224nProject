by greeting card companies   
 man on p a  continues 
last call

 joel continues 
it s goddamn freezing on this beach 
montauk in february 
brilliant  joel 
page is ripped out 
don t remember doing that 
it appears this is
my fixirst entry in two years 
sand is overrated 
it s just tiny little rocks 
if only i could
meet someone new 
i guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished 
seeing that i m incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman i don t know 
maybe i should
get back together with naomi 
she was nice 
nice is good 
she loved me 
 woman speaking  faint 
 chuckles softly 
 joel continues 
why do i fall in love
with every woman i see   
who shows me
the least bit of attention 
 train horn blows

i like it 
yeah 
anyway  this company
makes a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names

coming up with those names

possibly be a job like that

i m sorry  doctor 
he just barged right in here

to come inside 
and  mary  if you could take care of mrs  woo 
good bye  mrs  woo 
yes  of course 
now  the  uh   
the first thing
we need you to do  mr  barish 
is to go home   
and collect everything you own
that has some association with clementine 
anything 
and we ll use these items to create
a map of clementine in your brain 
okay 
so we ll need  uh 
uh  photos  clothing  gifts 
books she may have bought you 
cds you may have bought together 
journal entries 
we want to empty your home   
we want to empty your life
of clementine 
and after the mapping is done 
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight 
that way  when you awake
in the morning 
you ll fixind yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened   
a new life awaiting you 
 tires screech 
 driver 
wake up  buddy 
 mary 
no  i m sorry  mrs  sobel 
you can t have the procedure done
three times in one month 
well  it s just not our policy   
how are you today  mr  barish 
hello  i m right here 
i know it s an emergency 
and we ll do everything we can   
we can fit you in on the first of march 
maybe you could talk to the doctor 
a  and he   
all right  so let s make an appointment 
what day would you like
to come in this week 
mr  barish 
um  he s really busy
this afternoon 
maybe tomorrow would be better 
around 12 15  can you do that 
february is very busy for us
because of valentine s day 
 chuckles 
 knocks 
 dixieland jazz 
this is  uh  stan fink 
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians 
 continues 
he ll be handling
your case tonight 
great to meet you 
mr  barish 
my name is joel barish 
and i m here to erase
clementine kruczynski 
very good 
now  tell me about  uh  clementine 
uh  i was   
living with this woman  naomi 
uh  a couple years ago 
and my friends rob and carrie
invited us to this party at the beach   
i don t like parties 
naomi couldn t go  but i went   
and i  uh  met clementine 
 pencils clattering on floor 
i m sorry 
let s start with
your most recent memories   
and work backwards from there 
more or less 
there s an emotional core   
to each of our memories 
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process 
by the time you wake up
in the morning 
all the memories we ve targeted
will have withered and disappeared 
as in a dream upon waking 
is there any risk
of brain damage 
well  uh  technically speaking 
the procedure is brain damage 
but it s on a par with
a night of heavy drinking 
nothing you ll miss 
comfortable 
what we re doing here  mr  barish 
is actually creating a map of your brain 
 mierzwiak 
okay  let s get started 
if we want to get
this procedure underway tonight 
we have some work to do 
i want you to react
to these objects  mr  barish 
if you will 
 clementine whooping  laughing 
there s a good story
behind this one   
uh  actually  mr  barish 
i ll get a much better
emotional readout   
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items 
just try to focus on the memories 
oh  sorry  okay 
 stan 
healthy activity up there again 
healthy readouts  very good 
  here s another object 
   clementine s voice 
that s so   
next item  okay 
potato head 
 chuckles 
  next item  okay 
   electronic crackling 
 stan  voice electronically processed 
just focus on the memories 
patrick  do me a favor 
 stan  hey  patrick 
do me a favor  will ya 
 patrick  yeah 
 stan 
can you check the voltage regulator 
what do we got there 
uh  voltage looks fine 
really 
well  i m not wiping
as clean as i like here 
i m     scoffs 
 mierzwiak s voice  distant 
well  uh  technically the procedure
is brain damage 
check the  uh   
check the connections  please 
oh  there you are 
i   
why am i   
i don t understand
what i m looking at 
why am i
standing here and   
oh  my god 
déjà vu 
déjà vu 
this is so   
all right  we should get started 
if we re gonna get the procedure   
 simultaneously 
underway tonight 
we have some work to do 
 whispering 
i m in my head already 
aren t i 
i suppose so 
uh  this is about right 
this is what it   
this is what it would look like 
very good 
 simultaneously 
we ll dispose of these mementos
when we re done here 
that way you won t be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home 
 stan 
ah  there we go 
patrick 
yeah 
 stan s voice  echoing 
patrick  can you check   
patrick 
i m getting some sort of readout
of my own voice 
patrick  patrick

   stan  are you sure
you set that thing up properly 
 patrick  how s that 
 mary  how are you today

there we are 
mr  barish 
 stan s voice  that s better 
  i don t know if i like this 
  think i might try this  then

 stan s voice  electronically accelerated

and even hate  eventually 
at the time i thought 
 how cool  an orange sweatshirt

who doesn t know how to interact
at these things either  
yeah

of your chicken 
and then you just took it

 chuckles 
i i had a really nice time
last night 
nice 
i had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life   
last night 
that s better 
this is weird 
 mary s voice  to all patients
of dr  howard mierzwiak 
my name is mary svevo 
 we ve met 
but you don t remember me 
 mary s voice overlapping 
i worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased  
i have since decided
that this is a horrible   
some kind of teaser ad or something 
 mary 
in order to correct this 
i m sending everyone s fixile back to them 
 on tape 
my name is clementine kruczynski 
i m here to erase joel barish 
what is this 
i don t know 
he s boring 
is that enough reason
to erase someone 
i ve been thinking lately
how i was before and how i am now 
and it s like he changed me 
i feel like i m always pissy now 
i don t like myself when i m with him 
i don t like myself anymore 
i can t stand to even look at him 
that pathetic  wimpy  apologetic smile 
  that sort of wounded puppy shit
he does  you know 
  what are you doing 
i m not doing anything 
the bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point 
  are you screwing with me 
  no 
  you are screwing with me 
  joel  i m not 
  you clearly are 
  look  let s just take a minute and   
 exasperated sigh 
 door closes 
 panting 
patrick  get the fuck away 
oh  sweetheart   
get the fuck away from me 
can we talk about it 
no  get the fuck away 
 sobbing 
 sets brake 
joel barish 
hey  clementine 
hey 
nice to see you  yeah 
yeah 
 joel on tape 
really very educated 
i mean  she s smart  i think 
but not educated 
i couldn t really talk to her
about books  you know 
she s more of
a magazine reading girl 
her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired 
sometimes   
i was embarrassed in public   
hi 
because she would pronounce   
library  libary  
hi 
libary  libary 
look what i found 
 on tape  i think if there s
a truly seductive quality
about clementine 
it s that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane 
you made me look skinny 
amazing  burning meteorite   
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting 
but what you quickly learn
is that   
it s really an elaborate ruse 
i m sorry i yelled at you 
it s okay 
so flashy
in a kind of obvious way 
but still  it seduces you 
joel  i really like you 
i hate that i said
mean things about you 
  let me turn this off  okay 
  hey  it s    it s only fair 
where s the real clementine 
i mean  the whole thing with the hair   
it s all bullshit 
  i really like your hair 
  thank you 
i really like your hair 
thank you 
i do 
the world s a goddamn mess 
is it some kind of a revolt 
change your hair color 
you want a drink or something 
do you have any whiskey 
no  i don t think her sex
is    motivated 
i saw it clearly
the last night we were together 
it wasn t sex 
it was just sad 
hey  sorry 
i thought there was more 
the only way clem thinks
she can get people to like her   
is to fuck  em   
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of em 
and she s so desperate
and insecure   
that she ll  sooner or later 
go around fucking everybody 
i don t do that 
i wouldn t think that
about you 
  because i don t 
  i know 
because it really hurts me
that you said that
because i don t do that 
i m so sorry 
i m sorry about all this 
i m gonna    go 
i m a little confused 
i don t really think i can be here 
um    bye 
bye 
 on tape 
i thought i knew her so well 
it was nice meeting you and all 
but i don t know her at all 
what a loss to spend
that much time with someone 
only to fixind out
that she s a stranger 
wait 
what 
i don t know 
just wait  just wait 
what do you want  joel 
i don t know 
i want you to wait for   
just a while 
 quiet sob 
okay 
really 
i m not a concept  joel 
i m just a fucked up girl who s looking
for my own peace of mind 
  i m not perfect 
  i can t see anything
that i don t like about you 
right now i can t 
but you will 
but you will 
you know  you will think of things 
and i ll get bored with you
and feel trapped   
because that s what happens
with me 
okay 
okay 
 crying 
okay 
okay 
 laughing

it will astound you
now  i need your lovin 
like the sunshine
