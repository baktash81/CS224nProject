joel continues

it appears this is
my fixirst entry in two years
sand is overrated
its just tiny little rocks
if only i could
meet someone new
i guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished
seeing that im incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman i dont know
maybe i should
get back together with naomi
she was nice
nice is good
she loved me
woman speaking faint
chuckles softly
joel continues
why do i fall in love
with every woman i see
who shows me
the least bit of attention

mr barish if youd like to uh
to come inside
and mary if you could take care of mrs woo
goodbye mrs woo
yes of course
now the uh
the first thing
we need you to do mr barish
is to go home
and collect everything you own
that has some association with clementine
anything
and well use these items to create
a map of clementine in your brain
okay
so well need uh
uh photos clothing gifts
books she may have bought you
cds you may have bought together
journal entries
we want to empty your home
we want to empty your life
of clementine
and after the mapping is done
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight
that way when you awake
in the morning
youll fixind yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened
a new life awaiting you
tires screech
driver
wake up buddy
mary
no im sorry mrs sobel
you cant have the procedure done
three times in one month
well its just not our policy
how are you today mr barish

we can fit you in on the first of march
maybe you could talk to the doctor
a and he
all right so lets make an appointment

dixieland jazz
this is uh stan fink
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians
continues
hell be handling
your case tonight
great to meet you
mr barish
my name is joel barish
and im here to erase
clementine kruczynski
very good
now tell me about uh clementine
uh i was
living with this woman naomi
uh a couple years ago
and my friends rob and carrie
invited us to this party at the beach
i dont like parties
naomi couldnt go but i went
and i uh met clementine
pencils clattering on floor
im sorry
lets start with
your most recent memories
and work backwards from there
more or less
theres an emotional core
to each of our memories
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process
by the time you wake up
in the morning
all the memories weve targeted
will have withered and disappeared
as in a dream upon waking
is there any risk
of brain damage
well uh technically speaking
the procedure is brain damage
but its on a par with
a night of heavy drinking
nothing youll miss
comfortable
what were doing here mr barish
is actually creating a map of your brain
mierzwiak
okay lets get started
if we want to get
this procedure underway tonight
we have some work to do
i want you to react
to these objects mr barish
if you will
clementine whooping laughing
theres a good story
behind this one
uh actually mr barish
ill get a much better
emotional readout
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items
just try to focus on the memories
oh sorry okay
stan
healthy activity up there again
healthy readouts very good
heres another object
clementines voice
thats so
next item okay
potato head
chuckles

marys voice to all patients
of dr howard mierzwiak
my name is mary svevo
weve met
but you dont remember me
marys voice overlapping
i worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased
i have since decided
that this is a horrible
some kind of teaser ad or something
mary
in order to correct this
im sending everyones fixile back to them
on tape
my name is clementine kruczynski
im here to erase joel barish
what is this
i dont know
hes boring
is that enough reason
to erase someone
ive been thinking lately
how i was before and how i am now
and its like he changed me
i feel like im always pissy now
i dont like myself when im with him
i dont like myself anymore
i cant stand to even look at him
that pathetic wimpy apologetic smile
that sort of wounded puppy shit
he does you know
what are you doing
im not doing anything
the bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point
are you screwing with me
no
you are screwing with me
joel im not
you clearly are
look lets just take a minute and
exasperated sigh
door closes
panting
patrick get the fuck away
oh sweetheart
get the fuck away from me

no get the fuck away
sobbing
sets brake
joel barish
hey clementine
hey
nice to see you yeah
yeah
joel on tape
really very educated
i mean shes smart i think
but not educated
i couldnt really talk to her
about books you know
shes more of
a magazinereading girl
her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired
sometimes
i was embarrassed in public
hi
because she would pronounce
library libary
hi
libary libary
look what i found
on tape i think if theres
a truly seductive quality
about clementine
its that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane
you made me look skinny
amazing burning meteorite
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting
but what you quickly learn
is that
its really an elaborate ruse
im sorry i yelled at you
its okay
so flashy
in a kind of obvious way
but still it seduces you
joel i really like you
i hate that i said
mean things about you
let me turn this off okay
hey its its only fair
wheres the real clementine
i mean the whole thing with the hair
its all bullshit
i really like your hair
thank you
i really like your hair
thank you
i do
the worlds a goddamn mess
is it some kind of a revolt
change your hair color
you want a drink or something
do you have any whiskey
no i dont think her sex
is motivated
i saw it clearly
the last night we were together
it wasnt sex
it was just sad
hey sorry
i thought there was more
the only way clem thinks
she can get people to like her
is to fuck em
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front ofem
and shes so desperate
and insecure
that shell sooner or later
go around fucking everybody
i dont do that
i wouldnt think that
about you
because i dont
i know
because it really hurts me
that you said that
because i dont do that
im so sorry
im sorry about all this
im gonna go
im a little confused
i dont really think i can be here
um bye
bye
on tape
i thought i knew her so well
it was nice meeting you and all
but i dont know her at all
what a loss to spend
that much time with someone
only to fixind out
that shes a stranger
wait
what
i dont know
just wait just wait
what do you want joel
i dont know
i want you to wait for
just a while
quiet sob
okay
really
im not a concept joel
im just a fuckedup girl whos looking
for my own peace of mind
im not perfect
i cant see anything
that i dont like about you
right now i cant
but you will
but you will
you know you will think of things
and ill get bored with you
and feel trapped
because thats what happens
with me
