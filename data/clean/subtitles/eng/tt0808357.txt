this is a play on words
a phrase used in mahjong
speaking of moving i
forgot to congratulate you
on mr liangs promotion
can you even call that a promotion
he only supervises the rations
you cant even get rice from india now
those in charge of rice are more powerful
than those who guard the treasury
mrs yee is right
me im not a living buddha
but you should listen to me
if he takes a consignment
he wont be home for 3 days
youll be free then
i dont have the time
his relatives are always coming around
they pack the place even the corridors
ill take that mahjong terminology
i still have to settle their meals
its not even as though
im getting paid for this
yeah
dont mislead mrs mak
into thinking government officials
are the tiles were playing with now
isnt that so
the japanese would
never have thought that
even the emperor gets henpecked
eat while its hot
i cant eat any more im getting fat
everyone hoards up stuff now
since we cant do anything
else just hoard up fat then
what else is good to
stock up on mrs yee
you know my husband is
in the import business
ill take that mahjong terminology
even though hong kong has fallen
the ships still need to call
ill eat that mahjong terminology
western medicine
the last shipment sold out very quickly
he should get more of them
i heard you went to shu yu yesterday
yes with some others mrs
mak hasnt been there before
its embarrassing that i havent
therere two new branches in hong kong
the sichuan and hong kong
chefs couldnt get along
and besides hong kongers
cant take spicy food
isnt it spicy
yes it really was
9 wan mahjong terminology
2 wan
ill take that
mrs mak didnt go yesterday
she hasnt come for a few days
i had things to take care at home
since you had enough players
i decided to take a break
an excuse to hide eh
who was it who said she wasnt
free a few days ago over the phone
that day doesnt count
i went to fetch mrs mak
you can ask her if you dont believe me
i specially chose to treat you
to a meal that day mrs mak
she did it deliberately
ill take that tile
do you still have more
of those stockings
yes but i gave them all away
if you want i can bring
more the next time
ok
goods are running scarce in shanghai
theres even a black market
for soap and toothpaste
you should come more often
theres a place for you to stay
i think hes had enough
the kempeitai japanese military police
will demand for him
they didnt specify whether
he should be dead or alive
just give it to him
how will you account to miura
theyre investigating the arms the
americans supplied to chong qing
ill meet him tonight
his secretary called to say
todays dinner was cancelled
he wants you to report directly
to headquarters tomorrow

how many carats is yours three carats

thinking of getting it changed
pin fen has new stock
theres a new five carat one
its large but not as bright as yours
why didnt you call me then
i only took a brief glance
pin fen has some stuff that
cant be gotten outside
they wouldnt sell that fire gem to me
shanghainese term for a highgrade jewel
how much is it worth now
that fire gem of yours is ten carats
its not as though its a pigeons egg
gems are just stones
if you wear such large jewellery
you cant even play mahjong
nagging at me even though
you wouldnt buy it for me
ah i won
combo win mahjong terminology
i was about to win myself
its all mr yees fault
for saying you cant play
mahjong if you wear jewellery
he did it on purpose

ok
hey lai shu jin
i was just looking for you
kuang yumin you still remember me
yes i saw you acting
lingnan universitys
womens drama society
weve set up a new drama society
were auditioning for members today
but the womens drama society has never
collaborated with males
since were borrowing hong kong
universitys premises for classes
and we have a lack of manpower
we should work together
we can do ibsens the doll house
i know noras lines
at the back of my hand
at this kind of time who has the mood
to see this kind of bourgeoise show
were intending to
stage a patriotic play
to raise funds for the war
you should come for the
audition tomorrow too
but im only a freshman
ive never acted before
it doesnt matter
everyone should play their part
for the resistance movement
while the soldiers are
fighting on the frontlines
the hong kongers are relaxing
we need to awaken them
from their complacency
what a typical director
he doesnt listen to anyone
but since its the resistance
we girls cant lose out to the guys
i just cant stand the thought
of following his beck and call
hes quite passionate isnt he
not long after his brother
graduated from the military academy
he got killed in the war
so his family wouldnt
let him join the army
so thats why hes so agitated
i dont want him to get drafted either
i return myself to the
land which nurtured me
and my soul
more to the left more
ok thats fine
lets try it out
whats up
my dad got married
im writing a letter
to congratulate him
the prestage jitters will
disappear once the curtains open
auntie zhao
they found this officer
behind the hills
xiao hong has your brother come home
shh come in quickly
my son quickly go boil some water
what happened to you
hes an army officer not your son
my son is coming home tonight
coming home to eat dinner
i should slaughter a chicken for him
my son is coming back
hes coming back today
my son is coming back
my son is coming back
ever since she knew my
brother died on the warfront
my mum took ill
i made this for my brother
i just finished knitting it
but hell never get to wear it
please have it
i cant you saved my life
i dont have anything to repay you with
saving our country is payment enough
killing the enemy is taking
revenge for my brother
i hate myself for being a woman
and i promised my brother
to take care of mum
i want to set his mind at rest
your brother
he was the same age as you
ever since my dad died
hed been taking care of the family
hed work faster than everyone else
every year during the harvest
hed help others after
harvesting our own crops
he was also as rugged as you
id always follow him wherever he went
hed always say heaven would
bless the honest and kind
our family had our hopes pinned on him
ill kowtow to you
for this country
for my dead brother
for the generations of people
china cannot fall
china cannot fall

that was really great
everyone was shouting out
china cannot fall
china cannot fall
600 600 people seated in the audience
and those standing in the aisle too
dont underestimate
these hong kongers eh
when we performed at lingnan
we never had such an
enthusiastic response
what we staged is the reality
the audience can emphasise
so naturally theyre touched
during the fundraising
i saw many people tearing
cheers to everyone for
raising this sum of money
and doing our bit for the war
we must drink to our
hearts content tonight
lets worry about the nation tomorrow

careful
cheers to our leading man and lady
our ticket sales depend on her
to our leading man and lady

wong chia chi
come up
i met a fellow villager
from my hometown
called tsao de xi
he went to the same school as my brother
so were familiar with each other
i heard hes an assistant
officer working for the guy
in charge of the peaceful exercise
his name is yee
hes wang jingweis aide in
charge of espionage and spying
hes now in hong kong
wang jingweis runs the
peaceful exercise but
hes just a lackey of the japanese
hes a traitor who betrayed our country
wang is now accumulating troops
hong kong is under yees purview
this tsao guy i met
this is a chance
what chance
this isnt theatre
no matter how much we trade on our
audiences tears and shout our voices hoarse
its incomparable to
killing a real traitor
we can do it this holidays
so the school wont find out
we need to disguise ourselves
and think of a way to
infiltrate the yee household
ill get a favour from old tsao
and get him to introduce us
and then well get guns
but which of us knows
how to kill a person
weve only killed people on stage
when you see a traitor
in front of your eyes
youll know that killing
isnt difficult at all
its only a matter
of how many how fast
this is a matter of life and death i
want everyone to consider it carefully
if youre in then lets
make this a big one
knives together lets
not waste our youth
and slay one of
wang jingweis lackeys
im in
count me in
then well too
i dont want to force anyone
im in too
lil un i didnt expect
youd come find me
we havent met since
we left our hometown
less talk cheers
drink up
i should also thank brother tsao
from now on you must
take care of us
sure sure sure
heres one to you
brother can you see
if you can help us
can you help us find work
its tough but let
me think of something
wheres liang junsheng
hes still up there
whats he doing
we only have enough for tsao
maybe he can get more information
just on those few glasses of cats piss
the caucasians have all gone on holiday
we can use the second
floor for two months
whered you get the money from
my dad left me some money
in hong kong
in case of emergencies
i didnt ask you to get
something so luxurious
if you want auyang to
be mr mak a businessman
and wong chia chi to be
mrs mak a rich housewife
this is the kind of
place they should live in
lets decorate this place
and get some furniture
and get a maid
does mr mak need a moustache
hold on
dont use my best tie
to wipe your mouth with
this isnt a rehearsal there
wont be a second chance
remember your own roles
dont say what youre
not supposed to say
you too
theyre here
mr mak mrs mak
this is mr maks cousin a friend
from my hometown kuang yumin
this is mr yee and mrs yee
you accompany them
ill take my leave first
sorry about making you drive
all the way here to get me
old tsao said you were
familiar with hong kong
if wed not have used
my husbands car
its no problem
its along the way
mrs yee do you want
to visit chung wan
though weve been in hong kong
for a few months already
the only places we know are
chung wan and repulse bay
how about tsim sha tsui then
we can take a stroll there too
sure
to tsim sha tsui queens harbour
can you drop us off before
you return to the office
it wont matter if we
make a slight detour right
i wouldnt want to inconvenience
mr maks official business
its a family business its all right
what line are you in mr mak
export trading
we also do importing
mrs yee where you live is pretty good
when we were looking for
a house did we look here
its just a rental once war
broke out on the mainland
we moved here hastily
mrs mak were you born here
i married here my mums
hometown is in guangzhou
my mum is from shanghai
then your shanghainese must be good
i can speak but not well
ive forgotten it all
they are speaking in shanghainese
my hometown is anhui
my shanghainese isnt too good either
thanks sorry for bothering you
and helping me carry my stuff
no i should
youre welcome since
hes my husbands cousin
he also just arrived in hong kong
we brought him along to see the sights
what do you do in guangzhou
i teach in an elementary
school in the village
as expected you have a scholarly air
either a college student or a teacher
mrs yee you have a good eye
didnt you see those
plainclothes bodyguards
theres no way we can make a
move on him at his own place
whenever he goes out therere at least a few
bodyguards by his side in addition to the chaffeur
even if we get him out therere at least
three people well have to deal with
we need at least two guns
but its still better
than attacking him at home
be more patient were already on track
mrs yee has a good
impression of wong chia chi
shes already arranged a second meeting
sorry im tired
can i come in
come in
i pressed the tailor to hurry
thank you
what does yee look like
i only got a glimpse he
wasnt what i expected
our cook he just left like that
he didnt take anything
but the man just disappeared
so we moved to the ban dao hotel
its already five days and
we dont dare to go back
my husband says it isnt safe so we
need to find somewhere else to stay
you cant trust the people here
these cantonese i cant catch
a word of what theyre saying
exactly im quite irritated
where can i find a cook
who can whip up some decent
shanghainese dishes now
i know theres a place
in hong kong
which serves
decent shanghainese food
they have good fried shallot
carp and drunken chicken
then bring us there
hey old yee mrs mak just said
theres a good shanghainese
restaurant in hong kong
old yee is a fussy eater
he complains no matter
how good the resturant is
really which one
its the zhus at kowloon
its the main branch of the
shanghai restaurant in hong kong
i think ive heard of it
ill be back late tonight
dont remember we have guests tomorrow
good night
were not invited tomorrow
he didnt tell me who the guest is
it must be wang jingweis
wife chen bijun
theyre forming a new government
they sent for old hsiao already
that means mr yee is going
to be promoted isnt he
as she said  the tile
reads hit on the mark
whyre you so late
was playing mahjong
sorry i lost again
what about mr yee
barely saw him for a minute
he left and didnt come back
hey move aside im bushed
hey i killed a beer bottle
its already been a month
whats so great about shooting
one or two beer bottles
you might as well shoot me
to spare my dad from doing the job
the house car
losing at mahjong
shopping for expensive stuff
buying a whore for you
are we here on holiday
or to kill a traitor
how many dads do you think i have
wong chia chi needs
expensive jewellery
and you want to be
a resistance hero
what about me im a chauffeur
in the day and a sentry at night
my dad has been asking around
he thinks ive been
fooling around in hong kong
he wants to break off all ties with me
why dont you guys think about that
we have guns
why dont we kill some easy ones first
if not school will be starting soon
everyones here voluntarily
we cant blame it all on kuang yumin
i know were in financial difficulties
i should have planned for this
i admit we dont have any experience
but we committed ourselves to this
we finally inflitrated the yee
household after so much effort
we cant just give up now
the guards are now familiar with me
ill find a chance to do it myself
dont worry ill take
care of the consequences
dont be dumb you think
you can do it alone
thats my problem
my documents are in the study
mr yee
mrs mak
the car broke down halfway
and it started raining
send mrs mak in
hong kongs so humid you can wring
out water even in a handshake
yeah even shanghai isnt that bad
im still not used to it even now
mrs hsiao
i thought you wouldnt be
coming because of the weather
why are you back
rains too heavy i changed my plans
mrs mak mrs zhu youre here
were waiting for mrs hsiao
just nice we need one more player
i still have something to do
why dont you just play for a while
you havent played for ages
mr yee mrs yees getting angry
ok
mr yee liked the
material we chose that day
he didnt like the last one
is there any tailor
youre familiar with
yes i know of one hes quite good
we make our suits and dresses there
want to try making one there
ill leave it to you
but its the peak season now
theyre busy with tourists requests
will it take a few months
no not that long were
old customers anyway
i can hurry him
when mr yee is free
mrs yee can give me a call
mrs mak i have your phone number
we can probably get a discount
if we make one or two more
mr yee prefers uk imports
they dont give discounts for those
really
ive won
your luck today is pretty good
i didnt even realise id won
the god of fortune must have come
ah mr yee
i recognised your voice
itll complement your face
more if the collar is narrower
yes a smaller collar looks better
shorten the sleeves a little more
i said you should shorten the sleeves
itll make you look more sprightly
ill leave it to you
this is a more modern design
the collar looks good
your dress is ready
ill try it on
go and eat first dont wait for me
does mrs mak often
make her clothes here
yes
shes a frequent customer of ours
its too fitting i
cant breathe properly
mrs yee originally chose this one
but she didnt want it so i took it
ill leave it as it is
then ill take it off
wear it
alright
is mrs yee ok
old cao will bring her to the doctor
she said she had a headache when we
were about to leave must be the mahjong
my husband doesnt like
me to play mahjong too
i said men have many ways to
entertain themselves outside
but for women we can
only shop and play mahjong
mahjong isnt that bad
at least we stay at home
when i called today
did i disturb you
my husband isnt home
he went to singapore
so his friends came over
to accompany me
in case i was bored
but in fact hes getting
them to keep watch on me
i had an excuse to
escape because you called
really
i dont mind going out
alone when im free
my husband isnt interested
in the things i like
what do you like
watching movies he doesnt
want to go so i go alone
hes always talking business
with those friends of his
theyre not interested
in the movies at all
i dont watch movies too
mr yee is a busy man only
frivolous people watch movies
no thats not it
im afraid of the dark
will you drink some
ill drink a little with you
we dont know many people in hong kong
so were always troubling you
its trivial stuff you
dont have to stand on airs
if youre observant nothing is trivial
there dont seem to
be many customers here
its because their food sucks
sorry but its convenient to talk here
no one will disturb you
is mr mak busy with his work
i dont even know what hes busy about
he went to singapore
in the past two days
but as long as the men dont
come home everything elses fine
isnt it
what kind of business does mr mak do
import and export
if youre so interested in mr mak
ill bring him along the next time
at least men have more conversation
topics among themselves
with women they can only
talk about trivial matters
to me a chance to
talk relaxedly like this
is hard to come by
the people i associate with
are those with high reputations
they talk all the time about politics
the fate of generations
hang by their mouths
it doesnt matter what their views are
in all of their eyes
i see the same thing
what
fear
what about you youre
different from the rest
youre not afraid are you
what about you
youre smart but youre
not very good at mahjong
yeah i always lose
ive only won you before
your suit is ready do you
want me to collect it for you
ill call you
i have an appointment later
i still have some time so
ill send you home first
is it convenient
yes
theyre here
turn off the lights guard the outside
thanks ill send you to the door
you dont have to
wait for me
theyre coming
turn off the lights
theyre about to come in
dont blame me if you
miss your appointment
too bad you have an appointment  or
you can send the car away
come up for some tea
give me a stiff drink
hes very careful when
we were at the tailors
he sent away old hsiao
and the bodyguard
that means even old hsiao
isnt someone he trusts
no worries just do the
same thing the next time
and get him into the house
well get him with one bullet
hes wary of mr mak
so he wont come in
he meets at very obscure places
possibly old hsiao might
not even know of them
is he interested
mr mak isnt pleased
not yet but i know his intentions
otherwise he wouldnt
have sent me to the door
its just that hes
too afraid to come in
he was dallying by the entrance
he said he wanted to see me again
i originally thought of
meeting at the cinema
since itll be easier
to make an escape there
but hes a really careful man
he said he wouldnt go to dark places
if he calls again itll be serious
ill have to agree to be his mistress
and then
have you guys thought what next
do you know how to do it
between a man and a woman
youve all discussed
this before already
who
only liang junsheng has experience
with a whore
do you want to drink
no need
the lights
you seem to be more responsive today
i dont want to discuss this with you
we cooked some porridge
hello mrs mak how are you
i called you two days ago
but you werent in
i wanted to ask if youve
tailored the clothes
youre not having it done any more why
going back to shanghai
well congratulations then
ill go over right now
you havent called
for the past few days
so i thought id drop by
ill go to the airport tomorrow then
i should really
i should really see you off right
youre leaving just like that
i see
give mr yee my regards
bon voyage
goodbye
moving house hope im not disturbing
huang youre no longer
driving a mover now are you
what are you doing here cao
to pay mr and mrs mak a visit
and their cute friends
what do you want
right from the start i
knew something was wrong
i kept quiet about it
so i could see what you were up to
so mr mak is from lingnan university
cao dont do anything reckless
mr yee didnt take me to shanghai
why dont i repent my ways
i know a lot more than you guys
your superiors must know
that im more valuable than you guys
how much money do you want
id say at least 10 gold taels
and that doesnt
include mrs maks price
im thinking mr yee would
pay even more for her
youre asking for it
you really have it going bro
i didnt know you were a spy
you should be the one helping me out
instead why are you making use of me
even though were fellow villagers
you helped a traitor
you should have known
what was coming for you
hes not dead yet
youre back
morning
youre back
morning
aunt im back
has your father written
ill check the mail later
aunt im going to school
youre still letting her study
i sold off the house
her father left for her
in return i agreed to let
her finish her studies
im a person who keeps her word
it is the time for victory
in the past 500 years
having endured the
tyranny of imperialism
the whole asia has now
broken free and achieved freedom
asia is now returning to asians hands
for every day it is not
we will fight unceasingly for freedom
youd never have expected
that our actions in hong kong
were being observed secretly
after you left that night
they appeared and cleaned up the mess
they smuggled us out of hong kong
whos they
theyre from chong qing
theyre the ones
who assassinated the shanghai mayor
now you know how childish we were
it was really ridiculous
yes especially me
i was just dumb
it was my fault
we all paid a price
hows everyone
theyre all still around
where
a few places its
not convenient to say
ive been looking for you
i didnt go back to school
i later taught language
lessons at a community centre
it seems i have no memory
of that period of time
my father wrote me a letter
saying he couldnt afford
to send me to england
he wanted me to resume my studies
and stay with my aunt in shanghai
after the pacific war broke out
it became very difficult
to leave hong kong
i only got my permit this april
these few years
i feel like i dont
have much left anymore
thats why i wanted
to continue schooling
even though im forced
to learn japanese
im glad youre back in school
ill never be able to again
why are you looking for me
just to apologise
i have a task at hand
that incident hasnt been concluded
yee is now in charge of wang
jingweis spy operations
on the surface its
maintaning public peace
but hes just a dog of the japanese
he kills judges and academics
who are antijapanese
journalists and our informants too
three years ago we
missed a valuable chance
now its even harder
his security is tighter than before
we dont have a chance to get him
boss give me a little more wont you
dont mess it up
you can call me wu
i believe kuang yumin has
already talked to you about it
sit
lets get to the point
first and also usually last
before you go on a mission
sew this into your clothes
in case your identity is exposed
its only a precaution
it wont be painful but do it quickly
be sure to do it before they
restrain your hands get it
is your memory good
remember every single word i say
repeat it in your mind
dont ask questions and dont think
just remember youre mrs mak
youve always lived in hong kong
and have no relatives in shanghai
this is very important
you must know
our enemies are very
careful and cunning
once you arouse his
suspicions youll be dead
i have to warn you first
i can do it
this is your file
four years ago you married mr mak
your marriage certificate
and your wedding anniversary
you live in luobiancheng
street in hong kong
and moved to zhuangshidun street
after hong kong fell mr maks
business took a turn for the worse
so you had to run
errands to make ends meet
your telephone numbers
for home and mr maks office
which goods were in scarce
supply in hong kong last year
and what you cant buy in shanghai
your bank account number
you need to commit
all of these to memory
you need to be able to
answer unhesitatingly
this is only the first
step you need to know that
once you start you cant look back
silk stockings western medicine
you need to remember the prices
of everything on the list
my job ends here
the rest is up to you any questions
i wrote a letter to my father
could you mail it to
him after you read it
once you complete your task
well send you to england
you should go dress up
i want to see mrs mak
what about your part
the cars ready

ah ma says he went to nanjing
i dont know if thats true

the previous day he brought
me to no 1237 xia fei road
i know we had people there
there was perfume in the apartment
there was a smell of
jasmine flowers nearby
but it didnt seem like it
was left there on that day
there was dust on the pillows
i dont know
wong chia chi
i dont know
wong chia chi wong chia chi
look at me look at me
i wont let you be harmed understand
i wont let you get hurt
she said im old already but youre still
flirting with me lit eating tofu
i said old tofu is the best
since its mr yees birthday
she toasted him for longetivity
i havent seen mr yee
for the past few days
hes gone to nanjing
on official business
well even though you say
shes old she still looks good
but qianchus is really bad
close the door
i was waiting for you
you must be tired then
im very tired
mrs yee said you went to nanjing
dont believe what you hear
ive been very busy these few days
we broke a resistance cell in chong qing
and arrested ten of them
theyd gone through rigorous training
so i had to personally
interrogate them one by one
to get anything out of them
ah i forgot
youre not interested
in my work are you
its very boring
youve been very careful all this while
not to ask me about it
thats your business
you never ask about me too
the only thing i can do is to
wait for you here every day
maybe you have another woman outside
i cant sleep if this continues
youll be bored of me too
youve been busy thinking
of this these few days
and ive been losing a lot at mahjong
the hardearned money ive made
ive lost almost all of it
i should go back to bed
get some rest
ill bring you to a
better place tomorrow
dont come into this room again
make way
lets go back
the minister said to wait for him
its been two hours already
two people came in at the last minute
drive
its very cold outside you
could have let me wait inside
wait inside
you want to go into that place
you really want to go into where i work
i know forget it
why are you looking at me like that
you shouldnt be so beautiful
i was thinking of you today my
secretary said i was distracted
he was reporting to me
but i only saw his mouth moving
not a word went into my head
i can smell your fragrance
i couldnt concentrate
those two people
we arrested at the bus stop
theyre key members
from the chong qing cell
he killed some of our people
when we were arresting them
we bludgeoned one of them
till his brains spilled out
and we still had to drag
him back for questioning
i went down with secretary zhang
one of them had already died
half of his head was gone
and his eyeballs were a pulp
i recognised the other one he was
a classmate from the party school
i saw his hands chained to the posts
i couldnt say anything
what came to my mind
was he screwing you
the bastards blood sprayed
onto my leather shoes
do you know i had to clean
them before i came out
he really agreed to
give you an apartment
i already told mrs yee
im moving out next weekend
he was there i dont think
hell go back on his word
thats great that old pervert
finally let his guard down
once we have a fixed location
itll be easier to make a move
theres no hurry
what are we waiting for
we need information he broke
our source of information
and took our advanced
american arms
we suffered a great loss
the strange thing is even the
japanese are looking for these arms
wong chia chi is very important to us
we must make full use of her
but she has never
undergone proper training
she cant take the longterm strain
you underestimate her her strength
lies in her ability to play mrs mak
its no mean feat that
she got to this point
the superiors value her greatly
we had two trained female comrades
who hooked him for a while
but he found them out
and killed them
we even lost a namelist to them
you dont understand how
dangerous her situation is
she agreed to seduce yee
and shes done it
now is the time for action
dont tell me when to take action
listen up
yee killed my wife
and my two kids
but i could still
sit at the same table
and have a meal with him
this is the life of a spy
i would like better than
no one else to kill him now
as long as he has value to us
alive i will let him live
continue baiting him
and report back regularly
dont move without my orders
remember
a resistance agent
only has one motivation
loyalty
loyalty to the party to the leaders
to the country understand
dont worry ill act accordingly
good
you only need to continue
luring him into the trap
if theres a need
what do you think this trap is
my body who do you think he is
he knows how to act
better than you guys
he not only wants to be
inside my body
but worms his way into
my heart like a snake
im like his slave allowing him in
i can only loyally wait
playing my role
to get into his heart
hell make me bleed
and cry in agony
before hes satisfied
thats the only way
he can feel alive
in the darkness only he
knows this is all real
thats enough
thats why
thats why i can let myself
be tortured to breaking point
and still continue till i
cant take it any further
thats enough
every time after the final spasm
i think will it be this time
will our people rush in
and blow his brains out
and his blood and brains
will spill all over me
stop it
was it mr yees plan to bring
me to the japanese district
good evening
welcome
im looking for mr yee
this way please
pretty girl isnt she
come here
lieutenant colonel nakamura
sorry
even the girls are dumping you
this is a customer
not one of our girls
keiko go accompany colonel nakamura
get some more sake
my apologies
sorry for that
your guest is here
im punishing myself by
waiting for you this time
why here
official business
they sound like theyre crying
the japs kill people indiscriminately but
actually theyre more afraid than anyone else
they know that eventually once they
start fighting with the americans
itll be over and all these actors
are still frivolously
singing their opera
just listen
i know why you asked me here
why
you want me to be your whore
whore
i brought you here to see
how good a geisha youd make
ill sing a song for you
i sing better than them
really
tears stain my sleeve
this girl has been thinking
of him all the while till now
go back first i still have work to do
so late
i have a favour to ask you
tomorrow bring this
letter to this address
look for a man called hali salahuddin
can you remember that
hali salahuddin
if he says something to you
or gives your something tell me
keep it a secret between the two of us
its a name card only
yees name is on it
put it back what do you think
im afraid wong chia
chi is under suspicion
if we send some men down to scout
the area we might fall into his trap
if wong chia chi goes alone
itll be dangerous too
its best that we
keep a lookout outside
you should go quickly
wong chia chi im really sorry
you could have done it three years ago
why didnt you
good stuff

drama troupe in hong kong

the shooter could have escaped
from the rear of the peace theatre
when we checked they all
had movie tickets to fit in
these students

why didnt you tell me before
because of your
relationship with miss wong
of course its all clear now
i left her in the interrogation room
do you want to
interrogate her personally
shes downstairs
luo and ban are watching her
the rest have been sentenced
it was simple their
confessions matched
