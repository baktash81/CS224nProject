 this is a play on words 
a phrase used in mahjong 
speaking of moving  i
forgot to congratulate you  
  on mr  liang s promotion 
can you even call that a promotion 
he only supervises the rations 
you can t even get rice from india now 
those in charge of rice are more powerful
than those who guard the treasury 
mrs  yee is right 
me  i m not a living buddha 
but you should listen to me 
if he takes a consignment 
he won t be home for 3 days 
you ll be free then 
i don t have the time 
his relatives are always coming around 
they pack the place  even the corridors 
i ll take that   mahjong terminology 
i still have to settle their meals 
it s not even as though
i m getting paid for this 
yeah 
don t mislead mrs  mak  
  into thinking government officials  
  are the tiles we re playing with now 
isn t that so 
the japanese would
never have thought that   
  even the emperor gets henpecked 
eat while it s hot 
i can t eat any more  i m getting fat   
everyone hoards up stuff now 
since we can t do anything
else  just hoard up fat then 
what else is good to
stock up on  mrs  yee 
you know my husband is
in the import business 
i ll take that   mahjong terminology 
even though hong kong has fallen   
  the ships still need to call 
i ll eat that   mahjong terminology 
western medicine 
the last shipment sold out very quickly 
he should get more of them 
i heard you went to shu yu yesterday 
yes  with some others  mrs 
mak hasn t been there before 
it s embarrassing that i haven t 
there re two new branches in hong kong 
the sichuan and hong kong
chefs couldn t get along   
  and besides hong kongers
can t take spicy food 
isn t it spicy 
yes  it really was 
9 wan  mahjong terminology 
2 wan 
i ll take that 
mrs  mak didn t go yesterday 
she hasn t come for a few days 
i had things to take care at home 
since you had enough players 
i decided to take a break 
an excuse to hide eh 
who was it who said she wasn t
free a few days ago over the phone 
that day doesn t count 
i went to fetch mrs  mak 
you can ask her if you don t believe me 
i specially chose to treat you
to a meal that day  mrs  mak 
she did it deliberately 
i ll take that tile 
do you still have more
of those stockings 
yes  but i gave them all away 
if you want i can bring
more the next time 
ok 
goods are running scarce in shanghai 
there s even a black market
for soap and toothpaste 
you should come more often 
there s a place for you to stay 
i think he s had enough 
the kempeitai  japanese military police 
will demand for him 
they didn t specify whether
he should be dead or alive 
just give it to him 
how will you account to miura 
they re investigating the arms the
americans supplied to chong qing 
i ll meet him tonight 
his secretary called to say
today s dinner was cancelled 
he wants you to report directly
to headquarters tomorrow 
you re not returning
to the office today 
i still have an appointment 
my relatives asked someone
to get some from the russians 
rings  jewels from the aristocracy 
they re begging for cigarette
butts on the streets 
afraid of getting fakes 
you women started early today 
that s a good hand you have 
mr  yee is here to show his support 
sorry   my turn 
that s a good one you have 
how many carats is yours  three carats 
what do you think of this  i tire of it 
it s no longer fashionable  i was
thinking of getting it changed 
pin fen has new stock 
there s a new five carat one 
it s large  but not as bright as yours 
why didn t you call me then 
i only took a brief glance 
pin fen has some stuff that
can t be gotten outside 
they wouldn t sell that  fire gem  to me 
 shanghainese term for a high grade jewel 
how much is it worth now 
that fire gem of yours is ten carats 
it s not as though it s a pigeon s egg 
gems are just stones 
if you wear such large jewellery 
you can t even play mahjong 
nagging at me even though
you wouldn t buy it for me 
ah  i won 
combo win   mahjong terminology 
i was about to win myself 
it s all mr  yee s fault   
  for saying you can t play
mahjong if you wear jewellery 
he did it on purpose 
thank you mr  yee 
mr  yee should treat us to a meal 
sure  where do you want to go 
shu yu  western medicine

somewhere more expensive 
oh dear  i forget 
i have an appointment at three

shanghainese is very good 
my mum is from shanghai 
when i was young
some relatives of mine

i heard from teacher that
guangzhou has been lost

i never thought that we d have to
rely on the brits to protect us 
isn t your dad in britain 
why didn t he bring you with him 
he took my younger brother 
when my mum died he said he d take me 
but two years later  war broke out 
i m not going back again 
war gave me the chance
to go to hong kong 
i want to go overseas
and see the world outside 
see you by the pond after class tonight 
let s go back to our apartment together 
ok 
hey  lai shu jin 
i was just looking for you 
kuang yumin  you still remember me 
yes  i saw you acting 
lingnan university s
women s drama society 
we ve set up a new drama society 
we re auditioning for members today 
but the women s drama society has never  
  collaborated with males 
since we re borrowing hong kong
university s premises for classes  
  and we have a lack of manpower 
we should work together 
we can do ibsen s  the doll house  
i know nora s lines
at the back of my hand 
at this kind of time who has the mood   
   to see this kind of bourgeoise show 
we re intending to
stage a patriotic play   
   to raise funds for the war 
you should come for the
audition tomorrow too 
but i m only a freshman 
i ve never acted before 
it doesn t matter 
everyone should play their part
for the resistance movement 
while the soldiers are
fighting on the frontlines    
   the hong kongers are relaxing 
we need to awaken them
from their complacency 
what a typical director 
he doesn t listen to anyone 
but since it s the resistance    
   we girls can t lose out to the guys 
i just can t stand the thought
of following his beck and call 
he s quite passionate isn t he 
not long after his brother
graduated from the military academy    
   he got killed in the war 
so his family wouldn t
let him join the army 
so that s why he s so agitated 
i don t want him to get drafted either 
i return myself to the
land which nurtured me 
and my soul   
more to the left  more 
ok  that s fine 
let s try it out 
what s up 
my dad got married 
i m writing a letter
to congratulate him 
the pre stage jitters will
disappear once the curtains open 
auntie zhao 
they found this officer
behind the hills 
xiao hong  has your brother come home 
shh  come in quickly 
my son  quickly  go boil some water 
what happened to you 
he s an army officer  not your son 
my son is coming home tonight 
coming home to eat dinner 
i should slaughter a chicken for him 
my son is coming back 
he s coming back today 
my son is coming back 
my son is coming back 
ever since she knew my
brother died on the warfront    
   my mum took ill 
i made this for my brother 
i just finished knitting it 
but he ll never get to wear it 
please have it 
i can t  you saved my life 
i don t have anything to repay you with 
saving our country is payment enough 
killing the enemy is taking
revenge for my brother 
i hate myself for being a woman    
   and i promised my brother   
   to take care of mum 
i want to set his mind at rest 
your brother   
he was the same age as you 
ever since my dad died    
   he d been taking care of the family 
he d work faster than everyone else 
every year during the harvest    
   he d help others after
harvesting our own crops 
he was also as rugged as you 
i d always follow him wherever he went 
he d always say heaven would
bless the honest and kind 
our family had our hopes pinned on him 
i ll kowtow to you 
for this country 
for my dead brother    
   for the generations of people    
china cannot fall 
china cannot fall 
china cannot fall 
china cannot fall 
cheers 
this calls for a celebration 
that was really great 
everyone was shouting out   
   china cannot fall  
 china cannot fall  
600  600 people seated in the audience 
and those standing in the aisle too 
don t underestimate
these hong kongers eh 
when we performed at lingnan   
  we never had such an
enthusiastic response 
what we staged is the reality 
the audience can emphasise 
so naturally they re touched 
during the fund raising
i saw many people tearing 
cheers to everyone  for
raising this sum of money   
  and doing our bit for the war 
we must drink to our
heart s content tonight 
let s worry about the nation tomorrow 
cheers  bro 
i have an idea  listen to me 
we should sell tickets 
and write on the door 
 while stocks last  
if it s you  it s more like   
   it s hard to sell even one ticket 
here  give me the drinks 
careful 
cheers to our leading man and lady 
our ticket sales depend on her 
to our leading man and lady 
i m not  i m not 
  we re the peach blossoms
 students  of today   
  the pillars of society tomorrow   
  we re singing together today   
  saving the people
tomorrow on a giant wave   
  a giant wave 
continuously expanding   
  classmates  my dear students   
  let your strength prop up the
rise and fall of this world   
  a giant wave  a giant wave   
hurry 
to the top 
have you lighted it 
it won t do if peformers don t smoke 
try it  it ll come in
useful during acting 
wong chia chi took a blow 
who wants  
gimme 
let me take a drag 
thank you 
why 
wong chia chi 
come up 
i met a fellow villager
from my hometown  
  called tsao de xi 
he went to the same school as my brother 
so we re familiar with each other 
i heard he s an assistant
officer  working for the guy  
  in charge of the  peaceful exercise  
his name is yee 
he s wang jingwei s aide  in
charge of espionage and spying 
he s now in hong kong 
wang jingwei s runs the
 peaceful exercise   but  
  he s just a lackey of the japanese 
he s a traitor who betrayed our country 
wang is now accumulating troops 
hong kong is under yee s purview 
this tsao guy i met   
this is a chance 
what chance 
this isn t theatre 
no matter how much we trade on our
audience s tears and shout our voices hoarse   
  it s incomparable to
killing a real traitor 
we can do it this holidays
so the school won t find out 
we need to disguise ourselves  
  and think of a way to
infiltrate the yee household 
i ll get a favour from old tsao  
  and get him to introduce us 
and then we ll get guns   
but which of us knows
how to kill a person 
we ve only killed people on stage 
when you see a traitor
in front of your eyes   
  you ll know that killing
isn t difficult at all 
it s only a matter
of how many  how fast 
this is a matter of life and death  i
want everyone to consider it carefully 
if you re in  then let s
make this a big one 
knives together  let s
not waste our youth   
  and slay one of
wang jingwei s lackeys 
i m in 
count me in 
then we ll too  
i don t want to force anyone 
i m in too 
 lil un  i didn t expect
you d come find me 
we haven t met since
we left our hometown 
less talk  cheers 
drink up 
i should also thank brother tsao 
from now on you must
take care of us 
sure  sure  sure 
here s one to you 
brother  can you see
if you can help us 
can you help us find work 
it s tough  but let
me think of something 
where s liang junsheng 
he s still up there 
what s he doing 
we only have enough for tsao 
maybe he can get more information 
just on those few glasses of cat s piss 
the caucasians have all gone on holiday 
we can use the second
floor for two months 
where d you get the money from 
my dad left me some money
in hong kong  
  in case of emergencies 
i didn t ask you to get
something so luxurious 
if you want auyang to
be mr  mak  a businessman  
  and wong chia chi to be
mrs  mak  a rich housewife   
  this is the kind of
place they should live in 
let s decorate this place
and get some furniture 
and get a maid 
does mr  mak need a moustache 
hold on 
don t use my best tie
to wipe your mouth with 
this isn t a rehearsal  there
won t be a second chance 
remember your own roles 
don t say what you re
not supposed to say 
you too 
they re here 
mr  mak  mrs  mak 
this is mr  mak s cousin  a friend
from my hometown  kuang yumin 
this is mr  yee  and mrs  yee 
you accompany them 
i ll take my leave first 
sorry about making you drive
all the way here to get me 
old tsao said you were
familiar with hong kong 
if we d not have used
my husband s car 
it s no problem 
it s along the way 
mrs  yee  do you want
to visit chung wan 
though we ve been in hong kong
for a few months already   
  the only places we know are
chung wan and repulse bay 
how about tsim sha tsui then 
we can take a stroll there too 
sure 
to tsim sha tsui  queen s harbour 
can you drop us off before
you return to the office 
it won t matter if we
make a slight detour right 
i wouldn t want to inconvenience
mr  mak s official business 
it s a family business  it s all right 
what line are you in  mr  mak 
export trading 
we also do importing 
mrs  yee  where you live is pretty good 
when we were looking for
a house  did we look here 
it s just a rental  once war
broke out on the mainland   
  we moved here hastily 
mrs  mak  were you born here 
i married here  my mum s
hometown is in guangzhou 
my mum is from shanghai 
then your shanghainese must be good 
i can speak  but not well 
i ve forgotten it all 
 they are speaking in shanghainese 
my hometown is anhui 
my shanghainese isn t too good either 
thanks  sorry for bothering you   
  and helping me carry my stuff 
no  i should 
you re welcome  since
he s my husband s cousin 
he also just arrived in hong kong 
we brought him along to see the sights 
what do you do in guangzhou 
i teach  in an elementary
school in the village 
as expected  you have a scholarly air 
either a college student or a teacher 
mrs  yee  you have a good eye 
didn t you see those
plainclothes bodyguards 
there s no way we can make a
move on him at his own place 
whenever he goes out there re at least a few
bodyguards by his side in addition to the chaffeur 
even if we get him out there re at least
three people we ll have to deal with 
we need at least two guns 
but it s still better
than attacking him at home 
be more patient  we re already on track 
mrs  yee has a good
impression of wong chia chi 
she s already arranged a second meeting 
sorry  i m tired 
can i come in 
come in 
i pressed the tailor to hurry 
thank you 
what does yee look like 
i only got a glimpse  he
wasn t what i expected 
our cook  he just left like that 
he didn t take anything 
but the man just disappeared 
so we moved to the ban dao hotel 
it s already five days  and
we don t dare to go back  
my husband says it isn t safe  so we
need to find somewhere else to stay 
you can t trust the people here 
these cantonese  i can t catch
a word of what they re saying 
exactly  i m quite irritated 
where can i find a cook   
  who can whip up some decent
shanghainese dishes now 
i know there s a place
in hong kong   
  which serves
decent shanghainese food 
they have good fried shallot
carp and drunken chicken 
then bring us there 
hey  old yee  mrs  mak just said  
  there s a good shanghainese
restaurant in hong kong 
old yee is a fussy eater 
he complains no matter
how good the resturant is 
really  which one 
it s the zhu s  at kowloon 
it s the main branch of the
shanghai restaurant in hong kong 
i think i ve heard of it 
i ll be back late tonight 
don t remember we have guests tomorrow 
good night 
we re not invited tomorrow 
he didn t tell me who the guest is 
it must be wang jingwei s
wife  chen bijun 
they re forming a new government 
they sent for old hsiao already 
that means mr  yee is going
to be promoted isn t he 
as she said    the tile
reads  hit  on the mark   
why re you so late 
was playing mahjong 
sorry  i lost again 
what about mr  yee 
barely saw him for a minute 
he left and didn t come back 
hey  move aside  i m bushed 
hey  i killed a beer bottle 
it s already been a month 
what s so great about shooting
one or two beer bottles 
you might as well shoot me 
to spare my dad from doing the job 
the house  car 
losing at mahjong   
  shopping for expensive stuff 
buying a whore for you   
are we here on holiday
or to kill a traitor 
how many dads do you think i have 
wong chia chi needs
expensive jewellery   
  and you want to be
a resistance hero   
what about me  i m a chauffeur
in the day and a sentry at night 
my dad has been asking around 
he thinks i ve been
fooling around in hong kong 
he wants to break off all ties with me 
why don t you guys think about that 
we have guns 
why don t we kill some easy ones first 
if not school will be starting soon 
everyone s here voluntarily 
we can t blame it all on kuang yumin 
i know we re in financial difficulties 
i should have planned for this 
i admit we don t have any experience 
but we committed ourselves to this 
we finally inflitrated the yee
household after so much effort 
we can t just give up now 
the guards are now familiar with me 
i ll find a chance to do it myself 
don t worry  i ll take
care of the consequences 
don t be dumb  you think
you can do it alone 
that s my problem 
my documents are in the study 
mr  yee 
mrs  mak 
the car broke down halfway 
and it started raining 
send mrs  mak in 
hong kong s so humid  you can wring
out water even in a handshake 
yeah  even shanghai isn t that bad 
i m still not used to it even now 
mrs  hsiao 
i thought you wouldn t be
coming because of the weather 
why are you back 
rain s too heavy  i changed my plans 
mrs  mak  mrs  zhu  you re here 
we re waiting for mrs  hsiao 
just nice  we need one more player 
i still have something to do 
why don t you just play for a while 
you haven t played for ages 
mr  yee  mrs  yee s getting angry 
ok 
mr  yee liked the
material we chose that day 
he didn t like the last one 
is there any tailor
you re familiar with 
yes  i know of one  he s quite good 
we make our suits and dresses there 
want to try making one there 
i ll leave it to you 
but it s the peak season now 
they re busy with tourists  requests 
will it take a few months 
no  not that long  we re
old customers anyway 
i can hurry him 
when mr  yee is free   
  mrs  yee can give me a call 
mrs  mak  i have your phone number 
we can probably get a discount  
  if we make one or two more 
mr  yee prefers uk imports  
  they don t give discounts for those 
really 
i ve won 
your luck today is pretty good 
i didn t even realise i d won 
the god of fortune must have come 
ah  mr  yee 
i recognised your voice 
it ll complement your face
more if the collar is narrower 
yes  a smaller collar looks better 
shorten the sleeves a little more 
i said  you should shorten the sleeves 
it ll make you look more sprightly 
i ll leave it to you 
this is a more modern design 
the collar looks good 
your dress is ready 
i ll try it on 
go and eat first  don t wait for me 
does mrs  mak often
make her clothes here 
yes 
she s a frequent customer of ours 
it s too fitting  i
can t breathe properly 
mrs  yee originally chose this one 
but she didn t want it so i took it 
i ll leave it as it is
then  i ll take it off 
wear it 
alright 
is mrs  yee ok 
old cao will bring her to the doctor 
she said she had a headache when we
were about to leave  must be the mahjong 
my husband doesn t like
me to play mahjong too 
i said  men have many ways to
entertain themselves outside 
but for women  we can
only shop and play mahjong 
mahjong isn t that bad 
at least we stay at home 
when i called today  
  did i disturb you 
my husband isn t home 
he went to singapore 
so his friends came over
to accompany me  
  in case i was bored 
but in fact he s getting
them to keep watch on me 
i had an excuse to
escape because you called 
really 
i don t mind going out
alone when i m free 
my husband isn t interested
in the things i like 
what do you like 
watching movies  he doesn t
want to go so i go alone 
he s always talking business
with those friends of his 
they re not interested
in the movies at all 
i don t watch movies too 
mr  yee is a busy man  only
frivolous people watch movies 
no  that s not it 
i m afraid of the dark 
will you drink some 
i ll drink a little with you 
we don t know many people in hong kong 
so we re always troubling you 
it s trivial stuff  you
don t have to stand on airs 
if you re observant  nothing is trivial 
there don t seem to
be many customers here 
it s because their food sucks 
sorry  but it s convenient to talk here 
no one will disturb you 
is mr  mak busy with his work 
i don t even know what he s busy about 
he went to singapore
in the past two days 
but as long as the men don t
come home  everything else s fine 
isn t it 
what kind of business does mr  mak do 
import and export 
if you re so interested in mr  mak   
  i ll bring him along the next time 
at least men have more conversation
topics among themselves 
with women they can only
talk about trivial matters 
to me  a chance to
talk relaxedly like this  
  is hard to come by 
the people i associate with
are those with high reputations 
they talk all the time about politics 
the fate of generations
hang by their mouths 
it doesn t matter what their views are 
in all of their eyes
i see the same thing 
  what 
  fear 
what about you  you re
different from the rest 
you re not afraid  are you 
what about you 
you re smart  but you re
not very good at mahjong 
yeah  i always lose 
i ve only won you before 
your suit is ready  do you
want me to collect it for you 
i ll call you 
i have an appointment later 
i still have some time  so
i ll send you home first 
is it convenient 
yes 
they re here 
turn off the lights  guard the outside 
thanks  i ll send you to the door 
you don t have to 
wait for me 
they re coming 
turn off the lights 
they re about to come in 
don t blame me if you
miss your appointment 
too bad you have an appointment   or 
you can send the car away 
come up for some tea 
give me a stiff drink 
he s very careful  when
we were at the tailor s  
  he sent away old hsiao
and the bodyguard 
that means even old hsiao
isn t someone he trusts 
no worries  just do the
same thing the next time  
  and get him into the house 
we ll get him with one bullet 
he s wary of  mr  mak  
so he won t come in 
he meets at very obscure places 
possibly old hsiao might
not even know of them 
is he interested  
mr  mak isn t pleased 
not yet  but i know his intentions 
otherwise he wouldn t
have sent me to the door 
it s just that he s
too afraid to come in 
he was dallying by the entrance 
he said he wanted to see me again 
i originally thought of
meeting at the cinema 
since it ll be easier
to make an escape there 
but he s a really careful man 
he said he wouldn t go to dark places 
if he calls again it ll be serious 
i ll have to agree to be his mistress 
and then 
have you guys thought  what next 
do you know how to do it 
between a man and a woman  
you ve all discussed
this before already 
who 
only liang junsheng has experience 
with a whore 
do you want to drink 
no need 
the lights 
you seem to be more responsive today 
i don t want to discuss this with you 
we cooked some porridge 
hello  mrs  mak  how are you 
i called you two days ago 
but you weren t in 
i wanted to ask if you ve
tailored the clothes 
you re not having it done any more  why 
going back to shanghai 
well  congratulations then 
i ll go over right now 
you haven t called
for the past few days 
so i thought i d drop by 
i ll go to the airport tomorrow then 
i should really  
i should really see you off  right 
you re leaving just like that 
i see 
give mr  yee my regards 
bon voyage 
goodbye 
moving house  hope i m not disturbing 
huang  you re no longer
driving  a mover now are you 
what are you doing here  cao 
to pay mr  and mrs  mak a visit 
and their cute friends 
what do you want 
right from the start i
knew something was wrong 
i kept quiet about it  
  so i could see what you were up to 
so mr  mak is from lingnan university 
cao  don t do anything reckless 
mr  yee didn t take me to shanghai 
why don t i repent my ways 
i know a lot more than you guys 
your superiors must know  
  that i m more valuable than you guys 
how much money do you want 
i d say at least 10 gold taels 
and that doesn t
include mrs  mak s price 
i m thinking mr  yee would
pay even more for her 
you re asking for it 
you really have it going  bro 
i didn t know you were a spy 
you should be the one helping me out 
instead why are you making use of me 
even though we re fellow villagers 
you helped a traitor 
you should have known
what was coming for you 
he s not dead yet 
you re back 
morning 
you re back 
morning 
aunt  i m back 
has your father written 
i ll check the mail later 
aunt  i m going to school 
you re still letting her study 
i sold off the house
her father left for her 
in return i agreed to let
her finish her studies 
i m a person who keeps her word 
it is the time for victory 
in the past 500 years   
  having endured the
tyranny of imperialism  
  the whole asia has now  
  broken free and achieved freedom 
asia is now returning to asians  hands 
for every day it is not   
  we will fight unceasingly for freedom 
you d never have expected  
  that our actions in hong kong  
  were being observed secretly 
after you left that night   
  they appeared and cleaned up the mess 
they smuggled us out of hong kong 
who s  they  
they re from chong qing 
they re the ones  
  who assassinated the shanghai mayor 
now you know how childish we were 
it was really ridiculous 
yes  especially me 
i was just dumb 
it was my fault 
we all paid a price 
how s everyone 
they re all still around 
where 
a few places  it s
not convenient to say 
i ve been looking for you 
i didn t go back to school 
i later taught language
lessons at a community centre 
it seems i have no memory
of that period of time 
my father wrote me a letter   
  saying he couldn t afford
to send me to england 
he wanted me to resume my studies
and stay with my aunt in shanghai 
after the pacific war broke out   
  it became very difficult
to leave hong kong 
i only got my permit this april 
these few years   
i feel like i don t
have much left anymore 
that s why i wanted
to continue schooling 
even though i m forced
to learn japanese 
i m glad you re back in school 
i ll never be able to again 
why are you looking for me 
just to apologise 
i have a task at hand 
that incident hasn t been concluded 
yee is now in charge of wang
jingwei s spy operations 
on the surface it s
maintaning public peace 
but he s just a dog of the japanese 
he kills judges and academics
who are anti japanese 
journalists  and our informants too 
three years ago we
missed a valuable chance 
now it s even harder 
his security is tighter than before 
we don t have a chance to get him 
boss  give me a little more won t you 
don t mess it up 
you can call me wu 
i believe kuang yumin has
already talked to you about it 
sit 
let s get to the point 
first  and also usually last    
before you go on a mission
sew this into your clothes 
in case your identity is exposed   
it s only a precaution 
it won t be painful  but do it quickly 
be sure to do it before they
restrain your hands  get it 
is your memory good 
remember every single word i say 
repeat it in your mind 
don t ask questions  and don t think 
just remember you re mrs  mak 
you ve always lived in hong kong 
and have no relatives in shanghai 
this is very important 
you must know  
  our enemies are very
careful and cunning 
once you arouse his
suspicions you ll be dead 
i have to warn you first 
i can do it 
this is your file 
four years ago you married mr  mak 
your marriage certificate 
and your wedding anniversary 
you live in luobiancheng
street in hong kong   
  and moved to zhuangshidun street 
after hong kong fell  mr  mak s
business took a turn for the worse 
so you had to run
errands to make ends meet 
your telephone numbers 
for home  and mr  mak s office 
which goods were in scarce
supply in hong kong last year   
  and what you can t buy in shanghai 
your bank account number 
you need to commit
all of these to memory 
you need to be able to
answer unhesitatingly 
this is only the first
step  you need to know that  
  once you start  you can t look back 
silk stockings  western medicine 
you need to remember the prices
of everything on the list 
my job ends here 
the rest is up to you  any questions 
i wrote a letter to my father 
could you mail it to
him after you read it 
once you complete your task 
we ll send you to england 
you should go dress up 
i want to see mrs  mak 
what about your part 
the car s ready 
the hotel room s paid up for a week 
it s the wang government s hq 
mrs  yee often eats there 
we ll let them meet there 
wait for me in the study  yes sir 
she s been to shanghai
a few times already 
she stayed at east asia
hotel but we never knew 
sorry about that 
if mr  mak wasn t so busy 
i d have contacted you earlier 
i said our house was just empty rooms   
  staying in a hotel was
just a waste of money 
i haven t been to hong kong for ages 
you re back 
do you remember mrs  mak 
mr  yee  how are you 
you must have forgotten me 
i haven t 
how s mr  mak and his business 
times are tough  thanks for asking 
mr  yee seems to have lost weight 
when he got his posting i
asked him to reconsider it 
it s nothing but hard
work and offending people 
you women go ahead 
he s quite friendly isn t he 
it s just acting 
are we still going to east asia today 
aren t you sick of the food there 
it s safer with the
special ops people there 
why 
bombs  it s chaotic out there 
any suspicious characters
are shot on the spot 
my siblings are in singapore   
  they told me it s
going to the dogs there 
they told me not to come 
is hong kong better 
it s the same  prices have doubled 
because of the war 
the black market is flourishing 
oh  you don t smoke 
i brought some ciggies for you 
it s in my luggage  i almost forgot 
thanks  you can t even get it
on the black market now 
yes  minister 
the room s a little
cramped  but it s safer here 
i was afraid of inconveniencing
you and mrs  yee 
it s her pleasure to have someone play
mahjong with her  i m also hardly at home 
have you been busy 
you ve lost a lot of weight 
you ve changed too 
it s been three years
and the war isn t over 
it s no easy feat that
we could still meet 
i brought some stuff for mrs  yee 
i didn t know what you like 
it s good enough that you re here 
the map of the yees 
residence  the front is blocked 
everyone enters and leaves via the back 
there re two chaffeurs  guo and yao 
guo drives mrs  yee 
ah ma and the servants
are from yee s hometown 
the chaffeur never leaves the
car  not sure if he s yee s eyes 
all belongings have to be
searched before boarding the car 
what about yee 
i met him once  he s rarely at home 
when he comes home he ll go to the
study  i haven t found a chance yet 
he has a secretary  zhang 
what s his full name 
i don t know yet 
you must be careful 
i need money 
take this for the time being 
how come you haven t gotten any better
even though you play mahjong every day 
i need to remember so many
things  i can t concentrate 
what about the rest  how are they 
they re all concerned about
you  you ll meet them eventually 
fortunately you didn t come
to the opera with me yesterday 
it made my head hurt 
what did they sing yesterday 
wu jia po  it was terrible singing 
all the good singers
have fled to hong kong 
i told mr  yee that if
the government of his   
  can t even bring in a decent opera   
  no matter how much good they do 
the people won t acknowledge it 
morning 
good morning  mr  yee 
the chinese herbs you ve been taking
contains turtle shell and staghorn

it wasn t like this three years ago 
i hate you 
i said i believe you 
i haven t believed
anyone for a long time

then you must be very lonely 
but i m still alive 
you left for four days without a word 
do you know i was
hating you every minute 
now that i m back  do you still hate me 
no 
are you still going back to hong kong 
i want to go back 
give me an apartment 
brother  you can t do
something illegal like this 
i  i didn t  why are you here 
i went to the teahouse to find you 
our branch members have
been taken into custody 
some of our safe
houses have been raided 
fortunately ouyang was
alert enough to escape 
all our lines of
communication have to be cut 
you can t go back to the old places 
then when will we act 
we need to wait for orders from the top 
can you hurry them 
after all this  can we
all leave this place 
i can t say  i don t know 
i haven t seen him
for the last few days 
ah ma says he went to nanjing 
i don t know if that s true 
he might have another woman 
the previous day he brought
me to no  1237 xia fei road 
i know  we had people there 
there was perfume in the apartment 
there was a smell of
jasmine flowers nearby 
but it didn t seem like it
was left there on that day 
there was dust on the pillows 
i don t know 
wong chia chi  
i don t know  
wong chia chi  wong chia chi 
look at me  look at me 
i won t let you be harmed  understand 
i won t let you get hurt 
she said  i m old already but you re still
flirting with me  lit   eating tofu    
i said  old tofu is the best  
since it s mr  yee s birthday   
  she toasted him for longetivity 
i haven t seen mr  yee
for the past few days 
he s gone to nanjing
on official business 
well  even though you say
she s old she still looks good 
but qianchu s is really bad 
close the door 
i was waiting for you 
you must be tired then 
i m very tired 
mrs  yee said you went to nanjing 
don t believe what you hear 
i ve been very busy these few days 
we broke a resistance cell in chong qing 
and arrested ten of them 
they d gone through rigorous training 
so i had to personally
interrogate them one by one  
  to get anything out of them 
ah  i forgot  
  you re not interested
in my work are you 
it s very boring 
you ve been very careful all this while  
  not to ask me about it 
that s your business 
you never ask about me too 
the only thing i can do is to
wait for you here every day 
maybe you have another woman outside 
i can t sleep  if this continues  
  you ll be bored of me too 
you ve been busy thinking
of this these few days 
and i ve been losing a lot at mahjong 
the hard earned money i ve made 
i ve lost almost all of it 
i should go back to bed 
get some rest 
i ll bring you to a
better place tomorrow 
don t come into this room again 
make way 
let s go back 
the minister said to wait for him 
it s been two hours already 
two people came in at the last minute 
drive 
it s very cold outside  you
could have let me wait inside 
wait inside 
you want to go into that place 
you really want to go into where i work 
i know  forget it 
why are you looking at me like that 
you shouldn t be so beautiful 
i was thinking of you today  my
secretary said i was distracted 
he was reporting to me   
  but i only saw his mouth moving 
not a word went into my head 
i can smell your fragrance 
i couldn t concentrate 
those two people   
  we arrested at the bus stop 
they re key members
from the chong qing cell 
he killed some of our people 
when we were arresting them   
  we bludgeoned one of them
till his brains spilled out 
and we still had to drag
him back for questioning 
i went down with secretary zhang 
one of them had already died 
half of his head was gone 
and his eyeballs were a pulp 
i recognised the other one  he was
a classmate from the party school 
i saw his hands chained to the posts 
i couldn t say anything 
what came to my mind  
  was he screwing you 
the bastard s blood sprayed
onto my leather shoes 
do you know i had to clean
them before i came out 
he really agreed to
give you an apartment 
i already told mrs  yee 
i m moving out next weekend 
he was there  i don t think
he ll go back on his word 
that s great  that old pervert
finally let his guard down 
once we have a fixed location
it ll be easier to make a move 
there s no hurry 
what are we waiting for 
we need information  he broke
our source of information   
  and took our advanced
american arms 
we suffered a great loss 
the strange thing is  even the
japanese are looking for these arms 
wong chia chi is very important to us 
we must make full use of her 
but she has never
undergone proper training 
she can t take the long term strain 
you underestimate her  her strength  
  lies in her ability to play mrs  mak 
it s no mean feat that
she got to this point 
the superiors value her greatly 
we had two trained female comrades
who hooked him for a while   
  but he found them out
and killed them 
we even lost a namelist to them 
you don t understand how
dangerous her situation is 
she agreed to seduce yee 
and she s done it 
now is the time for action 
don t tell me when to take action 
listen up 
yee killed my wife  
  and my two kids 
but i could still  
  sit at the same table
and have a meal with him 
this is the life of a spy 
i would like better than
no one else to kill him now 
as long as he has value to us
alive  i will let him live 
continue baiting him 
and report back regularly 
don t move without my orders 
remember 
a resistance agent
only has one motivation  
  loyalty 
loyalty to the party  to the leaders 
to the country  understand 
don t worry  i ll act accordingly 
good 
you only need to continue
luring him into the trap 
if there s a need 
what do you think this trap is 
my body  who do you think he is 
he knows how to act
better than you guys 
he not only wants to be
inside my body   
  but worms his way into
my heart like a snake 
i m like his slave  allowing him in 
i can only  loyally  wait 
playing my role   
  to get into his heart 
he ll make me bleed
and cry in agony   
  before he s satisfied 
that s the only way
he can feel alive 
in the darkness  only he
knows this is all real 
that s enough 
that s why   
that s why i can let myself
be tortured to breaking point   
  and still continue  till i
can t take it any further 
that s enough 
every time after the final spasm   
  i think   will it be this time  
will our people rush in
and blow his brains out 
and his blood and brains
will spill all over me 
stop it 
was it mr  yee s plan to bring
me to the japanese district 
good evening 
welcome 
i m looking for mr  yee 
this way please 
pretty girl isn t she 
come here 
lieutenant colonel nakamura  
sorry 
even the girls are dumping you 
this is a customer 
not one of our girls 
keiko  go accompany colonel nakamura 
get some more sake 
my apologies 
sorry for that 
your guest is here 
i m punishing myself by
waiting for you this time 
why here 
official business 
they sound like they re crying 
the japs kill people indiscriminately  but
actually they re more afraid than anyone else 
they know that eventually  once they
start fighting with the americans   
  it ll be over  and all these actors  
  are still frivolously
singing their opera 
just listen 
i know why you asked me here 
why 
you want me to be your whore 
whore 
i brought you here to see
how good a geisha you d make 
i ll sing a song for you 
i sing better than them 
really 
  tears stain my sleeve   
  this girl has been thinking
of him all the while till now   
go back first  i still have work to do 
so late 
i have a favour to ask you 
tomorrow  bring this
letter to this address 
look for a man called hali salahuddin 
can you remember that 
hali salahuddin  
if he says something to you   
  or gives your something  tell me 
keep it a secret between the two of us 
it s a name card  only
yee s name is on it 
put it back  what do you think 
i m afraid wong chia
chi is under suspicion 
if we send some men down to scout
the area we might fall into his trap 
if wong chia chi goes alone
it ll be dangerous too 
it s best that we
keep a lookout outside 
you should go quickly 
wong chia chi  i m really sorry 
you could have done it three years ago 
why didn t you
