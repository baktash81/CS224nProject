mmm   
i was sorry to hear about your
mother s death  john  mr  smith 
i understand she was
a good woman  christian woman 
i m not a religious man myself 
i m sorry to say  but i will say this 
if god has seen fit to bless you
with this gift  you should use it 
bless me 
you know what god did for me 
he threw an
eighteen wheel truck at me 
bounced me into nowhere
for five years 
when i woke up my girl was gone 
my job was gone 
my legs are just about useless 
bless me 
god s been a real sport to me

it was your mother who always
kept the tree looking good   
i wish to god she were here now  so

but if you ask me it s the company
she wants
more than the bookcases 
i heard that 
hup  hup

well  guess i ll hit the hay 
i m gonna watch some tv 
the castle rock killer s
in the news again 
good night  son 
despite the continuing
efforts on the part of police 
the killer is still at large and is likely
to remain so for some time 
we spoke to sheriff george
bannerman outside
the castle county courthouse
earlier today 
we have no new leads at this time 
however  there is always the hope
that some citizen 
perhaps in the audience right now 
might have some information
that would be very helpful 
my line is always open 
and i would welcome any help
we can possibly get 
that s really all i have to say
at this time  thank you 
thus far  nine separate murders
have been attributed
to the castle rock killer 
dating back almost
three and a half years 
the most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape murders
was 15 year old debbie lindeman 
a sophomore
at castle rock high school 
her partially clad body was
found just one month ago today
in the rock lane boat yard 
as in the other castle rock killings 
cause of death was determined
by the coroner s office
to be multiple stab wounds 
next on news eight 
sports and weather with ron 
after this important message 
i m gonna help him 
what did you say  son 
the sheriff that came here   
bannerman 
i m going to help him 
we think the killer hid
around the corner 
just out the end of the tunnel there 
and when the poor girl came through 
the bastard was waiting for her 
tell the kids
not to come through here  dammit 
you know they like to use this
as a short cut to school 
he stood right here 
found a lot of cigarette butts  same
brand  eight or nine butts here 
this help you any 
i don t know  have you got something
he might have touched or worn 
frank  give me that package 
it s the only real evidence we have 
found it in one
of the bushes back there 
same brand as the butts
we found in the ground  here 
nothing 
i thought i might
have felt something  but i   
it s ok  it s ok 
can t say we didn t try  huh 
dispatch to sheriff bannerman 
yeah  this is bannerman

you leave my boy alone 
you knew 
didn t you 
you knew 
you   
you re a devil   
sent from hell 
frank 
hello  john 
may i come in 
how did you find me  my father 
stopped off to see him  and he
told me you moved to a new town 
he s worried about you  and so am i 
there s nothing to worry about  i m
taking care of myself  it s about time 
i m still your doctor john 
you re still under my care 
we have to stay in touch 
how s the  uh  
all healed up 
the bullet went right through me 
it s nothing 
good  nice place you have here 
it s home 
those headaches are getting worse 
aren t they 
three or four times a day sometimes 
i brought you some new medication 
no  no more pills 
takes time to recover  the healing
process is slow  i told you many times 
i m not getting better 
i m getting worse  isn t that right 
alright 
now listen  in the last few
months i ve done some research
into the area
of psychic phenomena 
several cases such as yours
have been documented  
i was surprised to discover 
and the pattern is always the same 
as the spells  the visions grow stronger
and more powerful 
so the body weakens 
but i don t need any research
or documentation
to see that this thing is sucking
the life out of you 
one look at you can tell me that 
you mean i m gonna die  how long 
i think we can arrest the process 
reverse it even 
how do you do that 
come back with me 
where 
to the clinic of course 
no  absolutely no 
john please  you must 
why  so you can study me 
no  so i can protect you  you need to
be in a controlled environment  john 
i wanna show you something 
come with me 
the cards and letters
just keep pouring in 
what is all this 
it s people  lost dogs 
lost children  lost lives 
you haven t opened them 
i don t have to  they all want the same
thing  reassurance  help  love 
things i can t give them  my father
sends this stuff onto me  i let it pile up 
why  why do you keep it 
this is why
i can t go on  live my life 
why i have to stay
locked up here in the house 
i m already living in a controlled
environment  sam 
nothing can touch me here 
i m alone 
i m safe 
 but instead of dying 
she shall only fall into   
a profound sleep
which shall last a hundred years  
that s my mom 
ok 
  bye 
  bye

 prophet   said i   thing of evil 
prophet still  if bird or devil 
by that heaven
that bends above us
by that god we both adore
tell this soul with sorrow laden
if  within the distant aidenn 
it shall clasp a sainted maiden
whom the angels named lenore

about  will i ever see her again  
 eagerly i wished the morrow
vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow 
sorrow for the lost lenore 
for the rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore

if you could go back in time  germany 
say before hitler came to power 
knowing what you know now  what
would you do  would you kill him 
is that why you sent for me  john 
to ask me this question 
i have to talk to you  sam 
because i ve had another episode 
ah  yes  go on 
i ve been tutoring this boy 
his name is stuart
and in the vision  i saw him drown 
i saw him die  sam 
but that s not the point 
in the vision  there was something
missing  something i couldn t see 
how do you mean 
i don t know  it was like
a blank spot    a dead zone 
er  first of all tell me  did the boy in fact
drown  you say you saw him drown 
no  no  his father wanted to take him to
play hockey  i talked him out of it 
the boy s alive 
ah  yes  don t you see 
don t you see how clear it all is 
not only can you see the future   
  you can   
  i can change it 
you can change it 
exactly  ha  here 
yes john  that is your dead zone 
the possibility of altering
the outcome of your premonitions 
it s fascinating 
let me make a note 
what about my question  sam 
huh  oh  you mean
the one about hitler 
what would you do 
i don t like the sound of this  john 
what are your getting at 
what would you do 
would you kill him 
alright  alright 
i ll give you an answer 
i m a man of medicine 
i m expected to save lives
and ease suffering 
and i love people  therefore  i d have
no choice but to kill the son of a bitch 
you d never get away alive 
it doesn t matter  i would kill him 
nosdrovia  skol 
dear sarah 
this is a hard letter to write 
so i ll try and make it short 
i can t go on hiding anymore 
that s what i ve been doing 
running and hiding  you know
i ve had this figured out all wrong 
i always thought this power
of mine was a curse 
now i can see it s a gift  anyway 
by the time you get this letter 
it ll all be over  you never will
understand why  sarah 
guess nobody ever will 
but i know what i m doing 
and i know i m right 
just remember there s never
been anyone for me except you 
just wasn t in the cards
for us i guess 
i ll always love you 
sarah  johnny
