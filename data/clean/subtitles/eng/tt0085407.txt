ill just say goodnight
joan of arc
but his wife said before today
well guess ill hit the hay
im gonna watch some tv
the castle rock killers
in the news again
good night son
despite the continuing
efforts on the part of police
the killer is still at large and is likely
to remain so for some time
we spoke to sheriff george
bannerman outside
the castle county courthouse
earlier today
we have no new leads at this time
however there is always the hope
that some citizen
perhaps in the audience right now
might have some information
that would be very helpful
my line is always open
and i would welcome any help
we can possibly get
thats really all i have to say
at this time thank you
thus far nine separate murders
have been attributed
to the castle rock killer
dating back almost
three and a half years
the most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape murders
was 15 year old debbie lindeman
a sophomore
at castle rock high school
her partially clad body was
found just one month ago today
in the rock lane boat yard
as in the other castle rock killings
cause of death was determined
by the coroners office
to be multiple stab wounds
next on news eight
sports and weather with ron
after this important message
im gonna help him
what did you say son
the sheriff that came here
bannerman
im going to help him
we think the killer hid
around the corner
just out the end of the tunnel there
and when the poor girl came through
the bastard was waiting for her
tell the kids
not to come through here dammit
you know they like to use this
as a short cut to school
he stood right here
found a lot of cigarette butts same
brand eight or nine butts here
this help you any
i dont know have you got something
he might have touched or worn
frank give me that package
its the only real evidence we have
found it in one
of the bushes back there
same brand as the butts
we found in the ground here
nothing
i thought i might
have felt something but i
its ok its ok
cant say we didnt try huh
dispatch to sheriff bannerman
yeah this is bannerman
we got another body here sheriff

sent from hell
frank
hello john
may i come in
how did you find me my father
stopped off to see him and he
told me you moved to a new town
hes worried about you and so am i
theres nothing to worry about im
taking care of myself its about time
im still your doctor john
youre still under my care
we have to stay in touch
hows the uh
all healed up
the bullet went right through me
its nothing
good nice place you have here
its home
those headaches are getting worse
arent they
three or four times a day sometimes
i brought you some new medication
no no more pills
takes time to recover the healing
process is slow i told you many times
im not getting better
im getting worse isnt that right
alright
now listen in the last few
months ive done some research
into the area
of psychic phenomena
several cases such as yours
have been documented
i was surprised to discover
and the pattern is always the same
as the spells the visions grow stronger
and more powerful
so the body weakens
but i dont need any research
or documentation
to see that this thing is sucking
the life out of you
one look at you can tell me that
you mean im gonna die how long
i think we can arrest the process
reverse it even
how do you do that
come back with me
where
to the clinic of course
no absolutely no
john please you must
why so you can study me
no so i can protect you you need to
be in a controlled environment john
i wanna show you something
come with me
the cards and letters
just keep pouring in
what is all this
its people lost dogs
lost children lost lives
you havent opened them
i dont have to they all want the same
thing reassurance help love
things i cant give them my father
sends this stuff onto me i let it pile up
why why do you keep it
this is why
i cant go on live my life
why i have to stay
locked up here in the house
im already living in a controlled
environment sam
nothing can touch me here
im alone
im safe
but instead of dying
she shall only fall into
a profound sleep
which shall last a hundred years
thats my mom
ok
bye
bye
