gentlemen

next question 
hey  coach 
coach  let me ask you something 
how do you ever expect
to replace jimmy brown 
glen boyd  cedar rapids
high  team won state 
he has a c average
but a tested iq of 120 
that means he s lazy 
ben  the kid has
a five yard average 
i don t care 
he s lazy  i don t want him 
next 
  wally purdue 
bridgeport academy 
six varsity letters 
he s healing from
an ankle fracture but   
but bullshit

who isn t hurt or lazy 
isn t there
a kid from elmira 
yeah  ernie davis 
elmira free academy 
running back  1 300
yards on 179 carries 
led his team to a state championship 
why the hell didn t we look at him first 
well  he s a
negro boy  ben 
is this a new trend 
or is it just my luck 
it s a new trend 
he might remind you
of somebody we know 
too old to butt heads
with another jim brown 
roll it 
there he is
on the left  number 55 
right now  he s   
now watch him here 
he breaks through both tackles and
look at that  into the secondary 
there he goes 
30 yard line 
40 yard line  50 
40  30  20  10 
touchdown  wow

all right  look  there s this kid 
and i want you to help me recruit him 
you want me to help you 
you re leaving us a
hell of a hole  jim 
and we are up against the big boys 
we ve got pitt  ucla  texas 
you mean he s colored 
he s a negro  yes 
you can t talk to negroes 
i can t   
i m not good at that salesman stuff 
not much of a dancer  you know that 
i know this wasn t the most welcoming
place for you  but that s not my fault 
i can only control what happens
on 100 yards of gridiron 
but i do know cleveland never
would have heard of you
if you hadn t come
here to play for me 
what i did here was on
my back and my sweat 
what good would
your time be here
if you re not willing to help
the next kid get his chance 
a kid like you 
he s got talent  jim 
maybe even your
kind of talent 
didn t mention anything in your
telegram about bringing jim brown 
i hope you don t mind signing
a couple hundred autographs 
ha  jim loves to sign
autographs  don t you 
you know  jim  i m a
syracuse man myself 
class of  31 
you don t say 
is that bill clark
from notre dame 
yeah

yeah  not enough he steals ramsey
right out from under my nose 
that s your man
right there  ernie davis 
11 varsity letters 
plays baseball  too 
in fact  there s not
a sport he doesn t play 
try it one more time 
let s see what he does 
he s too fast
for these kids 
he s too fast
for anybody 
ben schwartzwalder 
head coach  syracuse university orangemen 
pleasure to
meet you  sir 
pleasure to
meet you  son 
do you know
why i m here 
same reason as
notre dame  sir 
yeah  same reason 
but don t just take my
word for it  jim  jim 
i ll be right back 
  thank you 
there s another fan
who d like to tell you
how much he d like to
see you come play for us 
jim   
  brown 
2 091 rushing yards 
5 8 yards of carry 
132 yards and three
touchdowns in the cotton bowl 
we lost the cotton bowl 
but that sweep where you
cut back to the middle 
my mama and me watched that game on
a television set in sears and roebuck 
she s a big fan
of yours  too 
oh 
is she 
mr  brown 
i hope you like caramel cake 
i do  thank you 
here you go 
i understand you re from
pennsylvania  mr  davis 
what brings you up
here to new york 
i asked him to come 
to help me make up my mind 
that s good to have
family like that 
you close to your family 
mr  schwartzwalder 
i have a wife
and two daughters 
and they never ask my
opinion about anything 
seems to work 
mr  brown 
yes  sir 
were you the first in your
family to go to college 
yes  sir  i was 
and what s it like at
syracuse for men like us 
it s great 
it s good 
i suppose i d say it s not that
different than a lot of places 
this cake is delicious 
i want you to go out  keep going 
back  back  all right 
mr  brown  i m not
real big on lacrosse 
jim 
  jim 
okay  let s see
what you ve got 
it s not as easy
as it looks  is it 
i m all right 
you see  lacrosse
isn t just a sport 
the indians used it to settle
their conflicts and heal the sick 
they also played it as
a preparation for war 
make no mistake  there s
a war in this country 
but for men like us  it s
not on the football field 
so if all you nice folks
are offering the same thing 
what makes you different 
well  syracuse   
not syracuse  you 
i m not sure i follow
you  mr  davis 
my grandson might be spending the
next four years listening to you 
learning from you 
so  i suppose what i m
asking  mr  schwartzwalder 
is what kind
of man are you 
i just want to be the best
player i can be  you know 
i want to be
like you  jim brown 
first team all american
then straight to the nfl 
and i need you to tell me exactly
where i gotta be to get there 
look  if you go to syracuse 
it s not gonna be easy for you 
but schwartzwalder  he s one of
the best coaches in college ball 
now you re fast 
but he ll make you faster 
you run hard  he ll show
you how to run harder 
and you re good 
but he ll make you better 
and if you ever
tell him i said that 
i ll jump on the first plane from
cleveland and come and wring your neck 
now let s get out of here 
let me tell you something about jim
and i  we had our differences at times 
so whatever he told you about me  i
would take it with a grain of salt 
even if he said you
were a good coach 
well  in that case  son  i would tell
you that too much salt is bad for you 
ernie  ernie davis 
how d you guess 
welcome 
i m lew andreas  the
athletic director  come on 
i ll give you a tour of the
campus on the way to your dorm 
all right 
  syracuse has a storied
academic tradition  ernie

steven crane attended
the university in 1891
and wrote the red badge of courage   
  hey  lew 
harry  sorry  i ll be
right back  right back 
harry 
  how are you 
no one from here has ever won 
if that s what you re looking for

what are you smiling at 
this fine institution is
giving you three hots and a cot 
i do not intend to let
them waste their money 
get them up  come on 
right about now 
i bet you re wondering
what happened to that nice
gentleman that visited your house
and begged you
to come here  huh 
let s go  now make
no mistake  gentlemen 
no matter what anyone else tells you 
you are not here to just play football 
you are offside 
you are here at
syracuse to win games 
and you can t win games if you
can t out perform the other team 
don t you step on
my all americans 
if you step on my all americans 
i will reach down your throat 
grab your donuts and
tie them to your tonsils 
good hit 
take him down 
so  you re the
next jim brown  huh 
yeah  i can see
the resemblance 
yeah  except brown was
always mad about something

maury youmans  center 
i ll be keeping your
jersey clean next year 
he embarrassed you 
embarrassed you 
i want you to move davis
from freshman to varsity 
but he won t be eligible
to play in any games  ben 
why don t we just let him catch
his stride with the other freshmen 
first  when he does
become eligible next year 
i want him to hit
the ground running 
second  he s gonna
raise everybody s game 
he ll probably be the best
running back they face all year

the way i want it done 
jack buckley  right tackle 
sophomore  call me jb

wanted to see me 
he s in his office 
knock 
you wanted to
see me  coach 
mmm hmm 
davis  my system
is simple 
conditioning 
teamwork 
and on my team  i expect every
player to know his job 
know his place on the field 
quarterback  running back  lineman 
that way  nobody
steps on anybody s toes 
same holds true
off the field 
i m not sure how
you mean  coach 
well   
there are some lines that some
people don t care to see crossed 
just like there are some toes
that shouldn t be stepped on 
and i expect my players
not to cross those lines 
now  you must have a
girlfriend back home  right 
good looking
fellow like you 
you might want to
keep in touch with her 
you re a smart kid  davis 
i don t have to spell it out for you  do i 
anything else  coach

wait  but what did he do 
did he kill somebody 
worse  he dated
a white girl 
majorette  blonde 
schwartzwalder wouldn t even give jim

but we can no longer
willfully close our eyes
and pretend that we cannot see
that he sees us as beneath him 
yes 
  no  we cannot 
and we can no longer stay silent
when he tells us that we cannot speak 
yes 
  that s right 
abraham lincoln stood
in a field at gettysburg 
and spoke of a new nation 
  that s right 
uniontown is 100 miles away
from his gettysburg 
we are still
yet to be equal 
that is why the naacp is calling for
a nationwide boycott of woolworths 
that s right 
that s right 
all right 
come on 
boycott  boycott 
boycott  boycott  boycott  boycott 
come to washington
with us 
there s a bus going
down from the church 
we gonna organize
with martin luther king
and let the people know this
country has got to change 
i don t think i can be a part of
what you want me to be a part of
right now  will 
all this 
what you saying 
i got a scholarship 
i can t risk losing it  and
i don t wanna invite trouble 
i see  did emmett till invite trouble 
did rosa parks 
who told you this 
your coach 
you don t understand 
it s a different
world up there 
is it 
you know  your coach
sound a lot like pops 
no understanding whatsoever with
the troubles in this country 
 you boys got no business north
of union street  you hear me  
now  leave pops
out of this  will 
now you got a white man telling
you what you can and can t do 
wait a minute  hold on 
watch how you talk to me 
that man don t care
nothing about you  ernie 
you re not there 
you don t know him 
you just his educated nigger 
you don t know what you re talking about 
  tom can toe the line
and carry the ball  but that man
will turn on you  just you wait 
you don t think i m reminded
every minute of who i am at school 
everybody there is watching me  and
waiting for me to make a mistake 
you ernie davis 
you got your
name in the paper 
now that s something for colored folk
around here to open up a newspaper  ernie 
and see your name 
your face 
and say   i know him 
i went to school with him  
they gonna be
looking up to you 
i think you owe them more
than just running a ball 
the play action
pass was there all day 
it won t be
there the next time 
why not 
 cause boston college is watching
the same damn game that we are 
all right  we start out double
tight  tight in here  tight in there 
just a normal
double tight 
just like from the
beginning of time  simmy 
now  we re gonna take schwedes
out of the wing position 
and we re gonna move him
into a three back formation 
only shift it over like this 
all right  defense  what
do you do when you see this 
now the defense 
they have to shift 
we move to the right 
that s right  even if it s shading
from nose up to opposite shoulder 
our right tackle 
he goes on the left side 
i m gonna leave the huddle 
and you re gonna start out
right  just like normal 
go left  go left 
except before we re set 
you re gonna run left 
he runs left 
and you re gonna line
up on the left side 
and he sets up
on the left side 
and it s evident that
boston college is confused
by the offense
syracuse is running 
you lost me  ben 
the right tackle moves to the left 
he covers the tight end 
but if he s on the left side  we cover
the tight end  i can t pass to him 
the holy cross defenders are
desperately trying to position themselves
to best play against
this formation 
petey  am i talking
french here 
tackle lines up inside
the tight end  does he not 
it s unbalanced  right 
do we shift again  coach 
yes  they shift 
they all shift 
they have to shift 
they must shift 
shift  shift  shift 
all right  so you ve got
everybody and their dog
shifted over to
the left  now what 
we are going to run it   
we are going to run it   
   to the right 
   to the right 
  to the right  coach 
but that s away
from our strength 
the weak side of the field 
so  we re going to
run to the weak side 
i like the way that
you think  mr  davis 
gentlemen  when you have a thoroughbred 
you do not lock him in the barn 
hut 
i will take one on one
out here all day long 
that just might
work  coach 
damn right 
 ernie davis is a bull necked 
steel shouldered running back
 from syracuse university  who
can run a football field s length
 in 10 seconds flat  
  10 seconds 
okay  put that
away now  please 
don t you be modest 
thank you 
  be proud  ernie 
you re in the same
magazine as reverend king 
that s something 
  yeah 
that is something  but sarah  it looks
like you didn t read the best part 
 in his spare time  the bull necked
ernie davis enjoys sewing 
 baking lasagna  and writing
songs for his church choir  
ernie  you never invite me to church 
  very funny  very funny 
i m hurt  what is that 
  ernie  ernie 
can i have a word
with you  please 
make me some lasagna 
he can take it 
good to see you 
  that s mr  andreas 
just turn left there 
 he maketh me to
lie down in green pastures 
 he leadeth me
beside the still waters 
 he restoreth my soul 
 he leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name s sake 
 yea  though i walk through the
valley of the shadow of death 
 i will fear no evil 
for thou art with me 
 thy rod and thy staff    
40 years  pops worked underground 
seems wrong to put him
right back in there 
and the drive deep into
left field  and it s a home run 
 and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain  
 his grace
which was bestowed    
     upon me
was not in vain  
pops 
now  we barely got by west virginia
when we played them here last year 
and they ve been licking their
chops waiting for us ever since 
they play by a
different set of rules 
it will be hostile 
their fans are unruly 
especially when they re
playing against a team that
looks a little
different than they do

and with a stiff arm  gets free
into west virginia territory 
shit  he s going in

goal line down here without you

listen up  boys 
all right  listen up 
listen up 
coach 
gentlemen 
congratulations 
undefeated with a number one
ranking is something to be proud of 
yeah 
but   
but   
mr  andreas
has informed me
that we have been offered
two different bowl games 
the orange bowl in miami
and the cotton
bowl in dallas 
now  in miami  we would play
georgia  ranked ninth in the polls 
and in dallas  we would play texas 
ranked second  right behind us 
if we win either game  we
will be the national champions 
texas is the tougher
opponent  the tougher team 
but to be the best  i believe
you have to beat the best 
so  i guess you know how i would
vote  but this is your vote 
this is your team 
your decision 
texas 
texas 
texas 
texas 
texas 
  texas 
texas 
  texas 
texas 
texas 
texas 
texas 
looking forward to it 
  texas 
texas 
  texas 
texas 
  texas 
texas 
a lot of people think
the texas longhorns
are the best team
in the nation 
one big reason is clay taylor 
all american  best division
one tackle in the nation
three years in a row 
now  some folks even think that the
only reason that we are undefeated
is because we have not met
clay taylor and his teammates 
i want everyone to take a good long
look at what we re up against here
because in texas 
football is a religion 
you think we been south 
we ain t been south
till we go to texas 
schwedes 
give me a goose step 
we are now faced
with a far different problem 
the forcible integration of the
public schools of little rock
against the overwhelming sentiment
of the people of the area 
two  four  six  eight 
we don t want to integrate 
two  four  six  eight 
we don t want to integrate 
we still have
the attitude of love 
we still have the method
of passive resistance
and we are still
insisting emphatically 
that violence is
self defeating 
that he who lives by the
sword will perish by the sword 
this is quite a ruckus 
hey  ernie 
roger page  channel nine 
they re calling this game
the north against the south 
in light of what s
going on in this country 
do you feel added pressure
to represent change 
we don t concern
ourselves with politics 
we re just here to
play a great football game
and take home
the championship 
to be honest  mr  page 
when i m out on that field 
i only think about
winning the game 
but that doesn t mean i don t
know the color of my own skin 
let s check in 
we ve got a problem  ben 
what 
the aristocrat hotel does not
allow coloreds to stay here 
i need my team together  lew 
now  you do whatever it takes
to make that happen 
what s the problem 
what s the problem here 
right this way  gentlemen 
fellas  looks like we once
again found the negro wing 
state seven 
state seven 
set 
  double tight  double tight 
wing left 
watch it 
stop 
do you think it is
the new york city ballet
that s going to be running
up your ass on new year s day 
these are the goddamn
texas longhorns 
if you cannot fight off
blocks better than that 
let s just get on
the bus and go home 
run the play again 
shit 
my hamstring 
this may be
a blessing in disguise 
look at these 
where did you get these 
where did i get them 
they were sent to the
hotel to your boys 
scare tactics 
doesn t have a goddamn
thing to do with football 
we shouldn t play him 
maybe not even art or jack
but especially ernie 
the ncaa is on my back 
even the mayor of dallas is
nervous  afraid of race riots 
lew  you hired me to win 
well  i m here at
the goddamn cotton bowl 
and this time
we re gonna win it 
so why don t you tell that
to the mayor of dallas 
i m playing  you hear me 
i m playing 
you re goddamn right you are 
there s an electricity
in the air today in dallas 
and  as you can see from
the clear skies behind me 
it s not
a local thunderstorm 
all eyes are on the field
as undefeated syracuse 
the beast from the east 
takes on texas  the power
of the southwest conference 
do i need to say anything 
come on  it s on 
come on  it s on  the
cotton bowl  come on  marie 
come on  come on  come on 
all right  all right 
get two ice teas 
please 
and the cotton bowl 
drop your heads 
our father 
who art in heaven 
hallowed be thy name 
thy kingdom come 
thy will be done   
george 
fancy seeing you here 
you taking a look at davis 
i ve seen him 
really 
in a redskins uniform 
i think he d look better
in a cleveland uniform 
now  wouldn t that
be something 
ladies and gentlemen 
please give a warm texas welcome
to the syracuse
university orangemen 
with a phenomenal record
of 10 0 
ben schwartzwalder and his
mighty orangemen of syracuse 
ranked number 1
in the nation 
take the field here at the
historic cotton bowl in dallas
to face darrell royal
and the second ranked
longhorns of texas 
you ready for this 
i m ready 
get off the field 
if the orangemen are going to
be successful moving the football today 
they re going to have to go
through clay taylor and pete logan 
two very dominant
football players
and the defensive leaders
for the longhorns 
davis  hamstring 
tails 
syracuse receives 
that s what we wanted 
go  boy 
  get them 
ernie  if you get the ball 
go all the way 
let s go let s go 
  let s go  four four 
and the 1960
cotton bowl is underway 
offense  let s go 
an incredibly
enthusiastic crowd on hand
as syracuse lines up
for its first series 
i ve been waiting
for this nigger 
okie  okie  set 
i m about to kick your black
ass back to africa  boy 
oh  yeah 
too bad i m from philly 
the give
is to ernie davis 
he gains two yards and is brought
down quickly by taylor and logan 
we re in the cotton
bowl  not the cotton patch  boys 
personal foul  ref 
  84 
84  ref 
the handkerchief
on the field 
there appears to be some late
contact by both taylor and logan 
holding  offense 
that s bullshit 
  will 
but there  did you see that 
  i saw it 
you don t stop this quick 
it s gonna get out of hand 
that s one 
you ve been warned 
 i ve been warned  
what are you  my first grade teacher 
sophomore davis is
clearly favoring his right leg
as he moves back to
the orangemen huddle 
okay  on one 
on one  ready 
the orangemen
facing first and 20 
it s to davis 
runs to his left 
looks to throw 
now cuts back to the right
with a dazzling spin move 
and sheds the tackler 
he turns the corner 
he s in the clear  he s gone 
quick  go  go  go  go 
go 
he s drilled out of
bounds at the 3 yard line 
and now davis  who s lying
prone on the sidelines 
appears to be
either exhausted or hurt 
i can t believe
they caught him 
ernie  get up 
ernie  ernie 
ernie  you all right 
davis is finally
helped to his feet
by all american
tackler jack buckley 
one has to wonder
just what kind of shape ernie davis is in 
  i told you 
syracuse  first down
at the longhorn three 
the give is to the right
halfback  gerhard schwedes 
outstanding block by davis 
he crosses the goal line
to put syracuse on the board 
here in the second quarter
coach ben schwartzwalder and his
top ranked team find themselves
on top of
the texas longhorns  7 0 
ready 
  break 
the orangemen are knocking
on the door once again 
state seven 
state seven 
set  hut one 
the give is to ernie davis and
the sophomore finds the end zone 
as the orangemen increase
their lead on the longhorns 
so precisely when is it
you re going to
start kicking my
black ass back to africa 
hey  buckley 
hey  come on  stay cool 
they re baiting us 
  they re baiting them 
hey  logan  taylor 
44 is embarrassing you 
and after a successful
two point conversion
the orangemen of syracuse
lead the longhorns of texas
by a score of 15 0 
mckinley on
a sweep to the right 
bobby lundy steps up and
there s a huge hit on mckinley 
and the ball is loose 
recovered by the orangemen
and syracuse takes over 
yeah 
my 
that s a cheap shot 
a late hit by talbert
on ernie davis
after the play
was whistled dead 
back  everybody 
back  back  back  back 
you all right  son

i m all right  coach

and once again 
ernie davis is pummeled 
break it up  ref 
come on  ref

and both teams
are clearing their benches
and heading to
the middle of the field 
ref  i told you to
do something about this 
this has become a fiasco

my god  no

we re up by 15 
we can take it from here 
coach  i can still get
back out there and play 
no  i want you to
put some ice on that leg 
i had a halftime speech
all planned out 
it seemed pretty good
up till about 10 minutes ago 
it was all about victory
and champions and glory 
but this is not
just a game anymore 
we re fighting something else
out on that field right now 
and i can see it
just as clearly as you 
and that s why
winning this one
means nothing
if you lose yourselves 
don t give this one away 
keep it  hold on to it
for yourselves
and for everyone
in this room 
it s here  it s right here 
and no one can
take it from you  gentlemen 
not the officials 
not the crowds
and certainly
not the other team 
it belongs to you  gentlemen 
don t you let anyone
steal history away from you

mr  davis  tom martin 
saturday evening post 
i saw you play in the
cotton bowl two years ago 
okay 
i m wondering if you d like
to write an article for us 
you want me to
write an article 
i don t know whether
you know this 
but you re an inspiration
to a lot of our readers 
there he is 
number 77 
he s as good as me 
maybe better 
hey  ernie 
ernie  this is floyd little 
floyd  this is   
ernie davis 
2 386 yards 
360 carries 
6 6 yards a carry 
you good at math  huh 
you see  my plan
is to be just like you 
best negro running
back in the ncaa 
heisman trophy
all the way 
then the nfl 
make some money 
you got it all
figured out  don t you 
what kind of bottle
do you think this is 
don t know 
don t have a label 
right 
it could be a soda bottle 
it could be a beer bottle 
it could be anything 
no label 
you see  i never set out to be
the best negro running back 
i just wanted to be
the best running back 
the best football player
i could be  period 
look  now i m   
floyd  i m never gonna
play for cleveland 
or any other team 
my playing days are over 
so don t you look at that poster
of me on your wall and tell me
you want to be like me 
because that isn t enough 
you re gonna have to
do better than that 
you think you can 
yes  sir 
good 
but the thing is  i told notre
dame i would sign with them 
floyd  you know how notre
dame loves their passing game 
my fear is a talented
runner like yourself
may get stuck polishing that
notre dame bench with your butt 
you don t want that 
i want to know something 
coach 
what the hell did you
say to floyd little 
why  what happened 
well  i ll be damned 
he backed out on notre dame 
he s coming to syracuse 
well  let s see  i told him
you like your runners lazy 
and you like players
who backtalk 
mmm hmm 
anything else 
i told him you
were a good coach 
i m not gonna
lie to him  ernie 
because i know how hard
it s gonna be for him 
and i promise 
if he works hard 
he can run for that end zone whether
he s in boston or mississippi 
and i won t tell him that
he s the next ernie davis 
because there won t
be another ernie davis 
can you believe they suited me up
to run on the field and take a bow 
i ll be right
here with you  son 
please
welcome to the field 
number 45  from syracuse
at halfback  ernie davis 
mr  martin  in the end
it turns out you did me a favor
when you asked me to
write this for the post 
you see  yesterday
was my 23rd birthday 
and compared to some  that doesn t seem
like a whole lot of life to talk about 
thing is  i don t know how
much more is in front of me 
and as you see from the number
of pages  if you ve read this far 
i did have a few things to say 
and i m not sure how to end this
or even if i want to 
it s funny  most people think my
life has been all about football 
i ve even thought
that myself 
but football is just a game 
what matters is
what you play for 
sometimes  when the game is close
and everything is on the line 
that s when you forget
the crowd and the noise 
that s when it s just you against
somebody else to see who is the better man 
that s what i like about the game
