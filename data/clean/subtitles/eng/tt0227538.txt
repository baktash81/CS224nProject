hxhprc  enjoy your hours 
carmen  juni  time for bed 
  did you brush your teeth 
  i already did 
  juni  don t forget to brush  
  i am  i am 
all right  all right 
juni  ok  warts  uhh 
prepare to meet your maker 
everything ok at school 
yeah  it s good  it s fine 
ok  well  lights out 
bedtime story first 
what story do you want to hear 
 the two spies
who fell in love  
hmm  wow 
i haven t told that one
in a while 
you probably remember that
better than i do 
  want to hear a story  juni 
  i m listening 
ok 
once upon a time   
there was a man and a woman 
  and they were both spies 
  yes 
she from one country 
he from another 
she had a very important mission
assigned to her 
  he was her mission 
  correct 
her mission was to take him out 
carmen  on a date 
no  uh  take him  
oh  you mean   
i shouldn t be telling you this 
  go on  go on 
  you have to understand   
these were
dark and confusing times 
an enormous amount of turmoil
between countries 
ingrid  out off ear   
a new kind of soldier
was created  
brilliant  brave soldiers   
whose greatest weapons
were their minds 
those men and women were spies 
they were masters of disguise 
they could sense danger
a mile away   
and through their work   
wars were ended
before they even started 
 electronic beeping 
the only things spies
were truly afraid of   
were other spies  
enemy spies 
so  sometimes 
one spy s mission   
was to make
the enemy disappear 
he was the assignment
that changed her life   
but when the moment
finally came   
to carry out her mission   
she couldn t do it 
he was different
than she expected 
sure  he was charming
and intelligent   
but he was
unexpectedly honorable   
and it made her realize   
how years of working
with detached emotion   
had taken its toll 
so they kept contact   
through lunch dates  
very discreet 
after all 
they were on different sides   
so they could never
be seen together 
dinner dates followed   
wherever their mutual
travels took them 
and they fell in love   
and they decided
that  together   
they would embark   
on the most dangerous mission
of all time 
carmen  what 
ingrid  they decided to marry 
carmen  wow 
ingrid  oh  yes 
on her wedding day   
she felt like
she would rather brave   
a thousand deadly missions   
than go through with what
she was about to attempt 
carmen  why is that 
well  marriage is a mission
so complex   
that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply 
there s such an amazing
series of obstacles   
one has to navigate
to keep a marriage together  
much less family  
that it frightened even her   
a hardened
and experienced secret agent 
but when she saw him   
standing there
with no doubt whatsoever   
so assured of his decision   
so enamored with what
they were about to do   
she took his hand   
looked deep into his eyes   
and said
the two most dangerous   
most trusting words
you can say to anyone 
carmen  what 
ingrid  she said   i do   
carmen  oh  that s so cool 
yeah 
then the problems started 
 plane engine roars 
ingrid  now  there was
always some faction   
that wanted at least
one of them gone 
on their own 
each agent was notorious   
but together 
they made tempting targets 
 no audio 
so  they retired   
settled down   
had a few kids 
in a way  they exchanged   
one life of adventure
for another   
trading espionage
for parenthood  
a mysterious and compelling
mission in its own right 
and they re better off 
the end 
no  happily ever after  
i said they were better off 
great story  mom 
but it needs a new ending 
it needs monsters 
ingrid  is that right 
do you want me to look at your  
i put the medicine on 
ok  munchkin  good night 
what was the story tonight 
mmm  ours 
how many nights  i wonder   
do you send the children
off to bed with nightmares 
carmen asked for the story 
that life is over now 
we are consultants  not spies 
 electronic beeping 
ingrid  so i went
to their school today 
mm hmm 
had that meeting
with the principal 
hmm 
carmen s been skipping school
twice a month 
  why 
  i don t know 
and those school friends
juni talks about having 
yeah 
diego somebody and renaldo 
no such beasts 
ingrid  it turns out 
the other kids pick on him 
he has no friends 
it doesn t help that he has
his head in the clouds   
making these weird drawings   
and burying himself
into that demented kids show 
 beep 
they re keeping secrets
from us  gregorio   
and i think it s our fault 
they ve gotten this from us 
we have good reason
to keep secrets 
if we told them we were spies   
they d have visions of danger
every time we leave the house 
speaking of secrets   
what are you working on
over here 
oh  nothing important 
it s just   
juni  why do we have
to do this every morning 
we already have p e  at school

i wish i could go away
to your world  floop 
you d be my friend 
mr  lisp  i thank you all   
for attending
today s demonstration 
year after year   
we pay outrageous sums of money
to several inventors   
to come up
with our technologies 
mr  floop is one such visionary 
however  his inventions
are somewhat questionable   
and  therefore 
need to be evaluated 
you promised us an army 
mr  floop   
but our first billion dollars
bought us only this  
mutated secret agents 
the mutative process
and brain wipe   
caused their minds
to turn to mush 
i have found little use for them
except as novelties on my  
well  my children s show 
currently rated number two 
number two 
what the devil
are these finger men 
oh  they re called thumb thumbs 
very capable robots 
all thumbs  useless 
floop  mr  lisp 
i think you ll enjoy this 
through that door 
an awesome power will emerge 
you will have but a moment
to disarm it 
in exactly ten seconds 
seven   
five   
three   
floop  one 
 creaking 
johnny 
uhh  
 lisp groaning 
  you hesitated 
  i had to  he s my son 
are you sure 
floop 
actually  i designed him 
i built him  
his name is   
x 5 2 4 9 5  the second 
this is your big idea 
robot kids
that look like my children 
the president s daughter 
an almost exact replica 
sometimes in order
to think big   
you have to think small 
floop  through
physio electrical imaging   
i can make them
look like anyone   
yet the cunning
and intelligence   
of the world s greatest
espionage agents   
all rolled into tiny packages
i call  spy kids  
tell me  spy kids   
with your vast
stores of knowledge   
what are four of the five
physiological indications   
that a human being is lying 
 speaking in robot language 
they re not quite finished 
missing one crucial element 
missing what 
their brains 
these buckets of bolts
will never pass as children  
we have a schedule to keep 
floop  
a window of opportunity
that s closing fast 
we will be back in two days
to pick up our army   
or we ll take whatever
you do have  cut our losses   
and lay your entire
silly empire to waste 
no more time 
escort mr  lisp

i can t even figure out
where the coordinates point to 
who makes this 
 machete products  
what are you doing  
that s our bargaining chip
on getting mom and dad back 
this is what floop wants 
i think mom and dad
would want this destroyed 
how do you know what they want 
until this morning  you didn t
even know who they were 
we keep the brain 
for now 
why are you still wearing that 
that could be a tracer 
they could be tracking us 
don t start
pointing fingers at me 
i didn t do anything stupid 
stupid 
you better stop
calling me names 
or what 
or i m gonna call you names 
the booger was right 
i hate that 
 gears clicking 
thought i ditched you 
why are you dressed like a geek 
we re no longer relatives 
go away 
 speaking gibberish 
you re just getting stupider
by the minute 
juni  get away from me 
hey  put me down  
 motors whirring 
always wanted to do this 
ohh   tough guy  huh 
juni 
put me down  
carmen  destroy the brain  
destroy it 
 gears pulsing 
aah  
o
ohh 
 juni moaning 
 kids shouting 
they took the brain 
yeah  but i took her necklace 
  she didn t even notice 
  they weren t very smart 
yours couldn t even speak 
 limited edition  spy kid 
 one of five hundred    
floop could have hundreds
of these flying around 
the third brain
makes them smart 
they re building an army 
we ve got to save mom and dad 
only they can stop the robots 
but who s gonna help us 
we had it working 
a synthetic intelligence
as smart as any spy 
why don t you go ahead
and tighten that brain up 
gregorio 
the third brain system 
the oss director realized
it was too dangerous   
if the wrong forces
found the technology 
we were ordered to destroy it 
why keep that a secret from me 
to protect us from something
you destroyed 
or something you didn t 
 clears throat 
all these secrets from me 
from the children 
it has to stop 
i m sorry 
he wants the brain 
if we save our children 
we risk the world 
so what in the world do we do 
thanks for taking us
this far  but   
this is all we got 
 tires screeching 
what are we doing here 
carmen  dad s code name
must be hombre 
so  this must be machete 
we re getting help
from dad s best man 
what are you working on 
world s smallest camera 
i don t see it 
ah  but it sees you 
you sell counterintelligence
stuff here 
  come back with your parents

carmen elizabeth juanita
costa brava cortez 
 beeping and dinging 
gregorio cortez is our father 
juni  you were at his wedding 
you will turn around 
you will leave my shop 
because i never want to hear
my brother s name again 
you re our uncle 
our real uncle   cause
we already got a fake uncle 
gregorio cortez
is my younger brother 
minion 
president s daughter 
president s son 
oh  good 
prime minister s son 
general s daughter 
they re all here as planned 
i have to get back
to my show now 
you must focus
on the task at hand 
we have to prepare the army
before mr  lisp arrives 
i don t believe
in this anymore  minion 
floop 
i don t think i ever did 
explain 
the mutated agents 
the robot kids 
floop  those aren t my ideas 
they re yours 
so what 
i think that s why
they re not working 
not yet they re not 
minion  but  you see   
i now have the third brain 
minion 
i don t need you anymore 
minion 
i assure you 
it s mr  minion now 
and you  floop 
have served your purpose 
children   
lock him in the   
virtual room 
 gasp 
you re a secret agent 
aren t you 
what makes you say that 
according to the database 
you re always traveling   
and no one knows
what you do for a living 
i think we all
have uncles like that 
 another fine machete product  
you make the best spy inventions
in the world 
ma chete  that s correct 
carmen  but you sell them
to both sides  good and bad 
that s why dad hasn t spoken
of you in all these years 
juni  ever sell stuff to floop 
why 
carmen  our mom and dad  
your brother  
are his prisoners   
and if we don t
do something to help   
something really bad s
gonna happen to them 
i don t see why
you won t help him  
you think i want to baby sit
my brother the rest of my life 
 watch out for gregorio 
take care of gregorio 
 make sure gregorio
knows right from wrong  
not anymore 
machete s not responsible
for nobody but machete 
but that s not what family is 
we re just brothers 
cain and abel were brothers 
look how they ended up 
now  the only thing
that will get you   
to floop s castle fast enough   
is this 
it s tiny 
it s built for one passenger 
but it s fast 
will you go 
no 
  for your brother 
  no 
then how about for us   
your niece and nephew 
no 
  how about if  
  no  no  a million times no 
pass the pig intestines 
i m not eating that now  nope

  no 
glass of water 
thank you for letting us
stay here   
while we ponder
our parents  terrible fate 
if you weren t a cortez

dad misses you  too 
ready

carmen  now we re talkin  
 snoring 
 whispering

we get to the castle 
rescue mom and dad   
then somehow stop floop   
from using the brain
on the robots   
before they re sent out
to dominate the world 
  think we can do that 
  how hard could it be 
 alarms sounding 
i didn t do anything

altitude  fine 
carmen  autopilot   failing 
oh  great

floop  you there 
what s that on your hands 
floop  warts  aren t they 
oh  great 
from sweaty hands sprout warts 
floop  do you know why
you have sweaty hands 
from being scared all the time 
you don t look
very scared to me 
that s because i m mad 
you kidnapped my parents   
made psycho robot children 
and swallowed up my sister 
but i didn t want any of that 
  i thought floop was a genius 
  you did 
you watch my show 
more than you know 
alexander minion 
agent cortez 
wonderful to see you again 
  you know him 
  yeah 
he was on
the third brain project   
until i noticed
he was trying to inject   
his own ideas into the system 
i turned him in 
he was thrown out of the oss 
minion  i m afraid i m not
nearly the artist floop is 
but not to worry 
i have something else in mind 
what do you think you re going
to accomplish by doing this 
well  you see  mrs  cortez   
i ve always been methodical 
goal oriented 
psychotically so 
i m not afraid of you  alex 
so i think it s refreshing   
to every once in a while   
have some fun 
minion  oh  and don t worry
about your little brats 
they ll still be able
to see you 
every weekday morning
between 7 30 and 8 00 
carmen  aah

i trust this time floop
will have a success to show us 
the fabulous floop is away
on other business  sir 
your army is complete 
the ultimate destructive force
is now within your grasp 
i ll believe that when i see it 
welcome back  ms  gradenko 
it s good to be back  alex 
let s never have children 
  so minion is the evil one 
  yes 
floop  but i will be blamed 
you have every reason
to be disappointed in me 
so what would you do if you
could shut this thing off   
and get out of here 
it s impossible  it can only be
turned off from the outside 
just suppose 
i d stop minion 
floop  i d stop
the robot army and hope   
that the world would forgive me 
 gagging 
you re my hero  floop   
so i m gonna help you 
then you re gonna help me 
  minion must be stopped 
  just one thing 
my show  what does it need 
i know it needs
something desperately   
but i can t figure it out 
maybe you can 
it needs children 
hold still 
now let s stop minion 
must be stopped 
must be stopped

free from your family 
hey

 squeaking 
minion  gentlemen   
your army marches to meet us
as we speak 
minion  your faith
and your patience   
have meant more than you know 
i speak for mr  floop
when i say that the value   
we place on partnership is  
floop  minion  this is floop 
please report
to the robotics lab at once 
we have huge  major  big time
problems with the robots 
lisp  i thought you said
floop wasn t here 
he s not 
floop  a problem  mr  minion 
as in mucho grande problemo 
i m gonna   
just be a moment 
floop  minion 
floop 
where are you 
floop  behind you 
what do you think you re doing 
you re supposed to be in line
with the others 
 using minion s voice  you re
supposed to be with the others 
  stop that 
  stop that 
  stop that this instant 
  stop that this instant 
stop that right now 
or what 
no 
clever boy you ve got there 
cortez  very clever indeed 
yes 
he gets that from his mother 
can i offer some sort of truce
in exchange for your daughter 
spoken for 
there you are  didn t see you 
didn t see her 
yaah  
i am going to show you
what happens   
when you cross the line
and involve family 
ingrid  now let s get
nice and comfortable 
yes 
promising  thank you 
  you couldn t possibly 
  no  but you can 
don t let go  ingrid 
hey  you two  come on 
fools 
ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  
come on 
we have to keep the army
from leaving the castle 
our only chance is to get
to the control room   
and hope that their missions
have not been programmed 
and what if they have 
then there s no one on earth
who can stop them 
  one at a time 
  go  go 
left  left  left  left 
that way 
where s mom and dad 
your doppelgangers have them 
can you shut them down
from here 
it s too late 
the third brain
is linked not only to them   
but to all the robot children 
  can t you remove it 
  we can t take 500 brains out 
  so don t  just reprogram it 
  that would take weeks 
  just two words 
  a binary switch  of course 
so they would define
right as wrong   
and wrong as right  come on 
but it s not that simple 
figure it out 
we ll be back for you 
teach them to be good 
have a seat  mr  lithp 
you ll be more comfortable 
it s lisp 
my army  ms  gradenko 
is the only comfort i need 
they re on their way now  sir 
minion 
what happened to your head 
oh  don t worry 
i think it s reversible 
mom   dad  
careful 
they re stronger
and smarter now 
so are we 
yaah  
see 
oh  shi   take mushrooms 
whoa   ohh  
ohh   ohh   ohh   
ohh   ohh   ohh   
let s go 
gregorio  lisp  should have
known you were behind this 
i take it you are minion 
 giggles 
ms  gradenko   i think 
oh  it s me  all right 
i owe my new look
to your children 
remind me to raise
their allowance 
lisp  minion  i think
now would be a good time   
to see a demonstration of your
wonderfully demonic children 
certainly 
argh  
your parents
were so easy to capture   
and you re not any better 
poor little juni 
defenseless and weak 
you re a worthless
little squirt 
juni  don t listen to her 
you re not worthless 
you figured out
how to get us here 
you helped floop realize
he was good  not bad 
you talked to the fooglies
and saved mom and dad 
you re strong  juni 
you re strong 
you re not that strong  juni 
ow 
puny   juni 
it s all over 
 giggling 
instant cement 
that should hold them 
 cement cracking 
  let s go find mom and dad 
  good idea 
minion  all robots

for a final demonstration
of your destructive powers 
  mom  dad  
  juni

juni  that s 500 total  dad 
we need one more person 
  isador 
  hello  little brother 
children  
tear them limb from limb 
good  how  how 
i ll have to teach them 
shaped by environment  man   
 gasps  of course 
  aah  
  haaah  
lisp  aah  
lisp  minion  
tell them to put me down  
minion  their mind
is a mirror now  sir 
anything we tell them goes
in one ear and out the other

i don t remember that reason 
neither do i 
 sniffling

he s emotional  latinos 
ok  that s it 
that s it  that s it 
so  what did you teach them 
it s not what
i can teach the children   
but what you taught me 
you won today  juni 
and not because   
you were the biggest
or the strongest   
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind 
and now the robots
have learned that as well 
thank you 
we went on the old fashioned
adventure i always wanted 
and we didn t do
one thing right 
nope 
we did two things right 
there is something
that we have to tell you 
ingrid  your father and i   
we re secret agents
