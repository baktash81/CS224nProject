right
the dwarves and snow white
good night doctor
good night genius

and when i stopped in front of you
you kissed me
princess your behind
is blowing in the wind
it depends on the person
my pop was like that
he had the ability
to make me do anything
he understood me
he knew how to deal with me
i was like putty in his hand
i always always always said yes
so all these treasures youre hiding
there is a way to open
this treasure chest
and always get you to say yes
its easier than you think
all you need is the right key
and where exactly is it
heaven knows
its clearing up
so you were saying
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven
yes
ill give it a try
if the virgin mary
tosses it down to me
you never know
mary the key
is this it
do you really have to go home
what about the chocolate ice cream
lets get it right now

then when
i dont know
are we going
to let heaven decide that too
no leave mary alone
dont bother her over an ice cream
no its way too important
we cant decide when to have it
i have to ask her
mary send someone to find out
how long before
we can have the ice cream
seven seconds

εverybodys waiting
ive looked everywhere for you
your uncle
my uncle
somethings happened
come with me
outside the horse
whats that
is that your horse
what a sight
what did they write on him
achtung jewish horse
the usual barbarians vandals
its sad what nonsense
jewish horse
dont get upset
they just did it to
they didnt do it to
they did it to
youll have to get used to it guido
theyll start with you too
with me
what could possibly happen to me
the worst they can do is undress me
paint me yellow and write
achtung jewish waiter
i didnt even know
this horse was jewish
lets go
ill clean him up in the morning
take him back to the stall
look there in front of you
wait ill surprise her
come with me id like to
introduce you to fido giovanardi
doctor lessing where are you going
urgent telegram
i must go to βerlin immediately
what are these flowers

ill take it to my wife guidos flower
i truly enjoyed myself with you
youre the most ingenious
waiter ive ever come across
thank you youre the customer with
the most culture ive ever served
thank you
goodbye doctor lessing
βy the way
if you say my name
im not there anymore
who am i
if you say my name
im not there anymore
what is it what did he say
silence
βeautiful if you say the word
its not there anymore silence
im not talking about βerlin
in the outskirts imagine that
third grade listen to this problem
i remember it because it shocked me
a lunatic costs the state
four marks a day
a cripple four and a half marks
an epileptic three marks and a half
considering that the average
is four marks a day
and there are 300000 patients
how much would the state save
if these individuals were eliminated
i cant believe this
that was my exact reaction
i cant believe
a sevenyearold child
has to solve this kind of equation
its a difficult calculation
proportions percentages
they need at least some algebra
to do those equations
thats high school material for us
no all it takes is multiplication
you said there are 300000 cripples
300000 times four
if we killed them all
wed save 1200000 marks a day
its easy
εxactly
βut youre an adult they make seven
yearold children do this in germany
its truly another race
good morning princess
