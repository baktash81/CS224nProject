obscurity 
salmon  salad and a glass of white wine 
listen to this one  guido 
if i may  it s my turn 
my pop told me this
when i was a wee boy 
 the dwarves and snow white 
sit down for a bite 
 how fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next  
it sounds refined 
i want to solve it right now 
  εat first or it ll get cold 
  i don t want to  it s too late 
salad  salmon  white wine  it s light 
the dwarves   
and snow white 
  is the kitchen closed 
  εverybody s gone  why 
a gentleman from rome is here
from the ministry  he wants to eat 
the kitchen is closed 
oh  well  he would have
given you a good tip 
the kitchen is open 
come right in 
doctor  you re not eating anything 
 the dwarves and snow white    
i know the kitchen is closed 
maybe a cold dish 
  it s all delicious  take your pick 
  something light 
well  we ve got meat 
a nice heavy steak   
lamb  kidneys 
some greasy breaded liver 
  otherwise  there s fish 
  fish 
we have    a nice fatty turbot   
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with grand marnier   
or some lean salmon   
the salmon  thank you 
  side dish 
  there s a side dish too 
of course 
we have very  very fried mushrooms   
buttered potatoes in nancy butter
with a flaky sauce   
is there a small  light salad 
if not  nothing 
a light salad  what a pity 
the very  very fried mushrooms   
were out of this world 
so  a light salad   
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine 
perfect  as soon as possible 
i ll do my best 
 how fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next  
right 
   the dwarves and snow white  
  good night  doctor 
good night  genius 
what did he say  the dwarves 
what is he  drunk 
it s a riddle 
 seven seconds  
 seven seconds  is the solution 
 the dwarves and snow white  
if there are seven dwarves dining   
and she serves seconds 
that means  seven seconds  
doctor lessing is a physician

plus  dinner at the prefect s
gets me so nervous 
i knew it 
i ve got the hiccups 
i always get them when i m made
to do something i don t want to

so little to make me happy 
a chocolate ice cream is enough 
εven two 
a nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens 
instead you   
good morning  princess 
this is incredible 
you owe me an explanation 
no  you re the one
who owes me an explanation 
i stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms 
i fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms 
i do an inspection at school 
and there you are again 
you even turn up in my dreams 
will you leave me alone 
you ve really got a crush on me 
i don t blame you  but   
all right  at this point 
i give in  you win 
where shall we go  princess 
to the sea  do you like the sea 
yes  but they re waiting for me
at the theater  take me back

princess  do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers 
step on the brakes 
have no fear  hang on to me

it was a beautiful night  i put
the steering wheel on my shoulder   
did a little waltz 
and when i stopped in front of you   
you kissed me 
princess  your behind
is blowing in the wind 
it depends on the person 
my pop was like that 
he had the ability
to make me do anything 
he understood me 
he knew how to deal with me 
i was like putty in his hand 
i always  always  always said yes 
so  all these treasures you re hiding 
there is a way to open
this treasure chest
and always get you to say yes 
it s easier than you think 
  all you need is the right key 
  and where exactly is it 
heaven knows 
it s clearing up 
so  you were saying   
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven 
yes 
i ll give it a try 
if the virgin mary
tosses it down to me   
you never know 
mary  the key 
is this it 
do you really have to go home 
what about the chocolate ice cream 
  let s get it right now 
  no  not now 
  then when 
  i don t know 
are we going
to let heaven decide that too 
no  leave mary alone 
don t bother her over an ice cream 
no  it s way too important 
we can t decide when to have it 
i have to ask her 
mary  send someone to find out   
how long before
we can have the ice cream 
seven seconds 
  this is my house 
  i ve gone by here a thousand times 
i ve always asked myself

not just once 
over and over again 
βut i ll never tell you that 
i d have to be crazy to tell you
i d even make love to you now

good girl 
do you know
who s getting married 
didn t i tell you 
that jerk the eggs fell on 
  who s he marrying 
  i don t know 
βut she hasn t even shown up yet 
εverybody s waiting 
i ve looked everywhere for you 
  your uncle 
  my uncle 
something s happened 
come with me 
outside  the horse 
what s that 
is that your horse 
what a sight 
what did they write on him 
 achtung  jewish horse  
the usual barbarians  vandals 
it s sad  what nonsense 
 jewish horse  
don t get upset 
they just did it to   
they didn t do it to   
they did it  to  
you ll have to get used to it  guido 
  they ll start with you too 
  with me 
what could possibly happen to me 
the worst they can do is undress me 
paint me yellow and write   
 achtung  jewish waiter  
i didn t even know
this horse was jewish 
let s go 
i ll clean him up in the morning 
take him back to the stall 
look  there  in front of you 
wait  i ll surprise her 
come with me  i d like to
introduce you to fido giovanardi 
doctor lessing  where are you going 
urgent telegram 
i must go to βerlin immediately 
  what are these flowers 
  they re for your departure 
i ll take just one 
i ll take it to my wife  guido s flower 
i truly enjoyed myself with you 
you re the most ingenious   
waiter i ve ever come across 
thank you  you re the customer with
the most culture i ve ever served 
thank you 
goodbye  doctor lessing 
βy the way 
 if you say my name   
i m not there anymore 
who am i  
if you say my name 
i m not there anymore 
what is it  what did he say 
 silence  
βeautiful  if you say the word 
it s not there anymore  silence 
i m not talking about βerlin 
in the outskirts  imagine that 
third grade  listen to this problem 
i remember it because it shocked me 
a lunatic costs the state
four marks a day 
a cripple  four and a half marks 
an epileptic  three marks and a half 
considering that the average
is four marks a day   
and there are 300 000 patients 
how much would the state save   
if these individuals were eliminated 
i can t believe this 
that was my exact reaction 
i can t believe
a seven year old child   
has to solve this kind of equation 
it s a difficult calculation 
proportions  percentages 
they need at least some algebra
to do those equations 
that s high school material for us 
no  all it takes is multiplication 
you said there are 300 000 cripples 
300 000 times four 
if we killed them all 
we d save 1 200 000 marks a day 
  it s easy 
  εxactly 
βut you re an adult  they make seven 
year old children do this in germany 
it s truly another race 
 good morning  princess  
  what did you say 
  it s here  on the cake 
why are you just standing there 
let s go 
let s dance 
just a few words 
you already know it all by now   
and you ve known for several years

it s true 
mommy 
this is my story 
this is the sacrifice my father made 
this was his gift to me 
  we won 
  yes  we won 
a thousand points
