orchestrated a swift and violent coup   
   against the democratically elected
government of president samuel azuka 
in the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups   
    there d been a long history
of ethnic enmity   
   particularly between northern fulani
moslems and southern christian ibo 
the victorious fulani rebels
have tak en to the streets   
   as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country 
thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter 
fearing ethnic cleansing  most ibo
have abandoned their homes   
   and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it 
gen  yakubu has tak en control
of most of the country   
   and appears firmly in charge 
there s no word on the united nations 
reaction to the coup   
   but united states forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy 
as you can see behind me 
on the uss harry s  truman   
   activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over nigeria 
this once peaceful country   
   has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles   
   mainly over control
of nigeria s vast oil supply 
however  nothing can prepare
the country   
   for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place 
we have just heard
that the entire presidential family   
   has been assassinated 
l repeat 
the entire presidential family
has been assassinated

our report said the entire

your reports were incorrect 
they were not executed 
they murdered my father   
   along with my mother   
   and my two   
   younger sisters   
   out of greed   
   and my father s fight for democracy
for his people 
my people 
when it first appeared
there might be trouble   
   my father sent me away with this man 
col  okeze 
lieutenant  his father was more
than the president 
he was the tribal king 
that makes him the heir
to the lbo nation 
lt s a bloodline they must cut 
the fulanis will comb heaven
and earth to find him 
you knew about this 
you knew all the time

within dr  kendricks  refugee party 
that s a major problem  lieutenant 
he inv olves your mission in the
internal politics of a foreign nation   
   affecting u s  diplomacy and
seriously increases the mission s risk 
he s considered a criminal
by the new regime 
he s a major liability 
 what exactly does that mean  sir 
 his party is excess cargo 
you mean he s not human  sir 
captain  this man is the lbo tribal
leader  do you know what that means
