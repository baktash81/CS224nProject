orchestrated a swift and violent coup
against the democratically elected
government of president samuel azuka
in the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups
thered been a long history
of ethnic enmity
particularly between northern fulani
moslems and southern christian ibo
the victorious fulani rebels
have tak en to the streets
as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country
thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter
fearing ethnic cleansing most ibo
have abandoned their homes
and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it
gen yakubu has tak en control
of most of the country
and appears firmly in charge
theres no word on the united nations
reaction to the coup
but united states forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy
as you can see behind me
on the uss harry s truman
activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over nigeria
this once peaceful country
has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles
mainly over control
of nigerias vast oil supply
however nothing can prepare
the country
for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place
we have just heard
that the entire presidential family
has been assassinated
l repeat
the entire presidential family
has been assassinated
