the society

at the robert west house
but thats not until the end of march

mr doyle family law in this jurisdiction

something like that
l suggest you come back to me when
your circumstances are more favorable
and lll see what l can do
on the banks of the roses

that hed rather see me dead
and buried in the clay
sooner than be married to any runaway
on the lovely sweet banks of the roses

and i took out my fiddle
for to play my love a tune

lts really warm
stuff it will you
good girl
grandmas got a letter from sydney
sidney who

australia
lts from mommy shes in australia
she didnt give her address
but it said sydney on the postmark thing
l might have guessed
she always had the wanderlust
your mother
grandma said its hot in australia
lt is
you can tell her its not as hot
as the place where her daughter will end up
okay
thats it
still no carriages dad
no son
still no carriages
dear daddy its great news that you have
such a good job doing up that old house
i miss you and the boys
and granddad very much
and i hope we can get back together soon
what did granddad mean
when he told me to tell grandma daisley
that he hopes mommy
meets a great white in australia
i think its a kangaroo
but mary thinks its a koala bear
i like most of the nuns here
sister felicity is nice and kind
and so is sister theresa
but sister brigid is very scary
ls god good just and merciful
yes sister
yes isnt the catechism answer is it
what does the catechism say
lt says
lve had enough of you annette farrell
now
god is infinitely good
infinitely just
and infinitely
what are you saying to me child
l dont think you should do that sister
lf god is infinitely merciful
he wouldnt want you to do that
you dare to question me about god
lnsolent brat
right outside
never
never talk to me like that again
wheres my daughter evelyn doyle
do you have an appointment
l dont need an appointment
to see my own daughter
who are you
lm sister brigid
are you
lf you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again
l will tear you
limb from limb
now where is she
ln the refectory on the first floor
right
you shouldnt be on the premises
lve come for my daughter
you must leave
lm not leaving without her
you know thats impossible
lm having her back where is she
you cannot barge in here
theres no bloody laws in lreland
that will keep her away from me
how dare you use language like that
in front of me
dont speak to me like that l will not have it
daddy dont fight
dont fight with sister theresa
lts all right love dont worry
can l see her
not if youre going to run off with her
thatll just get you arrested
okay l promise
l just wanna hold her for a second
l give you my word all right
evelyn your daddys here to see you
lts good to see you
daddy have you come to take me home
yes
lll be taking you home soon pet
very soon
l hear youre doing well at your new job
my circumstances have improved
as you would say
so youll take the case then
youve been drinking havent you
l can smell it off your breath
since were not planning on kissing
l dont see a problem
lts not going to help our case
if the court thinks
youre drinking your pay packet
our case
that means youll take it then
who is this gobshite
this gobshite
is the minister for education
hes claiming we require the consent
of your wife for the release of your kids
how can we get her consent
when shes disappeared
even her puddingfaced old mothers
got no address
lts the law yours is a unique case
normally the wife would be deceased
she ran out on her kids
what kind of mother would do that
we could argue that shes emotionally
incapable of bringing up the children
but lm afraid all of that is
strictly speaking irrelevant
the law still requires her consent
no matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved
to hell with the law
that attitude will get us nowhere desmond
lve done everything l was asked to do
that district judge or justice
didnt tell me ld need my wifes consent
he definitely misdirected you
which gives us a useful basis for a start
but it may not be material enough
for a challenge in law
as there are no precedents for your case
well make the bloody precedent
l want justice
the law and justice
are two entirely different things
jesus you can say that again
of course lm only a solicitor
lm not entitled to speak
in a court case like this
we need a barrister
and theyre very expensive
l dont care how much it costs
lll work round the clock if l have to
to fight church and state
is to fight goliath
david beat goliath in the book l read
lts a first edition
ls it
yeats
ltll be grand l tell you
lve got it all worked out dad
dont worry about it
get us another pint
youll have another one
l will
make mine a large one bernadette
a pint for desmond
you two are knocking them back tonight
poor dessies going through
a rough time lately
arent we all fond of a drink
thats right henry
you cant hold that against a man can you
that lad of yours is going through hell
l think hes drinking to forget
youre right fergal
l wonder if our american friend knows
the one thing worse than drinking to forget
do you know what that is son
worse than drinking to forget no
forgetting to drink
lll drink to that
that wife of his
didnt know the meaning of the word love
love
lts strange the greeks
have all these different words for love
philia agapi eros
we have just the one
we use the same word
for our nearest and dearest
as we do for a packet of cigarettes
lts interesting isnt it
l think its very interesting
did you know that eskimos
have over 40 different words for snow
ls that a fact
lts true the wife told me that
she should know shes frigid
youre an awful man
l keep telling you not to drink and drive
lm not drinking and driving
l drank before l drove
l dont think this is a good idea
lts the only way dad
lts the only way
l can see the dormitory there
we should come back some other time
no lve got to rescue the poor little mite
right weve come this far
jesus
theyve greased the top of the wall
mind yourself son
bernadette
youre drenched
thatll be the rain
youre one to talk
l just
come in
sit yourself down
lts okay lm not staying
all right suit yourself
lll get you a towel a clean one
this place needs a good cleaning
lts got more empties than fergals
looking for a towel here somewhere god
here we go
there it is
you can have it if you want
as a reward
for putting me in touch with your brother
l had no idea you could do this
theres lots of things l can do
that you dont know about
lm sure there are
were saving up for a housekeeper
you know anyone whos suitable
lts not a housekeeper you need
lts a barkeeper
you know what your problem is
you think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle
and everything will be grand
lts time you grew up
you like my cheeky twinkle then
you drink too much
ridiculous lve got a lot on my mind
like a trip to scotland with your kids
what
how do you know about that
because the tickets fell out of your coat
an adult and three kids
who could that be l wonder
l knew you were up to something
you big idiot
dont call me a big idiot
lll bet you want someone smooth
like the yank
whose jokes you laugh at all the time
like hes oscar bloody wilde
nicks funny and hes more of a ladies man
than oscar ever was
l get the message
you fancy him
dont tell me who l fancy
thats for me to decide
what l dont want is a drunkard
who has some mad notion about
sneaking off with his kids to scotland
why should you care
what business is it of yours
because l dont want
to have to visit you in prison
has anybody ever told you
youre a fine woman
lots of men
some of them werent even married
not until you give me the tickets
what
give me the ferry tickets
lll take them back and get you a refund
jesus woman
you drive a hard bargain where are they
here you go
thanks
l always get sick on the ferry anyway
l just think you know you and l
do you really think ld kiss you now
ltd be like kissing a soggy beermat
but you just said
no l said you have to give up the drink
for gods sake
thats the hardest thing to do
the second hardest
getting your family back is the hardest
oh of all the money that ever i had
i spent it in good company
and all the harm that ever ive done
alas it was to none but me
and if i had money enough to spend
and leisure time to sit awhile
there is a fair maid in this town
who sorely has my heart beguiled
her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
i own she has my heart in thrall
so fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all
good man des
lovely good man
thank you very much everyone
youve been wonderful god bless you all
we hope to see you again next week
okay god bless good night

good old dad
l knew he wouldnt leave us
good morning miss gilhooly
mr doyle
didnt you get the letter
what letter
the one canceling this appointment
l didnt get any letter
lve taken this morning
especially off work to see him
this is my family were talking about
where is he
jesus
jesus mary and joseph
lilo higgi come on
sorry sir lts a trespasser
lts all right this is a client of mine
a client sir
yes
we have an appointment
please let us know in the future sir
if youre expecting visitors
what the hell are you smirking at
do you think this is funny
do you think you can cancel appointments
and treat people like dirt
mr doyle
l wasnt talking to you yank
all youre good fors wearing sharp suits
doing fancy deals
and trying to get hands on our women
and our fish
desmond be reasonable
lm sorry l missed our appointment
but theres really nothing more
l can do for you anymore
really
your being sorry
isnt gonna get my kids back now is it
lm sure the yank here is having great fun
seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish weve got over here
but ask yourself this mr big shot
what if it was your family
wouldnt you fight tooth and nail
to get them back
or are you just another
heartless gutless bastard
congratulations
you just found yourself a lawyer
ls that a fact
who
me
so youre not a chemist then
how come you can work over here
if youre a yank
actually lm lrish
l was born and reared in kilkenny
till l was 9
then we emigrated to the states
and l subsequently came back here
to study law at ucd
so hes qualified to plead in lrish courts
does my being a yank bother you
not at all l like yanks
most of them were lrish
to begin with anyway
but l cant afford to pay you fancy money
lm not doing this for the money
youll just have to raise enough
to cover our costs
right
l really appreciate your help so l do
well do our best for you
right cheerio
cheerio
well do our best
were in this together my friend
do you think lll take this on
with any other solicitor
we have no chance
l dont know why youre taking it on
because l know what hes going through
through no ones fault but my own
l lost my own kids in that divorce
you dont realize what were up against
l do realize what were up against
what possible chance
do you think you have
you and mr
mr doyle
mr doyle here
a painter and what decorator
master tradesman to you
apart from anything else
it will be prohibitively expensive
only if we lose
youll lose mr
beattie
youll lose because
if you were to win this case
the whole basis of family law
would be undermined
and believe me gentlemen
that will not be allowed to happen
we thank you for your advice mr
shall we
by the way minister
your paintworks shite
what we really need
is an expert in family law to keep us right
you know
l thought you were an expert
l havent done family law in 20 years
lve only a working knowledge
you mean you dont know what youre
talking about cant you read some books
lts not quite as simple as that
lts a very tricky area
weve still got the problem that everyones
terrified of taking on the establishment
what was the name of that guy
that lectured us about family law
remember the real character
tom connolly
there was a connolly who played rugby
for lreland until his cartilage went
l think he did a bit of law in his spare time
would that be him
gentlemen lm flattered by your attentions
but l retired two years ago
ln short l can no longer face
speaking in court
sir you wouldnt have to speak in court
mr barron here will do all the speaking
but frankly sir he needs your help
my family law is so rusty
even if you could just come on board
as a consultant
lm sorry to say this to you mr doyle
but theyll put forward the best people
to put the case for the state
the best that money can buy
thats why they hated me
l wouldnt be bought
l believe that if there is a god
hell step in to help us
lm touched by your faith
this is the only holy spirit
lve found to be of any practical assistance
slainte
you were a big hero to me as a boy
mr connolly
to my dad too
he took me to all your games
you see that photo there
l was at that game
the one where you got injured
that was the beginning of the end
when that big brute of a fullback
did my cartilage in
he was english of course the bastard
still before l left the field
l managed to boot him where his balls
would have been if hed any
fair play to you
anyway lads
your case is interesting
hopeless but interesting
you really think its hopeless
this case is what l used to call
a real st jude
why st jude
because st jude
is the patron saint of hopeless cases
as l recall sir youve won
quite a few st judes in your time
l suppose l have
retirement must be excruciatingly boring
for a man like yourself
gentlemen
l propose a toast
justice and st jude
i am desmond doyle
father of evelyn doyle whos been held
in your care without my consent
l request the return
of my daughter forthwith
mr doyle you cannot have your daughter
ln that case my solicitor
mr michael beattie
will present you
with a writ of habeas corpus
drafted by my counselor
mr nicholas barron
duly presented
duly witnessed
thank you sister thats all we need
so it went well then
lt went like a dream
desmond remembered all his lines
and spoke them beautifully
laurence olivier had better watch out
you didnt attack a nun then
l did not
lm learning the rules of the game
what do we do now
we wait
no thats just what they want us to do
theyll do nothing for months
and hope that well go away
nothing will happen
unless we force their hand
lll give my old friend hugh canning a ring
hugh canning
but hes a sports commentator
mostly yes
but he does a bit of everything
may god grant you justice
take this and run along girl
thank you sister
what is it
eileen come here
whats going on
desmond doyle a painter and decorator
from fatima mansions dublin
is a loving father who just wants
to spend time with his children
but the powers that be wont let him
desmonds rosycheeked
little daughter evelyn
at least theyve set a date for the hearing
thats the first step
a little bit of gentle pressure did the trick
we had to give the minister
a kick up his fat ass
what do we do now
you should smarten yourself up
the press might want photos of you
try combing your hair occasionally
shave
look as if you havent just fallen out of bed
use me as a role model if you want to
and buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court
new shoes
yes
lve known judges who judge a mans
character by the state of his shoes
here they come lets get a shot
especially of the little girl
come on
get the three of them together now
daddy l scored a goal in gaelic
daddy
my loves you look wonderful
daddy l like your new shoes
thanks evelyn
ferris hasnt changed much since l knew
him the tornfaced old poultice
hes always looked like the turin shroud
we used to call him ferris the ferret
which is an insult to the rodent
mr barron youre representing
the petitioner desmond doyle
yes my lord
we contend the judge at the district court
hearing of january 10 of this year
misdirected the petitioner
mr desmond doyle
l refer you to the notes of that case
wherein the judge expressed his hope
that mr doyle would not have to leave
his children in care for too long
sadly that has not been the case here
the childrens act of 1941 clearly states
that unless the spouse is deceased
which is not the case here
then the consent
of both parents is required
this is the basis of our case your lordship
provision of the childrens act
must be understood in its literal
grammatical meaning
both parents means exactly that
l therefore find against the petitioner
desmond doyle
thank you judge hall
judge mclaughlin
with some reluctance
l conclude that l too must find against
the petitioners application
and uphold the ministers decision
weve lost
thats absolutely ridiculous
order in court
you rotten louses let his babies go home
silence or l shall have the court cleared
silence in court
hes loving this the rodent
lt is incontrovertible
that section 10
subsection 1 of the childrens act 1941
requires the consent of both parents
ln the absence of such consent
evelyn doyle and her brothers
will remain in custody
until they are 16 years of age
daddy
furthermore this court has decided
that since the childrens act
is capable of no other interpretation
any appeal
would be a waste of the courts time
right of appeal is therefore denied
no you fleafaced rat
who said that
was that you connolly
this is hugh canning
the man who broke the doyle story
covering this sensational new development
leave them alone
get your hands off my kids
leave me alone
daddy
unbelievable scenes here at the high court
lve never seen anything like it
desmond doyle struggles with the gardai
for possession of his children
a pitiful scene to watch
and who wouldnt sympathize with a father
in this situation
daddy
children
daddy please
ls desmond doyle here
hes sitting over there in the booth
sorry to interrupt you
lm honest joe oleary racecourse bookie
l owned the book
on the outcome of your court case
the punters backed you heavy
great
l didnt feel right in keeping this
so l want you to have it
jesus
my god
lts only 600 so l thought
it might go towards your court costs
l dont know what to say mr oleary
you dont have to say anything mr doyle
you see l grew up in an orphanage
l wish my dad had your guts
good luck to you good night all
good night
were organizing a race next month
the desmond doyle benefit sweepstake
great
put your money on slippery sam
slippery sam
grand man good night now god bless
this calls for a celebration
another round for the table
make mine a lemonade
what a lemonade are you all right son
no lm feeling terrible
but maybe its time l tried to feel better
jerry
keep your eye on the ball son
dig it out
dig it out
thomas
good reflexes youll need them
back in the lrish strip l see
lt helps me to see things more clearly
did you play rugby yourself nick
no l understand its kind of
a neanderthal version of american football
ls that what you think
hut hut
hopeless
so anyway
why have l invited you to this sacred turf
l was kind of wondering that
so was l
me too lts not exactly
how l planned to spend my morning
you know
when my cartilage went
and they were taking me off on a stretcher
l looked up and l saw this father
holding his little child up on his shoulders
they thought l was a hero
but you know something
l envied that man so much he was my hero
all desmond wants
is to hold his kids up on his shoulders
we can help you to that
but how tom there is no right of appeal
ferris made sure of that
we dont need an appeal
not if we bring an entirely new case
based on an entirely different
principle of law
but were automatically barred
from bringing the same facts
before the same court
thats already heard them
be it the district courts or high courts
weve nowhere else to go
there is somewhere else to go
the supreme court
the supreme court
we cant go there with this
they wont hear a case like this
they only deal with big stuff
yes
like laws that contravene
the lrish constitution
which lve been reading
wait a second hold on
has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds
no
what chance do you think weve got
who knows
but lve seen games won by teams
without any hope at all
bloody hopeless
good evening
and welcome to the very first edition
of conversations with canning
on this marvelous new medium
of the television
for those of you who listen to my show
on the wireless
i hope im even better looking
than you thought
now many of you
will remember these sad headlines
of last month
desmonds despair
desmond certainly isnt despairing
at the moment

in our ultramodern television studio
and hes got new reasons for being hopeful
havent you desmond
yes
its okay you dont have to shout
we can hear you fine

when he smartens himself up
hes learning lve always told him
he should model himself on me
that your daughter evelyn
and your two boys are being held illegally
yes
and youll be taking on
some pretty top people
yeah were gonna call
the minister of education as a witness
and ive often asked myself
what drives desmond doyle
desmond

im sick of saying goodbye to them
all the time
i just dont want them
to spend their whole childhood crying
has a date been set for the trial

but l want my kiddies home for christmas

who knows what shell do
fatima mansions versus the usa
tough choice
sister why dont you cut my hair
youve cut everybody elses
because they are not likely
to have their photos all over the newspaper
why should that make a difference
l dont think that l should be treated special
just because my daddys getting famous
but didnt your daddy tell us
not to cut your hair
yes and didnt he tell you
to let me go home
you didnt take a blind bit of notice
look
lf l were to cut your hair
sister theresa would not be amused
lll explain to my daddy if he gets cross
and who will explain it to sister theresa
if she gets cross
you sister
hugh canning reporting to you live
from outside the supreme court
on the first day of this historic case
a grand official car has just arrived
lts the minister of education
looks as if hed rather be
somewhere else this day
this must be what soldiers feel like
just before battle
nervous
nervous
lm only trying to make legal history
by doing something thats never been
done before and if l fail lm unemployable
but if you win son youre immortal
youre in the history books
and youll help take this country
out of the dark ages
rosary beads
l thought you werent religious
lm not
when the verdict comes in
these are for counting the score
remember nick speak from your heart
lll sit up in the gallery
out of the ferrets eyeline
thanks tom
good luck son
thanks for everything
right
let the battle commence
ls this all right
lts fine
minister three times now
you have refused
to reconsider the case of desmond doyle
ls that correct
lt is a decision subsequently upheld
by the high court
yes but the grounds for our action now
are fundamentally different is that not so
l suppose it is
could you tell us minister to whom or
to what do you owe your eminent position
pardon
your job sir who appointed you
objection your lordship
this is irrelevant not to say insolent
my lord
counsel for the plaintiff
has indeed failed to establish relevance
l am about to do so your lordship
l hope so mr barron proceed
as minister for education you are
a government appointee are you not
of course l am
what is the document on which
the lrish governments authority
and therefore your authority rests
the lrish constitution
have you read it recently
objection your lordship
this is insufferable
counsel for the plaintiff is not displaying
due deference to the witness my lord
objection sustained
be careful mr barron
the witness must be treated with respect
yes my lord
l would be grateful
if you could read out to the court
those short extracts
from the lrish constitution
which we have established
is the basis for your authority
article 1
the lrish constitution shall be consistent
with the law of god
article 41
a parent and child have a fundamental
and godgiven right
to the enjoyment of each others
mutual society
article 42
a blameless parent shall not be deprived
of his or her right
to direct the childs education
ls it fair to say
that by consistently rejecting
desmond doyles application
for the return of his children
you have denied him
that fundamental and godgiven right
would it be fair to say that minister
we are waiting for your response
that is a possibility
yes
and is it also a possibility
that you have contravened
article 42 of the constitution
by denying desmond doyle
the right to direct his childrens education
yes
that is also a possibility
that is what we are here to determine
exactly
and we will so determine
good boy
no further questions
well done
article 42 of the constitution
refers to a blameless parent
and we contend that this concept
is tacit also in article 41
that it is the blameless parent
who has a fundamental godgiven right
to his childrens society
this
does not apply to desmond doyle
he came barging in unannounced
to the main building
he was in a terrible rage
and he looked like a man
possessed by the devil
objection your lordship
the witness is demonizing my client
not so my lord the sister
is merely expressing herself vividly
using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation
objection overruled proceed sister
he was like a man possessed
he shouted at me where is my daughter
he yelled at the top of his voice
and what did you say to him sister
l asked him if he had an appointment
and what did he say
he grabbed me by the throat
and almost choked the life out of me
throttling me he was
he said if l didnt tell him
where his daughter was
he would tear me limb from limb
those were his exact words
l thought he was going to murder me
and what did he do then sister
l told him where the girl was
and he ran upstairs
repeating his threats as he did so
my neck was black and blue
from where his thumbs had been
did you report
this deplorable incident to anyone
yes l phoned the police
they will confirm every word
sister theresa decided out of the charity
of her heart not to press charges
no further questions my lord
have l messed it up for us all then
you may have
were just gonna have to show
that this was an isolated incident
not part of a pattern of behavior
l hope that was the only such incident
of course it was
apart from the time you tried to punch
father omalley at fergals
that
and when you tried to kidnap your kids
yes but l was drunk on both occasions
for gods sake dont try to use
drunkenness as a defense
lt doesnt impress them
havent you heard the phrase
as sober as a judge
so you see your lordship
l only shook sister brigid when
l found out shed beaten up my little girl
l object your lordship
not as much as l object
l object to anyone laying a finger
on my kids
objection upheld
thats mr wolfes objection
not yours mr doyle
continue with your testimony
wouldnt any father have done what l did
evelyns face was all battered and bruised
silence in court
even as a very dubious kind of catholic
who finds himself throttling a nun
you must know that the fundamental
building block of our society
is the family
whose very model is the holy family
jesus mary and joseph
how can you as a single father
and as a catholic
possibly claim to bring up your children
without a mother
there is absolutely no precedent for it
in the religion
in which you allegedly believe
cat got your tongue
mr doyle
there is
there is a precedent as youd like to call it
what are you saying
the fundamental building block of our faith
is not the holy family
its the holy trinity
the father the son and the holy spirit
when my mother died
my father brought us up on his own
with only the holy spirit to guide him
he used to say the holy spirit was love
doesnt the holy bible say
faith hope and love
but the greatest of these is love
lve given up the drink
lve worked all the hours god sends
lve become a better person
to try and fill myself with the holy spirit
so l can bring my kids up
surrounded by love
thats all l can do
no man can do more
silence in court
silence
no further questions
your lordship we would request
that the court is recalled
when we have subpoenaed
our next witness
evelyn doyle
the bastards
theyll intimidate the little soul
lord jesus l have to go to the big court
soon to answer some questions
please let my daddy win
l know youre testing him
but l think hes getting very tired
lord please let him win
amen
daddy
hello love
your hair
l told them to cut it
dont you like it
lts lovely pet
lt suits you
youve got your new shoes on again
youve got to go now
bye daddy
silence in court
the court will draw itself to order
now evelyn doyle
do you remember the time in st josephs
when you tripped in the corridor
and bashed your face
when you fell down the stairs
no sir
think back to last march
apparently sister felicity
had to give you some aspirin
lsnt that correct
yes sir she did
and why was that
because my face was all swollen
and black and blue
because you had fallen down the stairs
no thats what sister brigid said
according to sister felicity
you made no attempt
to deny the fact that you had fallen
down the stairs and bruised your face
you didnt say otherwise did you
no
l mean yes
lm all mixed up
so what really happened
was exactly what sister brigid said
had happened
and you made up a story
in your letter to your father
because you wanted to get out
of st josephs
and you thought a little lie would help
l didnt lie l didnt make it up
l know it must be a frightening
experience for you evelyn
being a little girl in a big court like this
you must try not to be scared even though
youre alone in front of all these people
lm not scared anymore your lordship
and lm not alone
my granddad is here with me
see hes letting us know hes here
your lordship the childs grandfather
died some months ago
she obviously has a very
vivid imagination
now child
let me ask you one last time
do you remember falling in the corridor
and hitting your face on the stairs
no l didnt fall on the stairs
l was going to tell sister felicity
what really happened
but then l thought
it would only get sister brigid into trouble
so l prayed that god
would forgive sister brigid for hitting me
this is a preposterous assertion
why on earth
would the good sister hit you
because l said she shouldnt belt annette
for getting her catechism wrong
poor little innocent shame on you
she was better off with desmond doyle
l can see that now
wait till l get you outside
silence in court
evelyn doyle
do you expect this court to believe
that after she did that to you
you prayed for her
yes l did
l put it to you that you are lying
lying is a sin
against the eighth commandment
thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor
lm surprised you dont know that
if youre a lawyer
sister brigid told this court
the truth of the matter
that she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs
no thats not true
hope she goes to confession soon
wanna hear the prayer l said last night
we do not
not so mr wolfe
lt is material to the courts evaluation
of the childs character
evelyn let us hear your prayer please
lord god
you guide the universe
with wisdom and love
hear the prayer we make to you
for our country
the beautiful country of lreland
through the honesty of our citizens
and the wisdom of those who govern us
may lasting peace be delivered
and truth and justice flourish
amen
shes a credit to you
thank you
thank you evelyn you may step down
the great day has finally arrived
the day desmond doyle and his kids
and indeed the whole of lreland
has been waiting for
the day when desmond finds out
once and for all
whether he will get his kids back
sister why couldnt me and the boys
go to court today
because they dont want a repeat
of the scenes they had last time
the lord mayor of dublin has just
appeared in his official limousine
and a beautiful car it is too
l would remind you however
that never before
has a law been found repugnant
to the lrish constitution
and that has to happen today
if desmond doyle is to win
l now call on justice ferris
to deliver his judgment
l am persuaded by mr wolfes argument
on behalf of the minister for education
that the term parent
in articles 41 and 42 of the constitution
must be held to imply both parents
there is no contradiction
between those articles
and section 10 of the childrens act
and said act
is not repugnant to the constitution
l therefore find in favor of the defendant
the minister for education
lll strangle that ferret one day
lts 10 to the minister with 2 votes to go
the next judge justice daley
must vote for desmond
or its all over for the doyles
dont despair my child have faith
or therell be rioting going on
l agree with mr wolfe
that the minister for education has
at all times
acted in a reasonable
and conscientious manner
within the provisions of the childrens act
l also agree with my learned
and honorable friend justice ferris
that there is no precedent for declaring
an lrish statute
repugnant to the constitution
please god grant us a however
and therefore invalid
however despite the absence
of precedent
l find mr barrons argument persuasive
ln any event with respect to
my learned friend mr ferris
it is the duty of the supreme court
not only to follow precedent
but to set it
on the grounds submitted
that the childrens act 1941 section 10
contravenes a parents fundamental
godgiven right
to the society of his children
and is therefore repugnant
to the constitution
l find in favor of the plaintiff
desmond doyle
marvelous children
dont you stop praying now
the supreme court now it all rests on the
shoulders of justice lynch a kerry man
the tension in here is almost unbearable
i cant think of anything like it since
tom connollys lastsecond penalty goal
that won ireland the triple crown
30 years ago
and amazingly
connolly is now part
of desmond doyles team
l have been impressed
by desmond doyles diligence
and determination in rebuilding
his financial and domestic circumstances
in the wake of
his wifes unfortunate desertion
l have noted too
the obvious bonds of love and affection
between doyle and his daughter evelyn
who made a deep impression on me
and lm sure on all of us
in the witness stand
please no dont give us a however
however we are officers of the law
and must not be guided by sentiment
though mr barron
made a moving and powerful plea
on behalf of his client
a stirring appeal to the heart
we as law officers must determine cases
with the head not the heart
tom have we lost
l agree with my learned friend
justice ferris
yes unless he says another however
that it is regrettable
that no precedent has been cited
in support of mr doyles case
however
though no precedent can be found
in lrish law
we can argue
from an analogous english case
ln the crown versus clark 1891
the principle of a parents inalienable right
to his or her children
was enshrined in common law
however
the parents right
could as common law
be overridden by statute
however
yes dear god
unlike the english
we lrish have a written constitution
so that in the words
of evelyn doyles prayer
truth and justice may flourish
l find it unarguably true
as mr barron contends
a parent has
an inalienable and godgiven right
to the society of his children
l therefore find
in favor of the plaintiff mr doyle
we did it
desmond doyle has won
glory be to god
praise be to god
sister weve won
darling child dont you forget me
l wont sister l love you
youll be needing
a housekeeper now wont you
love and glory boys
legal history has been made
evelyns won we can all go home soon
daddy
oh my love good to see you
let me see you
you look gorgeous
dont worry heidi l didnt forget you
lets connect these two together now
some tea too
