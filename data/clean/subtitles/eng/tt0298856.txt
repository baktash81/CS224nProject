remember falling corridor hitting face stairs
l didnt fall stairs
l going tell sister felicity really happened
l thought would get sister brigid trouble
l prayed god would forgive sister brigid hitting
preposterous assertion
earth would good sister hit
l said shouldnt belt annette getting catechism wrong
poor little innocent shame

beautiful car
l would remind however never
law found repugnant lrish constitution
happen today desmond doyle win
l call justice ferris deliver judgment
l persuaded mr wolfes argument behalf minister education
term parent
articles constitution
must held imply parents
contradiction articles
section childrens act
said act repugnant constitution
l therefore find favor defendant minister education
lll strangle ferret one day
lts minister votes go
next judge justice daley must vote desmond
doyles
dont despair child faith
therell rioting going
l agree mr wolfe
minister education times
acted reasonable conscientious manner
within provisions childrens act
l also agree learned honorable friend justice ferris
precedent declaring
lrish statute repugnant constitution
please god grant us however therefore invalid
however despite absence precedent
l find mr barrons argument persuasive
ln event respect learned friend mr ferris
duty supreme court
follow precedent
set
grounds submitted
childrens act section
contravenes parents fundamental godgiven right
society children
therefore repugnant constitution
l find favor plaintiff desmond doyle
marvelous children dont stop praying
supreme court rests shoulders justice lynch kerry man
tension almost unbearable
cant think anything like since tom connollys lastsecond penalty goal
ireland triple crown years ago
amazingly
connolly part desmond doyles team
l impressed desmond doyles diligence
determination rebuilding financial domestic circumstances
wake wifes unfortunate desertion
l noted obvious bonds love affection
doyle daughter evelyn
made deep impression lm sure us
witness stand please dont give us however
however officers law
must guided sentiment
though mr barron made moving powerful plea
behalf client
stirring appeal heart
law officers must determine cases head heart
tom lost
l agree learned friend justice ferris
yes unless says another however regrettable
precedent cited support mr doyles case
however
though precedent found lrish law
argue analogous english case
ln crown versus clark
principle parents inalienable right children
enshrined common law
however
parents right
could common law overridden statute
however yes dear god
unlike english
lrish written constitution
words evelyn doyles prayer
truth justice may flourish
l find unarguably true mr barron contends
parent inalienable godgiven right
society children
l therefore find favor plaintiff mr doyle

desmond doyle

darling child dont forget
l wont sister l love
youll needing housekeeper wont
love glory boys
