my own daughter 
you obviously know sweet f a  about it 
where did she meet him  ln the pub 
no  you re the one who spends all his time
there  no wonder she got sick of you 
 l treated her well 
 yeah 
l never raised a hand in anger to her once

maurice  give him the ball back

good day  gentlemen 
l m lnspector logan of the spcc 
mrs  daisley  your mother in law  l believe 
told us of your plight 
the spcc 
the society
for prevention of cruelty to children 
that s correct 
ls she saying
that l ve been cruel to my kids 
not at all  mr  doyle 
we only have the children s welfare at heart 
to lose their mother at this age
can have a traumatizing effect 
how s that any business of yours 
l m here to help you 
l understand you ve no income
to support your family 
 correct 
 yeah 
do you have any female relatives
to call upon 
maureen  des  mother  died a long time ago 
then  mr  doyle  you have no choice but
to approach the authorities for assistance 
l will arrange for the sisters to call 
we don t need your charity 
you have no job
and no mother for your children 
he s right  son 
all right 
send in the nuns 
sit still 
but l don t like cabbage 
lt is very good for you 
eat it up  l don t want to hear about it 
you are a painter and decorator by trade 
but your attempts to secure employment   
since your wife s departure
have been unsuccessful 
yes  sir  your honor 
but it s only been a couple of weeks 
and there s a big job coming up
at the robert west house   
but that s not until the end of march 
and you have no other source of revenue 
sir  my father  henry 
who s sitting here  and myself   
we re setting up a tour of the dublin pubs 
surely that will represent expenditure
rather than income 
no  your honor 
we ll be playing music for money 
my father was a professional musician 
he played for radio eireann
until retirement age 
dessie has a fine voice  your honor 
l m sure he has 
but you won t be able to support your family
on that alone  will you 
maybe not  your honor 
under section 10
of the children s act  1941    
l hereby rule that
until there is a significant improvement   
in the domestic and financial circumstances
of desmond doyle   
his two sons  dermot and maurice   
will be placed in care
of the christian brothers in kilkenny   
and his daughter  evelyn doyle   
will be committed
to st  joseph s school in dublin

granddad  please don t leave me here 
l don t want to stay here with the sisters 
l hate them 
they re the brides of christ

you dirty little tinker 
mr  doyle 
sister  please don t cut her hair 
lt s her father s pride and joy 
thank you  sister brigid

one large nun should be enough
to scrub one small girl 
of course  sister felicity 
l was just making sure
she didn t throw another tantrum 
she s a willful one 
wasn t our lord a willful one  too 
l m sure she ll be fine  won t you 
thank you  sister brigid

l m probably hallucinating 
bless you  john 
once again 
until we achieve unity and harmony 
where do we say our night prayers 
not in the bed   
not under the bed  but by the bed 
then kneel by your beds and give thanks 
get a move on  evelyn 
you re keeping us all waiting 
we do not lie like that  on our stomach

l will check every night
that you are sleeping in this position 
we must not tempt lucifer 
no more talking  good night  girls 
good night  sister 
mr  doyle  family law in this jurisdiction   
is a cozy conspiracy between
the catholic church and the lrish state 
they re in cahoots 
you re saying that you re all frightened
if you take them on  you ll never work again 
something like that 
l suggest you come back to me when
your circumstances are more favorable   
and l ll see what l can do 
on the banks of the roses 
my love and i sat down
and i took out my fiddle 
for to play my love a tune
in the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said
  oh  johnny  lovely johnny 
why d you leave me   
oh  when i was a young man 
i heard my father say
that he d rather see me dead
and buried in the clay
sooner than be married to any runaway
on the lovely sweet banks of the roses
on the banks of the roses 
my love and i sat down
and i took out my fiddle 
for to play my love a tune
in the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said
  oh  johnny  lovely johnny 
why d you leave me   
  oh  lord  l vow never more to offend thee   
  and carefully
to avoid the occasions of sin   
   and the meadows they are gay
and me and my true love
will sit and sport and play
on the lovely sweet banks of the roses
on the banks of the roses 
my love and i sat down
and i took out my fiddle 
for to play my love a tune
in the middle of the tune
 look who s back 
 straight from chicago 
how s my favorite lrish colleen 
 l m well  how are you 
 l m great 
who s your man in the sharp suit 
over there 
how should l know 
he looks like a yank 
maybe he s a friend of hers 
maybe he s a chemist 
lf l can regain your attention for a moment   
we ll have requests 
apart from nobody s child 
we re not fond of that now 
 boys of wexford 
 whistling gypsies 
 are you still not talking to grandma 
 no  l ll never speak to that woman 
she blames your father for everything 
may she rot in hell  the old witch 
jesus says we should forgive
those who trespassed against us 
lt s in the   our father   
 grandma  would you like a fruit gum 
 thanks  love 
granddad gave them to me 
l won t bother then  love 
listen  love 
there is something you must tell him 
lt s really warm 
   stuff it  will you 
good girl 
grandma s got a letter from sydney 
sidney  who 
sydney in australia 
 australia 
 lt s from mommy  she s in australia 
she didn t give her address 
but it said sydney on the postmark thing 
l might have guessed 
she always had the wanderlust 
your mother 
 grandma said it s hot in australia 
 lt is 
you can tell her it s not as hot
as the place where her daughter will end up 
okay 
 that s it 
 still no carriages  dad 
no  son 
still no carriages 
  dear daddy  it s great news that you have
such a good job  doing up that old house 
  i miss you and the boys
and granddad very much   
  and i hope we can get back together soon 
  what did granddad mean
when he told me to tell grandma daisley   
  that he hopes mommy
meets a great white in australia 
  i think it s a kangaroo 
but mary thinks it s a koala bear 
  i like most of the nuns here 
  sister felicity is nice and kind   
  and so is sister theresa 
  but sister brigid is very scary    
ls god good  just and merciful 
yes  sister 
  yes   isn t the catechism answer  is it 
what does the catechism say 
lt says    
l ve had enough of you  annette farrell 
now   
god is infinitely good   
infinitely just   
and infinitely  
what are you saying to me  child 
l don t think you should do that  sister 
lf god is infinitely merciful 
he wouldn t want you to do that 
you dare to question me about god 
lnsolent brat 
right  outside 
never   
never talk to me like that again 
where s my daughter  evelyn doyle 
do you have an appointment 
l don t need an appointment
to see my own daughter 
 who are you 
 l m sister brigid 
are you 
lf you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again   
l will tear you   
limb from limb 
now  where is she 
ln the refectory  on the first floor 
right 
 you shouldn t be on the premises 
 l ve come for my daughter 
 you must leave 
 l m not leaving without her 
 you know that s impossible 
 l m having her back  where is she 
you cannot barge in here  
there s no bloody laws in lreland
that will keep her away from me 
how dare you use language like that
in front of me 
don t speak to me like that  l will not have it 
daddy  don t fight 
don t fight with sister theresa 
lt s all right  love  don t worry 
can l see her 
not if you re going to run off with her 
that ll just get you arrested 
okay  l promise 
l just wanna hold her for a second 
l give you my word  all right 
evelyn  your daddy s here to see you 
lt s good to see you 
daddy  have you come to take me home 
yes 
l ll be taking you home soon  pet 
very soon 
l hear you re doing well at your new job 
my circumstances have improved 
as you would say 
so  you ll take the case  then 
you ve been drinking  haven t you 
l can smell it off your breath 
since we re not planning on kissing 
l don t see a problem 
lt s not going to help our case   
if the court thinks
you re drinking your pay packet 
our case 
that means you ll take it  then 
who is this gobshite 
this   gobshite  
is the minister for education 
he s claiming we require the consent
of your wife for the release of your kids 
how can we get her consent
when she s disappeared 
even her pudding faced old mother s
got no address 
lt s the law  yours is a unique case 
normally  the wife would be deceased 
she ran out on her kids 
what kind of mother would do that 
we could argue that she s emotionally
incapable of bringing up the children   
but l m afraid all of that is 
strictly speaking  irrelevant 
the law still requires her consent   
no matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved 
to hell with the law 
that attitude will get us nowhere  desmond 
l ve done everything l was asked to do 
that district judge or justice
didn t tell me l d need my wife s consent 
he definitely misdirected you 
which gives us a useful basis for a start 
but it may not be material enough   
for a challenge in law 
as there are no precedents for your case 
we ll make the bloody precedent 
l want justice 
the law and justice
are two entirely different things 
jesus  you can say that again 
of course  l m only a solicitor 
l m not entitled to speak
in a court case like this 
we need a barrister 
and they re very expensive 
l don t care how much it costs 
l ll work round the clock  if l have to 
to fight church and state
is to fight goliath 
david beat goliath  in the book l read 
 lt s a first edition 
 ls it 
yeats 
lt ll be grand  l tell you 
l ve got it all worked out  dad 
don t worry about it 
 get us another pint 
 you ll have another one 
l will 
make mine a large one  bernadette 
a pint for desmond 
you two are knocking them back tonight 
poor dessie s going through
a rough time lately 
aren t we all fond of a drink 
that s right  henry 
you can t hold that against a man  can you 
that lad of yours is going through hell 
 l think he s drinking to forget 
 you re right  fergal 
l wonder if our american friend knows
the one thing worse than drinking to forget 
 do you know what that is  son 
 worse than drinking to forget  no 
forgetting to drink 
l ll drink to that 
that wife of his
didn t know the meaning of the word   love   
love 
lt s strange  the greeks
have all these different words for love 
  philia      agapi      eros   
we have just the one 
we use the same word
for our nearest and dearest   
as we do for a packet of cigarettes 
 lt s interesting  isn t it 
 l think it s very interesting 
did you know that eskimos
have over 40 different words for snow 
 ls that a fact 
 lt s true  the wife told me that 
she should know  she s frigid 
you re an awful man 
 l keep telling you not to drink and drive 
 l m not drinking and driving 
l drank before l drove 
 l don t think this is a good idea 
 lt s the only way  dad 
lt s the only way 
 l can see the dormitory  there 
 we should come back some other time 
no  l ve got to rescue the poor little mite 
right  we ve come this far 
jesus 
they ve greased the top of the wall 
mind yourself  son 
bernadette 
you re drenched 
that ll be the rain 
you re one to talk 
l just    
come in 
 sit yourself down 
 lt s okay  l m not staying 
all right  suit yourself 
l ll get you a towel  a clean one 
this place needs a good cleaning 
lt s got more empties than fergal s 
looking for a towel here somewhere  god 
here we go 
there it is 
you can have it  if you want 
as a reward
for putting me in touch with your brother 
l had no idea you could do this 
there s lots of things l can do
that you don t know about 
l m sure there are 
we re saving up for a housekeeper 
you know anyone who s suitable 
lt s not a housekeeper you need 
lt s a barkeeper 
you know what your problem is 
you think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle   
and everything will be grand 
lt s time you grew up 
 you like my cheeky twinkle  then 
 you drink too much 
ridiculous  l ve got a lot on my mind 
 like a trip to scotland with your kids 
 what 
how do you know about that 
because the tickets fell out of your coat 
an adult and three kids 
who could that be  l wonder 
l knew you were up to something 
you big idiot 
don t call me a big idiot 
l ll bet you want someone smooth 
like the yank 
whose jokes you laugh at all the time
like he s oscar bloody wilde 
nick s funny  and he s more of a ladies  man
than oscar ever was 
l get the message 
you fancy him 
don t tell me who l fancy 
that s for me to decide 
what l don t want is a drunkard   
who has some mad notion about
sneaking off with his kids to scotland 
why should you care 
what business is it of yours 
because l don t want
to have to visit you in prison 
has anybody ever told you
you re a fine woman 
lots of men 
some of them weren t even married 
 not until you give me the tickets 
 what 
give me the ferry tickets 
l ll take them back and get you a refund 
jesus  woman 
you drive a hard bargain  where are they 
here you go 
 thanks 
 l always get sick on the ferry  anyway 
 l just think  you know  you and l  
 do you really think l d kiss you now 
lt d be like kissing a soggy beer mat 
 but you just said  
 no  l said you have to give up the drink 
for god s sake 
that s the hardest thing to do 
the second hardest 
getting your family back is the hardest 
oh  of all the money that ever i had
i spent it in good company
and all the harm that ever i ve done
alas it was to none but me
and if i had money enough to spend
and leisure time to sit awhile
there is a fair maid in this town
who sorely has my heart beguiled
her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
i own she has my heart in thrall
so  fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all
good man  des 
lovely  good man 
thank you very much  everyone 
you ve been wonderful  god bless you all 
we hope to see you again next week 
okay  god bless  good night

henry  it s father o malley 
lf you can hear me 
say the act of contrition 
amen 
look  angel rays 
what s angel rays  love 
lt s granddad letting us know
he s watching over us 
he s our guardian angel 
he told me all about angel rays 
good old dad 
l knew he wouldn t leave us 
 good morning  miss gilhooly 
 mr  doyle 
 didn t you get the letter 
 what letter 
the one canceling this appointment 
l didn t get any letter 
l ve taken this morning
especially off work to see him 
this is my family we re talking about 
where is he 
jesus 
jesus  mary and joseph 
lilo  higgi  come on 
sorry  sir  lt s a trespasser 
lt s all right  this is a client of mine 
 a client  sir 
 yes 
we have an appointment 
please let us know in the future  sir 
if you re expecting visitors 
what the hell are you smirking at 
do you think this is funny 
do you think you can cancel appointments
and treat people like dirt 
 mr  doyle  
 l wasn t talking to you  yank 
all you re good for s wearing sharp suits 
doing fancy deals   
and trying to get hands on our women 
 and our fish 
 desmond  be reasonable 
l m sorry l missed our appointment   
but there s really nothing more
l can do for you anymore 
really 
your being sorry
isn t gonna get my kids back  now  is it 
l m sure the yank here is having great fun   
seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish we ve got over here 
but ask yourself this  mr  big shot 
what if it was your family 
wouldn t you fight tooth and nail
to get them back 
or are you just another
heartless  gutless bastard 
congratulations 
you just found yourself a lawyer 
ls that a fact 
who 
me 
so  you re not a chemist  then 
how come you can work over here
if you re a yank 
actually  l m lrish 
l was born and reared in kilkenny
till l was 9 
then we emigrated to the states
and l subsequently came back here   
to study law at ucd 
so  he s qualified to plead in lrish courts 
does my being a yank bother you 
not at all  l like yanks 
most of them were lrish
to begin with  anyway 
but l can t afford to pay you fancy money 
l m not doing this for the money 
you ll just have to raise enough
to cover our costs 
right 
l really appreciate your help  so l do 
we ll do our best for you 
 right  cheerio 
 cheerio 
 we ll do our best 
 we re in this together  my friend 
do you think l ll take this on
with any other solicitor 
we have no chance 
l don t know why you re taking it on 
because l know what he s going through 
through no one s fault but my own 
l lost my own kids in that divorce 
 you don t realize what we re up against 
 l do realize what we re up against 
what possible chance
do you think you have 
you and mr    
 mr  doyle 
 mr  doyle  here 
a painter and what  decorator 
master tradesman  to you 
apart from anything else 
it will be prohibitively expensive 
only if we lose 
 you ll lose  mr    
 beattie 
you ll lose  because
if you were to win this case   
the whole basis of family law
would be undermined 
and believe me  gentlemen 
that will not be allowed to happen 
we thank you for your advice  mr    
shall we 
by the way  minister   
your paintwork s shite 
what we really need
is an expert in family law to keep us right 
 you know 
 l thought you were an expert 
l haven t done family law in 20 years 
l ve only a working knowledge 
you mean you don t know what you re
talking about  can t you read some books 
lt s not quite as simple as that 
lt s a very tricky area 
we ve still got the problem that everyone s
terrified of taking on the establishment 
what was the name of that guy
that lectured us about family law 
 remember  the real character 
 tom connolly 
there was a connolly who played rugby
for lreland until his cartilage went 
l think he did a bit of law in his spare time 
would that be him 
gentlemen  l m flattered by your attentions 
but l retired two years ago 
ln short  l can no longer face
speaking in court 
sir  you wouldn t have to speak in court 
mr  barron here will do all the speaking 
but frankly  sir  he needs your help 
my family law is so rusty 
even if you could just come on board
as a consultant 
l m sorry to say this to you  mr  doyle 
but they ll put forward the best people
to put the case for the state 
the best that money can buy 
that s why they hated me 
l wouldn t be bought 
l believe that if there is a god 
he ll step in to help us 
l m touched by your faith 
this is the only holy spirit
l ve found to be of any practical assistance 
slainte 
you were a big hero to me as a boy 
mr  connolly 
to my dad  too 
he took me to all your games 
you see that photo there 
l was at that game 
the one where you got injured 
that was the beginning of the end 
when that big brute of a fullback
did my cartilage in 
he was english  of course  the bastard 
still  before l left the field   
l managed to boot him where his balls
would have been  if he d any 
fair play to you 
anyway  lads   
your case is interesting 
hopeless  but interesting 
you really think it s hopeless 
this case is what l used to call
  a real st  jude   
why st  jude 
because st  jude
is the patron saint of hopeless cases 
as l recall  sir  you ve won
quite a few st  judes in your time 
l suppose l have 
retirement must be excruciatingly boring
for a man like yourself 
gentlemen   
l propose a toast 
justice and st  jude 
i am desmond doyle   
father of evelyn doyle  who s been held
in your care without my consent 
l request the return
of my daughter  forthwith 
mr  doyle  you cannot have your daughter 
ln that case  my solicitor 
mr  michael beattie   
will present you
with a writ of habeas corpus   
drafted by my counselor 
mr  nicholas barron 
duly presented 
duly witnessed 
thank you  sister  that s all we need 
 so  it went well  then 
 lt went like a dream 
desmond remembered all his lines 
and spoke them beautifully 
laurence olivier had better watch out 
 you didn t attack a nun  then 
 l did not 
l m learning the rules of the game 
 what do we do now 
 we wait 
no  that s just what they want us to do 
they ll do nothing for months
and hope that we ll go away 
nothing will happen
unless we force their hand 
l ll give my old friend hugh canning a ring 
hugh canning 
 but he s a sports commentator 
 mostly  yes 
but he does a bit of everything 
may god grant you justice 
 take this and run along  girl 
 thank you  sister 
what is it 
 eileen  come here 
 what s going on 
  desmond doyle  a painter and decorator
from fatima mansions  dublin   
  is a loving father who just wants
to spend time with his children   
  but the powers that be won t let him 
  desmond s rosy cheeked
little daughter  evelyn      
at least they ve set a date for the hearing 
that s the first step 
a little bit of gentle pressure did the trick 
we had to give the minister
a kick up his fat ass 
what do we do now 
you should smarten yourself up 
the press might want photos of you 
try combing your hair  occasionally 
shave 
look as if you haven t just fallen out of bed 
use me as a role model if you want to 
and buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court 
 new shoes 
 yes 
l ve known judges who judge a man s
character by the state of his shoes 
 here they come  let s get a shot 
 especially of the little girl 
 come on 
 get the three of them together  now 
 daddy  l scored a goal in gaelic 
 daddy 
my loves  you look wonderful 
 daddy  l like your new shoes 
 thanks  evelyn 
ferris hasn t changed much since l knew
him  the torn faced old poultice 
he s always looked like the turin shroud 
we used to call him   ferris the ferret   
which is an insult to the rodent 
mr  barron  you re representing
the petitioner  desmond doyle 
yes  my lord 
we contend the judge at the district court
hearing of january 10 of this year   
misdirected the petitioner 
mr  desmond doyle 
l refer you to the notes of that case
wherein the judge expressed his hope   
that mr  doyle would not have to leave
his children in care for too long 
sadly  that has not been the case here 
the children s act of 1941 clearly states   
that unless the spouse is deceased 
which is not the case here   
then the consent
of both parents is required 
this is the basis of our case  your lordship 
provision of the children s act   
must be understood in its literal 
grammatical meaning 
  both parents   means exactly that 
l therefore find against the petitioner 
desmond doyle 
thank you  judge hall 
judge mclaughlin 
with some reluctance 
l conclude that l  too  must find against   
the petitioner s application
and uphold the minister s decision 
 we ve lost 
 that s absolutely ridiculous 
 order in court 
 you rotten louses  let his babies go home 
silence  or l shall have the court cleared 
 silence in court 
 he s loving this  the rodent 
lt is incontrovertible   
that section 10 
subsection 1 of the children s act  1941    
requires the consent of both parents 
ln the absence of such consent 
evelyn doyle and her brothers   
will remain in custody
until they are 16 years of age 
daddy 
furthermore  this court has decided   
that since the children s act
is capable of no other interpretation   
any appeal
would be a waste of the court s time 
right of appeal is therefore denied 
 no  you flea faced rat 
 who said that 
was that you  connolly 
this is hugh canning 
the man who broke the doyle story   
covering this sensational new development 
leave them alone 
get your hands off my kids 
 leave me alone 
 daddy 
unbelievable scenes here at the high court 
l ve never seen anything like it 
desmond doyle struggles with the gardai
for possession of his children 
a pitiful scene to watch 
and who wouldn t sympathize with a father
in this situation 
daddy 
children 
daddy  please 
ls desmond doyle here 
he s sitting over there  in the booth 
sorry to interrupt you 
l m honest joe o leary  racecourse bookie 
l owned the book
on the outcome of your court case 
 the punters backed you heavy 
 great 
l didn t feel right in keeping this   
so l want you to have it 
jesus 
my god 
lt s only  600  so l thought
it might go towards your court costs 
l don t know what to say  mr  o leary 
you don t have to say anything  mr  doyle 
you see  l grew up in an orphanage 
l wish my dad had your guts 
good luck to you  good night  all 
good night 
we re organizing a race next month 
 the desmond doyle benefit sweepstake 
 great 
 put your money on slippery sam 
 slippery sam 
grand man  good night  now  god bless 
this calls for a celebration 
another round for the table 
make mine a lemonade 
what  a lemonade  are you all right  son 
no  l m feeling terrible 
but maybe it s time l tried to feel better 
jerry 
keep your eye on the ball  son 
dig it out 
 dig it out 
 thomas 
 good reflexes  you ll need them 
 back in the lrish strip  l see 
lt helps me to see things more clearly 
did you play rugby yourself  nick 
no  l understand it s kind of
a neanderthal version of american football 
ls that what you think 
hut  hut 
hopeless 
so  anyway   
why have l invited you to this sacred turf 
 l was kind of wondering that 
 so was l 
me  too  lt s not exactly
how l planned to spend my morning 
you know   
when my cartilage went
and they were taking me off on a stretcher   
l looked up and l saw this father   
holding his little child up on his shoulders 
they thought l was a hero 
but you know something 
l envied that man so much  he was my hero 
all desmond wants
is to hold his kids up on his shoulders 
we can help you to that 
but how  tom  there is no right of appeal 
ferris made sure of that 
we don t need an appeal 
not if we bring an entirely new case   
based on an entirely different
principle of law 
but we re automatically barred
from bringing the same facts   
before the same court
that s already heard them 
be it the district courts or high courts 
we ve nowhere else to go 
there is somewhere else to go 
the supreme court 
the supreme court 
we can t go there with this 
they won t hear a case like this 
they only deal with big stuff 
yes 
like laws that contravene
the lrish constitution   
which l ve been reading 
wait a second  hold on 
has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds 
no 
 what chance do you think we ve got 
 who knows 
but l ve seen games won by teams
without any hope at all 
bloody hopeless 
good evening 
and welcome to the very first edition   
of conversations with canning   
on this marvelous new medium
of the television 
for those of you who listen to my show
on the wireless   
i hope i m even better looking
than you thought 
now  many of you   
will remember these sad headlines
of last month  
  desmond s despair    
desmond certainly isn t despairing
at the moment 
ln fact  he s sitting here  right beside me   
in our ultramodern television studio 
and he s got new reasons for being hopeful 
haven t you desmond 
yes 
it s okay  you don t have to shout 
we can hear you fine 
fair enough 
doesn t he look handsome
when he smartens himself up 
he s learning  l ve always told him
he should model himself on me 
   that your daughter evelyn
and your two boys are being held illegally 
yes 
and you ll be taking on
some pretty top people 
yeah  we re gonna call
the minister of education as a witness 
and i ve often asked myself 
  what drives desmond doyle   
 desmond 
 i love my children 
i m sick of saying goodbye to them
all the time 
i just don t want them
to spend their whole childhood crying 
 has a date been set for the trial 
 not yet 
but l want my kiddies home for christmas 
home for christmas 
that s an inspiring note on which to end   
this little conversation with canning 
holy jesus 
this thing will never catch on 
   and we ll be following your case closely 
and now   
the beautiful strains of the irish harp 
some good news  some bad news 
first  the good news  they ve set a date 
 second week in december 
 great 
lt s a great time to have a trial 
 even judges are sentimental at christmas 
 not all of them  l m afraid 
guess who we ve got again 
 ferris the ferret 
 yes 
he s been elevated
to the supreme court  apparently 
lousy luck 
luck s got nothing to do with it 
lf you ask me  the state s planted him there
in an attempt to scupper us 
come on  eat up  there s plenty more 
here  have a nice big fat sausage 
we re gonna make you lovely and lazy 
might slow you up a bit 
sorry  sam  nothing for you 
you re gonna get your feast after the race 
they re off  and it s a close packed field
at the start now 
come on 
stay up there  my boy 
stay up  yes 
they re battling it out  neck and neck 
slippery sam s edged in front 
and as they come around the bend   
slippery sam putting on
a tremendous effort 
o leary  how did you know 
let s say l knew he was hungry for a win 
 good man 
 desmond 
the readers of the irish times
have voted you the man of the year 
 how do you feel about that 
 l m honored  who was second 
 the pope 
 fair play to him 
come on  bernadette 
 let s go and collect our winnings 
 right you are 
desmond  l ve got a few bob  myself 
 how s it going with bernadette  then 
 great 
ln fact  l asked her to come back
to america with me  when the case is over 
really 
what did she say 
she said she d think about it 
l asked her to move in with me 
 really 
 yeah 
what did she say 
she said she d think about it 
 who knows what she ll do 
 fatima mansions versus the usa 
tough choice 
sister  why don t you cut my hair 
you ve cut everybody else s 
because they are not likely
to have their photos all over the newspaper 
why should that make a difference 
l don t think that l should be treated special
just because my daddy s getting famous 
but didn t your daddy tell us
not to cut your hair 
yes  and didn t he tell you
to let me go home 
you didn t take a blind bit of notice 
look    
lf l were to cut your hair 
sister theresa would not be amused 
l ll explain to my daddy if he gets cross 
and who will explain it to sister theresa
if she gets cross 
you  sister 
hugh canning reporting to you  live 
from outside the supreme court   
on the first day of this historic case 
a grand  official car has just arrived 
lt s the minister of education 
looks as if he d rather be
somewhere else  this day 
this must be what soldiers feel like
just before battle 
 nervous 
 nervous 
l m only trying to make legal history   
by doing something that s never been
done before  and if l fail  l m unemployable 
but if you win  son  you re immortal 
you re in the history books 
and you ll help take this country
out of the dark ages 
rosary beads 
l thought you weren t religious 
l m not 
when the verdict comes in 
these are for counting the score 
remember  nick  speak from your heart 
l ll sit up in the gallery 
out of the ferret s eye line 
thanks  tom 
 good luck  son 
 thanks for everything 
right 
let the battle commence 
 ls this all right 
 lt s fine 
minister  three times now
you have refused   
to reconsider the case of desmond doyle 
ls that correct 
lt is  a decision subsequently upheld
by the high court 
yes  but the grounds for our action now
are fundamentally different  is that not so 
l suppose it is 
could you tell us  minister  to whom or
to what do you owe your eminent position 
pardon 
your job  sir  who appointed you 
objection  your lordship 
this is irrelevant  not to say insolent 
my lord   
counsel for the plaintiff
has indeed failed to establish relevance 
l am about to do so  your lordship 
l hope so  mr  barron  proceed 
as minister for education  you are
a government appointee  are you not 
of course l am 
what is the document on which
the lrish government s authority   
and therefore your authority  rests 
the lrish constitution 
have you read it recently 
objection  your lordship 
this is insufferable 
counsel for the plaintiff is not displaying
due deference to the witness  my lord 
objection sustained 
be careful  mr  barron 
the witness must be treated with respect 
yes  my lord 
l would be grateful
if you could read out to the court   
those short extracts
from the lrish constitution   
which  we have established 
is the basis for your authority 
  article 1  
  the lrish constitution shall be consistent
with the law of god 
  article 41  
  a parent and child have a fundamental
and god given right   
  to the enjoyment of each other s
mutual society 
  article 42 
  a blameless parent shall not be deprived
of his or her right   
  to direct the child s education   
ls it fair to say
that by consistently rejecting   
desmond doyle s application
for the return of his children   
you have denied him
that fundamental and god given right 
would it be fair to say that  minister 
we are waiting for your response 
that is a possibility 
yes 
and is it also a possibility   
that you have contravened
article 42 of the constitution   
by denying desmond doyle
the right to direct his children s education 
yes 
that is also a possibility 
 that is what we are here to determine 
 exactly 
and we will so determine 
good boy 
no further questions 
well done 
article 42 of the constitution   
refers to a blameless parent 
and we contend that this concept
is tacit also in article 41  
that it is the blameless parent   
who has a fundamental  god given right
to his children s society 
this   
does not apply to desmond doyle 
he came barging in  unannounced 
to the main building 
he was in a terrible rage   
and he looked like a man
possessed by the devil 
objection  your lordship 
the witness is demonizing my client 
not so  my lord  the sister
is merely expressing herself vividly   
using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation 
objection overruled  proceed  sister 
he was like a man possessed 
he shouted at me    where is my daughter   
 he yelled at the top of his voice 
 and what did you say to him  sister 
 l asked him if he had an appointment 
 and what did he say 
he grabbed me by the throat
and almost choked the life out of me 
throttling me  he was 
he said if l didn t tell him
where his daughter was   
he would tear me limb from limb 
those were his exact words 
 l thought he was going to murder me 
 and what did he do then  sister 
l told him where the girl was
and he ran upstairs   
repeating his threats as he did so 
my neck was black and blue
from where his thumbs had been 
did you report
this deplorable incident to anyone 
yes  l phoned the police 
they will confirm every word 
sister theresa decided  out of the charity
of her heart  not to press charges 
no further questions  my lord 
have l messed it up for us all  then 
you may have 
we re just gonna have to show
that this was an isolated incident   
not part of a pattern of behavior 
 l hope that was the only such incident 
 of course it was 
apart from the time you tried to punch
father o malley at fergal s 
that 
 and when you tried to kidnap your kids 
 yes  but l was drunk on both occasions 
for god s sake  don t try to use
drunkenness as a defense 
lt doesn t impress them 
haven t you heard the phrase 
  as sober as a judge   
so  you see  your lordship   
l only shook sister brigid when
l found out she d beaten up my little girl 
 l object  your lordship 
 not as much as l object 
l object to anyone laying a finger
on my kids 
objection upheld 
that s mr  wolfe s objection 
not yours  mr  doyle 
continue with your testimony 
wouldn t any father have done what l did 
evelyn s face was all battered and bruised 
silence in court 
even as a very dubious kind of catholic   
who finds himself throttling a nun   
you must know that the fundamental
building block of our society   
is the family   
whose very model is the holy family   
jesus  mary and joseph 
how can you  as a single father
and as a catholic   
possibly claim to bring up your children
without a mother 
there is absolutely no precedent for it   
in the religion
in which you allegedly believe 
cat got your tongue   
mr  doyle 
there is    
there is a precedent  as you d like to call it 
what are you saying 
the fundamental building block of our faith
is not the holy family   
it s the holy trinity 
the father  the son and the holy spirit 
when my mother died   
my father brought us up on his own   
with only the holy spirit to guide him 
he used to say the holy spirit was love 
doesn t the holy bible say 
     faith  hope and love   
  but the greatest of these is love   
l ve given up the drink 
l ve worked all the hours god sends 
l ve become a better person
to try and fill myself with the holy spirit   
so l can bring my kids up
surrounded by love 
that s all l can do 
no man can do more 
silence in court 
silence 
no further questions 
your lordship  we would request
that the court is recalled   
when we have subpoenaed
our next witness   
evelyn doyle 
the bastards 
they ll intimidate the little soul 
lord jesus  l have to go to the big court
soon  to answer some questions 
please let my daddy win 
l know you re testing him 
but l think he s getting very tired 
lord  please let him win 
amen 
 daddy 
 hello  love 
your hair 
l told them to cut it 
don t you like it 
lt s lovely  pet 
lt suits you 
you ve got your new shoes on again 
you ve got to go now 
bye  daddy 
silence in court 
the court will draw itself to order 
now  evelyn doyle   
do you remember the time in st  joseph s 
when you tripped in the corridor   
and bashed your face 
when you fell down the stairs 
no  sir 
think back to last march 
apparently  sister felicity
had to give you some aspirin 
lsn t that correct 
 yes  sir  she did 
 and why was that 
because my face was all swollen
and black and blue 
because you had fallen down the stairs 
no  that s what sister brigid said 
according to sister felicity 
you made no attempt   
to deny the fact that you had fallen
down the stairs and bruised your face 
you didn t say otherwise  did you 
no 
l mean  yes 
l m all mixed up 
so  what really happened   
was exactly what sister brigid said
had happened 
and you made up a story
in your letter to your father   
because you wanted to get out
of st  joseph s   
and you thought a little lie would help 
l didn t lie  l didn t make it up 
l know it must be a frightening
experience for you  evelyn   
being a little girl in a big court like this 
you must try not to be scared  even though
you re alone in front of all these people 
l m not scared anymore  your lordship 
and l m not alone 
my granddad is here with me 
see  he s letting us know he s here 
your lordship  the child s grandfather
died some months ago 
she obviously has a very   
vivid imagination 
now  child   
let me ask you one last time   
do you remember falling in the corridor
and hitting your face on the stairs 
no  l didn t fall on the stairs 
l was going to tell sister felicity
what really happened   
but then l thought
it would only get sister brigid into trouble 
so  l prayed that god
would forgive sister brigid for hitting me 
this is a preposterous assertion 
why on earth
would the good sister hit you 
because l said she shouldn t belt annette
for getting her catechism wrong 
poor little innocent  shame on you 
she was better off with desmond doyle 
l can see that now 
 wait till l get you outside 
 silence in court 
evelyn doyle   
do you expect this court to believe
that after she did that to you   
 you prayed for her 
 yes  l did 
l put it to you that you are lying 
lying is a sin
against the eighth commandment 
  thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor   
l m surprised you don t know that 
if you re a lawyer 
sister brigid told this court
the truth of the matter   
that she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs 
no  that s not true 
hope she goes to confession soon 
 wanna hear the prayer l said last night 
 we do not 
not so  mr  wolfe 
lt is material to the court s evaluation
of the child s character 
evelyn  let us hear your prayer  please 
  lord god   
  you guide the universe
with wisdom and love 
  hear the prayer we make to you
for our country   
  the beautiful country of lreland 
  through the honesty of our citizens 
and the wisdom of those who govern us   
  may lasting peace be delivered   
  and truth and justice flourish   
amen 
 she s a credit to you 
 thank you 
thank you  evelyn  you may step down 
the great day has finally arrived 
the day desmond doyle and his kids 
and indeed the whole of lreland   
has been waiting for 
the day when desmond finds out 
once and for all   
whether he will get his kids back 
sister  why couldn t me and the boys
go to court today 
because they don t want a repeat
of the scenes they had last time 
the lord mayor of dublin has just
appeared in his official limousine   
and a beautiful car it is  too 
l would remind you  however 
that never before   
has a law been found repugnant
to the lrish constitution   
and that has to happen today 
if desmond doyle is to win 
l now call on justice ferris
to deliver his judgment 
l am persuaded by mr  wolfe s argument
on behalf of the minister for education   
that the term   parent     
in articles 41 and 42 of the constitution   
must be held to imply both parents 
there is no contradiction
between those articles   
and section 10 of the children s act   
and said act
is not repugnant to the constitution 
l  therefore  find in favor of the defendant 
the minister for education 
l ll strangle that ferret one day 
lt s 1 0 to the minister  with 2 votes to go 
the next judge  justice daley 
must vote for desmond   
or it s all over for the doyles 
don t despair  my child  have faith 
   or there ll be rioting going on 
l agree with mr  wolfe   
that the minister for education has 
at all times   
acted in a reasonable
and conscientious manner   
within the provisions of the children s act 
l also agree with my learned
and honorable friend  justice ferris   
that there is no precedent for declaring   
an lrish statute
repugnant to the constitution   
 please god  grant us a   however   
    and therefore invalid 
however  despite the absence
of precedent   
l find mr  barron s argument persuasive 
ln any event  with respect to
my learned friend  mr  ferris   
it is the duty of the supreme court   
not only to follow precedent   
but to set it 
on the grounds submitted   
that the children s act 1941  section 10   
contravenes a parent s fundamental 
god given right   
to the society of his children   
and is therefore repugnant
to the constitution   
l find in favor of the plaintiff 
desmond doyle 
marvelous  children 
don t you stop praying now 
   the supreme court  now it all rests on the
shoulders of justice lynch  a kerry man 
the tension in here is almost unbearable 
i can t think of anything like it  since
tom connolly s last second penalty goal   
that won ireland the triple crown 
30 years ago 
and amazingly   
connolly is now part
of desmond doyle s team 
l have been impressed
by desmond doyle s diligence   
and determination in rebuilding
his financial and domestic circumstances   
in the wake of
his wife s unfortunate desertion 
l have noted  too 
the obvious bonds of love and affection   
between doyle and his daughter  evelyn   
who made a deep impression on me 
and l m sure  on all of us   
 in the witness stand 
 please  no  don t give us a   however   
however  we are officers of the law   
and must not be guided by sentiment 
though mr  barron
made a moving and powerful plea   
on behalf of his client   
a stirring appeal to the heart   
we  as law officers  must determine cases
with the head  not the heart 
tom  have we lost 
l agree with my learned friend 
justice ferris   
 yes  unless he says another   however   
    that it is regrettable   
that no precedent has been cited
in support of mr  doyle s case 
however   
though no precedent can be found
in lrish law   
we can argue
from an analogous english case 
ln the crown versus clark  1891    
the principle of a parent s inalienable right
to his or her children   
was enshrined in common law 
however   
   the parent s right   
could  as common law 
be overridden by statute 
 however   
 yes  dear god 
   unlike the english   
we lrish have a written constitution   
so that  in the words
of evelyn doyle s prayer 
  truth and justice may flourish   
l find it unarguably true 
as mr  barron contends   
a parent has
an inalienable and god given right   
to the society of his children 
l therefore find
in favor of the plaintiff  mr  doyle 
we did it 
desmond doyle has won 
glory be to god 
 praise be to god 
 sister  we ve won 
darling child  don t you forget me 
l won t  sister  l love you
