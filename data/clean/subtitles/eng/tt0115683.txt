   romulus  my bug 
son of a bitch  son of a bitch 
 faulkner  here we go  here we go 
mr leaky  has there been some kind
of security breach  who are these men 
has the bio dome been contaminated 
no  no 
ladies and gentlemen  surprise  surprise 
we are pleased to announce the arrival
of our two special scientists 
  beam me up  stubby 
  jim  he s a vulcan 
this pre planned addition
to team bio dome
is intended to simulate the chaos theory
as we encounter it in nature 
we ll have plenty more information on this
a little later on and i ll get back to you 
but as you see 
right now we have work to do 
work to do 
who could be stupid enough
to think bio dome was a mall 
bud maclntosh and doyle johnson 
generation x road kill
on the superhighway of progress 
they re not terrorists 
they re college students from tucson 
they really did think it was a mall 
  get them out now 
  the doors are sealed for one year 
i can t open the doors  if i do  the integrity
of all the scientific data is compromised 
everything depends
on the precise time frame of one year 
screw the time frame 
i have  100 million invested in this 
and i don t intend to lose it
because two twits from tucson
can t tell a mall toilet
from a damned rain forest 
 whíspers  squirl  break the ice 
  excuse me  miss  are you tired 
  i beg your pardon 
  are you tired 
  no  why 
cos you ve been running
through my mind all day 
excuse me  miss 
if you were a yoghurt  would you be
fruit at the bottom  or stirred 
this is your problem  fix it 
  then they have to stay 
  all our preparation was for five people 
adding two more
will throw the system off balance 
then the system    will adapt 
  did it hurt 
  did what hurt 
when you fell from heaven  did it hurt 
bud  doyle  hello 
i m dr noah faulkner  you may recognise
me from my bio dome films on television 
are you the guy with the spray on hair 
anyway  as i m sure you already know 
you have stumbled
into an exciting new world 
tell me  have you ever
dreamt of being famous 
when i was a kid i wanted to be a rock
star cos i could do this with my finger 
but as i got older i realised
that the corporate rock world sucked 
and besides  you only knew one song 
  iron man  iron man 
does whatever an iron can
    pancake flat  like a glove   
  hold it 
that s  spider man  
black sabbath did  iron man  
oh  come on 
what  do you think you re so    smart 
do you think
you re some rocket scientist 
  yes 
  sorry 
what do you boys want out of life 
to die and come back as a leotard 
well   
i may be able to offer you
a springboard to that future 
  we would like you to stay with us 
  whoa  whoa  whoa  wait a minute  man 
you guys aren t one of those
freaky clans  are you 
dancing naked  you want us
to take off our clothes 
  and feed us some weird punch 
  no 
damn  we almost had it 
it was this close 
boys  this is where you ll be staying 
and i want you to feel right at home 
 both    wah  wah  wah
we d be obliged if we could get
some nice cushy beds with magic fingers 
like the ones at the mall that
the big tourists lie in for free 
they just plop down 
the little kids are around them 
 daddy  look at the little thing  
and it just rolls   
ow  ow  i have a sciatic 
  actually  we have no extra beds 
  can we just get our own mattress 
  sorry  no 
  here  guys 
  petra and i can live without this stuff 
  i know it s not much 
hey  have you ever been
with a squirrel and a stub

good morning  and congratulations  all 
we have survived night one 
  congratulations  doyle 
   grunts 
and the best thing is 
homeostasis was maintained all night 
no 
no 
it is bad enough that for the next year
i must share my air  food and water
with these    neanderthals 
but i will not share my tools of hygiene 
relax  it s sanitised 
i dunked it in olivia s scope 
  simian 
  dick 
look  you guys are the ones
that wanted us to stay 
think back   springboard into the future  
we didn t prepare for this voyage 
we need clean teeth too  all right 
his teeth    look 
you are absolutely right 
you should be brought up to speed 
it is time for a tour 
boys  boys  from here you can see
all the regions of the bio dome 
the rain forest  the tropical lagoon 
the farm  and the great desert 
every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely 
and all of this is your home now 
but remember  the survival of this system
is dependent upon homeostasis 
that means a balance
within an enclosed system itself 
faulkner 
could we get some binoculars 
let s make a rule 
everything that you did at home 
you re forbidden to do here 
 both  everything 
shave poochie poochie 
shave poochie poochie 
  everything 
  ok 
  all right 
  don t move 
  i ll be right back 
  i got a wicked itch on my nads 
don t move 
 whíspers  bud 
i got a wicked itch on my nads 
 whíspers  faulkner said don t move 
i can t take it any more 
i can t take it any more 
well  i guess this means
we re our own tour guides 
all right  now  everybody 
do not feed the animals  stay together 
and no flash photography 
remember  at bio dome we re dependent
on balancing homos within the system 
ok  now  everybody stay with the group 
follow me  this way 
  jerk  you shouldn t have hit me so hard 
   bud laughs 
 whíspers  no  wait 
come here  come here

to open that door 
  hmm    so what you re saying is

don t you think your couch
is having withdrawals 
so what are we supposed to do 
wait a year for you guys to get out

stubby   thriving on chaos  
those ll sell better

let s hope so  i just want
you gentlemen to remember
how important you are
to this whole experiment 
feel free to contribute  you are
an integral part of the bio dome system 
um    since you put it that way 
we were thinking of you producing
maybe environmental condoms 
so when you    rip the packet 
it s automatic sap lubrication 
no chalk on the bark  and then
when you re pollinating your flower   
slide  slide  slipperty slide  just smooth 
  right in 
  and the bud and doyle action figures 
  action figures

fish on the play 
my proposal is that we plant these seeds 
and i know you re thinkin 
 illegal  illegal  
but the value of purple sticky punge
goes way beyond just tokin  it 
  ain t that right  professor johnson 
  that s correct  professor maclntosh 
 purple sticky punge  or hemp 
is an excellent source of paper  
 it makes a fine rope  
 it can even make
a contaminant free fuel  
 but the greatest value to us bio domers
is its rapid rate of photosyninthesis 
which means more oxygen for everyone  
 both  on three    three 
cannonball 
  there you go  mr bloom 
  thanks  girls 
tell bud and doyle

   jen  oh  god 
check it out  this is the event
you ve been waiting for 
the annual at arizona tech  a three day
blowout to benefit the rain forest 
there s gonna be  like  seminars
and lectures  and kegs and dudes galore 
  monique  we cannot go to this 
  why not  pray tell 
  do the names bud and doyle ring a bell 
  a year s a long time to wait 
  do you know how old we ll be in a year

there s something i have to
get off my chest before we die 
remember that really cute little teeny tiny
turtle you had when we were growin  up
that disappeared and they put
your kitty cat to sleep for eating him 
what really happened was
that i stepped on him
then flushed him down the toilet
and let the cat take the rap 
  frisky 
  he went down like a champ  squirl 
remember your uncle divorced your aunt
for sleeping with that flamingo dancer 
her children disowned her 
the church shunned her 
she started a drinking binge 
that flamingo dancer s outfit
he found was mine 
my mom was trying to make me
take lessons to impress the neighbours 
so i took the outfit  i hid it in
aunt flo s bedroom  i said i got mugged 
aunt flo s insane now 
yeah  but she has her independence 
remember the great fire of 1979
that supposedly started in your garage
when that chipmunk ingested fertiliser
then fell onto a can of kerosene 
instantly turning him into a fluffy
little molotov cocktail that set ablaze 
levelling the whole neighbourhood
west of newton s hardware store 
you started that fire 
no  but that was pretty cool  huh
