mr leaky has there been some kind
of security breach who are these men
has the biodome been contaminated
no no
ladies and gentlemen surprise surprise
we are pleased to announce the arrival
of our two special scientists
beam me up stubby
jim hes a vulcan
this preplanned addition
to team biodome
is intended to simulate the chaos theory
as we encounter it in nature
well have plenty more information on this
a little later on and ill get back to you
but as you see
right now we have work to do
work to do
who could be stupid enough
to think biodome was a mall
bud maclntosh and doyle johnson
generationx road kill
on the superhighway of progress
theyre not terrorists
theyre college students from tucson
they really did think it was a mall
get them out now
the doors are sealed for one year
i cant open the doors if i do the integrity
of all the scientific data is compromised
everything depends
on the precise time frame of one year
screw the time frame
i have 100 million invested in this
and i dont intend to lose it
because two twits from tucson
cant tell a mall toilet
from a damned rain forest
whíspers squirl break the ice
excuse me miss are you tired
i beg your pardon
are you tired
no why
cos youve been running
through my mind all day
excuse me miss
if you were a yoghurt would you be
fruit at the bottom or stirred
this is your problem fix it
then they have to stay
all our preparation was for five people
adding two more
will throw the system off balance
then the system will adapt
did it hurt
did what hurt
when you fell from heaven did it hurt
bud doyle hello
im dr noah faulkner you may recognise
me from my biodome films on television
are you the guy with the sprayon hair
anyway as im sure you already know
you have stumbled
into an exciting new world
tell me have you ever
dreamt of being famous
when i was a kid i wanted to be a rock
star cos i could do this with my finger
but as i got older i realised
that the corporate rock world sucked
and besides you only knew one song
iron man iron man
does whatever an iron can
pancakeflat like a glove
hold it
thats spiderman
black sabbath did iron man
oh come on
what do you think youre so smart
do you think
youre some rocket scientist
yes
sorry
what do you boys want out of life
to die and come back as a leotard
well
i may be able to offer you
a springboard to that future
we would like you to stay with us
whoa whoa whoa wait a minute man
you guys arent one of those
freaky clans are you
dancing naked you want us
to take off our clothes
and feed us some weird punch
no
damn we almost had it
it was this close
boys this is where youll be staying
and i want you to feel right at home
both  wah wah wah
wed be obliged if we could get
some nice cushy beds with magic fingers
like the ones at the mall that
the big tourists lie in for free

i dunked it in olivias scope
simian
dick
look you guys are the ones
that wanted us to stay
think back springboard into the future
we didnt prepare for this voyage
we need clean teeth too all right
his teeth look
you are absolutely right
you should be brought up to speed
it is time for a tour
boys boys from here you can see
all the regions of the biodome
the rain forest the tropical lagoon
the farm and the great desert
every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely
and all of this is your home now
but remember the survival of this system
is dependent upon homeostasis
that means a balance
within an enclosed system itself
faulkner
could we get some binoculars
lets make a rule
everything that you did at home
youre forbidden to do here
both everything
shave poochiepoochie
shave poochiepoochie
everything
ok

dont move
whíspers bud
i got a wicked itch on my nads
whíspers faulkner said dont move
i cant take it any more
i cant take it any more
well i guess this means
were our own tour guides

do not feed the animals stay together
and no flash photography
remember at biodome were dependent
on balancing homos within the system

goes way beyond just tokin it
aint that right professor johnson
thats correct professor maclntosh
purple sticky punge or hemp
is an excellent source of paper
it makes a fine rope
it can even make
a contaminantfree fuel
but the greatest value to us biodomers
is its rapid rate of photosyninthesis
which means more oxygen for everyone
both on three three
cannonball
there you go mr bloom
thanks girls
tell bud and doyle
im writin a song about them ok

its not lookin too good
theres something i have to
get off my chest before we die
remember that really cute little teeny tiny
turtle you had when we were growin up
that disappeared and they put
your kittycat to sleep for eating him
what really happened was
that i stepped on him
then flushed him down the toilet
and let the cat take the rap
frisky
he went down like a champ squirl
remember your uncle divorced your aunt
for sleeping with that flamingo dancer
her children disowned her
the church shunned her
she started a drinking binge
that flamingo dancers outfit
he found was mine
my mom was trying to make me
take lessons to impress the neighbours
so i took the outfit i hid it in
aunt flos bedroom i said i got mugged
aunt flos insane now
yeah but she has her independence
remember the great fire of 1979
that supposedly started in your garage
when that chipmunk ingested fertiliser
then fell onto a can of kerosene
instantly turning him into a fluffy
little molotov cocktail that set ablaze
levelling the whole neighbourhood
west of newtons hardware store
you started that fire
