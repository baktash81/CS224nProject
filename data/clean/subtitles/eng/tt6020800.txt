 laughs 
woo 
oh 
 moody orchestral music 
 flames crackle 
well  one of us will have to get
the excavator to get it out 
why one of us 
one of us will have to stay here
with the gold  obviously 
protect it 
of course  yeah 
i know a place
a couple of days drive east
that ll have what we need 
two days there  two days back 
one sorting an excavator 
five days 
well  maybe four 
but you ll have to keep stopping
to cool down the engine 
you ll have to be careful
asking around 
people get wind of you
needing an excavator 
they re likely to want to know
why 
i ll give you the name
of someone i trust
and i ll stay here
with the gold 
why don t i stay here
with the gold 
you know where to get
the excavator 
 dog howls 
i m gonna say something here 
and uh  i don t want you to take
it the wrong way or nothing 
but i don t trust you to keep
your head while i m gone 
i don t mean to talk down to you
or nothing  but 
you gotta watch your water 
how much you drink 
how much you got left 
you gotta stay out of the sun 
watch your food  if you run out 
you gotta catch more 
it ain t no fucking joke
out here 
you re a bit loose with it all 
not being from here  you know 
i think i can handle it 
well  like i said  i don t mean
to condescend you or nothing 
but 
you may feel pretty safe with me
here right now  but 
once i m gone with the truck
and you re here
all by your lonesome 
be a very different feeling
indeed 
you re likely to panic 
do something stupid 
and then what 
there s fuck all people
coming through here 
but if someone does 
they re not likely to want us
to keep the gold for ourselves 
if you know what i mean 
and i just don t think
you have it in you
to stop that from happening 
and i do not want to risk
what we got here 
no offense 
i think i ll stay with the gold 
you sure 
i m sure 
 pensive music 
i got more water
 cause i ve gotta put it in the
truck to keep the engine cool 
it is what it is 
it is what it is 
you got a few cans
of food there 
but if run out 
you might want this 
you see something 
don t be afraid  you use it 
 strains 
now  keep this sat phone on you 
spare batteries 
and i ll try and call you from
a payphone on the way there 
but i m going to try and buy one
when i get to the excavator 
then i can call you on the way
back without stopping 
   car door slams 
  ok 
it ll be ok 
you just do what i said and   
keep your head on 
just think  by the time i get
back  we ll be rich as all hell

  under blossom
we made our vows  
  all the blossoms
come sailing down  
  through the streets and
through the playgrounds  
  the sun would stream
on the sheets  
  woken by the morning bird  
  we d buy the sunday
newspapers  
  and never read a single word  
  people they ain t no good  
  people  they ain t no good  
  people  they ain t no good  
  seasons came  seasons went  
  winter stripped
the blossoms bare  
  a different tree
now lines the streets  
  shaking its fists in the air  
  the winter slammed us
like a fist  
  the windows rattlin 
in the gales  
  to which she drew
the curtains  
  made out of her wedding veil  
  people they ain t no good  
  people they ain t no good  
  people they ain t no good  
  at all  
  to our love send
a dozen white lilies  
  to our love send
a coffin of wood  
  to our love let all the
pink eyed pigeons coo  
  that people they just
ain t no good  
  to our love send back
all the letters  
  to our love a valentine
of blood  
  to our love let all
the jilted lovers cry  
  that people
they just ain t no good  
  it ain t that in their hearts
they re bad  
  they can comfort you
some even try  
  they nurse you
when you re ill of health  
  they bury you
when you go and die  
  it ain t that in their hearts
they re bad  
  they ll stick by you
if they could
