oh
moody orchestral music
flames crackle
well one of us will have to get
the excavator to get it out
why one of us
one of us will have to stay here
with the gold obviously
protect it
of course yeah
i know a place
a couple of days drive east
thatll have what we need
two days there two days back
one sorting an excavator
five days
well maybe four
but youll have to keep stopping
to cool down the engine
youll have to be careful
asking around
people get wind of you
needing an excavator
theyre likely to want to know
why
ill give you the name
of someone i trust
and ill stay here
with the gold
why dont i stay here
with the gold
you know where to get
the excavator
dog howls
im gonna say something here
and uh i dont want you to take
it the wrong way or nothing
but i dont trust you to keep
your head while im gone
i dont mean to talk down to you
or nothing but
you gotta watch your water
how much you drink
how much you got left
you gotta stay out of the sun
watch your food if you run out
you gotta catch more
it aint no fucking joke
out here
youre a bit loose with it all
not being from here you know
i think i can handle it
well like i said i dont mean
to condescend you or nothing
but
you may feel pretty safe with me
here right now but
once im gone with the truck
and youre here
all by your lonesome
be a very different feeling
indeed
youre likely to panic
do something stupid
and then what
theres fuck all people
coming through here
but if someone does
theyre not likely to want us
to keep the gold for ourselves
if you know what i mean
and i just dont think
you have it in you
to stop that from happening
and i do not want to risk
what we got here
no offense
i think ill stay with the gold
you sure
im sure
pensive music
i got more water
cause ive gotta put it in the
truck to keep the engine cool
it is what it is
it is what it is
you got a few cans
of food there
but if run out
you might want this
you see something
dont be afraid you use it
strains
now keep this sat phone on you
spare batteries
and ill try and call you from
a payphone on the way there
but im going to try and buy one
when i get to the excavator
then i can call you on the way
back without stopping
car door slams
ok
itll be ok
you just do what i said and
keep your head on
just think by the time i get
back well be rich as all hell

i think thats
well understood
you can see it
everywhere you look
people just aint no good
we were married
under cherry trees
under blossom
we made our vows
all the blossoms
come sailing down
through the streets and
through the playgrounds
the sun would stream
on the sheets
woken by the morning bird
wed buy the sunday
newspapers
and never read a single word
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
seasons came seasons went
winter stripped
the blossoms bare
a different tree
now lines the streets
shaking its fists in the air
the winter slammed us
like a fist
the windows rattlin
in the gales
to which she drew
the curtains
made out of her wedding veil
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
at all
to our love send
a dozen white lilies
to our love send
a coffin of wood
to our love let all the
pinkeyed pigeons coo
that people they just
aint no good
to our love send back
all the letters
to our love a valentine
of blood
to our love let all
the jilted lovers cry
that people
they just aint no good
it aint that in their hearts
theyre bad
they can comfort you
some even try
they nurse you
when youre ill of health
they bury you
when you go and die
it aint that in their hearts
theyre bad
theyll stick by you
if they could
ah but thats
just bullshit baby
people just aint no good
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
people they aint no good
