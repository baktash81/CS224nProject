these extended lunch hours   
give my boss excess acid 
why don t you call your boss
and tell him   
you re taking the rest
of the afternoon off 
it s friday anyway 
and hot 
what do i do with my free afternoon 
walk you to the airport 
well  we could laze
around here a while longer 
checking out time is 3 00 p m 
hotels of this sort aren t
interested in you when you come in   
but when your time is up  
oh  sam  i hate having to be with you
in a place like this 
i ve heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night   
in a cheap hotel 
when you re married you can do
a lot of things deliberately 
you sure talk like
a girl who s been married 
oh  sam  this is
the last time 
 yeah  for what 
 for this 
for meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive 
you come down here
on business trips   
and we steal lunch hours 
i wish you
wouldn t even come 
what do we do instead 
write each other lurid love letters 
oh  i have to go  sam 
 i can come down next week 
 no 
not even just to see you 
have lunch in public 
oh  we can see each other 
we can even have dinner 
but respectably 
in my house with my mother s
picture on the mantel and   
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three 
and after the steak  do we
send sister to the movies   
turn mama s picture to the wall 
sam  
all right 
marion  whenever it s possible 
i want to see you 
and under any circumstances 
even respectability 
you make respectability
sound disrespectful 
i m all for it  it requires patience 
temperance  a lot of sweating out 
otherwise  though 
it s just hard work 
but if i can see you and touch you
even as simply as this  i won t mind it 
i m tired of sweating
for people who aren t there 
i sweat to pay off my father s
debts  and he s in his grave 
i sweat to pay my ex wife alimony 
and she s living   
on the other side of the world 
i pay too 
they also pay
who meet in hotel rooms 
a couple of years and
my debts will be paid off 
if she ever remarries 
the alimony stops 
 i haven t even been married once yet 
 but when you do  you ll swing 
oh  sam  let s get married 
and live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in fairvale 
we ll have lots of laughs 
i ll tell you what 
when i send my ex wife her alimony 
you can lick the stamps 
i ll lick the stamps 
you want to cut this off  go out
and find yourself somebody available 
i m thinking of it 
how could you even
think a thing like that 
 don t miss your plane 
 we can leave together  can t we 
mm mm  i m late and  uh 
you have to put your shoes on 
isn t mr lowery
back from lunch 
he s lunching with the man who s
buying the harris street property 
the old lease man  that s why
he s late  you got a headache 
it ll pass 
headaches are like resolutions  
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting 
have you got some aspirin 
i ve got something  not aspirin 
my mother s doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding 
teddy was furious when he found out
i d taken tranquillizers 
any calls 
teddy called me  my mother
called to see if teddy called 
oh  your sister called to say she s
going to tucson to do some buying

 i ll be back as soon as it s ready 
 okay 
 with my  with my trusty umbrella 
   laughs  
  old woman  
no   i tell you no  
i won t have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper  
by candlelight  i suppose 
in the cheap  erotic fashion   
 of young men with cheap  erotic minds 
   norman   mother  please 
and then what  after supper 
music  whispers 
mother  she s just a stranger 
she s hungry and it s raining out 
 mother  she s just a stranger   as if
men don t desire strangers  as if  
oh   i refuse to speak of disgusting
things  because they disgust me  
do you understand  boy 
go on 
go tell her she ll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite   
with my food or my son  
or do i have to tell her
 cause you don t have the guts 
 huh  boy  you have the guts  boy 
 shut up   shut up  
  door opens  closes  
 i ve caused you some trouble 
 no  uh  
mother  
my mother  uh  
what is the phrase 
she isn t quite
herself today 
you shouldn t have bothered  i really
don t have that much of an appetite 
oh  i m sorry 
i wish you could apologize
for other people 
don t worry about it 
but as long as you ve fixed
the supper  we may as well eat it 
it  uh  it might be  uh  nicer
and warmer in the office 
well  it stopped
raining 
uh  eating in an office
is just  just too officious 
 i have the parlour back here 
 all right 
 sit down 
 oh  thank you 
you re very kind 
it s all for you 
i m not hungry  go ahead 
you  you eat like a bird 
and you d know 
of course 
no  not really 
anyway  i hear the expression
 eats like a bird    
is really a fal  
false  falsity 
because birds really
eat a tremendous lot 
but i really don t know anything about
birds  my hobby is stuffing things 
you know  taxidermy 
and i guess i d just rather
stuff birds because   
i hate the look of beasts
when they re stuffed 
you know 
foxes and chimps 
some people even stuff dogs and cats 
but  oh  i can t do that 
i think only birds
look well stuffed because  
well  because they re kind
of passive to begin with 
it s a strange hobby 
curious 
 uncommon too 
 oh  i imagine so 
and it s  it s not as expensive
as you d think  it s cheap  really 
you know  needles
and thread  sawdust 
the chemicals are the only
thing that  that cost anything 
a man should have a hobby 
well  it s  
it s more than a hobby 
a hobby s supposed to
pass the time  not fill it 
is your time so empty 
no  uh  
well  i run the office   
and tend the cabins
and grounds   
and do little  uh 
errands for my mother  
the ones she allows
i might be capable of doing 
do you go out with friends 
well  a boy s best friend
is his mother 
you ve never had an empty moment
in your entire life  have you 
 only my share 
 where are you going 
i didn t mean to pry 
i m looking for
a private island 
what are you
running away from 
 why do you ask that 
 no 
people never run away
from anything 
the rain didn t last long 
did it  you know what i think 
i think that   
we re all in
our private traps   
clamped in them  and none of us
can ever get out 
we scratch and  
and claw   
but only at the air 
only at each other 
and for all of it 
we never budge an inch 
sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps 
i was born in mine 
i don t mind it any more 
oh  but you should 
you should mind it 
oh  i do  but i say i don t 
  chuckles  
you know  if anyone ever talked
to me the way i heard  
the way she spoke to you  
sometimes when she talks
to me like that   
i feel i d like to go up there and
curse her and  and leave her forever 
or at least defy her 
but i know i can t 
she s ill 
she sounded strong 
no  i mean    ill 
she had to raise me all by herself 
after my father died 
i was only five and it 
it must ve been quite a strain for her 
i mean  she didn t have to go to work or
anything  he left her a little money 
anyway  a few years ago 
mother met this man 
and he  he talked her
into building this motel 
he could have talked her
into anything 
and when he died too  it was
just too great a shock for her 
and the way
he died  
  chuckles   i guess it s nothing
to talk about while you re eating 
anyway  it was just too great
a loss for her  she had nothing left 
except you 
well  a son is a poor substitute
for a lover 
why don t you go away 
to a private island 
like you 
  sighs  
no    not like me 
i couldn t do that 
who d look after her 
she d be alone up there 
the fire would go out 
it d be cold and damp
like a grave 
if you love someone  you don t do that
to them  even if you hate them 
you understand  l  
i don t hate her 
i hate what she s become 
i hate the illness 
wouldn t it be better
if you put her    some place 
you mean an institution 
a madhouse 
  chuckles   people always call
a madhouse  some place   don t they 
put her in  some place  
i m sorry  i didn t mean it
to sound uncaring 
what do you know
about caring 
have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places 
the laughing and the tears   
and the cruel eyes
studying you 
my mother there 
  chuckles  
but she s harmless 
she s as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds 
i am sorry 
i only felt  
it seems she s hurting you 
 i meant well 
 people always mean well 
they cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest  
oh  so very delicately  
of course 
i ve suggested it myself 
but i hate to even think about it 
she needs me 
it  it s not as if she were
a  a maniac  a raving thing 
she  
she just goes
a little mad sometimes 
we all go a little mad
sometimes 
  chuckles  
haven t you 
yes 
sometimes just one time
can be enough  thank you 
thank you   norman  
norman 
oh  you re not  you re not
going back to your room already 
  sighs  
i m very tired 
and i have a long drive tomorrow 
all the way back to phoenix 
really 
i stepped into a private trap
back there   
and i d like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it   
before it s too late
for me too 
are you sure you wouldn t like
to stay a little while longer 
 i mean  just for talk 
 oh  i d like to  but  
all right  well 
i ll see you in the morning 
i ll bring you some breakfast 
all right 
 what time 
 very early  dawn 
all right  miss  uh

  woman  
i ve tried many brands 
so far  of those i ve used  i haven t
had much luck with any of them 
let s see what they say
about this one 
they tell you
what its ingredients are   
and how it s guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world   
but they do not tell you
whether it s painless 
and i say  insect or man 
death should always be painless 
this one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others 
sam 
sam  
lady wants to see ya 
 yes  miss 
 i m marion s sister 
 oh  sure  lila 
 is marion here 
 well  of course not  something wrong

my name is arbogast 
friend 
i m a private
investigator

 i don t know you 
i know you don t  because if you did
i wouldn t be able to follow you 
what s your interest

well   40 000 
  40 000 
 that s right 
one of you d better tell me what s going
on  and fast  i can take so much  
now  take it easy 
friend 
it s just that your girlfriend
stole  40 000 
what are you talking about 
what is this 
she was supposed to bank it on friday
for her boss  and she didn t 
 no one has seen her since 
 someone has seen her 
someone always sees a girl
with  40 000 
they don t want to prosecute 
they just want the money back 
 sam  if she s here  
 she isn t  she isn t 
miss crane  can i ask you  did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more 
oh  not even a hunch 
just hope 
well  with a little checking
i could get to believe you 
i don t care
if you believe me or not 
all i want to do is see marion
before she gets in this too deeply 
did you check phoenix 
maybe she had an accident  or a hold up 
no  she was seen leaving town in her
own car  by her employer  i might add 
i can t believe it 
can you 
we re always quickest
to doubt people   
who have a reputation
for being honest 
i think she s here 
miss crane 
where there s
a boyfriend  
she s not back there with the nuts and
bolts  but she s in this town somewhere 
i ll find her 
i ll be seeing you 
  car approaching  
  engine off  
 evening 
 evening 
i almost drove
right past 
i m always forgetting to turn
the sign on  but we do have a vacancy 
twelve  in fact 
twelve cabins  twelve vacancies 
 candy 
 no  thanks 
last two days i ve been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon   
but this is the first place that looks
like it s hiding from the world 
to tell the truth  i didn t
really forget to turn the sign on 
 just doesn t seem like
any use any more 
 oh 
see  that used to be
the main highway right there 
 wanna register 
 sit down  i don t wanna trouble you 
 i just wanna ask a few questions 
 no trouble  today s linen day 
i always change the beds once a week
whether they ve been used or not 
hate the smell of dampness  it s such
a  i don t know    creepy smell 
you out to buy
a motel 
no 
reason i ask  you said you d seen
so many the past couple of days   
i thought maybe  
what  uh  what was it
you wanted to ask 
i m looking for
a missing person 
my name s arbogast 
i m a private investigator 
i ve been trying
to trace a girl   
that s been missing for 
oh  about a week now from phoenix 
it s a private matter 
the family wants to forgive her 
she s not
in any trouble 
i didn t think the police went looking
for people who aren t in trouble 
 i m not the police 
 oh  yeah 
we have reason to believe she came
along this way  did she stop here 
no one s stopped here
for a couple of weeks 
mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself 
commit myself 
 you sure talk like a policeman 
 look at the picture  please 
 mm mmm  yeah 
 sure 
well  she may have
used an alias 
marion crane s
her real name   
but she could ve registered
under a different one 
i tell ya  i don t even much bother
with guests registering any more 
one by one 
you drop the formalities 
i shouldn t even bother changing
the sheets  but old habits die hard 
which reminds me  
 what s that 
 the sign 
a couple last week said
if the thing hadn t been on   
they would ve thought
this was an old  deserted  
you see 
that s exactly my point 
nobody d been here
for a couple weeks   
and there s a couple came by
and didn t know that you were open 
as you say 
old habits die hard 
this girl could ve registered
under another name  mind if i look 
 no

 sam  he called   
when he had nothing

don t you think he d have called
if he had anything at all 
yes  i think
he would ve 
 let s go see ai chambers 
 who s he 
 our deputy sheriff around here 
 let me get my coat 
  sam  
good evening 
well  l  i don t know where to start 
except at the beginning 
yes 
 this is lila crane from phoenix 
 how do you do 
she s been here
searching for her sister 
there s this
private detective helping 
we got a call from this
detective  he d traced her   
to that motel
on the old highway 
that must be
the bates motel 
he called to say he was going
to question mrs bates 
norman took a wife 
  sam   no  l l don t think so 
an old woman  his mother 
that was early this evening  we
haven t seen or heard from him since 
now  your sister s
missing how long 
she left phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace 
how d you and this detective come
to trace her to fairvale 
they thought
she d be coming to me 
 left phoenix under her own steam 
 yes 
she s not missing so much
as she s run away 
  sam  
that s right 
from what 
she stole some money 
a lot 
forty thousand dollars 
the police haven t
been able to  
everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back   
they could avoid involving her
with the police 
that explains
the private detective 
he traced her
to the bates place 
what exactly did he say
when he called you 
he said marion was there
for one night  then she left 
 with the  40 000 
 he didn t say anything   
about the money 
it isn t important
what he said  is it 
he was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother  and he didn t 
that s what i want you
to do something about 
like what 
  sighs   i m sorry if
i seem overanxious 
i m sure there s something wrong
out there  and i have to know what 
well  i think there s something wrong
too  miss  but not the same thing 
i think what s wrong
is your private detective 
i think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin    
probably from norman bates   
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money 
no  no  he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there 
call norman and let him
say what happened 
  sheriff  
at this hour 
he was out when i was there a while ago 
if he s back  he probably isn t in bed 
he wasn t out  he just wasn t answerin 
the door in the dead of night
like some people do 
this fellow lives
like a hermit 
you must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago 
please  call 
florrie  the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the bates motel 
norman 
sheriff chambers 
ye  i been
just fine  thanks 
listen  we got
worries here 
yeah  have you had a fella
stop by there tonight  
well  this one
wouldn t be a customer 
 a private detective  name of  
 arbogast 
arbogast 
and after he left 
no  that s  
that s okay  norman 
  hangs up receiver  
this detective was there 
norman told him about the girl   
the detective thanked him
and he went away 
and he didn t come back 
he didn t see the mother 
your detective told you
he couldn t come right back   
because he was going to question
norman bates  mother  right 
yes 
norman bates  mother
has been dead and buried   
in greenlawn cemetery
for the past ten years 
i helped norman pick out the dress
she was buried in  periwinkle blue 
 tain t only
local history  sam 
it s the only case of murder
and suicide on fairvale ledgers 
mrs bates poisoned this guy
she was    involved with   
when she found out
he was married   
then took a helpin  of
the same stuff herself 
strychnine 
ugly way to die 
norman found them
dead together 
  whispers  
ln bed 
you mean that old woman i saw sittin 
in the window wasn t bates  mother 
now  wait a minute  sam 
are you sure you saw an old woman 
yes   ln the house
behind the motel  
i called and pounded
but she just ignored me  
you saw
norman bates  mother 
but it had to be   
because arbogast said so too  
and the young man wouldn t let him
see her because she was too ill 
well  if the woman up there
is mrs bates   
who s that woman buried
out in greenlawn cemetery 
now  mother  um  
i l m gonna bring something up  
  mrs bates laughs  
i am sorry  boy   
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders 
  norman  
please  mother 
  mrs bates   no  
i will not hide in the fruit cellar 
ha   you think
i m fruity  huh 
i m staying right here 
this is my room and
no one will drag me out of it   
ieast of all
my big  bold son 
  norman  
they ll come now  mother 
he came after the girl 
and now someone will come after him 
mother  please  it s just for
a few days so they won t find you 
  mrs bates  
just for a few days 
in that dark  dank
fruit cellar  no  
you hid me there once  boy  and you
won t do it again  not ever again  
now get out  
 i told you to get out  boy 
 i ll carry you  mother 
norman  what do you
think you re doing 
don t you touch me  
don t   norman  
put me down   put me down  
i can walk on my own 
  church bell ringing  
  indistinct chatter  
  woman  
wonderful sermon today 
 good morning 
   both   good morning 
we thought we d drive out
to that motel with you 
 he s already been 
 went out before service 
 did you two have breakfast 
 didn t find anything 
nothing  let s
clear the way here 
what did he say
about my sister 
just what he told your detective 
she used a fake name 
saw the register myself  saw the
whole place  that boy s alone there 
 no mother 
 you must have seen an illusion  sam 
i know you re not
the seein  illusions type   
but no woman was there and i don t
believe in ghosts  so there it is 
i still feel
there s something  
can see you do  i m sorry i couldn t
make you feel better 
come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft 
the sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law   
that s the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein  picked up 
how  bout that 
 i don t know 
 it s sunday 
come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime  it ll make it nicer 
you too  sam 
thank you 
 maybe i am the seeing illusions type 
 no  you re not 
 you want me to drop you at the hotel  
 sam 
i still won t feel satisfied
until i go out there 
neither will l 
come on 
we better decide what we re gonna say
or do when we walk in there 
we re going to register
as man and wife 
we re going to
get shown to a cabin   
and then we re going to search every
inch of the place  inside and out 
  truck door opens 
closes  
i wonder where norman bates
does his hermiting 
someone s at that window 
i just saw the curtain move 
come on 
 well 
 just coming up to ring for you 
uh huh 
suppose you want a room 
we were gonna try to make it
to san francisco   
but we don t like the look
of that sky 
looks like a bad day coming 
doesn t it 
 i ll take you to cabin ten 
 better sign in first  hadn t we 
that s not necessary 
my boss is paying for this trip
and  uh  well  it s 90  business 
he wants practically
notarized receipts 
i d better sign in
and get a receipt 
thank you 
 i ll get your bags 
 haven t any 
 i ll show you the room  then 
 first time i ve ever seen it happen 
you check in any other place
in this country without bags   
 and you have to pay in advance 
 ten dollars 
  paper crinkling  
that receipt 
i ll go on ahead 
  norman   all right  there s
your receipt  i ll show you the cabin 
don t bother yourself 
we ll find it 
sam  we have to go into that cabin
and search it   
no matter what we re afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt 
i know 
do you think if something
happened  it happened there 
i don t know  but if you had   
a useless business like this motel 
what would you need to get out 
to get a new business somewhere else 
forty thousand dollars 
how could we prove that  
if he opens a motel on
the new highway in  say  a year  
there must be some proof
that exists now   
something that proves he got
that money away from marion somehow 
 what makes you sound so certain 
 arbogast  he liked me  sam 
or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel   
the same way about you 
i could tell the last time
i talked to him on the phone 
he wouldn t have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us   
unless he was stopped 
and he was stopped  so he must
have found out something 
we ll start with cabin one 
if he sees us 
we re just taking the air 
bates 
no shower curtain 
 sam   look  
 huh  what is it 
it s figuring  it didn t
get washed down  look 
some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40 000 
that proves marion was here 
it d be too wild a coincidence  
bates never denied she was here 
oh  doesn t that prove
he found out about the money 
do we simply ask him
where he s hidden it 
but that old woman  whoever she is 
she told arbogast something 
i want her to tell us
the same thing 
 you can t go up there 
 why not 
 bates 
 well  let s find him 
one of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman 
you ll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn t want to be held 
i don t like you going
into that house alone 
i can handle a sick old woman 
all right  i ll find bates
and keep him occupied 
wait a minute 
if you get anything
out of the mother   
can you find your way
back to town 
yes  of course 
if you do get anything 
don t stop to tell me 
 you looking for me 
 why  yes  as a matter of fact 
wife s taking a nap and   
i never can keep quiet enough for her 
so i thought i d look you up and talk 
 good  you satisfied with your cabin 
 oh  it s fine 
i ve been doing all the talking
so far  haven t i 
i thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time   
who did all the talking
when they got the chance 
here you are
doing all the listening 
 you are alone here  aren t you 
 mm hmm 
drive me crazy 
i think that would be a rather
extreme reaction  don t you 
just an expression  what i meant was 
uh  i d do anything to get away 
 wouldn t you 
 no 
   knocking on door  
 mrs bates 
  gasps  
  sighs  
i m not saying you
shouldn t be contented here   
i m just doubting that you are 
i think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you d unload this place 
this place  this place happens
to be my only world 
i grew up in that house 
i had a very happy childhood 
my mother and i
were more than happy 
you look frightened  have i been
saying something frightening 
i don t know
what you ve been saying 
i ve been talking about your mother 
about your motel 
 how you gonna do it 
 do what 
buy a new one in a new town where you
won t have to hide your mother 
why don t you just get in
your car and drive away 
where will you get the money to do that 
or do you already have it socked away 
 shut up  
 a lot of it  forty thousand dollars 
i bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it 
i think
she ll tell us 
where s that girl you came here with 
where is she 
mrs bates  it s  
   screaming  
   footsteps  
  norman yelling  
norman bates  
  screaming  
  people chattering  
if anyone gets any answers
it ll be the psychiatrist 
even i couldn t get to norman
and he knows me 
 you warm enough  miss 
 yes 
did he talk
to you 
no 
i got the whole story  but not from
norman  i got it from his  mother  
norman bates
no longer exists 
he only half existed
to begin with 
and now the other half
has taken over   
probably for all time 
did he kill my sister 
yes    and no 
now look  if you re trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork   
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop  
  chuckling   a psychiatrist
doesn t lay the groundwork 
he merely tries
to explain it 
 but my sister is  
 yes 
yes  i m sorry 
the private investigator too 
if you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel  you ll  
uh  have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books 
 yes  two 
 young girls 
 did he confess to  
 like i said   
the  mother  
to understand it the way i understood
it  hearing it from the  mother   
that is from the  mother  half
of norman s mind  
you have to go back
ten years   
to the time when norman murdered
his mother and her lover 
he was already dangerously disturbed 
had been since his father died 
his mother was
a clinging  demanding woman   
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world 
then she met a man   
and it seemed to norman that
she threw him over for this man 
that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both 
matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all   
most unbearable
to the son who commits it 
so he had to erase the crime 
at least in his own mind 
he stole her corpse 
a weighted coffin
was buried 
he hid the body
in the fruit cellar   
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep 
and that still
wasn t enough 
she was there   
but she was a corpse 
so he began to think
and speak for her   
give her half his life 
so to speak 
at times he could be both personalities 
carry on conversations 
at other times  the  mother  half
took over completely 
he was never all norman 
but he was often only  mother    
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her   
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him 
therefore  if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman   
the  mother  side of him
would go wild 
when he met your sister   
he was touched by her 
aroused by her 
he wanted her 
that set off the jealous  mother 
and  mother  killed the girl 
after the murder norman returned
as if from a deep sleep   
and  like a dutiful son  covered up
all traces of the crime   
he was convinced
his  mother  had committed  
why was he   
dressed like that 
he s a transvestite 
uh  not exactly 
a man who dresses in women s clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change   
or satisfaction 
is a transvestite 
but in norman s case  he was simply
doing everything possible   
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive 
and when reality
came to close   
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion   
he dressed up  even to
a cheap wig he bought 
he d walk about the house 
sit in her chair  speak in her voice 
he tried to be
his mother 
and  uh  now he is 
that s what i meant when i said
i got the story from the  mother  
you see  when the mind
houses two personalities   
there s always
a conflict  a battle 
in norman s case 
the battle is over   
and the dominant personality
has won 
and the  40 000 
who got that 
the swamp  these were
crimes of passion  not profit 
he feels a little chill 
can i bring him this blanket 
 oh  sure 
 all right 
  norman speaking as  mother   
thank you 
   mother s  voice   it s sad when
a mother has to speak the words   
that condemn her own son   
but i couldn t allow them
to believe that i would commit murder 
they ll put him away now 
as i should have years ago 
he was always bad 
and in the end   
he intended to tell them i killed
those girls and that man   
as if i could do anything
except sit and stare   
iike one
of his stuffed birds 
they know i can t even
move a finger  and i won t 
i ll just sit here and be quiet 
just in case they do suspect me 
they re probably watching me 
well  let them 
let them see
what kind of a person i am 
i m not even
gonna swat that fly 
i hope they are watching 
they ll see 
they ll see
