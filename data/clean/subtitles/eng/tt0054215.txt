seemed norman threw man
pushed line killed
matricide probably unbearable crime
unbearable son commits
erase crime least mind
stole corpse
weighted coffin buried
hid body fruit cellar
even treated keep well would keep
still wasnt enough
corpse
began think speak
give half life speak
times could personalities carry conversations
times mother half took completely
never norman often mother
pathologically jealous
assumed jealous
therefore felt strong attraction woman
mother side would go wild
met sister
touched aroused
wanted
set jealous mother mother killed girl
murder norman returned deep sleep
like dutiful son covered traces crime
convinced mother committed
dressed like
hes transvestite
uh exactly
man dresses womens clothing order achieve sexual change
satisfaction transvestite
normans case simply everything possible
keep alive illusion mother alive
reality came close
danger desire threatened illusion
dressed even cheap wig bought
hed walk house sit chair speak voice
tried mother
uh
thats meant said got story mother
see mind houses two personalities
theres always conflict battle
normans case battle
dominant personality
got
swamp crimes passion profit
feels little chill bring blanket
oh sure right
norman speaking mother thank
mothers voice sad mother speak words
condemn son
couldnt allow believe would commit murder
theyll put away years ago
always bad end
intended tell killed girls man
