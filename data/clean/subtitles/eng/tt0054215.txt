these extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid
why dont you call your boss
and tell him
youre taking the rest
of the afternoon off
its friday anyway
and hot
what do i do with my free afternoon
walk you to the airport
well we could laze
around here a while longer
checkingout time is 300 pm
hotels of this sort arent
interested in you when you come in
but when your time is up
oh sam i hate having to be with you
in a place like this
ive heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night
in a cheap hotel
when youre married you can do
a lot of things deliberately
you sure talk like
a girl whos been married
oh sam this is
the last time
yeah for what
for this
for meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive
you come down here
on business trips
and we steal lunch hours
i wish you
wouldnt even come
what do we do instead
write each other lurid love letters
oh i have to go sam
i can come down next week
no
not even just to see you
have lunch in public
oh we can see each other
we can even have dinner
but respectably
in my house with my mothers
picture on the mantel and
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three
and after the steak do we
send sister to the movies
turn mamas picture to the wall
sam
all right
marion whenever its possible
i want to see you
and under any circumstances
even respectability
you make respectability
sound disrespectful
im all for it it requires patience
temperance a lot of sweating out
otherwise though
its just hard work
but if i can see you and touch you
even as simply as this i wont mind it
im tired of sweating
for people who arent there
i sweat to pay off my fathers
debts and hes in his grave
i sweat to pay my exwife alimony
and shes living
on the other side of the world
i pay too
they also pay
who meet in hotel rooms
a couple of years and
my debts will be paid off
if she ever remarries
the alimony stops
i havent even been married once yet
but when you do youll swing
oh sam lets get married
and live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in fairvale
well have lots of laughs
ill tell you what
when i send my exwife her alimony
you can lick the stamps
ill lick the stamps
you want to cut this off go out
and find yourself somebody available
im thinking of it
how could you even
think a thing like that

laughs
old woman
no  i tell you no
i wont have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper
by candlelight i suppose
in the cheap erotic fashion
of young men with cheap erotic minds
norman  mother please
and then what after supper
music whispers
mother shes just a stranger
shes hungry and its raining out
mother shes just a stranger as if
men dont desire strangers as if
oh  i refuse to speak of disgusting
things because they disgust me
do you understand boy
go on
go tell her shell not be
appeasing her ugly appetite
with my food or my son
or do i have to tell her
cause you dont have the guts
huh boy you have the guts boy
shut up  shut up
door opens closes
ive caused you some trouble
no uh
mother
my mother uh
what is the phrase
she isnt quite
herself today
you shouldnt have bothered i really
dont have that much of an appetite
oh im sorry
i wish you could apologize
for other people
dont worry about it
but as long as youve fixed
the supper we may as well eat it
it uhit might be uh nicer
and warmer in the office
well it stopped
raining
uh eating in an office
is justjust too officious
i have the parlour back here
all right
sit down
oh thank you
youre very kind
its all for you
im not hungry go ahead
youyou eat like a bird
and youd know
of course
no not really
anyway i hear the expression
eats like a bird
is really a fal
falsefalsity
because birds really
eat a tremendous lot
but i really dont know anything about
birds my hobby is stuffing things
you know taxidermy
and i guess id just rather
stuff birds because
i hate the look of beasts
when theyre stuffed
you know
foxes and chimps
some people even stuff dogs and cats
but oh i cant do that
i think only birds
look well stuffed because
well because theyre kind
of passive to begin with
its a strange hobby
curious
uncommon too
oh i imagine so
and itsits not as expensive
as youd think its cheap really
you know needles
and thread sawdust
the chemicals are the only
thing that that cost anything
a man should have a hobby
well its
its more than a hobby
a hobbys supposed to
pass the time not fill it
is your time so empty
no uh
well i run the office
and tend the cabins
and grounds
and do little uh
errands for my mother
the ones she allows
i might be capable of doing
do you go out with friends
well a boys best friend
is his mother
youve never had an empty moment
in your entire life have you
only my share
where are you going
i didnt mean to pry
im looking for
a private island
what are you
running away from
why do you ask that
no
people never run away
from anything
the rain didnt last long
did it you know what i think
i think that
were all in
our private traps
clamped in them and none of us
can ever get out
we scratch and
and claw
but only at the air
only at each other
and for all of it
we never budge an inch
sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps
i was born in mine
i dont mind it any more
oh but you should
you should mind it
oh i do but i say i dont
chuckles
you know if anyone ever talked
to me the way i heard
the way she spoke to you
sometimes when she talks
to me like that
i feel id like to go up there and
curse her and and leave her forever
or at least defy her
but i know i cant
shes ill
she sounded strong
no i mean ill
she had to raise me all by herself
after my father died
i was only five and it
it mustve been quite a strain for her
i mean she didnt have to go to work or
anything he left her a little money
anyway a few years ago
mother met this man
and hehe talked her
into building this motel
he could have talked her
into anything
and when he died too it was
just too great a shock for her
and the way
he died
chuckles  i guess its nothing
to talk about while youre eating
anyway it was just too great
a loss for her she had nothing left
except you
well a son is a poor substitute
for a lover
why dont you go away
to a private island
like you
sighs
no not like me
i couldnt do that
whod look after her
shed be alone up there
the fire would go out
itd be cold and damp
like a grave
if you love someone you dont do that
to them even if you hate them
you understand l
i dont hate her
i hate what shes become
i hate the illness
wouldnt it be better
if you put her some place
you mean an institution
a madhouse
chuckles  people always call
a madhouse some place dont they
put her in some place
im sorry i didnt mean it
to sound uncaring
what do you know
about caring
have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places
the laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes
studying you
my mother there
chuckles
but shes harmless
shes as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds
i am sorry
i only felt
it seems shes hurting you
i meant well
people always mean well
they cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest
oh so very delicately
of course
ive suggested it myself
but i hate to even think about it
she needs me
itits not as if she were
aa maniac a raving thing
she
she just goes
a little mad sometimes
we all go a little mad
sometimes
chuckles
havent you
yes
sometimes just one time
can be enough thank you
thank you norman
norman
oh youre notyoure not
going back to your room already
sighs
im very tired
and i have a long drive tomorrow
all the way back to phoenix
really
i stepped into a private trap
back there
and id like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it
before its too late
for me too
are you sure you wouldnt like
to stay a little while longer
i mean just for talk
oh id like to but
all right well
ill see you in the morning
ill bring you some breakfast

lets see what they say
about this one
they tell you
what its ingredients are
and how its guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world
but they do not tell you
whether its painless
and i say insect or man
death should always be painless
this one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others

the main highway right there

along this way did she stop here
no ones stopped here
for a couple of weeks
mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself
commit myself
you sure talk like a policeman
look at the picture please

but she couldve registered
under a different one

with guests registering any more
one by one
you drop the formalities
i shouldnt even bother changing
the sheets but old habits die hard
which reminds me
whats that
the sign
a couple last week said
if the thing hadnt been on
they wouldve thought
this was an old deserted
you see
thats exactly my point
nobodyd been here
for a couple weeks
and theres a couple came by
and didnt know that you were open
as you say
old habits die hard
this girl couldve registered
under another name mind if i look
no

good evening
well li dont know where to start
except at the beginning
yes
this is lila crane from phoenix
how do you do
shes been here
searching for her sister
theres this
private detective helping
we got a call from this
detectivehed traced her
to that motel
on the old highway
that must be
the bates motel
he called to say he was going
to question mrs bates
norman took a wife
sam  no ll dont think so
an old woman his mother
that was early this evening we
havent seen or heard from him since
now your sisters
missing how long
she left phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace
howd you and this detective come
to trace her to fairvale
they thought
shed be coming to me
left phoenix under her own steam
yes
shes not missing so much
as shes run away
sam
thats right
from what
she stole some money
a lot
forty thousand dollars
the police havent
been able to
everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back
they could avoid involving her
with the police
that explains
the private detective
he traced her
to the bates place
what exactly did he say
when he called you
he said marion was there
for one night then she left
with the 40000
he didnt say anything
about the money
it isnt important
what he said is it
he was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother and he didnt
thats what i want you
to do something about
like what
sighs  im sorry if
i seem overanxious
im sure theres something wrong
out there and i have to know what
well i think theres something wrong
too miss but not the same thing
i think whats wrong
is your private detective
i think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin
probably from norman bates
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money
no no he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there
call norman and let him
say what happened
sheriff
at this hour
he was out when i was there a while ago
if hes back he probably isnt in bed
he wasnt out he just wasnt answerin
the door in the dead of night
like some people do
this fellow lives
like a hermit
you must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago
please call
florrie the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the bates motel

local history sam
its the only case of murder
and suicide on fairvale ledgers
mrs bates poisoned this guy

the same stuff herself
strychnine
ugly way to die
norman found them
dead together
whispers
ln bed

in the window wasnt bates mother
now wait a minute sam
are you sure you saw an old woman
yes  ln the house
behind the motel
i called and pounded
but she just ignored me
you saw
norman bates mother
but it had to be
because arbogast said so too
and the young man wouldnt let him
see her because she was too ill
well if the woman up there
is mrs bates
whos that woman buried
out in greenlawn cemetery
now mother um

we thought wed drive out
to that motel with you
hes already been
went out before service
did you two have breakfast
didnt find anything
nothing lets
clear the way here
what did he say
about my sister
just what he told your detective
she used a fake name
saw the register myself saw the
whole place that boys alone there
no mother
you must have seen an illusion sam
i know youre not
the seeinillusions type
but no woman was there and i dont
believe in ghosts so there it is
i still feel
theres something
can see you do im sorry i couldnt
make you feel better
come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft
the sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law
thats the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein picked up
how bout that
i dont know
its sunday
come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime itll make it nicer
you too sam
thank you
maybe i am the seeingillusions type
no youre not
you want me to drop you at the hotel
sam
i still wont feel satisfied
until i go out there
neither will l
come on
we better decide what were gonna say
or do when we walk in there
were going to register
as man and wife
were going to
get shown to a cabin
and then were going to search every
inch of the place inside and out
truck door opens
closes
i wonder where norman bates
does his hermiting
someones at that window
i just saw the curtain move
come on
well
just coming up to ring for you
uhhuh
suppose you want a room
we were gonna try to make it
to san francisco
but we dont like the look
of that sky
looks like a bad day coming
doesnt it
ill take you to cabin ten
better sign in first hadnt we
thats not necessary
my boss is paying for this trip
and uh well its 90 business
he wants practically
notarized receipts
id better sign in
and get a receipt
thank you
ill get your bags
havent any
ill show you the room then
first time ive ever seen it happen
you check in any other place
in this country without bags
and you have to pay in advance
ten dollars
paper crinkling
that receipt
ill go on ahead
norman  all right theres
your receipt ill show you the cabin
dont bother yourself
well find it
sam we have to go into that cabin
and search it
no matter what were afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt
i know
do you think if something
happened it happened there
i dont know but if you had
a useless business like this motel
what would you need to get out
to get a new business somewhere else
forty thousand dollars
how could we prove that
if he opens a motel on
the new highway in say a year
there must be some proof
that exists now
something that proves he got
that money away from marion somehow
what makes you sound so certain
arbogast he liked me sam
or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel
the same way about you
i could tell the last time
i talked to him on the phone
he wouldnt have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us
unless he was stopped
and he was stopped so he must
have found out something
well start with cabin one
if he sees us
were just taking the air
bates
no shower curtain
sam  look
huh what is it
its figuring it didnt
get washed down look
some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40000
that proves marion was here
itd be too wild a coincidence
bates never denied she was here
oh doesnt that prove
he found out about the money
do we simply ask him
where hes hidden it
but that old woman whoever she is
she told arbogast something
i want her to tell us
the same thing
you cant go up there
why not
bates
well lets find him
one of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman
youll never be able to hold him
still if he doesnt want to be held
i dont like you going
into that house alone
i can handle a sick old woman
all right ill find bates
and keep him occupied
wait a minute
if you get anything
out of the mother
can you find your way
back to town
yes of course
if you do get anything
dont stop to tell me
you looking for me
why yes as a matter of fact
wifes taking a nap and
i never can keep quiet enough for her
so i thought id look you up and talk
good you satisfied with your cabin
oh its fine
ive been doing all the talking
so far havent i
i thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time
who did all the talking
when they got the chance
here you are
doing all the listening
you are alone here arent you
mmhmm
drive me crazy
i think that would be a rather
extreme reaction dont you
just an expression what i meant was
uh id do anything to get away
wouldnt you
no
knocking on door
mrs bates
gasps
sighs
im not saying you
shouldnt be contented here
im just doubting that you are
i think if you saw a chance to get out
from under youd unload this place
this place this place happens
to be my only world
i grew up in that house
i had a very happy childhood
my mother and i
were more than happy
you look frightened have i been
saying something frightening
i dont know
what youve been saying
ive been talking about your mother
about your motel
how you gonna do it
do what
buy a new one in a new town where you
wont have to hide your mother
why dont you just get in
your car and drive away
where will you get the money to do that
or do you already have it socked away
shut up
a lot of it forty thousand dollars
i bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it
i think
shell tell us
wheres that girl you came here with
where is she
mrs bates its
screaming
footsteps
norman yelling
norman bates
screaming
people chattering
if anyone gets any answers
itll be the psychiatrist
even i couldnt get to norman
and he knows me
you warm enough miss
yes
did he talk
to you
no
i got the whole story but not from
norman i got it from his mother
norman bates
no longer exists
he only halfexisted
to begin with
and now the other half
has taken over
probably for all time
did he kill my sister
yes and no
now look if youre trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop
chuckling  a psychiatrist
doesnt lay the groundwork
he merely tries
to explain it
but my sister is
yes
yes im sorry
the private investigator too
if you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel youll
uh have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books
yes two
young girls
did he confess to
like i said
the mother
to understand it the way i understood
it hearing it from the mother
that is from the mother half
of normans mind
you have to go back
ten years
to the time when norman murdered
his mother and her lover
he was already dangerously disturbed
had been since his father died
his mother was
a clinging demanding woman
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world
then she met a man
and it seemed to norman that
she threw him over for this man
that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both
matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all
most unbearable
to the son who commits it
so he had to erase the crime
at least in his own mind
he stole her corpse
a weighted coffin
was buried
he hid the body
in the fruit cellar
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep
and that still
wasnt enough
she was there
but she was a corpse
so he began to think
and speak for her
give her half his life
so to speak
at times he could be both personalities
carry on conversations
at other times the mother half
took over completely
he was never all norman
but he was often only mother
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him
therefore if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman
the mother side of him
would go wild
when he met your sister
he was touched by her
aroused by her
he wanted her
that set off the jealous mother
and mother killed the girl
after the murder norman returned
as if from a deep sleep
and like a dutiful son covered up
all traces of the crime
he was convinced
his mother had committed
why was he
dressed like that
hes a transvestite
uh not exactly
a man who dresses in womens clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change
or satisfaction
is a transvestite
but in normans case he was simply
doing everything possible
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive
and when reality
came to close
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion
he dressed up even to
a cheap wig he bought
hed walk about the house
sit in her chair speak in her voice
he tried to be
his mother
and uh now he is
thats what i meant when i said
i got the story from the mother
you see when the mind
houses two personalities
theres always
a conflict a battle
in normans case
the battle is over
and the dominant personality
has won
and the 40000
who got that
the swamp these were
crimes of passion not profit
he feels a little chill
can i bring him this blanket
oh sure
all right
norman speaking as mother
thank you
mothers voice  its sad when
a mother has to speak the words
that condemn her own son
but i couldnt allow them
to believe that i would commit murder
theyll put him away now
as i should have years ago
he was always bad
and in the end
he intended to tell them i killed
those girls and that man
as if i could do anything
except sit and stare
iike one
of his stuffed birds
they know i cant even
move a finger and i wont
ill just sit here and be quiet
just in case they do suspect me
theyre probably watching me
well let them
let them see
what kind of a person i am
im not even
gonna swat that fly
i hope they are watching
theyll see
theyll see
