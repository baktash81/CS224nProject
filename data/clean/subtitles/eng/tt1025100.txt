through a dirty mirror
i thought you were on the roof
i was he got a line on me
i had to jump down
what do we always drill
you hold the high ground
you put his back
against the wall
and you dont let him go

subtitles by subtrader
subscenecom
danny aniko
thank you for your time
here are the samples
this i can do for you
in two days
this i need in two hours
we got a meeting with yuri
he agreed to sit with us
you all right
i think i know why
hes as good as you henry
he is you
what
theres a dna lab here
i gave them samples
yours and the baseball cap
he was wearing
he just
he looked so much like you
i thought he had to be
your son so i
they did three tests
your dna and his
all three came back identical
not close identical
as in the same person
hes your clone
they thought id made a mistake
given them samples of
the same person
but i didnt
he is you
hows that even possible
its complicated
but its doable
all youd really need
is a surrogate mother
and a dna sample
if they could clone a person
youd think theyd clone
more doctors or scientists
not me
they couldve cloned
nelson mandela
nelson mandela couldnt
kill a man on a moving train
from two kilometers away
baron yuri
footsteps approaching
mr brogan
yuri before we begin
i must confess
i have admired your work
for many years
wait so you know who i am
yuri laughs
a longtime listener
firsttime caller
as they say in your country
i would congratulate you
on your retirement
but your last job
has loose ends yes
yeah well
my government lied to me
then tried to kill me
if thats what you mean
yes
in russia
we call that tuesday
but americans
it hurts your feelings
so
so why was dormov
trying to go back to russia
and why was i sent to kill him
yes down to business
ooh very american
you are a busy man
we were both friends with jack
he was a good man
im mourning his death
like you
but the reason you are here
and i have not killed you
yet
is we share a common enemy
clay verris
he lured dormov to the west
funded his lab
and now you have met
the fruits of their labor
henry sighs
dolly the sheep
was cloned in 96
but in 95
i was the sheep
take it as a compliment
and you are the only one
with your dna
verris raised the boy
as his own son
trained him to be
the perfect assassin
so why was dormov
trying to leave
for years
we tried to lure him back
nothing
then last year
they had a falling out
dormov got scared
reached out to me
so i
that still doesnt explain
why i was sent to kill him
we have indications
dormov made a breakthrough
modified human dna
a path to mass production
but dormov wanted soldiers
to be stronger smarter
verris
verris wanted something else
what something else
mr brogan
you are the best at what you do
but still you get tired
you have fears doubts
you feel pain perhaps remorse
you have a conscience
this makes you human
but suboptimal as a soldier
less than perfect
less profitable
clayton verris
is playing god with dna
he must be stopped
if its that dangerous
why not send a missile
blow up his lab
that is what were doing
except you are the missile
i wish you luck
oh one last thing
your escape from home
two days ago
exhales amazing work
i was on the edge of my seat
wait what
how the hell do you know
about that
im a big fan
what can i say
danny  if even half
of what hes saying is true
we gotta talk to this kid
youre not gonna be safe
until you do
oh so you think if your
50yearold self showed up
and told you you were her clone
that would make you calmer
fiftyone
what
just saying
you know youre 51 henry
im rounding
right
hes the mirror you dont
want to look into henry
but hes our best shot
at getting to verris

youve been given isnt right
a job is a job maam
danny i wonder how much
you paid the custodian
wow
left
undo the chain
basement
you must really know the city
junior
i watch a lot of nat geo
it says offlimits
maam
danny sighs ooh
wonder how many people
are buried down here
junior stand over there
junior go
danny if you knock out
all the lights
how are you gonna see
your own trip wire
on the way out
a grenade is no joke
i mean i get the idea
darkness neutralizes
his biggest strength
and close quarters
favors you right
i mean he cant throw a grenade
without killing me too
but what if he tries gas
you know
or some sort of sedative agent
way ahead of me
gas mask and night vision
very smart
over there
and zip ties
these must be for me
but can i ask you something
would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer
how much do you know about him
anybody tell you
why they wanted him dead
guy cracked
killed eight ops in
a single night and his spotter
thats what they told you
thats what he did
no no not exactly
i was there the night
all those operatives were hit
theyd been sent to kill him
and me by gemini
and not that it matters
but his spotter was shot
in virginia
and the rest of those men
went down in savannah
henry can shoot longdistance
but he cant shoot that long
come on just think
does that make any sense to you
tape rips
do you understand
what im saying
it doesnt
junior better
fuck you
explosion
clattering
grunting
panting
henry get up go
stay right there
pocketknife clicks
tape rips
sighs thank you
here
you know how to light
one of those
oh jesus henry
hey thanks for the tip
on the grenade
you were talking to him
the whole time
henry yeah
you either search somebody
or you dont
and for the record
i do not want to kill you
but i absolutely will
if i have to
what did clay verris
tell you about me
okay well
let me tell you about him
because i know mr verris
very well
howd he start you
hunting birds rabbit
about 12 years old
moved you up to deer
im guessing 19 20 years old
the first time he ordered you
to shoot a person
any of this ringing true
yeah
he told you to
lean into your fear
because you were a warrior
blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak
but he couldnt stop
the noise
that secret part of you
that always felt
a little different
than everybody else
part that felt like a weirdo
chuckles
you dont know shit
kid i know you inside out
and backwards
youre allergic to bees
you hate cilantro
you always sneeze four times
everybody hates cilantro
youre meticulous
thorough disciplined
relentless
you love puzzles
youre a chess player right
good too i bet
but you suffer from insomnia
your mind never lets you sleep
and even when it does
it attacks you with nightmares
im talking bout those
threeoclockinthemorning
somebodypleasesaveme
kind of nightmares
and then theres the doubts
and those are the worst
you hate em
and you hate yourself
for having em
they make you feel weak
a real soldier
doesnt doubt right
the only time you ever
truly feel happy
is when youre flat
on your belly
about to squeeze a trigger
and in that moment
the world makes perfect sense
how do you think
i know all of that
i dont give a shit
how you know anything
look at me dummy
look at us
twentyfive years ago
your father took my blood
and he cloned me
he made you from me
our dna is identical
hes telling you the truth
shut up
henry he chose me
cause theres never been
anybody like me
and he knew one day
i was gonna get old
and then youd step in
hes been lying to you
the whole time
he told you you were an orphan
and of all the people
in the world
to come after me
why would he send you
because im the best
you are obviously not the best
scoffs
you got a hardass head
guess this was supposed to be
your birthday or something
i had to die
and you had to do it
as long as i was alive
somehow clays little experiment
was incomplete
thats the maniac
youre pulling a trigger for
shut your mouth about him
youre just trying to rattle me
im trying to save you
sighs what are you 23
still a virgin right
yeah
dying to be in a relationship
and connect
but terrified to
let anybody near you
because what if somebody
actually saw who you are
how could they love you
so everybodys just targets
and youre just a weapon
hey hey

i need to get some sleep

door lock clicks
clay tell me something
why is it so hard for you
to kill this man
you know how much i hate
big hammock park pop
what
ever since i was about
12 years old
we would shoot turkeys there
for my birthday
and i always hated it
but i was an orphan right
so how would we even know
when my birthday was
but you never seemed to notice
so we just keep going
okay so next year
well try chuck e cheese
yeah
you me
and the lab guys who made me
oh
yeah
i um
always believed
youd be happier not knowing
junior scoffs
happy
you know when im happy pop
when im flat on my belly
about to squeeze a trigger
its the only time im happy
and this wasnt even a mistake
its not like
you got someone pregnant
and then had to man up
and raise me
no you made a decision
to have a scientist make
a person out of another person
no thats not what it was
thats exactly what it was
then you sent me
to kill him
of all the shooters
in the world
why would you send me
hes your darkness
you had to walk through this
on your own
maybe youre my darkness
that lie you told me
that my parents
dumped me at a fire station
and i believed that
do you know how
that made me feel
it was a necessary lie
none of this shit is necessary
you made a choice
to do this to me
cant you see how not okay i am
bullshit
you forget who
youre talking to junior
ive seen battle
ive seen soldiers
go over the edge
because more was being
asked of them
than they could give
thats not you
your world is stable
and dependable
i made sure of that
you have something
that henry himself never had
you have a loving dedicated
present father
who tells you every goddamn day
that you are precious
and that you matter
jesus the whole point
of this thing
was to give you
all of henrys gifts
without his pain and i did
dont doubt junior
youre better than that
whimpering
come here
clay sighs
i love you son
just dont let yourself down
sobbing clears throat
thuds

are you okay
khafji
watching you go house to house
wishing i had
a whole division of men
all as good as you
wondering if that
could be possible
you should be flattered
chuckles
you should be dead
clay you saw
what happened over there
atrocities
friends being sent home
in a pine box
why should we accept that
if theres a better way
and look what we created
hes got both of us in him
dont you think
your country deserves
a perfect version of you
there is no
perfect version of me
or him or anybody
clay no
he was on his way to yemen
now thanks to you
his place is gonna be taken
by someone with parents
someone who feels pain fear
which we had edited out of him
someone with
just as many weaknesses
as the terrorists
that were trying to kill
and youre gonna tell me
thats better
so why not make
a whole army of them
yeah why not
think how many american families
we could spare
nobodys son or daughter
would ever have to die
no vet comes home with ptsd
and kills himself
we can keep the whole world safe
without any actual grief
so who would i be hurting
youre talking about
people clay
henry
this is the most humane thing
that geminis ever done
how many more of me
are running around out there
theres only one you junior
he was a weapon
youre my son
and i love you
as much as any father
ever loved any kid
i dont have a father
goodbye clay
henry hey hey

shut down his lab
