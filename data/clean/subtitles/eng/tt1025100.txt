they did three tests 
your dna and his 
all three came back identical 
not close  identical 
as in  the same person  
he s your clone 
they thought i d made a mistake 
given them samples of
the same person 
but i didn t 
he is you 
how s that even possible 
it s complicated 
but it s doable 
all you d really need

yes  down to business 
ooh  very american 
you are a busy man 
we were both friends with jack 
he was a good man 
i m mourning his death 
like you 
but the reason you are here
and i have not killed you   
yet   
is we share a common enemy 
clay verris 
he lured dormov to the west 
funded his lab 
and now you have met
the fruits of their labor 
 henry sighs 
dolly the sheep
was cloned in  96 
but in  95  
i was the sheep 
take it as a compliment 
and you are the only one 
with your dna 
verris raised the boy
as his own son 
trained him to be
the perfect assassin 
so why was dormov
trying to leave 
for years 
we tried to lure him back 
nothing 
then last year 
they had a falling out 
dormov got scared 
reached out to me 
so  i  
that still doesn t explain
why i was sent to kill him 
we have indications
dormov made a breakthrough 
modified human dna 
a path to mass production 
but dormov wanted soldiers
to be stronger  smarter 
verris   
verris wanted something else 
what something else 
mr  brogan 
you are the best at what you do 
but still you get tired 
you have fears  doubts 
you feel pain  perhaps remorse 
you have a conscience 
this makes you human 
but suboptimal as a soldier 
less than perfect 
less profitable 
clayton verris
is playing god with dna 
he must be stopped 
if it s that dangerous 
why not send a missile 
blow up his lab 
that is what we re doing 
except you are the missile 
i wish you luck 
oh  one last thing 
your escape from home
two days ago 
 exhales  amazing work

 danny   if even half
of what he s saying is true 
we gotta talk to this kid 
you re not gonna be safe
until you do 
oh  so you think if your
50 year old self showed up
and told you you were her clone 
that would make you calmer 
fifty one 
what 
just saying 
you know you re 51  henry 
i m rounding 
right

besides  he wants me 
 door slams 
 man whistles 
 junior  right

 cell phone beeping 
 line ringing 
thank you 
brogan 
in 12 minutes 
i m putting two bullets
in the back of her head 
your orders are
to deliver her safely 
my orders are to kill you 
are you familiar with
the quartz chamber
of the catacombs 
negative  we re doing this
someplace visible 
where i can see you 
now you have 11 minutes 
 cell phone beeps 
get dressed 
we re taking a ride 
 danny  cab was a smart move 
where are you from 
your formality  it s southern 
you know  if you re gonna use me
as bait and possibly murder me 
then the least you can do
is indulge me in
some conversation 
 junior  just outside atlanta 
 danny  you two have
a lot in common 
i doubt that 
 danny  you d be surprised 
you know 
i started following him too 
just like you re doing 
then i got to know him 
he s got a big heart  like you 
what do you know about my heart 
i know that you have one 
and i know that it s telling you
that something about the job
you ve been given isn t right 
a job is a job  ma am 
 danny  i wonder how much
you paid the custodian 
wow 
left 
undo the chain 
basement 
you must really know the city 
 junior 
i watch a lot of nat geo 
it says  off limits  
ma am 
 danny sighs  ooh 
wonder how many people
are buried down here 
 junior  stand over there 
 junior  go 
 danny  if you knock out
all the lights 
how are you gonna see
your own trip wire
on the way out 
a grenade is no joke 
i mean  i get the idea 
darkness neutralizes
his biggest strength 
and close quarters
favors you  right 
i mean  he can t throw a grenade
without killing me too 
but what if he tries gas 
you know 
or some sort of sedative agent 
way ahead of me 
gas mask and night vision 
very smart 
over there 
and zip ties 
these must be for me 
but can i ask you something 
would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer 
how much do you know about him 
anybody tell you
why they wanted him dead 
guy cracked 
killed eight ops in
a single night and his spotter 
that s what they told you 
that s what he did 
no  no  not exactly 
i was there the night
all those operatives were hit 
they d been sent to kill him 
and me  by gemini 
and not that it matters 
but his spotter was shot
in virginia 
and the rest of those men
went down in savannah 
henry can shoot long distance 
but he can t shoot that long 
come on  just think 
does that make any sense to you 
 tape rips 
do you understand
what i m saying 
it doesn t  
 junior  better 
fuck you 
 explosion 
 clattering 
 grunting 
 panting 
 henry  get up  go 
stay right there 
 pocketknife clicks 
 tape rips 
 sighs  thank you 
here 
you know how to light
one of those 
oh  jesus  henry 
hey  thanks for the tip
on the grenade 
you were talking to him
the whole time 
 henry  yeah 
you either search somebody
or you don t 
and for the record   
i do not want to kill you 
but i absolutely will
if i have to 
what did clay verris
tell you about me 
okay  well 
let me tell you about him 
because i know mr  verris
very well 
how d he start you 
hunting birds  rabbit 
about 12 years old 
moved you up to deer 
i m guessing 19  20 years old
the first time he ordered you
to shoot a person 
any of this ringing true 
yeah 
he told you to
 lean into your fear  
because you were  a warrior 
blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak  
but he couldn t stop
the noise   
that secret part of you
that always felt
a little different
than everybody else 
part that felt like a weirdo 
 chuckles 
you don t know shit 
kid  i know you inside out
and backwards 
you re allergic to bees 
you hate cilantro 
you always sneeze four times 
everybody hates cilantro 
you re meticulous 
thorough  disciplined 
relentless 
you love puzzles 
you re a chess player  right 
good  too  i bet 
but you suffer from insomnia 
your mind never lets you sleep 
and even when it does 
it attacks you with nightmares 
i m talking  bout those
three o clock in the morning 
somebody please save me
kind of nightmares 
and then there s the doubts 
and those are the worst 
you hate  em 
and you hate yourself
for having  em 
they make you feel weak 
a real soldier
doesn t doubt  right 
the only time you ever
truly feel happy
is when you re flat
on your belly
about to squeeze a trigger 
and in that moment 
the world makes perfect sense 
how do you think
i know all of that 
i don t give a shit
how you know anything 
look at me  dummy 
look at us 
twenty five years ago 
your father took my blood
and he cloned me 
he made you from me 
our dna is identical 
he s telling you the truth 
shut up 
 henry  he chose me
 cause there s never been
anybody like me 
and he knew one day
i was gonna get old
and then you d step in 
he s been lying to you
the whole time 
he told you you were an orphan 
and of all the people
in the world
to come after me 
why would he send you 
because i m the best 
you are obviously not the best 
 scoffs 
you got a hard ass head 
guess this was supposed to be
your birthday or something 
i had to die 
and you had to do it 
as long as i was alive 
somehow clay s little experiment
was incomplete 
that s the maniac
you re pulling a trigger for 
shut your mouth about him 
you re just trying to rattle me 
i m trying to save you 
 sighs  what are you  23 
still a virgin  right 
yeah 
dying to be in a relationship
and connect 
but terrified to
let anybody near you 
because what if somebody
actually saw who you are 
how could they love you 
so everybody s just targets 
and you re just a weapon 
hey  hey 
 grunting 
 groans

 groans 
where to

 henry sighs  man 
that poor kid 
he must be terrified 
and he s going home 
walking into a buzz saw 
i need to get some sleep

mm mm  not me 
that s where the ghosts are

 door lock clicks 
 clay  tell me something 
why is it so hard for you
to kill this man 
you know how much i hate
big hammock park  pop 
what 
ever since i was about
12 years old   
we would shoot turkeys there
for my birthday 
and i always hated it 
but i was an orphan  right 
so  how would we even know
when my birthday was 
but you never seemed to notice 
so we just keep going 
okay  so  next year
we ll try chuck e  cheese 
yeah 
you  me 
and the lab guys who made me 
oh 
yeah 
i  um   
always believed   
you d be happier not knowing 
 junior scoffs 
happy 
you know when i m happy  pop 
when i m flat on my belly 
about to squeeze a trigger 
it s the only time i m happy 
and this wasn t even a mistake 
it s not like
you got someone pregnant
and then had to man up
and raise me 
no  you made a decision
to have a scientist make
a person out of another person 
no  that s not what it was 
that s exactly what it was 
then you sent me   
to kill him 
of all the shooters
in the world 
why would you send me 
he s your darkness 
you had to walk through this
on your own 
maybe you re my darkness 
that lie you told me   
that my parents   
dumped me at a fire station 
and i believed that 
do you know how
that made me feel 
it was a necessary lie 
none of this shit is necessary 
you made a choice
to do this to me 
can t you see how not okay i am 
bullshit 
you forget who
you re talking to  junior 
i ve seen battle 
i ve seen soldiers
go over the edge
because more was being
asked of them
than they could give 
that s not you 
your world is stable
and dependable 
i made sure of that 
you have something
that henry himself never had 
you have a loving  dedicated 
present father 
who tells you every goddamn day
that you are precious
and that you matter 
jesus  the whole point
of this thing
was to give you
all of henry s gifts
without his pain  and i did 
don t doubt  junior 
you re better than that 
 whimpering 
come here 
 clay sighs 
i love you  son 
just don t let yourself down 
 sobbing  clears throat

you were the inspiration

you know where i got the idea 
are you okay 
khafji 
watching you go house to house 
wishing i had
a whole division of men
all as good as you 
wondering if that
could be possible 
you should be flattered 
 chuckles 
you should be dead 
 clay  you saw
what happened over there 
atrocities 
friends being sent home
in a pine box 
why should we accept that
if there s a better way 
and look what we created 
he s got both of us in him 
don t you think
your country deserves
a perfect version of you 
there is no
perfect version of me 
or him  or anybody 
 clay  no 
he was on his way to yemen 
now  thanks to you 
his place is gonna be taken
by someone with parents 
someone who feels pain  fear 
which we had edited out of him 
someone with
just as many weaknesses
as the terrorists
that we re trying to kill 
and you re gonna tell me
that s better 
so why not make
a whole army of them 
yeah  why not 
think how many american families
we could spare 
nobody s son or daughter
would ever have to die 
no vet comes home with ptsd
and kills himself 
we can keep the whole world safe
without any actual grief 
so    who would i be hurting 
you re talking about
people  clay 
henry 
this is the most humane thing
that gemini s ever done 
how many more of me
are running around out there 
there s only one you  junior 
he was a weapon 
you re my son

i don t have a father 
goodbye  clay 
 henry  hey  hey

you don t want those ghosts 
trust me 
 soft rock playing on speaker 
 henry  you should
know better than that
