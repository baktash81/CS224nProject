its as important to be able to
describe what im doing
as it is to do what im doing
when to say what
what words to select
some men hate to hear
certain terms
they cant stand
specific moves and
then they cant live
without others
its part of my job to know
where to place my hand
my lips my tongue my leg
and even my thoughts
what kind of pressure
for how long when to stop
i can become your first kiss
or a torn out image
from a playboy magazine
that you found
when you were nine years old
am i your secretary
or am i your daughter
maybe im your seventh grade
math teacher you always hated
all i know is that
if i do it just right
i can become
your living breathing
unflinching dream
and then i can actually
disappear

it was when you guys met
i used to make you tell me that story over
and over again about how you two met
she was the most beautiful woman
youd ever seen
that she was everything
that you werent
there you are
hey theyre amazing
sorry i think
i think i was going through some
some weird form of insecurity
or a midlife crisis or something
but lets just forget this
whole thing happened
well i already did
forget it
no i already saw him
you saw him where
i was at the cafe and i
i approached him like you asked me to
and we went to lunch
you wait you had lunch
with my husband
yeah it was a picnic
kind of
we bought some sandwiches
and then i asked him
about his teaching
and he started talking
about his music
and he kind of stared at me
and then what
and then he asked me
if he could kiss me
i didnt ask you to do that
but then he said he could not
kiss me because hes married
you see
at first he was hesitant
at first
and then he asked me
if there was somewhere
he could kiss me where
no one would see us
and
i said to him that we
should go to allen gardens
you know that place down the street
with the big big greenhouse
do you want me to stop
no
we walked through this big long
corridor with all these exotic flowers
there was nobody around
i love allen gardens
its always so warm
and the airjust feels
so beautiful
its like youre suddenly
in a different country
i knew theres a place in the back
where they keep tools and stuff
no one ever goes to
that section
its like a secret hiding place
he brought his mouth up
to my lips
and we hovered there
for a long time
i could feel he was
excited through his pants
thats enough
you were supposed to meet up
with my husband
and see what he did and
then report back to me
i dont really know
what you want
i shouldnt have involved
you in this i made a mistake
damn it

trying to get out of this spot

im going to take them off
just hold that to stop the
bleeding okay
im sorry
you think it will scar
no it shouldnt
we were hidden deep in this
forest of exotic plants and trees
and we could hear voices
in the distance
but we were pretty sure no one
could actually see us
and i pushed my hand down
his pants and felt him
and then i
i moved my hand lightly on him
right
and then i kept doing this
moving my hand on him
in his pants
and he said to me i cant come
i cant come i have to go to work
but i didnt stop
and then i bit his tongue
and then
just then he came in my hand
and then what
and then he had to go to work
so he walked away
