it s as important to be able to
describe what i m doing
as it is to do what i m doing 
when to say what 
what words to select 
some men hate to hear
certain terms 
they can t stand
specific moves and
then they can t live
without others 
it s part of my job to know
where to place my hand 
my lips  my tongue  my leg
and even my thoughts 
what kind of pressure 
for how long  when to stop 
i can become your first kiss   
or a torn out image
from a playboy magazine
that you found
when you were nine years old 
am i your secretary
or am i your daughter 
maybe i m your seventh grade
math teacher you always hated 
all i know is that
if i do it just right 
i can become
your living  breathing 
unflinching dream 
and then i can actually
disappear 
dr  stewart

i mean  you    dad  did you
feel that way like about mom 
like  was that how
it was when you guys met 
i used to make you tell me that story over
and over again about how you two met 
she was the most beautiful woman
you d ever seen 
that she was everything
that you weren t   
there you are 
hey  they re amazing 
sorry  i think   
i think i was going through some   
some weird form of insecurity
or a mid life crisis or something
but let s just forget this
whole thing happened 
well  i already did 
forget it 
no  i already saw him 
you saw him  where 
i was at the cafe and i   
i approached him like you asked me to 
and we went to lunch 
you    wait  you had lunch
with my husband 
yeah  it was a picnic 
kind of 
we bought some sandwiches 
and then i asked him
about his teaching
and he started talking
about his music 
and he kind of stared at me 
and then what 
and then he asked me
if he could kiss me 
i didn t ask you to do that 
but then he said he could not
kiss me because he s married 
you see 
at first he was hesitant 
at first 
and then he asked me
if there was somewhere
he could kiss me where
no one would see us 
and   
i said to him that we
should go to allen gardens 
you know that place down the street
with the big    big greenhouse 
do you want me to stop 
no 
we walked through this big long
corridor with all these exotic flowers 
there was nobody around 
i love allen gardens 
it s always so warm 
and the airjust feels
so beautiful 
it s like you re suddenly
in a different country 
i knew there s a place in the back 
where they keep tools and stuff 
no one ever goes to
that section 
it s like a secret hiding place 
he brought his mouth up
to my lips
and we hovered there
for a long time 
i could feel he was
excited through his pants 
that s enough 
you were supposed to meet up
with my husband
and see what he did and
then report back to me 
i don t really know
what you want 
i shouldn t have involved
you in this  i made a mistake 
damn it 
god  i m so sorry  i was just
trying to get out of this spot 
is your

moving up just a little 
ow

when you might need it

sorry 
i m   
i m going to take them off 
just hold that to stop the
bleeding  okay 
i m sorry 
you think it will scar 
no  it shouldn t 
we were hidden  deep in this
forest of exotic plants and trees 
and we could hear voices
in the distance
but we were pretty sure no one
could actually see us 
and i pushed my hand down
his pants and felt him 
and then i   
i moved my hand lightly on him 
right 
and then i kept doing this 
moving my hand on him
in his pants 
and he said to me   i can t come 
i can t come  i have to go to work  
but i didn t stop 
and then i bit his tongue 
and then   
just then he came in my hand 
and then what 
and then he had to go to work
so he walked away 
i don t want to be rude 
uh    i want you   
i want you to be clean

with a picnic in the park 
at allen gardens
in the conservatory 
she said she kissed you and
she could feel you getting excited 
it was    it was confusing 
itjust    but it made me feel
closer to you 
you become more beautiful
every year 
every    every grey hair 
every line 
everything that happens to you
makes you so much more desirable
and i feel like
if you were to blow on me
i d vanish 
i d disappear 
i felt so invisible
and so old 
i slept with her 
you and i used to make love
three times a day 
and then every day 
and then once a week 
and then was born and then we
became parents and we were best friends 
and i didn t know how to go from
being your best friend to being your lover 
you stopped touching me 
david  i couldn t
look at myself
