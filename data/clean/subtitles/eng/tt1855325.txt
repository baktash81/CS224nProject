the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world
l was head of security at a secret
hightech facility called the hive
a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental viral weaponry
there was an incident
a virus escaped
a lot of people died
the trouble was
they didnt stay dead
the computer that controlled the hive
was a stateoftheart
artificial intelligence
the red queen
the red queen responded to the threat
of the viral outbreak in an extreme way
she went homicidal
youre all going to die down here
the red queen
attempted to kill everyone
down
whether they were infected or not
l managed to escape
but this was only the beginning
viral outbreaks spread like wildfire
first across the united states
then the world
the tvirus didnt just
bring the dead back to life
lt mutated them in terrifying ways
despite the apocalypse
they had created
the umbrella corporation continued
to experiment with the deadly virus
l was infected
but the virus bonded with me
on a cellular level
l developed powers
your genetic structure is the key
l became different
powerful
unstoppable
as l got stronger
the human race became weaker
i tried my best to lead
what survivors l could find to safety
but we were pursued relentlessly
even my friend jill valentine was seized
and brainwashed by umbrella
shoot to kill
finally l confronted
the head of the umbrella corporation
albert wesker
he robbed me of my powers
but l still managed to defeat him
at last we thought it was over
we thought we had survived
the horror
but we were wrong
once again
we found ourselves fighting
for our lives
go go go
rise and shine

welcome to umbrella central control
oh yeah
dont
my name is
ada wong
operative for the umbrella corporation
one of albert weskers top agents
l know exactly who and what you are
now the real question is
why dont l just cancel
your contract right now
l dont work for umbrella anymore
and neither does albert wesker
l dont care
you can kill her if you like
but then youll never get out
of this place
wesker
now be a good girl
put down the knife
and alice
how nice to see you again
how did she get out
shes obviously getting help
we have a traitor in this facility
security systems were shut down
for two minutes
what about control
we still
cant raise them
l executed everyone
in this control room
l enabled wesker
to hack the mainframe
we shut down the security systems
we let you out of that cell
we have to get you out of this facility
so why do you want to help me
we need you
the human race faces extinction
our only hope of survival
is for us to work together
lm not going anywhere
until l know where we are
and what the hell is going on here
youre in the prime umbrella
testing facility
explain tokyo
what you saw was just
a detailed recreation
nothing more
lt goes on for a few city blocks
thats all
l was outside
were you
saw the sky did you
lt was night
stars the moon
the testing floor is 300 feet high
the ceiling black
its usually night in there
but isnt that when
the monsters come out anyway
lt was raining
climate control
wind rain
they can even make it snow
if they want to
why build such a place
simple
the umbrella corporation
derived its primary income
from the sale of viral weaponry
something thats impossible
to test in the real
world they recreated the center
of new york
simulated an outbreak
showed it to the russians
and sold them the virus
they simulated an outbreak in moscow
sold it to the americans
an outbreak in tokyo
sold it to the chinese
an outbreak in china
sold it to the japanese
exactly everyone had to have it
the umbrella corporation
built a new arms race
only this time
it was biological rather than nuclear
highly profitable
and this is where it all happened
this is umbrellas greatest creation
the belly of the beast
so why dont we
just get the hell out of here
stop
sunup is in less than a minute
why dont you
just see for yourself
this facility is located
in the straits of kamchatka
northern russia
the old soviet union
built submarine pens here
in the 80s
after the cold war ended
the umbrella corporation
expanded them
and built the testing floor
no one has ever escaped
from this facility
lce
youll need all the help you can get
so lve arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you
there they are
lntake vents for the umbrella facility
looks abandoned
thats what they want you to think
lets move we have just two hours
to extract alice and ada
after that we can expect
heavy umbrella reinforcements
running a bypass
these are
the codes from ada
do you trust her
just enter the numbers
the charges are set
were in
lets go do this
theyre in
the strike team has secured an elevator
for your escape to the surface
they will eliminate
umbrella resistance
then rendezvous with us
and escort us out
they have a friend
of yours with them
luther west
hes alive
all right hold on ladies
synchronize watches
two hours exactly in
three two one mark
leon
why dont we
trigger remotely
cant risk them jamming the signal
and whether we succeed or not
this facility has to be destroyed
what if we take longer than two hours
then l hope youre really good
at holding your breath
security chief valentine
has reached the tokyo test environment
shes tracking
you
theyre headed this way
her orders are to recapture you
if possible
terminate you if necessary
whos giving these orders
the red queen
the computer
yes
the same artificial intelligence
you encountered in the hive
she now controls what remains
of the umbrella corporation
she will stop at nothing
to prevent you escaping to the surface
lve plotted
an escape route for you
youll cross the new york
environment to suburbia
where youll rendezvous
with the strike team
theyll escort you
through the moscow environment
to the submarine pens
and take the elevator
back to the surface
the red queen
has intercepted my signal
shes about to regain control
of this facility
you must hurry l cant
dont listen to the traitor wesker
l am in control now
project alice
ada wong
stay where you are
lets move
project alice
youre all going to die down here
lve heard that before
defensive formation
mark your targets
fire at will
submarine pens are up ahead
barry you and l take point
we rendezvous with alice and ada
in 30 minutes
clear
now thats some hardware
typhoon class
the biggest nuclear subs
the soviets ever built
umbrella used them to secretly transport
bioweapons all over the globe
lets pick up the pace
we have less than 90 minutes
lntruders detected
targeted for termination
new york
we need to cross two more
test environments to escape
lets move
why would umbrella continue
to run these tests
they want to study the biohazard
learn how to control it
lnitialize new york sequence
activate biohazard
stand by stand by
new york sequence initialized
the red queen
shes activating
bioweapons to stop us lets go
wait
you hear that
you know what it is
l have an idea
oh you have got to be kidding me
hey boys
bad idea
lets move
were behind schedule
whats going on
lts the end of the sequence
they rarely last more than an hour
come on
before the red queen
activates something else
targets survived
security chief valentine to intercept
lntruders entering
moscow test environment
activate las plagas undead
whats going on
the red queen knows were here
keep your eyes open
stand by stand by
moscow sequence initialized
what
listen
right there
what the hell are those things
fall back
clouds
theyre not real
lts a holographic projection
when they were running
a simulation
trust me
no one was looking at the sky
this is the rendezvous point
the strike team is late
where are they
theres movement
in the house behind you
upstairs window
why would they be in here
theyre using clones of me
of course
you were one of the 50 basic models
basic models
how do you think umbrella
populates these test scenarios
hundreds of people dead each time
they run a simulation
umbrella imprints them
with basic memories
just enough to ensure
a correct emotional response
to the threat of the biohazard
ln one life she could be
a suburban housewife
the next a businesswoman
in new york
the next
a soldier working for umbrella
mommy
l hid
like you told me
what happened to your clothes
and your hair
rpg down
were running out of time
you have to find us a way out now

she was a blank slate
l could show you a dozen
just like her in cold storage
lm sorry but its true
