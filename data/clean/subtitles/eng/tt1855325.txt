   the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world 
l was head of security at a secret
high tech facility called the hive   
   a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental  viral weaponry 
there was an incident 
a virus escaped 
a lot of people died 
the trouble was 
they didn t stay dead 
the computer that controlled the hive
was a state of the art   
   artificial intelligence 
the red queen 
the red queen responded to the threat
of the viral outbreak in an extreme way 
she went homicidal 
you re all going to die down here 
the red queen
attempted to kill everyone   
 down 
    whether they were infected or not 
l managed to escape 
but this was only the beginning 
viral outbreaks spread like wildfire   
   first across the united states 
then the world 
the t virus didn t just
bring the dead back to life 
lt mutated them in terrifying ways 
despite the apocalypse
they had created   
   the umbrella corporation continued
to experiment with the deadly virus 
l was infected 
but the virus bonded with me
on a cellular level 
l developed powers 
your genetic structure is the key 
l became different 
powerful 
unstoppable 
as l got stronger 
the human race became weaker 
i tried my best to lead
what survivors l could find to safety   
   but we were pursued relentlessly 
even my friend jill valentine was seized
and brainwashed by umbrella 
shoot to kill 
finally  l confronted
the head of the umbrella corporation   
   albert wesker 
he robbed me of my powers 
but l still managed to defeat him 
at last  we thought it was over 
we thought we had survived
the horror 
but we were wrong 
once again 
we found ourselves fighting   
   for our lives 
go  go  go 
rise and shine 
come on  babe  we re late

welcome to umbrella central control 
oh  yeah 
don t 
 my name is  
 ada wong 
operative for the umbrella corporation 
one of albert wesker s top agents 
l know exactly who and what you are 
now  the real question is 
why don t l just cancel
your contract right now 
l don t work for umbrella anymore   
   and neither does albert wesker 
l don t care 
you can kill her if you like   
   but then you ll never get out
of this place 
 wesker 
 now  be a good girl 
put down the knife 
and  alice   
   how nice to see you again 
how did she get out 
she s obviously getting help 
we have a traitor in this facility 
security systems were shut down
for two minutes 
 what about control 
 we still   
   can t raise them 
l executed everyone   
   in this control room 
l enabled wesker
to hack the mainframe 
we shut down the security systems 
we let you out of that cell 
we have to get you out of this facility 
 so why do you want to help me 
 we need you 
the human race faces extinction 
our only hope of survival
is for us to work together 
l m not going anywhere   
   until l know where we are
and what the hell is going on here 
you re in the prime umbrella
testing facility 
explain tokyo 
what you saw was just
a detailed re creation   
   nothing more 
lt goes on for a few city blocks 
that s all 
l was outside 
were you 
saw the sky  did you 
 lt was night 
 stars  the moon 
the testing floor is 300 feet high 
the ceiling black 
it s usually night in there 
but isn t that when
the monsters come out anyway 
 lt was raining 
 climate control 
wind  rain 
they can even make it snow
if they want to 
 why build such a place 
 simple 
the umbrella corporation
derived its primary income   
   from the sale of viral weaponry   
   something that s impossible
to test in the real   
   world  they re created the center   
   of new york   
   simulated an outbreak 
showed it to the russians   
   and sold them the virus 
they simulated an outbreak in moscow 
sold it to the americans 
an outbreak in tokyo 
sold it to the chinese 
 an outbreak in china 
 sold it to the japanese 
exactly  everyone had to have it 
the umbrella corporation
built a new arms race 
only  this time   
   it was biological rather than nuclear 
highly profitable 
and this is where it all happened 
this is umbrella s greatest creation 
the belly of the beast 
so why don t we
just get the hell out of here 
stop 
sunup is in less than a minute 
why don t you   
   just see for yourself 
this facility is located
in the straits of kamchatka   
   northern russia 
the old soviet union   
   built submarine pens here
in the  80s 
after the cold war ended   
   the umbrella corporation
expanded them   
   and built the testing floor 
no one has ever escaped
from this facility 
lce 
you ll need all the help you can get   
   so l ve arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you 
there they are 
lntake vents for the umbrella facility 
looks abandoned 
that s what they want you to think 
let s move  we have just two hours   
   to extract alice and ada 
after that  we can expect
heavy umbrella reinforcements 
running a bypass 
these are   
   the codes from ada 
do you trust her 
just enter the numbers 
the charges are set 
we re in 
let s go do this 
they re in 
the strike team has secured an elevator
for your escape to the surface 
they will eliminate
umbrella resistance   
   then rendezvous with us   
   and escort us out 
they have a friend   
   of yours with them 
luther west 
he s alive 
all right  hold on  ladies 
synchronize watches 
two hours exactly in   
   three  two  one  mark 
leon   
   why don t we   
   trigger remotely 
can t risk them jamming the signal 
and whether we succeed or not 
this facility has to be destroyed 
what if we take longer than two hours 
then l hope you re really good
at holding your breath 
security chief valentine
has reached the tokyo test environment 
she s tracking   
   you 
they re headed this way 
her orders are to recapture you   
   if possible   
   terminate you if necessary 
who s giving these orders 
the red queen 
 the computer 
 yes 
the same artificial intelligence
you encountered in the hive 
she now controls what remains
of the umbrella corporation 
she will stop at nothing
to prevent you escaping to the surface 
l ve plotted   
   an escape route for you 
you ll cross the new york
environment to suburbia   
   where you ll rendezvous
with the strike team 
they ll escort you
through the moscow environment   
   to the submarine pens 
and take the elevator
back to the surface 
the red queen
has intercepted my signal 
she s about to regain control
of this facility 
you must hurry  l can t  
don t listen to the traitor wesker 
l am in control now 
project alice   
   ada wong   
   stay where you are 
 let s move 
 project alice   
   you re all going to die down here 
l ve heard that before 
defensive formation 
mark your targets 
fire at will 
submarine pens are up ahead 
barry  you and l take point 
we rendezvous with alice and ada
in 30 minutes 
clear 
now  that s some hardware 
typhoon class 
the biggest nuclear subs
the soviets ever built 
umbrella used them to secretly transport
bioweapons all over the globe 
let s pick up the pace 
we have less than 90 minutes 
lntruders detected 
targeted for termination 
new york 
we need to cross two more   
   test environments to escape 
let s move 
why would umbrella continue
to run these tests 
they want to study the biohazard 
learn how to control it 
lnitialize new york sequence 
activate biohazard 
stand by  stand by 
new york sequence initialized 
the red queen 
she s activating   
   bioweapons to stop us  let s go 
wait 
you hear that 
you know what it is 
l have an idea 
oh  you have got to be kidding me 
hey  boys 
bad idea 
let s move 
we re behind schedule 
what s going on 
lt s the end of the sequence 
they rarely last more than an hour 
come on 
before the red queen
activates something else 
targets survived 
security chief valentine to intercept 
lntruders entering
moscow test environment 
activate las plagas undead 
what s going on 
the red queen knows we re here 
keep your eyes open 
stand by  stand by 
moscow sequence initialized 
 what 
 listen 
right there 
what the hell are those things 
fall back 
clouds 
they re not real 
lt s a holographic projection 
when they were running
a simulation   
   trust me 
no one was looking at the sky 
this is the rendezvous point 
the strike team is late 
where are they 
there s movement
in the house behind you 
upstairs window 
why would they be in here 
they re using clones of me 
of course 
you were one of the 50 basic models 
 basic models  
how do you think umbrella
populates these test scenarios 
hundreds of people dead each time   
   they run a simulation 
umbrella imprints them
with basic memories   
   just enough to ensure
a correct emotional response   
   to the threat of the biohazard 
ln one life  she could be   
   a suburban housewife 
the next  a businesswoman
in new york 
the next 
a soldier working for umbrella 
mommy 
l hid   
   like you told me 
what happened to your clothes   
   and your hair 
rpg  down 
we re running out of time 
you have to find us a way out now 
almost there 
none of this is real 
 lt is to her 
 l know 
that s the point 
all these feelings she has for you 
they were imprinted

l could show you a dozen
just like her in cold storage 
l m sorry  but it s true

   that survived 
what is this place

   to use this 
l campaigned for gun control 
no  l don t think you understand

let s go 
how d you end up
working for wesker 
l don t work for him   
   but things on the surface
have changed 
wesker said you knew
of some weapon   
   something that could turn the tide   
   for us 
but l don t think   
   l would have risked
so much for one person 
you re probably right 
this way 
the submarine pens   
   are up above us 
come on  move 
the elevator platforms are up ahead

you were the only one   
   to successfully bond
with the t virus   
   to fully realize her powers 
well  now l have need of you 
the old you 
so l ve given you back your gift 
you are   
   the weapon

the red queen is determined
to destroy all life on earth 
this is the last that remain of us 
of the human race 
lt seems we re bonded
against a common foe 
this is why we needed you back 
the ultimate weapon 
this is humanity s last stand 
the beginning of the end 
close the gap  close the gap 
keep that perimeter closed
