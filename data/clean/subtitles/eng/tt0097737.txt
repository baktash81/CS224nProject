hey thats good stuff
make for a great endofshift party
hey becky if im on report
i guess this bottles mine huh
well i guess youre right
it is yours
but its pilferage so now youre down
for two counts of safety negligence
for risking williamss life
going on that boat and possessing
restricted material
mr cobb all this gets impounded
its done
and one more thing
i think if i hear you call me
becky one more time sixpack
im gonna pop your tops
all six of em
my infirmarys filled
the doctors on board tell me
its like a tropical infection
but its not like anything
ive ever seen before
and theres something else
i dont understand
and then it goes off
ok so what do you want me to say doc
it all sounds mysterious
yea
well why did he leave his log tape
why are there two ships with
the same name in different places
hell i dont know you read russian
maybe you read it wrong
i didnt even if i had there
should be a record of some ship thats
sunk within 100 miles of here
and theres not
and look at this tear
this hole in the hull
thats the result of an explosion
i think that was a torpedo hit
i think that ship
was sunk on purpose
hey doc now how the hell
do you know thats a torpedo hit
i mean a collision with another boat
could produce that hole
i dont agree with you
this hole would not be so jagged
so what
i mean so what if they
scuttle their own boat
i cant get bent outta shape
just because some people
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean
i know about rocks i know about stones doc
i dont know about russian boats
plus which i bet you five dollars
its a clerical error
hell we sounded the horn on it
let the maritime people figure it out
i gotta fix the lift lock
okay two more days
lets have no waves
weather system on line
tracking meteorological patterns
beginning scan
i hate
waves
hey cobb

well im trying to fix
this short in the lift lock
what are you doing down here williams
you know what i mean
yeah i know what you mean
you dont belong in a mine
you got that right
but somebody just got
the brilliant idea
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys
i think maybe they thought that
just cause i could tell
shit from silver
id know how to run this place
well do you
you tell me
i think you handled
dejesus pretty well
yeah
well that was luck
i was scared to death
what about sixpack
what about him
did you bust him because of me
maybe
well i appreciate that
but im okay
yeah i know
good
oh by the way how did you know
theyd get into the vodka

maybe youre more one
of us than you think
good morning
50f
okay thats good
just look at my forehead
thats it
let me see your tongue
good morning gentlemen
whats wrong doc
im getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover
take off your shirt
it aint no hangover
feels about 1000 times worse
how long did you have these spots
what
dont touch it
well as first officer of the shack
its your call
but if i were you
id not be too hasty
i dont get it
any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup
wont look good on
an otherwise excellent record
but like i said its your call
well as bad as he is
theres no way
were gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there
hes tankin on us
no i dont think so
i heard him last night
and he didnt sound so good
the company will take that under
consideration when they look at our numbers
sweetheart the company
doesnt give a damn about why
the contract says
if we miss our quota
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month
believe me theyll stick to it
the bastards
definitely tanking on us
yep i think youre right
i wish you were but hes not
hes really sick
he aint comin out today
williams take her down
thats terrific
three months of work down the tubes
youre outta here guys
so what are you taking inventory
no mr jones
im getting ready to play pingpong
im goin to work mr jones
you got a problem with that
work
work
try to hold as steady as you can
what the hell is it doc
im taking a little skin sample
come on give me something
just a second
steady as you can
try to do it as quick as i can
thats it i got it
steady steady steady
easy easy
its all right
keep your hands off it
here hold that
im gonna take a look at this
under the microscope
container 22 is full sir
okay this ones full up so lets run her
outta here and bring in a new one
you got it
an organism of unknown origin
no kidding
tell me something i dont know
goddamn it take a guess
good work out there becky
i mean mr beck
not bad mr beck
no harm done
just dont call me cracker
perk up sport
how can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours
put this on
i want you to examine him
im not a doctor
for this you dont need to be
oh lord
am i wearing this cause
you think it might be contagious
i dont know if it is
i dont know if it isnt
i dont know a damn thing
neither does anyone else
ive been going back and forth
with narragansett naval all day
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine
the best people in virology
they dont even believe
the symptoms im describing
their best guess and thats
all it is is just a guess
is that before sixpack died
he was undergoing
some form of genetic alteration
genetic alteration from what
it could be a million things
something in the food the air
sixpack went in that ship
and so did williams
i want to examine
the rest of the crew
but i dont want to create a panic
so until i get some answers
i dont think we should tell them
that sixpack is dead
skin condition herpes measles
what is it
its a little difficult
to describe
christ it would be
a hell of a thing
if i went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing
my wife would never
understand that at all
i dont think we have
to worry about that do we
she wouldnt understand that at all
shed think i was down here
screwing my head off or something
put on your shirt
its all right
yeah youre fine
this whole thing is unnecessary doc
the only skin problem
i can see is white people
how come youre wearin those gloves
it aint bendover time is it
anything wrong
no i just wanted to see something
thats all
you think it has anything to do
with going on that ship
well its a possibility
but if that was the case
youd be showing some symptoms
wouldnt you
im okay
youre fine
no really youre fine
great thanks doc
what do you mean a skin problem
your skin changes
yeah it blackens it gets scaly
what like a fish
yeah like a fish
i was just joking doc
you can finish getting dressed now
oh bowman im sorry
ill be right back
generic alteration
genetic
whatever but you think its
restricted to this one crew member
well so far but
but what
what if it turns out
to be nothing
what are you talking about
its already killed one man
but you have no proof that
this disease is contagious do you
and weve been wrong before
havent we dr thompson
look martin i think
youre missing the point here
my crews in jeopardy
ive seen this disease
and its no day at the beach
so by way of paragraph 539
of the manual
im ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation
of all the personnel
on the shack
its your call
but unfortunately
we cant pick you up so soon
theres a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of cuba
possibly coming your way
and if it does the company does not
want to risk losing you folks
what are you saying
are you saying youre not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time
it shouldnt be a long delay
well whats a long delay
a day a week what
twelve hours we should know something
first thing in the morning
ill keep you posted
you better be there
twelve hours
twelve hours

theres something about it its
bigger
well somebodys been screwing around
just take a look at that hand
look at the size of it
if you were tampering with genetics
why stop with the base model
why not try to alter the human form
homo aquaticus a man who could live
underwater think of the possibilities
regeneration
the ability to withstand
extreme cold pressure
just think of it
undersea mining underwater farming
so whats next i mean what if
we run outta airplanes one day
what are we gonna do
just grow a whole bunch of bird people
natura no confundendo est
loosely translated
dont fuck with mother nature
i better let the company know
have you ever thought
that they may suspect already
yeah i thought about that doc
but i also like to think they got some
kind of commitment to their people
you can save that speech
for your ad campaign
this companys commitment is
to the almighty dollar
if you think based on what
weve told them that trioceanic
is gonna risk exposing themself to
potential market loss just to save us
youre in for an
eyeopening experience
maybe
maybe so and i know your lifes
gone a couple of bad rounds doc
but it doesnt necessarily mean
this whole companys one big bummer
i think we got something here
son of a bitch
i dont get it
why did they put it in the vodka
it was an experiment man
i mean they put the drug or
whatever it was in the vodka
they meant to trick
them into takin it
that way see they didnt know
what they were drinkin
i mean with us they would have
put it in the coffee
what are you talkin about
come on man
you know how mothers put the
castor oil in with orange juice

a goddamn dracula in here with us
thats why that one on the ship
was dead it needed blood
what one on that ship
somebody want to let the
rankandfile in on your little secret
whatever it is
it appears to be a genetic aberration
no shit
whatre you trying to tell us doc
it has all the characteristics of
deepsea marine life scales gills
regeneration even a period of dormancy
but the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored
seems to imply that is has
some other quality
what
it absorbs the intelligence of its victim
intelligence may not be the right word
the hell with semantics doc
what are you saying now
this thing is part dejesus
part sixpack part bowman what
i dont know
id just be guessing
but i do know this
the russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves
maybe to protect us all
alright then i say we protect ourselves
lets escape into those air bubbles
and get the hell out of here
and hit the surface in
the middle of a hurricane
man that stormd rip
those bubbles to pieces
theyd never find us
