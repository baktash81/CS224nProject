  it s the captain s log on videotape 
  don t tell me you read russian 
russian  german  italian  spanish 
french  a little swahili
and a smattering of hindi 
  it s part of my premed background 
  bullshit 
would you believe
a russian grandmother

hey  that s good stuff 
make for a great end of shift party 
hey  becky  if i m on report 
i guess this bottle s mine  huh 
well  i guess you re right 
it is yours 
but it s pilferage  so now you re down
for two counts of safety negligence
for risking williams s life 
going on that boat and possessing
restricted material 
  mr  cobb  all this gets impounded 
  it s done 
and one more thing 
i think if i hear you call me
 becky  one more time  sixpack 
i m gonna pop your tops   
all six of  em 
my infirmary s filled 
the doctors on board tell me
it s like a tropical infection 
but it s not like anything
i ve ever seen before 
and there s something else
i don t understand 
and then it goes off 
ok  so what do you want me to say  doc 
it all sounds mysterious 
yea 
well  why did he leave his log tape 
why are there two ships with
the same name in different places 
hell  i don t know  you read russian 
maybe you read it wrong 
i didn t  even if i had  there
should be a record of some ship that s
sunk within 100 miles of here 
and there s not 
and look at this tear 
this hole in the hull 
that s the result of an explosion 
i think that was a torpedo hit 
i think that ship
was sunk on purpose 
hey doc  now how the hell
do you know that s a torpedo hit 
i mean  a collision with another boat
could produce that hole 
i don t agree with you 
  this hole would not be so jagged   
  so what 
i mean  so what if they
scuttle their own boat 
i can t get bent outta shape
just because some people
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean 
i know about rocks  i know about stones  doc 
i don t know about russian boats 
plus which  i bet you five dollars
it s a clerical error 
hell  we sounded the horn on it 
let the maritime people figure it out 
i gotta fix the lift lock

  yeah  i know what you mean 
  you don t belong in a mine 
  you got that right 
but somebody just got
the brilliant idea
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys 
i think maybe they thought that
just  cause i could tell
shit from silver 
i d know how to run this place 
well  do you 
you tell me 
i think you handled
dejesus pretty well 
yeah 
well  that was luck

good morning  gentlemen 
what s wrong  doc 
i m getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover 
  take off your shirt 
  it ain t no hangover 
feels about 1000 times worse 
how long did you have these spots 
  what 
  don t touch it 
well  as first officer of the shack 
it s your call 
but if i were you 
i d not be too hasty 
i don t get it 
any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup
won t look good on
an otherwise excellent record 
but like i said  it s your call 
well  as bad as he is 
there s no way
we re gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there 
  he s tankin  on us 
  no  i don t think so 
i heard him last night 
and he didn t sound so good 
the company will take that under
consideration when they look at our numbers 
sweetheart  the company
doesn t give a damn about why 
the contract says 
if we miss our quota
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month 
believe me  they ll stick to it 
the bastard s
definitely tanking on us 
  yep  i think you re right 
  i wish you were  but he s not 
he s really sick 
he ain t comin  out today 
  williams  take her down 
  that s terrific 
  three months of work down the tubes 
  you re outta here  guys 
so  what  are you taking inventory 
no  mr  jones 
i m getting ready to play ping pong 
i m goin  to work  mr  jones 
you got a problem with that 
  work 
  work 
  try to hold as steady as you can 
  what the hell is it  doc 
  i m taking a little skin sample 
  come on  give me something 
just a second 
steady as you can 
try to do it as quick as i can 
that s it  i got it 
steady  steady  steady 
easy  easy 
it s all right 
keep your hands off it 
here  hold that 
i m gonna take a look at this
under the microscope 
container 22 is full  sir 
okay  this one s full up  so let s run her
outta here and bring in a new one 
you got it 
 an organism of unknown origin  
no kidding 
tell me something i don t know 
goddamn it  take a guess 
good work out there  becky 
i mean  mr  beck 
not bad  mr  beck 
no harm done 
just don t call me cracker 
perk up  sport 
how can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours 
put this on 
i want you to examine him 
  i m not a doctor 
  for this  you don t need to be 
oh  lord 
am i wearing this  cause
you think it might be contagious 
i don t know if it is 
i don t know if it isn t 
i don t know a damn thing 
neither does anyone else 
i ve been going back and forth
with narragansett naval all day 
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine   
the best people in virology 
they don t even believe
the symptoms i m describing 
their best guess  and that s
all it is is just a guess   
is that before sixpack died 
he was undergoing
some form of genetic alteration 
genetic alteration from what 
it could be a million things 
something in the food  the air 
sixpack went in that ship 
and so did williams 
i want to examine
the rest of the crew 
but i don t want to create a panic 
so until i get some answers
i don t think we should tell them
that sixpack is dead 
skin condition  herpes  measles 
what is it 
it s a little difficult
to describe 
christ  it would be
a hell of a thing
if i went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing 
my wife would never
understand that at all 
i don t think we have
to worry about that  do we 
she wouldn t understand that at all 
she d think i was down here
screwing my head off or something 
put on your shirt 
  it s all right 
  yeah  you re fine 
this whole thing is unnecessary  doc 
the only skin problem
i can see is white people 
how come you re wearin  those gloves 
it ain t bend over time  is it 
  anything wrong 
  no  i just wanted to see something 
that s all 
you think it has anything to do
with going on that ship 
well  it s a possibility 
but if that was the case
you d be showing some symptoms 
wouldn t you 
  i m okay 
  you re fine 
no  really  you re fine 
great  thanks  doc 
what do you mean  a skin problem 
your skin changes 
  yeah  it blackens  it gets scaly 
  what  like a fish 
  yeah  like a fish 
  i was just joking  doc 
you can finish getting dressed now 
oh  bowman  i m sorry 
i ll be right back 
  generic alteration 
  genetic 
whatever  but you think it s
restricted to this one crew member 
  well  so far  but   
  but what 
what if it turns out
to be nothing 
what are you talking about 
it s already killed one man 
but you have no proof that
this disease is contagious  do you 
and we ve been wrong before 
haven t we  dr  thompson 
look  martin  i think
you re missing the point here 
my crew s in jeopardy 
i ve seen this disease 
and it s no day at the beach 
so by way of paragraph 539
of the manual
i m ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation
of all the personnel
on the shack 
it s your call 
but unfortunately
we can t pick you up so soon 
there s a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of cuba
possibly coming your way 
and if it does  the company does not
want to risk losing you folks 
what are you saying 
are you saying you re not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time 
it shouldn t be a long delay 
well  what s a long delay 
a day  a week  what 
twelve hours  we should know something
first thing in the morning 
  i ll keep you posted 
  you better be there 
  twelve hours 
  twelve hours 
i promise 
bow  bow  are you okay 
oh  my god  come on 
can you help us here 
  let s put her here 
  come on  take it easy 
it s all right 
you re gonna be all right  okay 
i m gonna go find doc  all right 
hey  doc 
maybe he s with sixpack

some kind of sick bay or lab
or something  hold it  run it back 
that s it  stop  now move in 
see  it looks like a human skull 
but i don t know 
  there s something about it  it s   
  bigger 
well  somebody s been screwing around 
just take a look at that hand 
  look at the size of it 
  if you were tampering with genetics   
why stop with the base model 
why not try to alter the human form 
homo aquaticus  a man who could live
underwater  think of the possibilities 
regeneration 
the ability to withstand
extreme cold  pressure 
just think of it 
undersea mining  underwater farming 
so what s next  i mean  what if
we run outta airplanes one day 
what are we gonna do 
just grow a whole bunch of bird people 
natura no confundendo est 
loosely translated 
 don t fuck with mother nature  
i better let the company know 
have you ever thought
that they may suspect already 
yeah  i thought about that  doc 
but i also like to think they got some
kind of commitment to their people 
you can save that speech
for your ad campaign 
this company s commitment is
to the almighty dollar 
if you think  based on what
we ve told them  that tri oceanic
is gonna risk exposing themself to
potential market loss just to save us
you re in for an
eye opening experience 
maybe 
maybe so  and i know your life s
gone a couple of bad rounds  doc 
but it doesn t necessarily mean
this whole company s one big bummer 
i think we got something here 
son of a bitch 
i don t get it 
why did they put it in the vodka 
it was an experiment  man 
i mean  they put the drug or
whatever it was in the vodka 
they meant to trick
them into takin  it 
that way  see  they didn t know
what they were drinkin  
i mean  with us  they would have
put it in the coffee 
  what are you talkin  about 
  come on  man 
you know how mothers put the
castor oil in with orange juice 
they trick the baby into drinkin  it
so he don t know what he s drinkin 
that s the kind of shit
they was doin   man 
fool  he could ve got us all killed 
you guys weren t so holy when
you were shooting that vodka 
it could ve been anyone 
well  miss high and mighty 
it doesn t seem to bother you none 
yeah  it bothers me 
you deal with it your way 
i ll deal with it mine 
you know that in gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes 
sixty four square miles 
how can you sit there goin    shh  shh

dejesus 
cobb

dejesus  hey 
doc 
oh  my god 
the blood supply 
oh  my god 
it got the blood supply 
it s growing  it s had a meal 
  it needs blood 
  apparently 
this is great  you re tellin  me we got
a goddamn dracula in here with us 
that s why that one on the ship
was dead  it needed blood 
what one on that ship 
somebody want to let the
rank and file in on your little secret 
whatever it is 
it appears to be a genetic aberration 
  no shit 
  what re you trying to tell us  doc 
it has all the characteristics of
deep sea marine life  scales  gills   
regeneration  even a period of dormancy 
but the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored
seems to imply that is has
some other quality 
  what 
  it absorbs the intelligence of its victim 
intelligence may not be the right word 
the hell with semantics  doc 
what are you saying  now 
this thing is part dejesus 
part sixpack  part bowman  what 
i don t know 
i d just be guessing 
but i do know this 
the russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves 
maybe to protect us all 
alright  then i say we protect ourselves 
let s escape into those air bubbles
and get the hell out of here 
and hit the surface in
the middle of a hurricane 
man  that storm d rip
those bubbles to pieces 
  they d never find us 
  we wouldn t stand a snowball s chance in hell 
  so what are we gonna do 
  look  i think we got one shot 
just one shot  we lure it down into the
swamp  flush it out just like the other 
and how re we gonna do that 
so we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes 
mr  cobb  synchronize 30 minutes 
  mark  got it 
  got it 
okay  so i ll run this by you again 
if jones and i aren t back here
in 30 minutes in the mess 
hurricane or nothin   you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass 
  okay 
  okay 
  let s do it 
  be careful with this 
  don t worry  i don t want to give up any more 
  take care 
i ll do my best 
okay  let s go 
you know  i was quite good once 
when i did something 
it was important  you know 
i developed drugs and techniques
that re used every day by
doctors all over the world 
  made a difference 
  it still does  doc 
this itches like hell 
  i m all right
