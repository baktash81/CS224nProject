travel plans into reverse
hey they like us
theyre not gonna
hey look
i dont want to press it
they didnt seem to care in the least
about that phenomenon with your arm
oh i got that figured
its when you mix a
particular place not here
but on the outside thats
when the power hits you
the power
yeah its sort of built in
its like telepathy
telepathy
no no no no
it is like telepathy
what are you talking about
come on come on
im gonna show you
hows it going
oh pretty good curt

melvin barking
so watch what you say
if i cant ask about
what can i ask about
laughing
anything you want

we got no secrets here have we
i think youll find just the
opposite if you come with us
come where
not far
where the valleys rise to the sun
okay
laughing
suspenseful music
youll not be going there
not yet
laughing
ill make some arrangements
get you an invitation up to the house
invitation
it may take a while may not
laughing
do they think were
crazy enough to eat this
its probably all right
the other tray
doc hello
who are you
id like to ask the same thing
were about as startled as you are
how did you get here
we were ballooning
we were trying to break
a long distance record
we came here
no
dont say where
shh
you never say where
curtis yeah we know about that
it took us a while but we found out
my name is jayson
im clay jayson
would you like some
i come from
it doesnt matter where i come from
how long have you been here
how long
yeah
have i been here
how long
uh how long
um
uh 17
this is the 17th year
17th year
i was a captain on a schooner
there was a storm
the biggest storm i ever saw
with huge waves and flung
everybody overboard
and i clung
i clung to a reef
theyre all gone
all the others theyre all gone
youve been alone here for 17 years
wood clatters
theyre all gone
and in the deafening roar
in monstrous surf i saw lenore
my wife lenore
mr poe
mr edgar allen poe had me in mind
do you believe that
doc why are you in this cell
what have you done
what have i done
what did i do
here ill show you
look
no
no
its too hideous
i have given red corpuscles
enough to fill a frigate
and they they keep me alive
so the supply will never drop off
do you understand
youre a
youre a donor
thats a good one
donor yes
its something like that
i dont know who were gonna run into
or how many theyre gonna be
but i dont want to end up in a cell
do you know where i can find a
gun or where i can steal one
door opening
tense music
while many demon ghosts go by
i pray my dead lenore shall lie
forever with unopened eye
this man must be
sedated from time to time
hes dangerous
he didnt seem that way to me
when youve been around
here as long as i have
you can start giving out opinions
dont concern yourself with him
our request for your
invitation has been granted
my best brandy
the oldest in stock
im sheila frankenstein
how do you do
actually its von helsing
i dont prefer my married name
im dr hadley
this is curt ryan and dino markie
keep this away from jocko
he wouldnt appreciate it
jocko wont seek the brandy
not when theres rum around
doc thats quite a
famous name you have
oh it has my deepest reverence
is there any relationship
between you and um
oh yes
dr frankenstein my
greatgreat grandfather
he originated everything on the island
including that power
which paralyzes the arm
frankenstein set many forces in action
and in doing so created his own law
he still enforces it by
channeling through my husband
your husband
please understand that
everything is open here
theres nothing i wish
in any way to be hidden
so ill be boldly specific
my husband was an integral part
of the frankenstein experiments
in the early days the two
of them traveled far beyond
mans understanding of life and death
so very far that an unbreakable bond
was formed between them
it endures today with one
dead and the other alive
through their communication
dr frankenstein still
controls this island
hes pretty happy about you fellows
even though hes dead
being deads no problem
its just the opposite
what do you think was pulling
you here your own free will
hey remember my mentioning to you
when the balloon was twisting
the wind was bringing
on a different effect
it seemed like we were
caught in some kind of power
laughing
its true
your arrival is an omen
yes an omen
the girls like you and that
demands your helping them
you want us to help the girls
perhaps some of you can
serve to impregnate them
in order to ensure future generations
laughing
we have accommodations
facilities a social life
and you fellas have
stepped right inside of it
yes well
i think we better get back on the track
of finding some kind of transportation
i dont mean to seem ungrateful
but wed better get on
with what we have to do
im afraid that any
such action is entirely
in the hands of my husband
mark where is he
youll see him
our guests will need a good nights sleep
unlock the rooms by the lab
yes of course
tense music
aside
aside
your presence doesnt bother this one
hes balanced quite well
theyre all programmed
to be perfect guards
but some are unpredictable
whats happened to them
theyve gone through
some elaborate changes
caused by what
the quest of science
if theyre unpredictable
couldnt that lead to violence
sometimes beyond tolerance
in such cases a gun is useless
because they have no bloodstream
they have to be literally cut
in half with a machine gun
they do fine except for the eyes
theyve been using a local narcotic
which causes optic problems
theyve become severely
sensitive to light
doc this is marvelous
try it
youll be in for a surprise
i cant believe the
reading on this meter
our best researchers havent dreamt
of anything even close to this
howd you work it out
well i didnt
this island was originally chosen
not simply because of its barrier bluffs
but because it was once a landing site
for men and women of a
superior civilization
machine beeping
nice little item
a brain
are you saying that aliens
landed here some time ago
yeah aliens
that explains it about the girls
the girls are direct descendants
although their blood is mixed
with that of our own people
curtis and some are more
on one side than the other
my husband has been bed
ridden for a long time
this is my husband dr von helsing
the assistant to frankenstein
machine beeping
tone pulsing
electricity zapping
i have the power
the power of the golden thread
let the devils move
rhythmic drumming
o disciple of the 12 lions
ye shall have the power
the power shall be yours
the power
the power
the power
the power
tone pulsing
look at that
holy cow
theyre the most beautiful
vegetables ive ever seen
well part of its in the original soil
but mostly its due to
the nutrient compounds
laughing
wow
growth is so rapid we
have to filter the sun
really
wow
oh well
ill let you show yourselves around now
im due at the lab
ill be integrating
some unusual blood types
if you care to observe
oh yes
id like to very much
i think perhaps later
on if its all right
well if you like
sports theyre over there
oh sports
laughing
up sport
come on mate
we go to the sport
growling
laughing
hold it mates
hold it
laughing
hey listen
laughing
gotta do it real slow and
steady to keep em embalmed
laughing
hey jocko
howd you lose the eye
howd i lose me eye
yeah
howd you lose your eye
how did i lose me eye
this is all they left of it neighbor
get out of me way mate
dramatic music
growling
grunting
jocko laughs
mark hey jayson
oh guy devere hast thou no tear
weep now when evermore
see on yon drear and rigid beer
lo lies my love
lenore
jayson
how do you feel jayson
oh yes
let the burial rights be read
a funeral song be sung
a dirge for her
the doubly dead
in that she died so young so young
mark hey jayson
jayson
so young
mark hey jayson
dont you remember us
we wanna help you
jayson do you feel numbness anywhere
in that she died so young
look i think the best bet
is to find out what the drug is
if shell tell me that
i might be able to find
what i need in the lab
yeah
we better start building that raft
hey melvin
been behaving yourself
he been giving you much trouble
not at all
i really appreciate you
i mean youve really been a big help
i love him
well
mark dino were gonna
check out the cave openings
you check out the beach okay
can you put melvin inside for a while
sure
you can come down to the ocean with me
help me collect some driftwood
machine beeping
its good
good
exceptionally strong
i dont dare hope that
it will remain that way
dr frankenstein is considering
a new plan ive worked up
were most optimistic about it
you know when i hear
you casually mention
communicating with dr frankenstein
communicating with a dead man
i dont know quite how to take it
its not quite so
bizarre as you might think
its fact
but my husbands the one who communicates
i can get through only rarely
i could in this case
because this particular plan
has great bearing on our future
it promises that my husband
will be out of this bed permanently
when you learn of the incredible
capabilities of the mind
you will realize how many
things fall within it
like the power thats
used to control the one
who attacks those girls out there
they can only produce inferior offspring
so a power source has been set up
which in time weakens him
and the others you have seen the guards
they have no bloodstream
because they need none
they live on psychic energy
dr frankenstein and i
learned of these things
early in our research
you keep referring to
work with dr frankenstein
but in the framework of time
how can that possibly be
good god man
didnt she tell you
im almost 200 years old
we know we stopped
your work and everything
and like we really do appreciate it
all right girls
now heres what we want you to do
i want you to go down to the
woods and find some logs
some straight logs
you get em and you bring em back here
now i want to examine them
before we go down to the beach
oh and i want a few of you
to start weaving some rope
use the kind that supports
the roof of that hut
that should be good
enough dont you think
yeah
see none of us have
ever made a raft before
oh come on curt
i wouldnt worry about that
this raft is gonna be seaworthy
and good and strong like any ship
tense music
doc there hold that point
part of its holding but
the oscillator is slow
machine beeping
its steady at 1800 volts
it should peak at about 40000
those carriers are
pretty close together
they could be acting as a transformer
yes of corse
of course it could be
coughing
doc what is it
just the usual
im afraid continual life has
its continual ups and downs
his pulse has weakened considerably
hell have to go back into trance
for at least three hours
couldnt that be dangerous
with the voltage unsteady
only the peak is fluctuating
indeed i need them quite badly
theres something else in all this
something much more important
than anything youve seen so far
dr frankenstein sends
power from the other realm
power
one that can accomplish great things
dr frankenstein before he died
perfected a very startling theory
which utilizes an
intermediary a human brain
which is a connecting
link for transmission
the brain is kept alive by low voltage
it stays on an expanded threshold
a supernourished state
how can any of us forget
the great contribution he made
by creating a human life
even though it was a monster
yes
whatever happened to that creation
in the years
throughout the years the mind
of the monster never developed
though his strength never ceased
the strength paralleled
his great urge to destroy
we had to chain him to
the reef underwater
beneath the grotto
suspenseful music
hey you know what id like to do
grab all the air i can
and dive under the rock
to where
the ocean
the waters salty
thats where its from
boy i wish i had some scuba gear
when we pass this spot
we keep right on going
yeah
whys that
i cant say
its
i cant say
laughs you know thats
what i like about you
you never keep any secrets
hey
that looks like a form down there
a human
wow there goes my imagination
o disciple of the golden thread
the power ye seek shall be given
it shall be given
the power
the power
the power
the power
tense music
tone pulsing
electricity zapping
o celeste of the heavens
o horse within the light
i call for decrees in the
tradition we perpetuated
tone warbling
looks like he cant move a muscle
mark hey jayson
jayson listen to me
come on jayson
open your eyes
we want to help you but
youve got to help us
come on jayson
he was better before
tones pulsing
its not necessary to eavesdrop
oh you surprised us
i would expect i had
thatll do
were just looking for doc
we thought maybe
follow me
electricity zapping
machine beeping
is he all right
yeah fine
the rafts almost finished
doc hmm
the raft
by tonight itll be
loaded and ready to go
wait a minute
you know jayson feels bad
looks bad
did you find anything to help him with
to what
jayson to help him
gasps
if this were dropped
wed lose much more
than you could imagine
oh im sorry
must your friends be here
at this particular time
i think theyre taking advantage
yes
yes youre right
now look mark
it would be better if you wait outside
what i mean is wait until tomorrow
were in the middle here of
something very important
other things are important too
look im talking about life
do you here me
life
we may be on the verge of discovering
the very factor that animates it
have you any idea what that means
no you wouldnt
youd never understand
oh i wouldnt huh
mark come back tomorrow
please
sure
bring her over here
shes the daughter of a strong woman
with a parallel link to pure alien
with her blood available
i dont know why you didnt
do this a long time ago
well transfusing animal
blood with that of a human
never seemed promising
in light of my husbands changes
the possibility was
never really considered
go get the animals
mark hello
lets take a rest
spread out
whats the matter something wrong
leone is missing
oh
we found the tracks and one
set go deep into the ground
oh
im sorry myra
lets just follow the tracks
why sure
its no use
wait a minute we can help
the three of us can
theres nothing that can be done
not now
two sets of tracks means he wont weaken
the way he does when hes alone
that happens when they want
one of us for an experiment
oh
hey wait a minute
ill tell you what well do
tonight when it gets dark
well go back there
together all of us okay
crying
this kind of thing happen very often
sometimes
well youve gotta set
up some kind of protection
you know like deep pits in
the ground covered with grass
yes but
subdued music
come on
maybe well be able to bring her back
we wont
there
now youve been adopted into the tribe
girl he was a long time ago
adopted
im going to miss him
hes gonna miss you
hes gonna miss you very much
laughing
did you touch
touch the bottle
i hardly have time but well
yells
mate mate

by the way dont lag behind
on that embalming powder
twice an hour she said
until the autopsy
embalming powder
yeah
yes
all right
i can mate
laughing
make room for the bottle
laughing
i dont know how many
more of these they want
but im not gonna chase any
more like i did this one
oh laddy
youre just sorry
because this is a bummer
you wanted him for sunday dinner
laughing
machine beeping
wish we couldve saved her
hows the pulse
strong
lets increase the voltage
no no no
i think its high enough
what do you think
uh no
no more
no more animals will be needed
ill let you know if theres a change
take this girls body out
his eyes are fluttering
break out the secondary coil
tone pulsing
good
all right
ease the primary back between 18 and 20
slowly
very slowly
good good
is it at 18
22
okay full power
all of it
tense music
thats enough
easy now
relax
try some water
sighs
there
how do you feel
strong
very much so
doc good
weve done it
i think weve really done it
done what
found a blood supply thatll hold
if it sustains the way i think
it will itll be permanent
why youve never balanced
as quickly as this
what may i ask did you transfuse
we funneled fresh
hematitis by one quarter pint
for every full one received
from one of your alien girls
animal blood
are you saying that you
gave me animal blood
with a slow entry rate
the body itself homogenizes the two types
whose idea was this
well mine
i thought that
you thought
if youd really thought you
would have looked in my journals
and found out that we
had tried this concept
before you were born
it almost ended me
doc well drain it immediately
ill need type a
that means the captain jayson
youll have to start
the transfusion slowly
dont rush
but gradually pick up
time as you progress
the 12 rang
the golden thread
ye shall have its power
its power
its power
its power
i know where the four winds blow
and the good always goes
but when the ship sinks
theres no place to go
laughs
what
o disciples the power awaits you
ye will have all that ye wish
all that ye wish
i give the power of the thread
tense music
screaming
get down
i couldnt see in the lab
but i heard them talking
theyve got jayson there all right
theyre taking his blood
down
thats the fourth one ive seen tonight
dont they cut down on the night shift
cut down is right and
im gonna do the cutting
come again
machine guns
remember what she said
the only to handle these
guys is with machine guns
yeah
cut em right down the middle
got a couple on ya
she wouldnt have mentioned it
if there wasnt at least one
of them around here somewhere
now my guess is theres one in that house
do you know what a machine gun looks like
um i think so
oh
theyre about this long you know
they shoot bullets
come on
suspenseful music
here
its a machine gun all right
looks like out of civil war
good
just so it works
yeah
dramatic music
screams
dino
screams
ill need more blood
easy
i can
slowly now
take it easy
what are you doing
i didnt call for anyone else
take her away
no wait
shell do for the second transfusion
girl no
no
jayson you are
you are i know it
oh my god
my god
what
oh god
oh god
youre the perfect image of my wife
of my dear my poor lenore
youre the absolute image of her
she was killed 17 years ago
when the ship hit the reef
and you were cushioned in my arms
me
cushioned in my arms
when you were three
only three
dont you remember
me
who sang to you
i sang to you
who told you the story of the seas
of the continents of the
world the story of noah
dont you remember

machine gun firing
get him by the wall
to the side
hurry up
all right everybody
lets get ourselves relaxed and friendly
and well have no problems
doc theyre gonna crash
that door any minute
get over here with us
i think youve lost your mind
better stop this nonsense
before you ruin everything
oh ive lost my mind huh
you know doc
i always knew you were a comic
dino check out the old man
dino
please
if he doesnt have blood hell die
well whose blood would you like
would you like dinos
how about mine
this man worked with dr frankenstein
hes the link that can
look well take just one
pint from each of them
hes a great man
save him for science
you may not know it doc
but thats exactly what
im trying to do for you
that doors gonna go
banging on door
what chance do you
really think you have
against them
ive cut five of em to pieces
and im just waiting for the rest
for what its worth we
bolted your outside door
those guys are too dumb
to come in the window
look mark
youre doing what i expect you
to and i know you mean well
but this is something
out of your experience
if you had any idea about
the science were after
what theyre really doing
youd see the mistake in your thinking
be careful
dont bump it
mark its value is more
than you can imagine
look what do you think
maybe its the brain we should destroy
electricity zapping
i hear thee
one so close i hear
though as i hear be reassured
my response is forthcoming
o celeste of the heavens
o horse within the light
i call for a decree in the
tradition we perpetuated
grant upon this night the
created one becomes full
that he be free
grant that he be free
and behest the name of
frankenstein to endure
tense music
upon the name of the golden
thread ye shall have strength
strength
strength upon the name
of the golden thread
ye shall have strength
ye shall have strength
ominous music
dramatic music
mark i want you to listen to me
weve been friends a long time
now you owe something to that friendship
no doc
if you were yourself
you wouldnt be asking me
to do anything different
theyve been feeding you
dope ever since you got here
youre psyched out doc
and you dont know it
please im begging you
dont do this
madam im doing nothing
and i might add so are
you and your husband
ill release your friend
dramatic music
growling
electricity zapping
laughing
tense music
thunder crashing
melvin whimpers
laughing
thunder crashes
hes all right now
how do you feel doc
like ive been asleep
laughs
weve lost far too much time
get the girl ready for the transfusion
whoa i didnt promise
anything about that
you certainly implied it
you indicated that if my husband
would cooperate youd see
wait a minute
wait wait
im the correct blood type
ill donate two pints
door clatters
dramatic music
its jammed
grunting
gasping
melvin barking
growling
glass shatters
tone pulses
shelf clattering
the brain its going to be destroyed
dont worry
if the brain is damaged
another one will activate in seconds
the power will start again
a backup brain was hidden
years ago just in case
nows your chance to go
go
take the raft and go
now you have a chance
but only for a minute
what are you talking about
i overheard them discussing it
when the brain was
damaged the power stopped
but theres another
brain hidden somewhere
itll activate any minute and
theyll all be strong again
shes right
we could bring back help
dino come on
were getting out
he cant move
its impossible
hes barely alive
dino then you come
i cant
hes my father
doc dino come on
weve gotta go
dino come on
dino well come back for ya
well come back for ya
the thing just got
more and more fantastic
as the situations were developing
you see at first i thought
we were in the hands of people
that would understand
and give us some help
its hard to believe with all
that sophisticated equipment
that they wouldnt try
some kind of radio contact
it became obvious that
everything about them
was out of step
and you must realize that
we had no alternative
except to keep our heads and
look for every opportunity
and you didnt pull that
one off very well neither
i know but
colonel what id like to know is
who has jurisdiction
over something like this
nobody
its a friendly island
mark oh thats wonderful
now when you say that a
man is being held prisoner
and he might be an american
now if youre mistaken in that
that could bring about
some kind of embarrassment
oh theres no mistake
i only wish there was
tell you very frankly
if i didnt know i was hearing
this from the horses mouth
id check my communications
for a big hole somewhere
youre just gonna have
to see it for yourself
see for myself
doc mmhmm
colonel im very sorry
but i realize that this
sounds like its a uh
paperback huh
well
i cannot brush off the reality
of that raft that you were on
those logs are tangible
obviously rooted to the ground
and the ground is there
just like i told you
and if it hadnt been for those logs
we wouldnt have gotten any place
and believe me thats
something im very thankful for
so much has happened really
that the mind cant catalog it
but the one thing on top
is we gotta get back there
and without losing any more time
get an okay from manila this afternoon
dramatic music
what the
i dont know why but
the girls huts are gone
they were right there
come on
melvin
melvin
i dont believe it
dramatic music
well
the house the laboratory
theyve completely disappeared
disappeared
holy cow
so thats your story
the house was there but
its not there any more
right
well we might as well wrap this up
as quickly as possible
wait a minute
youre not gonna leave us
just walk away from it
just walk away
its clear you hallucinated
the whole thing
hallucinated
subdued music
hallucinated
all four of us
thats ridiculous
how can all four of us
hallucinate the same thing
aw its nuts
now answer me doc
how can four grown men
four different minds
go through all of this and
it just had to go up and
melvin barks
hey
