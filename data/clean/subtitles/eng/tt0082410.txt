but it is not the promised land

or maybe we could build a raft 
but how are we gonna make
it over these bluffs  huh 
 suspenseful music 
 melvin barks 
well  we ve got plenty
of wood for a raft here

  hey  what happened 
  just another attempt by
zyrid to take one of us off 
  zyrid 
  he tries this often  but
he s programed to weaken 
  but who is he 
  part of a ship s crew 
normal until they experimented on him 
  until they experimented 
 laughing 
  you kiddos got a little problem  huh 
  i ve warned you before 
you re going to be very
sorry if you don t stop this 
  hey  hey  now 
you just take it easy 
we ain t responsible
for every little thing
that happens to ya  huh 
  oh  no 
  you should be thankful
for the mirrors we brought 
  yeah 
  i ll be thankful and you be careful 
 laughing 
  i suggest we get on our horses
and get out of here right now 
  well  there s no question
they re deep into witchcraft 
so that might throw your
travel plans into reverse 
  hey  they like us 
they re not gonna 
  hey  look 
i don t want to press it 
  they didn t seem to care in the least
about that phenomenon with your arm 
  oh  i got that figured 
it s when you mix a
particular place  not here 
but on the outside  that s
when the power hits you 
  the power 
  yeah  it s sort of built in 
it s like telepathy 
  telepathy 
  no  no  no  no 
it is like telepathy 
  what are you talking about 
  come on  come on 
i m gonna show you 
how s it going 
  oh  pretty good  curt 
  did dino ever tell you
about his football days 
  football 
   curtis  like the time
he scored three touchdowns 
  against miami 
 grunting 
  here  let me help you 
come here 
stand up 
  well 
 melvin barking 
so watch what you say 
  if i can t ask about   
what can i ask about 
 laughing 
  anything you want 
we got no secrets here 
we got no secrets here  have we 
  i think you ll find just the
opposite if you come with us 
  come where 
  not far 
where the valleys rise to the sun 
  okay 
 laughing 
 suspenseful music 
  you ll not be going there 
not yet 
 laughing 
  i ll make some arrangements 
get you an invitation up to the house 
  invitation 
  it may take a while  may not 
 laughing 
  do they think we re
crazy enough to eat this 
  it s probably all right 
  the other tray 
   doc  hello 
  who are you 
  i d like to ask the same thing 
we re about as startled as you are 
  how did you get here 
  we were ballooning 
we were trying to break
a long distance record 
we came here 
  no 
don t say where 
shh 
you never say where 
   curtis  yeah  we know about that 
it took us a while  but we found out 
  my name is jayson 
i m clay jayson 
would you like some 
i come from   
it doesn t matter where i come from 
  how long have you been here 
  how long 
  yeah 
  have i been here 
how long 
uh  how long 
um 
uh  17 
this is the 17th year 
  17th year 
  i was a captain on a schooner 
there was a storm 
the biggest storm i ever saw 
with huge waves and flung
everybody overboard 
and i clung 
i clung to a reef 
they re all gone 
all the others  they re all gone 
  you ve been alone here for 17 years 
 wood clatters 
  they re all gone 
and in the deafening roar 
in monstrous surf  i saw lenore 
my wife lenore 
mr  poe 
mr  edgar allen poe had me in mind 
do you believe that 
   doc  why are you in this cell 
what have you done 
  what have i done 
what did i do 
here  i ll show you 
look 
no 
no 
it s too hideous 
i have given red corpuscles
enough to fill a frigate 
and they  they keep me alive
so the supply will never drop off 
do you understand 
  you re a   
you re a donor 
  that s a good one 
donor  yes 
it s something like that 
  i don t know who we re gonna run into 
or how many they re gonna be 
but i don t want to end up in a cell 
do you know where i can find a
gun or where i can steal one 
 door opening 
 tense music 
  while many demon ghosts go by 
i pray my dead lenore shall lie
forever with unopened eye 
  this man must be
sedated from time to time 
he s dangerous 
  he didn t seem that way to me 
  when you ve been around
here as long as i have 
you can start giving out opinions 
don t concern yourself with him 
our request for your
invitation has been granted 
  my best brandy 
the oldest in stock 
i m sheila frankenstein 
  how do you do 
  actually  it s von helsing 
i don t prefer my married name 
  i m dr  hadley 
this is curt ryan  and dino  markie 
  keep this away from jocko 
he wouldn t appreciate it 
  jocko won t seek the brandy 
not when there s rum around 
   doc  that s quite a
famous name you have 
  oh  it has my deepest reverence 
  is there any relationship
between you and  um 
  oh  yes 
dr  frankenstein  my
great great grandfather 
he originated everything on the island 
including that power
which paralyzes the arm 
frankenstein set many forces in action 
and in doing so  created his own law 
he still enforces it by
channeling through my husband 
  your husband 
  please  understand that
everything is open here 
there s nothing i wish
in any way to be hidden 
so i ll be boldly specific 
my husband was an integral part
of the frankenstein experiments 
in the early days  the two
of them traveled far beyond
man s understanding of life and death 
so very far that an unbreakable bond
was formed between them 
it endures today with one
dead and the other alive 
through their communication 
dr  frankenstein still
controls this island 
  he s pretty happy about you fellows 
  even though he s dead 
  being dead s no problem 
it s just the opposite 
what do you think was pulling
you here  your own free will 
  hey  remember my mentioning to you
when the balloon was twisting 
the wind was bringing
on a different effect 
it seemed like we were
caught in some kind of power 
 laughing 
  it s true 
your arrival is an omen 
  yes  an omen 
  the girls like you and that
demands your helping them 
  you want us to help the girls 
  perhaps some of you can
serve to impregnate them
in order to ensure future generations 
 laughing 
  we have accommodations 
facilities  a social life 
and you fellas have
stepped right inside of it 
  yes  well 
i think we better get back on the track
of finding some kind of transportation 
i don t mean to seem ungrateful 
but we d better get on
with what we have to do 
  i m afraid that any
such action is entirely
in the hands of my husband 
   mark  where is he 
  you ll see him 
our guests will need a good night s sleep 
unlock the rooms by the lab 
  yes  of course 
 tense music 
  aside 
aside 
your presence doesn t bother this one 
he s balanced quite well 
they re all programmed
to be perfect guards 
but some are unpredictable 
  what s happened to them 
  they ve gone through
some elaborate changes 
  caused by what 
  the quest of science 
  if they re unpredictable 
couldn t that lead to violence 
  sometimes beyond tolerance 
in such cases  a gun is useless
because they have no bloodstream 
they have to be literally cut
in half with a machine gun 
they do fine  except for the eyes 
they ve been using a local narcotic
which causes optic problems 
they ve become severely
sensitive to light 
   doc  this is marvelous 
  try it 
you ll be in for a surprise 
  i can t believe the
reading on this meter 
our best researchers haven t dreamt
of anything even close to this 
how d you work it out 
  well  i didn t 
this island was originally chosen 
not simply because of its barrier bluffs 
but because it was once a landing site
for men and women of a
superior civilization 
 machine beeping 
  nice little item 
a brain 
  are you saying that aliens
landed here some time ago 
  yeah  aliens 
that explains it about the girls 
  the girls are direct descendants 
although their blood is mixed
with that of our own people 
   curtis  and some are more
on one side than the other 
  my husband has been bed
ridden for a long time 
this is my husband dr  von helsing

they re the most beautiful
vegetables i ve ever seen

but mostly it s due to
the nutrient compounds

  wow 
  growth is so rapid  we
have to filter the sun 
  really 
  wow 
  oh  well 
i ll let you show yourselves around now 
i m due at the lab 
i ll be integrating
some unusual blood types
if you care to observe 
  oh  yes 
i d like to very much 
i think  perhaps  later
on if it s all right 
  well  if you like
sports  they re over there 
  oh  sports 
 laughing 
  up  sport 
come on  mate 
we go to the sport 
 growling

hold it  mates 
hold it

hey  listen 
 laughing 
gotta do it real slow and
steady to keep  em embalmed

  hey  jocko 
how d you lose the eye 
  how d i lose me eye 
  yeah 
how d you lose your eye 
  how did i lose me eye 
this is all they left of it  neighbor

  oh  guy devere  hast thou no tear 
weep now when evermore 
see on yon drear and rigid beer 
lo lies  my love 
lenore 
  jayson 
how do you feel  jayson 
  oh  yes 
let the burial rights be read 
a funeral song be sung 
a dirge for her 
the doubly dead 
in that she died so young  so young 
   mark  hey  jayson 
jayson 
  so young 
   mark  hey  jayson 
don t you remember us 
we wanna help you 
  jayson  do you feel numbness anywhere 
  in that she died so young 
  look  i think the best bet
is to find out what the drug is 
if she ll tell me that 
i might be able to find
what i need in the lab 
  yeah 
we better start building that raft 
  hey  melvin 
been behaving yourself 
he been giving you much trouble 
  not at all 
  i really appreciate you 
i mean  you ve really been a big help 
  i love him 
  well 
   mark  dino  we re gonna
check out the cave openings 
you check out the beach  okay 
  can you put melvin inside for a while 
  sure 
  you can come down to the ocean with me 
help me collect some driftwood 
 machine beeping 
  it s good 
good 
exceptionally strong 
  i don t dare hope that
it will remain that way 
  dr  frankenstein is considering
a new plan i ve worked up 
we re most optimistic about it 
  you know  when i hear
you casually mention
communicating with dr  frankenstein 
communicating with a dead man 
i don t know quite how to take it 
  it s not quite so
bizarre as you might think 
it s fact 
but my husband s the one who communicates 
i can get through only rarely 
i could in this case
because this particular plan
has great bearing on our future 
it promises that my husband
will be out of this bed permanently 
  when you learn of the incredible
capabilities of the mind 
you will realize how many
things fall within it 
like the power that s
used to control the one
who attacks those girls out there 
they can only produce inferior offspring 
so a power source has been set up
which in time weakens him 
and the others you have seen  the guards 
they have no bloodstream
because they need none 
they live on psychic energy 
dr  frankenstein and i
learned of these things
early in our research 
  you keep referring to
work with dr  frankenstein 
but in the framework of time 
how can that possibly be 
  good god  man 
didn t she tell you 
i m almost 200 years old 
  we know we stopped
your work and everything 
and like  we really do appreciate it 
  all right  girls 
now here s what we want you to do 
i want you to go down to the
woods and find some logs 
some straight logs 
you get  em and you bring  em back here 
now  i want to examine them
before we go down to the beach 
oh  and i want a few of you
to start weaving some rope 
use the kind that supports
the roof of that hut 
that should be good
enough  don t you think 
  yeah 
see  none of us have
ever made a raft before 
  oh  come on  curt 
i wouldn t worry about that 
this raft is gonna be seaworthy 
and good and strong like any ship 
 tense music 
   doc  there  hold that point 
part of it s holding  but
the oscillator is slow 
 machine beeping 
  it s steady at 1 800 volts 
it should peak at about 40 000 
  those carriers are
pretty close together 
they could be acting as a transformer 
  yes  of corse 
of course  it could be 
 coughing 
   doc  what is it 
  just the usual 
i m afraid continual life has
its continual ups and downs 
  his pulse has weakened considerably 
  he ll have to go back into trance
for at least three hours 
  couldn t that be dangerous
with the voltage unsteady 
  only the peak is fluctuating 
indeed  i need them quite badly 
  there s something else in all this 
something much more important
than anything you ve seen so far 
dr  frankenstein sends
power from the other realm 
  power 
  one that can accomplish great things 
dr  frankenstein  before he died 
perfected a very startling theory
which utilizes an
intermediary  a human brain 
which is a connecting
link for transmission 
  the brain is kept alive by low voltage 
  it stays on an expanded threshold 
a super nourished state 
  how can any of us forget
the great contribution he made
by creating a human life 
even though it was a monster 
  yes 
whatever happened to that creation 
  in the years   
throughout the years the mind
of the monster never developed
though his strength never ceased 
the strength paralleled
his great urge to destroy 
we had to chain him to
the reef  underwater 
beneath the grotto 
 suspenseful music 
  hey  you know what i d like to do 
grab all the air i can
and dive under the rock 
  to where 
  the ocean 
the water s salty 
that s where it s from 
boy  i wish i had some scuba gear 
  when we pass this spot 
we keep right on going 
  yeah 
why s that 
  i can t say 
it s   
i can t say 
   laughs  you know  that s
what i like about you 
you never keep any secrets 
hey 
that looks like a form down there 
a human 
wow  there goes my imagination

come on  jayson 
he was better before 
 tones pulsing 
  it s not necessary to eavesdrop 
  oh  you surprised us 
  i would expect i had 
that ll do 
  we re just looking for doc 
we thought maybe 
  follow me 
 electricity zapping 
 machine beeping 
  is he all right 
  yeah  fine 
  the raft s almost finished 
   doc  hmm 
  the raft 
by tonight it ll be
loaded and ready to go 
  wait a minute 
  you know  jayson feels bad 
looks bad 
did you find anything to help him with 
  to what 
  jayson  to help him 
 gasps 
  if this were dropped 
we d lose much more
than you could imagine 
  oh  i m sorry 
  must your friends be here
at this particular time 
i think they re taking advantage 
  yes 
yes  you re right 
now  look  mark 
it would be better if you wait outside 
what i mean is  wait until tomorrow 
we re in the middle here of
something very important 
  other things are important  too 
  look  i m talking about life 
do you here me 
life 
we may be on the verge of discovering
the very factor that animates it 
have you any idea what that means 
no  you wouldn t 
you d never understand 
  oh  i wouldn t  huh 
  mark  come back tomorrow 
please 
  sure 
  bring her over here 
  she s the daughter of a strong woman
with a parallel link to pure alien 
  with her blood available 
i don t know why you didn t
do this a long time ago 
  well  transfusing animal
blood with that of a human
never seemed promising 
in light of my husband s changes 
the possibility was
never really considered 
  go get the animals 
   mark  hello 
  let s take a rest 
spread out 
  what s the matter  something wrong 
  leone is missing 
  oh 
  we found the tracks and one
set go deep into the ground 
  oh 
  i m sorry  myra 
  let s just follow the tracks 
  why  sure 
  it s no use 
  wait a minute  we can help 
the three of us can 
  there s nothing that can be done 
not now 
two sets of tracks means he won t weaken
the way he does when he s alone 
that happens when they want
one of us for an experiment 
  oh 
hey  wait a minute 
i ll tell you what we ll do 
tonight  when it gets dark 
we ll go back there
together  all of us  okay 
 crying 
  this kind of thing happen very often 
  sometimes 
  well  you ve gotta set
up some kind of protection 
you know  like deep pits in
the ground covered with grass 
  yes  but 
 subdued music 
  come on 
maybe we ll be able to bring her back 
  we won t 
  there 
now you ve been adopted into the tribe 
   girl  he was a long time ago 
adopted 
i m going to miss him 
  he s gonna miss you 
he s gonna miss you very much 
 laughing 
  did you touch   
touch the bottle 
  i hardly have time  but  well 
 yells 
  mate  mate 
now  mate 
  wasn t a bad drink 
by the way  don t lag behind
on that embalming powder 
twice an hour  she said 
until the autopsy 
  embalming powder 
  yeah 
  yes 
  all right 
  i can  mate 
 laughing 
make room for the bottle 
 laughing 
  i don t know how many
more of these they want 
but i m not gonna chase any
more like i did this one 
  oh  laddy 
you re just sorry
because this is a bummer 
you wanted him for sunday dinner 
 laughing 
 machine beeping 
  wish we could ve saved her 
  how s the pulse 
  strong 
  let s increase the voltage 
  no  no  no 
i think it s high enough 
  what do you think 
  uh  no 
no more 
  no more animals will be needed 
i ll let you know if there s a change

how do you feel

very much so 
   doc  good 
  we ve done it 
i think we ve really done it 
  done what 
  found a blood supply that ll hold 
if it sustains the way i think
it will  it ll be permanent 
why  you ve never balanced
as quickly as this 
  what may i ask did you transfuse 
  we funneled fresh
hematitis by one quarter pint
for every full one received
from one of your alien girls 
  animal blood 
are you saying that you
gave me animal blood 
  with a slow entry rate 
the body itself homogenizes the two types 
  whose idea was this 
  well  mine 
i thought that 
  you thought 
if you d really thought you
would have looked in my journals
and found out that we
had tried this concept
before you were born 
it almost ended me 
   doc  we ll drain it immediately 
  i ll need type a 
that means the captain jayson 
you ll have to start
the transfusion slowly 
don t rush 
but gradually pick up

  don t they cut down on the night shift 
  cut down is right and
i m gonna do the cutting 
  come again 
  machine guns 
remember what she said 
the only to handle these
guys is with machine guns 
  yeah 
cut  em right down the middle 
got a couple on ya 
  she wouldn t have mentioned it
if there wasn t at least one
of them around here somewhere 
now my guess is there s one in that house 
do you know what a machine gun looks like 
  um  i think so 
  oh 
they re about this long  you know 
they shoot bullets 
  come on

for what it s worth  we
bolted your outside door 
those guys are too dumb
to come in the window 
  look  mark 
you re doing what i expect you
to  and i know you mean well 
but this is something
out of your experience 
if you had any idea about
the science we re after 
what they re really doing 
you d see the mistake in your thinking 
  be careful 
don t bump it 
  mark  its value is more
than you can imagine 
  look  what do you think 
maybe it s the brain we should destroy 
 electricity zapping 
  i hear thee 
one so close  i hear 
though as i hear  be reassured 
my response is forthcoming 
o celeste of the heavens 
o horse within the light 
i call for a decree in the
tradition we perpetuated

created one becomes full 
that he be free 
grant that he be free 
and behest the name of
frankenstein to endure 
 tense music 
upon the name of the golden
thread  ye shall have strength 
strength 
strength upon the name
of the golden thread 
ye shall have strength 
ye shall have strength 
 ominous music 
 dramatic music 
  mark  i want you to listen to me 
we ve been friends a long time 
now  you owe something to that friendship 
  no  doc 
if you were yourself 
you wouldn t be asking me
to do anything different 
they ve been feeding you
dope ever since you got here 
  you re psyched out  doc 
and you don t know it 
  please  i m begging you 
don t do this 
  madam  i m doing nothing 
and i might add  so are
you and your husband 
  i ll release your friend 
 dramatic music 
 growling 
 electricity zapping 
 laughing 
 tense music 
 thunder crashing 
 melvin whimpers 
 laughing 
 thunder crashes 
  he s all right now 
how do you feel  doc 
  like i ve been asleep 
 laughs 
  we ve lost far too much time 
get the girl ready for the transfusion 
  whoa  i didn t promise
anything about that 
  you certainly implied it 
you indicated that if my husband
would cooperate  you d see 
  wait a minute 
wait  wait 
i m the correct blood type 
i ll donate two pints 
 door clatters 
 dramatic music 
  it s jammed 
 grunting 
 gasping 
 melvin barking 
 growling 
 glass shatters 
 tone pulses 
 shelf clattering 
  the brain  it s going to be destroyed 
  don t worry 
if the brain is damaged 
another one will activate in seconds 
the power will start again 
a backup brain was hidden
years ago just in case 
  now s your chance to go 
  go 
  take the raft and go 
now you have a chance 
but only for a minute 
  what are you talking about 
  i overheard them discussing it 
when the brain was
damaged  the power stopped 
but there s another
brain hidden somewhere 
it ll activate any minute and
they ll all be strong again 
  she s right 
we could bring back help 
   dino  come on 
we re getting out 
  he can t move 
it s impossible 
he s barely alive 
   dino  then you come 
  i can t 
he s my father 
   doc  dino  come on 
we ve gotta go 
dino  come on 
   dino  we ll come back for ya 
we ll come back for ya 
  the thing just got
more and more fantastic
as the situations were developing 
you see  at first  i thought
we were in the hands of people
that would understand
and give us some help 
  it s hard to believe with all
that sophisticated equipment
that they wouldn t try
some kind of radio contact 
  it became obvious that
everything about them
was out of step 
and you must realize that
we had no alternative
except to keep our heads and
look for every opportunity 
  and you didn t pull that
one off very well neither 
  i know  but 
  colonel  what i d like to know is
who has jurisdiction
over something like this 
  nobody 
it s a friendly island 
   mark  oh  that s wonderful 
  now  when you say that a
man is being held prisoner
and he might be an american 
now  if you re mistaken in that 
that could bring about
some kind of embarrassment 
  oh  there s no mistake 
i only wish there was 
  tell you very frankly 
if i didn t know i was hearing
this from the horse s mouth 
i d check my communications
for a big hole somewhere 
  you re just gonna have
to see it for yourself 
  see for myself 
   doc  mm hmm 
  colonel  i m very sorry 
but i realize that this
sounds like it s a  uh 
  paperback  huh 
  well 
  i cannot brush off the reality
of that raft that you were on 
those logs are tangible 
obviously  rooted to the ground 
  and the ground is there 
just like i told you 
and if it hadn t been for those logs 
we wouldn t have gotten any place 
and believe me  that s
something i m very thankful for 
  so much has happened  really 
that the mind can t catalog it 
but the one thing on top
is we gotta get back there
and without losing any more time 
  get an okay from manila this afternoon 
 dramatic music 
  what the 
  i don t know why  but
the girls  huts are gone 
they were right there 
  come on 
  melvin 
melvin 
  i don t believe it 
 dramatic music 
  well 
  the house  the laboratory 
they ve completely disappeared 
  disappeared 
  holy cow 
  so that s your story 
the house was there  but
it s not there any more 
  right 
  well  we might as well wrap this up
as quickly as possible 
  wait a minute 
you re not gonna leave us 
just walk away from it 
  just walk away 
it s clear you hallucinated
the whole thing 
  hallucinated 
 subdued music 
  hallucinated 
  all four of us 
  that s ridiculous 
how can all four of us
hallucinate the same thing 
  aw  it s nuts 
now  answer me  doc 
how can four grown men 
four different minds 
go through all of this and
it just had to go up and 
 melvin barks 
  hey
