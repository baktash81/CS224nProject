 retching 
 coughs 
always ready to take a bow 
anthony  my brother  a total winner
with a great sense of style 
 crying 
and baby trevor

bottom line  today was an epic disaster 
the worst day possible 
everyone in my family would agree 
but what they don t know 
is it was all my fault 
and it wasn t over yet 
   animal hissing 
   all screaming 
 didgeridoo blaring

just to get it all out 
what s in my head
and i  i am feeling a little peculiar   
lord of the flies 
pretty scary  right 
lord of the flies
is beautiful  alexander 
it s a deep and meaningful allegory
about our own messed up society 
yeah  totally 
that s what i meant with  scary  
the society stuff  crazy 
  hey  check out this app 
   camera clicks 
he puts your face on
some bikini model s body 
  it s really gross and sexist 
   chuckles 
this is gonna be hilarious

 laughter

i m gonna read from a very special book 
you ready 
get out of my way  i need him  sir 
 today s the day  you re growing up 
 i m here to help you   
take that dump  
please don t  sir 
 take that dump in the pool 
   take that dump on the bed 
   groans

on your brother s head 
 you can take a dump like a frog 
 i ll take a big dump like a dog  
no  it s  jump  
it s just jump  sir  not dump 
would you excuse me for a moment 
i never agreed to do this kind of   
kelly  there was a misprint 
jump like a frog  one little letter 
it was a mistake 
it was meant to be jump  i m so sorry 
there she is  right there 
with the bad hair  she s behind this 
 children crying 
okay  we got this  we got this  right 
you good  you cool  you ready 
you ready to nail this  all right 
 elevator bell dings 
oh  wow 
hey  man  guys are ready for you 
  let s go 
  oh  great  thank you 
at first we thought
it was a little weird
that you even applied for this job   
because we re pretty young and you re   
older 
  yeah 
  yeah 
kind of decrepit 
but then we took a look at your resume 
and your experience is awesome 
you re part of
the space station design team 
you have a ph d  in
orbital mechanics  i mean  for real 
for real 
sorry 
hey  you 
he s a little out of sorts today 
 trevor cooing 
 chuckles  it s so hard
to find the bumble bee pacifier 
it would blow your mind  anyway   
here you go 
he s just gonna play for a while 
and  kids are crazy 
they re fun 
yeah 
so  what were we talking about 
we re thinking about
launching this game 
we want it to be a space station
simulation strategy game 
we want it to be authentic
and completely immersive 
ben  that sounds really exciting 
that s in my wheelhouse 
great  we wanna hear some ideas 
i guess my first idea would
be modular evolution 
cool 
space stations are not static 
they grow over time 
so you would want to start with
perhaps a small space station   
and grow it into
an enormous space station 
and i think players
should have that opportunity 
they could add greenhouses 
they could add labs 
they could grow a space station   
as big as their imagination 
  uh    your kid 
  oh 
you know what  that ll be fine 
because we can get daycare 
so that won t be an issue 
no  no  no 
your kid right now   
his face is all green 
oh  wow  trev 
trevor  i know 
that s not for eating 
yoshi  what s up  man 
good news to report or what 
actually  we have
a skype call we gotta take

not passing the blame on this one 
i told you today might not be
a good day to take the test 
dad  i had to take the test today 
no  you didn t have
to take the test today 
emily  it is all alexander s fault 
if he hadn t dropped trevor s
paci down the disposal   
i never would have rehearsed
in a cold car and gotten sick 
that s also your fault 
kelly  if you hadn t left the
battery on in my car all night   
i wouldn t have been late to work   
and dick van dyke wouldn t be mad at me 
chim chiminey wants to kill me 
can you imagine 
mom  trevor was crying 
where was i supposed to rehearse 
how were you able to hit
every parking meter on that street 
when i was in the bathroom
this morning  mom saw me naked

horrible  terrible day 
so i wished it   
and now you re all having one 
 sniggers 
ben  alexander

for you to have
that kind of supernatural ability

with her in the back of the van 
okay  we don t need to hear that 
alexander  okay  i m sorry
