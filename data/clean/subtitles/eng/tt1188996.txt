things l don t understand 
for instance  people say when l go
to their houses   come  rizvan  
  think of it as your own house  
but how do l do that
when the house isn t mine 
l don t understand why people
say one thing and think another 
my ammi would say there are only

good people and bad people 
l m a good person 
l do good deeds 
l m here to sell mehnaz

this cream has an extra
care skin nourishing lotion

you how acidic or basic it is 
the exponentials of
hydrogen ions being very high  
  it s not practical to measure it

lt happened at the
community soccer field 
lnspector garcia told us
that our sam s death  
  may have been a racial attack 
his wounds were proof of that 
he was a muslim  so he was killed 
but l couldn t understand 
being a muslim is not
a bad thing  mandira 
sam

mandira  
we killed him 
mandira

just shut up  just shut up 
are you listening
to what l am saying 
we killed him 
lt s all my fault 
lf l hadn t married you

  if a  khan  was added to his name 
but l was wrong 
lt makes a difference 
lt does make a difference 
l should never have
married a muslim man 
lf sam had been a rathod  hindu  
he would have been alive today

people and 754 cows exactly 
all the people here

remembering and talking about them  
  we can get closer to them

she cries all the time 
l loved my brother so much 
and l just want him to know

l too tried to get closer to sam 
sameer rathod khan  my son 
weight 56 kilogram 
blood group o positive 
sameer loved xbox and soccer 
he loved his soccer shoes so
much that he would sleep in them 
that was the only bad habit he had 
sam was six years old
when l married his mother 
sameer was a good son 
he did not mind sharing
his mom s love with me 
but l couldn t be
such a good dad to him 
other dads sense their children s
unsaid needs and fulfil them 
but l can t sense
unexpressed feelings 
so  l couldn t fulfil them 
but   but  sam never complained 
he never complained 
sam had one more bad habit 
he told us only good things 
he always hid bad news from us 
he would never tell me
when my favorite  
  team manchester united lost 
never 
unless we had a bet 
then he would tell me 
then l would l have to give him
his mint chocolate chip ice cream 
two scoops 
two scoops  always 
two scoops 
on 27th november 2007 
he was killed 
he was 13 years  nine
months and four days old 
sameer was not only my son 
he was my dearest friend 
actually  my only friend 
my  
my   only best friend 
l m sure allah is happy that
sam is with him in heaven

with our hindu brothers too 
l treat a lot of hindu
patients in st  benedict s hospital 
l get angry only
when this same grace  
  is not
reciprocated towards us muslims 
my blood boils  
  when lsraeli jews
massacre our palestinian brothers 
or when hindus in lndia  
  cut our women and children
to pieces with their swords 
that s when my blood boils 
doesn t your blood boil  answer me 
doesn t your blood boil 
  lt does  lt does 
lt does  lt does 
so  do something then  do something 
l  dr  faisal rehman 
take an oath that l m ready 
are you people ready  are you 
yes  we are  yes  yes  we are 
are you people ready 
yes  we are  yes  yes  we are 
mighty allah had even asked
lbrahim to sacrifice his son 
and without asking a single question 
lbrahim agreed to sacrifice him 
lt s our turn today 
lt s our duty to let our blood
flow for the cause of lslam 
this is what allah demands 
this is what lslam demands 
no  no  no  no 
no 
you are lying 
wait   wait  
why  brother 
don t you believe that the lord
had asked for lsmail s sacrifice 
no  no 
my ammi has told me the story 
saint lbrahim did not doubt
the compassion of the lord 
no  no  no  no 
the story is an example of his
immense strong faith and belief 
and that s the reason  
  why despite being incited
by a stranger repeatedly  
  saint lbrahim did not waver
from his path of righteousness 
no 
he didn t listen to the stranger 
he was sure allah would never allow
the blood of his progeny to be shed 
and he was right 
the mighty allah
saved lsmail s life 
my ammi also said   rizvan  
  this story shows that the
path ofallah is that of love  
  not of hatred and war  
you are lying 
dr  faisal rehman is a liar 
  you are lying 
look  the meaning of
the story is clear 
dr  faisal rehman is a liar 
  our brother here speaks the truth 
allah s path is that of compassion 
that s why his loved ones are called
 blessed by the compassionate   
dr  faisal rehman is a liar 
ask him who was that stranger 
l m not lying 
you are lying 
our times demand  
  ask him  
the stranger who tried to
veer lbrahim from his path  
  was he an infidel 
how does it matter who he was 
but doctor  who was he 
listen l can explain everything 
brother  tell us who he was 
satan  satan  satan

thank you for your time  sir 
you have one new message 
hi raj  this is
bobby ahuja from pbc 
don t forget to
watch the news tomorrow 
my name is khan  and
l m not a terrorist 
mr  president 
rizvan khan of banville
california was arrested  
  on june 15th at the
cla presidential rally 
he has been accused
of being a terrorist  
  and has been jailed
for the last 15 days 
without any evidence 
and without legal representation 
and today  we have with us mr 
and mrs  zakir khan 
family of rizvan khan 
lmran  the khan from the bus is
on pbc  quick  switch on the tv 
very angry and very upset 
l mean  how can anyone
call him a terrorist 
that too without any evidence 
tell them how last month
bhai called for the fbl 
bhai had called last month 
he wanted the number for the fbl 
he wanted to report some terrorist
recruiter called  dr  faisal rehman 
yo  how s business  asshole 
fuck you

report suspicious characters 
participate in   protecting
the country from extremists 
and then when we do that  
  we re just put into
the jail  like my brother 
yeah  this is judge preston 
can you give me the fbl please 
the question over here is  not why
he s trying to meet the president 
the question is  what s
wrong in an ordinary citizen  
  wanting to meet the
president of his country 
or is itjust wrong for
a muslim man to even try 
and as rizvan khan
continues to be treated as guilty  
  until proven innocent  for
pbc news  my name is bobby ahuja 
and l m not a terrorist 
he is right  zakir bhai is right 
we are told to report to the
government any information  
  we have on any terrorist activity 
and when we do that 
what happens is before you 
why is this being
asked over and over again 
 why does khan want to
meet the president  
what s the harm if an ordinary
citizen wants to meet the president 
what s wrong 
or then tell us clearly that
muslims don t have right to do so

mama jenny   mama

delay in meeting the president 
l have come to wilhemina  georgia 
mama jenny and funny
hair joel are in trouble

mama  rizvan 
oh  god the church is going to fall 
we re going to die 
the church is going to fall 
hadith says that the almighty
does notjudge by color or creed  
  but by actions and deeds 
lf that is the truth  
  then rizvan khan by the
sheer force of his actions  
  has elevated the entire
humanity in the eyes of god 
just recently this
man was arrested  
  and tortured for being an
enemy combatant of this country 
wonder what the government
officials would call this  
  muslim enemy combatant today 
as he selflessly tries to save
the remaining lives in wilhemina 
just a few days ago this
man was called a terrorist  
  and tortured mercilessly 
today we wait for the response
of the government officials  
  as he tirelessly
strives to save innocent lives 
lf the authorities want
to find the true enemy  
  combatant of this country 
then they would find it in the
grief and debris of wilhemina 
lt s a long journey
to change the world 
but the first few steps have been
taken by rizvan khan in wilhemina 
lsn t it our duty now to
take this journey forward 
raj burman  star news 
please don t take my
baby away from me 
mandira  people are suffering
here and are very helpless 
l wish l could take
all of them from here 
but l don t have the
physical strength to do that 
mama jenny is right  
this one   this one l can t repair 
now we can only await
the lord s merciful eye 
mama  mama 
while several hurricane hit areas  
  have suffered from
government inaction 
one small town in georgia is
slowly getting back on its feet 
this group has brought
something more valuable than money 
they brought themselves 
the us government may
have forgotten the flood  
  inflicted area of wilhemina 
georgia  
  but one man has
refused to be indifferent  
  to the plight of its inhabitants 
this one man has spared
no efforts in helping  
  rehabilitate the
population ofwilhemina 
looking at him as an
inspiration today  
  many americans have
rushed to wilhemina  
  and its neighboring towns to help
in rebuilding the destroyed towns 
and all this just
because of one man  
  whose name is rizvan khan  
  and who  in his own words 
is not a  terrorist   
following the example of wilhemina  
  towns are being
adopted across the country 
and while our military
is tied up in lraq  
  reconstruction of these towns  
  has been taken on
by ordinary americans 
and today  as our
special guest from wilhemina  
  we have the man  who
got the whole ball rolling 
mr  rizvan khan 
oh no  no  no it s khan
