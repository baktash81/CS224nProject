markos
quick get us seats over there before those boys take them
the guitarist is so cute
i was right
they are witches
i have to tell sara to get out of there
shes the only girl i actually give a damn about
her delusions has deepened into panic
she feels her constructed mythology is confirmed
if i leave without her
they may pick her next
or olga
i should warn olga too
olgas already figured out things
she saw how they groomed me
theres more in that building than what you can see
theyve been underground since the war
and you think they can hear you now
at the beginning they gave me things
perfect balance perfect sleep
talking with our minds
but they took my hair
they took my urine they
they took my eyes
now she can see me
mother markos
oh she wants to get inside of me
i can feel her
oh i thought i wanted it
i let it happen
if they find out i was here they wont hesitate
theyll hollow me out and eat my cunt on plate

miss blanc came into my audition
but she left right after
shes incredible
the way she transmits her work her energy
when it shines on you its
addictive is the word for it
shes tough
she kept the company alive through the war
when the reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds
and keep their uteruses open
there was blanc
thank you
la vraie chose  the real thing
what
wwas that french
its a bomb
i can smell it
theres a bank that way

the lufthansa flight to a fourth destination or what is the condition
of the 91 hostages still presumed aboard
yesterday one of the palestinian hijackers issued official demands including
the release of all raf members incarcerated at stammshein prison
mother asked for you
she has to know that we can move ahead
now that last nights business is behind us
you all knew my concerns about patricia
what happened to patricia was ghostly
but now that we voted mother wants to try again
and so soon
the question isnt just who to try next
we have to make sure the ritual will work with whichever girl we choose
mother trusts you already have ideas on this subject
maybe sara could be a good option
yes it was right to send her to collect the american girl
sara is a good ambassador for the good company
shes made a home here hasnt she
she feels good here
loved

i dont know
you join in whenever you feel ready
but theres no rush
welcome to our little family
im susie
hi hi

i want to pick up exactly where we left off with volk
ive spoken to olga

such shit
okay
why dont we all break for ten minutes
you cant even be bothered to respect your own lies
miss ivanova
no no no no no its okay
lets face this
patricia is gone olga
we dont know where
if shes gone into hiding she wouldnt have told us
would she
she would have told someone
we know that she had dealings
with people who are interested in targets
and we know there was another bomb
in kreuzberg last night
she wouldnt do that
she wanted to live her beliefs
who doesnt admire that
and theres so much to change in the world
if she wants to live in a cellar
filling bottles with petrol thats her choice
and who wont be heartbroken if shes shot by police
you manipulate everything
she didnt trust you because youre hypocrites
will you take olga to her room please tanner
no miss tanner
call olga a cab
shes had enough
and is going to pack her things
and get the fuck out from this box of rabies
witches
im sorry about that
its a hot thing we do
okay so who will dance the protagonist
sonia
i cant not yet
caroline
very well well manage
i suggest that we all take it from the top
ill dance
i know it
its in the documentary
iive seen it a hundred times at the library
sweetheart we rehearsed this piece
for ten months before we performed it
ive seen it in person too
first do it alone then
we dont want to put the others at risk
the last thing we need
is someone to get kicked in the ribs
all right
okay stop stop stop
stop
all right
clear your head
i want you to start over
have you stretched
this is no joke
olga
olga
come
remember you start on one with the music
and if you feel ill at any time just stop
you start here
and
lauter
bravo bravo susie
itll pass
youre not the first dancer who lost the room
im not usually dizzy
an occasional collapse
is a vocational hazard im afraid
ii didnt i didnt collapse
youre on the floor and thats
not where the dance ends
i was trying not to throw up in your studio
susie its fine
it was wonderful
sara can you take her to her room please
you can rest for the rest of the day
how enlightening
okay come on girls
lets go
and one and two and three
and
no susie
we have to study america
i said no
susanna
everything fine
attention please
dont hurt olga
slowly
out
police station good evening
good evening im reporting a young
woman who may be missing
she couldnt have known what she was doing
she just carried more of our intention than we expected
we also let ourselves get angry with olga
i could feel it
but the girl is natural
like patricia only clean somehow
she may be more what were looking for
even than sara
are we saying that
no im not saying that yet
you dont look better
or are you this pale all the time
i will leave you
good night
the amish split
from the mennonites in the 17th century
they were worried the mennonites
were becoming too liberal
they not we
youve left religious thinking behind you then
and youre not comfortable talking about these things
i dont know why we are
its difficult not to be curious about you
in two days youve auditioned
been accepted and danced a lead
how did your journey towards us begin
i went to new york
to the martha graham center
i saw you there three times
i went once by bus
then i hitchhiked the other two
thats risky
were you punished
yeah
but i felt i had to see you
what did it feel today
to dance volkin front of the one who made it
no no thats a vain question
let me ask you another
when you were dancing what did it feel like
inside you inside your body
it felt like what i think it must feel like to fuck
you mean to fuck a man
no i
was thinking of an animal
you looked
im going to ask caroline
to work on your jumps with you
yours are nowhere near good enough yet
well have to build you up
so that i can dance the protagonist
when you perform it
ill need to see you dance at
this level time and time again
i can do it
olga made volkseem like such heavy lifting
she never understood the heart of volk
she lacked conviction
im relieved shes gone
thank you for your help with that
madame blanc
wants me to dance the protagonist in volk
i didnt think it was gonna be like this
shes so kind
thats wonderful
are you all right
im fine i was just
i was just thinking about what olga said in rehearsal
about patricia
what do you mean
she was active in some political groups
no one knows where she is really
if shes all right
was it true
what olga said
yes
patricia didnt trust the matrons
and i never understood why
if i asked you for a favor tomorrow would you do it
yes
we might get caught
okay
mother mother
mother
mother mother mother mother
mother mother
susanna

this morning
we turn our instincts inward
miss millius miss mandel
can you close the mirrors please
miss marks no music
i want to start work on a new piece
a piece about rebirths
the inevitable pull that they exert
and our efforts to escape them
well learn it now but susie
you will improvise freely at its heart
im interested in your instincts here
the piece will be called weider o√∂ffnen
open again
allez
one two three four

you should have told me she was coming
she wanted to fell susie for herself
so you put her
in a storage closet
under the floor
helena markos
mother wanted it
i though we agreed to stop using that title
if markos really were one of the three mothers
we wouldnt be in this situation
you should have told markos about miss bannion yourself
now mother wants her
are we going to waste another girl so quickly
everyone voted
you are not the light we chose to follow
if markos wants this girl you must prepare her
and does she
yes
markos will live
we found the girl in time
i wont rush again
i will tell markos when the girl is ready
miss balfour
alright
did something happen
hmm
to you during it
nno
did you did you
did you feel something there
someone
or just something
what made you say that
i dont know
am i confusing you
no its um
its odd its the
its the sort of thing patricia would say
its bizarre
come on
lets get changed or sonia will leave without us
ive got a dress you can wear
double caposhi
susie
oh susie
i want to bring in a custom from the old ways
what do you have in mind
a witness
one of our new friends from the police
why not one of those young things at the window
youre forgetting we already have a witness
the old man who sent us the police in the first place
he will be our winess
yes not one of our girls
it would make any of them insane
i agree
and its good for susie to see us like this
that were still part of the world
maybe she even senses what we want of her
she senses a lot
you can see her eyes shine with it
i see it every night
when i send her our dreams
is it true
is it true
i know who i am
i know who i am
its all right
its okay
is she all right
its just a nightmare
the markos company special
im surprised it took this long
hey let me know if she needs a valium
shes right i dreamt of hairballs in toilets
for three weeks before i got
a decent night of sleep here
move over
ive only ever slept in bed with my sister
were sisters now
in a statement released to the press moments ago
the hijackers leader martyrer mahmud
demands baader ensslin m√∂ller and the other raf prisoners
be released from stammheim prison and flown to mogadishu
good morning
id like to talk to detective glockner or detective albrecht
your name
klemperer josef
one moment
as proof of their intentions the hijackers threw down onto the tarmac
the body of the flights pilot jurgen schumann
he had been shot in the head
agent glockners office is on the right
have a seat there and theyll call for you
terror suspect do you know this womans name
mr klemperer
please come inside
we were shown every room
we didnt see anything worth remembering
they are professional performers
illusion is their craft
its not your place to speculate on that
did you speak to the woman called markos
patricia referred to her as
mother markos
she had a delusion about this woman leading a coven there
she had this delusion for months
do you believe in witches doctor
no
but i believe that
people can organize themselves to
perpetrate crimes and call it magic
that i can believe
do you understand the kind of week we are having doctor
detective glockner
this isnt the first time weve met
you were on the police force in friedenau werent you
you helped me to try to locate my wife
your wife also went missing
two years before the russian charge
ankle meire 1943
from the records you helped me cross off poland
im still grateful
and one and two and three
and one and two and three
and one and two and three
and one and two and three
one and two and three
and one and two and three
and one and two and three
and one and two and three
thatsthats okay
do you want to do the jumps
okay
and
one and two and three
and one and two and three
no
elbows higher
all right one moment
susie part of the jump is muscle
and that will develop as you condition
but you seem to have an aversion to them
and i dont quite see why
are you so happy to be stuck to the earth
theres a yield before the push
which i dont think youre quite understanding
caroline could you come and do a series for us please
thank you
and now you
what i really want is to be on
on the floor right now anyway
well of course
thats because youre mistaking physical weakness
with artistic preference
and because youre tired
at this point
the jumps are opposing the pull of the structure
but
its soon for that dont you think
the floor work is is keeping
the other dancers pushed down
so this
this could echo that
onon a slightly higher point of elevation
if i stay close to the ground now
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later
then thats more to the point
the resistance is more
emphatic
right
i dont know how aware you are
of what times we lived through here 40 years ago
out of which this piece was made
we learned at great cost through those years
the value of the balance of things
every arrow that flies feels the pull of the earth
but we must aim upwards
we need to get you in the air
leave her leave her leave her leave her leave
oh caroline
dont be afraid
eveything will be arlight
ja
she hit her head hard
i heard it i hope
miss
one moment please
i am im looking for a dancer from your company
who are you looking for
you are sara
yes
may i help you
i am a friend from patricia
when the deadline arrived the hijackers informed the police
they had poured all the flights dutyfree alcohol over the hostages
and were set to ignite them
but when they were told the west german government
was in the process of releasing the terrorists from stammheim prison
they agreed to extend the deadline to after midnight
i dont know what to make of any of this
i know the kind of thing she was involved with
but i cant see how any of this
could be happening inside the company
well she describes
something like a revolutionary organization
in a crisis of leadership
with markos very ill
i live there
i have friends there
i dont see any evidence of this at all
no one has ever approached me
or any of the other girls as far as i know
read this
what is this
this is patricias diary
mother markos
mother meinhof
the dance rehearsal
political action
these two areas in patricias life
were of equal importance
this is how transference happens
how delusion is made
delusion sara
is a lie that tells a truth
this says witches
mmm
maybe patricias fantasies about witches
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue
the companys a family
theres a lot of love there
love and manipulation
they they share houses very often
they are frequent bedfellows
sorry i dont see this
eat
eat
only
maybe the police they missed something
and patricia she did spoke of
whole hidden areas of the building
actual rooms that are secret
i dont want to be disrespectful
i dont but youre asking me
and im telling you
oh please
its a dance company
were not talking about anything else
sara
please only look closer
thank you for caring for patricia
but i hope you dont come again
good night
good night
sara hurry up
im tired i need the bathroom
good night doll
good night
she hasnt come back yet
maybe shes seeing somebody
part of the issue always
is not being able to see your body in space
one angle in one mirror or on film is not enough
movement is never mute
it is a language
its a series of energetic shapes
written in the air
like words forming sentences
like poems
like prayers
spells
when you jump its not the height
but the space beneath you that matters
every leap into the air must be a coup de foudre
i dont understand
a strike of lightning
a bolt of love in fact
thats beautiful
there are two things that dance can never be again
beautiful and cheerful
today we need to break the nose
of every beautiful thing
and if youre going to be a dancer
you must learn french
try not to worry
blanc is working on the new approach
how could we have known what would happen with patricia
what we are attempting hasnt been done in living memory
how do we know it will work at all
if it killed that girl
it may kill any girl we try
she is not wrong
patricia was unwilling in the end
blanc believes that was the reason
we should not have forced it
she did not want to be a vessel
we wanted to bring her into our power
but she wanted to blow up departments stores intead
what a fool that girl
when you dance the dance of another
you make yourself in the image of its creator
you empty yourself
so that her work can live within you
do you understand
yeah
youre in a company now
you have to find your right place
you have to decide
what is it you want to be for this company
is it the head
the spine
the sex
the heart
the hands
i want to be this companys hands
higher
higher higher
higher
higher higher
higher
higher higher higher
higher
higher
higher higher
higher higher higher
sometimes i only need to be told twice
how do we know no ones planning to blow us up too
patricia might have said anything to anyone about us
as she did with the old man
you are right
we cannot despair
we have time
how much time
if mother dies before blanc can deliver us susie
this company is finished
markos will hold on for us
youve seen her
her bodys a prison
disease is on top of disease
how long she can possibly
33 34 35 36

ten nine eight

we couldnt stop her
she was too fast with knife
shes cold
come with me quickly
patricia wrote about
three mothers lost in time
predating all christian invention
pregod predevil
mother tenebrarum mother lachrymarum
and mother suspiriorum
darkness tears and sighs
i saw images of that last night
in porcelain these very fine things
you can tell they have money
patricia said that uh markos
claims to be one of the three
but there is dissent amongst them
she wrote about markosites and blancites
ininternal division
madame blancs involved in this
do they believe theyre witches
you can give someone your delusion sara
thats religion
that was the reich
the reich had these things
insignia
esoteric ritual
these mothers yeah they could be
code names for founding members
with metaphoric histories
i dont know
but i do know you are living with dangerous people
patricia could still be in
in there
they could be holding her
in the building
well i cannot promise that the authorities
will come back to uh inspect a cabinet
full of porcelain after all that has happened
but we can try
and in the meantime you must
uh take care of yourself
perhaps you should leave
you have somewhere you can go
ill figure it out
and i think you should put this back
or better still you leave it here
not good for them to know that you have it
is anyone among you sick
let him call for the elders of the church
and let them pray over him
anointing him with oil in the name of the lord
and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick
and the lord shall raise him up
and if he has committed sins
my daughter
they shall be forgiven him
my last one
shes my sin
shes what i smeared on the world
first of all its very important do you remember this
you must use your center
and you must create a space
now i understand
wait wait
alright
suspended suspended in the air
remember to create space
yes i understand
youre making some kind of deal with them
i dont know what youre talking about
how can you know
what theyre going to ask you in return
sara whatever you have in your mind
nothing is wrong
you just havent seen the bill yet
nothings wrong
special forces of the german federal police stromed lufthansa 181
in the night and killed three of the four hijackers ending five days
of terror for the passenger of the flight
in the morning in the highsecurity wing of the stuutgartstammheim prison
three of the five raf prisoners were discovered dead in an apparent
suicide pact made upon hearing of the news from mogadishu
protesters are congregating around the germany
chanting that the prisoners were instead assassinated
federal police president horst herold went so far
as to declare the baadermeinoff era is done
whats the matter with you
huh

i believe you deserve to know the truth
your wife did try to make it south
to teplice
she was apprehended by border guards
in the woods just outside of glashu√ºtte
she was then taken to theresienstadt camp
she lived there for 20 days
on the 11th of november 1943
the commandant of the camp a man named burger
ordered all 40000 detained there
stand outside in the cold for a census
hours and hours passed
some hundreds died of exposure
your wife had two women with her as she died
women she had befriended
who made her feel that she was not alone
her final thoughts
were of a birthday
when you took her to a concert as a surprise
chopin and brahms
it was the first time you held her hand
she was cold when she died
but she wasnt afraid
she was thinking only of you
of anke meier
of patricia hingle
of sara simms
of susanna bannion
of all the women of your undoing
every memory will vanish
they will melt away in the sun
and be gone
we need guilt
doctor
and shame
but not yours
herr doktor
herr doktor
