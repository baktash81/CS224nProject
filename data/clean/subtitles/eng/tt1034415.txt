markos 
quick  get us seats over there before those boys take them 
the guitarist is so cute   
i was right 
they are witches  
i have to tell sara to get out of there 
she s the only girl i actually give a damn about 
 her delusions has deepened into panic 
she feels her constructed mythology is confirmed  
if i leave without her 
they may pick her next 
or olga 
i should warn olga  too 
olga s already figured out things 
she saw how they groomed me 
there s more in that building than what you can see 
they ve been underground since the war 
and you think they can hear you now 
at the beginning  they gave me things 
perfect balance  perfect sleep 
talking with our minds 
but they took my hair 
they took my urine  they   
they took my eyes 
now she can see me 
mother markos 
oh  she wants to get inside of me 
i can feel her 
oh  i thought i wanted it 
i let it happen 
if they find out i was here  they won t hesitate 
they ll hollow me out and eat my cunt on plate

 hello 
   for our dancers who reside here

as we cannot pay our dancers a lot of money 
we offer dormitory style rooms  rent free 
you don t    you don t charge anything at all 
not a mark 
in this company  we fully understand
the importance of a woman s financial autonomy 
normally  it would be full at this time of year 
but we have had a room open 
yeah  patricia s 
do you know patricia 
mmm   
no  i heard some girls talking
about her in the hall 
ah 
now that you re one of us  i won t be coy 
patricia has just left the company
under sad circumstances 
we think she won t be back 
so there s room if you want 
we ll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage 
after lunch 
it s all right for you 
yes

i live in berlin 
yes  congrats 
i heard you were a sensation today 
have you called your family yet  to tell them 
miss blanc came into my audition 
but she left right after 
she s incredible 
the way she transmits her work  her energy 
when it shines on you  it s   
 addictive  is the word for it 
she s tough 
she kept the company alive through the war 
when the reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds
and keep their uteruses open 
there was blanc 
thank you 
 la vraie chose    the real thing
what 
w was that french 
it s a bomb 
i can smell it 
there s a bank that way 
don t you know what s happening here 
the hijackers are negotiating a release
of the stammheim prisoners tonight 
the raf 
baader meinhof 
they kidnapped an executive 
during the war  he was a nazi ss  an officer 
now he runs the german employers  association 
you don t get how awful that is  do you

and let the will of the majority proceed 
long life to markos 
   there is no information yet on whether the hijackers will pilot
the lufthansa flight to a fourth destination or what is the condition
of the 91 hostages still presumed aboard 
yesterday  one of the palestinian hijackers issued official demands including
the release of all raf members incarcerated at stammshein prison   
mother asked for you 
she has to know that we can move ahead
now that last night s business is behind us 
you all knew my concerns about patricia 
what happened to patricia was ghostly 
but now that we voted mother wants to try again 
and so soon 
the question isn t just who to try next 
we have to make sure the ritual will work with whichever girl we choose 
mother trusts you already have ideas on this subject 
maybe sara could be a good option 
yes  it was right to send her to collect the american girl 
sara is a good ambassador for the good company 
she s made a home here  hasn t she 
she feels good here 
loved 
uncle josef

but there s no rush 
welcome to our little family 
i m susie 
hi  hi

 such shit 
 okay 
why don t we all break for ten minutes 
you can t even be bothered to respect your own lies 
miss ivanova 
no  no  no  no  no  it s okay 
let s face this 
patricia is gone  olga 
we don t know where 
if she s gone into hiding  she wouldn t have told us 
 would she 
 she would have told someone 
we know that she had dealings
with people who are interested in targets 
and we know there was another bomb
in kreuzberg last night 
she wouldn t do that 
she wanted to live her beliefs 
who doesn t admire that 
and there s so much to change in the world 
if she wants to live in a cellar
filling bottles with petrol  that s her choice 
and who won t be heartbroken if she s shot by police 
you manipulate everything 
she didn t trust you because you re hypocrites 
will you take olga to her room  please  tanner 
no  miss tanner 
call olga a cab 
she s had enough 
and is going to pack her things
and get the fuck out from this box of rabies 
witches 
i m sorry about that 
it s a hot thing we do 
okay  so    who will dance the protagonist 
sonia 
i can t  not yet 
caroline 
very well  we ll manage 
i suggest that we all take it from the top 
i ll dance 
i know it 
it s in the documentary 
i i ve seen it a hundred times at the library 
sweetheart  we rehearsed this piece
for ten months before we performed it 
i ve seen it in person  too 
first do it alone  then 
we don t want to put the others at risk 
the last thing we need
is someone to get kicked in the ribs 
all right 
okay  stop  stop  stop 
stop 
all right 
clear your head 
i want you to start over 
have you stretched 
this is no joke 
olga 
olga 
come 
remember  you start on one with the music 
and if you feel ill at any time  just stop 
you start here 
and   
lauter 
bravo  bravo  susie 
it ll pass 
you re not the first dancer who lost the room 
i m not usually dizzy 
an occasional collapse
is a vocational hazard  i m afraid 
i i didn t    i didn t collapse 
you re on the floor  and that s
not where the dance ends 
i was trying not to throw up in your studio 
susie  it s fine 
it was wonderful 
sara  can you take her to her room  please 
you can rest for the rest of the day 
  how enlightening 
  okay  come on  girls 
let s go 
and one  and two  and three 
and   
no  susie 
we have to study america 
i said no 
susanna 
everything fine 
attention  please 
don t hurt olga 
slowly   
out 
 police station  good evening  
good evening  i m reporting a young
woman who may be missing 
she couldn t have known what she was doing 
she just carried more of our intention than we expected 
we also let ourselves get angry with olga 
i could feel it 
but the girl is natural 
like patricia  only clean somehow 
she may be more what we re looking for 
even than sara 
are we saying that 
no  i m not saying that yet 
you don t look better 
or are you this pale all the time 
i will leave you 
good night 
the amish split
from the mennonites in the 17th century 
they were worried the mennonites
were becoming too liberal 
 they   not  we  
you ve left religious thinking behind you  then 
and you re not comfortable talking about these things 
i don t know why we are 
it s difficult not to be curious about you 
in two days  you ve auditioned 
been accepted and danced a lead 
how did your journey towards us begin 
i went to new york 
to the martha graham center 
i saw you there three times 
i went once by bus 
then i hitchhiked the other two 
that s risky 
were you punished 
yeah 
but i felt i had to see you 
what did it feel today
to dance volkin front of the one who made it 
no  no  that s a vain question 
let me ask you another 
when you were dancing  what did it feel like   
inside you  inside your body 
it felt like what i think it must feel like to fuck 
you mean to fuck a man 
no  i   
was thinking of an animal 
you looked   
i m going to ask caroline
to work on your jumps with you 
yours are nowhere near good enough yet 
we ll have to build you up 
so that i can dance the protagonist
when you perform it 
i ll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again 
i can do it 
olga made volkseem like such heavy lifting 
she never understood the heart of volk 
she lacked conviction 
i m relieved she s gone 
thank you for your help with that 
madame blanc   
wants me to dance the protagonist in volk 
i didn t think it was gonna be like this 
she s so kind 
that s wonderful 
are you all right 
i m fine  i was just   
i was just thinking about what olga said in rehearsal 
about patricia 
what do you mean 
she was active in some political groups 
no one knows where she is  really 
if she s all right 
was it true   
what olga said 
yes 
patricia didn t trust the matrons 
and i never understood why 
if i asked you for a favor tomorrow  would you do it 
yes 
we might get caught 
okay 
mother  mother 
mother 
mother  mother  mother  mother 
mother  mother 
susanna 
come inside  hurry up 
what do you want 
we need to talk to someone in charge 
miss markos 
about a girl named patrizia   
patricia hingle

hmm  how odd 
1961

here  kitty  kitty  kitty 
kitty  kitty  kitty  kitty   
there s nothing 
come on 
sit down 
this morning 
we turn our instincts inward 
miss millius  miss mandel 
can you close the mirrors  please 
miss marks  no music 
i want to start work on a new piece 
a piece about rebirths 
the inevitable pull that they exert
and our efforts to escape them 
we ll learn it now  but  susie 
you will improvise freely at its heart 
i m interested in your instincts here 
the piece will be called weider oöffnen 
open again 
allez 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four

one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one   
you should have told me she was coming 
she wanted to fell susie for herself 
so you put her   
in a storage closet 
under the floor 
helena markos 
mother wanted it 
i though we agreed to stop using that title 
if markos really were one of the three mothers
we wouldn t be in this situation 
you should have told markos about miss bannion yourself 
now mother wants her 
are we going to waste another girl so quickly 
everyone voted 
you are not the light we chose to follow 
if markos wants this girl  you must prepare her 
  and does she 
  yes 
markos will live 
we found the girl in time 
i won t rush again 
i will tell markos when the girl is ready 
miss balfour 
alright 
did something happen 
 hmm 
 to you  during it 
n no 
did you    did you   
did you feel something there 
someone 
or just something 
what made you say that 
i don t know 
am i confusing you 
no  it s  um   
it s odd  it s the   
it s the sort of thing patricia would say 
it s bizarre 
come on 
let s get changed  or sonia will leave without us 
i ve got a dress you can wear 
double caposhi 
susie 
oh  susie 
i want to bring in a custom from the old ways 
what do you have in mind 
a witness 
one of our new friends from the police 
why not one of those young things at the window 
you re forgetting we already have a witness 
the old man who sent us the police in the first place 
he will be our winess 
yes  not one of our girls 
it would make any of them insane 
i agree
and it s good for susie to see us like this 
that we re still part of the world 
maybe she even senses what we want of her 
she senses a lot 
you can see her eyes shine with it 
i see it every night 
when i send her our dreams 
is it true 
is it true 
i know who i am 
i know who i am 
it s all right 
it s okay 
is she all right 
it s just a nightmare 
the markos company special 
i m surprised it took this long 
hey  let me know if she needs a valium 
she s right  i dreamt of hairballs in toilets
for three weeks before i got
a decent night of sleep here 
move over 
i ve only ever slept in bed with my sister 
we re sisters now 
 in a statement released to the press moments ago 
the hijacker s leader  martyrer mahmud 
demands baader  ensslin  möller and the other raf prisoners
be released from stammheim prison and flown to mogadishu  
good morning 
i d like to talk to detective glockner or detective albrecht 
  your name 
  klemperer  josef 
one moment 
    as proof of their intentions  the hijackers threw down onto the tarmac 
the body of the flights pilot jurgen schumann 
he had been shot in the head 
agent glockner s office is on the right 
have a seat there and they ll call for you 
 terror suspect  do you know this woman s name  
mr  klemperer 
please come inside 
we were shown every room
we didn t see anything worth remembering 
they are professional performers 
illusion is their craft 
it s not your place to speculate on that 
did you speak to the woman called markos 
patricia referred to her as
 mother markos  
she had a delusion about this woman leading a coven there 
she had this delusion for months
do you believe in witches  doctor 
no 
but i believe that   
people can organize themselves to
perpetrate crimes and call it magic 
that i can believe
do you understand the kind of week we are having  doctor 
detective glockner 
this isn t the first time we ve met 
you were on the police force in friedenau  weren t you 
you helped me to try to locate my wife 
your wife also went missing 
two years before the russian charge 
ankle meire  1943 
from the records  you helped me cross off poland 
i m still grateful 
and one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
that s that s okay 
do you want to do the jumps 
okay 
and   
one  and two  and three 
and one  and two  and three 
no 
elbows higher 
all right  one moment 
susie  part of the jump is muscle 
and that will develop as you condition 
but you seem to have an aversion to them 
and i don t quite see why 
are you so happy to be stuck to the earth 
there s a yield before the push 
which i don t think you re quite understanding 
caroline  could you come and do a series for us  please 
thank you 
and now you 
what i really want is to be on   
on the floor right now  anyway 
well  of course 
that s because you re mistaking physical weakness
with artistic preference 
and because you re tired 
at this point 
the jumps are opposing the pull of the structure 
but   
it s soon for that  don t you think 
the floor work is    is keeping
the other dancers pushed down 
so this   
this could echo that   
   on on a slightly higher point of elevation 
if i stay close to the ground now
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later 
then that s more to the point 
the resistance is more   
emphatic 
right 
i don t know how aware you are
of what times we lived through here 40 years ago 
out of which this piece was made 
we learned at great cost through those years
the value of the balance of things 
every arrow that flies feels the pull of the earth 
but we must aim upwards 
we need to get you in the air 
leave her  leave her  leave her  leave her  leave   
oh  caroline 
don t be afraid 
eveything will be arlight 
ja 
she hit her head hard 
i heard it  i hope   
miss  
one moment please 
i am    i m looking for a dancer from your company 
who are you looking for 
you are sara 
yes 
may i help you 
i am a friend from patricia 
 when the deadline arrived  the hijackers informed the police
they had poured all the flight s duty free alcohol over the hostages
and were set to ignite them 
but when they were told the west german government
was in the process of releasing the terrorists from stammheim prison 
they agreed to extend the deadline to after midnight  
i don t know what to make of any of this 
i know the kind of thing she was involved with 
but i can t see how any of this
could be happening inside the company 
well  she describes   
something like a revolutionary organization
in a crisis of leadership 
with markos very ill   
i live there 
i have friends there 
i don t see any evidence of this at all 
no one has ever approached me
or any of the other girls  as far as i know 
read this 
what is this 
this is patricia s diary 
mother markos 
mother meinhof 
the dance rehearsal 
political action 
these two areas in patricia s life
were of equal importance 
this is how transference happens 
how delusion is made 
delusion  sara 
is a lie that tells a truth 
 this says  witches  
 mmm 
maybe patricia s fantasies about witches 
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue 
the company s a family 
there s a lot of love there 
love and manipulation  
they    they share houses very often 
they are frequent bedfellows 
sorry  i don t see this 
eat 
eat 
only   
maybe the police  they missed something 
and patricia  she did spoke of   
whole hidden areas of the building 
actual rooms that are secret 
i don t want to be disrespectful  
i don t   but you re asking me 
 and i m telling you   
 oh  please 
it s a dance company 
we re not talking about anything else 
sara 
please  only look closer 
thank you for caring for patricia 
but i hope you don t come again 
 good night 
 good night 
sara  hurry up 
i m tired  i need the bathroom 
 good night  doll 
 good night 
she hasn t come back yet 
maybe she s seeing somebody 
part of the issue always
is not being able to see your body in space 
one angle in one mirror or on film is not enough 
movement is never mute 
it is a language 
it s a series of energetic shapes   
   written in the air
like words forming sentences 
like poems 
like prayers 
spells 
when you jump  it s not the height
but the space beneath you that matters 
every leap into the air must be a coup de foudre 
i don t understand 
a strike of lightning 
a bolt of love  in fact 
that s beautiful 
there are two things that dance can never be again 
beautiful and cheerful 
today  we need to break the nose
of every beautiful thing 
and if you re going to be a dancer 
you must learn french 
try not to worry 
blanc is working on the new approach 
how could we have known what would happen with patricia 
what we are attempting hasn t been done in living memory 
how do we know it will work at all 
if it killed that girl
it may kill any girl we try 
she is not wrong 
patricia was unwilling in the end 
blanc believes that was the reason 
we should not have forced it 
she did not want to be a vessel 
we wanted to bring her into our power
but she wanted to blow up departments stores intead 
what a fool  that girl 
when you dance the dance of another 
you make yourself in the image of its creator

predating all christian invention 
pre god  pre devil 
mother tenebrarum  mother lachrymarum
and mother suspiriorum 
darkness  tears and sighs 
i saw images of that last night 
in porcelain  these very fine things 
you can tell they have money 
patricia said that  uh  markos
claims to be one of the three 
but there is dissent amongst them 
she wrote about  markosites  and  blancites  
in internal division 
madame blanc s involved in this 
do they believe they re witches 
you can give someone your delusion  sara 
that s religion 
that was the reich 
the reich had these things 
insignia

these  mothers   yeah  they could be
code names for founding members

i don t know 
but i do know you are living with dangerous people 
patricia could still be in   
   in there 
they could be holding her 
in the building 
well  i cannot promise that the authorities
will come back to  uh  inspect a cabinet
full of porcelain after all that has happened 
but we can try 
and in the meantime  you must 
uh  take care of yourself 
perhaps you should leave 
you have somewhere you can go 
i ll figure it out 
and i think you should put this back 
or better still  you leave it here 
not good for them to know that you have it 
is anyone among you sick 
let him call for the elders of the church 
and let them pray over him 
anointing him with oil in the name of the lord 
and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick 
and the lord shall raise him up 
and if he has committed sins   
my daughter 
   they shall be forgiven him 
my last one 
she s my sin

i believe you deserve to know the truth 
your wife did try to make it south
to teplice 
she was apprehended by border guards
in the woods just outside of glashuütte 
she was then taken to theresienstadt camp 
she lived there for 20 days 
on the 11th of november  1943 
the commandant of the camp  a man named burger   
   ordered all 40 000 detained there
stand outside in the cold for a census 
hours and hours passed 
some hundreds died of exposure 
your wife had two women with her as she died 
women she had befriended 
who made her feel that she was not alone 
her final thoughts   
were of a birthday
when you took her to a concert as a surprise 
chopin and brahms 
it was the first time you held her hand 
she was cold when she died 
but she wasn t afraid 
she was thinking only of you 
of anke meier   
   of patricia hingle   
   of sara simms   
   of susanna bannion 
of all the women of your undoing   
   every memory will vanish
