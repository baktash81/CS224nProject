what else do you see 
beams  plaster  nothing 
it is with deep sadness and regret
that i have to advise you
that two hijacked planes
have crashed into the twin towers
of the world trade center   
    from what remains
of the world trade center for 9 00 
one airplane crashed into
world trade center two 
about 15 minutes later  an airplane
crashed into the second one 
about an hour later 
both of them collapsed 
associated press is reporting
that a plane or helicopter
crashed at the pentagon 
and the pentagon is being evacuated 
whether that fire is in the building itself
or outside  we have not yet confirmed 
this is a live picture of the pentagon
and an associated press reporter says
he could see the tail of a large airliner
as it plowed into the pentagon 
and that fire there in washington
continues to burn 
bastards 
    just a few minutes after that 
it wasn t very long 
you will see  it happened again 
the second tower came tumbling down 
that was the first tower collapse
that we just saw 
this is the collapse
of the second tower 
and so now  as we stand here 
both towers   
the tops of both towers are gone 
allison  let s sit outside 
behind somewhere that plume of smoke
that continues to rise over the   
he s probably still at the bus terminal 
what is left of those buildings 
we cannot tell you 
we cannot tell you

we got to pick up bianca 
both towers came down 
trapping thousands
and thousands of people inside 
we do not know the numbers yet 
but we do know thousands of people
work inside those buildings 
that    the buildings are gone 
there are reports
that hundreds and hundreds
of fire and police and rescue crews
are missing or unaccounted for 
officials seem simply stunned
by the scale of the losses   
they keep showing the same thing
over and over and over 
jay s there 
they must have called in
every company in the city 
he would have been there early 
yeah  john  too  probably 
he knows those buildings so well 
they ve seen something
no one has ever seen before 
one man who came by said
he had seen this building come down 
it looked as though it was imploding 
this was complete chaos and utter hell
that has come to lower manhattan 
oh  my god 
judy  listen to me  listen to me  look 
they evacuated those buildings

the world that we will pass this test

the human loss will be
in new york city alone 
america has changed today

within its continental borders
to devastating effect by terrorists
in a coordinated assault
using hijacked civilian airliners
