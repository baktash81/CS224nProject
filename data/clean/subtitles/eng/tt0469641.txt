what else do you see
beams plaster nothing
it is with deep sadness and regret
that i have to advise you
that two hijacked planes
have crashed into the twin towers
of the world trade center
from what remains
of the world trade center for 900
one airplane crashed into
world trade center two
about 15 minutes later an airplane
crashed into the second one
about an hour later
both of them collapsed
associated press is reporting
that a plane or helicopter
crashed at the pentagon
and the pentagon is being evacuated
whether that fire is in the building itself
or outside we have not yet confirmed
this is a live picture of the pentagon
and an associated press reporter says
he could see the tail of a large airliner
as it plowed into the pentagon
and that fire there in washington
continues to burn
bastards
just a few minutes after that
it wasnt very long
you will see it happened again
the second tower came tumbling down
that was the first tower collapse
that we just saw
this is the collapse
of the second tower
and so now as we stand here
both towers
the tops of both towers are gone
allison lets sit outside
behind somewhere that plume of smoke
that continues to rise over the
hes probably still at the bus terminal
what is left of those buildings
we cannot tell you
we cannot tell you

okay
we got to pick up bianca
both towers came down
trapping thousands
and thousands of people inside
we do not know the numbers yet
but we do know thousands of people
work inside those buildings
that the buildings are gone
there are reports
that hundreds and hundreds
of fire and police and rescue crews
are missing or unaccounted for
officials seem simply stunned
by the scale of the losses
they keep showing the same thing
over and over and over
jays there
they must have called in
every company in the city
he would have been there early
yeah john too probably
he knows those buildings so well
theyve seen something
no one has ever seen before
one man who came by said
he had seen this building come down
it looked as though it was imploding
this was complete chaos and utter hell
that has come to lower manhattan
oh my god
judy listen to me listen to me look
they evacuated those buildings

the world that we will pass this test
god bless

the government will not say where
mr bush is going or for how long
i dont know if you guys know it yet

for this mission
then find a way to listen dave
ill leave that to you
to determine just how widespread
the human loss will be
in new york city alone
america has changed today
this is a dark day in this country
its in bold print in future history books
about how america was attacked
within its continental borders
to devastating effect by terrorists
in a coordinated assault
using hijacked civilian airliners
