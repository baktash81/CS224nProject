familiar with the word
arteriosclerosis
cholesterol
if you want ill outline
a complete balanced diet for you
mail it to me from cblock
why would you eat that
why cause it tastes good
but its not good for you
im aware of that
why would you do something
if you know its not good for you
because i dont think about it
thats living in denial
living in denial
yeah
im aware of that
so youre aware of all your behavior
yet you continue to do things
that arent good for you
that sounds sort of foolish
dont you think so jack
no stealing 15 million
from jimmy serrano sounds foolish
i didnt think id get caught
now thats livin in denial
im aware of that
so youre aware of your behavior
and yet you continue to do things
that arent good for you
sounds kind of foolish to me
dont you think jon
it was foolish
but taking 15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity
was good for a lot of people
so you pissed off a mafioso killer
just to be loved
by a bunch of fuckin strangers
that makes a lot of sense
dont you want to be loved
lots of people love me
really
who
i got an exwife
and i got a daughter in chicago

of them in nine years

we should go see them
thanks for the interest though
the job must have been tough on them
i didnt do this then
what did you do
i was a cop
you were a cop in chicago

be some fuckin trip
i wouldnt worry about it jack
im not gonna be with you that much longer

shut the fuck up
did you ever have sex
with an animal jack
remember those chickens
around the indian reservation
there were some goodrankin
chickens there jack
you know between us
yeah there were a couple there
i might have taken a shot at
whats with you and that watch
what is it with the watch
you told me when you
get to know me better
you told me about your feelings
for chickens
how private could the watch be
whats the big secret
gail bought me this watch
she gave it to me
it was the first thing
she ever gave me
she uh she bought it
because i was always late
by at least a half an hour
so she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so id never be late
somewhere in the back of my mind
i keep thinking were gonna
wind up together again
i dont know why im still hanging on
im still waitin around
i dont think shes cumin back
yeah i dont either
i dont either
sometimes you just have to let go
just get yourself a new watch
youre okay jack
i think
under different circumstances
you and i
probably still wouldve
hated each other
both laugh
we probably couldve been friends
in the next life
yeah the next life
yeah great
accommodations were wonderful
you got a smoke
dont smoke
that fed took my cigarettes
you want your cigarettes back
then youre gonna have to go
to flagstaff to get em
cause thats where
your pal mosely went

where do you figure we are
my guess would be arizona
weve been goin west all night
i think were almost home
im almost dead
hey look john

protection program isnt so bad
theyll give you a new name

serranos gonna get to me before i get
to any witness protection program
do me a favor
dont pretend you care about me
it really insults my intelligence
i mean lets face it
the only important thing
about me to you
is gettin your money
you know im really tired of you
makin me out to be some kind of thug
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change
did you know that serranos people
offered me 1000000 for you
why didnt you go for the big money
youre doing his work for him anyway
im workin for him anyway
you dont know what
the fuck youre talkin about
the reason i do this shit
in the first place
is cause i wouldnt work

doesnt mean anything
serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in chicago

they dont like throw
each other off the trains
thats the purpose of having stops
whats this
what are you gonna do

its jack walsh
hold on somebody wants to say hello
hey
too late for you scumbag
no no no too late for you
i didnt come this far
not to collect my money
you understand me you motherfuckers
i want the duke back
so what the fuck
are you tellin me for
what am i tellin you for
what am i tellin you for
ill tell you what
im tellin you for
i got some of the dukes belongings
thats why
including some computer disks
that have every last detail
of serranos businesses and his
moneylaundering operations everything
and if i dont get the duke back
in the next two hours
im gonna turn those disks over
to the feds you hear me
you tell serrano
i want to meet him with the duke
alone in two hours in the main
terminal of mccarran airport
where well make the exchange
i know hes the only one
of you fucking idiots
who wont try to take a shot at me
in a public place
and if i see one fuckin single goon
within a mile of that airport
now listen to me very carefully
the deal is off
and im going to the feds
i aint gonna bother jimmy
with your bullshit
youre not okay fine fine
after hes busted
ill make sure to let him know
you knew all about it beforehand
thats two hours from now
main terminal mccarran airport
you got that moron have a nice day
tell alonzo i want to make a deal
you want to make a deal with me
what would you do
if i could deliver you serrano
what do you mean deliver
for starters conspiracy to destroy
government evidence
what government evidence
will you let me take the duke back
myself and collect my money
tell me more
ill have to tell you on the way
cause we gotta be
in las vegas in two hours
jon marvin
marvin
no its room service
here hold this up
so they know i took this today
i amaze myself im always thinking
got it all figured out
now say cheese
dont do this marvin
adios
all right
there are no real computer disks
is that right
right
so if you give him blank disks
and he accepts them would that
still be considered an overt act
if he just sets foot
inside the airport
hes committed an overt act
conspiracy to obstruct justice
when he shows up with the duke
you add kidnapping
anybody packing a gun
conspiracy to commit murder
the fact that its an airport
and alonzo correct me
if you think im wrong here
i dont want to
step on your toes
you can slap an interstate
transportation aid
or racketeering rap
on him right away as well
yeah well none of that
bullshit means anything
unless you can get him
to take those disks from you
dont worry
ill get him to take the disks
get a wire on this man
