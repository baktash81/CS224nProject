familiar with the word
 arteriosclerosis  
 cholesterol  
if you want  i ll outline
a complete balanced diet for you 
mail it to me from c block 
why would you eat that 
why   cause it tastes good 
  but it s not good for you 
  i m aware of that 
why would you do something 
if you know it s not good for you 
because i don t think about it 
that s living in denial 
  living in denial 
  yeah 
i m aware of that 
so you re aware of all your behavior
yet you continue to do things
that aren t good for you 
that sounds sort of foolish 
don t you think so  jack 
no  stealing  15 million
from jimmy serrano sounds foolish 
i didn t think i d get caught 
now  that s livin  in denial 
i m aware of that 
so you re aware of your behavior
and yet you continue to do things
that aren t good for you 
sounds kind of foolish to me 
don t you think  jon 
it was foolish 
but taking  15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity
was good for a lot of people 
so you pissed off a mafioso killer
just to be loved
by a bunch of fuckin  strangers 
that makes a lot of sense 
don t you want to be loved 
lots of people love me 
really 
who 
i got an ex wife 
and i got a daughter in chicago

we should go see them 
thanks for the interest  though 
the job must have been tough on them 
  i didn t do this then 
  what did you do 
  i was a cop 
  you were a cop in chicago 
then you must know
all about jimmy serrano 
do you have the right
to ask these sort of questions

  no  you don t 
  i think i do 
  no  you don t 
why not 
dinner s over  let s go

i wouldn t worry about it  jack 
i m not gonna be with you that much longer 
what do you mean 
with what i know about serrano 
if i go to jail i ll be dead
within 24 hours 
so sooner or later 
i m gonna have to give you the slip 
 chuckles 
glad you find it humorous

he supplied the whole city 
took me a year just
to get his confidence 
just when i was about to nail the son
of a bitch my fellow officers
mysteriously discovered seven pounds
of heroin in my house 
so this big time drug dealer
gave me a choice 
get on the payroll
like everybody else 
get out of town 
or go to jail for 30 years 
well  i didn t get on the payroll 
and that s why i do this 
when i find a criminal like you 
i bring him in

about anybody takin  a payoff
because there is no anybody 
there s just me

it seems that an agent alonzo mosely
and his partner
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near channing 
come on 
 horn sounds 
  jack 
  what 
how much further
do you think we have to go 
 imitating jack 
none of your fuckin  business 
you know  because eventually
i m gonna have to go to the bathroom 
 imitating jack 
shut the fuck up 
did you ever have sex
with an animal  jack 
remember those chickens
around the indian reservation 
there were some good rankin 
chickens there  jack 
you know  between us 
yeah  there were a couple there
i might have taken a shot at 
what s with you and that watch 
what is it with the watch 
you told me when you
get to know me better 
you told me about your feelings
for chickens 
how private could the watch be 
what s the big secret 
gail bought me this watch 
she gave it to me 
it was the first thing
she ever gave me 
she  uh    she bought it
because i was always late
by at least a half an hour 
so she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so i d never be late 
somewhere in the back of my mind
i keep thinking we re gonna
wind up together again 
i don t know why i m still hanging on 
i m still waitin  around 
i don t think she s cumin  back 
yeah  i don t either 
i don t either 
sometimes you just have to let go 
just get yourself a new watch 
you re okay  jack 
i think   
under different circumstances   
you and i   
probably still would ve
hated each other 
 both laugh 
we probably could ve been friends 
in the next life 
yeah  the next life 
yeah  great 
accommodations were wonderful 
  you got a smoke 
  don t smoke 
that fed took my cigarettes 
you want your cigarettes back 
then you re gonna have to go
to flagstaff to get  em 
 cause that s where
your pal mosely went 
 chuckles 
just might do that 
where do you figure we are 
my guess would be arizona 
we ve been goin  west all night 
i think we re almost home 
i m almost dead 
hey  look  john 
you know  the witness
protection program isn t so bad 
they ll give you a new name 
you ll have a new life 
i m not gonna make it
to any witness protection program 
  you don t know that  jon 
  i know it  you know it 
serrano s gonna get to me before i get
to any witness protection program 
do me a favor 
don t pretend you care about me 
it really insults my intelligence 
i mean  let s face it 
the only important thing
about me to you
is gettin  your money 
you know  i m really tired of you
makin  me out to be some kind of thug
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change 
did you know that serrano s people
offered me  1 000 000 for you 
why didn t you go for the big money 
you re doing his work for him anyway 
i m workin  for him anyway 
you don t know what
the fuck you re talkin  about 
the reason i do this shit
in the first place
is  cause i wouldn t work
for that lowlife asshole 
  what does that mean 
  nothin  
doesn t mean anything 
serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in chicago 
who owned your buddies
and destroyed your life 
that s serrano 
that s the guy
that you re takin  me in   
that s the guy that s gonna kill me 
hope it s a wonderful
coffee shop  jack

we are getting off here 
mr  railroad man 
  come on 
  what  what  no  come on 
  you should be good at this 
  what are you talkin  about 
come on 
let s discuss this 
  find anything 
  not yet 
they could ve jumped off the train
anywhere along the line 
trains have regularly scheduled stops 
the reason for that is  y know  because people
plan to get off the trains when they stop 
and that s how 
generally  people do it 
they don t  like  throw
each other off the trains 
that s the purpose of having stops 
what s this 
what are you gonna do 
what are you doin  now 
what are you doin  
what are you doin  
oh  christ  christ 
come on  come on 
are you kidding 
they re gonna come out
and shoot us  for christ s sake 
what the hell 
what the hell 
jesus

we came to you first  didn t we 
it s jack walsh 
hold on  somebody wants to say hello 
hey 
too late for you  scumbag 
no  no  no  too late for you 
i didn t come this far
not to collect my money 
you understand me  you motherfuckers 
i want the duke back 
so what the fuck
are you tellin  me for 
what am i tellin  you for 
what am i tellin  you for 
i ll tell you what
i m tellin  you for 
i got some of the duke s belongings 
that s why 
including some computer disks
that have every last detail
of serrano s businesses and his
money laundering operations  everything 
and if i don t get the duke back
in the next two hours
i m gonna turn those disks over
to the feds  you hear me 
you tell serrano
i want to meet him with the duke
alone in two hours in the main
terminal of mccarran airport
where we ll make the exchange 
i know he s the only one
of you fucking idiots
who won t try to take a shot at me
in a public place 
and if i see one fuckin  single goon
within a mile of that airport   
now listen to me very carefully   
   the deal is off 
and i m going to the feds 
i ain t gonna bother jimmy
with your bullshit 
you re not  okay  fine  fine 
after he s busted
i ll make sure to let him know
you knew all about it beforehand 
that s two hours from now 
main terminal  mccarran airport 
you got that  moron  have a nice day 
tell alonzo i want to make a deal 
you want to make a deal with me 
what would you do
if i could deliver you serrano 
what do you mean   deliver  
for starters  conspiracy to destroy
government evidence 
what government evidence 
will you let me take the duke back
myself and collect my money 
tell me more 
i ll have to tell you on the way
 cause we gotta be
in las vegas in two hours 
 jon   marvin 
  marvin 
  no  it s room service 
here  hold this up   
so they know i took this today 
i amaze myself  i m always thinking 
got it all figured out 
  now say   cheese  
  don t do this  marvin 
adios 
all right 
there are no real computer disks 
  is that right 
  right 
so if you give him blank disks   
and he accepts them would that
still be considered an overt act 
if he just sets foot
inside the airport
he s committed an overt act 
conspiracy to obstruct justice 
when he shows up with the duke 
you add kidnapping 
anybody packing a gun 
conspiracy to commit murder 
the fact that it s an airport 
and alonzo  correct me
if you think i m wrong here 
i don t want to
step on your toes 
you can slap an interstate
transportation aid
or racketeering rap
on him right away as well 
yeah  well none of that
bullshit means anything
unless you can get him
to take those disks from you 
don t worry 
i ll get him to take the disks 
get a wire on this man 
marvin 
no hard feelings about
what happened back in amarillo  huh 
just one of those
spur of the moment deals  you know 
  where is he 
  where s the money 
in the car  where is he 
slight change of plans 
now i want  2 million 
what 
i read the newspapers  you know 
the guy got you
for  15 million  right 
so i figure he s gotta be worth
at least  2 million 
i m a businessman 
how do we know you got him 
i want  1 million now   
and i ll call you in 20 minutes 
tell you where to drop off
the second million 
once i know it s there 
then i ll tell you where he is

  i don t think you should do this 
  oh  really 
what do you propose that i do 
send somebody with a cash offer 
but don t do this 
i know walsh
