i rented this room last night
and i think i left my disk here

when i got home
i checked my laptop
and the backup disk was gone
its the only copy i have and ive been
searching like hell for it
then i remembered the only place
i could have left it was here
so did you mind if i come in
and just take a look around
i dont think its a good idea
thank you very much
i appreciate it
thank you
oh my god i got so much information
in that disk
you didnt see a disk right
i mean actually its not a disk
its not like a cd or a dvd
or anything like that
its called floppy its a black thing
that you introduce in the computer
i am remembering now
that i put it there
cause i was working in bed
i just love to work in bed
i bet you do too
anyway let me
let just remember
exactly what i did
i sat over here
i sat over here and i put it on my lap
because its a laptop
and i just plugged it
over there and
actually you know what had happened
what happened is that i wasnt alone
i wasnt alone and then
oh my god
thats not your business
well ah no its not
its not but it is
because
excuse me
are you alright
i think i can help you
i have been working in a hospital
for a couple of years and
i was a kind of a candy striper myself
just sit down over here
give me your arms put them up
just like this and relax relax
and breathe breathe and relax
and now listen to me
good
i know because i have been accused of
having an overactive imagination
but when a classy woman
like yourself
checks into an airport hotel
in the middle of the morning
with a bunch of bullets and a gun
theres only one word that follows
what word
bang
now if a guy walks in
maybe there doesnt have
to be a bang
maybe there is something
to talk about
coffee
maybe we should have start
with some introductions
i dont care who you are
and i definitely dont want
you to know who i am
all right thats fair enough
lets call me
harry
and lets start with the shiner
whos beating you up
must we talk about this
yes
or were gonna find
the local police station
and were gonna talk
about it there
my husband
all right why
he has
difficulty to control
his temper
why does he lose it
because i cant live
with him here
why not
i have a past here
i was safe in the states
but here
it only takes one photo
like the one today
i took that picture
so harry is nicolas bardo
why did you follow me
to get more photos
no no i
i just came to tell
your security goon mr shiff
that i couldnt stop the picture
from being published im sorry
anyone can see that
youve wasted your time
this espresso is cold
can i get you another cup
why
theres nothing more to say
can i go now
you have the gun
sex shops are open all day
i dont think ill be going to one
how can i be sure
just stay with me
i need air but i dont want
to talk anymore
good
so where is she
the ambassador is
extremely worried
the police god no
keep calling shiff
right when i got divorced
i just decided to leave spain
and come here to paris to prevent
myself kind of think you know
i mean ive got these crazy
photographer ideas
and dont think for a second that
i am a paparazzi i hate them
i feel like shit but i have to make
some money thats the only way
but there is
a square here in paris
full of coffee shops beautiful
and there is one in particular
in a corner you know
with these light reflections
and i saw something
that changed my life
its a great story nicolas
this is the best part
i know i know
maybe another time
its a great story
but right now im
very tired and i would just like to
take a warm bath and relax a little
before i go home ok
thank you for today
ill be waiting out here
just in case you need anything
you dont trust me do you
no no no its not that
its just being careful
are you all right
no
im out of my medicine
there was a pharmacy in the airport
oh thats right
my inhaler is in my car
they can refill it
for me there
that wouldnt be being careful
nicolas take my car
take my purse if youre so
worried that i go somewhere
you can call a taxi
i dont
yes nicolas
i could call a taxi
but im not going to do that
im not going to need these
in the bath
hey wait
im definitely not going anywhere
without them
are you flirting with me
was i
i believe so yeah
i didnt mean to
its just that
all your boyhood stories
make you so
damn lovable
was that the point
hello is this police
madre de dios
my name is sophia
i call now from the airport
de gaulle yes de gaulle
a man just hit the lady
in front of the pharmacy
yes wait a second yes man
is still there but i see no lady
yes he steal her car
no i cant no not possible
no sorry
my husband calling me sorry
no i cant
is it your car
its not mine but
somebody lend it to me and
come in
good morning
you can put it there
could you hand me my bag
of course
its over there by the bed
i cant find it
maybe on the floor
im sorry but i dont see it
this is the gun
we found in the mercedes
any details
no its not registered
concerning the car
it belongs to the american embassy
this doesnt make much sense
im chief inspector serra
maybe you can help me out
i said it already
but ok
alright
mrs watts was trying
to kill herself
i stopped her
so she set me up for you guys
to get me out of her way
how did you come up with that
i read a lot of mysteries and i just
figure out the endings half way
i put the clues together and
i know what happened sir
what happened mr bardo
was a car belonging to ambassador
watts was found in your possession
i know i know that
on the front seat was
a gun bullets
blouse and dress
the only thing missing is the woman
where is she
i dont know i dont know
you checked out the hotel
yeah we checked the room
we found a naked waitress
in a coma
did you have anything
to do with that
no
i wasnt there
i was buying an inhaler
inhaler
yes
an inhaler all right
mrs watts has asthma
so i went to a pharmacy to get
her prescription refilled thats it
so you figured
by having her car and her clothes
she wasnt going anywhere
thats correct yeah
and you kept the gun
so she wouldnt shoot herself
thats right
why would she want to do that
excuse me
why would she want to do that
well her husband was beating her up
because she wanted to leave him
the american ambassador
beats his wife
thats right thats right yes
and she has
the face to prove it
you see
im kind of
a mystery buff myself
and you know what kind
of mystery this is
a kidnapping
oh come on
ambassadors wife held
for ransom
everything was going fine until
someone reported a stolen car
you didnt even have time
to send the ransom note
or did you
no what are you talking about
i am no kidnapper sir
why dont we take a ride
down to the residence
and see what the ambassador
has to say about that
i think this is
a terrible misunderstanding
i spoke with mrs watts
she explained to me how
she let mr bardo use her car
i dont know who reported it stolen
because it wasnt
and my attorney
mrs phillips
has indicated to me that
no crime has been committed
so im a little confused as to
what we are doing here inspector
you spoke to your wife yourself
yes i did
could i speak with her
i dont think thats necessary
this has been an awkward situation
for all of us concerned
and i really
i dont want to prolong it
mrs phillips will have to handle
your questions from now on
i have an engagement
please excuse me
inspector serra youve displayed
a boorish lack of sensitivity
towards the american ambassador
we do not need or want your
investigative skills employed
to discover why mrs watts was in
a hotel bedroom with mr bardo
i suggest you return to
your duties and drop this matter
the less said about it the better
id still like
to talk to mrs watts
and what crime has she committed
no crime i just want to see her
well im sure we all want
to see lots of people
but fortunately in our country
and in yours
they are not compelled to see us
good day inspector
sir
do you know the penalty for having
an illegal hand gun
i told you its not my gun
ok then well just keep it
now about your motorcycle
you really want to report it stolen
of course i want to report it stolen
if it wasnt at the hotel
somebody took it sir
why dont you look a little harder
if it doesnt turn up in a few days
give me a call
sir you dont believe one goddamn
thing i said right
not only dont i believe you
i dont even like you
look bardo i know who you are
expaparazzi smart ass who
hasnt worked for seven years
i dont know what youre up to
but its not smart
and if you keep it up youre going
to wind up on a cell block
full of smart guys just like you
mr watts
if you ever want
to see your wife again
bring 10 million dollars
in bearer bonds to
the passerelle debilly
at 2 am this morning
if you inform the police or arrive
with anyone besides yourself
she will be killed
oh shit

so i went back to states where i got
everything a bad girl ever wanted

he was sweet until being the richest
man in the world wasnt enough
he had to have public glory
