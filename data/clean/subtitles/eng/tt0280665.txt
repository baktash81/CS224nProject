hi  i m sorry to bother you but
i rented this room last night   
   and i think i left my disk here 
  a disk 
  when i got home   
i checked my laptop 
and the backup disk was gone 
it s the only copy i have and i ve been
searching like hell for it 
then i remembered the only place
i could have left it was    here 
so did you mind if i come in
and just take a look around 
  i don t think it s a good idea   
  thank you very much 
i appreciate it 
thank you 
oh my god  i got so much information
in that disk 
you didn t see a disk right 
i mean  actually it s not a disk 
it s not like a cd or a dvd
or anything like that   
   it s called floppy  it s a black thing
that you introduce in the computer 
i am remembering now
that i put it there   
    cause i was working in bed 
i just love to work in bed 
i bet you do too 
anyway  let me   
let just remember
exactly what i did 
i sat over here 
i sat over here and i put it on my lap 
because it s a laptop   
   and i just plugged it
over there and   
actually  you know what had happened 
what happened is that i wasn t alone 
i wasn t alone and then   
oh my god 
that s not your business 
well  ah    no  it s not 
it s not but it is 
because   
excuse me   
are you alright 
i think i can help you 
i have been working in a hospital
for a couple of years and   
i was a kind of a candy striper myself 
just sit down over here 
give me your arms  put them up 
just like this and    relax  relax 
and breathe  breathe and relax 
and now listen to me 
good 
i know  because i have been accused of
having an overactive imagination   
   but when a classy woman
like yourself   
   checks into an airport hotel 
in the middle of the morning   
   with a bunch of bullets and a gun 
there s only one word that follows 
what word 
 bang  
now  if a guy walks in   
   maybe there doesn t have
to be a  bang  
maybe there is something
to talk about 
coffee 
maybe we should have start
with some introductions 
i don t care who you are 
and i definitely don t want
you to know who i am 
all right  that s fair enough 
let s call me   
 harry    
   and let s start with the shiner 
who s beating you up 
  must we talk about this 
  yes 
or we re gonna find
the local police station   
   and we re gonna talk
about it there 
  my husband 
  all right  why 
he has   
   difficulty to control
his temper 
why does he lose it 
because i can t live
with him here 
  why not 
  i have a past here 
i was safe in the states
but here   
   it only takes one photo   
like the one today 
i took that picture 
so  harry  is nicolas bardo 
why did you follow me 
to get more photos 
no  no  i   
i just came to tell
your security goon  mr  shiff   
   that i couldn t stop the picture
from being published  i m sorry 
anyone can see that 
you ve wasted your time 
this espresso is cold 
  can i get you another cup 
  why 
there s nothing more to say 
can i go now

i need air but i don t want
to talk anymore 
good   
so where is she 
the ambassador is
extremely worried

right when i got divorced 
i just decided to leave spain   
   and come here to paris to prevent
myself    kind of think  you know

photographer ideas   
   and don t think for a second that
i am a paparazzi  i hate them 
i feel like shit but i have to make
some money  that s the only way   
but    there is
a square here in paris   
   full of coffee shops  beautiful 
and there is one in particular   
   in a corner  you know 
with these light reflections   
   and i saw something
that changed my life   
  it s a great story  nicolas 
  this is the best part 
i know  i know 
maybe another time 
it s a great story
but right now i m   
   very tired and i would just like to
take a warm bath and relax a little   
   before i go home  ok 
thank you for today 
i ll be waiting out here   
just in case you need anything   
  you don t trust me  do you

  i m out of my medicine 
  there was a pharmacy in the airport

i m sorry but i don t see it 
this is the gun
we found in the mercedes 
  any details 
  no  it s not registered 
concerning the car   
it belongs to the american embassy 
this doesn t make much sense 
i m chief inspector serra 
maybe you can help me out 
i said it already 
but  ok 
alright 
mrs  watts was trying
to kill herself 
i stopped her   
   so she set me up for you guys 
to get me out of her way 
how did you come up with that 
i read a lot of mysteries and i just
figure out the endings half way   
i put the clues together and
i know what happened  sir 
what happened  mr  bardo   
   was a car belonging to ambassador
watts was found in your possession 
i know  i know that   
on the front seat was
a gun  bullets   
   blouse and dress 
the only thing missing is the woman 
where is she 
i don t know  i don t know   
  you checked out the hotel 
  yeah  we checked the room 
we found a naked waitress
in a coma 
did you have anything
to do with that 
no 
i wasn t there 
i was buying an inhaler 
inhaler 
yes   
an inhaler  all right 
mrs  watts has asthma 
so i went to a pharmacy to get
her prescription refilled  that s it 
so  you figured   
   by having her car and her clothes 
she wasn t going anywhere 
that s correct  yeah 
and you kept the gun
so she wouldn t shoot herself 
that s right 
why would she want to do that 
  excuse me 
  why would she want to do that 
well  her husband was beating her up
because she wanted to leave him 
the american ambassador
beats his wife 
that s right  that s right  yes 
and she has
the face to prove it   
you see   
i m kind of
a mystery buff myself 
and you know what kind
of mystery this is 
  a kidnapping 
  oh come on 
ambassador s wife held
for ransom 
everything was going fine until
someone reported a stolen car 
you didn t even have time
to send the ransom note   
   or did you 
  no  what are you talking about 
i am no kidnapper  sir 
why don t we take a ride
down to the residence   
   and see what the ambassador
has to say about that 
i think this is
a terrible misunderstanding 
i spoke with mrs  watts   
   she explained to me how
she let mr  bardo use her car 
i don t know who reported it stolen
because it wasn t 
and my attorney 
mrs  phillips   
   has indicated to me that
no crime has been committed   
   so i m a little confused as to
what we are doing here  inspector 
  you spoke to your wife yourself 
  yes  i did 
  could i speak with her 
  i don t think that s necessary 
this has been an awkward situation
for all of us concerned   
   and i really   
i don t want to prolong it 
mrs  phillips will have to handle
your questions from now on 
i have an engagement 
please excuse me 
inspector serra  you ve displayed
a boorish lack of sensitivity   
towards the american ambassador 
we do not need or want your
investigative skills employed   
   to discover why mrs  watts was in
a hotel bedroom with mr  bardo 
i suggest you return to
your duties and drop this matter 
the less said about it the better 
i d still like
to talk to mrs  watts 
  and what crime has she committed 
  no crime  i just want to see her 
well  i m sure we all want
to see lots of people   
   but fortunately in our country
and in yours   
   they are not compelled to see us 
good day  inspector 
sir 
do you know the penalty for having
an illegal hand gun 
  i told you  it s not my gun 
  ok  then we ll just keep it 
now  about your motorcycle   
  you really want to report it stolen 
  of course i want to report it stolen 
if it wasn t at the hotel 
somebody took it  sir 
why don t you look a little harder 
if it doesn t turn up in a few days 
give me a call 
sir  you don t believe one goddamn
thing i said  right 
not only don t i believe you 
i don t even like you 
look  bardo  i know who you are 
ex paparazzi smart ass who
hasn t worked for seven years 
i don t know what you re up to
but it s not smart 
and if you keep it up  you re going
to wind up on a cell block   
   full of smart guys just like you 
 mr  watts   
   if you ever want
to see your wife again   
   bring 10 million dollars   
   in bearer bonds to
the passerelle debilly   
   at 2 a m  this morning 
if you inform the police or arrive
with anyone besides yourself   
   she will be killed

so i went back to states where i got
everything a bad girl ever wanted 
fucking watts 
he was sweet  until being the richest
man in the world wasn t enough 
he had to have public glory 
so he gave away
a ton of money   
   bought himself
the french ambassadorship 
which meant the misses got dragged out
into the parisian limelight 
well  i couldn t do that nicolas   
    cause bad people
