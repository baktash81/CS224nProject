steve on tv now to space news
oh
steve boy you dont hear that enough
lisa chuckles
well privately funded company
mission mars has announced
its final candidates in a race
to colonize the planet
thats right steve
the incredibly ambitious
perhaps impossible goal
of the program
is to get humans
on mars by 2028
decades ahead of nasa
spacex and virgin galactic
mission mars believes they can
by making it a oneway journey
thereby cutting in half the
supplies needed for a round trip
hmm youre saying theres no return
yes
lisa colonists will bid
farewell to their friends
family and lives here
to participate
youd hope youd like your coworkers
laughs
lisa
oh fingers crossed
who would volunteer to move
to a place so uninhabitable
its atmosphere and temperatures
would kill you in an instant
alex mcallister
who i spoke to earlier
alex do you really plan
to leave earth forever
alex on tv without a second thought
lisa im very excited
lisa but can you even
grasp what youre giving up
youre relinquishing
your whole life to this program
well i think some people
may see it as giving up a life
whereas i see it
as choosing a new one
lisa hm
great he seems like hes in a cult
no he
if you have kids up there
are they martians
you know i su
i suppose they would be
lisa laughs

mars
i ironically dont have
a template for that
but we could just start
with our standard form
um okay
why are you going
you know
no one ever asks me that
i am
uh because its mars
and
oh and and we know next to nothing about the universe
and were not gonna figure it out
from here we have to explore
you know if we get to mars
maybe well find some answers
gentle music
inhales
i know it sounds crazy
but walking on the moon also
seemed impossible until it happened
everything that we know
everything that makes us great
was once an insane idea
it doesnt sound insane
when you say it like that
and plus were not gonna be
able to live here much longer
gonna have to start
looking at other options
i mean weve completely
destroyed this planet
and back to grim reality
did you just move here
its a small town
yeah i did
why
clicks tongue
sometimes you wake up with this burning
desire to be an insurance salesman
and youll do anything
to make that dream a reality
i wanted to be a swimmer
what happened
smacks lips
a lot of other people did too
hmm im a terrible swimmer
then at least ill beat you

do you still swim
clicks tongue never
but it was your life
yep and now its not
instrumental music
inhales well it always helps
to remember that
were just living on a rock
hurtling through space
and our meaningless existence
can end at any moment
doesnt it keep me
warm at night
chuckles sorry
im gonna give a talk
to the kids here next week
about space can i come
why
maybe i wanna learn more
about my meaningless existence
okay
sure yeah
then you should come
shes just doing my insurance
a woman named martha
does my insurance
have you heard me talk about her
no
yeah thats cause
martha is a hoarder
who dresses like
she died on the titanic
hm
you gotta take these opportunities
when they fall in your lap bro
its not like that
make it like that
chuckles
bright instrumental music
no no no no
do not let colin do it
hell try and poach
the entire
okay look ill type something

im not losing that account
okay
line disconnects
clears throat
whats peter doing here
i asked him
to appraise the farm
get him off my property
when hes done
i told you im not selling
yeah i know and i think
you should reconsider
well its not your farm
elizabeth
you dont get to make the call
dad you cant keep
going like this
youre working yourself
to the bone
im fine i have dimitri
really hes not enough
sighs alex helps
only when hes not off
pretending to board spaceships
mom cant even finish a bouquet
how are profits
without uh flower design
this isnt sustainable dad
you should be retired
ill retire
when i hand the farm over
over to whom
look i know
you had a plan before
but you dont have
a successor anymore
you need a new plan
maybe seeing some figures will help
its not about the money liz
well youre not exactly handing
over the byzantine empire okay
theyre just flowers they dont do
anything they dont really matter
im afraid were gonna have
to agree to disagree there
how can you
even stand to be here
hes everywhere
im not selling
it will go to a developer
and if we continue down that
path there will be no farms left
well have to import even more
from halfway around the globe
no liz we
we gotta hold on to our farms
this is our spot
its our little corner
of the world
and im not giving it up
send peter home
dont you dare
show me the value
sighs
exhales
for 210 days
im gonna travel there in this
and then this will be my home
this is where
ill work explore
marry pioneer
and die
mars is where ill die
and this is for children
yeah
and you must end on dying
that is how it ends
but you really want to bring
that up to first graders
second graders
maybe you should talk more of space adventures
like discovering aliens
or or or racing rovers
oh oh oh
playing basketball
thats space jam
ah yes
i do not think
they would realize this though
but thats not real dimitri
sighs well this is
not yet real either
but it will be
thats the difference
let me see it again claps
sighs
so theyre sending you to mars
but they only care
about my medical opinion
i dont usually work for nasa
well you were approved
how i deal in flu shots
and diaper rash
you need the kind of doctor that
doesnt have these on their desk
well i i mean how do you know
that nasa doesnt have lollipops
some wild guess
okay
just the standard physical
great
it will be easy you know
you still disease free
mmhmm
open close
thermometer beeps
any alcohol or drug habits
uhuh
hmm you know they didnt
even ask for a tb test
they have one of those just to move countries
thermometer beeps
im sure they will at at some
point down the line though
hmm
oh your joints are fit for space travel
great
ten years might be a whole other story
right
oh im im ill be
all right im keeping fit
hows your mental health
its fine
no you dont get
to decide that
just how are you feeling
fantastic
you willing to see
a psychologist to confirm that
nah
so youre asking me to sign off
on your psych evaluation as well
yep
hmm
children giggling  its
nice of you to support him
i wanna make sure he doesnt
say anything unhinged
this is so irresponsible
theyre children
bell rings
hes not telling them
unicorns exist lizzie
hmm
oh just in time there he is
chuckles im so proud of you
this is such a good thing
that youre doing
this is so good
ah youre on vacation
uh well sometimes inferior
colleagues use that as an opportunity
to attempt coups
on your accounts
okay
so when im with my clients
i tell them
to stick to the story
hm
and your story is space
not you in space
because thats a hypothetical
but space
but im going to space
do you think we could just keep it
to whats real right now though
are we paying you for this
could you please
just teach them facts
and when you have a shuttle
and a launch date
you can come back
and tell them about the mission
yeah sure
liz what are you looking at
well someone might come
yeah it is how hallways work
no someone i invited
okay focus
alex exhales

you are going to be the sun
the center of our solar system
everybody orbits around you
hi

youre gonna be the stars
in the milky way galaxy
now there are billions
and billions of you
so imagine
elizabeth take the star
and thats the solar system
indistinct chatter
mouths hi
mouths hi
okay well theres 100 billion
stars in the milky way galaxy
and theres maybe 10 trillion
galaxies in the universe
if you multiply that by 100
billion you get an extremely rough
probably low estimate for
the amount of stars that exist
which is
its a 1 with 24 zeros after it
we make the mistake of thinking
that the universe is for us
but its not its
its
okay new rule
every time you mention how
meaningless our existence is
im gonna need another drink
and you have to join me
right
come on

alexander the great

after historical figures
elizabeth thomas alexander

the queen and the inventor
alex
yep
thats like not too much
to live up to
oh no not at all
he had just conquered
half the known world

calm instrumental music
heavy breathing
exhales
sighs
jeff that was the first
rain weve had in a month
liz great uh have you
looked into this mars company
if youre gonna follow me
around at least help
well if youre gonna refuse to sell
at least prepare for the drought
how am i supposed
to do that grunts
for one switch
to droughtresistant varieties
get a more efficient
irrigation system
and next year
only irrigate half the land
half the land half the profits
yeah well youre losing
half the crops regardless
if you dont have enough water
which you wont
grunts oh
its a bad time to invest
in drip irrigation then
liz actually its the perfect
time while we still have reserves
so you think this mars thing
might be a scam
what do you think
i should show you something
come on
how long does he spend on this
hours
you know what this is right
its a very sophisticated version
of the machine that they built
for the science fair that year
we had a really bad dry season
oh man
dad what are we gonna do
hes given up on his career
hes building machines
for another planet
hes spending all of his money
on merchandise
hes been to see dr olsen
what for what
his space physical
okay well then she knows
that hes insane
we have to go see her
maybe she can help
ah
look i know it seems harmless now
but what if it progresses
what if we could have helped
and we didnt
sighs
you cant tell your mother
okay ill get the car
doctorpatient confidentiality

this is different its alex
a patient
youve told me about him before
yes when he was a child
sue i know its breaking protocol
the law
well were concerned
doesnt mean
im gonna break the law
well i am not leaving
what if i break out
one of these
are your immunizations
up to date
oh sometimes at night
i still hear screams
from your measles shot
okay give us the information
and you can give me
the tetanus booster
your brother is not crazy
he probably has
a slight delusion but
you yourself were once convinced
you were a wizard
i was ten
this is dangerous
no it is not
so far hes just
hes just living out a fantasy
what matters is
it has given him a purpose
wouldnt a job
do the same thing
do you know how many
mensa members are unemployed
more than you think
what you have is an exceptionally
intelligent son jeff
those types often have
the hardest time coping
maybe this is just something
he has to do
okay well what about the fact
that its space
he and tom were obsessed
im sure it plays a part
but what would you
have me say to him
right would he even listen
we all have our distractions
you have looked at that phone
ten times since you walked in
notification chimes
sighs clears throat
did you ever see the therapist
that i recommended
scoffs i dont have time

how to make it work
on mars
alex exactly

some sprouting on the moon
so i just need to account for
the lack of atmosphere
gravity radiation
this could go to nasa
i mean it alex
this this could be your thing
theyre just
seeds
its the survival part
i mean you could send this to
the rhode island space consortium
and you could get funding
and a team and everything
uh i dont think

um anyways they could
probably use this inside
