  yep

what does he do

using martian soil 
but martian soil is useless now 
that s what
i m trying to find out 
the winters in russia

it is impossible to grow plants 
but somehow life finds a way 
that is from jurassic park

open a window 
 coughs 
  still need you  dimitri 
   coughs 
  i   
  all right 
  steve on tv  now to space news 
  oh 
  steve  boy  you don t hear that enough 
  lisa chuckles 
well  privately funded company
mission mars has announced
its final candidates in a race
to colonize the planet 
that s right  steve 
the incredibly ambitious 
perhaps impossible goal
of the program
is to get humans
on mars by 2028   
decades ahead of nasa 
spacex  and virgin galactic 
mission mars believes they can
by making it a one way journey 
thereby cutting in half the
supplies needed for a round trip 
  hmm  you re saying there s no return 
  yes 
 lisa  colonists will bid
farewell to their friends 
family and lives here
to participate 
  you d hope you d like your coworkers 
  laughs 
 lisa 
oh  fingers crossed 
who would volunteer to move
to a place so uninhabitable 
its atmosphere and temperatures
would kill you in an instant 
alex mcallister 
who i spoke to earlier 
alex  do you really plan
to leave earth forever 
 alex on tv  without a second thought 
lisa  i m very excited 
 lisa  but can you even
grasp what you re giving up 
you re relinquishing
your whole life to this program 
well  i think some people
may see it as giving up a life 
whereas i see it
as choosing a new one 
  lisa  hm 
  great  he seems like he s in a cult 
no  he   
if you have kids up there 
are they martians 
you know  i su   
i suppose they would be 
   lisa laughs 
   alex laughs  whistles 
  lisa  whoo  it takes all kinds 
  alex  it does

 calm instrumental music 
  phone ringing    mutters indistinctly   
  come team to mission control 
  mr  mcallister   gasps 
  oh

you greet people 
only when i m trying
to make a good impression 
okay  well  i m daisy  and i m
going to be handling your insurance 
oh  okay  where s mike 
he asked me to sit down
with you  i hope that s okay 
ye    yeah  yeah  a    absolutely

 phone ringing
in the background 
what can i do for you 
mr  mcallister 
  oh  alex 
  alex 
uh  i need
a life insurance policy 
okay  what s the purpose 
  i m going to mars 
   chuckles  okay 
so  we ll just need our
interplanetary template then 
great 
 chuckles 
  mars 
  yes 
  how 
  the mission mars space program 
okay  wow  all right 
mars 
mars 
i ironically don t have
a template for that 
but we could just start
with our standard form 
um  okay 
why are you going 
you know 
no one ever asks me that 
i am 
uh  because it s mars 
  and 
  oh  and  and we know next to nothing about the universe 
and we re not gonna figure it out
from here  we have to explore 
you know  if we get to mars 
maybe we ll find some answers 
 gentle music 
 inhales 
i know it sounds crazy   
but walking on the moon also
seemed impossible until it happened 
everything that we know 
everything that makes us great
was once an insane idea 
it doesn t sound insane
when you say it like that 
and plus  we re not gonna be
able to live here much longer 
gonna have to start
looking at other options 
i mean  we ve completely
destroyed this planet 
and back to grim reality 
did you just move here 
it s a small town 
yeah  i did 
  why 
   clicks tongue 
sometimes you wake up with this burning
desire to be an insurance salesman 
and you ll do anything
to make that dream a reality 
i wanted to be a swimmer 
what happened 
 smacks lips 
a lot of other people did too 
hmm  i m a terrible swimmer 
then at least i ll beat you 
 chuckles 
 door creaks 
i  uh  i may have some follow up
questions if that s okay 
um  y    yeah 
got any plans tonight 
i m studying the composition
of martian dirt 
me too 
  i m just kidding  i m just watching tv 
 chuckles    mutters 
well  h    have a swell night 
  hey  how did it go 
   blake  here he comes 
   gun popping 
   alex  ah 
 daisy 
is he for real 
he s always been a little odd 
listen  we can t insure him
if this is nonsense 
but his family s been a part of
the community for generations 
and  frankly  they ve had
a rough time recently 
we owe it to them
to look into it 
i know it s not part of your job
description  but do you think   
  no  i ll do it 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  all right  good night 
night 
 gentle instrumental music 
 sighs 
 low tractor whirring 
 bright instrumental music 
 bird tweeting 
 dimitri  she s saying
when you say her name 
she will run through
the flames to you 
peace will prevail 
there will be peace
because you said her name 
and fire   speaks in russian 
peace and fire 
 indistinct conversation 
 whispers  it s the girl 
  wow  this is beautiful 
   chuckles 
  hi

   chuckles 
  hello 
 alex 
hi

thank you 
well  uh  sorry to just show up 
i just had
a couple more questions 
and you didn t leave
a phone number 
i don t have a phone 
part of preparing for isolation 
 chuckles 
right  of course  isolation 
well  we can underwrite
a policy 
but since this is
such a unique situation 
i just need a couple more details
so i can come up with a plan 
okay  i m actually heading
somewhere right now 
   alex  i m late for something 
  oh  okay 
it s just a  a local
first aid course at the school 
  dimitri usually helps me out with it 
  can t tonight 
so busy   chuckles 
all of the plans 
um  but you  you could come
if you want  i mean  it would answer
some of your questions probably 
you re learning first aid
for space 
yes  just locally at the moment 
but they ll put us through a full
training course later down the line 
right 
 gentle instrumental music

 sighs  then  say

  laughs 
 renee

 gasps  is this an art room 
sorry  i thought we d be tying
bandages or something 
yeah  you said that

nice 
really  i thought
you would be more quantitative 
math and science 
yeah  don t get me wrong 
i was great at those 
 alex mumbles 
all right 
do you still swim 
 clicks tongue  never 
but it was your life 
yep  and now it s not 
 instrumental music 
 inhales  well  it always helps
to remember that
we re just living on a rock 
hurtling through space 
and our meaningless existence
can end at any moment 
doesn t it keep me
warm at night 
 chuckles  sorry 
i m gonna give a talk
to the kids here next week 
about space  can i come 
why 
maybe i wanna learn more
about my meaningless existence 
okay 
sure  yeah 
then you should come 
she s just doing my insurance 
a woman named martha
does my insurance 
  have you heard me talk about her 
  no 
yeah  that s  cause
martha is a hoarder
who dresses like
she died on the titanic 
  hm 
  you gotta take these opportunities
when they fall in your lap  bro 
it s not like that 
make it like that 
 chuckles 
 bright instrumental music 
no  no  no  no 
do not let colin do it 
he ll try and poach
the entire   
okay  look  i ll type something
up tonight  and you re gonna say
that you did it because i m 
i m not losing that account 
okay 
 line disconnects 
   clears throat 
  what s peter doing here 
i asked him
to appraise the farm 
  get him off my property 
  when he s done 
i told you i m not selling 
yeah  i know  and i think
you should reconsider 
well  it s not your farm 
elizabeth 
you don t get to make the call 
dad  you can t keep
going like this 
you re working yourself
to the bone 
i m fine  i have dimitri 
really  he s not enough 
 sighs  alex helps 
only when he s not off
pretending to board spaceships 
mom can t even finish a bouquet 
how are profits
without  uh  flower design 
this isn t sustainable  dad 
you should be retired 
i ll retire
when i hand the farm over 
over to whom 
look  i know
you had a plan before 
but you don t have
a successor anymore 
you need a new plan 
  maybe seeing some figures will help 
  it s not about the money  liz 
well  you re not exactly handing
over the byzantine empire  okay 
they re just flowers  they don t do
anything  they don t really matter 
i m afraid we re gonna have
to agree to disagree there 
how can you
even stand to be here 
he s everywhere 
i m not selling 
it will go to a developer 
and if we continue down that
path  there will be no farms left 
we ll have to import even more
from halfway around the globe 
no  liz  we 
we gotta hold on to our farms 
this is our spot 
it s our little corner
of the world   
and i m not giving it up 
send peter home 
don t you dare
show me the value 
 sighs 
 exhales 
for 210 days 
i m gonna travel there in this 
and then  this will be my home 
this is where
i ll work  explore 
marry  pioneer   
and die 
mars is where i ll die 
and this is for children 
yeah 
and you must end on dying 
that is how it ends 
but you really want to bring
that up to first graders 
  second graders 
  maybe you should talk more of space adventures 
like discovering aliens 
or  or  or racing rovers 
oh  oh  oh 
playing basketball 
that s space jam 
ah  yes 
i do not think
they would realize this though 
but that s not real  dimitri 
 sighs  well  this is
not yet real either 
but it will be 
that s the difference 
let me see it again   claps 
 sighs 
so  they re sending you to mars 
but they only care
about my medical opinion 
i don t usually work for nasa 
well  you were approved 
how  i deal in flu shots
and diaper rash 
you need the kind of doctor that
doesn t have these on their desk 
well  i  i mean  how do you know
that nasa doesn t have lollipops 
some wild guess 
okay 
just the standard physical 
great 
it will be easy  you know 
  you still disease free 
  mm hmm 
open  close 
 thermometer beeps 
  any alcohol or drug habits 
  uh uh 
hmm  you know  they didn t
even ask for a tb test 
  they have one of those just to move countries 
  thermometer beeps 
i m sure they will at  at some
point down the line though 
hmm 
  oh  your joints are fit for space travel 
  great 
  ten years might be a whole other story 
  right 
oh  i m  i m    i ll be
all right  i m keeping fit 
  how s your mental health 
  it s fine 
no  you don t get
to decide that 
just how are you feeling 
fantastic 
you willing to see
a psychologist to confirm that 
nah 
so you re asking me to sign off
on your psych evaluation as well 
  yep 
  hmm 
  children giggling    it s
nice of you to support him 
i wanna make sure he doesn t
say anything unhinged 
this is so irresponsible 
  they re children 
   bell rings 
he s not telling them
unicorns exist  lizzie 
hmm 
oh  just in time  there he is 
 chuckles  i m so proud of you 
this is such a good thing
that you re doing 
this is so good 
ah  you re on vacation 
uh  well  sometimes inferior
colleagues use that as an opportunity
to attempt coups
on your accounts 
okay 
so when i m with my clients 
i tell them
to stick to the story 
  hm 
  and your story is space 
not you in space 
because that s a hypothetical 
but space 
but i m going to space 
do you think we could just keep it
to what s real right now though 
are we paying you for this 
could you  please 
just teach them facts 
and when you have a shuttle
and a launch date 
you can come back
and tell them about the mission 
yeah  sure 
   liz  what are you looking at 
  well  someone might come
  yeah  it is how hallways work 
  no  someone i invited 
okay  focus 
 alex exhales 
all right 
i  i heard you guys were
learning about the solar system 
 kid 1 whispers 
this is making me sleepy 
 yawns 
 kid 2 whispers 
can i get out of this class 
um  you guys
got a favorite planet 
   kid 3  stupid planets 
   kid 4  this is so boring 
 mellow music 
how about this  everybody up 
 sighs  all right  wow 
we re just gonna
have you sit over there 
okay 
okay  blake  if you could go
to the center of the room 
you are going to be the sun 
the center of our solar system 
everybody orbits around you 
hi 
could you stand near blake 
now  you are
going to be mercury 
it only takes you
88 days to orbit blake 
so you re gonna be
moving kinda quickly
like this 
   kid 5  only 88 days 
  perfect 
  who wants to be venus 
  me  me  me 
you  great  up 
okay  so you are
second closest to the sun
and the brightest planet  okay 
you re gonna orbit like that 
 all chuckling 
  now  who would like to be earth 
  i do 
every time you go
all the way around blake 
it has been an entire year 
louie  you re gonna
be the moon  okay 
you re going to orbit earth 
now  go 
fantastic 
 children chuckling 
mars  mars  mars  mars 
okay  mars is where
we ll live in the future 
  mm hmm 
  okay  let s go 
  you guys getting dizzy yet 
   all  no 
if everyone else could just come
and surround our planets 
you re gonna be the stars
in the milky way galaxy 
now  there are billions
and billions of you 
  so imagine   
  elizabeth  take the star 
and that s the solar system 
 indistinct chatter 
 mouths  hi 
 mouths  hi 
okay  well  there s 100 billion
stars in the milky way galaxy 
and there s maybe 10 trillion
galaxies in the universe 
if you multiply that by 100
billion  you get an extremely rough 
probably low estimate for
the amount of stars that exist 
which is 
it s a 1 with 24 zeros after it 
we make the mistake of thinking
that the universe is for us 
but it s not  it s   
  it s   
  okay  new rule 
every time you mention how
meaningless our existence is 
i m gonna need another drink 
and you have to join me 
  right 
  come on 
right  uh   
 upbeat music playing
over speakers 
 chuckles 
 alex  it    uh  oh  gosh 
it s right    no  i have it 
  i had it  um   
  okay 
 blowing air 
  dais 
  no

 laughs  okay

which is 
alexander the great 
really 
yeah  we were named
after historical figures 
elizabeth  thomas  alexander 
so the conqueror 
the queen  and the inventor 
 alex 
yep 
that s  like  not too much
to live up to 
oh  no  not at all 
he had just conquered
half the known world
by the time he was 32 
so  you ve got time 
i mean  he didn t go to mars 
it was not like they could fathom
that there were even other planets 
  you can t   
  all right  bartender 
  bar   
   lightning crashes 
  oh  wow

of the rain 
  woman 1  i ll see you later    woman
2  nah  just like that is fine 
at least you won t have to worry
about rain on mars  whoa 
no  just solar flares that cause storms
that lasts for hundreds of years 
okay  when i said
i didn t need you
to walk me home 
i meant literally 
it s so close 
this is a building site 
it is rustic 
and mike is fixing it up 
well  have a slow night 
that is funny   chuckles

 calm instrumental music 
 heavy breathing 
 exhales 
 sighs 
 jeff  that was the first
rain we ve had in a month 
 liz  great  uh  have you
looked into this mars company 
if you re gonna follow me
around  at least help 
well  if you re gonna refuse to sell 
at least prepare for the drought 
how am i supposed
to do that   grunts 
for one  switch
to drought resistant varieties 
get a more efficient
irrigation system 
and next year 
only irrigate half the land 
half the land  half the profits 
yeah  well  you re losing
half the crops regardless 
if you don t have enough water 
which you won t 
 grunts  oh 
it s a bad time to invest
in drip irrigation then 
 liz  actually  it s the perfect
time while we still have reserves 
so you think this mars thing
might be a scam 
what do you think 
i should show you something 
come on 
  how long does he spend on this 
  hours 
you know what this is  right 
it s a very sophisticated version
of the machine that they built
for the science fair that year
we had a really bad dry season 
oh  man 
dad  what are we gonna do 
he s given up on his career 
he s building machines
for another planet 
he s spending all of his money
on merchandise 
he s been to see dr  olsen 
what  for what 
his space physical 
okay  well  then she knows
that he s insane 
we have to go see her 
maybe she can help 
  ah 
  look  i know it seems harmless now 
but what if it progresses 
what if we could have helped
and we didn t 
 sighs 
you can t tell your mother 
okay  i ll get the car 
doctor patient confidentiality
means what it sounds like it means 
  this is different  it s alex 
  a patient 
you ve told me about him before 
yes  when he was a child 
  sue  i know it s breaking protocol 
  the law 
well  we re concerned 
doesn t mean
i m gonna break the law 
well  i am not leaving 
what if i break out
one of these 
are your immunizations
up to date 
oh  sometimes at night 
i still hear screams
from your measles shot 
okay  give us the information 
and you can give me
the tetanus booster 
your brother is not crazy 
he probably has
a slight delusion  but   
you yourself were once convinced
you were a wizard 
i was ten 
  this is dangerous 
  no  it is not 
so far he s just 
he s just living out a fantasy 
what matters is 
it has given him a purpose 
wouldn t a job
do the same thing 
do you know how many
mensa members are unemployed 
more than you think 
what you have is an exceptionally
intelligent son  jeff 
those types often have
the hardest time coping 
maybe this is just something
he has to do 
okay  well  what about the fact
that it s space 
he and tom were obsessed 
i m sure it plays a part 
but what would you
have me say to him 
right  would he even listen 
we all have our distractions 
you have looked at that phone
  ten times since you walked in 
   notification chimes 
 sighs  clears throat 
did you ever see the therapist
that i recommended 
   scoffs  i don t have time 
   notification chimes 
   phone keys clacking

 chuckles  yeah

 renee 
patients  begin choking 
   whispers  okay  that was   
   choking 
  lifesavers  start your saving

  chokes    what  um    you re

   sighs 
 grunts  don t kill me 
 panting 
 bright instrumental music 
   timer beeps

yesterday you were
28 seconds faster

 whistling 
  liz  i didn t know you could do that 
  gasps  exhales 
  well  it was nice 
  thank you   exhales 
you re gonna help me install

or you re gonna be
my nemesis forever 
  wh   
  it s a drip irrigation system 
that your father
doesn t know you re installing 
correct 
okay  yes 
i m more scared of you 
good choice 
 gentle instrumental music 
 alex  they re not some
magical forest thing 
like  they re not fairies 
 chuckles  but today is the day
when most of them are out 
come on  we re almost there 
how s living with your family 
we used to get along better 
so did mine 
what happened 
my parents were really 
really good coaches
who suddenly didn t have
anyone to coach 
just me 
   sighs 
  what about yours 
um   
 sighs 
there was an accident   
not long ago  that   
that did it 
my brother saved my life 
sounds like a pretty great
big brother 
yeah

he was 
 clears throat 
are you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
i m    fine 
it s just hot 
 exhales 
so where  where is this
bug family reunion then 
 chuckles 
they re still setting up 
  dj was late  you know how it is 
  both laugh 
  ah 
   chuckles  did you kill it 
  no 
  then where is it 
i don t know 
oh  wait 
he s fine 
that s not the same one 
 both laughing 
wow 
wow 
 chuckles 
you realize you re getting joy
from a bug s ass lighting up 
oh  come on  so are you 
no  i m not 
yes  you are 
watch them pretty  pretty butts 
 chuckles 
now  how could you think
about giving all this up 
 calm instrumental music 
 crickets chirping 
 owl hooting 
we re calling it
the mars grover 
no  we re not doing that 
  uh huh 
  well  that sounds good 
anyway  this is how the world
will work in the future
as it gets hotter and drier 
underground 
self sustaining farms 
they already have one working in
an old tube station in london 
i just have to figure out
how to make it work 
  on mars 
   alex  exactly 
so the international
space station
has some seeds growing 
uh  they even have
some sprouting on the moon 
so  i just need to account for
the lack of atmosphere 
gravity  radiation 
this could go to nasa 
i mean it  alex 
this  this could be your thing 
they re just
  seeds 
  it s the survival part 
i mean  you could send this to
the rhode island space consortium 
and you could get funding
and a team and everything 
uh  i don t think
it d be ready for that 
um  anyways  they could
probably use this inside 
 indistinct chatter 
 jane 
oh  this looks amazing 
  dimitri  could you take the potatoes  please

   alex  thank you 
you re  uh  you re not an
investigative reporter  are you

   alex sighs 
   liz  daisy  you get it 
yeah  i mean  it s all right 
  i m not a reporter 
   sighs 
that s great 
 liz 
although crossed arms are
  a sign of defense 
  i mean  really 
elizabeth  who wouldn t be
defensive under this interrogation 
i am just looking out

well  i mean  you run a pr firm 
alex is about to conquer space

 jane 
i certainly hope so 
i spent my pregnancies
buried in books 
well  what she means to say is you were

 all laugh 
 daisy  and then what about tom 
was he like a big inventor 
mm 
 sighs  sorry

daisy  what did you think

 jeff

you know  work the earth
and be part of it all 
i m going to mars 
realistically though 
i am being realistic 
well  you know  i just thought
i would give you a purpose 
i have a purpose 
 sighs  i m not tom  dad 
so you won t even consider it

it just doesn t make any sense 
it would be a waste of both of our
times when i m leaving so soon

i cheated at swimming 
  what 
  that s why i moved here 
i wasn t good enough 
i was one second
short of placing 
one second 
and i was under
a lot of pressure 
and so i took a supplement 
and i got found out 
and i got banned 
and now  it defines me 
my family s ashamed of me 
i m ashamed of me 
why are you telling me this now 
because i don t wanna have
anything in common with that guy 
look  i  i know
curtis doesn t come off well 
but he s  um  he s
actually really intelligent 
  he published this paper on solar phase   
  he s going to mars
to escape his life

into your mission 
  and 
  and it s a bunch of ifs and maybes 
  it s a risk 
  it s giving up 
you act like the world
is such a bad place   
it s a shit world 
then change it 
you like me 
and you won t acknowledge it 
and the crazy thing is 
is that i like you too 
but we can t do
anything about it
because it doesn t fit
into your schedule 
so  what am i supposed to do 
quit the mission
so i can date you 
no  i just want you to consider
why you re actually doing it 
if it s to be an explorer
or a scientist  then great 
  but if not   
  if not what 
 sighs

i think of tom

dying as well 
which  trust me  i know i need
colossal amounts
of therapy to fix 
just imagining it  the pain 
so unbearable  it s easier
to just stay away and   
work every hour of the day 
i thought there was something wrong
with me  cause i imagined you dying 
really 
  we re fucked up 
  i think we really are 
 both laughing 
god  i miss him so much 
me too 
even though he was
the  uh  blatant favorite 
god  farm wonder
and baseball star 
with rugged good looks 
and none
of our debilitating anxiety 
none 
he always gestured too much
when he was telling stories 
what was that about

until after work though 
you re right  and i was wrong 
never mind  i like this 
for me  space is safe
as i can control it 
even though
it s completely unpredictable
and ever expanding into a degree
where it could all
implode at once 
but that is not the point 
that  that   
this is  this   
the point is this 
and this is terrifying 
i m terrified 
you are terrifying 
glad i brought so much
to the table 
my brother died

we were driving 
and there was a deer
in the road  and we swerved 
i  i swerved 
 exhales 
he was really great  daisy 
he had my mom s eyes 
and  um   
he was funny 
and the last thing he did was
he put his arm out
to protect me 
even though we all know
that doesn t do anything 
 sighs 
but since then 
i have been so scared
of that happening
to anyone else that i love 
 exhales 
so  that s how i know that

  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  though your feet may take you
far from me i know  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  you made me feel like
i was always falling  
  always falling down
without a place to land  
  somewhere in the distance
heard you calling  
  oh  it hurt so bad
to let go of your hand  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  though your feet may take you
far from me i know  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  even when you re high
you can get low  
  even with your friends
you love you re still alone  
  we always find
the darkest place to go  
  god forgive our minds
we were born to roam  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  though your feet may take you
far from me i know  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  oh  god forgive my mind  
  oh  god forgive my mind
when i come home  
  when i come home  
  oh  god forgive my mind  
  there s a road that s long
and winding it hollers home  
  i m calling home  
  oh  god forgive my mind  
  oh  god forgive my mind
when i come home  
  when i come home  
  oh  god forgive my mind  
  oh  god forgive my mind
when i come home  
  when i come home  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  wherever is your heart
i call home  
  though your feet may take you
far from me i know  
  wherever is your heart
