try the turkey and you ll discover how 
lucy  down 
get out 
joe 
have you seen joe 
bet joe s not gonna
wanna do my movie anymore

the story is about the living dead 
  his mom is not a zombie 
  but she s dead  shit head 
  it s troubled his heart pretty good 
  told you 
get him out of here 
just wait a minute 
wait

the longest day ever 
  here 
  what s this 
new scene  check it out 
detective hathaway has a wife now

oh my god  shut up 
so who s going to play the wife 
jen

i was returning that book
on  codes and ciphers  
she was in the silent reading section 
and i asked her
if she ll play hathaway s wife 
wait  you talked
to alice dainard  really 
you aren t suppose to talk at all
in the silent reading section 
  shut up 
  it s for silent reading 
she said  yes  
we re filming tonight
and she s driving 
driving  driving where 
that was a really good zombie murder 
but it s not a story yet 
all the kids that are
entering this film festival 
fifteen and sixteen years old 
have better stories and
casts and production value 
  i got nothing 
  charles  dinner

i just don t understand how
the wife helps make it a story

wife s telling the detective that she
cares for him  that she loves him 
i can t believe you
talk to alice dainard 
charles  come on  move it 
i m coming 
and watch your head this time

  good morning joe 
  good morning mr  kaznyk 
hi joe  did you hear
about the train crash 
  no 
  it s on the news 
use local crews  instead   
opting to use military personnel 
which to this reporter  only
adds to the mystery 
of course we have much more to
the story as it develops 
coming to you live
from montgomery county
do you believe this 
no 
  it s on the news  that means it s real 
  i know 
dr thomas woodward is still being
treated by air force personnel
after last night s train derailment  
woodward apparently fell asleep
at the wheel of his pick up truck   
which was hit by the speeding train 
how about you clean it up 
that would be a great help 
thank you so much 
it s the largest accident
in ohio history 
the condition of woodward   
who has been teaching
middle school for the past 3 years   
looks like a disaster movie  doesn t it 
my god 
joe  you re so awesome 
  what 
  we can use it  we can film it 
you wanna go back 
  oh shit  that s mint 
  really 
you re a total brain 
we gotta get the camera fixed and   
  the film developed from last night 
  okay 
i m gonna steal some money
from my mom 
if any of the footage
is useable from last night 
that means we need alice
to play the wife again 
oh yes  i thought she was really good 
yes  she was mint
but she s never gonna do it 
i think she will 
there s no way 
you heard what she said 
but that s before the new scenes  right 
you honestly think she
cares about the scenes 
she was totally vague 
yes  she was  we all were 
lens is cracked  focus ring broke 
do you think it s fixable 
i guess it is cheaper to get a new one 
the camera is busted man  it s over 
we can use my dad s
camera  it s got slow   
hello 
hey alice  it s joe lamb 
hi 
so we have some new
scenes for the movie 
and charles and i are
hoping you ll be in them 
oh     no  i m done with that 
i need this film developed as soon
as possible  can you do it overnight 
asshole  no one can do it overnight 
you want to buy some pot 
no  no  thank you 
well  what is the fastest you can do 
i can make it a rush 
and get your film back in three days 
and what is your sister up to 
the hot one  not the other one 
i don t know 
watching the crash on the news
  yeah  i saw it 
  i should go 
wait  hold on 
i ll come over 
  i ll bring the scenes 
  no  no 
i ll be right there  it s a good idea 
i don t care what charles wants 
i said  no  on the phone 
i know you totally did 
i know that s true but   
now you re at my house 
i am  which   
i don t understand why you guys
keep working on that stupid movie 
you should go 
what s this 
he was just inviting me to a party 
good morning  mr dainard 
she s not going to your party 
yes sir 
you  get outta here 
you go home
and you don t come back here 
i don t wanna see you 
ally come inside 
ally  i m in the kitchen 
i ll do it 
what 
cut  that was mint 
oh my god  with the train 
so good 
  joe  reload the cap gun 
  okay 
we ll shoot another angle next 
alice that was mint 
martin go over faster next time 
i ll try charles  i was just crying out
last night  man 
guys  did it really look good 
you look awesome 
what do you think happened 
you mean why he crashed the train 
i just got a horrible feeling 
dude  what re you doing 
that whole thing is an air force train 
what 
i make models 
like plastic ones 
you know  go home  paint them 
and he s not embarrassed by that 
  whose talking  math camp 
  thanks 
can i have some coffee please 
cream on the side 
he s so sophisticated 
  shut up  i like coffee 
  no one likes coffee 
air force trains  even the models
have these hooks 
oh  they do 
for when the trains are loaded
on the transport ships 
every car on that crash had   
joe  you stop talking about it  alright 
wait guys 
am i the only guy who doesn t
understand any of this means 
probably  smartin  
  cary shut up 
i don t like it when you call me that 
i m sorry  smartin  
let s just go cry about it 
no  dr  woodward had that map 
he drove onto the train tracks 
maybe there was something
he wanted to destroy 
you guys should shut up 
maybe he was just sick of living
and wanted to kill himself 
dumb idea 
he had a gun 
why not use that 
there are infinitely more
effective ways to commit suicide 
  pills  hanging   
  hey  pussy 
stop taking the fries away 
  i order these for a reason 
  excuse me 
can we have another order of fries
because my friend here is fat 
funny chomper  at least
i don t have to use a booster seat 
  you can jump from a building 
  or fall down some stairs 
  oh  that s not really effective 
  do you think 
if this is the air force 
what would the air force have on the train 
jesus  shut up about it 
you heard what old man woodward said 
we can t talk about this 
joe  seriously 
do you really wanna take a chance that
something could happen to your dad too 
  it s loaded  move out 
  yes  sir 
yes  deputy  i m told this crash
has caused a whole mess of confusion 
well  as you can expect  the local
authorities are trying to figure out   
just what has happened
as well as how to help here 
it s all under control 
it ll be a very fast clean up 
colonel  there isn t anything
i should know of  sir 
not that i can think of  deputy 
i understand you have
concerns about our cargo 
i d like to see that manifest  yes 
well  that s not gonna be possible 
colonel  i ve got a lotta people
in my town   
they re gonna wanna know
what s taking place 
which town is that 
lillian   
deputy  if you re asking me if there s any
dangerous property onboard this train 
i can assure you the answer is  no  
  colonel 
  excuse me 
they gave me around
like two hours   
before they allowed me
to talk to anyone 
i d say they ve had
their hands full  jack 
sheriff  the colonel
refused to show the manifest 
he told me they re carrying mostly
aeroplane parts  i don t buy that 
it s air force  jack 
aeroplane parts really make sense 
sheriff  i m telling you
there s something else going on 
they re    they re taking moulds
of tire tracks 
why would they be doing that 
who d they be looking for 
and then they e packaging these
weird little cubes into these crates 
  weird little cubes  huh 
  they load them on these red trucks 
there dozens of  em 
sheriff  i think you need to
check it out 
and i think
you need to take a break 
jack  i ve been telling you this
since elizabeth 
you re a good deputy 
but you need to take a vacation 
go home 
take off your uniform 
go fishing 
give your son a hug 
hey breen  i m not sure
edie s paying you to listen to the radio 
  breen 
  hey  sheriff 
  what s that 
  walkman 
it s like a stereo 
plays on cassette tapes 
you wanna try it 
i don t think so 
kids walk around with their own stereo 
just what we need 
it s a slippery slope  my friend 
yes  sir 
sheriff 
sheriff 
you know it s
in the scene of movie   
where did you learn to do this 
mostly the dick smith s
 monsters make up  paint book 
hey  joe  we need some more footage
of the train crash 
obviously 
you know that train model
you just made 
  yup  your cargo train 
  i wanna blow it up and film it 
let me blow it up 
  yeah  sure 
  fantastic 
it s fine 
they can blow it up 
i don t care 
you wanna see it 
the train  my train model 
the train i made 
whoa   
wow 
dude  that s bitching  man   
that s like the third time
this happened 
joe  how am i suppose to be a zombie 
oh  um   
uh    pretty much be a lifeless ghoul 
no soul  dead eyes    scary 
  did you ever have miss mullen 
  for english 
  yeah 
  yeah 
i liked her  but   
 hungry for human flesh  
like she wants to turn
somebody into a zombie 
 cause that s kinda what zombies do 
okay 
oh my  yeah  it s really good 
  not bad 
  really 
really 
careful  there was a gas spill 
i don t even know how
much fuel i ve lost 
you don t seem to be asking   
  very many questions 
  give the man some time  mr  blakely 
he s only a deputy 
he s not the sheriff 
i think this is most likely
a bear attack 
security cameras showed nothing 
someone had erased   
vicky  you heard from
sheriff pruitt this morning 
negative  not a word 
vicky  you need to update
and send a cs unit out to edie s 
and put an apb out on
the sheriff and breen haskell 
and send units over to their houses
immediately  you copy all that 
copy  and jack 
we re getting a lotta unusual calls 
what kind of unusual calls 
i never seen
this kinda things before 
i mean  what the hell
am i suppose to do 
the insurance company guys
thought i was joking with  em 
look at my bonneville over here 
they don t have a winch
to take that out 
been having any troubles
with anyone lately  izzy 
what 
i was thinking
you should talk to louis dainard 
yeah    i didn t help him out
with financing last year 
and i wouldn t be surprised
if this was some sort of sick retribution 
my generator is missing   
my dog    disappeared 
he s gone   
you should file a report 
i ll have someone come out   
and take care
of each one of you  okay 
lucy 
lucy 
i got four guys on missing cases 
people don t feel safe around here 
and you know why 
because they are not 
the air force doesn t answer
a damn question 
they got trucks
over at woodward s house 
now ben heard they re looking
for woodward s research 
research 
one of the soldier on the truck 
  he had like a scanner in his hand 
  that s a geiger counter 
they re saying it s just clean up
at the crash site 
but they re taking moulds
of tire tracks 
that means they re looking for someone 
now what does that means 
have you seen lucy anywhere 
no  i m sure
she s around somewhere 
i put a couple of slices
in the fridge for you 
oh  uh    i ate those 
sorry  kid 
no problem 
i ll find something 
  hey   
  what s this 
pick that up  will you 
hey  vicky  you have power
down at the station 
on and off 
the whole county is in the dark 
do me a favour and get water
and power up right now  will you 
so  the air force is looking for a car 
alice s dad car 
they re taking tire prints
from the crash site  over 
i don t wanna hear about it 
that s what i ve been talking about 
they could be monitoring us right now 
jesus  shut up 
over 
the military is at woodward s house
looking for his research 
whatever that means 
do not freak out on me and be a dick 
are you gonna come
and help me tomorrow or not 
i need you to make alice
a zombie again 
okay  i ll do the makeup 
  shhh

20 microwaves 
gone 
from my inventory 
everywhere you look
things are going missing 
we ve got trains crashing 
people vanishing 
belmont s county is without power 
you know what this feels like to me 
this feels like a  russian invasion  
i don t think the russians
had anything to do   
with what s going on
in the town 
but i m calling a curfew   
unless you can tell me who s been
messing around with our stuff 
i say it s the soviets

  what 
we have to find this thing 
come on 
okay  sorry 
i told them that this creature is
much more sophisticated than any of us 
that his species
is predominantly  subterranean  
  and to have it treated without   
  subterranean 
compassion or respect 
i explained  that all he wants
is to rebuild his ship 
a craft made up of those cubes
of complex shape shifting alloys 
remarkable material that we will
never fully understand 
he has been desperate to reconstitute
his ship since it crashed here in  58 
but instead of giving him the help
he needs  we held him as a prisoner 
  guys it s dr  woodward 
  he has been restrained   
and experimented upon 
biopsied and tortured by nelec 
through pain and lack of compassion we
have taught him to hate us all 
we have turned him into an enemy 
i told them i knew these things
because he made contact with me 
that he makes
a psychic connection by touch 
oh  my god 
  jesus 
what s that thing 
  what the hell   
i can t watch this 
the moment he made contact
i understood him 
and he  me 
what i know is that if we don t
change this and begin helping him 
we will all pay the price 
but nelec wouldn t listen 
he wasn t trying to kill it 
he had me discharged 
he was trying to help him escape 
but i won t give up 
i ll do everything in my power   
  oh  my god 
  guys  hear that 
help him rebuild that ship
