for harvesting grain 
no more picking individual kernels 
you can just cut down the entire stalk 
  flik  we don t have time for this 
  exactly  we never have time
to collect food for ourselves 
because we spend all summer
harvesting for the offering 
  but my invention
will speed up production 
  oh  another invention 
  yeah  and i ve got
something for you too 
  flik 
since you re gonna be queen  you could
use this to oversee production 
  dr flora  if i may 
  this is all very nice  but  
  what 
  just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew  right 
  flik  please 
wrong  it is  in fact  a telescope 
  it s very clever  flik  but  
  hello  princess  my  aren t
you looking lovely this morning 
not  of course  that you would
need a telescope to see that 
all right  listen  the princess
doesn t have time for this 
you wanna help us fill this thing 
then get rid of that machine   
get back in line
and pick grain like everybody else 
  like everybody else 
  please  flik  just go 
i m sorry  l l was  
i was really just trying  
trying to help 
harvester  why  we harvested
the same way ever since i was a pupa 
where were we

  oh  yes  yes 
hey  flik  flik  wait up 
  oh  hello  princess

but let s just pretend for
a minute that it s a seed  all right 
we ll just use our imaginations 
now   now  do you see our tree 
everything that made
that giant tree   
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed 
all it needs is some time  a little bit
of sunshine and rain  and   
voila 
this rock will be a tree 
seed to tree  you ve gotta
work with me  all right  okay 
you might not feel
like you can do much now   
but that s just because 
well  you re not a tree yet 
you just have to give yourself
some time  you re still a seed 
  but it s a rock 
  i know it s a rock 
don t ya think i know
a rock when i see a rock 
i ve spent a lot of time around rocks 
you re weird  but i like you

i need to tell you 
  not now  flik

it s about the offering 
  hey  what s goin  on 
  yeah  where s the food 
  what did you do 
  it was an accident 
boo 
where s the food  huh 
hopper 
so  where is it 
where s my food 
  i l lsn t it up there 
  what 
 the food was in a leaf sitting on top  
 excuse me 
are you sure it s not up there 
  are you saying i m stupid 
  no 
do i look stupid to you 
let s just think
about the logic  shall we 
let s just think about it for a second 
if it was up there 
would i be coming down here   
to your level  looking for it 
  uh  l  
  why am i even talking to you 
you re not the queen 
you don t smell like the queen 
sh she s learning
to take over for me  hopper 
oh  i see  under new management 
so it s your fault 
no  it wasn t me  it was  
uh uh uh  first rule of leadership 
everything is your fault 
  but but l  
  it s a bug eat bug world
out there  princess   
one of those circle of life
kind of things 
now  let me tell you
how things are supposed to work 
the sun grows the food 
the ants pick the food 
  the grasshoppers eat the food  
  and the birds eat the grasshoppers 
hey  like the one that nearly
ate you  you remember  you remember 
  oh  you should ve seen it 
  molt 
this blue jay   he has him halfway
down his throat  okay  and hopper  
hopper s kickin  and screamin   okay 
and i m scared  okay 
i m not goin  anywhere near  okay 
aw  come on  it s a great story 
ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  ow 
i swear  if i hadn t promised
mother on her deathbed   
that i wouldn t kill you 
i would kill you 
  and believe me  no one
appreciates that more than i do 
  shut up 
i don t want to hear another word
out of you while we re on this island 
do you understand me 
  i said  do you understand me 
  well  how can i answer 
you said i couldn t say another word 
remember ma 
hey  i m a compassionate insect 
there s still a few months
till the rains come   
so you can all just try again 
but  hopper  since
it s almost the rainy season   
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves 
listen  if you don t
keep your end of the bargain 
then i can t guarantee your safety 
and there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you 
someone could get hurt 
what s the matter 
you scared of grasshoppers 
  dot 
  you don t like thumper 
leave her alone 
you want her  go ahead  take her 
no  then get back in line 
it seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place 
so let s double
the order of food 
  huh 
  no  but but but  
we ll be back
at the end of the season   
when the last leaf falls 
you ants have a nice summer 
let s ride 
flik  what do you have
to say for yourself 
sorry  i   i m sorry
for the way i am 
i didn t mean for things
to go so wrong 
i especially didn t want
to make you look bad  princess 
  well  flik  ya did 
  i was just trying to help 
then help us   don t help us 
  help  help  help 
  flik  you are sentenced
to one month digging in the tunnels 
excuse me  your highness 
need i remind you of flik s
tunnel within a tunnel project 
  helpers to help us  that could  
that s it  that s   we could  
  it took the whole
engineering department   
two days to dig him out 
  send him to health and ant services 
  heavens  no 
we could leave the island 
the river bed s dry right now  we d
just walk right across the river bed 
we could go get helpers 
we could  we could leave  sure 
we could go find helpers to help us 
  it s perfect 
  perfect  what s so perfect 
your highness  don t you see 
we could send someone to get help 
leave the island 
now  why didn t i think of that 
oh  because it s suicide 
 she s right  we never leave the island 
 never leave 
there s snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there 
exactly  bigger bugs 
we could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight   
and forever rid us
of hopper and his gang 
  ludicrous 
  who would do a crazy thing like that 
i ll volunteer 
i d be very happy to volunteer 
you got a lot of spunk  kid 
but no one s gonna help a bunch of ants 
at least we could try  oh  l l could  
i could travel to the city 
i could search there 
if you went  you d be
on that silly search for weeks 
  royal huddle 
  great idea  princess  it s perfect 
  exactly 
  wait a minute 
  what did we just decide here 
  to let flik leave 
while we keep harvesting
to meet hopper s demands 
  you see  with flik gone  he can t  
  he can t mess anything up 
flik  after much deliberation  we have
decided to grant you your request 
  really 
  really 
  uh  really 
oh  thank you  princess 
thank you so much for this chance 
  i l l won t let you down 
i promise  i promise  i promise 
  yeah  that s fine  that s fine 
no  forget it  forget it 
  oh  but i should probably help repair
the damage before i go  don t you think 
  no  no  no  just go 
  just go 
  just leave 
hey 
don t worry 
the colony is in good hands 
bye  now

how would you like to be the queen s
official aide to the warrior bugs 
  me 
  oh  sure  you ve got
a great rapport going with them   
especially after that rescue  
it was very brave 
  really  naw  naw  
  well  not every bug would face a bird 
  i mean  even hopper s afraid of  em 
  yeah  well  i guess maybe i have  
  say that again 
  i said  even hopper s afraid of birds 
thank you 
  hopper s afraid of birds 
  and i don t blame  im 
oh  oh  oh

we can get rid of hopper 
and no one has to know that i messed up 
you just keep pretending
you re warriors 
whoa  flik  honey  we are not
about to fight grasshoppers  okay 
you ll be gone before
the grasshoppers ever arrive 
it ll be easy  here s what we do 
not another word 
i don t know what you re concocting
in that little ant brain of yours   
but we ll have no part of it 
excuse me  could we get
the warriors  autographs 
autographs 
  oh  wow  great 
  so  you fellas catch the action today

delightful lads 
you were saying  flik 
all right 
we are going to build a bird  
a bird that we can operate
from the inside  which would then
be hoisted above our anthill  
hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree 
then  right when hopper
and his gang are below   
we ll launch the bird and
scare off the grasshoppers 
now it s going to take  
everyone s involvement
to make this plan a reality 
i know it s not our tradition
to do things differently   
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill   
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird 
  perfect

  i hate it when someone
gives away the ending 
you piece of dirt 
no  i m wrong 
you re lower than dirt 
you re an ant 
let this be a lesson
to all you ants 
ideas are very dangerous things 
you are mindless 
soil shoving losers   
put on this earth
to serve us 
you re wrong  hopper 
ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers 
i ve seen these ants
do great things 
and year after year 
they somehow manage   
to pick food
for themselves and you 
so so who is the weaker species 
ants don t serve grasshoppers 
it s you who need us 
we re a lot stronger
than you say we are 
and you know it  don t you 
well  princess 
um  hopper 
um  l l hate to interrupt  but  um  
you ants stay back 
  oh  this was such a bad idea 
  you see  hopper   
nature has a certain order 
the ants pick the food 
the ants keep the food   
and the grasshoppers leave 
  i m so proud of you  flik 
  charge a 
where are you going 
they re just ants 
no  bad grasshopper 
bad grasshopper  go home 
  yeah 
  come back here  you cowards 
  don t leave 
  to the cannon
