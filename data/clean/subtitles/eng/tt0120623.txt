to collect food for ourselves
because we spend all summer
harvesting for the offering
but my invention
will speed up production
oh another invention
yeah and ive got
something for you too
flik
since youre gonna be queen you could
use this to oversee production
dr flora if i may
this is all very nice but
what
just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew right
flik please
wrong it is in fact a telescope
its very clever flik but
hello princess my arent
you looking lovely this morning
not of course that you would
need a telescope to see that
all right listen the princess
doesnt have time for this
you wanna help us fill this thing

inside this tiny little seed
all it needs is some time a little bit
of sunshine and rain and
voila
this rock will be a tree
seed to tree youve gotta
work with me all right okay
you might not feel
like you can do much now

illsnt it up there
what
the food was in a leaf sitting on top
excuse me
are you sure its not up there
are you saying im stupid
no
do i look stupid to you
lets just think
about the logic shall we
lets just think about it for a second
if it was up there
would i be coming down here
to your level looking for it
uh l
why am i even talking to you
youre not the queen
you dont smell like the queen
shshes learning
to take over for me hopper
oh i see under new management
so its your fault
no it wasnt me it was
uhuhuh first rule of leadership
everything is your fault
butbut l
its a bugeatbug world
out there princess
one of those circleoflife
kind of things
now let me tell you
how things are supposed to work
the sun grows the food
the ants pick the food
the grasshoppers eat the food
and the birds eat the grasshoppers
hey like the one that nearly
ate you you remember you remember
oh you shouldve seen it
molt
this blue jay he has him halfway
down his throat okay and hopper
hoppers kickin and screamin okay
and im scared okay
im not goin anywhere near okay
aw come on its a great story
ow ow ow ow ow ow
i swear if i hadnt promised
mother on her deathbed
that i wouldnt kill you
i would kill you
and believe me no one
appreciates that more than i do
shut up
i dont want to hear another word
out of you while were on this island
do you understand me
i said do you understand me
well how can i answer
you said i couldnt say another word
remember ma
hey im a compassionate insect
theres still a few months
till the rains come
so you can all just try again
but hopper since
its almost the rainy season
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves
listen if you dont
keep your end of the bargain
then i cant guarantee your safety
and there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you
someone could get hurt
whats the matter
you scared of grasshoppers
dot
you dont like thumper
leave her alone
you want her go ahead take her
no then get back in line
it seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place
so lets double
the order of food
huh
no butbutbut
well be back
at the end of the season
when the last leaf falls
you ants have a nice summer
lets ride
flik what do you have
to say for yourself
sorry i im sorry
for the way i am
i didnt mean for things
to go so wrong
i especially didnt want
to make you look bad princess
well flik ya did
i was just trying to help
then help us dont help us
help help help
flik you are sentenced
to one month digging in the tunnels
excuse me your highness
need i remind you of fliks
tunnelwithinatunnel project
helpers to help us that could
thats it thats we could
it took the whole
engineering department
two days to dig him out
send him to health and ant services
heavens no
we could leave the island
the river beds dry right now wed
just walk right across the river bed
we could go get helpers
we could we could leave sure
we could go find helpers to help us
its perfect
perfect whats so perfect
your highness dont you see
we could send someone to get help
leave the island
now why didnt i think of that
oh because its suicide
shes right we never leave the island
never leave
theres snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there
exactly bigger bugs
we could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight
and forever rid us
of hopper and his gang
ludicrous
who would do a crazy thing like that
ill volunteer
id be very happy to volunteer
you got a lot of spunk kid
but no ones gonna help a bunch of ants
at least we could try oh ll could
i could travel to the city
i could search there
if you went youd be
on that silly search for weeks
royal huddle
great idea princess its perfect
exactly
wait a minute
what did we just decide here
to let flik leave
while we keep harvesting
to meet hoppers demands
you see with flik gone he cant
he cant mess anything up
flik after much deliberation we have
decided to grant you your request
really
really
uh really
oh thank you princess
thank you so much for this chance
ill wont let you down
i promise i promise i promise
yeah thats fine thats fine
no forget it forget it
oh but i should probably help repair
the damage before i go dont you think

oh theyre all so cool
i cant pick
delightful lads
you were saying flik
all right
we are going to build a bird
a bird that we can operate
from the inside which would then
be hoisted above our anthill
hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree
then right when hopper
and his gang are below
well launch the bird and
scare off the grasshoppers
now its going to take
everyones involvement
to make this plan a reality
i know its not our tradition
to do things differently
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird
perfect
okay hit your marks

to all you ants
ideas are very dangerous things
you are mindless
soilshoving losers

ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers
ive seen these ants
do great things

soso who is the weaker species
ants dont serve grasshoppers
its you who need us
were a lot stronger
than you say we are
and you know it dont you
well princess
um hopper
um ll hate to interrupt but um
you ants stay back
oh this was such a bad idea
you see hopper
nature has a certain order
the ants pick the food
the ants keep the food
and the grasshoppers leave
im so proud of you flik
