and if i get
a little hungry
they usually throw me
some food down at the valley
the valley
the valley of the temples
you dont even
remember that
yeah
thats where
it all goes down
both grunting

birds cawing
let them know
we found him
rendezvous at
the temple
birds squawking
hey maybe i could
get something to eat
like a noodle
or a pickle
harrigan somebody give
wylie some food
croaking
wylie jake
he comes from there
its the comet you see
in the sky right now
it passes over the earth
every six years
and causes a portal
right here
but when its open
we get a visitor
from a distant galaxy
i mean he actually
comes here from a place
millions of light years away
looking for a fight with you
the chosen jiu jitsu
and if he
doesnt get it
he stays
and he kills everything
he taught our ancestors
how to fight him
then you took an oath
and thats how he did it
thats how he gave you
jiu jitsu
yeah i could eat
crows cawing
chuckles
clears throat
harrigan jake
hey
pay attention
keep your
head on straight
i said suit him up
hmm
if you cover yourself
completely with this
brax cant see you
harrigan look at me
look at me
i dont know
how much you forgot
but it better not be this
look up
you see it
twelve oclock
by the time it gets to those
trees itll be dark
fighting brax in the
dark is not what we want
we want to bring the
fight to him before then
thanks to you we got to
climb up this hill
with the geiger counters
we got to find him
we got to lure him out
get the edge
what happens after dark
if brax doesnt square off
and kill us by then
the hole doesnt close
and he stays
everyone dies
everyone
you used to say the fight
was worth dying for jake
all the time
i believed you
try to keep up
a lot of us thought it would
be you who has the chance
to take brax out
you look puzzled
are you puzzled
i mean i get it im puzzled
im real puzzled
theres a comet theres a
portal theres brax
why dont i remember
any of this
dont worry so much about
what you dont remember
which is
pretty much everything
the main thing
is to focus
you remember how to do that
maybe
maybe
youve been preparing
for this fight
your entire life
that makes sense
fighting that son of a bitch
makes all the sense
in the world
yeah you got
to fight him
even if it kills you
you got to fight him
you get your honor back
now brax fights
nine fighters
fight fight fight fight
fight fight fight fight fight
and then he goes home
but if any of the fighters
refuse to fight him
he devours
he devours anything that
walks flies crawls
i mean he destroys
entire towns and villages
now you
you you you you you
you maybe might actually
have to die
but as long
as you die bravely
no one else will have to
not for another six years
that is alien politics
five through fifteen
you said
he fights nine
why is there
only eight of us
like i said
dont worry so much
about what you
dont remember
i want to know
harrigan keep moving
we lost a guy
jake what happened
brax happened
brax
brax you know
who that is right
