i mean  i ve got
my hobbies 
i make hats
out of newspapers 
look at this 
you see the attention
to detail 
it s an art  it s a craft 
but it takes time 
and i got plenty of time 
and if i get
a little hungry 
they usually throw me
some food down at the valley 
the valley 
the valley of the temples 
you don t even

 grunting 
now you re going to face

he ll kill you
in the worst way 
 grunts 
nice 
 grunts 
 piano plays 
carmen  jake 
we re talking 
can t you see we re talking 
you re gonna want
to come with us  jake 
no  his mind s
all messed up 
he s crazy 
like me 
we don t have
a lot of time  jake 
you know what
this is  right 
you know us 
i don t think he does 
jake  you come with us 
come with us 
come on 
come on  you can
trust me  come on 
 birds cawing 
let them know
we found him 
rendezvous at
the temple 
 birds squawking 
hey  maybe i could
get something to eat 
like a noodle
or a pickle 
harrigan  somebody give
wylie some food 
 croaking 
wylie  jake   
he comes from there 
it s the comet you see
in the sky right now 
it passes over the earth
every six years 
and causes a portal
right here 
but when it s open 
we get a visitor
from a distant galaxy 
i mean  he actually
comes here from a place
millions of light years away
looking for a fight with you 
the chosen jiu jitsu 
and if he
doesn t get it 
he stays
and he kills everything 
he taught our ancestors
how to fight him 
then you took an oath   
and that s how he did it 
that s how he gave you
jiu jitsu 
yeah  i could eat 
 crows cawing 
 chuckles 
 clears throat 
harrigan  jake   
hey 
pay attention 
keep your
head on straight 
i said  suit him up 
hmm 
if you cover yourself
completely with this 
brax can t see you 
harrigan  look at me 
look at me 
i don t know
how much you forgot 
but it better not be this 
look up 
you see it 
twelve o clock 
by the time it gets to those
trees  it ll be dark 
fighting brax in the
dark is not what we want 
we want to bring the
fight to him before then 
thanks to you  we got to
climb up this hill
with the geiger counters 
we got to find him 
we got to lure him out 
get the edge 
what happens after dark 
if brax doesn t square off
and kill us by then 
the hole doesn t close
and he stays 
everyone dies 
everyone 
you used to say the fight
was worth dying for  jake 
all the time 
i believed you 
try to keep up 
a lot of us thought it would
be you who has the chance
to take brax out 
you look puzzled 
are you puzzled 
i mean  i get it  i m puzzled 
i m real puzzled 
there s a comet  there s a
portal  there s brax 
why don t i remember
any of this 
don t worry so much about
what you don t remember 
which is
pretty much everything 
the main thing
is to focus 
  you remember how to do that 
  maybe 
maybe 
you ve been preparing
for this fight
your entire life 
that makes sense 
fighting that son of a bitch
makes all the sense
in the world 
yeah  you got
to fight him 
even if it kills you 
you got to fight him 
you get your honor back 
now  brax fights
nine fighters 
fight  fight  fight  fight 
fight  fight  fight  fight  fight 
and then he goes home 
but if any of the fighters
refuse to fight him 
he devours 
he devours anything that
walks  flies  crawls 
i mean  he destroys
entire towns and villages 
now  you   
you  you  you  you  you 
you maybe might actually
have to die 
but as long
as you die bravely 
no one else will have to 
not for another six years 
that is alien politics
five through fifteen 
you said
he fights nine 
why is there
only eight of us 
like i said 
don t worry so much
about what you
don t remember 
  i want to know 
  harrigan  keep moving

i ve been clocking that thing
for 24 years
for army intelligence 
what s your procedure

that s not good enough 
i lost too many good men   
and women   
following orders 
 sand breathing heavily 
you can do it different 
he can heal
from almost anything 
but it takes him
about five or six seconds
before he s whole again 
that s your window

get to it  soldier 
do you ever ask
yourself the question 
 why am i still alive  
 chuckles 
so you think
this is funny 
he s playing with his
food  don t you think 
he s like a killer whale
in the frozen waters
of the arctic with a seal 
he fools with its head
and then he kills it 
it s horrible 
pull up a chair 
okay 
you know something 
i know something
you don t know 
i know that the space man
actually likes you 
he likes you
because he s paying you
a very high honor 
and i hate to think
that s undeserved 
a high honor 
oh  yeah  he s saving
the best for last
out of respect
for your skills 
it s an enormous honor 
and he bestows it upon you
in spite of what you did

the story will be told
for generations 
just like with me 
six years ago 
i flinched when i faced
him  just like you 
yeah  i begged for my life 
but he thinks i m crazy 
there s no honor
in killing crazy 
you actually ran 
and by running 
you allowed him to come here
and kill the innocent 
that s on you 
but this time 
we have a plan 
we 
so you re one of us 
so tell me this 
old man 
will i end up
like you 
no  you won t live
long enough 
you won t make it
through the day 
hmm  or he won t 
that s more like it 
that s the spirit 
brax has no use
for a coward 
he likes
brave fighters 
once he has you pegged
as a coward 
you become like
a sporting hunt to him 
he s like manolete 
the clownish bullfighter 
and you re the bull 
he ll want to make
an example out of you 
prove a point 
mess with your head first 
and then he ll kill you 
 thuds

he can stop trying 
 grunts

 panting 
 grunts 
 gasps  chokes 
 brax snarls 
 wheezing 
carmen   echoing 
he was your father 
 gasps 
 grunting 
 screams 
 hisses 
come on 
 screeches 
 snarling 
 grunting 
 thunder crashes 
 whistling tauntingly 
 yells 
sand  but it takes him
about five or six seconds
before he s whole again 
that s your window 
 thunder rumbles 
 snarls 
carmen  jake 
 roars 
jake 
 brax roars 
 snarls 
 electricity crackles 
 yells 
 brax screams 
 groans 
 in burmese 
mm 
 chuckles softly 
 whimpering softly 
 bottle clinks 
are we good 
everything cool 
it s not another one 
is it 
you got to be safe
about these things 
you never know 
it ll be like goldilocks
and the three aliens out here 
you know what i mean 
mama alien  baby alien 
whoo   sighs 
who wants a drink 
ooh 
 speaks burmese 
 both laugh 
 in burmese
