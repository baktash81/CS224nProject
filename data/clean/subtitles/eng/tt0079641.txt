from transylvania 
he wants to buy
a house here 
of course  it s a
enormous trip to see him 
where is that 
over the carpathian
mountains  isn t it

but  on the other hand 
there will be a large commission 
oh  then i could get a
nicer house for lucy 
she deserves a finer setting 
yes 
well  this won t be easy 
make take you a long time 
cost you a lot of sweat   
and possibly also   
a bit of blood 
it ll be good to get out
of the city for a while   
get away from these canals 
which go nowhere
but back on themselves 
transylvania 
there  beyond the forest 
a wonderful place  a little
gloomy  but very exciting 
the count is just looking
for a beautiful old house 
i ve felt about a big one
near your place 
but it s almost in ruins
been abandoned for years 
i m sure he can make it
into something cozy
anyway  we ll offer it   to him 
you ll leave right now 
right now 
today

we mustn t make him wait 
all right then 
if it has to be today

yes  to a castle in the carpathians 
it s a strange area where
there are still a few wolves
and people believe in ghosts 
jonathan  i don t want you to go 
  i have this awful feeling 
  that s ridiculous 
you ll be in danger 
don t go 
wolves  robbers and ghosts

i cannot permit it 
let s at least spend some
time for us by the see 
we used to enjoy it so much 
lucy 
i don t know 
sometimes i m so blind 
jonathan  
i have to say this 
even if you think it s foolish   
coming from a feeble
unprotected heart 
yes 
i feel a dark force 
an inner   nameless   deadly fear 
lucy is the dearest thing
in the world to me   
take care of her 
of course 
  mina  treat her as a sister 
  yes 
innkeeper  quick  my supper 
i have to go to the castle tonight 
which one 
count dracula s 
must you go there 
really 
yes  why 
at midnight   all sorts of
evil spirits are set loose 
people disappear
without a trace 
oh  come on  that s
all superstition 
you will not find a coach
which will take you there
and your own horse needs
care for several days 
i ll find another horse 
don t go there  sir 
the gypsies   
some of them have been
on the other side   
they know 
he says you shouldn t
go there  young man 
he says there s a great chasm 
it swallows the unwary 
then comes towering crags 
he says  
that the pass  
the borgo pass   
where the light
suddenly divides and   
there he says   the land rises upwards   
towards   towards   heaven   
and then falls to  
to no one knows where 
the gypsies here been saying  
that no such castle exists   
except maybe in the
imagination of man 
just a ruin 
they say   a ghost castle 
a traveler who enters into the
land of phantoms is lost   
and can never return 
for me 
vampires   
lets see   
of vampires and bloodsuckers 
of corpses which devour their own flesh 
of incubuses and succubuses 
of the living dead who follow
strangers in the night  
of werewolves  of milking of axes  
that s a good one   
milking and axes is blood 
makes men s bodies to quake
and their teeth to shatter in their heads 
transylvania    nosferatu 
beyond dead   
to curse will last
until the end of time 
the curse of the vampire nosferatu 
coachman  could you take
me to the borgo pass 
i ll pay you well 
there is no road to the borgo pass 
but it s right there 
i need your coach 
i haven t got a coach 
could i have at least
one of your horses 
i m willing to pay you
double the price 
sorry  sir 
can t you not see 
i haven t any horses 
well   
i ll have to walk 
count dracula 
jonathan harker 
you ve been expected
and welcome to my castle 
thank you 
come in 
the night is cold and you
must be tired and hungry 
these are the papers 
the fully document contains
the ground plane of the house
which i m sure you d like to see 
yes  yes 
please  help yourself 
please   
i m afraid
you must sup alone 
it s nearly midnight   
and i partake of
nothing at this hour 
unfortunately  the servants
are not at our disposal 
so you allow me   
to see to your comfort 
listen 
listen 
the children of the
night make their music 
ah  young man   
you re like the villagers   
who cannot place themselves
in the soul of the hunter 
the knife is old and
could be dirty 
it could give you
blood poisoning 
please   
let me do it 
it s the oldest
remedy in the world 
oh  forget it  it s hardly worth
mentioning  just a little cut 
you know   
it s only for the best 
let s sit up for a while 
it s still many
hours before dawn 
and during the daytime
i am always away 
lucy  my love   
there is no postal
service from here   
but i shall write to the diary 
preserving all my thoughts
and feelings for you 
last night after a tiresome journey 
i finally reached my destination   
the castle of count dracula 
i had a bad dream 
but i hope it will pass 
this castle is so strange 
at times i wonder if it
isn t part of that dream 
everything about it
looks so unreal 
i don t attach importance
to sunshine anymore    
or to glittering fountains 
which youth is so fond of 
i love the darkness
and the shadows 
where i can be alone
with my thoughts 
i am the descendent
of an old family 
time is an abyss 
profound as a thousand nights 
centuries come and go   
to be unable to grow
old is terrible 
that is not the worst  there are
things more horrible than that 
can you imagine
enduring centuries   
experiencing each day
the same futil things 
i m glad you found such a
large old house for me 
very near to your
lodging  i understand 
yes  it s just around the corner 
may i have a look at the contract 
what     what a lovely throat 
it s my wife  lucy 
your hand is so cold 
the document    the contract for the
house  i must sign it immediately 
yes  but we haven t
settled a price 
it s a small matter
between gentlemen   
i accept whatever
you find is just 
here 
how long did it take you
to get here from wismar 
four weeks 
i   
it takes a while to travel on land 
from the seed of belial
is the vampire born 
he who feeds on the
blood of mankind   
who  unredeemed  taketh his
refuge in caves  tombs   
coffins filled with the
unblessed soil of cemeteries   
wherein the black death
has reaped its harvest   
the plague 
jonathan 
she has a sudden fever 
call me at once if you
think it is necessary   
but i don t think it is
really that serious 
oh  god  he must be
going to wismar 
lucy 
lucy s in danger 
i ve got to get out of here 
it s strange   
but the papers are all in order 
let me see them   
from varna to wismar 
garden soil for
botanical experiments 
open one of them 
i want to make sure 
this one 
mother superior   
mother superior

the patient we got
yesterday is having a fit 
  which one 
  the one who bit the cow 
the one in solitary 
i ll come 
blood is life 
blood is life 
has he done
this often before 
yes  a few hours ago 
exactly the same thing 
instead of taking food
he tries to eat flies 
blood is life 
give them to me 
let go 
help 
quiet   
i hear the reskin of sails
no letter again 
but  lucy   
you mustn t worry
getting mail over the
carpathians is very dificult 
something has
happened to jonathan 
i know it 
lucy  take comfort 
the lord will hear our prayers 
god is so far from us
in the our of distress 
the young gentleman is quite ill 
he must not travel yet 
the coffins   
i must get to wismar
before the coffins 
the young gentleman should wait at
least until the doctor promised tomorrow 
lucy is in danger 
i have to save her 
the coffins 
evil is on the way 
the ship seems
burden with a curse 
since we left the caspian see 
one after another 
four mariners
with the second mate 
have taken them and gone
with their rewards 
one sailor and our cook have
disappeared without a trace 
a rumor circulated that there
was a stranger onboard
it terrified all 
we searched but there
was nothing but the rats 
we threw to our course 
northwest at 30 degrees 
the wind is steady 
12 knots this day 
mr  renfield   
you ordered my husband
to transylvania   
for weeks now i haven t
read word from him 
and i m sorry worried   
i m ready to sail out
to transylvania myself
stay here  if the master comes 
who is coming 
tell us all 
the master of the rats 
some consecrated and
400 thousand strong 
we should leave now 
plague 
in transylvania in the black sea
port of varna the plague has appeared 
the master has arrived 
the master has arrived 
hey  put a plank across 
the ship must be fully checked 
untie him 
not a soul on board 
very little freight 
but the hole is teaming with rats 
here s the log 
it is truly a mystery 
a chance gentlemen  the
ship s log may hold a clue to it 
varna  june 6  five hands 
two mates  a cook and myself 
direction  the dardanelles 
course westward 
today the third man
died of fever 
last night  the mate who had the
watch disappeared without a trace 
june 20th  course northward see high
making 40 knots towards biscaya 
fear grows daily
among the men 
only the first mate
and i remain alive 
rats are everywhere 
could it be the plague 
the plague 
go home quietly  please 
shut the doors and windows 
gentlemen 
gracious lady  we re
delivering this man 
he seems to belong
to this house 
lucy 
jonathan 
who is this woman 
lets bring him in 
it must be a very
severe brain fever 
the sun is hurting me 
dr  van helsing  do you think it is
possible that we re so insane   
that one day we will all wake
and find ourselves in straight jackets 
you must excuse
my utter entrance   
i am count dracula 
i know of you from
jonathan s diary 
since he has been
with you he s ruined
  he will not die 
  yes he will   
death is
overwellming 
eventually
we re all his 
stars s been
reeling confusion 
time passes
in blindness 
rivers flow without
knowing their course 
only death is
cruelly sure 
dying is cruelty against
the unsuspecting 
but death is
not everything 
is more cruel not
to be able to die 
i wish i could partake
of the love   
which is between
you and jonathan 
nothing in this world 
not even god can touch that 
and it will
not change 
even if jonathan never
recognizes me again 
i could change everything   
will you come to me   
and be my ally 
be the salvation
for your husband   
and to me 
the absence of love   
is the most abject pain 
salvation comes
from ourselves alone 
and you may rest assured
even the unthinkable
will not deter me   
good night 
stop 
help  help 
nosferatu  the undead 
he who drinketh
blood of his victims 
and turns them as well into
phantoms of the night 
he is as a shadow 
and have no reflection 
at night he penetrates
through walls and doors 
in shape of bat he wafts into
the chambers of the sleeping 
in shape of black wolf he
hunts down those who flee 
abandon all hope 
he who he does approach 
and yet do the vampire 
being an unnatural being   
he must obey some natural laws 
the sign of the cross bans him 
the consecrated host   
can bar his retreat 
ensure a woman pure of heart   
to make him forget
the cry of the cock   
the first light of day
will destroy him 
what does the master command 
go north   
to riga 
the army of rats and the
black death will beseech you 
oh    thy will be done 
amen   amen  
the plague  the plague 
what are you doing here 
i must go to
the town council 
it s dissolved 
it exists no more 
then  i have to see the mayor 
he s dead 
go as quickly as you can 
i know the reason
for all this evil 
i know the reason
for all this 
why don t you listen  
i know the reason 
but my child  these are all
figments of your imagination 
you have read
jonathan s diary 
you ve seen what has
happened to him 
it s getting worse
here every day 
the plague 
the rats 
and this book about the vampire 
this book explains it 
we live in a most enlightened era 
superstitions such as you mention   
have been refuted by science 
i am absolutly certain this exists 
i believe what i see
with my own eyes 
faith    faith   
faith  dr  van helsing 
faith 
faith is the amazing
faculty of men   
which enables us to
believe things   
which we know to be untrue 
you must come with me and help
me to crush this    this monster 
coffins have come by
boat from the black sea 
we can find where they re hidden
then we can destroy them 
we can search for them tonight 
my child  you need some
rest and relaxation 
the affair with your husband
has completely worn you out 
no  dr  van helsing  tonight 
this has to be
studied first  scientifically 
no  tonight 
we mustn t lose a moment 
even the farmer knows my child  that
everything has a proper time and sequence 
he doesn t dig up the wheat
to make sure it is growing 
only children playing at being
farmers do something like that 
i see i have to do this alone 
well  then 
mother superior  my medicine 
my lady  how did i come
to make your acquaintance 
god  forgive me for what i do 
join us  please 
it s our last supper 
we ve all caught the plague  you ll
have to enjoy each day is left 
madam lucy 
something terrible has happened  
are you alright  
you have to come to the schraders 
calm down  lucy   
you can come closer 
it is certainly not the plague 
my god 
what has happened 
we don t know exactly 
except this morning
shana found mina dead 
we took m to hospital 
we still have no explanation 
the causes will be gone into 
with scientific thoroughness 
leaving aside superstition
and prejudice 
the plague  we can most
certainly rule that out 
i know  now  what i have to do 
the consecrated host
bans the vampire 
ensure a woman pure of heart   
to make him forget
the cry of the cock   
the first light of day
will destroy him 
now i know her   
oh god if i had only
listened to her before 
a stake and a hammer quickly 
i have to dispatch
this demon forever 
stop 
don t do it 
help 
van helsing 
get him 
yes  him 
seize him 
that man has
murdered the count 
have you done that 
with that stake 
yes 
yes    but there was some
urgent reason for doing it 
that s for the court to decide 
you re under arrest 
dr  van helsing 
arrest this man 
arrest him 
you re asking me to arrest him 
yes 
i ve never arrested 
then get the police 
but they are gone 
then take him to prison 
there s no one there
to guard him anymore 
then you must arrest him yourself 
after all you re
a town employee 
and how should i do it  
i need arms for it 
  go on   get on with it 
  i can t  i m unarmed 
nevertheless  you
to arrest this man 
well   where will you take me  then 
i wonder myself 
to the prison i think 
what are you
doing standing there 
fetch a broom  can t you see 
everything here is full of dust 
seal the bedroom for
official investigation
