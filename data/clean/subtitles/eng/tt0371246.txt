helped me overcome the arrogance
which threatened after my 1600 sat score
and national merit scholarship
my most influential person taught me
the most important word ive learned
aloha which i
to the dean of admission
princeton university
from cristina moreno
most influential person my mother
no contest
i think i have been
pointing toward this essay
ever since the day 12 years ago in mexico
when my father left
such was my mothers need to protect me
that she would not let me see her cry
the trick was get over it
as quickly and privately as possible
such was my need to protect her
that i never let on that i could hear her
my mother kept us in mexico
as long as possible
to root me in all things latin
finally she sensed
our last opportunity for change
we would leave for america
one tear
just one
so make it a good one she said
she would be my mexico
because this admissions essay
is open record
let me just say that
our transportation into the united states
was economy class
in order to raise me properly
my mother needed as much of the security
of her own culture as possible
so we rolled through texas
just 34 hispanic
to los angeles
48 hispanic
look at the detroit pistons
and your mothers saying get up
get up honey get up but no what of it
you cant see them why
cause theyre being killed
theyre being strangled
by the psychotic raider fans
what do you have in oakland
you got a bunch of psychotic
a few minutes adrift
in an alien environment
then we turned a corner
and we were right back home
my mothers favorite cousin
monica gave us shelter
for the next six years
neither of us ventured outside
our new community
mom worked two jobs
paying a total of 450 a week
each of us doing everything we could
to make things work
we were safe and happy
if only i could have stayed six
but i was blossoming
and during my very first dance
in the time it took a boys hand
to go from my back to my bottom
it was evident
that she would have to leave her night job
to keep a watchful eye on me
within days
she was on her way to a job interview
she needed 450 from one job
and that meant
after all her time in america
finally entering a foreign land
hello
yeah hi were here for
the interview with mrs clasky
great great you made it
come on in the front doors open
and were out back okay
and call me deborah
okay
holding out had helped though
she was no longer intimidated
working for anglos now posed no problems
it would just be a job
white america beckoned
she stepped across the cultural divide
gee whiz in heaven are you okay
no dont worry im not mad
ive been looking for decoration
to put up on the glass
so people would stop walking into it
instead of taking what they had in stock
which was awful i special ordered and i
you know what

what i shouldve done in the first place
and what does that matter
when your nose is bleeding

just
there is one particular cultural difference
which i wish to explore academically
at princeton
american women i believe
actually feel the same as hispanic women
about weight
a desire for the comfort of fullness
and when that desire is suppressed for style
and deprivation allowed to rule
dieting exercising american women
left
become afraid of everything
associated with being curvaceous
such as wantonness lustfulness
left
sex
passing on the left
food
motherhood
all that is best in life
hey

she didnt even want us to know
she had a daughter

you take her kid away without even asking
i think thats a little
what
insensitive elitist
narcissistic irresponsible perverse
dizzy what
stupid
when is anyone in this damn house
in this damn life

you even told me you said that 5
i know i know i know i promised
its all coming back to me now
let me just go deal with this
cristina
oh baby
my mother wishes for me to represent
exactly what she says
nothing else
what
may i talk to you
you mean your mother
yeah sure
you can talk to me
i dont have to sleep first
whats wrong come on come on sit down
im sorry
did you give this money to my daughter
i made a deal with the kids all the kids
oh no please
you dont tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune
for looking on the beach for stones
what is the word for this
sea glass
no not a name for the stones
a name for the action what you did
oh boy engreído is gonna be rough
smug
i had no idea
it was going to amount to that much money
i thought sort of tops 50
but 50 is a lot of money
i know i know i know
oh shit
im sorry come on
i get what youre upset about
excuse me
it might not look it
but i am good at getting things
i know what its like
when you feel your kids being messed with
it wont happen again
it wont
all right
okay
its late you guys get some sleep
sleep
no
if this was small enough to be helped
by some little apology
i would be a fool to bring it up
but i need to say no matter what the result
i need to be impolite
you leave someone elses child alone
it is simple no
it is too easy for children
to feel contradiction
and it encourages questioning their parents
and that makes them feel less safe
look
your wife takes her for little tours
and she changes her hair
and you give her money
here take back the money
i didnt really mean to be angry to you
only emotional for me
what about hypocritical
yes you heard me
its not like you didnt do the same thing
no
yes you did
so why dont you go lecture yourself
you wont need a translator for that one
what am i lately a recycling bin
anybody dump in your garbage
hope i make something useful out of it
yes yes you did the same thing
you think i dont know
about you altering those outfits for bernie
she tells me her stuff
so am i missing something
is there really a difference between that
and what youre complaining about
excuse me
theres no difference i interfered
youre kidding me
its just pretty wild
to say something to somebody
and have the other person
just concede the point
im dazed here
i feel really embarrassed
and you were very right hypocrisy yes
okay that doesnt happen very often
she said that well leave
whenever it is good for you
no no no come on man
but how can i keep working for you
after we talked like this
you cant quit the job
even if you wanted to and you know why
no
yes you do
you know
why
because if you do
cristina will blame herself
for costing you the job
and that guilt
i dont know if you know about guilt
guilt sí we know were catholics
we know
we know
you cant do that to her
welcome back
goodnight
goodnight
you cant be translating for me all the time
i need to learn english now
i really wasnt supposed to translate that
listen to your mother she knows it all
learning english would cost 599 down
and 12 monthly payments of 86
which represents 22 interest
assimilation gets expensive
got it
but not a penny was wasted
food
food
i am just learning english
i am just learning english

its good right
i mean
cristina has already read on her own
every book on bernices summer reading list
and shes two grades behind her
can you imagine
if she went to bernices school
i think i could probably get her
a scholarship god knows they owe me
talk to flor
yeah shes so open to new things
wherere you going
im going out i am
its this whole anyway you know what
im probably actually gonna be in
the cell is gonna be bad
so ill just check in with you later
i just cant find my keys
good morning ms folsom
deborah

cristina this is arlene folsom
shes the school director
hi
hello a pleasure to meet you ms folsom
would you like a little tour
really
great
shes gorgeous isnt she
hispanic
we ran into the head of the school
and cristina knocked her out
i had nothing to do with it
incidentally
the scholarship is worth 20000
and early registration is tomorrow
its too far from my home
you could move in to town with us
never thank you
fine then dont
by the way the phrase is no thank you
mom was caught in a vise of manipulation
please dear god
this is the most important prayer of my life
its about my education
the health of my brain
please dear god enter my mothers heart
make her understand what this school means
hi flor
hi
want some port
no thank you evelyn
how you doing
hi
i was just leaving
okay bye
what okay
poor guy
what
nobody noticed
flor
thanks for never judging me
i love you i love everybody
thats whats killing me
may i talk with you
me
i just spoke to deborah shell be back soon
if you need to go over something
i need to really talk is okay
no
no no no sure sure sure
sure im sorry
outside
okay
you have me a little nervous here
are we ever gonna stop just asking
you know about cristina
and your private school
that
they did it
i dont know what to do
dont ask me
im worried about my own kid going there
because they keep sending her home
anxietyridden mostly over geometry
i mean you get bernice
in a decent world her school
should let her know how great she is right
you dont have to worry about bernice
nothing is going to change that heart
yeah thanks
its just
great to hear someone else
say that out loud
hard to explain
i know
im sorry i take you here and
i make too much of this right
no
you have a right to worry about this
this is the job these are the decisions
worrying about your children is sanity
and being that sane the way you are
can drive you nuts
someone like you im sorry
if you think youre at some crossroads
you are
you are
hey i wish i could help you more
i never know a man who can put himself
in my place like you do
how did you become that man
i dont know
would you get out of the damn wind
sit down
i didnt mean to i want to be helpful
it must be hard being a widow
doing it on your own
why do you think i am a widow
i guess i thought
that would be the only way
a guy would leave you
so okay are you gonna send her
i dont know
i think if i do one of two things happens
either she will be odd
odd yes
or she will make herself the same as them
i felt the same way about my kid going there
so between odd and the same
you gotta be rooting for odd dont you
yes you gotta
thank you goodnight i go to sleep
hey
you speaking english its
what
nothing
its nice meeting you
here they are
hey you guys just made it
i was getting worried
hi hi hi

i just put them in one of bernies old
ancient backpacks

firstdayatanewschool present
its just a little something
from me and bernie
its okay right come on its a big day

hey youre fast better pace yourself
you know i ran college track watch out
look theyre delivering my table
see you
i love you for trying
when people exist under one roof
a tiny society forms
the stuff of novellas
masters and servants
unconsciously dancing in lock step
so that when things go wrong
traumas converge
at mrs claskys urging i had invited
two of my friends to her house
though i was expected at home
monica had finally managed
to get her mother here from mexico
and my mother was making a party
flor deb hey sorry to call you so late
but the girls are still studying
and i gotta go out
i know that
i promised to get her back to you
so if you want me to cut off the schoolwork
thats fine whatever you want
let me think
okay you think about it
and hey listen flor if youre tired
or you want to play then just
let her sleep here tonight no
ill get her back to you in the morning
yes you can stay
you think about it call me back bye
wait i need to talk to you privately honey
honey no mother i cant right now
im really late
ive been looking all over for you
will you keep an eye on the kids
youve got my secret cell number
just give me a moment to talk here
what is it are you buzzed
no i gave up drinking weeks ago
yes nobody noticed
which shows i probably conducted myself
pretty well as a drunk
but duty called and im sober
so may i say just one thing
yes mother one thing go ahead
thank you
deborah
you are going to lose your husband
if you dont stop what you are doing
and you will never find someone as good
therell only be men
who you know are cheap and shallow
and have no real warmth in their souls
you may have gotten by
on those surfaces once but now
you have been spoiled by a good man
if you do not act quickly
you will soon cement
an awful fate for yourself
a life with no hope of repair
which has already
begun to turn desperate and dumb
thats it drive carefully
out of coffee its over for me
youve done it again mother
made me hate myself
one of the things i can count on
honey
lately your low selfesteem
is just good common sense
john
hey evelyn
better wait a minute
what the hell is wrong
nothing
can i urge you in all hopelessness
not to go in there
deb
deb deb
deb
where are you
over here
baby what
just stay there john
what what what
i suddenly get what i gotta do
but i just gotta get up the guts
is it absolutely necessary
to make it this scary
can you just say it
its not so easy
yeah come on its me we can talk
do i ever hope so
all right dont cry
or cry cry cry im sorry
come on what is it
ive been seeing another man
for the last 11 weeks
and it was nothing and i ended it tonight
at first it was just keeping an eye
on the real estate market and then it was
me being insecure and
searching for some ridiculous validation
hold on hold on hold on
im missing what youre saying
i hey are you
okay you cant keep talking
and expect me to follow it
when you start the way you did
just what did you hear
there was a crack in the planet
that was noisy
oh man
theres an actual noise in my head
no kidding
i met him about a
if you talk that fast
im not gonna hear you
theres a lot going through my mind
right now
have you said yet
whether you slept with him
no so far ive just been talking
about a flirtation its really
have you said whether you had sex
with another person
because i really am missing your words
so help me out here
ive been trying to explain
that for the first 10 weeks
you still havent said yet right
is this your way
yes yes this is my way
this is my way of asking you
whether or not you
oh man once i ask it
just give me a second
im trying to figure out
if theres a way to avoid knowing
no damn it
theres not
okay youre on
real short answer have you had
yes
really
i made up my mind that i was gonna answer
every question you had
ill answer everything and anything
and more
what other questions could there be
are you really that much nicer than me
well
you dont set the bar real high
john just wait please please just wait
john just listen i think that if you listen
to exactly what happened
and then you could do whatever you need to
just please let me tell you everything
its just flor
flor what are you doing here
i want my daughter
i want to talk to mrs clasky
i want to quit
i dont think you can do
any of that right now
i gotta
the reason i took this chance in telling
is that i want us to be good
i want us to be close
i want to feel like youre not nuts
to be in love with me
so what i think we should do
is i think we should just talk
talk until we pass out
talk until we are so sick of each other
that theres nothing left to do
but take that first step out of hell
okay so lets not leave this room
until youve heard
and said everything okay
please say okay
im sorry what
john you didnt hear me
i gotta get out of here you keep talking
wait
stay put
i dont think you want to wake her up
when youre feeling this upset
and the others are right there too
whatre you doing wherere you going
i am leaving i have finally
me too ill drive you
no
yeah its okay i dont mind
if you truly dont know why i say no
its past midnight here i can just
let me at last say the reason
ill just take you dont worry about it
have you no idea that i
ive really gotta get out of here right now

would you be willing to hang out with me
for a while
you want to hang out with me
yes
then i have to ask you
what
what does hang out mean
it means
visit
okay
ive never seen your place
very perfect
im gonna cook for you
please please please
i am glad to visit with you
if i just left the job
and never spoke with you
it would have been
sin
you understand
yeah
my hand is the only sane part of my body
every other part wants to jump off a cliff
thats it for now
i already broke my record for smooth
i dont understand
its me im not making any sense
but i can get you fed
you want a drink
no
wait i dont think you should either
then excuse me because if i had
the equipment i think id inject the vodka
i just think it is so important
that we are each clearheaded
its very good
you didnt ask why
keep things real right
i wouldnt have put it so well
okay
lets get this going here
beautiful
so tell me again
why i cant call him on his cell again
besides that he turned it off
yeah
40 messages start to look needy
mother youre enjoying this
no
well not in the way you think
you are enjoying it jesus mother
i am enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter
im enjoying the fact
that i really know how to advise you
and the miracle
that you are so deeply disoriented
that you are gobbling up everything i say
what
theres something i want to say to you
about you and me
you dont have to
no i want to
okay
thank you
you were an alcoholic
and wildly promiscuous woman
during my formative years
so that im in this fix because of you
it is your fault
i just needed that moment for us to build on
you have a solid point dear
but right now the lessons of my life
are coming in handy for you
yes
thats it thats it for you
i keep thinking i should tell you
what happened to me tonight
but i dont want to spoil this
i dont want to spoil this
i will remember every taste forever
im very glad you liked it
its something watching you
if its anything at your end
imagine over here
scratch that the last thing you want to hear
is somebody going off on your looks
dont be crazy tell me every detail
okay okay i will
they should name a gender after you
looking at you doesnt do it
staring is the only way that makes any sense
and trying not to blink
so you dont miss anything
and all of that and youre you
i mean
look forgive me
its just you are dropdead crazy gorgeous
so much so that im actually considering
looking at you again
before we finish up here
soon please
i cant we cant
i know i know
we cant do anything that brings us
any kind of satisfaction or release
but im still having a great time
my mother has often referred
to that evening at the restaurant
as the conversation of her life
ever since that night at the beach
i knew you were in a room
i just wouldnt go in there
when i hear you coming i leave
thats why we havent
seen each other a lot lately
why is everything so damn confusing
is your mind racing too
id say my mind has evaporated
feels pretty good
like happy
like happy
you think that will last
i was just kidding around
i understand what you mean
no i dont understand what i mean
that its getting late
the responsibilities
have entered your brain
dont hide that from me
dont hide that from me
please
yeah
thank you youre right
yeah
i wont youre great
youre great too
no
no
there are some mistakes you cannot risk
when you have children
please
are you ready to go
no im not im not
stay put for a sec stay there
once our feet touch that floor
im gonna get too many brain cells back
dont be in such a hurry
that floor its going to eat us alive
i love you
what
cause ive been
oh god its him
hes gotta tell me everything
no no no
no no no no
yes
no wait
do you know that right now
you are your own worst enemy
that you cant trust
one thought in your brain
then trust me
and only allow yourself
to say one thing to him
one thing
i am so glad youre back
what
yes
but i have to know whether he touched her
and where he touched her
and how he touched her
and how he felt afterwards
whether they held hands when they left
just those words if you want to have
a prayer of coming out of this
okay okay
so now i
go to him
okay
jesus do i need a little makeup
you need a hose
but you dont have the time
its fine that you look like that
its genuine you can use genuine
thank you mom
honey
its not the worst thing in the world
to find out that you love your husband
its late deborah
i just wanted to say
i cant sleep upstairs with you

yeah okay
mom

that you were back and okay and all

because
mom was crying for six hours straight
and grandma was in with her
all that time mostly saying
hell be back hell be back
i just hate that you had that kind of night
oh no i
its good for me to worry about
something that really matters
instead of the stupid stuff
thats usually on my mind
like
surviving
what
how did you come up with this
you are fantastic bernie i love you
i love you
i know
i mean not about me being fantastic
but just

wait wait wait what

cristina
goodbye mr clasky
im very sorry we wont be
seeing each other as frequently
yes
yes
flor
can i sleep at the claskys
when i stay late at school
shortly after we left
my mother told me of another decision
she had reached
i would no longer go to the private school
no
no no you cant do that to me
you cant do that to me
no you cant do that to me
you ruined everything
you ruined everything
this ruins my life youve ruined everything
i will never forgive you
no itll never be all right youre wrong
this is exactly what i was worried about
i will never be able to forgive you
i have a scholarship
and nobody gives this up
the 13 miles from the clasky house
to our bus stop
was the longest walk ill ever know
i had publicly scorned my mother
and yet she had not reacted
what did spark our climactic moment
was my use of a common american phrase
not right now i need some space
not a space between us
in the midst of confrontation
she found clarity
she expressed regret that she had to ask me
to deal with the basic question of my life
at such a young age
and then she asked it
is what you want for yourself
to become someone very different
than me
i have been overwhelmed
by your encouragement
to apply to your university
and your list of scholarships
available to me
though as i hope this essay shows
your acceptance while it would thrill me
