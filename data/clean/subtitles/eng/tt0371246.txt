helped me overcome the arrogance
which threatened after my 1 600 sat score
and national merit scholarship 
my most influential person taught me
the most important word i ve learned 
aloha  which i   
to the dean of admission 
princeton university 
from cristina moreno 
most influential person  my mother 
no contest 
i think i have been
pointing toward this essay
ever since the day  12 years ago in mexico 
when my father left 
such was my mother s need to protect me 
that she would not let me see her cry 
the trick was  get over it
as quickly and privately as possible 
such was my need to protect her 
that i never let on that i could hear her 
my mother kept us in mexico
as long as possible
to root me in all things latin 
finally  she sensed
our last opportunity for change 
we would leave for america 
 one tear 
 just one 
 so  make it a good one   she said 
she would be my mexico 
because this admissions essay
is open record 
let me just say that
our transportation into the united states
was economy class 
in order to raise me properly 
my mother needed as much of the security
of her own culture as possible 
so  we rolled through texas   
just 34  hispanic   
to los angeles 
48  hispanic 
look at the detroit pistons 
and your mother s saying   get up 
get up  honey  get up   but  no  what of it 
you can t see them  why 
 cause they re being killed 
they re being strangled
by the psychotic raider fans 
what do you have in oakland 
you got a bunch of psychotic   
a few minutes adrift
in an alien environment 
then we turned a corner 
and we were right back home 
my mother s favorite cousin 
monica  gave us shelter 
for the next six years 
neither of us ventured outside
our new community 
mom worked two jobs 
paying a total of  450 a week 
each of us doing everything we could
to make things work 
we were safe and happy 
if only i could have stayed six 
but i was blossoming 
and during my very first dance 
in the time it took a boy s hand
to go from my back to my bottom 
it was evident
that she would have to leave her night job
to keep a watchful eye on me 
within days 
she was on her way to a job interview 
she needed  450 from one job 
and that meant 
after all her time in america 
finally entering a foreign land 
hello 
yeah  hi  we re here for
the interview with mrs  clasky 
great  great  you made it 
come on in  the front door s open
and we re out back  okay 
  and call me deborah 
  okay 
holding out had helped  though 
she was no longer intimidated 
working for anglos now posed no problems 
it would just be a job 
white america beckoned 
she stepped across the cultural divide 
  gee whiz in heaven  are you okay 
  no  don t worry  i m not mad 
i ve been looking for decoration
to put up on the glass 
so people would stop walking into it 
instead of taking what they had in stock 
which was awful  i special ordered and i   
you know what 
i m just gonna design something myself 
which is
what i should ve done in the first place   
and what does that matter
when your nose is bleeding 
  oh  gosh  shut up  deborah 
  now you got it  mom 
  there s no ice pack  bern 
  so  get anything frozen 
pressure  pressure  just pressure 
take this 
is it strange that i just gave you money 
i just felt really badly 
it s okay 
chum  knock it off 
i m sorry about the way the place looks 
you know  i m hosting
a fundraiser for the school tonight 
it s just a mess  a couple hours away 
just come sit right here 
here you go  okay 
yeah  just    that s great 
yeah  just toss it 
well  she s my cousin

but  well  anyway   
she lives in the apartment i manage and   
  so  who am i interviewing 
  her

she didn t mean it as a compliment 
it s more of an accusation 
  mother

  hi

  evelyn 
do you guys want to come in out of the sun

well  it s okay 
i can talk about it  i just   
i helped run a commercial design company
up until four months ago
when it was downsized to zip 
  and now  i m a full time mom  gulp 
  double gulp 
anyway  i have two children 
my son georgie is nine  bernie you know 
and i like the house to be like me 
you know   
i m very loose
and meticulous at the same time 
but it s all about
first names and closeness here 
let her know  absolutely 
but i do care about the place 
i m so sorry 
i m not leaving you time to translate 
what s your name 
llamo  it s one of my five spanish words

that i m flunking out of right now 
what d she say 
she says if you curl your tongue
and then let it be loose 
that you ll get it

and that it s great that you try so hard 
because most people wouldn t bother 
she gets me

shit 
   and yet had done nothing 
i am running out of excuses
for the lady of the house 
but  man  bernice s final is tomorrow 
she didn t need this one 
and just the look on her face
when she got the gifts 
like for one second she thought
all her problems with her mother
had been solved 
he appeared to be a good man 
but to someone with first hand knowledge
of latin macho 
he seemed to have
the emotions of a mexican woman 
she had no idea how to react  except to flee

she was losing her battle
to remain uninvolved with the claskys

try   
just  just try it on 
just try on 
just 
  just 
  just 
there is one particular cultural difference 
which i wish to explore academically
at princeton 
american women  i believe 
actually feel the same as hispanic women
about weight 
a desire for the comfort of fullness 
and when that desire is suppressed for style
and deprivation allowed to rule 
dieting  exercising american women   
left 
   become afraid of everything
associated with being curvaceous 
such as wantonness  lustfulness   
left 
     sex   
  passing on the left 
   food 
motherhood 
all that is best in life 
hey 
hey 
yeah  well  taste  she has 
just try it on 
when did you learn to speak english 
just try it on 
it s too tight  it doesn t fit

lovely way to start the day 
the world s most trim mexican
learns her first sentence

thank you so much 
thank you  thank you  thank you 
  thank you so much for taking me there 
  gee  stop thanking me 
i really    i enjoyed having the company 
the flea market was just   
i don t know what to say  it was just   
so many things 
and you 
you knew so much about all of them 
the way you made those people
lower the prices  though 
i just think that you re   
  never mind 
  no  go ahead  i can take it 
i just think that you re   
the most amazing white woman
that i ve ever met 
that is so nice to hear 
absurd  but deeply appreciated  cristina 
oh  my gosh  thank you so much 
that was so fun 
  this was the best day ever 
  what 
did something bad happen 
cristina  tell your mother
those wash right out  it s no big deal 
not right now 
what in the    i mean   
you can t just take someone else s kid
and then take them off and   
don t go there  or i ll go there 
and you know where  there  is 
can you believe what a big deal
flor is making this into 
it s just    please  shoot me
if i ever become that hard to deal with 
  what s this 
  for you 
from 
okay  look  you are not yourself 
this was written in anger  will you hold on 
just look  sleep on it 
you still want me to have it  that s fine 
  take the letter 
  i don t think that you will 
once calm and rational thought returns 
just sleep on it 
  take the letter  deborah 
  just sleep on it 
she didn t even want us to know
she had a daughter 
and on the first day 
you take her kid away without even asking 
  i think that s a little   
  what 
insensitive  elitist 
narcissistic  irresponsible  perverse 
dizzy  what 
stupid 
when is anyone in this damn house 
in this damn life 
gonna consider my feelings 
i just tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome 
there is no reason to rake this over 
i let it go and gave flor the room to let it go 
which i m sure she has 
it s over  so  just get on board  pal 
i slept 
well  i m broke 
no  please  don t worry about it 
you really don t have to pay me 
  please  don t worry about it 
  i m just kidding  i m just kidding 
hey  so 
  when you count it up  give me a holler 
  i did count 
many  many times  i didn t sleep  i counted 
all right  what do i owe you  give it to me 
 640 
  really 
  yes 
  i m really sorry 
  no 
all right  i don t know 
how about
we figure this out tomorrow  okay 
you even told me  you said that  5   
i know  i know  i know  i promised 
it s all coming back to me now 
let me just go deal with this 
cristina 
oh  baby 
my mother wishes for me to represent
exactly what she says 
  nothing else 
  what 
  may i talk to you 
  you mean your mother 
yeah  sure 
you can talk to me 
i don t have to sleep first 
what s wrong  come on  come on  sit down 
i m sorry 
did you give this money to my daughter 
i made a deal with the kids  all the kids 
oh  no  please 
you don t tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune
for looking on the beach for stones 
  what is the word for this 
  sea glass 
no  not a name for the stones 
a name for the action  what you did 
oh  boy  engreído is gonna be rough 
smug 
i had no idea
it was going to amount to that much money 
i thought  sort of tops   50 
but  50 is a lot of money 
i know  i know  i know 
oh  shit 
i m sorry  come on 
i get what you re upset about 
excuse me 
it might not look it 
but i am good at getting things 
i know what it s like
when you feel your kid s being messed with 
it won t happen again 
it won t 
  all right 
  okay 
it s late  you guys get some sleep 
sleep 
no 
if this was small enough to be helped
by some little apology 
i would be a fool to bring it up 
but i need to say  no matter what the result 
i need to be impolite 
you leave someone else s child alone 
it is simple  no 
it is too easy for children
to feel contradiction 
and it encourages questioning their parents 
and that makes them feel less safe 
look 
your wife takes her for little tours 
and she changes her hair 
and you give her money 
here  take back the money 
i didn t really mean to be angry to you 
only emotional  for me 
what about hypocritical 
yes  you heard me 
it s not like you didn t do the same thing 
  no 
  yes  you did 
so  why don t you go lecture yourself 
you won t need a translator for that one 
what am i lately  a recycling bin 
anybody dump in your garbage 
hope i make something useful out of it 
yes  yes  you did the same thing 
you think i don t know
about you altering those outfits for bernie 
she tells me her stuff 
so  am i missing something 
is there really a difference between that
and what you re complaining about 
excuse me 
there s no difference  i interfered 
you re kidding me 
it s just pretty wild
to say something to somebody
and have the other person
just concede the point 
i m dazed here 
i feel really embarrassed 
and you were very right  hypocrisy  yes 
okay  that doesn t happen very often 
she said that we ll leave
whenever it is good for you 
no  no  no  come on  man 
but how can i keep working for you
after we talked like this 
you can t quit the job 
even if you wanted to  and you know why 
  no 
  yes  you do 
you know 
why 
because if you do 
cristina will blame herself
for costing you the job 
and that guilt 
i don t know if you know about guilt 
guilt  sí  we know  we re catholics 
  we know 
  we know 
you can t do that to her 
welcome back 
goodnight 
goodnight 
you can t be translating for me all the time 
i need to learn english now 
i really wasn t supposed to translate that 
listen to your mother  she knows it all 
learning english would cost  599 down
and 12 monthly payments of  86 
which represents 22  interest 
assimilation gets expensive 
got it 
but not a penny was wasted 
food 
food 
  i am just learning english 
  i am just learning english 
  please repeat 
  please repeat 
  neck 
  neck 
  nose 
  nose 
go  no 
okay 
it is summer   
  winter   
  winter   
  spring 
  spring 
sun 
  sunny 
  sunny 
  no 
  several 
  several 
  several 
  again 
  several 
good  several 
  too many 
  too many 
right  too many

what about the point i m making 
it s good  right 
i mean 
cristina has already read  on her own 
every book on bernice s summer reading list 
and she s two grades behind her 
can you imagine
if she went to bernice s school 
i think i could probably get her
a scholarship  god knows they owe me 
  talk to flor 
  yeah  she s so open to new things 
  where re you going 
  i m going out  i am   
it s this whole    anyway  you know what 
i m probably actually gonna be in   
the cell is gonna be bad 
so i ll just check in with you later 
i just can t find my keys 
good morning  ms  folsom 
  deborah 
  arlene  what a surprise 
this is cristina 
the girl i am always raving to you about 
cristina  this is arlene folsom 
she s the school director 
  hi 
  hello  a pleasure to meet you  ms  folsom 
  would you like a little tour 
  really 
great 
she s gorgeous  isn t she 
hispanic 
we ran into the head of the school
and cristina knocked her out 
i had nothing to do with it 
incidentally 
the scholarship is worth  20 000
and early registration is tomorrow 
it s too far from my home 
you could move in to town with us 
never  thank you 
fine  then don t 
by the way  the phrase is  no  thank you  
mom was caught in a vise of manipulation 
please  dear god 
this is the most important prayer of my life 
it s about my education 
the health of my brain 
please  dear god  enter my mother s heart 
make her understand what this school means 
  hi  flor 
  hi 
  want some port 
  no  thank you  evelyn 
  how you doing 
  hi 
i was just leaving 
okay  bye   
what  okay 
  poor guy 
  what 
nobody noticed 
flor 
thanks for never judging me 
i love you  i love everybody 
that s what s killing me 
may i talk with you 
me 
i just spoke to deborah  she ll be back soon
if you need to go over something 
i need to really talk  is okay 
  no 
  no  no  no  sure  sure  sure 
sure  i m sorry 
  outside 
  okay 
you have me a little nervous here 
are we ever gonna stop  just asking 
you know about cristina
and your private school 
that 
  they did it 
  i don t know what to do 
don t ask me 
i m worried about my own kid going there 
because they keep sending her home
anxiety ridden  mostly over geometry 
i mean  you get bernice 
in a decent world  her school
should let her know how great she is  right 
you don t have to worry about bernice 
nothing is going to change that heart 
yeah  thanks 
it s just   
   great to hear someone else
say that out loud 
hard to explain 
i know 
i m sorry  i take you here and   
  i make too much of this  right 
  no 
you have a right to worry about this 
this is the job  these are the decisions 
worrying about your children is sanity 
and being that sane  the way you are 
can drive you nuts 
someone like you  i m sorry 
if you think you re at some crossroads 
you are 
you are 
hey  i wish i could help you more 
i never know a man who can put himself
in my place like you do 
how did you become that man 
i don t know 
would you get out of the damn wind 
sit down 
i didn t mean to    i want to be helpful 
it must be hard being a widow 
doing it on your own 
why do you think i am a widow 
i guess i thought   
that would be the only way
a guy would leave you 
so  okay    are you gonna send her 
i don t know 
i think if i do  one of two things happens 
  either she will be odd 
  odd  yes 
or she will make herself the same as them 
i felt the same way about my kid going there 
so  between odd and the same 
you gotta be rooting for odd  don t you 
yes  you gotta 
  thank you  goodnight  i go to sleep 
  hey 
you speaking english  it s   
  what 
  nothing 
it s nice meeting you 
here they are 
hey  you guys just made it 
i was getting worried 
hi  hi  hi 
i picked up your books yesterday 
i just put them in one of bernie s old 
ancient backpacks 
thank you  this is gonna be a great school 
i can tell by the weight 
i got her just a little
first day at a new school present 
it s just a little something
from me and bernie 
it s okay  right  come on  it s a big day 
what did we get her 
wait  wait  wait 
  here it comes 
  wait  wait  wait  hold on

hey  you re fast  better pace yourself 
you know  i ran college track  watch out 
look  they re delivering my table 
see you 
i love you for trying 
when people exist under one roof 
a tiny society forms 
the stuff of novellas 
masters and servants
unconsciously dancing in lock step 
so that when things go wrong 
traumas converge 
at mrs  clasky s urging  i had invited
two of my friends to her house 
though i was expected at home 
monica had finally managed
to get her mother here from mexico
and my mother was making a party 
flor  deb  hey  sorry to call you so late 
but the girls are still studying
and i gotta go out 
i know that
i promised to get her back to you 
so  if you want me to cut off the schoolwork 
that s fine  whatever you want 
let me think 
okay  you think about it 
and  hey  listen  flor  if you re tired 
or you want to play  then just   
let her sleep here tonight  no 
i ll get her back to you in the morning 
yes  you can stay 
you think about it  call me back  bye 
wait  i need to talk to you privately  honey 
 honey   no  mother  i can t right now 
i m really late 
i ve been looking all over for you 
will you keep an eye on the kids 
you ve got my secret cell number 
  just give me a moment to talk here 
  what is it  are you buzzed 
no  i gave up drinking weeks ago 
yes  nobody noticed 
which shows i probably conducted myself
pretty well as a drunk 
but duty called  and i m sober 
so  may i say just one thing 
  yes  mother  one thing  go ahead 
  thank you 
deborah 
you are going to lose your husband
if you don t stop what you are doing 
and you will never find someone as good 
there ll only be men
who you know are cheap and shallow
and have no real warmth in their souls 
you may have gotten by
on those surfaces once  but now 
you have been spoiled by a good man 
if you do not act quickly 
you will soon cement
an awful fate for yourself 
a life with no hope of repair 
which has already
begun to turn desperate and dumb 
that s it  drive carefully 
out of coffee  it s over for me 
you ve done it again  mother 
made me hate myself 
one of the things i can count on 
honey 
lately  your low self esteem
is just good common sense 
  john 
  hey  evelyn 
better wait a minute 
  what the hell is wrong 
  nothing 
can i urge you  in all hopelessness 
not to go in there 
deb 
deb  deb 
deb 
  where are you 
  over here 
baby  what 
  just stay there  john 
  what  what  what 
i suddenly get what i gotta do 
but i just gotta get up the guts 
is it absolutely necessary
to make it this scary 
can you just say it 
it s not so easy 
yeah  come on  it s me  we can talk 
  do i ever hope so 
  all right  don t cry 
or cry  cry  cry  i m sorry 
come on  what is it 
i ve been seeing another man
for the last 11 weeks 
and it was nothing and i ended it tonight 
at first  it was just keeping an eye
on the real estate market  and then it was
me being insecure and
searching for some ridiculous validation 
hold on  hold on  hold on 
i m missing what you re saying 
i    hey  are you   
okay  you can t keep talking
and expect me to follow it
when you start the way you did 
just what did you hear 
there was a crack in the planet 
that was noisy 
oh  man 
there s an actual noise in my head 
no kidding 
i met him about a   
if you talk that fast 
i m not gonna hear you 
there s a lot going through my mind
right now 
have you said yet 
whether you slept with him 
no  so far  i ve just been talking
about a flirtation  it s really   
have you said whether you had sex
with another person 
because i really am missing your words 
so help me out here 
i ve been trying to explain
that for the first 10 weeks   
you still haven t said yet  right 
  is this your way   
  yes  yes  this is my way 
this is my way of asking you
whether or not you   
oh  man  once i ask it   
just give me a second 
i m trying to figure out
if there s a way to avoid knowing 
no  damn it 
there s not 
okay  you re on 
  real short answer  have you had   
  yes 
really 
i made up my mind that i was gonna answer
every question you had 
i ll answer everything  and anything 
and more 
what other questions could there be 
are you really that much nicer than me 
well 
you don t set the bar real high 
john  just wait  please  please  just wait 
john  just listen  i think that if you listen
to exactly what happened
and then you could do whatever you need to 
just please let me tell you everything 
it s just flor 
flor  what are you doing here 
i want my daughter 
i want to talk to mrs  clasky 
i want to quit 
i don t think you can do
any of that right now 
i gotta 
the reason i took this chance in telling
is that i want us to be good 
i want us to be close 
i want to feel like you re not nuts
to be in love with me 
so  what i think we should do
is i think we should just talk 
talk until we pass out 
talk until we are so sick of each other 
that there s nothing left to do
but take that first step out of hell 
okay  so  let s not leave this room
until you ve heard
and said everything  okay 
please  say okay 
i m sorry  what 
john  you didn t hear me 
i gotta get out of here  you keep talking 
  wait 
  stay put 
i don t think you want to wake her up
when you re feeling this upset
and the others are right there  too 
what re you doing  where re you going 
  i am leaving  i have finally   
  me  too  i ll drive you 
  no 
  yeah  it s okay  i don t mind 
  if you truly don t know why i say no   
  it s past midnight here  i can just   
     let me at last say the reason 
  i ll just take you  don t worry about it 
have you no idea that i   
i ve really gotta get out of here  right now 
go 
goodbye  chum 
  goodbye 
  wait  i m taking you 
no  why 
because  if i don t 
i ll worry about you all night long 
i can t handle that right now 
come on  come on  in  come on 
get in the car 
john 
  i quit this job 
  i quit this job 
i think i meant that for someone else 
i m sorry 
  sorry  very sorry 
  that is the bus stop 
  bye 
  wait  don t go 
would you be willing to hang out with me
for a while 
  you want to hang out with me 
  yes 
  then i have to ask you   
  what 
what does  hang out  mean 
it means   
visit 
okay 
i ve never seen your place 
very perfect 
i m gonna cook for you 
please  please  please 
i am glad to visit with you 
if i just left the job
and never spoke with you 
it would have been   
   sin 
you understand 
yeah 
my hand is the only sane part of my body 
every other part wants to jump off a cliff 
that s it for now 
i already broke my record for smooth 
  i don t understand 
  it s me  i m not making any sense 
but i can get you fed 
  you want a drink 
  no 
wait  i don t think you should  either 
then  excuse me  because if i had
the equipment  i think i d inject the vodka 
i just think it is so important
that we are each clear headed 
it s very good 
you didn t ask why 
keep things real  right 
i wouldn t have put it so well 
okay 
let s get this going here 
beautiful 
so  tell me again
why i can t call him on his cell again 
besides that he turned it off 
  yeah 
  40 messages start to look needy 
  mother  you re enjoying this 
  no 
well  not in the way you think 
you are enjoying it  jesus  mother 
i am enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter 
i m enjoying the fact
that i really know how to advise you   
and the miracle
that you are so deeply disoriented 
that you are gobbling up everything i say 
what 
there s something i want to say to you
about you and me 
  you don t have to 
  no  i want to 
  okay 
  thank you 
you were an alcoholic
and wildly promiscuous woman
during my formative years 
so that i m in this fix because of you 
it is your fault 
i just needed that moment for us to build on 
you have a solid point  dear 
but right now  the lessons of my life
are coming in handy for you 
yes 
that s it  that s it for you 
i keep thinking i should tell you
what happened to me tonight 
but i don t want to spoil this 
i don t want to spoil this 
i will remember every taste forever 
i m very glad you liked it 
it s something  watching you 
if it s anything at your end 
imagine over here 
scratch that  the last thing you want to hear
is somebody going off on your looks 
don t be crazy  tell me every detail 
okay  okay  i will 
they should name a gender after you 
looking at you doesn t do it 
staring is the only way that makes any sense 
and trying not to blink 
so you don t miss anything 
and all of that  and you re you 
i mean   
look  forgive me 
it s just you are drop dead  crazy gorgeous 
so much so  that i m actually considering
looking at you again
before we finish up here 
soon  please 
  i can t  we can t 
  i know  i know 
we can t do anything that brings us
any kind of satisfaction or release 
but i m still having a great time 
my mother has often referred
to that evening at the restaurant
as the conversation of her life 
ever since that night at the beach 
i knew you were in a room 
i just wouldn t go in there 
when i hear you coming  i leave 
that s why we haven t
seen each other a lot lately 
why is everything so damn confusing 
is your mind racing  too 
i d say my mind has evaporated 
feels pretty good 
like happy 
like happy 
you think that will last 
  i was just kidding around 
  i understand what you mean 
no  i don t understand what i mean 
that it s getting late 
the responsibilities
have entered your brain 
don t hide that from me 
don t hide that from me 
  please 
  yeah 
  thank you  you re right 
  yeah 
i won t  you re great 
you re great  too 
no 
no 
there are some mistakes you cannot risk
when you have children 
please 
  are you ready to go 
  no  i m not  i m not 
stay put for a sec  stay there 
once our feet touch that floor 
i m gonna get too many brain cells back 
don t be in such a hurry 
that floor  it s going to eat us alive 
  i love you 
  what 
 cause i ve been   
oh  god  it s him 
he s gotta tell me everything 
no  no  no 
  no  no  no  no 
  yes 
no  wait 
do you know that right now 
you are your own worst enemy 
that you can t trust
one thought in your brain 
then trust me
and only allow yourself
to say one thing to him 
one thing 
 i am so glad you re back  
  what 
  yes 
but i have to know whether he touched her 
and where he touched her 
and how he touched her 
and how he felt afterwards 
whether they held hands when they left 
just those words  if you want to have
a prayer of coming out of this 
okay  okay 
  so  now i   
  go to him 
okay 
  jesus  do i need a little makeup 
  you need a hose 
but you don t have the time 
it s fine that you look like that 
it s genuine  you can use genuine 
  thank you  mom 
  honey 
it s not the worst thing in the world
to find out that you love your husband

i m very sorry we won t be
seeing each other as frequently 
yes 
yes 
flor   
can i sleep at the claskys 
when i stay late at school 
shortly after we left 
my mother told me of another decision
she had reached 
i would no longer go to the private school 
no 
no  no  you can t do that to me 
you can t do that to me 
no  you can t do that to me 
you ruined everything 
you ruined everything 
this ruins my life  you ve ruined everything 
i will never forgive you 
no  it ll never be all right  you re wrong 
this is exactly what i was worried about 
i will never be able to forgive you 
i have a scholarship 
and nobody gives this up 
the 1 3 miles from the clasky house
to our bus stop
was the longest walk i ll ever know 
i had publicly scorned my mother 
and yet she had not reacted 
what did spark our climactic moment
was my use of a common american phrase 
not right now  i need some space 
not a space between us 
in the midst of confrontation 
she found clarity 
she expressed regret that she had to ask me
to deal with the basic question of my life
at such a young age 
and then she asked it 
 is what you want for yourself
 to become someone very different
 than me  
i have been overwhelmed
by your encouragement
to apply to your university
and your list of scholarships
available to me 
though  as i hope this essay shows 
your acceptance  while it would thrill me
