i said
move it out of there
what for
come here sister
lets take a ride
detective get down
beat it
you too sister
come here
there you go doll
something to remember me by
you know when im not doing
this im a scout for the movies
really
join hands
well freeze here
no youll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes
why do we
need this
because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction
because there is no federal
police force to stop them
by my tally your
bureau wants to spend
more taxpayers dollars
catching crooks
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place
well thats ridiculous
the bureau has apprehended
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have
stolen up to and in excess of really
how many have you
apprehended
we have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons
no i mean you director
hoover how many
well as director
i administer
how many have you
arrested personally
i have never
arrested anybody
youve never
arrested anybody
well of course not
i am an administrator
with no field experience
you are shockingly
unqualified arent you sir
you have never
personally conducted
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life
i think youre a front
i think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth
created from the hoopla of headlines
by mr suydam your publicist there
crimebusters gmen youre
setting yourself up as a czar
thats running wild
in my estimation
a crime is what
runs wild
if this country requires
a bureau such as yours
i question whether you are
the person fit to run it
well i will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians
your appropriation
increase is denied
feed the following
to walter winchell
mckellar is a neanderthal and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me
we will not contest him
in his committee room
we will fight him
on the front page
where is john dillinger
agent purvis
congratulations
thank you sir
may i ask why
theyre ready for him
this is henry suydam he is
our expert in press relations
congratulations
for pretty boy floyd
for which you have
my personal gratitude

as of this moment
the special agent in charge
of the chicago field office
are you up to that
task agent purvis

states of americas first war on crime

wave sweeping america
his task will be to get public
enemy number one john dillinger
director

run down pretty boy floyd

right now youre
too inquisitive buddy
put your arm
around dillinger
hey when was the last time
you were in mooresville
ten years ago
i was a wild boy and
well i was foolish
i held up a grocery store
which i never should have done
cause mr morgan was a good man
and they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a 50 theft
when i was in prison
i met a lot of good fellows
so sure yeah
i helped set up the break
at michigan city why not
i stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me
johnny how long does it
take you to go through a bank
oh about one minute
40 seconds
flat
lets go
mr johnny
your lawyers here
you come highly
recommended by alvin karpis
at the arraignment
theyre gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen
what can you do for me
whats on your mind
the electric chair
your honor are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation
or is the state to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice
the very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice
the clanging of shackles
brings to our minds
the dungeons of the czars
not the flagbedecked liberty
of an american courtroom
i request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith
this is a very dangerous
man your honor
and im responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner
are you a lawyer what right do
you have to address this court
all right remove the
shackles from the prisoner
your honor we would like
to relocate the prisoner
only indiana state
penitentiary in michigan city
can guarantee
dillinger will not escape
sheriff holley
i concur your honor
sheriff holley i think this is a
very nice jail you have right here
what makes you think theres
something wrong with it
theres nothing
wrong with my jail
its the strongest jail
in indiana
thats what i thought
but of course i dont want
to embarrass mrs holley
i appreciate shes a woman
and shes afraid of an escape
oh no im not afraid
of an escape
i can take care of john
dillinger or any other prisoner
okay
dillinger will stay here
piquett thank you
your honor
the defense will need four
months to prepare itself
it should take 10 days
to go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad
theres a law
against lynching
theres a law
against murder
then observe
the law part
or just stand dillinger
up against a wall
and shoot him
just shoot him
then theres no need to throw away
the states money on this mockery
calm down
i apologize to the court
bob and i respect
each other very much
watch out or hell be putting
his arm around you too
