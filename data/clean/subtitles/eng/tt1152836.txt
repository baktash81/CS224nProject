move it out of there 
what for 
come here  sister 
let s take a ride 
detective  get down 
beat it 
you  too  sister 
come here 
there you go  doll 
something to remember me by 
you know  when i m not doing
this  i m a scout for the movies 
really 
join hands 
we ll freeze here 
no  you ll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes 
why do we
need this 
because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines 
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction
because there is no federal
police force to stop them 
by my tally  your
bureau wants to spend
more taxpayers  dollars
catching crooks
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place 
well  that s ridiculous 
the bureau has apprehended
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have
stolen up to and in excess of    really 
how many have you
apprehended 
we have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons 
no  i mean you  director
hoover  how many 
well  as director 
i administer 
how many have you
arrested personally 
i have never
arrested anybody 
you ve never
arrested anybody 
well  of course not 
i am an administrator 
with no field experience 
you are shockingly
unqualified  aren t you  sir 
you have never
personally conducted
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life 
i think you re a front 
i think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth
created from the hoopla of headlines
by mr  suydam  your publicist there 
crimebusters  g men  you re
setting yourself up as a czar 
that s running wild
in my estimation 
a crime is what
runs wild 
if this country requires
a bureau such as yours 
i question whether you are
the person fit to run it 
well  i will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians 
your appropriation
increase is denied 
feed the following
to walter winchell 
mckellar is a neanderthal  and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me 
we will not contest him
in his committee room 
we will fight him
on the front page 
where is john dillinger 
agent purvis 
congratulations 
thank you  sir 
may i ask why 
they re ready for him 
this is henry suydam  he is
our expert in press relations 
congratulations
for pretty boy floyd

my personal gratitude

wave sweeping america 
his task will be to get public
enemy number one  john dillinger

right before they go 
and then they just
drift away into nothing 
that ll keep
you up nights 
and what keeps you up
nights  mr  dillinger 
coffee 
you act like a confident
man  mr  purvis 
you got a few qualities 
probably pretty good
from a distance 
especially when you got
the fellow outnumbered 
but up close 
toe to toe 
when somebody s about to
die right here  right now 
i m used to that 
what about you 
goodbye  mr  dillinger 
i ll see you
down the road 
no  you will not 
the only way that you
will leave a jail cell
is when we take you out
to execute you 
well  we ll see
about that 
you ought to get yourself
another line of work  melvin 
hey  i was just kidding 
i believe i m gonna let you
boys keep me here a while 
we d like that  johnny  but
don t get too comfortable 
they re moving you 
where to 
indiana 
why 
i have absolutely nothing
i want to do in indiana 
he s here 
back up  fellas 
back up 
we ll take custody now 
take the manacles off 
are you glad
to see indiana again 
about as glad as indiana
is to see me  i suppose 
did you smuggle the guns into
indiana state penitentiary
for the big break
of september 26th 
right now  you re
too inquisitive  buddy 
put your arm
around dillinger 
hey  when was the last time
you were in mooresville 
ten years ago 
i was a wild boy  and 
well  i was foolish 
i held up a grocery store 
which i never should have done
 cause mr  morgan was a good man 
and they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a  50 theft 
when i was in prison 
i met a lot of good fellows 
so sure  yeah 
i helped set up the break
at michigan city  why not 
i stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me 
johnny  how long does it
take you to go through a bank 
oh  about one minute 
40 seconds 
flat 
let s go 
mr  johnny 
your lawyer s here 
you come highly
recommended by alvin karpis 
at the arraignment 
they re gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen 
what can you do for me 
what s on your mind 
the electric chair 
your honor  are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation
or is the state to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice 
the very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice 
the clanging of shackles
brings to our minds
the dungeons of the czars 
not the flag bedecked liberty
of an american courtroom 
i request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith 
this is a very dangerous
man  your honor 
and i m responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner 
are you a lawyer  what right do
you have to address this court 
all right  remove the
shackles from the prisoner 
your honor  we would like
to relocate the prisoner 
only indiana state
penitentiary in michigan city
can guarantee
dillinger will not escape 
sheriff holley 
i concur  your honor 
sheriff holley  i think this is a
very nice jail you have right here 
what makes you think there s
something wrong with it 
there s nothing
wrong with my jail 
it s the strongest jail
in indiana 
that s what i thought 
but of course  i don t want
to embarrass mrs  holley 
i appreciate she s a woman
and she s afraid of an escape 
oh  no  i m not afraid
of an escape 
i can take care of john
dillinger or any other prisoner 
okay 
dillinger will stay here 
piquett  thank you 
your honor 
the defense will need four
months to prepare itself 
it should take 10 days 
to go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad 
there s a law
against lynching 
there s a law
against murder 
then observe
the law part 
or just stand dillinger
up against a wall
and shoot him 
just shoot him 
then there s no need to throw away
the state s money on this mockery 
calm down 
i apologize to the court 
bob and i respect
each other very much 
watch out or he ll be putting
his arm around you  too 
trial starts in one
month on march 12th 
attaboy  counselor
