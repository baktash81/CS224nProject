you always ruin everything   
oh  no 
cloe 
oh  my gosh 
i am so sorry 
oh  no  you didn t 
jade  you totally did that on purpose 
oh  my gosh 
my hair 
sasha  you stupid    cheerleader 
you did not just say that 
keep talking 
someday you ll say something intelligent 
you know what 
you re not as bad as people say you are 
you re worse 
food fight 
yasmin  you   
cloe  this is all your fault 
get down here 
take that 
oh  my gosh 
no  jade 
  oh  my gosh 
  here  want some of this 
enough already 
oh  my gosh 
hey  make a hole 
principal dimly coming through 
move it 
principal dimly s coming through 
oh  hi  daddy 
lookie 
i want to know who did this 
or i m going to   
i m going to pass this over
to vice principal sludge 
rollo  you take over 
it s the four girls lying next
to the statue  hello 
you  you  you  and you 
detention 
you started it  clumsy 
i tripped 
excuse me  princess perfect 
that is so like you 
you ve always been the queen of denial 
you know what 
neither one of you ever thinks
anything through 
it s always me having
to pick up the pieces 
that s interesting 
we haven t talked in two years 
ever since you dumped us
to be queen of the dorks 
me 
you haven t spoken to any of us
since you went all cheerleader 
i m not a snob  i m just better
than you are  yeah 
i didn t stop talking to you 
you stopped talking to me 
what re you talking about  sasha 
at least we don t buy our friends
with our daddy s bank account 
only because you don t have a dad
or a bank account 
stop it 
all of you  just stop it 
i can t believe
you said that to cloe 
that s okay 
no  it s not 
when your parents got divorced 
cloe and her mom were
totally there for you 
don t forget that  sasha 
cloe 
i m sorry 
can t believe i said that 
what happened to us 
  it s okay 
  we were a team 
we always had each other s backs 
seriously  like when you
canceled your ski trip
to help cloe study for finals 
that s what friends do 
what about you  yas 
remember  you completely
crushed those girls
that used to slam jade
before she grew into her ears 
well  she would ve done
the same for me  big deal 
it is a big deal 
friendship is a big deal 
why aren t we friends anymore 
i can t even remember 
it s the cliques 
we re all in them 
that s just how high school works 
sasha  you re a cheerleader 
cloe s a jock 
and jade  you spend your time between
the science and home ec geeks 
they re not geeks 
they re really interesting people 
yeah  but i would never know that
because i m not in your clique 
so    what do we do 
we have to take control
of our lives  of our friendships 
it s our own fault 
we can be friends with each other
and do our own thing  right 
okay  how 
we be ourselves 
just like we used to be 
i miss my girls 
me  too 
i didn t realize
how much until now 
bffs 
bffs 
  you smell like pasta 
  so do you 
i can t believe them 
this is all your fault  cameron 
because if you hadn t walked over
and talked to that soccer joke 
i wouldn t have had to take action 
and then daddy s bust
would not have been broken 
and those bimbettes wouldn t be
in detention and back together
creating anarchy in my kingdom 
thanks a lot 
well  if all else fails  i can use this 
meredith 
i don t think this  you know 
calls for the jump drive  meredith 
maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow 
 maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow  
moron 
let s go 
i can t stand to look at this 
so tell me  chica  why so happy 
is there a boy 
come on  you ve been
holding out on me 
there s no boy  bubbie 
it s sasha  jade  and cloe 
we re a team again 
i mean  everyone at school
is only friends with
the people in their group 
but we ve decided to be
friends with everyone 
well  you girls are
doing the right thing 
you walk into school

you walk in with your
heads held high

so what s the latest
and greatest 
same old  same old 
i just wish my parents
could see who i really am 
  the worst 
  you know  it s not that bad 
it just means
i spend a lot of time
changing clothes
in skinny bathrooms 
that s so weird 
fashion s like your superpower 
you shouldn t have to hide it 
please  that s like a textbook
definition of superpower 
it s a thing in your life
that you re really amazing at 
but you hide it from the world
so people will think you re normal 
and you  yas 
i started writing some music 
and yes  it s sounding pretty good 
and no  you can t hear it 
  stage fright 
  yeah 
but  sasha  i mean  it s really
been about missing you guys 
speaking of guys  whoa 
  whoo 
  i know  right 
yas  look who s walking by
sporting some bad jeans
and looking fine 
oh  my gosh 
he totally just checked you out 
did you see that  he s into you 
what  dylan 
are you kidding me 
he hates me 
besides  he is totally not my type 
oh  you have a type 
come on  guys 
dylan is not the least bit
interested in me 
omg  it s so obvious 
okay  you are so wrong 
he never looks me in the eye 
he s never asked me out 
and he can never
even remember my name 
oh  my god 
he s crazy about me 
promise we ll never let anything
break us up ever again 
pinky swear 
pinky swear 
i love myspace 
yeah  that s much 
next 
hello  i am magnificent mike 
watch as i place my assistant
into the sword box of death 
prepare to be amazed 
great 
you re in 
thank you very much  next 
if i see one more violin
playing contortionist 
i m going to scream  next 
i think we re making this too complicated 
i mean  if we wanna be friends 
we should just be friends 
i totally agree 
i mean  we walk to school 
and we lead by example 
come on 
yo  cloe  come to us 
serious 
oh  hey  jade 
come here  check this out 
i m sorry 
hey  sasha

operation mingle 
beautiful

no  straighten your legs 
see  like  don t you have
any fancy pair of sneakers
in your yasmin collection

  trust me 
hey  dexter 
salutations  jade 
hey  nerd 
why is she talking to you 
jade  she s my lab partner 
hey  hottie 
i bet you and i could do
a lab experiment
without the bunsen burner 
you feel me 
ugh 
i think it behooves you to extend
an apology to the lady 
i don t know what you just said 
but i think you better
mind your own business 
oh  you re gonna cry 
now  would you like to apologize to the lady 
sorry  jade 
dude  you ever think
about playing football 
okay  so  x   y   z
divided by 3 is 
okay 
let s try this 
i think this might make more sense 
oh  yeah 
what s a touchdown 
six 
  plus an extra point 
  one 
plus a safety 
two 
divided by a field goal 
three 
it s good 
number 1 
who s number 1 
killer rip 
thanks 
but i think with a little adjustment 
it d be a whole lot better 
power comes from your core 
like this 
see  all right 
  all right 
  try one 
you may want to move  just in case 
i m good 
okay

i m afraid that s not up to me 
we had a real chemistry  jade 
i m not doing it

in your best interests
to drop out of the talent show 
or i ll be forced to go public
with all these embarrassing flaws
that i have right here
on your friends 
sasha  jade 
and particularly clover 
cloe 
same thing 
i m pretty sure cloe wouldn t want
the entire student body
to know that when
her mother worked for us 
things just disappeared 
poor girl  how terribly pitiful 
you are so devious 
thank you 
i mean  i hate to do it 
but you can certainly see
my predicament  and yours

how pathetic 
i can t believe you 
you spend half your time
documenting dirt on everyone else 
you really need to get a life

is that i m almost getting
kicked off of my soccer team
and you  you re the one dropping out

you don t wanna talk about it 
can we talk about the fact
that my grades have dropped

yas  we want to do
the talent show with you
