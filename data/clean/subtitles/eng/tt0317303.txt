the doctor says its just a phase but
it kept him out of chapman
jerks
put that mouse down

you guys being fulltime dads
were real giants among men
you are you should be proud
most guys dont know who their kids are
joe still hasnt found anything
no and hes driving me crazy
i should go back to work
but what about nicky
dead mouse
theres no good alternative to chapman
if someone opened a decent day care
program here theyd make a killing
nicky what did i say about the cat poop
what
a day care center you and me
its a completely underserved market
harridan has a monopoly on this suburb
all we have to do is come in

ill be just as careful with them
as i am with ben
dont be rubbing your head into stuff
watch where youre walking
what about when you get a real job
just leave the parents hanging
well cross that bridge when we get to it
it wont be permanent
we wont get rich from this
but it might keep us out of bankruptcy
i dont know charlie

okay safety gates
at the bottom of the stairs
top of the stairs bedrooms bathrooms
ive gone safety gate crazy
how many kids have we got
ive lost track they run so fast
you can get started on this batch over here
its getting late lets just call it a night
we cant call it a night
we got a bunch of kids coming
in five hours
im serious we know nothing
about running a day care center
we dont know anything
were not even good parents
im a good parent
what does that mean
what
that thing what is that
you know that rocket ship thing you do
ben doesnt even like that
that just happens to be bens favorite thing
he lets you do it because you like it
its the one time you pay him attention
you dont change your kids diapers
i dont like diapers
you should teach your kid
how to go to the toilet and aim
so we dont have to redecorate the place
when he goes
youre right
let me tell you something
my kid is 4 years old
and for the first time today
i saw him playing with the other kids
just being a normal kid
it felt great knowing
i had something to do with it
we did that
if we can do that we can definitely
get this place up to code by dawn
lets go safety gate crazy
dont worry hell be fine
its all right
all i got is 5
i can break that
listen i left the paperwork
on the kitchen table its not there
please tell me you have it
i dont have it
hey guys
marvin what are you doing here
the door was unlocked
i got your final paychecks here
thanks
so whats going on here
dont even ask
you can understand him
yeah hes speaking klingon
thats klingon
i thought the kid was an idiot
god how much star trek
does that kid watch
too much
the guy from child services is here
sorry
no listen why dont you do me a favor
why dont you take the kids in the back
and play with them
keep their attention for a while
while i talk to this guy
whatever you do dont let this big bruiser
get near the lawnmower thanks
mr kubitz hi
i thought i was early but
i was just getting the paperwork
great
you dropped something
yeah
the kids wanted to help out
thats sweet
so heres everything for you
what ill need is your signature
on the back of her head
and on the elbow of this kid
do you have a pen
i do have a pen
this is my lucky pen
thank you
and wheres on the
initial the elbow
sign the back of her head
on her neck
great that should just about do it
here we go
youre ready to roll
lets go in and get started
well you know
everything looks okay here
but it says here
that you now have 11 children
thats correct
so i assume that youve hired
a third care provider
why would you just assume that
well section 768 of the child welfare code
specifically states
that the ratio of children to care providers
cannot exceed 51
the 76804
76804
the ratio thingy
we resolved that this morning
good
yes
we hired someone we hired marvin
marvin was hired hes with the kids
hes an excellent childcare worker
id love to take a look
if thats okay with you
you want to go out there
itll be good for me to see for myself
lets go and have a look at marvin
now put your hands up now wave them
he certainly seems like
he knows what hes doing
of course
ive got to say that
yeah we interviewed a lot of people
yeah it was a really long grueling
singlingout process
and now im a chicken
im a bird look im a bird
you can never be too careful
when it comes to kids
and here at daddy day care well only work
with the best so we got marvin
sorry
what did you do to these kids
what
are they on drugs
well theres this one kid maybe
howd you get them to behave like this
got to know how to handle them
how do you know that
i read
dr spocks baby and child care book
its not about star trek
finish
yeah
you know when i was in the back
i spotted under the eaves of the porch
what looked like a beehive
a big one
dont worry all taken care of
i dont want anybody getting hurt
no hurt gone
you really have turned this around
thank you very much
im impressed i really am
thank you
for our own curiosity
any chance you could
tell us where the complaint came from
i really would love to
but i have a relationship with the state
just for our own curiosity
that was miss harridan
im sure shell see us
we need to talk to you
sorry they just barged right in
thats quite all right jenny
gentlemen please sit down
now what can i do for you
we wanted to thank you for helping
to expedite our accreditation process
thanks to your tip somebody
from child services came to see us
i had heard you opened
some sort of day care program
and i was concerned
thats nice of you
you dont have to be concerned about us
its not you im concerned about
its the children youre looking after
wait a minute were parents thats a start
any boob can be a parent
if you want to screw up your own child
thats your right
but when it comes to other peoples kids
theres a higher standard to answer to
mr kubitz seems to think that we met
that standard show her the thing
that piece of paper doesnt impress me
were getting it laminated
you two are just some flybynight
operation looking to make a fast buck
youre just afraid of the competition
lets go
competition dont flatter yourselves
daddy day care will never be
in the same league as this institution
laminated
that wasnt as satisfying as i thought
i think we can take her all we need
is some garlic and a wooden stake
you know what she said that was right

and just between you and i
the pay wasnt that bad either

mrs plager i cannot continue

highly addictive behavior

i guess we know who that came from
i understand that youve acquired
three more children since my last visit

if mr kubitz played with you guys
while we had an important conversation

tony have a cookie have a fresh one
what are you talking about i do love you
im just not in love with you
what are you talking about i do love you
im just not in love with you
fifteen months of therapy
thats the best you can do
that is the dumbest line i have ever heard
my mother was right about you
wait
for what you think this will change
you think ill change
you think this is what i had in mind
being a 55yearold man
living with his mother
you think thats my idea of a good time
i love passiveaggressive losers
according to state regulations
a childcare center in a family home
is limited to a maximum of 12 children
we have plenty of room here for these kids
i dont make the rules i enforce them
you cant have more than 12 kids
at this kind of location
so if we want to stay in business
we have to fire two kids
unless you want to move to a permanent
facility somewhere else then yes
so who do we cut loose
how about becca and jamie
i cant do it
we got to do something
why dont we get a bigger space
space the final frontier
im serious harridan said were not real
lets get real
lets get a bigger space more kids
hire more people
and give this woman a run for her money
great lets get a new space
yeah final frontier
if you dont stop with that star trek
ill push you in that sticker bush stop
no im saying that there is a space available
called the final frontier
this used to be my home away from home
jerry the guy who owned this place
had the ultimate collection of memorabilia
you know what he had tricorder
that ensign riley wore
in the doomsday machine
yeah i never saw that episode
i was with him not watching also
needs a lot of work
that just means we can fix it up
how we want to fix it up
but well need some money to do that
to make money you got to spend money
to spend money you got to have money
rock for daddy day care
help us finance our new permanent home
do you know what this means
its a chance to improve ourselves
through a little healthy competition
no you bubbleheaded idiot
its a death sentence
if they get their hands
on a big enough space theyll ruin me
theyre selling fun i cant compete with fun
i shouldve crushed them
in the beginning when they were weak
itll be harder now but i have no choice
ive got to stop them
how are you gonna do that
by any means necessary
yeah ride the pony
pet the goat
get a tshirt made something to eat
enjoy the music
theyre showing logans run friday

you can take a look at the numbers
you think about it
then you get back to me
yeah
yi okay great
you say hi to the wife and daughter son
let me guess you couldnt get
child services to come back
so youre doing the inspection
i apologize i dont like to be sneaky
still rules are rules
may i come in ive a proposition for you
yeah please do
can i get you some coffee or tea or water
or eye of newt maybe
water would be lovely
thank you
water thats an easy one
you dont mind tap water do you
were out of the bottled water
so miss harridan why are you here
you seem smart talented highly ambitious
what on earth are you doing
running a day care center
maybe i enjoy running a day care center
obviously but is this really how you want
to spend the rest of your life
as a businessman
youd have money power respect
you going to throw that all away
to babysit a bunch of 3yearolds
i said id listen to your proposition
im all ears and i got other things to do
so if youd be so kind
all right here it is
if daddy day care should close
for whatever reason
ill take all your children
for the price you charge
topflight education at rockbottom prices
think about it
now wait a minute
youre blowing us off
for cottony cotton balls
no cotton candy puffs
apparently the whole thing was my idea
theyll double my salary
and let me run the division
so yes i am taking myself back
go ahead
if thats whats important to you i mean
phil and i can manage
well just find somebody else right
im going too
this is worse than
when spock betrayed kirk
on star trek v
its not like that
come back with us not in the mailroom
but to be part of our team
i dont want to be on that team
i want to be on this team
we thought a lot about this man
its a great opportunity
no this right here is a great opportunity
this business is the one that has limits
and weve reached them okay
me and phil
we got responsibilities to think about
we got futures to take into consideration
what about now what about the kids
these kids were fine before daddy day care
theyll be fine when its over
you tell yourself that charlie
i finally found a place where i fit in
where i feel like im doing something good
and you guys just
you just spoil it all
that couldnt have gone worse
if you think that went bad
wait till we tell the kids
can i go to work with you
no you cant go to work with me
but you can come visit me at work
and daddy will be home at night
and on the weekends
well still have lots of fun together
will phil and marvin still be here
no im sorry little man
they wont be around anymore
its just for a while right
then youre going to come back
and do daddy day care again
no this is from now on
daddy day care
were not doing that anymore ben
let me explain it to you like this
if daddy does this i can get money for us
and i can use that money
to take care of the house and to buy food
and clothes and toys for you to play with
ill sell all my toys
why you want to sell all your toys
if i dont have toys we dont need money
and you can stay with me
i wish it was that simple ben
the development department will have
the first samples ready by next week
okay lets kick it around
what do you think of
when you think of cotton candy
clowns
chocolate
cavities
hyperactivity cavities and dentist bills
thats what i
ive been to the other side
and ive seen firsthand
when kids eat this stuff they crash down
so hard they need an air bag
you know what
the ingredients are to these balls
puffs
theyre puffs im sorry
you know whats in here
red dye number four and sugar
you know what charlie is absolutely right
you cant ignore the reality
parents are not going to want to buy
this product for their kids
not unless those kids stomp and scream
and bang their little heads on the floor
till blood comes out of their ears
charlie you got those figures
that i gave you
yeah i got them right here
just give me a second to
we had an independent marketing firm
do some preliminary research
to sort out the core value of this product
the subjects that were tested
aged two to six
which are key branding years
charlie you want to join us
im sorry about that jim yeah
why dont you tell everybody
what the core value is
whats the most important thing
my kid
my kid jim thats the most important thing
and i think ive made a tremendous mistake
and so i quit
what are you doing to me you scared me
how was the marketing meeting
i quit
what
i quit
you quit
i quit and i feel great
you should quit with me
i should quit
you should quit right now
we just got here
you want to feel how im feeling
quit come on
quit
quit with me
you werent going to sell the carrot suit
were you the kids love that
this stuff
is not for sale
a literal reader of the text might say
a literal reader of the text might say
that goldilocks ate the porridge
because she was hungry
but what would freud say
language skills are a critical component
of childhood development
theyre part of the core curriculum
here at chapman
if youll follow me this way
on the path of life
the proper first steps are essential
with our firm guidance your children
will take those steps right here at chapman
our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine
with structure to cling to
and the right gardener to tend them
theyll grow to the sky
thats the dumbest thing i ever heard
were not talking about plants
were talking about kids
i know you dont want this woman pruning
and cutting and weeding your 3yearolds
some people are uncomfortable
with achievement
no what im uncomfortable with
is treating a little kid like its an adult
if your kids come here theyll be
miserable in four different languages
five we start portuguese in the fall
how many languages
do you listen to them in
you ever stop trying to shove knowledge
down their throat and just talk to them
listen to what they want
theyre children
they dont know what they want
yes they do know what they want
all of them and theyre all different
we took some time talked to the kids
got to know them a bit
it made a difference it helped them
please share your success
why dont you tell these people exactly
how you help their children
max over here is pottytrained now okay
i dont miss
thats right
and becca learned how to read
yes i did
and crispin is the most polite kid
youd ever want to meet
thank you charlie
you are most welcome crispin
and i made friends
thats right little man
you made some friends
as of this moment daddy day care
is back in business
dont be a fool you wont make a nickel
we might not get rich but well manage
excuse me all right
how about that
any boob can run a childcare center
it takes a family to raise some children
were going to be a family from now on
family what a laughable concept
well just laugh our way down the driveway
have a pleasant day
