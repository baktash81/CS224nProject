 y i i really need your help 
  are you potty trained

hey  guys 
  hey  peggy  how you doing 
  good 
what s going on  nicky 
he can be a little hard
to understand sometimes 
honey  go play  have a good time  have fun 
stay away from that cat poop 
   hija   what d he just say 
  god  i haven t a clue 
the doctor says it s just a phase  but   
it kept him out of chapman 
jerks 
put that mouse down 
give it to me 
what are you   
charlie  i think it s great 
you guys being full time dads 
we re real giants among men 
you are  you should be proud 
most guys don t know who their kids are 
joe still hasn t found anything 
no  and he s driving me crazy 
i should go back to work 
but what about nicky 
dead mouse 
there s no good alternative to chapman 
if someone opened a decent day care
program here  they d make a killing 
nicky  what did i say about the cat poop 
what 
a day care center  you and me 
it s a completely underserved market 
harridan has a monopoly on this suburb 
all we have to do is come in   
establish ourselves as the value alternative 
and we ll clean up 
  you think i d be good at child care 
  absolutely 
excuse me  are these your kids 
no 
  remember when you broke my yo yo 
  i did not break your yo yo 
  yes  you did 
  i did not break your yo yo 
your yo yo was broke 
you re killing me  you re really killing me 
i m home 
  you said let s do this together 
  no  daddy 
what s going on here 
a day care center  in our house 
yes  phil s apartment s only
a two bedroom place 
this is crazy on 10 different levels 
what do you both know about
running a day care 
it s not rocket science 
we applied for a license 
it couldn t be any more simple 
  daddy 
  what you want  the rocket ship 
  that s what you wanted  right 
  milk 
you wanted milk  i m sorry  he wanted milk 
rocket man needs milk when he s flying 
it s for strong bones  in case you crash 
we understand each other 
what you think about this 
we re talking about other people s kids 
do you understand that responsibility 
i ll be just as careful with them
as i am with ben 
don t be rubbing your head into stuff 
watch where you re walking 
what about when you get a real job 
just leave the parents hanging 
we ll cross that bridge when we get to it 
it won t be permanent 
we won t get rich from this 
but it might keep us out of bankruptcy 
  i don t know  charlie 
  come on  kim 
i can t just sit around here 
i got to try to do something

handing out those fliers

we have nothing to hide 
you caught us at a crazy time 
we re playing with the kids 
somebody complained about us 
so  where is the nap area 
  the nap area 
  right 
we don t have a nap area 
we just let them fall asleep
wherever they drop 
 sleep where they drop  
well  i think that should just about do it 
what s the bottom line 
well  you need to correct
the deficiencies on this form 
and also   
you need to fill out
these compliance certification documents 
who wants these  the carrot or the broccoli 
carrot 
there s a lot of stuff on here 
so we can stay open  right 
as long you ve done that by 9 00 a m 
tomorrow morning 
9 00 a m 
good luck with this 
i like what you re doing 
i d hate to be the guy to shut you down 
we d hate for you to be that guy 
i will be  don t want to be 
okay  safety gates
at the bottom of the stairs   
top of the stairs  bedrooms  bathrooms 
i ve gone safety gate crazy 
how many kids have we got 
i ve lost track  they run so fast 
you can get started on this batch over here 
  it s getting late  let s just call it a night 
  we can t call it a night 
we got a bunch of kids coming
in five hours 
i m serious  we know nothing
about running a day care center 
we don t know anything 
we re not even good parents 
i m a good parent 
  what does that mean 
  what 
that thing  what is that 
you know that rocket ship thing you do 
ben doesn t even like that 
that just happens to be ben s favorite thing 
he lets you do it because you like it 
it s the one time you pay him attention 
  you don t change your kid s diapers 
  i don t like diapers 
you should teach your kid
how to go to the toilet and aim   
so we don t have to redecorate the place
when he goes 
you re right 
let me tell you something 
my kid is 4 years old 
and for the first time today   
i saw him playing with the other kids 
just being a normal kid 
it felt great knowing
i had something to do with it 
we did that 
if we can do that  we can definitely
get this place up to code by dawn 
let s go safety gate crazy 
don t worry  he ll be fine 
it s all right 
  all i got is  5 
  i can break that 
listen  i left the paperwork
on the kitchen table  it s not there 
please tell me you have it 
i don t have it 
  hey  guys 
  marvin  what are you doing here 
the door was unlocked 
i got your final paychecks here 
thanks 
so  what s going on here 
don t even ask 
you can understand him 
yeah  he s speaking klingon 
that s klingon 
i thought the kid was an idiot 
god  how much  star trek 
does that kid watch 
  too much 
  the guy from child services is here 
  sorry 
  no  listen  why don t you do me a favor 
why don t you take the kids in the back
and play with them 
keep their attention for a while 
while i talk to this guy 
whatever you do  don t let this big bruiser
get near the lawnmower  thanks 
  mr  kubitz  hi 
  i thought i was early  but   
  i was just getting the paperwork 
  great 
  you dropped something 
  yeah 
  the kids wanted to help out 
  that s sweet 
so here s everything for you 
what i ll need is your signature
on the back of her head 
and on the elbow of this kid 
  do you have a pen 
  i do have a pen 
  this is my lucky pen 
  thank you 
  and where s on the   
  initial the elbow 
  sign the back of her head 
  on her neck 
  great  that should just about do it 
  here we go 
  you re ready to roll 
  let s go in and get started 
well  you know 
everything looks okay here   
but it says here
that you now have 11 children 
that s correct 
so i assume that you ve hired
a third care provider 
why would you just assume that 
well  section 768 of the child welfare code
specifically states   
that the ratio of children to care providers
cannot exceed 5 1 
  the 768 04 
  768 04 
the ratio thingy 
we resolved that this morning 
  good 
  yes 
we hired someone  we hired marvin 
  marvin was hired  he s with the kids 
  he s an excellent child care worker 
i d love to take a look 
if that s okay with you 
  you want to go out there 
  it ll be good for me to see for myself 
let s go and have a look at marvin 
now  put your hands up  now  wave them 
he certainly seems like
he knows what he s doing 
of course 
  i ve got to say that 
  yeah  we interviewed a lot of people 
yeah  it was a really long  grueling
singling out process 
and now  i m a chicken 
i m a bird  look  i m a bird 
you can never be too careful
when it comes to kids 
and here at daddy day care we ll only work
with the best  so we got marvin 
sorry 
  what did you do to these kids 
  what 
  are they on drugs 
  well  there s this one kid  maybe 
how d you get them to behave like this 
  got to know how to handle them 
  how do you know that 
i read
 dr  spock s baby and child care  book 
it s not about  star trek  
  finish 
  yeah 
you know  when i was in the back   
i spotted  under the eaves of the porch   
what looked like a beehive 
  a big one 
  don t worry  all taken care of 
  i don t want anybody getting hurt 
  no hurt  gone 
  you really have turned this around 
  thank you very much 
  i m impressed  i really am 
  thank you 
for our own curiosity   
any chance you could
tell us where the complaint came from 
i really would love to 
but i have a relationship with the state 
  just for our own curiosity 
  that was miss harridan 
  i m sure she ll see us 
  we need to talk to you 
  sorry  they just barged right in 
  that s quite all right  jenny 
gentlemen  please sit down 
now  what can i do for you 
we wanted to thank you for helping
to expedite our accreditation process 
thanks to your tip  somebody
from child services came to see us 
i had heard you opened
some sort of day care program   
and i was concerned 
that s nice of you 
you don t have to be concerned about us 
it s not you i m concerned about 
it s the children you re looking after 
  wait a minute  we re parents  that s a start 
  any boob can be a parent 
if you want to screw up your own child 
that s your right 
but when it comes to other people s kids 
there s a higher standard to answer to 
mr  kubitz seems to think that we met
that standard  show her the thing 
that piece of paper doesn t impress me 
we re getting it laminated 
you two are just some fly by night
operation looking to make a fast buck 
you re just afraid of the competition 
let s go 
competition  don t flatter yourselves 
daddy day care will never be
in the same league as this institution 
laminated 
that wasn t as satisfying as i thought 
i think we can take her  all we need
is some garlic and a wooden stake 
you know what she said that was right 
these kids need more than watching 
tomorrow we ll take it up a notch 
we got to start stimulating their minds 
  but i m not a daddy 
  you don t have to be a daddy 
you re a male type humanoid 
that fits in with the philosophy of the place 
i don t know  guys  i mean 
i guess i like hanging out with the kids 
it s kind of cool 
but i guess child care wasn t necessarily   
an avenue that i felt professionally
i was headed towards 
  that s exactly what i said 
  excuse me 
yes  come on in 
  how are you 
  hey  guys 
i am so sorry 
i forgot to write you a check this week 
ever since the divorce 
my head s just been like

  so  how s unemployment 
  actually  i ve got the best job i ve ever had

  what s the money like 
bruce  let s go  i got botox 
hi  charlie  hi  phil 
  hey  crispin 
  what s up  little man 
how do you know my kid 
they re his day care teachers 
what do you think 
day care  that s what it is 
oh  my god 
you re wiping boogers for a living 
losers 
you re paying us to do it  too  you know 
losers 
 do you like green eggs and ham 
 i do not like them  sam l am 
i do not like green eggs and ham 
 would you like to eat them here or there 
 i would not like to eat them anywhere 
i do not like green eggs and ham 
 i do not like them  sam l am   okay 
now see  he was going to punch sam l am 
but he walked away 
you don t punch  see 
he walked away with it 
where s mommy 
mommy had to work today 
remember when you used
to work all the times 
yeah  back when i had a real job 
do you miss work 
i guess  i suppose so  i miss it 
but don t get me wrong  it s not like
i don t like hanging out with you guys 
it s just that daddy used to be
a big shot down at work 
i had my own office and a big  pretty view 
remember that big  pretty view daddy had 
i like it when you spin me around
in that cool chair 
yeah  that s a cool chair 
a lot of cool things about that job 
cool chair   
i had people working underneath me   
and  just between you and i 
the pay wasn t that bad either 
  put that down  what do you think of that 
  what is it 
what do you mean 
it s a dog in the sunshine 
  it doesn t look like one 
  that s because it s abstract 
you have to squint when you look at it 
and when you see it like this 
that s abstract 
yeah  you see it 
how about if you tilt your head to the side 
  no  the other way 
  still doesn t look like one 
okay  well  what are you over there
working on  michelangelo 
what is that 
there s nothing abstract
about that now  is it 
thanks 
that s pretty good 
you got daddy s head
looking kind of round  though 
is my head that round 
  no  but i got your mustache 
  yeah  i see  a nice green mustache 
that s all right  son 
i just paid the mortgage 
the car loan and the electric bill 
look at the balance
in the checking account 
  74 cents 
  yeah  that s right  74 cents 
  you are my superman 
  you got that right 
i ve worked hard  and i think
it s time to let off a little of my frustration 
it s time for you
to take care of your superman 
  my superman  come here  baby 
  that s right 
no  the monster s going to get me 
it s probably a nightmare 
  be right back 
  okay  hurry up  mommy s coming 
no  i want daddy 
  did everything go okay 
  yeah  everything s just fine 
what s that face for 
since when does he like you
better than he likes me 
no  don t even trip  it s not like that 
i ve just been spending more time with him 
so he wanted me 
he s getting much more confident 
remember how he wouldn t play
with anyone else at first 
now  he s even playing with
that kid  crispin 
crispin happened to say  thank you 
at lunch today without being told 
and that little girl becca  she can read 
she s just a baby 
i seen her pick up a  curious george  book 
sit down and read like a grownup 
what s that face 
i haven t seen you this excited
about something in a long time 
yeah  i ain t going to front 
them little crumb snatchers
got under my skin 
mrs  plager  i cannot continue
to expose the other children   
to such dangerous  self destructive 
highly addictive behavior 
so either juliette stops the thumb sucking   
or you ll just have to find
yourself another preschool 
are you busy 
just pruning a few weeds from the garden 
what is it 
okay  i just thought you should know   
we ve lost three more students 
are you seriously suggesting
you don t know where they are 
no  ma am 
  i know where they are 
  so do i 
daddy day care 
first  it was amusing 
then it was annoying 
now it s really starting to tick me off 
get me a copy of
 child day care services regulations  
phil  get the door 
get the door 
all right  i got it 
mr  kubitz  what are you doing here

from child services 
i ll be right there 
so  let me ask you  where are the kids

 little red riding hood  
no   wrath of khan  
  mr  kubitz  hi 
  hi 
  wait  what are you doing 
  what 
  what s wrong with your face 
  my face 
what s all that stuff  man  come on 
what s the matter with you 
becca and jamie 
if you ll excuse me 
i have to see two little girls   
because now i m a big girl 
he s having fun with   
mr  kubitz  so what brings you here today 
  i ve received another complaint   
  i guess we know who that came from 
i understand that you ve acquired
three more children since my last visit 
yes  we re 14 altogether now 
it s still three adults 
so we re still under the 5 1 ratio 
right  but you see 
it s a totally different issue this time 
charlie  can i talk to you for a second 
mr  kubitz  excuse me a second 
i m going to go handle this 
  have a cookie 
  sure  thanks 
what s going on 
  what s up 
  flash is gone 
  what do you mean  gone  gone where 
  i can t find him 
  you looked everywhere  in the garage 
  everywhere 
what we going to do 
  is there some kind of problem out here 
  not at all  mr  kubitz 
we re just having a little conversation
about the   
  okay  because if it s   
  no problem at all  why don t you   
kids  why don t you meet
our good friend  mr  kubitz 
  say hi 
  hi  mr  kubitz 
hi  guys 
wouldn t it be nice
if mr  kubitz played with you guys   
while we had an important conversation 
  would you be so kind 
  is that a good idea 
we re having a grown up conversation
the kids shouldn t be privy to 
  so just for a second  please 
  sure  that s different 
  i ll check the back yard 
  i ll go upstairs 
i ll check the basement 
do we have a basement 
we have to do the laundry  god 
oh  my god  they vaporized him 
he couldn t have got far  i ll call the police 
  i ll call his parents 
  lf only i were a betazoid  i could sense him 
  which kid is this 
  i don t know  what s your name 
tony 
  flash s name is tony 
  actually  flash s name is wally west   
  why aren t you wearing your flash suit 
  i don t want to be flash anymore 
  you don t  who you want to be 
  tony 
  hear that  he wants to be tony 
  he wants to be tony 
that s nice  you want to be tony 
that s great 
tony  have a cookie  have a fresh one 
what are you talking about  i do love you 
i m just not in love with you 
what are you talking about  i do love you 
i m just not in love with you 
fifteen months of therapy 
that s the best you can do 
that is the dumbest line i have ever heard 
my mother was right about you 
wait 
for what  you think this will change 
you think i ll change 
you think this is what i had in mind 
being a 55 year old man 
living with his mother 
you think that s my idea of a good time 
i love passive aggressive losers 
according to state regulations 
a child care center in a family home   
is limited to a maximum of 12 children 
  we have plenty of room here for these kids 
  i don t make the rules  i enforce them 
you can t have more than 12 kids
at this kind of location 
so if we want to stay in business 
we have to fire two kids 
unless you want to move to a permanent
facility somewhere else  then yes 
so  who do we cut loose 
how about becca and jamie 
i can t do it 
we got to do something 
why don t we get a bigger space 
 space  the final frontier  
i m serious  harridan said we re not real 
let s get real 
let s get a bigger space  more kids 
hire more people   
and give this woman a run for her money 
  great  let s get a new space 
  yeah  final frontier 
if you don t stop with that  star trek  
i ll push you in that sticker bush  stop 
no  i m saying that there is a space available
called  the final frontier  
this used to be my home away from home 
jerry  the guy who owned this place 
had the ultimate collection of memorabilia 
you know what he had  tricorder 
that ensign riley wore
in  the doomsday machine  
yeah  i never saw that episode 
i was with him  not watching also 
needs a lot of work 
that just means we can fix it up
how we want to fix it up 
but we ll need some money to do that 
to make money  you got to spend money 
to spend money  you got to have money 
 rock for daddy day care 
 help us finance our new permanent home  
do you know what this means 
it s a chance to improve ourselves
through a little healthy competition 
no  you bubbleheaded idiot 
it s a death sentence 
if they get their hands
on a big enough space  they ll ruin me 
they re selling fun  i can t compete with fun 
i should ve crushed them
in the beginning when they were weak 
it ll be harder now  but i have no choice 
i ve got to stop them 
how are you gonna do that 
by any means necessary 
yeah  ride the pony 
pet the goat 
get a t shirt made  something to eat 
enjoy the music 
  they re showing  logan s run   friday   
  friday night at 8 00 
if you re not busy friday nights   
  maybe you d like to   
  yeah  sure 
great 
so we re talking  like 
just dinner  bath  bed 
  the works

you want me to baby sit
so you can go to the movie  right 
marvin  i want you to go with me 
okay 
  okay  great 
  all right  here s your thing 
thank you very much  okay  there you go 
i don t think we should do this 
jennifer  my dear  in life there are
winners and there are losers 
and if you want to be a winner 
sometimes you have to play dirty 
i ll show you  i ll paint my face first 
and then you paint yourself 
see  put a little paint 
and i m just going to   
what s wrong 
that s not paint  it s glue 
could i have some more
of this delicious potato salad 
have you tried it  really  it is so good 
  what s up 
  look 
and they got into everything
except for the pies 
okay  but don t panic 
we ll just sell the people pies  that s all 
wow  goats really love pie 
leave them on for two hours 
you got it 
everybody just take a deep breath
and let s go back to having fun 
okay 
  how d we do 
  we haven t even put a dent in it 
  hello 
  charlie  jim fields 
how s your vacation going 
no  i m just pulling your leg 
listen  buddy 
are you still looking for work 
 y i i ve got a job for you 
 y i unless you ve got other offers 
no  that s really interesting 
but i ve got something going on right now 
before you say no 
let me fax you over the proposal 
you can take a look at the numbers 
you think about it   
then you get back to me 
  yeah 
 y i   okay  great 
you say hi to the wife and daughter    son 
let me guess  you couldn t get
child services to come back   
so you re doing the inspection 
i apologize  i don t like to be sneaky 
still  rules are rules 
  may i come in  i ve a proposition for you 
  yeah  please do 
can i get you some coffee or tea or water   
  or eye of newt  maybe 
  water would be lovely 
  thank you 
  water  that s an easy one 
you don t mind tap water  do you 
we re out of the bottled water 
so  miss harridan  why are you here 
you seem smart  talented  highly ambitious 
what on earth are you doing
running a day care center 
maybe i enjoy running a day care center 
obviously  but is this really how you want
to spend the rest of your life 
as a businessman 
you d have money  power  respect 
you going to throw that all away
to baby sit a bunch of 3 year olds 
i said i d listen to your proposition 
i m all ears  and i got other things to do 
  so if you d be so kind   
  all right  here it is 
if daddy day care should close 
for whatever reason   
i ll take all your children
for the price you charge 
topflight education at rock bottom prices 
think about it 
now wait a minute 
you re blowing us off
for cottony cotton balls 
no  cotton candy puffs 
apparently the whole thing was my idea 
they ll double my salary
and let me run the division 
so  yes  i am taking myself back 
go ahead 
if that s what s important to you  i mean   
phil and i can manage 
we ll just find somebody else  right 
i m going  too 
this is worse than
when spock betrayed kirk   
  on  star trek v  
  it s not like that 
come back with us  not in the mailroom 
but to be part of our team 
i don t want to be on that team 
i want to be on this team 
we thought a lot about this  man 
it s a great opportunity 
no  this right here is a great opportunity 
this business is the one that has limits 
and we ve reached them  okay 
me and phil 
we got responsibilities to think about 
  we got futures to take into consideration 
  what about now  what about the kids 
these kids were fine before daddy day care 
  they ll be fine when it s over 
  you tell yourself that  charlie 
i finally found a place where i fit in   
where i feel like i m doing something good 
and you guys just   
you just spoil it all 
that couldn t have gone worse 
if you think that went bad 
wait till we tell the kids 
can i go to work with you 
no  you can t go to work with me 
but you can come visit me at work 
and daddy will be home at night
and on the weekends 
  we ll still have lots of fun together 
  will phil and marvin still be here 
no  i m sorry  little man 
they won t be around anymore 
it s just for a while  right 
then you re going to come back
and do daddy day care again 
no  this is from now on 
daddy day care 
we re not doing that anymore  ben 
let me explain it to you like this 
if daddy does this  i can get money for us 
and i can use that money
to take care of the house and to buy food   
and clothes and toys for you to play with

i wish it was that simple  ben

what do you think of
when you think of cotton candy 
  clowns 
  chocolate 
cavities 
hyperactivity  cavities  and dentist bills 
that s what i   
i ve been to the other side
and i ve seen firsthand 
when kids eat this stuff  they crash down
so hard they need an air bag 
you know what
the ingredients are to these balls 
  puffs 
  they re  puffs   i m sorry 
you know what s in here 
red dye number four and sugar 
you know what  charlie is absolutely right 
you can t ignore the reality 
parents are not going to want to buy
this product for their kids 
not unless those kids stomp and scream   
and bang their little heads on the floor
till blood comes out of their ears 
charlie  you got those figures
that i gave you 
yeah  i got them right here 
just give me a second to   
we had an independent marketing firm
do some preliminary research   
to sort out the core value of this product 
the subjects that were tested 
aged two to six   
which are key branding years   
  charlie  you want to join us 
  i m sorry about that  jim  yeah 
why don t you tell everybody
what the core value is 
what s the most important thing 
my kid 
my kid  jim  that s the most important thing 
and i think i ve made a tremendous mistake

a literal reader of the text might say   
a literal reader of the text might say   
that goldilocks ate the  porridge    
because she was  hungry  
but what would freud say 
language skills are a critical component
of childhood development 
they re part of the core curriculum
here at chapman 
if you ll follow me this way 
on the path of life 
the proper first steps are essential 
with our firm guidance  your children   
will take those steps right here at chapman 
our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine 
with structure to cling to 
and the right gardener to tend them   
  they ll grow to the sky 
  that s the dumbest thing i ever heard 
we re not talking about plants 
we re talking about kids 
i know you don t want this woman pruning
and cutting and weeding your 3 year olds 
some people are uncomfortable
with achievement 
no  what i m uncomfortable with
is treating a little kid like it s an adult 
if your kids come here  they ll be
miserable in four different languages 
five  we start portuguese in the fall 
how many languages
do you listen to them in 
you ever stop trying to shove knowledge
down their throat and just talk to them 
listen to what they want 
they re children 
they don t know what they want 
yes  they do know what they want 
all of them  and they re all different 
we took some time  talked to the kids 
got to know them a bit 
  it made a difference  it helped them 
  please  share your success 
why don t you tell these people exactly
how you help their children 
max over here is potty trained now  okay
