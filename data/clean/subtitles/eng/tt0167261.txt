gandalf 
what is it  mr  frodo 
nothing 
just a dream 
mordor  the one place in middleearth
we don t want to see any closer 
and it s the one place
we re trying to get to 
it s just where we can t get 
let s face it  mr  frodo  we re lost 
i don t think gandalf meant for us to
come this way 
he didn t mean for a lot of things
to happen  sam   
   but they did 
mr  frodo 
it s the ring  isn t it 
it s getting heavier 
what food have we got left 
let me see 
oh  yes  lovely 
lembas bread  and look 
more lembas bread 
i don t usually hold with foreign food   
   but this elvish stuff  it s not bad 
nothing ever dampens your spirits 
does it  sam 
those rain clouds might 
this looks strangely familiar 
it s because we ve been here before 
we re going in circles 
what is that horrid stink 
i warrant there s a nasty bog nearby 
can you smell it 
yes 
i can smell it 
we re not alone 
the thieves  the thieves 
the filthy little thieves 
where is it 
where is it 
they stole it from us 
my precious 
curse them  we hates them 
it s ours  it is  and we wants it 
this is sting 
you ve seen it before   
    haven t you  gollum 
release him or i ll cut your throat 
it burns 
it burns us 
it freezes 
nasty elves twisted it 
take it off us 
quiet  you 
it s hopeless  every orc in mordor s
going to hear this racket 
let s just tie him up and leave him 
no 
that would kill us  kill us 
it s no more than you deserve 
maybe he does deserve to die 
but now that i see him  i do pity him 
we be nice to them
if they be nice to us 
take it off us 
we swears to do what you wants 
we swears 
there s no promise you can make
that i can trust 
we swears   
   to serve the master
of the precious 
we will swear on   
   on the precious 
gollum  gollum 
the ring is treacherous 
it will hold you to your word 
yes   
   on the precious 
on the precious 
i don t believe you 
get down  i said  down 
sam 
he s trying to trick us 
if we let him go  he ll throttle us
in our sleep 
you know the way to mordor

you will lead us to the black gate 
merry

what is it  what do you smell 
manflesh 
aragorn 
they ve picked up our trail 
let s move 
their pace has quickened 
they must have caught our scent 
hurry 
come on  gimli 
three days and nights pursuit 
no food  no rest 
and no sign of our quarry 
but what bare rock can tell 
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall 
they may yet be alive 
less than a day ahead of us  come 
come  gimli  we re gaining on them 
i m wasted on crosscountry 
we dwarves are natural sprinters 
very dangerous over short distances 
rohan 
home of the horselords 
there s something strange at work here 
some evil gives speed
to these creatures 
sets its will against us 
legolas  what do your elfeyes see 
the uruks turn northeast 
they are taking the hobbits to isengard 
saruman 
the world is changlng 
who now has the strength to stand
agalnst the armles of isengard   
    and mordor 
to stand agalnst the mlght of sauron
and saruman   
    and the unlon of the two towers 
together  my lord sauron   
    we shall rule thls mlddleearth 
the old world wlll burn
in the flres of industry 
the forests wlll fall 
a new order wlll rlse 
we wlll drlve the machlne of war
wlth the sword and the spear   
    and the iron flsts of the orc 
we have only to remove
those who oppose us 
the horsemen took your lands 
they drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks 
murderers 
take back the lands they stole from you 
burn every village 
it wlll begln in rohan 
too long have these peasants
stood agalnst you 
but no more 
eothain  eothain 
you take your sister 
you ll go faster with just two 
papa says eothain must not ride garulf 
he is too big for him 
listen to me  you must ride to edoras
and raise the alarm 
do you understand me 
yes  mama 
i don t want to leave 
i don t want to go  mama 
freda  i will find you there 
quickly 
go  child 
rohan  my lord   
    is ready to fall 
théodred 
your son is badly wounded  my lord 
he was ambushed by orcs 
if we don t defend our country 
saruman will take it by force 
that is a lie 
saruman the white has ever been
our friend and ally 
grima 
grima 
grima 
orcs are roaming freely
across our lands 
unchecked  unchallenged 
killing at will 
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman 
why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind 
can you not see 
your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent   
   your warmongering 
warmongering 
how long is it since
saruman bought you 
what was the promised price  grima 
when all the men are dead 
you will take your share of the treasure 
too long have you watched my sister 
too long have you haunted her steps 
you see much  eomer  son of eomund 
too much 
you are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of rohan   
    under pain of death 
keep breathing  that s the key 
breathe 
they ve run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them 
we re not going no further   
    until we ve had a breather 
get a fire going 
merry 
merry 
i think we might have made a mistake
leaving the shire  pippin 
what s making that noise 
it s the trees 
what 
you remember the old forest 
on the borders of buckland 
folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall   
   and come alive 
alive 
trees that could whisper   
   talk to each other   
   even move 
i m starving 
we ain t had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days 
yeah 
why can t we have some meat  
what about them 
they re fresh 
they are not for eating 
what about their legs 
they don t need those 
they look tasty 
get back  scum 
carve them up 
just a mouthful 
no 
looks like meat s back on the menu 
boys 
pippin 
let s go 
go on 
call for help 
squeal 
no one s going to save you now 
pippin 
a red sun rises 
blood has been spilled this night 
riders of rohan   
   what news from the mark 
what business does an elf  a man
and a dwarf have in the riddermark 
speak quickly 
give me your name  horsemaster 
and i shall give you mine 
i would cut off your head  dwarf   
   if it stood but a little higher
from the ground 
you would die before your stroke fell 
i am aragorn  son of arathorn 
this is gimli  son of gloin 
and legolas of the woodland realm 
we are friends of rohan
and of théoden  your king 
théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe 
not even his own kin 
saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king   
   and claimed lordship over these lands 
my company are those loyal to rohan 
and for that  we are banished 
the white wizard is cunning 
he walks here and there  they say   
   as an old man hooded and cloaked 
and everywhere  his spies
slip past our nets 
we are no spies 
we track a party of urukhai
westward across the plain 
they have taken two of our friends
captive 
the uruks are destroyed 
we slaughtered them during the night 
but there were two hobbits 
did you see two hobbits with them 
they would be small 
only children to your eyes 
we left none alive 
we piled the carcasses and burned them 
dead 
i am sorry 
hasufel  arod 
may these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters 
farewell 
look for your friends 
but do not trust to hope 
it has forsaken these lands 
we ride north 
it s one of their wee belts 
we failed them 
a hobbit lay here 
and the other 
they crawled 
their hands were bound 
their bonds were cut 
they ran over here 
they were followed 
the belt 
run 
tracks lead away from the battle   
   into fangorn forest 
fangorn 
what madness drove them in there 
did we lose him  i think we lost him 
i m going to rip out
your filthy little innards 
come here 
trees  climb a tree 
he s gone 
merry 
let s put a maggot hole in your belly 
run  merry 
little orcs 
it s talking  merry 
the tree is talking 
tree 
i am no tree 
i am an ent 
a treeherder 
a shepherd of the forest 
don t talk to it  merry 
don t encourage it 
treebeard  some call me 
and whose side are you on 
side 
i am on nobody s side   
   because nobody s on my side 
little orc 
nobody cares for the woods anymore 
we re not orcs  we re hobbits 
hobbits 
never heard of a hobbit before 
sounds like orc mischief to me 
they come with fire 
they come with axes 
gnawing  biting  breaking 
hacking  burning 
destroyers and usurpers  curse them 
no 
you don t understand  we re hobbits 
halflings 
shirefolk 
maybe you are   
   and maybe you aren t 
the white wizard will know 
the white wizard 
saruman 
see  see 
we ve led you out 
hurry  hobbitses  hurry 
very lucky we find you 
nice hobbit 
it s a bog  he s led us into a swamp 
a swamp  yes  yes 
come  master  we will take you
on safe paths through the mist 
come  hobbits  come  we go quickly 
i found it  i did 
the way through the marshes 
orcs don t use it 
orcs don t know it 
they go around for miles and miles 
come quickly 
soft and quick as shadows we must be 
there are dead things 
dead faces in the water 
all dead  all rotten 
elves and men and orcses 
a great battle long ago 
dead marshes 
yes  yes  that is their name 
this way 
don t follow the lights 
careful now  or hobbits go down
to join the dead ones   
   and light little candles
of their own 
frodo 
gollum 
don t follow the lights 
gollum 
mr  frodo 
are you all right 
so bright 
so beautiful 
our precious 
what did you say 
master should be resting 
master needs to keep up his strength 
who are you 
mustn t ask us  not its business 
gollum  gollum 
gandalf told me you were
one of the riverfolk 
cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travelers far from home
he said your life was a sad story 
they do not see what iles ahead
when sun has falled and moon is dead
you were not so very different
from a hobbit once 
were you 
sméagol 
what did you call me 
that was your name once  wasn t it 
a long time ago 
my name 
my name 
sméagol 
black riders 
hide  hide 
come on  frodo  come on 
quick  they will see us 
they will see us 
i thought they were dead 
dead 
no  you cannot kill them  no 
wraiths 
wraiths on wings 
they are calling for it 
they are calling for the precious 
mr  frodo  it s all right 
i m here 
hurry  hobbits 
the black gate is very close 
orc blood 
these are strange tracks 
the air is so close in here 
this forest is old 
very old 
full of memory   
   and anger 
the trees are speaking to each other 
gimli 
lower your ax 
something s out there 
what do you see 
the white wizard approaches 
do not let him speak 
he will put a spell on us 
we must be quick 
you are tracking the footsteps
of two young hobbits 
where are they 
they passed this way
the day before yesterday 
they met someone they did not expect 
does that comfort you 
who are you 
show yourself 
it cannot be 
you fell 
through fire   
   and water 
from the lowest dungeon
to the hlghest peak   
    i fought wlth the balrog
of morgoth 
u ntll at last i threw down
my enemy   
    and smote hls ruln
upon the mountalnslde 
darkness took me   
    and i strayed out of thought
and tlme 
stars wheeled overhead   
    and every day was as long
as a ilfe age of the earth 
but it was not the end 
i felt ilfe in me agaln 
i ve been sent back   
    until my task is done 
gandalf 
gandalf 
yes 
that was what they used to call me 
gandalf the grey 
that was my name 
gandalf 
i am gandalf the white 
and i come back to you now   
   at the turn of the tide 
one stage of your journey is over 
another begins 
war has come to rohan 
we must ride to edoras with all speed 
that is one of the mearas   
    unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell 
shadowfax 
he is the lord of all horses   
   and has been my friend
through many dangers 
my home iles deep in the forest   
    near the roots of the mountaln 
i told gandalf i would keep you safe 
and safe is where i ll keep you 
the trees have grown wild
and dangerous 
anger festers in their hearts 
they will harm you if they can 
there are too few of us now 
too few of us ents
left to manage them 
the black gate of mordor 
oh  save us 
my old gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now 
master says to show him
the way into mordor 
so good sméagol does 
master says so 
i did 
that s it  then 
we can t get past that 
look 
the gate 
it s opening 
i can see a way down 
sam  no 
master 
i do not ask you to come with me  sam 
i know  mr  frodo 
i doubt even these elvish cloaks
will hide us in there 
now 
no 
no  no  master 
they catch you  they catch you 
don t take it to him 
he wants the precious 
always he is looking for it 
and the precious is wanting
to go back to him 
but we mustn t let him have it 
no  there s another way 
more secret  a dark way 
why haven t you spoken of this before 
because master did not ask 
he s up to something 
are you saying there s another way
into mordor 
yes  there s a path   
   and some stairs 
and then   
   a tunnel 
he s led us this far  sam 
mr  frodo  no 
he s been true to his word 
no 
lead the way  sméagol 
good sméagol always helps 
edoras and the golden hall
of meduseld 
there dwells théoden  king of rohan   
    whose mlnd is overthrown 
saruman  s hold over klng théoden
is now very strong 
my lord  your son   
    he is dead 
my lord 
uncle 
will you not go to him 
will you do nothing 
be careful what you say 
do not look for welcome here 
oh  he must have died
sometime in the night 
what a tragedy for the king   
   to lose his only son and heir 
i understand 
his passing is hard to accept 
especially now that your brother
has deserted you 
leave me alone  snake 
oh  but you are alone 
who knows what you ve spoken
to the darkness   
   in the bitter watches of the night   
   when all your life seems to shrink 
the walls of your bower
closing in about you 
a hutch to trammel some wild thing in 
so fair 
so cold 
like a morning of pale spring   
   still clinging to winter s chill 
your words are poison 
you ll find more cheer in a graveyard 
i cannot allow you before théoden king
so armed  gandalf greyhame 
by order of grima wormtongue 
your staff 
you would not part an old man
from his walking stick 
my lord  gandalf the grey is coming 
he s a herald of woe 
the courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late   
   théoden king 
he s not welcome 
why should i welcome you   
   gandalf stormcrow 
a just question  my liege 
late is the hour   
   in which this conjurer
chooses to appear 
lathspell i name him 
ill news is an ill guest 
be silent  keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth 
i have not passed
through fire and death   
   to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm 
his staff 
i told you to take the wizard s staff 
théoden   
   son of thengel   
   too long have you sat
in the shadows 
i would stay still if i were you 
hearken to me 
i release you   
   from the spell 
you have no power here   
   gandalf the grey 
i will draw you  saruman 
as poison is drawn from a wound 
wait 
if i go  théoden dies 
you did not kill me   
   you will not kill him 
rohan is mine 
be gone 
i know your face 
eowyn 
eowyn 
gandalf 
breathe the free air again  my friend 
dark have been my dreams of late 
your fingers would remember
their old strength better   
   if they grasped your sword 
i ve only   
   ever served you  my lord 
your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast 
send me not from your sight 
no  my lord  no  my lord 
let him go 
enough blood has been spilt
on his account 
get out of my way 
hail  théoden king 
where is théodred 
where is my son 
simbelmynë 
ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers 
now it shall cover the grave
of my son 
alas that these evil days
should be mine 
the young perish and the old linger 
that i should live   
   to see the last days of my house 
théodred s death
was not of your making 
no parent should have to bury
their child 
he was strong in life 
his spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers 
they had no warning 
they were unarmed 
now the wild men are moving through
the westfold  burning as they go 
rick  cot and tree 
where is mama 
this is but a taste of the terror
that saruman will unleash 
all the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of sauron 
ride out and meet him head on 
draw him away from your women
and children 
you must fight 
you have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak 
eomer is loyal to you 
his men will return
and fight for their king 
they will be 300 leagues from here
by now 
eomer cannot help us 
i know what it is you want of me   
   but i will not bring further death
to my people 
i will not risk open war 
open war is upon you 
whether you would risk it or not 
when last i looked   
   théoden  not aragorn 
was king of rohan 
then what is the king s decision 
by order of the klng   
   the city must empty 
we make for the refuge of helm s deep 
do not burden yourself with treasures 
take only what provisions you need 
helm s deep 
they flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight 
who will defend them if not their king 
he s only doing what he thinks
is best for his people 
helm s deep has saved them
in the past 
there is no way out of that ravine 
théoden is walking into a trap 
he thinks he s leading them to safety 
what they will get is a massacre 
théoden has a strong will 
but i fear for him 
i fear for the survival of rohan 
he will need you before the end 
aragorn 
the people of rohan will need you 
the defenses have to hold 
they will hold 
the grey pilgrim 
that s what they used to call me 
three hundred lives of men i ve walked
this earth  and now i have no time 
with luck  my search will not
be in vain 
look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day 
at dawn  look to the east 
go 
you have some skill with a blade 
women of this country learned long ago 
those without swords
can still die upon them 
i fear neither death nor pain 
what do you fear  my lady 
a cage 
to stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them 
and all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire 
you re a daughter of kings   
   a shieldmaiden of rohan 
i do not think that would be your fate 
théoden wlll not stay at edoras 
it s vulnerable  he knows this 
he will expect an attack on the city 
they will flee to helm s deep   
   the great fortress of rohan 
it is a dangerous road to take
through the mountalns 
they wlll be slow 
they will have women and children
with them 
send out your wargriders 
hey  stinker  don t go getting
too far ahead 
why do you do that 
what 
call him names 
run him down all the time 
because 
because that s what he is  mr  frodo 
there s naught left in him
but lies and deceit 
it s the ring he wants 
it s all he cares about 
you have no idea what it did to him   
   what it s still doing to him 
i want to help him  sam 
why 
because i have to believe
he can come back 
you can t save him  mr  frodo 
what do you know about it 
nothing 
i m sorry  sam  i don t know
why i said that 
i do 
it s the ring 
you can t take your eyes off it 
i ve seen you 
you re not eating  you barely sleep 
it s taken hold of you  mr  frodo 
you have to fight it 
i know what i have to do  sam 
the ring was entrusted to me 
it s my task 
mine  my own 
can t you hear yourself 
don t you know who you sound like 
we wants it 
we needs it 
must have the precious 
they stole it from us 
sneaky little hobbitses 
wicked  tricksy  false 
no  not master 
yes  precious  false 
they will cheat you  hurt you  lie 
master s my friend 
you don t have any friends 
nobody likes you 
not listening  i m not listening 
you re a liar and a thief 
no 
murderer 
go away 
go away 
i hate you 
i hate you 
where would you be without me 
gollum  gollum 
i saved us 
it was me  we survived because of me 
not anymore 
what did you say 
master looks after us now 
we don t need you 
what 
leave now   
   and never come back 
no 
leave now and never come back 
leave now and never come back 
we told him to go away 
and away he goes  precious 
gone  gone  gone 
sméagol is free 
look 
look  see what sméagol finds 
they are young 
they are tender  they are nice 
yes  they are  eat them  eat them 
you ll make him sick  you will   
   behaving like that 
there s only one way to eat
a brace of coneys 
what s it doing 
stupid  fat hobbit 
it ruins it 
what s to ruin  there s hardly any meat
on them 
what we need is a few good taters 
what s taters  precious 
what s taters  eh 
potatoes 
boil them  mash them 
stick them in a stew 
lovely  big  golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish 
even you couldn t say no to that 
oh  yes  we could 
spoil a nice fish 
give it to us raw   
   and wriggling 
you keep nasty chips 
you re hopeless 
mr  frodo 
who are they 
wicked men 
servants of sauron 
they are called to mordor 
the dark one is gathering all armies
to him 
it won t be long now 
he will soon be ready 
ready to do what 
to make his war 
the last war that will cover
all the world in shadow 
we ve got to get moving  come on  sam 
mr  frodo 
look 
it s an oliphaunt 
no one at home will believe this 
sméagol 
we ve lingered here too long 
come on  sam 
bind their hands 
it s true  you don t see
many dwarf women 
and in fact  they are so alike
in voice and appearance   
   that they re often mistaken
for dwarf men 
it s the beards 
this  in turn  has given rise
to the belief   
   that there are no dwarf women   
   and that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground   
   which is  of course  ridiculous 
it s all right  nobody panic 
that was deliberate 
it was deliberate 
the ilght of the evenstar
does not wax and wane 
it is mlne to glve to whom i wlll 
llke my heart 
go to sleep 
i am asleep 
this is a dream 
then it is a good dream 
sleep 
you told me once   
this day would come 
this is not the end   it is the beginning 
you must go with frodo 
that is your path 
my path is hidden from me 
it is already laid before your feet 
you cannot falter now 
arwen   
if you trust nothing else   
trust this   
   trust us 
where is she 
the woman who gave you that jewel 
our tlme here is endlng 
arwen s time is ending 
let her go 
let her take the ship into the west 
let her bear away her love for you
to the undying lands 
there it will be ever green 
but never more than memory 
i will not leave my daughter here
to die 
she stays because she still has hope 
she stays for you 
she belongs with her people 
you have a chance for another life   
away from war   grief   despair 
why are you saying this 
i am mortal  you are elfkind 
it was a dream  arwen 
nothing more 
this belongs to you 
it was a gift 
keep it 
my lord 
she is sailing to the undying lands
with all that is left of her kin 
what is it 
hama 
i m not sure 
wargs 
a scout 
what is it  what do you see 
warg  we re under attack 
get them out of here 
all riders to the head of the column 
come on  get me up here  i m a rider 
come on 
you must lead the people
to helm s deep  and make haste 
i can fight 
no 
you must do this  for me 
follow me 
forward  i mean  charge forward 
make for the lower ground 
that s it  go on 
stay together 
bring your pretty face to my ax 
that one counts as mine 
stinking creature 
aragorn 
aragorn 
tell me what happened
and i will ease your passing 
he s   
   dead 
he took a little tumble off the cliff 
you lie 
get the wounded on horses 
the wolves of isengard will return 
leave the dead 
come 
at last 
helm s deep 
there it is  helm s deep 
we re safe 
we re safe  my lady 
thank you 
mama 
eothain 
freda 
make way for théoden 
make way for the king 
so few  so few of you have returned 
our people are safe 
we have paid for it with many lives 
my lady 
lord aragorn   
   where is he 
he fell 
draw all our forces behind the wall 
bar the gate 
and set a watch on the surround 
what of those who cannot fight  my lord 
the women and children 
get them into the caves 
saruman s arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here 
helm  s deep has one weakness 
its outer wall is solld rock   
    but for a small culvert
at its base   
    whlch is ilttle more than a draln 
how  how can fire undo stone 
what kind of device
could bring down the wall 
if the wall is breached 
helm s deep will fall 
even if it is breached  it would take
a number beyond reckoning   
   thousands  to storm the keep 
tens of thousands 
but  my lord  there is no such force 
a new power is rising 
its victory is at hand 
this night   
   the land will be stained
with the blood of rohan 
march to helm s deep 
leave none alive 
to war 
there will be no dawn for men 
look  there s smoke to the south 
there is always smoke rising   
   from isengard these days 
isengard 
there was a time   
   when saruman would walk in my woods 
but now he has a mind of metal   
   and wheels 
he no longer cares for growing things 
what is it 
it s saruman s army 
the war has started 
may the grace of the valar
protect you 
arwen 
it is time 
the ships are leaving for valinor 
go now   before it is too late 
i have made my choice 
he is not coming back 
why do you linger here
when there is no hope 
there is still hope 
if aragorn survives this war 
you will still be parted 
if sauron is defeated
and aragorn made king   
   and all that you hope for
comes true   
   you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality 
whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time   
   aragorn will die 
and there wlll be no comfort
for you   
    no comfort to ease the paln
of hls passlng 
he wlll come to death   
    an image of the splendor
of the klngs of men   
    in glory undlmmed before
the breaklng of the world 
but you  my daughter   
    you wlll ilnger on in darkness
and in doubt   
    as nlghtfall in wlnter
that comes wlthout a star 
here you wlll dwell   
    bound to your grlef
under the fadlng trees   
    untll all the world is changed   
   and the long years of your life
are utterly spent 
arwen 
there is nothing for you here   
   only death 
do i not also have your love 
you have my love  father 
the power of the enemy is growlng 
sauron wlll use hls puppet 
saruman   
    to destroy the people of rohan 
isengard has been unleashed 
the eye of sauron now turns
to gondor   
    the last free klngdom of men 
hls war on thls country
wlll come swlftly 
he senses the rlng is close 
the strength of the rlngbearer
is falllng 
in hls heart  frodo beglns
to understand   
   the quest will claim his life 
you know this 
you have foreseen it 
it is the rlsk we all took 
in the gatherlng dark  the wlll
of the rlng grows strong 
it works hard now to flnd its way back
into the hands of men 
men  who are so easlly seduced
by its power 
the young captaln of gondor
has but to extend hls hand   
    take the rlng for hls own 
and the world wlll fall 
it is close now 
so close to achlevlng its goal 
for sauron wlll have domlnlon
over all ilfe on thls earth   
    even unto to the endlng
of the world 
the tlme of the elves   
    is over 
do we leave mlddleearth
to its fate 
do we let them stand alone 
what news 
our scouts report saruman
has attacked rohan 
théoden s people have fled
to helm s deep 
but we must look to our own borders 
faramir  orcs are on the move 
sauron is marshaling an army 
easterlings and southrons
are at the black gate 
how many 
some thousands  more come every day 
who s covering the river to the north 
we pulled 500 men at osgiliath 
if their city is attacked 
we won t hold it 
saruman attacks from isengard 
sauron from mordor 
the fight will come to men
on both fronts 
gondor is weak 
sauron will strike us soon 
and he will strike hard 
he knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him 
my men tell me that you are orc spies 
spies  now wait just a minute 
well  if you re not spies 
then who are you 
speak 
we are hobbits of the shire 
frodo baggins is my name 
and this is samwise gamgee 
your bodyguard 
his gardener 
and where is your skulking friend 
that gangrel creature 
he had an illfavored look 
there was no other 
we set out from rivendell
with seven companions 
one we lost in moria   
   two were my kin   
   a dwarf there was also 
and an elf and two men 
aragorn  son of arathorn 
and boromir of gondor 
you re a friend of boromir 
yes 
for my part 
it will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead 
dead 
how  when 
as one of his companions 
i d hoped you would tell me 
he was my brother 
captain faramir 
we found the third one 
you must come with me  now 
down there 
to enter the forbidden pool
bears the penalty of death 
they wait for my command 
shall i shoot 
the rock and pool
is nlce and cool
so julcy sweet
our only wlsh
to catch a flsh
so julcy sweet
wait 
this creature is bound to me 
and i to him 
he is our guide 
please   
   let me go down to him 
sméagol 
master is here 
come  sméagol 
trust master  come 
we must go now 
sméagol  you must trust master 
follow me  come on 
come 
come  sméagol 
nice sméagol  that s it 
come on 
don t hurt him 
sméagol  don t struggle 
sméagol  listen to me 
master 
no  no 
where are you leading them 
answer me 
sméagol 
why does it cry  sméagol 
cruel men hurts us 
master tricksed us 
of course he did 
i told you he was tricksy 
i told you he was false 
master is our friend 
our friend 
master betrayed us 
no  not its business 
leave us alone 
filthy little hobbitses 
they stole it from us 
no  no 
what did they steal 
my precious 
we have to get out of here 
you go  go  now 
you can do it 
use the ring  mr  frodo 
just this once 
put it on 
disappear 
i can t 
you were right  sam 
you tried to tell me but   
i m sorry 
the ring s taking me  sam 
if i put it on   
    he ll find me 
he ll see 
mr  frodo   
so this is the answer
to all the riddles 
here in the wild i have you   
   two halflings   
   and a host of men at my call 
the ring of power within my grasp 
a chance for faramir 
captain of gondor   
   to show his quality 
no 
stop it 
leave him alone 
don t you understand 
he s got to destroy it 
that s where we re going  into mordor 
to the mountain of fire 
osgiliath is under attack 
they call for reinforcements 
please  it s such a burden 
will you not help him 
captain 
prepare to leave 
the ring will go to gondor 
he s alive 
where is he  where is he 
get out of the way 
i m going to kill him 
you are the luckiest  the canniest   
   and the most reckless man
i ever knew 
bless you  laddie 
gimli  where is the king 
you re late 
you look terrible 
a great host  you say 
all isengard is emptied 
how many 
ten thousand strong at least 
ten thousand 
it is an army bred for a single purpose 
to destroy the world of men 
they will be here by nightfall 
let them come 
i want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms   
   to be ready for battle by nightfall 
we will cover the causeway
and the gate from above 
no army has ever breached
the deeping wall   
   or set foot inside the hornburg 
this is no rabble of mindless orcs 
these are urukhai 
their armour is thick
and their shields broad 
i have fought many wars 
master dwarf 
i know how to defend my own keep 
they will break upon this fortress
like water on rock 
saruman s hordes will pillage and burn 
we ve seen it before 
crops can be resown   
    homes rebuilt 
within these walls   
   we will outlast them 
they do not come to destroy rohan s
crops or villages 
they come to destroy its people   
   down to the last child 
what would you have me do 
look at my men 
their courage hangs by a thread 
if this is to be our end  then i would
have them make such an end   
   as to be worthy of remembrance 
send out riders  my lord 
you must call for aid 
and who will come 
elves 
dwarves 
we are not so lucky in our friends
as you 
the old alliances are dead 
gondor will answer 
gondor  
where was gondor
when the westfold fell  
where was gondor when
our enemies closed in around us  
where was gon 
no  my lord aragorn   
   we are alone 
get the women and children
into the caves 
we need more time
to lay provisions
there is no time  war is upon us 
secure the gate 
we ents have not troubled   
   about the wars of men and wizards   
   for a very long time 
but now  something
is about to happen   
   that has not happened   
   for an age 
entmoot 
what s that 
 tis a gathering 
a gathering of what 
beech  oak 
chestnut  ash 
good  good  good 
many have come 
now we must decide
if the ents   
   will go to war 
move back  move to the caves 
keep moving 
quickly now 
farmers  farriers  stable boys 
these are no soldiers 
most have seen too many winters 
or too few 
look at them  they re frightened 
you can see it in their eyes 
and they should be   
three hundred   
against ten thousand 
they have more hope of defending
themselves here than at edoras   
they cannot win this fight 
they are all going to die 
then i shall die as one of them 
let him go  lad 
let him be 
every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury 
my lord 
who am i  gamling 
you are our king  sire 
and do you trust your king 
your men  my lord   
   will follow you to whatever end 
to whatever end 
where is the horse and the rider 
where is the horn that was blowing 
they have passed ilke raln
on the mountalns 
llke wlnd in the meadow 
the days have gone down in the west   
    behlnd the hllls   
    into shadow 
how did it come to this 
move  move to the outer wall 
give me your sword 
what is your name 
haleth  son of hama  my lord 
the men are saying
we will not live out the night 
they say that it is hopeless 
this is a good sword 
haleth  son of hama   
   there is always hope 
we have trusted you this far 
you have not led us astray 
forgive me 
i was wrong to despair 
there is nothing to forgive  legolas 
we had time  i d get this adjusted 
it s a little tight across the chest 
that is no orc horn 
send for the king 
open the gate 
open up the gate 
how is this possible 
i bring word from elrond of rivendell 
an alliance once existed
between elves and men 
long ago we fought and died together 
we come to honor that allegiance 
you are most welcome 
we are proud to fight
alongside men once more 
you could have picked a better spot 
well  lad  whatever luck you live by 
let s hope it lasts the night 
your friends are with you  aragorn 
let s hope they last the night 
show them no mercy   
for you shall receive none 
what s happening out there 
shall i describe it to you 
or would you like me to find you a box 
hold 
so it begins 
prepare to fire 
their armour is weak at the neck   
and beneath the arm 
release arrows 
did they hit anything 
give them a volley 
fire

merry 
we have just agreed 
yes 
i have told your names to the entmoot   
   and we have agreed   
   you are not orcs 
well  that s good news 
and what about saruman 
have you come to a decision about him 
now  don t be hasty  master meriadoc 
hasty 
our friends are out there 
they need our help  they cannot
fight this war on their own 
war  yes 
it affects us all 
but you must understand  young hobbit   
   it takes a long time   
   to say anything in old entish   
   and we never say anything   
    unless it is worth taking   
   a long time to say 
seventeen  eighteen 
nineteen 
twenty

causeway 
is this it 
is this is all you can conjure  saruman 
bring him down  legolas 
kill him  kill him 
brace the gate 
hold them  stand firm 
aragorn 
gimli 
charge 
the ents cannot hold back this storm 
we must weather such things
as we have always done 
how can that be your decision  
this is not our war 
but you re part of this world 
aren t you  
you must help  please 
you must do something 
you are young and brave  master merry 
but your part in this tale is over 
go back to your home 
maybe treebeard s right 
we don t belong here  merry 
it s too big for us 
what can we do in the end 
we ve got the shire 
maybe we should go home 
the fires of isengard will spread   
   and the woods of tuckborough
and buckland will burn 
and   
and all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone 
there won t be a shire  pippin 
aragorn 
fall back to the keep 
get your men out of there 
to the keep 
pull back to the keep 
haldir 
to the keep 
what are you doing 
what are you stopping for 
haldir 
brace the gate 
hold them 
to the gate  draw your swords 
make way 
we cannot hold much longer 
hold them 
how long do you need 
as long as you can give me 
gimli 
timbers 
brace the gate 
come on  we can take them 
it s a long way 
toss me

i cannot jump the distance 
you ll have to toss me 
don t tell the elf 
not a word 
shore up the door 
make way 
follow me to the barricade 
watch our backs 
throw another one over here

hold fast the gate 
gimli  aragorn

they have broken through 
the castle is breached  retreat 
fall back

hurry  i nside  get them inside 
i nto the keep 
i will leave you at the western borders
of the forest 
you can make your way north
to your homeland from there 
wait  stop 
stop 
turn around 
turn around  take us south 
south 
but that will lead you past isengard 
yes  exactly 
if we go south  we can slip
past saruman unnoticed 
the closer we are to danger 
the farther we are from harm 
it s the last thing he ll expect 
that doesn t make sense to me 
but then   
   you are very small 
perhaps you re right 
south it is  then 
hold on  little shirelings 
i always like going south 
somehow it feels like going downhill 
are you mad  we ll be caught 
no  we won t 
not this time 
look 
osgiliath burns 
mordor has come 
the ring will not save gondor 
it has only the power to destroy 
please   
   let me go 
hurry 
faramir 
you must let me go 
and those little family of field mice   
   that climb up sometimes 
and they tickle me awfully 
they re always trying to get somewhere
where they   
many of these trees were my friends 
creatures i had known
from nut and acorn 
i m sorry  treebeard 
they had voices of their own 
saruman 
a wizard should know better 
there is no curse in elvish   
    entish or the tongues of men   
   for this treachery 
my business is with isengard tonight   
   with rock and stone 
yes 
come  my friends 
the ents are going to war 
it is likely   
   that we go to our doom 
last march   
   of the ents 
faramir  orcs have taken the eastern
shore  their numbers are too great 
by nightfall we will be overrun 
mr  frodo 
it s calling to him  sam 
his eye is almost on me 
hold on  mr  frodo 
you ll be all right 
take them to my father 
tell him faramir sends a mighty gift 
a weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war 
do you want to know
what happened to boromir 
you want to know
why your brother died 
he tried to take the ring from frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him 
he tried to kill him 
the ring drove your brother mad 
watch out 
mr  frodo 
they re here 
they ve come 
nazgûl 
stay here  keep out of sight 
take cover 
the fortress is taken 
it is over 
you said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it 
they still defend it 
they have died defending it 
they re breaking in 
they re past the door 
is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves 
is there no other way 
there is one passage 
it leads into the mountains 
but they will not get far 
the urukhai are too many 
tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass 
and barricade the entrance 
so much death 
what can men do
against such reckless hate 
ride out with me 
ride out and meet them 
for death and glory 
for rohan 
for your people 
the sun is rising 
look to my comlng at flrst ilght
on the flfth day 
at dawn   
    look to the east 
yes 
yes 
the horn of helm hammerhand   
   shall sound in the deep   
   one last time 
yes 
let this be the hour
when we draw swords together 
fell deeds  awake 
now for wrath   
    now for ruin and a red dawn 
forth eorlingas 
gandalf 
théoden king stands alone 
not alone 
rohirrim 
eomer 
to the king 
yes 
a hit  a fine hit 
break the dam 
release the river 
pippin  hold on 
hold on  little hobbits 
what are you doing 
where are you going 
it s me 
it s your sam 
don t you know your sam 
i can t do this  sam 
i know 
it s all wrong 
by rights  we shouldn t even be here 
but we are 
it s like in the great stories  mr  frodo 
the ones that really mattered 
full of darkness and danger they were 
and sometimes you didn t want
to know the end   
   because how could the end be happy 
how could the world go back
to the way it was   
    when so much bad had happened 
victory 
we have victory 
but in the end 
it s only a passlng thlng   
    thls shadow 
even darkness must pass 
a new day wlll come 
and when the sun shlnes 
it wlll shlne out the clearer 
those were the storles
that stayed wlth you   
    that meant somethlng 
even if you were too small
to understand why 
but i thlnk  mr  frodo  i do understand 
i know now 
folk in those stories   
    had lots of chances of turning back 
only they didn t 
they kept going   
   because they were holding
on to something 
what are we holding on to  sam 
that there s some good
in this world  mr  frodo 
and it s worth fighting for 
i think at last we understand one another 
frodo baggins 
you know the laws of our country 
the laws of your father 
if you let them go 
your life will be forfeit 
then it is forfeit 
release them 
sauron s wrath will be terrible 
his retribution swift 
the battle for helm s deep is over 
the battle for middleearth
is about to begin 
all our hopes now lie
with two little hobbits   
    somewhere in the wllderness 
i wonder if we ll ever be
put into songs or tales 
what 
i wonder if people will ever say 
 let s hear about frodo and the ring  
and they ll say 
 yes  that s one of my favorite stories  
 frodo was really courageous 
wasn t he  dad  
 yes  my boy 
the most famousest of hobbits 
and that s saying a lot  
well  you ve left out
one of the chief characters 
 samwise the brave  
i want to hear more about sam 
frodo wouldn t have got far
without sam 
now  mr  frodo  you shouldn t make fun 
i was being serious 
so was i 
 samwise the brave  
sméagol 
we re not going to wait for you 
come on 
master 
master looks after us 
master wouldn t hurt us 
master broke his promise 
don t ask sméagol 
poor  poor sméagol 
master betrayed us 
wicked  tricksy  false 
we ought to wring
his filthy little neck 
kill him  kill him 
kill them both 
and then we take the precious   
   and we be the master 
but the fat hobbit  he knows 
eyes always watching 
then we stabs them out 
put out his eyeses
and make him crawl 
yes  yes  yes 
kill them both 
yes  no  no 
it s too risky  it s too risky 
where is he  where has he gone 
hey  gollum  where are you 
sméagol 
we could let her do it 
yes  she could do it 
yes  precious  she could 
and then we takes it
once they re dead
