aragorn
theyve picked up our trail

their pace has quickened
they must have caught our scent
hurry
come on gimli
three days and nights pursuit
no food no rest
and no sign of our quarry
but what bare rock can tell
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall
they may yet be alive
less than a day ahead of us come
come gimli were gaining on them
im wasted on crosscountry
we dwarves are natural sprinters
very dangerous over short distances
rohan
home of the horselords
theres something strange at work here
some evil gives speed
to these creatures
sets its will against us
legolas what do your elfeyes see
the uruks turn northeast
they are taking the hobbits to isengard
saruman
the world is changlng
who now has the strength to stand
agalnst the armles of isengard
and mordor
to stand agalnst the mlght of sauron
and saruman
and the unlon of the two towers
together my lord sauron
we shall rule thls mlddleearth
the old world wlll burn
in the flres of industry
the forests wlll fall
a new order wlll rlse
we wlll drlve the machlne of war
wlth the sword and the spear
and the iron flsts of the orc
we have only to remove
those who oppose us
the horsemen took your lands
they drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks
murderers
take back the lands they stole from you
burn every village
it wlll begln in rohan
too long have these peasants
stood agalnst you
but no more
eothain eothain

papa says eothain must not ride garulf
he is too big for him
listen to me you must ride to edoras
and raise the alarm
do you understand me
yes mama
i dont want to leave
i dont want to go mama
freda i will find you there
quickly
go child
rohan my lord
is ready to fall
théodred
your son is badly wounded my lord
he was ambushed by orcs
if we dont defend our country
saruman will take it by force
that is a lie
saruman the white has ever been
our friend and ally
grima
grima
grima
orcs are roaming freely
across our lands
unchecked unchallenged
killing at will
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman
why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind
can you not see
your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent
your warmongering
warmongering
how long is it since
saruman bought you
what was the promised price grima
when all the men are dead
you will take your share of the treasure
too long have you watched my sister
too long have you haunted her steps
you see much eomer son of eomund
too much
you are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of rohan
under pain of death
keep breathing thats the key
breathe
theyve run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them
were not going no further
until weve had a breather
get a fire going
merry
merry
i think we might have made a mistake
leaving the shire pippin
whats making that noise
its the trees
what
you remember the old forest
on the borders of buckland
folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall
and come alive
alive
trees that could whisper
talk to each other
even move
im starving
we aint had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days
yeah
why cant we have some meat
what about them
theyre fresh
they are not for eating
what about their legs
they dont need those
they look tasty
get back scum
carve them up
just a mouthful
no
looks like meats back on the menu
boys
pippin
lets go
go on
call for help
squeal
no ones going to save you now
pippin
a red sun rises
blood has been spilled this night
riders of rohan
what news from the mark
what business does an elf a man
and a dwarf have in the riddermark
speak quickly
give me your name horsemaster
and i shall give you mine
i would cut off your head dwarf
if it stood but a little higher
from the ground
you would die before your stroke fell
i am aragorn son of arathorn
this is gimli son of gloin
and legolas of the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan
and of théoden your king
théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe
not even his own kin
saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king
and claimed lordship over these lands
my company are those loyal to rohan
and for that we are banished
the white wizard is cunning
he walks here and there they say
as an old man hooded and cloaked
and everywhere his spies
slip past our nets
we are no spies
we track a party of urukhai
westward across the plain
they have taken two of our friends
captive
the uruks are destroyed
we slaughtered them during the night
but there were two hobbits
did you see two hobbits with them
they would be small
only children to your eyes
we left none alive
we piled the carcasses and burned them
dead
i am sorry
hasufel arod
may these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters
farewell
look for your friends
but do not trust to hope
it has forsaken these lands
we ride north
its one of their wee belts
we failed them
a hobbit lay here
and the other
they crawled
their hands were bound
their bonds were cut
they ran over here
they were followed
the belt
run
tracks lead away from the battle
into fangorn forest
fangorn
what madness drove them in there
did we lose him i think we lost him
im going to rip out
your filthy little innards
come here
trees climb a tree
hes gone
merry
lets put a maggot hole in your belly
run merry
little orcs
its talking merry
the tree is talking
tree
i am no tree
i am an ent
a treeherder
a shepherd of the forest
dont talk to it merry
dont encourage it
treebeard some call me
and whose side are you on
side
i am on nobodys side
because nobodys on my side
little orc
nobody cares for the woods anymore
were not orcs were hobbits
hobbits
never heard of a hobbit before
sounds like orc mischief to me
they come with fire
they come with axes
gnawing biting breaking
hacking burning
destroyers and usurpers curse them
no

halflings
shirefolk
maybe you are
and maybe you arent
the white wizard will know
the white wizard
saruman

nice hobbit
its a bog hes led us into a swamp
a swamp yes yes
come master we will take you
on safe paths through the mist
come hobbits come we go quickly
i found it i did
the way through the marshes
orcs dont use it
orcs dont know it
they go around for miles and miles
come quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must be
there are dead things
dead faces in the water
all dead all rotten
elves and men and orcses
a great battle long ago
dead marshes
yes yes that is their name
this way
dont follow the lights
careful now or hobbits go down
to join the dead ones
and light little candles
of their own
frodo
gollum
dont follow the lights
gollum
mr frodo
are you all right
so bright
so beautiful
our precious
what did you say
master should be resting
master needs to keep up his strength
who are you
mustnt ask us not its business
gollum gollum
gandalf told me you were
one of the riverfolk
cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travelers far from home
he said your life was a sad story
they do not see what iles ahead
when sun has falled and moon is dead
you were not so very different
from a hobbit once

sméagol
what did you call me
that was your name once wasnt it
a long time ago
my name
my name
sméagol
black riders
hide hide

wraiths
wraiths on wings
they are calling for it
they are calling for the precious
mr frodo its all right
im here
hurry hobbits
the black gate is very close
orc blood
these are strange tracks
the air is so close in here
this forest is old
very old
full of memory
and anger
the trees are speaking to each other
gimli
lower your ax
somethings out there
what do you see
the white wizard approaches
do not let him speak
he will put a spell on us
we must be quick
you are tracking the footsteps
of two young hobbits
where are they
they passed this way
the day before yesterday
they met someone they did not expect
does that comfort you
who are you
show yourself
it cannot be
you fell
through fire
and water
from the lowest dungeon
to the hlghest peak
i fought wlth the balrog
of morgoth
u ntll at last i threw down
my enemy
and smote hls ruln
upon the mountalnslde
darkness took me
and i strayed out of thought
and tlme
stars wheeled overhead
and every day was as long
as a ilfe age of the earth
but it was not the end
i felt ilfe in me agaln
ive been sent back
until my task is done
gandalf
gandalf
yes
that was what they used to call me
gandalf the grey
that was my name
gandalf
i am gandalf the white
and i come back to you now
at the turn of the tide
one stage of your journey is over
another begins
war has come to rohan
we must ride to edoras with all speed
that is one of the mearas
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell
shadowfax
he is the lord of all horses
and has been my friend
through many dangers
my home iles deep in the forest
near the roots of the mountaln
i told gandalf i would keep you safe
and safe is where ill keep you
the trees have grown wild
and dangerous
anger festers in their hearts
they will harm you if they can
there are too few of us now
too few of us ents
left to manage them
the black gate of mordor
oh save us
my old gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now
master says to show him
the way into mordor
so good sméagol does
master says so
i did
thats it then
we cant get past that
look
the gate
its opening
i can see a way down
sam no
master
i do not ask you to come with me sam
i know mr frodo
i doubt even these elvish cloaks
will hide us in there
now
no
no no master
they catch you they catch you
dont take it to him
he wants the precious
always he is looking for it
and the precious is wanting
to go back to him
but we mustnt let him have it
no theres another way
more secret a dark way
why havent you spoken of this before
because master did not ask
hes up to something
are you saying theres another way
into mordor
yes theres a path
and some stairs
and then
a tunnel
hes led us this far sam
mr frodo no
hes been true to his word
no
lead the way sméagol
good sméagol always helps
edoras and the golden hall
of meduseld
there dwells théoden king of rohan
whose mlnd is overthrown
saruman s hold over klng théoden
is now very strong
my lord your son
he is dead
my lord
uncle
will you not go to him
will you do nothing
be careful what you say
do not look for welcome here
oh he must have died
sometime in the night
what a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir
i understand
his passing is hard to accept
especially now that your brother
has deserted you
leave me alone snake
oh but you are alone
who knows what youve spoken
to the darkness
in the bitter watches of the night
when all your life seems to shrink
the walls of your bower
closing in about you
a hutch to trammel some wild thing in
so fair
so cold
like a morning of pale spring
still clinging to winters chill
your words are poison
youll find more cheer in a graveyard
i cannot allow you before théoden king
so armed gandalf greyhame
by order of grima wormtongue
your staff
you would not part an old man
from his walking stick
my lord gandalf the grey is coming
hes a herald of woe
the courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late
théoden king
hes not welcome
why should i welcome you
gandalf stormcrow
a just question my liege
late is the hour
in which this conjurer
chooses to appear
lathspell i name him
ill news is an ill guest
be silent keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth
i have not passed
through fire and death
to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm
his staff
i told you to take the wizards staff
théoden
son of thengel
too long have you sat
in the shadows
i would stay still if i were you
hearken to me
i release you
from the spell
you have no power here
gandalf the grey
i will draw you saruman
as poison is drawn from a wound
wait
if i go théoden dies
you did not kill me
you will not kill him
rohan is mine
be gone
i know your face
eowyn
eowyn
gandalf
breathe the free air again my friend
dark have been my dreams of late
your fingers would remember
their old strength better
if they grasped your sword
ive only
ever served you my lord
your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast
send me not from your sight
no my lord no my lord
let him go
enough blood has been spilt
on his account
get out of my way
hail théoden king
where is théodred
where is my son
simbelmynë
ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers
now it shall cover the grave
of my son
alas that these evil days
should be mine
the young perish and the old linger
that i should live
to see the last days of my house
théodreds death
was not of your making
no parent should have to bury
their child
he was strong in life
his spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers
they had no warning
they were unarmed
now the wild men are moving through
the westfold burning as they go
rick cot and tree
where is mama
this is but a taste of the terror
that saruman will unleash
all the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of sauron
ride out and meet him head on
draw him away from your women
and children
you must fight
you have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak
eomer is loyal to you
his men will return
and fight for their king
they will be 300 leagues from here
by now
eomer cannot help us
i know what it is you want of me
but i will not bring further death
to my people
i will not risk open war
open war is upon you
whether you would risk it or not
when last i looked
théoden not aragorn
was king of rohan
then what is the kings decision
by order of the klng
the city must empty
we make for the refuge of helms deep
do not burden yourself with treasures
take only what provisions you need
helms deep
they flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight
who will defend them if not their king
hes only doing what he thinks
is best for his people
helms deep has saved them
in the past
there is no way out of that ravine
théoden is walking into a trap
he thinks hes leading them to safety
what they will get is a massacre
théoden has a strong will
but i fear for him
i fear for the survival of rohan
he will need you before the end
aragorn
the people of rohan will need you
the defenses have to hold
they will hold
the grey pilgrim
thats what they used to call me
three hundred lives of men ive walked
this earth and now i have no time
with luck my search will not
be in vain
look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day
at dawn look to the east
go
you have some skill with a blade
women of this country learned long ago
those without swords
can still die upon them
i fear neither death nor pain
what do you fear my lady
a cage
to stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them
and all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire
youre a daughter of kings
a shieldmaiden of rohan
i do not think that would be your fate
théoden wlll not stay at edoras
its vulnerable he knows this
he will expect an attack on the city
they will flee to helms deep
the great fortress of rohan
it is a dangerous road to take
through the mountalns
they wlll be slow
they will have women and children
with them
send out your wargriders
hey stinker dont go getting
too far ahead
why do you do that
what
call him names
run him down all the time
because
because thats what he is mr frodo
theres naught left in him
but lies and deceit
its the ring he wants
its all he cares about
you have no idea what it did to him
what its still doing to him
i want to help him sam
why
because i have to believe
he can come back
you cant save him mr frodo
what do you know about it
nothing
im sorry sam i dont know
why i said that
i do
its the ring
you cant take your eyes off it
ive seen you
youre not eating you barely sleep
its taken hold of you mr frodo
you have to fight it
i know what i have to do sam
the ring was entrusted to me
its my task
mine my own
cant you hear yourself
dont you know who you sound like
we wants it
we needs it
must have the precious
they stole it from us
sneaky little hobbitses
wicked tricksy false
no not master
yes precious false
they will cheat you hurt you lie
masters my friend
you dont have any friends
nobody likes you
not listening im not listening
youre a liar and a thief
no
murderer
go away
go away
i hate you
i hate you
where would you be without me
gollum gollum
i saved us
it was me we survived because of me
not anymore
what did you say
master looks after us now
we dont need you
what
leave now
and never come back
no
leave now and never come back
leave now and never come back
we told him to go away
and away he goes precious
gone gone gone
sméagol is free
look
look see what sméagol finds
they are young
they are tender they are nice
yes they are eat them eat them
youll make him sick you will
behaving like that
theres only one way to eat
a brace of coneys
whats it doing
stupid fat hobbit
it ruins it
whats to ruin theres hardly any meat
on them
what we need is a few good taters
whats taters precious
whats taters eh
potatoes
boil them mash them
stick them in a stew
lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish
even you couldnt say no to that
oh yes we could
spoil a nice fish
give it to us raw
and wriggling
you keep nasty chips
youre hopeless
mr frodo
who are they
wicked men
servants of sauron
they are called to mordor
the dark one is gathering all armies
to him
it wont be long now
he will soon be ready
ready to do what
to make his war
the last war that will cover
all the world in shadow
weve got to get moving come on sam
mr frodo
look
its an oliphaunt
no one at home will believe this
sméagol
weve lingered here too long
come on sam
bind their hands
its true you dont see
many dwarf women
and in fact they are so alike
in voice and appearance
that theyre often mistaken
for dwarf men
its the beards
this in turn has given rise
to the belief
that there are no dwarf women
and that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground
which is of course ridiculous
its all right nobody panic
that was deliberate
it was deliberate
the ilght of the evenstar
does not wax and wane
it is mlne to glve to whom i wlll
llke my heart
go to sleep
i am asleep
this is a dream
then it is a good dream
sleep
you told me once
this day would come
this is not the endit is the beginning
you must go with frodo
that is your path
my path is hidden from me
it is already laid before your feet
you cannot falter now
arwen
if you trust nothing else
trust this
trust us
where is she
the woman who gave you that jewel
our tlme here is endlng
arwens time is ending
let her go
let her take the ship into the west
let her bear away her love for you
to the undying lands
there it will be ever green
but never more than memory
i will not leave my daughter here
to die
she stays because she still has hope
she stays for you
she belongs with her people
you have a chance for another life
away from wargriefdespair
why are you saying this
i am mortal you are elfkind
it was a dream arwen
nothing more
this belongs to you
it was a gift
keep it
my lord
she is sailing to the undying lands
with all that is left of her kin
what is it
hama
im not sure
wargs
a scout
what is it what do you see
warg were under attack
get them out of here
all riders to the head of the column
come on get me up here im a rider
come on
you must lead the people
to helms deep and make haste
i can fight
no
you must do this for me
follow me
forward i mean charge forward
make for the lower ground
thats it go on
stay together
bring your pretty face to my ax
that one counts as mine
stinking creature
aragorn
aragorn
tell me what happened
and i will ease your passing
hes
dead
he took a little tumble off the cliff
you lie
get the wounded on horses
the wolves of isengard will return
leave the dead
come
at last
helms deep
there it is helms deep
were safe
were safe my lady
thank you
mama
eothain
freda
make way for théoden
make way for the king
so few so few of you have returned
our people are safe
we have paid for it with many lives
my lady
lord aragorn
where is he
he fell
draw all our forces behind the wall
bar the gate
and set a watch on the surround
what of those who cannot fight my lord
the women and children
get them into the caves
sarumans arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here
helm s deep has one weakness
its outer wall is solld rock
but for a small culvert
at its base
whlch is ilttle more than a draln
how how can fire undo stone
what kind of device
could bring down the wall
if the wall is breached
helms deep will fall
even if it is breached it would take
a number beyond reckoning
thousands to storm the keep
tens of thousands
but my lord there is no such force
a new power is rising
its victory is at hand
this night
the land will be stained
with the blood of rohan
march to helms deep
leave none alive
to war
there will be no dawn for men
look theres smoke to the south
there is always smoke rising
from isengard these days
isengard
there was a time
when saruman would walk in my woods
but now he has a mind of metal
and wheels
he no longer cares for growing things
what is it
its sarumans army
the war has started
may the grace of the valar
protect you
arwen
it is time
the ships are leaving for valinor
go nowbefore it is too late
i have made my choice
he is not coming back
why do you linger here
when there is no hope
there is still hope
if aragorn survives this war
you will still be parted
if sauron is defeated
and aragorn made king
and all that you hope for
comes true
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality
whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time
aragorn will die
and there wlll be no comfort
for you
no comfort to ease the paln
of hls passlng
he wlll come to death
an image of the splendor
of the klngs of men
in glory undlmmed before
the breaklng of the world
but you my daughter
you wlll ilnger on in darkness
and in doubt
as nlghtfall in wlnter
that comes wlthout a star
here you wlll dwell
bound to your grlef
under the fadlng trees
untll all the world is changed
and the long years of your life
are utterly spent
arwen
there is nothing for you here
only death
do i not also have your love
you have my love father
the power of the enemy is growlng
sauron wlll use hls puppet
saruman
to destroy the people of rohan
isengard has been unleashed
the eye of sauron now turns
to gondor
the last free klngdom of men
hls war on thls country
wlll come swlftly
he senses the rlng is close
the strength of the rlngbearer
is falllng
in hls heart frodo beglns
to understand
the quest will claim his life
you know this
you have foreseen it
it is the rlsk we all took
in the gatherlng dark the wlll
of the rlng grows strong
it works hard now to flnd its way back
into the hands of men
men who are so easlly seduced
by its power
the young captaln of gondor
has but to extend hls hand
take the rlng for hls own
and the world wlll fall
it is close now
so close to achlevlng its goal
for sauron wlll have domlnlon
over all ilfe on thls earth
even unto to the endlng
of the world
the tlme of the elves
is over
do we leave mlddleearth
to its fate
do we let them stand alone
what news
our scouts report saruman
has attacked rohan
théodens people have fled
to helms deep
but we must look to our own borders
faramir orcs are on the move
sauron is marshaling an army
easterlings and southrons
are at the black gate
how many
some thousands more come every day
whos covering the river to the north
we pulled 500 men at osgiliath
if their city is attacked
we wont hold it
saruman attacks from isengard
sauron from mordor
the fight will come to men
on both fronts
gondor is weak
sauron will strike us soon
and he will strike hard
he knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him
my men tell me that you are orc spies
spies now wait just a minute
well if youre not spies
then who are you
speak
we are hobbits of the shire
frodo baggins is my name
and this is samwise gamgee
your bodyguard

to enter the forbidden pool
bears the penalty of death

master is our friend
our friend
master betrayed us

leave us alone
filthy little hobbitses

my precious
we have to get out of here

i cant
you were right sam
you tried to tell me but
im sorry
the rings taking me sam
if i put it on
hell find me
hell see
mr frodo
so this is the answer
to all the riddles
here in the wild i have you
two halflings
and a host of men at my call
the ring of power within my grasp
a chance for faramir
captain of gondor
to show his quality
no
stop it
leave him alone
dont you understand
hes got to destroy it
thats where were going into mordor
to the mountain of fire
osgiliath is under attack
they call for reinforcements
please its such a burden
will you not help him
captain
prepare to leave
the ring will go to gondor
hes alive
where is he where is he
get out of the way
im going to kill him
you are the luckiest the canniest
and the most reckless man
i ever knew
bless you laddie
gimli where is the king
youre late
you look terrible
a great host you say
all isengard is emptied
how many
ten thousand strong at least
ten thousand
it is an army bred for a single purpose
to destroy the world of men
they will be here by nightfall
let them come
i want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms
to be ready for battle by nightfall
we will cover the causeway
and the gate from above
no army has ever breached
the deeping wall
or set foot inside the hornburg
this is no rabble of mindless orcs
these are urukhai
their armour is thick
and their shields broad
i have fought many wars
master dwarf
i know how to defend my own keep
they will break upon this fortress
like water on rock
sarumans hordes will pillage and burn
weve seen it before
crops can be resown
homes rebuilt
within these walls
we will outlast them
they do not come to destroy rohans
crops or villages
they come to destroy its people
down to the last child
what would you have me do
look at my men
their courage hangs by a thread
if this is to be our end then i would
have them make such an end
as to be worthy of remembrance
send out riders my lord
you must call for aid
and who will come
elves
dwarves
we are not so lucky in our friends
as you
the old alliances are dead
gondor will answer
gondor
where was gondor
when the westfold fell
where was gondor when
our enemies closed in around us
where was gon
no my lord aragorn
we are alone
get the women and children
into the caves
we need more time
to lay provisions
there is no time war is upon us
secure the gate
we ents have not troubled
about the wars of men and wizards
for a very long time
but now something
is about to happen
that has not happened
for an age
entmoot
whats that
tis a gathering
a gathering of what
beech oak
chestnut ash
good good good
many have come
now we must decide
if the ents
will go to war
move back move to the caves
keep moving
quickly now
farmers farriers stable boys
these are no soldiers
most have seen too many winters
or too few
look at them theyre frightened
you can see it in their eyes
and they should be
three hundred
against ten thousand
they have more hope of defending
themselves here than at edoras
they cannot win this fight
they are all going to die
then i shall die as one of them
let him go lad
let him be
every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury
my lord
who am i gamling
you are our king sire
and do you trust your king
your men my lord
will follow you to whatever end
to whatever end
where is the horse and the rider
where is the horn that was blowing
they have passed ilke raln
on the mountalns
llke wlnd in the meadow
the days have gone down in the west
behlnd the hllls
into shadow
how did it come to this
move move to the outer wall
give me your sword
what is your name
haleth son of hama my lord
the men are saying
we will not live out the night
they say that it is hopeless
this is a good sword
haleth son of hama
there is always hope
we have trusted you this far
you have not led us astray
forgive me
i was wrong to despair
there is nothing to forgive legolas
we had time id get this adjusted
its a little tight across the chest
that is no orc horn
send for the king
open the gate
open up the gate
how is this possible
i bring word from elrond of rivendell
an alliance once existed
between elves and men
long ago we fought and died together
we come to honor that allegiance
you are most welcome
we are proud to fight
alongside men once more
you could have picked a better spot
well lad whatever luck you live by
lets hope it lasts the night
your friends are with you aragorn
lets hope they last the night
show them no mercy
for you shall receive none
whats happening out there
shall i describe it to you
or would you like me to find you a box
hold
so it begins
prepare to fire
their armour is weak at the neck
and beneath the arm
release arrows
did they hit anything
give them a volley
fire
fire
send them to me come on
ladders

i have told your names to the entmoot
and we have agreed
you are not orcs
well thats good news
and what about saruman
have you come to a decision about him
now dont be hasty master meriadoc
hasty
our friends are out there
they need our help they cannot
fight this war on their own
war yes
it affects us all
but you must understand young hobbit
it takes a long time
to say anything in old entish
and we never say anything
unless it is worth taking
a long time to say
seventeen eighteen
nineteen
twenty
twentyone
causeway
is this it
is this is all you can conjure saruman
bring him down legolas
kill him kill him
brace the gate
hold them stand firm
aragorn
gimli
charge
the ents cannot hold back this storm
we must weather such things
as we have always done
how can that be your decision
this is not our war
but youre part of this world
arent you
you must help please
you must do something
you are young and brave master merry
but your part in this tale is over
go back to your home
maybe treebeards right
we dont belong here merry
its too big for us
what can we do in the end
weve got the shire
maybe we should go home
the fires of isengard will spread
and the woods of tuckborough
and buckland will burn
and
and all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone
there wont be a shire pippin
aragorn
fall back to the keep
get your men out of there
to the keep
pull back to the keep
haldir
to the keep
what are you doing
what are you stopping for
haldir
brace the gate
hold them
to the gate draw your swords
make way
we cannot hold much longer
hold them
how long do you need
as long as you can give me
gimli
timbers
brace the gate
come on we can take them
its a long way
toss me

i cannot jump the distance
youll have to toss me
dont tell the elf
not a word
shore up the door
make way
follow me to the barricade
watch our backs

hold fast the gate
gimli aragorn

fall back
fall back
they have broken through
the castle is breached retreat
fall back
retreat
hurry i nside get them inside
i nto the keep
i will leave you at the western borders
of the forest
you can make your way north
to your homeland from there
wait stop
stop
turn around
turn around take us south
south
but that will lead you past isengard
yes exactly
if we go south we can slip
past saruman unnoticed
the closer we are to danger
the farther we are from harm
its the last thing hell expect
that doesnt make sense to me
but then
you are very small
perhaps youre right
south it is then
hold on little shirelings
i always like going south
somehow it feels like going downhill
are you mad well be caught
no we wont
not this time
look
osgiliath burns
mordor has come
the ring will not save gondor
it has only the power to destroy
please
let me go
hurry
faramir
you must let me go
and those little family of field mice
that climb up sometimes
and they tickle me awfully
theyre always trying to get somewhere
where they
many of these trees were my friends
creatures i had known
from nut and acorn
im sorry treebeard
they had voices of their own
saruman
a wizard should know better
there is no curse in elvish
entish or the tongues of men
for this treachery
my business is with isengard tonight
with rock and stone
yes
come my friends
the ents are going to war
it is likely
that we go to our doom
last march
of the ents
faramir orcs have taken the eastern
shore their numbers are too great
by nightfall we will be overrun
mr frodo
its calling to him sam
his eye is almost on me
hold on mr frodo
youll be all right
take them to my father
tell him faramir sends a mighty gift
a weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war
do you want to know
what happened to boromir
you want to know
why your brother died
he tried to take the ring from frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him
he tried to kill him
the ring drove your brother mad
watch out
mr frodo
theyre here
theyve come
nazgûl
stay here keep out of sight
take cover
the fortress is taken
it is over
you said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it
they still defend it
they have died defending it
theyre breaking in
theyre past the door
is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves
is there no other way
there is one passage
it leads into the mountains
but they will not get far
the urukhai are too many
tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass
and barricade the entrance
so much death
what can men do
against such reckless hate
ride out with me
ride out and meet them
for death and glory
for rohan
for your people
the sun is rising
look to my comlng at flrst ilght
on the flfth day
at dawn
look to the east
yes
yes
the horn of helm hammerhand
shall sound in the deep
one last time
yes
let this be the hour
when we draw swords together
fell deeds awake
now for wrath
now for ruin and a red dawn
forth eorlingas
gandalf
théoden king stands alone
not alone
rohirrim
eomer
to the king
yes
a hit a fine hit
break the dam
release the river
pippin hold on
hold on little hobbits
what are you doing
where are you going
its me
its your sam
dont you know your sam
i cant do this sam
i know
its all wrong
by rights we shouldnt even be here
but we are
its like in the great stories mr frodo
the ones that really mattered
full of darkness and danger they were
and sometimes you didnt want
to know the end
because how could the end be happy
how could the world go back
to the way it was
when so much bad had happened
victory
we have victory
but in the end
its only a passlng thlng
thls shadow
even darkness must pass
a new day wlll come
and when the sun shlnes
it wlll shlne out the clearer
those were the storles
that stayed wlth you
that meant somethlng
even if you were too small
to understand why
but i thlnk mr frodo i do understand
i know now
folk in those stories
had lots of chances of turning back
only they didnt
they kept going
because they were holding
on to something
what are we holding on to sam
that theres some good
in this world mr frodo
and its worth fighting for
i think at last we understand one another
frodo baggins
you know the laws of our country
the laws of your father
if you let them go
your life will be forfeit
then it is forfeit
release them
saurons wrath will be terrible
his retribution swift
the battle for helms deep is over
the battle for middleearth
is about to begin
all our hopes now lie
with two little hobbits
somewhere in the wllderness
i wonder if well ever be
put into songs or tales
what
i wonder if people will ever say
lets hear about frodo and the ring
and theyll say
yes thats one of my favorite stories
frodo was really courageous
wasnt he dad
yes my boy
the most famousest of hobbits
and thats saying a lot
well youve left out
one of the chief characters
samwise the brave
i want to hear more about sam
frodo wouldnt have got far
without sam
now mr frodo you shouldnt make fun
i was being serious
so was i
samwise the brave
sméagol
were not going to wait for you
come on
master
master looks after us
master wouldnt hurt us
master broke his promise
dont ask sméagol
poor poor sméagol
master betrayed us
wicked tricksy false
we ought to wring
his filthy little neck
kill him kill him
kill them both
and then we take the precious
and we be the master
but the fat hobbit he knows
eyes always watching
then we stabs them out
put out his eyeses
and make him crawl
yes yes yes
kill them both
yes no no
its too risky its too risky
where is he where has he gone
hey gollum where are you
sméagol
we could let her do it
yes she could do it
yes precious she could
and then we takes it
once theyre dead
