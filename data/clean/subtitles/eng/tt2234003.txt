its certainly a
startling opening line
what is that irony
im sorry lets start again
what do you want to say to me
im here to listen to
whatever you have to say
i was raped by a priest
when i was seven years old
orally and anally as they
say in the court reports
this went on for five years
every other day for five years
i bled a lot as you can imagine
i bled a terrible amount
have you spoken to anyone about this
im speaking to you now
i mean have you sought
professional help
why so i could learn how to cope so
that i could learn how to live with it
maybe i dont want to cope maybe i dont
want to learn how to live with it
did you make a formal complaint
did you testify
the mans dead
i dont know what to say to you
i have no answer for
you im sorry
what good would it do anyway
if he were still alive
what would be the point
of killing the bastard
that would be no news theres no
point in killing a bad priest
killing a good one
that would be a shock
they wouldnt know
what to make of that
im going to kill you father
im going to kill you cause
youve done nothing wrong
im going to kill you
because youre innocent
not right now though
ill give you enough time
to put your house in order
make your peace with god
sunday week lets say
ill meet you down by the
beach down by the water there
killing a priest on a sunday
thatll be a good one
nothing to say to me father
not right now no but im sure ill
think of something by sunday week
body of christ
amen
a little too much
wine again mícheál
sorry father
im wondering is this some
kind of ploy on your behalf
ploy father
ive noticed my stocks of booze appear
to be somewhat diminished of late
im wondering is this some
kind of ploy youre working
cover up for the wine youve
been imbibing on the qt
ive no idea what youre talking about
father leary noticed nothing amiss
father leary does not know you
as well as i do mícheál
he may well underestimate the depths
of your machiavellian chicanery
can i go now father
whats the hurry have they called
a meeting at mafia headquarters
on your way
things you hear in
confession these days
its depressing
you have to detach yourself from it
were here to provide solace your
personal feelings dont come into it
i know that what
do you take me for
its difficult though the mess
people make of their lives
whats the problem without
going into details obviously
that woman with the big black
eye have you seen her
veronica brennan yeah
shes an odd one
things she comes up with think shes
trying to drag you down into the muck
do you know what felching is
i do know what
felching is yeah
i had to look it up
this is you not going into details
sorry anyway whatever is wrong with
her has obviously gotten out of hand
shes got knocked around now
well if you say it to her
shell raise holy hell
say it on the basis of something
she said during confession
i know i know we
cant have that
she could be
excommunicated the cow
ill have a word with her jack as well
pastoral duties and what have you
nothing to do with her confession
see whats going on
that colored fellow the ugandan
hes one of her lovers i think
simons from the ivory coast
right i knew it was that or guyana
or one of those african countries
guyana is in south america
dont think so father i was
always pretty good at geography
not bad
surprisingly
i was expecting a daub
who are these two lads
dont know im reading
these ghost stories
maybe its got something
to do with that
spooky
so did you know who it was
yes i know who it was
do you know him well
well enough
knowing this man as you do do
you think it was an idle threat
i dont know im not sure
if youre not sure it
means its possible
yes i suppose
you didnt grant him
absolution obviously
he didnt ask for it
there you have it the man is not penitent
theres no contrition
hes threatening to commit a crime
not asking for forgiveness for one
the inviolability of the
sacramental seal does not apply
youre saying i should
go to the police
im not saying anything james
the choice is yours
dont tell me you made
the classic error
youre supposed to cut
down not across
this is bruno
and i always wanted a
fast car a red one
i thought youd already
had your midlife crisis
youre a very
nicelooking young woman
thank you
i like your bow tie
its got polka dots
this is my daughter fiona milo
shes over from london
youre having me on
im not having you on
but youre a priest  i was
married before i became a priest
my wife and i had a child
fiona my wife died
and after that i
joined the priesthood
you can do that can you
it would appear so
dont tell me you made
the classic error
ive already done that guide frank
youre supposed to cut down
i said ive already done it
now now
drop of the hard
stuff for yourself
a generous serving of the old water of
life for this beautiful yet troubled
fuck off
an exceedingly dotty mouth
i like that in a whore
brendan nows not the time
whatever you say father
youre the boss
hows that working out for you
i havent been out in a good while
so you say
no no ive been a very good lad
and dont change the subject
what was the subject
you know what the subject was
oh daddy a man a man what else
its getting to be
a habit honey
i know its pathetic i
cant do anything right
nice shades
do they make me
look like jackie o
not really
this what you came to go about
nasty huh
interesting color
they say you can find beauty in
everything if you look hard enough
and id say you can find
beauty in most things
not everything thats nonsense
what would i know im
just an old washer woman
listen if you dont want
to talk to me thats fine
im not here to compel
you to do anything
you never know father maybe id like
to be compelled maybe id enjoy it
ill have a word with jack see
what he has to say for himself
grand inquisitor go
and hear for yourself
im sure hell be only too pleased to
have someone else to bore the ears off
i stopped listening to his
old shite a long time ago
thats how it is is it im
sorry i didnt realize
you thought we were another
grace kelly and prince rainier
i know it wasnt a very happy marriage
so its not a great analogy
you know thats what ive
always liked about you father
youre just a little too
sharp for this parish
fine fellow he was decapitated the two
of them blood all over the place
hi father
jack
could i have a word in private
sounds ominous
wheres johnnie cochran
when you need him
i hope we dont get locked in here
wed have to make love to keep warm
i had a word with
veronica jack
out at the house are you
is everything all right
everythings fine i mean
now everythings not fine
mass on sunday with the
shades and everything
oh that
yes that
are you laying into her
or whats going on
i wasnt mean to her no thats that
black fellow that shes been seeing
i mean that colored
fellow shes been seeing
i didnt mean to be racist
that was a slip of the tongue
youre saying he beat her up
thats what im assuming yeah
the way she speaks in riddles i
cant make any sense out of her
i think shes bipolar or lactose
intolerant one of the two
i dont know where i am
with her anymore father
and if im honest with you im kind
of glad to have her off my hands
even if this fellow is
knocking her about
whats it to do with me
what
not everyone can carry
the weight of the world
what about your marriage the
oaths you took  the oaths i took
listen
shes happier now that shes seeing him
a lot more settled down
like a lot calmer and im not
under surveillance anymore
i can just reel in at
whatever time i like
so everybodys happy
wheres the harm in that
shall i cut you a side
of beef to take home
its freshly slaughtered
simon
hello father
why the visit today
its not about my car
its about mrs brennan
youre her boyfriend
i fuck her from time to time
does that make me her boyfriend
does around here  she has a
lot of boyfriends ive heard
how many
you want me to confess to adultery
is that why youre here
somebody beat her up
did she tell you i beat her up
no she didnt
then why are you here
somebody beat her up
its either you or the husband
i dont think jack would beat her up
hes not the type
what is the type
some of them like to be hit you know
who
white women irish women
do not ask me why
youd have to be a psychiatrist
thats nonsense
no no
they like to be hit
in certain situations
they beg for it in fact
so she got what was
coming for her did she
i was speaking generally
oh you were speaking generally
well im speaking specifically
dont do it again
you cannot tell me what to do
were not in the missions now
oh the missions right
are you going to chop off
my hand if i disobey you
you know your history
thats grand
i like to read
you probably think
that black people
yeah yeah black people white people
blah blah blah
run along now father
your sermon is finished
better watch your step there
why is that
if he was him who was laying into her
you have to tread very carefully there
its a very sensitive area
youll have to explain this to me im
afraid youve lost me completely
the church cant be seen to be getting
involved in matters of diversity
do you know
you mean if hes beating her up as one
of those ethnic rituals or something
like when they do that thing
when they shake hands
youre mocking me
now i can tell
we have to be very circumspect in
those areas thats all im saying
ill be very circumspect father
dont you worry about that
hows all
at deaths door you
same still using the old typewriter
i see you have an affectation
my whole life has
been an affectation
one of those lines that sounds witty
and doesnt actually make much sense
caught out again
hows the latest
masterpiece going
better than cecilia hearn but
not as good as beffield
wish i could say that
about everybody
what have you got for me
need anything else
a gun
yeah
a walther ppk
bonds weapon of choice old adolph
killed himself with one in the bunker
thats the plan is it
no intention of riding around in agony
for hours on end when the time comes
not knowing who i
am or where i am
its nonsense
pragmatism
where would i get a gun from
come on now give me a break
youve never been short of guns
in this country have you
youre awfully mournful
today i must say
you dont have any photographs
no
im in agreement with the
apaches on that score
the apaches
the apaches the arapaho
the hunk papa sioux
not even one of mum
dont need a photograph
to remember your mother
memories fade thats whats
so terrible about them
no they dont
not really
i should buy a cane
itd suit you youre
old beyond your years
yeah
give me a feeling
of imperiousness
and you could lean on it
i could lean on it reflectively
point things out
club someone to death with it
a blunt instrument yeah
who though
that young man from dublin
are all instruments blunt
flutes and horns
whos this now
its my daughter fiona
right like a french novel or something
what was the fellows name bernanos
michael fitzgerald ive bought
the big house up the road
havent seen you at mass recently
ive been too busy
thinking of getting a chapel built on
the grounds like brideshead revisited
then you could pop in freelance
and save me the trouble
lovely creature
really expensive too prime horsemeat
interesting man your father
is that right
a good man a fine man nobody around
here has a bad word to say about him
makes you wonder what hes hiding
god youre a fucking prick
oh feisty
fiona
im kidding no offence
meant as they say
do me a favor father swing by the house
one afternoon ive a proposition
really
yes really
a financial proposition that
interests you doesnt it
it would be a black day when the church
is no longer interested in money
huh
inspector stanton
the clergy at this time of the night we
could be getting off to a wild start
well hey father what do you hear
what do you say
im sorry i didnt
realize you had company
sure its only little leo
are you checking out
my ass father
huh no
hes only messing with you father
what can i do for you
theres nothing to hide from leo
right leo
he likes an open book jerry
like your ass
is this a police matter father
no its a personal
a personal thing
its a personal
personal thing
you look worried father my
advice take it on the lamster
you dont want to drop in
for the phonus bolonus
and wind up with a shock
in the kisser get me
hes not in the mood leo
maybe i can cheer up the old sourpuss
ill show you a good time father
good time leo thats me
although it will be extra if
i let you wear that cassock
i know what you holy rollers are like
when youre getting golden hairs
im out of here
hes a character huh
whats troubling you father
you seem agitated
i need a favor
my great grandfathers
said he took it off one
of the cairo gang
when he shot them all
on bloody sunday
the first bloody
sunday obviously
ever had call to use it
yeah
i killed a man once in
the wicklow mountains
what case was that
now youre just pissing me off
somebody been threatening you father
what have you been up to now
if not you who else
what did you say you wanted it for
i didnt say
id say you wanted
it for your dog
the dogs dying its in pain
youre worried you might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days
my dogs dying its in pain
im worried i might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days
compassionate huh well i cant argue
with that im compassionate myself
already had one of those you know
early on
one of what
pedophile priest
twenty years ago
this was in dublin
young girl made a complaint
a rape
what happened
what do you think
i arrested the bastard
and 48 hours later i was packing my
bags and making my way out west
you moved out
reassigned yeah
what happened to him
i was told they were sending him to
one of the missions overseas africa
he could do whatever he
wanted over there i suppose
thanks anyway
like the man says father
protect yourself
how long have you
been in this crap
a couple of years
supposed to be therapeutic
maybe i should take it up
maybe you should
are you seeing
someone in london
do you mean professionally
rather than
lets just stop all this
if you cant talk to me you
should talk to someone
i suppose i should
enjoying yourself
yeah we are yeah
lovely day
yes indeed yeah
stamps
thats the feature
of the priesthood
milo
i need to speak to you father
take a pew literally
why do people kill
themselves father
why do people kill themselves
thats jumping in the deep end
lots of reasons i suppose
why do you think yourself
i dont know the drink depression
lack of sex maybe
youre a presentable man i wouldnt
have thought youd have trouble there
i dont have the gift of the gab
never had it
thats making you feel suicidal
more bored than anything else its
either suicide or joining the army
those are drastic choices
you can learn a trade if you join
you can learn a
trade if you dont
you can experience more of life
you think you can become a more
authentic person by fighting in a war
by killing people
youre against me joining
is what im sensing
lets put it this way
ive always felt theres something
inherently psychopathic
about someone who joins
the army in peacetime
as far as im concerned
people join the army
because they want to find out
what its like to kill someone
i hardly think thats an inclination
that should be encouraged do you
jesus christ didnt
think so either
and the commandment thou
shalt not kill
does not have an
asterisk beside it
referring you to the bottom of the page
with instances where its ok to kill
what about selfdefense
its a tricky one all right
were hardly being
invaded though are we
the war on terror
has no borders
i dont think were high on al
qaedas agenda milo do you
who knows what goes on
in the muslim mind
i have had murderous feelings
though i have to admit
not getting laid its starting to make
me feel really angry towards women
and so i thought well
if i join the army
those inclinations as you call
them would be seen as a plus
on the application they dont come out
and say thats what theyre looking for
in the ads they tell about seeing
the world and all that shite
but i would assume wanting to murder
someone would be like having a degree
it would outweigh my
lack of qualifications
right
do you use pornography
i feel ive exhausted all the
possibilities of pornography
all of them
nearly all of them im on to
transsexual pornography at the moment
chicks with dicks you know
maybe theres a
simpler solution
leave home go somewhere where your
chances of meeting available women
with loose morals are
increased proportionally
should i go to town you mean
no i was thinking more
dublin london new york
new york i might end
up getting the aids
thanks for taking the time
to talk to me father
i cant say its been much help
but its good to get these things
out in the open i suppose
puck
puck
theyve all left me you know
thats why the place is so empty
like a tomb
whos left you
the wife the kids
even consuela and
shes from ecuador
so youd think she wouldnt have that
many options but apparently not
sorry to hear that
you mentioned a
financial proposition
id like to make amends
do penance for past sins
although i suppose all sins are past
otherwise they wouldnt be sins
theyd just be evil thoughts
floating around in your mind
why do you wear the old
soutane by the way
are you trying to
make a statement
i mean look this watch here thats
making a statement a tag heuer
are you going to get to the point mr
fitzgerald or are you going to ramble
let me ask you a question what
do you see when you look at me
ill tell you what you see
you see a handsome
sophisticated
eminent man in the
prime of his life
a colossus lets say who once
bestrode the world of high finance
and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres
im not saying inordinately im
saying significantly lets face it
are you sure i cant tempt you
ill stick to the water
i heard you like to drink
i like it too much
theres no such
thing as too much
theres only not enough
where was i
talking about money what else
now now
got out in time did you
before it all came crashing down
it was the perfect
getaway father
they say charges are going to be filed
against me for various irregularities
but theyre always threatening
things like that
theyd have to charge half the
financiers in ireland and the bankers
and then troop into government
and charge those cunts as well
and we all know thats
not going to happen
no therell be no punishment
forthcoming for a man such as myself
there never is
still i feel a modicum of
guilt about the whole thing
a modicum do you
well
i feel like i ought
to feel guilty
im sure its not
the same thing
i love this one
really expensive
not quite sure what its
supposed to mean though
why does it have
to mean anything
everything has to mean something
otherwise whats the point
of course i dont have to know what
it means i own it thats enough
thats all that matters
ownership possession
how much land does the church own
how much gold
thats the church its not me
you are a representative of
the church are you not
if you say so
i do say so yeah
i think youre a very
judgmental man father
yes i am but i try not to be
you think i dont have feelings
you think i dont care about
i think you dont want
to do penance at all
i think you asked me
here to make fun of me
when you want to do penance sincerely
you can give me a call at any time
and ill try my
best to help you
i could piss on this you know
i said i love it i dont it
doesnt mean anything to me
i could take it down right now and
piss on it do you want me to do that
why would i want you to do that
i dont know
so i can have some sort of
spiritual revelation
some sort of fucking
epiphany huh
ok lets go
ill give you an epiphany
well i dont own it
people like you have pissed on
everything else i suppose so why not
you have your tools done i see
who is it
french couple head on
she was totally unscathed
he got fucked
wrong side of the road
the others hit them
drunk of course
how many
five and im including the frenchman
dear god
marine biologist he was
thats where id like to be
under the sea
where are the others
the morgue best place for them
every life is sacred frank
for gods sake
i know some are less
sacred than others
through this holy anointing may
the lord in his love and mercy
help you
with the grace of
the holy spirit
amen
may the lord who frees you from
sin save you and raise you up
amen
have you performed the
last rites many times
yes usually with older
people of course
they have time to
prepare for it
everybody knows its coming
it is easier
its never easy
more understandable id say
less unfair
in situations like this one
people are shocked
the randomness of it
they curse god they
curse their fellow man
they lose their faith
in some cases
they lose their faith
it must not have been much
of a faith to begin with
if it is so easy for
them to lose it
yes but what is faith
for most people is the fear of death
its nothing more than that
if thats all it is
its very easy to lose
he was a good man your husband
yes
he was a good man
we had a very good life together
we loved each other very much
and now
he has gone
and that is not unfair
that is just what happened
but many people dont
live good lives
they dont feel love
that is why its unfair
i feel sorry for them
will you say a prayer
with me theresa
hail mary full of grace
the lord is with thee
blessed art thou among women and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb jesus
holy mary mother of god
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of death amen
finished with all
your gobbledygook
hows she holding up
shes a strong woman
goodlooking too
i could be in there
ive a thing for widowers
did i ever tell you
i think you might have done your
material is getting a little stale
sure the atheistic doctor
its a clichéd part to play
there arent that
many good lines
one part humanism to nine
parts gallows humor
playing you though now
that might be interesting
playing me whos me
the good priest
excuse me wont you
i have to go kill somebody
how long was i out
ages eons
did i ever tell you the
story about finn mccool
and another big strong
lad called kik satoin
they were at the top of the mountain
they were at the top of the mountain
kik as a challenge throws a boulder
into the sea and iski couldnt do it
finn accepted the challenge
his boulder landed on the shore
creating such waves that the sea
hasnt been the same since
which is why the eastern coast is
renowned internationally for surfing
the boulder finn had thrown
landed here he drew his sword
split the rock in
two and it said
if i shoot someone
foolhardy enough
to pass through the rock three times
theyll be squished into tiny lumps
unceremoniously
not a lot of poetry in that recital
not a lot of romance
im sick to death of romance
he was a japanese writer
committed suicide
he wrote out a list beforehand of all
the famous suicides throughout history
he included christ
sounds like a smartass
in the middle ages theyd just
say i was possessed by demons
maybe you were
maybe they were nearer
the mark back then
you think what happened
was unimportant
insignificant in the great scheme of
things to provoke such a reaction
but what may
but what may mean nothing to you
may be very important to me
id never say it
was unimportant
i just say the choices you
make when youre thirty
are not the same choices you
make when youre sixty
thats irrelevant
every mode of living has its
own logic its own meaning
maybe so
maybe youre right there ill
have to think about that
its a tired old
argument i suppose
but what about those
you leave behind
they belong to myself
not to anybody else
true
false
youll tell me you would have
been in mortal sin i suppose
but i have suffered eternal
damnation father
god is great
the limits of his mercy
have not been set
is this where you
want to be buried
why in hell would i want to be buried
in a godforsaken place like this
where then pèrelachaise
next to dear old oscar
next to apollinaire
and max ophüls
very fancy i must say
i have your gun for you by the way
yeah right
i do so webley circa 1920 still
in good working order though
or so ive been told by
a man who would know
hand it over then
i dont have it on me
i knew it worried i might
follow through with it huh
you might take a pot shot
at me for all i know
why would i do that what have you
ever done to me except talk garbage
that doesnt mean anything
bloody idiots cant even be bothered
with a reason for murder these days
come up to a fellow and
its bang bang bang
i dont know about that some
people have very good reasons
who are you here to see father
freddy joyce
freddy joyce the murd
i know who he is
why the hell do you
want to see him for
hes an old pupil of mine
he asked to see me
you know ive asked
them to hang me
theres no capital punishment in
ireland freddy as you well know
why do you want them to hang you
thats the way leslie ryan died
youre saying you feel remorse
im not a monster do i
look like a monster
what do monsters look like
i had the cops in
here the other day
in third degree wanting to
go over all the gory details
which im sure you were
only too happy to provide
theyre obsessed
with cannibalism
what did it taste like
i told them it tasted like pheasant
a bit gamy
good for you make
a joke about it
why were they
same as always
they want to know who the last one is
the one they never found
the one i connected up
why cant you tell them freddy
to find some kind of peace
i wanted to
father for the life of me i cannot
remember where i put
i mean i know it was
in the woods somewhere
where did i leave my keys
no i wasnt in my right mind
the lsd it was like a
fairytale
you said all that at the trial freddy
its getting kind of tiresome now
she was a lovely
she was a lovely girl
you know she told me that
shed been abused before
so i says once more wont
make any difference then
you see the light go
out in their eyes
and you become god
no you dont
no you dont
why am i here
i just wanted
someone to talk to
i dont think you feel any guilt
whatsoever about anything youve done
i do i do father
i believe what the
bible teaches
i believe that if i repent my
sins then ill be forgiven
and ill be able to
go up to heaven
and ill see those girls and
ill tell them how sorry i am
ill hug them and ill kiss them and
ill love them with the real true love
ill have no desire to
hurt them in any way
god made me didnt he
didnt he
so he understands me
he must do
dont you think
i think if god cant
understand you freddy
no one can
you know theyre
foreclosing on me
who
who the banks who else
sorry to hear that
how come i never hear your
mob preaching about that
about what
about all these bankers who have
brought this country to its knees
still driving people out of their
homes for not making their payments
ever hear your mob
talk about that
those are things
too arent they
yes they are
thats right
i suppose when you have a history of
screwing the jews out of their money
and collaborating
with the nazis
its like the pot calling
the kettle black eh
i suppose it is getting full use out
of your library card there brendan
librarys been shut down
did you not hear cutbacks
youre not dancing milo
i dont like this music
what music do you like
dolly parton
dolly partons good yeah
great cocaine
very moreish
totally medicinal father
how was your man joyce
its been a tough day
lets put it that way
how can you hope to connect
with someone like that
what are you talking about
not freddy joyce
i visited him in prison today
why
a prisoner deserves spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else maybe more so
is that right so
they can find god
and then say god has absolved
them of all their sins
and what they did didnt really matter
anyways cause now theyre saved
something like that yeah
calm down you dont know
what youre talking about
do you mind the drinks
for christs sake
he had that coming a long time
you know yourself
finelooking man
watch yourself with him
i gave up cocaine
a long time ago
you took cocaine
come on lets dance
no no
howd they call it in your day jive
no no
come on
forgive me father
for i have sinned
say one our father
and ten hail marys
ive sinned more than that
make an ascent to croagh patrick then
on your knees
on my knees is it
what made you say that
your church is on fire
fuck off brendan im not in the mood
youre church is on fire
jesus christ
i called the fire
brigade father
for all the good itll do
theyll never get here in time
why didnt anybody see
daddy stay away
daddy come away
why didnt anybody see
theyre probably going
to blame you for this
professional job id
say that for them
any fool can start a
fire for fucks sake
whod do a thing like this
somebody with a grudge against
the church obviously
that could be half the country
unless its a personal angle
howd you mean  nobody had a
grudge against your father no
whod have a grudge against you
maybe this is the future huh
maybe itll all
be ruins one day
maybe one day kids will say in
amazement they used to believe in what
and all that up in the sky
and if were good well go to heaven
and if were bad well go to hell
you know for a policeman you seem to
know very little about human nature
maybe youre right you
know more than me
dont touch anything now
have to get the forensics boys down
the supercilious pricks
what do we do now
well have to rebuild
it i suppose
maybe use bricks next time
might be a good idea
oh god father
is this about the coke i
can take it or leave it
really
yeah most people can
the only ones who cant have
problems to begin with
we shouldnt write them off though the
ones who have problems to begin with
what do you want to do
with your life veronica
nothing
consider the lilies of the
field how they grow
they toil not neither
do they spin
very nice quotation
sure everybody knows that one
hackneyed yeah
its like turn the other cheek
or judge not lest you be judged
id like to be an
actress maybe
ive an absent father
and domineering mother
thats a start
when did your dad leave
he didnt leave he was killed
murdered
hunting accident
completely random
so theres no use persevering father
im a lost cause
no one is a lost
cause veronica
who is it
i dont know who it is
you said you did
ive no evidence
its the same man
its the same man takes a lot
of nerve to burn down a church
helps if you have a burning sense of
grievance if youll pardon the
we have to ask ourselves
what does this man want
he wants to be loved of course
we all want to be loved
failing that he wants to be
admired
failing that he
wants to be feared
failing that he wants to
be hated and despised
you should beware the man who
wants to be hated and despised
dont you think
i think you read that in
a book your excellency
i think he wants to stir up some sort
of feelings in others thats true
doesnt want to be
ignored any more
wants to make contact
he made contact all right
who is it
dreadful business i must say
some little blackguard running
riot i wouldnt wonder
what can you do in
this day and age
true that
sorry about the
other day father
that was the drink talking
what can we do for you
its off the bat with what i was saying
and it seems more necessary than ever
id like to make a donation
that would be grand
to salve your conscience
surely thats in the nature of all
philanthropy the expiation of guilt
im sure youve nothing major to
feel guilty about mr fitzgerald
youd be surprised father
call me michael
michael it is any charity is
always gratefully received
i know
i believe thats
church doctrine
the church needs all the help it can get
especially these days
why would you say that
well with all the compensation thats
been paid out over the last few years
and thats only the yanks we
all know they werent worst
i dont know about that most of
those cases were 40 or 50 years ago
raking up old ground it
always seemed to me
time to forgive and forget
i agree i agree
whats past is past
time to move on
etcetera etcetera
would you like a cup of tea michael
or maybe something stronger
do you have any crystal meth
no no i cant stop
so what are we talking about
ten twenty
twenty thousand
twenty thousand euros yeah
well that would be grand
that would help us getting the initial
building work off the ground
twenty it is then
this is a david oscarson pen
its really expensive
its lovely
why not make it fifty
well father
if money is no object
make it fifty
why not make it a hundred
it means nothing to me
i know it doesnt
100000 euros for your pet project father
what do you say to that
i say thank you mr
fitzgerald
what was stanton getting on
if i could tell you i would
you know that
i thought i was the one that was
supposed to be in trouble not you
hows the fish
too many little bones
isnt that always the way
not stopping
meeting a fellow
youre informing me of
your adultery in advance
isnt that more honest
than in the confessional
when its all done and dusted and
theres nothing you can do about it
what are you
expecting him to do
stop me from committing
a mortal sin
you have to stop yourself
i cant stop you
then what good are you at all
theres my ride as it were
lets do this again sometime
do you have to put up with that
kind of shit on a regular basis
theres a lot of it going
around lets put it that way
we really should talk you know
let it all out
like in one of those
shit plays at the abbey
i dont know what the
revelation would be though
neither do i
your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us i know that
it was a long goodbye
if ever there was one
sometimes i wish she hadnt
hanged on as long as she did
she was stubborn all right
brave too though
wonder if ill be as brave
when the time comes
it wasnt just her dying
you were missing in action a long time
before and after
when i needed you most
i was never neglectful
i dont think
never hit you or anything
there are other
forms of violence
i know there are attempting
suicide for one
jesus i walked into that one
its not only violence
against yourself either
it wasnt intended that way
i never meant to hurt you
how could it not hurt me
i love you
i love you too
dont ever doubt that
dad
and just when i thought
i had you back
and you were shipshape and
rearing to go go you did
i thought it would
be another woman
i have a vocation i
wasnt trying to escape
i know that i know
youre sincere
but dad the fact remains
first mum went away and
then you went away
i lost two parents for
the price of one
i never ran anywhere
i stayed here
i think youre being a
bit naive there father
im still here
ill always be here
will you
you promise
ill always be here
and youll always be here
how was that for a
third act revelation
corny
but i like it
here
heres mud in your eye
great stuff
you know i can tell when
youre really getting old
how
no one ever says the word
death around you anymore
bruno bruno

conversation to me
where the hell did
you get to honey
ive been looking
all over for you
large one
you sure about that
whiskey i said
who burnt down your church father
if you dont mind me asking
its not my church
its our church
id say it was the romanians
theyre awful heathens
the romanians
what romanians do we
have around here
theyre always hanging around romanians
getting up to no good
must be someone who
doesnt like you father
i think it must be one of the
good people in this town
you should join the garda simon
with your powers of deduction
these measures huh father like a
buttercup in the mouth of a cow
pint there please brendan
so youre sure theres a
god then father yeah
im not kidding
im being serious im asking
because im having doubts myself
im having a crisis of faith
dont be getting offended
fa im sorry really i am
as sure as a hole in the ground
dont be going away mad
im an awful messer
hey father what do you hear
what do you say
youre back so
ive got a lot of clients in this town
from the hoi polloi to the masses
ive got to keep my ass
lubricated at all times
hoi polloi are the masses of society
youre using the phrase incorrectly
you know that maybe so father
i didnt get no education see
i was getting fucked in the ass
and fucked in the face all day
wasnt no time for any of that
i was sucking the prick of a bishop
on a regular basis you get me
how did you like that
play smart ass
you need help
youre starting to
sound a little screwy
maybe you need to see a
headshrinker yourself
do you need help are you ok
hey father
theres nothing wrong with me father
all right
im feeling fine
you know
when i first started out working up in
dublin there was this 3yearold boy
parents brought him into the hospital
a routine operation
but the anesthetist
made a mistake
little boy ended up
deaf dumb blind
and paralyzed for good
think of it
think when that little boy
first regained consciousness
in the dark youd be
frightened wouldnt you
youd be frightened in the kind of a way
that you know the fear is going to end
has to
must your parents
couldnt be too far away
theyll come to your rescue
theyll turn the light on
theyll talk to you
but think of it
nobody comes to rescue you
no light is turned on
you are in the dark
you try to speak
but you cant
you try to move
but you cant
you try to cry out but you are
unable to hear your own screams
you are entombed
within your own body
howling with terror
what the fuck
why the fuck would you
tell me a story like that
no reason
some people are awfully touchy
good luck
time to go come on
youre still drinking
same again
time to go i said
is that an order
you dont like taking
orders father
you do not mind giving them
these kinds are all alike
my kind
yeah your kind
your time is gone and you dont
even fucking realize it
my time will never be gone
did you hear that the
arrogance of the man
you need to be a
little more humble
needs to be taken down a peg or two
thats what he needs
take me down then
go on i fucking dare you
jesus christ
what happened to you
brendan lynch
brendan lynch hes a buddhist
so what if hes a fucking buddhist you
think buddhists dont beat people up
you think buddhists dont fuck
their kids like everyone else
youre obviously very upset
tibetans spit on blind people in the
street their killing albinos in africa
youre so fucking naive
please dont curse
at me father
i think it would be best to continue
this conversation in the morning sober
why are you a fucking
priest at all
you should be a fucking accountant
or a fucking insurance man
terrible
lets go home
what is it
nothing
youre leaving
i think its for the best
because of last night
because of a lot of things
not just last night or
whats happened here
ive been having doubts
if you must know
listen im sorry about
what i said last night
you said what you said with such venom i
didnt realize you hated me that much
i dont hate you at all
then why
its just you have no integrity
thats the worse i can
say about anybody
well thats
thats just
hope you find what youre looking for
good luck
father
hello
youre going to dublin
yeah
just getting away for
a while you know
i heard about your church
terrible thing
yes
you must be very upset
yes i am
im bringing him home
to his family in italy
dublin and then rome
how have you been
people here have been
very kind to me
i mean
you know sometimes i
think i cannot go on
but
i will go on
father
little early for mass
dr hart was out fishing at the crack of
dawn he begrudgingly gave me a ride
where are you headed
just down the beach there
can i come along
not really no maybe later
thats fine yeah
i wont keep you
did you finish your book
yes i did i dont
know how good it is
im sure itll be extraordinary
youre a very fine writer
thank you james
you know you changed the subject the
other day when we were talking
what was the subject
you know what the subject was i think
you committed a sin of omission
im sure there are worse
sins than sins of omission
ill let you be the expert
in that department father
i think theres too much talk
about sins to be honest
not enough talk about virtues
you might be right
what would be your number one
i think forgiveness has
been highly underrated
i forgive you
do you forgive me
always
thinking of throwing yourself in
they say thats the easy way out
nothing easy about it i
wouldnt have thought
im in a bad way father
no im not putting you on
the truth is ive been
in a bad way for
a long time
no will to do anything
feeling of nothing
being worthwhile
a sense of disassociation
detachment
i had a wife and kids
they meant nothing to me
i have money it
means nothing to me
i have life
and it means nothing to me
where do you think it comes from
the sense of detachment
from nowhere
from nowhere
listen i have to
meet someone now
ill call on you after
well talk
get you back on track ok
ok
thank you
thank you father
thank you
you all right
yeah
take your hands out of your pockets
slowly
why
i heard you had a gun
i have to say im surprised thought
id have to go looking for you
just cause im here doesnt mean
you have to go through with it
yes it does
its one of those cell
phone selling properties
did you ever think it would
come to this though huh
i was hoping it wouldnt i thought
you were a friend of mine
your friend is just an enemy
you havent made yet
cheap cynicism
not cheap now no
its a cynicism
thats been hard won
its a cynicism
thats been earned
over a hell of a lot of physical
and psychological torture
i take it back then but
its cynicism none the less
maybe thats the
difference between us
oh thats not the
only difference
any regrets
oh yeah never got to
finish moby dick
the whale kills ahab
is that right
then he destroys the rest of the
ship and the crew along with it
all except for ishmael
he alone escapes to tell thee
the burning of the
church i can understand
you didnt have to kill my dog
i didnt kill your dog i love dogs
why would i do a thing like that
i found him with his throat cut
why would i fucking kill a dog
i didnt
that had nothing to do with me
im wholly innocent
of that crime
i did give veronica a bit of a
shove that one time though
i do admit that and
im sorry for it
did it upset you the dog
yes it did
did you cry
yes i did
thats nice
and when you read what your fellow
priests did to all those poor children
all those years
did you cry then
i asked you a question
did you cry then
no
thats right
i suppose
what
i suppose i felt attachment
yeah
when you read
yeah yeah
something in a newspaper
detach yourself from that
we were the lucky ones
theres bodies burning back there
burning like dogs
dont look at me
turn your face away
dont look at me
no run mícheál run
ill get stanton father
he reminds me of me
