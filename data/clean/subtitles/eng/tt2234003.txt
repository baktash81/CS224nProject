it s certainly a
startling opening line 
what is that  irony 
i m sorry  let s start again 
what do you want to say to me 
i m here to listen to
whatever you have to say 
i was raped by a priest
when i was seven years old 
orally and anally as they
say in the court reports 
this went on for five years 
every other day for five years 
i bled a lot  as you can imagine
i bled a terrible amount 
  have you spoken to anyone about this 
  i m speaking to you  now 
i mean  have you sought
professional help 
why  so i could learn how to cope  so
that i could learn how to live with it 
maybe i don t want to cope  maybe i don t
want to learn how to live with it 
did you make a formal complaint 
did you testify 
the man s dead 
i don t know what to say to you 
i have no answer for
you  i m sorry 
what good would it do anyway
if he were still alive 
what would be the point
of killing the bastard 
that would be no news  there s no
point in killing a bad priest 
killing a good one 
that would be a shock 
they wouldn t know
what to make of that 
i m going to kill you  father 
i m going to kill you  cause
you ve done nothing wrong 
i m going to kill you
because you re innocent 
not right now  though 
i ll give you enough time
to put your house in order 
make your peace with god 
sunday week  let s say 
i ll meet you down by the
beach  down by the water there 
killing a priest on a sunday 
that ll be a good one 
nothing to say to me  father 
not right now  no  but i m sure i ll
think of something by sunday week 
  body of christ 
  amen 
a little too much
wine again  mícheál 
sorry  father 
i m wondering is this some
kind of ploy on your behalf 
ploy  father 
i ve noticed my stocks of booze appear
to be    somewhat diminished of late 
i m wondering is this some
kind of ploy you re working 
cover up for the wine you ve
been imbibing on the q t 
i ve no idea what you re talking about 
father leary noticed nothing amiss 
father leary does not know you
as well as i do  mícheál 
he may well underestimate the depths
of your machiavellian chicanery 
can i go now  father 
what s the hurry  have they called
a meeting at mafia headquarters 
on your way 
things you hear in
confession these days 
  it s depressing 
  you have to detach yourself from it 
we re here to provide solace  your
personal feelings don t come into it 
i know that  what
do you take me for 
it s difficult  though  the mess
people make of their lives 
what s the problem  without
going into details  obviously 
that woman with the big black
eye  have you seen her 
  veronica brennan  yeah 
  she s an odd one 
things she comes up with  think she s
trying to drag you down into the muck 
do you know what  felching  is 
i do know what
 felching  is  yeah 
  i had to look it up 
  this is you not going into details 
sorry  anyway  whatever is wrong with
her has obviously gotten out of hand 
she s got knocked around now 
well if you say it to her
she ll raise holy hell 
say it on the basis of something
she said during confession 
i know  i know  we
can t have that 
she could be
excommunicated  the cow 
i ll have a word with her  jack as well 
pastoral duties and what have you 
nothing to do with her confession 
see what s going on 
that colored fellow  the    ugandan 
he s one of her lovers  i think 
simon s from the ivory coast 
right  i knew it was that or guyana
or one of those african countries 
guyana is in south america 
don t think so  father  i was
always pretty good at geography 
not bad 
surprisingly 
i was expecting a daub 
who are these two lads 
don t know  i m reading
these ghost stories 
maybe it s got something
to do with that 
spooky 
so  did you know who it was 
yes  i know who it was 
do you know him well 
well enough 
knowing this man as you do    do
you think it was an idle threat 
i don t know  i m not sure 
if you re not sure  it
means it s possible 
yes  i suppose 
you didn t grant him
absolution  obviously 
he didn t ask for it 
there you have it  the man is not penitent 
there s no contrition 
he s threatening to commit a crime 
not asking for forgiveness for one 
the inviolability of the
sacramental seal does not apply 
you re saying i should
go to the police 
i m not saying anything  james 
the choice is yours 
don t tell me  you made
the classic error 
you re supposed to cut
down  not across 
this is bruno 
and i always wanted a
fast car  a red one 
i thought you d already
had your midlife crisis 
you re a very
nice looking young woman 
thank you 
i like your bow tie 
it s got polka dots 
this is my daughter fiona  milo 
she s over from london 
  you re having me on 
  i m not having you on 
  but you re a priest    i was
married before i became a priest 
my wife and i had a child
  fiona  my wife died   
and after that i
joined the priesthood 
  you can do that  can you 
  it would appear so 
don t tell me  you made
the classic error 
  i ve already done that guide  frank
  you re supposed to cut down 
  i said i ve already done it 
  now  now 
drop of the hard
stuff for yourself 
a generous serving of the old water of
life for this beautiful  yet troubled   
fuck off 
an exceedingly dotty mouth 
i like that in a whore 
brendan  now s not the time 
whatever you say  father 
you re the boss 
how s that working out for you 
  i haven t been out in a good while 
  so you say 
no  no  i ve been a very good lad 
and don t change the subject 
what was the subject 
  you know what the subject was 
  oh  daddy  a man  a man  what else 
it s getting to be
a habit  honey 
i know  it s pathetic  i
can t do anything right 
nice shades 
do they make me
look like jackie o 
not really 
this what you came to go about 
nasty  huh 
interesting color 
they say you can find beauty in
everything  if you look hard enough 
and i d say you can find
beauty in most things 
not everything  that s nonsense 
what would i know  i m
just an old washer woman 
listen  if you don t want
to talk to me  that s fine 
i m not here to compel
you to do anything 
you never know  father  maybe i d like
to be compelled  maybe i d enjoy it 
i ll have a word with jack  see
what he has to say for himself 
grand inquisitor  go
and hear for yourself 
i m sure he ll be only too pleased to
have someone else to bore the ears off 
i stopped listening to his
old shite a long time ago 
that s how it is  is it  i m
sorry  i didn t realize 
you thought we were another
grace kelly and prince rainier 
i know it wasn t a very happy marriage 
so it s not a great analogy 
you know that s what i ve
always liked about you  father 
you re just a little too
sharp for this parish 
fine fellow he was  decapitated the two
of them  blood all over the place 
  hi  father 
  jack 
could i have a word  in private 
sounds ominous 
where s johnnie cochran
when you need him 
i hope we don t get locked in here 
we d have to make love to keep warm 
i had a word with
veronica  jack 
out at the house  are you 
is everything all right 
everything s fine  i mean
now  everything s not fine 
mass on sunday  with the
shades and everything 
  oh  that 
  yes  that 
are you laying into her
or what s going on 
i wasn t mean to her  no  that s that
black fellow that she s been seeing 
i mean that colored
fellow she s been seeing 
i didn t mean to be racist 
that was a slip of the tongue 
  you re saying he beat her up 
  that s what i m assuming  yeah 
the way she speaks in riddles  i
can t make any sense out of her 
i think she s bipolar  or lactose
intolerant  one of the two 
i don t know where i am
with her anymore  father 
and if i m honest with you  i m kind
of glad to have her off my hands 
even if this fellow is
knocking her about 
what s it to do with me 
what 
not everyone can carry
the weight of the world 
  what about your marriage  the
oaths you took    the oaths i took 
listen   
she s happier  now that she s seeing him 
a lot more settled down 
like a lot calmer  and i m not
under surveillance anymore 
i can just reel in at
whatever time i like 
so everybody s happy 
where s the harm in that 
shall i cut you a side
of beef to take home 
it s freshly slaughtered 
  simon 
  hello  father 
why the visit today 
it s not about my car 
it s about mrs  brennan 
you re her boyfriend 
i fuck her from time to time 
does that make me her boyfriend 
  does around here    she has a
lot of boyfriends  i ve heard 
how many 
you want me to confess to adultery 
is that why you re here 
somebody beat her up 
  did she tell you i beat her up 
  no  she didn t 
then why are you here 
somebody beat her up 
it s either you or the husband 
i don t think jack would beat her up 
he s not the type 
what is the type 
  some of them like to be hit  you know 
  who 
white women  irish women 
do not ask me why 
  you d have to be a psychiatrist 
  that s nonsense 
no  no 
they like to be hit 
in certain situations 
they beg for it in fact 
so she got what was
coming for her  did she 
  i was speaking generally 
  oh  you were speaking generally 
well  i m speaking specifically 
  don t do it again 
  you cannot tell me what to do 
  we re not in the missions now 
  oh  the missions  right 
are you going to chop off
my hand if i disobey you 
you know your history 
that s grand 
i like to read 
you probably think
that black people   
yeah  yeah  black people  white people 
blah  blah  blah 
run along now  father 
your sermon is finished 
better watch your step there 
why is that 
if he was him who was laying into her 
you have to tread very carefully there 
it s a very sensitive area 
you ll have to explain this to me  i m
afraid you ve lost me completely 
the church can t be seen to be getting
involved in matters of diversity 
do you know 
you mean if he s beating her up as one
of those ethnic rituals or something 
like when they do that thing
when they shake hands 
you re mocking me
now  i can tell 
we have to be very circumspect in
those areas  that s all i m saying 
i ll be very circumspect  father 
don t you worry about that 
how s all 
at death s door  you 
same  still using the old typewriter 
i see  you have an affectation 
my whole life has
been an affectation 
one of those lines that sounds witty
and doesn t actually make much sense 
caught out again 
how s the latest
masterpiece going 
better than  cecilia hearn  but
not as good as  beffield  
wish i could say that
about everybody 
what have you got for me 
need anything else 
  a gun 
  yeah 
a walther ppk 
bond s weapon of choice  old adolph
killed himself with one in the bunker 
that s the plan  is it 
no intention of riding around in agony
for hours on end when the time comes 
not knowing who i
am or where i am 
it s nonsense 
pragmatism 
where would i get a gun from 
come on  now  give me a break 
you ve never been short of guns
in this country  have you 
you re awfully mournful
today  i must say 
you don t have any photographs 
no 
i m in agreement with the
apaches on that score 
the apaches 
the apaches  the arapaho 
the hunk papa sioux 
not even one of mum 
don t need a photograph
to remember your mother 
memories fade  that s what s
so terrible about them 
no  they don t 
not really 
i should buy a cane 
it d suit you  you re
old beyond your years 
yeah 
give me a feeling
of imperiousness 
  and you could lean on it 
  i could lean on it  reflectively 
point things out 
club someone to death with it 
a blunt instrument  yeah 
who  though 
that young man from dublin 
are all instruments blunt 
flutes and horns 
who s this now 
it s my daughter  fiona 
right  like a french novel or something 
what was the fellow s name  bernanos 
michael fitzgerald  i ve bought
the big house up the road 
  haven t seen you at mass recently 
  i ve been too busy 
thinking of getting a chapel built on
the grounds  like brideshead revisited 
then you could pop in freelance
and save me the trouble 
  lovely creature 
  really expensive too  prime horsemeat 
  interesting man  your father 
  is that right 
a good man  a fine man  nobody around
here has a bad word to say about him 
  makes you wonder what he s hiding 
  god  you re a fucking prick 
  oh  feisty 
  fiona   
i m kidding  no offence
meant  as they say 
do me a favor  father  swing by the house
one afternoon  i ve a proposition 
  really 
  yes  really 
a financial proposition  that
interests you  doesn t it 
it would be a black day when the church
is no longer interested in money 
huh 
inspector stanton 
the clergy at this time of the night  we
could be getting off to a wild start 
well  hey father  what do you hear 
what do you say 
i m sorry  i didn t
realize you had company 
sure  it s only little leo 
are you checking out
my ass  father 
huh  no 
he s only messing with you  father 
what can i do for you 
there s nothing to hide from leo 
right  leo 
he likes an open book  jerry 
like your ass 
is this a police matter  father 
no  it s a personal   
a personal thing 
it s a personal   
personal thing 
you look worried  father  my
advice  take it on the lamster 
you don t want to drop in
for the phonus bolonus   
and wind up with a shock
in the kisser  get me 
  he s not in the mood  leo 
  maybe i can cheer up the old sourpuss 
i ll show you a good time  father 
good time leo  that s me 
although it will be extra if
i let you wear that cassock 
i know what you holy rollers are like
when you re getting golden hairs 
i m out of here 
he s a character  huh 
what s troubling you  father 
you seem agitated 
i need a favor 
my great grandfather s 
said he took it off one
of the cairo gang   
when he shot them all
on bloody sunday 
the first bloody
sunday  obviously 
  ever had call to use it 
  yeah 
i killed a man once in
the wicklow mountains 
what case was that 
now you re just pissing me off 
somebody been threatening you  father 
what have you been up to now 
if not you  who else 
  what did you say you wanted it for 
  i didn t say 
i d say you wanted
it for your dog 
the dog s dying  it s in pain 
you re worried you might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days 
my dog s dying  it s in pain 
i m worried i might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days 
compassionate  huh  well i can t argue
with that  i m compassionate myself 
already had one of those  you know 
early on 
  one of what 
  pedophile priest 
twenty years ago 
this was in dublin 
young girl made a complaint 
a rape 
  what happened 
  what do you think 
i arrested the bastard 
and 48 hours later i was packing my
bags and making my way out west 
  you moved out 
  reassigned  yeah 
what happened to him 
i was told they were sending him to
one of the missions overseas  africa 
he could do whatever he
wanted over there  i suppose 
  thanks  anyway 
  like the man says  father 
protect yourself 
how long have you
been in this crap 
a couple of years 
supposed to be therapeutic 
  maybe i should take it up 
  maybe you should 
are you seeing
someone in london 
do you mean professionally 
rather than   
let s just stop all this   
if you can t talk to me you
should talk to someone 
i suppose i should 
enjoying yourself 
yeah  we are  yeah 
lovely day 
yes indeed  yeah 
stamps 
that s the feature
of the priesthood 
milo 
i need to speak to you  father 
take a pew  literally 
why do people kill
themselves  father 
why do people kill themselves 
that s jumping in the deep end 
lots of reasons  i suppose 
why do you think yourself 
i don t know  the drink  depression   
lack of sex  maybe 
you re a presentable man  i wouldn t
have thought you d have trouble there 
i don t have the gift of the gab 
never had it 
that s making you feel suicidal 
more bored than anything else  it s
either suicide or joining the army 
  those are drastic choices 
  you can learn a trade if you join 
you can learn a
trade if you don t 
you can experience more of life 
you think you can become a more
authentic person by fighting in a war 
by killing people 
you re against me joining
is what i m sensing 
let s put it this way 
i ve always felt there s something
inherently psychopathic   
about someone who joins
the army in peacetime 
as far as i m concerned
people join the army   
because they want to find out
what it s like to kill someone 
i hardly think that s an inclination
that should be encouraged  do you 
jesus christ didn t
think so either 
and the commandment  thou
shalt not kill    
does not have an
asterisk beside it 
referring you to the bottom of the page 
with instances where it s ok to kill 
what about self defense 
it s a tricky one  all right 
we re hardly being
invaded  though  are we 
the war on terror
has no borders 
i don t think we re high on al
qaeda s agenda  milo  do you 
who knows what goes on
in the muslim mind 
i have had murderous feelings 
though  i have to admit 
not getting laid  it s starting to make
me feel really angry towards women 
and so i thought  well 
if i join the army   
those inclinations  as you call
them  would be seen as a plus 
on the application  they don t come out
and say that s what they re looking for 
in the ads they tell about seeing
the world and all that shite 
but i would assume wanting to murder
someone would be like having a degree 
it would outweigh my
lack of qualifications 
right 
do you use pornography 
i feel i ve exhausted all the
possibilities of pornography 
all of them 
nearly all of them  i m on to
transsexual pornography at the moment 
chicks with dicks  you know 
maybe there s a
simpler solution 
leave home  go somewhere where your
chances of meeting available women   
with loose morals are
increased proportionally 
should i go to town  you mean 
no  i was thinking more
dublin  london  new york 
new york  i might end
up getting the aids 
thanks for taking the time
to talk to me  father 
i can t say it s been much help 
but it s good to get these things
out in the open  i suppose 
puck 
puck 
they ve all left me  you know 
that s why the place is so empty 
like a tomb 
who s left you 
the wife  the kids 
even consuela  and
she s from ecuador 
so you d think she wouldn t have that
many options  but apparently not 
sorry to hear that 
you mentioned a
financial proposition 
i d like to make amends 
do penance for past sins 
although  i suppose all sins are past 
otherwise they wouldn t be sins 
they d just be    evil thoughts 
floating around in your mind 
why do you wear the old
soutane  by the way 
are you trying to
make a statement 
i mean  look  this watch  here  that s
making a statement  a tag heuer 
are you going to get to the point  mr 
fitzgerald  or are you going to ramble 
let me ask you a question  what
do you see when you look at me 
i ll tell you what you see 
you see a handsome 
sophisticated 
eminent man in the
prime of his life 
a colossus  let s say  who once
bestrode the world of high finance   
and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres 
i m not saying inordinately  i m
saying significantly  let s face it 
are you sure i can t tempt you 
i ll stick to the water 
i heard you like to drink 
i like it too much 
there s no such
thing as too much 
there s only not enough 
where was i 
talking about money  what else 
now  now 
  got out in time  did you 
  before it all came crashing down 
it was the perfect
getaway  father 
they say charges are going to be filed
against me  for various irregularities 
but they re always threatening
things like that 
they d have to charge half the
financiers in ireland  and the bankers 
and then troop into government
and charge those cunts as well 
and we all know that s
not going to happen 
no  there ll be no punishment
forthcoming for a man such as myself 
there never is 
still  i feel a    modicum of
guilt about the whole thing 
  a modicum  do you 
  well   
i feel like i ought
to feel guilty 
i m sure it s not
the same thing 
i love this one 
really expensive 
not quite sure what it s
supposed to mean  though 
why does it have
to mean anything 
everything has to mean something 
otherwise  what s the point 
of course  i don t have to know what
it means  i own it  that s enough 
that s all that matters 
ownership  possession 
how much land does the church own 
how much gold 
that s the church  it s not me 
you are a representative of
the church  are you not 
  if you say so 
  i do say so  yeah 
i think you re a very
judgmental man  father 
yes i am  but i try not to be 
you think i don t have feelings 
you think i don t care about   
i think you don t want
to do penance at all 
i think you asked me
here to make fun of me 
when you want to do penance sincerely 
you can give me a call  at any time 
and i ll try my
best to help you 
i could piss on this  you know 
i said i love it  i don t  it
doesn t mean anything to me 
i could take it down right now and
piss on it  do you want me to do that 
  why would i want you to do that 
  i don t know 
so i can have some sort of   
spiritual revelation 
some sort of fucking
epiphany  huh 
ok  let s go 
i ll give you an epiphany 
well  i don t own it 
people like you have pissed on
everything else  i suppose  so why not 
you have your tools done  i see 
who is it 
french couple  head on 
she was totally unscathed 
he got fucked 
wrong side of the road 
the others hit them
drunk  of course 
  how many 
  five  and i m including the frenchman 
dear god 
marine biologist he was 
that s where i d like to be   
under the sea 
  where are the others 
  the morgue  best place for them 
every life is sacred  frank 
for god s sake 
i know  some are less
sacred than others 
through this holy anointing may
the lord in his love and mercy   
help you   
with the grace of
the holy spirit 
amen 
may the lord who frees you from
sin save you    and raise you up 
amen 
have you performed the
last rites many times 
yes  usually with older
people  of course 
they have time to
prepare for it 
everybody knows it s coming 
it is easier 
it s never easy 
more understandable  i d say 
less unfair 
in situations like this one 
people are shocked 
the randomness of it 
they curse god  they
curse their fellow man 
they lose their faith
in some cases 
they lose their faith 
it must not have been much
of a faith to begin with 
if it is so easy for
them to lose it 
yes  but what is faith   
for most people is the fear of death 
it s nothing more than that 
if that s all it is 
it s very easy to lose 
he was a good man  your husband 
yes 
he was a good man 
we had a very good life together 
we loved each other very much 
and now   
he has gone 
and that is not unfair 
that is just what happened 
but many people don t
live good lives 
they don t feel love 
that is why it s unfair 
i feel sorry for them 
will you say a prayer
with me  theresa 
hail mary  full of grace 
the lord is with thee 
blessed art thou among women  and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb  jesus 
holy mary  mother of god 
pray for us sinners now 
and at the hour of death  amen 
finished with all
your gobbledygook 
how s she holding up 
  she s a strong woman 
  good looking too 
i could be in there 
i ve a thing for widowers 
did i ever tell you 
i think you might have done  your
material is getting a little stale 
sure  the atheistic doctor 
it s a clichéd part to play 
there aren t that
many good lines 
one part humanism to nine
parts gallows humor 
playing you  though  now 
that might be interesting 
playing me  who s me 
the good priest 
excuse me  won t you 
i have to go kill somebody 
how long was i out 
ages  eons 
did i ever tell you the
story about finn mccool 
and another big strong
lad called kik satoin 
  they were at the top of the mountain 
  they were at the top of the mountain 
kik as a challenge throws a boulder
into the sea and iski couldn t do it 
finn accepted the challenge 
his boulder landed on the shore 
creating such waves that the sea
hasn t been the same since 
which is why the eastern coast is
renowned internationally for surfing 
the boulder finn had thrown
landed here  he drew his sword 
split the rock in
two and it said 
if i shoot someone
foolhardy enough   
to pass through the rock three times 
they ll be squished into tiny lumps 
unceremoniously 
not a lot of poetry in that recital 
not a lot of romance 
i m sick to death of romance 
he was a japanese writer 
committed suicide 
he wrote out a list beforehand of all
the famous suicides throughout history 
he included christ 
sounds like a smart ass 
in the middle ages they d just
say i was possessed by demons 
maybe you were 
maybe they were nearer
the mark back then 
you think what happened
was unimportant 
insignificant in the great scheme of
things to provoke such a reaction 
but what may   
but what may mean nothing to you
may be very important to me 
i d never say it
was unimportant 
i just say the choices you
make when you re thirty   
are not the same choices you
make when you re sixty 
that s irrelevant 
every mode of living has its
own logic  its own meaning 
maybe so 
maybe you re right there  i ll
have to think about that 
it s a tired old
argument  i suppose 
but what about those
you leave behind 
they belong to myself 
not to anybody else 
true 
false 
you ll tell me you would have
been in mortal sin  i suppose 
but i have suffered eternal
damnation  father 
god is great 
the limits of his mercy
have not been set 
is this where you
want to be buried 
why in hell would i want to be buried
in a god forsaken place like this 
where  then  père lachaise 
next to dear old oscar 
next to apollinaire
and max ophüls 
very fancy  i must say 
  i have your gun for you by the way 
  yeah  right 
i do so  webley  circa 1920  still
in good working order  though 
or so i ve been told by
a man who would know 
  hand it over  then 
  i don t have it on me 
i knew it  worried i might
follow through with it  huh 
you might take a pot shot
at me  for all i know 
why would i do that  what have you
ever done to me except talk garbage 
that doesn t mean anything 
bloody idiots can t even be bothered
with a reason for murder these days 
come up to a fellow and
it s bang  bang  bang 
i don t know about that  some
people have very good reasons 
who are you here to see  father 
freddy joyce 
  freddy joyce  the murd   
  i know who he is 
why the hell do you
want to see him for 
he s an old pupil of mine 
he asked to see me 
you know i ve asked
them to hang me 
there s no capital punishment in
ireland  freddy  as you well know 
  why do you want them to hang you 
  that s the way leslie ryan died 
you re saying you feel remorse 
i m not a monster  do i
look like a monster 
what do monsters look like 
i had the cops in
here the other day 
in third degree  wanting to
go over all the gory details 
which i m sure you were
only too happy to provide 
they re obsessed
with cannibalism 
 what did it taste like  
i told them it tasted like pheasant 
a bit gamy 
good for you  make
a joke about it 
  why were they    
  same as always 
they want to know who the last one is 
the one they never found 
the one i connected up 
why can t you tell them  freddy 
to find some kind of peace 
i wanted to   
father  for the life of me  i cannot   
remember where i put   
i mean  i know it was
in the woods somewhere 
  where did i leave my keys 
  no  i wasn t in my right mind 
the lsd    it was like a   
fairytale 
you said all that at the trial  freddy 
it s getting kind of tiresome now 
she was a lovely   
she was a lovely girl 
you know she told me that
she d been abused before 
so i says  once more won t
make any difference  then 
you see the light go
out in their eyes   
  and you become god 
  no you don t 
no you don t 
why am i here 
i just wanted
someone to talk to 
i don t think you feel any guilt
whatsoever  about anything you ve done 
i do  i do  father 
i believe what the
bible teaches 
i believe that if i repent my
sins  then i ll be forgiven 
and i ll be able to
go up to heaven 
and i ll see those girls and
i ll tell them how sorry i am 
i ll hug them and i ll kiss them  and
i ll love them with the real  true love 
i ll have no desire to
hurt them in any way 
god made me  didn t he 
didn t he 
so he understands me 
he must do 
don t you think 
i think if god can t
understand you  freddy   
no one can 
you know they re
foreclosing on me 
  who 
  who  the banks  who else 
sorry to hear that 
how come i never hear your
mob preaching about that 
about what 
about all these bankers who have
brought this country to its knees 
still driving people out of their
homes for not making their payments 
ever hear your mob
talk about that 
those are things
too  aren t they 
yes  they are 
that s right 
i suppose when you have a history of
screwing the jews out of their money 
and collaborating
with the nazis 
it s like the pot calling
the kettle black  eh 
i suppose it is  getting full use out
of your library card there  brendan 
library s been shut down 
did you not hear  cutbacks 
you re not dancing  milo 
i don t like this music 
what music do you like 
dolly parton 
dolly parton s good  yeah 
great cocaine 
very moreish 
totally medicinal  father 
how was your man  joyce 
it s been a tough day 
let s put it that way 
how can you hope to connect
with someone like that 
what are you talking about 
not freddy joyce 
i visited him in prison today 
why 
a prisoner deserves spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else  maybe more so 
is that right  so
they can find god 
and then say god has absolved
them of all their sins 
and what they did didn t really matter
anyways   cause now they re saved 
something like that  yeah 
calm down  you don t know
what you re talking about 
do you mind the drinks 
for christ s sake 
he had that coming a long time 
you know yourself 
fine looking man 
watch yourself with him 
i gave up cocaine
a long time ago 
you took cocaine 
come on  let s dance 
  no  no 
  how d they call it in your day  jive 
  no  no 
  come on 
forgive me  father 
for i have sinned 
say one our father
and ten hail mary s 
i ve sinned more than that 
make an ascent to croagh patrick  then 
on your knees 
on my knees  is it 
what made you say that 
  your church is on fire 
  fuck off brendan  i m not in the mood 
you re church is on fire 
jesus christ 
i called the fire
brigade  father 
for all the good it ll do 
they ll never get here in time 
  why didn t anybody see 
  daddy  stay away 
daddy  come away 
why didn t anybody see 
they re probably going
to blame you for this 
professional job  i d
say that for them 
any fool can start a
fire  for fuck s sake 
who d do a thing like this 
somebody with a grudge against
the church  obviously 
that could be half the country 
unless it s a personal angle 
  how d you mean    nobody had a
grudge against your father  no 
who d have a grudge against you 
maybe this is the future  huh 
maybe it ll all
be ruins one day 
maybe one day kids will say in
amazement  they used to believe in what 
and all that up in the sky 
and if we re good we ll go to heaven 
and if we re bad we ll go to hell 
you know  for a policeman you seem to
know very little about human nature 
maybe you re right  you
know more than me 
don t touch anything now 
have to get the forensics boys down 
the supercilious pricks 
what do we do now 
we ll have to rebuild
it  i suppose 
maybe use bricks next time 
might be a good idea 
oh  god  father 
is this about the coke  i
can take it or leave it 
really 
yeah  most people can 
the only ones who can t have
problems to begin with 
we shouldn t write them off  though  the
ones who have problems to begin with 
what do you want to do
with your life  veronica 
nothing 
consider the lilies of the
field  how they grow 
they toil not  neither
do they spin 
very nice quotation 
sure  everybody knows that one 
hackneyed  yeah 
it s like  turn the other cheek  
or  judge not lest you be judged  
i d like to be an
actress  maybe 
i ve an absent father
and domineering mother 
that s a start 
when did your dad leave 
he didn t leave  he was killed 
  murdered 
  hunting accident 
completely random 
so there s no use persevering  father 
i m a lost cause 
no one is a lost
cause  veronica 
who is it 
i don t know who it is 
you said you did 
i ve no evidence
it s the same man 
it s the same man  takes a lot
of nerve to burn down a church 
helps if you have a burning sense of
grievance  if you ll pardon the   
we have to ask ourselves 
what does this man want 
he wants to be loved  of course 
we all want to be loved 
failing that he wants to be   
admired 
failing that he
wants to be feared 
failing that  he wants to
be hated and despised 
you should beware the man who
wants to be hated and despised 
don t you think 
i think you read that in
a book  your excellency 
i think he wants to stir up some sort
of feelings in others  that s true 
doesn t want to be
ignored any more 
wants to make contact 
he made contact all right 
who is it 
dreadful business  i must say 
some little blackguard running
riot  i wouldn t wonder 
what can you do in
this day and age 
true that 
sorry about the
other day  father 
that was the drink talking 
what can we do for you 
it s off the bat with what i was saying 
and it seems more necessary than ever 
i d like to make a donation 
that would be grand 
to salve your conscience 
surely that s in the nature of all
philanthropy  the expiation of guilt 
i m sure you ve nothing major to
feel guilty about  mr  fitzgerald 
you d be surprised  father 
call me michael 
michael it is  any charity is
always gratefully received 
i know 
i believe that s
church doctrine 
the church needs all the help it can get 
especially these days 
why would you say that 
well  with all the compensation that s
been paid out over the last few years 
and that s only the yanks  we
all know they weren t worst 
i don t know about that  most of
those cases were 40 or 50 years ago 
raking up old ground it
always seemed to me 
  time to forgive and forget 
  i agree  i agree 
what s past is past 
time to move on 
etcetera  etcetera 
would you like a cup of tea  michael 
or maybe something stronger 
do you have any crystal meth 
no  no  i can t stop 
so what are we talking about 
ten  twenty 
twenty thousand 
twenty thousand euros  yeah 
well  that would be grand 
that would help us getting the initial
building work off the ground 
twenty it is  then 
this is a david oscarson pen 
it s really expensive 
it s lovely 
why not make it fifty 
well  father 
if money is no object 
make it fifty 
why not make it a hundred 
it means nothing to me 
i know it doesn t 
100 000 euros for your pet project  father 
what do you say to that 
i say  thank you  mr 
fitzgerald 
what was stanton getting on 
if i could tell you  i would 
you know that 
i thought i was the one that was
supposed to be in trouble  not you 
how s the fish  
too many little bones 
isn t that always the way 
not stopping 
meeting a fellow 
you re informing me of
your adultery in advance 
isn t that more honest
than in the confessional 
when it s all done and dusted  and
there s nothing you can do about it 
what are you
expecting him to do 
stop me from committing
a mortal sin 
you have to stop yourself 
i can t stop you 
then what good are you at all 
there s my ride  as it were 
let s do this again  sometime 
do you have to put up with that
kind of shit on a regular basis 
there s a lot of it going
around  let s put it that way 
we really should talk  you know 
let it all out 
like in one of those
shit plays at the abbey 
i don t know what the
revelation would be  though 
neither do i 
your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us  i know that 
it was a long goodbye 
if ever there was one 
sometimes i wish she hadn t
hanged on as long as she did 
she was stubborn all right 
brave too  though 
wonder if i ll be as brave
when the time comes 
it wasn t just her dying 
you were missing in action a long time 
before and after 
when i needed you most 
i was never neglectful 
i don t think 
never hit you or anything 
there are other
forms of violence 
i know there are  attempting
suicide  for one 
jesus  i walked into that one 
it s not only violence
against yourself  either 
it wasn t intended that way 
i never meant to hurt you 
how could it not hurt me 
i love you 
i love you too 
don t ever doubt that 
dad   
and just when i thought
i had you back 
and you were ship shape and
rearing to go  go you did 
i thought it would
be another woman 
i have a vocation  i
wasn t trying to escape 
i know that  i know
you re sincere 
but  dad  the fact remains 
first mum went away  and
then you went away 
i lost two parents for
the price of one 
i never ran anywhere 
i stayed here 
i think you re being a
bit naive there  father 
i m still here 
i ll always be here 
will you 
you promise 
i ll always be here 
and you ll always be here 
how was that for a
third act revelation 
corny 
but i like it 
here 
here s mud in your eye 
great stuff 
you know i can tell when
you re really getting old 
how 
no one ever says the word
 death  around you anymore 
bruno  bruno 
oh bruno 
what has he done to bruno 
oh  i forgot to say
goodbye to bruno 
  i ll give him a big kiss on you 
  oh  do 
  i ll be fine from here 
  will you 
well let s just say
today i m fine 
so you say 
hello  where are you off to 
the beach 
  it s nice at the beach  isn t it 
  yeah 
you surf 
no  my dad won t let me 
says it s too dangerous 
what does he know  the meany 
you re here on holidays 
  where are you from  wicklow 
  yeah 
never mind  i won t
hold it against you 
jeanine  get in the car 
what were you saying to her 
  i wasn t saying anything to her 
  oh  really 
it looked like a fucking
conversation to me 
where the hell did
you get to  honey 
i ve been looking
all over for you 
large one 
you sure about that 
whiskey  i said 
who burnt down your church  father 
if you don t mind me asking 
it s not my church 
it s our church 
i d say it was the romanians 
they re awful heathens 
the romanians 
what romanians do we
have around here 
they re always hanging around  romanians 
getting up to no good 
must be someone who
doesn t like you  father 
i think it must be one of the
good people in this town 
you should join the garda  simon 
with your  powers of deduction  
these measures  huh  father  like a
buttercup in the mouth of a cow 
pint there  please  brendan 
so you re sure there s a
god then  father  yeah 
i m not kidding 
i m being serious  i m asking
because i m having doubts myself 
i m having a crisis of faith 
don t be getting offended 
fa    i m sorry  really i am 
as sure as a hole in the ground   
don t be going away mad 
i m an awful messer 
hey  father  what do you hear 
what do you say 
you re back  so 
i ve got a lot of clients in this town 
from the hoi polloi to the masses 
i ve got to keep my ass
lubricated at all times 
hoi polloi are the masses of society 
you re using the phrase incorrectly 
you know that maybe so  father 
i didn t get no education  see 
i was getting fucked in the ass
and fucked in the face all day 
wasn t no time for any of that 
i was sucking the prick of a bishop
on a regular basis  you get me 
how did you like that
play  smart ass 
you need help 
you re starting to
sound a little screwy 
maybe you need to see a
head shrinker yourself 
do you need help  are you ok 
hey  father   
there s nothing wrong with me  father 
all right 
i m feeling fine 
you know   
when i first started out working up in
dublin  there was this 3 year old boy 
parents brought him into the hospital 
a routine operation 
but the anesthetist
made a mistake 
little boy ended up
deaf  dumb  blind   
and paralyzed  for good 
think of it 
think when that little boy
first regained consciousness 
in the dark  you d be
frightened  wouldn t you 
you d be frightened in the kind of a way
that you know the fear is going to end 
has to 
must  your parents
couldn t be too far away 
they ll come to your rescue 
they ll turn the light on 
they ll talk to you 
but    think of it 
nobody comes to rescue you 
no light is turned on 
you are in the dark 
you try to speak   
but you can t 
you try to move   
but you can t 
you try to cry out  but you are
unable to hear your own screams 
you are entombed
within your own body 
howling with terror 
what the fuck 
why the fuck would you
tell me a story like that 
no reason 
some people are awfully touchy 
good luck 
time to go  come on 
you re still drinking 
same again 
time to go  i said 
is that an order 
you don t like taking
orders  father 
you do not mind giving them 
these kinds are all alike 
  my  kind  
  yeah  your  kind  
your time is gone and you don t
even fucking realize it 
my time will never be gone 
did you hear that  the
arrogance of the man 
you need to be a
little more humble 
needs to be taken down a peg or two 
that s what he needs 
take me down  then 
go on  i fucking dare you 
jesus christ 
  what happened to you 
  brendan lynch 
brendan lynch  he s a buddhist 
so what if he s a fucking buddhist  you
think buddhists don t beat people up 
you think buddhists don t fuck
their kids like everyone else 
you re obviously very upset 
tibetans spit on blind people in the
street  their killing albinos in africa 
you re so fucking naive 
please don t curse
at me  father 
i think it would be best to continue
this conversation in the morning  sober 
why are you a fucking
priest at all 
you should be a fucking accountant 
or a fucking insurance man 
terrible 
let s go home 
what is it 
nothing 
you re leaving 
i think it s for the best 
because of last night 
because of a lot of things 
not just last night  or
what s happened here 
i ve been having doubts 
if you must know 
listen  i m sorry about
what i said last night 
you said what you said with such venom  i
didn t realize you hated me that much 
i don t hate you at all 
then  why 
it s just you have no integrity 
that s the worse i can
say about anybody 
well  that s   
  that s just   
  hope you find what you re looking for 
good luck 
father 
hello 
you re going to dublin 
yeah 
just getting away for
a while  you know 
i heard about your church 
terrible thing 
yes 
you must be very upset 
yes  i am 
i m bringing him home 
to his family in italy 
dublin and then    rome 
how have you been 
people here have been
very kind to me 
i mean   
you know  sometimes i
think i cannot go on 
but   
i will go on 
father 
little early for mass 
dr  hart was out fishing at the crack of
dawn  he begrudgingly gave me a ride 
where are you headed 
just down the beach there 
  can i come along 
  not really  no  maybe later 
that s fine  yeah 
i won t keep you 
did you finish your book 
yes  i did  i don t
know how good it is 
i m sure it ll be extraordinary 
you re a very fine writer 
thank you  james 
you know you changed the subject the
other day when we were talking 
what was the subject 
you know what the subject was  i think
you committed a sin of omission 
i m sure there are worse
sins than sins of omission 
i ll let you be the expert
in that department  father 
i think there s too much talk
about sins  to be honest 
not enough talk about virtues 
you might be right 
what would be your number one 
i think forgiveness has
been highly underrated 
i forgive you 
do you forgive me 
always 
thinking of throwing yourself in 
they say that s the easy way out 
nothing easy about it  i
wouldn t have thought 
i m in a bad way  father 
no  i m not putting you on 
the truth is i ve been
in a bad way for   
a long time 
no will to do anything 
feeling of nothing
being worthwhile   
a sense of disassociation 
detachment 
i had a wife and kids 
they meant nothing to me 
i have money  it
means nothing to me 
i have life   
and it means nothing to me 
where do you think it comes from 
the sense of detachment 
from nowhere 
from nowhere 
listen  i have to
meet someone now 
i ll call on you after 
we ll talk 
get you back on track  ok 
  ok 
  thank you 
thank you  father 
thank you 
  you all right 
  yeah 
take your hands out of your pockets 
slowly 
why 
i heard you had a gun 
i have to say i m surprised  thought
i d have to go looking for you 
just  cause i m here doesn t mean
you have to go through with it 
yes it does 
it s one of those cell
phone selling properties 
did you ever think it would
come to this  though  huh 
i was hoping it wouldn t  i thought
you were a friend of mine 
your friend is just an enemy
you haven t made yet 
  cheap cynicism 
  not cheap  now  no 
it s a cynicism
that s been hard won 
it s a cynicism
that s been earned   
over a hell of a lot of physical
and psychological torture 
i take it back then  but
it s cynicism none the less 
maybe that s the
difference between us 
oh  that s not the
only difference 
any regrets 
oh  yeah  never got to
finish  moby dick  
  the whale kills ahab 
  is that right 
then he destroys the rest of the
ship and the crew along with it 
all except for ishmael 
he alone escapes  to tell thee 
the burning of the
church i can understand 
you didn t have to kill my dog 
i didn t kill your dog  i love dogs 
why would i do a thing like that 
i found him with his throat cut 
why would i fucking kill a dog 
i didn t   
that had nothing to do with me 
i m wholly innocent
of that crime 
i did give veronica a bit of a
shove that one time  though 
i do admit that and
i m sorry for it 
did it upset you  the dog 
yes  it did 
did you cry 
yes  i did 
that s nice 
and when you read what your fellow
priests did to all those poor children 
all those years 
did you cry then 
i asked you a question 
did you cry then 
no 
that s right 
  i suppose   
  what 
  i suppose i felt attachment 
  yeah 
  when you read   
  yeah  yeah 
something in a newspaper   
detach yourself from that 
we were the lucky ones 
there s bodies burning back there 
burning like dogs 
don t look at me 
turn your face away 
don t look at me 
no  run  mícheál  run 
i ll get stanton  father 
he reminds me of me
