i m jim mckay speaking to you live   
at this moment  from abc headquarters   
just outside the olympic village
in munich  west germany 
the peace of what have been
called the  serene olympics    
was shattered just before dawn
this morning  about 5 00 
reporter   on tv  there is great
uncertainty about how many israelis   
are being held hostage in the apartment 
it now appears that black september
has tossed a piece of paper   
out the window  a list of demands 
they want what they call
 the israeli war machine    
to release 200 arabs 
which it insists are political prisoners   
or the hostages will be killed 
the terrorist communiqué
ends with an appeal   
for revolutionaries
of the world to unite 
mckay   on tv  this is building
number 31  at this moment   
eight or nine terrified
living human beings   
are being held prisoner 
the demands have been many   
there s someone right now 
this certainly has to be
one of the guerrillas 
a man with a stocking mask
on his face  weird 
what s going on inside
that head and that mind 
jennings 
just a short while ago  there was   
another in this long series
of negotiations 
the spokesman for the group
came out  spoke  went back 
it seems to be a process
of speak and consultation 
mckay  does it mean it s all right 
or does it mean it s all over 
come and get us 
as peter jennings indicated 
the german army   
because of very complicated laws   
would not be allowed to participate 
and there you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag   
in which is obviously a machine gun 
peter jennings 
once again  is stationed   
inside the olympic village 
with the naked eye  peter   
what do you see now 
jim  there are now a great many   
maybe a dozen already 
of those security men   
in athletic uniforms 
 speaking arabic 
stop 
reporter   on tv  it now appears that
the siege of the apartment building   
where the hostages are being
held has been called off   
and the german police are
retreating from the area 
officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans   
when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building   
and demanded they call off the siege
pointing out that the entire operation   
was being watched on a television set
within the apartment 
apparently  new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen   
and their hostages 
though it isn t yet known   
when or where this might occur 
this is peter  do you have something
to report to us from where you are 
this is cosell  i certainly do  peter 
we have an immense
flurry of action here 
suddenly  in the whole area between
building 20 and building 12   
they have been clearing out cars 
obviously wary of an assault
from the german police   
 reporters speaking
in different languages 
cosell  within five minutes 
reporter 
what i m hearing from here is that   
they re heading to an airport
called fürstenfeldbruck 
reporter 
   says the chopper just landed   
at the back of the olympic village here 
can you see gate number seven 
this is vance kolvig 
what i have seen are   
four hostages in one helicopter   
and it looks like five hostages
in the first helicopter 
yes  i just got back
a little while ago   
and it was obvious that something   
quite serious was going on out there 
reporter  here we are  outside the gates 
there are armored cars   
police cars   
 speaking arabic 
police are pouring in through
the gates with lights flashing   
and here come some more 
five  six  here comes another one 
seven armored cars have gone
in through the gates now 
they re mounting a major invasion 
the latest word we get
from the airport is that   
quote   all hell has
broken loose out there  
 speaking german 
 explosion 
it s just arrived  peter 
the bus has arrived   
  to the helicopters 
  we have reports now   
that all the hostages 
all nine hostages are safe 
we repeat  we have confirmed 
it s just past 1 00 a m 
the fighting ceased at midnight 
well  that s at least 24
we ve seen go in   
and now we can see
the lights flashing   
there was a terrible battle at
the airport  but the hostages   
somehow the hostages are safe 
and  according to these reports 
all arab terrorists   
have died by german gunfire 
originally it was said that
the hostages were safe   
but now that has been changed 
an olympic spokesman said that   
cioffi  of the areas in the world 
this is one of the areas   
 speaking hebrew 
they ve spent their youth 
their young people   
they ve spent all their money on wars 
now they have a chance to build
their nations  these nations   
and  of course  they re compatible 
the arabs and the israelis   
are perfectly compatible
as far as i can tell 
and now  as you say 
peter  you re quite right 
they ve been jolted apart again 
as they were   
seeming to come just a little closer 
little hope 
we ve just gotten the final word 
when i was a kid   
my father used to say our greatest
hopes and our worst fears   
are seldom realized  our worst
fears have been realized tonight 
they ve now said that
there were 11 hostages 
two were killed in their rooms   
yesterday morning 
nine were killed at the airport tonight 
they re all gone 
reporter 
   before a quiet crowd of 80 000 
after the ceremony 
the surviving team   
saw the coffins of their
fallen comrades   
loaded onto an airplane to
bring them home together 
enormous crowds also gathered
on dizengoff street   
and in jerusalem on the plaza
in front of the knesset 
people are weeping 
tearing their clothes 
the funerals  which will be
held tomorrow in jerusalem   
are expected to draw tens
of thousands of mourners 
these are the names of the
members of the israeli team   
at the munich olympics 
who were held hostage   
beaten  and finally murdered
by arab terrorists

i tried not to think about you 
but i couldn t 
   a very private  terrible grief
in the days and years to come 
i have the world s most boring job 
what s going to happen to me 
well  they were just athletes 
they went to the olympics 
look what happened to them 
what now 
now we re going to have a baby 
eleven names 
give us the order  and we ll begin 
it s the same as eichmann 
we say to these butchers 
 you didn t want to share
this world with us   
 then we don t have to
share this world with you  
there s legitimacy for this 
am i correct 
ambushed and slaughtered again   
while the rest of the world is
playing games  olympic torches   
and brass bands
and dead jews in germany 
and the world couldn t care less 
we ve responded 
we sent 70 fighter jets 
a response no one heard 
air strikes on guerrilla training centers 
that s a response 
no one notices what happens
in the border camps 
sixty arabs dead  at least 
who knows how many wounded 
this is about fixing
the world s attention 
well  it s not just a publicity stunt 
let me remind you 
ali hassan salameh 
he invented black september 
he is the architect
of the munich murders 
these people 
they re sworn to destroy us 
forget peace for now 
we have to show them we re strong 
we have laws  we represent civilization 
some people say we can t
afford to be civilized 
i ve always resisted such people 
but i don t know
who these maniacs are   
and where they come from 
palestinians 
they re not recognizable 
you tell me what law
protects people like these 
today i m hearing with new ears 
every civilization finds it necessary   
to negotiate compromises
with its own values 
i ve made a decision 
the responsibility is entirely mine 
  avner 
  yes 
we re going to jerusalem  get in 
come on  sir 
hello  i m general zamir 
yes 
you swore us in 
my unit  when i joined mossad 
i don t remember you 
of course  i know your father 
avner 
  it s been   
  two years since i worked for you 
i remember  please  sit down 
harari 
general nadav 
and general yariv 
how are you  how is your father 
he s fine  thank you 
coffee  it s wonderful to see you again 
sit 
the chief of the mossad  two generals   
and the prime minister 
obviously  it s important 
this is something new 
what happened in munich
changes everything 
we want to ask you 
will you undertake a mission 
an important mission 
you will have to leave the country   
and your family  maybe for years 
  and it is dangerous 
  you can t talk about it to anyone 
not even your wife 
now you should say something 
do you have any questions 
so  this isn t about guarding
tourists on el al jets 
no questions 
did we mention how dangerous it is 
you know  my sister died on tuesday 
  no  i didn t know that 
  cancer 
i couldn t go to
the athletes  funerals   
because she died 
that upset people 
but she was my sister 
family matters 
  your wife is pregnant 
  yes  seven months 
mazel tov 
you were one of my favorite bodyguards 
you know  i like neat  durable men 
you liked having the son
of a hero around 
truth be told 
you don t look much like your father 
no 
your mother is who you resemble 
tomorrow morning 
if you can t decide in one day   
you can t decide 
her sister died 
but i think she didn t go
to the athletes  funerals   
because some people are angry at her   
for not negotiating with the terrorists 
she didn t go to the funerals   
because she didn t want to be booed 
it s a good sign
you didn t ask questions 
you ll say yes 
i m your case officer 
my name is ephraim 
 panting 
how late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex 
labor 
don t worry about it 
you won t be around

whatever they want 
make sure they give you a raise 
i need things for the baby 
i can t live with refusing this 
your mother 
she knew what she was doing 
  she abandoned you on that kibbutz 
  she didn t abandon me 
my father was missing 
he was in prison  she was overwhelmed 
  oh  yes 
  she did what anybody would do 
yeah  so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you 
now you think israel is your mother 
so listen 
i m going to go along with this 
until i don t 
  do you understand me 
  i love you 
i m not the hero s nice wife 
first you resign from mossad 
your new contract 
it says we do not employ you 
offer you benefits  or pensions   
or legal aid or medical assistance

i want receipts 
you are not working for
the baron rothschild 
you re working for israel 
a small country 
i m an old galicianer from
a mud hut in the ukraine 
and i don t trust yekke
putzes let loose in europe   
with unlimited operational expenses 
i was born in israel  i m not a yekke 
  where is your grandpa from 
  frankfurt 
you re a yekke 
your wife receives monthly
 1 000 in her bank account 
also  we leave messages in the

  but there shouldn t be messages 
  i don t care about that 
  bring me receipts  you got me 
  i got you 
whatever you are doing 
somebody else is paying for it 
we have 11 palestinian names

11 men  one by one 
they re all in europe now 
you ll stay there as long as it takes 
europe only  not the arab countries 
that s for us  not you

don t upset the russians 
who needs it 
you ll have no contact with us 
you re not going to

we deposit money from a
fund that doesn t exist

cleanup to make sure you don t   
accidentally drop your fake passport   
next to the dead body 
you re the team leader 
  who kills the targets 
  you do  who else

but the bombs are preferable 
one of your guys knows how to make them 
we want everyone to read in le monde
some famous arab terrorist is dead 
who knows who blew him up 
  why me 
  so what s wrong with you 
i m not an experienced field operative 
  so i m not known

you won t shoot spanish bellhops 
no bellhops  no civilians 
that kind of trouble we can t afford 
the hard thing will not be finding them 
some of them  anyway 
are not so carefully hidden 
the hard thing will be not
punishing yourselves   
by getting caught or getting killed 
  you want the last piece of baklava 
  no 
smart decision  you should avoid sweets 
after all  you just signed away
your dental insurance 
 on pa  this is pierre bouchet

reporter   on tv  initially it was
the intention of the hijackers   
to bring the lufthansa to
munich international airport   
and then take onboard
the three prisoners   
at the end of the runway 
where captain klausen took his plane   
while an arab held a
hand grenade at his head 
hey  avner 
a lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from damascus 
the hijackers demanded
the release of three killers   
who survived munich   
and the germans said yes  instantly 
the arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to zagreb 
look  they re free now 
they re in libya 
no qualms about rejoicing
on their side  eh 
the israeli kills the arabs   
in egypt  in jordan 
in lebanon  in syria   
look at them 
they re movie stars 
but did you shoot any
of the israeli hostages 
it s not important to say
if i killed israelis or not 
we should go to tripoli 
kill them 
we don t go to arab countries 
we stick to the names we ve been given 
mahmoud hamshari 
do you think  looking back on it now   
that you achieved anything
in the munich operation 
we have made
our voice heard by the world 
are those your words 
the same thing again 
they have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world   
who has not been hearing before 
well  i believe
what he meant by this is   
that now the world
will begin hearing us 
we are  for 24 years 
the world s largest refugee population 
our homes taken from us 
living in camps  no future  no food 
nothing decent for our children 
and  so was the attack
in munich justified 
the plo condemns attacks on civilians 
  though for 24 years   
  tell your newspaper that 
   our civilians have been attacked
by the israelis day after day   
tell them about all the years
and years of palestinian blood   
spilled by israel 
and who mourns for us 
you know  israel just bombed   
two refugee camps in syria and lebanon 
  tell them that   
  200 people killed 
  right after munich they did this 
  it did not begin in munich 
and where does it end 
how will it ever end 
 speaking french

to eliminate target number two 
yeah  if he s been eliminated 
we should stick with guns 
no one notices a shooting 
bombs achieve a double objective 
they eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists 
that only works when the bombs work 
lunch 
reporter  the israeli embassy in
london was rocked by a letter bomb   
shortly after 9 30 this morning 
dr  ami shachori was
opening his morning mail   
when the envelope exploded 
killing him instantly 
they discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in earls court 
  i guess they missed one 
  right after hanukkah 
i guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless 
they found other letters
in israel  of course 
canada  argentina  vienna 
kinshasa  paris  brussels 
dozens of them 
mainly posted in the netherlands 
it s all black september 
it s a response  then 
to hamshari 
and to zwaiter 
they re talking to us 
we re in dialogue now 
where are you 
i m in new york  following a lead 
i ll call again

it isn t fast 
we have the best hospitals in the world 
when you were born  your father
was elsewhere  i was alone 
he was in prison 
should you be here 
aren t you on duty 
what are you going to do  turn me in 
how is he 
i don t visit your father so much 
wilma lets him yell at her all the time 
she depresses me

i m managing  don t worry about me 
i m proud of what you are doing 
you don t know what i m doing 
i look at you and i know
everything i need to know 
avner  she is frighteningly ugly 
she takes after you 
i want you to move  for a time 
i ve arranged a place
for us in brooklyn 
i can t come back to israel 
i don t know how long for   
new york 
  i can see more of you this way 
  new york city 
 knocking at door 
but i have my family here 
and your parents 
you want my parents to help raise her 
look what they did to me 
don t you want your daughter
to be an israeli  avner 
she ll always be an israeli 
not in brooklyn 
she ll just be another homeless jew 
i can t do what
i m doing if i can t see you 
what are you doing 
don t do it then  avner 
this is our home 
you re the only home i ever had 
what 
this is so corny 
  it wasn t easy for me to say that 
  i bet 
don t laugh at me then 
why did i have to marry
a sentimentalist 
you re ruining my life 
your mother s teasing me 
look at the waistline bulge on that guy 
look at that 
think he might be armed  eh 
as are the russians 
it s definitely him 
hussein abad al chir 
his room is next to israeli newlyweds 
they married in cyprus
because she s not jewish 
a mixed marriage 
a shande for the goyim 
yeah  okay 
but let s try not to blow them up 
the kgb brings him home
every night after dark 
he turns on the light  gets undressed   
turns off the light 
gets into bed  we blow up the bed 
i knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed 
so every night he slept
on the floor of his closet 
he still does  every night 
sleeps in closets 
now if al chir sleeps in his closet 
we re in trouble 
but if he gets in the bed 
his weight arms the device   
it closes the circuit 
then we hit the remote 
okay 
okay  we re good  we re good  let s go 
careful 
 knocking at door 
i ve checked into the room next door 
  why 
  there are balconies 
when he gets into bed   
i give the signal by
switching off the light 
and if the bomb s too powerful
and you re in the next room 
well  that won t happen 
right

  can you see 
  yes 
  the stairs are that way 
  okay 
  go that way 
  come on  let s go 
  it was much too powerful 
  stop it 
  you could ve blown up innocent   
  target number three 
target number three was not in doubt 
the ceiling in the lobby cracked 
you nearly demolished   
avner might have been killed 
the plastique was not what i asked for 
it couldn t have been
the grade i specified 
someone changed the
marking on the explosive 
what if someone changed the marking 
  what do you mean 
  louis provided the plastique 
avner  louis provided the explosives 
  yes  why 
  why are we trusting him 
we have no idea who he is 
  he s finding our targets 
  yes  but   
but without him 
we d be nowhere on this 
the plastique was much more
powerful than what i asked for 
someone changed the label 
i could have killed you 
for all we know 
louis works for the plo 
they re using us to do
internal housecleaning 
that s bullshit 
hey  whose fishing boat is this 
louis arranged it 
there was nothing wrong
with the explosive 
bomb makers are nervous 
which is understandable 
fear makes them sloppy   
there s nothing wrong
with my bomb maker 
it s your explosives 
we found three more names for you 
  three 
  yes  three 
  thought you d be pleased 
  i am 
who 
kemal adwan  kamal nasser 
and abu youssef 
adwan and abu youssef 
  where 
  lebanon 
they re in beirut 
adwan  nasser  youssef 
serious characters  huh 
extremely serious 
smile  mr  storsch 
it s a second christmas 
i d like to pay you
a little extra for this 
these three names 
 600 000 
monsieur storsch  my group   
we don t care much for governments   
any governments 
we don t work with or for them 
that s an absolute condition
of my theory 
you understand 
if i learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt   
to buy our acquiescence in
your sharing my information   
with  let us say 
cia or mi6 or mossad   
  i don t work for mi6 or cia   
  you have no idea who you work for 
trust me  you don t 
lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable   
and unhappy 
  let me buy you a drink 
  no  you save your money 
at these prices 
you re going to need it 
ephraim 
it s obviously significant information 
abu youssef is like number three
in the whole palestinian network 
it s like arafat  habash  and then him 
of course he s significant 
thanks for the instruction   
  and enthusiasm 
  he s the brains of the fedayeen 
  i know who he is 
  next to salameh   
abu youssef is the worst
guy we re after  right 
and adwan  he plans all the
actions in the west bank  right 
we get the significance 
these are serious targets 
  we want to go to beirut 
  no 
you keep away from the arab countries 
mossad and the army
will take care of it 
what is this contraption 
you can t send the army 
we won t allow it 
you won t allow it 
our source doesn t know we re mossad 
you aren t mossad 
if commandos go to beirut 
our source will cut us off 
why don t you and i go for a
walk and talk about this  alone 
the food will get cold 
  we have to go to beirut 
  we re good at this 
this is our information 
this is our job 
that s touching in a
juvenile sort of way 
listen  you re doing reasonably well 
  reasonably 
  you re spending a lot of money 
well  we expected that 
lots of people in mossad
don t know about you 
no one knows 
so everyone s asking 
 who s killing the fedayeen 
 is it our guys  why weren t we told  
big egos  lots of screaming 
i can maybe include one or two of you   
but excluding mossad
or the army is impossible 
accept it 
we will  but our source won t 
who is your source 
it s time you told me 
that  by the way 
is not a request  it s an order 
you can t order him 
he doesn t work for you 
shut up  i pay you  you work for me 
i work for a metal box in a bank in geneva 
the box pays me 
  you want to find it empty 
  i want you to let us do our work 
what s the matter with you 
with all of you 
grow up and do it quick 
this is not a game  a fucking game 
who has the source 
where are you getting your information 
give me his goddamn number 
i hope the old lady
next door enjoyed that 
she s a little deaf but i doubt
she had any trouble hearing you 
give me the source
and we ll let you take part 
let us go to beirut 
after beirut  we ll use our source
to find the remaining targets 
let us do our job

  papa 
my papa  he runs our little group 
i thought you ran the group 
everybody works for someone 
i wasn t in beirut 
well  someone was there 
the israeli army  according to
every newspaper on earth 
but you stayed away   
after you paid so extravagantly
for the information 
i don t like to keep my papa waiting 
i need to tell my people
where i m going 
you don t know where you re going 
and you ll need to wear this 
forget it  louis  that s just crazy 
we re done here 
shit 
wait

we re here 
 children speaking french

papa 
he s over there 
louis says you re a cook 
i know how to cook  yeah 
you help me 
bring these there 
no  no  don t wash  no  no 
they will taste like boiled sponge 
but then why put them in the sink 
if the juices spurt out 
it s a big mess 
the whole kitchen will smell like piss 
peel off the fat 
let me see your hands 
too big for a good cook 
that was my problem  too 
i had been a master   
but i have thick  stupid 
butcher s hands just like yours 
well  we are tragic men 
butcher s hands  gentle souls 
these are going to be too sour to eat 
skin them and prick them 
boil them in sugar 
a little torture 
and you ll see how nice they are 
  you call me  papa  
  i can t do that 
  no 
  i have a papa already 
you are devoted to him 
am i here because of
what happened in beirut 
your papa must be proud of his son 
we ll pick a few  let the rest ripen 
there are so many people to feed  but   
but they are your family 
so you have to feed them 
yes  we don t work with governments 
louis said  but   
but you did what you did because
you have to feed your family 
papa  i blew up trains  bridges   
and trucks full of germans
during the war 
my brothers were killed 
my papa and my sister were both hanged 
she was a young girl 
papa  the guest doesn t want
to hear your war stories 
we paid this price 
so vichy scum could be replaced   
by gaullist scum   
and the nazis could be
replaced by stalin and america 
we stay away from governments 
we say grace 
maybe our guest could lead us 
no  no  no  it s not required 
 speaking french 
our father  who gives us obedient
and respectful clients   
who obey the rules according to
which our business thrives   
   whose prevarications
and deceptions   
in my despair i fathered madmen   
who dress like factory workers 
but never do manual labor   
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit   
about algerians and who love nothing   
not algerians or french   
or flesh and blood  or anything living 
so i have sympathy for a man
who can say   i have a papa    
and who does
what he must for his family 
 speaking french 
i will say grace 
there s some opinion you
should be punished   
for what happened in beirut 
we didn t know so many would die 
i m in business with death 
do you think i m squeamish 
the world has been rough
with you  with your tribe 
it s right to respond
roughly to such treatment 
you pay well and you pay promptly 
so we ll continue together 
  but no more infractions 
  thank you  you have my word 
a few andouillettes and boudins noirs   
black blood sausage and a
loire cheese  selles sur cher 
  we cover it in ash to preserve it 
  thank you 
you could have been my son 
but you re not  remember that 
we ll do business 
but you aren t family 
 car engine starting 
i have a new name for you 
i want ali hassan salameh 
no 
you know where he is 
you know where all the names are 
  salameh 
  untouchable 
salameh 
zaid muchassi 
zaid muchassi is in athens in two weeks 
  not one of our names 
  nevertheless 
he is black september s kgb contact 
hussein al chir was the kgb contact 
yes  but you put a bomb under
monsieur al chir s bed in cyprus   
and now he s defunct 
muchassi is his replacement 
i hear he s much tougher
than his predecessor 
we offer muchassi s
whereabouts at the new rate 
  what new rate 
  three names for  600 000   
is  200 000 for one name 
i need you to find me a
place to work in athens 
of course  safe house 
is this louis s idea of a joke 
i ve had nightmares
that looked like this 
so when they explode  they toss
little white balls of phosphorus   
here all around his room 
each ball  it s like a little sun 
it burns at around 5 000 degrees 
so the air catches fire 
everything in the vicinity melts 
now  the bad news is
they are grenades   
so i modified them to use
with a remote detonator 
i also should mention
that they re quite old   
like world war ii 
only four were viable 
we should dump the rest 
there s a porter at the hotel
where muchassi s staying 
he s gonna let us in the
room when muchassi goes out 
hey  who provided these
prehistoric explosives 
  louis 
  yeah  i ll thank him for that

 let s stay together by al green 
eventually the arab states
will rise against israel 
they don t like palestinians 
but they hate the jews more 
it won t be like 1967 
the rest of the world will see by
then what the israelis do to us 
they won t help when egypt
and syria attack  even jordan 
israel will cease to exist 
what 
this is a dream  you can t take back
a country you never had 
  you sound like a jew 
  fuck you 
i m the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know 
you people have nothing to bargain with 
you ll never get the land back 
you ll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for palestine 
we have a lot of children 
they ll have children 
so we can wait forever 
and if we need to  we can make
the whole planet unsafe for jews 
you kill jews and the world
feels bad for them   
  and thinks you are animals 
  yes 
but then the world will see how
they ve made us into animals 
they ll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages 
you are arabs 
there are lots of places for arabs 
you re a jew sympathizer 
all you germans 
you re too soft on israel 
well  you give us money 
but you feel guilty about hitler 
and the jews exploit that guilt 
my father didn t gas any jews 
  tell me something  ali 
  what 
do you really miss your
father s olive trees 
do you honestly think you have
to get back all that    that nothing 
that chalky soil and stone huts 
is that what you really
want for your children 
it absolutely is 
it will take a hundred years 
but we ll win 
how long did it take the jews
to get their own country 
how long did it take the germans
to make germany 
and look how well that worked out 
you don t know what it
is not to have a home 
that s why you european reds
don t get it 
you say   it s nothing  
but you have a home to come back to 
eta  anc  ira   
we all pretend we care about
your international revolution   
but we don t care 
we want to be nations 
home is everything 
  no  no  no

  wait  wait 
where s the explosion 
it should ve exploded by now 
  what s gone wrong 
  it s another malfunction 
you know what

  shut him up 
  did we kill a russian 
  that s not good 
  where did you get your training 
every single bomb 
every fucking one  is fucked up 
i was not trained to do this 
i was trained to dismantle bombs 
not to build them 
holy shit 
shin bet wanted bomb dismantlers 
they picked me from the army 
  a toy maker 
  give me some money 
they figured i was good
with small machines 
but then after munich  they asked
if i could build bombs instead 
so i said yes 
come on  here 
 cursing in greek 
reporter  the three went to
the side of the customs hall   
took out pieces of their rifles 
and quickly assembled them 
then they threw hand grenades into
the long queues of passengers   
waiting to clear passport control
and began automatic fire 
it was all over in a matter of minutes 
and the firing was indiscriminate 
salameh is in london 
he goes there periodically to
meet with his cia contact 
  his what 
  salameh works for the cia 
bullshit 
salameh guarantees
that black september   
won t touch american diplomats 
in exchange 
the cia gives him lots of money 
and they don t ask what he uses it for 
did he tell them
about munich in advance 
did the cia know about munich 
the cia didn t even know
black september existed   
before munich 
one of the guerrillas was
shot through the head   
by a ricochet bullet 
a second was blown up
by his own hand grenade 
louis  since then  he s been busy 
hasn t he 
all manner of costly exercises 
shooting tourists
in the athens airport   
blowing up pharmacies in amsterdam   
and that mossad agent
in barcelona before that 
europe hasn t been this interesting
since napoleon marched to moscow 
do you have to do that here 
salameh is in london 
for the usual price 
we followed him from
his doctor to his hotel 
  he s here for eye treatment 
  salameh  you saw him 
  you followed him 
  yes 
  wearing sunglasses in the rain 
  why didn t you shoot him 
there were bodyguards  civilians 
  were they armed 
  yes 
well then  they re not civilians 
i d have done it   
if you d give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone 
i m the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys 
maybe that s why we never let you do it 
  we only go after our targets 
  since when 
i mean  why are
we worried about that now 
do you have any idea how
many laws we ve broken 
it s time to stop your agonizing 
it s counterproductive 
including  incidentally 
the laws of the state of israel   
which has no death penalty 
you know what your problem is  habibi 
you re disorientated 
because the guys we re killing
are dressed in expensive suits   
and this is london
and not some ugly arab village 
i m not disoriented 
i m keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself   
that in spite of   
but it s the same
old war we re fighting   
i m still  at least in principle 
a human being 
   over the same old scrap of desert 
it s just we ve brought our war
to copenhagen and kensington   
and it s not like these european
anti semites don t deserve that 
unless we learn to act like them 
we will never defeat them 
we act like them all the time 
what  you think the palestinians
invented bloodshed 
how do you think we got control
of the land  by being nice 
somebody pull down this man s pants 
see if he s circumcised 
i think we have
a double agent in our midst 
  don t you dare accuse me of that 
  stop it 
my son died in  67 
you foul mouthed son of a bitch 
everything you can ask 
i ve done for israel 
ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful 
  why  it s not distasteful to you 
  no 
 cause the only blood that
matters to me is jewish blood 
nice job  eh  nice job leading 
if the bodyguards are armed 
we kill them 
  they re armed 
  well  then we kill them

now  maybe he isn t   
but they re using him
to feed us information 
there s no direct link 
or mossad s giving it to cia 
which is giving it to louis   
and ephraim s demanding
we give him louis   
because he knows we expect him to do   
stop chasing the mice inside your skull 
you know  i never thought you d last 
i thought the same about you 
from the beginning
you seemed so reluctant 
i was born reluctant  ask my mother 
if i can t kvetch  i can t do my job 
you ever feel reluctant 
i m not comfortable with confusion 
i knew guys like you in the army 
you ll do any terrifying
thing you re asked to do   
but you have to do it running 
you think you can outrun
your fears  your doubts 
the only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness 
but everyone s overtaken  eventually 
now  the mice need a brandy 
will you join me 
no  i m going to go upstairs 
straight to bed

just to tell our families 
just to say we are all right 
everybody  just relax  okay

we will ride this bus and fly away 
after  you go back to your home   
or to your olympic games 
 reporters chattering 
 police dogs barking 
 groaning 
 exclaiming 
 shouting 
 speaking hebrew 
 speaking arabic 
 gasping 
 sniffing 
carl  you asshole

carl 
 screaming 
she s dutch  not political 
entirely business minded 
she lives in hoorn  she s there now 
this is dependable information 
for which you pay nothing 
we re giving you this 
you understand why 
because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do   
with the murder of my partner 
we inhabit a world of
intersecting secrecies 
we live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet 
that s what we accept 
we buy information for you
from your enemies 
this alerts them 
you re not the only people
looking for names 
you re telling me i m being hunted now 
he s telling you it s time
for you to quit 
the race is not to the swift 
nor the battle to the strong   
but time and chance happens to them all 
evil falls suddenly 
who can say when it falls 
 announcements over pa in french 
so you re really gonna kill her 
  all this blood comes back to us 
  eventually it will work 
even if it takes years  we ll beat them 
we re jews  avner 
jews don t do wrong because
our enemies do wrong 
we can t afford to be
that decent anymore 
i don t know that we ever
were that decent 
suffering thousands of years of
hatred doesn t make you decent 
but we re supposed to be righteous 
that s a beautiful thing 
that s jewish 
that s what i knew 
that s what i was taught 
and now i m losing it 
and i lose that  that s   
  that s   
  that s everything 
that s my soul 
you need to go rest somewhere 
you don t have to do this one 
when i need you again  i ll find you 
 train whistle blaring 
 radio playing 
excuse me  who are you 
do you know why we re here 
i want to get dressed  okay 
maybe you want to hire me 
you know how good i am 
no  don t 
it s such a fucking waste of talent 
where re you going  stay here 
shell  shell 
yeah 
 gasping 
leave it 
hans  in seven months we ve
killed six of the 11 names 
we ve killed one replacement 
one of our targets
is in prison and four   
including ali hassan salameh 
are at large 
one of our own has fallen 
since we began  the other side has
sent letter bombs to 11 embassies   
hijacked three planes   
killed 130 passengers in athens
and wounded scores more   
and killed our military
attaché in washington 
some of it was done by a venezuelan
called carlos the jackal   
who replaced zaid muchassi   
who replaced hussein al chir 
black september s original
leadership has been decimated 
but new leaders are emerging   
for whom black september
wasn t violent enough 
and to dispatch our six
dispatched targets   
we must have spent something
close to  2 million  right 
you ve been cooking 
are you expecting company 
mrs  meir says to the knesset   
the world must see that killing jews   
will be from now on an
expensive proposition 
but killing palestinians
isn t exactly cheap 
  if all 11 were dead  you d stop 
  yes 
you re lying 
what about their replacements 
with each time we kill 
we create six more 
maybe they ll have to
keep killing them  then 
forever 
five targets are still alive 
that s five men that need to be killed 
eventually you forget that in
the beginning you hated doing it 
for me personally 
i feel less every day 
one day i m going to wake up 
i m going to kill   
i m going to go back to bed 
i m not going to feel anything at all 
hey  hans  you know there s a rule
in the book against blind drunks 
why don t you stop drinking
and eat something 
i mean  there s enough food
here to feed bangladesh 
i keep seeing that dutch woman 
you know  sprawled out like that 
it s not that i wish
we hadn t killed her 
i wish i had let you
close up her housecoat 
yeah  but you weren t yourself 
 whispering  avner 
avner 
avner

knife 
they didn t take anything 
 phone ringing 
what 
it will be beautiful 
louis  ali hassan salameh is
in tarifa on the spanish coast 
he s at a compound guarded
by all the predictable trouble 
bomb makers often die accidental deaths 
in athens you shot a kgb agent 
many people must want to kill you 
monsieur storsch 
but why would i do that 
you pay better than anyone 
it s dangerous going after salameh 
but he planned the munich massacre 
eliminate him  and they ll let you
go home  don t you think 
yes  louis  i do 
you could have a kitchen
like that someday 
it costs dearly  but home always does 
 festive voices 
shit  it s like a funhouse in there 
can you tell how many 
that s him 
are you sure it s him  avner 
you have to be sure 
 yelling in arabic

and killed her off the company clock

otherwise  as i said  we have no
problems with the job you did 
except three of my men died 
according to your colleague   
i should say  emphatically 
according to your colleague   
not in any way your fault 
he sings your praises 
best guy he ever worked for  and so on 
he says this french group   
louis was his name 
they sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts 
they helped kill your men 
i know steve believes that 
but it s not true 
tell us who they are 
they won t work with you 
  it s about loyalty 
  you re an israeli officer 
that s your only loyalty  that s it 
okay

he s israeli 
you think we d hurt your family 
i think anyone is capable of anything 
i think you re losing your mind 
did i commit murder 
i want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed   
had a hand in munich 
i don t discuss such things
with people who don t exist 
you want to discuss 
come back to existence 
you want your daughter
to grow up in exile 
i want evidence 
professor hamshari with
the beautiful wife and child 
he was implicated in a failed
assassination attempt on ben gurion 
he was recruiting for fatah france 
you stopped him 
we should have tried
to bring him to israel 
and zwaiter 
your harmless little writer in rome 
he was behind the bomb on
el al flight 76 in 1968 
he was working on
another bomb last august 
i could go on and on with this 
according to evidence nobody has seen 
if these people committed crimes 
we should have arrested them 
like eichmann 
if these guys live  israelis die 
whatever doubts you have 
avner  you know this is true 
you did well  but you re unhappy 
  i killed seven men 
  not salameh 
we ll get him  of course 
you think you were the only team 
it s a big operation 
you were only a part 
does that assuage your guilt 
did we accomplish anything at all 
every man we killed has
been replaced by worse 
why cut my fingernails 
they ll grow back 
did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership   
or the palestinian leadership 
you tell me what we ve done 
you killed them for the
sake of a country   
you now choose to abandon 
the country your mother and father built 
that you were born into 
you killed them for munich 
for the future  for peace 
there s no peace at the end of this 
no matter what you believe 
  you know this is true 
  here s what i know 
your father is sick 
your mother will be alone 
you re a sabra 
your wife and daughter are sabras 
what i came to say is this   
come home 
come to my house for dinner tonight 
come on 
you re a jew  you re a stranger
