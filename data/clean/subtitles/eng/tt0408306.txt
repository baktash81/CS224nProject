im jim mckay speaking to you live
at this moment from abc headquarters
just outside the olympic village
in munich west germany
the peace of what have been
called the serene olympics
was shattered just before dawn
this morning about 500
reporter on tv there is great
uncertainty about how many israelis
are being held hostage in the apartment
it now appears that black september
has tossed a piece of paper
out the window a list of demands
they want what they call
the israeli war machine
to release 200 arabs
which it insists are political prisoners
or the hostages will be killed
the terrorist communiqué
ends with an appeal
for revolutionaries
of the world to unite
mckay on tv this is building
number 31 at this moment
eight or nine terrified
living human beings
are being held prisoner
the demands have been many
theres someone right now
this certainly has to be
one of the guerrillas
a man with a stocking mask
on his face weird
whats going on inside
that head and that mind
jennings
just a short while ago there was
another in this long series
of negotiations
the spokesman for the group
came out spoke went back
it seems to be a process
of speak and consultation
mckay does it mean its all right
or does it mean its all over
come and get us
as peter jennings indicated
the german army
because of very complicated laws
would not be allowed to participate
and there you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag
in which is obviously a machine gun
peter jennings
once again is stationed
inside the olympic village
with the naked eye peter
what do you see now
jim there are now a great many
maybe a dozen already
of those security men
in athletic uniforms
speaking arabic
stop
reporter on tv it now appears that
the siege of the apartment building
where the hostages are being
held has been called off
and the german police are
retreating from the area
officials seem to have decided
to abandon their plans
when the leader of the fedayeen
came out of the building
and demanded they call off the siege
pointing out that the entire operation
was being watched on a television set
within the apartment
apparently new demands have
been made to move the fedayeen
and their hostages
though it isnt yet known
when or where this might occur
this is peter do you have something
to report to us from where you are
this is cosell i certainly do peter
we have an immense
flurry of action here
suddenly in the whole area between
building 20 and building 12
they have been clearing out cars
obviously wary of an assault
from the german police
reporters speaking
in different languages
cosell within five minutes
reporter
what im hearing from here is that
theyre heading to an airport
called fürstenfeldbruck
reporter
says the chopper just landed
at the back of the olympic village here
can you see gate number seven
this is vance kolvig
what i have seen are
four hostages in one helicopter
and it looks like five hostages
in the first helicopter
yes i just got back
a little while ago
and it was obvious that something
quite serious was going on out there
reporter here we are outside the gates
there are armored cars
police cars
speaking arabic
police are pouring in through
the gates with lights flashing
and here come some more
five six here comes another one
seven armored cars have gone
in through the gates now
theyre mounting a major invasion
the latest word we get
from the airport is that
quote all hell has
broken loose out there
speaking german
explosion
its just arrived peter
the bus has arrived
to the helicopters
we have reports now
that all the hostages
all nine hostages are safe
we repeat we have confirmed
its just past 100 am
the fighting ceased at midnight
well thats at least 24
weve seen go in
and now we can see
the lights flashing
there was a terrible battle at
the airport but the hostages
somehow the hostages are safe
and according to these reports
all arab terrorists
have died by german gunfire
originally it was said that
the hostages were safe
but now that has been changed
an olympic spokesman said that
cioffi of the areas in the world
this is one of the areas
speaking hebrew
theyve spent their youth
their young people
theyve spent all their money on wars
now they have a chance to build
their nations these nations
and of course theyre compatible
the arabs and the israelis
are perfectly compatible
as far as i can tell
and now as you say
peter youre quite right
theyve been jolted apart again
as they were
seeming to come just a little closer
little hope
weve just gotten the final word
when i was a kid
my father used to say our greatest
hopes and our worst fears
are seldom realized our worst
fears have been realized tonight
theyve now said that
there were 11 hostages
two were killed in their rooms
yesterday morning
nine were killed at the airport tonight
theyre all gone
reporter
before a quiet crowd of 80000
after the ceremony
the surviving team
saw the coffins of their
fallen comrades
loaded onto an airplane to
bring them home together
enormous crowds also gathered
on dizengoff street
and in jerusalem on the plaza
in front of the knesset
people are weeping
tearing their clothes
the funerals which will be
held tomorrow in jerusalem
are expected to draw tens
of thousands of mourners
these are the names of the
members of the israeli team
at the munich olympics
who were held hostage
beaten and finally murdered
by arab terrorists

but i couldnt
a very private terrible grief
in the days and years to come
i have the worlds most boring job
whats going to happen to me
well they were just athletes
they went to the olympics
look what happened to them
what now
now were going to have a baby
eleven names
give us the order and well begin
its the same as eichmann
we say to these butchers
you didnt want to share
this world with us
then we dont have to
share this world with you
theres legitimacy for this
am i correct
ambushed and slaughtered again
while the rest of the world is
playing games olympic torches
and brass bands
and dead jews in germany
and the world couldnt care less
weve responded
we sent 70 fighter jets
a response no one heard
air strikes on guerrilla training centers
thats a response
no one notices what happens
in the border camps
sixty arabs dead at least
who knows how many wounded
this is about fixing
the worlds attention
well its not just a publicity stunt
let me remind you
ali hassan salameh
he invented black september
he is the architect
of the munich murders
these people
theyre sworn to destroy us
forget peace for now
we have to show them were strong
we have laws we represent civilization
some people say we cant
afford to be civilized
ive always resisted such people
but i dont know
who these maniacs are
and where they come from
palestinians
theyre not recognizable
you tell me what law
protects people like these
today im hearing with new ears
every civilization finds it necessary
to negotiate compromises
with its own values
ive made a decision
the responsibility is entirely mine
avner
yes
were going to jerusalem get in
come on sir
hello im general zamir

you swore us in
my unit when i joined mossad

the chief of the mossad two generals
and the prime minister
obviously its important
this is something new
what happened in munich

we want to ask you
will you undertake a mission
an important mission
you will have to leave the country
and your family maybe for years
and it is dangerous
you cant talk about it to anyone
not even your wife
now you should say something
do you have any questions
so this isnt about guarding
tourists on el al jets
no questions
did we mention how dangerous it is
you know my sister died on tuesday
no i didnt know that
cancer
i couldnt go to
the athletes funerals
because she died
that upset people
but she was my sister
family matters
your wife is pregnant
yes seven months
mazel tov
you were one of my favorite bodyguards
you know i like neat durable men
you liked having the son
of a hero around
truth be told
you dont look much like your father
no
your mother is who you resemble
tomorrow morning
if you cant decide in one day
you cant decide
her sister died
but i think she didnt go
to the athletes funerals
because some people are angry at her
for not negotiating with the terrorists
she didnt go to the funerals
because she didnt want to be booed
its a good sign
you didnt ask questions
youll say yes
im your case officer
my name is ephraim
panting
how late in the pregnancy before
you have to stop having sex
labor
dont worry about it
you wont be around
will you
whatever they want

i need things for the baby
i cant live with refusing this
your mother
she knew what she was doing
she abandoned you on that kibbutz
she didnt abandon me
my father was missing
he was in prison she was overwhelmed
oh yes
she did what anybody would do
yeah so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you
now you think israel is your mother

until i dont
do you understand me
i love you
im not the heros nice wife

banques suisse in geneva

in the operational funds box
we will deposit 250000
american dollars
you take it out we put more in
i want receipts
you are not working for
the baron rothschild
youre working for israel
a small country
im an old galicianer from
a mud hut in the ukraine
and i dont trust yekke
putzes let loose in europe
with unlimited operational expenses
i was born in israel im not a yekke
where is your grandpa from
frankfurt
youre a yekke
your wife receives monthly
1000 in her bank account
also we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds
you can leave messages for us
but there shouldnt be messages
i dont care about that
bring me receipts you got me
i got you
whatever you are doing
somebody else is paying for it
we have 11 palestinian names
each had a hand in planning munich
youre going to kill them
11 men one by one
theyre all in europe now
youll stay there as long as it takes
europe only not the arab countries
thats for us not you
and not eastern bloc
dont upset the russians
who needs it
youll have no contact with us
youre not going to
give me any information
we deposit money from a
fund that doesnt exist
into a box we dont know about
in a bank we never set foot in
we cant help you because we
never heard of you before
youll do what the terrorists do
you think they report back to home base
they dont
we want them dead
nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea
you can ask questions now
am i alone
four others
they know useful things
like cars documents
cleanup to make sure you dont
accidentally drop your fake passport
next to the dead body
youre the team leader
who kills the targets
you do who else
use guns if you have to
but the bombs are preferable
one of your guys knows how to make them
we want everyone to read in le monde
some famous arab terrorist is dead
who knows who blew him up
why me
so whats wrong with you
im not an experienced field operative
so im not known
not even i know you now
and also i lived in frankfurt
when i was a kid
so im a yekke jew who knows
his way around europe
thats a good reason
heres one more youre ordinary
you arent a sabra charles bronson
i am a sabra
i know
i know so much about you
youre a nice sabra
with a dog and a baby on the way
you wont shoot spanish bellhops
no bellhops no civilians
that kind of trouble we cant afford
the hard thing will not be finding them
some of them anyway
are not so carefully hidden
the hard thing will be not
punishing yourselves
by getting caught or getting killed
you want the last piece of baklava
no
smart decision you should avoid sweets
after all you just signed away
your dental insurance

reporter on tv initially it was
the intention of the hijackers
to bring the lufthansa to
munich international airport
and then take onboard
the three prisoners
at the end of the runway
where captain klausen took his plane
while an arab held a
hand grenade at his head
hey avner
a lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from damascus
the hijackers demanded
the release of three killers
who survived munich
and the germans said yes instantly
the arabs would be flown by
private charter plane to zagreb
look theyre free now
theyre in libya
no qualms about rejoicing
on their side eh
the israeli kills the arabs
in egypt in jordan
in lebanon in syria
look at them
theyre movie stars
but did you shoot any
of the israeli hostages
its not important to say
if i killed israelis or not
we should go to tripoli
kill them
we dont go to arab countries
we stick to the names weve been given
mahmoud hamshari
do you think looking back on it now
that you achieved anything
in the munich operation
we have made
our voice heard by the world
are those your words
the same thing again
they have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world
who has not been hearing before
well i believe
what he meant by this is
that now the world
will begin hearing us
we are for 24 years
the worlds largest refugee population
our homes taken from us
living in camps no future no food
nothing decent for our children
and so was the attack
in munich justified
the plo condemns attacks on civilians
though for 24 years
tell your newspaper that
our civilians have been attacked
by the israelis day after day
tell them about all the years
and years of palestinian blood
spilled by israel
and who mourns for us
you know israel just bombed
two refugee camps in syria and lebanon
tell them that
200 people killed
right after munich they did this
it did not begin in munich
and where does it end
how will it ever end
speaking french
im sorry i need to use your phone
i need to call my editor
yes yes sorry
you see it its by the window
thank you
this way please
speaking a french greeting
playing an upbeat tune on piano
this man we dont know
what he did specifically
hamshari arranged the attempted
assassination of bengurion
in copenhagen a few years ago
now he organizes for fatah in france
he organizes
yes
in tel aviv they showed
you evidence for this
not evidence it was more
this is the story and i believe them
why dont you
its a crisis a war
you dont have to always
what be thinking
scrutinize yeah think
you want to wire ephraim
and ask for evidence you do it
youre on your own
okay im done
good
dont think about it
okay
so now i turn it on
he picks up the phone
turns on the red light
then i take out the key insert it
and turn
so now we wait for the red light
is the truck blocking the signal
no
will the remote still work
yeah its a powerful transmitter
go back to your position
you cant start improvising now
go back to your corner
dont worry its okay
its going to work
speaking french
phone ringing
speaking french
running footsteps approaching
stop
stop
abort
are we on or off
phone ringing
mahmoud hamshari
yes
hes at the hospital cochin
i dont know how badly we hurt him
they arent saying
why did you put a firecracker
in that phone
because i didnt want
to blow up the building
what do you want from me
an arab corpse
another 200000 more or less
to eliminate target number two
yeah if hes been eliminated
we should stick with guns
no one notices a shooting
bombs achieve a double objective
they eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists
that only works when the bombs work
lunch
reporter the israeli embassy in
london was rocked by a letter bomb
shortly after 930 this morning
dr ami shachori was
opening his morning mail
when the envelope exploded
killing him instantly
they discovered seven in a mailroom
near the embassy in earls court
i guess they missed one

of mail and they got careless
they found other letters

canada argentina vienna
kinshasa paris brussels

the kgb brings him home
every night after dark
he turns on the light gets undressed
turns off the light
gets into bed we blow up the bed
i knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed
so every night he slept
on the floor of his closet
he still does every night
sleeps in closets
now if alchir sleeps in his closet
were in trouble
but if he gets in the bed
his weight arms the device
it closes the circuit
then we hit the remote
okay
okay were good were good lets go
careful
knocking at door
ive checked into the room next door
why

louis provided the plastique
avner louis provided the explosives
yes why

the plastique was much more
powerful than what i asked for

louis works for the plo
theyre using us to do
internal housecleaning
thats bullshit
hey whose fishing boat is this

id like to pay you
a little extra for this
these three names
monsieur storsch my group
we dont care much for governments
any governments
we dont work with or for them
thats an absolute condition
of my theory
you understand
if i learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt
to buy our acquiescence in
your sharing my information
with let us say
cia or mi6 or mossad
i dont work for mi6 or cia
you have no idea who you work for
trust me you dont
lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable
and unhappy
let me buy you a drink
no you save your money
at these prices
youre going to need it
ephraim
its obviously significant information
abu youssef is like number three
in the whole palestinian network
its like arafat habash and then him
of course hes significant
thanks for the instruction
and enthusiasm
hes the brains of the fedayeen
i know who he is
next to salameh
abu youssef is the worst
guy were after right
and adwan he plans all the
actions in the west bank right
we get the significance
these are serious targets
we want to go to beirut
no
you keep away from the arab countries
mossad and the army
will take care of it
what is this contraption
you cant send the army
we wont allow it
you wont allow it
our source doesnt know were mossad
you arent mossad
if commandos go to beirut
our source will cut us off
why dont you and i go for a
walk and talk about this alone
the food will get cold
we have to go to beirut
were good at this
this is our information
this is our job
thats touching in a
juvenile sort of way
listen youre doing reasonably well
reasonably
youre spending a lot of money
well we expected that
lots of people in mossad
dont know about you
no one knows
so everyones asking
whos killing the fedayeen
is it our guys why werent we told
big egos lots of screaming
i can maybe include one or two of you
but excluding mossad
or the army is impossible
accept it
we will but our source wont
who is your source
its time you told me
that by the way
is not a request its an order
you cant order him
he doesnt work for you
shut up i pay you you work for me
i work for a metal box in a bank in geneva
the box pays me
you want to find it empty
i want you to let us do our work
whats the matter with you
with all of you
grow up and do it quick
this is not a game a fucking game
who has the source
where are you getting your information
give me his goddamn number
i hope the old lady
next door enjoyed that
shes a little deaf but i doubt
she had any trouble hearing you
give me the source
and well let you take part
let us go to beirut
after beirut well use our source
to find the remaining targets
let us do our job
band playing black magic woman

my papa would like to meet you
papa
my papa he runs our little group
i thought you ran the group
everybody works for someone
i wasnt in beirut
well someone was there
the israeli army according to
every newspaper on earth
but you stayed away
after you paid so extravagantly
for the information
i dont like to keep my papa waiting
i need to tell my people
where im going
you dont know where youre going
and youll need to wear this
forget it louis thats just crazy
were done here
shit
wait
wait
were here
children speaking french
speaking french
papa
hes over there
louis says youre a cook
i know how to cook yeah
you help me
bring these there
no no dont wash no no
they will taste like boiled sponge
but then why put them in the sink
if the juices spurt out
its a big mess
the whole kitchen will smell like piss
peel off the fat
let me see your hands
too big for a good cook
that was my problem too
i had been a master
but i have thick stupid
butchers hands just like yours
well we are tragic men
butchers hands gentle souls
these are going to be too sour to eat
skin them and prick them
boil them in sugar
a little torture
and youll see how nice they are
you call me papa
i cant do that
no
i have a papa already
you are devoted to him
am i here because of
what happened in beirut
your papa must be proud of his son
well pick a few let the rest ripen
there are so many people to feed but
but they are your family
so you have to feed them
yes we dont work with governments
louis said but
but you did what you did because
you have to feed your family
papa i blew up trains bridges
and trucks full of germans
during the war
my brothers were killed
my papa and my sister were both hanged
she was a young girl
papa the guest doesnt want
to hear your war stories
we paid this price
so vichy scum could be replaced
by gaullist scum
and the nazis could be
replaced by stalin and america
we stay away from governments
we say grace
maybe our guest could lead us
no no no its not required
speaking french
our father who gives us obedient
and respectful clients
who obey the rules according to
which our business thrives
whose prevarications
and deceptions
in my despair i fathered madmen
who dress like factory workers
but never do manual labor
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit
about algerians and who love nothing
not algerians or french
or flesh and blood or anything living
so i have sympathy for a man
who can say i have a papa
and who does
what he must for his family
speaking french
i will say grace
theres some opinion you
should be punished
for what happened in beirut
we didnt know so many would die
im in business with death
do you think im squeamish
the world has been rough
with you with your tribe
its right to respond
roughly to such treatment
you pay well and you pay promptly
so well continue together
but no more infractions
thank you you have my word
a few andouillettes and boudins noirs
black blood sausage and a
loire cheese sellessurcher
we cover it in ash to preserve it
thank you
you could have been my son
but youre not remember that
well do business
but you arent family
car engine starting
i have a new name for you

you know where all the names are
salameh
untouchable
salameh
zaid muchassi
zaid muchassi is in athens in two weeks
not one of our names
nevertheless
he is black septembers kgb contact
hussein alchir was the kgb contact
yes but you put a bomb under
monsieur alchirs bed in cyprus
and now hes defunct
muchassi is his replacement
i hear hes much tougher
than his predecessor
we offer muchassis
whereabouts at the new rate
what new rate
three names for 600000
is 200000 for one name
i need you to find me a
place to work in athens
of course safe house
is this louiss idea of a joke
ive had nightmares
that looked like this
so when they explode they toss
little white balls of phosphorus
here all around his room
each ball its like a little sun
it burns at around 5000 degrees
so the air catches fire
everything in the vicinity melts
now the bad news is
they are grenades
so i modified them to use
with a remote detonator
i also should mention
that theyre quite old
like world war ii
only four were viable
we should dump the rest
theres a porter at the hotel
where muchassis staying
hes gonna let us in the
room when muchassi goes out
hey who provided these
prehistoric explosives
louis

lets stay together by al green
eventually the arab states
will rise against israel
they dont like palestinians
but they hate the jews more
it wont be like 1967
the rest of the world will see by
then what the israelis do to us
they wont help when egypt
and syria attack even jordan
israel will cease to exist
what
this is a dream you cant take back
a country you never had
you sound like a jew
fuck you
im the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know
you people have nothing to bargain with
youll never get the land back
youll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for palestine
we have a lot of children
theyll have children
so we can wait forever
and if we need to we can make
the whole planet unsafe for jews
you kill jews and the world
feels bad for them
and thinks you are animals
yes
but then the world will see how
theyve made us into animals
theyll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages
you are arabs
there are lots of places for arabs
youre a jew sympathizer
all you germans
youre too soft on israel
well you give us money
but you feel guilty about hitler
and the jews exploit that guilt
my father didnt gas any jews
tell me something ali
what
do you really miss your
fathers olive trees
do you honestly think you have
to get back all that that nothing
that chalky soil and stone huts
is that what you really
want for your children
it absolutely is
it will take a hundred years
but well win
how long did it take the jews
to get their own country
how long did it take the germans
to make germany
and look how well that worked out
you dont know what it
is not to have a home
thats why you european reds
dont get it
you say its nothing
but you have a home to come back to
eta anc ira
we all pretend we care about
your international revolution
but we dont care
we want to be nations
home is everything
no no no
no i watch
you only take money
enclosed in papers yes
of course
speaking arabic
look there
here they come in their pumpkin coach
the russians and
cinderella
speaking arabic

arabs go into the room with him
why are the russians waiting
why dont they leave
they are waiting
we are waiting stay calm
hey im calm

just flip the switch do it
i dont understand it
whats wrong
its a piece of shit
what fuck not again
wait wait
wheres the explosion
it shouldve exploded by now
whats gone wrong
its another malfunction
you know what

this is a waste of time
careful with that stuff hans
hans
hans what are you doing

hans no no
so how long is he going to be
maybe one hour
speaking german
screaming in arabic
hans panting
shouting in greek
i know you
stop
get in head down
ali ali ali
are you incapable of making
something that works
shut up you shut up
does anybody speak greek
shut him up
did we kill a russian
thats not good
where did you get your training
every single bomb
every fucking one is fucked up
i was not trained to do this
i was trained to dismantle bombs
not to build them
holy shit
shin bet wanted bomb dismantlers
they picked me from the army
a toy maker
give me some money
they figured i was good
with small machines
but then after munich they asked
if i could build bombs instead
so i said yes
come on here
cursing in greek
reporter the three went to
the side of the customs hall
took out pieces of their rifles
and quickly assembled them
then they threw hand grenades into
the long queues of passengers
waiting to clear passport control
and began automatic fire
it was all over in a matter of minutes
and the firing was indiscriminate
salameh is in london
he goes there periodically to
meet with his cia contact
his what
salameh works for the cia
bullshit
salameh guarantees
that black september
wont touch american diplomats
in exchange
the cia gives him lots of money
and they dont ask what he uses it for
did he tell them
about munich in advance
did the cia know about munich
the cia didnt even know
black september existed
before munich
one of the guerrillas was
shot through the head
by a ricochet bullet
a second was blown up
by his own hand grenade
louis since then hes been busy
hasnt he
all manner of costly exercises
shooting tourists
in the athens airport
blowing up pharmacies in amsterdam
and that mossad agent
in barcelona before that
europe hasnt been this interesting
since napoleon marched to moscow
do you have to do that here
salameh is in london
for the usual price
we followed him from
his doctor to his hotel
hes here for eye treatment
salameh you saw him
you followed him
yes
wearing sunglasses in the rain
why didnt you shoot him
there were bodyguards civilians
were they armed
yes
well then theyre not civilians
id have done it
if youd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone
im the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys
maybe thats why we never let you do it
we only go after our targets
since when
i mean why are
we worried about that now
do you have any idea how
many laws weve broken
its time to stop your agonizing
its counterproductive
including incidentally
the laws of the state of israel
which has no death penalty
you know what your problem is habibi
youre disorientated
because the guys were killing
are dressed in expensive suits
and this is london
and not some ugly arab village
im not disoriented
im keeping my sanity by
occasionally reminding myself
that in spite of
but its the same
old war were fighting
im still at least in principle
a human being
over the same old scrap of desert
its just weve brought our war
to copenhagen and kensington
and its not like these european
antisemites dont deserve that
unless we learn to act like them
we will never defeat them
we act like them all the time
what you think the palestinians
invented bloodshed
how do you think we got control
of the land by being nice
somebody pull down this mans pants
see if hes circumcised
i think we have
a double agent in our midst
dont you dare accuse me of that
stop it
my son died in 67
you foulmouthed son of a bitch
everything you can ask
ive done for israel
ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful
why its not distasteful to you
no
cause the only blood that
matters to me is jewish blood
nice job eh nice job leading
if the bodyguards are armed
we kill them
theyre armed
well then we kill them

stop chasing the mice inside your skull

you ever feel reluctant
im not comfortable with confusion
i knew guys like you in the army
youll do any terrifying
thing youre asked to do

carl

shes dutch not political
entirely businessminded
she lives in hoorn shes there now
this is dependable information
for which you pay nothing
were giving you this
you understand why
because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do
with the murder of my partner
we inhabit a world of
intersecting secrecies
we live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet
thats what we accept
we buy information for you
from your enemies
this alerts them
youre not the only people
looking for names
youre telling me im being hunted now
hes telling you its time
for you to quit
the race is not to the swift
nor the battle to the strong
but time and chance happens to them all
evil falls suddenly
who can say when it falls
announcements over pa in french
so youre really gonna kill her
all this blood comes back to us
eventually it will work
even if it takes years well beat them
were jews avner
jews dont do wrong because
our enemies do wrong
we cant afford to be
that decent anymore
i dont know that we ever
were that decent
suffering thousands of years of
hatred doesnt make you decent
but were supposed to be righteous
thats a beautiful thing
thats jewish
thats what i knew
thats what i was taught
and now im losing it
and i lose that thats
thats
thats everything
thats my soul

hans in seven months weve
killed six of the 11 names
weve killed one replacement
one of our targets
is in prison and four
including ali hassan salameh
are at large
one of our own has fallen
since we began the other side has
sent letter bombs to 11 embassies
hijacked three planes
killed 130 passengers in athens
and wounded scores more
and killed our military
attaché in washington
some of it was done by a venezuelan
called carlos the jackal
who replaced zaid muchassi
who replaced hussein alchir
black septembers original
leadership has been decimated
but new leaders are emerging
for whom black september
wasnt violent enough
and to dispatch our six
dispatched targets
we must have spent something
close to 2 million right
youve been cooking
are you expecting company
mrs meir says to the knesset
the world must see that killing jews
will be from now on an
expensive proposition
but killing palestinians
isnt exactly cheap
if all 11 were dead youd stop
yes
youre lying
what about their replacements
with each time we kill
we create six more
maybe theyll have to
keep killing them then
forever
five targets are still alive
thats five men that need to be killed
eventually you forget that in
the beginning you hated doing it
for me personally
i feel less every day
one day im going to wake up
im going to kill
im going to go back to bed
im not going to feel anything at all
hey hans you know theres a rule
in the book against blind drunks
why dont you stop drinking
and eat something
i mean theres enough food
here to feed bangladesh

louis ali hassan salameh is
in tarifa on the spanish coast
hes at a compound guarded
by all the predictable trouble
bomb makers often die accidental deaths
in athens you shot a kgb agent
many people must want to kill you
monsieur storsch
but why would i do that
you pay better than anyone
its dangerous going after salameh
but he planned the munich massacre
eliminate him and theyll let you
go home dont you think
yes louis i do
you could have a kitchen
like that someday
it costs dearly but home always does
festive voices
shit its like a funhouse in there

problems with the job you did
except three of my men died

not in any way your fault
he sings your praises
best guy he ever worked for and so on
he says this french group
louis was his name
they sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts
they helped kill your men
i know steve believes that

your harmless little writer in rome
he was behind the bomb on
el al flight 76 in 1968
he was working on
another bomb last august
i could go on and on with this
according to evidence nobody has seen
if these people committed crimes
we should have arrested them
like eichmann
if these guys live israelis die
whatever doubts you have
avner you know this is true
you did well but youre unhappy
i killed seven men
not salameh
well get him of course
you think you were the only team
its a big operation
you were only a part
does that assuage your guilt
did we accomplish anything at all
every man we killed has
been replaced by worse
why cut my fingernails
theyll grow back
did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership
or the palestinian leadership
you tell me what weve done
you killed them for the
sake of a country
you now choose to abandon
the country your mother and father built
that you were born into
you killed them for munich
for the future for peace
theres no peace at the end of this
no matter what you believe
you know this is true
heres what i know
your father is sick
your mother will be alone
youre a sabra
your wife and daughter are sabras
what i came to say is this
come home
come to my house for dinner tonight
come on
youre a jew youre a stranger
