jesus christ

at least theres no gangrene
there will be if it doesnt come off soon
i cant saw if i cant keep my eyes open

sons of bitches
come on you better take cover
i aint kidding these boys are shooters
come on go under cover
there you go
you went to the hospital
it was no good
whats going on here
whats going on here
that seems to be the question all right
see you could ask the major
but he dont know
hes busy
hes busy trying to figure out
how come the officers mess
run out of peach ice cream
then of course you got the general
he come up to see the show
all he knows is there aint no show
which aint entirely correct
cause we started a balloon up
but they shot her down
before we got off the ground
nobodys made a run either way
its been a standoff all damned day
now the major hes looking at the general
hes thinking to himself
i better do something
you know what that means
i sure as hell dont want to be
the first one across this field
theyre supposed to be beat up just like us
hell everybody knows
tuckers men are tough as cobs
so far the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows
course thats about to change
you son of a bitch
you know some of the boys are saying
if we aint gonna fight
we could just settle
this whole business with a little
highstakes poker
wouldnt that be a sight
a bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field
drawing cards
what is it sir
looks like a suicide
tucker
whats he doing
what did you say to him
i didnt say nothing
come on back you son of a bitch
you wont make it no second time
all right by me
forgive me father
hes coming back again
here he comes boys
ready
i got him
dont
dont take off my foot
you rest easy son youll keep your foot
with god as my judge youll keep it
bring up my ambulance
sir
bring up my ambulance
and bring my surgeon with it
we got an officer
whos worth something lying here
the strangeness of this life
cannot be measured
in trying to produce my own death
i was elevated to the status of a living hero
i was also awarded cisco
the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day
and on full recovery
was given transfer to any station i desired
the bloody slaughter continues in the east
as i arrive at fort hayes
a tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a neverending sea of prairie
lieutenant

lt john j dunbar

the foulest man i have ever met

assemble the men in front of my quarters
you hate me
but i feel none of the same for you
you men stayed
you stayed after they took all our horses
you stayed after all the others deserted
you stayed after the army failed to resupply us
i have looked for that wagon from fort hayes
just as you have
day after miserable day
and all i can say is that im proud of you
now get your things men
were leaving this place
the army can go to hell
go
get your things
how come we havent seen any buffalo
you cant figure the stinking buffalo
you cant
sometimes you wont see any for days
other times theyll be thick
like curls on a whore
what about indians
indians goddamn indians
you just as soon not see em
unless the bastards are dead
theyre nothing but thieves and beggars

thank you
jake and jim
good mule
haw up there now
good mules
have arrived to find fort sedgewick deserted
am now waiting for garrisons return
or word from headquarters
the post is in exceedingly poor condition
and i have decided to assign myself
cleanup duty beginning tomorrow
supplies are abundant
and the country
is everything i dreamed it would be
there can be no place like this on earth
bad horse
bad horse
the animals in the pond
had not been poisoned
they had all been shot
but why was it for sport
could it have been out of spite
my first guess would have been
that the men here were starving
but this rotting waste speaks to the contrary
the caves are an even bigger mystery
what could have driven men to live in caves
perhaps they were frightened
maybe there had been some sort of revolt
i can make no sense of the clues left me here
perhaps my relief will provide the answers
come on cisco one more time
git up
come on git up cisco
git up
git up there you go
easy
only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see
maybe theres more than one
there might be three or four
i know three or four
who will not be making the trip back home
we have nothing to show for this trail
we have no rifles
white men are sure to have rifles
its hard to say how many might be down there
we should forget this and go home
then go
i would rather die
than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country
he will not quit until we are all dead
and if i
look at me
dont hurt my mules
stop
stop it
please dont hurt my mules
i am pleased with my efforts thus far
for all my improvements though
there remains an ugliness here i cannot dispel
an injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise it will be slow to heal
its been almost 30 days
i have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at fort sedgewick
especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with cisco
each day we go further into the prairie
and every discovery
big or small
becomes etched in my mind forever
it would seem ive been marooned
as no one has yet come for me
i can only assume that there is a problem
which the army will solve shortly
maybe i am being foolish in my optimism
but when i look to the eastern horizon
i never fail to hope
that a column might be out there
still no sign of capt cargills command
though wellsupplied
ive decided to ration my goods
as if i were part
of a post instead of the whole affair
theres a wolf who seems intent
on the goingson here
he does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance however
and aside from cisco
has been my only company
hes appeared
each afternoon for the past two days
he has two milky white paws
if he comes calling tomorrow
i will name him twosocks
almost a month and no one has come
the longer this condition persists
the less inclined i am
to believe that anyone will
rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now
and i have begun work on an awning
it is the loneliest of times for me now
but i can say honestly
that i am not unhappy
how can i marry a pretty little girl
when i got no coat to put on
soldier soldier
wont you marry me
before the fight comes home
how can i marry a pretty little girl
when i got no shoes to put on
how can i marry a pretty little girl
when i got no hat to put on
soldier soldier wont you marry me
before the fight comes home
how can i marry an ugly little girl
when i got a pretty wife back home
you there
have made first contact with a wild indian
one came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse
when i appeared
he became frightened and ran off
have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands
keeping only the barest necessities for myself
my afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols
always keeping the post in sight
am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation
do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity
but am assuming that where there is one
theres sure to be another
most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion
of strength and stability
im still alone however
and unless troops arrive soon
all may be lost
kicking bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days
i do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone
what does his wife say
she says that he is keeping to himself
thats not what i asked you
well what did you ask me
what did she say
she said that he is keeping
to himself these days
thats what she says
make sure that my meat is soft
my teeth hurt
may i come in
no let him sit with me
our country seems good this summer
but i have not been out to see it
but the buffalo are late
and i always worry
about the bellies of our children
i was thinking of a dance
yes a dance is always a good idea
it would be good to have a strong sign
theres a funny thing about signs
we know when they are bad or good
sometimes they are strange
and its hard to understand them
a smart man will think on these things
if he is still confused he will tell somebody
for instance he might tell you or me
a smart man always does this
i have seen such a sign
really
i saw a man
a naked white man
are you sure it was a man
i saw his sex
did you speak to him
no
its been two days now and nothing
my presence here must
have been reported by now
have made all the preparations i can think of
cannot mount an adequate defense
as i am still alone
but will try to make
a big impression when they come
waiting
postscript
the man i encountered was
a magnificentlooking fellow
he might be a god
or a white chief with special abilities
that is why we should talk with him
i do not care for this talk about this white man
whatever he is he is not a sioux
and that makes him less
when i hear that more whites are coming
i want to laugh
we took a hundred horses from these people
there was no honor in it
they dont ride well they dont shoot well
theyre dirty
those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here
and these people are said to flourish
i think they will all be dead soon
i think this fool is probably lost
wind in his hairs words are strong
and i have heard them
its true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand
but make no mistake the whites are coming
even our enemies agree on this
so when i see one man alone
without fear in our country
i do not think he is lost
i think he may have medicine
i see someone who might speak
for all the white people who are coming
i think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck
kicking bird is always looking ahead
and that is good
but this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children
he is nothing to us
i will take some men
we will shoot some arrows into this white man
if he truly has medicine he will not be hurt
if he has no medicine he will be dead
no man can tell another what to do
but killing a white man is a delicate matter
if you kill one more are sure to come
its easy to become confused
by these questions
its hard to know what to do
we should talk about this some more
that is all i have to say
whats the matter now
we dont think this is such a good idea
if we take the horse of a white god
they will make up songs about us
maybe
they will ask us to go on raids
who gets the horse
i do
i do but we share now who can say
this is not a great plan
its always the same
every time
yes sir i have no ill ask sir
well be heroes
theyll write songs about us
what happened
i dont know my arm doesnt work
you shouldnt have fallen off
now well get in trouble
it was your idea
my idea was only to take the horse
not fall down
otter hurt himself
what are you looking at
im the one whos hurt
i will be when my father finds out
his bow will be across my back
i am wind in his hair
i am wind in his hair
do you see that i am not afraid of you
do you see
the party that went against the utes
is coming back
there are many hearts on the ground
i realize now that i have been wrong
all this time ive been waiting
waiting for what
for someone to find me
for indians to take my horse
to see a buffalo
since i have arrived at this post
i have been walking on eggs
it has become a bad habit and i am sick of it
tomorrow morning
i will ride out to the indians
i do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking
but ive become a target
and a target makes a poor impression
i am through waiting
what are you looking at
son of a bitch
no wait
wait
wait
you need help youre hurt
you need
