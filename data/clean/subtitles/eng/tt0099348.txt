jesus christ 
you there  is this the last one 
god  what a mess 
at least there s no gangrene 
there will be if it doesn t come off soon 
i can t saw if i can t keep my eyes open 
i m sorry 
let s coffee up  he can wait a few more minutes 
god 
glass 
  is that tucker s men 
  yes  sir  i think it is 
how long has it been like this 
we found  em this morning  sir 
they ve been here for two days 
is that you  lieutenant 
sons of bitches 
come on  you better take cover 
i ain t kidding  these boys are shooters 
come on  go under cover 
there you go 
you went to the hospital 
it was no good 
what s going on here 
what s going on here 
that seems to be the question  all right 
see  you could ask the major   
   but he don t know 
he s busy 
he s busy trying to figure out
how come the officers  mess   
   run out of peach ice cream 
then  of course  you got the general 
he come up to see the show 
all he knows is there ain t no show   
   which ain t entirely correct
 cause we started a balloon up   
   but they shot her down
before we got off the ground 
nobody s made a run either way 
it s been a standoff all damned day 
now  the major  he s looking at the general 
he s thinking to himself 
 i better do something  
you know what that means 
i sure as hell don t want to be
the first one across this field 
they re supposed to be beat up just like us 
hell  everybody knows
tucker s men are tough as cobs 
so far  the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows 
course  that s about to change 
you son of a bitch 
you know  some of the boys are saying
if we ain t gonna fight   
   we could just settle
this whole business with a little   
   high stakes poker 
wouldn t that be a sight 
a bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field   
   drawing cards 
what is it  sir 
looks like a suicide 
tucker 
what s he doing 
  what did you say to him 
  i didn t say nothing 
come on back  you son of a bitch 
  you won t make it no second time 
  all right by me 
forgive me  father 
  he s coming back again 
  here he comes  boys 
  ready 
  i got him 
don t   
don t take off my foot 
you rest easy  son  you ll keep your foot 
with god as my judge  you ll keep it 
  bring up my ambulance 
  sir 
bring up my ambulance 
and bring my surgeon with it 
we got an officer
who s worth something lying here 
 the strangeness of this life
cannot be measured 
 in trying to produce my own death   
    i was elevated to the status of a living hero 
 i was also awarded cisco   
    the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day 
 and on full recovery 
was given transfer to any station i desired 
 the bloody slaughter continues in the east
as i arrive at fort hayes 
 a tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never ending sea of prairie  
lieutenant 
where can i find maj  fambrough 
down at the end of the hall 
thank you 
 lt  john j  dunbar  
lt  john j  dunbar

to be posted on the frontier

i quickly deduced that you re an indian fighter 
i did not ascend to this position
by being stupid 
  no  sir 
   no  sir  
it says here that you ve been decorated 
yes  sir 
and they sent you here to be posted

you will report to captain cargill   
   at the furthermost outpost of the realm   
   fort sedgewick 
my personal seal will assure your safety   
   through many miles
of wild and hostile country 
  i was wondering   
  yes 
i was wondering  sir  how will i be getting there

why don t you put that in your book 
 were it not for my companion   
    i believe i would be having the time of my life 
 i know he means well   
    but he is quite possibly
the foulest man i have ever met  
how far you make the fort

forty  fifty mile  maybe 
what s the big hurry on sedgewick 
it s to be my post 
my home

just please come out 
it s the end 
assemble the men in front of my quarters 
you hate me 
but i feel none of the same for you 
you men stayed 
you stayed after they took all our horses 
you stayed after all the others deserted 
you stayed after the army failed to resupply us 
i have looked for that wagon from fort hayes   
   just as you have   
   day after miserable day 
and all i can say is that i m proud of you 
now get your things  men 
we re leaving this place 
the army can go to hell 
go 
get your things 
how come we haven t seen any buffalo 
you can t figure the stinking buffalo 
you can t 
sometimes you won t see any for days 
other times  they ll be thick 
like curls on a whore 
what about indians 
indians  goddamn indians 
you just as soon not see  em
unless the bastards are dead 
they re nothing but thieves and beggars 
ho  up there

thank you 
jake and jim 
good mule 
haw up there now 
good mules 
 have arrived to find fort sedgewick deserted 
 am now waiting for garrison s return
or word from headquarters 
 the post is in exceedingly poor condition   
    and i have decided to assign myself
clean up duty beginning tomorrow 
 supplies are abundant   
    and the country
is everything i dreamed it would be 
 there can be no place like this on earth  
bad horse 
bad horse 
 the animals in the pond
had not been poisoned 
 they had all been shot 
 but why  was it for sport 
 could it have been out of spite 
 my first guess would have been
that the men here were starving 
 but this rotting waste speaks to the contrary 
 the caves are an even bigger mystery 
 what could have driven men to live in caves 
 perhaps they were frightened 
 maybe there had been some sort of revolt 
 i can make no sense of the clues left me here 
 perhaps my relief will provide the answers  
come on  cisco  one more time 
git up 
come on  git up  cisco 
git up 
git up  there you go 
easy 
only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see 
maybe there s more than one 
there might be three or four 
i know three or four   
   who will not be making the trip back home 
we have nothing to show for this trail 
we have no rifles 
white men are sure to have rifles 
it s hard to say how many might be down there 
we should forget this and go home 
then go 
i would rather die   
   than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country 
he will not quit until we are all dead 
 and if i    
look at me 
don t hurt my mules 
stop 
stop it 
please don t hurt my mules 
 i am pleased with my efforts thus far 
 for all my improvements  though 
there remains an ugliness here i cannot dispel 
 an injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise  it will be slow to heal 
 it s been almost 30 days 
 i have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at fort sedgewick 
 especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with cisco 
 each day  we go further into the prairie
and every discovery   
    big or small 
becomes etched in my mind forever 
 it would seem i ve been marooned 
as no one has yet come for me 
 i can only assume that there is a problem 
which the army will solve shortly 
 maybe i am being foolish in my optimism   
    but when i look to the eastern horizon   
    i never fail to hope
that a column might be out there  
 still no sign of capt  cargill s command 
 though well supplied 
i ve decided to ration my goods   
    as if i were part
of a post instead of the whole affair 
 there s a wolf who seems intent
on the goings on here 
 he does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance  however 
 and aside from cisco 
has been my only company 
 he s appeared
each afternoon for the past two days 
 he has two milky white paws 
 if he comes calling tomorrow   
    i will name him two socks  
 almost a month and no one has come 
 the longer this condition persists   
    the less inclined i am
to believe that anyone will 
 rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now   
    and i have begun work on an awning 
 it is the loneliest of times for me now   
    but i can say honestly
that i am not unhappy  
 how can i marry a pretty little girl
 when i got no coat to put on 
 soldier  soldier
 won t you marry me
 before the fight comes home 
 how can i marry a pretty little girl
 when i got no shoes to put on 
 how can i marry a pretty little girl
 when i got no hat to put on 
 soldier  soldier  won t you marry me
 before the fight comes home 
 how can i marry an ugly little girl
 when i got a pretty wife back home  
you there 
 have made first contact with a wild indian 
 one came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse 
 when i appeared 
he became frightened and ran off 
 have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands 
 keeping only the barest necessities for myself 
 my afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols   
    always keeping the post in sight 
 am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation 
 do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity   
    but am assuming that where there is one
there s sure to be another 
 most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion   
    of strength and stability 
 i m still alone  however 
and unless troops arrive soon   
    all may be lost  
kicking bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days 
i do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone 
what does his wife say 
she says that he is keeping to himself 
that s not what i asked you 
well  what did you ask me 
what did she say 
she said that he is keeping
to himself these days 
that s what she says 
make sure that my meat is soft 
my teeth hurt 
may i come in 
no  let him sit with me 
our country seems good this summer   
   but i have not been out to see it 
but the buffalo are late 
and i always worry
about the bellies of our children 
i was thinking of a dance 
yes  a dance is always a good idea 
it would be good to have a strong sign 
there s a funny thing about signs 
we know when they are bad or good 
sometimes they are strange
and it s hard to understand them 
a smart man will think on these things 
if he is still confused  he will tell somebody 
for instance  he might tell you or me 
a smart man always does this 
i have seen such a sign 
really 
i saw a man 
a naked  white man 
are you sure it was a man 
i saw his sex 
did you speak to him 
no 
 it s been two days now  and nothing 
 my presence here must
have been reported by now 
 have made all the preparations i can think of 
 cannot mount an adequate defense
as i am still alone 
 but will try to make
a big impression when they come 
 waiting 
 post script   
 the man i encountered was
a magnificent looking fellow  
he might be a god 
or a white chief with special abilities 
that is why we should talk with him 
i do not care for this talk about this white man 
whatever he is  he is not a sioux 
and that makes him less 
when i hear that more whites are coming 
i want to laugh 
we took a hundred horses from these people 
there was no honor in it 
they don t ride well  they don t shoot well 
they re dirty 
those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here 
and these people are said to flourish 
i think they will all be dead soon 
i think this fool is probably lost 
wind in his hair s words are strong
and i have heard them 
it s true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand 
but make no mistake  the whites are coming 
even our enemies agree on this 
so when i see one man alone
without fear in our country   
   i do not think he is lost 
i think he may have medicine 
i see someone who might speak   
   for all the white people who are coming 
i think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck 
kicking bird is always looking ahead
and that is good 
but this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children 
he is nothing to us 
i will take some men 
we will shoot some arrows into this white man 
if he truly has medicine  he will not be hurt 
if he has no medicine  he will be dead 
no man can tell another what to do 
but killing a white man is a delicate matter 
if you kill one  more are sure to come 
it s easy to become confused
by these questions 
it s hard to know what to do 
we should talk about this some more 
that is all i have to say 
what s the matter  now 
we don t think this is such a good idea 
if we take the horse of a white god   
   they will make up songs about us 
maybe 
they will ask us to go on raids 
who gets the horse 
i do 
i do  but we share  now who can say
this is not a great plan 
it s always the same 
every time 
yes  sir  i have  no  i ll ask  sir 
we ll be heroes 
they ll write songs about us 
what happened 
i don t know  my arm doesn t work 
you shouldn t have fallen off 
now we ll get in trouble 
it was your idea 
my idea was only to take the horse 
not fall down 
otter hurt himself 
what are you looking at 
i m the one who s hurt 
i will be when my father finds out 
his bow will be across my back 
i am wind in his hair 
i am wind in his hair 
do you see that i am not afraid of you 
do you see 
the party that went against the utes
is coming back 
there are many hearts on the ground 
 i realize now that i have been wrong 
 all this time  i ve been waiting 
 waiting for what 
 for someone to find me 
 for indians to take my horse 
 to see a buffalo 
 since i have arrived at this post
i have been walking on eggs 
 it has become a bad habit and i am sick of it 
 tomorrow morning 
i will ride out to the indians 
 i do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking   
    but i ve become a target
and a target makes a poor impression 
 i am through waiting  
what are you looking at 
son of a bitch 
no  wait 
wait 
wait 
you need help  you re hurt 
  you need
