post exceedingly poor condition
decided assign cleanup duty beginning tomorrow
supplies abundant
country everything dreamed would
place like earth
bad horse
bad horse
animals pond poisoned
shot
sport
could spite
first guess would men starving
rotting waste speaks contrary
caves even bigger mystery
could driven men live caves
perhaps frightened
maybe sort revolt
make sense clues left
perhaps relief provide answers
come cisco one time
git
come git cisco
git
git go
easy
white man would make fire everyone see
maybe theres one

hard say many might
forget go home

would rather die
argue single line smoke country
quit dead

look

stop
stop
please dont hurt mules
pleased efforts thus far
improvements though remains ugliness dispel
injury goes beyond neglect like bruise slow heal
almost days
come enjoy patterns life fort sedgewick
especially daily reconnaissance rides cisco
day go prairie every discovery
big small becomes etched mind forever
would seem ive marooned one yet come
assume problem army solve shortly
maybe foolish optimism
look eastern horizon
never fail hope column might
still sign capt cargills command
though wellsupplied ive decided ration goods
part post instead whole affair
theres wolf seems intent goingson
seem inclined nuisance however
aside cisco company
