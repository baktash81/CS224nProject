youve been in my thoughts since
i heard lord darlington had died
we read that his heirs
put darlington hall up for sale
as they no longer wished
to maintain it
as no one would buy
such a large house
the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds
we also saw some rubbish in the
daily mail which made my blood boil
traitors nest to be pulled down
one hundred and eighty guineas
one hundred and eighty
have we done
ladies and gentlemen
a great highlight of the sale
lot 414
the fine elizabethan portrait
a portly gentleman
ill start the bidding
at 2000 guineas
2000 guineas thank you
4000 guineas
four and a half thousand
and a half
and a half
and a half
and a half
and a half
10000 guineas is bid
and a half
and a half
against you sir
at eleven and a half thousand guineas
all done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas
i was very relieved to read
how an american millionaire
named lewis saved
darlington hall
so you wouldnt be turned out
of your home after all
is it the same congressman lewis
who attended his lordships
conference in 1936
mr stevens i so often think
of the good old days
when i was the housekeeper
it was hard work
and i have known butlers easier
to please than our mr stevens
but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life
you must have a completely
different staff now
not many of the old faces
around anymore
theres not much need
for the small army of footmen
that lord darlington employed
my own news is not very cheerful
in the 7 years since i last wrote
i have again left my husband
and sad to say
my marriage seems to be over
im staying at a friends
boarding house in clevedon
i dont know what my future is
since catherine my daughter got
married my life has been empty
the years stretch before me and
if only i knew how to fill them
but i would like to be useful again
burned again
yes im sorry sir
the rule in the kitchen
has always been
cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast
why dont we get her a popup toaster
we need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan sir
a staff plan huh
i didnt know we had one
a faulty one unfortunately
sir quite recently
you were kind enough to suggest
that i go on a little holiday trip
around the country
absolutely certainly take a break
see the world
thank you sir
when did you last see the world
the world always used to come
to this house if i may say so
you may say so
take off when im in london next week
i tell you what you take the car
take the daimler
good lord sir i couldnt
you and that daimler belong together
you were made for each other
thats most kind of you
i must say sir most kind
id meant to travel the west where i
understand we have splendid scenery
and i might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while im there
a former housekeeper at present
living in clevedon has indicated
that she might be prepared
to return to service
whats this your girlfriend
or a former attachment
oh no sir
no but a very able housekeeper
a most able housekeeper
i was just kidding stevens
sorry
you know what i like best
about your papers
these obituaries
every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration
its not an art we have in the states
indeed sir
thank you stevens
mr lewis
dear mrs benn
i propose to reach clevedon
on october 3rd around 4 pm
id be grateful for a line from you
to reach me at the post office
at collingbourne near hungerford
where im planning to stop
mrs benn i always said you
possess an amazing memory
our new employer is indeed
congressman lewis
though hes now retired
from political life in the us
hes taken up residence at darlington
hall soon to be joined by his family
but i regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size
mrs benn will you permit me
once again to sing your praises
let me state that when you left
to get married
no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department
i well remember your arrival
at darlington hall
you came somewhat unexpectedly
one might even say impulsively
while we were dead in the middle
of the charlgrove meet
that day is marked in my
memory in another way as well
it was the last time his lordship
was happy to welcome
his neighbours as in the old days
of course it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt
it was never a sport his lordship
enjoyed or approved of
good morning ayres
my lord nice to see you
excuse me sir
i fear i may have been a little
unwelcoming even a little short
you presented the best references
ive ever seen
which proved to be welldeserved
though i confess i did have my
doubts on account of your youth
no gentleman callers allowed
of course
forgive my mentioning it but weve
had those problems before
inside the house too
the previous housekeeper ran off
with the underbutler
if two staff members decide to get
married one can say nothing
what i find a major irritation
are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance
housekeepers are particularly
guilty here
no offense intended of course
none taken
i know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying
yes indeed
might i have a word sir
of course
my lord its regarding
the underbutler
and the housekeeper
who ran off last month
bad business
how are you managing
ive found two
firstrate replacements
miss kenton a young woman
with excellent references
very pleasing demeanour
appears to be very able
and a man with
considerable experience
older and happy to be underbutler
name
stevens sir
stevens
yes sir
thats your name
hes my father sir
really
couldnt do better
id like to see him sometime
hes outside the door
good bring him in
thank you my lord
father
mr stevens how do you do
my lord
very good man here your son
he serves the house well
i dont know what wed do without him
proud of him
very my lord
quite right too
glad to have you with us
thank you my lord
what are we at dinner tonight
14 16
twelve sir
right
thank you my lord
this pitcher seems out of place here
dining room well spotted
hello william how are you
good day miss kenton
i thought these might
brighten your parlour
beg your pardon
they might cheer things up for you
thats very kind of you
if you like i could bring in
some more for you
thank you
but i regard this room
as my private place of work
and i prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum
would you call flowers
a distraction then
i appreciate your kindness
i prefer to keep things as they are
but since you are here there is a
small matter i wanted to mention
i happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning
and i heard you call
to someone named william
may i ask who you were
addressing by that name
i should think i was
addressing your father
there are no other williams
in this house
true
may i ask you in future to address
my father as mr stevens
if speaking of him
to a third party you may call him
mr stevens sr
to distinguish him from myself
so i would be most grateful to you
miss kenton
i dont quite understand
what youre getting at
i am the housekeeper in this house
and your father is the underbutler
i am accustomed to addressing under
servants by their christian names
if you would stop to think for a moment
youd realize
how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as william
someone such as my father
it must have been very galling for
your father to be called william
by one such as myself
my father is a person from whom
if youd observe him more
you may learn things
im grateful for your advice
but do tell me
what things might i learn from him
i might point out that youre
often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which
im sure mr stevens sr
is very good at his job
but i can assure you
that im very good at mine
of course
thank you
if you will please excuse me
oh well
my compliments to cook
what a lovely piece of crackling
im sure you said something witty
share it with the rest of us
i said the sprouts is done the way
i like them crisplike not mushy
sprouts are done not is done
isnt that right george
yes mr stevens
forgive the correction
as i would have done
at your age for the sake
of my education
im sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession
oh yes i want to be
a butler to be called mister
sit in my own pantry by my own fire
smoking my cigar
i wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler
takes dignity thats what it takes
thank you mr stevens
dignity thats right dignity
the definition from our quarterly
the gentlemens gentleman
a great butler must be possessed
of dignity
in keeping with his position
there was this english butler
in india
one day he goes in the dining room
and whats under the table
a tiger
not turning a hair
he goes to the drawing room
excuse me my lord and whispering
so as not to upset the ladies
im sorry there appears to
be a tiger in the dining room
perhaps his lordship will permit
use of the twelvebores
they go on drinking their tea
and then theres three gunshots
they dont think nothing of it
in india theyre used to anything
when the butler is back
to refresh the teapots
he says cool as a cucumber
dinner will be served
at the usual time my lord
and i am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left
of the recent occurrence
by that time
ill repeat itthere will be
no discernible traces left
of the recent occurrence
by that time
wonderful mr stevens
thank you mr stevens
wonderful story thats the ideal
that we should all aim for dignity
for you mr stevens
thank you
its for mr stevens sr
mr stevens
thank you miss kenton
put mr stevens srs plate
with cook to keep it warm
yes miss kenton
thank you
not at all mr stevens
if youre searching for your dustpan
it is out on the landing
my dustpan
youve left it on the landing
i havent used a dustpan
really it must be somebody else
i dont follow you
my mistake no doubt one of many
morning sir
ive invited giscard dupont divry
as the french delegate
hell never come
i just had word of his acceptance
dupont is fanatically antigerman
his speech in geneva in 33
made me ashamed to be
an ally of the french
its not the english way
no it is not
this is the purpose of our conference
to discuss these matters informally
far from the todo
of an international conference
in the friendly and relaxed
atmosphere of ones home
we may bring round the french
to our point of view
and that of the germans
im sorry to interrupt but how can we
associate with the germans
with the nazi party they have torn
up and trampled every treaty
and are a growing threat to europe
not to mention a brutal dictatorship
my dear boy when i was in berlin
i saw at last a happy german people
with jobs bread pride in their
country and love of their leader
and what about the jews
did his lordship wish to exchange
the chinaman in the cabinet room
with the one outside the door
chinaman
yes
the chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door see for yourself
im busy at the moment
just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself
ill look into the matter later
you think its a fantasy
a fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience
im busy in this room miss kenton
i shall wait
outside
look
is that not the wrong chinaman
i am very busy
have you nothing better to do
than stand around
look at it and tell me the truth
keep your voice down
what would the other servants think
of us shouting about a chinaman
and i would ask you
to turn around
and look at the chinaman
it is a small mistake
your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with
let me pass
your father left the dustpan
on the floor
he left polish on the cutlery
and confused the chinaman
recognize this before he commits
a major error
you cant talk to me like this
im afraid i must
im giving you serious advice
your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good
whatever he once was he no longer
has the same ability or strength
i thank you for your advice
perhaps now i can go about
my business
i never meant to keep you
from your business
thank you
its vital that weve agreed a common
policy before the arrival of
your frenchman whats his name
giscard dupont divry
we also expect the
american delegate
congressman lewis
to arrive on the same day
who is he this american
hes an unknown quantity a young
congressman from pennsylvania
sits on some sort of powerful
foreign affairs committee
heir to one of those
american fortunes
meatpacking
trolley cars
or dry goods
what are dry goods
something that americans make
a lot of money in
no i think mr lewis fortune
comes from cosmetics actually
its old mr stevens
get a cushion quickly
a blanket
the silver
the silver
oh my lord sorry
youll be all right
thank you sir im sorry
what happened
he tripped with the tray
i saw it from the window
this has never happened before
may i telephone the doctor
yes do
im sorry
dont worry
your father feeling better
hes made a full recovery
good
we dont wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again do we
i mean your father collapsing
indeed not my lord
and it could happen anywhere
at any time
the first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight
we are well prepared my lord
im sure you are
what happens within this house
could have
considerable repercussions
on the course that europe takes
it means a great deal
and it means a great deal
to me personally
i had a german friend
karlheinz bremann
we fought on opposite sides
in the war
we always said when it was over
wed sit down and have a drink
like gentlemen
the versailles treaty
made a liar of me
yes a liar stevens
because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that germany was finished
one doesnt do that
to a defeated foe
once your mans on the canvas
it ought to be over
my friend bremann
was ruined by inflation
couldnt get a job
in postwar germany
killed himself
shot himself in a railway carriage
since then ive felt it my duty
to help germany and to give her
a fair chance
so this conference is crucial
and we cant run the risk
of any accidents
theres no question
of your father leaving
youre simply being asked
to reconsider his duties
of course my lord
i understand fully
good
ill leave you to think about it
then stevens
thank you sir
im shorthanded in the dining room
i can use you in the servery
thank you mr stevens sir
smarten up look sharp
good morning
good morning
i mightve known youd be up
and ready for the day
ive been up for two hours
thats not much sleep
its all the sleep i need
ive come to talk to you
talk then
i havent got all morning
ill come straight to the point
do and be done with it
some of us have work
to be getting on with
theres to be a very important
conference in this house next week
people of great stature will be
his lordships guests
we must all put our best foot forward
because of fathers recent accident
it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table
ive waited at table every day
for the last 54 years
it has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays
now heres a revised list
of your duties
look i fell
because of those paving stones
theyre crooked
why dont you get them put right
before someone else falls
you will read the revised list
of your duties
get those stones put right
you dont want those gentlemen of stature
breaking their necks
no indeed i dont
what is it
you have what we can call
a roving commission
in other words you can exercise
your own judgment
within certain limits of course
now here are the mops and
here
are these me mops
right your brushes
and me brushes
and me mops
thats right
what do you want me to do with them
i think you know what to do with them
father look for dust and dirt
if i find any dust or dirt
i go over them with this mop
thats right
now i suggest you start off
with the brasses on the doors
theres that door there
then the door thats open
and then theres this door here
heres your polish
and duster
history could well be made under
this roof over the next few days
each and every one of you
can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion
imagine yourself
the head of a battalion
even if it is only filling
the hotwater bottles
each one has his own
particular duty
or her particular duty
as the cap fits
polished brass brilliant silver
mahogany shining like a mirror
that is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors
to let them know
they are in england
where order and tradition
still prevail
thank you brian
mr lewis the american
has arrived
he was expected tomorrow
what have you done with him
mr lewis has been shown upstairs
my godson cardinal will shortly
become engaged to be married
indeed sir
i offer my congratulations
thank you stevens
i feel very responsible for the boy
he is my godson and his father
was my closest friend as you know
and now that hes gone well
i feel in place of a father to him
ive appointed him as my secretary
at the conference
hes been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare
i realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do
id be glad to be of any assistance
im sorry to bring this up
but i just cant see how on earth
to make it go away
you are familiar with
the facts of life
my lord
the facts of life
birds bees
you are familiar arent you
im afraid i dont quite follow you
let me put my cards on the table
im so busy with this conference
of course you are too
but someone has to tell him
in a way it would be easier for you
less awkward
id find the task rather daunting
im afraid
i might not get to it
before reginalds wedding day
of course this goes far beyond
the call of duty
i shall do my best
id be grateful if youd try
itd be a lot off my mind
theres no need to make a song and
dance of it just convey the facts
god stevens
sorry most sorry sir
but i do have something to convey
to you rather urgently
if i may ill come to the point
perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond
ducks and geese
i dont think so
well perhaps the birds
and the flowers then
or the shrubs the bees
ive not seen any bees
its not the best time to see them
what the bees
what im saying is that
with the arrival of spring
we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change
in the surroundings
im sure thats right im sure the
grounds are not at their best now
i wasnt paying attention
to the glories of nature
because its worrying
dupont divry has arrived in a foul
mood the last thing anyone wants
m dupont divry has arrived
half an hour ago in a foul mood
in that case excuse me
id better go and attend to him
right you are
kind of you to talk to me
not at all ive one or two words
more to convey on the topic of
as you put it most admirably
the glories of nature
but it must wait for another occasion
ill look forward to it
but im more of a fish man
fish
i know all about fish
freshwater and salt
all living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion
excuse me i had no idea that
monsieur dupont divry had arrived
thank you
may i be of assistance sir
oh the butler
i have sore feet so i need a basin
with warm water and salts please
ill arrange that with
the housekeeper sir
warm water and salts
as soon as possible
how do you do but i speak english
good thats lucky for me
im jack lewis the us delegate
could we speak privately soon
yes of course
but i have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in london
i had already seen
the tower of london
ive discovered that things
are not moving
in a direction that i think
you would approve of
german rearmament
is a fact to be accepted
its in our own interest to have a free
and equal germany
not a prostrate nation
upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago
those whove been in germany
can only thrill as i have
to the signs of rebirth
to assist germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery
including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments
and universal military service
for german youth
if we in postwar europe
i need more water
i need another basin to bathe my feet
follow me sir
excuse me
we have to talk
this way sir
my friend i am in agony
too tight shoes i blame myself
vanity
we must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the germans
please come this way gentlemen
butler please could you help me
with my feet shoe
yes of course
take it off
what they said about equality of arms
for germany military service
sorry sir
ill manage
what
your fathers been taken ill sir
where
outside the chinese bedroom sir
germany wants peace as much as we do
she needs peace
here let me help you with that
thank you
thank you charles
take a basin of hot water and salts
to mr divry in the
billiards room is that understood
yes mr stevens
good do it
father
i have more time than you to look
after him ive called the doctor
thank you miss kenton
your fathers not so good im afraid
if he deteriorates call me will you
how old is he 70 72
75 sir
i see
lf he deteriorates let me know
i will sir thank you doctor
more haste less speed
theres something missing
what is it
the spoon from the cruet set sir
good
well observed
now never touch the lip of the glass
good
glass first and then
is everything in hand downstairs
were preparing the last dinner
of the conference
you can imagine the kitchen
but is everything in hand
yes i think were up to scratch
are you feeling any better
theres something i have to tell you
i have so much to do
why dont we talk in the morning
jim
i fell out of love
with your mother
i loved her once
the love went out of me
when i found her carrying on
a good son
proud of you
i hope ive been a good father
i tried me best
you better get down there
or heaven only knows
what theyll be up to
go on
go on
well talk in the morning
on the last day of our conference
permit me to say
how impressed i have been
with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed
goodwill for germany
and with tears in my eyes
i see that everyone here
has recognized
our right to be once again
a strong nation
with my hand on my heart
i declare
that germany needs peace
and desires only peace
peace with england
and peace with france
thank you very much
i too have been impressed
yes deeply impressed
by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference
unlike our american colleague
we in europe know
the horrors of war
and whether we are french
or english or italian or german
our one desire is to never
have to experience them again
indeed
impressed or i may say touched
by the words of goodwill
and friendship i have heard
i promise you that i shall do
my utmost
to change my countrys policy
towards that nation
which was once our foe
but is now
i may venture to say
our friend
ladies and gentlemen
the united states doesnt want war
any more than you do
on the other hand neither do we
want peace at any price
because some prices
you may find
are too outrageously high to pay
but lets not get into that now
we may have to soon enough
for the moment let us raise
our glasses to lord darlington
in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality
lord darlington is a classic
english gentleman of the old school
decent and honorable and wellmeaning
so are all of you all decent
honorable and wellmeaning gentlemen
its a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here
but
now excuse me i must say this
you are all of you amateurs
and international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs
do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming
the days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over
europe has become the arena of
realpolitik the politics of reality
if you like real politics
what you need is not gentlemen
politicians but real ones
you need professionals
or youre headed for disaster
so i propose a toast gentlemen
to the professionals
well ive no wish to enter
into a quarrel
on our last evening together
but let me say this
what you describe as amateurism
is what i think most of us here
still prefer to call honour
miss kenton would like to see you
concerning your father
i suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power
rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world
ive never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of germany
is a complete break from the
tradition of this country thank you
mr stevens im very sorry
your father passed away
four minutes ago
oh i see
im so very sorry
i wish there was something
i could say
will you come up and see him
well im very busy at the moment
in a little while perhaps
in that case will you permit me
to close his eyes
i would be most grateful
thank you
my father would wish me to carry on
i cant let him down
no of course
id really like to continue
our little chat sometime
about nature
youre right i should come back
when everythings burgeoning
yes sir indeed
as i said before my main interest
has always been in fish
when i was small
i kept tropical fish in a tank
i harboured quite a passion for them
ill have another drop of that
if you dont mind
you all right
im perfectly all right
not feeling unwell
no sir a little tired perhaps
wonderful
what a beautiful example of german
culture youve brought to this house
very nice
i hope theres no hard feelings
oh my dear good chap
i like a good clean fight
giving as good as one gets what
i have the greatest respect
for the english i love it here
my family brought us here as kids
so i feel at home
anyway thank you
excuse me
you all right
yes perfect my lord
you coming down
with a cold or something
its been a long day
its been a hard day for both of us
well done
my condolences
it was a stroke a severe stroke
he wouldnt have suffered much pain
thank you for telling me
theres a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room
in need of attention
urgent
his feet
feet
ill take you to him
lf its urgent
it is urgent
the gentleman is in pain
my condolences
thank you that is most kind of you
good afternoon
my name is stevens
im hoping theres a letter for me
ill just check for you sir
james stevens
id like two apples please
there you are mr stevens
you are touring in these parts
im on my way to clevedon
how much is that
thatll be threepence please
and youd be coming from
oxfordshire
whereabouts
sorry
whereabouts in oxfordshire
darlington
that rings a bell wasnt there
a lord darlington some sort
of nazi got us in the war
im the butler there
and my employer
is mr lewis an american gentleman
i didnt know the former owner
your change
i should be glad to meet you at the
sea view hotel opposite the pier
well have such a lot to talk about
and ill have many questions
ex cept for you ive lost touch with
all our friends at darlington hall
but thats no wonder
it was long ago and a lot
has happened in between
who could keep track of all the people
his lordship once employed
my lord you rang
have the young german ladies arrived
theyre outside
id like to say hello to them
practise my german
they do speak excellent english
good well ask them to come in
this is elsa and this is irma
im asking about their journey
it was long my lord
i asked if they like the weather
we are grateful to you my lord
for letting us come here
our parents are very grateful
not at all
miss kenton will look after you
wont you
indeed my lord
welcome to darlington hall
thank you my lord
thank you my lord
will there be anything else
sir geoffrey
good to see you
how do you do
well come in
mr benn
mr stevens
gentlemen if youd like to wait
here for a while
arent you still at stanton lacey
im with sir geoffrey now
you havent changed one bit
ill let you get on
perhaps well meet later
i hope so
but gentlemen you speak of jews
and gypsies negroes and so forth
but one has to regard the racial
laws of the fascists
as a sanitary measure
much overdue in my opinion
imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country
you cannot run a country
without a penal system
here we call them prisons there
they call them concentration camps
is there any meat
of any kind in this soup
i think its mushroom stock sir
mushroom ends and skins
onion and celery no meat at all
cold water and then cook adds sherry
i hear you have a labour fellow
from your constituency
over there theyve got rid of
all that trade union rubbish
believe me no workers strike
in germany
and everyones kept in line
no wonder this country
is going down the drain
it is internally diseased
i think there may be butter
in the croutons do you know
im afraid there may be
youve made a cozy little nest here
seems to me you must be
a wellcontented man
in my philosophy mr benn
a man cannot call himself
wellcontented
until he has done all he can
to be of service to his employer
this assumes that ones employer
is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth
but in moral stature
and in your opinion whats going on
up there has moral stature
i wish i could be sure
but im not
ive heard some very fishy things
very fishy
i hear nothing
listen
thats so touching isnt it
to listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work
its fresh soda
would you be joining us
thank you but its very late
and i have an early start
good night
good night mr stevens
good night miss kenton
goodlooking woman
it was never the same
after she left stanton lacey
i handed in my own notice
six months later
id be lost without her
a firstrate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this
where great affairs are decided
between these walls
good morning
my lord
we do the jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of christ
is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them
though he apparently sprang
from their midst
he embodies the negation of their
whole nature
the jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are
this demonstration of the cleft that
separates us europeans from the jew
is not given in order
to let religious prejudice
with its dangerous bias
settle the matter
but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures
reveals a real gulf
we have some refugee girls
on the staff now i believe
we do
two housemaids elsa and irma
youll have to let them go
im afraid
let them go my lord
its regrettable
but we have no choice
you must see the whole thing
in context
i have the wellbeing
of my guests to consider
may i say
they work extremely well
theyre intelligent polite
and very clean
im sorry but ive looked
into this matter very carefully
there are larger issues at stake
im sorry but there it is
theyre jews
yes my lord
im amazed you can stand
there as if
you were discussing orders
for the larder i cant believe it
elsa and irma are to be dismissed
because theyre jewish
his lordship has decided theres
nothing for you and i to discuss
without work they could be
sent back to germany
it is out of our hands
i tell you if you dismiss my girls
tomorrow it will be wrong
a sin as any sin ever was one
there are many things you and i
dont understand in this world
his lordship understands fully and has
studied the larger issues at stake
concerning say
the nature of jewry
i warn you
if those girls go
i shall leave this house
please
these references
i have to tell you
are quite reserved
why did you leave
your last employment
they didnt want me anymore
why not
i dont know
they just didnt want me anymore
they say she works well
would you please wait outside
shes unsuitable
not at all i want her
shell be under my supervision
shes not suitable
shell do well ill see to it
well then it is entirely
your responsibility
werent you leaving
because of the german girls
im not leaving
ive nowhere to go i have no family
im a coward
yes i am a coward
im frightened of leaving
and thats the truth
all i see out in the world
is loneliness and it frightens me
thats all my high principles
are worth
im ashamed of myself
you mean a great deal to this house
youre extremely important
to this house
am i
now look here
if youre really sure about
this young woman call her back in
miss hull we would like you
to start next week
youre responsible to miss kenton
shell explain the house rules
number one no gentlemen callers
or other such
yes sir
good
welcome
thank you sir
well done
ill show you to your room
id forgotten how much petrol
the daimler uses
its an impractical motor to be
going about the country mister
smith harry smith its a privilege
to have you here in moscombe
its a privilege to be here
your health sir
dr carlisle usually drops in
around now hed enjoy meeting you
hes a gentleman like yourself
i dont know what you call
a gentleman
its a name every man
in this country has a right to
theres harry smith now giving
you an earful of his philosophy
we english
have the advantage and privilege
of expressing our opinions
and voting for parliament
thats what we fought hitler for
have you had much to do
with politics yourself
not directly as such no
particularly in these days
perhaps more so in the early 1930s
and just before the war
my concern was more
international affairs
or foreign policy so to speak
not that i ever held high office
mind you
no any influence i exerted
was in an unofficial capacity
excuse me sir
have you ever met mr churchill
he came to the house occasionally
again in the early 1930s
he was a bloody warmonger
honestly harry we wouldnt have won
the war without him
not content to fight germans
he sent troops in against the miners
what about the war
yes all right
he did well in the war
but he shouldve stepped down
and mr eden
he made a right bugger of suez
yes i met mr eden
yes occasionally
how do you do richard carlisle
rotten luck about your car
but nice to have you
everyone has been most kind
he says he knows foreign affairs
is that so indeed
in an unofficial capacity
he knows mr churchill
and mr eden
really
yes well it was my good fortune
to have consorted
with many men of influence
from europe and from america
mr taylor
i really feel i ought to retire now
because im feeling rather tired
no wonder sir
running out of petrol
then having to hear smiths
political opinions
just step this way sir
im going to stanbury in the
morning ill give you a lift
and we could pick up
a can of petrol on the way
id hate to inconvenience you
not at all would 730 suit you
youll enjoy talking to dr carlisle
watch this step
excuse harry smith
he will go on about his politics
i dont mean hes not right
democracy is why we fought hitler and
we lost a few lads in this village
including our son here
dunkirk
ill get you a blanket
ive left a razor and soap
on the basin
listen to the opinions
of your man in the street
theyre perfectly entitled
to give an opinion
on politics or whatever questions
theyve got no qualifications
of course they have
mr spencer would like
a word with you
my good man
i have a question for you
do you suppose the debt situation
regarding america
factors significantly in the
present low levels of trade
or is this a red herring
and the abandonment of the gold
standard is the cause of the problem
im sorry sir but i am unable
to be of assistance in this matter
oh dear
what a pity
perhaps youd help us
on another matter
do you think
europes currency problem would be
alleviated by an arms agreement
between the french
and the bolsheviks
im sorry sir but im unable
to be of assistance in this matter
very well thatll be all
one moment darlington i have another
question to put to our good man here
my good fellow
do you share our opinion
that m daladiers recent speech
on north africa
was simply a ruse
to scupper the nationalist fringe
of his own domestic party
im sorry sir i am unable
to help in any of these matters
you see our good man here is
unable to assist us in these matters
yet we still go along
with the notion
that this nations decisions
be left to our good man here
and a few millions like him
you may as well ask the mothers
union to organize a war campaign
thank you
thank you sir
you certainly proved your point
qed i think
no not at all
oh yes he has
what did you make of the citizens
of moscombe not a bad bunch
no sir
mr and mrs taylor
were extremely kind
i say i hope you dont
think me very rude
but you arent a manservant
of some sort are you
yes sir i am indeed
in fact im the butler
of darlington hall near oxford
it wasnt my intention
to deceive anyone
dont explain
i can see how it happened
darlington
wasnt there a
lord darlington involved
in that appeasement business
that got us into the war
sorry i never knew
that lord darlington
my employers an american
gentleman mr lewis
lord darlington was among those who
tried to make a deal with hitler
then there was a case after the war
where he sued a newspaper
for libel
the express was it
news chronicle
i couldnt say sir
anyway he lost
he was lucky really not to have
been tried for treason
there it is just ahead
sir i must confess
that i failed to tell
you the truth
i did know lord darlington and i can
declare that he was a truly good man
a gentleman through and through
to whom im proud to have given
my best years of service
that should get you
to the next petrol station
thank you very much sir
im most grateful
but did you
share his opinions
who
lord darlington
i was his butler
i was there to serve him
not to agree or disagree
you trusted him
yes i did completely
but at the end of his life he himself
admitted that hed been mistaken
that hed been too gullible
and hed let himself be taken in
i see
thank you sir
youve been most kind
just keep going straight up here
and turn left at the first crossroads
i say i dont want to be a bore
but im intrigued
where do you stand on all that
if a mistake was to be made wouldnt
you rather have made your own
forgive me for being so inquisitive
not at all sir
in a very small way
i did make my own mistake
but i might have a chance
to set mine right
in fact im on my way
to try and do so now
try the ignition
thank you sir
im most grateful for your help
good luck
its been interesting talking to you
good morning
lord halifax was impressed
with the silver
i told him it was all your doing
sent his compliments well done
ive been meaning to ask you
that business last year
about the jewish maids
i suppose theres no way
of tracing them
that would be difficult i tried
to get them a position in surrey
there was room only for one
and they didnt want to be separated
well try anyway one would like
to do something for them
it was wrong what occurred
im sorry about it very sorry
good morning
good morning
he asked about the jewish girls
elsa and irma
he wondered where they were
he said it was wrong
to dismiss them
i remember you were
as distressed as i was about it
as you were
you thought it was right and proper
that they should be sent packing
now really that is most unfair
of course i was upset
very much so
i dont like that happening here
i wish youd told me it wouldve
helped me to know you felt as i did
why do you always have to hide
what you feel
have you finished the lavender bags
good
all right
i take my hat off to you
that girls come along very well
you were right and i was wrong
look at that smile on your face
what smile
that tells a story in itself
wouldnt you say so
what storys that
shes a pretty girl dont you think
is she
you dont like pretty girls
on the staff ive noticed
might it be that our mr stevens
fears distraction
can it be that mr stevens is flesh
and blood and cannot trust himself
you know what im doing
im placing my thoughts elsewhere
while you chatter away
why is that guilty smile
still on your face
not guilty simply amused
by the nonsense you sometimes talk
it is a guilty smile
you cant bear to look at her
you didnt want her
she was too pretty
you must be right
you always are
charlie
lizzie arent you supposed to be
turning down the beds
well you better get on with it then
have you told her yet
you better get on with it then
what can i say to her
shed never understand
why not
shes old she must be at least 30
perhaps she doesnt feel old
who do you think those flowers
are for shes been picking
come here give us a kiss
flowers
flowers

or are you protecting me
is that what youre doing
would i be shocked
would it ruin my character
let me see it
oh dear
its not scandalous at all
its just a sentimental
old love story
i read these books
any books
to develop my command and knowledge
of the english language
i read to further my education
miss kenton
i really must ask you please
not to disturb the few moments
i have to myself
come in
what is it
im wanting to give you
my notice please

charlie and me were getting married
have you thought about this carefully
yes miss kenton i have
youve been getting on well here and
could have a fine career before you
charlie and mes getting married
charlie and i
i wish i knew what to say to you
ive seen this happen so many times
a young girl rushing into marriage
only to be disappointed in the end
what about money
we dont have any
but who cares
youll find its not easy
to live poor
we have each other
thats all anyone can ever need
very well
if youre so sure
thank you
good luck
we did all we could for them
i told him
i had my eye on him
as a possible underbutler
in a year or so
but no mr charlie knows best
shes sure to be let down
no use crying over spilt milk
besides we have far more
important matters to discuss
next weeks meeting now
must we discuss it tonight
sorry
im tired
ive had a busy day
dont you realize that
im very tired
im very very tired
dont you understand
i owe you an apology
i thought
these quiet evening talks
were useful to our work
but now i see that theyre
a burden to you
i was only saying i was tired tonight
no no youre right
our meetings are a burden
after a long day
perhaps wed better discontinue them
theyre useful
it was only tonight
i thank you for the cocoa
in the future we shall communicate
only during the day
if necessary by written message
i wish you a very good night
i shall be taking my day off tomorrow
ill be back in the house by 930
certainly
certainly
good night
im glad to be out of it
i can tell you
there was something about sir geoffrey
and his black shirts
gave me the creeps
mr stevens says we should
run the house
and leave the rest
where it belongs
you dont agree mr benn
nor do l really
if i dont like something
i want to say stuff it
if youll pardon the expression
miss kenton
but then i suppose im not
a real professional like mr stevens
its mr stevens whole life
well its not mine
and to tell you the truth
i dont want to go back in service
what would you do instead mr benn
toms the name
tom
what employment would you take up
id really like to be on my own
start a little shop somewhere
newspapers and tobacco
or a boarding house in the
west country where i come from
clevedons a good place for
a boarding house
would i get you another shandy
well its almost 930
go on
its your day off isnt it
youre not in the army
due back in the barracks
all right then
good
half a shandy please
what about yourself then sarah
thats a serious sort of a name
they called me sally
when my mum was alive
sally thats nice
is it your intention
to remain in service
its a good profession
when you have a position
mr stevens says were fortunate
were not talking about him
were talking about you
supposing
someone asked if youd like to come
in on a boarding house by the sea
what would you say
well i dont know
its a theoretical question
so i havent given it any thought
mr benn
tom
supposing it wasnt theoretical
sally
its been years since ive been
called that it feels funny
nice though
its very late
will there be anything else
what
thank you good night
good night my lord
mr cardinal good evening
how are you
very well
delighted and your wife
very well too sir
how are you
very well sir
ive gone and got myself in a bit
of a mess with arrangements
would his lordship put me up
ill tell him youre here
i hope theres nothing special tonight
his lordship expects
some gentlemen after dinner
ill keep my head down then
ive got to write my column anyway
youre in time for dinner if you like
i hoped i would be
how is my godfather fit
very well some refreshment
thank you
some whisky would be lovely
whos he expecting tonight
i am unable to help you there
what no idea
no idea at all sir
ill keep my head down all the same
i think its a good idea sir
come in
mr cardinal has just arrived
out of the blue
hell expect his usual room
ill see to it before i leave
youre going out
i am indeed
its thursday
of course id forgotten sorry
is something the matter
some visitors are arriving
but it doesnt involve you
we agreed that thursday
is my day off
but if you need me urgently
no its perfectly all right
thank you
i have something to tell you
my friend
the man im meeting mr benn
mr benn of course yes
he has asked me to marry him
i am thinking about it
i see
hes moving to the west country
next month
im still thinking about it
i thought you should be informed
of the situation
yes thank you
thats most kind of you
i trust youll have
a most pleasant evening
is there something special tonight
are your visitors special
cant tell you my boy
strictly confidential
so i cant sit in on it
on what
whatever it is thats taking place
absolutely not
cant have someone like you sticking
your nose in a journalist
what do you call it a newshound
no it wouldnt do at all
once youve had your food
youd better make yourself scarce
it sounds pretty special to me
good evening prime minister
sorry weve been delayed
i understand
lord halifax
very nice to see you
this is mr fraser
good evening your excellency
please wait here your excellency
ill inform his lordship
we dont intend to involve
the whole british empire in a war
simply because of a quarrel
in a faraway country
between people of whom
we know nothing
to my mind the whole
of czechoslovakia
isnt worth a single
one of our own young men
we have a small noisy
and corrupt war group here
who dont realize that you germans
are marching into your own back yard
the führer is a man of peace
to the depth of his soul
but he wont allow
a small secondrate country
to thumb its nose
at the 1000year german reich
ill get it
come on wake up
stay awake
could you confirm that this lady
is on the staff here
yes of course
shes the housekeeper
thank you sir
may i
of course
sorry to have alarmed you
just security miss
i trust youve had a pleasant evening
well did you have a pleasant evening
yes thank you
good
would you like to know
what took place
i have to return upstairs
there are important events
taking place tonight
when are there not
i accepted his proposal
i accepted mr benns proposal
of marriage
my congratulations
i am prepared to serve out my notice
but if youd release me earlier
id be grateful
mr benn is planning to leave
for the west country in two weeks
ill do my best
now please excuse me
after all the years i have been here
you have nothing else to say
you have my warmest congratulations
youve been a very important figure
for mr benn and me
oh in what way
i tell him all sorts
of things about you
i tell him stories about you
about your habits
about your mannerisms
he finds it very funny
especially when i show him how
you pinch your nose
when you put pepper on your food
that always has us in stitches
does it indeed
well please
excuse me miss kenton
good night
thanks
weve been friends a long time
havent we
i always look forward to a chat
when i come here
would you care to join me in a drink
thats most kind of you
but no thank you
you all right
im perfectly all right
not feeling unwell are you
a little tired perhaps
i bet youre tired
what is it about 100
come on
i want you to sit down
well sir i really
i didnt come here by accident
you know that
i had a tipoff you see
about whats going on now
in the library
i wish youd sit down
im your friend
and youre holding that tray
as if youre about to wander off
now come on
sit down damn it
thats better
now look i dont suppose the prime
minister is in the library is he
prime minister sir
in the library
you dont have to confirm it
are our prime minister our foreign
secretary and the german ambassador
any idea what theyre talking about
im afraid not
tell me stevens
dont you care at all
arent you in the least bit curious
its not my place to be curious
about such matters
not your place
and supposing i told you
that his lordship
is trying to persuade
the prime minister
to enter into a pact with that
bunch of criminals in berlin
im certain his lordship is acting
from the highest and noblest motives
dont you see thats exactly
what makes it so abominable
twisting these high and noble
motives to their own foul ends
you do please realize
that his lordships been the most
valuable pawn that the nazis
have in this country
precisely because he is good
and honourable
if i werent so drunk
i could make you understand
sir
i do understand
his lordship is working
to ensure peace in our time
peace in our time
on their beastly terms
remember that american here
at the conference
called lord darlington an amateur
out of his depth
well he was right
he was dead right
i hardly have to tell you
how i feel towards his lordship
i care about him deeply
and i know you do too
yes i do indeed
then arent you desperate
to see him make this mistake
hes being tricked dont you see
or are you as deluded as he is
oh dear now ive probably
offended you
no not at all sir
not at all
you must excuse me
there are other gentlemen
calling for me sir
you mustnt take anything
i said to heart
i was very foolish a little while ago
i havent taken anything
you said to heart
in fact i can hardly recall
anything you did say
i was just being very foolish
i simply havent time to stand here
with you engaging in idle talk
i suggest you go to bed now
you must be very tired
good night
oh damn it
blast
id been wanting to tell you
its the small alcove outside
the breakfast room
its the new girl of course
but i find it has not
been dusted in some time
ill see to it
thank you
i knew you would have wanted
to be informed
hello sally
hi tom
you all right then
how are you
im good
could we talk for a moment please
just for a moment
well have to be quick
because im going out
it wont take long
all right then
well have to go into the lounge
afternoon
nice little place isnt it
the sort of quiet little
boarding house i had in mind for us
like other things it didnt work out
what did you want to say
i saw catherine yesterday
she had some interesting news
shes expecting
oh my goodness
she wants us both over
for tea on sunday
i could come and get you
we could go together on the bus
yes well well see about that
house is that empty without you
i cant tell you
you cut yourself shaving
oh yeah i know
cant seem to do anything right
these days
i so often think
of the good old days
when i was housekeeper
at darlington hall
those years with you
were the happiest of my life
would you like more tea
yes please thank you
miss kenton
im sorry mrs benn
sorry i was delayed
thats all right
please sit down
ive ordered some fresh tea
lovely
would you like some cake
sure
all right its a special occasion
good
waitress
could we have some cake
yes of course
its been a long time
yes indeed
you havent changed at all
a little perhaps
weve all changed i think
id have known you anywhere
how longs it been
twenty years
yes just over i think
the tea should be along
we read about the suit for libel
its a shame
calling his lordship a traitor
those papers will print anything
they should have lost the case
when his lordship went to court
he sincerely expected
he would get justice
instead the newspaper increased
its circulation and his lordships
good name was destroyed forever
afterwards in his last years well
quite honestly mrs benn
his heart was broken
id take him tea in the library
and hed be sitting there
and he wouldnt even see me
so deep was he in his own thoughts
and hed be talking to himself
as though he was arguing with someone
there was no one of course
no one came to see him anymore
what about his godson
young mr cardinal
mr cardinal was killed in the war
waitress
may i have my bill please
im very sorry
i know you remember darlington hall
in its best days
and thats how his lordship
deserves to be remembered
but perhaps the good days are back
now that mr lewis is here
and mrs lewis is arriving shortly
very fortunate to have you
running the house
we still have problems miss kenton
im sorry mrs benn
we still have staff problems
you mentioned it in your letter
frankly ive been thinking
of going back in service
good
but now the situation
has changed for me
if i take up any work
it will have to be
here in the west country
because catherine our daughter
is expecting a baby
so i would like to be near her
of course
and to be near our grandchild
as he grows up
naturally
or her if its a little girl
when i left darlington hall
all those years ago
i never realized i was really
truly leaving
i believe i thought of it
as simply another ruse
to annoy you
it was a shock to come out here
and find myself actually married
for a long time i was
very unhappy
but then catherine was born
the years went by and one day
i realized i loved my husband
you see there is no one
no one in the world who needs me
as much as he does
but still there are times
when i think i made a terrible
mistake with my life
im sure we all have these thoughts
from time to time
people always cheer when they turn
the lights on in the evening
i wonder why
they do say
that for many people the evenings
the best part of the day
the part they most look forward to
is that so
what do you most look forward to
getting back to darlington hall
principally
and straightening out
our staff problems
you were always able to do that
and you had quite a few
to straighten out as i remember
always was work work
and more work
and will continue to be so
i have no doubt
mr stevens dont you wait
that bus is always late
come in out of the wet
you must take good care of yourself
you too promise me that
oh yes i promise
do all you can to make these years
happy for yourself and your husband
we may never meet again mrs benn
that is why i am being personal
if you will forgive me
thank you mr stevens
oh here it comes
its on time for once
thank you and thank you
so very much for coming
it was so very kind of you
it was so nice to see you
it was a pleasure to see you again
goodbye
take care
you scared me
whered you come from
you like the suit
very good sir
good
watch the chandelier there
youre really getting things
going here this is wonderful
ive had to ask another three girls
from the village to come up
and i can promise you that
the house will be ready
and in shape by the time
mrs lewis arrives
that sounds good
im expecting a possible
new housekeeper this afternoon
a mrs ruth muspratt
excellent references she was matron
at a boys school in sussex
a matron
sounds like shell keep us
from misbehaving
i certainly hope so sir
good
good stevens very good
this is where we had that banquet
back in 35 remember
we all stood up and delivered
ourselves of our principles
god knows what i said
sure got worked up about it though
what did i say anyway
im sorry sir
i was too busy serving
to listen to the speeches
we got a visitor here
be very careful
come here
thats a boy come on
okay easy does it
come on
you dont want to startle it
itll come down
i think if we
leave the window open
good
