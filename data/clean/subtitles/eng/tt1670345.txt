stub from tonights show

yeah
actually 32
who is she
who are you
alma dray from interpol
ill be working the investigation with you
you gotta be kidding me
its bad enough they got me chasing
down david copperfield and friends
now im being saddled with
no offense with interpol
i look forward to working
with you too agent rhodes
im sorry i dont think im gonna
need your help on this okay
wheres the french guy
i already spoke to him
oh you did you spoke
to my witness before me
your witness i thought
you didnt want the case
besides hes useless
oh really why is that
because he believes
their magic was real
oh he believes the magic was real
youre right he probably is useless
is it okay with interpol
if we talk to him too
mmhmm
thank you
i have never stolen a
thing in my life okay
i tried to give the money back
but they wont take it
okay okay okay
lets just say you robbed a bank
i did
fine fantastic you did
but since im new to this
can you explain to me how you went
from las vegas to
paris in three seconds
with the teleportation helmet
okay what the hell
is going on here
he was hypnotized
during the show
i told you hes useless
okay ill deal with you when im
done with this other bullshit
hey
during the show
half the audience was hypnotized
to believe they were
in the philharmonic
i guess that bullshit
was the trigger word
okay hey hey écoutez
etienne come on down from there
youre not in the philharmonic
how do you say stop in french
stop
tell him to stop
no i cant you just have to
let him finish his movement
okay i need a timeout
too many french
people in one room
agent rhodes
huh
im ordered by my bosses
to provide a report
and until we have one
im here like it or not
so we can work together
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions im asking
its up to you
hmm
im not finished
i just flew 12 hours
after what was already a long day
and i do not handle jet lag well
so if you want to see
who can be grumpier
i promise you you will lose
hmm
mmhmm fine so which one of these
idiots do you want to talk to first
him
dylan for the record
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate
okay
that is to say that its not a science
its more for entertainment
all right
just dont believe everything
the guy says thats all
please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there
im really sorry about this
whole tranny tuesday thing
i was out of line
tranny tuesday
well its an arrangement
he and his wife have
or might not have if you believe
everything agent fuller
is saying to be correct
but isnt there a proud tradition in
the fbi of men wearing dresses
no shame agent fuller no shame
im just having fun
was this your card no
see i knew you werent
a queen of hearts lady
and i respect that
the trick usually works better
when im not strapped in here
but i understand protocol
okay okay
so if you had nothing to do with it
then how did the playing
card get into the vault
oh yes that would be
what do the kids call it these days
oh yes thats right magic
just answer the question
okay smartass
all right sorry sorry sorry
you can keep that
dont share it with him
it says here you are a mentalist
hmm
what exactly is mentalism
tricks mostly um some science
targeted guessing might
be a most apt description
along with some intuition
and the occasional
voices in my head
says here you were fairly
famous at one point
mmhmm
you can even hypnotize
people over the phone
some big tours around
the us for a few years
two tv specials
glory days
then your brothermanager disappeared
with all your hardearned money
did your research did you
irs audit back taxes
youve had a long hard slog back into
the limelight havent you mr mckinney
yes indeed it has and i do appreciate
that trip down memory lane
as far as i understand it
when the man from paris
put on the magical helmet
listen to me
if you didnt rob that bank
then you knew about it
which makes you an accomplice
so if you wanna walk out of here today
id suggest you start
now you listen to me unless you think
theres a da in the state of nevada
whod be willing to make
sense of this to a jury
then we have a show to perform
and you agent rhodes
have a drawing board to get back to
is this your first date
what
no i mean obviously you guys
dont know each other well if at all
but like
there is a palpable tension in this room
and before you get involved
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets
and i know the first one is that this
is your first time off the desk isnt it
you should have said something to him
this is a weird way
for you to find out
you are literally begging to
be arrested you know that
if it means you would actually do it
then yeah but you wont
because if you did it means that you
and the fbi and your friends at interpol
actually believe
at an institutional level in magic
the press would have a field day
and wed be even more famous
than we already are
and you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are
well no not you but him right
you have
what we in the business like to call
nothing up your sleeve
and you know it
dont draw him in and then dump him
because abandonment is a big area for him
mommy
daddy
ah you have big daddy issues
okay thats enough
ill tell you what
your average therapist is gonna
charge you 200300 for this sesh
me ill take a tenner
okay later
if youre feeling magnanimous
ill still take a tenner
you wanna know who sat
in that chair before you
mob bosses murderers and thieves
and you know who put them there
the guy whos sitting in this chair
so i warn you
i can maintain my resolve much longer
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance
and the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade
ill be there
i will be all over you like
like white on rice
sorry thats unfair
let me warn you
i want you to follow
because no matter
what you think you might know
we will always be one step three steps
seven steps ahead of you
and just when you
think youre catching up
thats when well
be right behind you
and at no time will you be
anywhere other than
exactly where i want you to be
so come close get all over me
because the closer you think you are
the less youll actually see
im gonna nail you
something wrong
with that soda miss
oh shit
first rule of magic
always be the smartest
guy in the room
boss what are we doing
were letting them go
they all but admitted
theyre gonna do it again
about a half an hour ago
you didnt give a damn about them
what changed
i met them
hey guys
hey i ran a check on the audience
most of it was just filler
people that tressler
dragged in to pack the room
but guess who was sitting there in the back
filming the whole damn thing
i dont know
thaddeus bradley
thaddeus bradley the guy from
tv with the dvds and shows
no
okay well he debunks magicians
he exposes them
he shows you how to do their tricks
get him on the phone
i did youre having lunch
with him in 45  good
mr bradley started as a magician
he was actually quite good
really
one of the best
you dont say
the greatest genius is in
seeing through the illusion
thats a man who loves his work
you sure i cant interest you
in a glass of wine
no no no no thank you sir
were working
i will take one
thats incredible
thats amazing
red dye palmed
is that how jesus did it
thats incredible
im sorry
can i just take a minute here
you were one of the great magicians
why did you stop
do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live
in the last half decade
about 16 million
you know how many dvds i sold
in the same period
five million
right so its about the money
well the money is only there
because the need to know is
greater than the desire to be fooled
like you i detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses
with all due respect
isnt there a cost though to this game
cost
i dont know careers
lives
i assume youre referring
to lionel shrike
im sorry who
lionel shrike
a middling magician who drowned
in the hudson river 30 years ago
on mr bradleys first special
he revealed all of shrikes tricks
the next year
shrike tried to stage a comeback
he was shackled inside a safe
and dropped into the river
but he never resurfaced
you mean he died
i didnt kill him
he killed himself trying to do something
he wasnt prepared to handle
you do realize this is a game
believe me its not a game
it is a game
youre the game
youre being played
and your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust
i mean come on
you got me
if you really want to know
how a bank in paris was robbed
from a stage in las vegas
my special comes out next month
or i could just bring you in
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me
unless of course
what youre trying to say to me is that
you actually dont know how they did it
showmanship and theatrics
when a magician waves
his hand and says
this is where the
magic is happening
the real trick is happening
somewhere else
misdirection a basic concept of magic
not interested in the concepts of magic
i wanna know how they robbed a bank
youre an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank
but dont take my word for it
how about a trip to paris
hermia the teleportation helmet
please darling
youre joking right
you wanna know how
they did it or not
im just gonna put
this on your head
step right up
there you go
now we just pull this
down all safe and snug
make yourself comfortable
there we go
and when youre ready to go to paris
just say the magic word
blow me
thatll suffice
bon voyage
bonjour
i personally prefer to
take the stairs to paris
welcome to the city of light
agent rhodes
hardy har har
what was with the helmet
my fun
what
nothing
oh
so they got a vault set
yes
and its the exact replica
of the little french guys bank
so hes a plant
he was a dupe not a plant
they chose him
they knew which seat he was in
no no no the audience
picked the seat
unless of course
the audience didnt pick the seat
they let them think
they picked the seat
well choose one at random then
actually they were
just palming the ball
with the seat number they wanted
we are looking at row number 5
henley could i please
have a seat number
lucky number 13
could you just confirm that
this is in fact your seat
he was selected
they programmed his mind
to make him go to las vegas
viva las vegas
and then they kept reinforcing it
until he did
they trailed him
they studied him
nothing was left to chance
oh
i got his measurements
he had no idea he
was their target
and they simply activated
him in vegas
when i snap my fingers
and once again merritt mckinney
but how did they know
what bank was his
youre kidding
really
can you be any more
of a condescending ass
yes
like this
theres a very rare
very mysterious way
in which a magician divines
an audience members bank
you ready
yes
credit card
and thats how they got
the signature for the card
they left in the vault in paris
very good
youre being oneupped
agent rhodes
okay but they had to get
the signature card in the vault
you said they didnt steal the money
no i didnt say they didnt steal the
money i said they didnt rob the bank
my guess is that they targeted
a shipment of freshly minted money
headed to the frenchmans bank
onboard an armored truck
which of course
is just as hard to break into
unless youre already inside
and despite what the banks
would have you believe
the men who drive these trucks
are not exactly mental giants
for our horsemen
oh
it was almost too easy
hey boys
so how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault what is that
flash paper
magicians use it all the time
creates no smoke
leaves no residue
oh merde
two days ago no one
heard of these guys
but tonights show sold
out in 35 seconds
i think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business
give your audience 3 million
puts em in a good mood doesnt it
best finale ever
theyre gonna be the
first magicians in history
to get laid
remember if the oxygen
mask comes down
put it on the lawyer first remember
oh yes
i always do its lawyer first
then myself and then the children
then yourself
yes then the children
um allow me to make plain
what weve both been thinking
and whats that
well obviously you have feelings
of affection for daniel
unrequited and misguided
owing to his lack of emotional availability
consequently youre very tightly
how should i put it um
corked
oh i am
now recognizing that you have
physical needs not being met
and strictly in the vein
of helping a sister out
i invite you to think of me
as your own personal corkscrew
wow thanks
let me mull over that offer
of cheap and meaningless sex
cheap and meaningless
maybe but uh
not timeconsuming
we should be getting there
a few minutes early
so sit back relax
we should be in the big easy soon
appreciate you flying with us today
so whats in it for tressler
besides the money
ego
okay pick your card
look at it put it in the deck
and tell me
no dont tell me
okay
okay
thaddeus was there that night
he knows exactly how they pulled it off
what about him
what are you saying
you think they could
be working together
i dont know all i know
is that these guys
were a bunch of street magicians
a year ago with no resources
so how do they go from doing that to
this without some kind of outside help
is this your card
no my card is sitting
over there in that guys lap
nice shuffle
you know this is hard
according to this book
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years
really some of those guys
seriously need to get a life
is it magicians in general
you have a problem with
or specifically those guys
i could care less about
magicians in general
what i hate is people
who exploit other people
exploit them how
try again
um
by taking advantage
of their weaknesses
their need to believe in something
thats unexplainable
in order to make their
lives more bearable
i see it as a strength
my life is happier
when i believe that
is this your card
yeah
yeah
yeah
cool
that smile on your face is it real
maybe
so let me ask you
mr detective man
do you feel exploited
or did you have maybe a tiny
tiny bit of fun
guy goes to the doctor
doctor says sir youre gonna
have to stop masturbating
he says why
he says
so i can finish the examination
oh danny
can i talk to you about
my role in the show real quick
yeah yeah yeah sure
hey guys
we got a show to prepare for
oh
oh do we now
no no no dont do that
youre not doing that
thing to me no

thats marie claire
and she has a lovely
apartment for us
youre welcome
yeah
we got a place
i want two each inside of here
the other 30 around here
roofs alleys balconies
eyes on the horsemen at all times
yes sir
wow 100 years ago william robinson
took the name chung ling soo
and spent his entire life
never speaking english in public
this other guy maximillian
i am not interested in a history
lesson on magic at this moment
if you want to keep playing
into their hands go for it
im just trying to understand
how they think
you think im playing in
their hands do you
i dont know how any of that
is gonna go against this
this what this magic
lionel shrike
in central park
he has a guy pick a card and sign it
then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years
they saw the tree in half
inside the tree encased in glass
is the card with the signature
how did he do that
i have no idea but im sure
theres a logical explanation
excusezmoi
you guys got a guy in that lobby yet
no but i do have some good news
remember how atlas
is such a control freak
hes got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets
what tracking bracelets
he has every member of his crew
wearing a tracking bracelet
those bracelets are on
a sub8 flatband
so as long as atlas is
tracking them  next
our boys can track atlas from right
here in the mobile command unit
okay call me if you
get any movement
copy that
you are missing the
big picture here dylan
there is a place in paris
pont des arts
sometimes in the mornings
i sit on a bench there
and i watch the people make a wish
and lock it in a lock on the bridge
then throw the key into the seine
all day they do this
mothers lovers old men
watching the key sink into the water
and their secret is locked away forever
real and at the same time magical
so
do you really think its possible
theres a fifth horseman
yeah
there is a legend
of a secret order
born in ancient egypt called
the eye
it is said they perfected sleight of hand
to steal food from the pharaohs
and give it to the slaves
their purpose
using magic and illusion
to even the scales of justice
are the horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth
wil i they evade the ru les of law
and logic like they did in las vegas
or will the dark mysticism
of this southern swampland
get the better of them
bravo mr bradley
either you have a ceaseanddesist
which you dont or you should leave
if i want something to cease or desist
it does
take five
according to your potential backers
you stand to make 25 million tops
from your best special
i have here a check
for 35 million
to walk away
to fly away
my jet is at your disposal
lets not kid ourselves mr tressler
youre in this to ride them up
im in it to ride them down
i take it that we do not have a deal
and therein lies our conflict
let me be blunt
my bank account is much
much bigger than yours
and my lawyers are much stronger
and they will manacle you
with so many injunctions
until you stand by hopelessly watching
everything that you own drain away
in front of your greedy little eyes
this isnt the first time
ive been threatened
and im still here
it is however the first time
youve been threatened by me
and if you do anything
to sully my investment
the ride down which you mentioned
will be sudden precipitous
and measurable on the richter scale
oops you shouldnt have done that
according to superstition
one who uses a doll to
enact ones own wrath
is likely to bring that very
wrath unto himself
isnt that funny
and i thought you
didnt believe in magic
do me a favor
visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience
stay out of my head you perv
well no if i stay out of your head
im never gonna get into your pants
right
so lets stick with this exercise
and it helps
pardon the intrusion
i just wanted to wish
you good luck tonight
what so you can try to expose
us later on your little website
and on demand
thats not gonna happen
oh no
operating on a special plane
because of the eye
i heard its a lovely place
lots of starshine and moonbeams
make any magicians wish come true
youve come a long way
much further than anyone
would have expected
of a bunch of wannabes
and hasbeens
if by hasbeen youre referring to me
i just wanna say im flattered
because i always considered myself
a neverwas
do you mind if i do a
quick read on you
by all means
okay im picturing a little boy
he wants to be a great
magician someday
and though hes good
hes not quite good enough
so he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain
feeding off of those who have
the talent that he never did
tell me am i getting close
wait before you go im working
on something new do you have a second
okay name a card
king of hearts
knew it
okay
its up your left sleeve
is it
no no i dont see it up there
you know why dont you check your
unnecessary velveteen pocket there
yeah
anyway thank you so
much for coming by
but this is kind of a
talent only area so
break a leg
hey you break something too
ladies and gentlemen
the savoy management welcomes you
to tonights special performance
the four horsemen act two
unlike traditional performances
the four horsemen encourage you to film
call your friends
upload stream
and tweet the show freely
thank you the show
will begin in a few minutes
nice watch
its a family heirloom
oh by the way
i know how he did that trick
who
shrike
so when he was 14
he saw a hole in a tree in central park
he had a guy who worked
at the carousel
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick
and
at the guys retirement
18 years later
shrike performs has the guy sign a card
and presto
the card is in the tree
it was in the tree for 18 years
the card was in the tree
the tree grew around the card in 18 years
i mean that isnt magic its not magic
the point is the trick
was not to look closely
it was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past
after shrike drowned
they never found the body
what are you suggesting
arthur tressler presents
jack wilder
henley reeves
merritt mckinney
and daniel atlas
the four horsemen
thank you before we begin
wed like to single out
two people in particular
a man and a woman to whom
wed like to dedicate tonights performance
fbi agent dylan rhodes
and the lovely if somewhat inexperienced
interpol agent alma dray everyone
yeah agent rhodes
has personally vowed to nail us
and we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur
what is magic
our argument
nothing but targeted deception
so i want you to look
look as closely as possible
because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected
but we assure you they are
is what follows 100 different tricks
or is it one giant illusion
and now for one of the
oldest tricks in the book
danny if you wouldnt mind
opening up the box
and showing everybody
that its completely empty
now were gonna need
12 courageous volunteers
im gonna take sweet
little fluffy here
and put her inside this mystery box
there are two pencils out there
hold em up high let me see em
here
yeah
and now you will say
the magic word
abracadabra
yes and i will wave this magic wand
for no reason and then
fluffy has magically vanished
before your very eyes
if you havent experienced
mass hypnosis youre about to
and sleep
down down sleep sleep
completely sleep
good good sleep sleep
and now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening
we all know that fluffy is
in fact alive and well
and fluffy has miraculously appeared
as has the mirror
which makes the box only
appear as though its empty
when you hear the word freeze
you are all football players
and your job is to tackle
dismantle
crush
tear limb from limb
the quarterback
now weve all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat
but has anyone heard of
pulling a hat out of a rabbit
you will know who the quarterback is
he will be the one saying that word
freeze
three two one
put your hands in the middle
one two three
kill the quarterback
get on back to your seats
i got a feeling im gonna
be seeing you soon
i guess you have lost some weight
at the intermission
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance
and seal it in an envelope
now its time to take those envelopes out
everyone take em out
now everybody shout out your name
all at once go
shout em out
clement frannick
yeah up here
oh way up there
okay dina robertson

everybody
yeah put your envelopes
to your forehead
focus on your number
ooh oh

weve done it for you
now art i took a guess
north of 140 am i right
thats 140 million by the way
im sorry merritt
how can he be right about his balance
and everyone else be wrong
i think possibly because he
too is wrong
everybody take out your paper
and using the flashlight under your seat
start to warm up that paper
i think your correct
balance begins to appear
now art dont worry
we have a flashlight for you
yes
whoa

70562 now in my account
is it possible that josephas
balance went up
the exact amount that
arts went down
hey check it out
its happening again
is it
wow it is
arts balance has gone
down another 280k
dina robertson
what did yours say
we have a confession to make
shes right
we lied about something
yes none of you were
chosen at random
all of you have one thing in common
everyone in this room was a victim
of the hard times that hit one of
americas most treasured cities
some of you lost your
houses your cars
your businesses
your loved ones
but all of you were insured
by the same company
tressler insurance
you were abandoned
you were loopholed
out of your settlements
this is all for show correct
all meaning were doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience
then yes its for show
whoa whoa
ive got 82000 in
my bank account

no no no
freeze
lower your weapons
what im tracking myself
the horsemen left egg on
the face of what they call
the alphabet agencies calling into question
the efficacy of the fbis task force
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation
special agent dylan rhodes
who was publicly ridiculed
and even tackled at
tonights performance
talk about a fumble
this is quickly becoming
a national story
as the horsemen have now seemingly
pulled off the impossible
for the second time in as many days
two nights ago in vegas the horsemen
seemingly robbed a bank in paris
hey
what are you doing
im having a drink
i came to get you
im worried about you
youre worried about me
well im worried about you
atlas you had him
he didnt have a weapon
i couldnt shoot him
and you know that
yeah but you you let him go
didnt you
a pretty french girl shows up out of
the blue acts like shes my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go
let go of my arm
who exactly are you anyway
i thought you said you
were a desk agent
not bad
what is this
whats the eye of horus
oh certainly nothing
i want to get into tonight
youre dismissive enough
about me when youre sober
find your way back yourself
mr bradley mr tressler would
like you to join him for a drink
sir
thank you
what is your role with them
role
yes you seem to know
everything about them
what theyre gonna do
where theyre gonna be
if it makes you feel any better
this wasnt about you
please tell me why
this was not about me
this is a magic trick mr tressler
played out on a global scale
you sir are the abracadabra
the distraction
while they set up the real trick
i was a 140million distraction
yes
and that very ego that got you
involved with them in the first place
is what keeps you from seeing that
you know
i can destroy you
yes i do know
well you wont
and you wont destroy them
whatever this grand trick is
it was designed a long time ago
and i believe that whats about
to follow is really going to amaze
so i suggest you sit back
and enjoy your front row seat
you paid quite a lot
of good money for it
whatever you stand to make
ill double it
if you expose them now
and destroy them
i stand to make five million
am i flinching
no youre not
hey
im sorry for your arm
no im sorry
i was an asshole i was drunk
im at a loss
you know when merritt said i hardly spent
any time away from the desk he was right
im a researcher
thats what i do best
so whats this all about
supposedly if you buy into it
the eye are the keepers of real magic
and the protectors
of those who practice it
candidates for initiations
must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience
this isnt real
but there are some who think it is
may i
according to this they only
take new people twice a century
so what the horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing
i dont know
i dont know
i mean i guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks
they dont have to put
on a show for that
its probably just a myth
but it doesnt make any sense and i
dont think logic will solve this for us
you dont say
no
i believe that some things
are only discovered
if you take certain leaps
well i gotta get to
yeah yeah
thanks good night
yeah good night
sorry
its all right
if the eye did exist wed have to
assume they were watching us right
shit
i think someone is watching us
but it isnt magic
your fears are correct
this is not and has never been your phone
its a clone in every way except for this
a bug
someone has heard every call
read every text
thats how they were able
to stay ahead of us
god damn it
get me atlas interrogation tape
yes sir i have it on the hard drive
pictures up
okay fast forward
go on go on freeze
okay frame by frame go on
play it through
ah stop zoom in tighter tighter
there thats where
he took my phone
is that thing transmitting
only when youre making a call
or sending a text
plus i removed the bug
all right put it back in
and turn on the phone
they dont know that
we know about the bug
as of this instant
we are ahead of them
we need to keep it that way
understand
find my real phone and track it
already did as of about 20 minutes ago
its in new york city
good
i wanna cut em off at the knees
they got power cut it
they got phones

i want em to feel our presence
and get me an airplane
the firewalls down
do they know about this

whoever were working for
who are we working for
and are we prepared to go to jail for them
stop being paranoid
it really does happen
it happened to you
doesnt mean its gonna happen to us
guys i dont know if
can do this all right
i dont want to go to jail you know
then dont screw up
youre always talking about wanting
to be treated like an adult
now might be a good time
to start acting like one
stick to the plan
stay here and burn it all
i dont know what im doing here
i dont know what you would do
anywhere else
im here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow

lets go leave him
the paper
dylan
lets go lets go come on
today the unfolding
story of a popular
and controversial
group of magicians
who have been fast capturing
the publics imagination
took a dark turn when a police
action that began in chinatown
developed into a dramatic highspeed
chase across the 59th street bridge
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of jack wilder
one of the socalled four horsemen
the whereabouts of the other three
horsemen remain unknown at this time
dylan they just figured out what
the paper was in jacks car
so they know what it is
and why the kid died
trying to protect it
evans is on his way
to brief us right now
lets go
youre gonna wanna
take this first though
whats that
your friend thaddeus bradley
rhodes
you do understand the function
of the magicians assistant
dont you agent rhodes
yeah shes there to distract them
while he sets up the trick
youd be right if you
werent so wrong
while youre watching the magician
that lovely innocent is actually
pulling the strings
dont you find it peculiar that
interpol would send you
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant
why did she request to
be put on the case
she was assigned to the case
oh
luck of the draw
like choosing a random
card in the deck
i find it odd your sudden
act of generosity
whats in it for you
just trying to even the game
i feel like im playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers
keep up agent rhodes keep up
hey
we got a problem
heres the safe
no no no hey
whats he doing here
giving us our first solid lead
weve been investigating a private
security contractor called elkhorn
for the last five years
and
theyve been hiding close
to a half billion dollars
i didnt ask you i asked him
the moneys in a vault inside
a warehouse in queens
we think this vault
is your magicians final target
the magician who
died on the bridge
you pulled our classified elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand
and despite their bullshit
robin hood razzledazzle
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves
how did they get the file
this is the part youre gonna find
particularly interesting agent rhodes
they patched to my server
after they accessed
your mobile command center in new orleans
with codes they got from your phone
you ordered us all out
to chase after them
the level of incompetence
displayed on this case
thats a magic trick in and of itself
abracadabra im taking over
boss hes taking over
lets go gentlemen
hey
hey i want to have a word with you
dont ever talk to me like that again
why the hell did you take this case
what
people say im hard to read
thats an american expression
do you understand it
yes
good then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you
if i find out that you are anything other
than who you say you are i swear
and we french also
have an expression
faith can move mountains
if we hope to capture the horsemen
then you need to have a little faith in me
because ive done nothing
to deserve otherwise
i just got my ass handed to me
i am losing this case
so faith is a luxury
i dont have any time for right now
more than anything in his life
jack wanted to be the most
famous magician who ever lived
and i cant say he achieved it
but i do hope wherever he is
it is full of magic
but the point is sorry
the point is
the point of why we are here
is to say that we are not
we cannot quit now
weve started something
bigger than all of us
we have to finish it
approaching the warehouse
units 5 and 6 cover the
north and south entrances
we are going for the vault
hey wheres the safe
wheres the safe
what is this
where the hell is
the goddamn safe
we just moved it while
you were outside
evans orders
what
i never said that
sir you got a phone call and said
washington wants the safe moved
you never heard that
come out of my mouth agent
what happened you tell me whats
going on because this is bullshit
no
jesus christ

at this moment they think

so we stay with it we follow
it all the way to wheres it going
5 pointz up the street
so we go to 5 pointz
wherever the safe goes we go
itll lead us right to em
you two are with me
guys
look office just called with this
horsemen posted it to youtube
20 minutes ago
the point of why were here
is to say that we are not
we cannot quit now
weve started something bigger
than all of us we have to finish it
remember the name jack wilder
when you see us live
5 pointz queens 700
their show is in a half an hour
its exactly where were headed
i dont know boss
i dont wanna be the naysayer
but these guys are kinda tricky
rhodes theyre entertainers
a stunning turnout here in 5 pointz
as the renegade horsemen taunt
the fbi into a final showdown
the horsemen have invited
us to their final round
of their threeact faceoff
with the fbi
what do they have in store
were about to find out
all eyes on the truck
lets see who approaches
copy that
agents rhodes fuller
go for us
weve got movement
someones walking toward the truck
its a woman
freeze
oh shit
what the hells going on
hey its the guy from the tv
put your guns down
look who it is the fifth horseman
are you kidding
im following them just like you are
im not following anybody anymore
youve been ahead of us this whole time
but guess what
im ahead of you now
your ass is mine
you guys are still idiots
yeah
this happens to be the former
rehearsal space for lionel shrike
its where i did my first show
now if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots
why not open it
and while youre doing it
agent rhodes
would you mind reenacting your look
of absolute befuddlement for me
it will make a wonderful
cover for my dvd
open the safe
go ahead
open it
what the hell
what
give me that no no
what is this
get back
who doesnt love
a good magic trick
they have you chasing
empty safes again
once again misdirection
the show is starting move out
the question id be asking now
agent rhodes is
what happened to the real one
clear clear em out
come on move em out
move em out of the way
fbi give me a path
clear out clear out
what is magic
magic is deception
but deception designed to delight
to entertain to inspire
look out clear clear
look out
it is about belief
faith
trust
without those qualities
magic as an art form
would no longer exist
but what happens if these qualities
are not used for their higher purpose
and instead theyre used to cheat lie
for personal gain or for greed
then its no longer magic
its crime
so tonight for our final act
youre gonna help us
set a few things right
whats going on here rhodes
i dont know
showtime

there they are on the roof
lets move

year of living dangerously

dick

where i was touched
oh you
oh god what are we

completely played and we spend
the next 20 years in jail then
i just want to say that
i know me too
whoa
little too sentimental for me
there they are
go grab em put em down
go go go
grab em

what the hell
ah shit
hello new york
thank you for the magic
and thank you for being such
an incredible and dedicated audience
unfortunately like all good things
it must come to an end
so we would like to
start our show tonight
by saying goodbye
all we wanted was to bring
the world to a magic show
and thereby bring a little magic
back to the world
clear the way
this has been one hell
of a ride for all of us
but its time for us to disappear
good night new york
and thank you for believing in us
stop
freeze
no
god damn it
im sorry
you were right
its bigger than all of us
this is one time im
not happy being right
so i guess this is it
is it
dylan
dylan dylan
hey
you see that
what
wheres the real money
youre under arrest
hands in the air now
ive been framed
im sure you were
yeah but i can prove it
i always do
just like i predicted that
youd play the fool
lets just drop the
theatricality all right
the cameras arent rolling in here
fellas can i have a few minutes
with my friend here alone please
sure
all right
i got information to trade
mmm
i believe thats how its done huh
if its of some value
these bars give a man
time to think
and im pretty sure i
know how they did it
remember the rabbit trick
in the second show
the box was never empty
the room wasnt either
after gaining access
to the warehouse
the horsemen left the real safe
and transformed the whole room
into a giant rabbit box
you go charging in there
thinking the safe was already gone
hey
hey stop
missi ng the trick again
which was to make you think
the safe had already been stolen
so youd drop your guard and leave
now while you were busy
playing with balloon animals
someone was breaking
into the warehouse
who
jack wilder
holy shit
no no way he died right
in front of my eyes
u nless of course he didnt
its locked
werent you listening
nothings ever locked
ah
well done mr wilder
good work
youre a big boy now jack
he escaped in a standard
fbi vehicle right
led you to the bridge
where the other horsemen were waiting
with an identical replacement car
it only took a split second
for you to lose contact with it
and make the switch
oh
when you crawled
into that burning car
quite heroically i might add
you almost died trying to rescue
what i assume was a cadaver
from the morgue
why go through such an
elaborate and dangerous plan
just to frame one guy
i dont know
they never kept any of
the money they took
yeah thats the part i havent
been able to put together yet
but i just gave you information that
is substantially more important
no not really
what
i finally got a chance to
really look into lionel shrike
his comeback attempt his accident
the insurer who denied
the familys claim
tressler insurance
the bank that carried the note
credit republican of paris
credit republicain de paris
what do you make of that
a sucker is born every minute
what if all this was just
leading up to us
getting mugged in
central park at 200 a m
no im telling you
were right where we need to be
we just have to find
that
the lionel shrike tree
and the card encased in glass
what do we do now
oh nice
so heres my new theory
the legend is that the
eye is everywhere
waiting
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves
from the mediocre ones
maybe that was you
deep down inside you
wanted nothing more
than to be part of the eye
but you were never invited
so you try to destroy them
but instead what happens
you pissed them off
the eye isnt real
okay then explain then
whos behind all this
somebody with an obsession
meticulous
who
somebody prepared to
sacrifice everything
somebody so prepared to lose
that they wouldnt even be a suspect
until the trick was done
i dont want a profile i need a name
who who
i dont know who
but they had to have access to
the warehouse to plant the mirrors
always a step ahead of me
and the fbi
got past them not once
not twice but consistently
almost as if they were on the in
the inside
you
mmm
why
that is the question isnt it
youre right
i cant tell you how long ive waited
to see the look on your face
who are you
what do you want from me
what do i want
i want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell
staring at four walls and
wondering how you missed it
how you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead
when you were always
two steps behind
dylan
wait a minute
dylan how did this happen
dylan
why
why
oh my god
i did not see that coming
thats impossible
no way
that was actually pretty good
thank you
when i said always be
the smartest guy in the room
we were in agreement
okay right
henley
ive never seen her speechless
i take that as a huge compliment
hey man im so sorry
or kicking your ass really
hey listen for the record
i have always been a 100 believer
and the amount of energy i have
expended to keep these infidels on point
merritt youre in
god bless
come
the real magic is taking four strong solo
acts and making them all work together
and thats exactly what you did
so welcome
welcome to the eye
it was all connected
credit republican
tressler insurance
bonjour
bonjour
and elkhorn whats the
connection to shrike
elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer
they used cheap steel
they cut corners
when he got to the bottom of the river
the safe warped
and he was trapped
he was your father
the morning before the show
didnt feel like any other day
when my father said
he had to go to work
he could see that i didnt
want him to leave
so he gave me his watch and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back
i have never let his watch stop since then
and from that moment on
i created a persona
i planned i worked out every detail
but the one thing that i
couldnt imagine happening
was you
and i know that the
logical conclusion for you
is to take this case
to its resolution
and for you to turn me in
yeah
but you know how i feel
about resolution and logic
and you also know
that i think some things
are best left unexplained
one more secret to lock away
hmm
come in close
closer
because now you know our secret
we could be anywhere
watching you
were looking for someone
to help us with our next trick
on the count of three
open your eyes
and tell me what you see
