credit union with no security 
but that s fine 
a promise is a promise 
could you please come up to the stage
and we ll rob your bank 
and while he does that   
there is someone here tonight
without whom we would just be
four magicians working the circuit 
trying to get

if not from one of the many  many
companies he puts his name on 
he is our friend  he is our benefactor 
mr  arthur tressler

so we wanted to say 
 thank you

you notice on the sign out front 
we made sure we put
your name on top

ladies and gentlemen 
arthur tressler 
thank you 
and  of course  once again 
the cardinal of clairvoyance 
merritt mckinney 
etienne  what jack
is bringing to the stage now 
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet 
you will need to wear this 
as it will allow you to literally fold
through space and time
to your bank in the   
8th 
  9th arrondissement 
  yeah 
now  once you are there  we will be able
to speak with you through this helmet 
  now if    ah 
  ow 
oh  my god  that s beautiful 
it has the added attraction of being
very stylish 
it s about time the french learned
from america on that subject 
is that a beautiful piece of headgear 
  thank you  thank you   
  it is 
thank you  thank you very much 
mais oui  mais oui 
but before you go anywhere 
could you please  pick a card  any card 
not that card  oh 
no  that s an old american joke 
you can take that one 
okay  this one 
show it to your friends in section b 
but not to us 
okay  great  now if you could
just sign your name there 
  yes 
  in english  if possible 
  that s good 
  thanks 
put it in your pocket 
and now for one tiny detail 
now  etienne  let s step into
this cockamamie contraption 
and i ll step off of it  bonne chance 
it s 11 50 p  m  here in vegas 
that s 8 50 a  m  in paris 
your bank opens in less than 10 minutes 
one

three 
what the fuck 
  wow  etienne

please  please  please 
this is daniel atlas 
can you hear me 
  etienne  are you okay 
  yes

euros  worth 
okay  now  here s what
we re gonna need you to do 
i want you to take the card that
you signed out of your pocket 
and i want you to take the ticket
stub from tonight s show
and i want you to put it right there
in the middle of the money 
now drop it 
now  on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button 
don t press it just yet 
that button activates an air duct
that connects paris to las vegas 
okay  good  now you can press it 
all right  now  etienne  hold on tight 
you might feel a bit of a vacuum 
whoo 
oh  wait a second 
huh 
oh  merde 
thank you  etienne 
thank you  everyone 
we are the four horsemen 
  and good night 
  good night

fbi  hands where i can see them 
let s go  get  em up  come on

  oh  my

boss  please tell me this is a joke 
i just got willy mears

i m a month  two tops 
away from blowing this whole thing open 
  get turkelson 
  he s in atlantic city 
what about cowan  look at him 
he s just sitting there on his ass 
hilarious  rhodes 
i love you 
asshole 
i don t have time for this magic crap 
this crap just pulled three million
euro out of a parisian bank 
  that s how much they got 
  yeah 
actually  3 2 
who is she 
who are you 
alma dray from interpol 
i ll be working the investigation with you 
you gotta be kidding me 
it s bad enough they got me chasing
down david copperfield and friends 
now i m being saddled with 
no offense  with interpol 
i look forward to working
with you  too  agent rhodes 
i m sorry  i don t think i m gonna
need your help on this  okay 
  where s the french guy 
  i already spoke to him 
oh  you did  you spoke
to my witness before me 
your witness  i thought
you didn t want the case 
besides  he s useless 
oh  really  why is that 
because he believes
their magic was real 
oh  he believes the magic was real 
you re right  he probably is useless 
is it okay with interpol
if we talk to him  too 
  mm hmm 
  thank you 
i have never stolen a
thing in my life  okay 
i tried to give the money back 
but they won t take it 
okay  okay  okay 
let s just say you robbed a bank 
i did 
fine  fantastic  you did 
but since i m new to this 
can you explain to me how you went
from las vegas to
paris in three seconds 
with the teleportation helmet 
okay  what the hell
is going on here 
he was hypnotized
during the show 
i told you  he s useless 
okay  i ll deal with you when i m
done with this other bullshit 
hey 
during the show 
half the audience was hypnotized
to believe they were
in the philharmonic 
i guess that  bullshit 
was the trigger word 
okay  hey  hey  écoutez 
etienne  come on down from there 
you re not in the philharmonic 
  how do you say  stop  in french 
  stop 
tell him to stop 
no  i can t  you just have to
let him finish his movement 
okay  i need a time out 
too many french
people in one room 
  agent rhodes 
  huh 
i m ordered by my bosses
to provide a report 
and until we have one 
i m here  like it or not 
so we can work together 
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions i m asking 
it s up to you 
hmm 
i m not finished 
i just flew 12 hours 
after what was already a long day 
and i do not handle jet lag well 
so if you want to see
who can be grumpier 
  i promise you  you will lose 
  hmm 
mm hmm  fine  so which one of these
idiots do you want to talk to first 
him 
dylan  for the record 
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate 
okay 
that is to say  that it s not a science 
it s more for entertainment 
all right 
just don t believe everything
the guy says  that s all 
please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there 
i m really sorry about this
whole tranny tuesday thing 
i was out of line 
tranny tuesday 
well  it s an arrangement
he and his wife have 
or might not have  if you believe
everything agent fuller
is saying to be correct 
but isn t there a proud tradition in
the fbi of men wearing dresses 
no shame  agent fuller  no shame 
i m just having fun 
was this your card  no 
see  i knew you weren t
a queen of hearts lady 
and i respect that 
the trick usually works better
when i m not strapped in here 
but i understand protocol 
okay  okay 
so  if you had nothing to do with it 
then how did the playing
card get into the vault 
oh  yes  that would be   
what do the kids call it these days 
oh  yes  that s right  magic 
just answer the question 
okay  smartass 
all right  sorry  sorry  sorry 
you can keep that 
don t share it with him 
it says here you are a mentalist 
  hmm 
  what exactly is mentalism 
tricks  mostly  um  some science 
targeted guessing might
be a most apt description 
along with some intuition
and the occasional   
voices in my head 
says here you were fairly
famous at one point 
mm hmm 
you can even hypnotize
people over the phone 
some big tours around
the u s  for a few years 
  two tv specials 
  glory days 
then your brother manager disappeared
with all your hard earned money 
did your research  did you 
irs audit  back taxes 
you ve had a long hard slog back into
the limelight  haven t you  mr  mckinney 
yes  indeed  it has  and i do appreciate
that trip down memory lane 
as far as i understand it 
when the man from paris
put on the magical helmet   
listen to me 
if you didn t rob that bank 
then you knew about it 
which makes you an accomplice 
so if you wanna walk out of here today 
i d suggest you start   
now you listen to me  unless you think
there s a d a  in the state of nevada
who d be willing to make
sense of this to a jury 
then we have a show to perform 
and you  agent rhodes 
have a drawing board to get back to 
is this your first date 
what 
no  i mean  obviously  you guys
don t know each other well  if at all 
but  like 
there is a palpable tension in this room 
and before you get involved 
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets 
and i know the first one is that this
is your first time off the desk  isn t it 
you should have said something to him 
this is a weird way
for you to find out 
you are literally begging to
be arrested  you know that 
if it means you would actually do it 
then  yeah  but you won t 
because if you did  it means that you 
and the fbi  and your friends at interpol 
actually believe 
at an institutional level  in magic 
the press would have a field day 
and we d be even more famous
than we already are 
and you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are 
well  no  not you  but him  right 
you have 
what we in the business  like to call 
 nothing up your sleeve   
and you know it 
don t draw him in and then dump him
because abandonment is a big  area  for him 
mommy 
daddy 
ah  you have big daddy issues 
  okay  that s enough 
  i ll tell you what 
your average therapist is gonna
charge you  200  300 for this sesh 
me  i ll take a tenner 
okay  later 
if you re feeling magnanimous   
i ll still take a tenner 
you wanna know who sat
in that chair before you 
mob bosses  murderers  and thieves 
and you know who put them there 
the guy who s sitting in this chair 
so i warn you 
i can maintain my resolve much longer
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance 
and the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade 
i ll be there 
i will be all over you like   
like white on rice 
sorry  that s unfair 
let me warn you 
i want you to follow 
because no matter
what you think you might know 
we will always be one step  three steps 
seven steps ahead of you 
and just when you
think you re catching up 
that s when we ll
be right behind you 
and at no time will you be
anywhere other than
exactly where i want you to be 
so come close  get all over me
because the closer you think you are 
the less you ll actually see 
i m gonna nail you   
something wrong
with that soda  miss 
oh  shit 
first rule of magic 
always be the smartest
guy in the room 
boss  what are we doing 
we re letting them go 
they all but admitted
they re gonna do it again 
about a half an hour ago 
you didn t give a damn about them 
  what changed 
  i met them 
hey  guys 
hey  i ran a check on the audience 
most of it was just filler 
people that tressler
dragged in to pack the room 
but guess who was sitting there in the back 
filming the whole damn thing 
i don t know 
thaddeus bradley 
thaddeus bradley  the guy from
tv with the dvds and shows 
no 
okay  well  he debunks magicians 
he exposes them 
he shows you how to do their tricks 
get him on the phone 
  i did  you re having lunch
with him in 45    good 
mr  bradley started as a magician 
  he was actually quite good 
  really 
  one of the best 
  you don t say 
 the greatest genius is in
seeing through the illusion   
that s a man who loves his work 
you sure i can t interest you
in a glass of wine 
no  no  no  no  thank you  sir 
we re working 
i will take one 
that s incredible 
that s amazing 
red dye  palmed 
is that how jesus did it 
that s incredible 
i m sorry 
can i just take a minute here 
you were one of the great magicians 
why did you stop 
do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live
in the last half decade 
about 1 6 million 
you know how many dvds i sold
in the same period 
five million 
right  so it s about the money 
well  the money is only there
because the need to know is
greater than the desire to be fooled 
like you  i detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses 
with all due respect 
isn t there a cost  though  to this game 
cost 
i don t know  careers 
lives 
i assume you re referring
to lionel shrike 
i m sorry  who 
lionel shrike 
a middling magician who drowned
in the hudson river 30 years ago 
on mr  bradley s first special 
he revealed all of shrike s tricks 
the next year 
shrike tried to stage a comeback 
he was shackled inside a safe 
and dropped into the river 
but he never resurfaced 
you mean he died 
i didn t kill him 
he killed himself trying to do something
he wasn t prepared to handle 
you do realize this is a game 
believe me  it s not a game 
it is a game 
you re the game 
you re being played 
and your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust   
i mean  come on 
you got me 
if you really want to know
how a bank in paris was robbed
from a stage in las vegas 
my special comes out next month 
or i could just bring you in
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me 
unless  of course 
what you re trying to say to me is that
you actually don t know how they did it 
showmanship and theatrics 
when a magician waves
his hand and says 
 this is where the
magic is happening   
the real trick is happening
somewhere else 
misdirection  a basic concept of magic 
not interested in the concepts of magic 
i wanna know how they robbed a bank 
you re an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank 
but don t take my word for it 
how about a trip to paris 
hermia  the teleportation helmet 
please  darling 
you re joking  right 
you wanna know how
they did it or not 
i m just gonna put
this on your head 
step right up 
there you go 
now we just pull this
down all safe and snug 
make yourself comfortable 
there we go 
and when you re ready to go to paris 
just say the magic word 
blow me 
  that ll suffice 
  bon voyage 
bonjour 
i personally prefer to
take the stairs to paris 
welcome to the city of light 
agent rhodes 
hardy har har 
what was with the helmet 
my fun 
what 
  nothing 
  oh 
  so they got a vault set 
  yes 
and it s the exact replica
of the little french guy s bank 
  so he s a plant 
  he was a dupe  not a plant 
they chose him 
they knew which seat he was in 
no  no  no  the audience
picked the seat 
unless  of course 
the audience didn t pick the seat 
they let them think
they picked the seat 
we ll choose one at random then 
actually  they were
just palming the ball
with the seat number they wanted 
we are looking at row number 5 
henley  could i please
have a seat number 
lucky number 13 
could you just confirm that
this is  in fact  your seat 
he was selected 
they programmed his mind
  to make him go to las vegas 
  viva las vegas 
and then they kept reinforcing it 
until he did 
they trailed him 
they studied him 
  nothing was left to chance 
  oh 
i got his measurements 
he had no idea he
was their target 
and they simply activated
him in vegas 
when i snap my fingers   
and once again  merritt mckinney 
but how did they know
what bank was his 
  you re kidding 
  really 
can you be any more
of a condescending ass 
yes 
like this 
there s a very rare 
very mysterious way
in which a magician divines
an audience member s bank 
you ready 
yes 
credit card 
and that s how they got
the signature for the card
they left in the vault in paris 
very good 
you re being one upped 
agent rhodes 
okay  but they had to get
the signature card in the vault 
you said they didn t steal the money 
no  i didn t say they didn t steal the
money  i said they didn t rob the bank 
my guess is that they targeted
a shipment of freshly minted money
headed to the frenchman s bank
on board an armored truck 
which  of course 
is just as hard to break into 
unless you re already inside 
and despite what the banks
would have you believe 
the men who drive these trucks
are not exactly mental giants 
for our horsemen   
  oh 
      it was almost too easy 
hey  boys 
so  how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault  what is that 
flash paper 
magicians use it all the time 
creates no smoke 
leaves no residue 
oh  merde 
two days ago  no one
heard of these guys 
but tonight s show sold
out in 35 seconds 
i think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business 
give your audience  3 million 
puts  em in a good mood  doesn t it 
best finale ever 
they re gonna be the
first magicians in history
to get laid 
remember  if the oxygen
mask comes down 
  put it on the lawyer first  remember 
  oh  yes 
i always do  it s lawyer first 
  then myself and then the children 
  then yourself 
yes  then the children 
um    allow me to make plain
what we ve both been thinking 
and what s that 
well  obviously  you have feelings
of affection for daniel 
unrequited and misguided 
owing to his lack of emotional availability 
consequently  you re very tightly   
how should i put it  um   
corked 
oh  i am 
now  recognizing that you have
physical needs not being met 
and strictly in the vein
of helping a sister out 
i invite you to think of me
as your own personal corkscrew 
wow  thanks 
let me mull over that offer
of cheap and meaningless sex 
cheap and meaningless 
maybe  but  uh 
not time consuming 
we should be getting there
a few minutes early 
so  sit back  relax 
we should be in the big easy soon 
appreciate you flying with us today 
so  what s in it for tressler 
besides the money 
ego 
okay  pick your card 
look at it  put it in the deck 
and tell me 
no  don t tell me 
  okay 
  okay 
thaddeus was there that night 
he knows exactly how they pulled it off 
what about him 
what are you saying 
you think they could
be working together 
i don t know  all i know
is that these guys
were a bunch of street magicians
a year ago with no resources 
so  how do they go from doing that to
this without some kind of outside help 
is this your card 
no  my card is sitting
over there in that guy s lap 
nice shuffle 
you know  this is hard 
according to this book 
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years 
really  some of those guys
seriously need to get a life 
is it magicians  in general 
you have a problem with 
or specifically those guys 
i could care less about
magicians in general 
what i hate is people
who exploit other people 
exploit them how 
  try again 
  um   
by taking advantage
of their weaknesses 
their need to believe in something
that s unexplainable
in order to make their
lives more bearable 
i see it as a strength 
my life is happier
when i believe that 
is this your card 
yeah 
yeah 
  yeah 
  cool 
that smile on your face  is it real 
maybe 
so let me ask you 
mr  detective man 
do you feel exploited 
or did you have maybe a tiny 
tiny bit of fun 
guy goes to the doctor 
doctor says   sir  you re gonna
have to stop masturbating   
he says   why  
he says 
 so i can finish the examination   
oh  danny 
can i talk to you about
  my role in the show real quick 
  yeah  yeah  yeah  sure 
hey  guys 
we got a show to prepare for

when i want to be 
just stay with me  okay 
so  art  you were a tough kid 
you know  kind of a real rapscallion 
you had a dog  a real tough dog 
a brutish breed  like a real   
i want to say  ben the bulldog 
actually  i was a prissy little tot 
i had a fluffy white cat called snuffles 
wow 
ah  sorry 
wait  let me try one 
  i can do way better than that 
  let him do it 
come on  give me one more time 
one more time 
he can do way better than that 
let s do family 
you had an uncle on
your mother s side 
he had a real  kind of   
a real masculine name 
a real  kind of  salt of the earth   
you know  a real stick it to you   
like it was some kind of paul 
thompson  was it a paul   
okay  you know what 
i got nothin  
  nearly though 
  was i 
yeah  my uncle s name was
cushman armitage 
really  snuffles and cushman armitage 
that was your childhood 
i certainly hope tonight s show
is gonna be better than this 
don t worry  just you wait 
hey  come on  give me some good
news on a hotel room  please 
what  are you kidding me 
no  it s mardi gras  dylan 
there s nothing within
sight of the theater 
hold on a second  hold on 
where is this woman 
hey  hey  there you are 
what  the french girl doing a little
sightseeing while she s in new orleans 
no  in fact  here  speaking french
  is actually an asset 
  huh 
do you see that woman up there 
that s marie claire 
and she has a lovely
apartment for us 
you re welcome 
yeah 
we got a place 
i want two each inside of here 
the other 30 around here 
roofs  alleys  balconies 
  eyes on the horsemen at all times 
  yes  sir 
wow  100 years ago  william robinson
took the name chung ling soo
and spent his entire life
never speaking english in public 
this other guy  maximillian   
i am not interested in a history
lesson on magic at this moment 
if you want to keep playing
into their hands  go for it 
i m just trying to understand
how they think 
you think i m playing in
their hands  do you 
i don t know how any of that
is gonna go against this 
this what  this magic 
lionel shrike 
in central park 
he has a guy pick a card and sign it 
then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years 
they saw the tree in half 
inside the tree  encased in glass 
is the card with the signature 
how did he do that 
i have no idea  but i m sure
there s a logical explanation 
excusez moi 
you guys got a guy in that lobby yet 
no  but i do have some good news 
remember how atlas
is such a control freak 
he s got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets 
what tracking bracelets 
he has every member of his crew
wearing a tracking bracelet 
those bracelets are on
a sub 8 flat band 
  so as long as atlas is
tracking them      next 
   our boys can track atlas from right
here in the mobile command unit 
okay  call me if you
get any movement 
copy that 
you are missing the
big picture here  dylan 
there is a place in paris 
pont des arts 
sometimes in the mornings
i sit on a bench there 
and i watch the people make a wish
and lock it in a lock on the bridge 
then throw the key into the seine 
all day they do this 
mothers  lovers  old men 
watching the key sink into the water
and their secret is locked away forever 
real and  at the same time  magical 
so 
do you really think it s possible
there s a fifth horseman 
yeah 
there is a legend
of a secret order
born in ancient egypt called
 the eye   
it is said they perfected sleight of hand
to steal food from the pharaohs
and give it to the slaves 
their purpose 
using magic and illusion
to even the scales of justice 
are the horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth 
wil i they evade the ru les of law
and logic like they did in las vegas 
or will the dark mysticism
of this southern swampland
get the better of them 
bravo  mr  bradley 
either you have a cease and desist 
which you don t  or you should leave 
if i want something to cease or desist 
it does 
take five 
according to your potential backers 
you stand to make 2 5 million tops
from your best special 
i have here a check
for 3 5 million 
to walk away 
to fly away 
my jet is at your disposal 
let s not kid ourselves  mr  tressler 
you re in this to ride them up 
i m in it to ride them down 
i take it that we do not have a deal 
and therein lies our conflict 
let me be blunt 
my bank account is much 
much bigger than yours 
and my lawyers are much stronger 
and they will manacle you
with so many injunctions 
until you stand by  hopelessly watching
everything that you own drain away
in front of your greedy little eyes 
this isn t the first time
i ve been threatened 
and i m still here 
it is  however  the first time
you ve been threatened by me 
and if you do anything
to sully my investment 
the ride down  which you mentioned 
will be sudden  precipitous 
and measurable on the richter scale 
oops  you shouldn t have done that 
according to superstition 
one who uses a doll to
enact one s own wrath 
is likely to bring that very
wrath unto himself 
isn t that funny 
and i thought you
didn t believe in magic 
do me a favor 
visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience 
stay out of my head  you perv 
well  no  if i stay out of your head 
i m never gonna get into your pants 
  right 
  so let s stick with this exercise 
  and it helps   
  pardon the intrusion 
i just wanted to wish
you good luck tonight 
what  so you can try to expose
us later on your little website 
and on demand 
that s not gonna happen 
oh  no 
operating on a special plane
because of the eye 
i heard it s a lovely place 
lots of starshine and moonbeams 
make any magician s wish come true 
you ve come a long way 
much further than anyone
would have expected
of a bunch of wanna bes
and has beens 
if by  has been  you re referring to me 
i just wanna say i m flattered 
because i always considered myself
a never was 
do you mind if i do a
quick read on you 
by all means 
okay  i m picturing a little boy 
he wants to be a great
magician someday 
and though he s good 
he s not quite good enough 
so he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain 
feeding off of those who have
the talent that he never did 
tell me  am i getting close 
wait  before you go  i m working
on something new  do you have a second 
okay  name a card 
  king of hearts 
  knew it 
okay 
it s up your left sleeve 
is it 
no  no  i don t see it up there 
you know  why don t you check your
unnecessary velveteen pocket there 
yeah 
anyway  thank you so
much for coming by 
but this is kind of a
talent only area  so   
break a leg 
hey  you break something  too 
ladies and gentlemen 
the savoy management welcomes you
to tonight s special performance 
the four horsemen  act two 
unlike traditional performances 
the four horsemen encourage you to film 
call your friends 
upload  stream 
and tweet the show freely 
thank you  the show
will begin in a few minutes 
nice watch 
it s a family heirloom 
oh  by the way 
i know how he did that trick 
  who 
  shrike 
so  when he was 14 
he saw a hole in a tree in central park 
he had a guy who worked
at the carousel
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick 
and 
at the guy s retirement 
18 years later 
shrike performs  has the guy sign a card 
and presto 
the card is in the tree 
it was in the tree for 18 years 
the card was in the tree 
the tree grew around the card in 18 years 
i mean  that isn t magic  it s not magic 
the point is  the trick
was not to look closely 
it was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past 
after shrike drowned 
they never found the body 
what are you suggesting 
arthur tressler presents
jack wilder 
henley reeves 
merritt mckinney 
and daniel atlas 
the four horsemen 
thank you  before we begin 
we d like to single out
two people in particular 
a man and a woman to whom
we d like to dedicate tonight s performance 
fbi agent dylan rhodes
and the lovely  if somewhat inexperienced 
interpol agent alma dray  everyone 
yeah  agent rhodes
has personally vowed to  nail us   
and we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur 
what is magic 
our argument 
nothing but targeted deception 
so i want you to look 
look as closely as possible 
because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected 
but we assure you  they are 
is what follows 100 different tricks 
or is it one giant illusion 
and now for one of the
oldest tricks in the book 
danny  if you wouldn t mind
opening up the box 
and showing everybody
that it s completely empty 
now  we re gonna need
12 courageous volunteers 
i m gonna take sweet
little fluffy here 
and put her inside this mystery box 
there are two pencils out there 
hold  em up high  let me see  em 
  here 
  yeah 
and now  you will say
the magic word 
abracadabra 
yes  and i will wave this magic wand
for no reason  and then   
fluffy has magically vanished
before your very eyes 
if you haven t experienced
mass hypnosis  you re about to 
and sleep 
down  down  sleep  sleep 
completely sleep 
good  good  sleep  sleep 
and now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening 
we all know that fluffy is 
in fact  alive and well 
and fluffy has miraculously appeared 
as has the mirror
which makes the box only
appear as though it s empty 
when you hear the word  freeze 
you are all football players 
and your job is to tackle 
dismantle 
crush 
tear limb from limb 
the quarterback 
now  we ve all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat 
but has anyone heard of
pulling a hat out of a rabbit 
you will know who the quarterback is 
he will be the one saying that word 
freeze 
three  two  one   
put your hands in the middle 
one  two  three   
kill the quarterback 
get on back to your seats 
i got a feeling i m gonna
be seeing you soon 
i guess you have lost some weight 
at the intermission 
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance 
and seal it in an envelope 
now it s time to take those envelopes out 
everyone take  em out 
now  everybody  shout out your name 
all at once  go 
shout  em out 
clement  frannick

in your account 
in fact  everybody stand up 
everybody 
yeah  put your envelopes
to your forehead 
focus on your number 
ooh  oh 
this is    oh  dear 
just as i feared 
oh  this is strange 
you know  i hate to say this 
but you re all wrong 
every last one of you is dead wrong
about what you think
is in your account 
okay  you can sit down now 
oh  oh  yeah  i almost forgot 
this evening would not be possible
if it weren t for our great benefactor
arthur tressler 
big applause  big applause

all right  no one leaves
the theater  no one 
there he goes 
now  art  did you fill
out your envelope 
well  no need 
we ve done it for you 
now  art  i took a guess 
north of 140  am i right 
that s 140 million  by the way 
i m sorry  merritt 
how can he be right about his balance
and everyone else be wrong 
i think possibly because he 
too  is wrong 
everybody  take out your paper 
and using the flashlight under your seat 
start to warm up that paper 
i think your correct
balance begins to appear 
now  art  don t worry 
we have a flashlight for you 
yes 
whoa 
  look 
  huh  wow 
what s going on there  daniel 
wait  this is weird

but now   
now it says  70 000 less 
  josepha  can you stand up 
  yes 
now  what is your new number 
 70 562 now in my account 
is it possible that josepha s
balance went up
the exact amount that
art s went down 
hey  check it out 
it s happening again 
is it 
wow  it is 
art s balance has gone
down another 280k 
dina robertson 
what did yours say 
 281 477 
we have a confession to make 
she s right 
we lied about something 
yes  none of you were
chosen at random 
all of you have one thing in common 
everyone in this room was a victim
of the hard times that hit one of
america s most treasured cities 
some of you lost your
houses  your cars 
  your businesses 
  your loved ones 
but all of you were insured
by the same company 
tressler insurance 
you were abandoned 
you were loopholed   
   out of your settlements 
this is all for show  correct 
 all  meaning we re doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience 
  then  yes  it s for show 
  whoa  whoa 
i ve got  82 000 in
my bank account

we could never get our hands on 
ah  yes  security questions 
for instance  like 
i don t know  your mother s maiden
name or the name of your first pet 
where would we get
that information  art 
you certainly would never tell us 
we got confirmation 
it s really happening  they robbed him

hey

he s in the bathroom 
i have him in the bathroom 
no  no  no 
freeze 
lower your weapons 
what  i m tracking myself 
the horsemen left egg on
the face of what they call
the alphabet agencies  calling into question
the efficacy of the fbi s task force
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation 
special agent dylan rhodes 
who was publicly ridiculed 
and even tackled at
tonight s performance 
talk about a fumble 
this is quickly becoming
a national story 
as the horsemen have now seemingly
pulled off the impossible
for the second time in as many days 
two nights ago in vegas  the horsemen
seemingly robbed a bank in paris   
hey 
  what are you doing 
  i m having a drink 
i came to get you 
i m worried about you 
you re worried about me 
well  i m worried about you 
  atlas  you had him 
  he didn t have a weapon 
i couldn t shoot him
and you know that 
yeah  but you    you let him go 
didn t you 
a pretty french girl shows up out of
the blue  acts like she s my partner
  and then she lets the bad guy go 
  let go of my arm 
who exactly are you anyway 
i thought you said you
were a desk agent 
not bad 
what is this 
what s the eye of horus 
oh  certainly nothing
i want to get into tonight 
you re dismissive enough
about me when you re sober 
find your way back yourself 
mr  bradley  mr  tressler would
like you to join him for a drink 
sir 
thank you 
what is your role with them 
role 
yes  you seem to know
everything about them 
what they re gonna do 
where they re gonna be 
if it makes you feel any better 
this wasn t about you 
please tell me why
this was not about me 
this is a magic trick  mr  tressler 
played out on a global scale 
you  sir  are the abracadabra 
the distraction 
while they set up the real trick 
i was a  140 million distraction 
yes 
and that very ego that got you
involved with them in the first place
is what keeps you from seeing that 
  you know   
   i can destroy you   
yes  i do know 
well  you won t 
and you won t destroy them 
whatever this grand trick is 
it was designed a long time ago 
and i believe that what s about
to follow is really going to amaze 
so i suggest you sit back
and enjoy your front row seat 
you paid quite a lot
of good money for it 
whatever you stand to make   
i ll double it 
if you expose them now 
and destroy them 
i stand to make five million 
am i flinching 
no  you re not 
hey 
i m sorry for your arm 
no  i m sorry 
i was an asshole  i was drunk 
i m at a loss 
you know  when merritt said i hardly spent
any time away from the desk  he was right 
i m a researcher 
that s what i do best 
so what s this all about 
supposedly  if you buy into it 
the eye are the keepers of real magic
and the protectors
of those who practice it 
 candidates for initiations
 must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience   
  this isn t real 
  but there are some who think it is 
may i 
according to this  they only
take new people twice a century 
so what  the horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing 
  i don t know 
  i don t know 
i mean  i guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks 
they don t have to put
on a show for that 
it s probably just a myth 
but it doesn t make any sense  and i
don t think logic will solve this for us 
  you don t say 
  no 
i believe that some things
are only discovered
if you take certain leaps 
well  i gotta get to   
yeah  yeah 
  thanks  good night 
  yeah  good night 
  sorry 
  it s all right 
if the eye did exist  we d have to
assume they were watching us  right 
shit 
i think someone is watching us 
but it isn t magic 
your fears are correct 
this is not and has never been your phone 
it s a clone in every way  except for this 
a bug 
someone has heard every call 
read every text 
that s how they were able
to stay ahead of us 
god damn it 
get me atlas  interrogation tape 
yes  sir  i have it on the hard drive 
picture s up 
okay  fast forward 
go on  go on  freeze 
okay  frame by frame  go on 
play it through 
ah  stop  zoom in tighter  tighter 
there  that s where
he took my phone 
is that thing transmitting 
only when you re making a call
or sending a text 
plus i removed the bug 
all right  put it back in
and turn on the phone 
they don t know that
we know about the bug 
as of this instant 
we are ahead of them 
we need to keep it that way 
understand

  the paper 
  dylan 
let s go  let s go  come on 
today  the unfolding
story of a popular
and controversial
group of magicians 
who have been fast capturing
the public s imagination 
took a dark turn when a police
action that began in chinatown
developed into a dramatic  high speed
chase across the 59th street bridge 
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of jack wilder 
one of the so called four horsemen 
the whereabouts of the other three
horsemen remain unknown at this time 
dylan  they just figured out what
the paper was in jack s car 
so they know what it is 
and why the kid died
trying to protect it 
evans is on his way
to brief us right now 
let s go 
you re gonna wanna
take this first  though 
what s that 
your friend thaddeus bradley 
rhodes 
you do understand the function
of the magician s assistant 
don t you  agent rhodes 
yeah  she s there to distract them
while he sets up the trick 
you d be right if you
weren t so wrong 
while you re watching the magician 
that lovely innocent is actually
pulling the strings 
don t you find it peculiar that
interpol would send you
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant 
why did she request to
be put on the case 
  she was assigned to the case 
  oh 
luck of the draw 
like choosing a random
card in the deck 
i find it odd  your sudden
act of generosity 
what s in it for you 
just trying to even the game 
i feel like i m playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers 
keep up  agent rhodes  keep up 
hey 
we got a problem 
here s the safe 
no  no  no  hey 
what s he doing here 
giving us our first solid lead 
we ve been investigating a private
security contractor called elkhorn
  for the last five years 
  and 
they ve been hiding close
to a half billion dollars   
i didn t ask you  i asked him 
the money s in a vault inside
a warehouse in queens 
we think this vault
is your magicians  final target 
the magician who
died on the bridge   
you pulled our classified elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand 
and despite their bullshit
robin hood razzle dazzle 
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves 
how did they get the file 
this is the part you re gonna find
particularly interesting  agent rhodes 
they patched to my server
after they accessed
your mobile command center in new orleans
with codes they got from your phone 
you ordered us all out
to chase after them 
the level of incompetence
displayed on this case 
that s a magic trick in and of itself 
abracadabra  i m taking over 
boss  he s taking over 
let s go  gentlemen 
hey 
hey  i want to have a word with you 
don t ever talk to me like that again 
  why the hell did you take this case 
  what 
people say i m  hard to read   
that s an american expression 
do you understand it 
yes 
good  then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you 
if i find out that you are anything other
than who you say you are  i swear   
and we french also
have an expression 
 faith can move mountains   
if we hope to capture the horsemen 
then you need to have a little faith in me 
because i ve done nothing
to deserve otherwise 
i just got my ass handed to me 
i am losing this case 
so faith is a luxury
i don t have any time for right now 
more than anything in his life 
jack wanted to be the most
famous magician who ever lived 
and i can t say he achieved it 
but i do hope wherever he is 
it is full of magic 
but the point is    sorry 
the point is   
the point of why we are here
is to say that we are not   
we cannot quit now 
we ve started something
bigger than all of us 
we have to finish it 
approaching the warehouse 
units 5 and 6 cover the
north and south entrances 
we are going for the vault 
hey  where s the safe 
where s the safe 
what is this 
where the hell is
the goddamn safe 
we just moved it while
you were outside 
  evans  orders 
  what 
i never said that 
sir  you got a phone call and said
washington wants the safe moved 
you never heard that
come out of my mouth  agent 
what happened  you tell me what s
going on  because this is bullshit 
no 
jesus christ 
sir  sir  what are you doing 
i think it s beethoven s
concerto in d major 
  where s the safe 
  his team is loading the truck 
  hey  hey 
  hey 
  stop the truck 
  stop 
  stop 
  hey  stop that truck 
what the hell s going on 
we got our orders 
now you ve got new orders  open it up 
okay  here s what i want 
at this moment  they think
that safe s leaving this site 
so we stay with it  we follow
it all the way to    where s it going 
5 pointz  up the street 
so we go to 5 pointz 
wherever the safe goes  we go 
it ll lead us right to  em 
you two are with me 
guys   
look  office just called with this 
horsemen posted it to youtube
20 minutes ago 
the point of why we re here
is to say that we are not   
we cannot quit now 
we ve started something bigger
than all of us  we have to finish it 
remember the name jack wilder
when you see us live 
5 pointz  queens  7 00 
their show is in a half an hour 
it s exactly where we re headed 
i don t know  boss 
i don t wanna be the naysayer 
but these guys are kinda tricky 
rhodes  they re entertainers 
a stunning turnout here in 5 pointz
as the renegade horsemen taunt
the fbi into a final showdown 
the horsemen have invited
us to their final round
of their three act face off
with the fbi 
what do they have in store 
we re about to find out 
all eyes on the truck 
let s see who approaches 
copy that 
agents rhodes  fuller 
go  for us 
we ve got movement 
someone s walking toward the truck 
it s a woman 
  freeze 
  oh  shit 
what the hell s going on 
hey  it s the guy from the tv 
put your guns down 
look who it is  the fifth horseman 
are you kidding 
i m following them  just like you are 
i m not following anybody anymore 
you ve been ahead of us this whole time 
but guess what 
i m ahead of you now 
your ass is mine 
you guys are still idiots 
  yeah 
  this happens to be the former
rehearsal space for lionel shrike 
it s where i did my first show 
now  if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots 
why not open it 
and while you re doing it 
agent rhodes 
would you mind reenacting your look
of absolute befuddlement for me 
it will make a wonderful
cover for my dvd 
open the safe 
  go ahead 
  open it 
what the hell 
what 
give me that  no  no 
what is this 
get back 
who doesn t love
a good magic trick 
they have you chasing
empty safes again 
once again  misdirection 
the show is starting  move out 
the question i d be asking now 
agent rhodes is   
 what happened to the real one  
clear  clear  em out 
come on  move  em out 
move  em out of the way 
fbi  give me a path 
clear out  clear out 
what is magic 
magic is deception 
but deception designed to delight 
to entertain  to inspire 
look out  clear  clear 
look out 
it is about belief 
faith 
trust 
without those qualities 
magic  as an art form 
would no longer exist 
but what happens if these qualities
are not used for their higher purpose 
and instead they re used to cheat  lie 
for personal gain or for greed 
then it s no longer magic 
it s crime 
so tonight  for our final act 
you re gonna help us
set a few things right 
what s going on here  rhodes 
i don t know 
showtime 
look 
there they are on the roof
let s move 
go  go  go 
  dylan 
  fbi  coming through 
what are you doing here 
they re going in the wrong direction
and you know it 
rhodes  i need all personnel now 
you need to trust me 
take your leap of faith 
wait 
i m going to go with her 
go  i got your back 
i ll be right here 
go ahead 
that s on you  fuller 
let s go  let s go  now  now  now 
daniel 
  yeah 
  uh   
as our  let s call it 
year of living dangerously
comes to a close 
in a rare moment of vulnerability 
i d like to express a sentiment
to you about our relationship 
okay 
well  when i first met you 
i thought you were kind of a
  dick 
  oh 
and 
no  that s it 
that s very nice 
  yeah 
  i m touched 
yeah  just from the heart 
well  i didn t tell you
where i was touched 
oh  you 
oh  god  what are we
gonna do when this is over 
we re on our own  our instructions
run out after the show 
even if there is no  eye   if we were
completely played and we spend
the next 20 years in jail  then 
i just want to say that   
i know  me  too 
whoa 
little too sentimental for me 
there they are 
go grab  em  put  em down 
go  go  go 
grab  em 
get up 
what the hell 
ah  shit 
hello  new york 
thank you for the magic 
and thank you for being such
an incredible and dedicated audience 
unfortunately  like all good things 
it must come to an end 
so we would like to
start our show tonight   
by saying goodbye 
all we wanted was to bring
the world to a magic show 
and thereby bring a little magic
back to the world 
clear the way 
this has been one hell
of a ride for all of us 
but it s time for us to disappear 
good night  new york 
and thank you for believing in us 
stop 
freeze 
no 
god damn it 
i m sorry 
you were right 
it s bigger than all of us 
this is one time i m
not happy being right 
so i guess this is it 
is it 
dylan 
dylan  dylan 
hey 
  you see that 
  what 
where s the real money 
you re under arrest 
hands in the air  now 
i ve been framed 
  i m sure you were 
  yeah  but i can prove it 
i always do 
just like i predicted that
you d play the fool 
let s just drop the
theatricality  all right 
the cameras aren t rolling in here 
fellas  can i have a few minutes
with my friend here alone  please 
sure 
all right 
  i got information to trade 
  mmm 
i believe that s how it s done  huh 
if it s of some value 
these bars give a man
time to think 
and i m pretty sure i
know how they did it 
remember the rabbit trick
in the second show 
the box was never empty 
the room wasn t either 
after gaining access
to the warehouse 
the horsemen left the real safe
and transformed the whole room
into a giant rabbit box 
you go charging in there 
thinking the safe was already gone 
hey 
hey  stop 
missi ng the trick  again 
which was to make you think
the safe had already been stolen 
so you d drop your guard and leave 
now  while you were busy
playing with balloon animals 
someone was breaking
into the warehouse 
who 
jack wilder 
holy shit 
no  no way  he died right
in front of my eyes 
u nless  of course  he didn t 
it s locked 
weren t you listening 
nothing s ever locked 
ah 
well done  mr  wilder 
good work 
you re a big boy now  jack 
he escaped in a standard
fbi vehicle  right 
led you to the bridge 
where the other horsemen were waiting
with an identical replacement car 
it only took a split second
for you to lose contact with it
and make the switch 
oh 
when you crawled
into that burning car 
quite heroically  i might add 
you almost died trying to rescue
what i assume was a cadaver
from the morgue 
why go through such an
elaborate and dangerous plan
  just to frame one guy 
  i don t know 
they never kept any of
the money they took 
yeah  that s the part i haven t
been able to put together yet 
but i just gave you information that
is substantially more important 
  no  not really 
  what 
i finally got a chance to
really look into lionel shrike 
his comeback attempt  his accident 
the insurer who denied
the family s claim 
tressler insurance 
the bank that carried the note 
credit republican of paris 
credit republicain de paris 
what do you make of that 
a sucker is born every minute 
what if all this was just
leading up to us
getting mugged in
central park at 2 00 a  m  
no  i m telling you 
we re right where we need to be 
  we just have to find   
  that 
the lionel shrike tree 
and the card encased in glass 
what do we do now 
oh  nice 
so  here s my new theory 
the legend is that the
 eye  is everywhere 
waiting
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves
from the mediocre ones 
maybe that was you 
deep down inside you
wanted nothing more
than to be part of the  eye  
but you were never invited 
so you try to destroy them 
but instead what happens 
you pissed them off 
the eye isn t real 
okay  then  explain then 
who s behind all this 
somebody with an obsession 
  meticulous 
  who 
somebody prepared to
sacrifice everything 
somebody so prepared to lose
that they wouldn t even be a suspect
until the trick was done 
i don t want a profile  i need a name 
who  who 
i don t know who 
but they had to have access to
the warehouse to plant the mirrors 
always a step ahead of me 
and the fbi 
got past them not once 
not twice  but consistently 
almost as if they were on the in   
the inside 
  you 
  mmm 
why 
that is the question  isn t it 
you re right 
i can t tell you how long i ve waited
to see the look on your face 
who are you 
what do you want from me 
what do i want 
i want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell 
staring at four walls and
wondering how you missed it 
how you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead
when you were always
two steps behind 
dylan 
wait a minute 
dylan  how did this happen 
dylan 
why 
why 
oh  my god 
i did not see that coming 
that s impossible 
no way 
that was actually pretty good 
thank you 
when i said   always be
the smartest guy in the room   
we were in agreement 
okay  right 
henley 
i ve never seen her speechless 
i take that as a huge compliment 
hey  man  i m so sorry
or kicking your ass  really 
hey  listen  for the record 
i have always been a 100  believer 
and the amount of energy i have
expended to keep these infidels on point   
merritt  you re in 
god bless 
come 
the real magic is taking four strong solo
acts and making them all work together 
and that s exactly what you did 
so welcome 
welcome to the eye 
it was all connected 
credit republican 
tressler insurance 
bonjour 
bonjour 
and elkhorn  what s the
connection to shrike 
elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer 
they used cheap steel 
they cut corners 
when he got to the bottom of the river 
the safe warped 
and he was trapped 
he was your father 
the morning before the show
didn t feel like any other day 
when my father said
he had to go to work 
he could see that i didn t
want him to leave 
so he gave me his watch  and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back 
i have never let his watch stop since then 
and from that moment on 
i created a persona 
i planned  i worked out every detail 
but the one thing that i
couldn t imagine happening
was you 
and i know that the
logical conclusion for you
is to take this case
to its resolution 
and for you to turn me in 
yeah 
but you know how i feel
about resolution and logic 
and you also know
that i think some things
are best left unexplained 
one more secret to lock away 
hmm 
come in close 
closer 
because now you know our secret 
we could be anywhere 
watching you 
we re looking for someone
to help us with our next trick 
on the count of three 
open your eyes
and tell me what you see 
one 
two   
please  stop  stop  stop 
all right  stop the van  stop the van 
i m gonna jump out of the van 
oh  thank god 
where are we 
great  another shit hole 
okay  feeling it 
i m exhausted  and hungry 
and cranky 
check out this place 
where d you bring us 
was there no landfill
where we were 
this place is awesome 
  is this our new gear 
  there d better not be  like 
matching jumpsuits in there 
you know i don t wear spandex 
it s locked
