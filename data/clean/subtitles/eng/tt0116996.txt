 cause you re cooking a feast 
i can smell it from the interstate 
what is that  barbecue 
yeah  but it not coming from here 
what is that noise 
what is your take on this  jerry 
the people will love it  mr  president 
our conflict is whether we ambush
the 6 00 news or hold out for prime time 
screw the press 
this is a need to know situation 
we should make it top secret 
and should move in with defcon four 
we can t sit on this 
general casey  do you have an opinion 
well  sir   
   do we know they are hostile 
what do you mean 
they have the planet surrounded
by thousands of warships 
do we know they re warships 
professor  what do we know about them 
they re very advanced technologically 
which suggests  rightfully so 
that they re peaceful 
an advanced civilization is 
by definition  not barbaric 
mr  president   
   this is a great day 
i and all my colleagues   
   are extremely excited 
good 
extraterrestrial life 
you re right  jerry 
the people are going to love it 
this is a momentous occasion 
mr  president  
we ll go all media on this 
i ll wear my cerruti suit 
i ll need a good speech 
statesman like   
   historical and yet   
   warm  neighborly 
abraham lincoln meets
leave it to beaver  kind of thing 
are they too old fashioned 
no  i don t think so 
this has got the colors but  no 
i don t think so 
not vivid enough 
nancy had this in the library 
yes  indeed 
i don t think so 
i thought perhaps the watered silk 
this week it s on sale 
i hardly think i need worry about that 
my husband is the leader of the free world 
what do you think 
why don t you leave the roosevelt room
the way the roosevelts wanted it 
because eleanor roosevelt was
too fond of chintz  that s why 
mother  this isn t your house 
lf you re going to be a pest  i ll ignore you 
mrs  dale

lf i d known you d turn into a crook

   without knowing how to dally
around a few curves  well   
   you know nothing
of the gambling industry 
the galaxy s going to be
the best hotel in vegas

   quote    factually challenged    
yeah  stone  speak 
jason  hi  it s me 
you wearing a bra 
listen  this is big  president dale
is cutting into my show today 
that s absurd  why would he stoop
to being on   today in fashion   
he s interrupting everybody 
i don t know  it s some sort of
an emergency announcement 
this doesn t make sense 
he should talk to us 
white house is coming out live 
good evening  my fellow americans 
i apologize for interrupting
your regular programs   
   but i have a very important
announcement to make 
many important things have happened
to me in my life 
my graduation from princeton   
   the day that marsha said
she would be my wife   
   the birth of our daughter taffy 
thanks  dad 
and the news that i have heard today
ranks right up there 
a powerful memory is in the making 
not just for me   
   but for all mankind 
today   
   an extraordinary discovery
was made by the hubble telescope 
the data from the hubble was decoded   
   then analyzed by the most
powerful computers at mit 
the images are undeniable 
we are entering the dawn of a new era 
frame enlargements provide
an astonishing sight 
a fleet of vehicles 
which can best be described as   
   flying saucers 
come on  come on 
papa needs a new pair of shoes 
hey  am i the only one
shooting craps here 
we hope we will have the chance
to meet with them 
this is the perfect summation
to the 20th century    
martians 
this is great 
please  come to earth  please 
we need you 
i got people coming in 
everybody wants to be part of this 
galaxy s going to be world class 
and soon   
   we will become one solar system 
what the hell s he talking about 
these flying saucers
have come from mars   
   and at their current course and speed   
   will enter earth s orbit in 16 hours 
i ve been thinking about martians
when there weren t any 
it is profoundly moving to know
there is intelligent life out there 
glad it s somewhere 
our world
will never feel quite the same again 
good night   
   and god bless you all 
this   
   is intense 
shut up  poppy  shut up

the professor from the white house 
kessler 
donald kessler

you know  the science guy 
this is nuts  this is    
we should have got that guy 
your people are too slow

or buster douglas for the same money 
you better get moving 
you re on in five minutes 
this show s going to get a great rating 
it s all yours 
ln certain circumstances the proposition
that two and two equals five   
   is entirely legitimate 
call me nathalie 
and you  do please call me donald 
i admire your show 
really  you like my work 
yes  very much 
why    
thank you 
coming out of commercial 
in five   four   
   three   two    
welcome back 
we re with professor donald kessler 
he s the chairman
of the american academy   
   of astronautics 
professor   
   isn t it weird that we sent
a space probe to mars   
   and we didn t even find anyone 
well  not really   
   nathalie 
we didn t get into the canals 
the martian canals are canyons 
some are over 100 miles deep 
the martian civilization has clearly
developed under the planet s surface 
their science and technology
must be absolutely mind boggling 
so   
   what in your view  donald   
   kessler   
   chairman  are some of the things
the martians can teach us  professor 
quite a lot about mars  nathalie 
she s flirting 
but seriously 
this is tremendously exciting 
the knowledge  the new ideas 
it ll change everything 
and we must be open to it 
maybe they can tell us about our universe 
how it started 
where it s going 
perhaps even its purpose 
it s tremendously exciting 
it s the most important event since   
   jesus walked in galilee  
christ 
what s wrong 
go to camera two 
i can t  it s busted 
go to one  go to four 
he copped a feel 
now what 
what s that 
so that s a martian 
that s a martian 
oh  my god 
yikes 
i m not having that thing in my house 
sweetie   
   we may have to 
the people expect me to meet them 
they re not eating off the van buren china 
look at that brain 
he must be real smart 
it s gross 
don t forget  nathalie   
   that we will look equally gross to him 
he made the international sign
of the doughnut 
from the limited information available 
i ve made three extrapolations  one 
our martian friend
is a carbon based life form 
two  he breathes nitrogen 
and three 
the large cerebrum here  indicates   
   telepathic potential 
you mean they can   
   read our thoughts 
potentially  yes 
what about their intentions 
are they friendly people 
logic dictates that given
their high level of technical development   
   they re an advanced culture 
therefore  peaceful and enlightened 
the human race  on the other hand   
   is an aggressively dangerous species 
now i suspect they have
more to fear from us   
   than we from them 
doctor 
thank you 
for many years 
i ve been refining a translating computer 
the results are not perfect  but this   
   may answer some of your questions 
green skin   
   800 centuries ago 
their bodily fluids   
   include the birth of half breeds 
how many centuries did he say 
eight hundred  sir 
self determination of the cosmos 
for dark is the suede that   
   mows   
   like a harvest 
what the hell does that mean

there s a tour in progress 
hello  my name is barbara 
hello  barbara 
i am an alcoholic 
but i haven t had a drink in three months 
i m feeling so optimistic
because of the martians 
we re not alone in the universe 
and it s so perfect   
   that it s happening at the beginning
of the new millennium 
our planet was suffering   
   with the ozone and the rain forest and   
   so many people unhappy in their lives 
and then   
   the martians heard
our global karmic cry for help 
people say they re ugly   
   but i think they ve come
to show us the way 
i think they ve come to save us 
thank you 
bye bye 
you be careful  don t get yourself killed

of common interest to discuss 
there is a unilateral  concerted 
diplomatic effort being made 
jason 
thanks 
lf the martians land 
can the press do interviews 
well  that depends

they re sending coordinates

we need a welcome mat  not tanks

you re right 
 thank you  sir 
 this situation needs to be supervised 
absolutely  sir 
general casey   
   can you handle it 
i d be proud 
good  but keep a lid on it 
key media  good cross section of guests 
we don t want it to turn
into a zoo out there

liberals  intellectuals   
   peacemongers  idiots 
would you please keep it down 
people live here 
general casey

   good things were bound to happen 
i want the martians to be treated
like foreign dignitaries 
i want your men alert and majestic   
   with a snap in their step

positively positive 
we don t want any slip ups 
no  no  no  no  not at all 
poppy  all these people 
all of them here to see you 
there s jason  poppy 
okay  let s go 
the teeming masses have gathered
from who knows how many states   
   waiting and watching 
why have they come 
curiosity  or is it something more 
or simply to say   i was there  
 i was there   
    when first man   
    met martian  
jason stone   
   gnn   
   pahrump 
some room 
give them room 
it is an awesome sight 
the giant spacecraft glinting   
   in the nevada sun like a   
   giant   
   hubcap 
something s happening 
the doorway   
   is opening 
a silver ramp   
   is coming out   
   like a giant tongue 
gee whiz 
martians 
funny little critters 
well 
wait 
greetings 
i am the martian ambassador 
everything is fixed now  you may speak 
greetings 
i am general casey   
   commanding officer of the armed
forces of the united states of america 
on behalf of the people of earth 
welcome 
he did that well 
we come in peace 
we come in peace  we come in peace 
they came in peace 
we come in peace 
open fire 
what 
die  you alien shithead 
i surrender 
no  it ain t happening  it didn t happen 
holy mother of god 
did you see that 
we should hit these assholes
with everything we ve got  sir 
sir  mr  president 
i know this seems terrible   
   but let s not be too rash 
we should nuke them 
we must establish
a line of communication first 
set up a town hall 
we ll get the public s opinion 
what do you think 
kick the crap out of them 
ladies and gentlemen   
   it may be a cultural misunderstanding 
maybe to them  doves mean war 
we all saw how they reacted to that dove 
it frightened them 
he did say that   
     we come in peace   
the new computer s ready 
okay  let s do it 
i know we re making the right decision 
ready to transmit 
this is the president of the united states 
i m speaking in the hope   
   that what happened earlier today
in the nevada desert   
   was a cultural misunderstanding 
there can be no doubt
that we two peoples   
   have a great deal to offer one another 
you must be as excited as we   
   to find intelligent life in the solar system 
let me make it clear 
you have nothing   
   to fear from us 
our customs may be strange to you   
   but we mean no harm 
when the investors fly in   
   i would like for them each to be   
   met by a limo 
top of the line cars   
   leather interiors   
   corinthian  if they got it 
are you still spinning your wheels
on that cockamamie hotel 
hello 
the martians have attacked 
this was no misunderstanding 
i was there  i saw it 
look  you re worried about yesterday 
i m worried about tomorrow 
the martians land on earth 
they ll need a place to stay 
just like everyone else 
my god 
maybe we should all be destroyed 
the human race doesn t deserve to live 
ethel   
   that reminds me 
i d like the limos to be stocked   
   with every kind of alcohol
known to man 
and top it off with a bottle of dom   
   on ice 
what confounds me most of all
is the lack of genitalia 
down here is the aorta 
up here we have the sphinx 
notice the highly developed
nerve system here 
this explains  of course 
the cerebral arteries 
and if we notice down here 
behind the optic chiasm   
   several glands    
very curious 
  he who believes in me 
though he die  yet shall he live 
  and whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die   
billy glenn norris gave his life
defending our country 
why did it have to be him 
he s a true american hero 
may god rest his soul 
ready  aim 
fire 
aim 
fire

they re responding 
a message from the martians

they ve issued a formal apology 
this is great 
i told you this would happen 
the martian ambassador feels terrible
and wants to speak to congress 
that s good  isn t it 
you bet 
it s a victory for our administration 
ladies and gentlemen 
this is a proud day for all americans 
this is a hell of a photo op  jerry 
are you sure i shouldn t be there 
the secret service don t want
the executive branch   
   and the legislative branch
in the same room 
the martian ambassador
is going to say a few words 
come on down  mr  ambassador 
mr  ambassador  please 
please 
this doesn t make sense 
it s not logical  it s not  
guess it wasn t the dove 
fire 
they blew up congress 
why d they do that 
maybe they don t like the human being 
hello  gentlemen 
nice of you to come on   
   such short notice 
general decker   
   it seems i owe you an apology 
we all make mistakes  mr  president 
not anymore 
we re going to take charge of this thing 
excellent  i have prepared the order 
what s this 
your executive order for full use
of our nuclear deterrent 
are you crazy  i m not starting a war 
we re already at war  sir  we have
to nuke them  we must nuke them now 
general decker  if you do not shut up   
   i ll relieve you of your command 
we must strike now  sir 
annihilate  kill  kill 
shut up 
shut up  shut up 
now   
   i want the people to know   
   that they still have two out of three
branches of government   
   working for them  and that ain t bad 
i want the people to know
that the schools will still be open  okay 
and i want the people to know   
   that the garbage will still be carried out 
and i want a cop   
   on every corner 
which  incidentally   
   we would already have   
   if they had listened to me
in the last election 
jerry   
   how soon can we go on the air 
my fellow americans 
it is with a heavy heart   
   that i speak to you this afternoon 
as you know   
   earlier today the martian ambassador
and his confederates   
   attacked and killed   
   many of your representatives
on capitol hill 
i will be conferring
with other world leaders as time goes on 
and rest assured that  working together   
   we will soon come out   
   at a very real outcome 
thank you 
nathalie  is that you 
yes 
how re you 
not terribly good  i m afraid 
may i ask you a question

because   
   if you were   
   i just want you to know   
   that i liked it 
you did 
really 
because  you know 
i ve watched you on tv quite a bit and   
   well  i ve   
   had something of
a schoolboycrush on you for   
   oh  gosh   
   ages 
hi  there 
are you interested in the white house 
i work there  i m the press secretary 
jerry ross 
have you ever heard of me 
you wouldn t believe
the pressure of my job 
it s nice to see a new face 
are you doing anything 
 cause if you want  i   
   could give you a personalized tour 
would you like that 
hey  mitch  it s me  can you let me in 
hello  mr  ross  sure 
we re a little nervous here 
after what happened

many great men and women
have passed through here 
now we re passing through here

you re very graceful 
i like that 
come here 
we call this the kennedy room

they appear to be
in a highly agitated state 
and i  i don t know 
i honestly don t know 
i don t know what s going on anymore 
this is frustrating 
i m not feeling myself 
lf only i could hold you in my arms 
oh  donald 
i m scared 
excuse me 
you said you wanted to know
as soon as possible 
what is it 
it s no2 
highly concentrated 
nitrogen 
so   
   that s how it could breathe
in our atmosphere 
what s that noise 
but  theodore 
i simply do not feel that lincoln    
it s a full scale invasion 
we must get you to safety 
not this way 
i m sorry  there s a tour going through 
the blue room is often considered
the most beautiful in the white house 
it is often used by the president
to receive guests 
it is furnished to represent
the period of james monroe 
what s that 
that

i prepared a speech  is that okay

hi  everybody 
i want to say  
can you speak up  we can t hear you 
i want to say that there s
a lot of people in the world   
   that have done a lot more
than i have  and   
   they should be here now   
   getting a medal 
and i want to thank my grandma   
   for always being good to me   
   and for helping save the world
and everything

of houses we could live in tepees 
because it s better in many ways 
that s all i have to say  thanks
