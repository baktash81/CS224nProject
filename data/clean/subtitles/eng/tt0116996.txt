cause youre cooking a feast
i can smell it from the interstate
what is that barbecue
yeah but it not coming from here
what is that noise
what is your take on this jerry
the people will love it mr president
our conflict is whether we ambush
the 600 news or hold out for prime time
screw the press
this is a needtoknow situation
we should make it top secret
and should move in with defcon four
we cant sit on this
general casey do you have an opinion
well sir
do we know they are hostile
what do you mean
they have the planet surrounded
by thousands of warships
do we know theyre warships
professor what do we know about them
theyre very advanced technologically
which suggests rightfully so
that theyre peaceful
an advanced civilization is
by definition not barbaric
mr president
this is a great day
i and all my colleagues
are extremely excited
good
extraterrestrial life
youre right jerry
the people are going to love it
this is a momentous occasion
mr president

warm neighborly
abraham lincoln meets

this week its on sale
i hardly think i need worry about that
my husband is the leader of the free world

too fond of chintz thats why

thats absurd why would he stoop

hes interrupting everybody
i dont know its some sort of
an emergency announcement
this doesnt make sense
he should talk to us
white house is coming out live
good evening my fellow americans
i apologize for interrupting
your regular programs
but i have a very important
announcement to make
many important things have happened
to me in my life
my graduation from princeton
the day that marsha said
she would be my wife
the birth of our daughter taffy
thanks dad
and the news that i have heard today
ranks right up there
a powerful memory is in the making
not just for me
but for all mankind
today
an extraordinary discovery
was made by the hubble telescope
the data from the hubble was decoded
then analyzed by the most
powerful computers at mit
the images are undeniable
we are entering the dawn of a new era
frame enlargements provide
an astonishing sight
a fleet of vehicles
which can best be described as
flying saucers
come on come on
papa needs a new pair of shoes
hey am i the only one
shooting craps here
we hope we will have the chance
to meet with them
this is the perfect summation
to the 20th century
martians
this is great
please come to earth please
we need you
i got people coming in
everybody wants to be part of this
galaxys going to be world class
and soon
we will become one solar system
what the hells he talking about
these flying saucers
have come from mars
and at their current course and speed
will enter earths orbit in 16 hours
ive been thinking about martians
when there werent any
it is profoundly moving to know
there is intelligent life out there
glad its somewhere
our world
will never feel quite the same again
good night
and god bless you all
this
is intense
shut up poppy shut up

im an asset to this hotel
they like me around here
youre a nice guy
but i can get leon spinks
or buster douglas for the same money
you better get moving
youre on in five minutes
this shows going to get a great rating
its all yours
ln certain circumstances the proposition
that two and two equals five
is entirely legitimate
call me nathalie
and you do please call me donald
i admire your show
really you like my work
yes very much
why
thank you
coming out of commercial
in fivefour
threetwo
welcome back
were with professor donald kessler
hes the chairman
of the american academy
of astronautics
professor
isnt it weird that we sent
a space probe to mars
and we didnt even find anyone
well not really
nathalie
we didnt get into the canals
the martian canals are canyons
some are over 100 miles deep
the martian civilization has clearly
developed under the planets surface
their science and technology
must be absolutely mindboggling
so
what in your view donald
kessler
chairman are some of the things
the martians can teach us professor
quite a lot about mars nathalie
shes flirting
but seriously
this is tremendously exciting
the knowledge the new ideas
itll change everything
and we must be open to it
maybe they can tell us about our universe
how it started
where its going
perhaps even its purpose
its tremendously exciting
its the most important event since
jesus walked in galilee
christ
whats wrong
go to camera two
i cant its busted
go to one go to four
he copped a feel
now what
whats that
so thats a martian
thats a martian
oh my god
yikes
im not having that thing in my house
sweetie
we may have to
the people expect me to meet them
theyre not eating off the van buren china
look at that brain
he must be real smart
its gross
dont forget nathalie
that we will look equally gross to him
he made the international sign
of the doughnut
from the limited information available
ive made three extrapolations one
our martian friend
is a carbonbased life form
two he breathes nitrogen
and three
the large cerebrum here indicates
telepathic potential
you mean they can
read our thoughts
potentially yes
what about their intentions
are they friendly people
logic dictates that given
their high level of technical development
theyre an advanced culture
therefore peaceful and enlightened
the human race on the other hand
is an aggressively dangerous species
now i suspect they have
more to fear from us
than we from them
doctor
thank you
for many years
ive been refining a translating computer
the results are not perfect but this
may answer some of your questions
green skin
800 centuries ago
their bodily fluids
include the birth of halfbreeds
how many centuries did he say
eight hundred sir
selfdetermination of the cosmos
for dark is the suede that
mows
like a harvest
what the hell does that mean
hey mitch
good morning
im sorry you cant come this way
theres a tour in progress
hello my name is barbara
hello barbara
i am an alcoholic
but i havent had a drink in three months
im feeling so optimistic
because of the martians
were not alone in the universe
and its so perfect
that its happening at the beginning
of the new millennium
our planet was suffering
with the ozone and the rain forest and
so many people unhappy in their lives
and then
the martians heard
our global karmic cry for help
people say theyre ugly
but i think theyve come
to show us the way
i think theyve come to save us
thank you
byebye
you be careful dont get yourself killed

richie want to make yourself useful
for a change
sure dad
take grandma back to the home
i bet you never thought youd live
to see the martians come
its pretty far out
but think of all the crazy things
you must have seen

when they invented the train
come on kid im not that old
are you okay
i want to see slim
i want to see
slim
and muffy
and richie
grandma im richie

richie was always the best one

theyre preparing a list of issues
of common interest to discuss
there is a unilateral concerted
diplomatic effort being made
jason

lf the martians land

this situation needs to be supervised
absolutely sir
general casey
can you handle it
id be proud
good but keep a lid on it
key media good crosssection of guests
we dont want it to turn
into a zoo out there
they dont know what
theyre talking about
liberals intellectuals
peacemongers idiots
would you please keep it down
people live here
general casey
yes i get to greet the martian ambassador
isnt that great
oh its a hell of an honor
didnt i always tell you if i stayed
in place and never spoke up
good things were bound to happen
i want the martians to be treated
like foreign dignitaries
i want your men alert and majestic
with a snap in their step
this must look good
the world is watching

okay lets go
the teeming masses have gathered
from who knows how many states

curiosity or is it something more
or simply to say i was there
i was there
when first man
met martian
jason stone
gnn
pahrump
some room
give them room
it is an awesome sight
the giant spacecraft glinting
in the nevada sun like a
giant
hubcap
somethings happening
the doorway
is opening
a silver ramp
is coming out
like a giant tongue
gee whiz
martians
funny little critters
well
wait
greetings
i am the martian ambassador
everything is fixed now you may speak
greetings
i am general casey
commanding officer of the armed
forces of the united states of america
on behalf of the people of earth
welcome
he did that well
we come in peace
we come in peace we come in peace
they came in peace
we come in peace
open fire
what
die you alien shithead
i surrender
no it aint happening it didnt happen
holy mother of god
did you see that
we should hit these assholes
with everything weve got sir
sir mr president
i know this seems terrible
but lets not be too rash
we should nuke them
we must establish
a line of communication first
set up a town hall
well get the publics opinion
what do you think
kick the crap out of them
ladies and gentlemen
it may be a cultural misunderstanding
maybe to them doves mean war
we all saw how they reacted to that dove
it frightened them
he did say that
we come in peace
the new computers ready
okay lets do it
i know were making the right decision
ready to transmit
this is the president of the united states
im speaking in the hope
that what happened earlier today
in the nevada desert
was a cultural misunderstanding
there can be no doubt
that we two peoples
have a great deal to offer one another
you must be as excited as we
to find intelligent life in the solar system
let me make it clear
you have nothing
to fear from us
our customs may be strange to you
but we mean no harm
when the investors fly in
i would like for them each to be
met by a limo
top of the line cars
leather interiors
corinthian if they got it
are you still spinning your wheels
on that cockamamie hotel
hello
the martians have attacked
this was no misunderstanding
i was there i saw it
look youre worried about yesterday
im worried about tomorrow
the martians land on earth
theyll need a place to stay
just like everyone else
my god
maybe we should all be destroyed
the human race doesnt deserve to live
ethel
that reminds me
id like the limos to be stocked
with every kind of alcohol
known to man
and top it off with a bottle of dom
on ice
what confounds me most of all
is the lack of genitalia
down here is the aorta
up here we have the sphinx
notice the highly developed
nerve system here
this explains of course
the cerebral arteries
and if we notice down here
behind the optic chiasm
several glands
very curious
he who believes in me
though he die yet shall he live
and whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die
billyglenn norris gave his life
defending our country
why did it have to be him
hes a true american hero
may god rest his soul
ready aim
fire
aim
fire
hello

theyre responding
a message from the martians

i told you this would happen
the martian ambassador feels terrible
and wants to speak to congress
thats good isnt it
you bet
its a victory for our administration
ladies and gentlemen
this is a proud day for all americans
this is a hell of a photoop jerry
are you sure i shouldnt be there
the secret service dont want
the executive branch
and the legislative branch
in the same room
the martian ambassador
is going to say a few words
come on down mr ambassador
mr ambassador please

this doesnt make sense
its not logical its not

fire
they blew up congress
whyd they do that
maybe they dont like the human being
hello gentlemen
nice of you to come on
such short notice
general decker
it seems i owe you an apology
we all make mistakes mr president

we must strike now sir
annihilate kill kill
shut up
shut up shut up
now
i want the people to know
that they still have two out of three
branches of government
working for them and that aint bad
i want the people to know
that the schools will still be open okay
and i want the people to know
that the garbage will still be carried out
and i want a cop
on every corner
which incidentally
we would already have
if they had listened to me
in the last election
jerry
how soon can we go on the air
my fellow americans
it is with a heavy heart
that i speak to you this afternoon
as you know
earlier today the martian ambassador
and his confederates
attacked and killed
many of your representatives

with other world leaders as time goes on
and rest assured that working together
we will soon come out
at a very real outcome
