so your friend cut off
radio contact  did she 
oh  hi  jack 
well  some people
just don t know
how to act on
a secret mission 
i guess we re better off
just handling this one
on our own 
like the maracaibo assignment 
remember that 
back when i was known
as agent x 
that was
a close one 
yeah   
yeah  there we were 
surrounded by hordes
of angry mercenaries 
all you had was
a ball of string
and a sealed i o u 
from the embassy 
and then there was
a letter bomb 
yeah  that s  cause
i told you not to trust them 
that s what i mean
about working alone 
i guess
you re right 
yeah   
help   me 
here  here   
whatever happens 
don t let them get it 
tell the fbi   
1 million  329  
run 
davey  what
are you doing 
they just killed a man 
now they re after me

i saw him fall 
i had to run
right by him 
you want to tell me
what is this all about 
well  these nazis  or
some kind of bad guys 
they shot
this fbi man 
nazis 
how should i know 
maybe they were russians 
but they shot him 
and he was bleeding 
and he fell 
i knew he was dead 
look 
i m not kidding you 
i can prove it 
he gave me this
secret cartridge  
no  no  no 
don t trust him  dave 
that s the first rule
of espionage 
always stay true
to your source 
secret what 
well 
never mind 
hi  mr  rice 
hi  purdy 
did you see anybody
on the terrace level 
no  not a soul

come on 
ok  folks 
step back 
clear the area 
thank you 
i better be
going now 
you gonna be
all right 
yeah  i ve got a key 
ok 
davey  i ve been calling
all over the place for you 
mr  osborne 
lieutenant fleming 
san antonio pd 
dad  i didn t do  
just wait a minute 
ok  let him talk 
what s  come on in 
not at this time 
i ve got to keep an ear
out for the squawk box 
oh  well  go on
to your room  davey 
dad  i want to hear
what he has to say  
just go to your room 
davey  all right 
what  uh   
what  what
happened 
well  your son
created quite a stir
at the tower life
building this morning
when he reported
a murder 
a murder 
that s right  sir 
we checked out his story
and found absolutely
no credence to it 
then we tried
to bring him home 
but he refused to
divulge the whereabouts
of what he called 
um   headquarters  
sorry  officer 
but he does  uh 
do that sometimes 
we got them right
where we want them 
huh 
let  em think
you re nuts 
see  if we re
gonna be heroes 
we got to keep
a low profile 
no cops  no dads 
we re on our own  pal 
there gonna be any
charges  or what 
not this time  sir 
but we do think that
you ought to consider
getting him some help 
i have 
for almost an hour 
all he would give us
is his name  rank 
and serial number 
the tougher we got 
the tougher he got 
good 
if it hadn t been
for the little girl 
we would ve never
gotten him home 
officer  i   
they ll sing
a different tune
once you re a hero 
   stuff like this
with parents a lot 
he is a good boy 
he s just   
going through a real
tough time right now 
he lost his
mother recently 
i guess we re both
having a little difficulty
making an adjustment 
well  i can say
one thing for him 
if we were at war 
i d want him
on my side 
you ready to talk 
want to talk
about the murders 
they weren t murderers 
they were spies 
they d gone there to
kill an fbi agent 
i just intercepted one
of their communications 
anybody else see  em 
if mom were here 
she d believe me 
she probably would 
but she s not here 
and she s not
gonna be here 
we ve gotta get
used to that 
i miss her 
i know 
we both miss her 
i bet she knows it 
i ll bet she can see us
right now  you know that 
listen 
i ve got an idea 
why don t you and me

a good spy always knows
when to bring in
outside expertise 
morris can do it 
he can do anything

whoever put this in
really went through
a lot of trouble

remember  you can win or lose
the game right here 
   taxation
without representation 
in fact 
they were quite angry 
but they did not
want to fight santa ana 
instead they
tried to negotiate 
content being
citizens of mexico 
all they wanted
was the reinstatement
of the constitution
and taxes lifted 
in 1835 
negotiations broke down 
and the texans began
to talk revolution 
general santa ana
heard this rumor and   
the souvenir shop is
right through there 
thank you 
how much time do we have
before that tour bus leaves 
oh  we ve got time 
let s drop on
by the shop 
well  look who s here 
last time i saw you 
you were jumping off a boat 
were you feeling
a little seasick 
i m hiding from
that man over there 
oh  it s somebody
new this time 
now  isn t it about time
you told me
what this is all about 
ladies and gentlemen 
the alamo will be
closing in 2 minutes 
our young friend
seems to be
in some sort
of trouble again 
now  here 
just a minute 
what is your name 
davey 
not davy crockett
by any chance 
i really have to
go now 
it s a matter of
national security 
will everyone please exit
through the front door 
what do you think 
i think the boy
needs our help 
hey  stop that kid 
he s stealing
somebody s bag  get him 
you got
a hell of a nerve  kid 
stealing inside
the alamo 
i didn t steal it 
he didn t steal
anything  officer 
he took this 
well  that s just
a simple mistake 
i sent the boy in to
pick up my camera case 
and he took
the wrong one 
hey 
this yours 
well  come and get it 
why don t you take
the boy over to the car
while i straighten
this out 
but that one has
a secret
cartridge in it 
come on 
don t worry
about it 
george will
take care of
everything 
the car s
over here 
now  don t you
fret yourself 
george will take
care of everything 
he s very good at that 
he s giving him
the camera case 
he is 
well  if he did  he had
a reason for doing it 
slide over 
that s it 
this what you re
so worried about 
no  sir 
it was the case
you gave the other man 
that was the one
with the plans in it 
what makes you
so sure
i gave the wrong
case back 
pardon 
why don t you open
it and find out 
you got it 
george always makes things
turn out right 
but how d you do it 
i just gave that man
my camera case
in its place 
he never noticed
the difference 
now  do you mind
telling us
what this
is all about 
after all  i sacrificed
my good camera
to save your
cloak and dagger tape 
it isn t just
a cloak and dagger tape 
there s an extra
microchip in here 
what was that man
doing with it
at the alamo 
said he had to give it
to some foreign spy 
no 
really 
did he say what
the spy looked like 
only that he had
2 fingers missing 
how exciting 
may i see the tape 
davey 
sure 
something wrong  davey 
it s all right 
such a clever
little boy 
don t you think so 
george 
i wish we could take him
to mexico city with us 
i made an arrangement
with rice 
he s going to take care
of him for us
on our way
to the airport 
i don t like him  and i
don t like his methods 
and i don t like
those 2 thugs of his 
i made it
very clear to him
that we re
very displeased
with this whole mess 
he won t dare make
another mistake 
not if he wants
to do business with us 
i made that
very clear 
what time s
our flight 
midnight 
we better check out 
i m afraid we won t be able
to use
our dinner reservations 
what a nuisance 
wake up 
somebody s coming 
where are we 
i can t see a thing 
right back where
you put us 
hey  pop the trunk 
will you 
better play dead
or you will be 
that kid is
still out cold 
you want to kill him now
or wait till
the chloroform wears off 
wait till we get
to the desert 
what s taking
rice so long anyway 
it can t take him 2 hours
to divide up the money 
i think we
should get extra
for killing the kid 
you re right 
let s go
hurry him up 
we ll never
get out of here 
stay cool 
i m thinking
