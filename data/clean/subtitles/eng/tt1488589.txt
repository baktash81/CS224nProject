pinocchio hello hello
spirit who are you
i feel as though youve been here before
i am pinocchio im a boy
and i think im dead
spirit ah yes i see
the wooden boy with the borrowed soul
my sisters folly
the sentimental fool
she gave you life pinocchio
when you were not supposed to have it
no more than a chair or a table should
as a result you cannot truly truly die
oh boy oh boy
and and thats good right
spirit well it means that you are not
nor will you ever be
a real boy like carlo
the one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful you see
is how brief it is
oh
spirit dont get me wrong you will die
many many times
this being one of them
but they are not real deaths
just waiting periods
there are rules you see
despite my sisters disregard for them
we will both have to wait
for the sand to run out
you will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross
until the end of time
and then after that sand runs out
spirit i will simply send you back
every time
i see
well in that case
id like to ask you one thing
screams
spirit see you next time
no
no
ah pinocchio
niente theres not much we can do
im afraid the body is rigid
well hes always been rigid
hes made of wood
even if hes dead i could still book him
how dare you sir
show some respect
you show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings
gentlemen please
this is no time for your petty grievances
mumbling mockingly
chanting in latin
how do you intend
to dispose of the dead body
a dead body where
gasps
pinocchio youre alive
he is immortal
long live the arts
its a miracle
pinocchio panting
take it easy my child

were going home
uh uh uh wait a moment
chuckles
i have a legally binding contract
signed by both artist and management
he either performs
or you owe me ten million lire
well thats ridiculous
its just a smiling sun
its still his signature is it not
i drew that
ha ha
i demand full restitution before the law
including transportation
transmutation all the future represe
our country comes first
this boy cannot be killed
hes the ideal soldier
hmm

into the youth camps by law
you will learn to fight
and fire a weapon
and be a real italian boy
now we we must go

chuckles

geppetto sighs

i was recounting my life
it was a good life
ah good enough
clears throat
hit it boys
my dear father loved to say
hop to the top of the day
the drops are easy to swallow
my dear father loved to say
mop your tears and mend your sorrows
to not drown your soul
wishing for better tomorrows
you want to think bright
you want to think right
a star falling down down down
doesnt break the night
you want to think bright
whatever you do
shadows bring you down down down
dimming all the light
as you try to climb
for life has a funny way
of going round and round
on a ride it goes one day side to side
one day upside down down down
you can make it right
well worth a good fight
and if some days have downs and lows
open your arms to better
tomorrows
a floating tune is in the air
the simple things you care to share
a trace of light
a flock of sparrows
anything high you dare to follow
open your arms to better tomorrows
tomorrows
you want to think bright
you want to think right
to let your heart sing sing sing
on a summer night
you want to think bright
whatever you do
when the strings go zing zing zing
fly high with the band
just get up and swing
you can make it right
well worth a good fight
and if some days have downs and lows
open your arms to better
tomorrows
watercolors in may
painting a purple sky
a pen a line a river
strokes on a mandolin
playing a gentle sigh
these are
the simple things that matter
you want to think bright
bright
you want to think right
right
and let your heart sing sing sing
on a summer night
night
you want to think bright
whatever you do
teeny bells go ding ding ding
laughing in the wind
kite on a string
for life has a funny way
of going round and round
on a ride it goes one day side to side
one day upside down down down
and you make it right
right
and your heart is bright
bright
so let the world know how it goes
open your arms to better
open your arms
open your arms to better
tomorrows
