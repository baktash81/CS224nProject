 pinocchio  hello  hello 
 spirit  who are you 
i feel as though you ve been here before 
i am pinocchio  i m a boy 
and i think i m    dead 
 spirit  ah  yes  i see 
the wooden boy with the borrowed soul 
my sister s folly 
the sentimental fool 
she gave you life  pinocchio 
when you were not supposed to have it 
no more than a chair or a table should 
as a result  you cannot truly  truly die 
oh boy  oh boy 
and    and that s good  right 
 spirit  well  it means that you are not 
nor will you ever be 
a real boy like carlo 
the one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful  you see 
is how brief it is 
oh 
 spirit  don t get me wrong  you will die
many  many times 
this being one of them 
but they are not real deaths 
just waiting periods 
there are rules  you see 
despite my sister s disregard for them 
we will both have to wait
for the sand to run out 
you will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross
until the end of time 
and then  after that sand runs out 
 spirit  i will simply send you back
every time 
i see 
well  in that case 
i d like to ask you one thing 
 screams 
 spirit  see you next time 
no 
no 
ah  pinocchio 
niente  there s not much we can do 
i m afraid the body is rigid 
well  he s always been rigid 
he s made of wood 
even if he s dead  i could still book him 
how dare you  sir 
show some respect 
you show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings 
gentlemen  please 
this is no time for your petty grievances 
 mumbling mockingly 
 chanting in latin 
how do you intend
to dispose of the dead body 
  a dead body  where 
   gasps 
pinocchio  you re alive 
he is immortal 
long live the arts 
it s a miracle 
 pinocchio panting 
take it easy  my child 
lean on me 
we re going home 
  uh  uh  uh  wait a moment 
   chuckles 
i have a legally binding contract 
signed by both artist and management 
he either performs 
or you owe me ten million lire 
well  that s ridiculous 
it s just a smiling sun 
it s still his signature  is it not 
i drew that 
ha ha 
i demand full restitution before the law 
including transportation 
transmutation  all the future represe   
our country comes first 
this boy cannot be killed 
  he s the ideal soldier 
  hmm 
he must be drafted
into the youth camps by law 
you will learn to fight 
and fire a weapon 
and be a real italian boy 
now we    we must go 
we truly must go 
we will all speak later  i am sure 
 chuckles

 geppetto sighs 
what    what a day  what a day

war is not fun 
war is not good  war   
war took carlo away from me 
then i simply won t go 
but you have to go now  it s the law 
even when it s something bad 
yes  we all have to obey the law
whether we like it or not 
why 
i don t have time or patience enough
to explain that to you  i    i   
i owe that man a fortune 
and you    you will be taken far away
and recruited into military youth camp 
and now    now look
what you ve turned me into 
i made you to be like carlo 
why can t you be more like carlo 
because i m not carlo 
i don t wanna be like carlo 
  carlo is   
  enough 
you are such a burden 
 melancholic music playing

his nose didn t grow 
 cricket  what s that 
 pinocchio  when he called me a burden 
his nose didn t grow 
that s how he really feels 
i don t want to be a burden 
i don t want to hurt papa
and make him want to yell at me like that 
oh  pinocchio 
sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else 
and they say things 
things they only think they mean
in the moment 
but with time  they learn that   
well  that they
never really meant it at all 
do you understand

why are you so blind 
so absolutely blind 
the boy loves you 
he has much to learn 
but he loves you for who you are 
would it kill you to do as much for him 
you should start acting like a father 
a real father 
not an old stubborn goat who s so busy
moaning and crying about his losses   
 mockingly   me  me  me  poor me  
   that he cannot see
the love he actually has 
i may be a bug  sir 
but i have a thing or two
to teach you about

my father meant about those planes 
i don t know 
i still don t really understand
what we re even doing here 
we re preparing to be soldiers  for war 
but my papa said war is bad 
that s  cause he s a coward 
a coward  my papa 
well  he s afraid of war  isn t he 
my father says if you re afraid to die
for your country  you re weak 
you re a coward 
are you afraid 
i m not afraid at all

every day and anytime 
  so do i 
  well  we ll see about that  won t we 
i ll show him i m no coward 
i ll make him like me 
you know 
all fathers love their sons  but   
sometimes fathers feel despair 
like everyone else 
and they say things
they only think they mean in the moment 
but with time  they learn
they never really meant it at all 
and they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward 
but inside   
they love you 
are you scared 
of dying 
me  nah 
i died a couple times 
it was all right 
there s rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand 
blue sand 
 chuckles 
you re so weird 
no weirder than you  pal 
 both laugh 
i m    i m glad you re here 
 sighs 
me too 
 podesta  and as with all great empires 
the destiny of italy will be forged
in the strength of its youth 
today  you ll get your first taste of war 
you ll form two teams 
in the center of the battlefield
is a tower 
the first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins 
and remember 
no matter who is on the other team 
they are your enemy 
may the best man win
and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all

the wood sprite again 
geppetto aged 
pinocchio didn t 
and in time  geppetto left 
one winter morning 
pinocchio found me by the window 
i wasn t moving anymore 
so he put me in a matchbox 
and he carries me still with him 
right in his heart 
 sighs 
 cricket  he ventured into the world 
and the world 
i believe  embraced him back 
i ve not heard of him in quite a while 
will he eventually die 
i think so 
and maybe that makes him a real boy 
what happens  happens 
and then  we are gone 
 gentle music playing

do you mind 
i was recounting my life 
it was a good life 
ah  good enough 
 clears throat 
hit it  boys 
  my dear father loved to say  
   hop to the top of the day   
   the drops are easy to swallow   
  my dear father loved to say
 mop your tears and mend your sorrows  
  to not drown your soul  
  wishing for better tomorrows   
  you want to think bright  
  you want to think right  
  a star falling down  down  down
doesn t break the night  
  you want to think bright
whatever you do  
  shadows bring you down  down  down  
  dimming all the light
as you try to climb  
  for life has a funny way
of going round and round  
  on a ride it goes  one day side to side
one day upside down  down  down  
  you can make it right  
  well worth a good fight  
  and if some days have downs and lows
open your arms to better  
  tomorrows  
  a floating tune is in the air  
  the simple things you care to share  
  a trace of light
a flock of sparrows  
  anything high you dare to follow  
  open your arms to better tomorrows  
  tomorrows  
  you want to think bright  
  you want to think right  
  to let your heart sing  sing  sing  
  on a summer night  
  you want to think bright  
  whatever you do  
  when the strings go zing  zing  zing  
  fly high with the band
just get up and swing  
  you can make it right  
  well worth a good fight  
  and if some days have downs and lows  
  open your arms to better  
  tomorrows  
  watercolors in may  
  painting a purple sky  
  a pen  a line  a river  
  strokes on a mandolin  
  playing a gentle sigh  
  these are
the simple things that matter  
    you want to think bright  
    bright  
    you want to think right  
    right  
  and let your heart sing  sing  sing  
    on a summer night  
    night  
  you want to think bright
whatever you do  
  teeny bells go ding  ding  ding  
  laughing in the wind
kite on a string  
  for life has a funny way
of going  round and  round  
  on a ride it goes  one day side to side
one day upside down  down  down  
    and you make it right  
    right  
    and your heart is bright  
    bright  
  so let the world know how it goes  
  open your arms to better  
  open your arms  
  open your arms to better  
  tomorrows
