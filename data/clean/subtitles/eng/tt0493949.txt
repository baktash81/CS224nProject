imagination  which does come in handy 
it makes the fun parts funner

i saw your old buddy henry staring at it like
he left something important inside 
henry huggins 
i haven t heard that name in a while 
isn t he the boy
that used to eat dirt in the backyard 
  yeah 
  he doesn t do that anymore 
ooh  if i didn t know better 
i d say somebody has a crush 
  ooh ooh

can the old dirt eater do this 
ooh hoo  whoo hoo 
oh  i hope not  stop 
  mom

it could be loan papers for the addition 
  hope they don t expect us to pay it back 
  well  banks are funny that way 
what do we got here 
 to the parents of beatrice quimby  
could this be the latest report card 
 beatrice quimby gets in fights   
 steals from the vending machines 
counterfeits hall passes 
  wait  let me see 
  we recommend juvenile prison   
all a s 
  we re so proud of you 
  it s not funny 
so  ramona  beatrice has her report card 
doesn t that mean 
i don t know  you should have one too 
that old thing 
yeah  that old thing 
where would that old thing happen to be 
  that s a good place for it 
  yeah  wouldn t want it to spoil 
oh 
 ramona is a bright young student  
that s my girl       but lacks focus   
 often daydreams 
disputes the need to spell words correctly   
 and has very little respect
for the rules of grammar   
or rules in general  
  oh 
  why would she write this  ramona 
because    she s no fun 
  that is no excuse 
  but it s true 
she makes us all use
the same words from the same list 
and when i try to be original 
she just shoots me down 
like when i invented the word  terrifical  
she goes   ramona  that s not a word  
and i say   it s a lot funner word to say  
she goes   funner isn t a word either  
what kind of teacher is that 
she can t tell kids not to invent words 
she s not the president of the world 
  you butt out  beezus 
ramona  mrs  meacham is your teacher 
  you need to listen to her 
  and she s not that bad 
she was fair with me when i was your age 
yeah  well 
everybody loves beezus   
and everybody hates me 
  okay 
  why are you laughing 
  we re not laughing  sweetie 
i m gonna say a bad word 
  you are 
  mm hmm 
a really bad one 
well  if you feel the need to get one
out of your system  then go ahead 
  guts 
  guts  guts  guts

did that one get bigger 
tremendous  trophy size 
you know   
i was a younger sister  too  once  still am 
no matter how old i get 
i ll always be younger 
it s no fair  aunt bea 
i never do anything as good as beezus 
  and roberta  if she burps  it s adorable 
  hmm 
last week 
she poured applesauce on her head   
  and dad stopped to take pictures 
  oh 
i mean  when it s my turn to do stuff   
nobody even cares 
well  it s impossible to compete
with pouring food on your head 
why do we even bother 
you know what  i bet it would be nice   
to have something of your own for once 
like my own room 
maybe just something small   
you could always have with you 
go ahead  open it 
i found that picture the other day   
and i realized i was exactly your age 
so i wanted you to have it 
  that s you 
  yeah 
there s room for another if you wanna
give that little girl some company 
  thank you  aunt bea

  dad 
  hey 
daddy 
  boing

go outside and share those   
and i ll talk to your mom for a minute  okay 
  let s go 
  thank you 
  something s wrong 
they let three people go last week 
how can you tell 
 cause they re whispering 
did i do something wrong 
no 
not this time 
but something tells me
that we re not going to macaroni joe s 
hey  you got more red ones 
all right  take a few more 
remember how i taught you to eat them 
  bite the head off first 
  yep 
it s more humane that way 
you don t deserve to be downsized 
 downsized   what s that mean 
well  um   
it means the storage company
was bought by a bigger one   
and a lot of people were let go 
including dad 
the good news is
i called dr  perry s office   
and she has some part time work
for me again   
so that should tide us over
for a little while  at least 
don t worry  i will find a job 
but in the meantime   
i got a little extra time
to spend with my girls 
right 
  right 
  right 
  okay 
  right 
you realize we re gonna be poor now  right 
no  we re not 
  are we 
  have you seen how many bills they get 
it s insane 
everything costs money  even water 
well  mom s gonna make money 
and dad  he ll be with us 
that part s fun 
well  get ready for another year
in hand me down heaven 
hey  lights out  my lovelies 
sweet dreams 
beezus 
it s sort of scary
having a hole in the house   
don t you think 
  beezus 
  shh  i m trying to sleep 
beezus  did you hear that growling 
it s probably just your stomach  doofus 
unless 
unless it s something   
else 
beezus  stop it 
  like a ferocious  hungry 
  stop 
slithering beast that feeds
on pests with bad report cards 
  ah 
you re too easy 
beezus  it s not funny 
i thought it was 
bring it up 
let me get a pen  write it down 
  both girls
get carrots and sandwiches 
  okay 
beezus wants hers in a ziploc 
and ramona insists on having tin foil 
she claims it affects the taste  but i think
she just likes making sculptures with it 
what else  ramona wants
a hard boiled egg if we have any 
think fast 
please tell me you re
gonna remember all this 
look at me  fully domesticated 
i ve lined up mrs  kemp

special in your life   
using at least one word
from our vocabulary list 
this is my ballet tiara 
ooh 
this is a saddle for riding camels 
it s special to me
because i m going to wear my tiara   
when i audition for the part of the princess
in the royal peanut butter commercials 
and it s special because
my uncle hobart gave it to me 
i think i d be extraordinary in the role 
e x t r a o r d i n a r y 
and he travels all over the world   
taking pictures of animals
in their natural habitat 
h a b i t a t 
extraordinary

ramona 
what was that about   rough at home  
  well  your dad lost his job  didn t he 
  maybe 
look  when people lose their jobs  you know 
they start fighting   
and then they get a divorce
and sell their houses 
it s textbook 
look at the bright side  ramona 
i mean  after my dad got laid off 
my mom sold her house   
got a real estate license  so there s a plus 
and then my dad got a new car
and moved to tacoma

well  you know that big bridge we took
when we went to washington state 
  yeah 
  i ve always wanted to stop in the middle   
and have one foot in oregon
and one in washington 
  hmm 
  that way my legs have dual citizenship 
i like it 
that s interesting  interesting notion 
not practical because the car s kaput   
but you re on the right track 
i mean  it s bold  it s daring 
it s fairly inexpensive 
come on  give me  what else 
we could draw it 
oh  i ve got an idea

oh  well  thank you  pickle 
you know  i studied art
back in the day  as they say 
what happened 
did you get a bad report card

beezus came along

you girls make my life very colorful 
  hi  hey  beezus 
  hey 
  wanna walk home

when we were kids  i thought your dad was 
like  the king of klickitat street 
do you remember that gorilla hunt
in my backyard   
when he made us set up the tents
and wait there all night   
with bananas and butterfly nets 
you ended up with mashed bananas
in your hair 
i had poison ivy all over me 
but it was also 
  the best time we had that whole summer 
  hands down 
yeah  well  he s not as funny these days 
why  what s going on 
he lost his job a few weeks ago   
and he acts like he s not worried 
for our sake  but i can tell he is 
and he should be 
what if he doesn t get something
that he likes 
what if he has to settle
for something that he hates   
because of    us 
beezus  that s a big deal 
  why didn t you tell me 
  i don t know 
i don t know  sometimes   
things feel different between us 
like it s not as easy to talk to you
as it used to be  you know 
yeah  yeah  i guess  a little 
  it s not that i don t want to talk to you 
  no  no  i get you 
  it s just very different 
  different 
exactly 
oh  gosh 
um  yeah
