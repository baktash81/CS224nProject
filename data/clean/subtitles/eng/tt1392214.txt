youre the shithot detective
work it out
i actually meant before that
you were walking in the opposite direction
across the parking lot
towards campello street
yeah well i havent had a drink
in nine and a half years
figured if i walked around
the parking lot a while
by the time they opened
id stop wanting it that bad
and then i saw you
sort of helped me make up my mind
theres a bag of lye in your basement
thats half empty
your wife thinks youve been helping us
but we both know thats not true
i used the lye to bury our dog last year
and helping the cops sounds better than
ive been driving aimlessly in my truck
because i dont know
what the fuck else to do
is that what you were doing
last saturday night
probably am i a suspect
no im only asking because you
assaulted a man whos now missing
i heard about that what happened
thought you had him under surveillance
im gonna assume youre asking me
because you have no idea
didnt think it was something id get away with
its not
it couldnt be he skipped town
because the asshole is guilty
couldnt be that because that would
mean it would be your fault right
mr dover
mr dover

you need to take care of yourself
and your wife
thats the best thing you can do right now

uh
i guess i havent thought
this through too good huh i
i been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew
and i know i scared him the other day
at the police station and
what im trying to say is i kind of feel
responsible for him running away
you wanna come on in
yeah
my husband and i were
very devout at one time
spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son
handing out pamphlets
spreading the good word
after our son died of cancer
we started seeing things differently
adopting alex helped
but we never got over it
im sorry
you look very tired
yeah i dont sleep much
i uh
i keep dreaming about being lost in a maze
im sorry heh
alex never talks very much
so when people come over here
i hardly know what to say
he doesnt talk much
well he talks good morning
good night that sort of thing
hard to get too much
more than that out of him
had an accident when he was little
after that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully
what what kind of accident did he
oh
my husband kept snakes
it wasnt that bad what happened
but alex had a fear of them and
thats not my favorite memory
im sorry its none of my business
oh
can i get you a cup of tea mr dover
oh
oh im so sorry i thought you
would have known about that already
i say its better this way
you know that awful man
he would have spent years on death row
just watching tv and getting fat
well
least i dont have to worry
about losing you to psp
when forensics is finished with the guys
place were gonna deploy the cadaver dogs
look kid we cant always save the day
all right were just cops janitors

its supposed to snow soon hurry up okay
its like hes playacting case in point
except for the items idd
by the dovers and the birches
all the kids clothes that we found
still had tags on them
and that maze book that we found
he made it
photocopies pictures from this book
we found in the attic
exfbi agent wrote that
finding the invisible man
its about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions
its totally discredited
i guess but i read some of it
taylor was abducted when he was a kid
he ran away after three weeks
the captor drugged him on some
sort of lsdketamine cocktail
he never remembered
and they never caught the guy
okay so he read the book and decided
he was taken by the invisible man
now hes doing his best imitation right
yeah he was doing his best imitation
he killed himself last night
how did he do that
i thought he was in custody
hey
taylor drew this its a map to the bodies
its a map to the bodies
we found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse
theres a connection okay
connection is
that its the last maze in the book
its unsolvable theres no way out
your corpse is another wannabe
read the book
what are you saying to me rich what
what are you saying
that this guy is a fake
youre saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere
