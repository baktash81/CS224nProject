he doesn t have much 
what have you got 
well  this thing s clean  i mean  it s
filthy as shit  but we didn t find anything 
you didn t find any wool fibers 
anything like that 
the girls could be wearing some wool
gloves or wool hat  no cotton fibers 
if he was using this to transport them 
i might buy that 
but if there had been a struggle 
i would have found something 
i d start looking in the woods

i actually meant before that 
you were walking in the opposite direction
across the parking lot

the parking lot a while   
   by the time they opened
i d stop wanting it that bad 
and then i saw you 
sort of helped me make up my mind 
there s a bag of lye in your basement
that s half empty 
your wife thinks you ve been helping us   
   but we both know that s not true 
i used the lye to bury our dog last year 
and  helping the cops  sounds better than
 i ve been driving aimlessly in my truck   
   because i don t know
what the fuck else to do  
is that what you were doing
last saturday night 
probably  am i a suspect 
no  i m only asking because you
assaulted a man who s now missing 
i heard about that  what happened 
thought you had him under surveillance 
i m gonna assume you re asking me
because you have no idea 
  didn t think it was something i d get away with 
  it s not 
it couldn t be he skipped town
because the asshole is guilty 
couldn t be that  because that would
mean it would be your fault  right

this through too good  huh  i   
i been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew 
and i know i scared him the other day
at the police station  and   
what i m trying to say is i kind of feel
responsible for him running away 
you wanna come on in 
yeah 
my husband and i were
very devout at one time 
spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son   
   handing out pamphlets 
spreading the good word 
after our son died of cancer   
   we started seeing things differently 
adopting alex helped   
   but we never got over it 
i m sorry 
you look very tired 
yeah  i don t sleep much 
i  uh   
i keep dreaming about being lost in a maze 
i m sorry  heh 
alex never talks very much   
   so when people come over here 
i hardly know what to say 
he doesn t talk much 
well  he talks  good morning 
good night  that sort of thing 
hard to get too much
more than that out of him 
had an accident when he was little 
after that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully 
  what     what kind of accident did he    
  oh 
my husband kept snakes 
it wasn t that bad what happened 
but alex had a fear of them and   
that s not my favorite memory 
i m sorry  it s none of my business 
oh 
can i get you a cup of tea  mr  dover 
oh 
oh  i m so sorry  i thought you
would have known about that already 
i say it s better this way 
you know  that awful man   
   he would have spent years on death row
just watching tv and getting fat 
well

about losing you to p s p 
when forensics is finished with the guy s
place  we re gonna deploy the cadaver dogs 
look  kid  we can t always save the day

 cell phone rings

 cell phone continues ringing 
  yeah 
rich    hey  it s rich  we found something 
guys  let us have a look 
two kid sized department store
mannequins  with their heads caved in 
i talked to our lab  they told me the blood
we sampled from the plastic containers 
pig s blood 
let s get this covered up 
it s supposed to snow soon  hurry up  okay 
it s like he s play acting  case in point 
except for the items id d
by the dovers and the birches   
   all the kids  clothes that we found
still had tags on them 
and that maze book that we found 
he made it 
photocopies  pictures from this book
we found in the attic 
  ex fbi agent wrote that 
   finding the invisible man  
it s about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions 
it s totally discredited 
i guess  but i read some of it 
taylor was abducted when he was a kid 
he ran away after three weeks 
the captor drugged him on some
sort of lsd ketamine cocktail 
he never remembered
and they never caught the guy 
okay  so  he read the book and decided
he was taken by the invisible man 
now he s doing his best imitation  right 
yeah  he was doing his best imitation 
he killed himself last night 
how did he do that 
i thought he was in custody 
hey 
taylor drew this  it s a map to the bodies 
it s a map to the bodies 
we found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse 
  there s a connection  okay 
  connection is   
   that it s the last maze in the book 
it s unsolvable  there s no way out 
your corpse is another wannabe 
read the book 
what are you saying to me  rich  what 
what are you saying 
that this guy is a fake 
you re saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere 
how did bob taylor get those clothes 
how did     how did the parents   
   positively id those clothes 
that i can t reconcile 
you can t reconcile that
