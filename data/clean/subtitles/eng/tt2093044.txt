  okay 
  basically we want to encompass 
like  old hollywood and what
inspired us to bring us out here
and look at it today
  yeah 
  like all of the haunted horror stories
  or   yeah 
  the grittiness  the realness 
just like all the stuff
that doesn t get talked about
the black dahlia 
the manson cases  
like all those things happened
in our backyard  basically 
and like the old glamour
of hollywood
and everything that
happened here before
and   i mean  marilyn monroe 
and all of these people
and places and their stories 
wsw
yeah  come on  daddy  get on board
  i   i mean  
  daddy 
  what are  
  interesting
okay  we ll begin with number one 
the black dahlia
the black dahlia murder  of course 
elizabeth short was
murdered in a park  
well  not murdered in a park 
but her body was ditched in a park
   why so serious 
  her mouth was slit from  
that s fucking gross
    from ear to ear and she
  it s my birthday  yeah 
was found cut in half
bruised and beaten 
grass had reportedly been
shoved in her vagina 
oh  that s   then we have to go
and then she was sodomized after death 
  wow 
  and then there s dorothy stratten
which is crazy because she was our age
or a little younger even 
she was the 1980 s
playboy  playmate of the year  
  okay
  hey 
  and she was shot and killed by her 
  yeah  that s what i m talking about
     estranged husband 
  are you guys even listening 
  no 
  yes
you re just looking at her picture
stop 
it s kind of gross
if you think about it 
it s more about like the stories
behind all the places 
no no  i m honoring her 
that s why she was a playmate
  i mean i m honoring her life
  that was her job  
this is how she would have
wanted me to remember her
ew  not like that
anyway we want to go
to these places  cause  
  what other houses are there 
  okay  this is   
  name off some beats 
  10881 west clarkson road
los angeles  california  90064 
oh  99064 
  beckett 
  seriously 
  sorry sorry 
  okay okay 
yes  i apologize
and she apparently  like 
haunts the  playboy  offices 
like roses   you can smell roses
when there are no flowers  you can  
  the fax machine will turn on and off
  yeah 
and  i don t know 
there s all these stories behind them
gimme something fucking gross
  gross gruesome 
  sharon tate 
  oh shit 
  murdered by charles manson
  and his followers 
  charles manson is a fucking mass  
before she was murdered 
she had a vision or an experience
where she spotted one ghost
who was paul something or other
who was a theatrical agent
at the house 
and when she ran down the stairs
to flee from said ghost 
she encountered herself
at the bottom of the stairs
and she was bloodied and had
like a rope tied around her neck
and coincidentally that is the way
she was found murdered 
  coincidentally 
  so you re saying
we re just going to go to this house  
i mean  do you even know
if it exists 
  they all exist 
  marilyn s ghost haunts the roosevelt
  um  there s a cafe on the  
  it s real 
  we re in there
  there you go
  which is now
a production company that
thelma todd s  like  apparation  
  or what is it    apparition is there
  apparition 
  she s so cute 
  it s about the realness
it s about the greediness and
the realness and it s in our backyard
and we haven t been
taking advantage of it 
and now instead of going
and paying 70 bucks or 80 bucks a pop
  to go to hollywood horror nights
  i agree 
  it s a good point
  very good point
   so some moron dressed in a freddy
krueger outfit can push you around 
you are quite a pussy
take the camera
it s our turn 
  it s our turn  
  this is clearly a cheap ploy
no  this is our turn
to ask the questions here

this is a list
of houses you have here
and we re gonna drive
to these places   george reeves  
  george reeves 
  exactly 
you guys saying you did this for us 
  yeah

  we did it as us for a group 
  you did spend all day on it
you can t lie 
we do have some  
you guys planned tomorrow 
so we can plan tonight 
you know what  we re going to need
a moment to compile all the evidence
and then hopefully we ll
reach a verdict that favors  
that s fucking gross 
i mean grass in the vagina  you know 
that s a big selling point 
the jury s come to a verdict
really  does the jury care
to spit it out 
yeah  um  we ve decided
upon reviewing all the evidence 
that we ve  
we d really like to go
  we would really like to go 
  yeah  you guys did an excellent job
and you guys are adorable

  oh yeah 
      promising career was snuffed out
she was barely 20
when her life was taken
by her then estranged husband
paul leslie snider
  on august 14th  1980
  that s our age 
    in his west los angeles
apartment on clarkson road
a home they once shared
he got pissed because
he made her a playmate 
and then afterwards
she started falling in love
with a director on one of her
sets called peter bogdanovich 
oh  peter bogdanovich

you know him 
 this enraged snider 
who was obsessed with dorothy
and the lifestyle he thought
was owed to him as her husband

  glass bottle 
  what was that 
  glass bottle 
i think i ran over a glass bottle

  it was the black dahlia
maybe  maybe it was
the second half of her torso
oh wow  that was too soon
too soon 
prepare to turn slightly north
okay anyway 
by summer 1980
the couple had separated  during this
time he carried on his relationship  
she carried on her relationship
with bogdanovich 
even moving in with him
while snider plotted his revenge
snider purchased a shotgun 
talked dorothy into coming over
to discuss a financial settlement
regarding the divorce 
then restrained her
in a homemade bondage device 
sexually assaulting her 
and finally putting the gun
to her face and pulling
the trigger  killing her 
he sexually assaulted her corpse  then
turned the gun on himself and fired

um  okay 
this is the houdini house
and     on a dark night
around 1918 
a full moon was gazing down
upon the hollywood hills 
on a rugged hillside stood
a gothic castle like mansion
that had been built several years before
by the wealthy owner of one
of the city s largest furniture stores
and on one of the night  
er  on halloween
they were having a party
and all of these people
were  like  costumed and going
and his son
decided to escape the party
so that he could go up to   
the back balcony so he could
hang out with his lover 
and it was a time when 
obviously  gay men couldn t
  yeah 
     be known
and  they were having
a romantic moment
and then for some reason
an argument ensued 
the orchestra had just
taken an intermission
when a scream filled the air
the heir to the furniture fortune
had pushed his young lover
off the balcony and his body
now lay in a pool of blood 
30 feet below 
there was no question
as to who had killed the man 
but the father nevertheless
hired the best lawyer
that money could buy
in an effort to save his son 
he spent nearly every dime that he had
paying off policemen  prosecutors
and event   and the event  
he paid off the trial judge himself
finally it was ruled that
there was insufficient evidence
  to prosecute the furniture heir
  how convenient 
    and the man
and the family name were saved
but unfortunately the house was
sacrificed to save the son s life 
and this was not the first tragedy 
or this was the first tragedy
to occur that could be connected
to the gothic mansion 
but it would not be the last
in fact it has been said
that the place is cursed
and that all those who
have occupied the house
were plagued by bad luck
and disaster  
  okay 
   in addition to the murder 
other strange events have taken place
here over the years 
many of those have involved
the man who purchased the house
from the furniture store owner
his name was harry houdini
and he lived in the mansion
during his short career with the
fledgling movie industry in the 1920s
that s so cool   while he lived
in the house and became a frequent
host to séances 
strange experiments and more 
some say this cursed castle
may have finally cost
the famous mag   magician his life
  that s the word 
  when you re holding séances
not   mm hmm
well  apparently
the young lovers cast a spell
i wonder if we can see
the balcony where he fell off
is this the street 
just let these people pass
huh  no  that was the street
we passed it 
  oh 
  i just   i can t park on laurel
that would be really stupid

george reeves  famous for his role
  as tv s superman    
  arrive to destination
    and find him naked and dead
of a gunshot wound to the head 
ruled as a suicide 
reeves  death inspires
a series of conspiracy theories 
and the interpretive biopic
 hollywoodland 
as well as a persistent urban legend
itself famously known
as  the superman curse
the renters revealed that one night
while entertaining guests
in the living room
they heard noises 
the bedroom   reeves  bedroom  
previously neat and orderly was a mess
linens torn off the bed
clothes strewn around
they straightened the room
and returned downstairs
to find that all the drinks
on the coffee tables
had been moved into the kitchen
another time the couple s
german shepherd barked
  at the bedroom door furiously
  at least he s clean 
then suddenly cowered and slunk away
as the tenants peeked inside
and discovered the bed
had been moved across the room
the last straw came
around 3 00 a m  one summer morning
when the apparent ghost of reeves 
dressed in his tv superman costume 
appeared in the living room and within
the hour the tenants had moved out  
is that it 
that s really pretty
  is that his bedroom 
  yeah  that s where he shot himself
holy shit
wait  there s something  
  fuck 
  yeah  well

  proceed to destination  900 feet
900 feet   don t lie
 lights in the kitchen
go on and off by themselves 
while out in the living room
people see strange formless light
in an outline form floating
above  near the ceiling  
  it s a bumpy road 
   in a corner of the living room
near the mailbox  
a small mailbox
she   you know  you can hear 
heavy heart breaking
sobs of a woman  
oh my god  look at this
look at   oh my gosh
okay  i can t see anything now
here  i can get out if you want me to
whoa  that makes everything
look really fucking creepy 
you might want to roll down your window
though  that would be helpful 
and get out of the way
sorry
um  all i can see is a gate too 
so it s not really exciting
should we pull over for a sec 
  we are pulled over
  should we drive  
just pull into the driveway
here  do you want me
to hand the camera to you 
okay 
i think it s relatively
focused for the distance
it s recording 
well
  all right 
  so this is  
what s the name
of this house 
the jean harlow house 
is that right 
  yep 
  just  
this is the house she
moved to after the studio
told her to move to a nicer house
so this is the nice house 
apparently  for the 1930s
look at the mailbox  yeah
place doesn t look lived in
yeah  what does that mean 
that means we should go in
it means we can probably get in 
  go on  beckett
  ridiculous 
  why aren t you parking 
  parking where 
just stop for a second
there s a car coming this way
so pull back in
okay  why don t we get out 
okay yeah  that s great 
i m driving  that s great
you re sort of parked
at the moment 
i m trying to figure out
what we re gonna do 
  are we getting out then 
  yeah 
and looking at this gate
outside just for the sake  
this is the one right here 
it s not the one
next door to this one 
  this is   this is  
  i m highly conf   i m like
  yeah  this is it 
     reviewing our relationship and
  wondering if it s really what i want
  because the one before  
like i m just wondering
now at this point 
is this really what
i wanted with my life 
  right now 
  yes  okay 
  right now 
  yes  okay 
it s henry and emily strawling
they were a loving couple
in their late 20s 
henry was an established
cinematographer
and had photographed
many celebrities from the 1920s
natural eye for lighting
blah blah blah 
 his wife emily also
worked behind the camera
as an up and coming
costume designer 
together they were remembered
as a loving and devoted couple  
et cetera  et ectera 
um   shortly after
they moved into their new home
henry began to become
easily aggravated
and short tempered  never having
a history of this behavior before 
emily discarded it
and figured it was a result 
of the increasing pressures
of his burgeoning career 
however things became worse
he became depressed
talking angrily
with himself and at times
had momentary
outbursts of rage
still emily kept
the matter private 
as she still held on
to the faith that underneath it all
the man she married and fell
in love with was there  
then take next right
um   
okay well  what did
he do that was creepy 
  he was a paranoid schizophrenic
  oh shit 
  okay 
  et cetera  she was pregnant 
eight months pregnant
who didn t know 
so he wasn t on medication
 on october 30th  1931 
emily  eight months pregnant 
henry decided to take the life
of his unborn child 
when emily returned home
that afternoon 
henry is said to have
sedated his wife 
stuffed her mouth with a cloth
and proceeded to cut her stomach open
to remove the unborn child  
why couldn t we just do 
like  a regular hollywood tour 
  see some celebrity houses 
  see the hollywood sign 
with the baby in his hands 
he took its life 
emily eventually bled to death
when he came to 
he realized what he had done
  and took his own life
  arrive to destination
um  he thought that
the baby was the devil
  and it s said it s been  
  is it on the right or the left 
no   uh  
it s over here
pull over right here  i guess

i miss my dad
it s funny
if you think about  
being a kid and how happy
we were and how  like 
the smallest things would
make you happy for days 
like   
a fucking ice cream cone
or a balloon or something 
but i think that was
the favorite part of my childhood
just being with him
i don t know 
i mean  he was there
to drive me to every practice
and every  
every day to school
it s like you get older
and it s funny  cause it takes  
it takes you like 20 years
to realize that shit 
and then one day
you wake up and you just hope
it s not too late 
i just wish he was here 
you know 
i d tell him how much  
how much i appreciate
everything he does 
i wish beckett was here 
i remember the first time
we hung out 
we hiked all the way up to runyon canyon
and we d had a couple drinks 
which i guess wasn t
the best thing to do 
but we climbed the gate
and went all the way to the top
and we just sat up there
for hours 
talking and laughing  and it was
just like  we just found each other
we had our dreams in front of us
we overlooked the city and  
i m here and  
i don t know 
we were just
so full of hope and  
i knew then that
i was so in love with him 
but i couldn t tell him 
it would have been totally weird

everything you need
is everything i need to be
i sit across the room
your breathing starts
to croon to me
very prone to be
a pillar of things
you never will need
so please don t let me go
down old paths and radios for long 
and when the day comes
the dreadful scene approaching
don t leave 
with your hands covering
your face
well  my body is stone cold here
well  don t go
don t leave
don t leave my place
when everything goes dry
remember it s no big surprise
when everything you love
starts messing with your head
and phones drop
well  go ahead  blame me
and push me down the stairs
to the street
i m slowly getting up
my body aches of sunlight inside
and somewhere
far away 
in my mind
i ll dream
and call out loud
without inviting you 
i ve gone too far away
