her mouth was slit from

was found cut in half
bruised and beaten
grass had reportedly been
shoved in her vagina
oh thats then we have to go
and then she was sodomized after death
wow
and then theres dorothy stratten
which is crazy because she was our age
or a little younger even
she was the 1980s
playboy playmate of the year
okay
hey
and she was shot and killed by her
yeah thats what im talking about
estranged husband
are you guys even listening
no
yes
youre just looking at her picture
stop
its kind of gross
if you think about it
its more about like the stories
behind all the places
no no im honoring her
thats why she was a playmate
i mean im honoring her life
that was her job
this is how she would have
wanted me to remember her
ew not like that
anyway we want to go
to these places cause

and i dont know
theres all these stories behind them
gimme something fucking gross
gross gruesome
sharon tate
oh shit
murdered by charles manson
and his followers
charles manson is a fucking mass
before she was murdered
she had a vision or an experience
where she spotted one ghost
who was paul somethingorother
who was a theatrical agent
at the house
and when she ran down the stairs
to flee from said ghost
she encountered herself
at the bottom of the stairs
and she was bloodied and had
like a rope tied around her neck
and coincidentally that is the way
she was found murdered
coincidentally
so youre saying

the realness and its in our backyard
and we havent been
taking advantage of it
and now instead of going

to go to hollywood horror nights
i agree
its a good point
very good point
so some moron dressed in a freddy
krueger outfit can push you around

paul leslie snider
on august 14th 1980
thats our age
in his west los angeles
apartment on clarkson road
a home they once shared
he got pissed because
he made her a playmate
and then afterwards
she started falling in love
with a director on one of her
sets called peter bogdanovich

this enraged snider
who was obsessed with dorothy
and the lifestyle he thought
was owed to him as her husband

okay anyway
by summer 1980
the couple had separated during this
time he carried on his relationship
she carried on her relationship
with bogdanovich
even moving in with him
while snider plotted his revenge
snider purchased a shotgun
talked dorothy into coming over
to discuss a financial settlement
regarding the divorce
then restrained her
in a homemade bondage device
sexually assaulting her
and finally putting the gun
to her face and pulling
the trigger killing her
he sexually assaulted her corpse then
turned the gun on himself and fired

how funny was the cockroach

um okay
this is the houdini house
and on a dark night
around 1918
a full moon was gazing down
upon the hollywood hills
on a rugged hillside stood
a gothic castlelike mansion
that had been built several years before
by the wealthy owner of one
of the citys largest furniture stores
and on one of the night
er on halloween
they were having a party
and all of these people
were like costumed and going
and his son
decided to escape the party
so that he could go up to
the back balcony so he could
hang out with his lover
and it was a time when
obviously gay men couldnt
yeah
be known
and they were having
a romantic moment
and then for some reason
an argument ensued
the orchestra had just
taken an intermission
when a scream filled the air
the heir to the furniture fortune
had pushed his young lover
off the balcony and his body
now lay in a pool of blood
30 feet below
there was no question
as to who had killed the man
but the father nevertheless
hired the best lawyer
that money could buy
in an effort to save his son
he spent nearly every dime that he had
paying off policemen prosecutors
and event and the event
he paid off the trial judge himself
finally it was ruled that
there was insufficient evidence
to prosecute the furniture heir
how convenient
and the man
and the family name were saved
but unfortunately the house was
sacrificed to save the sons life
and this was not the first tragedy
or this was the first tragedy
to occur that could be connected
to the gothic mansion
but it would not be the last
in fact it has been said
that the place is cursed
and that all those who
have occupied the house
were plagued by bad luck
and disaster
okay
in addition to the murder
other strange events have taken place
here over the years
many of those have involved
the man who purchased the house
from the furniture store owner
his name was harry houdini
and he lived in the mansion
during his short career with the
fledgling movie industry in the 1920s
thats so cool while he lived
in the house and became a frequent
host to séances
strange experiments and more
some say this cursed castle
may have finally cost
the famous mag magician his life
thats the word
when youre holding séances
not mmhmm
well apparently
the young lovers cast a spell
i wonder if we can see
the balcony where he fell off
is this the street
just let these people pass
huh no that was the street
we passed it
oh
i just i cant park on laurel
that would be really stupid
okay
all right lets go
leave the parking brake on
2398 remember that number
what did i do with the

oh shit
out of the road
oh shit
book it book it book it
go go go go go
oh dude look at this
holy shit dude
wait how do we get in
this is its got cameras look

and its padlocked
so its not gonna happen

cause after the cameras
i needed the padlock to convince me
look at the cat dude
i know i feel like
it keeps looking at me
jesus
wow
way up this drive
look at this fucking huge house
this is so massive
i would classify this
as a mansion
its freezing out here
its got big fucking spiders on it
i just walked through
a spider web
you should see whats on the cat
private property
right to pass by
permission and subject
to control by owner
lets buzz in

in one of these houses after
if it wasnt 11 25 id buzz in
something happened here
okay lets
what were gonna do
are we gonna take
the sidewalk now

stealth about it

at the home of 45yearold actor
george reeves famous for his role
as tv s superman
arrive to destination
and find him naked and dead
of a gunshot wound to the head
ruled as a suicide
reeves death inspires
a series of conspiracy theories
and the interpretive biopic
hollywoodland
as well as a persistent urban legend
itself famously known
as the superman curse
the renters revealed that one night
while entertaining guests
in the living room
they heard noises
the bedroom reeves bedroom
previously neat and orderly was a mess
linens torn off the bed
clothes strewn around
they straightened the room
and returned downstairs
to find that all the drinks
on the coffee tables
had been moved into the kitchen
another time the couples
german shepherd barked
at the bedroom door furiously
at least hes clean
then suddenly cowered and slunk away
as the tenants peeked inside
and discovered the bed
had been moved across the room
the last straw came
around 300 am one summer morning
when the apparent ghost of reeves
dressed in his tv superman costume
appeared in the living room and within
the hour the tenants had moved out
is that it
thats really pretty
is that his bedroom
yeah thats where he shot himself
holy shit
wait theres something
fuck
yeah well

while out in the living room
people see strange formless light
in an outline form floating
above near the ceiling

in a corner of the living room
near the mailbox
a small mailbox
she you know you can hear
heavy heartbreaking
sobs of a woman
oh my god look at this

reviewing our relationship and
wondering if its really what i want
because the one before
like im just wondering
now at this point
is this really what
i wanted with my life
right now
yes okay
right now
yes okay
its henry and emily strawling
they were a loving couple
in their late 20s
henry was an established
cinematographer
and had photographed
many celebrities from the 1920s
natural eye for lighting
blah blah blah
his wife emily also
worked behind the camera
as an upandcoming
costume designer
together they were remembered
as a loving and devoted couple
et cetera et ectera
um shortly after
they moved into their new home
henry began to become
easily aggravated
and shorttempered never having
a history of this behavior before
emily discarded it
and figured it was a result
of the increasing pressures
of his burgeoning career
however things became worse
he became depressed
talking angrily
with himself and at times
had momentary
outbursts of rage
still emily kept
the matter private
as she still held on
to the faith that underneath it all
the man she married and fell
in love with was there
then take next right
um
okay well what did
he do that was creepy
he was a paranoid schizophrenic
oh shit
okay
et cetera she was pregnant
eight months pregnant
who didnt know
so he wasnt on medication
on october 30th 1931
emily eight months pregnant
henry decided to take the life
of his unborn child
when emily returned home
that afternoon
henry is said to have
sedated his wife
stuffed her mouth with a cloth
and proceeded to cut her stomach open
to remove the unborn child
why couldnt we just do
like a regular hollywood tour
see some celebrity houses
see the hollywood sign
with the baby in his hands
he took its life
emily eventually bled to death
when he came to
he realized what he had done
and took his own life
arrive to destination
um he thought that
the baby was the devil
and its said its been
is it on the right or the left
no uh
its over here

for hours
talking and laughing and it was
just like we just found each other
we had our dreams in front of us
we overlooked the city and
im here and
