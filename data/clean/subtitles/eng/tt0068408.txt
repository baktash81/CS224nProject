oh  yes  sir 
  a circus ape  huh 
  the only one to have been trained
as a bareback rider
in the entire history of the circus 
  circuses are past history 
  not while i live and breathe 
  all right  señor armando  go ahead 
  thank you 
come  come 
  did i do all right 
  yes  yes  yes 
but try to walk a little more
like a primitive chimpanzee 
your arms should move
up and down from the shoulder    like so 
yes  that s better 
after 20 years  you ve picked up
evolved habits from me 
that could be dangerous  even fatal 
  armando  i don t understand 
  listen to me  caesar 
there can be only
one talking chimpanzee on earth 
the child of the two talking apes 
cornelius and zira 
who came to us years ago
out of the future
and were murdered for fear
that one distant day
apes might dominate the human race 
yeah  but outside of you 
nobody even knows i exist 
and we must keep it that way 
for the fear remains 
the mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind 
come  come 
attention  this is the watch commander

but how did it happen 
go  go 
no  no 
go  you go 
but you said humans treated apes
like pets 
  they did  in the beginning 
  they ve made slaves of them 
they all died within a few months 
eight years ago 
every dog and cat in the world 
it was like a plague 
the disease that killed them was a virus
brought back from space by an astronaut 
  didn t the disease affect humans 
  we were immune 
and so  it was discovered  were simians 
even the smallest ones 
that s how it began 
humans wanting little household pets
to replace the ones they had lost 
then  when people realized how quick
they were to learn  how easy to train 
the pets became larger 
and larger  until now   
it s monstrous 
now you understand
why i ve kept you away 
yes  lisa 
a young queen falls for mrs riley 
no 
lisa 
yes 
could you possibly be so kind
as to display it in your window

failure to comply with this order

of your right to bargain collectively 
  what s his job 
  he s a messenger 
for the governor  so get 
no  no  no 
  stop that at once  all of you 
  yes  sir  mr macdonald  we were just   
i saw what you were doing  now sedate
the animal and get him out of here 
  who the hell s that 
  the governor s number one assistant 
  he love apes or something 
  don t it figure 
hold him 
lousy human bastards 
who said that 
i did 
he s a performing ape for my circus 
  a talking ape 
  no  no  no 
no  that s impossible 
it was i who spoke 
it didn t sound like your voice 
yell  lousy human bastards  
  that s not what i said 
  that s what i heard 
now  look  mister 
you yell  lousy human bastards  
  lousy human bastards 
  we said yell 
lousy human bastards 
  yeah  yeah  could be 
  i don t think so 
  it s right  the ape spoke 
  yeah 
no  no  they re mistaken 
i admit my behavior was inexcusable
and i am deeply sorry 
i think we better take him
to headquarters for interrogation 
guard 
move him on 
  armando  forgive me 
  oh  no  no 
you only said aloud what i was thinking 
i m sorry  i was so angry 
i might have bluffed it through
if you hadn t run away 
now they suspect you
of understanding all that was said 
  armando  let s go back to the circus 
  no  no  no 
  oh  no  please 
  no  that s the first place they ll look 
here s what we ll do  i ll go to the police 
  oh  no  no 
  it s the only way 
i ll say that    that i couldn t find you 
that    you ve run away before 
  that big cities frighten you 
  but  armando  where would i go 
you wait right here 
if this works  i ll be back by nightfall 
  but what if they don t let you go 
  oh  they will  they will 
but just in case  if i am not back by then   
now  these steps go down
to a tunnel that leads to the harbor 
cargoes of apes are frequently
unloaded at night 
  you must try to infiltrate one of them 
  but  armando   
apes imported from overseas
arrive naked 
so you ll have to get rid of these clothes 
  well  i don t want to 
  we must have an alternate plan 
right now  the only safe
hiding place for you
is among your own kind 
i shouldn t be long 
why would you say  human  
 human   that s a very odd thing
for another human being to say 
i didn t say  human   mr governor 
i said  inhuman  
lousy inhuman bastards 
and by the blessed st francis 
who loved all animals  i meant it 
  you see  i run a circus   
  we know that 
  from 20 years back 
  since the talking apes arrived on earth
and conceived a baby whose
survival could have threatened
the future of the human race 
mr governor  i understand
the baby was shot dead with its parents 
or so it was believed  mr macdonald 
however  since this morning 
i m beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby 
the apes could have switched
their baby with one from the zoo 
or perhaps a circus 
surely  mr governor  you can t be serious 
hoskyns  the cassette  please 
these are the recommendations made to
the then president of the united states
by the chairman
of the presidential committee 
and we believe that the male and female
talking apes  cornelius and zira 
have come to us out of the future 
we believe their spoken testimony 
that some 2 000 years hence 
their descendants will have all but
exterminated the human race from earth 
and we know that the female ape
is now pregnant with child 
the commission therefore recommends
that the birth of the female ape s
unborn child should be prevented
and that both the male and the female
should be rendered
incapable of begetting another 
but  mr governor  every zoo  public
and private  was searched by the police 
and every circus  including my own 
  but a small chimpanzee was found 
  the only one ever to be born in a circus 
and legally certified
to have been born a month  
a month   before the talking apes
arrived on earth 
  where is he now 
  i wish i knew  i ve searched everywhere 
señor armando 
let me remind you   
of the seriousness of our problem 
now 
your circus travels mainly
in the provinces 
yes  sir 
then  undoubtedly  you are unaware
of the rising tide of disobedience 
the outright defiance  among
the servant apes in our cities 
mr governor  on investigation  many
of the offenses have been proved minor 
the ape killed while trying
to escape from the city last night 
  would you call his offense minor 
  no  sir  i would not 
he physically assaulted his own master 
but only after what must have
been severe provocation 
the ape s body was covered with
welts and bruises inflicted by a beating 
which he no doubt richly deserved 
how many more of them out there
are just like that ape 
all burning with resentment 
or waiting  waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence 
with enough will  to lead them 
waiting for an ape who can think 
who can talk 
señor armando 
has your ape ever talked or shown any
signs of being articulate in your presence 
never in my presence  or anyone else s 
you can question my circus hands 
we intend to 
meanwhile  you will remain in custody

it s very good  morgan  but simplify
the wording in that last paragraph 
sir  we ve received a disappointing
report on the automated sanitation plan 
  you have a meeting with curfew control 
  cancel it  miss greer 
these figures  did you double check them 
  yes  sir 
  triple check them 
  come 
  hold all calls  miss greer 
here s the iq profile on all apes
tested within the last four weeks 
it s risen by 32 3 points 
uh huh  show mr macdonald 
he thinks i m imagining things 
i assembled that 
you summarized the wrong part 
so their output has increased
about the same percentage 
which i thought the governor
might regard as good news 
it s all right  we ll go over that later 
no 
watch 
do 
no  no  no  clean  clean 
it seems the little fella s
not so bright after all 
no  but brightness has never
been encouraged amongst slaves 
oh  don t be so touchy  mr macdonald 
all of us were slaves once 
in one sense of the word or another 
if you feel the ape s unsatisfactory 
we can have him reconditioned 
  that isn t necessary 
  you re quite right  mr macdonald 
but not for any
of your bleeding heart reasons 
reconditioning  that s all
any of you ever think of  isn t it 
don t you realize  if we were to take
every ape who disobeyed an order
and sent him back for reconditioning  ape
management would become overcrowded 
  it s the only thing that has any effect 
  just makes them worse 
some of them couldn t be worse 
i ve been having
a comprehensive list compiled 
  mr governor 
  yes  what is it you want 
it s your meeting
with the defense council 
i ll be along in a moment 
  defense council 
  i ll tell you about it later 
is this related to the list you mentioned 
you ll be given full details  mr macdonald 
meanwhile  we re going
to set a good example
and recondition this fella ourselves 
  we haven t named him yet  have we 
  no  mr breck 
i m going to revive a charming tradition
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife 
and let you name yourself 
 caesar   a king 
yes 
they re waiting for you
in the council chamber 
i don t think we ll ever make
a bartender out of caesar 
have him detailed to the command post 
no 
attention 
there is a report of unescorted apes
in the plaza  investigate 
can i help you  mr macdonald 
this ape s assigned to the command post 
  what s his name  sir 
  caesar 
start him off in the files 
low priority traffic 
yes  sir 
do 
lisa  lisa 
ah  señor armando 
  this way  señor  this way 
  sit down  sit down 
we have good news for you 
  good news 
  yes  you re to be released 
inspector hoskyns and i believe
that your ape
is not the child
of the talking chimpanzees 
  you found him 
  not yet  but he ll turn up sooner or later 
i m sorry for the inconvenience
we had to cause you 
do forgive us  but it was unavoidable 
oh  yes  yes 
then i m    i m free to go 
oh  as soon as you sign
this sworn declaration 
what does it say 
only what you ve been telling us all along 
the circus ape
is incapable of human speech and 
to the best of your knowledge 
he s never uttered a word 
certainly 
excellent  now we ll check this with the
authenticator  then you ll be free to go 
the    authenticator 
it s just a formality  sit back down 
please  it ll just take a moment 
what does the authenticator do 
makes people tell the truth 
it s quite painless 
for example  you said you first
heard the name cornelius in this office 
was that true 
  no 
  now  there  you see 
that s not a bad black mark against you 
you probably heard it
somewhere else before 
now  about your statement 
sworn statement 
that the circus ape is incapable of speech 
  no  i won t submit to this 
  you will  señor armando 
i have done nothing wrong 
you are treating me like a criminal 
sit back  please 
no  no  no 
  guard 
  no 
no 
i knew that circus owner was lying 
they insist he
fell to his death accidentally 
while trying to escape 
he knew he d been exposed 
attention  attention 
last night  several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody
a number of servant apes from widely
scattered households throughout the city 
who had gathered clandestinely
in the unused building
on the outskirts of the east sector 
property owners are firmly warned
that they bear sole responsibility
for the behavior
and whereabouts of their servant apes

mr governor 
the latest ape disobedience figures 
there s been a marked increase
in property damage 
couldn t all be carelessness 
mr macdonald 
arrange for distribution of the achilles list 
copies to each police precinct  details are
to be left to the individual commanders 
but i want every ape on that list
delivered to the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning 
i m sorry  309  the cages are full 
we cannot accommodate any new intakes
until after tuesday s auction 
 collect one repaired colt 45  
and   
100 rounds ammunition 
the achilles list  mr macdonald 
referring to our achilles heel 
contains the name of every ape
who  over the past year 
has been overtly disobedient 
the charge against them is nonsense 
it will do for my purposes 
they constitute
the hard core of our problem
and i m going to crush them
once and for all 
sir  you will only further
aggravate the problem 
this action is folly  and i wish to protest
it in the strongest possible terms 
very well  mr macdonald 
your protest has been duly noted 
from now on  you have but
one assignment  to find that talking ape 
  what is this  a red alert 
  sort of 
ape management computer s
come up with an intriguing error 
shipment 507  i for indonesia  comprised
three orangutans and one chimpanzee 
  so 
  there are no chimpanzees in borneo 
yes  sir 
state security chief
inspector kolp on line three 
yes  inspector 
give me the indonesia file for last month 
that s 507  ex borneo 
right  inspector  let me check 
507  ex borneo  yes  sir  that
chimpanzee was sold to governor breck 
good god  just as i first thought 
we ve had him under our noses
all the time 
sir  i m willing to have the ape executed
immediately on your verbal orders alone 
  you ll have it in writing 
  thank you  sir 
get mr macdonald at the command post 
however  suppose he can speak
but won t 
i don t understand 
the chief inspector means
there d still be a doubt 
if the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut 
the case stays open 
we d like to close the file 
you shall  i promise you 
reconditioning applications
have to be made out in triplicate 
macdonald speaking  yes  sir 
you want me to turn caesar
over to inspector kolp 
is he on your achilles list 
mr macdonald  do not question an order 
no  sir  i m not questioning
the order  it s just that   
well  i sent him out on an errand 
he should be back momentarily 
yes  sir  i ll do just as you say 
come 
  no  this goes to traffic control 
  take it easy  they can t read 
not yet  they can t 
do 
mr macdonald  are you near a phone 
mr macdonald  it is imperative
that you get to a phone 
come in  mr macdonald  do you hear me 
get to a phone and come in 
now  come in 
  yes  mr governor 
  kolp is on his way down with the police 
  is caesar back yet 
  not yet  sir  i ll keep a look out 
notify me the moment
he s handed over to them 
yes  sir 
i wish   
i wish there was some way we could
communicate  so you d understand that i   
i understand 
mr macdonald 
yes  i    i m the one they re looking for 
i never believed it 
i    i thought you were a myth 
well  i m not 
but i will tell you something that is 
the belief that human beings are kind   
no  caesar  there are some   
a handful  perhaps  but not most of them 
they won t learn to be kind
until we force them to 
we can t do that until we are free 
how do you propose to gain this freedom 
by the only means left to us 
  revolution 
  but    it s doomed to failure 
perhaps    this time 
  and the next 
  maybe 
  but you ll keep trying 
  you  above everyone else 
should understand 
we cannot be free until we have power 
how else can we achieve it 
go 
ah  mr macdonald  i have an order from
the governor to take caesar into custody 
i know  i ve been looking for him 
  he s not in the command post 
  no 
issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes 
i still don t see why he made a run for it 
it s really quite simple  mr macdonald 
the ape has intelligence 
he knew that his friend armando
was dead 
he assumed the man first
betrayed him under torture 
but we don t do that    to humans 
now 
talk 
have   
ha    have pity 
that s incredible  well  there s your proof 
we re convinced  mr governor 
it s fantastic  absolutely fantastic 
have him say something else 
you heard the governor 
answer 
  we could persuade him 
  no 
he s not responsible for what he is 
still  seeing him there  it s like
looking at some deadly bacillus and   
knowing you ve got it bottled up at last 
  is that all  sir 
  not quite 
i have an authorization here from
the governor to have this beast destroyed 
i ll notify the vet to inject him 
  he is wired for electrocution  isn t he 
  oh  yes 
well  then  electrocute him  now 
  he s dead 
  good 
  good work  inspector 
  what happened to mr macdonald 
i m afraid his sensibility   
ah  there you are 
  is it over 
  yes  it s over 
shall we go back to work 
lisa 
all keepers and handlers 
attention  attention 
all keepers and handlers 
there is  50 000 worth of apes in jeopardy 
get them out of here    alive 
yes  commander  i understand
the situation 
assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them 
mobilize all security forces 
police  militia and reserve defense units 
see that every entrance
into the city is cordoned off 
will control methods include
tear gas and sedation darts 
there will be but one
control method  shoot to kill 
a small group of apes 
scheduled for intensive reconditioning 
have escaped from ape management 
until they ve been rounded up
by the police 
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors 
a further announcement will be made
as soon as recapture is effected 
and  i guess  here it is 
ape management is in
the hands of the apes 
many officials are either
dead or held hostage 
the main band of rioting apes are
at this very moment marching on the city 
it s been established that
the ape mob is under the command
of a supernormally intelligent
chimpanzee who has   
acquired the power of speech 
that idiot 
get out a retraction immediately 
announce that the talking ape
has been put to death 
   the child of the two talking
chimpanzees  cornelius and zira 
who came to us from
outer space 20 years ago 
as such  he constitutes a threat
to the future of the whole human race 
governor breck has just issued
this order to all civilians 
go to your homes 
stay in your home and lock your doors 
above all  do not panic 
repeat  go to your homes 
stay in your homes and lock your doors 
the situation can be kept under control
provided our defense forces are
given complete freedom of movement 
no  go back 
no  no 
go home 
back 
ready 
aim 
fire 
ready 
aim 
fire 
yes 
yes  understood 
riot control say the apes
have broken through the cordon 
advance units are approaching the plaza 
order units four and six
into action immediately 
riot control 
no 
they ve reached the plaza 
  good god  they re armed 
  and organized 
  no  home 
  don t plead with them  you idiot 
ready 
no 
home 
aim 
fire 
what s the trouble down there 
like wild animals  they re smelling blood 
my god  there s more 
  they re inside the building 
  alert all security posts 
  right  sir 
  no  no 
the circuits are dead 
take a message  to riot control  urgent 
command post under attack 
repeat  command post under attack 
it won t work  sir 
no 
but how  how  they don t have
the intelligence to use such tools 
shoot them  shoot them all 
this is the communication center 
we have no defense 
if we lose this battle 
that s the end of the world as we know it 
we will have proved
ourselves inferior  weak 
and all the groveling cowards left alive
when the battle is over
will be the weakest of all 
this will be the end of human civilization
and the world will belong
to a planet of apes 
no  no  go  go 
caesar 
your servant 
your creature  your animal 
but i saw you die 
the king is dead  long live the king 
tell me  breck  before you die 
how do we differ from the dogs
and cats you and your kind used to love 
why did you turn us from pets into slaves 
because your kind were once
our ancestors 
man was born of the ape 
and there s still an ape
curled up inside of every man 
the beast that must be
whipped into submission 
the savage that has to
be shackled in chains 
you are that beast  caesar  you taint us 
you poison our guts 
when   
when we hate you  we re   
we re hating the dark side of ourselves 
take him 
go 
caesar 
caesar  this is not how it was to be 
in your view or mine 
violence prolongs hate 
hate prolongs violence 
by what right are you spilling blood 
the slave s right
to punish his persecutors 
caesar  i  a descendant of slaves 
am asking you to show humanity 
but i was not born human 
i know  the child of the evolved apes 
whose children shall rule the earth 
for better or for worse 
do you think it could be worse 
do you think this riot
will win freedom for all your kind 
  by tomorrow   
  by tomorrow  it will be too late 
a tiny  mindless insect like the emperor
moth can communicate with another
  over a distance of 80 miles 
  an emperor ape might do slightly better 
slightly 
what you have seen here today 
apes on the five continents
will be imitating tomorrow 
with knives against guns  with kerosene
cans against flame throwers 
where there is fire  there is smoke 
and  in that smoke  from this day forward 
my people will crouch and conspire
and plot and plan for
the inevitable day of man s downfall 
the day when he finally
and self destructively
turns his weapons against his own kind 
the day of the writing in the sky 
when your cities lie buried
under radioactive rubble 
when the sea is a dead sea
and the land is a wasteland
out of which i will lead my people
from their captivity 
and we shall build our own cities in
which there will be no place for humans 
except to serve our ends 
and we shall found our own armies 
our own religion 
our own dynasty 
and that day is upon you    now 
but now   
now we will put away our hatred 
now we will put down our weapons 
we have passed through
the night of the fires 
and those who were our masters
are now our servants 
and we  who are not human 
can afford to be humane 
destiny is the will of god 
and  if it is man s destiny
to be dominated
