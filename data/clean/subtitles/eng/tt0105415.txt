i recently broke up with jennifer 
my last girlfriend 
i did it in a crowded restaurant 
she just stared at me with that look 
 how can you pass me up  
i told her we weren t right 
all the stuff we both knew 
i realized i was wrong  tried to get
back with her  she won t see me 
now she s with tony 
tony knows my friend bailey  who s
friends with tony s other girl  rita 
rita  who i broke up with
to go out with jennifer 
so do i tell jennifer i know
tony s going out with rita   
   or do i tell rita i know
about tony and jennifer 
tony will tell jennifer i was
dating rita when i was with her 
how does stuff get so complicated 
i don t know 
sometimes i wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once 
isn t that great 
i don t know  i think   
cliff  i m talking here  man 
i m back to the beginning 
my dad left home when i was 8 
he said to me 
 have fun  stay single  
i was 8 
my mom s a teacher  she took me
to a doctor to learn about sex 
he was from boston 
the father and the mother
have finally learned to come together 
the father inserts his penis   
you do know what the penis is 
don t you  steve 
the father inserts the penis
into the mother s vagina 
this is called intercourse 
and what comes out is called sperm 
and then  the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis 
 what 
 yeah  what comes out 
 spam 
 oh  man 
so maybe it was never simple 
i ll tell you this   
   for the next three years 
i m going to concentrate on work 
work is the only thing
i have complete control over 
work 
i gotta go 
i m 23  remember how old 23
seemed when you were little 
i thought people would be traveling
in air locks and i d have five kids 
here i am  23 
things are   
they re basically the same 
i think time s running out
to do something bizarre 
somewhere around 25 
bizarre becomes immature 
i get inspiration from my boyfriend 
he s a musician 
his band put out an independent album
last month  he s a good artist too 
he s like a renaissance man 
i m so glad he moved into my building 
janet  what s the ordeal

cliff  you gotta move your truck  man

and when you make the connection 
chemistry takes care of itself 
so sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it s real  this is real

janet  you re spazzing off on me 
hey  cliff  while we re young 
so i ll see you saturday  and then

tonight  i ll fill it 
all or nothing 
tonight  i ll be the super me 
what if the super you meets the super
her  and the super her rejects you 
 then it s no problem 
 why 
because it was never you 
it was just an act 
 i live my life like a french movie 
 what 
webster and 24th  it should be here 
let s ask this clown
where the club is 
hey  man

where s de soto  our car broke down 
i ll tell you about love 
love disappears  baby 
when i ve been broke 
babe has been off like a prom dress

 do i look like a thomas guide 
 you really shouldn t speak 
 yes 
 where do you work 
 i m a ma√Ætre d   
 department of transportation 
 solving the gridlock 
i build airplanes 
 hey 
 hello 
my friend and i have this argument 
and here it is 
he says when you re
at a place like this   
   you can t just be yourself 
you need an act 
so anyway  i saw you standing there   
   so i thought 
a  i could just leave you alone 
b  i could come up with an act 
or c  i could just be myself 
i chose c 
what do you think 
i think that
a  you have an act   
   and that
b  not having an act is your act 
thank you 
cliff  any comments on the seattle
sound and citizen dick s place in it 
i don t like to reduce us just
to being part of seattle 
i think of us expanding more 
we re huge in europe right now 
we ve got records   
a big record just broke in belgium 
a song like  touch me  i m dick 
is about what 
i think  touch me  i m dick   
in essence  speaks for itself 
i think  you know  that s basically
what the song is about 
it s about  you know   
a lot of people might think
it s actually about   
   my name is dick 
and you can touch me   
   but i think  you know 
it can be seen either way 
 hey  excuse me  hello

let me give you a ride back to work 
okay  thanks 
thanks 
i really like your take
on the supertrain 
it s ambitious 
if it were up to me   
she opened my car door button 
unmistakable sign 
i like this girl 
gotta handle this one really well 
the thing i like about you the best
is that you listen to me 
 you re a realist slash dreamer 
 thanks 
i get so pissed off
when i think about it 
that some jerk could trash the mona
lisa or an ocean or someone s life 
so who are your neighbors 
that s bailey  right there 
he s a ma√Ætre d   
he keeps us all on free meals 
and on the corner there 
that s debbie hunt 
she actually consumes men
instead of food 
and that is cliff 
he delivers flowers  has four jobs   
   works in the coffee shop
around the corner 
upstairs is janet livermore 
she works there too  she s
saving for architecture school 
cliff and janet 
that s it 
you sound like me talking
about my family 
wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying 
that s a good picture of you 
let me ask you a question 
you think about traffic 
because i do  constantly  traffic
is caused by the single car driver 
900 000 single people
get in their cars every morning 
they drive and wonder why
there s gridlock 
this is what i ve been working on 
if you had a supertrain   
   you give people a reason to get out
of their cars  coffee  great music   
   they will park and ride 
i know they will 
but i still love my car  though 
well    oh 
the sonics 
they ve got a good team this year 
good thing they traded
xavier mcdaniel 
 is he a boxer or a basketball player 
 you dare to rip the x man 
 kiss at the hotel de ville  
you have this too  i have this 
and albums 
oh  i miss albums 
 i was a deejay in college 
 really 
that s why i still have records 
so any boyfriends 
you don t want to know 
i ve had bad luck 
but there was this one guy  rich 
all my girlfriends loved him 
that stuff i told you
about the money i inherited 
i made that up  plus  i got
back together with lynn last night 
so you probably want to go ahead
and freak out 
oh  man  that was
like a professional hit 
i didn t wanna get close
to anybody for a long time 
and then l   
 i m talking too much 
 no  go ahead 
well  i thought for sure i would
meet someone in college 
a perfect combination of mel gibson
and holden caulfield   
   and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away 
i was a semester too late 
hi 
condoms  they re free 
you know  it s okay
to loathe these people 
really 
there is so much life in you 
and so much emotional larceny
in these others 
 i m andy 
 i m linda 
emotional larceny 
we talked about how passion didn t
matter as much as comfort  stability 
 that s bullshit 
 no kidding 
 sorry 
 it s cool 
we lived together for two years 
we re still friends  but   
i did the same thing 
one day  one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back 
everyone i know wants
everything to be easy 
 why did i have to meet you in a club 
 i don t know 
oh  i love this song 
my clothes 
this is you 
this gas guzzling monster 
the environmentalist 
 i inherited it 
 not sure how i feel about that 
so let s maybe do something
this weekend or   
 okay  i ll call you 
 okay  don t forget 
i won t 
good night 
good night 
good night 
listen  next time  why don t you   
   park underground 
i should go 
grab whatever you can 
keep whatever you want 
it s all yours free 
only at shop for less 
i was just nowhere near
your neighborhood 
burglar  burglar  burglar 
burglar  burglar 
neighbors 
it s andy  just calling
to make sure you re okay 
i was thinking about the conversation 
trust him  although
he s putting on moves 
passive aggressively speaking 
i m a guy 
i don t like that i know them 
but i know 
i think that you can trust him 
but you certainly want to   
if he doesn t treat you right 
i ll kick his ass 
starring fred macmurray 
can you wait 
just a little longer  okay 
 whenever  whenever 
 you re amazing 
i feel like i m being pulled
inside you 
we re being too loud 
what are you thinking
right now 
i play good  hard nosed basketball 
things happen in the game 
nothing you can do 
i don t go and say 
 i m gonna beat this guy up  
 anything else  x 
 yes  steve  don t come yet 
god  i m in love with my neighbor 
why don t you call me  cliff 
what can i eat  i m tired
of starving myself for this guy 
salad  i ll have a salad 
if i call him  that s being desperate 
he s late or he forgot  i refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot 
if he shows up  i ll listen 
no way do i call him 
of course  men do like to be called 
i ll call him in 10 minutes  that will
be one hour  and that is very late 
he is offiicially very late 
if i make this basket 
that s fate telling me to call him 
two out of three 
wait  did no basket mean call him
or don t call him 
busy  that s a sign 
that s fate saying don t call 
forget it  i am not desperate  i have
many people to spend time with 
 quit getting involved with neighbors 
 that broke us up 
 we re better as friends 
 absolutely 
the thing about cliff is 
he has all this fierce integrity 
 i know 
 except when it comes to women 
he likes these club type women   
   these huge  hourglass 
amazon women 
it s great you re together 
but you ve got to protect yourself 
so i m not an amazon woman 
you re from the high plains  janet 
i m so glad i live here 
 are my breasts too small for you 
 no 
god 
because  i mean  i look around 
and all i see are these   
   posters and billboards
and magazines and tv shows   
   all with these women
with huge breasts 
i guess i just   
i guess i just wanted to ask 
is that what men really want 
is that what you want 
you know 
don t lie because when you do  your
eye twitches  and i know it anyway 
okay  ask me 
are my breasts too small for you 
sometimes 
have you had implants before 
what do you think 
no 
yes  well  you take a couple of days
and make up your mind 
we skew the size specifically
to what you want   
   by graph  right 
well  what s painful 
it can be mildly painful  and certainly
safety is on everybody s mind   
   mine in particular 
right  okay  you take a couple
of days and think about it 
all right  bye bye 
 hi 
 hi 
heard you on the phone  i m in

in appearance and also very precise 
if two people really
believe in each other

in fact  if you re both not very
nurturing  that love can 
i m looking for a woman
who is unpredictable 
someone who is complex 
someone who is willing to experiment 
i like the way the world
looks from a bicycle 
i m looking for someone who feels
the same way i do about a bicycle 
am i too intense

i m thinking about   
   how i listened to my instincts  and
they were wrong  the opposite of right

i used to live out by the airport 
underneath the flight patterns 
it was really noisy with the planes
going by all day 
i used to have cookouts  and no one
would come because of the noise 
i got used to it 
and then  when i moved   
   i missed the noise 
i missed those planes 
 cliff  what are you talking about 
 i don t know 
i miss you  the way
you used to look at me   
 don t  i m finally over you
