this postcard somebody sent me once

i dont know i think
cliff im talking here man
im back to the beginning
my dad left home when i was 8
he said to me
have fun stay single
i was 8
my moms a teacher she took me
to a doctor to learn about sex
he was from boston
the father and the mother
have finally learned to come together
the father inserts his penis
you do know what the penis is
dont you steve
the father inserts the penis
into the mothers vagina
this is called intercourse
and what comes out is called sperm
and then the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis
what
yeah what comes out
spam
oh man
so maybe it was never simple
ill tell you this
for the next three years
im going to concentrate on work
work is the only thing
i have complete control over
work
i gotta go
im 23 remember how old 23
seemed when you were little
i thought people would be traveling
in air locks and id have five kids
here i am 23
things are
theyre basically the same
i think times running out
to do something bizarre
somewhere around 25
bizarre becomes immature
i get inspiration from my boyfriend
hes a musician
his band put out an independent album
last month hes a good artist too
hes like a renaissance man
im so glad he moved into my building
janet whats the ordeal

hey
hello
my friend and i have this argument
and here it is
he says when youre
at a place like this
you cant just be yourself
you need an act
so anyway i saw you standing there
so i thought
a i could just leave you alone
b i could come up with an act
or c i could just be myself
i chose c
what do you think
i think that
a you have an act
and that
b not having an act is your act
thank you

i think you know thats basically
what the song is about
its about you know

its actually about
my name is dick
and you can touch me

the thing i like about you the best
is that you listen to me

thanks
i get so pissed off
when i think about it
that some jerk could trash the mona
lisa or an ocean or someones life
so who are your neighbors
thats bailey right there
hes a maître d
he keeps us all on free meals
and on the corner there
thats debbie hunt
she actually consumes men
instead of food
and that is cliff
he delivers flowers has four jobs
works in the coffee shop
around the corner
upstairs is janet livermore
she works there too shes
saving for architecture school
cliff and janet
thats it
you sound like me talking
about my family
wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying
thats a good picture of you
let me ask you a question
you think about traffic
because i do constantly traffic
is caused by the single car driver
900000 single people
get in their cars every morning
they drive and wonder why
theres gridlock
this is what ive been working on
if you had a supertrain
you give people a reason to get out
of their cars coffee great music
they will park and ride
i know they will
but i still love my car though
well oh
the sonics
theyve got a good team this year
good thing they traded
xavier mcdaniel
is he a boxer or a basketball player
you dare to rip the xman
kiss at the hotel de ville
you have this too i have this
and albums
oh i miss albums
i was a deejay in college
really
thats why i still have records
so any boyfriends
you dont want to know
ive had bad luck
but there was this one guy rich
all my girlfriends loved him
that stuff i told you
about the money i inherited
i made that up plus i got
back together with lynn last night
so you probably want to go ahead
and freak out
oh man that was
like a professional hit
i didnt wanna get close
to anybody for a long time
and then l
im talking too much
no go ahead
well i thought for sure i would
meet someone in college
a perfect combination of mel gibson
and holden caulfield
and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away
i was a semester too late
hi
condoms theyre free
you know its okay
to loathe these people
really
there is so much life in you
and so much emotional larceny
in these others
im andy
im linda
emotional larceny
we talked about how passion didnt
matter as much as comfort stability
thats bullshit
no kidding
sorry
its cool
we lived together for two years
were still friends but
i did the same thing
one day one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back
everyone i know wants
everything to be easy
why did i have to meet you in a club
i dont know
oh i love this song
my clothes
this is you
this gasguzzling monster
the environmentalist
i inherited it
not sure how i feel about that
so lets maybe do something
this weekend or
okay ill call you
okay dont forget
i wont
good night
good night
good night
listen next time why dont you
park underground
i should go
grab whatever you can

i was just nowhere near
your neighborhood

its andy just calling
to make sure youre okay
i was thinking about the conversation

hes putting on moves
passiveaggressively speaking
im a guy
i dont like that i know them
but i know
i think that you can trust him
but you certainly want to
if he doesnt treat you right
ill kick his ass
starring fred macmurray

why dont you call me cliff

of starving myself for this guy

if i call him thats being desperate
hes late or he forgot i refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot
if he shows up ill listen
no way do i call him
of course men do like to be called
ill call him in 10 minutes that will
be one hour and that is very late
he is offiicially very late
if i make this basket
thats fate telling me to call him
two out of three
wait did no basket mean call him
or dont call him
busy thats a sign
thats fate saying dont call
forget it i am not desperate i have
many people to spend time with
quit getting involved with neighbors
that broke us up
were better as friends
absolutely
the thing about cliff is
he has all this fierce integrity
i know
except when it comes to women
he likes these clubtype women
these huge hourglass
amazon women
its great youre together
but youve got to protect yourself
so im not an amazon woman
youre from the high plains janet

no
god
because i mean i look around
and all i see are these
posters and billboards
and magazines and tv shows
all with these women
with huge breasts
i guess i just
i guess i just wanted to ask
is that what men really want
is that what you want
you know
dont lie because when you do your
eye twitches and i know it anyway
okay ask me
are my breasts too small for you
sometimes
have you had implants before
what do you think
no
yes well you take a couple of days
and make up your mind
we skew the size specifically
to what you want
by graph right
well whats painful
it can be mildly painful and certainly
safety is on everybodys mind
mine in particular
right okay you take a couple
of days and think about it
all right byebye

id kind of like to leave it up to you
figure out what youd like to do
i think that will be great yeah
youve explained it really well
all right these
are the men who want me
but im more than just a good body
feelings man
i have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman
its hard to get it across
when you look like this
my name is spiro im an artist
my painting is displayed behind me
im a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise
if two people really
believe in each other
love can go around the world
and through their souls
but love is very delicate
in fact if youre both not very
nurturing that love can
im looking for a woman
who is unpredictable
someone who is complex
someone who is willing to experiment
i like the way the world
looks from a bicycle
im looking for someone who feels
the same way i do about a bicycle
am i too intense
i can be intensely laidback too
i am very very very lonely
who
definitely the bicycle guy
the bicycle guy
hes like your soul mate
guy with the bicycle
nice outfit
is he late
yeah
yeah but i expect the best
yeah
why did you pick this sea merchant
