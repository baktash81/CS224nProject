please restrict yourself
to a relevant crossexamination
your honour the applicability
of societal intent
visavis individual action

im citing
minneapolis v higgins
the appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony

that was you
wasnt itjudge weathers
i stand corrected counsellor
objection overruled
ohyou really stooped
to an alltime low on this bombay
im insulted frank

a widdle
okay im taking you down to precinct
breath blood or urine
no thanks im full
okay out of the car now
the charges against mr bombay
are driving under the influence
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment
and to think i almost
stayed home this morning
i assume youre
representing yourself
twelve moving violations in three years
how do you still have a licence
okay lets talk business
what am i facing
suspension of licence
fines what
yes unless the das office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges
but thats solely
up to the prosecutor
the city of minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case
hmm
gotta go for the w right gordo
the defendant is released
on his own recognizance
mr ducksworth
what are you doing here
i own the place
how about you
just goin over a few cases
ricoh statute stuff
oh i thought you might be
researching your defence
against dui
and reckless endangerment
did you think i wouldnt
find out gordon
there was no reason to concern you
with it sir they have no case
frank huddy just wants my scalp i found
a loophole im gonna plead not guilty
gordon stop it
theres not going to be a loophole
theres not going to be a trial
i am not going to have you drag
this firms good name
through the mud
ive talked tojudge weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case
under what conditions
probation suspension of your drivers licence
and 500 hours
of community service
and a leave of absence
from the firm
a leave of absence
he cant do that
he cant stop me from working
hes not i am
that was my condition
gordon you need a break
youre too wrapped up in your work
but sir my work is my life
thats just my point
the community service will do you good
itll teach you compassion
a sense of fair play how to fit in
community service this is horrible
youll get used to it
and hopefully youll come back
a better person and a better attorney
which is why im keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you
you know in the early 7 os i drove the
tour bus for the grand funk railroad
man that was the life
chicks parties

my dad died that year
the two are not related
no but it felt like they were
i found this not long ago
he was proud of you
i miss him
you scored 198 goals
in that season gordon
its a shame you quit you
could have gone all the way yeah
no
you really loved to play
you remember you remember
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark
until your father
called you back
you really flew
on that ice gordon
thats all i ever wanted to do
then why did you stop reilly
i saw what he did to you
reilly is an idiot
the guy wins
its not about winning it never was
just show they how to play show them
how to have fun teach them to fly
that is what theyll remember long after
youve gone back to being a doctor
lawyer
and long after theyve stopped
buying skates from me
here there you are
sharpened laced ready to go
whats this
your new skates
that is why you came here
tonight isnt it
i figured nine and a half was your size

oh really
doortodoor mistreatment now
now the team can feel miserable
between games too huh
i came to apologize to charlie
to both of you
what
apologize
well you should
charlie
somebodys here to see you
hey charlie how ya doin
i was just uh walkin
around thinkin and uh
wanna give us a minute
thank you
youre welcome
listen it was
very wrong of me
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat
i never should have said to you what i
said to you i was angry i was frustrated
it took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right i admire that
and uh i just wanted
to tell you that uh
that im
oh boy this is difficult
im
youre sorry
im sorry
im sorry all right
tell your mom that hopefully itll be
a lot more fun this time around
what do you say
do you want to stay for dinner
what
charlie
uh no i
i cant uh
well what are you havin
mr ducksworth
there are two reasons i came by
first off i want to let
you know things are going well
im learning a lot about teamwork
fair play and all that junk
good good
and the second thing
well sir
fair play doesnt come cheap
these kids my team
have no money
they cant afford rink time
safe equipment proper uniforms
which makes it difficult
for them to compete
now imagine sir being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice
with old copies of the  enquirer
taped to your shins instead of pads
the point im trying to make sir
is that you wouldnt be taken seriously
and neither are these kids
so i thought maybe
the firm could help em out
how much are we talking about
15000
no way
wait a minute think of the goodwill
we name the team after the firm
suddenly were the good guys
ducksworth saver and gross
the firm that gives back
to the community
come on
ill get you your own jersey

that tie of yours might be what you need
to make the playoffs
the ducks have a shot
at the playoffs  sure
everyone but the last two teams
are in remember
panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season
soyou beat the huskies
and youll make the playoffs
well we might have to play the hawks
so
so theyre a tough team
nothings changed since i played
actually one little thing
has changed
you wouldnt even be a hawk now
they redrew the district
lines last year
the lake is not
the boundary any more
you see youd be a duck
id be a duck
excuse me coach reilly
yeah
im afraid theres a bit of a problem
whats that
one of your players is ineligible
banks over here
this is a joke right
im afraid its no joke
problem
nojust a mistake
are you this boys father 450 north
hennipen is that your address
yes
im afraid theres no mistake
this boy is playing for the wrong team
what
according to league rules adam banks
should be playing for district five
my son is a hawk not a duck
is this your doing gordon
ill expect to see him
at our next game
well have a uniform waiting for you
no way
my son would rather not play
than play for your team
fine if thats the way
you want it but remember
if adam plays for the hawks youll forfeit
every game for the rest of the season
boy id hate to see that
look im sorry this had to happen
but you can see on the map
gordon hey bombay
you stop when
im talking to you son
whats the idea here
you trying to sabotage me or what
the laws a bitch when it
works against you isnt itjack
you got a whole team of bankss
one kid isnt gonna make a difference
even with banks what do you think youre
gonna prove you and that bunch of losers
thats right coach
they are losers
we hate losers dont we
they dont even deserve to live
maybe banks wont make a difference
but at least were playing by the rules
whyd you turn against me
gordon for six years
i taught ya how to skate
i taught ya how to score
i taught ya how
to go for the w
you could have been
one of the greats

we dont need him
im the coach i say we do need him
if we make it to the playoffs
he could be a big help  if
all of a sudden you dont
think were good enough

thats what he told reilly
what
we heard what you said
you said we were losers
we didnt deserve to live

here to try to work out this little problem
you see my son adam
wants to play for the hawks
his older brother was a hawk
all of his little friends are hawks
thats where he belongs
its a tradition you understand that
gordon you played
but the leagues
already ruled on it
weve talked to the league
and we worked out a little deal
you guys cut a deal with the pee wee hockey league
yes we did
the long and short of it is that adam stays
on the hawks for the rest of the season
and then next year
they redraft the lines
correctly
the league did make one condition
whats that
that you withdraw your protest
thats great
good good
well thats settled then
no sir you dont understand
i cant withdraw my protest
what
mr ducksworth
you wanted me to learn
about fair play
and how to be part
of a team
and i may not have
learned everything yet
but i remember something
my father said to me
a team isnt a bunch
of kids out to win
a team is something
you belong to
something you feel
something you have to earn
and im not gonna
let those kids down
gordon im going
to make this simple
