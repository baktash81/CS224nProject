no tomorrow  duluth  in the hawks zone 
looking for a chance to win it 
only a few seconds remain 
there s a pass out to the blue line 
intercepted by gordon bombay 
bombay  he s got a breakaway 
across the blue line all alone
for a chance to win the game 
he s pulled down from behind
by fox of duluth 
fox definitely pulled him down
from behind and this could be  
yes  the referee calls
for a penalty shot 
gordon  it s up to you  i don t wanna
see any goats around after the game 
you got it 
now  you miss this shot   
you re not just lettin  me down 
you re lettin  your team down 
apressure situation he s in now 
the 1973 pee wee state
championship now rests   
on the little shoulders
of number 9  gordon bombay 
gordon  gordon 
let s go  son 
all right 
he hit the goalpost 
what a heartbreaker 
little gordon bombay
had the chance  
all my client did was attempt
to give you what you wanted 
isn t that right 
this man put his neck
on the line for your greed 
objection  your honour 
will both counsellors
approach the bench 
what s he doing 
i don t have anything to tell you 
i just wanna make a point 
so nod like i m saying
something important 
  mr  bombay 
  gordon  what are you doing 
  get out there and be my lawyer 
  perfect 
this drives him nuts
and i love it 
nice tie  frank 
you wore that yesterday  didn t ya 
oh  mr  bombay 
i m so glad you could make it 
please restrict yourself
to a relevant cross examination 
your honour  the applicability
of societal intent   
vis a vis individual action
is well established 
i m citing
minneapolis v  higgins 
the appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony 
now  if i m not mistaken 
that was    you 
wasn t it judge weathers 
i stand corrected  counsellor 
objection overruled 
oh you really stooped
to an all time low on this  bombay 
i m insulted  frank 
you have no idea how low i can stoop 
i don t mind losing 
i would just like to lose fair 
losing fair is still losing  frank 
gotta go for the  w  every time 
and what about justice 
that man should be in jail 
it was your job to put him there 
don t take it out on me 
next time do your job 
frankie boy

i guess it was a  widdle  noisy 
a  widdle  
okay  i m taking you down to precinct 
breath  blood or urine 
no  thanks  i m full 
okay  out of the car  now 
the charges against mr  bombay
are driving under the influence 
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment 
and to think i almost
stayed home this morning 
i assume you re
representing yourself 
twelve moving violations in three years 
how do you still have a licence 
okay  let s talk business 
what am i facing 
suspension of licence 
fines  what 
yes  unless the d a  s office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges 
but that s solely
up to the prosecutor 
the city of minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case 
  hmm 
  gotta go for the  w   right  gordo 
the defendant is released
on his own recognizance 
mr  ducksworth 
what are you doing here 
i own the place 
how about you 
just goin  over a few cases 
ricoh statute stuff 
oh  i thought you might be
researching your defence   
against d u i 
and reckless endangerment 
did you think i wouldn t
find out  gordon 
there was no reason to concern you
with it  sir  they have no case 
frank huddy just wants my scalp  i found
a loophole  i m gonna plead not guilty  
gordon  stop it 
there s not going to be a loophole 
there s not going to be a trial 
i am not going to have you drag   
this firm s good name
through the mud 
i ve talked tojudge weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case 
  under what conditions 
  probation  suspension of your driver s licence   
and 500 hours
of community service 
and a leave of absence
from the firm 
a leave of absence 
he can t do that 
  he can t stop me from working 
  he s not  i am 
that was my condition 
gordon  you need a break 
  you re too wrapped up in your work 
  but  sir  my work is my life 
that s just my point 
the community service will do you good 
it ll teach you compassion 
a sense of fair play  how to fit in 
  community service  this is horrible 
  you ll get used to it 
and hopefully you ll come back
a better person and a better attorney 
which is why i m keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you 
you know  in the early  7 os i drove the
tour bus for the grand funk railroad 
man  that was the life 
chicks  parties 
amps cranked up to about
eight jillion decibels

i d just as soon forget it 
that was the worse time in my life 
my dad died that year 
  the two are not related 
  no  but it felt like they were 
i found this not long ago 
he was proud of you 
i miss him 
you scored 198 goals
in that season  gordon 
it s a shame you quit  you  
  could have gone all the way  yeah 
  no 
you really loved to play 
you remember  you remember   
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark 
until your father
called you back 
you really flew
on that ice  gordon 
that s all i ever wanted to do 
then why did you stop  reilly 
i saw what he did to you 
reilly is an idiot 
  the guy wins 
  it s not about winning  it never was 
just show they how to play  show them
how to have fun  teach them to fly 
that is what they ll remember long after
you ve gone back to being a doctor 
lawyer 
and long after they ve stopped
buying skates from me 
here    there you are 
sharpened  laced  ready to go 
  what s this 
  your new skates 
that is why you came here
tonight  isn t it 
  i figured nine and a half was your size 
  actually  i m a nine 
wear thick socks  gordon 
enjoy them 
here comes bombay
on an end to end rush 
past the blue line  past centre 
he s not skating  he s flying 
he fakes once 
he fakes twice 
fakes three times 
shoots  scores  yes 
yes  yes  yes 
what a play 
what a guy 
gordon bombay does it again 
great move  gordy 
you faked him out of his pads 
come here  son 
you look great out there  come on 
let s go inside  get something to eat 
a few more minutes 
please 
  go on  get outta here 
  thanks 
  hi  uh     please just go
away  charlie doesn t want   
to be on the team any more  and neither
he nor i have anything to say to you 
  well  i have something to say to you 
  oh  really 
door to door mistreatment now 
now the team can feel miserable
between games too  huh 
i came to apologize to charlie   
to both of you 
  what 
  apologize 
well    you should 
charlie 
somebody s here to see you 
hey  charlie  how ya doin  
i was just  uh  walkin 
around thinkin  and  uh  
wanna give us a minute 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
listen  it was
very wrong of me   
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat 
i never should have said to you what i
said to you  i was angry  i was frustrated 
it took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right  i admire that 
and  uh  i just wanted
to tell you that  uh 
that i m  
oh  boy  this is difficult 
  i m  
  you re sorry 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  all right 
tell your mom that hopefully it ll be
a lot more fun this time around 
what do you say 
do you want to stay for dinner 
  what 
  charlie 
uh  no  i  
i can t  uh  
well  what are you havin  
mr  ducksworth 
there are two reasons i came by 
first off  i want to let
you know things are going well 
i m learning a lot about teamwork 
fair play and all that junk 
good  good 
and the second thing 
well  sir 
fair play doesn t come cheap 
these kids  my team 
have no money 
they can t afford rink time 
safe equipment  proper uniforms 
which makes it difficult
for them to compete 
now imagine  sir  being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice   
with old copies of the   enquirer 
taped to your shins instead of pads 
the point i m trying to make  sir 
is that you wouldn t be taken seriously
and neither are these kids 
so i thought maybe
the firm could help  em out 
how much are we talking about 
   15 000 
  no way 
wait a minute  think of the goodwill 
we name the team after the firm 
suddenly  we re the good guys 
ducksworth  saver and gross 
the firm that gives back
to the community 
come on 
i ll get you your own jersey 
  ooo yeah  
  can you feel it baby
ooo  
 i can too  ooo  
  ooo  
  ooo  come on swing  
  come on swing  
  come on swing  
  c come on swing
ooo  
  ooo  
 it s such a good vibration  
 it s such a sweet sensation  
 it s such a good vibration  
 it s such a sweet sensation

hey  you don t wanna be ducks  you d
rather be district five  some stupid number 
better than some stupid animal 
i ll have you know  peter 
that the duck is one of the most noble 
agile and intelligent creatures
of the animal kingdom 
  but they re wimpy 
  they don t even have teeth 
neither do hockey players 
have you guys ever seen a flock
of ducks flying in perfect formation 
it s beautiful  pretty awesome
the way they all stick together 
ducks never say die 
ever seen a duck fight 
no way  why 
because the other animals are afraid 
they know that
if they mess with one duck 
they gotta deal
with the whole flock 
oh  man 
i m proud to be a duck 
and i d be proud to fly
with any one of you 
so how about it

aaah 
whoa 
whoo  yeah 
that tie of yours might be what you need
to make the play offs 
  the ducks have a shot
at the play offs    sure 
everyone but the last two teams
are in  remember 
panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season 
so you beat the huskies
and you ll make the play offs 
  well  we might have to play the hawks 
  so 
so they re a tough team 
nothing s changed since i played 
actually  one little thing
has changed 
you wouldn t even be a hawk now 
they redrew the district
lines last year 
the lake is not
the boundary any more 
you see  you d be a duck 
i d be a duck 
excuse me  coach reilly 
  yeah 
  i m afraid there s a bit of a problem 
  what s that 
  one of your players is ineligible 
banks  over here 
  this is a joke  right 
  i m afraid it s no joke 
  problem 
  no just a mistake 
are you this boy s father  450 north
hennipen  is that your address 
  yes 
  i m afraid there s no mistake 
  this boy is playing for the wrong team 
  what 
according to league rules  adam banks
should be playing for district five 
  my son is a hawk  not a duck 
  is this your doing  gordon 
i ll expect to see him
at our next game 
  we ll have a uniform waiting for you 
  no way 
my son would rather not play
than play for your team 
fine  if that s the way
you want it  but remember 
if adam plays for the hawks  you ll forfeit
every game for the rest of the season 
boy  i d hate to see that 
look  i m sorry this had to happen 
but you can see on the map 
gordon  hey  bombay 
you stop when
i m talking to you  son 
what s the idea here 
you trying to sabotage me or what 
the law s a bitch when it
works against you  isn t it jack 
you got a whole team of banks s 
one kid isn t gonna make a difference 
even with banks  what do you think you re
gonna prove  you and that bunch of losers 
that s right  coach 
they are losers 
we hate losers  don t we 
they don t even deserve to live 
maybe banks won t make a difference 
but at least we re playing by the rules 
why d you turn against me 
gordon  for six years   
i taught ya how to skate 
i taught ya how to score 
i taught ya how
to go for the  w  
you could have been
one of the greats 
and now look at yourself

going to the play offs  whoo

i got some good news 
we re getting a new player 
adam banks 
what 
  he s a hawk 
  he s a good player 
  yuck 
  everybody hates him 
  we don t need him 
  i m the coach  i say we do need him 
  if we make it to the play offs 
he could be a big help    if 
all of a sudden you don t
think we re good enough 
no  he thinks we re losers 
that s what he told reilly 
  what 
  we heard what you said 
you said we were losers 
we didn t deserve to live 
  that s not what i meant 
  i saw that picture of you missing that goal 
you were a hawk  weren t you  guess
you guys stick together to the end 
you know what 
i don t need your stinkin equipment

in the end of the third period 
i get a penalty shot 
i go in  i triple deke 
i fake the goalie right out of his pads 
the puck s headed in 
and then   
clang  hits the post 
we lost in overtime 
a quarter of an inch this way
and it would have gone in 
a quarter of an inch  charlie 
yeah  but a quarter inch the other way
and you d have missed completely 
i never thought of it that way 
at least you got to play
in a championship game 
  that must ve been so cool 
  hey  can i get you a cup of coffee

already ruled on it 
we ve talked to the league 
and we worked out a little deal 
  you guys cut a deal with the pee wee hockey league

the long and short of it is that adam stays
on the hawks for the rest of the season

they redraft the lines 
  correctly 
  the league did make one condition 
what s that 
that you withdraw your protest 
  that s great
