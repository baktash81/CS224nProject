thank you 
second item 
lest i remind you  this is coyote season 
that s right 
these are ruthless
and desperate creatures 
rule number one  stay in groups 
rule number two  stay inside
the perimeter of the fence at all times 
and number three  be careful out there 
okay  let s hit it 
and leaving quickly  walking out 
walking out  step  step  step wider   
otis  why don t you stick around

right up your   
okay  that s nice  dad 
  sit 
  and i m sitting 
okay  first off 
i don t even want to know
who was on the other end of that phone 
  it was the gophers  wasn t it

where were you this morning  otis

what s the big deal  they re coyotes 
them tiny  us big 
what are they gonna do 
you have a lot to learn

that fence defines our space 
and as long as i m still kicking 
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence

okay  if you re trying to groom me
to be the big leader 
just give it up  it s not me  pop
