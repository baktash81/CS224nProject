with a gun pointed in your side

new york  new york
i am sorry 
i did awaken you 
do they sing a lot where you live 
yes  we sing 
do you ever get hungry 
empty here 
like a car needs gas 
yes 
this body has a terrible emptiness 
this is called  hungry  
yeah  and when people get hungry
they have to eat food 
eat  yes  we must do that 
we will stop at food station 
you have hungry  too 
i m starving 
i haven t eaten since   
oh  my god 
look out  what are you doing 
okay 
okay  are you crazy 
you almost got us killed 
you said you watched me 
you said you knew the rules 
i do know the rules 
for your information  pal 
that was a yellow light back there 
i watched you very carefully 
red light  stop  green light  go 
yellow light  go very fast 
  you better let me drive 
  i will drive 
do you seriously expect me
to tell the president
that an alien has landed 
assumed the identity of a dead
housepainter from madison  wisconsin 
and is presently out
tooling around the countryside
in a hopped up
orange and black 1977 mustang 
we have the following givens  look 
that man  scott hayden  died last april 
he s dead and buried  that s verified 
he has no brothers  no look alike cousins 
but still  this morning 
at approximately 6 00   
all right  we have been through all of that 
i m going to ask you now 
how could it happen 
we think it might be
some kind of a cloning deal 
replication of an entire organism
from a single cell 
we found some hairs
from scott hayden s head 
but is that possible 
i mean  can you clone a living organism
from the hair of a dead man 
well  human hair
consists of keratinized cells 
although  i suppose  in order to determine
whether replication is possible  you have   
mark  i asked you a question 
you mean us 
  in our present state of technology 
  yes 
  no 
  well  what the hell are we talking about 
we re hypothesizing a technology
that s probably 100 000 years ahead of us 
we re the ancients  mr  fox 
ancients 
technologically  yes  we ve just started 
yeah  but even if you re right 
i still have problems 
i mean  his knowledge of english 
okay  listen to this 
i helped put this package
together  you know 
this was designed
so that an intelligent species
could get a working knowledge of english 
enough to get by  anyhow 
a couple hundred word vocabulary 
a rough idea of syntax 
think of what it would mean to talk
to a being from a civilization like that 
think of what we could learn 
   of 147 member states
who represent almost all
of the human inhabitants of the planet earth 
i send greetings   
 greetings   there  see  that s what he said
to heinmuller out on the road 
it s also what the cannibal said
to the missionary just before he ate him 
now  well  the question in this case is 
who is the missionary
and who are the cannibals 
when do you have to be there 
what 
in arizona  when do you have to be there 
do you see this little star 
star  what star  where 
there 
we call that the sun 
when this little   
when the sun
appears mid sky three more times 
i must be at arizona 
you mean  12 00 noon 
three days from now 
yes 
what happens if you don t get there in time 
then they will go 
  without you 
  yes 
what will you do then 
then i will die 
die 
understand 
you look for food station 
what 
a deer 
a dead deer 
dead deer  why 
people hunt them to eat for food 
do deer eat people 
no 
do people eat people 
no  of course not 
what do you think we are 
i think you are a very primitive species 
what are you  softhearted 
cry when you saw bambi

you don t speak any english  huh 
steer clear of that bozo

are you supposed to meet your friends 
here 
west of winslow 
i see a little speck on the map  but there s   
crater 
is that where you re supposed to meet them 
where that meteor hit 
why do you do this 
well  better safe than sorry 
just in case something
should happen to me 
now  there s one more thing 
the credit card  for the gas 
  you know how that worked 
  why should something happen to you 
who knows 
the way you drive  traveling with you
could be detrimental to the health  now   
that s me and scott on our honeymoon 
a honeymoon is what you call it when
two people first get married and they
go off together after they ve fallen in love 
define  love  
love is   
it s when you care
more for someone else
than you do for yourself 
but it s not just that  it s   
it s when someone is a part of you 
and when they   
what 
scott is dead 
he was killed in an accident 
when someone you love dies

damn it  sergeant 
we ve been here since 6 30 this afternoon 
now  when can we leave 
as soon as the federals say so 
and not one damn minute before 
everybody tells it pretty much the same way 
she had every chance in the world
to get away from him 
but they left together with her driving 
now  does that sound like any kind
of kidnapping you ever heard of 
mr  shermin 
they spotted an orange and black
mustang  wisconsin plates
  going west near big springs 
  great 
scott and i met two winters ago
up at iron mountain  ice skating 
i had on this little tight skating outfit 
i was showing off  he kept staring at me 
one thing led to another 
a few months later
we were on our honeymoon 
honeymoon is nice 
yeah  ours was beautiful 
define  beautiful  
beautiful is better than terrific 
better than dutch apple pie 
the best 
the best 
gotta get a couple of hours sleep 
just a couple  okay 
you re not to approach them 
keep them under surveillance
till the feds get there 
but what if they approach us 
if you re in some kind of life threatening
situation  defend yourselves 
otherwise  wait for the feds 
wait for the feds 
they get the 6 00 news 
and we get the shit end of the stick 
that s the way it is 
yeah  well  it doesn t have to be that way 
i got a hunch this might just develop
into a life threatening situation 
hi  we d like a room for the night
as far away from this as possible 
boy  am i whipped 
my mom always said there wasn t a thing
wrong with the world that a hot bath
and a good night s sleep couldn t fix 
what am i doing 
i must be getting punchy 
it s just that in that light
you look so much like scott 
  i wasn t thinking 
  you said the nose is different 
what 
you said   your nose is different 
 he broke his twice 
 and there s something else  i don t know 
something spooky about your eyes  
that s word for word 
you remember everything you hear
word for word 
everything i hear  everything i see 
everything i   
everything this body feels 
the tub 
thirty points apiece
is what the questions will be worth 
so  jane nelson  tell us about it 
your final category today is   
believe me  general 
i know what went wrong 
the x factor wasn t red 
i never knew it could be like this 
nobody ever kissed me the way you do 
nobody 
no  nobody 
not even one 
out of all the men you ve been kissed by 
well  that ll take some figuring 
how many men you think there ve been 
i wouldn t know 
can t you give me a rough estimate 
not without an adding machine 
you have your adding machine with you 
i forgot to bring it 
then i guess you won t find out  will you 
hey there  buddy  are you in there 
hey  buddy  it s none of my business 
but if that s your orange mustang
out in the parking lot

we re still going to be okay 
all we gotta do is rent a car 
and with a little luck
we ll be back there before noon tomorrow 
just try not to be too conspicuous  okay 
come on 
half a million dollars  folks 
who s gonna take it home 
hit the giant jackpot
and your troubles are over 
half a million dollars  folks 
define  giant jackpot  
a giant jackpot is a lot of money 
money  geetus  bread  an arm and a leg 
where did you get that 
we don t have time
to fool around with the slot machines now 
we gotta find a rent a car place and   
where s my wallet 
  my wallet 
  what is wrong 
where the hell is my wallet 
what are we gonna do now 
is all right 
but you don t understand 
no credit card  no money  no car 
no car 
we re never going to get there on time 
is all right 
now 
damn 
that s a handy little talent you got there 
but you better spread it around a little 
these guys get kind of curious
if you hit too many jackpots at once 
choppers from the air cav
will search the area on a quarter mile grid 
  good  i m glad you re here 
  what the hell is this about 
you re a man of some scientific attainment 
you mean to tell me you don t recognize
an emergency autopsy room
when you see one 
with leather tie straps 
you behave yourself  mark 
is this your latest update 
according to norad 
his original course and rate of descent
would have taken him here 
  south of winslow 
  i see  anything else 
the cobra guys
were asking about ammunition 
helicopter attack units
will carry live ammo at all times 
  this is to be considered a combat mission 
  right 
listen  mr  fox 
i d like to be a team player and all of that 
but there s something that i want
to call to your attention 
if there s one thing i don t need from you 
it s a lecture on morality 
all right  okay  screw morality 
what the hell ever happened
to good manners 
we invited him here 
  i don t have time for this  shermin 
  i m trying to make a point 
so am i  damn it 
you make a great show of being a rebel 
but the fact is this 
you are a gs 11 public servant 
anytime that becomes
too much of a burden 
you can go back to cornell  or wherever
the hell it was that we found you 
and let s see you make it through
on an instructor s salary 
now shape up or get out 
is that clear 
mr  fox  there s been
a possible sighting in las vegas 
they re probably headed in this direction 
well  let s establish a command post
at winslow

providing of course you still want
to be a member of the team 
you do  don t you

it is beautiful 
not like this  but it is beautiful 
there is only one language 
one law  one people 
and there is no war  no hunger
and the strong do not victimize the helpless 
we are very civilized 
but we have lost something  i think 
you are all so much alive  all so different 
i will miss the cooks
and the singing and the dancing 
and the eating 
and the other things

  that ll be fine 
  and whipped cream

to get to the crater from here 
driving  not long  five  six minutes is all 
i want you to try this cherry cobbler 
and if you don t like it 
you don t have to pay for it 
it s delicious
