picture it
youve got an imagination
go ahead
what i see is a small town
in the midwest
handful of churches
some places for the farmers
to get drunk together
maybe a salon
for their wives to do their hair
on the holidays
i visit these places
these are the people
who send us our profits
who send us your wages
i make movies judy
but its your job
to give those people dreams
the economys in the gutter
and they pay for you
and ill tell you
something else
in every one of those towns
believe me
theres a girl
whos prettier than you
maybe their nose is a little
thinner at the bridge
they have better teeth than you
or theyre taller
or theyre slimmer
only you have something
none of those pretty girls
can ever have
you know what that is
no sir
man you have that voice
itll maybe take you to oz
someplace none of those pretty
girls can ever go
still im told youre unhappy
judy
well no sir not unhappy
id just maybe like a little
more time
time for what
i dont know
maybe to go to the pictures
like those other girls do
the thing is those other girls
will grow up to be cashiers
and farmers wives
and elementary school teachers
and theyll see their skins
roughed up through housework
is that what you want judy
to be just a housewife
to be just a mother
out there
youd have to put away
that voice of yours
forget it exists
but here with us
with your family
that voice will make you
a million dollars
before youre 20
those average kids
theyre all loved in their way
i can see how you
may be drawn to it
from time to time
their small lives
not too dangerous
not too exciting
theyre where they belong
and maybe you feel like
youre like them
but really youre not
you live in another world
entirely
they just look like you
but if you truly wanna
go join them
its your decision
well shake hands and you
can walk through our gates
i guarantee its all there
the rest of america
just waiting to swallow you up
and forget all about you
like a raindrop
falling into the pacific
who cares who even notices
of course i wanna stay
with the studio lb
any girl would kill
to be dorothy
im just terribly sorry if
i didnt even say anything
to anyone
mayer
