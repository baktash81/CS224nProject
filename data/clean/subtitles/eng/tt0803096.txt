can be remembered
but there was once a time
when we did not even know
who our enemy was
or what that evil green magic
the fel had done to us
but in the beginning
how could we have known
what choice did we have
our world was dying
and i had to find my clan
a new home
durotan
i can feel your eyes
i thought you were asleep
i was
dreaming of a hunt
through the snow
i thought of a name
well keep it to yourself wife
ill choose a name
when i meet him
or her
oh
and how will the great
durotan name his son
if i do not travel with him
a son
can you hide your fat belly
better than you can
hide your fat head
so many clans from one place orgrim
laughing skull black rock
all have been summoned
it will be a mighty warband
i just wonder
whos left to fight
loktar ogar
victory or death
victory or death
black rock over there
how much longer blackhand
we are ready guldan
help me
my child please let him go
i beg you
what did she say
she begs for you
to free her child
but i need him
i need all of them
move half breed
what is that
guldans magic
the fuel of my magic is life
we only have enough prisoners to
send through our strongest warriors
but that will be enough
the enemy is weak
when we arrive
we will take them as fuel
we will build a new portal
and when it is complete
we will bring through all
of the horde
let me go first
for the horde
with child
you dare bring that burden
into my war band
let me go blackhand draka
push little one push
my son
a new warrior for the horde
warcraft
irongorge
lothar come
i have got something for you
what is it
a mechanical marvel
its a boomstick
odd
take water
you might want to
head home big man
someone has attacked
one of your garrisons
it seems your king
needs you commander
stormwind
the entire garrison
and no one saw anything
we did find someone
he was searching the bodies
here in the barracks
in the barracks
finally are you in command
thats the mark of the kirin tor
what are you doing in my city
spell chucker
let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall
now why would i do that
within that body is the
secret to your attacks
what was that
you must summon the guardian
medivh
it should be he who explains it
only the king summons the guardian
get him to goldshire
what kind of beasts
rumors your majesty
how does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper
the fel
or at least its influence
is this him
your majesty
dad
thank you son
so who are you mage
my name is khadgar
im a guardian novitiate
i was i renounced my vows
you mean youre a fugitive
im not hiding
your majesty
i may have left my training but
i didnt leave my abilities behind
i senses something
dark forces when its strong it
almost has a smell
knowing that something so evil was
so close i couldnt just ignore it
whats going on out there
smoke sir the southeast
your majesty i urge you to engage
the guardian with all haste
theyve reached elwynn forest
the grand hamlet is burning
an attack
what
stop requesting callan
stay out of my business
he wants to follow in
his fathers footsteps
my son doesnt need your help
tread carefully when
you talk to your queen
you are my sister first
when was your last visit to karazhan
with you
i dont know 6 years
and you had no contact
with medivh since
not for the lack of trying
well
he cant hide from us now
the guardian is summoned
get on
good luck
okay
let me go
frostwolves do not join the hunt
we prefer our enemies armed
with an axe not a child
we have been commanded durotan
respect the old ways
there must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap
find them all
try not to kill too many
we need them alive
lothar
moroes
look at you
you havent aged a bit
where is everyone
many things have changed
the power that must be locked away here
the knowledge
where is he
i didnt know so many books
even existed
wait here
and try not to touch anything
he sees no one
the worlds been at peace
good you are here lothar
it would do the guardian
a world of good
to see a friendly face
beyond this old one
he cant refuse you
nor king wrynn
not if hes summoned
chop chop
did you summon him moroes
no he did not
so you become a sculptor
im making a golem
it usually takes years of magic
to sip into the clay but up here its
much faster
makes someone to keep moroes company
help to clean up around the house
thank you
its good to see you lothar
we need your guidance medivh
our king summons you
whos the boy downstairs
hello
guardian
have a good look around
getting some ideas what you are going to
do with the place once its yours
guardian ive renounced my vow
i didnt want to come here
i swear guardian
i urged them to find you
i told them
you should be
the one to explain
explain what
fel
in azeroth
in the barracks
one of the bodies
guardian what is the fel
a magic unlike any other
it feeds on life itself
it pollutes the user
twisting everything it touches
it promises great power but
it exacts a terrible price
there is no place for
the fel in azeroth
youve done the right thing
well go
hey go home you
step in
medivh
your grace
it has been too long
come
help us get to the roots
of these troubles about
what kind of beasts
they are saying giants
armed giants
wolves to carry them
huge unstoppable monsters
what are the other kingdoms
are they suffering the same
all seek our protection yet not trust
us enough to tell us anything
we know nothing about
these so call monsters
we need prisoners
even a corpse
can tell us something
i dont know what danger
were in medivh
i exist to protect this realm my lord
it is my very purpose
i am the guardian
at least for the time being anyhow
yes
what are we going to do about
what is his name
khadgar sire
hell be coming with us
well then
we better get going
elwynn forest
halt
it cant be
what is this
cant tell from the look of it
guardian
close ranks
watch your back
victory or death
watch the flank to your left
watch your flank
watch your flank
to your left
guardian
now you die you beast
dont try and take them on
with brute force
they are stronger be smarter
the fel
theyre all dying
only the green ones
kill that big bastard
durotan move
guardian
guardian what did you do
i was right wasnt i
its here
where are you going
get these men safely back to stormwind
ive to return to karazhan
you did well today
wheres the guardian
karazhan
we need a prisoner
wheres your horse
uh they took my horse
really
just stay there
how much do you
love your master
ill do it
back off
pity
it would have make a good coat
over here
you took it alone
yes
looks like the runt to the litter
you what are you
and why do you attack our lands
he does not know what you speak
you speak our language
speak one more word
in their language
and i will wear your tongue
i will not warn you again
tell him to stop
you tell him
youre welcome
have you a name
you understand our language
again have you a name
garona
she calls herself garona
what kind of being are you
she seems more like us
than those beast we fought
orc
orc
thats what you are
or the beast in the cage was
i know every races in the seven kingdoms
ive never heard of orc
show me where you come from
this is not orc world
orc world is dead
orcs take this world now
not from this world
how did you get here
the great gate
deep in ground and through
magic brought us here
but how did you learn our language
orc take prisoner for the gate
i learn from them
prisoners
our people are they alive
yes
many
why
to feed the gate
to bring the horde
to take your world
youll take us to them
no
youll take us to them or you will
end up like your friend in the cage
you think you are fearsome
orc children have pets
more fearsome than you
were not trying to be fearsome garona
we are trying to protect
our people our families
if you help us
i give you my oath
you will have your freedom
fearsome blackhand
warchief of the horde
you have allowed the smallteeths
to kill your warriors
worse
you shamed your people
by running from an enemy
are you too weak
to talk destroyer
the horde has no use
for weakness
respect our tradition warchief
you know the penalty
death
done
you dare interrupt this judgment
we fought hard
their warlock use
your fel against us
only i can control the fel
i see you and
your men have survived
perhaps blackhand kept you
safely away from the battlefield
maybe he knows you are weak too
do you wish to challenge me
little chieftain
i do not question guldan
but the fel is born of death
must have a price
a price paid in lives taken
will you hold your son
he will be a great chieftain
like his father a born leader
i was no leader today
he challenges you already
if guldan can infect
born as innocent as he
what chance do
the rest of us have
whatever happens
whatever happens
i see you
this gate
who showed it to guldan
who lead him to azeroth
guldan call him a demon
did you see it
not the face but the voice
like fire and ash
ill be here if you need me
your mate
i could kill you before
he even reaches me
lothar
he is my brother
the king is my mate
you are the chieftains wife then
i suppose so
then killing you will bring
me even greater honor
not among my kind
it is a cold night
i thought you might use these
it will warm you
more of our villages burned tonight
one of them is
the village of my birth
i can not imagine what horrors
you have been through garona
but this does not
need to happen
we have peace in these lands
for many years now
peace between races
from all over the world
what is this
i can have it removed
there is a life here
for you garona
with us a life of freedom
if you want it
the great gate
from light comes darkness
and from darkness light
well thats clear
ask alodi
alodi
ahh
its good to see trees again
and the snow
even from a distance
remember when we would track
blood ox through the frostwind dunes
there was always meat
always life
you dont think its strange
that we lost our home when
guldan came to power
one orc could not
kill a world durotan
are you sure
look around you
does it not remind you of something
wherever guldan works his magic
the land dies
if our people are to make
a home here my friend
guldan must be stopped
we are not powerful
enough to defeat guldan
no
no
but with the humans help
we could be
i want that weapon
youll have me to protect you
i need no one to protect me
what are you looking at
bookworm take the first watch
respectfully commander
my name is khadgar
my deepest apologies khadgar
you see i thought
we bonded when
i didnt put you in a prison cell
for breaking into royal barracks
now take the watch
well
at least youre not reading
he wishes to lie with me
i beg your pardon
you will be injured
i dont want to lie with you
good
you would not be
an effective mate
why do you laugh
i cant see how you humans
survive such a thing
no muscles to protect you
brittle bones that break
you dont look that
different to us
how did you survive
broken bones heal stronger
mine are very strong
im sorry
do not be
my name garona
it means cursed in orc
my mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me
they kept you alive though
guldan did
he gave me her tusk
to remember her
my parents gave me to the kirin tor
when i was 6 years old
thats the last time i saw them or
any of my brothers and sisters
it brings a family honor
to offer a child to the kirin tor
to have their son taken up
to the floating city of dalaran
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land
less so to have them run away
well that was cheerful
the great gate
why do they need
so many prisoners
like wood for a fire
green magic takes life
to open the gate
how many more orcs are
they planning on bringing
all of them
this is just a warband
when the portal is open
guldan will bring the horde
get them back to stormwind
we ride ahead
garona we should go
its not safe
durotan
to the north there is a black rock
that touches the sky
i would meet with their leader
to challenge him
i saw you lead the smallteeths
to our encampment
they have seen
what is being built
and only you know what
guldan has planned for my people
his magic is death
to all things
he must be stopped
tell him the black rock
when the sun is highest
i will
chieftain
if i returned would you
take me into your clan
youre safer here with them
is it as you feared
the fel is everywhere
then you mustnt leave again
they need the guardians help
now more than ever
maybe the boy can help
we need solution
easy for you to say
the dwarf enforgers must work overtime
you treat us no better than dogs
we shall supply you no more
enough
you have all called on stormwind in
the past either for troops or arbitration
if we do not unite to fight
this enemy we will perish
stormwind needs soldiers
arms horses
ha we have our own
kingdoms to look after
fight your own wars
your majesty
commander
the orcs are building a portal through
which they plan to bring an army
if we do not stop them now
we may never get another opportunity
where is he
where is the protector of azeroth
where the guardian
where is medivh
my liege
i suggest we take a recess
take as long as you like
were done
commander
whats left of the 4th
has retreated from stonewatch
whats left
callan is among the injured
dad
im fine its fine
you had me worried
wheres the rest of your troop
they took most of them alive
well get them back
dont be in such a hurry
youre all i have
i know im a soldier
he would not ask for this meeting if
he thought he could defeat guldan alone
the fel must truly terrified him
durotan is scared of nothing
the location
the suddenness of this meeting
sounds like a trap
it is not
could be
it is not
could be
it is not
what do you think
its too good an
opportunity to ignore
i think we have no choice
we must stop the orcs
from opening the portal
but we will need help
and if hes lying
orcs do not lie
what if he is
there is no honor in it
and wheres the honor
in him betraying his own people
durotan is protecting his clan
his enemy is the fel
guldan is the betrayer
this orc durotan
how do you know him
he freed me
and he is loved by his clan
hes a strong chieftain
strong chiefs must earn
their clans trust
if we are to expect you
to join us
we must earn yours
to defend yourself
with this
yes
find the guardian
what is this
guardian
uh
the gate
we saw it in the morass
ive been putting together
all the clues i can about it
this this drawing
where did you copy it from
guardian
and this
and this and this
ive been researching ever since
i felt the presence of the fel
i am the guardian me not you
not yet
i just thought you might
appreciate some help
dont presume you can help me
you have no idea the forces
i contend with
if you want to help
protect the king
you leave the fel to me
interesting choice
guardian
pack up and move
to the west gate
you there
pack up your stall
and get moving now
i need your help
i found a book
of course you did
there was an illustration
that showed the gate
like the one we saw being built
sorry sorry
khadgar
listen i tried to show the guardian
but he became furious
he burned all my research
he would have burn this too
if i hadnt hidden it in my robe
no turn the page here
look
see
what do you think
the image means
the orcs were summoned
from this side of the gate
they were invited in
and the guardian
burned your research
hes probably just
trying to protect you
now go away
good spot for an ambush
our sentries are well placed
i will check again
you asked to speak
with the humanking
here he stands
i am the king llane
im told you wished to talk
ask him if they plan
to return to their home
our world is destroyed
there is nothing to go back to
we are not responsible
for destroying your world
war with us will solve nothing
he says
orcs war solves everything
then why is he here
to save my people
fel takes life from
more than its victims
kills the earth and
corrupts those who use it
guldan will poison everything
with his death magic
if my people are to survive
guldan must be destroyed
in 2 suns the humans
we have captured
be used to fuel the portal
if you attack our camp
and draw his warriors away
frostwolf clan will kill him
two days
if we do this
you will protect my people until then
i will try
its a trap
traitor die
retreat
back return to our camp
fall back
stay together
focus like old times
cover your flank
spread out
swords
you alright
you are no good to us dead go
ill get the others
fall back
were all getting out
medivh will cover our retreat
fall back
garona
stay together
fall back
go on now
wheres the bloody guardian
protect the king i got them
move back
shield formation
retreat to the plateau
fall back
up the hill move
medivh
medivh take it down
medivh
hold on son
dad
for azeroth
medivh
stop
no
callan
hes here
whats wrong with him
we need to get him to karazhan
ill get the horses
you wont make any time by road
take one of my birds
place him in the font
moroes whats wrong with him
i told him not to leave karazhan
i have to go
we need the help of
the karin tor now
go
there are medicines i must prepare
sit with him
you and the baby must leave now
youre a traitor durotan
no
one who values what we once were
like you used to
that time is past
we are but fuel for the fel now
there is still hope blackhand
our children
do not make me take more
innocent lives young chieftain
if i submit
will you let my people be
what will i call our son
goel
you
wheres the older man
he told me to watch you
the king
he is alive
lothars son is dead
i argued for the meeting
lothar will hate me
this upsets you
he is a great warrior
he defends his people well
a good mate for an orc
i am no orc
i am no human either
when i was younger
i used to feel apart from my kin
i traveled far and wide
looking for wisdom
feel a connection with all the souls
i was charged with protecting
on my travel i met
a strong and noble people
among them a female
who accepted me for what i was
who loved me
it was not a life
i was fated to have
but it taught me something
if love is what you need
you must be willing to travel
to the end the world to find it
you left your mate
go find lothar
step inside the circle
this is my gift to you
garona
a whole world and
exchange for a statue
gods are strange creatures
frostwolves you are a practical people
those of us from the south have
always admired that about you
when the portal opens
when the rest of the horde join us
we will give them the fel
all of them
durotan did not agree to this
and why would you care
what that traitor thinks
it is time for a new leader
of the frostwolf clan
one who has the best interest
of his orcs in mind
one who appreciates guldans vision
his power
come
i will grant you the fel
durotan he has poisoned
the frostwolves against the fel
let me gather them
bring them here
grant me the fel in front of them
let them see
how much stronger i become
as i said a practical people
this is a new dawn
the time of the horde
be feared or be fuel
im sorry
callans mother
died in childbirth
i blamed him for it for years
im not going to blame you
he was so young
in my entire life
i have never felt
so much pain as i do now
guldan does not want to waste
his power on the frostwolves
burn them
take the weak kill the strong
ill bathe in your blood
maybe but not now
i cant give you long
but i can give you a head start
for the sake of your son draka
leave now
you should have trusted in your
chieftain orgrim doomhammer
wait for me
khadgar
how dare you to come here
get out
i come seeking your wisdom
there is nothing
for you here now
the guardian medivh is unwell
what
hes been poisoned by the fel
what
ridiculous
what do you know
of the dark portal
you come back
and accused the guardian
what is alodi
how does he know
alodi
what is it
an entity from a time
before the kirin tor existed
we think it serve the functions
similar to that of the guardian
protector
no one beyond the arch council knows of
its existence and it will stay that way
and you to mention it
in the same breath
as the dark portal is
too much to be mere
coincidence
do i go in
i dont know
its never done that before
khadgar
i know you from the library
youre alodi
i used the last of my energies
to summon you here
the guardian has betrayed us
medivh
i saw the fel in his eyes
he is consumed by it
if he is not stopped
this world will burn
i dont have the power
to defeat a guardian
guardian is but a name
the true guardians of this world
are the people themselves
i know you see what
the kirin tor can not
its why you left them
no one can stand against
the darkness alone
i dont understand what
you want me to do
yes you do
trust in your friends
together you can save this world
always remember
from light comes darkness
and from darkness light
up up
thank you moroes
youll recover guardian
you always do
no thank you
for everything youve done
sorry old friend
it seems i have let
the orcs into this world
the fel has twisted me i
dont even know
what else i may have done
i just dont remember
everything i fought to protect
i have destroyed
i cant control the fel
no one can
five legions to block deadwind pass
another ten here here and here
along redridge mountains
supply lines here
while the eastern sea hems
them in both south and east
if we hold these positions
we will be at our strongest
containment
until there is a better option yes
and where there is
10 times as many
what then
if there were easy answers
our priority must be
to stop the gate from opening
fail there and its
just a matter of time
before they beat us
with sheer numbers
what do you suggest
send everything we got
destroy the gate free our people
and end the immediate threat
and the orcs that remain
well take care of them later
after theyve ravaged the entire kingdom
my lords
medivh you are up and well
i am i feel restored
we need you
weve been agonizing over our options
some of us believe
there are no options
we need fresh eyes
i have news
ive met with durotan
you met with durotan
the rebellion against guldan
is gaining strength
with their help we can
destroy this gate
that doesnt change my plan
what plan
anduin believes we should
attack with full force
im concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless
how many legions would you need
to hold the orcs in place
five for deadwind pass
ten for the redridge mountains
ten more to protect the city
weve already lost 18 legions
that leaves one two three
can it be done medivh
no it cant be done
with three legion
frostwolves and my power
with all due respect guardian
your powers
have proven unreliable
at best recently
llane have i ever let you down
let him down
where have you even been
for the last 6 years
please anduin
medivh is the guardian
not the one you remember
hes lost it hes unstable
and he wont be there
when you really need him
find your bearings anduin
id march into hell for you
if i thought there was a
slightest chance of victory
but there isnt
this is suicide
is this about callan
it was a tragedy
if he hadnt been trying so hard
to win your approval
he might still be with us
medivh
callan wasnt ready
you knew it
and you let him play soldier anyway
anduin stop
you killed him
commander please sir please
varis
take him to a cell to calm down
you are no use to us like this
well protect the kingdom my lord
you and i
why are you here
the king
he goes to fight the horde
with your guardians help
durotan will kill guldan
dont trust him
ive told you orcs do not lie
not durotan
dont trust medivh
i will try to protect your king
dont go with them
why
i dont want you to get hurt
come back alive
hey frostwolf
who goes
now you are enemies
with all sides
ill tell them it was you
what happened
im sorry durotan
i did not see how we could
side with the humans
against our own kind
i was wrong
guldans fel magic is destroying us
wheres draka safe
but the rest
they wont follow him
if they could see
what he has become
and i will show them
there is no other man i would entrust
the safety of my family to varian
keep them safe while im gone
ready
i would feel better if
lothar were riding with us
well be fine
ill return to karazhan
and get ready for battle
find me at the portal
whoa whoa whoa whoa
guard
i know youre just doing your job
and a good one at that
but ive cool down now
so if you just come
and open this gate
so i can protect the king
open the gate
i am just following my
where the hell have you been
the kirin tor
it only works on the simple minded
last about a minute
your armor commander
sorry
they have a full day
ahead of us
i just hope were not too late
we cant go after them
not if you want to save azeroth
my king needs me
azeroth needs you more
if you want to save your king
we need to stop medivh first
where is medivh
we got a demon to kill
go search over here
remember
you are the son of
durotan and draka
an unbroken line of chieftains
i am durotan son of garad
chieftain of the frostwolf clan
and i am here to kill guldan
ghost cannot invoke makgora
duel of honor
you are the chieftain
of no clan
your people are food for worms
some of us still live warchief
do i make a quick end of them
i always thought you were
one for tradition blackhand
durotan
your clan was weak
and you are a traitor
i accept your challenge
if only to personally
ripped the heart out
of your pathetic body
what of the portal
you must be ready when
the incantation begins
this wont take long
crush him guldan
its the incantation
to the orc home world
hes opening the portal
we need to shut him up
the incantation
i have no time for this
blackhand
orc tradition
this is a makgora
duel of honor
you will respect our tradition
keep fighting
guldan cheats
cheating
shame on you
you cheat guldan
this is not our way
traitor
guldan
you have no honor
you will follow this thing
do you
you will follow this demon
i will not
i follow a true orc
a chieftain
may your balls rot demon
anyone else
and you warchief
you will take the fel
and you will become stronger
than any orc has ever been
and when the fel has remade you
you will crush the smallteeth
now claim my new world
legion halt
frostwolves
we are on our own now
with you then
get to the prisoners
we will free our people
charge
attack
ideas
very impressive
now try shutting him up
oh that went well
ohhhhh
hes moving do something
what
fine ill handle this
you take care of medivh
hey over here clayface
now men
fire
come my orcs
let the fel unleash the
full power of the horde
for guldan
for the horde
hey kid wake up
you alright
quick thinking
slicing its head off like that
yeah
just how i planned it
what now
the guardian has to speak
the incantation himself
so uh
as long as he is doing that
we can get in close
