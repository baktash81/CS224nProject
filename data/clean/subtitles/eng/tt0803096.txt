can be remembered 
but there was once a time 
when we did not even know
who our enemy was 
or what that evil green magic 
the fel  had done to us 
but in the beginning 
how could we have known 
what choice did we have 
our world was dying 
and i had to find my clan
a new home 
durotan 
i can feel your eyes 
i thought you were asleep 
i was 
dreaming of a hunt 
through the snow 
i thought of a name 
well  keep it to yourself  wife 
i ll choose a name
when i meet him 
or her 
oh 
and how will the great
durotan name his son 
if i do not travel with him 
a son 
can you hide your fat belly 
better than you can
hide your fat head 
so many clans from one place  orgrim 
laughing skull  black rock 
all have been summoned 
it will be a mighty warband 
i just wonder
who s left to fight 
lok tar ogar 
 victory or death  
victory or death 
black rock  over there 
how much longer  blackhand 
we are ready  gul dan 
help me 
my child  please let him go 
i beg you 
what did she say 
she begs for you
to free her child 
but i need him 
i need all of them 
move  half breed 
  what is that 
  gul dan s magic 
the fuel of my magic is life 
we only have enough prisoners to
send through our strongest warriors 
but that will be enough 
the enemy is weak 
when we arrive 
we will take them as fuel 
we will build a new portal 
and when it is complete 
we will bring through all   
of the horde 
let me go first 
for the horde 
with child 
you dare bring that burden
into my war band 
let me go  blackhand  draka 
push  little one  push 
my son 
a new warrior for the horde 
warcraft
irongorge
lothar  come 
i have got something for you 
  what is it 
  a mechanical marvel 
it s a boomstick 
odd 
take water 
you might want to
head home  big man 
someone has attacked
one of your garrisons 
it seems your king
needs you  commander 
stormwind
the entire garrison 
and no one saw anything 
we did find someone 
he was searching the bodies 
here  in the barracks 
in the barracks 
finally  are you in command 
that s the mark of the kirin tor 
what are you doing in my city 
spell chucker 
let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall 
now why would i do that 
within that body is the
secret to your attacks 
what was that 
you must summon the guardian 
medivh 
it should be he who explains it 
only the king summons the guardian 
get him to goldshire 
  what kind of beasts 
  rumors  your majesty 
how does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper 
the fel 
or at least it s influence 
is this him 
your majesty 
dad 
thank you  son 
so who are you  mage 
my name is khadgar 
i m a guardian novitiate 
i was  i renounced my vows 
you mean you re a fugitive 
i m not hiding 
your majesty 
i may have left my training but
i didn t leave my abilities behind 
i senses something 
dark forces  when it s strong it   
almost has a smell 
knowing that something so evil was
so close i couldn t just ignore it 
what s going on out there 
smoke  sir  the southeast 
your majesty  i urge you to engage
the guardian with all haste 
  they ve reached elwynn forest 
  the grand hamlet is burning 
an attack 
  what 
  stop requesting callan 
stay out of my business 
he wants to follow in
his father s footsteps 
my son doesn t need your help 
tread carefully when
you talk to your queen 
you are my sister first 
when was your last visit to karazhan 
with you 
i don t know    6 years 
and you had no contact
with medivh since 
not for the lack of trying 
well 
he can t hide from us now 
the guardian is summoned 
get on 
good luck 
okay 
let me go 
frostwolves do not join the hunt 
we prefer our enemies armed
with an axe  not a child 
we have been commanded  durotan 
respect the old ways 
there must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap 
find them all 
try not to kill too many 
we need them alive 
lothar 
moroes 
look at you 
you haven t aged a bit 
where is everyone 
many things have changed 
the power that must be locked away here 
the knowledge 
where is he 
i didn t know so many books
even existed 
wait here 
and try not to touch anything 
  he sees no one 
  the world s been at peace 
good you are here  lothar 
it would do the guardian
a world of good
to see a friendly face
beyond this old one 
he can t refuse you   
nor king wrynn 
not if he s summoned 
chop chop 
did you summon him  moroes 
no  he did not 
so  you become a sculptor 
i m making a golem 
it usually takes years of magic
to sip into the clay  but up here it s   
much faster 
makes someone to keep moroes company 
help to clean up around the house 
thank you 
it s good to see you  lothar 
we need your guidance  medivh 
our king summons you 
who s the boy downstairs 
hello 
guardian 
have a good look around 
getting some ideas what you are going to
do with the place once it s yours 
guardian  i ve renounced my vow 
i didn t want to come here 
i swear  guardian 
i urged them to find you 
i told them   
you should be
the one to explain 
explain what 
fel 
in azeroth 
in the barracks 
one of the bodies 
guardian  what is the fel 
a magic unlike any other 
it feeds on life itself 
it pollutes the user 
twisting everything it touches 
it promises great power but
it exacts a terrible price 
there is no place for
the fel in azeroth 
you ve done the right thing 
we ll go 
hey  go home  you 
step in 
  medivh 
  your grace 
it has been too long 
come 
help us get to the roots
of these troubles about 
  what kind of beasts 
  they are saying giants 
armed giants 
wolves to carry them 
huge unstoppable monsters
what are the other kingdoms 
are they suffering the same 
all seek our protection yet not trust
us enough to tell us anything 
we know nothing about
these so call monsters 
we need prisoners 
even a corpse
can tell us something 
i don t know what danger
we re in  medivh 
i exist to protect this realm  my lord 
it is my very purpose 
i am the guardian 
at least for the time being anyhow 
yes 
what are we going to do about   
what is his name 
khadgar  sire 
he ll be coming with us 
well then 
we better get going 
elwynn forest
halt 
it can t be 
  what is this 
  can t tell from the look of it 
guardian 
close ranks 
watch your back 
victory or death 
watch the flank to your left 
watch your flank 
  watch your flank 
  to your left 
guardian 
now you die  you beast 
don t try and take them on
with brute force 
they are stronger  be smarter 
the fel 
they re all dying 
only the green ones 
kill that big bastard 
durotan  move 
guardian 
guardian  what did you do 
i was right  wasn t i 
it s here 
  where are you going 
  get these men safely back to stormwind 
i ve to return to karazhan 
you did well today 
  where s the guardian 
  karazhan 
we need a prisoner 
where s your horse 
  uh  they took my horse 
  really 
just stay there 
how much do you
love your master 
i ll do it 
back off 
pity 
it would have make a good coat 
over here 
  you took it alone 
  yes 
looks like the runt to the litter 
you  what are you 
and why do you attack our lands 
  he does not know what you speak 
  you speak our language 
speak one more word
in their language 
and i will wear your tongue 
i will not warn you again 
  tell him to stop 
  you tell him 
you re welcome 
have you a name 
you understand our language 
again  have you a name 
garona 
she calls herself  garona 
what kind of being are you 
she seems more like us
than those    beast we fought 
orc 
orc 
that s what you are 
or the beast in the cage was 
i know every races in the seven kingdoms 
i ve never heard of orc 
show me where you come from 
this is not orc world 
orc world is dead 
orcs take this world now 
not from this world 
how did you get here 
the great gate 
deep in ground and through
magic brought us here 
but how did you learn our language 
orc take prisoner for the gate 
  i learn from them 
  prisoners 
our people  are they alive 
yes 
  many 
  why 
to feed the gate 
to bring the horde
to take your world 
you ll take us to them 
no 
you ll take us to them or you will
end up like your friend in the cage 
you think you are fearsome 
orc children have pets
more fearsome than you 
we re not trying to be fearsome  garona 
we are trying to protect
our people  our families 
if you help us 
i give you my oath 
you will have your freedom 
fearsome blackhand 
warchief of the horde 
you have allowed the smallteeths
to kill your warriors 
worse 
you shamed your people
by running from an enemy 
are you too weak
to talk  destroyer 
the horde has no use
for weakness 
respect our tradition  warchief 
you know the penalty 
death 
done 
  you dare interrupt this judgment 
  we fought hard 
their warlock use
your fel against us 
only i can control the fel 
i see you and
your men have survived 
perhaps blackhand kept you
safely away from the battlefield 
maybe he knows you are weak too 
do you wish to challenge me 
little chieftain 
i do not question  gul dan 
but the fel is born of death 
must have a price 
a price paid in lives taken 
will you hold your son 
he will be a great chieftain 
like his father  a born leader 
i was no leader today 
he challenges you already 
if gul dan can infect
born as innocent as he 
what chance do
the rest of us have 
whatever happens 
whatever happens 
i see you 
this gate 
who showed it to gul dan 
who lead him to azeroth 
gul dan call him a demon 
did you see it 
not the face  but the voice   
like fire and ash 
i ll be here if you need me 
your mate 
i could kill you before
he even reaches me 
lothar 
he is my brother 
the king is my mate 
you are the chieftain s wife then 
i suppose so 
then killing you will bring
me even greater honor 
not among my kind 
it is a cold night 
i thought you might use these 
it will warm you 
more of our villages burned tonight 
one of them is
the village of my birth 
i can not imagine what horrors
you have been through  garona 
but this does not
need to happen 
we have peace in these lands
for many years now 
peace between races
from all over the world 
what is this 
i can have it removed 
there is a life here
for you  garona 
with us  a life of freedom 
if you want it 
the great gate 
from light comes darkness
and from darkness  light 
well  that s clear 
ask alodi 
alodi 
ahh 
it s good to see trees again 
and the snow 
even from a distance 
remember when we would track
blood ox through the frostwind dunes 
there was always meat 
always life 
you don t think it s strange
that we lost our home when
gul dan came to power 
one orc could not
kill a world  durotan 
are you sure 
look around you 
does it not remind you of something 
wherever gul dan works his magic 
the land dies 
if our people are to make
a home here  my friend 
gul dan must be stopped 
we are not powerful
enough to defeat gul dan 
no 
no 
but with the humans help 
we could be 
i want that weapon 
you ll have me to protect you 
i need no one to protect me 
what are you looking at 
bookworm  take the first watch 
respectfully  commander 
my name is khadgar 
my deepest apologies  khadgar 
you see  i thought
we bonded when
i didn t put you in a prison cell
for breaking into royal barracks 
now take the watch 
well 
at least you re not reading 
he wishes to lie with me 
i beg your pardon 
you will be injured
  i don t want to lie with you 
  good 
you would not be
an effective mate 
why do you laugh 
i can t see how you humans
survive such a thing 
no muscles to protect you 
brittle bones that break 
you don t look that
different to us 
how did you survive 
broken bones heal stronger 
mine are very strong 
i m sorry 
do not be 
my name  garona 
it means  cursed  in orc 
my mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me 
they kept you alive though 
gul dan did 
he gave me her tusk
to remember her 
my parents gave me to the kirin tor
when i was 6 years old 
that s the last time i saw them or   
any of my brothers and sisters 
it brings a family honor
to offer a child to the kirin tor 
to have their son taken up
to the floating city of dalaran
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land 
less so  to have them run away 
well  that was cheerful 
the great gate 
why do they need
so many prisoners 
like wood for a fire 
green magic takes life
to open the gate 
how many more orcs are
they planning on bringing 
all of them 
this is just a warband 
when the portal is open 
gul dan will bring the horde 
get them back to stormwind 
we ride ahead 
garona  we should go 
it s not safe   
durotan 
to the north  there is a black rock
that touches the sky 
i would meet with their leader 
to challenge him 
i saw you  lead the smallteeths
to our encampment 
they have seen
what is being built 
and only you know  what
gul dan has planned for my people 
his magic is death
to all things 
he must be stopped 
tell him  the black rock 
when the sun is highest 
i will 
chieftain 
if i returned  would you
take me into your clan 
you re safer here  with them 
is it as you feared 
  the fel is everywhere 
  then you mustn t leave again 
they need the guardian s help
now more than ever 
maybe the boy can help 
  we need solution 
  easy for you to say 
  the dwarf enforgers must work overtime 
  you treat us no better than dogs 
  we shall supply you no more 
  enough 
you have all called on stormwind in
the past either for troops or arbitration 
if we do not unite to fight
this enemy  we will perish 
stormwind needs soldiers 
arms  horses   
ha  we have our own
kingdoms to look after 
  fight your own wars 
  your majesty 
commander 
the orcs are building a portal  through
which they plan to bring an army 
if we do not stop them now 
we may never get another opportunity 
where is he 
where is the protector of azeroth 
where the guardian 
where is medivh 
  my liege 
  i suggest we take a recess 
take as long as you like 
we re done 
commander 
what s left of the 4th
has retreated from stonewatch 
what s left 
callan is among the injured 
dad 
i m fine  it s fine 
you had me worried 
where s the rest of your troop 
they took most of them alive 
we ll get them back 
don t be in such a hurry 
you re all i have 
i know  i m a soldier 
he would not ask for this meeting if
he thought he could defeat gul dan alone 
  the fel must truly terrified him 
  durotan is scared of nothing 
the location 
the suddenness of this meeting 
  sounds like a trap 
  it is not 
  could be 
  it is not 
  could be 
  it is not 
what do you think 
it s too good an
opportunity to ignore 
i think we have no choice 
we must stop the orcs
from opening the portal 
but we will need help 
  and if he s lying 
  orcs do not lie 
  what if he is 
  there is no honor in it 
and where s the  honor 
in him betraying his own people 
durotan is protecting his clan 
his enemy is the fel 
gul dan is the betrayer 
this orc  durotan 
how do you know him 
he freed me 
and he is loved by his clan 
he s a strong chieftain 
strong chiefs must earn
their clans trust 
if we are to expect you
to join us 
we must earn yours 
to defend yourself 
with this 
yes 
find the guardian 
what is this 
guardian 
uh 
the gate 
we saw it  in the morass 
i ve been putting together
all the clues i can about it 
this  this drawing 
  where did you copy it from 
  guardian 
and this 
and this  and this 
i ve been researching ever since
i felt the presence of the fel 
i am the guardian  me  not you 
not yet 
i just thought you might
appreciate some help 
don t presume you can help me 
you have no idea the forces
i contend with 
if you want to help 
protect the king 
you leave the fel to me 
  interesting choice 
  guardian 
pack up and move
to the west gate 
you there 
pack up your stall
and get moving now 
i need your help 
  i found a book 
  of course you did 
there was an illustration
that showed the gate
like the one we saw being built 
  sorry  sorry 
  khadgar 
listen  i tried to show the guardian
but he became furious 
he burned all my research 
he would have burn this too
if i hadn t hidden it in my robe 
no  turn the page  here 
look 
see 
what do you think
the image means 
the orcs were summoned 
from this side of the gate 
they were invited in 
and the guardian
burned your research 
he s probably just
trying to protect you 
now go away 
good spot for an ambush 
our sentries are well placed 
i will check again 
you asked to speak
with the humanking 
here he stands 
i am the king llane 
i m told you wished to talk 
ask him if they plan
to return to their home 
our world is destroyed 
there is nothing to go back to 
we are not responsible
for destroying your world 
war with us will solve nothing 
he says 
 orcs  war solves everything  
then why is he here 
to save my people 
fel takes life from
more than it s victims 
kills the earth and
corrupts those who use it 
gul dan will poison everything
with his death magic 
if my people are to survive 
gul dan must be destroyed 
in 2 suns  the humans
we have captured   
be used to fuel the portal 
if you attack our camp 
and draw his warriors away 
frostwolf clan  will kill him 
two days 
if we do this 
you will protect my people until then 
i will try 
it s a trap 
traitor die 
retreat 
back  return to our camp 
fall back 
stay together 
focus  like old times 
cover your flank 
spread out 
swords 
you alright 
you are no good to us dead  go 
i ll get the others 
fall back 
we re all getting out 
medivh will cover our retreat 
fall back 
garona 
stay together 
fall back 
go on  now 
where s the bloody guardian 
protect the king  i got them 
move back 
shield formation 
retreat to the plateau 
fall back 
up the hill  move 
medivh 
medivh  take it down 
medivh 
hold on  son 
dad 
for azeroth 
medivh 
stop 
no 
callan 
he s here 
what s wrong with him 
we need to get him to karazhan 
  i ll get the horses 
  you won t make any time by road 
take one of my birds 
place him in the font 
  moroes  what s wrong with him
  i told him not to leave karazhan 
i have to go 
we need the help of
the karin tor  now 
go 
there are medicines i must prepare 
sit with him 
you and the baby must leave now 
you re a traitor  durotan 
no 
one who values what we once were 
like you used to 
that time is past 
we are but fuel for the fel now 
there is still hope  blackhand 
our children 
do not make me take more
innocent lives  young chieftain 
if i submit   
will you let my people be 
what will i call our son 
go el
you 
where s the older man 
he told me to watch you 
  the king 
  he is alive 
lothar s son is dead 
i argued for the meeting 
lothar will hate me 
this upsets you 
he is a great warrior 
he defends his people well 
a good mate for an orc 
i am no orc 
i am no human either 
when i was younger 
i used to feel apart from my kin 
i traveled far and wide 
looking for    wisdom 
feel a connection with all the souls
i was charged with protecting 
on my travel  i met
a strong and noble people 
among them  a female 
who accepted me for what i was 
who loved me 
it was not a life
i was fated to have 
but it taught me something 
if love is what you need 
you must be willing to travel
to the end the world to find it 
you left your mate 
go find lothar 
step inside the circle 
this    is my gift to you 
garona 
a whole world and
exchange for a statue 
gods are strange creatures 
frostwolves  you are a practical people 
those of us from the south have
always admired that about you 
when the portal opens 
when the rest of the horde join us
we will give them the fel 
  all of them 
  durotan did not agree to this 
and why would you care
what that traitor thinks 
it is time for a new leader
of the frostwolf clan 
one who has the best interest
of his orcs in mind 
one who appreciates gul dan s vision 
his power 
come 
i will grant you the fel 
durotan  he    has poisoned
the frostwolves against the fel 
let me gather them 
bring them here 
grant me the fel in front of them 
let them see   
how much stronger i become 
as i said  a practical people 
this is a new dawn 
the time of the horde 
be feared  or be fuel 
i m sorry 
callan s mother 
died in childbirth 
i blamed him for it  for years 
i m not going to blame you 
he was so young 
in my entire life 
i have never felt
so much pain as i do now 
gul dan does not want to waste
his power on the frostwolves 
burn them 
take the weak  kill the strong 
i ll bathe in your blood 
maybe  but not now 
i can t give you long 
but i can give you a head start 
for the sake of your son  draka 
leave    now 
you should have trusted in your
chieftain  orgrim doomhammer 
wait for me 
  khadgar 
  how dare you to come here 
get out 
i come seeking your wisdom 
there is nothing
for you here now 
the guardian  medivh  is unwell 
what 
  he s been poisoned by the fel 
  what 
ridiculous 
what do you know
of the dark portal 
you come back 
and accused the guardian   
what is alodi 
how does he know 
alodi 
what is it 
an entity from a time
before the kirin tor existed 
we think it serve the functions
similar to that of the guardian 
protector 
no one beyond the arch council knows of
it s existence  and it will stay that way 
and you to mention it
in the same breath
as the dark portal is
too much to be mere   
coincidence 
do i go in 
i don t know 
it s never done that before 
khadgar 
i know you  from the library 
you re alodi 
i used the last of my energies
to summon you here 
  the guardian has betrayed us 
  medivh 
  i saw the fel in his eyes 
  he is consumed by it 
if he is not stopped 
this world will burn 
i don t have the power
to defeat a guardian 
guardian is but a name 
the true guardians of this world
are the people themselves 
i know you see what
the kirin tor can not 
it s why you left them 
no one can stand against
the darkness    alone 
i don t understand what
you want me to do 
yes  you do 
trust in your friends 
together  you can save this world 
always remember 
from light comes darkness 
and from darkness    light 
up  up 
thank you  moroes 
you ll recover  guardian 
you always do 
no    thank you 
for everything you ve done 
sorry  old friend 
it seems i have let
the orcs into this world 
the fel has twisted me  i   
don t even know
what else i may have done 
i just don t remember 
everything i fought to protect 
i have    destroyed 
i can t control the fel 
no one can 
five legions to block deadwind pass 
another ten here  here  and here 
along redridge mountains 
supply lines here 
while the eastern sea hems
them in both south and east 
if we hold these positions 
we will be at our strongest 
containment 
until there is a better option  yes 
and where there is
10 times as many 
what then 
if there were easy answers   
our priority must be
to stop the gate from opening 
fail there  and it s
just a matter of time
before they beat us
with sheer numbers 
what do you suggest 
send everything we got 
destroy the gate  free our people 
and end the immediate threat 
  and the orcs that remain 
  we ll take care of them later 
after they ve ravaged the entire kingdom 
  my lords 
  medivh  you are up and well 
i am  i feel    restored 
we need you 
we ve been agonizing over our options 
some of us believe
there are no options 
  we need fresh eyes 
  i have news 
  i ve met with durotan 
  you met with durotan 
the rebellion against gul dan
is gaining strength 
with their help we can
destroy this gate 
  that doesn t change my plan 
  what plan 
anduin believes we should
attack with full force 
i m concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless 
how many legions would you need
to hold the orcs in place 
five for deadwind pass 
ten for the redridge mountains 
ten more to protect the city 
we ve already lost 18 legions 
  that leaves one  two  three 
  can it be done  medivh 
no  it can t be done 
with three legion 
frostwolves  and my power

your powers
have proven unreliable
at best recently 
  llane  have i ever let you down 
  let him down 
where have you even been
for the last 6 years 
please  anduin 
medivh is the guardian   
not the one you remember 
he s lost it  he s unstable 
and he won t be there
when you really need him 
find your bearings  anduin 
i d march into hell for you 
if i thought there was a
slightest chance of victory 
but there isn t 
this is suicide 
is this about callan 
it was a tragedy 
if he hadn t been trying so hard
to win your approval 
  he might still be with us 
  medivh 
callan wasn t ready 
you knew it 
  and you let him play soldier anyway 
  anduin  stop 
you killed him 
commander  please  sir  please

i did not see how we could
side with the humans   
against our own kind 
i was wrong 
gul dan s fel magic is destroying us 
where s draka  safe 
but  the rest   
they won t follow him 
if they could see
what he has become 
and i will show them 
there is no other man i would entrust
the safety of my family to  varian 
keep them safe while i m gone 
ready 
i would feel better if
lothar were riding with us 
we ll be fine 
i ll return to karazhan
and get ready for battle 
find me at the portal 
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa

last about a minute 
your armor  commander

you are the son of
durotan and draka 
an unbroken line of chieftains 
i am durotan  son of garad 
chieftain of the frostwolf clan 
and i am here to kill gul dan 
ghost cannot invoke mak gora 
 duel of honor 
you are the chieftain
of no clan 
your people are food for worms

to the orc home world 
he s opening the portal 
we need to shut him up 
the incantation 
i have no time for this 
blackhand 
     orc tradition    
this is a mak gora 
 duel of honor 
you will respect our tradition 
keep fighting 
gul dan cheats

i will not 
i follow a true orc 
a chieftain 
may your balls rot  demon 
anyone else 
and you  warchief 
you will take the fel 
and you will become stronger

quick thinking 
  slicing it s head off like that

khadgar 
i m sorry

i always did

blackhand comes to claim
the honor of killing you 
garona 
no good will come
from us both died 
look around you 
we are surrounded 
your killing me is the only
hope we have for peace 
you told lady taria that killing her
would bring you honor 
well  killing me
would make you a hero 
survive 
bring peace between
orcs and humans 
you must

what are you waiting for 
do as i say 
traitors 
get out of my way 
i ll do it myself 
who will obey you 
if you go to war
with your own kind 
if you do this 
you will lose the horde 
and this war is only beginning 
for your son 
so your spirit can teach him 
garona s dagger 
i pulled that from llane s neck 
well 
there has to be an explanation 
yes  she made her choice 
i don t believe that 
maybe you and i didn t know her
as well as we thought we did 
there is no greater blessing
a city can have
than a king who would
sacrifice himself for his people 
but such a sacrifice must be earned 
we must deserve it 
if we only show our unity
to mourn a good man s death 
was king llane wrong
to believe in you 
  no

we will avenge you  my lady
