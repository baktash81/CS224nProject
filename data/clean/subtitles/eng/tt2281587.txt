the berlin national theatre 
we ll make our money back
when we sell it out

 ich bin ein berliner  
more like   ein frankfurter

guys  i m not sure
we can do this  you know 
okay  let s put this to the vote 
all those in favor
of believing in ourselves 
raise your hands 
that s not what i m saying 
and all those in favor
of just giving up 
i can t believe i m
voting for giving up 
good  well  i m glad
we made this decision 
wonderful 
so cool 
isn t that exciting 
i can t believe it 
all right  gather round 
troops  everybody 
okay  guys 
since we re playing such a big theater 
let s stick with what we know 
we ll open with a cabaret number   
kermit  when do i do the
indoor running of the bulls 
mr  kermit  sir 
i would very much like to demonstrate
my magnetic bomb attractor vest 
bunsen  why would you even
invent one of those 
why did i invent the
unexpectedly exploding cupcake 
hey  what about muppet ladder 
muppet ladder  that s
never  ever worked  gonzo 
last time we all tried that
was 20 years ago
and you ended up
in a cast for six months 
yeah  good times 
kermit  what if i do four
or five celine dion songs 
you know celine dion 
she works in vegas 
no  piggy  there s
no time for that 
what about the band s
marathon jam session 
drum solo  drum solo 
no drum solo 
guys  guys  guys 
we can t just do whatever we want 
this is our opening night 
let s play to our
strengths  because   
well   
look  i didn t want
to worry you guys
but if we don t sell this theater out 
it would mean the end of the tour 
what 
and maybe the end of us 
great news  muppets 
we re sold out 
what 
fine 
i mean  great  great 
well done  dominic 
hey  i have an amazing
idea for an act 
it s called  the indoor
running of the bulls  
gonzo  i ve told you  that
act is far too dangerous 
actually  kermit  i was asking
dominic what he thinks 
good grief 
dominic  dominic  five songs 
 sold out   like we ve
sold out a show in 30 years 
is this a good time to discuss
our upcoming european wedding 
no  actually  i m kind
of busy right now 
perfect 
i have 23 swatches for the
seat covers for the reception 
eight font choices for the menu 
which  by the way 
we are not serving flies 
piggy  what are you talking about 
i m just trying to involve you in
some of the decision making  dear 
what about being involved
in the decision
to get married in the
first place  huh 
kermit  you never let
me do what i want 
oh  yeah 
well  what about what i want 
what about that 
i haven t even proposed yet 
  you can do that on our honeymoon 
  what 
that s insane  do you hear
what you re saying 
insane  how dare you call
your fiancée insane 
you are not my fiancée 
we are not engaged 
and  as a matter of fact 
the way this particular conversation
is going right now    well   
i m fine with that 
piggy  wait  i m sorry 
get out 
don t take it personally 
they still love you 
they just prefer me now 
thank you  dominic 
that s very comforting 
do you know what i think helps
sometimes in situations like this 
what 
a walk alone in the fog
in former east berlin 
maybe along a deserted canal 
well  i guess a quiet stroll
is not a bad idea 
let the others know
i ve gone  will you

why break in 
smash some priceless busts
and then not steal anything 
there must be something
bigger going on 
but what 
i ve got it 
sorry  2 00 pm  my day is over 
wait  those weirdos  the muppets 
were performing next to the
crime scene in berlin 
and here they are 
performing right next to
the crime scene in madrid 
you know what that means 
  yes  they love museums 
  no 
they re suspects 
okay  overtime 
we must find these muppets
before they flee the country 
to the train station 
hey  larry  want a
bite of my bocadillos 
what the   
are you all les muppets 
wow  those are big badges 
thank you 
come  come  you must come with
us to answer some questions 
kermit  let s begin
describe the day you played berlin
we rehearsed 
and then we walked about
we ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
that night at 10 03
were you inside the
portrait gallery 
my alibi is watertight
the audience saw me sing all night
monsieur  we know you did the crime
i was on stage that whole time
ask who sang rainbow connection
thank you  kermit 
no more questions
i think it s time for
good cop romantic cop 
miss piggy  you could
end up locked inside
and now s your chance
to save your hide
gentlemen  i did not know
it s a crime to steal the show
tell us how the art was taken
if you want to save your bacon
i haven t seen your missing art
all i ve stolen is audience hearts
we ll catch the swine
that did this job
give up the pig puns  creep 
go jump in a lake 
that s my suggestion
thank you  piggy  no more questions
i think she likes me  huh 
i don t think your puns are
helping the investigation 
  you know  i think they did it
  no  they didn t
yes  they did and we can pin it
if they did how did they do it 
if they didn t how did they didn t 
if they didn t then it s easy
 cause they simply didn t do it
if they did it  then i knew it but
we ve nothing that can prove it
excuse me 
let s go from the start
what do you know
about the stolen art 
i didn t know there was a plan
your accusation s far out  man
the chances of us committing
a crime are less than  009
i can do an elvis impression
thank you  muppets
no more questions
  they didn t
  no  they didn t
there s no way they did the crime
  they couldn t  they re too stupid
  not criminal masterminds
we do not know who did it
but we know who didn t do it
so we know who didn t do it
yes  we know who didn t do it
they re incapable
of being culpable 
hi 
come on  let s go
over the files again 
stop digging escape tunnel  frog 
how did you know 
it s the first escape
everyone tries 
that s the second
escape people try 
oh  boy

what time did you say
that rehearsal was 
okay  what about
this comedian bear 
he is too stupid to be stupid 
he must be some sort of genius 
maybe your  lemur 
hunch is correct 
except for the fact
that les muppets
play tomorrow night
at the dublin theatre 
which just happens to be next
door to the irish national bank 
maybe your muppet hunch is   
correct 
it s almost as if we re

an up tempo song and dance
and then go into a comedy routine 
but we like boyz ii men 
it is big papa s favorite song  lot
of emotions in that song for him 
i m not learning no other song 
i m a triple threat

fozzie 
dominic s the reason we ve
been selling out our shows 
he s been giving away tickets
and bribing journalists
to write great reviews 
why didn t we ever
think of doing that 
i mean  that s terrible 
the question is  why 
and could it have
anything to do with
why kermit s been
acting so weird lately 
hey  wanna see something funny 
yes  constantine  the world s
most dangerous frog 
fozzie  what does he have to
do with what i just told you

kermit 
are you there 
hello 
kermit

well  he s fooled them all 
should we go to the police 
we don t have any evidence 
i feel terrible 
i m the one who talked kermit into
doing this tour in the first place 
i wish kermit was here 
he would know what to do 
you re right 
there s only one guy in
this world who can save us 
only one frog who
can restore order 
bring justice 
and set things right
