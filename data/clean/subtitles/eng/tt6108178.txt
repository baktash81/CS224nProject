the angels
the beasts
and the human beings
the angels he made
from his pure word
the angels have
no will to do evil
they cannot deviate for one
moment from his purpose
the beasts have only their
instincts to guide them
they too
follow the commands of their maker
the torah states
that hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation
fashioning these creatures
then just before sunset
he took a small
quantity of earth
and from it he fashioned
man and woman
an afterthought
or his crowning achievement
so what is this thing
man
woman
it is a being with
the power to disobey
alone among
all the creatures
we have free will
we hang suspended
between the clarity
of the angels
and the desires
of the beasts
hashem gave us choice
which is both a privilege and a burden
we must then choose
the tangled life
whispering we live
gasps
body thuds
all clamoring
man call an ambulance
rav
rav

the rav didnt

here
i brought you
an extra blanket
rav krushkas
untimely death
is a crushing blow
to anglojewry
he was a giant of the faith
sadly he left
no children
lazy journalism
that would have upset the rav
childless
it was probably written
by some 12yearold reporter
forget about it
newspaper thuds
everybody loves him
so much
i used to wonder if i loved him as
much as all those strangers did
sometimes i used to wonder
if i loved him at all
youre his daughter
mmmhmm
but he was closer to you
he enjoyed teaching me
so
get some sleep ronit

yes she is
good day
a bundle of myrrh
is my beloved to me
that lies all night
between my breasts
my beloved is to me
as a cluster of henna blooms
in the vineyards
of eingedi
is it about sensuality
that is the way in which
true love manifests itself
but might it also be
that between a male
and a female
that theres something
higher than that
but isnt it that the
references to sensual pleasures
celebrate physical
love here
the enjoyment of that love becomes
in this context the highest
see you are fair
my love
you are fair
your eyes are doves
see you are handsome
my beloved yea pleasing
and our bed is verdant
could i have a piece
of apple strudel
and um also
could i get one of these

oh well im rarely alone
ive got wonderful friends
i expect you have lots of fun

uncle hartog chuckles

the way it should be
or is it just
institutional obligation
now ronit
stop right there
i mean uncle
lets just say
i stayed here
for one more year
lets think about this
okay right
i would be
married off to whoever
and then after ten years
in some loveless marriage

like killing myself

to the hesped
what
theres no point in my being here
im gonna change
my ticket

do what we wanted
esti do you think

rav used to say about marriage
no
you do
will you grow
old alone

with no family no joys
laughs
dovid is
a good boy he
he has a generous heart
and hes crazy about you marry him
so everything was
all right when i left
no
i was ill
what sort of ill
in my head
the rav was afraid for me

marriage would cure me
it hasnt been
a complete disaster
and thats enough
do you have to have
sex every friday

rav krushka often spoke about
the duty of the teacher
the duty
im sorry i cant
the ravs only child ronit krushka
is here with us today
the ravs final words
to us
why did he choose to discuss
the idea of choice
and freedom
theres nothing so tender
or truthful
as the true feeling
of being free
hmm free to choose
the rav was a giant of torah
but it wasnt a giant
we saw collapse that day
it was a man
he talked of the angels
and of the desires of
the beasts
and with his final words
he reminded us of this
we are free to choose
groans
sighs
you are free
you are free
chuckles
i cannot accept the honor or
position that is offered
to me
i do not have
