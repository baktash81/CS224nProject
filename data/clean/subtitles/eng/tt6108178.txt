the angels 
the beasts 
and the human beings 
the angels  he made
from his pure word 
the angels have
no will to do evil 
they cannot deviate for one
moment from his purpose 
the beasts have only their
instincts to guide them 
they  too 
follow the commands of their maker 
the torah states
that hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation
fashioning these creatures 
then  just before sunset 
he took a small
quantity of earth
and from it he fashioned
man and woman 
an afterthought 
or his crowning achievement 
so  what is this thing 
man 
woman 
it is a being with
the power to disobey 
alone among
all the creatures
we have free will 
we hang suspended
between the clarity
of the angels
and the desires
of the beasts 
hashem gave us choice 
which is both a privilege and a burden 
we must then choose
the tangled life
 whispering  we live 
 gasps 
   body thuds 
   all clamoring 
man  call an ambulance 
rav 
rav 
open your eyes 
ronit  take a breath 
 shutter clicks

   instrumental music playing

well  i would have come over 
if you d told me he was ill 
the rav didn t
want you to know 
he became very frail at the end 
he probably
didn t want you
to see him like that 
you still should
have called me 
this week has been
harsh  ronit 
hmm  please 
my father just died 
i know 
i know  i was there 
well 
at least you let me know
he was dead 
it s important that this week
is conducted with honor 
honor 
it s the most
important thing 
of course it is 
 door opens and closes 
 chanting in hebrew 
 chanting ends 
 sighs 
sorry  it s
a bit of a mess 
 closet door opening 
  i ll get you some hangers 
   softly  thanks 
 ronit sniffles

i should stay somewhere else 
do what you want 
do the windows open 
no 
uh  if you want to smoke
you need to go downstairs 
here 
i brought you
an extra blanket 
 rav krushka s
untimely death
 is a crushing blow
to anglo jewry 
 he was a giant of the faith 
 sadly  he left
no children  
lazy journalism 
  that would have upset the rav 
  childless 
it was probably written
by some 12 year old reporter 
forget about it 
 newspaper thuds 
everybody loves him
so much 
i used to wonder if i loved him as
much as all those strangers did 
sometimes i used to wonder
if i loved him at all 
  you re his daughter 
  mmm hmm 
but he was closer to you 
he enjoyed teaching me 
so 
get some sleep  ronit 
good night

  i hope so 
the rav would be
very proud of you  dovid 
appreciate that 
ronit krushka
is staying with you  hmm 
yes  she is 
good day 
 a bundle of myrrh
is my beloved to me 
 that lies all night
between my breasts 
 my beloved is to me
as a cluster of henna blooms
 in the vineyards
of ein gedi  
is it about sensuality 
that is  the way in which
true love manifests itself 
but might it also be
that between a male
and a female
that there s something
higher than that 
but isn t it that the
references to sensual pleasures
celebrate physical
love here 
the enjoyment of that love becomes 
in this context  the highest 
 see  you are fair 
my love 
 you are fair 
 your eyes are doves 
 see  you are handsome 
my beloved  yea  pleasing 
 and our bed is verdant  
could i have a piece
of apple strudel 
and  um  also 
could i get one of these 
the linzer biscuit  yeah

 speaking in hebrew 
  good shabbos 
  good shabbos

 uncle hartog
chanting in hebrew 
  dovid  amen
  others  amen 
 clears throat 
we understood it
the first time 
  you don t have to explain it 
   laughing 
she always
overexplains a joke 
that s the trouble 
  he never lets it go 
  hard to get by with such a jewish name 
every day he mentions his name 
it s unbelievable 
uncle hartog  what kind of
a name is  andy  
he s got nothing else to say
about him except his name 
what  no  i have something else to say 
he s a nebbish 
  yeah  that s the other thing 
  i m sorry  i love my son 
this is his
own father talking 
  yeah  what do you think 
  i love him 
so our youngest  basha 
just had her second boy 
  and they named him daniel  for my father 
  uncle hartog  ah  mazel tov 
they live in australia 
it s too far 
melbourne 
thirty seven grandchildren 
  uncle hartog  mazel tov 
  not bad 
we saw your photos
in a magazine 
it was the pictures of the
twins that you showed us 
rebbetzin  but they
called you ronnie curtis 
that s my
professional name 
what was wrong with
your real name  krushka 
you should be proud of it 
artists change
their names sometimes 
  don t they  moshe 
  that s right  fruma 
women change
their names every day 
they take their
husband s names
and their own
history is gone 
don t they 
i wouldn t talk
about  gone  
not gone 
  yes  they do 
   chuckles 
ronit 
you look so like
your mother 
ronit  oh  don t start

yeah  she s got
beautiful eyes 
  oh  she s a beauty 
  uncle   
your dear sister
was taken far too soon 
 speaking in hebrew 
rabbi goldfarb 
and now the rav 
this must be a terrible
shock for you  ronit 
you re away  it s a shock 
of course it is 
we never thought
we d see you again 
sorry to disappoint you 
 chuckles 
uncle hartog  ronit

  all right 
fruma  you know  you must take
your mother s candlesticks  ronit 
  from the house 
  rebbetzin  yes  of course  and then
  you must give them to your children 
  oh  i don t want children

rabbi goldfarb

mmm    yeah

dovid has been
doing great work 
 all murmur agreement    uncle hartog 
wonderful work  wonderful work 
a lot has changed
since you were here 
there s a lot of problems 
housing  and jobs   
the youth 
even an incident with drugs 
 esti gasps    perhaps people
should stop having so many children 
it s nothing we
cannot deal with 
 speaking hebrew 
and you re not married 
you must find
someone  ronit 
  it s not funny growing old alone 
  oh  well i m rarely alone 
i ve got wonderful friends 
i expect you have lots of fun 
but that will pass 
   uncle hartog chuckles 
  but being married  well 
that s the way
it should be 
oh  is it 
the way it should be 
or is it just
institutional obligation 
now  ronit 
stop right there 
i mean  uncle 
let s just say
i stayed here
for one more year 
let s think about this 
okay  right 
i would be
married off to whoever
and then  after ten years
in some loveless marriage
i might have ended up
killing myself 
or i would ve felt
like killing myself 
 sighs heavily 
i am really jetlagged 
so i think i should   
i m gonna hit the road 
and  i ll see you both
back at the house 
it was great to see you

 keys jingling 
these are the keys for you to
gather any personal possessions 
a lot of keys 
 chuckles 
hmm 
would you help me sell it 
clause three 
 last will and testament
of rav shlomo krushka  
rav krushka  bless his memory 
left the house
and everything in it
to the synagogue 
 chuckles 
  i m sorry if that s a shock 
  no 
it s just a house 
a father should have a child to
look after him in his final hours 
i didn t know
that he was ill 
  how could you know when you re not here 
   thumps desk 
 sighs 
you were all he had left 
 softly  i know

painful for you
not to receive
the rav s forgiveness 
shmuli  hello  mrs  kuperman

 blinds rattling 
esti  i m sorry
it s such a mess  i   
your uncle said he was taking
care of everything  and   
he didn t want us
to touch anything
before they
take it away 
hmm 
 ronit sighs 
 hebrew coming over radio 
 static as stations change 
 upbeat music playing 
 chuckles 
he left it all
to the synagogue 
mmm hmm 
would you really want it 
financial freedom  no 
that would be
far too easy 
would ve been nice  though 
if he d just mentioned me in his will 
  left me a pipe 
   both chuckle softly 
i know 
 both humming along to song 
 music stops 
i m not gonna go
to the hesped 
  what 
  there s no point in my being here 
i m gonna change
my ticket 
but   
 sniffing  mmm 
you know  what really gets me
is i never took his portrait 
so  all he did all day 
was stay in here
and read the torah
and the commentaries on the torah
and the notes on the commentaries
  and the debates on the notes 
  mmm 
and it meant we could
do what we wanted 
esti  do you think
i should go back early

 moans 
 both moan 
it was me
who rang the shul
in new york
to let you know 
i m just gonna
get some air 
why did you get married  esti 
why didn t you just leave 
 sighs  do you remember what the
rav used to say about marriage 
  no 
  you do 
 will you grow
old alone  
no  no   will you grow old
with no family  no joys  
 laughs 
 dovid is
a good boy  he   
 he has a generous heart 
and he s crazy about you  marry him  
so everything was
all right when i left 
no 
i was ill 
what sort of ill 
in my head 
the rav was afraid for me 
and if i had to sleep
with a man 
why not with
our best friend 
oh  esti   
i think  i think he felt that
marriage would cure me 
it hasn t been
a complete disaster 
and that s enough 
do you have to have
sex every friday 
  it s expected 
  it s medieval 
it s not mandatory 
nobody gets beaten
if they don t feel like it 
what happened to you 
nothing 
you happened to me 
and then i started teaching
and that became important 
you can teach anywhere 
 sighs 
i really love the girls 
and i give them ambition 
to do what  push out seven
babies and be a good wife 
don t  don t 
i m a good teacher 
  and i help them to value themselves 
  okay  but what about you

 mouthing 
man  we would all be very happy if
you chose to take on the rav s work 
there are always obstacles  of course 
to anything that is challenging 
it would be difficult to
measure up to the rav
in any meaningful way 
and your wife 
she would welcome it
if you took over the shul 
yes  esti will support me with
whatever decision i make 
and ronit krushka 
we were surprised
at her presence 
ronit is grieving 
and we will make her
very welcome at the hesped

distracted by ronit s return

the rav s only child  ronit krushka 
is here with us today 
the rav s final words
to us

the idea of choice 
and freedom 
there s nothing so tender
or truthful
as the true feeling
of being free 
hmm  free to choose 
the rav was a giant of torah 
but it wasn t a giant
we saw collapse that day 
it was a man 
he talked of the angels
and of the desires of
the beasts 
and with his final words 
he reminded us of this 
we are free to choose
