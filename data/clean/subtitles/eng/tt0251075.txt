bad move
and the fire begins
its showtime
dont worry maam im here to save you
keep those people back
this is an emergency
dont you dare die on me
breathe damn it breathe
shes going to make it
what the
damn
though it may be hard to believe
a single biology professor
making in excess of 17500 a year
could find time
to grade your first biology
research papers i did
as you can see
there was a shocking statistical anomaly
pretty much all of you got as
congratulate yourselves
i have a good feeling about this group
and i think the parade of as
will continue to the end of the semester
so much for the bell curve
bell curves suck
mr kane
dr kane
there seems to be a mistake here
my brother and i each got a c
c me too
allow me to share something
with the entire class
as i was grading papers i came across
two gems both entitled cells are bad
both with just one paragraph which
i unfortunately committed to memory
cells are bad
my uncle lives in a cell
its 10 by 12 and he has to read
the same boring magazine every day
the end
youre talking about our papers
arent you dr kane
yes i am
and although my standards
are nowhere near where they used to be
i couldnt put an a on those beauties
i hope you understand
sure
yeah okay
okay lets get back to work
at the periodic table which
a meteor where
route 89a yeah i got it
rest assured i will be there okay bye
how does it look professor
its tight
really really tight nadine
but not too tight
you just dont have the points sorry
dont take it too hard
geologys tougher than people think
are you sure could you check again
i need this credit
to get into nursing school
nursing school
wouldnt you prefer a different profession
one where lives
were not dependent on you
actually what i want to be
is miss arizona
but my pageant consultant says
nursing school will impress the judges
theyll think i want to help people
ready for lunch
or have you already eaten
im just concluding
a teacherstudent conference with nadine
harry your dedication to your job
is an inspiration to us all
regrettably i have a prior lunch
engagement with professor kane
well discuss your extra credit later
cheer up
let me grab my stuff
where are you taking me
a meteor hit last night
thats what that was
as glen canyons representative
for the us geological survey
i have to check it out
im taking you in case
i have to do something scientific
then we eat
youre with the usgs
i signed up over the internet
or were you on a cheerleader site and
accidentally got linked to the usgs site
something like that
watch it take it easy
thats my baby take it easy
come on be careful
whos going to pay for the damage
to my goddamn car
i told you we dont do that
its force majeure
force majeure my ass
that cars a classic 73 buick riv
who are you
harry block
united states geological survey
my secretary ira kane
were here to investigate the meteor
if that is what it is
of course it is it almost blew up my car
im still fuzzy
on why you were here at night
with betty lou here
i was practicing for my firemans exam
which started seven minutes ago
so id appreciate it if youd let me go
so you and the blonde found the meteor
yeah i found it
it bounced my car 200 feet in the air
can i go
bob get him out of here
dont leave town
well sheriff is this the
point of penetration
yeah it punched through into a cavern
about 80 feet down
now thats a hole
damn it
next time you carry the case
youre the usgs representative
that responsibility comes with the badge
oh my god look at that
i believe weve located the target
two big smiles fellas
cheese
okay hold it up now
got it
its really hot
ill hold you up
show a little more nightstick
look at these jackasses
muscle pose give me big smiles
looking good
at ease gentlemen the feds are here
feds what feds
who let you down here
lets not get combative
the usgs and local law enforcement
have a long history of cooperation
were just here to get
some scientific samples if thats okay
yeah sure we got
all the photographic evidence we need
carry on
thanks keep up the good work
wow
it just hit last night
and it has stuff growing on it
could be cave moss
after just a few hours thats peculiar
lets get a sample and get out of here
its bleeding
its a rock that bleeds
now thats really peculiar
lets bag it
i dont know if this usgs gig
is all its cracked up to be
i mean it pads out my résumé
but am i growing as a person
am i growing as a division 3
womens volleyball coach
you going to do that spectrothingy test
spectrograph
yeah i will do a spectroscopic analysis
your résumé will shine
i got to get to the game
let me know if you find anything
ira are you sure you can handle this
by your lonesome
all right
thats impossible
ten base pairs
that cant be
come on ladies look alive up here
tina when lisa goes for the spike
you have to cover the line
lisa two hands okay two hands
god gave you two hands for a reason
big news the most amazing thing
the meteor samples are teeming
with onecelled organisms
their metabolic rates are off the charts
theyre dividing at an incredible rate
almost exponential
their dna has ten base pairs
ten base pairs thats good to know
harry the dna of all earth life
has only four base pairs
come on ladies look alive
harry
these are organisms from another world
theyre aliens
is the nobel prize paid in instalments
or a lump sum like the lottery
lets not get ahead of ourselves
im not im concerned about
the potential tax consequences
why in here
i just want to be cautious
our discovery
im all tingly
wow
im no biologist but how many cells
do singlecelled organisms have
if we want to be big important scientists
you have to act the part
take a look
there are multicellular organisms in there
i know
they werent there before
they snuck in
no there was no sneaking in
its too amazing
its like theyre evolving
theyre growing
growing into more complex organisms
its evolution
nobel here we come
but its 200 million years worth
in just a few hours
thats fast
you have no idea
get ready
on my signal go
recruit wake up
wake up
go
the hose this thing here
sorry
move it
wayne go come on
these things happen buddy
theres another test in six months
six months i cant wait six months
at least you have the pool gig
at the country club
great thanks a lot
drive careful
i got it i do this
looks like we have visitors
class since this is our first field trip
i want you to obey some simple rules
dirt
nice footwear
perfect for spelunking
now dont touch anything
dont move anything
dont even breathe unless we say
wear your protective gloves at all times
why do we have to do this
field experience
the meat and potatoes of geology
will this be on the final
yes
officer nice to see you
whats up professor
we came to pick up the rock
pick it up what
orders from the usgs
they want it under controlled conditions
its very technical
oh technical stuff its technical
okay go right ahead
well just haul it right out
sure
deke and danny
remember what we talked about
youre in charge of hoisting
get the winch to the hole
fellas stop nodding and stare at me
for a second okay
focus
you understand what i want you to do
yeah
go do it
ira im picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here
yeah a lot has changed
class i know these look like mushrooms
but refrain from eating them
it smells disgusting
nadine sometimes science stinks
its the game we play baby
rotten egg smell hydrogen sulfide right
with ammonia and methane
its converting the atmosphere
look at all this rudimentary plant life
its amazing
not to get all girly here but i feel
something wiggling around my toes
the ground does seem to be moving
flatworms
millions of them
yuck
barely 18 hours
and we already have flatworms
look
there they are
hi dr kane
i almost went down on that one
awesome
come here little buddy
i wont hurt you
you didnt hurt it you killed it
the oxygen must have killed it
it must need its own atmosphere to live
grab a specimen jar well scoop
some atmosphere in there with them
it took us two billion years to do
what they did in a couple of days
those germs are the embodiment
of the american dream
im sorry to interrupt professor block
but i was wondering if im correct
in assuming that that field trip
fulfilled any of my missing
credit assignments
nadine you are a very
very smart girl if you would just focus
professor the little wiggly worm things
are breaking
ira look
its not breaking its splitting
its mitosis thats how they reproduce
no sex
no time for sex
bummer
theyre splitting again
put it away
we call no one we tell no one
this is our secret
what about the government
they usually get involved
no government i know those people
you do
this is our discovery
we must maintain absolute control
we have to do more research and
check our findings document everything
wayne
whats this
that would be an allcotton towel sir
i believe its a fieldcrest
its a damp towel
what is a damp towel doing on my chaise
let me take care of this for you
you should as pool manager
if anyone knows what to do
about the dampness on my chair its you
you know what to do with the towels
because youre the pool boy
what the hell
where did you guys come from
youre dead now
when i checked the samples this morning
i found three different subspecies
theyre evolving so quickly god knows
what well find when we get back
please tell me theres an air show today
damn
shit
can i help you
harry block ira kane
united states geological society
were doing some important research
this is our site
not anymore youre not on the list
what we come here all the time
well this is not a nightclub
why dont you take it somewhere else
i know my constitutional rights
you cant tell
harry maybe you can call your superior
we can have a word with him
i have a harry block and an ira kane here
punk
talk nice to the white man
ill whup his ass
white man doesnt like to be yelled at
ira kane
the ira kane
ive looked forward to this for a long time
you bastard
youre history youre done
get his gun
take it easy okay theyre going up
youre responsible for the worst month
of my life
what the hell was that about
i dont know
drive down to the command tent
theyre expecting you
go
that guy had me in diapers
for over a month
what the hell was that
general woodmans expecting you
russell woodman
what an unexpected surprise
for me too
i didnt know we were on a hugging basis
same old ira kane and you are
harry block this is gen russell woodman
head of us army research
you two know each other
ira used to work for me right
i worked with you actually
you worked in army research
in the pentagon
all this time i thought you were just
a schoolteacher
no how did you find out about this
you leave the pentagon
you dont call you dont write
we like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons
you tapped my phone
no were not the kgb
weve been monitoring your computer
his computer
all those girls in the photos are over 18
yes im sure
i should have figured russell
you shouldve known better than
to keep something this big from us
and the cdc
just in time ira this is allison reed
senior researcher in epidemiology at
the cdc
nice underwear
a garter belt at a day function
i can do it thank you
im okay
dr kane
id heard about your recklessness
but you are way out of line on this one
didnt you realise how dangerous
the situation could have become
nice to meet you too
no need to play the blame game allison
no harm no foul
were all appreciative about the discovery
made by dr kane and mr black
block
block im sorry
the confirmation that life exists
outside this planet
would be the greatest
scientific discovery of our time
yes actually
yes it would
you have my word youll be
kept in the loop from this point on
you son of a bitch
kept in the loop we are the loop
we wont cut you out
but we need to take control
were following protocol ira
you remember protocol dont you
i have some protocol right here for you
come and get it
look the fact is this research
must continue under government control
weve already secured the area
were constructing an airlock
and a stateoftheart field research facility
so theres not a whole lot
for the science department
of glen canyon community college
to do here
did you catch that condescending tone
we are following wellestablished
federal guidelines
please dont pull this crap
we deserve to be here
you deserve to be here
youre lucky anybodys ever let you
near a science laboratory again
youre a disgrace
and a dangerous one at that
lieutenant show these men out
this is horseshit
its not over
youre in for a fight russell
would you stop following me thank you
we wont bend over and take this
fruit basket for russell woodman
happy holidays general
cute
dr kane are you asking me to bar
the federal government from involvement
in a discovery as significant as this one
no were asking you to ensure the local
scientists who made the discovery
continue to play a significant role
theyve kept us out for almost two weeks
we put our lives on the line to find
these little guys your majesty
we just want to be there for them
as they grow up
we were first team at the meteor site and
all the initial testing was done in our lab
the facilities at glen canyon
community college are a joke
they werent a joke
when i went there general
your honour if the court would allow me
to depose dr kane
depose me
we think your past
is very relevant dr kane
these issues speak directly
to his competence as a scientist
dr kane you were a toplevel researcher
at usamrid from 94 to 97
were you not
thats correct
you were summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997 any idea why
my services were no longer required
so your firing had nothing to do
with an experimental anthrax vaccine
you developed and administered to
140000 us soldiers in may of that year
i see where youre going with this
it may have been a factor
you need to ask the joint chiefs of staff
ill do that for now can you tell me
what happened
to the soldiers who were inoculated
none of them got anthrax
if thats what youre asking
what did they get
well as with any new vaccine
there were certain side effects
associated with
could you be more specific
its very technical
id hate to waste the courts time with it
humour me
some debilitating stomach cramps
severe diarrhoea
memory loss
yes go on any more symptoms
partial facial paralysis
temporary blindness drooling
bleeding gums erectile dysfunction
uncontrollable flatulence
i think thats it
one more question
do you remember
what the soldiers called this illness
they called it the kane madness
keep your head up
you know she wants to give you some
were you even in that courtroom
getting barbecued like babyback ribs
its all foreplay
weve been hit
forget the foreplay we just got screwed
empty
this is bad this is very very bad
damn it
i dont care who they are
stealing is stealing
they took the rock the samples
all the little wormy critters
all the datas gone the jpeg files
the dna sequences they cleaned us out
im calling the cops
the cops
they are the cops
then what
let me ask you something
how come you get to be a colonel
and im just a private
i was a colonel
and you obviously served
your country with distinction
consider yourself lucky
the penalty for impersonating an officer
is five years in prison
maybe for you white boy me they hang
colonels first
we been out here for twelve hours
my toe is starting to hurt
stop it
just act like you belong
dont worry i got this
pick up that butt soldier
sorry sir
and tuck that shirt in
yes sir
get the door
thank you private
dont get used to this
look at that
enjoy your lunch gentlemen
your girlfriend 1100
darn it
the womans a menace
testing one two
this is dj harry block here
and im an aquarius
stop i can hear you
dont snap at me unless you want
an angry solid gold dancer on your hands
lieutenant
whos that
i dont know
i dont have anything on my schedule
maybe its the guys from sector 12
doing a nocturnal specimen run
you know how those guys are
this place has changed
can you believe this
harry look at that
our little babies are growing up
three weeks
its already like a rain forest in here
looks like the kitchen
from my first apartment
harry
check that guy out
is it coming or going
that tree just ate it
everything here seems to be food for
something else so lets stay off the menu
you got that right
come here look at these little things
cool
snag one
snag one
yeah snag one and put it in the bucket
ive seen this movie
the black dude dies first you snag it
dont be scared
we came for a specimen now snag one
he wont hurt you
hes turned the other way hes eating
come on
come on my little red lobster
come on my sexy little crustacean
look at that backside
theatreintheround thats the kind of
trunk space you want in a late model car
who does that remind you of
i have no idea what youre talking about
shes been throwing it at you enough
dr reed
bullseye
excuse me dr reed
did you authorise a walkthrough
no why
you should probably
take a look at something
here
thats the kind of rump youd like to roast
kind of mother youd like to butter
that is a nice image
and i appreciate your assumption
that there is
an actual sexual human being
underneath
all dr reeds deepseated neuroses
but i dont think so
what
i think she is a humourless ice queen
thats just a cover dont you know that
all she needs is a good humping
oh ira ira
we have to get a piece of the asteroid
and cut that out it disturbs me
dont do that behind my back like that
im not doing it
cut it out
im just walking
lets bag that and get the hell out of here
im ready when you are colonel
this disco suit is making me chafe
shoo fly

dr reed nice to see you again
we were just leaving
you realise youre in violation of the
judges orders i could have you arrested
talk about violations what about our lab
anyone have a can of raid
what are you talking about
you stole our computer files our samples
i didnt steal anything
your buddies did
they cleaned us out
no we didnt
damn right
youve been trying to grab credit
on our discovery from the beginning
we just want whats rightfully ours
credit has nothing to do with it
im concerned with public safety
is any of this true flemming
absolutely not
somethings in my suit
youre not going to believe him
somethings in my suit
what
theres something in my suit
thats impossible its sealed
the fly theres a fly in my suit
take off your helmet turn up the oxygen
itll kill it

and this amazing discovery
falls into my lap its my ticket out of here
i dont suppose you would understand that
no how could i im just a humourless
ice maiden in need of a good humping
you heard that
loud and clear
dont think you know so much about me

early and get a jump start on things
can we help you
a guy got killed
at my country club last night
a real douchebag but
that just doesnt make it right
it was an animal attack
isnt that something
happened by the water hazard on the 4th
green the lady he was banging saw it
we chased this sucker on the fairway
then it died in a sand trap
it just died how
like it was choking to death
you know stopped breathing
its like nothing i ever saw before
i thought you guys might want to see it
jill youve got some kind
of infestation here
you have a serious bug problem
jill theres something in your closet
open the door grace

well an hour and a half would be good
hi do you have any messages for me
two single beds please were fighting
come on im tired ive had two hours
of sleep i need a shower
theyre spreading
you mean the golf course woodman sent
a team out there two hours ago
too bad you missed the 5foot
amphibian thats lying dead in my lab
theyre adapting
we have got to shut it down
youre overreacting we can handle this
i used to be arrogant like you
were both aware of what that led to
take me seriously allison
i do take you seriously
then talk to woodman
because he wont listen to me
we have to kill these things
while we still can
all right ill talk to him
but i cant promise anything
thank you
just one more thing
could you ever be attracted to me
bye ira
just food for thought
shes mine
ive been an adjunct professor
for almost four years
im hoping this whole alien brouhaha will
net me an honorary doctorate somewhere
you going to finish that bacon
yeah i am i ordered it didnt i
so about the coaching girls volleyball
do you ever get to see them take showers
yeah all the time
sometimes i shower with them
youre kidding right
so
shes going to talk to woodman
thank goodness
im okay
so level with me fellows
is there some sort of alien
attack happening here
we dont know
could i borrow your cream
hi denise
hello ira still setting the world on fire
thats iras ex over there
sitting with the cop
why the police escort
youre not under arrest are you
funny this is sam
hes about to make detective
i know sam maybe you can look into
what happened to my missing shirts
did i tell you she left
with two or three of my shirts
see what i mean
im not up on the law
but is it against the law to
walk out of someones house
with what they own
you want your shirt seriously take it
you must be cold right is that it
why should i wear a shirt thats yours
calm down
its amazing how many women
just open their shirt to him
hell let you borrow the shirt
for just today right professor
1099 we have a code 1272
over in valley vista
1272 thats an animal attack
1099 responding
got to go babe
now
theyre calling
be careful out there
youll take care of the check right
i want those shirts back denise
you have to admit this animal attack
has kind of an ominous feel doesnt it
check it out
check it out
all right
looks like were under the microscope
so lets be subtle no cowboy stuff okay
no problem
professionals
officer johnson
what are you doing here
we heard about the attack
part of our job
is to ascertain if theres any health risk
no not this time forget about it
you didnt touch it right
that would be a serious nono
you did he touched it
he shouldnt have touched it
what do we do
i dont know
okay why dont you come in
and take a look
ill be checking things out
around here in this vicinity
this dog is all ass
jeez ira look at this man
he would have come from in here right
its just used for storage
and access under the house
looks like he crawled through the dirt
hey guys
i was conducting
a parameter check
and theres something you better see
you liked that thing
youre going to love this
what is it
what is it
great googamooga
what did i tell you
theyre crawling out
theyre trying to breathe
in our atmosphere
fortunately they havent been able
to adapt yet
i think i know how these things got here
how
this entire area is just a honeycomb
of caves and old mine shafts
i believe the moenave cave system
starts a few miles away
west of the golf course
it runs into the foothills continues to
the kaibab plateau
and goes right into lake powell
our cave
is smack dab in the middle
of the system its all connected
could you repeat that
im impressed
beneath this calm sexy exterior
beats the heart of a true scientist
that ones moving
what the hell is it doing
i think its trying to breathe
thats like a big loogie
mazel tov its a boy
its oxygen tolerant
its flying away is that a bad thing
only if youre a human being
you know how i hate shopping
you need something for thanksgiving
i have enough clothes
i think that colour is great on you
i think this may be the place
ever used one of these before
just cause im a teacher
dont make me a pussy
ladies theres a flying extraterrestrial
in the store can we focus
im in here just a minute
just a second please
i said just a second bitch
how would you like me
to scratch out your eyes
here birdybirdybirdybirdybirdy
if i was a giant nasty alien bird
in a department store where would i be
lingerie
not you the bird
lingerie
help
you go low im going high
well never find this damn thing
i lost him
how do you lose a 20foot bird in a mall
i dont know
what do we do now
wayne
i think weve established that
cacaw and tookietookie dont work
right sorry
so what do you say ira pack it in
step back im going to shoot him
stand down ill kill this one myself
give me a chance
im communicating here
wayne please stop
you are embarrassing me
its working
sing rub some funk on it
here he comes
you grab the girl ill get the bird
all right nice shot
i am so sorry i swear to god
i will never shoplift again
good
so what do you want light meat or dark
you have to ask
its dead now
im standing at the edge of
the valley vista housing community
where just below me are dozens of giant
oddlooking dead creatures
we should stress that to this point
we have had no official word from
this ugly tentacle came out of the ground
and tried to grab my private parts
i batted it away it got my hand
there is anxiety and confusion
in the glen canyon area
were outside the state capitol building
awaiting comment from the governor
concerning the nature and origin
of these extraordinary creatures
governor lewis this way
can someone tell me
why i was not informed
that we have aliens
crawling all over my beloved state
right now 400 media vultures
are camped outside my office
they know more about this than i do
i should throw the bunch of you
into prison
not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits
state prison with crotch binders
im sorry but there were earlier security
breaches by dr kane and his team
wait a minute no no excuse me
thats not exactly true gen woodman
i believe the governors question
was directed at me
put a plug in it
im not interested in bureaucratic crapola
i want to know how bad this thing is
its bad governor
according to the new ground sensors
and satellite thermal scans
they indicate a potential problem
i cant read this what kind of problem
someone take this bag of snakes
and lay them out straight
allow me
and you are
dr allison reed
carla would you mind
the red markings indicate the growth
of the alien ecosystem
unless we act immediately
we will lose glen canyon in three days
great merciful christ
in a week the rest of arizona
then the entire southwest

with napalm lots and lots of napalm
napalm why dont you just nuke them
what about nukes
nobodys dropping an hbomb on my state
all this talk about napalm
and burning makes me nervous
and we dont know how theyd react
to such an attack on a cellular level
governor its time for a military solution
this will work
general sorry to interrupt
you better take a look at this
what
you called me out for this

its often because
shut up flemming
okay i know where the car is
wipe my ass too

got room for one more
hell yeah
who wants to be deputy director
of the cdc anyway
the real moneys in the private sector
are you sure about this
oh yeah
listen it may not seem like much now
but i got your research files
and original samples
so
if we survive this
you guys will get the credit
thank you
its nothing
let me get it
no i got it
sorry excuse me
we havent been formally introduced
im wayne gray
im kind of with him

professor kane
arizona its going down baby
this may not be the best time
to be drinking
i was your first we discovered you
in that cave you were scared and alone
it was just you me and harry
those were good times
so why not level with me now
you can trust me just talk to me
tell me the secret tell me the answer
tell me how to kill you
you are losing it pal
what is that stuff anyway
some of the original liquid material
from inside the meteor
why hasnt it evolved like the rest
i dont know maybe being refrigerated
being in an airtight case nothing to
metabolise with but weve still no clue
when did you start smoking
not much of a point
to clean living anymore
they react to fire like it was miraclegro
fire
the organisms were dormant in space
they hit earths atmosphere and bam
heat fire thats the catalyst
so if a tiny match catalyses
this stuff like this
whats a ton of napalm going to do
so much for the military option
better call that dick general
thats a lot of napalm
yes it is
were going to blow those creatures
straight to hell
well flush them out along the mine shafts
then mop up the edges as they
run trying to escape the flames
excuse me sir
theres an urgent call from dr reed
she says she has important information
about the mission
oh really
well unfortunately im not available
anything more
no sir
he blew me off can you believe it
he wouldnt even take my call
you did call him an asshole
dr k
we got beer
time to party
ill take one of those
me too i just quit smoking
what are you boys doing here
thought you could use a brew
so you can mellow out
kick back and chill
have a beer relax
itll help with your research
yeah help with your research
look at that thing
can we have that
when youre done with it
fellas thanks for the beers
but were working
hold it
look
what are you doing
selenium it could be the answer
im looking at the periodic table
on your tshirt im seeing a pattern
take off your shirt
yes
no
all right look
we are a carbonbased life form
keep pulling
we move down here
and you find our poison arsenic
but the aliens are nitrogenbased right
you make the same move
down and over
and where do you find yourself
selenium
it could be as lethal to them
as arsenic is to us
with their metabolic rates
itll kill them fast
selenium how much do we need
five hundred gallons should do it
five hundred gallons
i hate to be a buzzkill
but where will we get that at 200 am
no problem
we can get that
head  shoulders
the dandruff shampoo
yeah thats the stuff
the active ingredient is selenium sulphide
how do you know that
you dont know anything
havent you noticed
how shiny and flakefree our hair is
okay this is the best idea we got
lets give it a shot come on
well get the troops together
were getting shampoo
i have the perfect vehicle
good donalds you just got your as
almost full
theres something i should tell you
but i dont know exactly how
just say it were adults and were
about to die a horrible death soon anyway
i would have rocked your world
you already have
all full
battle stations
can we continue this discussion later
lets do this
lets shampoo us some aliens
lots of soldiers around
theres an old mine half a click south
we can sneak into the cave through there
half a click what are you in vietnam
hey im digging this work with me
its over here its right here

im good
lets go
lets do this
you sure this leads to the main cavern
itll lead somewhere
geologys not an exact science
where are you
where are you my little aliens
show yourself
warm to the touch
highly acidic
weve no time for you
to act like you know what youre doing
what happened to the respect
woodmans going at noon
we have to hurry

survival of the fittest often
the simplest organism is the strongest

some sort of spaz attack
thats not spazzing out
its getting ready to divide
mitosis

a bit of the kane madness
fighting the alien menace
