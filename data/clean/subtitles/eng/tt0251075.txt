bad move 
and the fire begins 
it s showtime 
don t worry  ma am  i m here to save you 
keep those people back 
this is an emergency 
don t you dare die on me 
breathe  damn it  breathe 
she s going to make it 
what the    
damn 
though it may be hard to believe
a single biology professor   
   making in excess of  17 500 a year
could find time   
   to grade your first biology
research papers  i did 
as you can see 
there was a shocking statistical anomaly 
pretty much all of you got a s 
congratulate yourselves 
i have a good feeling about this group 
and i think the parade of a s
will continue to the end of the semester 
so much for the bell curve 
bell curves suck 
  mr  kane 
  dr  kane 
there seems to be a mistake here 
my brother and i each got a c  
c   me  too 
allow me to share something
with the entire class 
as i was grading papers  i came across
two gems  both entitled  cells are bad  
both with just one paragraph  which
i unfortunately committed to memory 
 cells are bad  
 my uncle lives in a cell  
 it s 10 by 12 and he has to read
the same boring magazine every day  
 the end  
you re talking about our papers 
aren t you  dr  kane 
yes  i am 
and although my standards
are nowhere near where they used to be   
   i couldn t put an a on those beauties 
i hope you understand 
  sure 
  yeah  okay 
okay  let s get back to work
at the periodic table  which   
a meteor  where 
route 89a  yeah  i got it 
rest assured  i will be there  okay   bye 
how does it look  professor 
it s tight 
really  really tight  nadine 
but not too tight 
you just don t have the points  sorry 
don t take it too hard 
geology s tougher than people think 
are you sure  could you check again 
i need this credit
to get into nursing school 
nursing school 
wouldn t you prefer a different profession 
one where lives
were not dependent on you 
actually  what i want to be
is miss arizona 
but my pageant consultant says
nursing school will impress the judges 
they ll think i want to help people   
ready for lunch 
or have you already eaten 
i m just concluding
a teacher student conference with nadine 
harry  your dedication to your job
is an inspiration to us all 
regrettably  i have a prior lunch
engagement with professor kane 
we ll discuss your extra credit later 
cheer up 
let me grab my stuff 
where are you taking me 
  a meteor hit last night 
  that s what that was 
as glen canyon s representative
for the u s  geological survey   
   i have to check it out 
i m taking you in case
i have to do something scientific 
then we eat 
you re with the usgs 
i signed up over the internet 
or were you on a cheerleader site and
accidentally got linked to the usgs site 
something like that 
watch it  take it easy 
that s my baby  take it easy 
come on  be careful 
who s going to pay for the damage
to my goddamn car 
i told you  we don t do that 
it s  force majeure  
 force majeure   my ass 
that car s a classic  73 buick riv 
who are you 
harry block 
united states geological survey 
my secretary  ira kane 
we re here to investigate the meteor   
   if that is what it is 
of course it is  it almost blew up my car 
i m still fuzzy
on why you were here at night 
with betty lou here 
i was practicing for my fireman s exam 
which started seven minutes ago 
so i d appreciate it if you d let me go 
so you and the blonde found the meteor 
yeah  i found it 
it bounced my car 200 feet in the air 
  can i go 
  bob  get him out of here 
don t leave town 
well  sheriff  is this the   
   point of penetration 
yeah  it punched through into a cavern
about 80 feet down 
now that s a hole 
damn it 
next time  you carry the case 
you re the usgs representative 
that responsibility comes with the badge 
oh  my god  look at that 
i believe we ve located the target 
two big smiles  fellas 
cheese 
okay  hold it up now 
  got it 
  it s really hot 
i ll hold you up 
show a little more nightstick 
look at these jackasses 
muscle pose  give me big smiles 
looking good 
at ease  gentlemen  the feds are here 
feds  what feds 
who let you down here 
let s not get combative 
the usgs and local law enforcement
have a long history of cooperation 
we re just here to get
some scientific samples  if that s okay 
yeah  sure  we got
all the photographic evidence we need 
  carry on 
  thanks  keep up the good work 
wow 
it just hit last night
and it has stuff growing on it 
could be cave moss 
after just a few hours  that s peculiar 
let s get a sample and get out of here 
it s bleeding 
it s a rock that bleeds 
now that s really peculiar 
let s bag it 
i don t know if this usgs gig
is all it s cracked up to be 
i mean  it pads out my résumé 
but am i growing as a person 
am i growing as a division 3
women s volleyball coach 
you going to do that spectro thingy test 
spectrograph 
yeah  i will do a spectroscopic analysis 
your résumé will shine 
i got to get to the game 
let me know if you find anything 
ira  are you sure you can handle this
by your lonesome 
all right 
that s impossible 
ten base pairs 
that can t be 
come on  ladies  look alive up here 
tina  when lisa goes for the spike 
you have to cover the line 
lisa  two hands  okay  two hands 
god gave you two hands for a reason 
big news  the most amazing thing 
the meteor samples are teeming
with one celled organisms 
their metabolic rates are off the charts 
they re dividing at an incredible rate 
almost exponential 
their dna has ten base pairs 
ten base pairs  that s good to know 
harry  the dna of all earth life
has only four base pairs 
come on  ladies  look alive 
harry   
   these are organisms from another world 
they re aliens 
is the nobel prize paid in instalments
or a lump sum  like the lottery 
let s not get ahead of ourselves 
i m not  i m concerned about
the potential tax consequences 
  why in here 
  i just want to be cautious 
our discovery 
i m all tingly 
wow 
i m no biologist  but how many cells
do single celled organisms have 
if we want to be big important scientists 
you have to act the part 
take a look 
there are multi cellular organisms in there 
i know 
  they weren t there before 
  they snuck in 
no  there was no sneaking in 
it s too amazing 
it s like they re evolving 
they re growing 
growing into more complex organisms 
it s evolution 
nobel  here we come 
but it s 200 million years worth
in just a few hours 
that s fast 
you have no idea 
get ready 
on my signal  go 
recruit  wake up 
wake up 
go 
  the hose  this thing here 
  sorry 
move it 
wayne  go  come on 
these things happen  buddy 
there s another test in six months 
six months  i can t wait six months 
at least you have the pool gig
at the country club 
great  thanks a lot 
drive careful 
i got it  i do this 
looks like we have visitors 
class  since this is our first field trip 
i want you to obey some simple rules 
dirt 
nice footwear 
perfect for spelunking 
now don t touch anything 
don t move anything 
don t even breathe unless we say 
wear your protective gloves at all times 
why do we have to do this 
field experience 
the meat and potatoes of geology 
  will this be on the final 
  yes 
  officer  nice to see you 
  what s up  professor 
we came to pick up the rock 
pick it up  what 
orders from the usgs 
they want it under controlled conditions 
it s very technical 
oh  technical stuff  it s technical 
okay  go right ahead 
  we ll just haul it right out 
  sure 
deke and danny 
remember what we talked about 
you re in charge of hoisting 
get the winch to the hole 
fellas  stop nodding  and stare at me
for a second  okay 
focus 
  you understand what i want you to do 
  yeah 
go do it 
ira  i m picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here 
yeah  a lot has changed 
class  i know these look like mushrooms 
but refrain from eating them 
it smells disgusting 
nadine  sometimes science stinks 
it s the game we play  baby 
rotten egg smell  hydrogen sulfide  right 
with ammonia and methane 
it s converting the atmosphere 
look at all this rudimentary plant life 
it s amazing 
not to get all girly here  but i feel
something wiggling around my toes 
the ground does seem to be moving 
flatworms 
millions of them 
yuck 
barely 18 hours
and we already have flatworms 
  look 
  there they are 
hi  dr  kane 
  i almost went down on that one 
  awesome 
come here  little buddy 
i won t hurt you 
you didn t hurt it  you killed it 
the oxygen must have killed it 
it must need its own atmosphere to live 
grab a specimen jar  we ll scoop
some atmosphere in there with them 
it took us two billion years to do
what they did in a couple of days 
those germs are the embodiment
of the american dream 
i m sorry to interrupt  professor block 
but i was wondering if i m correct
in assuming that that field trip   
   fulfilled any of my missing
credit assignments 
nadine  you are a very   
   very smart girl  if you would just focus 
professor  the little wiggly worm things
are breaking 
ira  look 
it s not breaking  it s splitting 
it s mitosis  that s how they reproduce 
no sex 
no time for sex 
bummer 
  they re splitting again 
  put it away 
we call no one  we tell no one 
this is our secret 
what about the government 
they usually get involved 
  no government  i know those people 
  you do 
this is our discovery 
we must maintain absolute control 
we have to do more research and
check our findings  document everything 
wayne 
what s this 
that would be an all cotton towel  sir 
i believe it s a fieldcrest 
it s a damp towel 
what is a damp towel doing on my  chaise  
  let me take care of this for you 
  you should  as pool manager 
if anyone knows what to do
about the dampness on my chair  it s you 
 you know what to do with the towels
because you re the pool boy  
what the hell 
where did you guys come from 
you re dead now 
when i checked the samples this morning
i found three different subspecies 
they re evolving so quickly god knows
what we ll find when we get back 
  please tell me there s an air show today 
  damn 
shit 
can i help you 
harry block  ira kane 
united states geological society 
we re doing some important research 
this is our site 
not anymore  you re not on the list 
what  we come here all the time 
well this is not a nightclub 
why don t you take it somewhere else 
i know my constitutional rights 
you can t tell   
harry  maybe you can call your superior 
we can have a word with him 
i have a harry block and an ira kane here   
punk 
  talk nice to the white man 
  i ll whup his ass 
white man doesn t like to be yelled at 
ira kane 
the ira kane 
i ve looked forward to this for a long time 
you bastard 
you re history  you re done 
get his gun 
take it easy  okay  they re going up 
you re responsible for the worst month
of my life 
  what the hell was that about 
  i don t know 
drive down to the command tent 
they re expecting you 
go 
that guy had me in diapers
for over a month 
what the hell was that 
  general woodman s expecting you 
  russell woodman 
what an unexpected surprise 
for me  too 
i didn t know we were on a hugging basis 
same old ira kane  and you are 
harry block  this is gen  russell woodman 
head of u s  army research 
you two know each other 
ira used to work for me  right 
i worked with you  actually 
you worked in army research
in the pentagon 
all this time i thought you were just
a schoolteacher 
no  how did you find out about this 
you leave the pentagon 
you don t call  you don t write 
we like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons 
you tapped my phone 
no  we re not the kgb 
we ve been monitoring your computer 
his computer 
all those girls in the photos are over 18 
yes  i m sure 
i should have figured  russell 
you should ve known better than
to keep something this big from us 
and the cdc 
just in time  ira  this is allison reed 
senior researcher in epidemiology at   
   the cdc 
nice underwear 
a garter belt  at a day function 
i can do it  thank you 
i m okay 
dr  kane 
i d heard about your recklessness
but you are way out of line on this one 
didn t you realise how dangerous
the situation could have become 
nice to meet you  too 
no need to play the blame game  allison 
no harm  no foul 
we re all appreciative about the discovery
made by dr  kane and mr  black 
block 
block  i m sorry 
the confirmation that life exists
outside this planet   
would be the greatest
scientific discovery of our time 
  yes  actually 
  yes  it would 
you have my word you ll be
kept in the loop from this point on 
you son of a bitch 
kept in the loop  we are the loop 
we won t cut you out
but we need to take control 
we re following protocol  ira 
you remember protocol  don t you 
i have some protocol right here for you 
come and get it 
look  the fact is  this research
must continue under government control 
we ve already secured the area 
we re constructing an airlock
and a state of the art field research facility 
so there s not a whole lot
for the science department   
   of glen canyon community college
to do here 
did you catch that condescending tone 
we are following well established
federal guidelines   
please  don t pull this crap 
we deserve to be here 
you deserve to be here 
you re lucky anybody s ever let you
near a science laboratory again 
you re a disgrace 
and a dangerous one at that 
lieutenant  show these men out 
this is horseshit 
it s not over 
you re in for a fight  russell 
would you stop following me  thank you 
we won t bend over and take this 
fruit basket for russell woodman 
happy holidays  general 
cute 
dr  kane  are you asking me to bar
the federal government from involvement   
   in a discovery as significant as this one 
no  we re asking you to ensure the local
scientists who made the discovery   
   continue to play a significant role 
they ve kept us out for almost two weeks 
we put our lives on the line to find
these little guys  your majesty 
we just want to be there for them
as they grow up 
we were first team at the meteor site and
all the initial testing was done in our lab 
the facilities at glen canyon
community college are a joke 
they weren t a joke
when i went there  general 
your honour  if the court would allow me
to depose dr  kane 
depose me 
we think your past
is very relevant  dr  kane 
these issues speak directly
to his competence as a scientist 
dr  kane  you were a top level researcher
at usamrid from  94 to  97   
   were you not 
that s correct 
you were summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997  any idea why 
my services were no longer required 
so your firing had nothing to do
with an experimental anthrax vaccine   
   you developed and administered to
140 000 u s  soldiers in may of that year 
i see where you re going with this 
it may have been a factor 
you need to ask the joint chiefs of staff 
i ll do that  for now  can you tell me
what happened   
   to the soldiers who were inoculated 
none of them got anthrax 
if that s what you re asking 
what did they get 
well  as with any new vaccine   
   there were certain side effects
associated with   
could you be more specific 
it s very technical 
i d hate to waste the court s time with it 
humour me 
some debilitating stomach cramps 
severe diarrhoea 
memory loss 
yes  go on  any more symptoms 
partial facial paralysis 
temporary blindness  drooling   
   bleeding gums  erectile dysfunction   
   uncontrollable flatulence 
i think that s it 
one more question 
do you remember
what the soldiers called this illness 
they called it the kane madness 
keep your head up 
you know she wants to give you some 
were you even in that courtroom 
getting barbecued like babyback ribs 
it s all foreplay 
we ve been hit 
forget the foreplay  we just got screwed 
  empty 
  this is bad  this is very  very bad 
damn it 
i don t care who they are 
stealing is stealing 
they took the rock  the samples 
all the little wormy critters 
all the data s gone  the jpeg files 
the dna sequences  they cleaned us out 
  i m calling the cops 
  the cops 
they are the cops 
then what 
let me ask you something 
how come you get to be a colonel
and i m just a private 
i was a colonel 
and you obviously served
your country with distinction 
consider yourself lucky 
the penalty for impersonating an officer
is five years in prison 
maybe for you  white boy  me  they hang 
colonels first 
we been out here for twelve hours 
my toe is starting to hurt 
stop it 
  just act like you belong 
  don t worry  i got this 
  pick up that butt  soldier 
  sorry  sir 
  and tuck that shirt in 
  yes  sir 
get the door 
thank you  private 
don t get used to this 
look at that 
enjoy your lunch  gentlemen 
your girlfriend  11 00 
darn it 
the woman s a menace 
testing  one  two 
this is dj harry block here
and i m an aquarius 
stop  i can hear you 
don t snap at me  unless you want
an angry  solid gold  dancer on your hands 
lieutenant 
who s that 
i don t know 
i don t have anything on my schedule 
maybe it s the guys from sector 12
doing a nocturnal specimen run 
you know how those guys are 
this place has changed 
can you believe this 
harry  look at that 
our little babies are growing up 
three weeks 
it s already like a rain forest in here 
looks like the kitchen
from my first apartment 
harry   
   check that guy out 
is it coming or going 
that tree just ate it 
everything here seems to be food for
something else  so let s stay off the menu 
you got that right 
come here  look at these little things 
cool 
snag one 
snag one 
yeah  snag one and put it in the bucket 
i ve seen this movie 
the black dude dies first  you snag it 
don t be scared 
we came for a specimen  now snag one 
he won t hurt you 
he s turned the other way  he s eating 
come on 
come on  my little red lobster 
come on  my sexy little crustacean 
look at that backside 
theatre in the round  that s the kind of
trunk space you want in a late model car 
who does that remind you of 
i have no idea what you re talking about 
she s been throwing it at you enough 
  dr  reed 
  bull s eye 
excuse me  dr  reed 
did you authorise a walk through 
no  why 
you should probably
take a look at something 
here 
that s the kind of rump you d like to roast 
kind of mother you d like to butter 
that is a nice image 
and i appreciate your assumption   
    that there is
an actual sexual human being   
    underneath
all dr  reed s deep seated neuroses   
   but i don t think so 
  what 
i think she is a humourless ice queen 
that s just a cover  don t you know that 
all she needs is a good humping 
oh  ira  ira 
we have to get a piece of the asteroid 
and cut that out  it disturbs me 
don t do that behind my back like that 
  i m not doing it 
  cut it out 
i m just walking 
let s bag that and get the hell out of here 
i m ready when you are  colonel 
this disco suit is making me chafe 
shoo  fly 
hold it  right there 
dr  reed  nice to see you again 
we were just leaving 
you realise you re in violation of the
judge s orders  i could have you arrested 
talk about violations  what about our lab 
anyone have a can of raid 
  what are you talking about 
  you stole our computer files  our samples 
  i didn t steal anything 
  your buddies did 
  they cleaned us out 
  no  we didn t 
damn right 
you ve been trying to grab credit   
   on our discovery from the beginning 
we just want what s rightfully ours 
credit has nothing to do with it 
i m concerned with public safety 
  is any of this true  flemming 
  absolutely not 
  something s in my suit 
  you re not going to believe him 
something s in my suit 
  what 
  there s something in my suit 
that s impossible  it s sealed 
the fly  there s a fly in my suit 
take off your helmet  turn up the oxygen 
it ll kill it 
do you see it  look  do you see it 
no 
  you re all right  who s the man 
  you are 
  no  you re the man 
  i m the man 
  you re the man 
  okay 
oh  god 
it s in me 
for the love of everything holy 
get this thing out of me 
you ll be okay  cut him open and get it 
cut me open 
there goes your christmas gift  you judas 
it s moving down his leg 
  what do we do 
  might have to amputate 
don t take my leg 
don t let them take my leg 
anything else you can do 
he thinks he s an athlete 
doctor  look 
it s heading for his testicles 
take it  take the leg 
wait 
it s going the other way 
give me some forceps 
i might be able to catch it in his colon 
  how will you go in 
  rectally 
i ll get the lubricant 
  no time 
  there s always time for lubricant 
flip him 
okay  here we go 
  you have to try to relax 
  it ll be okay 
i ll shove this gurney up your ass 
see if you relax 
cheek spreader

i ve flunked in my life 
a ton 
pool boy  you watering down the mai tais

i don t get it  how does someone
with your background   
   credentials  and talent end up   
   like you 
thank you 
your partner could have died 
what were you thinking 
i was desperate 
i ve been exiled out here in arizona
for five years   
   watching the world pass me by   
   and this amazing discovery
falls into my lap  it s my ticket out of here 
i don t suppose you would understand that 
no  how could i  i m just a humourless
ice maiden in need of a good humping 
you heard that 
loud and clear 
don t think you know so much about me 
you don t 
i m sure i don t 
thank you for not calling the cops 
  be careful 
  stop being such a baby 
we ve seen that car before 
no more bran for me 
hey  girls 
cut it out 
it s the meteor guy 
what s in the bag  your blow up doll 
no  i ve got something
you re really going to like 
  what happened to you 
  shut up 
you guys teach here 
i was thinking about taking some classes   
   but i decided to hit the job market
early and get a jump start on things 
can we help you 
a guy got killed
at my country club last night 
a real douchebag  but   
   that just doesn t make it right 
it was an animal attack 
isn t that something 
happened by the water hazard on the 4th
green  the lady he was banging saw it 
we chased this sucker on the fairway 
then it died in a sand trap 
it just died  how 
like it was choking to death 
you know  stopped breathing 
it s like nothing i ever saw before 
i thought you guys might want to see it 
jill  you ve got some kind
of infestation here 
you have a serious bug problem 
jill  there s something in your closet 
open the door  grace 
me  it s your house 
when did you guys get a dog 
we don t have a damn dog 
i don t think that s a dog 
it s like some kind of rodent 
or a muskrat or a pig 
how did it get in here 
it doesn t look too healthy  does it 
well  it s frightened 
he can barely breathe  he s so scared 
come on  cutie pie 
don t be afraid 
come on  that s a good boy   
911 
what the hell is that thing 
thanks 
pick me up in an hour  no  two 
well  an hour and a half would be good 
hi  do you have any messages for me 
two single beds  please  we re fighting 
come on  i m tired  i ve had two hours
of sleep  i need a shower 
they re spreading 
you mean the golf course  woodman sent
a team out there two hours ago 
too bad you missed the 5 foot
amphibian that s lying dead in my lab 
they re adapting 
we have got to shut it down 
you re overreacting  we can handle this 
i used to be arrogant like you 
we re both aware of what that led to 
take me seriously  allison 
i do take you seriously 
then talk to woodman 
because he won t listen to me 
we have to kill these things
while we still can 
all right  i ll talk to him 
but i can t promise anything 
thank you 
just one more thing 
could you ever be attracted to me 
   bye  ira 
  just food for thought 
she s mine 
i ve been an adjunct professor
for almost four years 
i m hoping this whole alien brouhaha will

what happened to my missing shirts 
did i tell you  she left
with two or three of my shirts 
see what i mean

but is it against the law to   
   walk out of someone s house
with what they own 
you want your shirt  seriously  take it

calm down

10 99 responding 
  got to go  babe 
  now 
they re calling 
be careful out there 
you ll take care of the check  right 
i want those shirts back  denise 
you have to admit  this animal attack
has kind of an ominous feel  doesn t it 
  check it out 
  check it out 
all right 
looks like we re under the microscope 
so let s be subtle  no cowboy stuff  okay 
  no problem 
  professionals 
officer johnson 
what are you doing here 
we heard about the attack 
part of our job
is to ascertain if there s any health risk 
no  not this time  forget about it 
  you didn t touch it  right 
  that would be a serious no no 
  you did  he touched it 
  he shouldn t have touched it 
  what do we do 
  i don t know 
okay  why don t you come in
and take a look 
i ll be checking things out   
   around here in this vicinity 
this dog is all ass 
jeez  ira  look at this  man 
he would have come from in here  right 
it s just used for storage
and access under the house 
looks like he crawled through the dirt 
hey  guys 
i was conducting   
   a parameter check 
and there s something you better see 
you liked that thing 
you re going to love this 
what is it 
what is it 
great googa mooga 
what did i tell you 
they re crawling out 
they re trying to breathe
in our atmosphere 
fortunately  they haven t been able
to adapt yet 
  i think i know how these things got here 
  how 
this entire area is just a honeycomb
of caves and old mine shafts 
i believe the moenave cave system
starts a few miles away   
   west of the golf course 
it runs into the foothills  continues to   
   the kaibab plateau
and goes right into lake powell 
our cave   
   is smack dab in the middle
of the system  it s all connected 
  could you repeat that 
  i m impressed 
beneath this calm  sexy exterior
beats the heart of a true scientist 
that one s moving 
what the hell is it doing 
i think it s trying to breathe 
that s like a big loogie 
 mazel tov   it s a boy 
it s oxygen tolerant 
it s flying away  is that a bad thing 
only if you re a human being 
you know how i hate shopping 
  you need something for thanksgiving 
  i have enough clothes 
i think that colour is great on you 
i think this may be the place 
ever used one of these before 
just  cause i m a teacher
don t make me a pussy 
ladies  there s a flying extraterrestrial
in the store  can we focus 
i m in here  just a minute 
just a second  please 
i said  just a second  bitch 
how would you like me
to scratch out your eyes 
here  birdy birdy birdy birdy birdy 
if i was a giant  nasty alien bird
in a department store  where would i be 
  lingerie 
  not you  the bird 
lingerie 
help 
you go low  i m going high 
we ll never find this damn thing 
i lost him 
how do you lose a 20 foot bird in a mall 
i don t know 
what do we do now 
wayne 
i think we ve established that
 ca caw  and  tookie tookie  don t work 
right  sorry 
so what do you say  ira  pack it in 
step back  i m going to shoot him 
stand down  i ll kill this one myself 
give me a chance 
i m communicating here 
wayne  please stop 
you are embarrassing me 
it s working 
sing  rub some funk on it 
here he comes 
you grab the girl  i ll get the bird 
all right  nice shot 
i am so sorry  i swear to god   
   i will never shoplift again 
good 
so what do you want  light meat or dark 
you have to ask 
it s dead now 
i m standing at the edge of
the valley vista housing community   
    where just below me are dozens of giant 
odd looking  dead creatures 
we should stress that  to this point 
we have had no official word from   
this ugly tentacle came out of the ground
and tried to grab my private parts 
i batted it away  it got my hand 
there is anxiety and confusion
in the glen canyon area 
we re outside the state capitol building
awaiting comment from the governor   
    concerning the nature and origin
of these extraordinary creatures 
governor lewis  this way 
can someone tell me
why i was not informed   
   that we have aliens
crawling all over my beloved state 
right now  400 media vultures
are camped outside my office 
they know more about this than i do 
i should throw the bunch of you
into prison 
not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits 
state prison  with crotch binders 
i m sorry  but there were earlier security
breaches by dr  kane and his team 
wait a minute  no  no  excuse me 
that s not exactly true  gen  woodman 
i believe the governor s question
was directed at me 
put a plug in it 
i m not interested in bureaucratic crapola 
i want to know how bad this thing is 
it s bad  governor 
according to the new ground sensors
and satellite thermal scans   
   they indicate a potential problem 
i can t read this  what kind of problem 
someone take this bag of snakes
and lay them out straight 
allow me 
  and you are 
  dr  allison reed 
carla  would you mind 
the red markings indicate the growth
of the alien ecosystem 
unless we act immediately 
we will lose glen canyon in three days 
great merciful christ 
in a week  the rest of arizona 
then  the entire southwest 
in two months  the united states
officially belongs to them 
and we are extinct 
you must be shitting me 
admit it  you re glad to see us 
yes  i am  call the mp s 
have them arrested 
we just blew a giant alien bird out of
a store  we re covering up your mess 
i m dr  ira kane 
chairman of the science department   
   glen canyon community college 
this is my associate 
harry block  adjunct professor of geology 
voted for you 
wayne gray 
i took some chemistry in high school 
you two are the original discoverers
of the phenomena  correct 
yes  and they re also responsible
for the mess we re in now 
here we go 
they broke into the contained area 
breaching security procedures 
disseminating the alien organisms
outside the secured area 
liar  liar  pants on fire 
criminal charges are in order 
  this is bullshit 
  it is not 
shut up all of you  listen 
my state is being overrun by aliens 
now you re supposed to be experts 
i want to know  and quick 
how will you deal with this 
this is an outline of the infected area
as of this afternoon 
my plan is to evacuate everyone
from within five miles of the perimeter 
you re talking about 10 000 people 
yes  sir  we evacuate  make it safe   
   then burn the alien menace
the hell out of there 
with what 
with napalm  lots and lots of napalm 
napalm  why don t you just nuke them 
what about nukes 
nobody s dropping an h bomb on my state 
all this talk about napalm
and burning makes me nervous 
and we don t know how they d react
to such an attack on a cellular level 
governor  it s time for a military solution 
this will work 
general  sorry to interrupt 
you better take a look at this 
what 
you called me out for this 
sir  one of the creatures
just destroyed video four 
what s going on down there 
my god  they ve evolved into primates 
that s a face for radio 
they took out six and seven 
all the monitors are down 
well  that can t be good 
that s the elevator 
we have no personnel down there 
they breached the air lock 
the fuzzy no nose chimp 
call for backup 
we need backup 
they re coming through the elevator 
they re coming through the elevator 
  cover the elevator 
  give me a sidearm 
okay  just stay behind me 
get off me  i want to see 
be prepared to fire 
it s empty  sir 
the governor  don t shoot 
help 
do something 
hold your fire  you ll get someone killed 
nice shot 
i ll take that now 
you have my full support
to do whatever you need to do   
   however much firepower it takes 
melt the place down to beaded glass 
if that s what it takes 
get these hellish creazoids
out of my state 
thank you  governor 
i ll be ready to go by noon tomorrow 
good  sir 
  where ve you two been 
  just getting out of the way   
get me out of here 
science project is over 
i want you and your people gone 
soldier  escort these men out 
don t you have work to do 
you are such an asshole 
when a woman expresses anger 
it s often because   
shut up  flemming 
okay  i know where the car is 
wipe my ass  too 
hey  guys 
got room for one more 
hell  yeah 
who wants to be deputy director
of the cdc  anyway 
the real money s in the private sector 
  are you sure about this 
  oh  yeah 
listen  it may not seem like much now   
   but i got your research files
and original samples 
so   
   if we survive this 
you guys will get the credit 
thank you 
  it s nothing 
  let me get it 
no  i got it 
sorry  excuse me 
we haven t been formally introduced 
i m wayne gray 
i m kind of with him 
that s cool 
buckle up  allison  we re rolling 
oh  my goodness 
facilities are being provided for you
and your families 
please move in an orderly fashion 
they re going to blow up the whole town 
hey  hold on 
where the hell you going 
we need to clear this area  people 
for your own safety 
evacuate immediately 
professor kane 
arizona  it s going down  baby 
this may not be the best time
to be drinking 
i was your first  we discovered you
in that cave  you were scared and alone 
it was just you  me and harry 
those were good times 
so  why not level with me now 
you can trust me  just talk to me 
tell me the secret  tell me the answer 
tell me how to kill you 
you are losing it  pal 
what is that stuff anyway 
some of the original liquid material
from inside the meteor 
  why hasn t it evolved like the rest 
  i don t know  maybe being refrigerated 
being in an airtight case  nothing to
metabolise with  but we ve still no clue   
when did you start smoking 
not much of a point
to clean living anymore 
they react to fire like it was miracle gro 
fire 
the organisms were dormant in space 
they hit earth s atmosphere and bam 
heat  fire  that s the catalyst 
so if a tiny match catalyses
this stuff like this   
   what s a ton of napalm going to do 
so much for the military option 
better call that dick general 
  that s a lot of napalm 
  yes  it is 
we re going to blow those creatures
straight to hell 
we ll flush them out along the mine shafts
then mop up the edges as they   
   run trying to escape the flames 
excuse me  sir 
there s an urgent call from dr  reed 
she says she has important information
about the mission 
oh  really 
well  unfortunately  i m not available 
anything more 
no  sir 
he blew me off  can you believe it 
  he wouldn t even take my call 
  you did call him an asshole 
dr  k 
  we got beer 
  time to party 
  i ll take one of those 
  me  too  i just quit smoking 
what are you boys doing here 
thought you could use a brew
so you can mellow out 
kick back and chill 
have a beer  relax 
it ll help with your research 
yeah  help with your research 
look at that thing 
can we have that
when you re done with it 
fellas  thanks for the beers 
but we re working 
hold it 
  look 
  what are you doing 
selenium  it could be the answer 
i m looking at the periodic table
on your t shirt  i m seeing a pattern 
take off your shirt 
yes 
  no 
  all right  look 
we are a carbon based life form 
keep pulling 
we move down here
and you find our poison  arsenic 
but the aliens are nitrogen based  right 
you make the same move   
   down and over 
and where do you find yourself 
selenium 
it could be as lethal to them
as arsenic is to us 
with their metabolic rates 
it ll kill them fast 
selenium  how much do we need 
five hundred gallons should do it 
five hundred gallons 
i hate to be a buzzkill 
but where will we get that at 2 00 a m  
no problem 
we can get that 
head   shoulders 
the dandruff shampoo 
yeah  that s the stuff 
the active ingredient is selenium sulphide 
how do you know that 
you don t know anything 
haven t you noticed
how shiny and flake free our hair is 
okay  this is the best idea we got 
let s give it a shot  come on 
we ll get the troops together 
we re getting shampoo 
i have the perfect vehicle 
good  donalds  you just got your a s 
almost full 
there s something i should tell you 
but i don t know exactly how 
just say it  we re adults and we re
about to die a horrible death soon anyway 
i would have rocked your world 
  you already have 
  all full 
battle stations 
can we continue this discussion later 
let s do this 
let s shampoo us some aliens 
lots of soldiers around 
there s an old mine half a click south 
we can sneak into the cave through there 
 half a click   what are you  in vietnam 
hey  i m digging this  work with me 
it s over here  it s right here 
  are you okay 
  i m good 
let s go 
let s do this 
you sure this leads to the main cavern 
it ll lead somewhere 
geology s not an exact science 
where are you 
where are you  my little aliens 
show yourself 
warm to the touch 
highly acidic 
we ve no time for you
to act like you know what you re doing 
what happened to the respect 
woodman s going at noon 
we have to hurry 
  good  are the troops in place 
  ahead of schedule 
excellent  we can go early 
oh  no  what is he doing here 
governor lewis 
i don t see anything burning 
where are all the explosions 
we re just getting underway 
i didn t know you were coming to watch 
well  better make it a good one  sergeant 
that s general 
not if you screw this up 
keeping my chair warm for me 
thank you 
i ll take a pair of spy glasses
and a hot chocolate 
give me the hose 
get up top  when i give the signal 
start pumping the selenium 
got it 
we ll spray all around the meteor   
   then get out of here as fast as we can 
blue monkey 
wayne  charge the line now 
that s the napalm 
woodman went early 
bad 
wayne  come on 
i m out 
we ve got to go 
go  faster  get up there 
run for your life 
quite a bonfire we ve got 
should have brought some wieners

  first reports are excellent  sir 
  very good 
keep it together  wayne 
oh  my god 
what s happening

  what s coming 
get the hell out of here 
  great flaming whore balls 
  general  look 
hurry 
  drive 
  go 
all right 
fall back 
what the hell is that thing 
the napalm forced an evolutionary
response  like the match in the petri dish 
that s evolution 
survival of the fittest  often 
the simplest organism is the strongest 
guys  it s freaking out 
it s starting to have
some sort of spaz attack 
that s not spazzing out 
it s getting ready to divide 
mitosis 
wait  there s going to be more
of these things 
  a lot more 
  its cycle is starting again 
it will go on growing and doubling
until it takes over 
but we were here first 
so that head   shoulders idea 
is that still the plan 
i m driving 
so what if he s on  air force one  
it has phones  i ve seen them 
i don t think this can wait an hour 
what s that fire truck doing out there 
mama 
can you believe this 
we have to find a point of attack 
there 
nasty 
allison  stop  right here 
here we go 
get the ladder up 
feed me the hose  deke 
  what are you doing 
  going up top 
not before me

go  go  go 
we don t have much time  guys  hurry 
  left 
  left 
got it 
i haven t had much practice with this 
stop 
  what s going on 
  i don t know  but it s getting bigger 
what are they doing with that ladder 
looks like they re getting ready
to administer a jumbo enema 
we got one shot  let s do this 
it s payback time 
keep it in there 
what s it look like i m doing 
it s working 
shit 
what the hell 
oh  my god

she s going to blow 
stop kicking 
it s horrible in here 
  i got you 
  help me

dear lord 
uh oh  time to go 
go 
we did it 
here we go  sir  just relax
and we ll have you as good as new 
i am happy to report
that all remaining traces   
   of the alien menace
have been eradicated   
   using the selenium shampoo formula
developed right here 
let me introduce our civilian scientist
heroes and their team   
   the best the great state of arizona
has been privileged to produce 
so this is your moment  you wouldn t
want to miss this for anything 
firstly  i would like you all
to meet wayne gray 
as of today  a fully credentialed fire fighter 
i spoke to the chief 
thanks  governor 
now  our next hero   
   professor harry block  noted geologist   
   and winningest coach
in north arizona women s volleyball 
i appreciate that  governor 
first  i thank god 
with him  all things are possible 
we just played tough defence 
took it one alien at a time   
   and came away with the big w 
and finally   
   doctors ira kane and allison reed   
   whose tireless efforts  research 
and academic findings led to the   
i think he s giving her
a bit of the kane madness 
fighting the alien menace
