is kind of a problem 
since i always feel
uncomfortable around crowds 
i mean it  i have this fear
of enclosed spaces 
i i i    everything makes me
feel trapped all the time 
i always tell myself there s gotta be
something better out there 
but maybe i   
maybe i think too much 
i think everything must go back to the
fact that i had a very anxious childhood 
you know  my mother
never had time for me 
when you re the middle child
in a family of five million 
you don t get any attention 
i mean  how is it possible 
i ve always had these abandonment issues
which plague me 
my father was basically a drone 
like i ve said 
and  you know  the guy flew away
when i was just a larva 
and my job  don t get me started on 
because it really annoys me 
i i was not cut out to be a worker 
i ll tell you right now 
i i i feel physically inadequate 
my whole life 
i ve never been able to lift
more than 10 times my own body weight 
and  when you get down to it 
handling dirt is  you know   
is not my idea of a rewarding career 
it s this whole gung ho 
superorganism thing
that    that  you know  i can t get 
i try  but i don t get it 
i mean  you know  i m    what is it 
i m supposed to do everything
for the colony 
and and what about my needs 
what about me 
i ve gotta believe there s someplace
out there that s better than this 
otherwise  i would just curl up
in a larval position and weep 
the whole system makes me feel   
insignificant 
excellent 
  you ve made a real breakthrough 
  i have 
yes  z  you are insignificant 
i i am 
ground floor 
uh  worker 
soldier 
ooh 
  uh oh 
  worker 
let s try it again 
firm grip  swing hard 
back straight  concentrate 
follow through 
okay  i gotta keep a positive attitude 
a good attitude  even though
i m utterly insignificant 
i m i m insignificant  um 
but with attitude 
ooh  sorry  z 
i didn t see ya 
great  azteca 
it s working already 
i m so meaningless  i m invisible 
now  you re getting it 
after all  it s not about you 
it s about us  the team 
it s about    this 
uh  a giant hole in the ground 
  okay  people  are we feeling good 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  great 
now  r 1734 through z 7829 
you guys are on wrecking ball 
  you got it 
  swell 
  you got it 
  all right  swing time 
let s get physical 
i love this job  let s go 
now  remember  azteca   be the ball  
that s the main thing 
now  remember that 
you know  gotta be one with the ball 
would you cut it out already 
jeez  i love my work  and you  well   
you think too much 
come on  z 
help us build a bigger  better colony 
and  for cryin  out loud 
try to be happy about it 
sure  you know  i mean  why why   
how could i possibly be unhappy
being a piece of construction equipment 
  okay  workers  remember   
  here it comes 
   be the ball 
let the energy flow through you 
grin and bear it  this is   
this is for the colony 
ow  this is   
this is just a lawsuit waiting to happen 
hang on  here we go  higher  faster 
did i happen to mention that
heights make me nauseous 
no 
this is a ball 
hey 
  oh  z 
  yes  yes  i understand 
i dropped the ball 
workers  they re weak 
they lack discipline 
they lack commitment 
general  i know there s been
a glitch or two 
but everybody is working
full tilt as it is  and   
you can t help it  it s your nature 
but in spite of your limitations 
you are going to finish this tunnel
on schedule 
come hell or high water 
from now on  anyone who falls behind
is going to have to explain themselves
to colonel cutter 
and let me assure you  the colonel is not
as understanding as i am 
dismissed 
four more days  cutter  four more days 
and we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence 
yes  sir 
a fresh start 
  imagine it 
  a strong colony  sir 
a colony we can be proud of 
yes  but we re not there yet 
cutter  we just got word that
a termite army has mobilized against us 
against us 
we ll have to send troops deep into
hostile territory to attack their colony 
attack a termite colony  sir 
that s suicide 
exactly  do you have the list i asked for 
yes  general 
these are the units loyal to the queen 
hm 
then they re the ones we ll be sending 
it s a shame 
there are some fine officers here 
don t we need the queen s approval
to declare war 
our very next stop  cutter 
general  we ve been at peace
with that colony for years 
  why would they attack us 
  they want our land 
they re desperate
for more foraging territory 
perhaps they think
we ve grown soft or weak 
why don t we dispatch an ambassador 
negotiate a new treaty 
certainly  we don t need to send soldiers 
believe me 
every ant in this colony
is so precious to me 
that s why we must strike now 
while we have the element of surprise 
if the termite shock troops
enter our colony  well   
yes  general 
i know what they can do to us 
very well 
you ve made a wise decision 
in fact  you ve insured
the future of this colony 
hello  general 
princess bala  what a nice surprise 
you look lovelier each time i see you 
thanks 
i hope you re not just here on business 
oh  of course   
of course not 
because  um  it might be nice
if we had a conversation
once before we get married 
you re absolutely right 
cutter  schedule some private time
for me and princess bala 
uh  in fact  sir  there is time right now
for a personal moment 
we re a few seconds ahead of schedule 
excellent  princess 
well  a few seconds isn t much  but
i guess if it s quality time   
so  how was your day 
  anything interesting happen 
  we declared war 
declared war 
boy  talk about a rough day 
sir  i hate to interrupt 
but time stands still for no ant 
princess 
mom  could you remind me 
why am i marrying this guy 
bala  do we have to argue
about this again 
we don t seem to have
anything in common  the guy s a stiff 
yes  darling  i know the general
may be a little gruff 
and somewhat overbearing at times 
but i know that he cares about you 
he s just not particularly good
at showing it 
but you should have seen how persistently
he asked for your hand in marriage 
but why me 
because you re the one
who has to continue my work 
it s your place  dear 
  what if i don t like my place 
  everyone has their place  bala 
you  the soldiers  the workers 
now  it s not all that bad
being princess  is it 
would you prefer to be
carting around dirt all day 
oh  mother  don t be so dramatic 
at least  they seem to have some fun
every now and then 
  two aphid beers 
  why d i have to be born a worker 
you soldiers get all the glory 
plus you get to go out in the world 
you meet interesting insects 
you get to kill them 
yeah 
but you get to spend all day with those   
beautiful worker girls 
weaver  they re career girls 
they re obsessed with digging 
i really don t think i m ever gonna meet
the right girl for me 
who said a girl for you 
i was talking about a girl for me 
don t you want your aphid beer 
call me crazy  but   
i have a thing about drinking
from the anus of another creature  okay 
suit yourself 
ah  me  i m cuttin  loose

stand around like an idiot
while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you 
i don t know how you put up with it 
weaver

insectopia 
oh  really  lunatic at 3 00

nobody tellin  you what to do 
no wars  no colony

there s very little time to think 
one must attack  attack  attack 
well  indeed

i can t believe you tried to
pass yourself off as a soldier 
why are you stalking me 
don t you realize i m out of your league 
you re the one
who was cruising the worker bar
looking for a little action 
and you just happened to find it   
the swarthy  earthy  sensual worker 
please  i was slumming it 
don t you get it 
i chose you because you were
the most pathetic little bug in the joint 
i was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies 
but now you can just forget that 
write it off  you know  i guess
what you prefer is old blood and guts 
this guy s idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at a public execution 
boy  you really chose the right husband 
for your information 
the general and i are deeply 
deeply in    engaged 
you come right back down here
this instant 
we are marching straight back
to the colony so that i   
the monolith 
   stupid little bug you are 
absolutely  wonderful 
that s an appealing offer 
but  considering the options  you go back 
okay   cause i m going on to insectopia 
oh  come on   insectopia  
you re crazier than i thought 
yeah  well  i happen to have
it on a very reliable source 
or    or should i say 
a drunk  raving source 
but the point is 
i m convinced the place definitely exists 
stop  i order you to stop  worker

and out here  you can t order me around 
all right  fine  no problem 
worker  worker 
where are you

your ability to handle this 
believe me  your highness 
we will spare no effort to bring her back 
princess bala is essential
to all our plans for the future 
so he kills himself a hundred termites 
gets a few medals 
then bada bing  bada bip 
bags himself the princess 
he looks him dead in the eye
and says   bite me  
he said that to general mandible 
buddy  hey  hey  buddy

runs off with the princess  right 
when they sent the guards after him 
he just looks at  em and boom 
  they burst into flames 
  z  you talkin  about z 
hey  i know the guy 
he s a friend of mine 
i think your information   
  you know z 
  yeah  he s a worker  he used to dig here 
a worker  that s impossible 
a worker can t do anything  except work 
yeah  it s not like we got a choice 
we do have a choice 
uh  i mean  look at z 
he decided he wanted something 
and he went for it 
he s not alone 
i used to be a soldier 
and i switched places with him 
wait a second  you re tellin  me
i don t have to be here 
we ve got a choice 
the authorities don t want you
to know about it 
but we don t have to work
on the tunnel anymore 
it s the workers who control
the means of production 
if z don t dig  i don t dig 
people  what is this 
an encounter group 
  let s get back to work 
  why 
   on the tunnel anymore 
this guy  z  he s leadin  the revolution 
i ll    get back to you 
think about it  z  two ants 
who ever heard of two ants 
two million ants  maybe  but two 
look  i m hungry  i m thirsty 
and this whole desert thing 
it just doesn t work for me 
  yada  yada  yada  yada 
  i think it s about time you take me back 
take yourself back  sheesh 
excuse me  you kidnapped me  remember 
that means you have
certain responsibilities 
you can t just abandon me
here in the wilderness 
yeah  well  it s better than
being back at the colony 
  you re not serious  are you 
  maybe you were living the high life 
but personally  this beats digging 
if you d ever done a day s labor 
you d know what i was talking about 
 labor   what do you know about labor 
how would you feel
if you were expected to give birth
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life 
gee 
water 
ahh  all you think about is yourself 
yeah  well  nobody else
ever thought about me 
so as far as i m concerned 
i don t need anybody else 
help  help me  bala 
help  b b b b bala 
hold on  i ll get you out  hold on 
help  ba   
  thanks 
  don t mention it 
now  maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us
and head back to the colo   
oh  z  what are you doing 
  we ve gotta cross the lake 
  am i missing something here 
didn t we just get out of the water 
bala  look  what have you got to lose 
i mean  think about it 
do you really want to be
mrs  raving lunatic 
there s a better place 
z  please 
just    gimme one chance 
if we don t find insectopia soon 
i promise i ll take you back
to the colony 
i hope you know what you re doing 
yeah  me  too 
we want z  we want z 
people  come on 
i know some ants
who aren t gonna make their quota 
buzz off  pawn of the oppressor 
we want z  we want z 
sorry  sir  i came as soon as i heard 
i was debriefing the trackers 
  and  what s the report 
  well  this z  sir 
he s one slippery character 
they lost bala s trail
at the edge of the lake 
the lake 
  all we are saying  
  is give z a chance  
what s that soldier doing there 
it appears he s holding hands  sir 
with a worker 
i don t like the way
things are going  cutter 
i m counting on you for results 
  now  can i depend on you or not 
  yes  sir 
all right  then  let s wrap this up 
we want z  we want z 
i ve heard a lot about this z 
i even had the pleasure
of meeting him once 
but where is he now 
can anyone point him out 
i mean  if this z cares so much about us 
then why isn t he here 
i ll tell you why 
because z doesn t give a damn about us 
that s why he kidnapped our princess 
that s why he ran away 
z is no hero  we are the heroes 
we are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony 
and when we ve completed
this magnificent structure 
we will reap the benefits 
more food and less work for everyone 
and as further reward
for your heroic efforts 
and every one of you will get the day off 
so you can be the guests of honor
at the megatunnel dedication ceremonies

sir 
i ll brief you on the coordinates 
you re gonna bring the princess back 
and as for z    kill him 
but you said he didn t matter 
it s for the good of the colony 
you made the right decision 
gentlemen  now you can see
how dangerous individualism can be 
it makes us    vulnerable 
let s go 
take him back to the megatunnel 
put him on the front line 
dismissed

well  what about the new guy 
he hasn t contributed yet

in his life made his own choice 
i never knew it was like that 
i mean  up in the palace

gentlemen  there comes a time
in the evolution of a perfect colony
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak

the weak elements of the colony

it s for the good of the colony 
what are you saying  we are the colony 
cutter 
what are you doing

z 
men  let s move it

huh 
yowch 
you know  weaver 
you still owe me that dinner 
baby love 
  we made it  z 
  you da ant 
  eh 
  you did it 
we did it 
  fellas  fellas  please 
  oh  oh 
this is very embarrassing for me  i   
on the other hand 
i probably could get used to this 
there you have it 
your average  boy meets girl 
boy likes girl  boy changes
underlying social order  story 
so  what else can i tell you 
we rebuilt the colony 
it s even better than before 
you know   cause now it has
a very large indoor swimming pool 
bala and i  incidentally 
are thinking of starting a family 
you know  just a few kids 
maybe a million or two to begin with 
and i m workin  with a new therapist 
you know  terrific  absolutely terrific 
he s been putting me in touch
with my inner maggot 
which is helping me a great deal 
and  you know  i finally feel like
i ve found my place 
and you know what 
it s right back where i started 
but the difference is 
this time i chose it 
  just what makes that little old ant  
  think he ll move
that rubber tree plant  
  anyone knows an ant can t
move a rubber tree plant  
  but he s got high hopes  
  he s got high hopes  
  he s got high apple pie  
  in the sky hopes  
  so anytime you re gettin  low  
   stead of lettin  go
just remember that ant  
  oops  there goes another
rubber tree plant  
  oops  there goes another
rubber tree plant  
  oops  there goes another
rubber tree plant  
  once there was a silly old ram  
  thought he d punch a hole in a dam  
  no one could make that ram scram  
  he kept buttin  that dam
 cause he had high hopes  
  he had high hopes  
  he had high apple pie  
  in the sky hopes  
  so anytime you re feelin  bad
 stead of feelin  sad  
  just remember that ram  
  oops  there goes
a billion kilowatt dam  
  oops  there goes
a billion kilowatt dam  
  oops  there goes
a billion kilowatt dam  
  so keep your high hopes  
  keep your high hopes  
  keep those high apple pie  
  in the sky hopes  
  a problem s just a toy balloon  
  they ll be bursting soon
they re just bound to go pop  
  oops  there goes another problem
ker plop
