  oh  it was something  randal 
this man
we hunted last night 
why don t you
tell us his real name

  binder  binder  douglas binder 
that s not the one
we selected  is it 
i couldn t get the guy

so i sent you binder 
  he has more medals 
  he had a family 
  now they re asking questions 
  please  please  i said i was sorry   
  i said i was sorry 
  careless is what you are  randal 
careless and stupid 
and now you re sorry  too 
he said he

  i didn t know he had any relatives  honest 
  you made a mistake 
  is that what you re saying 
  yeah  yeah 
and i see you re anxious
to make up for it  aren t you 
yeah  yes  yes  sir 
we ve got another client   
and he s about
to select a new playmate 
next time    send us
the one we ask for 
i will  mr  fouchon 
i swear  i   
i think
we understand each other 
  yes  no 
  yes  yeah 
randal   
i come back here   
i cut me a steak 
  you did your best 
  no  i came too late 
i mean  jesus  he was living
out of a shopping cart 
goddamn it 
why didn t he just tell me 
why didn t he ask
for my help 
i ve been there myself on the street 
it s hard 
it s hard to   
put your hand out 
i just kept thinking
if i could   
just tell him
that i loved him 
and because
he loved you so much   
he didn t want
to pull you into it 
our friend 
mr  boudreaux 
silver star 
  marine force recon 
  joined the merchant service after he got out 
his captain
was smuggling opium 
when boudreaux found out 
he threw the man overboard 
he s been looking
for work ever since 
he s obviously not someone
we should underestimate 
he was raised
in the bayous by his uncle 
i think mr  boudreaux would make
a very interesting quarry 
  maybe i should pay him a visit 
  no  no  no  no  no 
send a couple of lads down there
to have a chat with him  once you re back 
yeah 
yeah   
bingo 
some friendly advice  boudreaux 
get the fuck outta dodge 
do it today 
and tell that bitch girlfriend o  yours   
to point her titties north
and step on the gas 
it s always
nice to see you 
you seem to have a real talent 
mr  boudreaux  for attracting violence 
does that make me
a bad person 
why did you arrest me for 
getting beat up without a license 
thank you for calling me 
oh  my god 
you look awful 
  darling  you hurt my feelings 
  what we have here is a charge sheet 
willfully crossing a police barrier 
that s considered criminal trespass 
yes  that officer was nice enough
to mention that to me 
  what were you doing at the house 
  the dog tag you find in that fire 
they always
come in twos 
so  i went back to that place
to look for the other one 
your daddy   
he didn t die in the fire 
  he was murdered 
  there s no evidence of that 
there is now 
that hole in that tag was made
by something sharp and hard 
and i ll bet my rent money it was made
when binder was still wearing it 
now  why would somebody go through
all this trouble to kill a homeless man 
  do you believe us now 
  honey  the wheels turn slow around here 
  real slow 
  but they do turn 
i ll order a new autopsy 
this ll help 
  you should see a doctor 
  i hate them doctors 
yeah    shit 
what 
not now 
  so  you in  nam 
  yeah  a long time ago 
it seems to me a man with your experience
should be pullin  down a lot more money 
you re gonna pay me
100 bucks to fill out a form 
i ll pay you a lot more than that
if you got the experience 
what kind of experience 
  well  maybe you ain t interested 
  no 
i ll fill out the application 
you got any family 
anybody to worry about you 
  friends  anything like that 
  i got nobody 
you ll deposit 500 000 dollars in our account
in a bank in the cayman islands 
do not refer to our agreement by telex
or in conversations on the phone 
you ll be provided with a guide  trackers
and the weapon of your choice 
naturally  we will
dispose of the body   
and provide you with
an out of town  airtight alibi 
don t worry  mr  zenan 
all you have to do is point and shoot 
mr  zenan has made
his selection 
a black man named roper 
used to be in special forces 
excellent 
i don t see any problem
with your choice 
it has always been the privilege of the few
to hunt the many 
soldiers  policemen 
fighter pilots 
men who kill for the government
do so with impunity 
now  all we do is offer the same opportunity
for private citizens such as yourself 
  these opponents  they re volunteers 
  more or less 
the same government that has made murder
their sole preserve  they train our targets 
we pride ourselves on
only hunting combat veterans   
men who have
the necessary skills   
  to make our hunts more interesting 
  what about the police 
i m sure that they would be interested
if they were to find out 
dr  morton here assists us
with the formality of police autopsies 
it s no accident
that we re in new orleans 
last year we conducted hunts
in rio de janeiro at carnival   
yugoslavia during
the late unpleasantness   oh  yeah 
you see  there s always some unhappy
little corner of the planet   
where we can ply
our trade 
all right  mr  fouchon 
  you have a client 
  well  thank you for visiting  mr  zenan 
dr  morton will show you
to the car 
my bank will arrange
the transfer of funds within the hour 
  excellent 
  when do we go out 
we ll contact you when the necessary
arrangements have been made 
chance 
what you doing here 
secret mission 
rub me  baby 
oh  yeah  baby   
  hello poe 
  what the fuck 
  you miss me 
  aw  christ  not again 
looks like you re short an ear 
so you better listen very carefully 
now  are you
paying attention 
  who sent those apes after me 
  i don t know what you re talking about 
two million people
in this city 
  who s gonna miss a fat slob like you  poe 
  van cleaf  his name was van cleaf 
good boy 
where is he 
i don t know where he lives 
he ain t even american 
look  he ll kill me if i don t do what he says 
please  you gotta believe that 
tell your boyfriend
van cleaf   
i m gonna find out who
killed douglas binder 
if you understand me 
just grunt 
again 
did you get my memo 
binder  douglas c 
i want you to take another look
at the post mortem 
that memo contains evidence
that might make binder s death a homicide 
now  you can act on it 
doctor  or you can file it   
but if i have to get a court order
for a formal inquest   
i will 
you should do something
about that cough 
don t you ever knock 
we have a problem 
a big problem 
they want me to redo
the autopsy on binder 
  who is it that s asking 
  a detective named mitchell 
binder s family s
breathing down her neck 
  can we buy her 
  no 
i guess we ve overstayed
our welcome 
tonight is our last hunt
in new orleans 
open it 
what a funny little man  eh 
a change of scenery s what we need 
something less tropical 
rolling hills  castles   
eastern europe 
we can work there for years 
  where s poe 
  mr  poe couldn t make it 
he s got an ear infection 
  look  he said he d have some work for me 
  that may still be a possibility 
we got a little game
we d like you to play with us 
this money belt   
has 10 000 dollars in it 
it s all yours if you want it 
every penny 
  what do i have to do 
  the rules of the game are very simple 
all you have to do is get to the river 
ten miles through the city 
you and the money belt make it to the river 
you re 10 000 dollars richer 
bullshit 
maybe you like being the object of pity 
begging for quarters  sleeping in the rain 
listening to a half an hour of fire
and brimstone for a bowl of soup 
  man  fuck you 
  you could change everything tonight 
think of what
10 000 dollars could buy you 
you could get new clothes 
clean yourself up   
look men in the eyes when
you pass  em on the street 
this money could
make you a man again   
instead of the shadow
of your former self 
  i get to the river  i get the cash 
  every nickel 
  if i don t make it 
  oh  you re a sports fan  roper
