onto the kragle   
   and disarm it forever 
great 
i think i got it   
   but just in case   
   tell me the whole thing again 
i wasn t listening 
okay  all the people
of the universe were once free to travel   
   and mingle and build
whatever they wanted 
but president business
was confused by all the chaos 
so he erected walls between the worlds   
   and became obsessed
with order and perfection 
and he stole the mysterious   
     secret super weapon called   
  the kragle 
   and he hired bad cop   
   to hunt down all the masterbuilders 
who were always changing everything 
and those of us who remained   
   well  we went into hiding 
built the tunnels to survive 
and we search for the piece of resistance 
the only thing that can stop the kragle 
kragle  i know that 
it might have been that cop 
he said something about the kragle 
president business
was going to use the kragle   
   to end the world in three days 
i can t make any sense of it 
taco tuesday

there s no time to lose 
we must find vitruvius and get to
the office tower before it s too late

although   
   you did let the piece of resistance go 
the one thing that can ruin my plans 
the one thing that i asked you to take care of

   is standing closest to me   
   and throw them through this window   
   and out into the infinite abyss
of nothingness 
i wanna do it so bad

let me show you how it s done 
what a lady 
okay  let me just find the wizard   
   and get this over with 
  ooh 
  there he is 
  vitruvius 
  who 
i ve never heard of that man 
whom i am not 
  who are you 
  it s me 
i am a blind man and cannot see 
  it s wyldstyle 
  oof 
are you a dj 
  what  why does everybody    
  oh  wait  wait 
are you the student i used to have   
   who was so insecure
she kept changing her name 
no  no  no 
  first darkstorm  then geminizzle 
  no  never 
then neversmile  then freakface 
then snazzypants 
okay  all right  yes 
meet me upstairs in 10 seconds 
oh  man 
you have a very weirdly   
     decorated place 
  thank you 
vitruvius  we have found
the piece of resistance 
  is it true 
  yes  but   
wyldstyle  the prophecy states that   
   you are the special 
the embodiment of good  foiler of evil 
the most talented  most brilliant   
   most important person in the universe 
that would be great   
   but emmet is the one
who found the piece 
oh  okay  emmet 
the prophecy states that   
   you are the special 
  the most talented   
  i m not sure he s the special 
because he s not even
a masterbuilder  watch 
emmet  just given what s around you   
     build something simple 
  okay 
  like an awesome race car 
  great 
  go 
  do you have the instructions 
no  you must create the instructions
in your mind  my liege 
ah  okay  race car 
um   
well  there s a lot of really cool stuff here 
don t see a wheel   
   or   
   three more wheels 
see  he can t do it 
he will never be a masterbuilder 
of course not 
not if you keep telling him he can t 
he needs to see that he can 
what are you doing 
  we are entering your mind   
  what 
   to prove that you have
the unlocked potential   
   to be a masterbuilder 
ujjayi breath 
whoa  are we inside my brain right now 
  it s big  i must be smart 
mm hm 
i m not hearing a lot of activity here 
i don t think he s ever had an original thought 
in his life 
ha  ha  that s not true 
for instance  one time i wanted to have   
   a bunch of my friends over to watch tv   
not unlike this tv
that just showed up magically 
and not everybody
can fit on my one couch   
   and i thought to myself 
 what if there was such a thing
as a bunk bed   
   but as a couch  
introducing the double decker couch 
so everyone could watch tv together
and be buddies 
that is literally the dumbest thing
i ve ever heard 
please  wyldstyle  let me handle this 
that idea is just the worst 
there must be something around here   
   that proves his potential 
if the man upstairs
chose him to be the special   
   there must be a reason 
  who s the man upstairs 
  see 
he doesn t even know about
the man upstairs 
does he have  like  super gross hands   
   that look like they re made
out of big pink sausages 
like eagle talons mixed with squid 
wait  you ve seen the    
whoa 
that s what i was just thinking about 
how did you    
i had this weird dream
when i touched the piece 
well  i mean  i wasn t asleep 
so it wasn t really a dream 
emmet  you had a vision 
i did 
masterbuilders spend years   
   training themselves
to clear their minds enough   
   to have even a fleeting glimpse
of the man upstairs   
   and yet  your mind is already

you have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import 
we have learned   
   that lord business plans to unleash   
   a fully weaponized kragle   
   on taco tuesday   
   to end the world as we know it 
please  calm yourselves 
green ninja   
   milhouse   
   nice vampire

the special will now give
an eloquent speech 
go ahead  man  you got this 
okay 
hello  i m emmet 
oh  and this is the piece of resistance 
thank you 
well  uh  i know that i  for one   
   am very excited to work with you guys   
   to get into the octan tower 
find the kragle   
   and put this thing on the thing 
and i know it s going to be really hard  but   
 really hard  
wiping ye burn with a hook
for a hand is really hard 
this be impossible 
the last time we tried to storm
lord business  office   
   we used every plan we could conceive 
the result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of 
who are you 
the name be metal beard 
and i ll tell you me tale of woe 
oh  great  here we go again 
i arrived   
   at the foot of the tower   
   with me hearty masterbuilder crew   
   only to find the kragle was all
the way up on the infinityeth floor   
guarded by a robot army   
   and security measures   
   of every kind   
   imaginable 
lasers   
   sharks   
   laser sharks   
   overbearing assistants   
   and strange  dangerous relics   
   that entrap   
   snap   
   and zap 
and there be a mysterious room
called the think tank 
i barely made it out of that   
   room   
   with just me head 
and organs 
okay 
i had to replace every part
of my once strapping   
   virile pirate body   
   with this useless hunk of garbage
ye see before ye 
so if ye think it d be a good idea to return   
   to that forsaken place   
   special   
   what idea have ye that be better   
   than the ideas of 100   
   of our fallen masterbuilder brothers 
well  uh   
well  technically i m not exactly
a masterbuilder yet 
what 
please  everyone  please 
rubbish 
yes  it s true 
i may not be a masterbuilder 
i may not have a lot of experience   
   fighting or leading
or coming up with plans 
or having ideas in general 
in fact  i m not all that smart 
and i m not what you d call
a  creative type  
plus   
   generally unskilled 
also   
   scared and cowardly 
i know what you re thinking 
 he is the least qualified person   
   in the world to lead us  
and you are right 
this is supposed to make us feel better 
no  there was about to be a  but  
  you re a butt 
  yes 
you all be on your own 
i be leaving this lost cause 
why are you leaving 
a house divided against itself
would be better   
   than this 
abraham lincoln

come on  guys 
we can still do this  right 
you re not even a bit special 
well  you were right about him
being a ding dong 
you re a huge disappointment

ruh roh  it s the bad guys 
whoa  how did he

shaq  do you know what time   
     it is

that s okay  i didn t really wanna build   
   a spaceship anyway  that s cool 
where can we go
where we can t be found 
maybe we could go underwater 
what if we went underwater 
great idea  babe 
thank you  batman 
your ideas are the best 
but i just said that 
  we could build a submarine 
  a bat submarine  patent pending 
with rainbows 
and dream catchers  in case we take a nap 
like an underwater spaceship 
but you can t build all of them at once 
ready  break 
okay 
these are the colors i need  blue razzleberry and sour apple 
if anybody has black parts 
i need them  okay 
i only work in black 
and sometimes  very  very dark gray 
  use the yellow bricks 
  hey  guys  can i help 
  no  it has to be this way 
  no  i need that 
where is he 
anyone know what this is 
and do you need it 
i think we could use wings
and rocket boosters 
ew  get your retro space stuff
out of my area 
you guys  hey  just tell me exactly
what to do  and how to do it 
emmet  don t worry about
what the others are doing 
you must embrace
what is special about you 
there he is 
all units  attack the sub 
emmet  get in here 
stop him  stop him  don t let him   
   get to the water 
dive  dive  dive  everybody in 
we re going under 
oh  no 
my home 
it s gone 
i feel something inside 
it s like the opposite of happiness 
i must stay positive 
ah  bubble gums 
butterflies 
cotton candy 
gosh  i m so sorry  unikitty 
do you want to sit down
and talk about it 
what the heck is that 
it s a double decker couch 
which seemed like a good idea
at the time   
   but i now realize it s not super helpful 
but  you know  it has cup holders 
seats flip up with coolers underneath 
you are so disappointing
on so many levels 
  why are my pants cold and wet 
  ew 
uh   
hull breach 
the walls are crying 
we re coming apart at the seams 
this is not how batman dies 
emmet 
  hold on  hold on 
  wyldstyle 
deep breath  deep breath  everybod    
micro managers 
what s going on down there 
scanning submarine wreckage 
no survivors detected 
scuba cops 
dredge the entire ocean if you have to 
we have got to find that piece 
let s get these prisoners
back to lord business   
   and give him the good news 
the special is no more 
hello  everybody 
superman  wonder woman 
i had no idea you d be here 
mr  shaquille o neal 
greetings  all 
welcome to my think tank 
help us 
all the masterbuilders
you ve captured over the years   
   you ve brought them here 
you re a very perceptive person  superman 
they come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe 
robots 
no  no  grr 
can t get much worse than this 
  uh  hello  neighbor 
  oh  no 
it s green lantern 
oh  my gosh  we re roommates 
how crazy is that 
does anyone have some kryptonite
that they could give me 
whoa  whoa  whoa  where is the special 
the special and the piece of resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean 
wait  are you telling me
you don t have him 
sir  my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak 
bad cop  he could still be alive 
the piece could still be out there 
the only remnant of the special
was a double decker couch 
wait  hold on 
a double decker couch 
yes  sir 
really  so it s like a bunk bed couch 
is that what it s like 
that s weird 
if you re sitting in the top middle   
   how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone 
if you re sitting on the bottom
and you re watching tv   
   are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs 
who s gonna want to sit on the bottom 
it is literally   
   the most useless idea
i have ever heard 
  well  we re still alive 
  yeah 
heh  the double decker couch 
it wasn t totally pointless after all 
it s the one thing that stayed together 
i always believed in you  emmet 
i don t mean to spoil the party 
but does anyone else notice   
   we re stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch 
i mean  it s not like a big gigantic ship   
   is gonna come out of nowhere
and save us   
my gosh 
avast  mateys 
metal beard  i thought you said
we were a lost cause 
ye are 
did ye not hear me whole story   
   circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise 
well  it s kind of hard not to hear
when you re yelling everything 
so why did you come back 
this be doubled land couch 
i watched lord business  forces
completely overlook it 
which means we need more ideas like it 
oh  thank you 
ideas so dumb and bad   
   that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful 
oh  thank you 
so  special  what do we do 
uh   
well   
   what s the last thing lord business
expects masterbuilders will do 
build a spaceship 
kill a chicken 
marry a marshmallow 
why  this 
how you gonna keep  em down on the farm 
no  it s follow the instructions 
  don t like that 
  sounds weird 
now  listen  wait  listen 
guys  you re all so talented
and imaginative 
but you can t work together as a team 
i m just a construction worker 
but when i had a plan and we were
all working together   
   i mean  we could build a skyscraper 
now  you re masterbuilders 
just imagine what could happen
if you did that 
you could save the universe 
well said  emmet  well said 
really 
she be a fine speech there  laddie 
okay 
somebody get me some markers   
   some construction paper   
   and some glitter glue 
i call this 
 emmet s plan to get
inside the tower   
   put the piece of resistance
on the kragle   
   and save the world  
i ve built a hundred just like them
back in the city 
if we can just get in  i know where
the air ducts and wiring are located 
i can get us anywhere 
how will we get inside 
in a spaceship 
  spaceship  ha  ha 
  great idea  a bat spaceship 
no  they re expecting us to show up   
   in a bat spaceship  or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow sparkle spaceship 
one of those sounds awesome to me 
my idea is to build a spaceship   
   that s exactly like all the other
octan delivery spaceships 
so not the special spaceship that
i m building for all of you right now 
sorry  benny  maybe next time 
ooh  you re really letting the oxygen
out of my tank here 
yeah  but according
to your precious instructions   
   this ship needs a hyperdrive 
we don t have that part 
maybe we could find one 
what do you think  a spaceship
is just gonna appear out of the blue 
are you kidding me 
the same thing 
  chewie 
  mm 
we re supposed to be halfway
to naboo for a sweet party 
this hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning   
   taking us to loser systems like this 
captain solo  we must go 
you know how perturbed i get
if we are not punctual 
the droid s right  let s roll 
now hold on  han 
this might be the right galaxy after all 
because i see a heavenly body 
ooh  whoa  i have a boyfriend 
and it is super serious  right  babe 
  of course it s serious 
  yeah 
  got room for just one dude 
  whoa  babe 
if he s a cool dude like you 
you re trying to bail on us 
i m not trying to bail 
you asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship 
that thing is filled with bon vivants 
you speak french now 
babe  look  if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us   
   i need to feel free to party   
   with a bunch of strangers
whenever i feel like it 
what 
babe 
i will text you 
where d you get that
sweet space cape  brother 
it s party time 
babe 
wyldstyle  you re such an amazing person 
and  you know 
if batman can t see that  then he s just   
well  he s just as blind as a guy   
   whose eyes stopped working 
and i m gonna tell you something 
batman is the worst person i ve ever met 
  need a hyperdrive 
  no way 
  babe 
  i knew it  i knew that 
you really had me there 
those guys were so lame 
all they did was play space checkers 
plus  it turns out the hairy one s a dude 
and the metal one too  all dudes 
but won t they notice
their hyperdrive is missing 
come on  chewie  hit the hyperdrive 
nah  they ll be fine 
step one 
all right  we need a red four piece
unit over at the   
unikitty   
you re supposed to follow
the instructions  remember 
sorry 
ugh  this gives me the jeebies 
what do i even     i can t    
nice 
step two 
we pilot the ship to the service entrance   
   so we can get past the dangerous   
   but also kind of cool   
   laser gate 
space id 
i have a drive on 
who are you here to see 
i m here to see your butt 
is that last name  butt  
first name  your   or is it    
oh  my gosh 
pow  wham  ka zap 
first try 
step three  we break into lord business  office   
   and we ll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises 
step four 
benny and metal beard   
will sneak their way
into the master control room 
motion sensors triggered in sector 12 
10 4 
uh oh 
  are you thinking what i m thinking 
  oh 
do it 
metal beard  that was awesome 
first law of the sea   
   never place your rear end
on a pirate s face 
once inside 
they ll use their technical know how   
   to disable the kragle shield 
i am the computer 
cool  talking computer 
please disable the shield systems 
of course 
there are no movies
in your area with that title 
step five 
vitruvius will provide lookout
and make sure we re not being followed 
okay 
step six  batman and unikitty go into the boardroom   
   to make one last change
to lord business  plan 
i move that we freeze the universe 
can i get a second on that 
bruce i second 
bruce wayne  ceo of wayne enterprises

with your arms and your legs   
   and just feel the beat 
listen up  we need new instructions
for a speaker system for the takos 
we ll never help 
whatever you say  boss 
then once the instructions are printed   
wyldstyle and i
will enter the kragle room   
   place the thing on the other thing   
   and save the universe 
whoa  whoa  whoa  hey  i didn t draw that

i know  i m doing my best

the prophecy

i made it up  it s not true 
but that means i m just   
i m not the special 
you must listen 
what i m about to tell you   
   will change the course of history 
no 
no 
hey 
not so special anymore  huh 
well  guess what 
no one ever told me i was special 
i never got a trophy just for showing up 
i m not some special little snowflake   
   no 
but as unspecial as i am   
   you are a thousand billion times   
   more unspecial than me 
robots  bring me the sword of exact zero 
yes  lord business 
it must be weird 
one minute  you re the most
special person in the universe 
and the next minute  you re nobody 
oh  i have a nice spot
for this in my relic room

release the kragle 
  computer 
  yes  sir 
set the electric shocker to 100 mississippi 
no problem 
  then terminate everyone 
  already on it 
emmet  that should give you enough time   
   to witness the first location to be kragled 
  your hometown 
  no

attention  everyone 
this is president business 
hello 
  hi  welcome to taco tuesday 
  whoa 
don t worry about this big black   
   monolith thing that s blocking out the sun 
what you need to worry about   
   is this question that i m about to ask you 
who wants a taco 
yeah  i know 
tacos  tacos  we re going crazy  yeah 
all right  everyone 
act normal 
perfect 
now  everybody say  freeze  
so i guess running around
and screaming is normal 
micro managers 
commence micro management 
commencing micro management 
what s going on  i can t move 
please  please  won t somebody help us 
emmet  you ll think of something 
right  like you always do 
didn t you hear him 
the prophecy s made up 
i m not the special 
and to think for a moment
i thought i might be 
  emmet 
  who said that 
i did 
i am ghost vitruvius 
woo 
emmet  you didn t let me finish earlier 
because i died 
the reason i made up the prophecy   
   was because i knew that
whoever found the piece   
   could become the special 
because the only thing
anyone needs to be special   
   is to believe that you can be 
i know that sounds like a cat poster 
but it s true 
look at what you did
when you believed you were special 
you just need to believe it some more 
but how can i just decide
to believe that i m special   
   when i m not 
because the world depends on it 
woo

well  what do we do now 
there s gotta be a bright side   
   here somewhere 
does anyone have any ideas 
emmet had ideas 
arr  if only there were more people
in the world like he 
maybe there are 
meet me downstairs in 10 seconds 
honey  where are my   
   pant    
  hi 
  hey  guess what 
found your pants  series is over  benny   
   send this out to everyone in the universe 
1980 something technology 
now you re talking 
uh    ahem  hey  everybody 
you don t know me 
but i m on tv  so you can trust me 
i know things seem kind of bad right now 
but there is a way out of this 
this is emmet 
and he was just like all of you 
a face in the crowd   
   following the same instructions as you 
he was so good at fitting in 
no one ever saw him 
and i owe you an apology   
   because i used to look down
on people like that 
 i used to think they were followers   
   with no ideas or vision  
because it turns out emmet had great ideas 
and even though they seemed weird   
   and kind of pointless   
   they actually came closer   
   than anyone else to saving the universe 
and now we have to finish what he started   
   by making whatever weird thing
pops into our heads 
all of you have the ability
inside of you to be a groundbreaker 
and i mean literally 
break the ground 
peel up the pieces   
   tear apart your walls 
build things only you could build 
defend yourselves 
we need to fight back
against president business    
plans to freeze us 
today will not be known as taco tuesday 
it will be known as freedom friday 
but still on a tuesday 
end of the line 
bad cop 
i hope there s still a good cop
in me somewhere 
i ll hold these guys off 
you go stop them  yay 
great idea  but how will we get there 
t minus one

president business

if   
if the construction guy   
   said something
to president business   
   what would he say 
you   
   don t have to be   
   the bad guy 
you   
   are the most talented   
   most interesting   
   and most extraordinary person
in the universe 
and you are capable of amazing things   
   because you are the special 
and so am i

blacked out windows
other places that are dark
black suit
black coffee
