name in the paper  butch 
so we just forget
about logan taking over 
o k   flat nose 
you always said
that any one of us could challenge you 
 cause i figured no one would do it 
figured wrong  butch 
you guys can t want logan 
at least he s with us 
you been spending a lot of time gone 
well  that s because
everything s different now 
guns or knives  butch 
you got to plan more  prepare more 
guns or knives 
neither

i don t want to shoot with you  harvey 
anything you say  butch 
maybe there s a way to
make a profit in this 
bet on logan

sundance

rules  let s get started 
someone count 1  2  3  go 
1  2  3  go 
i was really rooting for you  butch 
well  thank you  flat nose 
that s what sustained
me in my time of trouble 
hey  what s this about the flyer 
harvey said we d hit it
both this run and the return 
nobody s done that to the flyer before 
no matter how much we got at first 
they d figure the return was safe
and load it up with money 
harvey thought of that 
yes  sir  he did 
i ll tell you something  fellas 
that s exactly what we re going to do 
stop it 
where 
up ahead there 
bet that s old butch himself 
hold it there 
just thought i d watch 
bring the kids  why don t you 
stick your heads in 
you re just going to
get yourself blown up
you don t open that door 
i can t do that  i work
for mr  e h  harriman
of the union pacific railroad  he   
shut up about that e h  harriman stuff
and open up 
what s going on 
we got a patriot in there 
that s young woodcock 
he s awful dedicated 
woodcock 
yes  sir 
you know who we are 
you re the hole in the wall
gang  mr  cassidy 
i understand that 
but mr  e h  harriman
himself give me this job 
i got to do my best 
your best don t include
getting yourself killed 
dynamite s ready 
mr  e h  harriman himself
had the confidence   
open the door  or that s it 
you think e h  harriman
would get himself killed for you 
woodcock 
i work for mr  e h  harriman
of the union pacific railroad 
and he entrusted me   
hey  woodcock 
woodcock  you all right 
hey 
hmm 
whatever harriman s
paying you ain t enough 
there ain t what i d call
a fortune in there  butch 
well  just so we come out ahead 
that s the main thing 
the
hole in the wall gang
the
hole in the wall gang
just robbed the flyer
right outside of our town 
so that makes it our responsibility
to get out there and get after them 
you ll have to bring your own horses 
how many of you can bring your own guns 
how many of you will want
me to supply you with guns 
well    come on now 
i think it s up to us to
do something  don t you 
what s the point 
they re probably halfway
to hole in the wall
already 
that s exactly why we have got to hurry 
if we mount up right now
and get out there after them 
maybe we can head them off 
if we did that  they d kill us 
we don t want to let
them get away with this

once they divide up 
we take them  no trouble  right 
maybe 
boy  for a gunman 
you re one hell of a pessimist 
they ought to get
to where we split up any time 
they re just about there 
how many of them do you
think will come our way 
oh  i wish we had rifles 
i mean  they got rifles 
but we got surprise on our side  right 
so far  they re doing what we want 
you think we ought to
take them from up here

closer to the trail 
uh   
damn it 
they re not going for it 
who are those guys 
i don t know 
i don t know 
we got to do something and shake them 
whatever you come up with
is fine with me 
but whatever it is  it better be now 
what are you doing here 
easy  ray  easy 
what the hell do you mean  take it easy 
you promised you d never
come into my territory 
and we haven t 
just because we were friendly
doesn t give you the right to break in 
what if we was seen together 
i m too old to find another job 
at least have the
decency to draw your guns

to tell you something 
all right  what do you want 
a couple of things 
we want to enlist  ray 
in the army  right away 
go fight the spanish 
oh  you re crazy  you are crazy

they d throw you in jail
for a thousand years each 
come on  sundance 
start trussing my feet 
here  you seen these before  come on 
i m not taking the chance
that someone saw you coming in 
we re serious about this 
you are known outlaws 
we d quit 
that s the point  is that on tight 
that s all right 
there s some hankies in the drawer
you can use to gag me 
i swear  this d work  ray 
you trust us  the government trusts you 
anything you tell them
they gotta believe  right 
you ve never done a
dishonest thing ever 
and you re pushing 60  we d quit 
they d drop the charges against us 
we d fight till the war is over 
they don t even have
to make us officers 
that s some proposition 
they forget all about the years
of thieving and robbing 
they take you into the army 
which is what you want
in the first place 
there s something out there
that scares you  huh 
but it s too late 
you should ve let yourself get killed
while you had the chance 
you may be the biggest
thing to hit this area 
but you re still two bit outlaws 
i never met a soul more
affable than you  butch 
or faster than the kid 
but you re still two bit outlaws
on the dodge 
it s over  don t you get that 
your times is over 
and you re gonna die bloody 
and all you can do is choose where 
i m sorry 
i m getting mean in my old age 
come on  shut me up  sundance 
ah  you re wasting your time 
they can t track us over rock 
tell them that 
they re beginning to get on my nerves 
who are those guys 
you remember the time
you  me  and etta went to denver
for a vacation 
i m glad you brought that up  kid 
that s an important topic 
considering our situation 
the night we went gambling  remember 
we had dinner at the hotel 
etta had roast beef  and i had chicken 
if i can remember what you had 
i ll die happy 
look out there 
what 
i got to talking to
some gambler that night 
he told us about an indian   
full blooded indian 
except he used an english name 
sir    somebody 
lord baltimore 
that s right  and he could track anybody
over anything day or night 
so 
the guy on the ground  i think it s him 
no  baltimore works out of oklahoma 
he s strictly an oklahoma man 
i don t know where we are 
but it isn t oklahoma 
ah  it couldn t be him 
it couldn t be him 
i guess 
whoever it is 
it sure the hell is somebody 
damn it 
don t they get tired 
don t they get hungry 
they ve gotta be 
why don t they slow up 
they could even go faster 
at least that d be a change 
they don t even break formation 
do something 
kid 
what 
who s the best lawman 
best  how 
you mean toughest or easiest to bribe 
toughest 
joe lefors 
gotta be 
lefors never leaves wyoming  never 
you know that 
he always wears a white skimmer 
that s how you tell it s joe lefors 
 cause he wears a white straw hat 
look at that guy out front 
jesus  who are those guys 
hyah 
come on now 
here you go  kid 
go on  get out of here  go on 
what if they don t follow the horse 
you re the brains  butch 
you ll think of something 
damn it 
the way i figure it 
we can either fight or give 
if we give  we go to jail 
i ve been there already 
if we fight 
they can stay where they are
and starve us out   
or go for position  shoot us 
might even get a rock slide started 
what else can they do 
they could surrender to us 
but i wouldn t count on that 
they re going for position  all right 
better get ready 
kid  the next time i say
let s go someplace like bolivia 
let s go someplace like bolivia 
next time 
ready 
no  we ll jump 
like hell we will 
no  it ll be o k 
if the water s deep enough
and we don t get squished to death 
they ll never follow us 
how do you know 
would you jump that
if you didn t have to 
i have to  and i m not gonna 
we got to  otherwise we re dead 
come on 
just one clear shot   
that s all i want 
i want to fight them 
they ll kill us 
maybe 
you want to die 
do you 
all right  i ll jump first 
no 
then you jump first 
no  i said 
what s the matter 
i can t swim 
why  you crazy 
the fall will probably kill you 
oh oh   
ohhh   
shiiiit 
hang on to me 
you re drowning me 
i can t help it  i can t swim 
you re choking me 
i can t swim 
i m telling you  if i drown 
i swear to god i ll kill you 
never said i was a great swimmer 
oh  you re choking me 
oh  i m choking 
let go of me 
i m choking 
let go of my throat 
the papers said they had you 
was it lefors  did they say 
joe lefors 
i think so 
and their tracker 
tracker 
was it lord baltimore 
i think so 
the paper s inside 
you got enough to feed us 
don t you know i do 
they said you were dead 
don t make a big thing out of it 
no  make a big thing out of it 
hey 
it was baltimore and lefors 
you know who else 
who 
jeff carr  george hiatt   
hiatt 
t t  kelliher 
we lucked out getting away 
you know that 
why would these guys join up
and take after us  though 
forget it  bunch like that
won t stay together long 
they will   
if mr  harriman has his way 
who 
mr  e h  harriman
of the union pacific railroad 
he resents the way you ve
been picking on him 
so he s outfitted a special train
and hired special employees 
you ve been avoiding them for two days 
it s really sort of flattering
if you want to think about it that way 
a setup like that costs more
than we ever took 
apparently he can afford it 
that crazy harriman 
that s bad business 
how long do you think
i d stay in operation
if every job cost me money 
if he d just pay me what he s spending
to make me stop robbing him 
i d stop robbing him 
you probably inherited
every penny you got 
inherited guys 
what the hell do they know 
you say they were hired permanent 
no  just till they kill you 
that means they re
still after us  butch 
and it s going to be the same thing
all over again 
they ll show up here   
sooner or later 
hey  etta 
i ll get you some more 
butch and me have been
talking it all over 
wherever the hell bolivia is 
that s where we re off to 
we ll go down there and play it safe 
maybe keep our hand in a little bit 
butch speaks some spanish 
i can wrestle with a menu o k 
and you speak it good 
and it d be good cover
going with a woman 
no one expects it 
then we could travel safer 
what i m saying is 
if you want to go 
i won t stop you 
but the minute you start to whine
or make a nuisance 
i don t care where we are 
i m dumping you flat 
don t sugarcoat it like that  kid 
tell her straight 
i m 26  and i m single
and a schoolteacher 
and that s the bottom of the pit 
and the only excitement i ve known
is here with me now 
so i ll go with you 
and i won t whine 
and i ll sew your socks 
and i ll stitch you when you re wounded 
and i ll do anything you ask of me
except one thing 
i won t watch you die 
i ll miss that scene 
if you don t mind 
the future s all yours 
you lousy bicycles 
well  you know  it could be worse 
you get a lot more for
