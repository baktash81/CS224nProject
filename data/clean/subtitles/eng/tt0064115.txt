i swear thisd work ray
you trust us the government trusts you
anything you tell them
they gotta believe right
youve never done a
dishonest thing ever
and youre pushing 60 wed quit
theyd drop the charges against us
wed fight till the war is over
they dont even have
to make us officers
thats some proposition
they forget all about the years
of thieving and robbing
they take you into the army
which is what you want
in the first place
theres something out there
that scares you huh
but its too late
you shouldve let yourself get killed
while you had the chance
you may be the biggest
thing to hit this area
but youre still twobit outlaws
i never met a soul more
affable than you butch
or faster than the kid
but youre still twobit outlaws
on the dodge
its over dont you get that
your times is over
and youre gonna die bloody
and all you can do is choose where
im sorry

theyre beginning to get on my nerves
who are those guys
you remember the time
you me and etta went to denver

thats an important topic
considering our situation
the night we went gambling remember
we had dinner at the hotel
etta had roast beef and i had chicken
if i can remember what you had
ill die happy
look out there
what
i got to talking to
some gambler that night
he told us about an indian
fullblooded indian
except he used an english name
sir somebody
lord baltimore
thats right and he could track anybody
over anything day or night
so
the guy on the ground i think its him
no baltimore works out of oklahoma
hes strictly an oklahoma man
i dont know where we are
but it isnt oklahoma
ah it couldnt be him
it couldnt be him
i guess
whoever it is
it sure the hell is somebody
damn it
dont they get tired
dont they get hungry
theyve gotta be
why dont they slow up
they could even go faster
at least thatd be a change
they dont even break formation
do something
kid
what
whos the best lawman
best how
you mean toughest or easiest to bribe
toughest
joe lefors
gotta be
lefors never leaves wyoming never
you know that
he always wears a white skimmer
thats how you tell its joe lefors
cause he wears a white straw hat
look at that guy out front
jesus who are those guys
hyah
come on now
here you go kid
go on get out of here go on
what if they dont follow the horse
youre the brains butch
youll think of something
damn it
the way i figure it
we can either fight or give
if we give we go to jail
ive been there already
if we fight
they can stay where they are
and starve us out
or go for position shoot us
might even get a rock slide started
what else can they do
they could surrender to us
but i wouldnt count on that
theyre going for position all right
better get ready
kid the next time i say
lets go someplace like bolivia
lets go someplace like bolivia
next time
ready
no well jump
like hell we will
no itll be ok
if the waters deep enough
and we dont get squished to death
theyll never follow us
how do you know

just one clear shot
thats all i want
i want to fight them
theyll kill us
maybe
you want to die

hey
it was baltimore and lefors
you know who else

you know that
why would these guys join up
and take after us though
forget it bunch like that
wont stay together long
they will
if mr harriman has his way
who
mr eh harriman
of the union pacific railroad
he resents the way youve
been picking on him
so hes outfitted a special train
and hired special employees
youve been avoiding them for two days
its really sort of flattering
if you want to think about it that way
a setup like that costs more
than we ever took
apparently he can afford it
that crazy harriman
thats bad business
how long do you think
id stay in operation
if every job cost me money
if hed just pay me what hes spending
to make me stop robbing him
id stop robbing him
you probably inherited
every penny you got
inherited guys
what the hell do they know
you say they were hired permanent
no just till they kill you
that means theyre
still after us butch
and its going to be the same thing
all over again
theyll show up here
sooner or later
hey etta
ill get you some more
butch and me have been
talking it all over
wherever the hell bolivia is
thats where were off to
well go down there and play it safe
maybe keep our hand in a little bit
butch speaks some spanish
i can wrestle with a menu ok
and you speak it good
and itd be good cover
going with a woman
no one expects it
then we could travel safer
what im saying is
if you want to go
i wont stop you
but the minute you start to whine
or make a nuisance
i dont care where we are
im dumping you flat
dont sugarcoat it like that kid
tell her straight
im 26 and im single
and a schoolteacher
and thats the bottom of the pit
and the only excitement ive known
is here with me now
so ill go with you
and i wont whine
and ill sew your socks
and ill stitch you when youre wounded
and ill do anything you ask of me
except one thing
i wont watch you die
ill miss that scene
if you dont mind
the futures all yours
you lousy bicycles
well you know it could be worse
you get a lot more for
your money in bolivia
i checked on it
what could they have here
that you could possibly want to buy
jeez all bolivia cant look like this
how do you know
this might be the garden spot
of the whole country
people may travel hundreds of miles
just to get to this spot
where were standing now
this might be the
atlantic city new jersey
of all bolivia for all you know
i know more about bolivia
than you know about
atlantic city new jersey
i can tell you that
aha
you do huh
i was born there
i was born in new jersey
brought up there so
i didnt know that
the total tonnage of what you dont know

because youd starve without me
and you your job is to shut up
