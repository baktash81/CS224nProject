not to mention the fact  
  that i really don t want to kill you 
i don t even know what i d

but i can t just let you go 
so   
i have a dilemma 
what time is it 
fuck 
just a minute 
  hello 
  mr  wells 
  dr  jarvis  so good to see you again 
  nice to see you  too 
won t you come in 
sorry about that 
i i couldn t find the key to the door 
  i didn t hear it unlock 
  oh  that s right 
i didn t find it 
um  right this way 
so  mr  wells  you and your wife  
  would like to adopt the baby 
  yes  sir  that s right 
  okay 
now  you understand the next step
in the adoption proceedings 
um  yes  we are to be
individually evaluated 
yes  that s right 
that s why i m here 
uh  your wife  of course   
  has already completed
her evaluation 
she s an extraordinary woman 
absolutely extraordinary woman 
  um  shall we begin 
  sure  yeah  one thing 
weren t we already evaluated
at the previous screening 
no  that was just
the initial consultation 
this is the individual competency test 
do you have a problem
with that  mr  wells 
no    not really 
good  then we can get started 
and what are your
qualifications  dr  jarvis 
are you an m d    uh   
are you nervous  mr  wells 
no 
why 
because what you re
doing is this thing  
  called conversational transference 
simply means that
you re trying to evade  
  answering my question 
by answering me with questions 
it s something that s
usually indulged in  
  by individuals who are
trying to hide something 
are you trying to hide
something from me  mr  wells 
  no 
  good 
  do you currently use drugs 
  no 
not even tylenol 
some    sure 
  any history of drug use 
  uh   
a little  i guess 
about as much as anyone
who goes to college 
justification of drug use 
how about alcohol 
an occasional beer 
you ever been incarcerated
or institutionalized 
  no 
  any history of mental illness 
no 
you know  there s something
about your application  
  that s very troubling to me 
there s a gap of two 
two and a half years 
i mean   
  it occurs  like  five years ago 
  yeah 
can i get you  uh  some iced tea 
  no  no  thank you 
  i m a little dry 
  do you mind 
  oh  no  please  go  go right ahead 
i asked because
your wife was very vague  
  about what you might have been doing  
  and i was hoping you might be able  
  to shed a little bit
of light on it for me 
uh    i was in l a 
yes  that s just what your wife said 
could you be a little bit
more specific  though 
oh  well   
i i was doing some odd jobs   
  and this and that  you know 
no  i don t know 
could you elaborate 
well  i did work
as a mechanic for a while 
oh  you mean like  for a body shop 
no  i mean like in a performance shop 
  perf   
  well  exotics and  uh  rally cars 
oh  uh huh

i think i would like some iced tea 
i m sorry

can you give me  uh 
just a second 
don t sit down 
  hello 
  case 
nick  you get the fuck
back here right now 
no  i got myself
in a little trouble  case 
you  my friend  are in a lot more
trouble than you fuckin  know 
  yalie  huh  i m a vassar gal myself 
  oh  really 
  what was your major 
  poly sci and philosophy  you mind 
casey s got to be real fucked up  
  if you re making a house call 
i m beginning to think so  yes 
some jamaican showed up here 
and he tried to kill me 
and now one of your bimbos
is sitting in my living room 
  bimbo 
  some bitch named dallas 
tell me  you re not
one of those  uh   
  freudian sub intellectuals
who waste all their time  
  fixating on penis envy 
well  sex is a prime motivator 
i mean  indirectly  i believe sex  
  is behind most of our major
thought processes 
  you think so 
  absolutely 
  do you like pornos 
  excuse me 
you know  pornos 
fuck films 
surely you ve heard stories 
yes  i ve heard stories   
  but i ve never    never really
given them that much thought 
i love them  especially fag flicks 
their big cocks sliding in
and out of each other 
fuck  that gets me so wet they have
to steam clean the seat after i leave 
in fact   
  i m getting wet
just talking about it 
  what aren t you telling me  nick 
  nothing  case 
  just don t give her my shit 
  don t worry  i don t have it 
  you give it to the jamaican 
  no 
  i flushed it down the sink 
  what 
i went on as a day player
on this porn film in l a 
just to see what it was like  right 
so  i spent five hours with this guy
ramming his dick up my ass  
  and these two women licking my clit 
not what you d expect  though 
it s just acting 
i mean  at first  it was great 
then you have some prick director that
comes over and yells  cut  in your face  
  and some queen makeup artist that
comes over every couple of minutes  
  to touch up the makeup that s
been slobbered off your tits 
so you don t really
have a chance to enjoy it 
finally  i just walked off the set 
cool experience  though 
you got a hard on  jarv 
all right   
time to go 
your cow is calling you 
  i am so sorry  dr  jarvis 
  oh  no  please  take your time 
you get the fuck out of my house 
did you say you were from l a  
  what 
  what 
is that how you answer
the phone these days 
i m sorry  honey 
i thought you were somebody else 
did you know mr  wells
when he was living in l a  
well  not directly 
course  i heard of his work 
his work 
isn t that why you re here 
what do you need 
i mean  how s your day going 
tough  we re at
an impasse on the fee  so   
  that s great  honey 
  what  casey  are you okay 
how s everything there 
oh  it s interesting 
you really wouldn t believe it 
have you seen dr  jarvis 
  yes  and he s here right now 
  really 
  how s it going 
  huh   
and then  once i met nick  i got
the full blown casey wells story 
  you want one 
  one what 
a casey wells story 
  yes  i would 
  how about the last one 
  fine 
  all right 
nick and casey  
  had this guy  jimmy 
a small time nothing   
  a bird dog for some
of the mid level players 
it s cool  man 
you just took too big a lick 
that is some rank fuckin  shit  man 
and he set up
a meeting between them  
  and this big nigger
named    uh  lester james 
of course  most people
knew him as ballpeen 
ballpeen s casa at 7 00 
where in the fuck a nigger
get a name like that 
  you seen little nigger s arm  right 
  oh  yeah 
  that s why they call him ballpeen 
  he broke jimmy s arm   
    with a ten pound ball peen hammer 
three years ago
 lester james   a k a  ballpeen   
  was a big  stud motherfucker 
had a stable of bitches
he fucked on a regular basis   
  but every couple weeks   
he went out to get some strange 
one night  lester finds
himself in this titty bar   
  and this knockout white girl named raven 
is just gyrating her little tits off 
well  lester wanted her
in the worst way 
even more when she told him
to go fuck himself 
he sprinkles
a little fairy dust on her   
  somehow gets her
to go back to his place 
that was all she wrote 
he  abused  this bitch 
he fucked her every way
you can think of and then some 
finally  he gets ready
to go again  and he figures  
  he d  really  degrade this bitch
and make her blow him 
so  he pushes her head down
and  bam 
she bites that
motherfucker s dick    clean off 
fortunately  they found it
and sewed it back on 
but it never worked right again 
the problem is  a story like that
gets around  you know how it is 
so to combat this  anytime he
even heard anybody talk about it   
  he d use this fuckin  hammer on them 
 ballpeen  kind of stuck 
and jimmy 
over the years  this kind
of shit gets out of control 
so one day  ballpeen 
shows up late for a meeting  
  and jimmy made the mistake
of asking if he d been jerking off 
next thing you know 
jimmy s got a broken arm 
goddamn 
fast forward to ballpeen s 
just another drug deal  
  in  la la land  
  motherfuckers team make it out here 
want to get this over with 
shit makes me nervous 
what the fuck
is up with this shit 
you must have some pretty
bad fuckin  karma   
  feel the need
for that kind of artillery 
don t worry  babe 
it s cool 
  casey   
  whoa  whoa  hey  man 
fuck you  you in my
motherfuckin  house 
now  come on 
big black man

help yourself 
derrick 
count  em  jimmy 
some more  square 
since we re all good friends here 
i got a question for you 
ask away 
it s all here  case 
i heard about
this big  bad motherfucker 
he s got this habit
of hitting niggers with his hammer 
i ve heard the reason
why he uses it  
  and i can sympathize 
but  uh   
there s this one thing   
  that i just    i can t
get it out of my head 
  go on 
  well   
i heard about how most niggers got
these really big dicks  you know 
i mean   
just salami sized cocks 
well   
now  i ve had many
a different blow job   
  by any number of different bitches 
so  i know how much room
even my white boy dick  
  takes up in a bitch s mouth  right 
my question   
  is how the hell this little bitch   
  got this big  nigger dick in her mouth   
  chomped it off all in one bite 
she could have gnawed
on it for a while  but  
  i don t think there s a
motherfucker in here let that happen 
  yo  we got a problem here 
  so  the only thing i can think of   
  is that this big 
bad ass kickin  nigger  
  had this little  itty bitty dick   
  wouldn t have done
him no good  anyway 
what do you think 
am i close 
i said  we got a
motherfuckin  problem here

blow off her chances  
  for happy meals and diaper wipes 
it s red  asshole 
  where is it 
  i ll tell you  if you answer one question 
sure  shoot 
are you on the rag 
because you look like
one of those women who are   
  explosive under stressful
situations  and   
being married  you should fucking
know how much women hate that question 
but being a typical male   
  you ignore your better judgment  
  and ask anyway  huh 
i should just do your wife
a favor and blow your head off 
it s as if every mood swing
can be written off as 
 she s just on the rag  
like that explains something 
women have mood shifts 
that  is  a fact of life 
and for your information 
i am a complete bitch   
  whether i m on the rag or not 
hmm 
now  let me answer your question 
  does that answer it

i am not a drug dealer 
it s been four years   
  since i ve even seen any drugs 
i m an architect 
i am a happy little republican   
  who spends the majority of his time   
  trying to figure out how
to pay the fucking bills  
  and make his wife happy 
i got to tell you  casey 
i m not impressed 
after everything i heard about you   
  i thought you were
gonna be more like    me 
but you are a sheep 
like all the rest 
there will come a time   
  when even you 
can t handle it anymore 
you ll pack it up
or you ll put a bullet  
  in that pretty little head of yours 
or someone else will 
you are a pussy  casey 
nick wouldn t admit it 
but it s true 
you just couldn t
handle it  could you

  that s happening 
even if you weren t the most
disgusting bitch i d ever met

goddamn  did you see the way
that bitch head explode  shit 
ordinarily  it would be a damn shame
to shoot a piece of ass like that 
you know what i mean  but in
her case  i ll make an exception 
i always hated that bitch 
my name s billy hill 
my friend s call me hill billy 
you can call me mr  hill 
i hope i didn t interrupt
anything too romantic for you   
  but that whore could go all day long 
besides  i was getting tired
sitting down in the cab of my truck 
she lost me on the freeway 
let me give you a little
friendly piece of advice 
i know you re retired  you got
this family thing going here 
but you really ought to have
your name and number unlisted 
information girl
give me your address 
your fucking address  man 
that don t sound too smart 
  what are you looking for 
  tequila 
  to your right 
  mm 
the good stuff 
fancy 
you got any limes 
no  just as well 
oh  yeah  damn 
it always tastes like old feet to me 
that shit ll fuck you up 
though  mm 
you ever hear how it s made 
a bunch of mexicans    sitting
around this big wooden vat  
  chewing on agave  right 
they do this days and days
spitting into this giant vat 
then when it s full   
  then they leave that there
to ferment 
when it s ready   
  they scoop off the top layer 
that s mescal 
nasty  huh 
no wonder that shit tastes so bad 
well  i ain t going to shit you  pal 
when i leave here today   
  you re going be dead
as cinderella over there 
regardless of what you tell me   
  i m gonna fuck you up 
ready to get started 
i know you threw out the smack 
and you probably don t know
where the money is  neither 
that s cool 
the truth is   
i ain t got nothing better to do   
  while i wait here
for my old friend  nick 
just so you know  i ain t
going to let you bleed to death 
no  sir 
 cause when i cut you   
  i m going to cauterize you 
i consider myself an artist

  i picked up this little girl
at this club one time   
  and i cut on her for 16 hours 
that s a personal best 
but i keep hopin

to blame for all this
