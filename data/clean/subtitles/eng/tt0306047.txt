sir i think you need
to go on tv
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a ufo
dont spell in front of me
damn it
aliens sir
theres no such thing
as aliens
thats not quite true
sir
a year ago a ufo crashlanded
in new mexico
a body may have been recovered
may have been
well there was
a terrible mixup
it was thanksgiving
the body was sent down
to the kitchen
they shoved stuffing up its ass
and we ate it at a state dinner
thats the last i saw of it
no scratch that
there were some sandwiches
made the next day
mr president

ive been having
since the news about the aliens
somethings not right

its like that feeling
that somethings not right
what is it
some old tupac sir
hiphop music plays
all eyez on me
hey this shit is banging
thank you sir
i appreciate it
air horn blows
oh
hello cindy
i am the architect
you have many questions
jeopardy theme plays
ive been watching you
for a very long time
so i see
what is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape
the answer is simple
you are the eventuality
of an anomaly
you are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability
sedulant
grotesquerie
no
what about
contingent affirmation
thats got to mean something
hey
hey
you put cameras in my bathroom
gasps
what is this
oh my god
well it was a long winter
this is an invasion of
ow
oh sorry
i cant help it
its very lonely in here
ergo i havent been with anyone
in a very long time
not counting myself
or this chair
i call her
linda
could you just cut to the chase
im kind of in a rush
why you can always sleep over
if you want
lindas built for two
and she vibrates
stop it just tell me
what i need to know
who is that little girl
okay okay
my wife and i wanted a child
but she couldnt get pregnant
neither could i
so you adopted
we loved our daughter
but she was evil
made the horses crazy
killed our puppies
hid the remote
really sick shit
my wife took her
to the old family farm
and drowned her in the well
i felt a simple timeout
would have been sufficient
but tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape
i never meant for it
to get out but
but what
i put it in the wrong box
and returned it to blockbuster
instead of my copy
of pootie tang
its been circulating
and killing ever since
just like pootie tang
but what does this
have to do with aliens
i dont know
perhaps tabithas summoning them
to kill us all
an alien invasion
i have to warn the world
its already begun
youre too late
oh my god
but not too late
to make an old man happy
what
and now reports of lights
in the sky
glimpses of spacecraft
possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world
are they aliens
the first video images
are coming in
disturbing home video tonight
from a ranch
outside sydney australia

harris are you sure
this is necessary wilson
having an awards ceremony
at a time like this

appear business as usual
the nation while not yet
panicked is deeply disturbed
