in middleburg at this hour 
a mysterious
crop circle appeared
in local farmer tom logan s
cornfield 
elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon 
we ll update you as soon as we

is happening in that small town 
ross

the crop circle story 
oh come on  you know
those things are just a hoax 
no i m telling you i sense
something about that cornfield 
call it women s intuition
or espn or both 
but i can tell
when danger s near 
 gasps 
ow 
ow 
my eyes 
cindy it s sweeps month 
ratings mean everything 
people want
human interest stories 
like the one you did yesterday 
the report
on breast augmentation 
it was just 10 minutes
of topless women 
i mean come on 
man  wow 
why are these so interesting 
oh for god s sake 
 sighs 
people don t care about this 
they want hard hitting stories

is this cindy campbell 
if what she says is true we re
facing an unprecedented crisis 
get me the president 
you are the president 
good  then i already know
about this 
let s order lunch 
sir i think you need
to go on tv
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a ufo 
don t spell in front of me
damn it 
aliens sir 
there s no such thing
as aliens 
  that s not quite true 
  sir 
a year ago a ufo crash landed
in new mexico 
  a body may have been recovered 
   may have been  
well there was
a terrible mix up 
it was thanksgiving 
the body was sent down
to the kitchen 
they shoved stuffing up its ass
and we ate it at a state dinner 
that s the last i saw of it 
no scratch that 
there were some sandwiches
made the next day 
mr  president 
  listen to me 
  agent thompson 
back away from that window 
what  did i forget
to put my pants on again 
no sir  it s just a feeling
i ve been having
since the news about the aliens 
  something s not right 
  i know what you mean 
it s like that feeling
that something s not right 
what is it 
some old tupac sir 
 hip hop music plays 
 all eyez on me  
hey this shit is banging 
thank you sir 
i appreciate it 
   air horn blows 
  oh 
hello cindy 
i am the architect 
you have many questions 
  jeopardy   theme plays 
i ve been watching you
for a very long time 
so i see 
what is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape 
the answer is simple 
you are the eventuality
of an anomaly 
you are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability 
sedulant 
grotesquerie 
no 
what about
contingent affirmation 
  that s got to mean something 
  hey 
hey 
you put cameras in my bathroom 
 gasps 
what is this 
oh my god 
well it was a long winter 
this is an invasion of   
ow 
oh sorry 
i can t help it 
it s very lonely in here 
ergo i haven t been with anyone
in a very long time
not counting myself 
or this chair 
i call her   
linda 
could you just cut to the chase 
i m kind of in a rush 
why  you can always sleep over
if you want 
linda s built for two
and she vibrates 
stop it  just tell me
what i need to know 
who is that little girl 
okay okay 
my wife and i wanted a child
but she couldn t get pregnant 
neither could i 
so you adopted 
we loved our daughter
but she was evil 
made the horses crazy
killed our puppies
hid the remote 
really sick shit 
my wife took her
to the old family farm
and drowned her in the well 
i felt a simple time out
would have been sufficient 
but tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape 
i never meant for it
to get out but   
but what 
i put it in the wrong box
and returned it to blockbuster
instead of my copy
of  pootie tang  
it s been circulating
and killing ever since 
just like  pootie tang  
but what does this
have to do with aliens 
i don t know 
perhaps tabitha s summoning them
to kill us all 
an alien invasion 
i have to warn the world 
it s already begun 
you re too late 
oh my god 
but not too late
to make an old man happy 
what 
and now reports of lights
in the sky 
glimpses of spacecraft 
possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world 
are they aliens 
the first video images
are coming in 
disturbing home video tonight
from a ranch
outside sydney australia
