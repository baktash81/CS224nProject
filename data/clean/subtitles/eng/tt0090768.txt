she s a new student here at taft   
and l hope that
you will make her feel very welcome 
amelia  we re discussing
romeo and juliet today 
the theme  young love 
pure  passionate  ill fated 
lt was not original   
even when shakespeare
wrote this play in 1596 
the charm of romeo and juliet
is its language 
when juliet learns who romeo is 
she speaks 
  my only love sprung from my only hate 
  too early seen unknown 
and known too late    
l was approaching the red light and
l was coming through this point here 
l put on my brakes 
and the guy smashed right into me 
please make sure collins takes that file
to the conference in chicago 
 yes  mr  brandt 
 mr  brandt 
yeah 
hi  l m charlene michaelson   
donald michaelson s wife 
yes  of course 
we re all very sorry to hear about donald 
he was a delightful man 
thank you 
so l understand you re going to give
the insurance business a go 
well  l m not new to the business 
l was a regional manager
when donald and l first met 
l can t imagine
things have changed so much in 13 years 
louis 
 starting a new graveyard 
 yeah  duke got killed 
he was one of your favorites  wasn t he 
he was a good man  but he got careless 
a sniper got him 
you got to be careful in this war 
why don t you come on inside
and set the table  okay 
okay 
 hi  l m home 
 hi  mom 
how was school 
l got homework already 
what are your teachers like 
mrs  sherman  mom  she s great 
 what about yours  louis 
 she gave me homework already 
yeah  well   
guess what 
your mom s got homework  too 
what 
suddenly it seems the entire
insurance business is run by computers 
oh  no 
they got me working on a trial basis
till l can figure it out 
he sent me home with
a whole carload full of books to study 
 lt s okay  l ll be all right 
 l m sure you will 
l found out about the boy next door 
his name s eric gibb 
they think he s autistic 
he s got some marbles loose  or what 
well  they don t exactly know 
but he s never spoken a word in his life 
and he doesn t like to be around people 
there s some institute
that wants to come and take him away   
but mrs  sherman says
he s better off with his uncle 
he s in my class at school 
mrs  sherman used to teach
those kind of kids 
she thinks that maybe being around
normal people will help him  or something 
where are his parents 
that s the weird part 
when eric was five years old   
his parents went on a trip
to spain or france  or someplace like that 
the plane crashed and they died 
oh  dear 
now  what l heard   
is at the moment the plane went down   
eric was alone in his room 
and without anybody
even telling him anything   
he started to pretend to fly 
lt s like  somehow he knew
his parents were about to crash 
the way he figured he could save them
was by being an airplane 
he s been one ever since 
we have the staff and facilities
to give individual care 
he s doing fine at home  and
l m giving him special attention at school 
 he ll be safer with us 
 he doesn t want to be there 
you saw how sick he got last time 
he had a fever  lt had nothing to do
with being in the institute 
look  he still exhibits antisocial behavior 
lt wasn t the fever 
he s afraid of being confined 
l think  gentlemen  if you let him go 
you ll find out he ll go in by himself 
be careful with him on the stairs 
you need any help 
mil  what s happening 
he s going to hurt himself 
nothing is prepared here for him 
the windows don t have screens on them 
there s furniture with edges on it 
this place is not safe for him 
his place is here  ln his own home   
 with his own family 
 stop it 
what s going on 
l don t know  mom 
he s going to hurt himself on this 
l told you that 
that s why he has the straitjacket 
we really shouldn t be doing this 
lt s none of our business 
take that damn straitjacket off him 
come into the hall 
l ll show you what l ve got 
lt is not a question of safety 
lt is a question of caring 
allen 
he s okay there  he won t fall  believe me 
christ 
he s going to hurt himself 
he needs constant supervision and care 
he needs somebody watching him
24 hours a day 
 bedtime 
 okay 
we have no alternative
but to place him in the institute 
we re going to have
a coed volleyball game 
dexter  set up over here  please 
scott  the other court 
quickly 
quickly  quickly 
come on 
thanks 
 so what do you think 
 oh  my god 
 what did you do to get that  mona 
 l accepted his invitation to the fair   
 and he was overwhelmed with passion 
 the fair s over two months away 
you d better start whipping your ass
around campus now   
 or you ll wind up going with eric there 
 you can fly to the fair with him 
okay  girls  cut the crap and warm up 
will anybody volunteer
to warm up with eric 
anyone 
come on 
l ll do it 
thank you  milly 
remember  he won t catch the ball
when you throw it to him 
 so just be gentle  but be persistent 
 okay

lauren  you take the ball out 
lt s your turn to serve 
hi  eric

  your son refuses to join
in classroom activities

  we ll have to have a conference
with the principal   
louis  how can you do this

how d you get in here 
milly 
milly  come quick 
the vacuum cleaner s eating my shirt 
thanks 
what do you know about eric 
have you ever seen him
do anything weird 
 that is all l ve ever seen him do 
 no  l mean really weird 
dinky patterson told me
something weird about him once 
who s dinky patterson 
dinky lived here before you 
had your room 
dinky used to get really annoyed
with eric climbing outside his window 
so he took his bb gun 
stuffed the barrel with wet kleenex   
 and started shooting at eric 
 that s sweet 
he said he kept it up for about an hour 
but eric wouldn t budge  so he gave up 
here s the weird part 
the next day 
dinky s looking around for his bb gun 
you know where he said he found it 
see that telephone pole 
dinky said it was up there 
up on top of that box 
that  somehow  eric put it there 
of course 
dinky was the biggest liar l ever knew 
 lt probably never happened 
 probably 
what happened to dinky 
why did he move 
his dad got some hotshot job in atlanta 
took the whole family 
so  where s your dad 
he died 
what of  
cancer 
everyone in my family dies of cancer 
my grandmother had stomach cancer 
she lost 300 pounds before she died 
never looked better in her life 
what kind did your dad have 
 l don t know 
 they didn t tell you 
they never tell the kids 
 did it take a long time 
 can we drop the subject 
 sure 
 thanks 
what were we talking about 
eric 
eric  get away from the edge 
what are we doing 
hey  wait a minute 
why are we doing this 
l don t think we should be doing this 
get your mother  louis 
are you sure you want to do this 
this may not be too good of an idea 
milly  hello 
mom  come quick  emergency situation 
milly  careful 
milly 
l m okay  mom  come on  eric 
honey  be careful 
 no problem  mom 
 where are you taking him 
there s a window over here  we re okay 
mil 
you okay 
milly 
 we re fine  you guys 
 all right  way to go 
 you coming down 
 yeah  just a sec 
eric   
you re safer out on the windowsill 
so don t go on the roof again  okay 
something tells me
you know what l m saying 
you re just not letting on 
 bye  eric  you stay here 
don t shake the floor  please 
there we go 
you see  you can t start on a bottle
until the cork lands on its feet 
lt s very frustrating
when it takes a long time 
on the other hand  it s quite delightful
when it happens on the first toss 
care for a drink 
no  no  thank you 
 are you calling me a drunk 
 no 
why not 
well  because it wouldn t be polite 
polite 
well  it s more polite to be called a drunk
than a madman 
wouldn t you agree 
yeah  l guess so 
there you go 
l do believe we haven t met 
my name s hugo gibb 
l m milly michaelson  l live next door 
eric was out on the roof 
so l helped him back inside 
what on earth possessed you to do that 
l was afraid he would fall and get hurt 
afraid he would fall 
would you be afraid of a balloon falling 
or a bubble dropping 
or a feather fluttering to the ground 
no 
there you go 
lt s past your bedtime  louis 
so make it quick 
well  it was weird  that s all 
first your story about eric and the bb gun 
then uncle hugo telling me
how eric can t fall 
that s because uncle hugo
does enough falling for the both of them 
l hate people who can t hold their liquor 
your mom s out for the evening 
l have an idea 
banana 
nectarine 
rum 
will you give me
some of that tanqueray over there 
l don t know about this  lf my mom knew  
would you stop with   if my mom knew   
lf l did everything my mom said 
l d be a nun  you re 14 years old  live 
okay 
 this looks  like  really disgusting 
 lt s like strawberries with a little    
hey  to uncle hugo 
look at him 
 scary face 
 yeah  very scary 
give up  john  admit who you are 
what 
change the channel 
no 
this is romantic 
lf eric wasn t the way he is   
would you   
consider him handsome 
l guess he d be okay
if he didn t have the brains of a goldfish 
 geneva 
 what is it with you and eric 
that s all you ever talk about 
you can t be in love with a retard 
lt s just not done 
well  what if he s fooling 
what if   
a bad witch   
put an evil spell on eric   
and all he needs   
is the kiss of a young maiden   
to turn him back into a prince 
that s beautiful 
 bye  geneva 
  bye  milly 
 l love geneva 
 l love you  too  ma 
 yeah  l know 
l love   
all the people   
in all the world 
l even love louis tonight 
are you mad at me  mom 
no  l ll be mad at you in the morning
when you re sober 
 are you going to call me 
 yeah  l will 
milly 
can l see you  dear 
okay  just a second  mrs  sherman 
not now  eric 
l hear you ve been helping eric
in his gym class 
l just threw him the ball a couple of times 
 and you moved into the patterson house 
 yes 
 have you met eric s uncle 
 yesterday 
why don t you sit down  milly 
did he tell you that eric could fly 
yeah 
then l guess you see
what kind of guardian he must be 
ln fact  if it hadn t been for my support   
the state institute
would have put eric away long ago 
and that can t happen  milly 
the state people mean well   
but eric can t exist
in that kind of environment 
a while ago  his uncle went on a binge   
and they did put eric away
for about a month 
he got sick   
very sick 
he was dying 
no one knew why  but l was convinced   
that he had just given up 
l promised them then
that l would watch over him 
but l can t be with him all the time 
anyway   
l was hoping maybe you d help 
l ll give you extra credits 
lt can be your science project 
l don t know anything
about those kind of kids 
you don t have to 
all you have to do is be yourself 
besides  what l saw out there   
no doctor has ever been able
to do with him 
he was following you  mimicking you   
wanting to be like you 
doctors haven t been able
to get a word out of him 
maybe a friend could 
mrs  sherman said l should keep a journal 
so here it goes 
day number one 
l sat in the back of the class with eric
for about an hour today 
l figured that since he likes to copy me 
l could teach him stuff 
but  somehow  it s not that simple 
he really doesn t understand 
he doesn t see the words 
or even the book 
all he sees is me 
l have the same problem with him
in gym class 
he won t catch the ball or throw it 
he won t do anything on his own 
milly 
milly 
say it 
milly 
and  of course  he won t talk 
he won t smile  cry  or do anything 
unless he s mimicking me 
l have lunch with him every day 
just him and me   
right there in the middle of the schoolyard 
l m beginning to think
this is a big mistake 
lt s been two weeks since l started
with eric and nothing s really changed 
sure  he imitates everything l do 
but a parrot can do that 
l m like one of his airplanes 
something to watch  to copy 
lt s not as if we really communicate 
lt s not as if l m really a friend 
l m about to give up 
day 21  something happened today 
he smiled 
he didn t smile because l smiled 
he smiled because he wanted to 
today  l finally saw something
hiding behind those eyes 
today l saw eric 
today we did things l thought he d like 
lt s working 
  he told them all the sad things that
happened to dumbo  cause of his big ears 
  they flew down and offered to help 
  one of the crows took timothy aside 
   flying s just like swimming  
he whispered 
   lt s just a matter of believing
that you can do it    
day 33 
just when everything was going well 
it got better 
okay  ready 
here we go 
tommy  lt s time to go home 
sic them 
sic them 
no  no 
right there  hold this above your head 
there you go 
hold it up  and don t let go till l tell you 
 sic them 
 all right  let go 
all right  let him hit it 
watch out 
milly  heads up 
you did it  eric  you did it 
every day eric opens up a little bit more 
every day he tells me a new secret 
l don t know
if he s becoming more like me   
or l m becoming more like him 
somehow those differences
don t seem to matter 
sometimes l feel like l m    
do it again 
all right  eric 
you re on 
don t be nervous  you can do this 
l know you can 
right there 
you ready 
catch it 
now catch it 
don t do this to me  eric 
put your hands up and catch it 
you can do it 
catch it 
okay  you ready 
maybe you should try it again later 
no  he can do it 
throw that as hard as you can at my face 
 milly  
 no  don t worry about it  he ll catch it 
maybe l should leave the country 
change my name  or something 
how could you do all this 
now l m in big trouble 
 what did you do 
 l signed mom s name   
to all those notes from your teacher 
now she s going to find out 
 you re right  you re in big trouble 
 shut up 
wonderful day  just wonderful

that s probably her now 
maybe she ll be in a good mood 
eric  come on

how was work

   indigenous to the rainforest 
okay  is that everybody 
we ll just hold it here for a second 
here we have reached
a more temperate climate zone 
l don t know if you know what that means 
a temperate zone is one
where you have warm winters    
sorry  cool winters and warm summers 
so the vegetation here is the vegetation
that flourishes under those conditions 
we ve got lantana and fuchsia 
all plants that do well
in a temperate zone 
from this angle  too 
you can see how high up the dome goes 
lts height is 70 feet in the center
at the highest point 
the actual area that it covers   
is 15 386 square feet 
the diameter is 140 feet across    
mona  you re not going to go up there 
you re going to fall  mona

you are going to show me 
eric 
honey  what s the matter  sweetie 
l was flying with eric   
l saw dad  and mona threw a ball at me 
and l fell 
 lt was just a dream 
 no 
l mean  yes  it was a dream 
but he caught me in real life 
what are you saying  sweetie 
he caught me

mrs  michaelson  dr  granada

you stay here 
thank you 
dr  reynolds  please report to five west    
amelia 
l m dr  granada 
may l come in 
sure 
dr  nelson asked me
to come by and see you 
ls it okay if we talk a few minutes 
 yeah 
 good 
tell me about your accident 
l was on a bridge  reaching for a flower 
and l fell over the railing 
you told your mother something
about a boy who rescued you 
what are you  a shrink 
 yes 
 great  now l m wacko 
lt s important that you tell me
everything you remember about this 
let me be the judge
of whether you re wacko or not  okay 
yeah  okay 
l fell 50 feet without a mark on me 
except for this 
and l got this when l hit the railing 
l didn t hit the ground 
somebody caught me 
lt was a boy named eric 
he can fly 
l m wacko  right 
no 
but did you see him fly 
no 
but you don t know eric 
all he does is sit in his windowsill
and pretend to fly 
his uncle says he s seen him do it   
and l ve seen really weird things
around the house 
he can 
what other explanation could there be 
you fell 
you have a concussion 
you were losing consciousness 
maybe what you thought
was eric catching you   
was a tree or a bush breaking your fall 
your mind could be playing tricks on you 
lt can do that 
that s impossible 
lt s more possible
than a boy who could fly 
dr  nelson told me about your father 
he committed suicide not long ago 
he did not 
how did he die 
my father had cancer 
and when he found out   
that he had it   
he didn t want the rest of the family
to suffer needlessly 
so one day   
he kissed us all good bye 
he said that he loved us very much 
then he went away 
lt s okay  amelia 
milly 
lt s okay  milly

hi  geneva 
they re flying  this is great

l don t believe it  you look fantastic 
uncle hugo  my sister can fly 
that s good  louis 
see  l told you 
mom 
hi  geneva 
hey  lou 
eric 
good   
bye   
milly 
l   
love   
you 
eric 
that night l found out why eric flew away 
our house was crawling with people
who wanted to see eric gibb   
the boy who could fly 
there were scientists and doctors
and tv reporters 
full color t shirts of eric gibb 
the flying boy 
when they couldn t find eric 
they did tests on me   
because l flew with him 
they did tests on uncle hugo  too   
because he was a relative
and had the same genes 
then they took everything out of his room
and sent it to some laboratory 
l guess eric was afraid
they d do the same to him 
the children 
in an adolescent sexual frenzy   
somehow mesmerized the crowd    
everyone had a theory
on how eric was able to fly 
but there was one l liked the best 
eric always dreamed of flying 
so maybe if you wish hard enough   
and love long enough  anything s possible 
mrs  sherman was right 
eric made us believe
that anything is possible if you really try 
uncle hugo stopped drinking 
he even went out and got a job 
max got better 
he was weak and sore and broken up 
but he was going to be okay 
mom locked herself in a room for a day
and figured out that computer 
and then there was louis 
there was no stopping him 
you stay here  max  l got to do this alone 
 sonny  it s michaelson 
 get him 
 all right 
 we got him 
so you thought
you could get around the block 
go ahead  make my day 
l m supposed to be real scared
of a water pistol 
ain t no water in this gun 
so what s in it 
piss 
shit 
hitler  sic him 
way to go  max 
all right 
mom  milly  we did it 
lt s been a while since we flew 
and eric hasn t come back 
but somehow he s still
a big part of our lives 
he made us believe in ourselves again 
now when l feel like giving up 
not trying   
all l have to do is think about him
and what he taught me 
l was telling geneva just the other day   
we re all special 
we re all a little like eric 
maybe we can t soar up into the clouds
