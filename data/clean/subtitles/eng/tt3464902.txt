youll have to hurry up
he decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear
his back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past
when the pain was intolerable
he was thinking his wife
didnt love him at all any more
he didnt burst into tears and he didnt think
that the first thing people most people do
when they realise someone
doesnt love them anymore is cry
sir do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me
thatll do thank you
have you ever been on your own before
no never
are you allergic to any foods
no
your last relationship
lasted how many years
around 12
do you remember how long exactly sir
11 years and one month
sexual preference
women
however i had one homosexual
experience in the past
in college
is there a bisexual option available
no sir this option is no longer available
since about last summer
due to several operational problems
im afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered
as a homosexual or a heterosexual
i think i should be registered
as a heterosexual
any children sir
no
and the dog
my brother he was here a couple of years
ago but he didnt make it
you might remember him
medium build 48 years old
bald patch blond hair
im afraid not sir
ok i would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters
and sign it please
that will do thank you very much
ok so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts
these are only for the couples
you can use facilities for individual
sports such as squash and golf
you can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days
youll be staying in a single room
if everything goes well and you make it
youll be moved to a double room
im afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings
we will provide everything you need
as far as garments accessories
and shoes are concerned
you can keep this
thank you
shoe size please
fortyfour and a half
fortyfour of fortyfive
there are no half sizes
fortyfive
if you need a haircut
call reception one day ahead
smoking is not allowed
that way youll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired
and your breath wont smell when you kiss
enjoy your stay
excuse me if we need to get a haircut
we must call the reception the day before
is that right
thats right
great
his room number was 101
a tranquiliser gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed
on the table were 20 tranquiliser darts
a black plastic watch
a pair of sunglasses
and a cologne for men
inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers
four identical buttondown shirts
in white and blue
a belt socks underwear a blazer
a striped tie and a white bathrobe
he looked out the window
the unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground
thank god they wear those
waterproof ponchos he thought
room 195
two loners two extra days
room 272
one loner one extra day
hello im the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner
wed like to welcome you
youre one of the lucky ones
you have one of our superior rooms
which means you have a view
did you read the leaflet
yes i did
very good now the fact
that youll turn into an animal
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here
is not something that should upset you
or get you down
just think as an animal youll have
a second chance to find a companion
but even then you must be careful
you need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you
a wolf and a penguin
could never live together
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus
that would be absurd
think about it
i understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you
but it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically
for all possible outcomes
now have you thought of what animal
youd like to be if you end up alone
yes a lobster
why a lobster
because lobsters live for over 100 years
are blueblooded like aristocrats
and stay fertile all their lives
i also like the sea very much
i waterski and swim quite well
since i was a teenager
i must congratulate you the first thing
most people think of is a dog
which is why the world is full of dogs
very few people choose an unusual
animal which is why they are endangered
a lobster is an excellent choice
could you stand for us please
this is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something
rather than just one
we tend to forget that from time to time
the handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow
its alright bob
i hope you enjoy your stay with us
goodbye
have a good day
good morning
room 101
44 days left
breakfast is served
sit where you like
his first day was one hed never forget
near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back
later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds
next to her sat her best friend
he thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee
and thought about his wife for a moment
a woman who seemed to like butter biscuits
offered one to a man drinking
a campari and soda for breakfast
he then looked behind him and saw a woman
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless
and some others in the couples area
whom hed never meet
during his stay at the hotel
that morning he was really hungry
he could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing
hello
hello
ive decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend
let me introduce you this is robert
he stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp
pleased to meet you
im staying in room 101
im on the same floor im 186
would you like to join us
why not
one of these days its gonna be me
on one of those yachts
what are those yachts
its the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one
15 days of vacation just a couple alone
didnt you read the leaflet
i did
have you seen johns leg
no
john would you show your leg
oh yeah
room 187 day two
hello everyone
my mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman
who was better at math than she was
she had a postgraduate degree i think
whereas my mother was only a graduate
i was 19 at the time
my mother entered the hotel but didnt
make it and was turned into a wolf
i really missed her
i found out shed been moved to a zoo
i often went there to see her
id give her raw meat
i knew that wolves liked raw meat
but i couldnt figure out
which of the wolves was my mother
so i used to give a little bit
to each of them
one day i decided to enter the enclosure
i really missed her and i wanted a hug
i climbed the fence and jumped in
all the wolves charged at once
and attacked me
all but two who stood motionless
my guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother
the zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital
thankfully i didnt lose my leg
i just have this limp
which is also my defining characteristic
my wife died six days ago
she was very beautiful
and i loved her very much
she had a limp too
thank you john
you can return to your seat now
lets move on to our next guest
room 104 day two
hello everyone
this is only my second day here
but already i feel like a member
of a wonderful group
my defining characteristic
is that i have a very beautiful smile
somethings gotten hold of my heart
keeping my soul and my senses apart
something has gotten into my life
have you ever danced with anybody
sorry
have you ever danced with anybody
yes
what sort of dancing did you do
just depends on the music
do you need to sit down
no no no im getting ready to dance
ah
in a time there was peace
with no trouble at all
can i sit here
but then you came my way
sorry
and a feeling inside shook my heart
made me want you to stay
all of my life
can i sit here
of course
let me introduce you to my best friend
that woman you were talking to
has no feelings whatsoever
she feels nothing at all
shes the best hunter in the hotel
silent and very fast
shes the womens record holder
192 captives
changing the grey changing the blue
scarlet for me scarlet for you
would you like to dance
every day
you touch me and my mind goes astray
and baby
and baby
somethings gotten hold of my hand
dragging my soul to a beautiful land
somethings gotten into my life
im sorry ive got blood on your shirt
but dont worry there are many ways to
remove bloodstains from clothing
one way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt
another way is to scrub the stains
with cotton wool dipped in ammonia
the third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste like toothpaste
especially if the clothes are delicate
or brightly coloured
but just never use warm water
on blood ever
ok
but then you you you
you
you came my way
but then you came my way
and a feeling i know shook my heart
made me want you to stay
all of my nights and all of my days
i think i have to rest for a little bit
my legs hurting
thats ok
well let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again
and my senses apart
something has invaded my night
painting my sleep with a colour so bright
changing the grey
changing the blue
scarlet for me
scarlet for you
leave the building in an orderly fashion
do hurry up but please be careful
nobody needs to get hurt or injured
and good luck with the hunt
i wish i didnt have this limp
i used to be very good at running
but not any more
im sure ill be slower than them
if i were you id think of some tricks
that use the element of surprise
instead of speed
youre right
thats what ill do
room 186 one loner one extra day
38 days stay left plus one 39
room 180
the days of your stay remain unchanged
room 290
four loners four extra days
154 days left plus four 158
room 101
the days of your stay remain unchanged
32 days left
breakfast is served
man eats alone
how many darts did you use yesterday
please take off your trousers
and sit on the bed
can we not do this today its awful
i know but im afraid we have to do it
and you have no idea how much
it helps you psychologically
in your search for a partner
man eats with woman
lie down
spread your legs more
is your room number 186
yes it is
i imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted
in the rooms
or any other area of the hotel
yes
and yet it has brought to my attention
that you continue to do it
today you became erect quicker
than on other days thats good
please just a little longer
have a good day
thats awful just awful
were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating
yes
what did the photograph show
a naked woman on a horse in the country
if i were in your shoes i would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse
im sure that the horse was once
a weak and cowardly man just like you
woman walks alone
help
help
help
this is not necessary please
it was an accident i got carried away
please
this is not necessary
please place your hand in the toaster
this could be a warning
look ive been good otherwise i
im sorry im sorry please
please please thats hurting
woman walks with man
what they do
as soon as you enter the room
is to wash your body
and your head really well
how do you know
my uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there
no waiters know about the procedure
theyre not allowed inside that room
nevertheless they peel off the skin
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap
afterwards they remove the heart
the eyes and other vital organs of the body
with a laser or scalpels
then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen
that makes total sense
i mean i suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work
than fowls for example
exactly
afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts
into the casks outside
the hotels restaurant
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city
why is that
the blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available
new guests arrived yesterday
yes i saw
i think i saw a woman with a limp
its just a sprained ankle
shell be walking normally again
in a few days
thats a shame
that is a shame indeed
one night on the coach he sat next
to the woman who liked butter biscuits
he gazed out of the window
not looking at anything in particular
just trying to avoid talking to her
hows bob
hes fine
id give anything to go for a walk
with you and bob one afternoon
the dogs not allowed out of the room
im afraid
there are some excuses
that no one can argue with he thought
some excuses are without doubt
better than others
and that was a really good one
these biscuits are for bob
i want you to give them to him
whenever you want to reward him
for something
tell him theyre from me
thank you
can i come to your room sometime
for a chat
i could give you a blowjob
or you could just fuck me
i always swallow after fellatio and ive
got absolutely no problem with anal sex
if thats your thing
my exhusband always used to say i had
the most beautiful thighs hed ever seen
but lets not talk about him
my room number is 180
so my telephone extensions 180
hope i can catch some loners tonight
i havent caught any the last few nights
hope you catch lots too
thank you very much
if i dont find a suitable partner soon
im gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms
out of the window
i want you to know that
my room is on the first floor
i hope i catch some
loners today she said
and i hope you catch lots too
she then told him that if she didnt find
a suitable partner soon
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows
320 maybe or one higher up
480 that would be even better
when she stopped talking he stared at her
blankly not knowing what to say
he then looked out at the woods
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been
not bad bit higher
have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you dont make it
a lobster
im gonna be a parrot if i dont make it
why dont you become parrots too
and then well all be together
youre a complete idiot
picking one of the few animals
that can talk
when you have a speech impediment
youll lisp even as an animal
as for you theyll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die
and then theyll crack open your claws
with a tool like pliers
and theyll suck out what little flesh
you have with their mouths
youre pathetic both of you
im not gonna be turned into some animal
ill come and visit you though
with my partner
when were walking together in some park
or when were swimming in the sea
or when were on one of our trips
friends
im not afraid
room 187 please
its no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples
hello
hello
your swimsuit is very nice
thank
thank you very much
youre welcome
do you like to swim breaststroke
front crawl butterfly or backstroke
i like all strokes equally
you know i love breaststroke
no really
my friends often tease me and say
stop swimming breaststroke all the time
and then they laugh
breaststroke is great
its excellent exercise for the back
when swimming breaststroke
men shouldnt wear swim shorts
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks
but you knew that didnt you
i think your nose is bleeding
really
ah no
this happens to me all the time
its really really annoying
i know i have a nosebleed problem too
i saw what you did it must have hurt
is it coming out
no
yes
can i use a tissue
yes
im gonna ask you a question
and i want you to answer me honestly
whats worse
to die of cold and hunger in the woods
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal
or to have a nosebleed from time to time
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal
exactly
mm
she doesnt suspect that youre lying
no
im very happy
because we have a new couple
they met just two days ago but theyre
very much in love and perfectly suited
they both have the same problem with
their noses they bleed quite suddenly
tomorrow theyll be transferred
to a double room
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom
they will remain in the double room
for two weeks
and then theyll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks
we wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple
im very happy
me too
congratulations
the course of your relationship
will be monitored closely
by our staff and by me personally
if you encounter any problems
any tensions any arguing
that you cannot resolve yourselves
you will be assigned children
that usually helps a lot
good morning room 101
seven days left
breakfast is served
you have really nice hair
i know
look
how do you like mine
well i think you have quite dry hair
the colour is ok though
the most important thing
is that youre not bald
however when it comes to men baldness
is always a possibility you cant avoid
is your father bald
no he isnt
and even if someday i lose my hair there
are things i can do to get my hair back
i can have a hair transplant
you can always tell when someones
had a hair transplant  i know
nice hair is not something you can get
its something youre born with
and the fact that your father isnt bald
shouldnt put you at ease
have you decided what
youre going to do on your last day
im still thinking about it
morning ladies
so today is your last day
and as is customary you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night
what i always say in these situations is
it would be wise to choose
something you cant do as an animal
for example
read a work of classic literature
or sing a song you really like
it would be silly to choose
for example a walk in the grounds
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person
because those are things
you can do as an animal
but first your best friend has written
something shed like to read to you
which is really very touching
we always sat together at school
and whenever i had a problem
i talked to you about it
because you always gave the best advice
when we didnt manage to find
dance partners at the school prom
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength
im sorry that things have come to this
im sure that if you had a few more days
you would find someone just like i did
because youre an admirable person
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts
i was always jealous of your hair
you know that
you were are and always will be
my best friend and ill think of you often
and ill always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday
ill miss you
and however many new girlfriends i make
in a few days when i move back into the city
i dont think ill find another as true
id like to watch the film stand by me
with river phoenix kiefer sutherland
and richard dreyfus alone
excellent choice
lovely film
please leave a message
hello youre probably in the bathroom
thats why you cant hear the phone ring
nothing like a cold shower in the morning
well ill call you a little bit later
after youve finished your shower
well talk later
bye
one day as he was playing golf
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend
that you do have feelings when you dont
than to pretend you dont have feelings
when you do
he also thought that he liked her accent
and hed always preferred women
with short hair
so he decided that she was the one
during the hunt he would follow her
and as soon as she shot a loner
he would say to her
i wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones
why dont you kill him
with your bare hands
and the moment she puts her hands
around the loners throat he would say
i hope he dies right away
did anyone see what happened
what happened
she jumped from the window of room 180
theres blood and biscuits everywhere
i hope she dies right away
on second thoughts
i hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies
i just hope her pathetic screams
cant be heard from my room
because i was thinking about having
a liedown and i need peace and quiet
i was playing golf and im quite tired
the last thing i need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly
i cant hear you with all this screaming
well talk some other time
when its quieter
goodbye
goodbye
one message
hello youre probably in the bathroom
thats why you cant hear the phone ring
nothing like a cold shower in the morning
well ill call you a little bit later
after youve finished your shower
well talk later
bye
mind if i join you
martini
i think we are a match
yes i think so too
the keys to the double room please
i wish you the best of luck
we all wish you the best of luck
do you normally sleep on the left
side of the bed or the right
the right you
the left
perfect
spread your legs
should i turn off the light
or would you like to read
id like to read
does the light bother you
no
im not bothered by light or noise
im a deep sleeper
hello
hello
congratulations
thank you
this is our new daughter
her names elizabeth
elizabeth give the nice man a kiss
hes a friend of mine
the last thing i want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl
come on move away
dont cry elizabeth you should thank me
now youll have a limp
and be more like your father
what was that sound
did you say something
no
do you mind if we fuck in a position
where i can see your face
sure
turn the light on please
so i can see you better
good morning
morning
i killed your brother
i left him to die very slowly
he may not be dead yet even as we speak
i was kicking him for ages
doesnt matter
he whined a little
a strange kind of bark
something like this
it must have been from the pain
you didnt hear anything
no
you really are a deep sleeper
would you like some coffee
id love some
as soon as i wash my face
and brush my teeth though
i cant wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night
about that student
of yours at the university
and his awful final project
its really a very funny story
his name was ryess
ryess ryess
these arent tears its just water
i just washed my face
i knew you were lying
i cant understand why you did it
when you know as well as anyone
that a relationship cannot be built on a lie
were going to the hotel manager right now
and youll get the punishment you deserve
whats the punishment for this
they turn you into the animal
no one wants to be
i saw your partner running back that way
he looked frantic
is everything ok
at first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother
take her legs please
he thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach
but then he thought
there wouldnt be much point
because she was already unconscious
and wouldnt feel any pain
from the kicks or the knife
you have to shoot me
so they wont suspect i helped you
a hotel maid helped him
he couldnt understand why she did it
so he decided to turn her into an animal
he dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place
i asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into
but he always gave me the same answer
thats none of your concern
that night he left the hotel
once and for all
he began to run without knowing
where he was headed
but he was headed towards us
this was the start of his new life
and back then he didnt know
how much it hurts to be alone
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub painrelief ointment on your back
and you are constantly in pain
i found him in the woods
he escaped from the hotel
are you a doctor by any chance
no
thats a pity
we need a doctor around
we had one but they caught him
a couple of months ago
im an architect
thats ok
so welcome
you can stay with us
for as long as you like
you can be a loner until the day you die
there is no time limit
thank you very much
by the way
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted
and any such acts are punished
is that clear
can i have a conversation with someone
of course you can
so as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that
that applies to dance nights as well
we all dance by ourselves
thats why we only play electronic music
what happened to your mouth
he cant speak he was given the red kiss
whats the red kiss
we slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner
and we forced them to kiss each other
that was a couple of days ago now
but the cuts were deep and theyre still
in pain they were flirting you know
some punishments are worse
than other punishments
having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved
and having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit
is worse than having your leg kicked
the punishment i am afraid of
isnt the red kiss but another one
that is called the red intercourse
i have never seen it happen but its
not difficult to imagine what it means
oh my god i am so afraid of it
move
hide
move
hide
that was the first time i saw him
he was hiding behind a tree close to mine
he seemed quite presentable
the next day in the city
he found out that i was shortsighted too
that night in my sleep
i dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city
with a large welllit kitchen
and i was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse
and he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse
and as he was fucking me
a thug came into the kitchen
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one
i woke up terrified
try harder
dont give up you know you should
have been more careful
try harder or theyll find you and youll
be turned into an animal a weak one
we must get a move on now
its really too dangerous to stay here
if you manage to free yourself
run as fast as you can and come find us
if you manage to free yourself
but think youll die from the bleeding
go straight to your grave
have you dug your own grave
yes
very good
thats enough for now
im going to go hunting for truffles
theyre delicious and quite rare
a kilo can fetch a lot of money
youre going to need a pig
theyre impossible to find otherwise
i know
dont be long
gotta get them back in 50 minutes
ok
hello david
hello robert
what you did to that woman was dreadful
she killed my brother
i would have done the same thing
if shed killed you
youre like a brother to me oh
youre my best friend in the whole world
i dont think im your best friend
in the whole world
you used to spend much more time
with john
oh whos john
john the limping man
oh yeah
i didnt even remember his name
or his face
youre the one i think of
whenever i need a friend
nevertheless did john make it
theyre getting ready for the yacht
it all begins this week
everyone says theyre gonna make it
as theyre perfectly suited
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing
thats great
youre not thinking about coming back
you know if you told the hotel manager
about your brother
shed probably forgive you
no its really nice to be on your own
theres no one tying you down
you listen to music whenever you like
you masturbate whenever you want
go for walks whenever you like
have a chat whenever you like
i dont miss companionship at all
i just miss you
cause you were my one true friend
are you gonna shoot me
im afraid so
i only have two days left
what did you say
i cant understand the way you speak
im going to shoot you i only
have two days left i need more time
do you actually believe another day
will make a difference
have you seen how ugly you are
you havent got a chance
if i was a woman
dont tell anyone i helped you
if you want to repay me there is a way
if you kill a rabbit
bring it to me to eat
do you promise
yes
bye
bye
you carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head
you then slice open its belly and stuff it
with wellwashed red and green peppers
not too spicy
and a little garlic and mint
you then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour
thats my favourite food
rabbit

thank you
but even if wed never had children
i would never dream of leaving my wife
even if it was just the two of us
on our own
wed go on trips
wed go to portofino in italy
or go to a greek island for the summer
and so our relationship would be
as intense as it was at the start
i love my wife so much

that part about holiday destinations
in the mediterranean was brilliant

he bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood or something like that
or he cuts it with a penknife
when youre not looking
you two are not suited
shut up dad tell him to leave

and and im quite sure
that stain on his tshirt isnt blood
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup
or red watercolour paint
or something like that
or beetroot juice

im going to fucking kill your arse

where were you
i was looking for you
i was masturbating
behind those trees over there
why arent you dancing
my legs a little sore
did you dig your grave
not yet
i dont mean to pressure you
or to ruin the mood
now that were celebrating
but at some point youll have to do it
dont expect anyone else to dig your grave
for you or to carry your corpse
well throw some dirt over you
but thats about it
tomorrow find a spot you like
where the ground isnt too rocky
and make a start
enjoy the rest of your evening
thank you
as soon as his last patient left
i entered his office and i said to him
honey the dinners ready
however im not sure i can eat right now
one of my front teeth hurts a lot
can you take a look please dear
yes sure no problem he said
and the minute he turned his head i took
the drill and i shoved it into his chest
that story sounds really interesting
but i have to leave
i just remembered i left some batteries
next to a tree down there
and the last thing i want is to lose them
sorry
did you catch rabbits
no someone brought me them
who
a friend of mine
do you want one
no
you dont need to accept rabbits
from other people
if you need more rabbits just ask
and ill bring you more
catching a rabbit is difficult
but ill try to do better
theres no need for you
to be indebted to the others
thank you very much
the man who brought you the rabbits
is he shortsighted
i dont know i dont think so
ok
is that a sparrow up in that tree
i cant really see that far
but i dont think so
are you shortsighted
no
youre lying
its the truth
what does it say here
ykk
you knew that already
all zips say the same thing
im not shortsighted
i dont understand
why you wont believe me
i can see really clearly
i used to be a pilot
youre wearing contact lenses
i dont wear contact lenses
im not shortsighted i swear
you are you think
im an idiot and cant tell
let me see
let me see i want to see your eyes
look up
look up
up up
look down now
look left
look right
up again
im sorry
i thought you were trying to fool me
im sorry
for this synchronisation exercise
we have to fully concentrate
as we both have to press play
at exactly the same time
why dont we just use one headset
because thats the whole point
this is an exercise for us
we have to be totally synchronised
ok
im ready
ok
five four three
two
if i show you the roses will you follow
they call me the wild rose
but my name is elisa day
weve developed a code so that we
can communicate with each other
even in front of the others
without them knowing what we are saying
when we turn our heads to the left
it means
i love you more
than anything in the world
and when we turn our heads to the right
it means
watch out were in danger
we had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up
i love you more than anything in the world
with watch out were in danger
when we raise our left arm it means
i want to dance in your arms
when we make a fist and put it
behind our backs it means
lets fuck
the code grew and grew as time went by
and within a few weeks
we could talk about almost anything
without even opening our mouths
stop it
thats enough
show my parents some respect
they are playing you music
thats ok
no mother it is not ok
please continue
do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else
something else
didnt her parents play beautifully
yes they did
it was wonderful
we love each other and we suit each other
and thats the reason
why weve decided to leave the woods
and stay together forever in the city
tomorrow during the hunt
were going to disappear
and everyone will think weve been captured
and that were going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something
i think the first thing im going to do
when i get into the city
is buy a bathrobe
and then well go to a pool with a high
diving board perfect for diving
and well do
lots of different things together
serious things not silly ones
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together
portofino italian fishing village
and upmarket resort
famous for its picturesque harbour
population 439
beaches nearby
paraggi beach camogli
chiavari and lavagna
serifos greek island located
in the western cyclades
can you imagine why i brought you
to such a quiet place today
no
because i think its the perfect spot
for your grave
now cover yourself with soil
use you hands
over your face too
you wouldnt want your face to get
eaten by dogs would you
if you die before me
ill visit you as often as i can
i promise
i think we should leave right now
the three of us coming here instead of
two or four is very dangerous
why didnt we think of that earlier
highly likely the doctor will suspect us
i suggest that we leave
the first chance we get
right now in fact
dont be afraid
no one will suspect a thing
i bet you werent expecting this surprise
isnt it wonderful
yes it is
still id like a few days
just to think it over so that
i could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city
whats there to think about
if its better to see clearly
or to be shortsighted is that it
thats absurd you know that
anyway this doctor is the best there is
and its really very difficult
to get an appointment
i called him months ago
to get him to see you today
shes blind
thank you
throw down your knife and stand up
why did you have to blind me
you could have blinded him
i have no idea what youre talking about
the drugs are messing with your head
if i were you i would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing
now get up and give me your knife
or ill hit you and take it by force
here i come
i swear im going to kill you
let go of my hair youre hurting me
just think that when someone goes blind
one of the other senses
is heightened
you could also catch a dog in the woods
and train it to guide you
dogs can do that you know
ill help you catch a dog myself
now calm down
or im going to leave you here
and i dont think youll manage
to find meeting point 2 on your own
are you enjoying the view
sure
what happened to your hand
i was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and i cut myself by accident
you look handsome today
did you get your hair cut
thank you
no i didnt get a haircut
im going to get my hair cut today
look what i brought you
oh thank you so much
im so hungry ill eat it right away
its a bigger flashlight
oh im sorry
its so big i thought it was a rabbit
the biggest flashlight ive ever seen
oh
are you ready for tonight
of course i am
i want to tell you something
but please dont be angry
ok whats wrong
i cant see anything
im blind
what do you mean
theres no point in lying to you
youll find out sooner or later
our leader blinded me in the city
she must have realised
that i love you and you love me
and that we were going to run away
to the city together
im sorry
you cant see at all
no not at all
and when you asked if id had my hair cut
i was just saying that
so you wouldnt realise that i cant see
im sorry
dont cry
crying will make your eyes hurt more
well find a way
what blood type are you
b
from the first time i saw her
i knew she was the one
as she stared in my eyes and smiled
and her lips were the colour of roses
that grew down the river
all bloody and wild
do you like berries
blueberries blackberries
no no
mm
can you play the piano
no
plastic cup
thats right very good
do you speak german
no
i could teach you german
but it would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics
not fluently so theres no point
you know german is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to learn
because its grammar is very complicated
i brought you something
its a fish
oh
on the second day i brought her a flower
she was more beautiful
than any woman id seen
and i said
do you know where the wild roses grow
so sweet and scarlet and free
kiwi
thats right ten out of ten again
can i give you a kiss
i cant thank you enough
for all the activities and games
and for keeping me company
but you know we cant do that any more
would you like to play another round of
touchguessthinkwin
no thats enough for today
in any case ive run out of things
to test you with
oh
maybe tomorrow
or one of these days
tomorrow morning
well see
bye
bye
good afternoon
how are you
fine
im hungry
you havent brought me a rabbit for days
or things for me to touch and guess
ive got good news
ive had a great idea
have you a minute
what kind of idea
i raise my left foot
i bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice
i bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times
i lie face down i kneel down
i touch my left cheek
and then lie face up
are you sure youre prepared to do that
yes of course im sure
i wouldnt propose it otherwise
when
tomorrow
tomorrow
we should speed up a little
i cant go much faster
the trousers are too tight im sorry
it was dark and i couldnt see clearly
and i didnt have time to try them on
im sorry

i i remember your belly very well
smile
