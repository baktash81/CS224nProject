you ll have to hurry up 
he decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear 
his back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past
when the pain was intolerable 
he was thinking his wife
didn t love him at all any more 
he didn t burst into tears and he didn t think
that the first thing people most people do
when they realise someone
doesn t love them anymore is cry 
sir  do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me 
that ll do  thank you 
have you ever been on your own before 
no  never 
are you allergic to any foods 
no 
your last relationship
lasted how many years 
around 12 
do you remember how long exactly  sir 
11 years and one month 
  sexual preference 
  women 
however  i had one homosexual
experience in the past 
in college 
is there a bisexual option available 
no  sir  this option is no longer available
since about last summer 
due to several operational problems 
i m afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered
as a homosexual or a heterosexual 
i think i should be registered
as a heterosexual 
  any children  sir 
  no 
and the dog 
my brother  he was here a couple of years
ago but he didn t make it 
you might remember him 
medium build  48 years old 
bald patch  blond hair 
i m afraid not  sir 
ok  i would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters 
and sign it  please 
that will do  thank you very much 
ok  so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts 
these are only for the couples 
you can use facilities for individual
sports  such as squash and golf 
you can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days 
you ll be staying in a single room 
if everything goes well and you make it 
you ll be moved to a double room 
i m afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings 
we will provide everything you need 
as far as garments  accessories
and shoes are concerned 
  you can keep this 
  thank you 
shoe size  please 
forty four and a half 
forty four of forty five 
there are no half sizes 
forty five 
if you need a haircut

smoking is not allowed 
that way you ll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired
and your breath won t smell when you kiss 
enjoy your stay 
excuse me  if we need to get a haircut 
we must call the reception the day before 
is that right 
  that s right 
  great 
his room number was 101 
a tranquiliser gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed 
on the table were 20 tranquiliser darts 
a black plastic watch 
a pair of sunglasses
and a cologne for men 
inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers 
four identical button down shirts
in white and blue 
a belt  socks  underwear  a blazer 
a striped tie and a white bathrobe 
he looked out the window 
the unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground 
 thank god they wear those
waterproof ponchos   he thought 
room 195 
two loners  two extra days 
room 272 
one loner  one extra day 
hello  i m the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner 
we d like to welcome you 
you re one of the lucky ones 
you have one of our superior rooms 
which means you have a view 
  did you read the leaflet 
  yes  i did 
very good  now the fact
that you ll turn into an animal
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here
is not something that should upset you 
or get you down 
just think as an animal you ll have
a second chance to find a companion 
but even then  you must be careful 
you need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you 
a wolf and a penguin
could never live together 
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus 
that would be absurd 
think about it 
i understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you 
but it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically 
for all possible outcomes 
now  have you thought of what animal
you d like to be if you end up alone 
  yes  a lobster 
  why a lobster 
because lobsters live for over 100 years 
are blue blooded like aristocrats
and stay fertile all their lives 
i also like the sea very much 
i water ski and swim quite well 
since i was a teenager 
i must congratulate you  the first thing
most people think of is a dog 
which is why the world is full of dogs 
very few people choose an unusual
animal  which is why they are endangered 
a lobster is an excellent choice 
could you stand for us  please 
this is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something
rather than just one 
we tend to forget that from time to time 
the handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow 
  it s alright  bob 
  i hope you enjoy your stay with us 
goodbye 
have a good day 
good morning 
room 101 
44 days left 
breakfast is served 
sit where you like 
his first day was one he d never forget 
near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back 
later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds 
next to her sat her best friend 
he thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee 
and thought about his wife for a moment 
a woman who seemed to like butter biscuits
offered one to a man drinking
a campari and soda for breakfast 
he then looked behind him and saw a woman
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless 
and some others in the couples area 
whom he d never meet
during his stay at the hotel 
that morning  he was really hungry 
he could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing 
  hello 
  hello 
i ve decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend 
let me introduce you  this is robert 
he stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp 
pleased to meet you 
i m staying in room 101 
i m on the same floor  i m 186 
  would you like to join us 
  why not 
one of these days  it s gonna be me
on one of those yachts 
what are those yachts 
it s the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one 
15 days of vacation  just a couple  alone 
  didn t you read the leaflet 
  i did 
have you seen john s leg 
no 
john  would you show your leg 
oh  yeah 
room 187  day two 
hello  everyone 
my mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman
who was better at math than she was 
she had a postgraduate degree  i think 
whereas my mother was only a graduate 
i was 19 at the time 
my mother entered the hotel but didn t
make it and was turned into a wolf 
i really missed her 
i found out she d been moved to a zoo 
i often went there to see her 
i d give her raw meat 
i knew that wolves liked raw meat 
but i couldn t figure out
which of the wolves was my mother 
so i used to give a little bit
to each of them 
one day  i decided to enter the enclosure
i really missed her and i wanted a hug 
i climbed the fence and jumped in 
all the wolves charged at once
and attacked me 
all but two  who stood motionless 
my guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother 
the zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital 
thankfully  i didn t lose my leg 
i just have this limp 
which is also my defining characteristic 
my wife died six days ago 
she was very beautiful
and i loved her very much 
she had a limp too 
thank you  john 
you can return to your seat now 
let s move on to our next guest 
room 104  day two 
hello  everyone 
this is only my second day here 
but already i feel like a member
of a wonderful group 
my defining characteristic
is that i have a very beautiful smile 
something s gotten hold of my heart
keeping my soul and my senses apart
something has gotten into my life
have you ever danced with anybody 
sorry 
have you ever danced with anybody 
yes 
what sort of dancing did you do 
just depends on the music 
do you need to sit down 
  no  no  no  i m getting ready to dance 
  ah 
in a time there was peace
with no trouble at all
can i sit here 
but then you came my way
sorry 
and a feeling inside shook my heart
made me want you to stay
all of my life
  can i sit here 
  of course 
let me introduce you to my best friend 
that woman you were talking to
has no feelings whatsoever 
she feels nothing at all 
she s the best hunter in the hotel 
silent and very fast 
she s the women s record holder 
192 captives 
changing the grey  changing the blue
scarlet for me  scarlet for you
would you like to dance 
every day
you touch me and my mind goes astray
and baby
and baby
something s gotten hold of my hand
dragging my soul to a beautiful land
something s gotten into my life
i m sorry  i ve got blood on your shirt 
but don t worry  there are many ways to
remove bloodstains from clothing 
one way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt 
another way is to scrub the stains
with cotton wool dipped in ammonia 
the third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste  like toothpaste 
especially if the clothes are delicate
or brightly coloured 
but just never use warm water
on blood  ever 
ok 
but then you  you  you
you
you came my way
but then you came my way
and a feeling i know shook my heart
made me want you to stay
all of my nights and all of my days
i think i have to rest for a little bit 
my leg s hurting 
that s ok 
well  let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again 
and my senses apart
something has invaded my night
painting my sleep with a colour so bright
changing the grey
changing the blue
scarlet for me
scarlet for you
leave the building in an orderly fashion 
do hurry up but please be careful 
nobody needs to get hurt or injured 
and good luck with the hunt 
i wish i didn t have this limp 
i used to be very good at running
but not any more 
i m sure i ll be slower than them 
if i were you  i d think of some tricks
that use the element of surprise
instead of speed 
you re right 
that s what i ll do 
room 186  one loner  one extra day 
38 days  stay left  plus one  39 
room 180 
the days of your stay remain unchanged 
room 290 
four loners  four extra days 
154 days left  plus four  158 
room 101 
the days of your stay remain unchanged 
32 days left 
breakfast is served 
man eats alone 
how many darts did you use yesterday 
12 
please take off your trousers
and sit on the bed 
can we not do this today  it s awful 
i know  but i m afraid we have to do it 
and you have no idea how much
it helps you psychologically
in your search for a partner 
man eats with woman 
lie down 
spread your legs  more 
  is your room number 186 
  yes  it is 
i imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted
in the rooms
or any other area of the hotel 
yes 
and yet it has brought to my attention
that you continue to do it 
today you became erect quicker
than on other days  that s good 
please  just a little longer 
have a good day 
that s awful  just awful 
were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating 
yes 
what did the photograph show 
a naked woman on a horse in the country 
if i were in your shoes  i would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse 
i m sure that the horse was once
a weak and cowardly man just like you 
woman walks alone 
help 
help 
help 
this is not necessary  please 
  it was an accident  i got carried away 
  please 
  this is not necessary 
  please place your hand in the toaster 
this could be a warning 
look  i ve been good otherwise  i   
i m sorry  i m sorry  please 
please  please  that s hurting 
woman walks with man 
what they do 
as soon as you enter the room 
is to wash your body
and your head really well 
how do you know 
my uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there 
no waiters know about the procedure 
they re not allowed inside that room 
nevertheless  they peel off the skin 
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap 
afterwards  they remove the heart 
the eyes and other vital organs of the body
with a laser or scalpels 
then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen 
that makes total sense 
i mean  i suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work
than fowls  for example 
exactly 
afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts
into the casks outside
the hotel s restaurant
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city 
why is that 
the blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available 
  new guests arrived yesterday 
  yes  i saw 
i think i saw a woman with a limp 
it s just a sprained ankle 
she ll be walking normally again
in a few days 
that s a shame 
that is a shame indeed 
one night on the coach  he sat next
to the woman who liked butter biscuits 
he gazed out of the window 
not looking at anything in particular 
just trying to avoid talking to her 
  how s bob 
  he s fine 
i d give anything to go for a walk
with you and bob one afternoon 
the dog s not allowed out of the room 
i m afraid 
 there are some excuses
that no one can argue with   he thought 
some excuses are without doubt
better than others 
and that was a really good one 
these biscuits are for bob 
i want you to give them to him
whenever you want to reward him
for something 
  tell him they re from me 
  thank you 
can i come to your room sometime
for a chat 
i could give you a blow job
or you could just fuck me 
i always swallow after fellatio and i ve
got absolutely no problem with anal sex
if that s your thing 
my ex husband always used to say i had
the most beautiful thighs he d ever seen 
but let s not talk about him 
my room number is 180 
so my telephone extension s 180 
hope i can catch some loners tonight 
i haven t caught any the last few nights 
hope you catch lots too 
thank you very much 
if i don t find a suitable partner soon 
i m gonna kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms 
out of the window 
i want you to know that 
my room is on the first floor 
 i hope i catch some
loners today   she said 
 and i hope you catch lots too  
she then told him that if she didn t find
a suitable partner soon 
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows 
320  maybe  or one higher up 
480  that would be even better 
when she stopped talking  he stared at her
blankly  not knowing what to say 
he then looked out at the woods
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been 
not bad  bit higher 
have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don t make it 
a lobster 
i m gonna be a parrot if i don t make it 
why don t you become parrots too 
and then we ll all be together 
you re a complete idiot 
picking one of the few animals
that can talk
when you have a speech impediment 
you ll lisp  even as an animal 
as for you  they ll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die 
and then they ll crack open your claws
with a tool  like pliers 
and they ll suck out what little flesh
you have with their mouths 
you re pathetic  both of you 
i m not gonna be turned into some animal 
i ll come and visit you  though 
with my partner 
when we re walking together in some park
or when we re swimming in the sea 
or when we re on one of our trips 
friends 
i m not afraid 
room 187  please 
it s no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples 
hello 
  hello 
  your swimsuit is very nice 
thank 
  thank you very much 
  you re welcome 
do you like to swim breaststroke 
front crawl  butterfly or backstroke 
i like all strokes equally 
you know  i love breaststroke 
no  really 
my friends often tease me and say 
 stop swimming breaststroke all the time  
and then they laugh 
breaststroke is great 
it s excellent exercise for the back 
when swimming breaststroke 
men shouldn t wear swim shorts 
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks 
  but you knew that  didn t you 
  i think your nose is bleeding 
really 
ah  no 
this happens to me all the time 
it s really  really annoying 
i know  i have a nosebleed problem too 
i saw what you did  it must have hurt 
is it coming out 
no 
  yes 
  can i use a tissue 
yes 
i m gonna ask you a question
and i want you to answer me honestly 
what s worse 
to die of cold and hunger in the woods 
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal
or to have a nosebleed from time to time 
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal 
  exactly 
  mm 
  she doesn t suspect that you re lying 
  no 
i m very happy
because we have a new couple 
they met just two days ago but they re
very much in love and perfectly suited 
they both have the same problem with
their noses  they bleed quite suddenly 
tomorrow they ll be transferred
to a double room
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom 
they will remain in the double room
for two weeks 
and then they ll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks 
we wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple 
  i m very happy 
  me  too 
congratulations 
the course of your relationship
will be monitored closely
by our staff and by me personally 
if you encounter any problems 
any tensions  any arguing 
that you cannot resolve yourselves 
you will be assigned children 
that usually helps  a lot 
good morning  room 101 
seven days left 
breakfast is served 
you have really nice hair 
i know 
look 
how do you like mine 
well  i think you have quite dry hair 
the colour is ok  though 
the most important thing
is that you re not bald 
however  when it comes to men  baldness
is always a possibility you can t avoid 
  is your father bald 
  no  he isn t 
and even if someday i lose my hair  there
are things i can do to get my hair back 
i can have a hair transplant 
  you can always tell when someone s
had a hair transplant    i know 
nice hair is not something you can get 
it s something you re born with 
and the fact that your father isn t bald
shouldn t put you at ease 
have you decided what
you re going to do on your last day 
i m still thinking about it 
morning  ladies 
so today is your last day 
and as is customary  you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night 
what i always say in these situations is 
it would be wise to choose
something you can t do as an animal   
for example 
read a work of classic literature
or sing a song you really like 
it would be silly to choose
for example a walk in the grounds 
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person 
because those are things
you can do as an animal 
but first your best friend has written
something she d like to read to you 
which is really very touching 
 we always sat together at school 
and whenever i had a problem 
i talked to you about it
because you always gave the best advice 
when we didn t manage to find
dance partners at the school prom 
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength 
i m sorry that things have come to this 
i m sure that if you had a few more days 
you would find someone  just like i did 
because you re an admirable person 
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts 
i was always jealous of your hair 
you know that 
you were  are  and always will be
my best friend and i ll think of you often 
and i ll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday 
i ll miss you 
and however many new girlfriends i make
in a few days when i move back into the city 
i don t think i ll find another as true  
i d like to watch the film stand by me 
with river phoenix  kiefer sutherland
and richard dreyfus  alone 
excellent choice 
lovely film 
please leave a message 
hello  you re probably in the bathroom 
that s why you can t hear the phone ring 
nothing like a cold shower in the morning 
well  i ll call you a little bit later 
after you ve finished your shower 
we ll talk later 
bye 
one day  as he was playing golf 
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend
that you do have feelings when you don t
than to pretend you don t have feelings
when you do 
he also thought that he liked her accent 
and he d always preferred women
with short hair 
so he decided that she was the one 
during the hunt  he would follow her 
and as soon as she shot a loner 
he would say to her 
 i wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones 
why don t you kill him
with your bare hands  
and the moment she puts her hands
around the loner s throat  he would say 
 i hope he dies right away  
did anyone see what happened 
what happened 
she jumped from the window of room 180 
there s blood and biscuits everywhere 
i hope she dies right away 
on second thoughts
i hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies 
i just hope her pathetic screams
can t be heard from my room 
because i was thinking about having
a lie down and i need peace and quiet 
i was playing golf and i m quite tired 
the last thing i need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly 
i can t hear you with all this screaming 
we ll talk some other time
when it s quieter 
goodbye 
goodbye 
one message 
hello  you re probably in the bathroom 
that s why you can t hear the phone ring 
nothing like a cold shower in the morning 
well  i ll call you a little bit later 
after you ve finished your shower 
we ll talk later 
bye 
mind if i join you 
martini 
i think we are a match 
yes  i think so too 
the keys to the double room  please 
i wish you the best of luck 
we all wish you the best of luck 
do you normally sleep on the left
side of the bed or the right 
  the right  you 
  the left 
perfect 
spread your legs 
should i turn off the light
or would you like to read 
i d like to read 
does the light bother you 
no 
i m not bothered by light or noise 
i m a deep sleeper 
  hello 
  hello 
congratulations 
  thank you 
  this is our new daughter 
her name s elizabeth 
elizabeth  give the nice man a kiss 
he s a friend of mine 
the last thing i want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl 
come on  move away 
don t cry  elizabeth  you should thank me 
now you ll have a limp
and be more like your father 
what was that sound 
did you say something 
no 
do you mind if we fuck in a position
where i can see your face 
sure 
turn the light on please 
so i can see you better 
good morning 
morning 
i killed your brother 
i left him to die very slowly 
he may not be dead yet even as we speak 
i was kicking him for ages 
doesn t matter 
he whined a little 
a strange kind of bark 
something like this 
it must have been from the pain 
  you didn t hear anything 
  no 
you really are a deep sleeper 
  would you like some coffee 
  i d love some 
as soon as i wash my face
and brush my teeth  though 
i can t wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night 
about that student
of yours at the university
and his awful final project 
it s really a very funny story 
his name was ryess   
r y e s s  ryess 
these aren t tears  it s just water 
i just washed my face 
i knew you were lying 
i can t understand why you did it 
when you know as well as anyone
that a relationship cannot be built on a lie 
we re going to the hotel manager right now
and you ll get the punishment you deserve 
what s the punishment for this 
they turn you into the animal
no one wants to be 
i saw your partner running back that way 
he looked frantic 
is everything ok 
at first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way 
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother 
take her legs  please 
he thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again 
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach 
but then he thought
there wouldn t be much point 
because she was already unconscious
and wouldn t feel any pain
from the kicks  or the knife 
you have to shoot me
so they won t suspect i helped you 
a hotel maid helped him 
he couldn t understand why she did it 
so he decided to turn her into an animal 
he dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place 
i asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into 
but he always gave me the same answer 
 that s none of your concern  
that night  he left the hotel
once and for all 
he began to run without knowing
where he was headed 
but he was headed towards us 
this was the start of his new life 
and back then  he didn t know
how much it hurts to be alone 
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain relief ointment on your back 
and you are constantly in pain 
i found him in the woods 
he escaped from the hotel 
are you a doctor  by any chance 
  no 
  that s a pity 
we need a doctor around 
we had one  but they caught him
a couple of months ago 
i m an architect 
that s ok 
so  welcome 
you can stay with us
for as long as you like 
you can be a loner until the day you die 
there is no time limit 
thank you very much 
by the way 
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted 
and any such acts are punished 
is that clear 
can i have a conversation with someone 
of course you can 
so as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that 
that applies to dance nights as well 
we all dance by ourselves 
that s why we only play electronic music 
what happened to your mouth 
he can t speak  he was given the red kiss 
what s the red kiss 
we slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner 
and we forced them to kiss each other 
that was a couple of days ago now 
but the cuts were deep and they re still
in pain  they were flirting  you know 
some punishments are worse
than other punishments 
having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved 
and having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit
is worse than having your leg kicked 
the punishment i am afraid of
isn t the red kiss but another one 
that is called the red intercourse 
i have never seen it happen  but it s
not difficult to imagine what it means 
oh  my god  i am so afraid of it 
move 
hide 
move 
hide 
that was the first time i saw him 
he was hiding behind a tree close to mine 
he seemed quite presentable 
the next day  in the city 
he found out that i was short sighted too 
that night in my sleep 
i dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city 
with a large well lit kitchen 
and i was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse 
and he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse 
and as he was fucking me 
a thug came into the kitchen 
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us 
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one 
i woke up terrified 
try harder 
don t give up  you know you should
have been more careful 
try harder or they ll find you and you ll
be turned into an animal    a weak one 
we must get a move on now 
it s really too dangerous to stay here 
if you manage to free yourself 
run as fast as you can and come find us 
if you manage to free yourself
but think you ll die from the bleeding 
go straight to your grave 
have you dug your own grave 
yes 
very good 
that s enough for now 
i m going to go hunting for truffles 
they re delicious and quite rare 
a kilo can fetch a lot of money 
you re going to need a pig 
they re impossible to find otherwise 
  i know 
  don t be long 
  gotta get them back in 50 minutes 
  ok 
hello  david 
hello  robert 
what you did to that woman was dreadful 
she killed my brother 
i would have done the same thing
if she d killed you 
you re like a brother to me  oh 
you re my best friend in the whole world 
i don t think i m your best friend
in the whole world 
you used to spend much more time
with john 
oh  who s john 
  john  the limping man 
  oh  yeah 
i didn t even remember his name 
or his face 
you re the one i think of
whenever i need a friend 
nevertheless  did john make it 
they re getting ready for the yacht 
it all begins this week 
everyone says they re gonna make it
as they re perfectly suited
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing 
  that s great 
  you re not thinking about coming back 
you know  if you told the hotel manager
about your brother 
she d probably forgive you 
no  it s really nice to be on your own 
there s no one tying you down 
you listen to music whenever you like 
you masturbate whenever you want 
go for walks whenever you like 
have a chat whenever you like 
i don t miss companionship at all 
i just miss you 
 cause you were my one true friend 
are you gonna shoot me 
i m afraid so 
i only have two days left 
what did you say 
i can t understand the way you speak 
i m going to shoot you  i only
have two days left  i need more time 
do you actually believe another day
will make a difference 
have you seen how ugly you are 
you haven t got a chance 
if i was a woman   
don t tell anyone i helped you 
if you want to repay me  there is a way 
if you kill a rabbit 
bring it to me to eat 
do you promise 
  yes 
  bye 
bye 
you carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head 
you then slice open its belly and stuff it
with well washed red and green peppers 
not too spicy 
and a little garlic and mint 
you then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour 
that s my favourite food

i would never dream of leaving my wife 
even if it was just the two of us

as soon as his last patient left 
i entered his office and i said to him 
 honey  the dinner s ready 
however  i m not sure i can eat right now 
one of my front teeth hurts a lot 
can you take a look please  dear  
 yes  sure  no problem   he said 
and the minute he turned his head  i took
the drill and i shoved it into his chest 
that story sounds really interesting
but i have to leave 
i just remembered i left some batteries
next to a tree down there 
and the last thing i want is to lose them 
sorry 
did you catch rabbits 
  no  someone brought me them 
  who 
a friend of mine 
  do you want one 
  no 
you don t need to accept rabbits
from other people 
if you need more rabbits  just ask 
and i ll bring you more 
catching a rabbit is difficult 
but i ll try to do better 
there s no need for you
to be indebted to the others 
thank you very much 
the man who brought you the rabbits 
is he short sighted 
i don t know  i don t think so 
ok 
is that a sparrow up in that tree 
i can t really see that far 
but i don t think so 
  are you short sighted 
  no 
you re lying 
it s the truth 
what does it say here 
ykk 
you knew that already 
all zips say the same thing 
i m not short sighted 
i don t understand
why you won t believe me 
i can see really clearly 
i used to be a pilot 
you re wearing contact lenses 
i don t wear contact lenses 
i m not short sighted  i swear 
you are  you think
i m an idiot and can t tell 
let me see 
let me see  i want to see your eyes 
look up 
look up 
up  up 
look down now 
look left 
look right 
up again 
i m sorry 
i thought you were trying to fool me 
i m sorry 
for this synchronisation exercise 
we have to fully concentrate 
as we both have to press  play 
at exactly the same time 
why don t we just use one headset 
because that s the whole point 
this is an exercise for us 
we have to be totally synchronised 
ok 
  i m ready 
  ok 
five  four  three 
two 
if i show you the roses will you follow 
they call me the wild rose
but my name is elisa day
we ve developed a code so that we
can communicate with each other 
even in front of the others 
without them knowing what we are saying 
when we turn our heads to the left 
it means 
 i love you more
than anything in the world  
and when we turn our heads to the right 
it means 
 watch out  we re in danger  
we had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up
 i love you more than anything in the world 
with  watch out  we re in danger  
when we raise our left arm  it means 
 i want to dance in your arms  
when we make a fist and put it
behind our backs  it means 
 let s fuck  
the code grew and grew as time went by 
and within a few weeks 
we could talk about almost anything
without even opening our mouths 
stop it 
that s enough 
show my parents some respect 
they are playing you music 
  that s ok 
  no  mother  it is not ok 
please continue 
do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else 
something else 
didn t her parents play beautifully 
yes  they did 
it was wonderful 
we love each other and we suit each other 
and that s the reason
why we ve decided to leave the woods
and stay together forever in the city 
tomorrow during the hunt 
we re going to disappear
and everyone will think we ve been captured 
and that we re going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something 
i think the first thing i m going to do
when i get into the city
is buy a bathrobe 
and then we ll go to a pool with a high
diving board  perfect for diving 
 and we ll do
lots of different things together 
serious things  not silly ones 
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together  
 portofino  italian fishing village
and upmarket resort 
famous for its picturesque harbour 
population  439 
beaches nearby 
paraggi beach  camogli 
chiavari and lavagna 
serifos  greek island located
in the western cyclades  
can you imagine why i brought you
to such a quiet place today 
no 
because i think it s the perfect spot
for your grave 
now cover yourself with soil 
use you hands 
over your face too 
you wouldn t want your face to get
eaten by dogs  would you 
if you die before me 
i ll visit you as often as i can 
i promise 
i think we should leave right now 
the three of us coming here instead of
two or four is very dangerous 
why didn t we think of that earlier 
highly likely the doctor will suspect us 
i suggest that we leave
the first chance we get 
right now  in fact 
don t be afraid 
no one will suspect a thing 
i bet you weren t expecting this surprise 
  isn t it wonderful 
  yes  it is 
still  i d like a few days
just to think it over  so that
i could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city 
what s there to think about 
if it s better to see clearly
or to be short sighted  is that it 
that s absurd  you know that 
anyway  this doctor is the best there is 
and it s really very difficult
to get an appointment 
i called him months ago
to get him to see you today 
she s blind 
thank you 
throw down your knife and stand up 
why did you have to blind me 
you could have blinded him 
i have no idea what you re talking about 
the drugs are messing with your head 
if i were you  i would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing 
now get up and give me your knife
or i ll hit you and take it by force 
  here i come 
  i swear i m going to kill you 
let go of my hair  you re hurting me 
just think  that when someone goes blind
one of the other senses
is heightened 
you could also catch a dog in the woods
and train it to guide you 
dogs can do that  you know 
i ll help you catch a dog myself 
now calm down 
or i m going to leave you here
and i don t think you ll manage
to find meeting point 2 on your own 
are you enjoying the view 
sure 
what happened to your hand 
i was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and i cut myself by accident 
you look handsome today 
did you get your hair cut 
thank you 
no  i didn t get a haircut 
i m going to get my hair cut today 
look what i brought you 
oh  thank you so much 
i m so hungry  i ll eat it right away 
it s a bigger flashlight 
oh  i m sorry 
it s so big  i thought it was a rabbit 
the biggest flashlight i ve ever seen 
oh 
are you ready for tonight 
of course i am 
i want to tell you something
but please don t be angry 
ok  what s wrong 
i can t see anything 
i m blind 
what do you mean 
there s no point in lying to you 
you ll find out sooner or later 
our leader blinded me in the city 
she must have realised
that i love you and you love me
and that we were going to run away
to the city together 
i m sorry 
you can t see at all 
no  not at all 
and when you asked if i d had my hair cut 
i was just saying that
so you wouldn t realise that i can t see 
i m sorry 
don t cry 
crying will make your eyes hurt more 
we ll find a way 
what blood type are you 
b 
from the first time i saw her 
i knew she was the one
as she stared in my eyes and smiled
and her lips were the colour of roses
that grew down the river
all bloody and wild
do you like berries 
blueberries  blackberries 
  no  no 
  mm 
can you play the piano 
no 
plastic cup 
that s right  very good 
do you speak german 
no 
i could teach you german 
but it would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics 
not fluently  so there s no point 
you know  german is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to learn 
because its grammar is very complicated 
i brought you something 
it s a fish 
oh 
on the second day  i brought her a flower
she was more beautiful
than any woman i d seen
and i said 
do you know where the wild roses grow
so sweet and scarlet and free
kiwi 
that s right  ten out of ten again 
can i give you a kiss 
i can t thank you enough
for all the activities and games
and for keeping me company 
but you know we can t do that any more 
would you like to play another round of
touch guess think win 
no  that s enough for today 
in any case  i ve run out of things
to test you with 
oh 
maybe tomorrow
or one of these days 
tomorrow morning 
we ll see 
  bye 
  bye 
good afternoon 
how are you 
fine 
i m hungry 
you haven t brought me a rabbit for days 
or things for me to touch and guess 
i ve got good news 
i ve had a great idea 
have you a minute 
what kind of idea 
i raise my left foot 
i bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice 
i bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times 
i lie face down  i kneel down 
i touch my left cheek
and then lie face up 
are you sure you re prepared to do that 
yes  of course i m sure 
i wouldn t propose it otherwise 
when 
tomorrow 
tomorrow 
we should speed up a little 
i can t go much faster 
the trousers are too tight  i m sorry 
it was dark and i couldn t see clearly 
and i didn t have time to try them on 
i m sorry 
never mind 
there s a bus coming 
it was the hotel coach 
they didn t see us 
profile 
fingers 
elbows 
would you like me to show you my belly 
no 
i    i remember your belly very well 
smile 
can i have a knife and fork  please 
not a butter knife  a steak knife 
certainly 
thank you 
i m going to do it with a knife 
do you want me to come with you 
i d rather you didn t 
don t worry 
it s strange at first 
but then you get used to it
