 cassietta george s
 no never alone  playing 
  i ve seen
the lightning flashing  
  i ve heard the thunder roar  
announcer 
it s been ten years
since george foreman
set foot in a boxing ring 
what does this foreman
reincarnation even look like 
hey  zouski s no world champion 
but he s a seasoned fighter 
and george has danger
in there tonight 
you know what scares me
the most about tonight 
getting knocked out by a bum 
george 
no 
taking my robe off
in front of all these people 
the last time they saw me 
i looked like superman 
so now you look
like the michelin man 
this ain t no beauty contest 
  no never alone  
all right 
whoo 
ref 
gentlemen 
in the dressing room 
obey my commands 
give me a good clean fight  george   
don t look at him 
he s trying
to mess with your mind 
touch them up 
come on  let s go 
announcer 
so george foreman begins
all right  george 
keep your hands up 
keep your hands up 
 crowd booing 
this sacramento crowd
is getting restless 
quit dancing 
they re looking for some action 
stop playing with him 
you come here to fight
or you wanna go home  come on 
let s do this  let s fight 
you wanna fight 
there it is 
 bell rings 
oh  cheap shot after the bell 
 booing 
let him out

i m gonna do it my way 
 booing 
i ll tell you this

announcer

that s enough  that s enough 
announcer  and it s done 
the ref has seen enough 
 bell rings 
foreman takes his first step
back with a big win 
let s hear it
for fat  old  bald guys  huh 
yeah  go get them  george 
anchor 
that rumble you hear
is the george foreman
comeback express 
you best believe it s picking
up some serious steam 
there s an old saying 
 it s not the size
of the man in the fight 
but the size of the fight
in the man  
all those ring experts who were
making fun of george s size
sure aren t laughing anymore 
foreman is forcing
the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention 
never before has a boxer
stayed away from the ring
this long 
then fought his way
back into contention 
just how far 
how high can he take this 
 beeping 
host 
back tonight  please welcome
former heavyweight champion
of the world 
george foreman 
good to see you  george 
good to see you 
now  tell me  george 
all these guys
you ve been fighting 
where do you find them 
gas stations  barrooms 
and bowling alleys  mostly 
 audience laughs 
sounds like
pretty stiff competition 
oh  yeah 
but i m tired of people saying
i ll only fight these guys
unless they on respirators 
 cause that s a lie 
they gotta be off the respirator
at least five days
before i fight them 
 audience laughs 
now  tell us about your sons  george 
i got four boys 
now  the names are  again    
george foreman jr  
george foreman iii 
george foreman iv 
and george foreman v 
i wanted them all
to have something in common 
no different names 
if one goes up  we all go up 
if one gets in trouble 
we all get in trouble 
how about that 
mm hm 
you re going to fight
evander holyfield
in atlantic city  right 
yes 
it is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship
belt again 
it is time  kids 
okay  all right  here we go 
announcer 
and we re back
holyfield  as expected 
is well ahead on the cards 
your will  lord 
and he rocks foreman again
with a vicious left 
mm 
george is still standing 
but for how long 
whoa  it s foreman
on the attack now 
that s it  george 
what a shot 
holyfield is wobbly 
solid punches 
nobody thought
foreman would even last
this long 
get him 
a round for the ages 
george foreman is for real 
and the crowd is up on its feet 
117 to 100  for the winner
by unanimous decision 
and still undisputed
heavyweight champion
of the world 
evander holyfield 
mr  foreman 
great fight 
one more round
and you would have had him 
thank you 
 applause 
have a seat 
good morning 
what brings you in today 
i just wanna stay
on top of things this time 
did the hbo check come in 
just this morning 
they said they were hoping to
just break even on the fight 
what 
 laughs 
i think you ll enjoy
the rest of your statement too 
that funny little grill deal
you signed
is starting to generate
some substantial checks 
really 
i m just surprised they chose
a big  old fat guy like me
to sell a grill
to help people get lean 
the youth center 
there s enough money
in the account
to keep it open
a very long time 
i think it s safe to say you
never have to fight again 
mr  foreman 
oh  praise the lord 
what is it 
our job isn t over 
maybe i heard him wrong  george 
mm mm 
you heard him right 
your vision   
it was real 
he did his part 
we have to do ours 
announcer 
the fight is on 
three years after he lost
to evander holyfield 
big george foreman 
who s now 45 years old 
has fought his way
back to a title fight 
but he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for 
michael moorer  the newly minted
heavyweight champion
of the world 
a new champion  in his prime 
with speed  power 
and a fluid arsenal 
thirty of moorer s 35 wins
have come by knockout 
he is very difficult to fight 
the first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history 
and he boasts a win
over evander holyfield 
who battered big george 
there has never been
a 45 year old heavyweight champion 
the risk here to george foreman
isn t losing 
it s surviving 
how can you beat that man 
get out of the pocket 
come on  now 
looks like the myth
of george foreman s power
is being exposed
by moorer so far 
come on  son 
what are you doing 
solid right hand by moorer 
foreman s taking a beating 
way behind on every scorecard 
every time george lands
something significant 
moorer comes back with two
or three punches of his own 
he s having a difficult time
with the younger
and faster fighter 
george has no timing 
he s very slow and sluggish 
i thought he d be sharper
than this 
moorer s cutting up george
like a turkey 
our guy s got nothing left 
easy  easy 
jim 
foreman s left eye
gil 
well  now he just looks
he deserves all the credit
in the world 
but he is a 45 year old man
in a young man s game 
jim 
uppercut by moorer 
oh  god  protect him 
 heartbeat thumping 
george 
i ve been fighting
for a long time 
i fought because i felt
hated by the world 
poor man 
 jeering 
i call it
the  ghetto whopper  
i will fight george foreman
anywhere  any time 
but i ve changed 
nine rounds against the best
in the world 
there s no shame  son 
no shame 
he s all right 
he s all right 
you okay 
spectator 
come on  george  come on 
 bell rings 
george 
i had to get knocked down
to finally see   
everything i was searching for
was already there 
and with that   
you can do the impossible 
jim 
down goes moorer
an unbelievably close in 
right hand shot 
 cheering wildly 
i don t believe it 
it happened 
five  six 
stay down  stay down  seven 
eight  nine  ten 
it happened 
george foreman is the new
heavyweight champ of the world 
the boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees 
not in defeat  but in victory
and thanksgiving 
thank you 
no  thank you 
you re the heavyweight champion
of the world 
we did it 
we did it 
we did it 
we did it 
 both laughing 
we did it 
 crowd cheering 
jim 
i have never seen
in the 25 years
of my career  gil 
gil 
oldest heavyweight champion
