yeah go get them george
anchor
that rumble you hear
is the george foreman
comeback express
you best believe its picking
up some serious steam
theres an old saying
its not the size
of the man in the fight
but the size of the fight
in the man
all those ring experts who were
making fun of georges size
sure arent laughing anymore
foreman is forcing
the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention
never before has a boxer
stayed away from the ring
this long
then fought his way
back into contention
just how far
how high can he take this
beeping
host
back tonight please welcome
former heavyweight champion
of the world
george foreman
good to see you george
good to see you
now tell me george
all these guys
youve been fighting
where do you find them
gas stations barrooms
and bowling alleys mostly
audience laughs
sounds like
pretty stiff competition
oh yeah
but im tired of people saying
ill only fight these guys
unless they on respirators
cause thats a lie
they gotta be off the respirator
at least five days
before i fight them
audience laughs
now tell us about your sons george
i got four boys
now the names are again
george foreman jr
george foreman iii
george foreman iv
and george foreman v
i wanted them all
to have something in common
no different names
if one goes up we all go up
if one gets in trouble
we all get in trouble
how about that
mmhm
youre going to fight
evander holyfield
in atlantic city right
yes
it is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship
belt again
it is time kids
okay all right here we go
announcer
and were back
holyfield as expected
is well ahead on the cards
your will lord
and he rocks foreman again
with a vicious left
mm
george is still standing
but for how long
whoa its foreman
on the attack now
thats it george
what a shot
holyfield is wobbly
solid punches
nobody thought
foreman would even last
this long
get him
a round for the ages
george foreman is for real
and the crowd is up on its feet
117 to 100 for the winner
by unanimous decision
and still undisputed
heavyweight champion
of the world
evander holyfield
mr foreman
great fight
one more round
and you would have had him
thank you
applause
have a seat
good morning
what brings you in today
i just wanna stay
on top of things this time
did the hbo check come in
just this morning
they said they were hoping to
just break even on the fight
what
laughs
i think youll enjoy
the rest of your statement too
that funny little grill deal
you signed
is starting to generate
some substantial checks
really
im just surprised they chose
a big old fat guy like me
to sell a grill
to help people get lean
the youth center
theres enough money
in the account
to keep it open
a very long time
i think its safe to say you
never have to fight again
mr foreman
oh praise the lord
what is it
our job isnt over
maybe i heard him wrong george
mmmm
you heard him right
your vision
it was real
he did his part
we have to do ours
announcer
the fight is on
three years after he lost
to evander holyfield
big george foreman
whos now 45 years old
has fought his way
back to a title fight
but he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for
michael moorer the newlyminted
heavyweight champion
of the world
a new champion in his prime
with speed power
and a fluid arsenal
thirty of moorers 35 wins
have come by knockout
he is very difficult to fight
the first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history
and he boasts a win
over evander holyfield
who battered big george
there has never been
a 45yearold heavyweight champion
the risk here to george foreman
isnt losing
its surviving
how can you beat that man
get out of the pocket
come on now
looks like the myth
of george foremans power
is being exposed
by moorer so far
come on son
what are you doing
solid right hand by moorer
foremans taking a beating
way behind on every scorecard
every time george lands
something significant
moorer comes back with two
or three punches of his own
hes having a difficult time
with the younger
and faster fighter
george has no timing
hes very slow and sluggish
i thought hed be sharper
than this
moorers cutting up george
like a turkey
our guys got nothing left
easy easy
jim
foremans left eye
gil
well now he just looks
he deserves all the credit
in the world
but he is a 45yearold man
in a young mans game
jim
uppercut by moorer
oh god protect him
heartbeat thumping
george
ive been fighting
for a long time
i fought because i felt
hated by the world
poorman
jeering
i call it
the ghetto whopper
i will fight george foreman
anywhere any time
but ive changed
nine rounds against the best
in the world
theres no shame son
no shame
hes all right
hes all right
you okay
spectator
come on george come on
bell rings
george
i had to get knocked down
to finally see
everything i was searching for
was already there
and with that
you can do the impossible
jim
down goes moorer
an unbelievably closein
righthand shot
cheering wildly
i dont believe it
it happened
five six
stay down stay down seven
eight nine ten
it happened
george foreman is the new
heavyweight champ of the world
the boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees
