it s being called
the party of the century   
but it may be the biggest ever 
no one s seen preparations
like this   
but preparations
require care and insurance   
and the lapd
is one insurance company   
that doesn t want accidents 
put you on a reservation
black nation
die under your step
and fetch a military lie   
the bodies of two men found
under the hollywood freeway   
have been identified
as rap starjeriko one   
and band memberjames polton 
known to fans as replay 
both were shot in what police
are characterizing   
as an execution style killing 
the body
of an unidentified woman   
was found with them 
also shot numerous times 
police said the killings
appear to be gang related 
with his band 
prophets of light   
jeriko one s outspoken political
stance and violent lyrics   
have stirred nationwide
controversy 
meanwhile 
astrologers have been busy   
making predictions
for the coming century 
some of their fortune telling
is indeed incredible   
muammar qaddafi will be awarded
the nobel peace prize 
turkey will make
reparations to armenia 
by 2025 there will be
a second woman president

why wasn t jeriko one
provided adequate security 
he always had adequate
security available to him 
he chose not to have
those encumbrances in his life 
why s he a scumbag 
you know who left lenny for him 
  faith left lenny for him 
  don t say faith 
use the  f  word around lenny 
it triggers a maudlin display   
and you gotta tranquilize him

not on you 
that s a good one
coming from you 
why don t you just split

of possession 
you re like a ferrari

i know i will 
it s you
up on that stage  not him 
you don t need him 
you have to get out of here 
if philo catches you 
he s gonna hurt you

about the wearer 
  that guy is fucked up 
  we know that

some kind of distortion   
in the visual cortex 
the color and gray scale values
are all messed up 
like color blindness 
see the peak period ratios 
there could be some kind
of tumor or brain lesion 
whoever s doing this is using
a box to split the signal   
you ever make a box like that 
yeah  but i can t see the gear
well enough to see if it s mine 
i don t like this 
  this is not good 
  what

iris was here 
the other night 
shaking like a junkie   
saying she wanted me
to copy some clip 
  what was it 
  she wouldn t let me see 
she was going to give it
to you to hold for her   
like insurance or something 
  she never gave me a tape 
  think back to what she said 
she came in crying 
she wanted to go to my car 
can we go to your car 
you have to see something 
  something about my car 
  in your car

attitude adjuster

i just want to get my car back 
the place is closed 
shut the fuck up
