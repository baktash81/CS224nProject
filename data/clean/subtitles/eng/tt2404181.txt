i am here to take
you to a good life
a life that you were born to
here
elizabeth murray bring yourself
back here this very moment
her mother is dead
i beg you uncle love her
as i would were i here
and ensure that she is in receipt
of all that is due to
her as a child of mine
that is simply impossible
what is right can
never be impossible
she is black
she is my blood
but she is black
a detail you chose not
to share with us
in a few hours i am to captain a voyage
to the indies on a longitude experiment
after that who knows
it is not in my gift to question
the king and his royal navy
do you have in mind my
position my reputation
sir
i am the lord chief justice
have some sense of propriety boy and
understand what it is you are asking
she is a mulatto
what has she been named
she is belle after her mother
dido elizabeth belle lindsay
she takes your name
i am not ashamed
we will call her dido
good lord she is thin
mary find her some food
sweet child
a ship is
no place for one so
precious as you
in these walls
yours will be a life
equal to my blood
and you will not understand
in this moment
but know in your
heart you are loved
just as i loved your mother
are you what they call a negro
i heard them talking
questions elizabeth a most irritating
trait you share with your father
papa m
no your birth papa
sir david murray
you should not always insist on
speaking your mind you know
youll end up an old maid with only
your own company as entertainment
like you aunt mary
thats what the maids say
oh you little
just wait till i catch you
elizabeth come back
here this moment
theres one of me too
would you like to see it
william murray
1st earl of mansfield
now
this is my nephew
do you understand
its your uncle
sir david murray
elizabeths papa
yes thats right
youre very sharp
7th viscount stormont
who will inherit
everything we are standing on
when i am gone
born on english soil
indeed
he discovered her mother aboard
a captured spanish slave ship
so now we have 2 nieces
in our guardianship
well elizabeth was in
much need of a companion
and that is what we shall say
when questions are asked
we shall say that in accordance
with her birthright
she is entitled to live
beneath this roof
that is the nature of order
and where in that order
should her color be placed
above or below her
murray bloodline
marriage
impossible
any match her other origins
would attract would
surely disgrace her and
the familys rank
and when we are no longer here
no husband who will
take care of her then
ring a ring o roses
a pocket full of posies
atishoo atishoo we all fall down
girls
will you refrain from shrieking
like the blessed french
i have no experience in the ways
of breaking grave news to you
i had thought i should one day
have the opportunity to make
his better acquaintance
yes
yes i know
2000 a year
then you are an heiress
he has left you your fortune
my fathers new wife wishes him
to leave me not a thing
and he obliges her
i think he might have loved
me more if mama had not died
i think love must be a
very complicated thing
with such a dowry
you may marry into any
good family you wish
we shall be receiving
visitors for dinner
visitors whoever bothers
to visit us here
or leave except the dead
once again dido
beds aunt mary
we should prepare some extra beds
in case our visitors are to stay
may we wear the new silk
i will do your hair bette
say we may wear them aunt mary
you will not be
dining with us dido
of course
but i may join after
dinner may i not
yes such are the rules
and you know them well
papa how may i be too high in
rank to dine with the servants
and too low to dine with my family
dinner with guests is a
formal proceeding dido
we simply cant impose upon visitors
our disregard of those formalities
but am i not wealthy now
an heiress surely
that changes matters
oh my dear if it were so simple
finance may go some way but
society has a habit of disregarding
even one of its own
when opportunity provides
but after dinner
when formality is of
less consequence
well
your presence can raise
no defendable objections
as you wish sir
i would rather dine with dido
what a great pity our young gentlemen
guests will miss you elizabeth
young gentlemen
very good connections
and most agreeable by all accounts
now close your mouth
and understand
there shall be no discussion tonight
in any language but english
no whispering in gentlemens
ears not in latin italian
and certainly not in french
i must say the entire
country barely breathes
awaiting your judgment
on the zong appeal
terrified you will destroy
england no doubt
i know lord ashford is
he does wonder however what
might be taking you so long
the law lady ashford it is to be
interpreted not merely administered
your husband of all
people knows this
oh what a lot of
fuss over dead cargo
it is a fuss over the
bread and butter of
a great many people in this
country lady ashford
why what wonderful french
though i have not an
idea of what you said
wimbridge
miss lindsay
there are poachers wandering
good evening to you uh
my name is john davinier
i believe i may have disturbed a lady
of this house ah there she is
please forgive me
though you barely
sir i do not believe we
have been introduced
indeed
please inform the lady of my
apologies for startling her
i took a shortcut to deliver this
to lord mansfield from my father
sir
reverend davinier
i will see that he
gets it immediately
you shall not interrupt
him at dinner
immediately after dinner sir
goodnight
goodnight sir
dido my dear
papa
good lord its the negro
she really is
a lady
capital
i had no idea she
would be so black
did you not listen to the rumors
when you were spreading them mama
may i present the second of my
two nieces miss dido lindsay
a pleasure miss lindsay
james is the eldest
to inherit the entire
ashford fortune
hes also to inherit
from his uncle
a healthy man who shows
little sign of departure
she is intriguing is she not
i find her repulsive
well i suppose she is if you find
a most rare and exotic flower so
he has much to recommend him
and a second fortune in life
should please any wife
dido you are not to be
a coquette with him
you already have your fortune
one does not make a wife of
the rare and exotic oliver
one samples it on the
cotton fields of the indies
why so far when it
is right at my door
good lord they are appraising me
then find a pure english rose
to decorate ones home
britain hail
o hail to thee
fairest island in the sea
though my favorite land shalt be
is she out
not quite
any day now
though my favorite land shalt be
britain hail all hail to thee
fairest island in the sea
you will refrain from any
intercourse with the negro
they may find it fascinating to have a lady
mulatto running around in their house
but i will not have one
running around in mine
she is an heiress
although exceptions can be made
it is said her father left
her a rather vast fortune
i mean to say if that
is your inclination
she is rather soft on the eye
i have thought no further of it mama
where do you get your information
her sistercousin has
a rather fast tongue
and what of you miss lindsay
are we to hear you play tonight
well
papa
oh do not be selfish with
your good fortune mlord
this will be most interesting
shes never played in company
she is most accomplished
hers was a most diligent governess
his family name will no doubt
induce her to take him seriously
she must not delude herself such
decisions are not hers to make
well then spell it out to her
before she renders herself sport
to some gent of cruel promises
she has no reason her inheritance
leaves her free to marry
that at least is true
it is elizabeth who must
secure her bread and butter
a portrait are you sure
yes aunt mary has confirmed it
good lord how truly wonderful
but
but what
papa should he not have wished
to see me before deciding
sorry i did not know you
mr davinier i believe youve
already had the pleasure
in some way yes miss lindsay
decide what
if he should should
want to paint me
the man is to be paid a fortune
what is there to decide
you are simply to sit still dido
not a very challenging task
next to elizabeth
as you always are
right beside each other
should not any lady be flattered
to be such a subject
how should any male
know the ways of a lady
when he has not even mastered
the ways of a gentleman
quite though one should be
forgiven for thinking
he is in the presence of a lady
when she is in fact
still a juvenile
papa may we do this in private
no not now
you may take the books
back to the library
upon the death of her husband
a widow may receive
her marriage portion and
her inheritance at once
she has 40 days to leave
her husbands home
mr davinier what is the purpose
of the law in your eyes
to provide certainty where
there otherwise might be none
example
the zong ship and those drowned
the law is one of the few trades
acceptable to a gentleman
i have little
but where my father
relies on the bible
i wish to rely on the law courts
and you aspire to the judiciary
one day yes my lord
i wish to make the laws for that is
how i may truly change this world
that is i i mean to say
make it a better place
you have grand ambitions
a country lawyer you may make if you
pay attention to what you are taught
but you have neither the rank
nor the finances for any more
well if i may my lord
neither did you
i beg your pardon
well
as a fourth son
you had rank but not the income
to pay for your
qualification to the inns
without the sponsorship of lord
foley and william hamilton
the english courts might not have
benefited from your brilliance
and the title lord chief justice
could not be yours today my lord
and you think you are worthy
of such considerations
of that i do not know my lord
but i do know that a country
life does not suit me
dido
the reverend davinier has asked me
to take his son under my tutelage
what do you think
thank you for your
gracious support
i neither spoke for or against
you since neither is my place
silence speaks volumes
papas new student
mr davinier
my cousin elizabeth
a pleasure
papa has never taken a
pupil you realize
someone to keep you company while
you take papas dictation dido
truth is there have been more men here
this week than ive seen in my entire life
hopefully we have not disappointed
on the contrary
mr davinier what
what is the importance of the zong
why is the case before papas
court the supreme court
well
it is a ship
i am aware of that
it is a human cargo ship
oh
it it lost most of its slaves
before arriving at its destination
drowned by the crew
on the captains orders
but why
miss your supper is served
now in the ladies parlor
thank you
will you be joining us for
dinner mr davinier
uh thank you madam
but i am promised to
the company of my
aunt this evening
very well as you wish
permit me to ask but
why do you not dine
with your family ever
that is not correct
forgive me but twice now i have seen
you separated from the gathering
i am confounded
and well you might be
when the son of clergy is permitted to
the table before a lady of the house
is that a reminder of my place
no it is a statement of mine
132 drowned en route from
africa to the west indies
your ruling could bring the
slave trade to its knees
entirely destroying an economic
foundation of this land
is that pressure not
maddening my lord
justitia fiat ruat
coelum  mr davinier
let justice be done though
the heavens may fall
the insurance claim states
the slaves were thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship
that there wasnt sufficient water
to survive the rest of the voyage
it does
then if im correct the case hangs on
it hangs on absolute necessity
if the killing of the negroes
was truly necessary
to save the ship as
the captain contends
but is that where it hinges
no man happily
disposes of his cargo
let me ask you were
you to enter a port
with barely one piece of merchandise
left to trade what would you do
swallow financial ruin or seek
recompense from your insurer
with due respect
i should question whether human life
should be insurable as cargo at all
a gentleman rather like him
once showed me great interest
mr davinier
really mary
well dont look at me like that
it was my mama who intervened
i thought he had a very
great sense of duty
a little overkind at times but
he is engaged you know
is he
engaged
mr beresfords daughter
the carriagemaker he might have
set his sights a little higher
i do love roses
everythings a little
late this year
for it is the power of
god unto salvation
so sayeth christ the lord amen
hymn number 76
mr davinier
wait
i was curious
quite a task to sit
for so many hours
of course
i appear the only one to have
just learned of the zong case
perhaps yours is a life less
concerned with such matters
why do you judge me so
it is a fact that i have contemplated
on the matter for many hours and i
i do not think the
slaves could have been
drowned in the way that you say
are you at utter disconnect
from everything
mr davinier please
tell me what you know
tell me
do not render me your amusement
i can only tell you what i believe
and what what is that
the slaves were thrown
into the waters
chained together as one
they were diseased
worth more as dead insured merchandise
than as alive spoiled goods
miss lindsay
but the insurers are appealing
they are refusing to pay
for murdered slaves
thank you
you told her they were
wantonly drowned
they were diseased but it was essential
that they die on the journey
or they would not come under
the insurance consideration
neither too if they had expired of their
diseases that is why they were killed
you have taken advantage of
confidential matters afforded you
these matters have been for
public consumption for months
miss lindsay is
no child no fool
her precious care is in my hands
and i will decide when she is
ready for such realities
not the son of a vicar
i will gather my belongings
do so
your lordship a question
well
as the mere son of a vicar
i wonder whether the value you extend
to your very precious mulatto niece
amounts to the 30 insurance
the traders are asking for
each life they murdered
good day my lord
mr davinier
find yourself in her
vicinity again
and i will make you rue the
day you ever set eyes on me
john davinier is leaving
very early today
there you are we are requested
you drawing room i relegated
to the ladies parlor
we are to attend
london for the season
we are to finally come out
elizabeth is to come out
dido is not
but why
you understand the ways of
the world for a female dido
elizabeth has no income
you are to meet as many gentlemen as
possible before we make the match
when all this has gone to her father
therell be nothing left for her
and me
any gentleman of good breeding
would be unlikely to form a
serious attachment to dido
and a man without would lower
her position in society
shes not merely my cousin mama
papa please
she is my sister
these are the keys of the house
i cannot attend london without her
they have hung at your
aunts waist for 30 years
i am not lady mary
i am not an unwanted maid
lady mary is too old to continue
in charge of the house
you may take up your
duties on your return
lord knows ill need the two of you
to keep each other out of trouble
are you punishing me
punishing you
you are most cherished
most loved
im so very sorry
do you think i may see
mr james in town
perhaps
i could fall in love
with such a man dido
love
hmm
bette you shall feel
no such sentiment
for you shall either end
poor or brokenhearted
arent you quietly relieved
that you shant be at the caprice
of some silly sir and his fortune
the rest of us havent the choice
not a chance of inheritance
if we have brothers
and forbidden from any activity that
allows us to support ourselves
we are but their property
girls come along now
light the fires for
dinner will you thomas
certainly maam
thank you
some bedsocks for
you miss murray
miss lindsay
thank you mabel how kind
its not as warm as
wed hoped tonight
can i help you with
that miss lindsay
you must start from the ends miss
my mam taught me
see
promise me you will do something
about that vulgar teal paint
if you ever become
lady of this house
it is positively
wanting elizabeth
lady mansfield lady mary
and their nieces madam
ladies
lady ashford
and the gentlemen mr james
here of course
nothing could have prevented him knowing
that miss murray was visiting today
papa
lord mansfields infamous mulatto
no wonder our lord chief justice knows
not whether hes coming or going
well she cannot know your thoughts
unless you offer them to her
ah the ladies mansfield
come here
careful
oh dido look mr james has made
me a boat and it has capsized
what a dreadful shame
for you
miss lindsay would you do me the honor
of taking some air with me sometime
dont you care what
people will say
what is that to mean mr james
what should anyone say
that he would compromise
a ladys reputation
by stepping out with her scarcely
having made her acquaintance
i think you are a great
deal too anxious brother
we should merely take a
turn around vauxhall
i should be delighted mr oliver
most delighted
are you really to defy papa
i did not think i would
ever find a lady
who was not to be
conquered or ignored
until you
i am not at ease with this lord
mansfield would be most aggrieved
oh it can do no harm
we are just two families
spending some time together
although if a desirable match
were a possibility
your dear husband could have
no objection could he
oh theyve disappeared people
will think she has no family
people will think
they are courting
see how my heart beats
i am utterly taken with
you miss lindsay
despite such pronounced
protestations from your brother
he cannot overlook your
mothers origins as i do
foolish
why should anyone even
pay her regard
when your better half has
equipped you so well with
with loveliness and privilege
what a lovely sound
you are unrelentingly cultured
come lets find it
i do hope you know how
well i think of you
as i do you
i might have only dreamed of
these moments at one time
really
then i hope you plan to
honor your attentions
as not to would leave me
looking quite foolish
and i should not call
myself a gentleman
you are much of the
conqueror mr oliver
mr davinier
miss lindsay
how
how nice to see you
and you miss lindsay
forgive me uh
mr ashford may i
present to you
mr davinier he is the son
of our vicar at hampstead
a clergyman
good evening to you sir
sir
miss lindsay you are alone
i did not have the chance to see you
before you left to convey my apologies
apologies
your pupillage
father would never have ended it you
never would have had to leave kenwood
he would make mine a living hell
were he to know of us speaking
i have tried to keep
up with the zong
forgive me
i have tried to keep up
with the zong
tis pitiful such
inability to simply know
what value to put
on anothers life
what price a worthless negro
you utterly misunderstand me
i am saying that no man may
have the value of cargo
human beings cannot be priced since we
are priceless freemen and slaves alike
i am with others here
all students in law
applying pressure on the
insurance companies
to refuse from hereon to
insure slaves on any ship
but that would require
a change in law
how can we expect to be civilized when
we live in such a barbaric world
it is the utter injustice
it is more than that
it is the shame of a
law that would uphold
a financial transaction
upon that atrocity
that is indeed the truth
i have never heard
anyone speak like you
nor i you miss lindsay
you should return
they will be anxious
goodbye miss lindsay
goodbye mr davinier
miss lindsay
we commune at the coaching
inn kentish town
most evenings
quite
elizabeth is a determined spirit
she will need a gentleman
who can temper her
quite a task
do i sense that an address
is finally to be made
she is an exquisite girl
and since there is no male heir
it will fall upon elizabeth
and her husband
eventually to inherit
kenwood and all its lands
i realize that there will be many
worthy addresses to consider
lady mansfield what is it
penniless
without an inch of property
or a shilling to her name
do you hear that james a ladys
good breeding alone will not do
your brother needs a wife who
can bring him more land
if he is ever to exert more political
influence than your father has
but what of her own father
the 7th viscount
stormont is a scoundrel
ensconced in vienna with that girls
vicious stepmama and his new offspring
who i am told
is to inherit everything
i must say penniless
though thankfully
her cousin is not
each time i set eyes on that
girl she becomes more beautiful
she has the coloring of a farmer
james you are my first boy blessed
by law to inherit your fathers wealth
be sympathetic to your brother
like the unfortunate miss murray
good family name and empty pockets
will only get him so far
is mabel a slave
i beg your pardon
is mabel a slave
she is free and under
our protection
oh like me
hardly dido
and paid a very respectable wage
how is the fraud appeal papa
fraud
the marine insurance
it is a fraud case is it not
it depends on who you speak to
to cull your cargo
solely to claim insurance
because it was too diseased to
achieve a good price at market
if not fraud then what
do you speak on my behalf
will you please stop
this is a vulgar subject
to discuss at breakfast
i learned yesterday
mr davinier is in town
im not surprised dido is beginning
to sound very much like him
excuse me
i had the pleasure of laying
eyes on your adopted girl
you have raised a lovely young lady and
though i understand she is kept under
interesting rules she
raises questions
oh
her introduction to society comes at
a key time in the insurance appeal
parliament is nervous
that the situation
in your family will
color your judgment
i will not have pressure put on me
either from the inside
or the outside
you are the highest
judge in the land
in you they see a man who is of the
persuasion and the power to bring down
the greatest trade of our time and the
commercial health of this country
some will say that
next to our king
youre the most powerful
man in england
and the same will ask how you
our chief justice can be fair
there are rules in place
which dictate how we live
if that were not the case
i would not have had the mandate
to give shelter to my
nephews daughter
she is his blood and mine
and is rightfully entitled to be
brought up on the family estate
if the law supports the
zong slave owners
as strongly as murray blood runs
through the veins of dido belle
then make no mistake the
insurers will be forced to pay
i believe you
i uh have reason to speak
with you on another matter
yes
i have a wish to seal the bond between
the ashford and mansfield names
whatever did happen in
the end aunt mary
with your gentleman friend
he never married
he died last year
after a long illness
oh aunt mary
pardon me
mr ashford is here for you miss
which mr ashford
you need worry about nothing
papa has been dealt with
miss lindsay
mr oliver
i think
well i know
that we make a rather good match
father has purchased me a
commission in the navy as captain
all that remains
uh i cannot offer you a title
for the next lady ashford
well that title must fall
to my brothers wife
what im trying to say is uh
is i can without doubt
offer you all that is due
to mrs oliver ashford
and trust that this will
be acceptable to you
since it would very
much be my privilege
my honor if you would
agree to become my wife
i cannot see
shh
good lord
mrs ashford
i
cannot
what are you doing
quiet elizabeth
cannot think of anything
more wonderful
oh she has agreed
mama we are engaged
oh my darling
it is a good thing
is it not mama
oh it is a wonderful thing
dido
yes
was there any message for me
no bette
but im sure it wont be long
what does it feel like dido
to be engaged
perfect bette
perfect
papa
thank you
we are to make many
calls today elizabeth
acquainting oneself with the most
eligible gentlemen is not light business
should we not wait a day
or two for mr james
elizabeth a word of advice
wait for no man dear
will you join us dido
dido
oh i am terribly lightheaded
this morning mama
i should like to take rest
if it would not displease you
oh dear unwell and just as were
about to announce your news
papa
lets see that smile come along
harry harry i need your help
i need you to take me somewhere
alone miss
i shall not be alone
i shall be with you
this is written anonymously
i have a list of those who have
not yet indicated their position
mr davinier
mr davinier
miss lindsay i
it is said all of the ships
papers have been lost but here
i found these in papas library
what are they
papas notes on the ships log
it seems the first mate
has come forward with it
one mr stubbs
i could not find the log itself
but look at papas markings
see the map positions
captain collingwood and his men directed
the ship past no less than 8 ports
where there was every opportunity
to replenish the
ships water supplies
good lord
and they did not
they either ignored the possibilities
or they were never in need
this is remarkable
perhaps if you could
make these facts
known mr davinier
this places you in an
impossible position
with lord mansfield
what is the alternative
walk with me miss lindsay
the back of the inn is safe from
anyone who may know you
theres noone but blind
and crying drunks
papa would rather i
see no ill as though
by ignoring it it
somehow escapes me
perhaps by position but not
not by blood
the fault was never with you
just as in life we are no
better in paintings
you were afraid
afraid
to be painted beside miss murray
and i ridiculed you
i feel ashamed
do not feel ashamed
elizabeth said something
when we arrived in london
we women are but the
property of gentlemen
but it came into my
head that i have been
blessed with freedom twice over
as a negro and as a woman
i suppose you have
or have i
must not a lady marry even
if she is financially secure
for who is she without a
husband of consequence
it seems silly like a free negro
who begs for a master
well
unless she marries her equal
her true equal
a man who respects her
i remember my fathers eyes
they were kind gentle
a little like yours
mine
i mean in color
he showed me much love though
i only knew him a few hours
what of your own mother
i know very little of her
other than the color
she has given me
well then at least you
know she was beautiful
i am to marry shortly
mr ashford
oh
he is amiable and of good family
is it what you want
the alternative is
to replace lady mary
in her responsibilities at kenwood
but shes a spinster
papa did not trust i
could achieve a match
that would raise my
rank or even equal it
you are above reducing
yourself for the sake of rank
i pray he would marry you
without a penny to your name
for that is a man who
would truly treasure you
what if i shall never find someone
so incomparably suitable
and wealthy
what if he is suitable but you
do not feel yourself with him
oh dido he understood me
and whenever he looked at me i
somehow felt better in this world
i am convinced his
affections are growing
and i feel certain of my own love
oh stop it it is not love
you stop it
you know no more of love
than i myself do you
do you dido
no
oliver and miss lindsay
make a blissful match
exactly when is she due to
receive her inheritance
and tell me are you an only son
i have 6 brothers madam
six goodness and
are they all
older madam yes
oh do look here comes
the baroness in her boat
oh how dreadfully
wonderful lady m
your girl is a picture an utter
picture with her intended
indeed baroness vernon
and i see the other
does not give up
so terribly endearing
you must meet the mansfield girl
still available
mama mr vaughn approaches
i have checked he has
no london home
but he achieves an income of
no less than 4000 a year
miss murray lady mansfield
i trust your stay in london is
proving pleasant miss murray
oh most certainly
i wonder if you might permit me to
call upon you at home some time
oh
with her ladyships permission
i will make arrangements
miss lindsay
not husband hunting are we
good lord i forgot
you have ensnared my brother
tell me are you to share his
dining room as well as his bed
oh mr james your manners are as
poor as your brothers finances
and you are foolish enough to
marry him i on the other hand
have no further use for
your impoverished cousin
though she does make for
rather amusing sport
that is painful sir
have you never been manhandled
it is not in my repertoire
to keep company with beasts
how dare you
with ease
you will destroy us
you will destroy the entire
order of our family
id never imagined myself to be
married but my aunt is determined
if one were to count i have not even
been acquainted with miss beresford on
3 occasions
is she not terribly disappointed that
you will not return to hampstead
my aunt
well i doubt miss beresford has any
more wish to marry me than i her
i should rather make a nuisance
of myself alone in london
than in an unwanted
marriage in hampstead
where is everyone mabel
all the carriages are gone
the ladies and miss murray are
out calling your lordship
is dido with them
um
shh
i believe so
were you a curious child
completely elizabeth always
asked the questions for me
dear dear bette
papa is to finally speak
in a few days and
i fear despite persuasive argument
your papa has not been moved
im not certain he is ready
to go against the traders
they are some of the most
powerful in these isles
and theirs are the finances that
hold up england after all
the enemies of any man who stood
against the trade would be vicious
and yet if he does stand up
if he speaks the words and
condemns the trade
the lord chief justice of england
then it may be impossible
for the slave laws of england and
its colonies to remain absolute
that is a fact
ive heard nothing from
him since vauxhall dido
i was certain an announcement was to be
made any day that he meant it this time
then he is not a man of his word
i will help you find the kindest
most wonderful of husbands
and
i shall ask papa to use a portion
of my inheritance for your dowry
you would do that
bette anything for you
dido
i have been of the mind
these last few days that
it is my little means that has delayed
james in making his approach
i think you may be right
then i cannot thank you enough
bette
i will ask papa to write
immediately to lady ashford
no
james ashford is not kind
he is not appropriate
appropriate
the brother of the man you are to
marry is not appropriate for me
he does not desire you bette
or at least even if he does you
would regret such a mistake
he
laid his hands on me bette in
the most ungentlemanly fashion
why should you say such a thing
he hurt me
you are a liar
why would i lie to you
i dont know
have you never been able to see
he would never touch you
bette
you are beneath him
i am beneath him
yes
yes you are
what
tell me what i am bette
you are
you are illegitimate
have you never wondered why you were
not permitted to eat with our guests
my mother and father never
married you are correct
but my father acknowledged
me as his child
it is yours who refuses to legitimize your
position and that is why you are poor
and that is why it is not me who is
beneath mr james it is not me
whoa
papa
this mans ambition includes you
you will endure shame and risk your
position for a man without name
who will sully yours and drag
your reputation into the gutter
i take great offense at your summation
of my character without even knowing me
where is your right
i have every right
not until you cease from
judging the entire world
as those above and those below
and begin to see people as people
human beings who think
and feel no more or
less than you do
i know there is a lady in belsize
who is waiting to be your wife
no i have an ambitious
aunt in belsize
who like you assumes that
wealth and reputation
are all that life depends on
and despises love
as though it were
the devils own creation
you claim love
yes yes
i love her
i love her with every
breath i breathe
go john
you do not deserve this
captain sir john lindsay would
never have behaved like this
he would never have behaved like
this because he was never here
you are destroying
your possibilities
with the only gentleman
who will consider you
is that what you want
arrogant parasite
fills her head with
worthless ideals
wants to make the
world a better place
and his childish campaign simply
adds to the ridicule aimed at me
in those contemptible pamphlets
and now like some kind of
saint immune from reproach
you said something
identical once
that you wanted to
change the world
quite some time before you entered
your chambers of course
defiant principled
desperate to secure your position
amongst the establishment but
always a little
too radical for them
i never broke the rules
you simply became powerful
enough to make new ones
i always felt that you
already loved me
when i gave you my hand
that we were a good match
was never a doubt
but i dont think i could
have married a gentleman
without that light in his eye
without knowing privately that
my heart stopped a moment
each time that he looked at me
it is possible that even you
cannot fight change my darling
sometimes you cannot fight it
because you are a part of it
do you love her
as though she were
created of you and me
and that is why
i simply will not
see her diminished
the niece of the
marquis of winchester
mr james ashford is to marry the
niece of the marquis of winchester
im reading it here
well that will render your future
motherinlaw ecstatic dido
shh
dont you dare say a word
i wont
why
why do they always do that
who bette
men
they just leave and
never come back
i saw you with mr davinier
at the pleasure garden
you said nothing
i wanted you to tell me
to trust me
i should have
you know
if i had your choice
i would choose the man i loved
i simply hope hes worth it
i am not in the habit of requiring
an explanation more than twice
but on this occasion you
will have to forgive me
there is little point
in repetition
then let me be clear i understand
your charge your mulatto charge
that is enough
is it not true your ladyship
whose unfortunate circumstances
at birth we chose to forgive
has decided she no longer
wishes the match with my son
a gentleman and an officer
why
miss lindsay
do you feel i have any lesser need to ensure
my childs wellbeing and future than you
does she still have a tongue
i have a tongue madam
though yours explains well enough
why i may not marry your son
you view my circumstances
as unfortunate
though i cannot claim even a
portion of the misfortune
to those whom i most
closely resemble
my greatest misfortune would
be to marry into a family
who would carry me
as their shame
as i have been required
to carry my own mother
her apparent crime
to be born negro
and mine to be the evidence
since i wish to deny her no more
than i wish to deny myself
you will pardon me for
wanting a husband
who feels forgiveness
of my bloodline
is both unnecessary
and without grace
it will hang at kenwood
will it
why should that surprise you
why should it not
what are you reading
a gentleman named thomas day
he speaks of a slave who agreed
to marry an english lady
a voice for people
people like my mother
who do not have one
do you find yourself
in such writing
i dont know that i
find myself anywhere
what do you want dido
what precisely are you looking for
i have enabled every
rule of convention
so that you would know
exactly where you belong
and yet little appears
enough for you
and what if there were
not a rule papa
what if the rule that allowed
you to take me did not exist
would you have returned
me to the slums
you are courageous
when it comes to the matters you believe
in society is inconsequential
you break every rule when it matters
enough papa i am the evidence
this painting is the evidence
look at them for and against
at each others throats
how on earth did the damn
quakers find their way in here
you are a brave man negotiating these
quarters on the eve of your judgment
finally you are to speak if england
is destroyed we shall blame you
religion not being the only
guardian of our morality
of course not there is
selfresponsibility
and failing that does
the law not have a duty
does the bench and parliament not have
a duty to uphold and create the laws
that progress our
morality not retard it
if not to protect us from others
then to protect us from ourselves
laws that allow us to diminish the
humanity of anybody are not laws
they are frameworks for crime
i do not care if you as an individual
are without character or conscience
but a land whose laws
sanction not control
the barbarous among its citizens
that is a country
whose hope is lost
why does it matter to you so much
mlord i have seen your notes
if they had wanted water
they could have had it
dido took them
mlord if you find
for the traders
you will be formalizing in law the
concept of insuring human cargo
thats correct
drive
then know that when you are gone your
legacy will be to have left miss lindsay
in a world where she may be
worth more dead than alive
miss lindsay is not a slave
by the very grace of god
this is not about miss lindsay
of course it is
its about all of us
its about everything
everything thats important
mr davinier
the world is a devastating place
you must learn to protect
your emotions
if you wish to prevent
matters both of law
and love from devastating you
good to see you john
silence in the court silence
the appeal court of
the kings bench
case of gregson versus gilbert
i am here today
to rule on certain matters
referred to me from
the lower court
in the case of the slave ship zong
how kind of you to
come mr vaughn
i have thought of nothing
else but showing
you aunt marys chrysanthemums
what a pleasure miss murray
you too mama
aunt mary
whether the enslaved cargo was
jettisoned in emergency
to save captain and crew
from certain death
when the extended journey threatened
shortage of drinking water
no never again
then allow me to take the reins
now let me be clear
the loss of water on a ship constitutes
a singularly dangerous affair
insurrection of thirsty
and hostile slaves
at its extreme and
an impossible task
to share diminished water reserve
amongst all those living at best
each implies a severe threat
to the lives of the seamen
and in such emergency
circumstances
our law is transparent
and unequivocal
the jettisoning of
enslaved cargo is legal
and it beholds the
insurers to pay losses
no
silence in court
gentlemen silence in court
however
these were not the
circumstances of the zong
slaves were not jettisoned
because water supplies ran low
indeed evidence shows the
ship sailed past 8 ports
without pausing to
restore water supplies
my finding is that the slaves
were jettisoned killed because
the zong ships owners
chose a tight packing fashion
to transport their slaves
they knew the risk since this
fashion of transportation
is wellknown to cause
disease in slaves
disease that rendered
the zong slaves
impossible to sell
silence in the court
gentlemen silence
it is not legal
to discharge lives from
a ship into the waters
to facilitate insurance
compensation
whether they be the
lives of horses
or human beings
slaves or otherwise
it is not legal
neither is it right
it is clear that a fraud
has been committed
in claiming insurance on
slaves who were drowned
solely for financial gain
it is my opinion
that the state of slavery
is so odious a position
that nothing may support it
let justice be done
though the heavens may fall
i find in favor of the insurers
ah
and overturn the decision
of the lower court
all rise
you may not blame mr davinier
my attendance today is
absolutely at my own volition
im fully aware dido
my lord i am inspired
by your decision today
we will not go backwards from here
history will judge whether
your optimism is warranted
youre a man of conviction
im trying to be
ive not changed my mind
she is to marry a gentleman
and mr davinier is
not a gentleman
he is indeed
my affections are with him papa
and that is why he should have
an occupation befitting one
i wish for nothing if
not to be his wife
mr davinier i would like you to
attend my chambers in the morning
there are some matters
you can assist me with
your lordship
and if you think its a good idea
i would like to facilitate your
entry into the inns of court
i think it is a very
good idea my lord
can it be true
of course he sees what i see
his words were as clear as
no
no that your feelings
for me are so
that you would be my wife
because i cannot conceive
