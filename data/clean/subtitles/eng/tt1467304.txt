i m dr  joseph heiter 
retired but still very well known as
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins 
you re a crazy nazi 
i ll get you 
you dirty german madman 
in six months   
i designed a never seen operation 
not separating anymore   
but creating 
i transformed my three rottweilers
into a beautiful three hound construction 
good news 
your tissues match 
so    
i will explain this spectacular operation
only once 
we start    
with cutting the ligament patelar 
also known as the ligament of the knee caps 
so knee extension   
is no longer possible 
pulling from  b  and  c    
the central incisors 
and lateral incisors and canines 
from the upper and lower jaws   
shut your mouth and untie me 
the lips from b  and  c    
and the anus of  a  and  b    
are cut circular along the border
between buttock and rectum 
the mucus retains so 
two pet acellular grafts
are prepaired
and lifted from the underlining tissue 
the shape incisions 
below the chins  of  b  to  c    
up to their cheeks 
connecting the circular skin parts   
of anus and mouth 
from  a  to  b 
and   b  to  c  
connecting   
the pet acellular grafts
to the chin cheek incisions   
what are you babbling about 
you really think
you ll get away with this 
creating   
a siamese triplet   
connected   
by the gastric system 
ingestion by  a    
passed through  b    
and excretion by  c  
a human centipede 
first sequence

ahh   
one of my rottweilers
tried to flee   
just before the operation 
after i caught him
