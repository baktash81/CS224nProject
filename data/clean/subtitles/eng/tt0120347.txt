thank you

keep it in a safe place
gentlemen and ladies
hold the presses
this just in
by a curious quirk of fate
we have the perfect story
with which to launch our
satellite news network tonight
a small crisis is brewing
in the south china seas
i want full newspaper coverage
i want magazine stories
books films tv radio
i want us on air 24 hours a day
this is our moment
and a billion people
around this planet
will watch it hear it
and read about it
from the carver media group
theres no news
like bad news
am pleased
with your progress mr bond
ive always enjoyed studying
a new tongue professor
one might say
you have a natural ability
but practice makes perfect
hmm whos that
how do you say
im not here in danish
ignore it
words they dont have
in their vocabulary
bond here
go to a secure line 007
going to scrambler
channel4
it was in international waters
we cant be certain
james where are you
oh moneypenny
umim just up here at oxford
brushing up on a little danish
little
youll have to kiss off
your lesson james
weve got a situation here
were sending
the fleet to china
uhhuh
ill be there in uh
in an hour
30 minutes
goodbye my sweet
you always were
a cunning linguist james
dont ask
dont tell
we know exactly
where that ship was
the global positioning
satellites do not lie
our singapore station picked up
a mysterious gps signal
it could have sent
that ship off course
i have a missing frigate
im aware of that
all you want to do
is prevent world war iii
i dont think sending an armada
is the way to do it
where did this signal come from
were still investigating
investigating
m sometimes i dont think you
have the balls for this job
at least i dont have
to think with them all the time
thats enough
where do we stand
it was an unprovoked attack on
a ship in international waters
we send in the fleet and prepare
for full retaliation
moderation
we investigate rather than send
the entire british navy
within 10 minutes of
the worlds largest air force
when will our ships get there
48 hours sir
christ the press are
already screaming for blood
we dont want
to escalate the situation
im afraid it may be too late
17 british sailors murdered
according to
vietnamese officials
the victims were riddled
with ammunition
used by the chinese air force
did you leak this
no
its the first ive heard of it
well this settles it
we send in the fleet
m you have 48 hours
to investigate
there is one strange thing
the vietnamese only found
our sailors three hours ago
howd they get the paper
out so fast
tomorrow knew before
the vietnamese government did
how much do you know
about elliot carver 007
worldwide media baron
able to topple governments
carver owns that newspaper
tomorrow
that mysterious signal came
from one of carvers satellites
the pm would have my head
if he knew you were
investigating him
im sending you to hamburg
theres a party tonight
at carvers media centre
theyve launched
a new satellite
he can now reach
every human being on earth
except the chinese
whove refused broadcast rights
james your ticket cover story
and car reservation
sign here please
you had a relationship
with carvers wife paris
that was a long time ago m
before she married
i didnt realise
it was public knowledge
queen and country  james
find out whether carver sent
that ship offcourse and why
use your relationship
with mrs carver
i doubt if shell remember me
remind her
then pump her for information
you just have to decide how much
pumping is needed james
if only that were true
of you and i moneypenny
passengers are asked
not to leave baggage unattended
if you just sign here mr bond
its the insurance damage waiver
for your beautiful new car
will you need
collision coverage
yes
fire
probably
property destruction
definitely
personal injury
i hope not
but accidents happen
they frequently do with you
well that takes care
of the normal wear and tear
do i need any other protection
only from me 007
unless you bring that car back
in pristine order
shall we
shall we
your new bmw 750
all the usual refinements
machine guns rockets
and a gps tracking system
welcome
please fasten seat belt
and obey all instructions
thought youd pay
more attention to a female
i think weve met
i am not interested
in your sordid escapades
your new telephone
talk here listen here
so thats what
ive been doing wrong
look
it also includes
a fingerprint scanner
and a 20000volt
security system
and this im
particularly proud of
the remote control
for your car
tap twice 1 2
draw your finger very slowly
across the pad
to drive the car
its difficult to drive
but with practice
lets see how she responds
to my touch
think we understand
each other
grow up 007
engine running
please shut door
engine running
please shut door
dont let her push you around
theres absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumour
that i ran
mad cow disease stories
simply because angus black
the british beef baron
lost 10000 to me at poker
and refused to pay
nor did i take 100 million
francs from the french
to keep the stories running
excuse me mr carver
yes
this is the new banker mr
bond james bond
i seem to collect bankers
mr bond how is the market
reacting to the crisis
currencies are off
your stock is soaring
i dont believe weve met
elliot carver
wai lin
from the new china news agency
i dont recall seeing
your name on the guest list
its not i snuck in
why my dear
i wanted to meet you
outstanding i admire a woman
who takes the initiative
you should work
in my beijing bureau
mr carver you dont have
a bureau in beijing
call me elliot
i always wondered
how id feel if i saw you again
now i know
was it something i said
how about the words
ill be right back
something came up
something always came up
and how are you paris
much better now were even
drink mrs carver
mr bond will have a vodka
martini shaken not stirred
mrs carver will have a tequila
straight shot
no mrs carver will have a glass
of mr carvers champagne
youve moved up
in the world paris
and tonight youre a banker
i saw the guest list
do you still sleep with
a gun under your pillow
to you
no to the gun
i take it this isnt
a social visit
your husband may be in trouble
if youre going after him
youre the one in trouble
its either him or someone
in his organisation
and you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me
no that wasnt my plan
good because ive made my bed
you dont sleep in it anymore
there you are
darling
ive been looking for you
meet wai lin
new china news agency
hello mrs carver
its a pleasure
and this is james bond
you know each other
oh were old friends
he dated my roommate
in zurich
im thinking of getting
wai lin behind a news desk
im sure she wont
resisttoo much
ahem elliot i was wondering
about your satellites
your global position
theyre merely tools
for information mr bond
or disinformation
if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments
or peopleor even a ship
thats very interesting
mr bond
you have a vivid imagination
for a banker
you should write a novel
heavens no
id be lost at sea adrift
mr carver
hmm ah
its time to begin
the festivities
excuse me darling
how do you really know him
hes a banker
i met him in zurich
youre a terrible liar dear
i have a problem with a banker
could i see you a moment
ladies and gentlemen
mr carvers broadcast will
be starting in 10 minutes
what kind of banking
do you specialise in mr bond
hostile takeovers
shall we
carver must feel at home
in a room like this
its nice to talk to the world
looks like theres someone
who wants to talk to you
mr bond you have
an urgent phone call
ladies and gentlemen
we are live in 5 4 3
good evening
tonights broadcast was supposed
to celebrate the completion
of the carver global
satellite network
but as youre well aware
terrible conflict looms tonight
in the south china sea
which has the potential
to destroy
every human being on earth
i want to assure my viewers
that i elliot carver
have spoken with
the prime minister in london
and the chairman
in beijing
its a soundproof room mr bond
nobody hears you scream
we have made contact
make him uncomfortable
ill be there in a few moments
with its printing presses
and its satellite facilities
linking every
you seem very concerned
about mr carvers business
he wants to know why
why did i do it you ask
the answer is simple power
the power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe
for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet
maybe we play
a number on his head
what do i expect in return
worldwide domination
complete utter total
worldwide domination
but not over government
or religion or ideology
over tyranny
and isolation and news
the carver network
has the ability to reach
herr stamper
but do not fear me
for tonight i reveal
my declaration of principles
a promise to the men
and women of this planet
whom i so humbly serve
i promise to report the news
without fear or favour
i promise to be a force
for good in this world
fighting injustice
crushing intolerance
battling inhumanity
its time
for a station break
that is the goal
of the carver
whats happened
weve lost power
what
ladies and gentlemen
please stay calm
we will go on
in a few minutes time
you dont know youre fired
and in a rather
embarrassing note
media mogul elliot carver
was cut off the air tonight
during the inaugural broadcast
of his satellite network
sorry elliot we didnt do it
glorious evening wasnt it
ignore those people
these things happen
not to me not to me
when i was 16 i went to work
for a newspaper in hong kong
it was a rag
but the editor taught me
one important lesson
the key to a great story
is not who or what or when
but why
your friend mr bond
made a mess tonight
i want to know why
i told you i barely know him
barely
i was curious
who carver would send
hes on to you
well we know where you stand
youve made your bed
im standing in your doorway
then turn around and go home
tell him you didnt
get anything out of me
thats it go home
i didnt ask you
to get involved in this
its too late for that
why did you marry him
he told me he loved me
that always sounds good
i used to look in the papers
every day for your obituary
im sorry
i keep disappointing you
what was it james
did i get too close
did i get too close
for comfort
yes
i missed you
what did you find
i hacked into the bank
theyre using ssl2 128
spare me the technobabble
bonds got a perfect
employment record
hes crossed every t
hes dotted every i
which means
government agent
if it sounds too good
to be true it always is
do you think my wife knows
if you dial down
the ambient noise
james do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow
play it again
do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow
i think we should
set an appointment for my wife
with the doctor
do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow
i have to go
no you dont
i can get you
out of the country
no one can protect me
from him not even you
you have a choice
only if you let him go
i cant do that
he has a secret lab
on the top floor
paris you dont
have to do this
dont argue with me james
you know
this job of yours
its murder on relationships
until i get back next week
i want two guards
24 hours a day
nobody gets in
well take care of it
what do we do
with the satellite
send this thing off
to the launch site
and be careful
its worth 300 million
looking for a news story
theyll print anything
these days
yes
good morning mr bond
elliot carver
i believe youve got
two items that belong to me
what are you talking about
the red box mr bond
and my wife in your hotel room
hes coming
fingerprint id accepted
select security system level
tell me if you find the encoder
call me immediately
ja
the president said
he can feel their pain
some late news
it is with great sadness
that we announce the death
of paris carver
the wife of elliot carver
chairman of this network
according to police
in hamburg germany
mrs carver was found dead
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances
on which police have refused
to elaborate
oh paris
her body was discovered
along with the body
of an unidentified man
the victim
of a selfinflicted gun wound
i have a clear shot mr bond
stand upslowly
drop your gun
und kick it toward me ja
good
now lie down on the bed
next to mrs carver
we extend our deepest
sympathies to mr carver
it will be
on the news in an hour
tomorrows news today
just so
my name is dr kaufman
i am an outstanding
pistol marksman
take my word for it ja
get the sledgehammers
she struggled terribly
mr bond
its a pity you got her
involved her in this
it wont look like suicide
if you shoot me from there
i am a professor
of forensic medicine
i could shoot you
from stuttgart
und still create
the proper effect
ow
herr stamper
my art is in great demand
all over the world mr bond
i am especially good
at the celebrity overdose
now i am afraid our little
stamper stop yelling in my ear
sir they cant
get into the car
you cant be serious
did you call the auto club
make him tell you
how to open it
ok ill ask
this is very embarrassing
there is a red box in your car
they want me to make you
unlock the car
i feel like an idiot
i dont know what to say
i am to torture you
if you dont do it
you have a doctorate
in that too
no this is more like a hobby
but i am very gifted
oh i believe you
my cell phone opens the car
no mr bond i do it
recall 3 send
wait
im just a professional
doing a job
me too
dr kaufman
welcome
please fasten seat belt
reduce speed
pedestrians in roadway
obstruction ahead
reduce speed now
unsafe driving
will void warranty
congratulations
on a safe journey
us airbase
south china sea
us airbase
south china sea
yo jimbo
wade what are you doing here
the worlds my office
this way
did q bring you up to speed
yeah i brought the gps unit
officially uncle sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot
and unofficially
we dont want world war iii
unless we start it
dr greenwalt is the
air force gps expert
the gps encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets
in the us military
show him what you got
the missing encoder
how did you get that
picked it up
in hamburg yesterday
could somebody use this
to send a ship offcourse
like the devonshire
did anyone mention devonshire
no
good
so answer
the mans question
in theory you could
send a ship offcourse
like putting a magnet
beside a compass
exactly
then check this out
those two circles should
line up on top of each other
somebodys tampered with this
if we knew where
the devonshire thought she was
could you figure out
where she sank
sure
wade
yeah
i have a small favour to ask
the highaltitude
lowopening jump
is where we get
the most fatalities
for five miles use your oxygen
or youll die of asphyxiation
like my first marriage
pop the chute at 200 feet
below the chinese radar
youll be travelling
over 200 mph
be careful not to crack
your skull open
ill keep that in mind
when you hit the water
dont forget
to cut away your chute
90 of the people killed
get tangled up and drown
seems a lot
to save the world
i have to prove that ship was
deliberately set offcourse
one minute
the pickup set
the extraction team
will pick you up after dark
buddha bless
i just noticed something
this is where
the ship thought it was
this is where it really is
but see that island there
where hes jumping is not
technically chinese waters
they belong to vietnam
vietnam
vietnam
he have any us government
markings on him
the parachute
the wetsuit the fins
jesus if the vietnamese
catch him
he didnt say goodbye
still interested
in hostile takeovers
its the opportunities to travel
that i like about banking
bring the boat over
bring the boat over
what are you looking for
get them out of the water
if i didnt know better
id say you were following me
we seem to have developed
an attachment to each other
hopefully not for long
another carver building
id say hes developed
an edifice complex
general chang
friend of yours
mr bond miss lin
welcome to saigon
nice to see you elliot
i hadnt intended opening
this centre until tomorrow
but you can help me write
the inaugural story
your obituaries
i hope you extended
the same courtesy to paris
actually mr bond
you wrote her obituary
when you asked her to betray me
still lets see
british secret service
agent james bond
and his collaborator
wai lin
of the chinese
external security force
were found
dead this morning
in vietnam
lacks punch dont you think
its old news weve been
working together for months
we know what you
and chang are up to
i dont think so
you may have seen
the general just now
but perhaps youve
not had chance
to peruse todays headlines
i like the last one
it isnt even mine
i never believe
the press anyway
therein lies
your problem mr bond
were men of action
but your era is passing
words are the new weapons
satellites the new artillery
and you become the new
supreme alliedcommander
exactly
caesar had his legions
napoleon his armies
i have my divisions
tv news magazines
and by midnight tonight
ill have influenced
more people than anyone
in history save god himself
and the best he managed
was a sermon on the mount
you are insane
the distance between
insanity and genius
is measured only by success
general chang is waiting
if youll forgive me
your appearance has forced me
your appearance has forced me
to move up
my timetable slightly
ill leave you
with mr stamper and his toys
perhaps youd like to see them
sir the helicopter
mr stamper is a protege
of the late dr kaufman
who was schooling him in the
ancient art of chakra torture
he was like a father to me
interesting role model
the body has seven
chakra points
energy centres
like the heart or genitals
these implements
probe those organs
inflicting maximum pain
whilst keeping the victim alive
as long as possible
dr kaufmans record
was 52 hours
im hoping to break it
watching your tv shows
is torture enough
save this one till last
when you remove mr bonds heart
there should be enough time for
him to watch it stop beating
we can use the banner
hope it holds
get after them
ready
go
oh sheesh
next time
ill take the elevator
get a car
no a bike is quicker
keys someone
always forgets them
im driving get off
get on the back
im slipping
stop fidgeting
what are you
give me that
clutch clutch clutch
right
no left
whos driving
clutch
left left
how many back there
i cant see hold on
what are you
dont get any ideas
id never dream of it
one no two
go for the barrels
very good
hold on
lets take the highway
helicopter
keep your shirt on
get on the back
are you trying to protect me
no i need to balance
the bike
you ready go
pop the clutch
its behind us
get out of the way
get down
get down
you see the chopper
i cant see hold on
trapped
never
would you pass the soap
over there
you were pretty good
with that hook
i grew up in
a rough neighbourhood
you were pretty good
on the bike
well i didnt grow up at all
here allow me
dont get any ideas mr bond
just off the cuff
i thought we might link up
walk hand in hand
stick closely to each other
maybe well go after
general chang together
thanks for washing my hair
i work alone
lucky for you i stopped by
i couldve taken care of him
hmm but you didnt
give me the earring
copy of a macro59
standard issue chinese army
looks like general chang
wants you dead
still think you can
do this alone
is your mission
peace or revenge
this is about stopping a war
last year stealth
material went missing
from one of changs bases
i followed a lead
to carver in hamburg
stealth material
we thought he was
building a stealth plane
no stealth boat
thats how they got
close to the devonshire
to drill inside
the missile room
they stole a cruise missile
hes moving
the timetable to midnight
hell position the stealth boat
near the british fleet
and fire the missile into china
and we will retaliate
and carver
provides the pictures
i have to warn beijing
no
lets get our governments
talking well find the boat
stand up
stand up
just like home
you get the equipment
ill send the messages
on second thoughts you type
first we have to find the boat
of all the harbours
and inlets controlled by chang
22 are in highly
populated areas
that leaves 14
to hide the boat in
its invisible to radar
but not the human eye
very novel
hed have to sail to the
devonshire and back in a night
this looks familiar
we made some improvements
did you indeed
ok 4 hours out
and 4 hours back
assume the boat is
travelling at 30 knots
im a fan
of chinese technology
there are four places
where he could harbour the boat
on your left
check those areas
ah a new walther
i asked q to get me one
ive got it look
four missing boats
three unexplained drownings
ha long bay
he knows the island
he says its dangerous
for boats there at sunset
but for 5000 hell take us
good
maybe hell take a cheque
its mostly dull routine
but every now and then
you get to work
with a decadent agent
of a corrupt western power
and they say communists
cant have fun
i hate to disappoint you
but i dont even have
a little red book
if anything happens to me
the fuses for the mines
are in here
were gonna
finish this together
and if i may say so
youve found the right decadent
western agent as a partner
see the stealth
no
its getting late
and this is the last cove
yeah thats it
set your timers for 10 minutes
time to get out
before it explodes
if it doesnt sink
our fleets will finish it
if they got our message
ok you up and over
were in position
between the fleets
were in position
between the fleets
fire one missile
at each flagship
the chinese will think the
british are rattling the sabre
the british will think the
chinese are being belligerent
and the media will provide
cool objective coverage
let the mayhem begin
tms bedford british fleet
tms bedford british fleet
missile lockon
signal to admiralty
missile lockon
signal to admiralty
task crew
under missile attack
two waves of landbased
mig21s inbound
should be on our screens
in 2 minutes
how long before the migs
are within firing range
12 minutes
what the hell do i pay you for
if shes there bond is there
stamper find them
wai lin wai lin camera
if she blinks kill her
you come with me
stamper to bridge
bond is dead
delicious
bring the girl up to me
are you sure
you want her up here
its my business mr gupta
i like an audience
ah ms lin
your countrymen are so
predictably eager to save face
they know you are here
theyre looking for you
not according to our radar
it seems your migs will attack
the british fleet in
nine minutes to firing range
even if they were
looking for me
they cant see me
on a stealth boat
or you or your friend
the late commander bond
who is on his way to the bottom
of the south china sea
hes my new anchorman
pathetic
what on earths going on
a message from 007 confirmed
by my opposite number in china
search for a ship thats
almost invisible to radar
the chinese arent the enemy
carvers been playing
both sides for fools
message from the admiralty
look at this
is there anything on the radar
that looks very small
lifeboat periscope
no sir
a stealth boat
theyve gone mad
what youre about
to witness ms lin
is not so much
a missile attack
but the launch
of a new world order
in 5 minutes once your
countrymen attack the british
i shall retaliate
for dear old england
by sending this missile
into beijing
where general chang
has just called
an emergency meeting
of the chinese high command
unfortunately
general chang
will be delayed in traffic
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders
too late to stop
the air force from sinking
the entire british fleet
but he will be just in time
to take over the government
negotiate a truce
and emerge as a world leader
with the nobel peace prize
and what do you get
me
oh
nothing
just exclusive broadcasting
rights in china for 100 years
ready to rock and ruin
excuse me my dear
i have a deadline to meet
prepare for
the missile launch
mr gupta
hello elliot
interesting plan
i have something here
that belongs to you
so much for german efficiency
mr stamper
dont shoot him yet
hold your fire
welcome to my world crisis
mr bond
even trade elliot
gupta for wai lin you cant
fire the missile without him
and it seems you cant resist
any woman in my possession
what are you waiting for
shoot him
i told you were gonna
finish this together
how romantic
do you realise
how absurd your position is
no more absurd than starting
a war for ratings
great men manipulate the media
to save the world
look at william
randolph hearst
who told his photographers
you provide the pictures
and ill provide the war
im just taking it
one step further
sorry about that i ertuned
out there for a moment elliot
touche
mr gupta
is the missile ready to fire
press the magic button
beijing disappears
then it seems youve
outlived your contract
you see mr bond
i have a backup plan
uhhuh so do i
hes breached the hull
theyll see us on radar
sir we have a small
intermittent contact
on the surface plot
bearing 112 degrees
cant get the range but
it wasnt there a second ago
tell all ships
do not fire on the chinese
for any reason whatsoever
send a message to the chinese
have sighted unknown ship
get those fires out
go and protect the missile
oh and mr stamper
would you please kill
those bastards
nice work
theyre speeding up
we have to stop the boat
take care of the engine room
and get off the ship
ill stop the missile
captain a signal from
the chinese fleet commander
to royal navy task group
we also have
the unknown ship on our screens
we will not fire unless
it turns towards china
until then shes yours
captain whatever the hell
that thing is sink it
right sir is that echo
too weak for missile lock
yes sir
right well do it
the oldfashioned way
bond turned us into the target
bond turned us into the target
along with himself
take evasive action
prepare the missile
countdown immediately
initialising launch sequence
t minus 5 minutes
and counting
t minus 5 minutes and counting
sir theyre making 48 knots
theyll be out of visual range
within 2 minutes
keep firing slow them down
the engines are out
were sitting ducks here
follow me
t minus 4 minutes and counting
ok
well done officer watch
increase max
keep firing
all hands abandon ship
abandon ship
abandon ship abandon ship
mr stamper what are you
doing about the girl
perhaps youd consider
looking in the engine room
t minus 3 minutes and counting
youre too late again
mr bond
its a bad habit of yours
theres nothing you can do
t minus 2 minutes and counting
the missiles fully programmed
it cant restart
in a matter of minutes
my plan will succeed
and thanks largely
to your efforts
the british navy
will destroy the evidence
and ill be out of here
in a carver news helicopter
covering the event
its going to be
a fantastic show
i may have some
breaking news for you
you forgot the first rule
of mass media
give the people what they want
t minus one minute and counting
drop it mr bond
or ill drop your friend
its over stamper
let her go
not between you and me
james try to detonate it
the missile will set them off
never argue with a woman
theyre always right
t minus 40 seconds
for carver
and kaufman
i owe you an unpleasant
death mr bond
nein
t minus 20 seconds
we die together mr bond
t minus 10 seconds
two
one
m bedford reports that carver
went down with his ship
it seems that bond made it
moneypenny take this release
elliot carver is missing
presumed drowned
while on a cruise
aboard his luxury yacht
in the south china sea
at present the local
authorities believe
the media mogul
committed suicide
