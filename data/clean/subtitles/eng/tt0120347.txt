good work  stamper 
  thank you 
  don t mention it 
keep it in a safe place 
gentlemen and ladies 
hold the presses 
this just in 
by a curious quirk of fate 
we have the perfect story
with which to launch our
satellite news network tonight 
a small crisis is brewing
in the south china seas 
i want full newspaper coverage 
i want magazine stories 
books  films  tv  radio 
i want us on air 24 hours a day 
this is our moment 
and a billion people
around this planet
will watch it  hear it
and read about it
from the carver media group 
there s no news   
like bad news 
 am pleased
with your progress  mr bond 
i ve always enjoyed studying
a new tongue  professor 
one might say
you have a natural ability 
but practice makes perfect 
hmm  who s that 
how do you say
 i m not here  in danish 
ignore it 
words they don t have
in their vocabulary 
bond here 
go to a secure line  007 
going to scrambler 
channel   4 
it was in international waters 
we can t be certain 
james  where are you 
oh  moneypenny 
um   i m just up here at oxford 
brushing up on a little danish 
little 
you ll have to kiss off
your lesson  james 
we ve got a situation here 
we re sending
the fleet to china 
uh huh 
i ll be there in  uh   
in an hour 
30 minutes 
goodbye  my sweet 
you always were
a cunning linguist  james 
  don t ask 
  don t tell 
we know exactly
where that ship was 
the global positioning
satellites do not lie 
our singapore station picked up
a mysterious gps signal 
it could have sent
that ship off course 
  i have a missing frigate   
  i m aware of that 
  all you want to do   
  is prevent world war iii  
i don t think sending an armada
is the way to do it 
where did this signal come from 
  we re still investigating 
  investigating 
m  sometimes i don t think you
have the balls for this job 
at least i don t have
to think with them all the time 
that s enough 
where do we stand 
it was an unprovoked attack on
a ship in international waters 
we send in the fleet and prepare
for full retaliation 
moderation 
we investigate rather than send
the entire british navy
within 10 minutes of
the world s largest air force 
  when will our ships get there 
  48 hours  sir 
christ  the press are
already screaming for blood 
we don t want
to escalate the situation 
i m afraid it may be too late 
 17 british sailors murdered  
according to
vietnamese officials 
the victims were riddled
with ammunition
used by the chinese air force 
  did you leak this 
  no 
it s the first i ve heard of it 
well  this settles it 
we send in the fleet 
m  you have 48 hours
to investigate 
there is one strange thing 
the vietnamese only found
our sailors three hours ago 
how d they get the paper
out so fast 
 tomorrow  knew before
the vietnamese government did 
how much do you know
about elliot carver  007 
world wide media baron 
able to topple governments 
carver owns that newspaper
 tomorrow  
that mysterious signal came
from one of carver s satellites 
the pm would have my head
if he knew you were
investigating him 
i m sending you to hamburg 
there s a party tonight
at carver s media centre 
they ve launched
a new satellite 
he can now reach
every human being on earth 
except the chinese 
who ve refused broadcast rights 
james  your ticket  cover story
and car reservation 
sign here  please 
you had a relationship
with carver s wife  paris 
that was a long time ago  m 
before she married 
i didn t realise
it was public knowledge 
queen and country   james 
find out whether carver sent
that ship off course and why 
use your relationship
with mrs carver 
  i doubt if she ll remember me 
  remind her 
then pump her for information 
you just have to decide how much
pumping is needed  james 
if only that were true
of you and i  moneypenny 
passengers are asked
not to leave baggage unattended 
if you just sign here  mr bond 
it s the insurance damage waiver
for your beautiful new car 
will you need
collision coverage 
yes 
fire 
probably 
  property destruction 
  definitely 
personal injury 
i hope not 
but accidents happen 
they frequently do with you 
well  that takes care
of the normal wear and tear 
do i need any other protection 
only from me  007 
unless you bring that car back
in pristine order 
  shall we 
  shall we 
your new bmw 750 
all the usual refinements  
machine guns  rockets
and a gps tracking system 
welcome 
please fasten seat belt
and obey all instructions 
thought you d pay
more attention to a female 
i think we ve met 
i am not interested
in your sordid escapades 
your new telephone 
talk here  listen here 
so that s what
i ve been doing wrong 
look 
it also includes
a fingerprint scanner
and a 20 000 volt
security system
and this i m
particularly proud of  
the remote control
for your car 
tap twice  1  2 
draw your finger very slowly
across the pad
to drive the car 
it s difficult to drive 
but with practice   
let s see how she responds
to my touch 
think we understand
each other 
grow up  007 
engine running 
please shut door 
engine running 
please shut door 
don t let her push you around 
there s absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumour
that i ran
mad cow disease stories
simply because angus black 
the british beef baron 
lost  10 000 to me at poker
and refused to pay 
nor did i take 100 million
francs from the french
to keep the stories running 
  excuse me  mr carver 
  yes 
this is the new banker  mr   
bond  james bond 
i seem to collect bankers 
mr bond  how is the market
reacting to the crisis 
currencies are off 
your stock is soaring 
i don t believe we ve met 
elliot carver 
wai lin 
from the new china news agency 
i don t recall seeing
your name on the guest list 
it s not  i snuck in 
why  my dear 
i wanted to meet you 
outstanding  i admire a woman
who takes the initiative 
you should work
in my beijing bureau 
mr carver  you don t have
a bureau in beijing 
call me elliot 
i always wondered
how i d feel if i saw you again 
now i know 
was it something i said 
how about the words
 i ll be right back  
something came up 
something always came up 
  and how are you  paris 
  much better now  we re even 
drink  mrs carver 
mr bond will have a vodka
martini  shaken  not stirred 
mrs carver will have a tequila 
straight shot 
no  mrs carver will have a glass
of mr carver s champagne 
you ve moved up
in the world  paris 
and tonight  you re a banker 
i saw the guest list 
do you still sleep with
a gun under your pillow 
  to you 
  no  to the gun 
i take it this isn t
a social visit 
your husband may be in trouble 
if you re going after him 
you re the one in trouble 
it s either him or someone
in his organisation 
and you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me 
no  that wasn t my plan 
good  because i ve made my bed 
you don t sleep in it anymore 
there you are 
darling 
i ve been looking for you 
meet wai lin 
new china news agency 
  hello  mrs carver 
  it s a pleasure 
and this is james bond 
you know each other 
oh  we re old friends 
he dated my roommate
in zurich 
i m thinking of getting
wai lin behind a news desk 
i m sure she won t
resist   too much 
ahem  elliot  i was wondering
about your satellites 
your global position 
they re merely tools
for information  mr bond 
or disinformation 
if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments
or people   or even a ship 
that s very interesting 
mr bond 
you have a vivid imagination   
for a banker 
you should write a novel 
heavens  no 
i d be lost at sea  adrift 
mr carver 
hmm  ah 
it s time to begin
the festivities 
excuse me  darling 
how do you really know him 
he s a banker 
i met him in zurich 
you re a terrible liar  dear 
i have a problem with a banker 
could i see you a moment 
ladies and gentlemen 
mr carver s broadcast will
be starting in 10 minutes 
what kind of banking
do you specialise in  mr bond 
hostile take overs 
shall we 
carver must feel at home
in a room like this 
it s nice to talk to the world 
looks like there s someone
who wants to talk to you 
mr bond  you have
an urgent phone call 
ladies and gentlemen 
we are live in 5  4  3 
2   
good evening 
tonight s broadcast was supposed
to celebrate the completion
of the carver global
satellite network 
but  as you re well aware 
terrible conflict looms tonight
in the south china sea 
which has the potential
to destroy
every human being on earth 
i want to assure my viewers
that i  elliot carver 
have spoken with
the prime minister in london
and the chairman
in beijing   
it s a soundproof room  mr bond 
nobody hears you scream 
  we have made contact 
  make him uncomfortable 
i ll be there in a few moments 
  with its printing presses
and its satellite facilities
linking every   
you seem very concerned
about mr carver s business 
he wants to know why 
why did i do it  you ask 
the answer is simple  power 
the power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe 
for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet 
maybe we play
a number on his head 
what do i expect in return 
world wide domination 
complete  utter  total
world wide domination 
but not over government
or religion or ideology 
over tyranny
and isolation and news 
the carver network
has the ability  to reach   
herr stamper 
but do not fear me 
for tonight i reveal
my declaration of principles 
a promise to the men
and women of this planet
whom i so humbly serve 
i promise to report the news
without fear or favour 
i promise to be a force
for good in this world 
fighting injustice 
crushing intolerance 
battling inhumanity   
it s time   
  for a station break 
  that is the goal
of the carver   
what s happened 
  we ve lost power 
  what  
ladies and gentlemen 
please stay calm 
we will go on
in a few minutes time 
you don t know  you re fired 
and in a rather
embarrassing note 
media mogul elliot carver
was cut off the air tonight
during the inaugural broadcast
of his satellite network 
sorry  elliot  we didn t do it 
glorious evening  wasn t it 
ignore those people 
these things happen 
not to me  not to me 
when i was 16  i went to work
for a newspaper in hong kong 
it was a rag 
but the editor taught me
one important lesson 
the key to a great story
is not who or what or when   
but why 
your friend  mr bond 
made a mess tonight 
  i want to know why 
  i told you  i barely know him 
barely 
i was curious
who carver would send 
he s on to you 
well  we know where you stand 
you ve made your bed 
i m standing in your doorway 
then turn around and go home 
tell him you didn t
get anything out of me 
that s it  go home 
i didn t ask you
to get involved in this 
it s too late for that 
why did you marry him 
he told me he loved me 
that always sounds good 
i used to look in the papers
every day for your obituary 
i m sorry 
i keep disappointing you 
what was it  james 
did i get too close 
did i get too close
for comfort 
yes 
i missed you 
what did you find 
i hacked into the bank 
they re using ss l2  128   
spare me the techno babble 
bond s got a perfect
employment record 
he s crossed every t 
he s dotted every i 
  which means 
  government agent 
if it sounds too good
to be true  it always is 
do you think my wife knows 
if you dial down
the ambient noise   
james  do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow 
play it again 
do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow 
i think we should
set an appointment for my wife
with the doctor 
do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow 
  i have to go 
  no  you don t 
i can get you
out of the country 
no one can protect me
from him  not even you 
  you have a choice 
  only if you let him go 
i can t do that 
he has a secret lab
on the top floor 
paris  you don t
have to do this 
don t argue with me  james 
you know   
this job of yours   
it s murder on relationships 
until i get back next week 
i want two guards
24 hours a day 
  nobody gets in 
  we ll take care of it 
what do we do
with the satellite 
send this thing off
to the launch site 
and be careful 
it s worth  300 million 
looking for a news story 
they ll print anything
these days 
yes 
good morning  mr bond 
elliot carver 
i believe you ve got
two items that belong to me 
what are you talking about 
the red box  mr bond 
and my wife in your hotel room 
he s coming 
fingerprint i d  accepted 
select security system level 
tell me if you find the encoder 
  call me immediately 
  ja 
the president said
he can  feel their pain  
some late news  
it is with great sadness
that we announce the death
of paris carver 
the wife of elliot carver 
chairman of this network 
according to police
in hamburg  germany 
mrs carver was found dead
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances
on which police have refused
to elaborate 
oh  paris 
her body was discovered
along with the body
of an unidentified man 
the victim
of a self inflicted gun wound 
i have a clear shot  mr bond 
stand up   slowly 
drop your gun
und kick it toward me  ja 
good 
now lie down on the bed
next to mrs carver 
  we extend our deepest
sympathies to mr carver 
it will be
on the news in an hour 
  tomorrow s news today 
  just so 
my name is dr kaufman 
i am an outstanding
pistol marksman 
take my word for it  ja 
get the sledgehammers 
she struggled terribly 
mr bond 
it s a pity you got her
involved her in this 
it won t look like suicide
if you shoot me from there 
i am a professor
of forensic medicine 
i could shoot you
from stuttgart 
und still create
the proper effect 
  ow 
  herr stamper 
my art is in great demand
all over the world  mr bond 
i am especially good
at the celebrity overdose 
now  i am afraid our little   
stamper  stop yelling in my ear 
sir  they can t
get into the car 
you can t be serious 
did you call the auto club 
make him tell you
how to open it 
ok  i ll ask 
this is very embarrassing 
there is a red box in your car 
they want me to make you
unlock the car 
i feel like an idiot 
i don t know what to say 
i am to torture you
if you don t do it 
you have a doctorate
in that  too 
no  this is more like a hobby 
but i am very gifted 
oh  i believe you 
  my cell phone opens the car   
  no  mr bond  i do it 
recall  3  send 
wait 
i m just a professional
doing a job 
me too 
dr kaufman 
welcome 
please fasten seat belt 
reduce speed 
pedestrians in roadway 
obstruction ahead 
reduce speed now 
unsafe driving
will void warranty   
congratulations
on a safe journey 
u s  airbase
south china sea
u s  airbase
south china sea
yo  jimbo 
wade  what are you doing here 
the world s my office 
this way 
  did q bring you up to speed 
  yeah  i brought the gps unit 
officially  uncle sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot 
and unofficially 
we don t want world war iii  
unless we start it 
dr greenwalt is the
air force gps expert 
the gps encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets
in the u s  military 
show him what you got 
the missing encoder 
how did you get that 
picked it up
in hamburg yesterday 
could somebody use this
to send a ship off course 
like the devonshire 
did anyone mention devonshire 
  no   
  good 
so answer
the man s question 
in theory  you could
send a ship off course 
like putting a magnet
beside a compass 
  exactly 
  then check this out 
those two circles should
line up on top of each other 
somebody s tampered with this 
if we knew where
the devonshire thought she was 
could you figure out
where she sank 
sure 
  wade 
  yeah 
i have a small favour to ask 
the high altitude 
low opening jump
is where we get
the most fatalities 
for five miles use your oxygen 
or you ll die of asphyxiation 
like my first marriage 
pop the chute at 200 feet
below the chinese radar 
you ll be travelling
over 200 mph 
be careful not to crack
your skull open 
i ll keep that in mind 
when you hit the water 
don t forget
to cut away your chute 
90    of the people killed
get tangled up and drown 
seems a lot
to save the world 
i have to prove that ship was
deliberately set off course 
  one minute 
  the pick up set 
the extraction team
will pick you up after dark 
buddha bless 
i just noticed something 
this is where
the ship thought it was 
this is where it really is 
but see that island there 
where he s jumping is not
technically chinese waters 
they belong to vietnam 
  vietnam  
  vietnam  
he have any u s  government
markings on him 
the parachute 
the wetsuit  the fins 
jesus  if the vietnamese
catch him 
he didn t say good bye 
still interested
in hostile take overs 
it s the opportunities to travel
that i like about banking 
bring the boat over 
bring the boat over 
what are you looking for 
get them out of the water 
if i didn t know better 
i d say you were following me 
we seem to have developed
an attachment to each other 
hopefully  not for long 
another carver building 
i d say he s developed
an edifice complex 
  general chang 
  friend of yours 
mr bond  miss lin 
welcome to saigon 
nice to see you  elliot 
i hadn t intended opening
this centre until tomorrow 
but you can help me write
the inaugural story  
your obituaries 
i hope you extended
the same courtesy to paris 
actually  mr bond 
you wrote her obituary
when you asked her to betray me 
still  let s see 
british secret service
agent james bond
and his collaborator
wai lin
of the chinese
external security force
were found   
dead this morning
in vietnam 
lacks punch  don t you think 
it s old news  we ve been
working together for months 
we know what you
and chang are up to 
i don t think so 
you may have seen
the general just now 
but perhaps you ve
not had chance
to peruse today s headlines 
i like the last one 
it isn t even mine 
i never believe
the press anyway 
therein lies
your problem  mr bond 
we re men of action 
but your era is passing 
words are the new weapons 
satellites the new artillery 
and you become the new
supreme allied   commander 
exactly 
caesar had his legions 
napoleon his armies 
i have my divisions  
tv  news  magazines 
and by midnight tonight 
i ll have influenced
more people than anyone
in history save god himself 
and the best he managed
was a sermon on the mount 
you are insane 
the distance between
insanity and genius
is measured only by success 
  general chang is waiting 
  if you ll forgive me 
your appearance has forced me
your appearance has forced me
to move up
my timetable slightly 
i ll leave you
with mr stamper and his toys 
perhaps you d like to see them 
sir  the helicopter 
mr stamper is a protege
of the late dr kaufman 
who was schooling him in the
ancient art of chakra torture 
  he was like a father to me 
  interesting role model 
the body has seven
chakra points  
energy centres  
like the heart or genitals 
these implements
probe those organs 
inflicting maximum pain
whilst keeping the victim alive
as long as possible 
dr kaufman s record
was 52 hours 
i m hoping to break it 
watching your tv shows
is torture enough 
save this one till last 
when you remove mr bond s heart 
there should be enough time for
him to watch it stop beating 
we can use the banner 
  hope it holds 
  get after them 
  ready 
  go 
oh  sheesh 
next time 
i ll take the elevator 
get a car 
no  a bike is quicker 
keys  someone
always forgets them 
i m driving  get off 
get on the back 
i m slipping 
stop fidgeting 
  what are you   
  give me that 
clutch  clutch  clutch 
  right 
  no  left 
who s driving 
clutch 
left  left 
  how many back there 
  i can t see  hold on 
what are you   
  don t get any ideas 
  i d never dream of it 
one  no  two 
go for the barrels 
very good 
hold on 
let s take the highway 
  helicopter 
  keep your shirt on 
  get on the back 
  are you trying to protect me 
no  i need to balance
the bike 
you ready  go 
pop the clutch 
it s behind us 
get out of the way 
get down 
get down 
  you see the chopper 
  i can t see  hold on 
trapped 
never 
would you pass the soap 
over there 
you were pretty good
with that hook 
i grew up in
a rough neighbourhood 
you were pretty good
on the bike 
well  i didn t grow up at all 
here  allow me 
don t get any ideas  mr bond 
just off the cuff 
i thought we might link up 
walk hand in hand 
stick closely to each other 
maybe we ll go after
general chang together 
thanks for washing my hair 
i work alone 
lucky for you i stopped by 
i could ve taken care of him 
hmm  but you didn t 
give me the earring 
copy of a macro 59 
standard issue  chinese army 
looks like general chang
wants you dead 
still think you can
do this alone 
is your mission
peace or revenge 
this is about stopping a war 
last year  stealth
material went missing
from one of chang s bases 
i followed a lead
to carver in hamburg 
stealth material 
we thought he was
building a stealth plane 
no  stealth boat 
that s how they got
close to the devonshire 
to drill inside
the missile room 
they stole a cruise missile 
he s moving
the timetable to midnight 
he ll position the stealth boat
near the british fleet
and fire the missile into china 
and we will retaliate 
and carver
provides the pictures 
  i have to warn beijing 
  no 
let s get our governments
talking  we ll find the boat 
stand up 
stand up 
just like home 
you get the equipment 
i ll send the messages 
on second thoughts  you type 
first we have to find the boat 
of all the harbours
and inlets controlled by chang 
22 are in highly
populated areas 
that leaves 14
to hide the boat in 
it s invisible to radar
but not the human eye 
very novel 
he d have to sail to the
devonshire and back in a night 
  this looks familiar 
  we made some improvements 
did you  indeed 
ok  4 hours out
and 4 hours back 
assume the boat is
travelling at 30 knots 
i m a fan
of chinese technology 
there are four places
where he could harbour the boat 
on your left 
check those areas 
ah  a new walther 
i asked q to get me one 
i ve got it  look 
four missing boats 
three unexplained drownings 
ha long bay 
he knows the island 
he says it s dangerous
for boats there at sunset 
but for  5 000  he ll take us 
good 
maybe he ll take a cheque 
it s mostly dull routine 
but every now and then 
you get to work
with a decadent agent
of a corrupt western power 
and they say communists
can t have fun 
i hate to disappoint you 
but i don t even have
a little red book 
if anything happens to me 
the fuses for the mines
are in here 
we re gonna
finish this together 
and if i may say so 
you ve found the right decadent
western agent as a partner 
see the stealth 
no 
it s getting late
and this is the last cove 
yeah  that s it 
set your timers for 10 minutes 
time to get out
before it explodes 
if it doesn t sink 
our fleets will finish it 
if they got our message 
ok  you  up and over 
we re in position
between the fleets 
we re in position
between the fleets 
fire one missile
at each flagship 
the chinese will think the
british are rattling the sabre 
the british will think the
chinese are being belligerent 
and the media will provide
cool  objective coverage 
let the mayhem begin

two waves of land based
mig 21s inbound 
should be on our screens
in 2 minutes 
how long before the migs
are within firing range 
12 minutes 
what the hell do i pay you for 
if she s there  bond is there 
stamper  find them 
wai lin  wai lin  camera 
if she blinks  kill her 
you  come with me 
stamper to bridge 
bond is dead 
delicious 
bring the girl up to me 
are you sure
you want her up here 
it s my business  mr gupta 
i like an audience 
ah  ms lin 
your countrymen are so
predictably eager to save face 
they know you are here 
they re looking for you 
not according to our radar 
it seems your migs will attack
the british fleet in    
nine minutes to firing range 
even if they were
looking for me 
they can t see me
on a stealth boat 
or you  or your friend 
the late commander bond 
who is on his way to the bottom
of the south china sea 
he s my new anchorman 
pathetic 
what on earth s going on 
a message from 007  confirmed
by my opposite number in china 
search for a ship that s
almost invisible to radar 
the chinese aren t the enemy 
carver s been playing
both sides for fools 
  message from the admiralty 
  look at this 
is there anything on the radar
that looks very small 
  lifeboat  periscope 
  no  sir 
a stealth boat  
they ve gone mad 
what you re about
to witness  ms lin 
is not so much
a missile attack
but the launch
of a new world order 
in 5 minutes  once your
countrymen attack the british 
i shall retaliate
for dear old england
by sending this missile
into beijing 
where general chang
has just called
an emergency meeting
of the chinese high command 
unfortunately   
general chang   
will be delayed in traffic 
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders 
too late to stop
the air force from sinking
the entire british fleet 
but he will be just in time
to take over the government 
negotiate a truce 
and emerge as a world leader
with the nobel peace prize 
  and what do you get 
  me 
oh   
nothing 
just exclusive broadcasting
rights in china for 100 years 
ready to rock and ruin 
excuse me  my dear 
i have a deadline to meet 
prepare for
the missile launch 
mr gupta 
hello  elliot 
interesting plan 
i have something here
that belongs to you 
so much for german efficiency 
mr stamper 
don t shoot him yet 
hold your fire 
welcome to my world crisis 
mr bond 
even trade  elliot 
gupta for wai lin  you can t
fire the missile without him 
and it seems you can t resist
any woman in my possession 
what are you waiting for 
shoot him 
i told you  we re gonna
finish this together 
how romantic 
do you realise
how absurd your position is 
no more absurd than starting
a war for ratings 
great men manipulate the media
to save the world 
look at william
randolph hearst 
who told his photographers 
 you provide the pictures 
and i ll provide the war  
i m just taking it
one step further 
sorry about that  i  er   tuned
out there for a moment  elliot 
touche 
mr gupta 
is the missile ready to fire 
press the magic button 
beijing disappears 
then it seems you ve
outlived your contract 
you see  mr bond 
i have a back up plan 
uh huh  so do i 
he s breached the hull 
they ll see us on radar 
sir  we have a small
intermittent contact
on the surface plot 
bearing 1 1 2 degrees 
can t get the range  but
it wasn t there a second ago 
tell all ships
do not fire on the chinese
for any reason whatsoever 
send a message to the chinese 
 have sighted unknown ship    
get those fires out 
go and protect the missile 
oh  and  mr stamper 
would you please kill
those bastards  
nice work 
  they re speeding up 
  we have to stop the boat 
take care of the engine room
and get off the ship 
i ll stop the missile 
captain  a signal from
the chinese fleet commander 
to royal navy task group 
we also have
the unknown ship on our screens 
we will not fire unless
it turns towards china 
until then she s yours 
captain  whatever the hell
that thing is  sink it 
right  sir  is that echo
too weak for missile lock 
yes  sir 
right  we ll do it
the old fashioned way 
bond turned us into the target 
bond turned us into the target 
along with himself 
take evasive action 
prepare the missile
countdown immediately 
initialising launch sequence 
t minus 5 minutes
and counting 
t minus 5 minutes and counting 
sir  they re making 48 knots 
they ll be out of visual range
within 2 minutes 
keep firing  slow them down 
the engines are out 
we re sitting ducks here 
follow me 
t minus 4 minutes and counting 
ok 
well done  officer watch 
increase max 
keep firing 
all hands  abandon ship 
abandon ship 
abandon ship  abandon ship 
mr stamper  what are you
doing about the girl 
perhaps you d consider
looking in the engine room 
t minus 3 minutes and counting 
you re too late again 
mr bond 
it s a bad habit of yours 
there s nothing you can do 
t minus 2 minutes and counting 
the missile s fully programmed 
it can t restart 
in a matter of minutes 
my plan will succeed 
and thanks largely
to your efforts 
the british navy
will destroy the evidence 
and i ll be out of here
in a carver news helicopter
covering the event 
it s going to be
a fantastic show 
i may have some
breaking news for you 
you forgot the first rule
of mass media 
give the people what they want 
t minus one minute and counting 
drop it  mr bond   
or i ll drop your friend 
it s over  stamper 
let her go 
not between you and me 
james  try to detonate it 
the missile will set them off 
never argue with a woman 
they re always right 
t minus 40 seconds 
for carver 
and kaufman 
i owe you an unpleasant
death  mr bond 
nein 
t minus 20 seconds 
we die together  mr bond 
t minus 10 seconds 
two   
one   
m  bedford reports that carver
went down with his ship 
it seems that bond made it 
moneypenny  take this release 
elliot carver is missing 
presumed drowned
while on a cruise
aboard his luxury yacht
in the south china sea 
at present  the local
authorities believe
the media mogul
committed suicide
