handmade in italy 
hand stolen in stepney

the only man who sells
empty boxes is the undertaker   
and by the look of you lot   
i d make more money
with me measuring tape 
one price  ten pound

and i know
that i m getting alive
and i say i got faith
and a season
and i say that s
where i m going to   
ed can hustle
a few quid here and there   
but his real talent lies in
cards and gambling with cards 
bacon could see that his days   
of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered 
it s time to move on 
and he knows it 
so i said i m on the roam
so i need a car
and i know
that i m staying alive
and i know
that i m staying alive
and i know
that my faith is in season
and i say   
what are you talking about 
i m bloody skinny  pal 
yeah  of course you are 
all right 
nick the greek 
always a pleasure 
tom  what have you been eating 
i ve been telling him this 
enough  already 
you two  join me in my office 
so how much is it  tom 
you know how much it is  nick 
that includes the amp 
no  that does not
include the amp 
shit  tom 
i thought it included the amp 
well  it doesn t 
i ll throw in
one of these telephones   
but it does not
include the amp 
very nice 
i hope it includes the speakers 
it doesn t include the speakers 
it doesn t include the amp   
and it s not supposed
to include me   
getting the hump
with your stupid questions 
now  you want it  nick 
you buy it 
what else do i get with it 
a gold plated rolls royce 
as long as you pay for it 
don t know  tom 
seems expensive 
seems  well  this seems to be
a waste of my time 
that is nine hundred nicker
in any shop   
you re lucky enough
to find one in   
and you re complaining
about two hundred 
what school of finance
did you study 
it s a deal  it s a steal 
it s sale
of the fucking century 
in fact  fuck it  nick 
i think i ll keep it 
all right  all right 
keep your alans on 
here s a ton 
  jesus christ 
  jesus christ 
you could choke
a dozen donkeys on that 
and you re haggling
over one hundred pound 
what do you do when you re not
buying stereos  nick   
finance revolutions 
one hundred pounds
is still one hundred pounds 
not when the price is
two hundred pounds  it s not 
and certainly not
when you ve got   
liberia s deficit
in your sky rocket 
tighter than a duck s butt 
you are 
come on  let me feel
the fiber of your fabric 
the skinny one is tom   
and he s the entrepreneur
of the bunch 
he s got a couple
of dirty little fingers   
in a couple of dirty
little pies 
nick here  however 
has made it his business   
to have all twenty
fat little fingers and toes   
in every dirty bent
and stolen pie in london 
between the two of them   
there ain t much
you can t get ahold of 
that s my twenty five grand 
it s all there 
it took me a long time
to earn that   
so you treat it with respect 
what about the chef 
what have you come as 
cupid  stupid 
that s the last time i m getting
any more fruit off of you  tom 
do you call that fresh 
there was more small hairy
armored things in your fruit   
then there was fruit 
you should open a butcher s 
not a grocer s 
if you will order stuff
from katmandu   
don t be surprised if it picks
up a few tourists en route 
anyway  enough about that 
where s the money 
oi  keep your fingers
out of my soup 
soap is called  soap    
because he likes
to keep his hands clean   
of any unlawful behavior 
he s proud of his job and even
more proud that it s legal 
he represents the more
sensible side of the four 
you sure you can
afford twenty five 
that depends
on how you look at it 
i can afford it
as long as i see it again 
got the rest
from the fat man and bacon 
fat man  bacon  and myself 
looks like it s time
to make that call to harry 
who s this fat man  then  eh 
eh 
do you want a sandwich  bacon 
it s not easy to take a seat   
at this card table 
the amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards   
and there s no shortage
of punters 
the man who decides
whether you can play or not   
is this man    harry   
or as some  including himself 
like to call him    hatchet harry 
you got it all 
one hundred grand 
well  if you got it 
you got it 
now  if you don t mind   
what s this eddie like  then 
he s a fucking thief 
harry has a colleague   
a monster of a man   
barry the baptist 
the baptist got his name
by drowning people for hatchet 
are you going to fucking pay 
yeah  i ll pay  i said i ll pay 
aah 
barry makes sure   
the administrative side of
the business runs harmoniously 
the boy s got a rare ability 
he seems to make cards
transparent 
all right  all right 
so we can say he s good 
oh  no 
he s better than good 
he s a fucking liability 
here  hold on 
what do you think of these 
we re selling hundreds 
very nice  harry 
what s it for 
oh  don t play innocent
with me  bazza 
spanking 
twenty five from me 
tom  soap  and yourself 
it s a hundred grand
to the pound 
so why the fuck
are you counting it 
because i like to 
a reasonable return should
be in the region of 120 grand 
that s for 25 grand invested 
going on previous experience 
going on optimism 
whatever it s going on 
it should be enough   
to send you on a cooking course 
you re not funny  tom 
you re fat and look as though
you should be  but you re not 
fat  who are you calling   
jesus 
it s good in here  isn t it 
handy for the tube 
great electrics 
i can see why you moved in 
don t knock it 
it s  cheap   like the budgie 
nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to 
a bit antisocial 
to say the least 
what do you mean 
he means
they re thieving bastards 
i mean  when they re not
picking peanuts out of poop   
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their hard earned drugs 
not exactly thick  these walls 
nice work 
get yourself a drink 
is that it 
how many times do i
have to tell you  plank 
you find us a job worth doing   
you ll find your share
improving 
have you got
a problem with that 
charlie 
police and thieves in the street
police and thieves in the street
fighting the nation with their
guns and ammunition
you know  charles 
this gear is getting heavier 
i ve a strong suspicion
we should have been   
rocket scientists   
or nobel peace prize winners
or something 
peace prize 
ooh  be lucky to find
your penis for a piss   
the amount you keep smoking 
who the hell s that

charles 
why have we got that cage 
uh  security 
that s right 
that s right  security 
so what s the point
in having it   
if we re not going to

winston  but this is willie   
and willie lives here 
yes  charles  but you
didn t know it was willie   
yes  charles  but you
didn t know it was willie   
until you opened the door 
did you 
chill  winston 
it s me  charlie knows it s me 
what s the problem 
the problem is  willie 
that charles and yourself   
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times   
so just do as i say and keep
the fucking cage locked 
what is that 
that s gloria 
yes  i know that s gloria

and now i wanna be your dog
well  come on
hello  boy 
feeling a bit poorly 
i know your friends
are responsible   
for most of the cash   
so i m going to give you
one week to find it 
otherwise 
i will take a finger   
off each of you
and your friends  hands   
for every day that passes
without payment 
and then when you
run out of digits   
your dad s bar 
and who knows what then 
all right  my son 
i ve been thinking about
what you have done to me
the damage is much deeper
then you ll ever see
hit me like
a hammer to my head   
this doesn t look good 
i wonder  were you pushed
or were you led 
he then proceeded to explain   
the unfortunate position
they were in 
harry was going to start   
sizing up
all their fingers in a week   
because he knew
there was no way   
ed could settle
that debt on his own 
harry saw it
as their money on the table   
so it was also their debt
off the table 
ed would hate to admit it   
but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that 
if he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own   
it would have been a lie 
now  i wish to christ   
he would have let me
settle the debt on my own 
i m going to kill him 
stop fucking about  tom   
and think about
what we re going to do 
now  sit down 
what s all the fuss
about harry 
why don t we just
boycott the payment 
let me tell you
about hatchet harry 
once there was this geezer   
called smithy robinson
who worked for harry 
it was rumored
that he was on the take 
harry s invited smithy around
for an explanation 
smithy didn t do
a very good job 
within a minute 
harry s lost his rag   
reached out for
the nearest thing at hand   
which happened to be a
fifteen inch black rubber cock 
he then proceeded to batter
poor smithy to death with it 
now  that was seen
as a pleasant way to go 
hence  hatchet harry
is a man you pay if you owe 
don t worry 
i ll think of something 
i ve been thinking about
what you have done to me
the damage is much deeper
then you ll ever see
hit me like a hammer to my head
i wonder  were you pushed 
or were you led 
why did you do it 
why did you do that thing to me 
golf    the best way
to spoil a good walk 
winston churchill said that 
i say it s a dog eat dog world 
and i ve got bigger teeth
then you two

to tell us something

listen to this one 
you open up a company   
called  ass ticklers
faggots fan club

in the back page
of some gay mag

can do until now 
 the latest and greatest
in sexual technology 
 guaranteed results
or your money back  
all that bollocks 
these dils
cost twenty five quid a pop 
that s a snip
for the amount of pleasure   
they re going to give
the recipients 
but they send their checks   
to the other company name 
nothing offensive   
 bobbie s bits  or something   
for twenty five quid 
you take that
twenty five quid   
you stick it in the bank
until it clears 
now  this is the smart bit 
you send back the check
for twenty five pound   
from the other company name   
 ass ticklers
faggots fan club    
saying   we re sorry    
and  we couldn t get
the supplies from america   
 because they ve run
out of stock  
now  you see how many people
cash that check 
not a single soul   
because who wants
their bank manager to know   
they tickle ass when they re
not paying in checks 
so how long do you have to wait
until you see the return 
probably no more
than four weeks 
a month  so what fucking good
is that if we need it in six   
no  five days 
well  it s still a good idea 
he may know we smoke a lot
and burn a bit of profit   
but he can t have any idea   
how much hard currency
we ve accumulated 
i don t know 
do you know 
we can just slice it
off the top 
you guys got to realize
who this chap is 
might look a bit silly 
but he s a fucking lunatic 
and if he gets
the slightest inkling   
we re not throwing
straight dice   
then you and me
are going to know   
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like 
so you know these geezers well 
well enough 
i ve been buying gear off
one of them for a couple years 
what are they like  then 
poofs  nothing heavy 
four public schoolboys 
soft as shite 
they ponce around
in funny hippie clothes   
all day talking bollocks 
they re just good
at growing weed  that s all 
business has got bigger
than what they can keep up with 
they can t all be stupid 
can they 
think about it 
they ve got a container load
of cash in shoe boxes 
they re selling class  a  gear 
don t you think there might be
someone sensible involved 
what about security 
there s one
steel gate as you go in   
but they never lock it 
what do you mean  never lock it 
what have they got it there for 
then 
i must have been there
fifty times 
it s never locked 
they re not suspicious 
everyone who goes there
is a toff 
they re into that karma crap 
 if i don t harm nobody 
nobody harms me  stuff 
no way they can get back to you 
even if they could 
they d be too shit scared 
i m a geezer 
they ve got no muscle 
gutless faggots 
fancy one 
what s all the flapping about 
you told the old man yet 
hoping i won t need to 
i ve got a plan 
now  listen carefully 
hello  boys 
harry 
do you want a drink 
hello  my son 
do you want a lolly 
piss off  you nonce 
oi  watch it 
no  thanks  harry 
we re both all right 
nice shooter 
yeah  one of a pair 
holland and holland

four young fellas got in
deeper than they could handle 
they owe me
half a million pound 
how much 
half a million 
i m game 
me  too 
oh  god 
right 
we hit them
as soon as they come back 
we ll be prepared  waiting 
and they re armed 
what was that  armed 
what do you mean  armed 
armed with what 
uh  bad breath  colorful
language  feather duster 
what do you think 
guns  you tit 
guns  you never said
anything about guns 
a minute ago  this was
the safest job in the world 
now it s turning into
a bad day in bosnia 
soap  stop being
such a mincer 
i ve thought about that  and   
and what  exactly 
and    all we have to do
is find out who s carrying them 
they could all be carrying them 
for what we know 
no  only one of them
carries them going to the job   
so i assume the same one   
will be carrying them when
they come back from the job 
you assume  do you 
and what do they say   
about assumption being
the brother of all fuckups 
it s the mother
of all fuckups  stupid 
well  brother  mother 
any other sucker   
it don t make any difference 
they re still fucking guns   
and they still
fire fucking bullets 
soap  if you have
a better idea   
how to get
five hundred thousand pounds   
in the next few days   
let us know 
in the meantime  tom   
you talk to nick the bubble
about shifting the weed 
weed 
no  it s not normal weed 
it s some fucked up
skunk class  a  
i can t think 
let alone move shit 
doesn t sound very good to me 
no  neither me  but it depends
what flicks your switch   
and the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses 
anyway  do you know anyone 
i know a man  yes 
rory breaker 
not that madman with an afro 
i don t want anything
to do with him 
you won t have to 
just get me a sample 
no can do 
what s that 
a place near katmandu 
meet me halfway  mate 
look  it s all completely
chicken soup 
it s what 
it s kosher as christmas 
the jews don t celebrate
christmas  tom 
yeah  well  never mind that 
i m going to need
some artillery  too 
couple of sawn off shotguns 
this is a bit heavy 
this is london  not the lebanon 
who do you think i am 
i think you re nick the greek 
hold those two 
i don t normally have anything
to do with weed  nick   
but if it is
what he says it is   
i ll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key 
that is 
if it is what he says it is 
i don t want to see it
after a sample 
i don t want to touch it
after a sample 
i ll leave you in the capable
hands of nathan here 
he ll sort out the details 
but just let me
tell you one thing 
if the milk turns out
to be sour   
i ain t the kind of pussy
to drink it 
do you know what i mean 
rory breaker 
rory  yeah  i know rory 
he s not to be underestimated 
he s a funny looking fucker 
i know   
but you ve got to
look past the hair   
and the cute  cuddly thing 
it s all a deceptive facade 
a few nights ago   
rory s roger iron rusted   
so he s gone down
the battle cruiser   
to watch the end
of a football game 
no one s watching the custard 
so he switches the channel over 
a fat geezer s north opens   
and he wanders up
and turns the liza over 
 now  fuck off and watch it
somewhere else  
rory knows claret is imminent   
but he doesn t want to miss
the end of the game   
so calm as a coma   
picks up a fire extinguisher   
walks straight past
the jam rolls   
who were ready for action   
and plunks it
outside the entrance 
he then orders an aristotle   
of the most ping pong tiddly
in the nuclear sub   
and switches back to his footer 
 that s fucking it  
says the geezer 
 that s fucking what  
says rory   
and he gobs out a mouthful
of booze  covering fatty 
he flicks a flaming match
into his bird s nest   
and the geezer s lit up
like a leaking gas pipe 
rory  unfazed 
turns back to his game 
his team s won  too  four nil 
oi  is your hair
supposed to look like that 
  all right  short stuff 
  never mind short stuff 
the next time we do
a job like this   
we re going to want more money 
barry   
or we re going back
to post offices and cars 
where s the others 
there was no others 
stop fucking around 
the others  the old ones 
i don t know what you mean 
there were two old guns there 
where are they now 
not in the cabinet 
there wasn t 
there was a couple
of old hammerlock muskets   
the butler was carrying 
but they were ours 
we sold them 
you better
un sell them  sharpish 
we had to sell them 
we needed the money 
i m not fucking interested 
if you don t want to be counting
the fingers you haven t got   
i suggest you get those guns
quick 
jesus 
if i pick them up 
will they stay in one piece 
where did you get them 
i got contacts 
listen  tom 
you point them at me   
i ll shit myself
or do whatever you say to do 
either way 
you get the desired effect 
they look very nice 
i agree  but   
well  they re lacking
in criminal credibility 
i might get laughed at 
how much do you want
for these muskets 
seven hundred each 
what s that  a pound for
every year they ve been about 
i know they re antiques   
but i ain t paying
antique prices 
they re a bit long  ain t they 
sawn offs are out  people want
a bit more range these days 
range 
i don t want to blow the ass
out of this country  granted   
but i don t want anyone blowing
a raspberry at me  either 
i want to look fucking mean 
of course you ll look mean 
you ll look really scary 
anyway  enough about that 
what about this geezer
who sells drugs 
rory breaker s standing by 
you stand to make a lot
of money  tubby tommy 
i understand if this
has come as a bit of a shock   
but let me tell you
how this can be resolved   
by you  the good father 
go on 
he likes your bar 
yes 
he wants your bar 
and 
do you want me
to draw you a picture 
that boy doesn t know
his asshole from his earhole 
this is my bar 
it s got nothing to do with him 
what  and i care 
remember  you do have
the luxurious advantage   
of being able to sustain
your son s life 
and you do have a reputation   
so i choose my words
very carefully 
you tell harry
to go fuck himself 
now   
i ll put that down to shock   
only once 
only once can i or shall i
let you get away with that 
your son s got three days
to find half a mil 
but make up your mind
which you prefer   
your bar or your son 
plank goes in first 
there s a cage  but it s
never locked  is it  plank 
never 
it don t want to be 
once he s got himself set 
he gets the rest of us in 
now we get nasty
with a couple of them   
shoot them up  gag them 
whatever 
these wankers shouldn t
give us any problems   
but like any cowboys   
there will be a few tools
lying around 
when the job s done   
we come straight back here
and unload   
and robert s
your father s brother 
everyone savvy 
  sweet 
  sweet 
have a look at these 
and what are we supposed
to do with these 
put them on your head  stupid 
christ 
if you think i m going to
turn up there clean shaven   
and greet them
with a grin on my face   
you got another thing coming 
now  these fellas 
they re your neighbors 
i thought it might
be a good idea   
to disguise ourselves a little 
right  uh  yeah 
good thinking  soap  well done 
i brought weapons  as well 
weapons 
what do you mean  weapons 
these 
jesus 
let s keep them covered up  eh 
couldn t you have gotten
anything a bit bigger 
what  like that 
what do you think 
i think you need help 
bar steward  can we have
a couple of drinks  please 
have you seen your dad 
hatchet sent
one of his men round 
oh  shit  when 
crazy   
where did you get these 
a fucking museum 
nick the greek  pow 
how much did you part with 
seven hundred for the pair 
drachmas  i hope 
i d feel safer
with a chicken drumstick 
these are going to do
more harm than good 
jesus  tom  do these work 
don t know 
look nice  though  don t they 
i rather like them 
that s top of the list
of priorities  that is 
ladies 
back to more important issues 
if you don t mind 
we have only got two real guns 
apparently 
that s what they are 
so we find a good place
to hide next door 
we wait till it sounds
like the right time   
then we jack in the box 
look nasty and stuff   
cocoon them in gaffer tape   
nick their van  swap the gear
into the new van   
and bring it all back here 
as long as we re all out of
our hiding places quickly   
it s the last thing
they re going to expect 
oh  and if tom or anyone else 
for that matter   
feels like giving them
a bit of a kicking   
i m sure it won t do any harm 
yeah  a little bit of pain
never hurt anybody   
if you know what i mean 
also  i think
knives are a good idea   
big fuck off shiny ones   
ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile 
knives are good because
they don t make any noise   
and the less noise they make   
the more likely we are
to use them 
shit them right up 
makes it look
like we re serious 
guns for show  knives for a pro 
soap  is there something
we should know about you 
i m not sure
what s more worrying   
the job or your past

that s it  we re off 
  i m gonna take these guns 
  tom  don t fuck about 
it ll only take a minute 
what is going on 
i don t know  but i do know
there s no more harry 
which means
there s no more debt 
if there s no more debt 
there s no more problem 
and there s no problem with the
neighbours   they re all dead 
and i think 
if i get this right 
we haven t done anything wrong
and we re in the clear 
never ever   
has anyone
been as fucking rude   
  to me as you 
you fucking   bastard 
all right  mate 
cheeky bastard 
 this was an embarrassing
position for tom to be in 
 but chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding
 what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns 
 tom had to respect the fact
they were not loaded 
 so without anybody
losing too much face 
 tom left through a side door
and chris left with the money 
 everybody else got arrested  
0dds  chaps 
gotta remember the odds 
he s not one of  em 
  sitting in the cheap seats
underneath the stiles
  i m heading back to base
  i ll drop you off
at my house  
your dad would like
a word with you  ed 
where are the others 
they got out yesterday 
they re at the bar 
all right  dad 
i m all right 
how about yourself 
i m all right 
could do with a drink  though 
all in good time 
so  are you in the clear 
more importantly   am i 
it appears so 
appears  you ll have to do
better than fucking appears 
well  everybody s dead  dad 
that s about as clear
as it can get 
how about that drink 
you know where the bar is 
eh 
don t make yourself
too comfortable 
alan s got to sit there 
alan 
you re lucky
you re still breathing 
let alone able to walk 
i suggest you take
full advantage of that fact 
you took your time 
where the hell have you been 
sit down  i ll tell you 
the traffic warden identified
the neighbours  bodies 
which sort of
puts us in the clear 
the only thing connecting us
with the case   
  is those shotguns 
and tom took care of them 
you did take care of the shotguns 
i wanted to talk about that 
well  talk 
well  actually   no 
they re in the car 
i was gonna sell  em to nick 
but i couldn t get hold of him 
you dippy bastard 
so   the only thing
connecting us with the case
is in the back of your car 
which is parked outside  
they cost 700 quid 
i m not gonna throw  em away 
they re hardly likely to trace
 em back to us  are they 
you think it s worth
the risk for  700 
tom  you re a dick 
take those guns
and throw  em off a bridge 
and yourself while you re at it 
now 
look  all i m   
now  tom 
can i have a beer  please  dad 
i m busy  get it yourself 
it seemed hatchet
underestimated you lot 
and it seems to have cost him 
i ain t gonna make
the same mistake  am i 
so i ve decided
to bring your bag back 
i think the word you re looking
for  gentlemen  is  thank you  
thank you 
you ve presented me
with a problem 
i ve lost my employer 
so i ve taken care
of meself and me son 
if you think that s unfair 
pay me a little visit 
but you better be
waving a white flag 
high and clear
so as i can see it 
0r it ll be the last
visit you ever make  understand 
that s all i ve come to say 
there is one more thing   
it s been emotional 
   fool s gold 
by the stone roses
  the gold road s
sure a long road
  winds on through the hills
for fifteen days  
we are now officially in
the money lending business  son 
put your seatbelt on 
we re out of here 
it s empty 
  the pack on my back is aching
  the straps seem
to cut me like a knife
  i m no clown
i won t back down
  i don t need you to tell me
what s going down    
what s his number 
you ll jam the line 
i ll call him 
my fucking batteries 
  you muppet 
  give me the phone 
  i ll dial it 
  tell me the number 
  give me your phone 
  you ll break it 
you ll break it
