so i need a car
and i know
that im getting alive
and i say i got faith
and a season
and i say thats
where im going to
ed can hustle
a few quid here and there
but his real talent lies in
cards and gambling with cards
bacon could see that his days
of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered
its time to move on
and he knows it
so i said im on the roam
so i need a car
and i know
that im staying alive
and i know
that im staying alive
and i know
that my faith is in season
and i say
what are you talking about
im bloody skinny pal

all right
nick the greek

tom what have you been eating
ive been telling him this
enough already
you two join me in my office
so how much is it tom
you know how much it is nick
that includes the amp
no that does not
include the amp
shit tom
i thought it included the amp
well it doesnt
ill throw in
one of these telephones
but it does not
include the amp
very nice
i hope it includes the speakers
it doesnt include the speakers
it doesnt include the amp
and its not supposed
to include me
getting the hump
with your stupid questions
now you want it nick
you buy it
what else do i get with it
a goldplated rollsroyce
as long as you pay for it
dont know tom
seems expensive
seems well this seems to be
a waste of my time
that is nine hundred nicker
in any shop
youre lucky enough
to find one in
and youre complaining
about two hundred
what school of finance
did you study
its a deal its a steal
its sale
of the fucking century
in fact fuck it nick
i think ill keep it
all right all right
keep your alans on
heres a ton
jesus christ
jesus christ
you could choke
a dozen donkeys on that
and youre haggling
over one hundred pound
what do you do when youre not
buying stereos nick
finance revolutions
one hundred pounds
is still one hundred pounds
not when the price is
two hundred pounds its not
and certainly not
when youve got
liberias deficit
in your skyrocket
tighter than a ducks butt
you are
come on let me feel
the fiber of your fabric
the skinny one is tom
and hes the entrepreneur
of the bunch
hes got a couple
of dirty little fingers
in a couple of dirty
little pies
nick here however
has made it his business
to have all twenty
fat little fingers and toes
in every dirty bent
and stolen pie in london
between the two of them
there aint much
you cant get ahold of
thats my twentyfive grand
its all there
it took me a long time
to earn that
so you treat it with respect
what about the chef
what have you come as
cupid stupid
thats the last time im getting
any more fruit off of you tom
do you call that fresh
there was more small hairy
armored things in your fruit
then there was fruit
you should open a butchers
not a grocers
if you will order stuff
from katmandu
dont be surprised if it picks
up a few tourists en route
anyway enough about that
wheres the money
oi keep your fingers
out of my soup
soap is called soap
because he likes
to keep his hands clean
of any unlawful behavior
hes proud of his job and even
more proud that its legal
he represents the more
sensible side of the four
you sure you can
afford twentyfive
that depends
on how you look at it
i can afford it
as long as i see it again
got the rest
from the fat man and bacon
fat man bacon and myself
looks like its time
to make that call to harry
whos this fat man then eh
eh
do you want a sandwich bacon
its not easy to take a seat
at this card table
the amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards
and theres no shortage
of punters
the man who decides
whether you can play or not
is this man harry
or as some including himself
like to call him hatchet harry
you got it all
one hundred grand
well if you got it
you got it
now if you dont mind
whats this eddie like then
hes a fucking thief
harry has a colleague
a monster of a man
barry the baptist
the baptist got his name
by drowning people for hatchet
are you going to fucking pay
yeah ill pay i said ill pay
aah
barry makes sure
the administrative side of
the business runs harmoniously
the boys got a rare ability
he seems to make cards
transparent
all right all right
so we can say hes good
oh no
hes better than good
hes a fucking liability
here hold on
what do you think of these
were selling hundreds
very nice harry
whats it for
oh dont play innocent
with me bazza
spanking
twentyfive from me
tom soap and yourself
its a hundred grand
to the pound
so why the fuck
are you counting it
because i like to
a reasonable return should
be in the region of 120 grand
thats for 25 grand invested
going on previous experience
going on optimism
whatever its going on
it should be enough
to send you on a cooking course
youre not funny tom
youre fat and look as though
you should be but youre not
fat who are you calling
jesus
its good in here isnt it
handy for the tube
great electrics
i can see why you moved in
dont knock it
its cheap like the budgie
nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to
a bit antisocial
to say the least
what do you mean
he means
theyre thieving bastards
i mean when theyre not
picking peanuts out of poop
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their hardearned drugs
not exactly thick these walls
nice work
get yourself a drink

and now i wanna be your dog
and now i wanna be your dog
well come on
hello boy
feeling a bit poorly
i know your friends
are responsible
for most of the cash
so im going to give you
one week to find it
otherwise
i will take a finger
off each of you
and your friends hands
for every day that passes
without payment
and then when you
run out of digits
your dads bar
and who knows what then
all right my son
ive been thinking about
what you have done to me
the damage is much deeper
then youll ever see
hit me like
a hammer to my head
this doesnt look good
i wonder were you pushed
or were you led
he then proceeded to explain
the unfortunate position
they were in
harry was going to start
sizing up
all their fingers in a week
because he knew
there was no way
ed could settle
that debt on his own
harry saw it
as their money on the table
so it was also their debt
off the table
ed would hate to admit it
but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that
if he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own
it would have been a lie
now i wish to christ
he would have let me
settle the debt on my own
im going to kill him
stop fucking about tom
and think about
what were going to do
now sit down
whats all the fuss
about harry
why dont we just
boycott the payment
let me tell you
about hatchet harry
once there was this geezer
called smithy robinson
who worked for harry
it was rumored
that he was on the take
harrys invited smithy around
for an explanation
smithy didnt do
a very good job
within a minute
harrys lost his rag
reached out for
the nearest thing at hand
which happened to be a
fifteeninch black rubber cock
he then proceeded to batter
poor smithy to death with it
now that was seen
as a pleasant way to go
hence hatchet harry
is a man you pay if you owe
dont worry
ill think of something
ive been thinking about
what you have done to me
the damage is much deeper
then youll ever see
hit me like a hammer to my head
i wonder were you pushed
or were you led
why did you do it
why did you do that thing to me
golf the best way
to spoil a good walk
winston churchill said that
i say its a dogeatdog world
and ive got bigger teeth
then you two
i think our friend is trying
to tell us something
perhaps not
perhaps i should take another
swing just to make sure
give me a fiveiron john
certainly dog
now keep still
yes gordon is there something
youd like to tell us
its in the fireplace
shut it you idiot hell aah
yes gordon
you were saying
its in the fireplace
just pull it out
its in the bottom
its in the fireplace plank
just pull it out
its in the bottom
oh dog i think you want
to have a look at this
you going to let me down now

steel

oh dog
who the hell is that
its only twelve oclock

thats what its there for
who is it
we have got security
for a reason willie
chill winston

stay out of the way
how much is it you want
im after a half weight
right well thats
fifteen hundred then
pass the scales willie
give us some gear j
any chance of actually
seeing the uh money
the odds are a hundred to one
all as we need is five grand
id rather put my money
on a threelegged rocking horse
the odds are a hundred to one
for a good reason bacon
it wont win
wheres eddie
where do you think
the bottom of a bottle
and has been for two days
its hit him hard
its hit us all hard
yeah but hes got
to tell his dad
hes about to lose his bar
listen to this one
you open up a company
called ass ticklers
faggots fan club
you take out an advert
in the back page
of some gay mag
advertising the latest
in assintruding dildos
you sell it with
i dont know
does what no other dildo
can do until now
the latest and greatest
in sexual technology
guaranteed results
or your money back
all that bollocks
these dils
cost twentyfive quid a pop
thats a snip
for the amount of pleasure
theyre going to give
the recipients
but they send their checks
to the other company name
nothing offensive
bobbies bits or something
for twentyfive quid
you take that
twentyfive quid
you stick it in the bank
until it clears
now this is the smart bit
you send back the check
for twentyfive pound
from the other company name
ass ticklers
faggots fan club
saying were sorry
and we couldnt get
the supplies from america
because theyve run
out of stock
now you see how many people
cash that check
not a single soul
because who wants
their bank manager to know
they tickle ass when theyre
not paying in checks
so how long do you have to wait
until you see the return
probably no more
than four weeks
a month so what fucking good
is that if we need it in six
no five days
well its still a good idea
he may know we smoke a lot
and burn a bit of profit
but he cant have any idea
how much hard currency
weve accumulated
i dont know
do you know
we can just slice it
off the top
you guys got to realize
who this chap is
might look a bit silly
but hes a fucking lunatic
and if he gets
the slightest inkling
were not throwing
straight dice
then you and me
are going to know
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like
so you know these geezers well
well enough
ive been buying gear off
one of them for a couple years
what are they like then
poofs nothing heavy
four public schoolboys
soft as shite
they ponce around
in funny hippie clothes
all day talking bollocks
theyre just good
at growing weed thats all
business has got bigger
than what they can keep up with
they cant all be stupid
can they
think about it
theyve got a containerload
of cash in shoe boxes
theyre selling class a gear
dont you think there might be
someone sensible involved
what about security
theres one
steel gate as you go in
but they never lock it
what do you mean never lock it
what have they got it there for
then
i must have been there
fifty times
its never locked
theyre not suspicious
everyone who goes there
is a toff
theyre into that karma crap
if i dont harm nobody
nobody harms me stuff
no way they can get back to you
even if they could
theyd be too shit scared
im a geezer
theyve got no muscle
gutless faggots
fancy one
whats all the flapping about
you told the old man yet
hoping i wont need to
ive got a plan
now listen carefully
hello boys
harry

a minute ago this was
the safest job in the world

a bad day in bosnia

ive thought about that and
and what exactly
and all we have to do
is find out whos carrying them
they could all be carrying them
for what we know
no only one of them
carries them going to the job
so i assume the same one
will be carrying them when
they come back from the job
you assume do you
and what do they say
about assumption being
the brother of all fuckups
its the mother
of all fuckups stupid
well brother mother
any other sucker

and the cute cuddly thing
its all a deceptive facade
a few nights ago
rorys roger iron rusted
so hes gone down
the battle cruiser
to watch the end
of a football game
no ones watching the custard
so he switches the channel over
a fat geezers north opens
and he wanders up
and turns the liza over
now fuck off and watch it
somewhere else
rory knows claret is imminent
but he doesnt want to miss
the end of the game
so calm as a coma
picks up a fire extinguisher
walks straight past
the jam rolls
who were ready for action
and plunks it
outside the entrance
he then orders an aristotle
of the most pingpong tiddly
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer
thats fucking it
says the geezer
thats fucking what
says rory
and he gobs out a mouthful
of booze covering fatty
he flicks a flaming match
into his birds nest
and the geezers lit up
like a leaking gas pipe
rory unfazed
turns back to his game
his teams won too fournil
oi is your hair
supposed to look like that
all right short stuff
never mind short stuff
the next time we do
a job like this
were going to want more money
barry
or were going back
to post offices and cars
wheres the others
there was no others
stop fucking around
the others the old ones
i dont know what you mean
there were two old guns there
where are they now
not in the cabinet
there wasnt
there was a couple
of old hammerlock muskets
the butler was carrying
but they were ours
we sold them
you better
unsell them sharpish
we had to sell them
we needed the money
im not fucking interested
if you dont want to be counting
the fingers you havent got
i suggest you get those guns
quick
jesus
if i pick them up
will they stay in one piece
where did you get them
i got contacts
listen tom
you point them at me
ill shit myself
or do whatever you say to do
either way
you get the desired effect
they look very nice
i agree but
well theyre lacking
in criminal credibility
i might get laughed at
how much do you want
for these muskets
seven hundred each
whats that a pound for
every year theyve been about
i know theyre antiques
but i aint paying
antique prices
theyre a bit long aint they
sawnoffs are out people want
a bit more range these days
range
i dont want to blow the ass
out of this country granted
but i dont want anyone blowing
a raspberry at me either
i want to look fucking mean
of course youll look mean
youll look really scary
anyway enough about that
what about this geezer
who sells drugs
rory breakers standing by
you stand to make a lot
of money tubby tommy
i understand if this
has come as a bit of a shock
but let me tell you
how this can be resolved
by you the good father
go on
he likes your bar
yes
he wants your bar
and
do you want me
to draw you a picture
that boy doesnt know
his asshole from his earhole
this is my bar
its got nothing to do with him
what and i care
remember you do have
the luxurious advantage
of being able to sustain
your sons life
and you do have a reputation
so i choose my words
very carefully
you tell harry
to go fuck himself
now
ill put that down to shock
only once
only once can i or shall i
let you get away with that
your sons got three days
to find half a mil
but make up your mind
which you prefer
your bar or your son
plank goes in first
theres a cage but its
never locked is it plank
never
it dont want to be
once hes got himself set
he gets the rest of us in
now we get nasty
with a couple of them
shoot them up gag them
whatever
these wankers shouldnt
give us any problems
but like any cowboys
there will be a few tools
lying around
when the jobs done
we come straight back here
and unload
and roberts
your fathers brother
everyone savvy
sweet
sweet
have a look at these
and what are we supposed
to do with these
put them on your head stupid
christ
if you think im going to
turn up there cleanshaven
and greet them
with a grin on my face
you got another thing coming
now these fellas
theyre your neighbors
i thought it might
be a good idea
to disguise ourselves a little
right uh yeah
good thinking soap well done
i brought weapons as well
weapons
what do you mean weapons
these
jesus
lets keep them covered up eh
couldnt you have gotten
anything a bit bigger
what like that
what do you think
i think you need help
bar steward can we have
a couple of drinks please
have you seen your dad
hatchet sent
one of his men round
oh shit when
crazy
where did you get these
a fucking museum
nick the greek pow
how much did you part with
seven hundred for the pair
drachmas i hope
id feel safer
with a chicken drumstick
these are going to do
more harm than good
jesus tom do these work
dont know
look nice though dont they
i rather like them
thats top of the list
of priorities that is
ladies
back to more important issues
if you dont mind
we have only got two real guns
apparently
thats what they are
so we find a good place
to hide next door
we wait till it sounds
like the right time
then we jackinthebox
look nasty and stuff
cocoon them in gaffer tape
nick their van swap the gear
into the new van
and bring it all back here
as long as were all out of
our hiding places quickly
its the last thing
theyre going to expect
oh and if tom or anyone else
for that matter
feels like giving them
a bit of a kicking
im sure it wont do any harm
yeah a little bit of pain
never hurt anybody
if you know what i mean
also i think
knives are a good idea
big fuckoff shiny ones
ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile
knives are good because
they dont make any noise
and the less noise they make
the more likely we are
to use them
shit them right up
makes it look
like were serious
guns for show knives for a pro
soap is there something
we should know about you
im not sure
whats more worrying
the job or your past
come on girls
where the fuck
are they going
shift a piano

meant to be a robbery
where did they get
those outfits
not a bad idea that
all right its plank

hes out at the moment
perhaps you can help
well perhaps i cant plank

we havent done anything wrong
and were in the clear
never ever
has anyone
been as fucking rude
to me as you
you fuckingbastard
all right mate
cheeky bastard
this was an embarrassing
position for tom to be in
but chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding
what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns
tom had to respect the fact
they were not loaded
so without anybody
losing too much face
tom left through a side door
and chris left with the money
everybody else got arrested
0dds chaps
gotta remember the odds
hes not one of em
sitting in the cheap seats
underneath the stiles
im heading back to base
ill drop you off
at my house
your dad would like
a word with you ed
where are the others
they got out yesterday
theyre at the bar
all right dad
im all right
how about yourself
im all right
could do with a drink though
all in good time
so are you in the clear
more importantlyam i
it appears so
appears youll have to do
better than fucking appears
well everybodys dead dad
thats about as clear
as it can get
how about that drink
you know where the bar is
eh
dont make yourself
too comfortable
alans got to sit there
alan
youre lucky
youre still breathing
let alone able to walk
i suggest you take
full advantage of that fact
you took your time
where the hell have you been
sit down ill tell you
the traffic warden identified
the neighbours bodies
which sort of
puts us in the clear
the only thing connecting us
with the case
is those shotguns
and tom took care of them
you did take care of the shotguns
i wanted to talk about that
well talk
well actuallyno
theyre in the car
i was gonna sell em to nick
but i couldnt get hold of him
you dippy bastard
sothe only thing
connecting us with the case
is in the back of your car
which is parked outside
they cost 700 quid
im not gonna throw em away
theyre hardly likely to trace
em back to us are they
you think its worth
the risk for 700
tom youre a dick
take those guns
and throw em off a bridge
and yourself while youre at it
now
look all im
now tom
can i have a beer please dad
im busy get it yourself
it seemed hatchet
underestimated you lot
and it seems to have cost him
i aint gonna make
the same mistake am i
so ive decided
to bring your bag back
i think the word youre looking
for gentlemen is thank you
thank you
youve presented me
with a problem
ive lost my employer
so ive taken care
of meself and me son
if you think thats unfair

but you better be
waving a white flag

visit you ever make understand
