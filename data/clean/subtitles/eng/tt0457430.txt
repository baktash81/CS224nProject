armed men are still fighting
the new fascist regime
military posts are established
to exterminate the resistance
a long time ago
in the underground realm
where there are no lies or pain
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world
she dreamt of blue skies
soft breeze and sunshine
one day
eluding her keepers
the princess escaped
once outside
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory
she forgot who she was
and where she came from
her body suffered cold sickness and pain
and eventually she died
however her father the king
always knew that the princess soul
would return
perhaps in another body
in another place at another time
he would wait for her
until he drew his last breath
until the world stopped turning
why did you bring
so many books ofelia
were going to the country
the outdoors
fairy tales
youre a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense
ask him to stop the car
ofelia wait
your brothers not well
madam are you okay
ofelia
ofelia come here
i saw a fairy

to track them up there
those bastards know the terrain

captain vidal is waiting
for you in his office

you were never alone
when youre older youll understand
it hasnt been easy for me either
your brothers at it again
tell him one of your stories
im sure thatll calm down
my brother my brother
many many years ago
in a sad faraway land
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough black stone
at sunset
on top of that mountain
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal
but no one dared go near it
because its thorns were full of poison
men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death
and pain but never about the promise
of eternal life
and every day the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold dark mountain
forever alone until the end of time
come in
how is she
very weak
shell have as much rest
as as she needs
ill sleep down here
and my son
pardon
excuse us captain
my son how is he
for the moment theres no
reason to be alarmed
very good
captain your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy
is that your opinion
my professional opinion yes sir
a son should be born
wherever his father is
thats all
one more thing captain
what makes you so sure
the baby is a male
dont fuck with me
at 8 oclock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector
gunfire
sergeant bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect
the other ones his son
here from the town
captain my father
is an honest man
let me judge that
take your hat off in front of me
we found this weapon on him
its been fired
my father was hunting
rabbits captain
again keep quiet
no god no country no master

red prpaganda captain
its not propaganda sir
its an old almanac captain

to hunt for rabbits
for my daughters theyre sick
rabbits uh
captain if my father says so
he was hunting rabbits

these assholes properly
before you come bothering me

your most humble servant
your highness
no im
youre princess moanna
daughter of the king
of the underworld
my father was a tailor
you are not born of man
it was the moon that bore you
look on your left shoulder
and you will find a mark
that proves it
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return
this is
this is the last of them
but we have to make sure
that your essence is intact
that you have not become a mortal
you must complete three tasks
before the moon is full
this is the book of crossroads
open it when you are alone
and it will show you your future
show you what must be done
but theres nothing in here
mercedes prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight
they are too young
well maybe theyll do for a stew
yes sir
this coffee was burnt
taste it yourself
you should keep an eye on it
as you wish sir

he didnt like the coffee
hes nothing but a fussy dandy
a fussy dandy
were going to need some beef
and one more chicken
where are we supposed to find that
the doctors wife the mayors too
well they eat more
than a couple of pigs
and they dont shut up
not even underwater
ill be back in a moment
mercedes
ofelia

a dinner party tonight

mercedes
do you believe in fairies
no
but when i was a little girl
i did
i believed in a lot of things
i dont believe any more
last night
a fairy visited me
really
and it wasnt alone
there were lots of them
and a faun too
a faun
he was very old very tall
and smelled like earth
my mother warned me
to be wary of fauns
mercedes
come with me
captain
everything is here
flour salt oil medicine
olives bacon
thisthis is real tobacco
and the ration cards
i need you to check the inventory
very well
mercedes
the key
yes sir
is this the only copy
the only one
from now on ill carry it
captain
captain
perhaps its nothing
its them
once upon a time
when the forest was young
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder
they protected one another
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree
that grew on a hill near the mill
but now the tree is dying
its branches are dry
its trunk old and twisted
a monstrous toad
has settled in its roots
and wont let the tree thrive
you must put the three magic
stones in the toads mouth
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly
only then will the fig tree
flourish again
they were here
less than twenty minutes ago
they left in a hurry
a dozen men at most
antibiotics
shit they forgot this lottery ticket
theyre here
those sons of bitches are here
and theyre watching us
hey
you left this behind
and your lottery ticket
why dont you come back
and get it
who knows
this could be your lucky day
hello
im princess moanna
and im not afraid of you
arent you ashamed
living down here
eating all these bugs
and growing fat
while the tree dies
have you looked in her room
and the pantry
yes maam
have you checked the garden
and the barn
yes maam
where is that girl
this way please
let me to introduce you
to my wife carmen
charmed
a pleasure to meet you
from now on
one ration card per family
take a look
one
only one
captain im not sure
itll be enough
if people are careful
it should be plenty
we cant allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains
theyre losing ground
and one of them is wounded
excuse me captain
how can you be so sure
we almost got them
we found this
antibiotics
god has already
saved their souls
what happens to their bodies
hardly matter to him
well help however we can captain
we know youre not here by choice
youre wrong about that
i choose to be here because i want
my son to be born in a new clean spain
because these people
hold the mistaken belief
that were all equal
but theres a big difference
the war is over and we won
and if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it
then well kill them all
and thats that
were all here by choice
by choice
put the coffee on
im going for more wood
well take care of it
ofelia
so how did you
and the captain meet
ofelias father used to make
the captains uniforms
oh i see
and after he died
i went to work at the shop
a little more than a year ago
the captain and i met again
curious isnt it
i mean finding each other again
oh yes
very very curious
please forgive my wife
she hasnt been exposed to the world
she thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others
we understand
excuse me madam
ofelia is here
excuse me
have i told you that i was acquainted
with your father captain
no
i had no idea
in morocco
i knew him only briefly
but he left a great impression
an excellent soldier
the men in his battalion said that
when general vidal died on the battlefield
he smashed his watch on a rock
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death
so he would know
how a brave man dies
nonsense
he didnt own a watch
what youve done hurts me
after your bath
youll go to bed without supper
are you listening
sometimes i think
youll never learn to behave
youve disappointed me ofelia
and your father too
you mean the captain
him more than me
ive got the key
take me to the labyrinth
hello
i got the key out
thats me
and the girl is you
and the baby
so you retrieved the key
im glad
she believed in you
from the very beginning
shes so glad you succeeded
keep the key
youll be needing it very soon
and this too
a piece of chalk
two tasks remain
and the moon is almost full
be patient
well soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace
how do i know
that what you say is true
why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you
proceed
have your cards
ready for inspection
lets go
your name
your names first and last
narciso pena soriano
at your service
this is our daily bread
in francos spain
kept safe in this mill
the reds lie
because in a united spain
theres not a single home
without fire or bread
come on show me
what happens now
show me
ofelia help me
captain captain
come quickly
because in a united spain
theres not a single home
without fire or bread

somewhere else
ill stay here until the birth
make her well
i dont care what it costs
or what you need

when that man finds out about us
hell kill us all
have you thought about that
are you so afraid of him doctor
its not fear
at least not for myself
pedro
pedro my brother
you didnt carry out the task
no my mother is sick
thats no excuse
for negligence
look
this is a mandrake root
a plant that dreamt
of being human
put it under your mothers bed
in a bowl of fresh milk
each morning
give it two drops of blood
now we have no time
to waste
the full moon will be upon us
take my pets
to guide you through
youre going to a very dangerous
place so be careful
the thing that slumbers there
it is not human
you will see
a sumptuous feast
but dont eat
or drink anything
absolutely nothing
your life depends on it
ive brought some orujo
tobacco cheese

dont eat or drink anything
during your stay
and come back

god only knows what they wanted
other than to waste our time
they came out of nowhere captain

to tell us everything
but to make sure it happens
i brought along a few tools

along the way
at first i wont be able to trust you
but after i use this
youll own up to a few things
when we get to these
well have developed
how can i put this
a closer bond
much like brothers

i thought no one would notice
weve made a mistake
a mistake
you failed
you can never return
it was an accident
you cannot return
the moon will be full in three days
your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans
you shall age like them
you shall die like them
and all memory of you
shall fade in time
and well vanish along with it
you will never see us again
good day doctor

ferreiro

was hiding under your bed
what do you think of this
ofelia what is this thing doing
under the bed
its a magic root
the faun gave me
this is all because of thatjunk
you let her read
look what youve done
please leave us alone
ill talk to her darling

ofelia you have to listen
to your father
you have to stop all this
no i want to leave this place
please take me away from here
lets just go please
things are not that simple
youre getting older
soon youll see that life
isnt like your fairy tales
the world is a cruel place
and youll learn that
even if it hurts
no no
ofelia
magic does not exist
not for you me or anyone else
mom help
help
help
why did you do it
it was the only thing i could do
no you could have obeyed me
i could have but i didnt
it would have been better for you
you know it
i dont understand
why didnt you obey me
to obeyjust like thatfor the sake
of obeying without questioning
thats something only people
like you can do captain
captain
garces call the troop paramedic
get up immediately
yes captain
your wife is dead
because the paths to the lord
are inscrutable
because the essence
of his forgiveness
lies in his word
and in his mystery
because although god
sends us the message
it is our task to decipher it
because when we open our arms
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell
far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory
because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life
and the state of grace
that we lose when we are born
because god in his infinite wisdom
puts the solution in our hands
and because it is only
in his physical absence
that the place he occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed
you knew
dr ferreiro pretty well
didnt you mercedes
we all knew him sir
everyone around here
the stutterer spoke of an informer
here at the mill
can you imagine
right under my nose
mercedes please
what must you think of me
you must think that
im a monster
it doesnt matter
what someone like me thinks sir
i want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor please
yes sir
goodnight sir
mercedes
arent you forgetting something
sir
the key
i do have the only copy dont i
yes sir
you know theres an odd detail
thats been bothering me
maybe its not important but
the day they broke into
the storehouse
with all those grenades
and explosives
the lock itself wasnt forced
as i said its probably
not important
be very careful
good night sir
ofelia ofelia
ofelia im leaving tonight

its very simple you will talk
and i have to know
that everything you say is the truth
we have a few things here

ive decided to give you
one last chance
do you promise to do what i say
will you do everything i tell you
without question
this is your last chance
then listen to me
fetch your brother
and bring him to the labyrinth
as quickly as you can
your highness
my brother
we need him
but
no more questions
the doors locked
in that case
create your own door
captain with your permission
come quickly
now what
serrano is back hes wounded
wounded
wheres garces
how many were there
i dont know exactly captain
fifty men at least
the rest of the men didnt make it
our watch posts are not responding
how many men we have left
twenty maybe less sir
were leaving
together
dont be afraid
nothing is going to happen to you
put them on picket duty
at the tree line
if the rest of the squad gets back

radio for reinforcements now
yes captain
leave him
ofelia
quickly your majesty
give him to me
the full moon is high in the sky
we can open the portal
why is that in your hand
the portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent
just a drop of blood
a pinprick thats all
its the final task
hurry
you promised to obey me
give me the boy
no
my brother stays with me
you would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know
yes i would
you would give up
your throne for him
he who has caused you
such misery such humiliation
yes i would
as you wish your highness
no
my son
tell my son
tell him what time his father died
tell him that i
no
he wont even know your name
arise my daughter
come
father
you have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent
that was the final task
and the most important
and you chose well
your highness
come here with me
and sit by your fathers side
hes been waiting for you so long
and it is said the princess
returned to her fathers kingdom
that she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries
