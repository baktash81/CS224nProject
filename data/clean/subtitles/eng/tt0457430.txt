armed men are still fighting
the new fascist regime 
military posts are established
to exterminate the resistance 
a long time ago 
in the underground realm 
where there are no lies or pain 
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world 
she dreamt of blue skies 
soft breeze and sunshine 
one day 
eluding her keepers 
the princess escaped 
once outside   
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory 
she forgot who she was
and where she came from 
her body suffered cold  sickness and pain 
and eventually she died 
however  her father  the king 
always knew that the princess  soul
would return 
perhaps in another body 
in another place  at another time 
he would wait for her 
until he drew his last breath 
until the world stopped turning 
why did you bring
so many books  ofelia 
we re going to the country 
the outdoors 
fairy tales 
you re a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense 
ask him to stop the car 
ofelia  wait 
your brother s not well 
madam  are you okay 
ofelia 
ofelia  come here 
  i saw a fairy

i want you to call him father

how good he s been to us 
it s just a word  ofelia   
just a word   
they re coming  captain 
15 minutes late 
carmen

doctor ferreiro prefers
that you don t exert yourself 
no

ofelia  come out 
say hello to the captain 
ofelia 
it s the other hand  ofelia

just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here 
even before the mill 
better not to go in there 
you may get lost 
thank you 
have you read them all 
mercedes 
the captain is calling 
your father needs me 
he s not my father 
the captain is not my father 
my father was a tailor 
he died in the war 
he s not my father 
you ve made that clear enough 
shall we go 
have you seen my mother 
  isn t she beautiful 
  yes 
she s sick with baby 
did you notice 
the guerrillas are sticking
to the woods
because it s hard
to track them up there 
those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us 
we ll block all access
to the woods
food  medicine 
we ll store it all  right here 
we need to force them down 
make them come to us 
we ll set up three
new command posts 
here  here and here 
mercedes 
  ask dr  ferreiro to come down 
  yes  sir 
this will help you sleep
through the night 
just two drops just before bed 
two drops only 
very good 
all of it 
good 
don t hesitate to call me
if you need anything  day or night 
you or your nurse 
good night 
close the door
and turn off the lights  sweetie 
you have to help us 
come up and see him 
the wound is getting worse 
his leg isn t any better 
this is all i could get 
i m sorry 
captain vidal is waiting
for you in his office 
come here  ofelia 
jesus  your feet 
they re frozen 
are you afraid 
a little 
what s that noise 
nothing  just the wind 
nights here are different
from city nights 
there  you hear cars tramway 
here the houses are old 
they creak 
as if they were speaking 
tomorrow  i m going
to give you a surprise 
  a surprise 
  yes 
  a book 
  no  something much better 
why did you have to get married 
i was alone too long 
i m with you 
you weren t alone 
you were never alone 
when you re older  you ll understand 
it hasn t been easy for me either 
your brother s at it again 
tell him one of your stories 
i m sure that ll calm down 
my brother  my brother   
many  many years ago 
in a sad  faraway land 
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough  black stone 
at sunset 
on top of that mountain 
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal 
but no one dared go near it
because its thorns were full of poison 
men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death 
and pain  but never about the promise
of eternal life 
and every day  the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone 
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold  dark mountain 
forever alone  until the end of time 
come in 
  how is she 
  very weak 
she ll have as much rest
as as she needs 
i ll sleep down here 
  and my son 
  pardon 
excuse us  captain 
my son  how is he 
for the moment  there s no
reason to be alarmed 
very good 
captain  your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy 
  is that your opinion 
  my professional opinion  yes  sir 
a son should be born
wherever his father is 
that s all 
one more thing  captain 
what makes you so sure
the baby is a male 
don t fuck with me 
at 8 o clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector 
gunfire 
sergeant bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect 
the other one s his son 
here from the town 
captain  my father
is an honest man 
let me judge that 
take your hat off in front of me 
we found this weapon on him 
it s been fired 
my father was hunting
rabbits  captain 
again  keep quiet 
 no god  no country  no master  
  just like that how do you like that 
  red prpaganda  captain 
it s not propaganda  sir 
it s an old almanac  captain 
we re just farmers 
go on 
i went up into the woods  captain 
to hunt for rabbits 
for my daughters  they re sick 
rabbits  uh 
captain  if my father says so 
he was hunting rabbits 
leave him alone 
you killed him 
you killed him 
murderer 
son of a bitch 
maybe you ll learn to search
these assholes properly
before you come bothering me 
yes  captain 
mother 
mother  wake up 
mother  there s something in the room 
hello 
did you follow me here 
are you a fairy 
look 
this is a fairy 
you want me to go with you 
outside  where 
hello 
hello 
echo 
echo 
hello 
hello 
it s you 
it s you 
you ve returned 
don t be frightened 
i beg you 
look  look 
my name is ofelia 
who are you 
me 
i ve had so many names   
old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce 
i am the mountain 
the forest and the earth 
i am   
i am a faun 
your most humble servant 
your highness 
  no  i m   
  you re princess moanna 
daughter of the king
of the underworld 
my father was a tailor 
you are not born of man 
it was the moon that bore you 
look on your left shoulder
and you will find a mark
that proves it 
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return 
this is   
this is the last of them 
but we have to make sure
that your essence is intact 
that you have not become a mortal 
you must complete three tasks
before the moon is full 
this is the book of crossroads 
open it  when you are alone
and it will show you your future 
show you what must be done 
but there s nothing in here 
mercedes  prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight 
they are too young 
  well  maybe they ll do for a stew 
  yes  sir 
this coffee was burnt 
taste it yourself 
you should keep an eye on it 
as you wish  sir 
cook these 
  he didn t like the coffee 
  he s nothing but a fussy dandy 
a fussy dandy 
we re going to need some beef
and one more chicken 
  where are we supposed to find that 
  the doctor s wife  the mayor s too 
well  they eat more
than a couple of pigs 
  and they don t shut up 
  not even underwater 
i ll be back in a moment 
mercedes 
ofelia 
your father is giving
a dinner party tonight 
look what i ve made for you

to have such a dress   
as fine as this when i was your age 
and look at the shoes 
  do you like them 
  yes  very pretty 
go on  now 
take your bath 
ofelia 
ofelia

are cleaned properly 
and don t forget the beans 
  you look marvelous  my girl  just beautiful 
  what a gorgeous dress 
get back to work 
stop wasting time 
do you want some milk with honey 
move back  we can t have you getting
milk on your dress  with you looking so pretty 
mercedes 
do you believe in fairies 
no 
but when i was a little girl 
i did 
i believed in a lot of things
i don t believe any more 
last night 
a fairy visited me 
really 
and it wasn t alone 
there were lots of them 
  and a faun  too 
  a faun 
he was very old  very tall
and smelled like earth 
my mother warned me
to be wary of fauns 
mercedes 
come with me 
captain 
everything is here 
flour  salt  oil  medicine 
olives  bacon 
this this is real tobacco 
and the ration cards 
  i need you to check the inventory 
  very well 
mercedes 
  the key 
  yes  sir 
  is this the only copy 
  the only one 
from now on  i ll carry it 
captain 
captain 
perhaps it s nothing 
it s them 
 once upon a time 
when the forest was young 
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder  
 they protected one another 
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree
that grew on a hill  near the mill  
 but now  the tree is dying 
its branches are dry 
its trunk old and twisted 
a monstrous toad
has settled in its roots
and won t let the tree thrive 
you must put the three magic
stones in the toad s mouth
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly 
only then will the fig tree
flourish again  
they were here
less than twenty minutes ago 
they left in a hurry 
a dozen men  at most 
antibiotics 
shit  they forgot this lottery ticket 
they re here 
those sons of bitches are here 
and they re watching us 
hey 
you left this behind 
and your lottery ticket 
why don t you come back
and get it 
who knows 
this could be your lucky day 
hello 
i m princess moanna 
and i m not afraid of you 
aren t you ashamed
living down here 
eating all these bugs   
and growing fat
while the tree dies 
have you looked in her room 
and the pantry 
yes  ma am 
have you checked the garden 
  and the barn 
  yes  ma am 
where is that girl 
this way  please 
let me to introduce you
to my wife  carmen 
  charmed 
  a pleasure to meet you 
from now on 
one ration card per family 
take a look 
  one 
  only one 
captain  i m not sure
it ll be enough 
if people are careful 
it should be plenty 
we can t allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains 
they re losing ground 
and one of them is wounded 
excuse me  captain 
how can you be so sure 
we almost got them 
we found this 
antibiotics 
god has already
saved their souls 
what happens to their bodies
hardly matter to him 
we ll help however we can  captain 
we know you re not here by choice 
you re wrong about that 
i choose to be here because i want
my son to be born in a new  clean spain 
because these people
hold the mistaken belief
that we re all equal 
but there s a big difference 
the war is over and we won 
and if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it 
then we ll kill them all 
and that s that 
we re all here by choice 
by choice 
put the coffee on 
i m going for more wood 
we ll take care of it 
ofelia 
so  how did you
and the captain meet 
ofelia s father used to make
the captain s uniforms 
oh  i see   
and after he died 
i went to work at the shop 
a little more than a year ago 
the captain and i met again 
curious  isn t it 
i mean  finding each other again 
oh  yes 
very  very curious 
please  forgive my wife 
she hasn t been exposed to the world 
she thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others 
we understand 
excuse me  madam
ofelia is here 
excuse me 
have i told you that i was acquainted
with your father  captain 
no 
i had no idea 
in morocco 
i knew him only briefly 
but he left a great impression 
an excellent soldier 
the men in his battalion said that
when general vidal died on the battlefield 
he smashed his watch on a rock
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death 
so he would know
how a brave man dies 
nonsense 
he didn t own a watch 
what you ve done hurts me 
after your bath 
you ll go to bed without supper 
are you listening 
sometimes i think
you ll never learn to behave 
you ve disappointed me  ofelia 
and your father  too 
you mean the captain 
him more than me 
i ve got the key 
take me to the labyrinth 
hello 
i got the key out 
that s me 
and the girl is you 
and the baby 
so    you retrieved the key 
i m glad 
she believed in you
from the very beginning 
she s so glad you succeeded 
keep the key 
you ll be needing it very soon 
and this too 
a piece of chalk 
two tasks remain
and the moon is almost full 
be patient 
we ll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace 
how do i know
that what you say is true 
why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you 
proceed 
have your cards
ready for inspection 
let s go 
your name 
your names  first and last 
narciso pena soriano 
at your service 
this is our daily bread
in franco s spain 
kept safe in this mill 
the reds lie   
because in a united spain 
there s not a single home
without fire or bread 
come on  show me
what happens now 
show me 
ofelia  help me   
captain  captain 
come quickly 
   because in a united spain 
there s not a single home
without fire or bread 
this is our daily bread
in franco s spain   
your wife needs
uninterrupted rest 
she ll have to be sedated
most of the time 
the girl should sleep
somewhere else 
i ll stay here until the birth 
make her well 
i don t care what it costs
or what you need 
make her well 
don t worry 
your mother will get better soon 
you ll see 
having a baby is complicated 
then i ll never have one 
you re helping the men
in the woods  aren t you 
have you told anyone 
no  i haven t 
i don t want anything bad
to happen to you 
nor i to you 
do you know a lullaby 
only one   
but i don t remember the words 
i don t care 
i still want to hear it 
don t be afraid 
it s only me 
  are you ready 
  yes 
then let s go 
this is sheer madness 
when that man finds out about us 
he ll kill us all 
  have you thought about that 
  are you so afraid of him  doctor 
it s not fear   
at least not for myself 
pedro 
pedro  my brother 
you didn t carry out the task 
no  my mother is sick 
that s no excuse
for negligence 
look   
this is a mandrake root 
a plant that dreamt
of being human 
put it under your mother s bed
in a bowl of fresh milk 
each morning 
give it two drops of blood 
now  we have no time
to waste 
the full moon will be upon us 
take my pets
to guide you through 
you re going to a very dangerous
place  so be careful 
the thing that slumbers there 
it is not human 
you will see
a sumptuous feast 
but don t eat
or drink anything 
absolutely nothing 
your life depends on it 
i ve brought some orujo 
tobacco  cheese 
mail for trigo and piloto 
let s see how that leg s doing 
frenchie 
how do you think it s doing 
it s fucked up 
let s see 
   n  north american 
british and canadian troops

in the north of f f 
   france   idiot 
  f f f rance 
more than 150 000 soldiers
give us hope   
under the command
of general dwight d  eisenhower   
is it really bad  doctor 
look  frenchie 
there s no way to save it 
i ll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible 
wait a second  doctor 
just a second 
 use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room  
 once the door s open 
start the hourglass  
 let the fairies guide you  
 don t eat or drink anything 
during your stay 
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls  
no   
this other one 
no  no 
we ll soon have reinforcements
from jaca 
fifty men or more 
then we ll go head to head with vidal 
and then what 
you kill him  they ll send another
just like him  and another   
you re screwed  no guns 
no safe shelter   
you need food  medicine 
you must take care of mercedes 
if you really love her 
you d cross the border with her 
  this is a lost cause 
  i m staying here  doctor 
there s no choice 
you have to leave 
here s the key 
but you can t go down there now 
it s exactly what he expects 
leave it to me 
i m a coward 
no  you re not 
yes  i am 
a coward    for living
next to that son of a bitch 
doing his laundry  making his bed 
feeding him 
what if the doctor s right
and we can t win 
at least we ll make things
harder for that bastard 
captain vidal   
her temperature s down 
i don t know how  but it is 
but she still has a fever 
yes  but it s a good sign 
her body is responding 
listen to me 
if you have to choose 
save the baby 
that boy will bear my name
and my father s name 
save him 
brother   
little brother   
if you can hear me 
things out here aren t too good 
but soon you ll have to come out 
you ve made mama very sick 
i want to ask you one favor
for when you come out 
just one 
don t hurt her 
you ll meet her 
she s very pretty 
even though sometimes she s sad
for days at a time 
you ll see  when she smiles 
you ll love her 
listen  if you do what i say 
i ll make you a promise 
i ll take you to my kingdom 
and i ll make you a prince 
i promise you  a prince 
i sounded the whistle 
but they wouldn t move 
i tried to stop  but it was too late 
the fireman and i
jumped outjust in time 
but look at the mess they made 
what did they steal
from the freight cars 
they didn t open a single one 
what the hell are you talking about 
this whole mess   
they didn t open any of the cars 
  they didn t take anything 
  nothing  are you sure 
god only knows what they wanted 
other than to waste our time 
they came out of nowhere  captain 
they have grenades 
they went up hill 
captain  we ve surrounded
a small unit that fell behind 
they took cover up on the hill 
go ahead  serrano  don t be afraid 
this is the only decent way to die 
serrano 
let me see 
can you talk 
damn it 
these are useless  they can t talk 
captain 
this one s still alive 
shot in the leg 
  what s happened 
  they caught one 
they took one of them alive 
and they re taking him to the storeroom 
mercedes 
pedro    pedro   
mercedes 
  i need to get into the storeroom 
  not now

we ll be here all night 
as long as he talks 
garces is right 
you d do better
to tell us everything 
but to make sure it happens 
i brought along a few tools 
just things you pick up
along the way 
at first  i won t be able to trust you 
but after i use this 
you ll own up to a few things 
when we get to these 
we ll have developed   
how can i put this  
a closer bond 
much like brothers 
you ll see 
and when we get to this one 
i ll believe anything you tell me 
i ll make you a deal 
if you can count to three
without st t tuttering 
you can go 
don t look at him  look at me 
above me  there s no one 
  garces 
  yes  captain 
if i say this asshole can leave 
would anybody contradict me

shame 
your mother is much better 
your highness 
surely  you must be relieved 
yes  thank you 
but things haven t turned out so well 
no 
  i had an accident 
  an accident

  you broke the rules 
  it was only two grapes 
i thought no one would notice 
  we ve made a mistake 
  a mistake 
you failed 
you can never return 
  it was an accident 
  you cannot return 
the moon will be full in three days 
your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans 
you shall age like them 
you shall die like them
and all memory of you
shall fade in time 
and we ll vanish along with it 
you will never see us again 
good day  doctor 
sorry to wake you so early 
but i think we need your help 
my god  what have you done to him 
not much 
but things are getting better 
i like having you handy  doctor

ferreiro 
what the hell is this 
no  no  no 
leave her

look at this  look what she
was hiding under your bed 
what do you think of this 
ofelia  what is this thing doing

isn t like your fairy tales 
the world is a cruel place 
and you ll learn that 
even if it hurts 
  no  no 
  ofelia 
magic does not exist 
not for you  me or anyone else 
mom  help 
help 
help 
why did you do it 
it was the only thing i could do 
no  you could have obeyed me 
i could have  but i didn t 
it would have been better for you 
you know it 
i don t understand 
why didn t you obey me 
to obey just like that for the sake
of obeying  without questioning   
that s something only people
like you can do  captain 
captain 
garces  call the troop paramedic 
  get up immediately 
  yes  captain 
your wife is dead 
because the paths to the lord
are inscrutable 
because the essence
of his forgiveness
lies in his word
and in his mystery 
because although god
sends us the message 
it is our task to decipher it 
because when we open our arms
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell 
far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory 
because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life 
and the state of grace
that we lose when we are born 
because god  in his infinite wisdom 
puts the solution in our hands 
and because it is only
in his physical absence 
that the place he occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed 
you knew
dr  ferreiro pretty well 
didn t you  mercedes 
we all knew him  sir 
everyone around here 
the stutterer spoke of an informer 
here    at the mill 
can you imagine 
right under my nose 
mercedes  please 
what must you think of me 
you must think that
i m a monster 
it doesn t matter
what someone like me thinks  sir 
i want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor  please 
yes  sir 
goodnight  sir 
mercedes 
aren t you forgetting something 
sir 
the key 
i do have the only copy  don t i 
yes  sir 
you know  there s an odd detail
that s been bothering me 
maybe it s not important  but   
the day they broke into
the storehouse 
with all those grenades
and explosives 
the lock itself wasn t forced 
as i said  it s probably
not important 
be very careful 
good night  sir 
ofelia  ofelia 
ofelia  i m leaving tonight 
  where to

dry meat

and i want them
in front of me  tomorrow 
yes  captain

  i was invisible to you 
  damn 
you ve found my weakness 
pride 
but it s your weak points
we re interested in 
it s very simple  you will talk   
and i have to know
that everything you say is the truth 
we have a few things here
strictly for that purpose 
nothing complicated 
things we learn on the job 
at first   
i m not some old man 
not a wounded prisoner 
mother fucker 
don t you dare touch the girl 
won t be the first pig i gutted 
look  he let her go 
the fuck did you say 
get her 
come on  bring her to me 
bring her to me  damn it 
mount up 
lt ll be better if you come
with me without struggling 
the captain said that if you behave   
don t be a fool  sweetheart 
if anyone s going to kill you   
i d rather it be me 
i ve decided to give you
one last chance 
do you promise to do what i say 
will you do everything i tell you 
without question 
this is your last chance 
then listen to me 
fetch your brother
and bring him to the labyrinth 
as quickly as you can 
your highness 
my brother 
we need him 
  but   
  no more questions 
the door s locked 
in that case 
create your own door 
captain  with your permission 
come quickly 
  now what 
  serrano is back  he s wounded 
wounded 
where s garces 
how many were there 
i don t know exactly  captain 
fifty men  at least 
the rest of the men didn t make it 
our watch posts are not responding 
  how many men we have left 
  twenty  maybe less  sir 
we re leaving 
together 
don t be afraid 
nothing is going to happen to you 
put them on picket duty
at the tree line 
if the rest of the squad gets back 
have it report immediately to me 
radio for reinforcements  now 
yes  captain 
leave him 
ofelia 
quickly  your majesty 
give him to me 
the full moon is high in the sky 
we can open the portal 
why is that in your hand 
the portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent 
just a drop of blood 
a pinprick  that s all 
it s the final task 
hurry 
you promised to obey me 
  give me the boy 
  no 
my brother stays with me 
you would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know 
yes  i would 
you would give up
your throne for him 
he who has caused you
such misery  such humiliation 
yes  i would 
as you wish  your highness 
no 
my son 
tell my son   
tell him what time his father died 
  tell him that i   
  no 
he won t even know your name 
arise  my daughter 
come 
father 
you have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent 
that was the final task 
and the most important 
and you chose well 
your highness 
come here with me 
and sit by your father s side 
he s been waiting for you so long 
and it is said the princess
returned to her father s kingdom 
that she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries
