would you have a drink with me
a drink
id love it if you could
well it would have to be
a quick one
because you know
im meeting my boyfriend for dinner
piano playing soft jazz music
i was just saying
you can tell awful lot about people
when you look in their mouths
are they conscientious are they
disciplined are they vain
or careless you have
to know what to look for
do you have the time
i have to keep an eye on it
ive got homework
this computer thing is proving
a little more difficult than i imagined
its funny really because i used to
be a straighta student in college
you know but they say every year
millions of brain cells just die off
you have good teeth
oh
laughs
im sure you get
many compliments on them
well thank you
yeah
you know
youre a very beautiful woman
are you serious
with your boyfriend

danny how do you expect me to
react when my father is unmasked
as a common thief
you cant just drop out of harvard

i wanna die when i see what hes done
how he lied stole ruined people
i know
danny he is a sleazy criminal
jasmine but if you drop out you will
be throwing away your whole future
danny you think i could ever
face anybody up at school
my father who i bragged
to everyone about
the financial genius generous
the philanthropist
hes such a phony
hes a cheap crook
his charitable contributions
with stolen money
well just think how he feels
he was arrested in the street
its in all the papers
how can you look at him
did you not suspect anything
or did you not care
what does that mean
it didnt pay for you to ask questions
think i would have allowed him to
set up corporations under my name
sign accounts this is no cake walk
i could get indicted
hes done nothing but lie over the years
he is a con man and a hypocrite
this is how you respond by squandering
your life to get even with him

i was very fortunate
he was a handsome guy

this guy lost every penny
of gingers money
i tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing
i mean what do i know
about financial schemes
youll be very happy to know
that i lost every cent of my own money
you know every home
every stick of furniture

to placate the government
her husband was a slick operator
i was there a week

since you im just just joking
can i
can i make a confession
i dont know that i should be the
one to hear a confession doctor
flicker ha ha ha well ah
the way you dress
i sometimes find very
arousing
really i dont think i dress
in the slightest provocatively
does it upset you if i tell you
that i um find you attractive
dr flicker where is all this talk
leading well im not the kind of person
who likes to beat around the bush
i find you a very alluring woman
im flattered but i certainly hope
thats not why you hired me
a certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me
i shouldnt be hearing this
no dont be upset
im not upset can i just grab my coat
dont be upset
really i think if you get to know me
youd come out of your shell more
im not in a shell
ever gotten high on nitrous oxide
no
it would remove your inhibitions
i dont have inhibitions
stop
oh dr flicker
stop being standoffish
im not standoffish
you should be proud
youve made a conquest
oh dr flicker
this is so embarrassing
banging and clanging
i am never coming back here
i dont have to put myself
through this nonsense
i gotta take a deep breath
oh now look what youve done
i cant breathe
oh god i cant breathe
sharon i dont blame you

cheese ha ha ha
im gonna babysit you
im a good babysitter
yeah
you know
you should babysit i used to
babysit when i was a teenager
its how you make extra money
mom said you never did any work
because you were so rich
well i didnt know
what i wanted to become
and hal my husband
he swept me off my feet
blue moon was the song that was playing
you know the song blue moon
yeah but i always wanted
to do something with my life
you know i had energy
i didnt just shop and lunch
and go to matinees
you know i ran charities
for poor people
and you know raised some money
for museums and schools
you know with wealth
comes responsibilities
i wasnt just some mindless consumer
like so many of my socalled friends
though i wont say
i dislike buying pretty clothes
tip big boys
tip big because you get good service
and they count on tips
you know someday
when you come into great wealth
you must remember to be generous
mom said you used to be okay
but you got crazy
yeah and then you talked
to yourself
well theres only so many traumas
a person can withstand
until they take to the streets
and start screaming
thats right boys they picked me up
on the street talking to myself
and gave me something
called edisons medicine
why edison
because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight
see everything unraveled so quickly
you know i started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia
and this acute fear of death
you know i had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown
i mean you must have heard
of prozac and lithium
well all those drugs
just made me worse
of course you know
i probably did suspect
that not everything hal did
was always 100percent aboveboard
christ i mean
youd have to be an idiot
not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true heh heh heh
but a cheat is a cheat
and when he had other women
i just flipped out
you know and one thing led
to another and
but thats all history boys
i met someone im a new person
dwight get everything
yes these in the kitchen
sure
i cant believe how much you paid for it
i know its ridiculous and its old
god knows if it even works
we have the terrace for a telescope
watch the stars over san francisco bay
mm and the moon will
look incredible through it
ever seen the moon through that
oh i can imagine
hey can i ask you something
sure
you ever think
you could see yourself
married to me
married
i have it all planned but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible
all right but you come with me
next month to vienna
we live there for a few years
and i can teach you to waltz
and you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want
and then we come back and i get
serious about my political dream
and then we adopt kids
and we live in the house
that youre gonna do such
a fantastic job making beautiful
what do you think downside for you
is you have to stand next to me
and smile at photo ops
when i throw my hat in the ring
so youre saying you love me

over the prospect of being my wife

like after we were married is that what
you wanted to wait until it was too late
for your future plans where you
needed the appropriate wife
i wont say it wouldnt be an issue

your ethical behavior is equal to your ex
