she s married to a guy for years 
up to his ass in phony real estate
and bank fraud 
she knew nothing about it 
believe me  she knew  ginger 
okay  she knew

another guy  would you tell your friend

at the moment 
ginger said
you had a nervous breakdown

said you were in the street 
talking to yourself 
you know  i don t think
that this is any of your business 
no  but since i m marrying her 
we don t have any secrets between us 
ugh

jasmine  oh  nothing 
his retarded boyfriend wanted a date

he s very anxious to move in with you 
yeah  i know 
he s got the hots for me 
can i speak frankly 
you hate him 
yeah 
i could tell you two didn t hit it off

oh  forget it  jesus  it s too menial 
i d go nuts 
i wanna go back to school 
i wanna get my degree and become 
you know  something substantial 
i can t just do some mindless job 
ugh  i was forced to take a job
selling shoes on madison avenue 
oh  so humiliating 
friends i d had at dinner parties
at our apartment came in
and i waited on them  i mean 
do you have any idea what that s like 
you know  one minute 
you re hosting women
and the next  you re measuring
their shoe size and fitting them 
erica bishop came into the store 
she saw me
and was so embarrassed for me 
she slipped out
thinking i didn t see her 
i saw you  erica 
are you okay 
hey  you got great taste 
maybe you could do something
in fashion 
or designing  yeah

everyone used to say
i d make a good interior decorator 
there s courses 
but  you know  they cost money 
no  eve logan got
her decorator s license online 
on a computer 
i guess you could  but   
yeah  i m so computer illiterate 
but i could take a class
in computers 
and then when i can handle a computer 
then i can study decorating online 
that sounds too complicated 
why is your reaction always negative 
i m just saying 
you know  first you gotta
learn computers 
and then go for a decorator s
license online 
you re afraid
i ll stay here too long 
no  you know   
just all those courses 
they cost money 
you ll work out here  it s mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight 
there s the follow up cards

in your spare time 
jasmine  well  i m trying
to learn to use a computer 
i wanna study
interior design online 
oh  you wanna be a decorator 
yeah  it s where
my strongest gifts are 
you know  i have a natural flair
for space and color
and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings 
it s very commendable  but i can t
really have you studying on work time
if it interferes
with the business at hand 
yes  i m sorry 
it won t happen again 
please  see that it doesn t 
uh   
i was gonna ask you a question 
yes 
would you have a drink with me 
a drink 
i d love it if you could 
well  it would have to be
a quick one
because  you know 
i m meeting my boyfriend for dinner 
 piano playing soft jazz music 
i was just saying
you can tell awful lot about people
when you look in their mouths 
are they conscientious  are they
disciplined  are they vain 
or careless  you have
to know what to look for 
do you have the time 
i have to keep an eye on it 
i ve got homework 
this computer thing is proving
a little more difficult than i imagined 
it s funny  really  because i used to
be a straight a student in college 
you know  but they say every year 
millions of brain cells just die off 
you have good teeth 
oh 
 laughs 
i m sure you get
many compliments on them 
well  thank you 
yeah 
you know 
you re a very beautiful woman 
are you serious
with your boyfriend 
hm 
i don t mean to pry 
heh  uh   
god  life is complicated 
have you ever had any children 
danny  how do you expect me to
react when my father is unmasked
as a common thief 
you can t just drop out of harvard 
no  it s too humiliating 
i wanna die when i see what he s done 
how he lied  stole  ruined people 
i know   
danny  he is a sleazy criminal 
jasmine  but if you drop out  you will
be throwing away your whole future 
danny  you think i could ever
face anybody up at school 
my father  who i bragged
to everyone about 
the financial genius  generous 
the philanthropist 
he s such a phony 
he s a cheap crook 
his charitable contributions
with stolen money 
well  just think how he feels 
he was arrested in the street 
it s in all the papers 
how can you look at him 
did you not suspect anything
or did you not care 
what does that mean 
it didn t pay for you to ask questions 
think i would have allowed him to
set up corporations under my name 
sign accounts  this is no cake walk 
i could get indicted 
he s done nothing but lie over the years 
he is a con man and a hypocrite 
this is how you respond  by squandering
your life to get even with him 
danny  don t try to find
me  because you won t 
chili  he s a fucking bum  let s go 
let s go  let s go 
get out of the clinch

what kind of work
are you doing 
i m trying to  um

well  in that respect 
i was very fortunate 
he was a handsome guy

why does it have to be a decorator 
why can t you pick something else 
what would you want me to do 
do you want me to wait tables

hey  ginger bags groceries 
well  ginger and i are
completely different people

she means me 
oh  who do i have to sleep with around here
to get a stoli martini with twist of lemon 
jasmine  oh

of ginger s money 
i tried to bring my sister

about financial schemes 
you ll be very happy to know
that i lost every cent of my own money 
you know  every home 
every stick of furniture 
every fur  every ring
and every bank account

to placate the government 
her husband was a slick operator 
i was there a week 
i knew he was hitting on her girlfriend 
i really need to study 
i need some peace  okay 
ginger  okay

and he doesn t steal 
okay  okay  do you always have to
make those stupid sarcastic digs

flicker  ha  ha  ha  well    ah 
the way you dress 
i sometimes find very   
arousing 
really  i don t think i dress
in the slightest provocatively 
does it upset you if i tell you
that i  um  find you attractive 
dr  flicker  where is all this talk
leading  well  i m not the kind of person
who likes to beat around the bush 
i find you a very alluring woman 
i m flattered  but i certainly hope
that s not why you hired me 
a certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me 
i shouldn t be hearing this 
no  don t be upset 
i m not upset  can i just grab my coat 
don t be upset 
really  i think if you get to know me 
you d come out of your shell more 
i m not in a shell 
ever gotten high on nitrous oxide 
no 
it would remove your inhibitions 
i don t have inhibitions 
stop 
oh  dr  flicker 
stop being standoffish 
i m not standoffish 
you should be proud 
you ve made a conquest 
oh  dr  flicker 
this is so embarrassing 
 banging and clanging 
i am never coming back here 
i don t have to put myself
through this nonsense 
i gotta take a deep breath 
oh  now look what you ve done 
i can t breathe 
oh  god  i can t breathe 
sharon  i don t blame you
for being shaken up 
i d have that dentist reported

no  i m never going
into another courtroom 
ugh  i don t blame you 
my boyfriend s a lawyer 
he s got court stories 
sharon  do you know any men

we could do the top
in a muslin or linen   
yeah  yeah  whatever you think 
well  it s not   
you know  last night
when we were making love 
i realized how removed
from the world
i ve been since andrea died 
i know  i know  i   
i think when something s right 
you just   
you know it immediately 
oh  yeah 
  i looked at the clock
and the clock struck 3  
  i said   now  daddy

 inaudible dialogue 
  he kept rockin  with one steady roll   
 easy  listening music playing
over speakers 
do you     do you hear that 
ginger  wow

yeah 
like  the bass
and then the high end definition

you re so sweet 
you re sweet 
you re sweet 
you wanna dance

al  yeah  this is slow
dancing  which is really   
ginger  what  ha  ha  ha 
well  it s the key  i always say
to good lovemaking 
ginger  is that right 
yeah 
matthew  where do you
think mom is tonight 
oh  she s got a date tonight 
oh  that s cool 
i wonder where she is 
well  i don t think she s at chuck e 
cheese  ha  ha  ha 
i m gonna babysit you 
i m a good babysitter 
yeah 
you know 
you should babysit  i used to
babysit when i was a teenager 
it s how you make extra money 
mom said you never did any work 
because you were so rich 
well  i didn t know
what i wanted to become 
and hal  my husband 
he swept me off my feet 
 blue moon  was the song that was playing 
you know the song  blue moon  
yeah  but i always wanted
to do something with my life 
you know  i had energy 
i didn t just shop and lunch
and go to matinees 
you know  i ran charities
for poor people
and  you know  raised some money
for museums and schools 
you know  with wealth
comes responsibilities 
i wasn t just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so called friends 
though i won t say
i dislike buying pretty clothes 
tip big  boys 
tip big  because you get good service
and they count on tips 
you know  someday
when you come into great wealth 
you must remember to be generous 
mom said you used to be okay 
but you got crazy 
yeah  and then you talked
to yourself 
well  there s only so many traumas
a person can withstand
until they take to the streets
and start screaming 
that s right  boys  they picked me up
on the street talking to myself
and gave me something
called edison s medicine 
why edison 
because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight 
see  everything unraveled so quickly 
you know  i started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia
and this acute fear of death 
you know  i had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown 
i mean  you must have heard
of prozac and lithium 
well  all those drugs
just made me worse 
of course  you know 
i probably did suspect
that not everything hal did
was always 100 percent aboveboard 
christ  i mean 
you d have to be an idiot
not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true  heh  heh  heh 
but a cheat is a cheat 
and when he had other women 
i just flipped out 
you know  and one thing led
to another and   
but that s all history  boys 
i met someone  i m a new person 
dwight  get everything 
yes  these in the kitchen 
sure 
i can t believe how much you paid for it 
i know it s ridiculous and it s old 
god knows if it even works 
we have the terrace for a telescope 
watch the stars over san francisco bay 
mm  and the moon will
look incredible through it 
ever seen the moon through that 
oh  i can imagine 
hey  can i ask you something 
sure 
you ever think
you could see yourself
married to me 
married 
i have it all planned  but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible 
all right  but you come with me
next month to vienna 
we live there for a few years
and i can teach you to waltz 
and you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want 
and then we come back and i get
serious about my political dream 
and then we adopt kids
and we live in the house
that you re gonna do such
a fantastic job making beautiful 
what do you think  downside for you
is you have to stand next to me
and smile at photo ops
when i throw my hat in the ring 
so you re saying you love me 
can t you tell 
i hope i didn t cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife

everything happened in the past 
you and i loved each other   
what  that it would just vanish 
didn t you think i would find out 
if not today  eventually 
like after we were married  is that what
you wanted  to wait until it was too late 
for your future plans where you
needed the appropriate wife 
i won t say it wouldn t be an issue 
but that you could stand by 
deceive me until i married you   
no  you mean till i trapped you 
your ethical behavior is equal to your ex 
i wasn t deceiving you  i loved you 
i found out by chance  by sheer chance

not how she feels about you 
you know  i m sick of her
calling you a loser 
or always pushing me
