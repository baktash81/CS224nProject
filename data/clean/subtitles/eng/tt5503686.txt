hey  you an investor

let the guys get fucked up 
first get  em a single 
then a double  then a triple 
then go back to a double

according to ramona 
there were three tiers
of wall street guys 
the guys at the bottom  they don t
do anything dirty to make money 
so  most of them
don t have any 
but if they do  you can
milk  em for every penny 
  i  i get it  
you know 
maybe they re in a loveless marriage 
or maybe they re single
and feeling dejected 
either way  you can string  em
along without getting physical 
chuck here pays for my
apartment on the upper east side
and i ve never even sniffed
his dick 
the guys in the middle 
they ll get their hands a little dirty 
but they have their limits 
don t tase me  bro 
they dabble in greed 
but they never cross a certain line 
or maybe
they re not as good at it 
that s why they all share
a two bedroom in cobble hill 
but then there s
the motherfuckers on top 
you re a dickwad 
fucking pussy 
ceos  cfos 
investment bankers 
corporate raiders 
hedge funders  ax murderers 
found footage 
you like it  take a look 
look familiar 
too close to home  mama 
coming straight from
the crime scene into the club 
but not through the front 
oh  no 
these guys  they don t wanna
be written about on page six 
they come through the back 
they take the private elevator
to the one room without cameras 
how you feeling today 
oh  feel a lot better now 
  make some money 
  oh  yeah 
and they don t leave till they
spend  10 000   15 000 in one night 
they can be degrading 
possessive  aggressive  violent 
and they never get
in any trouble 
because everyone s willing
to cover their tracks 
 cause deep down
they all want what they got 
they all wanna be on top   
where there are no consequences 
  i saw you  
you re just another deal to them 
and that s all they are to you 
  in a mist of a dream  
  i wonder why  oh  why  
it s business 
and it s a more honest transaction
than anything else they did that day 
  you were not there  
  you looked so good to me  
  that i stopped
and i stared  
  this could happen to you  
  in a mist of a dream  
all you have to do is figure
out who you re dealing with 
and then play them
at their level 
i m gonna do that 
let me help you 
i got it 
hold on  wait  you gotta
spread it out a little bit 
i did

and then i get little chains
and make belts out of them 
and this right here 
these are epaulets

 little shoulders

afraid to wear denim in the ocean

comfortable when they re wet 
specifically salt water 
here  try these on

to save up the money for my label

but like ramona said 
 going fishing doesn t mean
you catch a marlin  
and some of the guys
didn t want to party 
oh  no  no  thank you 
come on  you don t   
  are you sure  come on 
  i m very sure  thank you 
you don t wanna see me
after a couple of those 
oh  boy 
and some of them caught on 
  i can t  but this was fun 
  what  wait 
fuck 
what do we do now 
i m supposed to get dragon
a new lawyer 
but i can t
fucking afford it now 
i can t move back home 
i guess it s back to the pole 
sorry  annabelle 
we ll get through it 
that s when ramona
came up with her special recipe 
are you serious 
it s barely any different
than what we re doing now 
it s just a shortcut 
a sure thing 
  what if someone gets hurt 
  nobody s gonna get hurt 
the worst is
they ll have a bad hangover 
  what if somebody calls the cops 
  and says what 
 i spent  5 000
at a strip club  send help  
no  they won t even know what happened
until they check their bank account 
i think i m gonna throw up 
look  we re not
the only ones doing this 
how do you think the club
stayed in business post 2008 
it s a side hustle 
everybody s had to
get creative  baby 
i know a girl in queens
who did it 
did she get caught 
no 
she sent her two kids
to college 
and now she lives in miami 
opened up a nail salon 
exactly 
what do you think 
what is it 
it s ketamine and mdma 
the ketamine wipes their memory 
the mdma makes  em happy 
how many times
have you done it 
three times 
including tonight 
works every time 
we made five grand tonight 
split three ways 
could make it four 
be like old times 
look  baby  we gotta start thinking
like these wall street guys 
you see what they did
to this country 
they stole from everybody 
hardworking people
lost everything 
and not one of
these douchebags went to jail 
not one 
is that fair 
you ever think about
when they come into the club 
that s stolen money 
that s what s paying for
their blow jobs 
the fucking firefighters 
retirement fund 
fuck these guys 
look  we can t dance forever 
what are you gonna do 
go back to minimum wage 
no  baby  this game is rigged 
and it does not reward people
who play by the rules 
you either gotta stand in
the corner or get in the ring 
i don t wanna hurt anybody 
me either 
all right 
they would do this anyway 
we re just helping them do it 
nobody gets hurt 
nobody gets hurt 
so   
are you in 
well  it s getting late 
oh  it is  what a shame 
so  you gotta get up
early tomorrow  or   
let s get another drink  hmm

to say that we were drugging people 
but you gotta understand 
in our world  this was normal 
i mean  half these guys are
mainlining coke on their way to work 
but we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible 
so  i suggested
that we tweak the recipe 
so  what do you think 
sixty mdma  forty ketamine 
that sounds good 
do we turn the liquid into a powder 
or do we turn the powder into a liquid 
it s hot 
eh  eh  eh 
let s try it in the oven 
mm hmm 
yes 
how much 
just a sprinkle 
you know  i m still not sure
about strangers 
well  that s the beauty of it 
baby  they re strangers 
yeah  but i don t wanna slip it to
anybody who s not already on something 
we gotta know that
these guys like to party 
and that they ve got money 
enough not to care
if some of it s missing 
with strangers 
it s unpredictable 
no guarantees 
so  we called up
some old friends

i m sorry
i wasn t there  baby 
i know 
i don t wanna go home 
do you and lily
wanna stay with us 
yeah 
okay 
you know  i m supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me 
i mean 
take your mind off things 
ain t no pressure 
just  you know   
if you need the money 
could be a big one 
i knew it had to stop 
i kept thinking that there
was  like  this magic number 
you know 
if i could save enough money 
i could start clean 
just me and lily 
maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody 
is that what happened
with doug      
uh   
i don t really remember
a doug      
  ramona said   
  well  ramona s a liar 
she ll say anything
to make herself look better 
i mean 
what did she say about me 
i m sure she had a lot to say 
what d she say 
she said you had
a tough time growing up
and that you spent
a lot of time alone 
you got into fights and   
had some bad boyfriends 
okay  what else 
that your parents were immigrants 
and that when your father left 
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents  house 
and never came back 
is that true 
i mean  i thought that she was
just taking a break  you know 
i thought that  you know 
sometimes moms need a break 
why would she tell you all that 
i think she just wanted me
to understand that  for you 
this wasn t about revenge 
you were just trying
to make friends 
destiny 
i know i m supposed to think
that what you did was terrible
and that these guys
didn t deserve it 
but to tell you the truth 
i don t feel sorry for them 
well  i feel sorry for them 
you know 
i keep having this nightmare 
right  where  like  i m in
the back seat of this car 
this moving car 
and i realize that nobody
is driving the car 
and i have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it  and i go there 
and no matter what i do 
i can t get a grip on it 
and i can t  like  stop it 
and then i wake up 
what happened
between you and ramona 
why aren t you
talking anymore 
hello 
so ramona met doug years ago 
doug s friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam
after a few
devastating events 
i don t know
that it is gonna be okay 
how could it get worse 
which included his
house being destroyed by a fire 
and separating from
the mother of his young son 
she never really wanted
to have kids  you know 
so  i think when we found out
he was autistic 
i think she just
couldn t handle it  you know 
he was nice 
we talked about our kids 
we talked about our exes 
  we had a heart to heart 
  drinks 
here we go 
that one s for you 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
so  what happened to doug 
so  what i miss 
what are we doing tonight 
um   
uh   
the room was round 
there was a table 
they maxed out
my corporate card   
so my company launched
an internal investigation 
and i was fired 
can you please just
credit back my debit card 
my mortgage payment s
on there 
what are you talking about 
you were having a great time 
why are you doing this to me 
please  i have nothing 
i can t   
i can t afford to not pay
my mortgage 
my s   
my son   
i m really sorry 
put the phone down  destiny 
  put it away 
  just give me a second 
don t  what the   
  gimme the phone 
  get off of me 
  hey 
  stop 
  if we don t do it  someone else will 
  get off of me 
gimme that fucking phone 
ungrateful little bitch 
precinct 
yes  hello  i   
i went to a strip club
and i was drugged 
precinct 
i was drugged 
and i have proof 
it was weird 
it was real weird 
if it hadn t been
for the tape 
i would ve been like   dude 
you re fucking full of shit  
please 
i just wanna know what happened to me 
um   
you were fleeced  that s all 
by who 
um    well 
we re  like  a little gang 
you were just a target 
we just gave you
a little sprinkle 
i ll tell you everything 
i ll tell you everything
i know  i promise 
i know a lot  i really   
i ll tell you everything 
i just don t wanna go back 
so  was there a sting 
one  two  one  two 
hello  police 
can you hear me 
i m about to open the door 
  hey  did you bring the drugs 
  shh 
  where is he 
  he s in the bathroom 
look  like 
i don t think that he likes me 
so  i don t know 
i think one of you is gonna have to do it 
are you high 
  what 
  give her a break 
no  me 
no  no  no  no  i don t do
that kind of stuff anymore 
that s just    it s not me 
  hey  hey  ladies 
  hey 
christmas come early 
hey  these are my friends
that i told you about 
  hi  friends 
  this is ramona 
  ramona  hi 
  ramona  hi 
  this is   
  and i m rhonda 
  rhonda  you are both very attractive 
  rhonda  yeah 
thank you 
okay  why don t you
take a seat right here 
we re gonna fix you a drink 
  so  you stay there  okay 
  you get one too  shots  i don t know 
we ll see about that 
just a second  hmm 
hope you re thirsty 
  do it 
  no  just go ahead 
go on 
you found him  go ahead 
hi 
here you go 
yum  yum  yummers  slàinte 
so  who s excited 
i m telling you 
it s the same fucking car 
you re being paranoid 
no  i saw the same fucking buick
parked outside the gansevoort 
it s not a buick 
well  whatever the fuck it is 
it s been following us for 20 minutes 
  dawn was setting us up back there 
  dawn 
now i know you re paranoid 
you really think that she wouldn t
sell you out to save herself 
so  there was a sting 
we cannot comment on that
at this time 
but what we can tell you
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd 
why 
i guess men don t wanna admit
what happened to them  you know 
being victimized by a woman 
so  we did some investigating 
and we found
the connecticut architect
who moves said
failed to pay a  135 000 bill
he racked up during
four visits to the club 
 for a night of pleasure
he can t even remember  
what a boob 
 and went back
three more times  
i guess he must ve liked it 
you know 
when you look at it out of context 
it seems like
he s making it up 
you re a family girl 
you look like my brother 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  you like that 
  no 
why i m here  i mean 
it s not about the money 
it s about the next guy
this happens to 
and  like  i gotta
do something to stop that 
but when you put it
together with doug  it all added up 
peter 
peter  these are my sisters 
oh  yes 
scary  isn t it 
i mean  we got so spooked 
none of us went back to the club anymore 
  i ve never seen a diamond
in the flesh  
  i cut my teeth on wedding
rings in the movies  
hey  ramona 
how you doin   girl 
  in the torn up town  
  no post code envy  
  but every song s like gold teeth
grey goose  trippin  in the bathroom  
  bloodstains  ball gowns
trashin  the hotel room  
  we don t care  
  we re driving cadillacs
in our dreams  
  but everybody s like cristal 
maybach diamonds on your timepiece  
  jet planes  islands
tigers on a gold leash  
  we don t care  
  we are caught up
in your love affair  
  and we ll never be royals  
put your hands up 
don t move 
hands where we can see  em 
did you hear him 
put your hands up 
hands up  let s go 
let go of the money 
give it up  ramona

  you can call me queen bee  
    and  baby  i ll rule      i ll

yeah  i like that 
keep that right here 
i tried to get
one that you would like 
you did 
you know  i m not usually
happy to see your kind 
but when i see you 
i know i m gonna see my man 
just a little bit    longer 
  and everyone
who knows us knows  
  that we re fine with this  
  we didn t come from money  
  but every song s like gold teeth
grey goose  trippin  in the bathroom  
  bloodstains  ball gowns
trashin  the hotel room  
  we don t care  
  we re driving cadillacs
in our dreams  
  but everybody s like cristal 
maybach diamonds on your timepiece  
  jet planes  islands
tigers on a gold leash  
  we don t care  
i m sorry 
    and we ll never be royals  
    royals  
  it don t run in our blood  
  that kind of lux
just ain t for us  
  we crave
a different kind of buzz  
    let me be your ruler  
    ruler  
  you can call me queen bee  
    and  baby  i ll rule      i ll

i took the deal

and  oh  i met this guy who   
he s gonna help me get
a job in pharmaceuticals 
so i m really excited
about that 
  are you still there 
  i m here 
so  i was just reading
the article again 
and maybe the reason
why we did what we did
is because hurt people
hurt people  you know 
yeah  no  i understand 
so  have you talked
to ramona lately 
no  just that one time 
  have you 
  no 
um   
can i just ask you   
like  what else
did she say about me 
so  i used to live
in the bronx back then 
but i was seeing this guy who had a
walk up right next to where i stripped 
so  i was staying at his
place  like  every night 
but one morning  i go back to my
place  and the door s wide open 
and i was freaked out  you know 
i was like   oh  my god  all my stuff  
all my valuable stuff is in this
place that i m not even sleeping in  
so  now i just carry everything
with me everywhere i go 
let me show you 
let s see 
this 
this is a patch from my grandpa s uniform 
he was in the navy 
oh 
this is my   
my grandma s wedding ring 
isn t that pretty 
and this one was my mother s 
it s the three birthstones
of me and my sisters 
the ruby s me 
i was a july baby 
i have two sisters  one lives in
arizona  the other one lives in texas 
we try to get together once a year 
but with the kids  it s impossible 
do you have kids 
not yet 
well  don t worry 
you re young 
and you have amazing skin 
is that you 
that s me 
i was 15 
a senior
had asked me to the prom 
i look terrified 
i like the dress  though 
and this here 
this is dorothy 
wasn t she the cutest 
who could leave that baby 
you know  we used to say 
 if only we had known
each other back then  
you know 
maybe we could ve   
looked out for one another 
maybe our lives
would ve been different 
you know 
or maybe it would ve
just been the same 
who knows 
but i like to keep her
with me 
what else you wanna know 
you should
give her a call  destiny 
yeah 
look  there s nothing
i can really say
to make sense
of what went down 
but everybody s hustling 
this city   
fuck  this whole country
is a strip club 
you got people tossing the money   
and people doing the dance 
one last time  everybody
