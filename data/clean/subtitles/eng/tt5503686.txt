hey you an investor

i i get it
according to ramona
there were three tiers
of wall street guys
the guys at the bottom they dont
do anything dirty to make money
so most of them
dont have any
but if they do you can
milk em for every penny
i i get it
you know
maybe theyre in a loveless marriage
or maybe theyre single
and feeling dejected
either way you can string em
along without getting physical
chuck here pays for my
apartment on the upper east side
and ive never even sniffed
his dick
the guys in the middle
theyll get their hands a little dirty
but they have their limits
dont tase me bro
they dabble in greed
but they never cross a certain line
or maybe
theyre not as good at it
thats why they all share
a twobedroom in cobble hill
but then theres
the motherfuckers on top
youre a dickwad
fucking pussy
ceos cfos
investment bankers
corporate raiders
hedge funders ax murderers
found footage
you like it take a look
look familiar
too close to home mama
coming straight from
the crime scene into the club
but not through the front
oh no
these guys they dont wanna
be written about on page six
they come through the back
they take the private elevator
to the one room without cameras
how you feeling today
oh feel a lot better now
make some money
oh yeah
and they dont leave till they
spend 10000 15000 in one night
they can be degrading
possessive aggressive violent
and they never get
in any trouble
because everyones willing
to cover their tracks
cause deep down
they all want what they got
they all wanna be on top
where there are no consequences
i saw you
youre just another deal to them
and thats all they are to you
in a mist of a dream
i wonder why oh why
its business
and its a more honest transaction
than anything else they did that day
you were not there
you looked so good to me
that i stopped
and i stared
this could happen to you
in a mist of a dream
all you have to do is figure
out who youre dealing with
and then play them
at their level
im gonna do that
let me help you
i got it
hold on wait you gotta
spread it out a little bit
i did
i gotta get a bigger boot
oh my god wait
kay hold on

you dont wanna see me
after a couple of those

fucking afford it now
i cant move back home
i guess its back to the pole
sorry annabelle
well get through it
thats when ramona
came up with her special recipe
are you serious
its barely any different
than what were doing now
its just a shortcut
a sure thing
what if someone gets hurt
nobodys gonna get hurt
the worst is
theyll have a bad hangover
what if somebody calls the cops
and says what
i spent 5000
at a strip club send help
no they wont even know what happened
until they check their bank account
i think im gonna throw up
look were not
the only ones doing this
how do you think the club
stayed in business post2008
its a side hustle
everybodys had to
get creative baby
i know a girl in queens
who did it
did she get caught
no
she sent her two kids
to college
and now she lives in miami
opened up a nail salon
exactly
what do you think
what is it
its ketamine and mdma
the ketamine wipes their memory
the mdma makes em happy
how many times
have you done it
three times
including tonight
works every time
we made five grand tonight
split three ways
could make it four
be like old times
look baby we gotta start thinking
like these wall street guys
you see what they did
to this country
they stole from everybody
hardworking people
lost everything
and not one of
these douchebags went to jail
not one
is that fair

you know im supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me
i mean
take your mind off things
aint no pressure
just you know
if you need the money
could be a big one
i knew it had to stop
i kept thinking that there
was like this magic number
you know
if i could save enough money
i could start clean
just me and lily
maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody
is that what happened
with doug
uh
i dont really remember
a doug
ramona said
well ramonas a liar
shell say anything
to make herself look better
i mean
what did she say about me
im sure she had a lot to say
whatd she say
she said you had
a tough time growing up
and that you spent
a lot of time alone
you got into fights and
had some bad boyfriends
okay what else
that your parents were immigrants
and that when your father left
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents house
and never came back
is that true
i mean i thought that she was
just taking a break you know
i thought that you know
sometimes moms need a break
why would she tell you all that
i think she just wanted me
to understand that for you
this wasnt about revenge
you were just trying
to make friends
destiny
i know im supposed to think
that what you did was terrible
and that these guys
didnt deserve it
but to tell you the truth
i dont feel sorry for them
well i feel sorry for them
you know
i keep having this nightmare
right where like im in
the back seat of this car
this moving car
and i realize that nobody
is driving the car
and i have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it and i go there
and no matter what i do
i cant get a grip on it
and i cant like stop it
and then i wake up
what happened
between you and ramona
why arent you
talking anymore
hello
so ramona met doug years ago
dougs friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam
after a few
devastating events
i dont know
that it is gonna be okay
how could it get worse
which included his
house being destroyed by a fire
and separating from
the mother of his young son
she never really wanted
to have kids you know
so i think when we found out
he was autistic
i think she just
couldnt handle it you know
he was nice
we talked about our kids
we talked about our exes
we had a hearttoheart
drinks
here we go
that ones for you
thank you
youre welcome
so what happened to doug
so what i miss
what are we doing tonight
um
uh
the room was round
there was a table
they maxed out
my corporate card
so my company launched
an internal investigation
and i was fired
can you please just
credit back my debit card
my mortgage payments
on there
what are you talking about
you were having a great time
why are you doing this to me
please i have nothing
i cant
i cant afford to not pay
my mortgage
my s
my son
im really sorry
put the phone down destiny
put it away
just give me a second

gimme the phone

get off of me
gimme that fucking phone
ungrateful little bitch
precinct

it was weird

if it hadnt been
for the tape
i wouldve been like dude

um
you were fleeced thats all
by who
um well
were like a little gang
you were just a target
we just gave you
a little sprinkle
ill tell you everything
ill tell you everything
i know i promise
i know a lot i really
ill tell you everything
i just dont wanna go back
so was there a sting
one two one two
hello police
can you hear me
im about to open the door
hey did you bring the drugs
shh
where is he
hes in the bathroom
look like
i dont think that he likes me
so i dont know
i think one of you is gonna have to do it
are you high
what
give her a break
no me
no no no no i dont do
that kind of stuff anymore
thats just its not me
hey hey ladies
hey
christmas come early
hey these are my friends
that i told you about
hi friends
this is ramona
ramona hi
ramona hi

you found him go ahead
hi
here you go
yum yum yummers slàinte
so whos excited
im telling you
its the same fucking car
youre being paranoid
no i saw the same fucking buick
parked outside the gansevoort
its not a buick
well whatever the fuck it is
its been following us for 20 minutes
dawn was setting us up back there
dawn
now i know youre paranoid
you really think that she wouldnt
sell you out to save herself
so there was a sting
we cannot comment on that
at this time
but what we can tell you
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd
why
i guess men dont wanna admit
what happened to them you know
being victimized by a woman
so we did some investigating
and we found
the connecticut architect
who moves said
failed to pay a 135000 bill
he racked up during
four visits to the club
for a night of pleasure
he cant even remember
what a boob
and went back
three more times
i guess he mustve liked it
you know
when you look at it out of context
it seems like
hes making it up
youre a family girl
you look like my brother
yeah
yeah
you like that
no
why im here i mean
its not about the money
its about the next guy
this happens to
and like i gotta
do something to stop that
but when you put it
together with doug it all added up
peter
peter these are my sisters
oh yes
scary isnt it
i mean we got so spooked
none of us went back to the club anymore
ive never seen a diamond
in the flesh

walkup right next to where i stripped

place and the doors wide open

place that im not even sleeping in
