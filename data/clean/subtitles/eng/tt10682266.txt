yes hes hubie
hes helpful
hes courteous
hes cheerful hes considerate
what a bad bad man
my greatgreatgreatgreatgreat
grandmother laid down her life
trying to save innocent people
i was there
and my son did her one better
he just saved four ungrateful jackasses
thanks pubie
well you cant even
thank him without insulting him
im sorry i dont know why i said pubie
it just came out
could it be because you feel threatened
stammers
i feel a lot of pressure
to be cool all the time
im jealous of hubie
being able to be himself
i lost my hair 20 years ago
and every time i walk into a room
i feel silly
why should someone like hubie
have such a thick luxuriant head of hair
and i look like a california raisin
i have never felt sexually fulfilled
but
oh shut up lester
youre usually there you know its true
im guessing
hubie hasnt had a lot of sex
no maam
hasnt had any sex
mmm
but what he does have is hope
damn him and his hope
i was diagnosed
with dyslexia in the eighth grade
i faked it for the doctors
but im really just dumb
i never really told anybody
youre probably all surprised
no im not surprised
nope
you surprised
laughs no
but hubie uses big words
and they come out so natural for him
it pisses me off
oh cause of the dumb thing
my brotherinlaw
once said that i had no ambition
and then he bit me
and i became a werewolf
howls softly
you see
hubies smart
has nice hair and sex hope
but to me
his best quality is this
he can weather all of your insults
and your thrown objects
and he responds with humor
and and kindness
could you say the same
could any of you take
the abuse you dish out to my hubie
i busted a guy for dwi last week and uh
he said it was an honor
to be arrested by a muppet
i acted like i didnt hear him
but then i cried in my squad car
for about half an hour
you see hubie true braverys being kind
even to those who are being cruel to you
i just always wanted
to be as nice as you mom
oh you were nicer
but now i know that youre ready
to spread your wings and fly without me
you dont have to be scared anymore
im feeling emotional
and a little horny
ooh
not for you
oh
just know that ill always love you
and happy halloween
