 boner donor

means i donate mistakes 
that makes sense 
i met the fellow who moved into
the andersons  house next door 
walter lambert  seemed like good people 
  oh  well  that s nice 
  yeah

 landolfa  just look at him 
he s so  hubie 
 all snickering 
yes  he s hubie 
he s helpful 
he s courteous 
he s cheerful  he s considerate 
what a bad  bad man 
my great great great great great 
grandmother laid down her life 
trying to save innocent people 
i was there 
and my son did her one better 
he just saved four ungrateful jackasses 
thanks  pubie 
well  you can t even
thank him without insulting him 
i m sorry  i don t know why i said pubie 
it just came out 
could it be because you feel threatened 
 stammers 
i feel a lot of pressure
to be cool all the time 
i m jealous of hubie
being able to be himself 
i lost my hair 20 years ago 
and every time i walk into a room 
i feel silly 
why should someone like hubie
have such a thick  luxuriant head of hair 
and i look like a california raisin 
i have never felt sexually fulfilled 
  but   
  oh  shut up  lester 
you re usually there  you know it s true 
i m guessing 
hubie hasn t had a lot of sex 
no  ma am 
hasn t had any sex 
mmm 
but what he does have is hope 
damn him and his hope 
i was diagnosed
with dyslexia in the eighth grade 
i faked it for the doctors 
but i m really just dumb 
i never really told anybody 
you re probably all surprised 
  no  i m not surprised 
  nope 
  you surprised 
   laughs  no 
but hubie uses big words 
and they come out so natural for him 
it pisses me off 
oh   cause of the dumb thing 
my brother in law
once said that i had no ambition 
and then he bit me 
and i became a werewolf 
 howls softly 
you see 
hubie s smart 
has nice hair  and sex hope 
but to me 
his best quality is this 
he can weather all of your insults
and your thrown objects 
and he responds with humor
and    and kindness 
could you say the same 
could any of you take
the abuse you dish out to my hubie 
i busted a guy for dwi last week  and  uh 
he said it was an honor
to be arrested by a muppet 
i acted like i didn t hear him 
but then i cried in my squad car
for about half an hour 
you see  hubie  true bravery s being kind 
even to those who are being cruel to you 
i just always wanted
to be as nice as you  mom 
oh  you were nicer 
but now i know that you re ready
to spread your wings and fly without me 
you don t have to be scared anymore 
i m feeling emotional 
  and a little horny 
  ooh 
  not for you 
  oh 
just know that i ll always love you 
and happy halloween 
frankenstein
