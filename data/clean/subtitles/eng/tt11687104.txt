alice
alice
will you come join us
sure
i dont know i mean i dont
hey everyone
you are listening tohurdle
i am so so excited
to bring you todays episode
because i am chatting
with my dear friend
core values and were living
and breathing them
every day in our lives
thats what makes us
feel most fulfilled right
so if you can begin
your day like that
so its not own your morning
aka like do as
much as possible within
like a threehour time span
starting at 400 am correct
but theyre owning your morning
by giving you and yourself
and your mental health
and your soul what it needs
hi there
have you seen this
girl andrea evans
no uh we just
got here yesterday
im sorry i cant
be more helpful
you keep that
theres a hotline you can
call if youve seen anything
search parties leave at 800
every morning from the church
if you could spare the time
yeah okay
uh thank you or good luck
take care
double word score
wow door wow well done
you are making this too easy
my turn all right
all right that was rude
you really did it
dont be mad
what nosophie yes
hey gossip girl we
need a second opinion
uh what is it
quakey
uh maybe
well take that
as a yes so that is
twentyone double word score
wait why gossip girl
i dont know the
phone the hair
you are aware that
popular culture has evolved
over the last decade tess and
maybe your references
are getting a little bit stale
yeah tess mmhmm
a reboot with who
hey
um so i think im
gonna have to leave early
i know its just work is
really intense right now
seriously were
here for my birthday
i yeah i sorry i
i dont really expect
you to understand
youre right i
dont understand
i was under the impressionthat
we took the week off
so that we could
spend it together
what are you taking
the week off from
im sorry does
my work not count
because i dont get paid for it
of course your
work counts tess
your work is amazing
sophie thats not what
were talking about right now
heyhello
guess what i brought
what
fireworks for tess birthday
its a surprise so
dont say anything
why are you doing
all this for her
i think you should
cut her some slack
this is a its a
milestone of a birthday
and i think that she
is a little nervous
cause she thinks that
she should be further along
i think she would expect
to be at simons
level right now
not that she would admit that
anyway
i thought we could have a picnic
at that little island
across the lake
yeah i dont want to be
in a boat with her right now
stop it itll be fun
sophie im serious
maybe this is just about
our friendship not being
what it used to be
whose friendship
mine and tess
i dont think youre being fair
anyway we all think our
worst thoughts at night
you will not think this
way in the morning
andrea
andrea
andrea
i havent let the girls
leave the house in days
theyre on the verge of mutiny
if shes hurt its probably
someone she knows
andrea
andrea
listen forget
about the history
we talked about
this over and over
youve told me you cant
be your real self around them
when youve seen them do
you have a good time or not
why do you put
yourself through this
do you feel better or worse
and i think you already
know what you have to do
and there is a
really easy solution
you dont need them
in your life anymore
its tough i know its tough
part of growing up is
knowing when to let go
hey you missed
a really fun day
hey where were you
i went out with one
of the search parties
hmm did you find her
no
so definitely worth missing
spending the day with us then
all right i need some
help at the wood shed
can you help me out mmhmm
thank you
fuck me
okay lesson number one
this is a maul
i never want to hear
you call it an ax okay
so look for the natural
splits in the wood
get your distance
feet like sookay
and when you swing you
want this hand to fall in line
with this hand
so like
okay
got it yeah
wow youre good well
that was hardly anything
okay
nice
shit

flag than that alice its not
hey can we just approach
this without judgment
are you seriously
telling me that you have
no opinions about this
of course i do but
alice is a grown woman
yes and i dont
know how any of this is
your business
when youre friends
with somebody it means you care
about the other person
but i guess thats a concept
simon managed to
erase from your brain
along with the rest of your
personality tess stop it
maybe this is my
personality and im changing
and youre the shitty
friend for not like
letting me change
were not all content
to like flip between projects
some of us have
real adult lives
fucking a 40yearold
does not make you an adult
hes 37
yeah hes a fucking clown
and hes got this
stupid smarmy accent
and his art is
selfindulgent
derivative garbage
youre just jealous because
hes successful and youre
im what
simon loves me im happy
is this what you think love is
what would you know
youve never been
in a serious relationship
romantic love isnt
the only kind of love
only boring people think that
okay cool i guess
im boring then

shoe fits i didnt say it

you right now
i cant stand you right now

im sorry that i made you worry
you good
i dont want to go home
then well stay
sophie back yet
no
this ax is a piece of shit
thats actually a maul
ugh great
thank you for that
she felt very young
and at the same time
unspeakably aged
she sliced like a knife
through everything
she had a perpetual sense
of being out out
far out to sea and alone
she always had
the feeling that it was
very very dangerous
to live even one day
i like you reading me to sleep
you were gone a while
i needed some space
you know this trip isnt
just about you tess
you make me sound like a bully
well
im not a bully
oh my god stop
wow now that is cleared
up who would like a donut
hot chocolate
yes pleaseyeah
how did simon
know you were here
he looked at my email
he never would have let me come
what
yeah he checks
things sometimes
alice
i know
he always has a reason
i take my phone into
the bathroom with me
now when i shower
andrea
andrea
andrea
i know this sounds crazy
but sometimes it feels like
like he can read my mind
and like if he
can do that then
theres nowhere left that
i can actually be alone
i never know whats
going to make him angry
so i spend all this time
trying to be good trying to
think of ways to be better
like if i could just
purify my thoughts
but you cant i mean
its never good enough
i i dont know
but he doesnt hurt me
or anything you know
he doesnt hurt you
i really wish you would
have told us this sooner
i didnt know what to say

uh i have always
been a wise old lady
in spirit at least
now you are in body toommhmm

people on their birthday
thats a good
chiptopancake ratio
oh my god

is there even
anything around here
maybe the place
near the food mart
i just dont know if its open
this early in the season
i could check if i had my phone
