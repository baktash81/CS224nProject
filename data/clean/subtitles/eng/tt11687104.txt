you are listening tohurdle 
i am so  so excited
to bring you today s episode
because i am chatting
with my dear friend   
core values  and we re living
and breathing them
every day in our lives 
that s what makes us
feel most fulfilled  right 
so if you can begin
your day like that 
so it s not own your morning 
a k a   like  do as
much as possible within 
like  a three hour time span
starting at 4 00 a m  correct 
but they re owning your morning
by giving you and yourself 
and your mental health 
and your soul what it needs 
hi there 
have you seen this
girl  andrea evans 
no  uh  we just
got here yesterday 
i m sorry i can t
be more helpful 
you keep that 
there s a hotline you can
call if you ve seen anything 
search parties leave at 8 00
every morning from the church 
if you could spare the time 
yeah  okay 
uh  thank you  or  good luck 
take care 
double word score 
wow   door   wow  well done 
you are making this too easy 
my turn  all right 
all right  that was rude 
you really did it 
don t be mad 
what  no sophie  yes 
hey  gossip girl  we
need a second opinion 
uh  what is it 
 quakey  
uh  maybe 
we ll take that
as a yes  so that is
twenty one  double word score 
wait  why gossip girl 
i don t know  the
phone  the hair 
you are aware that
popular culture has evolved
over the last decade  tess  and 
maybe your references
are getting a little bit stale 
yeah  tess  mm hmm 
a reboot  with who 
hey 
um    so i think i m
gonna have to leave early 
i know  it s just  work is
really intense right now 
seriously  we re
here for my birthday 
i    yeah  i    sorry  i   
i don t really expect
you to understand 
you re right  i
don t understand 
i was under the impressionthat
we took the week off
so that we could
spend it together 
what are you taking
the week off from 
i m sorry  does
my work not count
because i don t get paid for it 
of course  your
work counts  tess 
your work is amazing 
sophie  that s not what
we re talking about right now 
hey hello 
guess what i brought 
what 
fireworks for tess  birthday 
it s a surprise so
don t say anything 
why are you doing
all this for her 
i think you should
cut her some slack 
this is a    it s a
milestone of a birthday 
and i think that she
is a little nervous
 cause    she thinks that
she should be further along 
i think she would expect
to be at simon s
level right now 
not that she would admit that 
anyway 
i thought we could have a picnic
at that little island
across the lake 
yeah  i don t want to be
in a boat with her right now 
stop it  it ll be fun 
sophie  i m serious 
maybe this is just about
our friendship not being
what it used to be 
whose friendship 
mine and tess  
i don t think you re being fair 
anyway  we all think our
worst thoughts at night 
you will not think this
way in the morning 
andrea 
andrea 
andrea 
i haven t let the girls
leave the house in days 
they re on the verge of mutiny 
if she s hurt  it s probably
someone she knows 
andrea 
andrea 
listen  forget
about the history 
we talked about
this over and over 
you ve told me you can t
be your real self around them 
when you ve seen them  do
you have a good time or not 
why do you put
yourself through this 
do you feel better or worse 
and i think you already
know what you have to do 
and there is a
really easy solution 
you don t need them
in your life anymore 
it s tough  i know it s tough 
part of growing up is
knowing when to let go 
hey  you missed
a really fun day 
hey  where were you 
i went out with one
of the search parties 
hmm  did you find her 
no 
so  definitely worth missing
spending the day with us  then 
all right  i need some
help at the wood shed 
can you help me out  mm hmm 
thank you 
fuck me 
okay  lesson number one 
this is a maul 
i never want to hear
you call it an ax  okay 
so look for the natural
splits in the wood 
get your distance 
feet like so okay 
and when you swing  you
want this hand to fall in line
with this hand 
so  like   
okay 
got it  yeah 
wow  you re good  well 
that was hardly anything 
okay 
nice 
shit 
alice  i think
we have enough

this meek little victim 
you sit there with this
placid look on your face 
i m here
trying to get through to you 
i m actually asking you
to do something

this is exactly what you do 
i m tired   
of carrying you 
  you say
  i only hear
what i want to
  you say
  i talk so
all the time
  so
  and i thought
what i felt was simple
  and i thought
that i don t belong
  and now
that i am leaving
  i thought that
i did something wrong
   cause i missed you
  yeah  yeah

hey 
why do you let him
pull this shit with you 
he s not    he s
not pulling anything 
i lied to him  he has
every right to be angry 
you lied  about what 
just    about being here 
alice  you can t tell your
supposed life partner
that you re going to go on
a trip with your best friends
and somehow that s your fault 
i can t think of a bigger red
flag than that  alice  it s not   
hey  can we just approach
this without judgment 
are you seriously
telling me that you have
no opinions about this 
of course i do  but
alice is a grown woman 
yes  and i don t
know how any of this is
your business 
when you re friends
with somebody  it means you care
about the other person 
but i guess that s a concept
simon managed to
erase from your brain
along with the rest of your
personality  tess  stop it 
maybe this is my
personality and i m changing 
and you re the shitty
friend for not  like 
letting me change 
we re not all content
to  like  flip between projects 
some of us have
real adult lives 
fucking a 40 year old
does not make you an adult 
he s 37 
yeah  he s a fucking clown 
and he s got this
stupid  smarmy accent
and his art is   
self indulgent 
derivative garbage 
you re just jealous because
he s successful and you re   
i m what 
simon loves me  i m happy 
is this what you think love is 
what would you know 
you ve never been
in a serious relationship 
romantic love isn t
the only kind of love 
only boring people think that 
okay  cool  i guess
i m boring then 
well  i mean  if the
shoe fits  i didn t say it 
god  i can t stand
you right now 
i can t stand you right now 
fuck  fuck  fuck

i made you a sandwich
in case you re hungry

thank you 
sophie s gone looking for you 
i think she s pissed at us 
i m sorry that i made you worry 
you good 
i don t want to go home 
then we ll stay 
sophie back yet 
no 
this ax is a piece of shit 
that s actually a maul 
ugh  great 
thank you for that 
 she felt very young 
 and at the same time
unspeakably aged 
 she sliced like a knife
through everything 
 she had a perpetual sense
of being out  out 
 far out to sea and alone 
 she always had
the feeling that it was
 very  very dangerous
to live even one day  
i like you reading me to sleep 
you were gone a while 
i needed some space 
you know  this trip isn t
just about you  tess 
you make me sound like a bully 
well   
i m not a bully 
oh  my god  stop 
wow  now that is cleared
up  who would like a donut 
hot chocolate 
yes  please yeah 
how did simon
know you were here 
he looked at my email 
he never would have let me come 
what 
yeah  he checks
things sometimes 
alice 
i know 
he always has a reason 
i take my phone into
the bathroom with me
now when i shower 
andrea 
andrea 
andrea 
i know this sounds crazy 
but sometimes it feels like   
like he can read my mind 
and  like    if he
can do that  then   
there s nowhere left that
i can actually be alone 
i never know what s
going to make him angry 
so i spend all this time
trying to be good  trying to
think of ways to be better 
like if i could just
purify my thoughts 
but you can t  i mean   
it s never good enough 
i    i don t know 
but he doesn t hurt me
or anything  you know 
he doesn t hurt you 
i really wish you would
have told us this sooner 
i didn t know what to say 
  happy birthday to you
happy birthday 
wow 
oh  you re a wise old lady now 
uh  i have always
been a wise old lady 
in spirit  at least 
now you are in body  too mm hmm 
i m just gonna go for it 
uh  i m sorry  but i don t think
this is enough chocolate chips 
whoa  excuse me 
is this how you treat
people on their birthday

chip to pancake ratio 
oh  my god 
we should go out tonight 
is there even
anything around here 
maybe the place
near the food mart 
i just don t know if it s open
this early in the season 
i could check if i had my phone 
do you want it back 
no 
not yet 
what will he do if he
doesn t hear from you 
i m not sure 
i could text him
and tell him that
you got hit by a bus 
oh  my god  tess 
oh  happy birthday 
happy birthday 
happy birthday  to me 
to you 
oh  jesus 
ugh 
no  i    i feel like i got one

try to tell me that i m clever
  but that won t take me
anyhow
oh  yeah
  or anywhere with you
  you said that i was naive
  and i thought
that i was strong
  i thought   hey

hmm  simon thinks
chips are disgusting 
nobody actually
thinks that  alice  he does 
 alice  that s enough   
 that s enough
saturated fats to   
 alice  that s enough
saturated fat to kill a horse 
 alice  alice   
 you ll regret that when you
get on the scale in the morning 
 you are going to get fat if
you keep eating like that  
what  do i just light it 
this was your idea 
that doesn t mean
i know how to do it 
just  i don t know 
light the string thing 
this thing  alice  yeah

sometimes i get a   
a word or a saying
stuck in my head 
like a   
phrase that keeps surfacing 
and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again
until it s all i can hear 
and for a while  it was
this voice asking me   
 what are the chances 
 what are the chances 
what are the chances  
what are the chances of what 
um  i don t know  maybe   
what are the chances i don t
come out on the other side 
what are the chances
i don t want to 
and lately  it s  um   
someone asking me   where
will you put your shame 
 where will you
