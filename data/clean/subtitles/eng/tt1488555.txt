what s going on 
dave s just acting
really weird 
how 
he s just doing
weird stuff 
like he wore his shower
sandals to work yesterday 
he forgot to pick up
the twins from daycare 
no  he didn t 
yeah  he did 
they had to sit there
for an hour and a half 
okay 
 crying  and then
last night he told me
that he wasn t
attracted to me any more 
i am going to kill him 
i just want you to tell me
something right now  okay 
and you have to be
totally honest with me 
sure 
you swear 
yeah 
is he having an affair 
no 
why did you
hesitate just then 
i didn t hesitate 
he s not having an affair 
 chuckles nervously 
jamie  jamie   
you guys are
just going through
a temporary rough
patch right now 
temporary rough patch 
what are you talking about 
we ve been in this
for years 
you have 
i love him  you know i love
him with all of my heart 
but he s   
you know his family 
growing up   
he had nothing  and so he was
always looking over the fence
because he wanted
a better life 
and that s why he worked
four jobs at once 
so that he could put
himself through school 
and he s amazing 
i mean 
nobody can do that 
but the problem is 
now that he has everything 
he can t turn it off 
and he still wants
more and more
and a second house  and
more kids  and a nicer car
and anything that he thinks
is going to make him happy 
and so he just
keeps working
and he s not paying
any attention to me 
and i m miserable 
oh  god 
because    i have huge feet 
 sobbing 
they re size 11 
my foot has grown a half
a size with each baby 
i have to go to this weird
online shoe store to get shoes 
and i just want him
to pay attention to me 
and i want him
to grab me
and kiss me
like he used to 
and it s like
you always say 
dave is a little
bit of a pussy 
i always say that 
yeah 
i always say that
because it s true 
dave is a little
bit of a pussy 
i hope that when
he makes partner 
he can just finally
stop and see   
and be happy 
you know 
because how can you
stay married to somebody
who is incapable
of being happy 
what are you saying 
 exclaims  holy fuck knuckles 
i ve got freckles on my taint 
how awesome is that 
hey  fag 
what are you doing here

there s no walking
out on this 
for once in your life  you got
to see something through 
what the fuck
does that mean 
i m going to be honest
with you  mitch 
because there s
a lot on the line here 
you are a quitter 
but quitting is not an
option on this one  okay 
you focus 
you find it 
i don t care where  but you find
it inside of yourself  okay 
i know it s there

50 hours  worth of obligations
on any given day 
make it work 
this is called
a grocery store 
people buy food here 
it s part of your responsibilities 
before heading
to the market 
always call jamie and ask her
if she needs anything first 
in fact  before making
any decision
in your life 
no matter how small 
call your wife first 
think of yourself as
a brain damaged mule 
lost in the desert 
helpless  dumb
and in constant
need of direction 
never take the initiative 
never strike out on your own 
and never deviate
from the plan  why 
because you are
a brain damaged mule
and you are lost
in the damn desert 
these are called children 
or dependants 
never disparage
your own child 
everything they do
is a miracle from god 
when they re bad 
it s only because
they re tired or
going through a phase 
when other kids are bad  it s
because of indulgent parenting
or innate defects in
the child s character 
be 15 minutes
early for everything

at other women 
you can t talk

you can t even be interesting
around other women 
 shushing  do everything in your
power to desexualize yourself 
wear a fanny pack 
drive a prius 
attach electronic devices to
your belt  whatever it takes 
and if you find yourself
forced to talk to a woman

the fact that you re married

hello 
dave  how are you

beautiful woman named pamela 
her name s pamela

wow  you can say  i do 
in english this time 
what 
is pamela from america 
yes

i m not going to
have anybody there 
the only family
i have is mitch 
i went to his apartment
a couple of days ago
and told him that
pamela would like him
to say a few words
at the wedding
and that wasn t true 
truth of the matter is  i would
like him to say a few words 
if he could find it
in his heart to do so 
i don t know why you
don t tell him yourself 
that is a very nice
thing for a son to hear 
so  you want me
to go tell mitch
that you would like
him at the wedding 
he s going to say 
 why the hell does
 he want me there 
he thinks i m an idiot  
well  that s not
totally true 
i think he s got
some nice qualities 
i think he s got
some problem areas  too 
what are those 
you re his friend  you
know him as well as i do 
you probably know him better than i do 
he s a quitter 
he has never finished
anything in his life 
he picks up something 
he puts it down 
he s good at it for five
minutes  and it s gone 
he s flaccid  no gumption 
no get up and go 
his accomplishments could rest
comfortably on an eyelash 
oh  he d probably say   fuck you
   if he heard you say that 
well  maybe he would
and maybe he wouldn t 
but i want him to
be part of my life 
with all due respect  mr 
planko  you don t know mitch 
what you don t
realize about him
is that he s
a fucking jedi 
a what 
he s a jedi knight  sir 
and next time you see him  he s
going to be slitting throats 
 car alarm beeps

and we always
come second 
and i don t think that s
ever going to change 
i ve got to go home now
because i have
this spanish test  so   
i can write you a note 
i guess deep down 
i m afraid that
i ll keep compromising
until getting the shit
end feels normal 
and then i ll be
so beaten down by life
that  just for a second 
i will consider asking
the homeless guy at the car wash
who looks like kris kristofferson
to rub my shoulders 
and i will 
and he will 
and you know what 
it ll be wonderful 
and i ll love it 
because why not 
 crying  i mean  i m not
getting anything here 
nobody s fucking me here 
you know  katie  this is exactly
why people get divorced 
i m so sorry 
i m so sorry

closer to leaving  am i 
no 
 organ playing game tunes

no way  phil niekro is my number
one favorite of all time 
why is my voice
so high 
 laughing 
woman  thank you
for coming in today 
my name is erin walsh 
and i ll be mediating
your claim 
any and all agreements made
during this mediation are binding
and carry with them
the full rights
and responsibilities
of the law
as stated in federal
code 325 a  section 4 
 inaudible 
kinkabe agrees in principle
to the terms of the sale
and valuates your company
at  625 million 
this is their best
and final offer 
ted  there is no way
we can make this deal 
flemming  six twenty five
is not the end of the world 
you ve just got to know
when it s time to quit 
fuck that noise 
we are not quitting 
i think you can
do better  ted 
i beg your pardon 
i don t see anybody
headed for the door 
this is just like trying to fuck a
catholic girl who keeps saying 
 no  i don t want to 
i m really drunk and you re circumcised  
but she keeps on
making out with you 
she s not leaving
your fiero   
it means she really wants to 
she just needs
a little bit of a nudge 
a little bit of a coax 
little bit of a tickle 
just to rationalize it
to herself  to her god 
do you know what i mean 
no  dave  we most definitely
do not know what you mean 
okay  what i mean is 
they want to spend more  they
just don t know it  all right 
if this really was
their final offer 
they d be leaving 
but they re not 
they re sticking around 
they ve got more money to spend 
she wants to unroll that rubber
at the bottom of her purse
that she put in there

jamie and dave 
for those of you who don t know

i was that nut sack s
best man 10 years ago

when we were kids  dave and i 
we had a lot of big plans 
dave  he was going
to be an astronaut 
and i was going to sell
dolphins on the black market 
 audience laughing 
 scoffs  astronaut 
there s a reason i m
not selling dolphins 
we live in atlanta 
they re tough to find 
and those things 
they don t sleep 
which also makes it
real hard to catch them 
but i think
that we all know
that life doesn t always turn
out exactly how you plan it 
sometimes 
just sometimes 
it turns out better 
dave   think
there s a reason
that you re not wa king
on the moon right now 
it s because you belong here 
in your life

sitting beside you

our kamikaze shots
to my two best friends
