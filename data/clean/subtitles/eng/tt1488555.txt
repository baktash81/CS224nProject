they had to sit there
for an hour and a half
okay
crying and then
last night he told me
that he wasnt
attracted to me any more
i am going to kill him
i just want you to tell me
something right now okay
and you have to be
totally honest with me
sure
you swear
yeah
is he having an affair
no
why did you
hesitate just then
i didnt hesitate
hes not having an affair
chuckles nervously
jamie jamie
you guys are
just going through
a temporary rough
patch right now
temporary rough patch
what are you talking about
weve been in this
for years
you have
i love him you know i love
him with all of my heart
but hes
you know his family
growing up
he had nothing and so he was
always looking over the fence
because he wanted
a better life
and thats why he worked
four jobs at once
so that he could put
himself through school
and hes amazing
i mean
nobody can do that
but the problem is
now that he has everything
he cant turn it off
and he still wants
more and more
and a second house and
more kids and a nicer car
and anything that he thinks
is going to make him happy
and so he just
keeps working
and hes not paying
any attention to me
and im miserable
oh god
because i have huge feet
sobbing
theyre size 11
my foot has grown a half
a size with each baby
i have to go to this weird
online shoe store to get shoes
and i just want him
to pay attention to me
and i want him
to grab me
and kiss me
like he used to
and its like
you always say
dave is a little
bit of a pussy
i always say that
yeah
i always say that
because its true
dave is a little
bit of a pussy
i hope that when
he makes partner
he can just finally
stop and see
and be happy
you know
because how can you
stay married to somebody
who is incapable
of being happy
what are you saying
exclaims holy fuckknuckles
ive got freckles on my taint
how awesome is that
hey fag
what are you doing here
three days to three weeks
you left the kids
at daycare
come on mitch
those are my kids
i cant do
this shit any more
no no no
you are going do this shit
you dont get
off that easy
my marriage is falling apart
my job is on the line
you are going to be the best
possible me you can be right now
dave you dont understand
i cannot do this
not even for another hour
youre gonna do it
i dont care youre going to
stay here and do this right
get out of my fucking way or ill
drown you in your own goddamn tub
easy motherfucker
if you leave now
get your hands off me
this friendship is over
fuck you
dont pull that shit on me
i got to get the fuck out of here
im serious mitch shut up
jamie and the kids
mean everything to me
theres no walking
out on this
for once in your life you got
to see something through
what the fuck
does that mean
im going to be honest
with you mitch
because theres
a lot on the line here
you are a quitter
but quitting is not an
option on this one okay
you focus
you find it
i dont care where but you find
it inside of yourself okay
i know its there
its not like
im not trying
i just dont know how to
do all your grownup crap
youre going to learn
this is called a suit
you wear one every day
along with a necktie
black not white socks
dress shoes not shower sandals
please these are awful
and of course underwear
oh come on
exclaims no more
commando mitch
youre a grownass man
put them on
this is called
a schedule
it tells you everything
you need to do each day
picku ps dropoffs
activities
playdates
doctors appointments etc
youll notice that there are approximately
50 hours worth of obligations
on any given day
make it work
this is called
a grocery store
people buy food here
its part of your responsibilities
before heading
to the market
always call jamie and ask her
if she needs anything first
in fact before making
any decision
in your life
no matter how small
call your wife first
think of yourself as
a braindamaged mule
lost in the desert
helpless dumb
and in constant
need of direction
never take the initiative
never strike out on your own
and never deviate
from the plan why
because you are
a braindamaged mule
and you are lost
in the damn desert
these are called children
or dependants
never disparage
your own child
everything they do
is a miracle from god
when theyre bad
its only because
theyre tired or
going through a phase
when other kids are bad its
because of indulgent parenting
or innate defects in
the childs character
be 15 minutes
early for everything
it doesnt matter what it is
a meeting an event
less stress for me
less stress for you
hey youre married
now jackass
you cant look
at other women
you cant talk
to other women
you cant even be interesting
around other women
shushing do everything in your
power to desexualize yourself
wear a fanny pack
drive a prius
attach electronic devices to
your belt whatever it takes
and if you find yourself
forced to talk to a woman
quickly find a way to mention
the fact that youre married
it doesnt even
have to make sense
hi how are you nice weather today

so i cant sleep with my wife i
cant sleep with other women
what the hell is that
marriage
i think thats everything
you got any
more questions
do you ever
have any free time

in his heart to do so

thing for a son to hear

hes a quitter
he has never finished
anything in his life
he picks up something
he puts it down
hes good at it for five
minutes and its gone
hes flaccid no gumption
no getupandgo
his accomplishments could rest
comfortably on an eyelash
oh hed probably say fuck you
if he heard you say that
well maybe he would
and maybe he wouldnt
but i want him to
be part of my life
with all due respect mr
planko you dont know mitch

our parents drive

come second
and i dont think thats
ever going to change
ive got to go home now
because i have
this spanish test so
i can write you a note
i guess deep down
im afraid that
ill keep compromising
until getting the shit
end feels normal
and then ill be
so beaten down by life
that just for a second
i will consider asking
the homeless guy at the car wash
who looks like kris kristofferson
to rub my shoulders
and i will
and he will
and you know what
itll be wonderful
and ill love it
because why not
crying i mean im not

why people get divorced

i didnt know
that about you
i was phil niekro for halloween
three years in a row as a kid
no way phil niekro is my number
one favorite of all time
why is my voice
so high
laughing
woman thank you
for coming in today
my name is erin walsh
and ill be mediating
your claim
any and all agreements made
during this mediation are binding
and carry with them
the full rights
and responsibilities
of the law
as stated in federal
code 325 a section 4
inaudible
kinkabe agrees in principle
to the terms of the sale
and valuates your company
at 625 million
this is their best
and final offer
ted there is no way
we can make this deal
flemming sixtwentyfive
is not the end of the world
youve just got to know
when its time to quit
fuck that noise
we are not quitting
i think you can
do better ted
i beg your pardon
i dont see anybody
headed for the door
this is just like trying to fuck a
catholic girl who keeps saying
no i dont want to
im really drunk and youre circumcised
but she keeps on
making out with you
shes not leaving
your fiero
it means she really wants to
she just needs
a little bit of a nudge
a little bit of a coax
little bit of a tickle
just to rationalize it
to herself to her god
do you know what i mean
no dave we most definitely
do not know what you mean
okay what i mean is
they want to spend more they
just dont know it all right
if this really was
their final offer
theyd be leaving
but theyre not
theyre sticking around
theyve got more money to spend
she wants to unroll that rubber
at the bottom of her purse
that she put in there
three semesters ago
how much more do you think
we can get out of them
ten million fifteen
pull those panties to the side
ted and take a hundred more
what
do not listen to him ted
he is beyond reckless
if we make too large a counter
offer we risk driving them away
ted it doesnt hurt to ask
you would not
believe the nasty shit
i get these girls to do
just by asking
honestly its revolting
it does seem odd that
theyre not leaving
punch her in the seat
you can tell kinkabe we
want an extra 100 million
and that is our final offer
because were leaving
fuel the jet lets go
for the record i did not support
that decision erin shouting
sir
sir mr kinkabe has
agreed to 725 million
the deal is closed
whooping
oh my god
all cheering

when we were kids dave and i
we had a lot of big plans
dave he was going
to be an astronaut
and i was going to sell
dolphins on the black market
audience laughing
scoffs astronaut
theres a reason im
not selling dolphins
we live in atlanta
theyre tough to find

they dont sleep

real hard to catch them
but i think
that we all know
that life doesnt always turn
out exactly how you plan it
sometimes
just sometimes
it turns out better
dave think
theres a reason
that youre not waking
on the moon right now
its because you belong here
in your life
with that incredible woman
sitting beside you

our kamikaze shots
