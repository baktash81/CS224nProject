block the neb corporation
has controlled mining
throughout the known solar systems
20 years ago on sirius 6b
the neb discovered the solution
to the energy crisis berynium
but mining berynium unleashed lethal
doses of radiation and pollution
the alliance a federation
of mine workers and scientists
demanded mining be stopped
the neb s reponse
was to declare allout war
this conflict has fuelled
a new cold war on earth
but so far the fighting
has been confined to sirius 6b
massive neb bombing raids have
devastated this beautiful planet
thousands have been killed
by deadly berynium radiation
now in the tenth year of the war
the survivors on sirius 6b
are faced with a new threat
beyond imagination
okay ante up
five
okay l see your five
back in the slammer
those were my last smokes
this game sucks
this whole place sucks
lieutenant l think youd
better have a look at this
what the hell is he doing here
tell the captain weve got
a situation a neb coming in
how did he get this far
lm going to take him
hes mine
what are you waiting for
somethings not right hes alone
here comes the cavalry
no matter how many times
l see this it still makes me sick
lm glad
those things are on our side
our sides the good side right
tell me again its a little blurry
we created them
we didnt have any choice
without the screamers
wed have lost the war
ls the neb still out there
yeah but not in one piece
just the one
what the hell was he doing out here
he had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us
well
l guess ld better take a look
are you going out there
thats a great plan
lts probably some kind of bomb
get off your butt
and open the goddamn door
check your tabs sir
cruclal to alllance com mander
who wrote this shit
mozart
don giovanni
don giovanni
what the hell do you want chuck
tear your eye away from that coin
and lll tell you
lts the portrait of a sphinx
lt belonged to augustus caesar the
first great emperor of the world
riddle me this caesar we havent
seen a neb soldier in six months
why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer
trying to hand deliver this
priority seven you and me    and
god if hes still paying attention
l doubt it
ls it a trick
l couldnt get into it either
dont do that
scared you didnt l
jesus
from marshall richard cooper
fifth neb army command
to joseph hendricksson
matters of extreme urgency
demand immediate
peace negotiation
request two officers
safe passage guaranteed
we await your arrival asap
peace negotiation
they sound pretty desperate
weve been waiting for this
what have we been waiting for
the end of the war
maybe its another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back
macdonald are you there
yes sir
l want the following message
transmitted to san francisco
have received first contact
from neb army in six months
they wish to open peace
negotiations please advise
we picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport

off of the shipping lanes
find out what their emergency is
no clearance no landing
joe what do you make of this
looks like a map
of the forward command post
theyre laying themselves open
so why the pony express
theyve been completely silent
for two weeks not even radio
but why just one guy
why not a patrol
secretary green is arriving
thank you macdonald
joe chuck l have some very
inspiring news for you all
alliance hq has been keeping
it classified wrapped up tight
the neb corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice
we could actually end this war
reserves of berynium
have been found on triton 4
after extensive testing
theres no sign of radioactivity
we are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement
wed also renew contracts
with the neb to mine on triton 4
these negotiations
are extremely delicate
and we cant afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart
sorry sir
fix it
theres radiation interference
give me the damn thing
morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit
lt is imperative to make no contact
with neb command on sirius 6b
lm sure you wont do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now
peace can you believe it
the nebs are businessmen
now theyre mining on triton 4
peace is in their interest
thank god for green
hes a good man
he prevented a war on earth
a war on earth
mightve done them some good
lf those assholes
rolled around in the mud
which assholes
nebs and us
we were all nebs once

lf you go outside without a tab on
youll lose your arm name
private michael jefferson
gunnery specialist on six levels
first class
level six you can shoot
the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards
lf you can load it l can shoot it
lnstructors used to call me ace
everybody here calls me sir
yes sir
sir what are they
lts a sword take a look
screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground
how do you know its dead
l yanked its brain out
thatll take your finger off
you said it was dead
lt still has
a mechanical surface reflex
they get shot up but can still
swing a sword pretty smart
maybe too smart
lt seems to have modified itself
wheres everybody else
the guys who were with me
how many men onboard
38 including me
now theres one including you
those guys
l didnt even know them
l couldnt even talk to them
jefferson    what in the hell
are you doing here
there was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture
l wasnt aware of that
you radioed you were civilian
where were you bound
triton 4
why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons
to invade attack
and extinguish the enemy
what enemy
the nebs
you were going to attack
the nebs on triton 4
yes    but were just a task force
4000 alliance army regulars are
on their way to triton 4 right now
secretary green informed us
secretary green
thats right
secretary green is gone
hes been gone
for almost two years
we got a v r communique
from him yesterday
secretary green was arrested and
eliminated by the alliance command
two years ago
dismissed
l enlisted to fight
dismissed jefferson
the nebs have been running
get out of here
what in gods name
are we doing chuck
we just saw green
we saw bullshit
you know as well as l do that
they can send us anything they want
that kid doesnt know policy
get your head out of the lilacs
do you expect me to believe
that were being dumped
that our 20year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush
they keep sending us provisions
will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe
l dont buy it
wake up man
we are betrayed here brother
we are beached
greens been shitcanned
and this whole place is a lie
they just cant
cut us off up here
families on earth would raise hell
and they wont take us back there
lf we sound off about this nobodys
going to fight their war for them
theyre just going to let us
roll on and on up here
we aint ever getting off here
marshall cooper and
his neb command knows it too
he sent us a map
your solitary neb grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing
they know its pointless now
where are you going
lm going to neb command
well make our own peace right here
neb said they wanted two men
somebodys got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky
lll take johnny gungho
the kid
lm not risking any more of our men
this is your tab
lt wont work for anybody but you
that makes me feel a lot better
screamers only attack living things
they read your pulse rate
your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat flatlining you
ln theory they work perfectly
but radioactivity corrodes them
what then
we thank god youre a good gunner
l was remembering that day
up in point reyes
that bartender
with the monkey
the beach we sat drinking beer
watching the humpbacks blowing
you watched the whales joe
l was watching other things

roger copy
the air is terrible out here
lts whats in the air
what radiation
thisll neutralize it here
lts an antiradiation red
thats what poisoned it
that used to be the most profitable
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy
lt produced berynium the answer
to the worlds energy question
a spoonful could take you from
earth to saturn in a day
then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation
we thought wed discovered gold
but we discovered shit
and you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs
how do you know its working
lf you dont die
god what happened here
blasts
neb bombers
they nuked the civilians
the civilians got in the way
the bombs were aimed at us
you just dont have a clue about
what brought you here do you
youd fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right
someone convinced you
not someone something
the alliance was formed
to support you
youre right jefferson and it
divided my country and my world
so as much as youre dying
to get shot by some neb soldier
were going to make peace
with these people you and me
were going to rip you off
of that experience
look at this place
l came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the neb
we were all nebs then
the scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines
the neb corporation threatened them
and there was a standoff for years
they they started to rain everything
down on us
nuclear disc bombs chain bombs
bacteria crystals
civilian survivors were evacuated
we retreated to the bunker
how did you fight back
we reinvented an early weapon
the sword
the autonomous mobile sword
the screamer
save it
they dont eat rats do they
were not sure
theyre scavengers and they learn
they use everything rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel
maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax
are they machines are they alive
l dont understand
l dont have the answers jefferson
but where are they coming from
underground
the first design was sent to us
from the alliance on earth
lts all automated now
no ones been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran
they make themselves now
and no one knows how
theyre down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows
