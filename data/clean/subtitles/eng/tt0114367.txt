block  the neb corporation   
  has controlled mining
throughout the known solar systems 
20 years ago  on sirius 6b   
  the neb discovered the solution
to the energy crisis  berynium 
but mining berynium unleashed lethal
doses of radiation and pollution 
  the alliance    a federation
of mine workers and scientists   
  demanded mining be stopped 
the neb  s reponse
was to declare all out war 
this conflict has fuelled
a new cold war on earth   
  but so far the fighting
has been confined to sirius 6b 
massive neb bombing raids have
devastated this beautiful planet 
thousands have been killed
by deadly berynium radiation 
now  in the tenth year of the war 
the survivors on sirius 6b  
  are faced with a new threat
beyond imagination      
  okay  ante up 
  five 
okay  l see your five 
  back in the slammer 
  those were my last smokes 
this game sucks 
this whole place sucks 
lieutenant  l think you d
better have a look at this 
what the hell is he doing here 
tell the captain we ve got
a situation  a neb coming in 
  how did he get this far 
  l m going to take him 
he s mine 
  what are you waiting for 
  something s not right  he s alone 
here comes the cavalry 
no matter how many times
l see this  it still makes me sick 
l m glad
those things are on our side 
our side s the good side  right 
tell me again  it s a little blurry 
we created them 
we didn t have any choice 
without the screamers
we d have lost the war 
  ls the neb still out there 
  yeah  but not in one piece 
just the one 
what the hell was he doing out here 
he had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us 
well      
l guess l d better take a look 
are you going out there 
that s a great plan 
lt s probably some kind of bomb 
get off your butt
and open the goddamn door 
check your tabs  sir 
cruclal  to alllance com mander
  who wrote this shit 
  mozart 
    don giovanni   
  don giovanni 
what the hell do you want  chuck 
tear your eye away from that coin 
and l ll tell you 
lt s the portrait of a sphinx 
lt belonged to augustus caesar  the
first great emperor of the world 
riddle me this  caesar  we haven t
seen a neb soldier in six months 
why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer  
  trying to hand deliver this 
priority seven  you and me       and
god  if he s still paying attention 
l doubt it 
  ls it a trick 
  l couldn t get into it  either 
  don t do that 
  scared you  didn t l 
jesus 
  from marshall richard cooper 
fifth neb army command   
  to joseph hendricksson 
matters of extreme urgency   
  demand immediate
peace negotiation   
  request two officers 
safe passage guaranteed   
  we await your arrival asap   
  peace negotiation 
  they sound pretty desperate 
  we ve been waiting for this 
  what have we been waiting for 
the end of the war 
maybe it s another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back 
  macdonald  are you there 
  yes  sir 
l want the following message
transmitted to san francisco 
have received first contact
from neb army in six months 
they wish to open peace
negotiations  please advise 
we picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport 
we re 5 million miles
off of the shipping lanes 
find out what their emergency is 
no clearance  no landing 
joe  what do you make of this 
looks like a map
of the forward command post 
  they re laying themselves open 
  so why the pony express 
they ve been completely silent
for two weeks  not even radio 
but why just one guy 
why not a patrol 
  secretary green is arriving 
  thank you  macdonald 
joe  chuck  l have some very
inspiring news for you all 
alliance hq has been keeping
it classified  wrapped up tight 
the neb corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice 
we could actually end this war 
reserves of berynium
have been found on triton 4 
after extensive testing 
there s no sign of radioactivity 
we are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement 
we d also renew contracts
with the neb to mine on triton 4 
these negotiations
are extremely delicate  
  and we can t afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart      
  sorry  sir 
  fix it 
  there s radiation interference 
  give me the damn thing 
morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit 
lt is imperative to make no contact
with neb command on sirius 6b 
l m sure you won t do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now 
peace  can you believe it 
the nebs are businessmen 
now they re mining on triton 4 
peace is in their interest 
  thank god for green 
  he s a good man 
he prevented a war on earth 
a war on earth
might ve done them some good 
lf those assholes
rolled around in the mud 
  which assholes 
  nebs and us 
  we were all nebs once 
  exactly 
l just want to go home 
what s the first thing you ll do 
l ve got no plans for the future 
  you have a lot to look forward to 
  lncome tax

when you get back 
  what for 
  you tell me 
she couldn t take it 
she s married and moved on      
      and l m still here 
not for long 
do you still think about her 
lt used to be every minute 
then once a day 
about twice a year
l get a kick in the chest 
what did she look like 
all personnel  radiation alert 
please light your reds 
l left mine in the office 
have you got one 
he must have been a brave man      
that neb soldier 
alert 
all personnel to their stations 
  they re not civilians 
  no  a troop transport  all ours 
  how bad is it 
  no survivors 
  then what the hell is that 
  get me out of here  man 
we re going to cut you out of here 
just hang on 
  sirius 6b transportation   
we ve got no transportation service 
  what the hell is that 
  you ve got to look at this 
  look at this 
  and this  lt s a bomb factory 
holy shit 
a nuclear reactor 
  when did we last see one of these 
  what s happening here 
come on 
  careful  are you all right 
  calm down  l m all right 
  get this man a tab

yeah 
at ease  we re informal around here 
that ll be all  rodgers 
  how are you doing 
  good       there s a scar on my arm 
lf you go outside without a tab on 
you ll lose your arm  name 
private michael jefferson 
gunnery specialist on six levels 
first class 
level six  you can shoot
the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards 
lf you can load it  l can shoot it 
lnstructors used to call me   ace   
  everybody here calls me   sir   
  yes  sir 
  sir  what are they 
  lt s a sword  take a look 
screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground 
  how do you know it s dead 
  l yanked its brain out 
  that ll take your finger off 
  you said it was dead 
lt still has
a mechanical surface reflex 
they get shot up  but can still
swing a sword  pretty smart 
maybe too smart 
lt seems to have modified itself 
where s everybody else 
the guys who were with me 
  how many men onboard 
  38  including me 
now there s one  including you 
those guys      
l didn t even know them 
l couldn t even talk to them 
jefferson       what in the hell
are you doing here 
there was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture 
  l wasn t aware of that 
  you radioed you were civilian 
  where were you bound 
  triton 4 
why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons 
to invade  attack
and extinguish the enemy 
  what enemy 
  the nebs 
you were going to attack
the nebs on triton 4 
yes       but we re just a task force 
4 000 alliance army regulars are
on their way to triton 4 right now 
  secretary green informed us      
  secretary green 
  that s right 
  secretary green is gone 
he s been gone
for almost two years 
we got a v  r  communique
from him yesterday 
secretary green was arrested and
eliminated by the alliance command 
two years ago 
dismissed 
  l enlisted to fight      
  dismissed  jefferson 
  the nebs have been running      
  get out of here 
what in god s name
are we doing  chuck 
  we just saw green 
  we saw bullshit 
you know as well as l do that
they can send us anything they want 
  that kid doesn t know policy 
  get your head out of the lilacs 
do you expect me to believe
that we re being dumped 
that our 20 year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush 
they keep sending us provisions 
will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe 
  l don t buy it 
  wake up  man 
we are betrayed here  brother 
we are beached 
green s been shit canned
and this whole place is a lie 
they just can t
cut us off up here 
families on earth would raise hell 
and they won t take us back there 
lf we sound off about this  nobody s
going to fight their war for them 
they re just going to let us
roll on and on up here 
we ain t ever getting off here 
marshall cooper and
his neb command knows it  too 
he sent us a map 
your solitary neb grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing 
they know it s pointless now 
  where are you going 
  l m going to neb command 
we ll make our own peace right here 
neb said they wanted two men 
somebody s got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky 
  l ll take johnny gung ho 
  the kid 
l m not risking any more of our men 
this is your tab 
lt won t work for anybody but you 
that makes me feel a lot better 
screamers only attack living things 
they read your pulse rate 
your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat  flat lining you 
ln theory they work perfectly 
but radioactivity corrodes them 
  what then 
  we thank god you re a good gunner 
l was remembering that day
up in point reyes 
  that bartender      
  with the monkey 
the beach  we sat drinking beer 
watching the humpbacks blowing 
you watched the whales  joe 
l was watching other things 
we should go back there 
l d like to see that again 
what  girls volleyball 
hey  joe      
l ll see you soon 
on that day  jefferson  are you
coming or are you breathing hard 
good luck 
cicero  this is libby 
radio check  over 
cicero reading you loud and clear 
next transmission will be 33 00
and then every 4 hours after that 
lf l miss one  don t sweat it 
lf l miss two      
      move into the office 
change the music and carry on 
l ll take the office  but the
  don giovanni   will have to go 
roger  copy 
  the air is terrible out here 
  lt s what s in the air 
  what  radiation 
  this ll neutralize it  here 
  lt s an anti radiation red 
  that s what poisoned it 
that used to be the most profitable 
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy 
lt produced berynium  the answer
to the world s energy question 
a spoonful could take you from
earth to saturn in a day 
then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation 
we thought we d discovered gold      
but we discovered shit 
and you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs 
  how do you know it s working 
  lf you don t die 
  god  what happened here 
  blasts 
  neb bombers 
  they nuked the civilians 
the civilians got in the way 
the bombs were aimed at us 
you just don t have a clue about
what brought you here  do you 
you d fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right 
  someone convinced you 
  not someone  something 
the alliance was formed
to support you 
you re right  jefferson  and it
divided my country and my world 
so as much as you re dying
to get shot by some neb soldier   
  we re going to make peace
with these people  you and me 
we re going to rip you off
of that experience 
look at this place 
l came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the neb 
we were all nebs then 
the scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines 
the neb corporation threatened them 
and there was a stand off for years 
they they started to rain everything
down on us 
nuclear disc bombs  chain bombs 
bacteria crystals 
civilian survivors were evacuated 
we retreated to the bunker 
  how did you fight back 
  we reinvented an early weapon 
  the sword 
  the autonomous mobile sword 
the screamer 
save it 
they don t eat rats  do they 
we re not sure 
they re scavengers and they learn 
they use everything  rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel 
maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax 
are they machines  are they alive 
l don t understand      
l don t have the answers  jefferson 
  but where are they coming from 
  underground 
the first design was sent to us
from the alliance on earth 
lt s all automated now 
no one s been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran 
  they make themselves now 
  and no one knows how 
they re down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows 
am l speaking swahili 
that s exactly what l mean 
hit the dirt 
come out of there 
come out of there 
come forward 
  stop 
  can l come with you 
my god      
  cover me 
  go 
jefferson 
you all right  lt s okay 
what have you got there 
let me see 
that s a good guy 
no  you keep him 
that s your friend 
where do you live 
  ln there 
  yes 
ln the ruins 
how many are you 
how many people 
  you re alone  how do you survive 
  food 
  what kind of food 
  different 
how do you keep away
from the screamers 
  the blades underground that kill 
  l hide 
  can l come with you 
  no  you stay here 
give me a macro ration 
we ll give you something to eat 
we ll come back for you 
ln two or three days we ll find you 
take this 
you tear this and eat it 
  l want to come with you now 
  we ll come back in two days 
you take care of this guy  okay 
we can t just leave him here 
he s a kid  he ll never survive 
  what am l saying 
  can l come with you 
  what s your name 
  david edward dearing 
  where s your mum and dad 
  they died in the blasts 
you ve been alone here
for four years 
everything seems to be okay 
ls it safe to make a fire like this 
we want to let them know
we re coming 
  fire keeps the rats away 
  rats 
l had this friend 
he used to eat them  rats 
you ll appreciate this      
you don t just heat up the oil 
that makes them stick to the pan 
you get the pan hot  put the oil
in cold  then add your rats 
but don t crowd the pan 
it sucks all the heat out 
you keep flipping them 
or they burn 
  my friend said    
  jefferson 
you must be confusing me
with somebody who gives a shit 
give me that rock  boy 
cicero  this is libby calling 
  come in  cicero 
  libby  how is it out there 
lt s cold 
we re at 1 4 degrees north latitude 
we expect to reach
the neb command

he came in yesterday 
chuck  you re breaking up 
you ll get your next transmission

the water dries out

lf you put a teddy bear
in a microwave  nothing will happen 
  but a wet frog      
  shut up 
jefferson 
goddamn screamer 
lt wanted to kill us 
lt can see us and touch us 
l can t tell what the signals say 
lt can talk 
  he s a fucking toaster 
  that s right 
pinocchio s not a real little boy 
  why didn t it try to kill us 
  lt was tagging you 
they re smarter now  they get
into our bunkers  they tag along 
who can resist a kid
with a hard luck story 
once it gets inside  the killing
starts  but you knew that already 
  you brought him in here 
  lt found us 
what is your reason for being here 
we were invited here
for a peace negotiation 
marshall cooper sent this
from neb headquarters 
you want to negotiate     
we ain t gonna do it here

fighting won t solve our problems 
one of those kids tagged my patrol 
we took him into our bunker 
  nobody got out 
  except you
