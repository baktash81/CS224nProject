why  do i look older 
alberta scrubb 
that s a typographical error 
it s supposed to be albert a  scrubb 
edmund   
you re supposed to be helping me
with the groceries 
better luck next time  eh  squirt 
squirt 
he barely had two years on me 
i m a king  i ve fought wars
and i ve led armies 
not in this world 
yeah  instead i m stuck here 
doing battle   
with eustace clarence scrubb 
if anyone so deserved a name 
what are you doing 
nothing 
come on then 
dear diary  it is now day 253   
since my wretched cousins
edmund and lucy invaded our house 
not sure how much longer
i can cope living with them   
having to share my things 
if only one could treat relatives
like one treats insects   
all my problems would be solved 
i could simply put them in a jar
or pin them to my wall 
i m home  hello 
note to self 
investigate legal ramifications   
of impaling relatives 
that concludes
the war news from the western front 
hello  uncle harold 
i tried to find some carrots   
but all they had were turnips again 
shall i start making soup 
aunt alberta s on her way home 
uncle harold 
father  edmund s making faces at you 
why  you little   
father  he s gonna hit me 
edmund  look 
it s from susan 
i do wish you were here with us 
it s been such an adventure 
but nothing like our times in narnia 
america is very exciting   
except we never see father 
he works so very hard 
i was invited   
    to the british consul s tea party
this week by a naval officer   
who happens to be very handsome 
i think he fancies me 
it seems the germans have made
the crossing difficult right now 
times are hard 
mother hopes you both won t mind
another few months in cambridge  
another few months 
how will we survive 
you re lucky   
at least you ve got your own room 
i m stuck with mullet mouth 
susan and peter are the lucky ones 
off on adventures 
yeah  they re the eldest
and we re the youngest 
we don t matter as much 
do you think i look anything like susan 
lucy   
have you seen this ship before 
yes  it s very narnian looking  isn t it 
yeah 
just another reminder
that we re here and not there 
there once were two orphans
who wasted their time
believing in narnian nursery rhymes
  please let me hit him 
  no 
  don t you ever knock 
  it s my house  i ll do as i please 
you re just guests 
what s so fascinating
about that picture anyway 
it s hideous 
you won t see it
from the other side of the door 
edmund  it looks like
the water is actually moving 
what rubbish 
see  that s what happens   
when you read all those fanciful novels
and fairy tales of yours 
there once was a boy called eustace
who read books
full of facts that were useless
people who read fairy tales   
are always the sort who become
a hideous burden to people like me   
who read books with real information 
 hideous burden  
i haven t seen you lift a finger
since we ve been here 
i have a mind to tell your father
you stole aunt alberta s sweets 
  liar 
  oh  really 
edmund  the painting 
i found them under your bed 
and you know what 
i licked every one of them 
ugh  i m infected with you 
what s going on here 
  lucy  do you think    
  it s some kind of trick 
stop it or i ll tell mother 
mother 
mother 
i ll just smash the rotten thing 
no  eustace  no 
we can t stop it 
get off me  get off 
let go of it  eustace  put it down 
  get off it 
  let go 
edmund 
edmund 
what s happening 
where are we 
eustace  swim 
what s going on 
eustace  come on 
come on  move 
keep swimming 
edmund 
it s all right  i ve got you 
caspian 
lucy 
edmund  it s caspian 
it s all right  boys  you re safe now 
are we in narnia 
yes  you re in narnia 
i don t want to go 
i want to go back to england 
i m going back to england 
hold on 
that was thrilling 
how in the world did you end up here 
i have no idea 
caspian 
edmund 
it s great to see you 
  great to see you 
  didn t you call for us 
no  not this time 
well  whatever the case 
i m just glad to be here 
  now calm down  sir 
  get that thing off me 
get that thing off me 
reepicheep 
your majesties 
hello  reep  what a pleasure 
the pleasure is all mine  sir 
but first  what to do
about this hysterical   
interloper 
that giant rat thing   
just tried to claw my face off 
i was merely trying   
to expel the water   
from your lungs  sir 
it talked  did you see 
did anyone just hear that  it just talked 
  he always talks 
  it s getting him to shut up that s the trick 
the moment there is nothing to be said 
your highness   
i promise you  i will not say it 
i don t know what kind of prank this is 
but i want to wake up right now 
perhaps we could throw him back 
edmund 
i demand to know 
just where in the blazes am i 
you re on the dawn treader   
the finest ship in narnia s navy 
was it something i said 
see to him  will you 
your majesty 
men   
behold our castaways   
edmund the just
and lucy the valliant   
high king and queen of narnia 
aslan 
look   
susan s bow and arrows 
lucy 
my healing cordial   
and dagger 
oh  may i 
of course  they re yours 
peter s sword 
yes 
i looked after it as promised 
here  hold it if you wish 
no  no  it s yours 
peter gave it to you 
i did save this for you though 
thanks 
since you left  the giants of the north
surrendered unconditionally   
then we defeated the calormen armies
at the great desert 
there is peace across all of narnia 
peace 
in just three years 
and have you found yourself a queen
in those three years 
no  not one to compare with your sister 
hang on 
if there are no wars to fight   
and no one is in trouble 
then why are we here 
it s a good question 
i ve been asking myself the same thing 
so where are we sailing to 
before i took back the throne
from my uncle   
he tried to kill my father s closest friends
and most loyal supporters 
the seven lords of telmar 
they fled to the lone islands 
no one has heard from them since 
so you think something
has happened to them 
well  if it has  it s my duty to find out 
well  what s east of the lone islands 
uncharted waters 
things you can barely imagine 
tales of sea serpents and worse 
sea serpents 
all right  captain   
that s enough of your tall tales 
where sky and water meet
where the waves grow ever sweet
doubt not  you reepicheep
to find all that you seek
there is the utter east
doubt not   
that s pretty 
thank you 
a dryad sung it to me
when i was just a mouseling 
i can t divine the meaning 
but i ve never forgotten the words 
what do you think is past
the lone islands  reep 
well  i ve been told the furthest east
one can sail is to the end of the world 
aslan s country 
do you really believe
there s such a place 
well  we have nothing  if not belief 
do you think you could
actually sail there 
well  there is only one way
of finding that out 
i can only hope i will one day
earn the right to see it 
your majesty 
come on 
you ve grown stronger  my friend 
seems i have 
all right  back to work 
  your highness 
  thank you 
edmund   
do you think if we keep sailing   
to the end of the world   
we ll just    tip off the edge 
don t worry  lu 
we re a long way from there 
i see you re still talking nonsense 
the two of you 
are you feeling better 
yes  no thanks to you 
it s lucky i have an iron constitution 
as effervescent as ever  i see 
find your sea legs 
never lost them 
simply dealing with the shock of things 
mother says i have an acute disposition 
due to my intelligence 
i don t think he has a cute anything 
i ll have you all know 
as soon as we find civilization   
i m contacting the british consul 
have you all arrested for kidnapping 
kidnapping  is it 
that s funny 
i thought we saved your life 
you held me against my will 
did i 
in  what i must say 
are the most unhygienic quarters 
it s like a zoo down there 
he s quite the complainer  isn t he 
he s just warming up 
land ho 
the lone islands 
the port of narrowhaven 
strange  not a narnian flag in sight 
but the lone islands
have always been narnia s 
seems suspicious 
i say we prepare a landing party 
drinian 
forgive me  your majesty   
but the chain of command starts
with king caspian on this ship 
right 
we ll use longboats 
drinian  pick some men
and come ashore 
  aye 
  tavros 
man the longboats  furl the sail
and prepare to drop anchor 
onward 
the thrill of the unknown lies ahead 
couldn t this have waited
till the morning 
there is no honor in turning away
from adventure  lad 
listen 
where is everyone 
come on  jelly legs 
i m capable of doing it myself 
and you re certain
he s related by blood 
reepicheep  stay here with drinian s men
and secure the place 
we ll head on 
if we don t come back by dawn 
send a party 
yes  your majesty 
yeah  looks like nobody is in 
do you think we should head back 
do you want to come here and guard   
something 
yes 
good idea  cousin 
very logical 
i ve got it  i ve got it  don t worry 
i m ready to go when you are 
who are all these people 
why have they been crossed out 
it looks like some kind of fee 
slave traders 
look out 
unless you want to hear this one
squeal like a girl again   
i d say you should   
drop your weapons 
  like a girl 
  now 
put it down 
eustace 
put them in irons 
come on  come here  you 
get your hands off me 
let s take these two to market 
let go 
send those two to the dungeons 
listen to me  you insolent fool 
i am your king 
you re gonna pay for that 
actually   
someone else is going to pay   
for all of you 
  no  edmund  edmund 
  lucy 
no  edmund 
you all right 
yeah 
it s hopeless 
you ll never get out 
who s there 
nobody  just a voice   
in my head 
lord bern 
perhaps once  but i m no longer
deserving of that title 
is he one of the seven 
your face   
you remind me of a king
i once loved well 
that man was my father 
oh  my lord 
  please forgive me 
  no  please 
please 
no 
no 
helaine 
  mummy 
  no 
helaine 
  mummy 
  please 
mummy 
get back 
  mummy 
  stay with daddy 
don t worry  i ll find you 
mummy 
no 
where are they taking them 
keep watching 
what happened 
it s a sacrifice 
where did they go 
no one knows 
the mist was first seen in the east 
reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea 
we lords made a pact   
to find the source of the mist
to destroy it 
they each set sail   
but none came back 
you see  if they don t sell you
to the slave traders   
you re likely to be fed to the mist 
we have to find lucy   
before it s too late 
  i bid 60 
  i bid 80 
100 for the little lady 
120 
150 
any more bids 
sold 
come on  move 
move 
and now   
for this   
fine specimen   
who ll kick off the bidding 
come on now   
he may not look like much
but he s strong 
yeah  he s strong  all right 
smells like the rear end of a minotaur 
that is an outrageous lie 
i won the school hygiene award
two years running 
come on  someone make a bid 
i ll take them off your hands 
i ll take them all off your hands 
for narnia 
narnia 
guards  guards  move yourselves 
thanks  reep  i knew you d come 
your highness 
get the keys 
keys 
oh  you re a boat in a magical land 
can t you row yourself 
oh  god  i hope that wasn t
the british consul 
your majesty  your majesty 
hold it 
my wife was taken just this morning 
it s all right  drinian 
i beg you  take me with you 
gael 
  i want to come 
  no  gael  stay with your aunt 
i m a fine sailor

of course  you must 
  thank you 
  but  daddy 
have i ever not come back 
now be good 
my king 
my king 
this was given to me by your father 
i hid it safely in a cave all these years 
that s an old narnian sword 
it s from your golden age 
there are seven such swords 
gifts from aslan to protect narnia 
your father entrusted them to us 
here  take it 
and may it protect you 
thank you  my lord 
and we shall find your lost citizens 
edmund 
dear diary  there has been
an extraordinary turn of events 
i ve been abducted by my cousins   
and set adrift in uncharted waters
in some ridiculous looking boat 
what s worse is i share quarters
with an obnoxious mouse thing 
and i thought bunking with
my cousin was bad enough 
so far  every person i ve met
in this strange place   
suffers from the most florid delusions 
chasing green mists
and looking for lost lords 
i can only assume that this is   
the result of poor diet 
or they re all just barking mad 
cousin edmund is no exception 
he spends every spare second
rubbing that tin sword of his   
like it s some magic lantern 
poor fool clearly needs a hobby 
it s going to be magnificent 
do they come in a smaller size 
peeving marmot 
he s even more deluded than my cousin 
in england  we have mouse traps
for that sort of thing 
speaking of food  you don t know
where i could get any  do you 
why are you talking to that bird 
i just naturally assumed you can   
he s talking to birds 
he s mad as a loon  that one 
yeah 
go on  get off 
are you aware   
that stealing rations
is a capital offense at sea 
up here 
oh  you 
men have been keelhauled for less 
for what 
for treason   
and sneakiness
and general nuisancery 
look  just hand over the orange
and we ll let the matter pass 
i don t know what you re talking about 
allow me to cla   
look  i ve had quite enough of you 
unhand the tail 
the great aslan himself
gave me this tail 
no one   
repeat  no one touches the tail 
period 
exclamation mark 
sorry 
now  i will have the orange   
then i will have satisfaction 
please  i m a pacifist 
en garde 
  watch it 
  sorry 
trying to run away 
we re on a boat  you know 
look  can t we just discuss this 
that was for stealing   
that was for lying   
and that was for good measure 
that s the spirit 
we have ourselves a duel 
catch 
now  come on 
take your best shot 
is that it  come on  boy 
focus  focus 
yes 
stop flapping your wings
like a drunken pelican  poise 
keep your blade up 
up  up  that s it 
now   
over here 
now  lunge with your foot 
not your left  your right 
got it  come on 
be nimble  be nimble 
it s a dance  boy  a dance 
come on now  again and again 
that s right  that s right 
oh  no 
and that   
is that 
look 
gael 
what are you doing here 
here 
looks like we have an extra   
crew member 
welcome aboard 
your majesty 
call me lucy 
come on 
come on  look lively 
back to work 
good match 
i ll make a swordsman of you yet 
yes  well  if the playing field
were a little more even   
it would ve been
an entirely different result 
indeed 
it looks uninhabited 
but if the lords followed the mist east 
they would have stopped here 
could be a trap 
or it could hold some answers 
caspian 
we ll spend the night on shore 
scour the island in the morning 
aye  your majesty 
seems they ve brought a pig 
this one  it s female 
so is this one 
this one reads 
let s take her 
there is no escape 
  well put 
  scary 
  yeah 
  what are you 
we are terrifying invisible beasts 
if you could see us 
you would be really intimidated 
you forgot to mention
that we are very large 
  well  what do you want 
  you 
you ll do what we ask 
  she will 
  very clear 
  well put 
  yeah 
or what 
or death 
death  death  death 
death  death  death 
well  i wouldn t be much use
to you dead  would i 
i hadn t thought of that 
no  you hadn t 
fair point 
all right 
then we ll just kill your friends 
good idea 
what do you want with me 
you will enter the house   
of the oppressor 
what house 
this one 
upstairs  you ll find
the book of incantations 
recite the spell
that makes the unseen seen 
well put  chief  well put 
yeah 
yeah 
well  go on  we haven t got all day 
remember what will happen
to your friends 
you ve been warned 
yeah  yeah 
  yeah 
  right 
right 
yeah 
why don t you do it yourselves 
we can t read 
can t write either  as a matter of fact 
or add 
yeah 
why didn t you just say so 
beware the oppressor 
he s very oppressive 
 what makes the unseen seen   got it 
don t forget 
  don t forget that 
  yeah 
ed 
ed  wake up 
wake up  look 
where s lucy 
lucy 
lucy 
everybody up 
get up 
get up  i said 
this way 
move  you blackguards 
 with these words
your tongue must sew
for all around there to be snow 
 an infallible spell
to make you she
the beauty you ve always wanted to be 
susan  what s going   
   on 
i m beautiful 
no  wait 
 make me she  whom i d agree    
lucy 
lucy 
aslan 
aslan 
 a spell to make the unseen seen  
 like the  p  in psychology
the  h  in psychiatry
invisible ink
and the truth in theology
caspian  lucy s dagger 
stop right there or perish 
the spell is complete
now all is visible 
  what sort of creatures are you 
  big ones   
with the head of a tiger
and the body of a   
different tiger 
you don t want to mess with us 
or what 
or i ll claw you to death 
and i ll ram my tusks right through you 
and i ll gnash you with my teeth 
and i ll bite you with my fangs 
you mean squash us
with your fat bellies 
yes 
fat bellies 
tickle us with your toes 
what have you done with my sister 
you little pip squeak 
now  calm down 
where is she 
  you better tell him 
  go on  chief  tell him 
in the mansion 
what mansion 
that mansion 
i m really getting tired
of you all leaving me behi   
  it s the pig 
  the pig has come back 
this place just gets weirder and weirder 
  weird 
  him calling us weird 
the oppressor 
the oppressor  the oppressor 
lucy 
your majesty 
caspian and edmund 
this is coriakin  it s his island 
that s what he thinks 
you have wronged us  magician 
i have not wronged you 
i made you invisible
for your own protection 
protection 
  that s oppressive 
  oppressor 
i have not oppressed you 
but you could ve  if you d wanted to 
begone 
it s a spell 
what was that 
lint 
but don t tell them 
what were those things 
dufflepuds 
right  of course  silly me 
what did you mean when you said you
made them invisible for their own good 
it seemed the easiest way
to protect them   
from the evil 
you mean the mist 
i mean what lies behind the mist 
that s quite beautiful 
i mean  for a make believe map
of a make believe world 
there is the source of your troubles 
dark island 
a place where evil lurks 
it can take any form  it can make
your darkest dreams come true 
it seeks to corrupt all goodness   
to steal the light from this world 
how do we stop it 
you must break its spell 
that sword you carry   
there are six others 
  have you seen them 
  yes 
the six lords  they passed through here 
indeed 
where were they headed 
where i sent them 
to break the spell   
you must follow the blue star   
to ramandu s island 
there  the seven swords
must be laid at aslan s table 
only then can their true
magical power be released 
but beware   
you are all about to be tested 
tested 
until you lay down the seventh sword 
evil has the upper hand 
it will do everything   
in its power   
to tempt you 
be strong 
don t fall to temptation 
to defeat the darkness out there   
you must defeat the darkness
inside yourself 
for reasons beyond my comprehension   
we ve taken the advice
of a senile old coot   
who doesn t possess a razor
and dawdles around in a dressing gown 
so we re back in this tub
and lost in a tempest  brilliant 
hold 
three spokes to starboard 
aye aye  sir 
more pails here 
pass it down 
heave 
fourteen days of being tossed like a
pancake and not the slightest sign of land 
the only consolation is 
everyone is finally   
as miserable as i am 
except for that show off talking rat 
he s one of those annoying
glass is always half full types 
so we re stuck here   
at half rations  with food and water
for two more weeks  maximum 
this is your last chance to turn back 
your majesties 
there s no guarantee we ll spot
the blue star anytime soon 
not in this storm 
needle in a haystack 
trying to find this ramandu place 
we could sail right past it
and off the edge of the world 
or get eaten by a sea serpent 
i m just saying the men
are getting nervous 
these are strange seas we re sailing   
the likes of which
i ve never seen before 
then perhaps  captain  you would like
to be the one to explain to mr  rhince   
that we re abandoning
the search for his family 
i ll get back to it 
just a word of warning 
the sea can play nasty tricks
on the crew s mind 
very nasty 
transform my reflection
cast into perfection
lashes  lips and complexion
make me she
whom i d agree
holds more beauty over me
ladies and gentlemen   
miss pevensie 
she s quite a looker  swell 
edmund 
you look beautiful  sister 
as always 
peter 
excuse me  miss  can i get a photo 
mother s going to love this 
all her children in one picture 
smile 
hang on  where am i 
i mean  where s lucy 
lucy  who s lucy 
susan  what s wrong 
come on now  miss  nice big smile 
edmund  i m not sure about all this 
i think i want to go back 
go back where 
to narnia 
what on earth is narnia 
what s going on  stop this 
lucy 
aslan 
what have you done  child 
i don t know 
that was awful 
but you chose it  lucy 
i didn t mean to choose all of that 
i just wanted to be beautiful like susan 
that s all 
you wished yourself away 
and with it much more 
your brothers and sister wouldn t
know narnia without you  lucy 
you discovered it first  remember 
i m so sorry 
you doubt your value 
don t run from who you are 
aslan 
father  father   
edmund  edmund 
come with me  join me 
edmund 
oh  lucy 
i can t sleep 
let me guess 
bad dreams 
so either we re all going mad   
or something is playing with our minds 
i doubt the lords stopped here  my liege 
there s no sign of anything living 
right 
well  once we get ashore  take your men
and search for food and water 
the three of us will look for clues 
hang on  you mean the four of us 
come on  please don t
send me back to the rat 
i heard that 
big ears 
i heard that too 
go on  unload it all 
look  we re not the first ones
on this island 
the lords 
could be 
what do you think could be down there 
let s find out 
what s that 
i don t know 
looks like some sort of gold statue 
he must have fallen in 
poor man 
you mean   poor lord  
the crest of lord restimar 
and his sword 
we need it 
be careful 
your sword hasn t turned to gold 
both the swords are magical 
here 
he mustn t have known what hit him 
maybe 
or maybe he was onto something 
what are you talking about 
what are you staring at 
whoever has access to this pool   
could be the most powerful
person in the world 
lucy  we d be so rich 
no one could tell us what to do   
or who to live with 
you can t take anything
out of narnia  edmund 
says who 
i do 
i m not your subject 
you ve been waiting for this 
haven t you 
to challenge me 
you doubt my leadership 
you doubt yourself 
you re a child 
and you re a spineless sap 
edmund 
i m tired of playing second fiddle 
first it was peter and now it s you 
you know i m braver than both of you 
why do you get peter s sword 
i deserve a kingdom of my own 
i deserve to rule 
if you think you re so brave  prove it 
no 
stop it 
both of you 
look at yourselves 
can t you see what s happening 
this place has tempted you 
it s bewitching you 
this is exactly what coriakin
was talking about
