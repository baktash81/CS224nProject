i have a quarterback thats put his
socks on backwards since high school

nobodys missing a porpoise

porpoise has an abrupt snout
while the bottlenosed dolphin

teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage

i dont even wanna know
why your pants are missing
you couldve cost me my job
so you found a pebble
in snowflakes tank ill call cnn
i found it in the filter thank you
and its not a pebble its a rare
triangular cut orange amber
whatre you talking about
tonight i saw the same stone
in camps ring
i thought you said camp didnt do it
no his ring wasnt missing a stone
but whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his
ring what ring
the 1984 dolphin afc championship ring
i find the ring with a missing stone
i find snowflake
how you gonna do that
simple
loser
why dont you learn how to drive pal
you wanna play
damn it
that stone couldve come from anywhere
it couldve come from
a necklace or a pendant an earring
it came from an 84 afc
championship ring
einhorn thinks it may have been
an animalrights group you know fan
free animals now started by chelsea
daughter of industrialist fisher gamble
over half a million members worldwide
no who are they
did you know
they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots
what do you feed your dog
dog food why
he is miserable
what are you talking about
hes very unhappy i feel sorry for him
bad diet isolated environment
its amazing hes still alive
youre just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didnt work out
you cant express anger
yeah and youre ugly
im not even gonna talk to you
would you please leave
why so you can beat him
fatty
youre unbelievable
hiring you was the biggest mistake
i ever made
well why dont you cry about it
saddlebags
you like her huh
yeah shes all right
look melissa i
im here at the north beach towers
condo complex in north miami
where roger podacter head of
operations for the miami dolphins
has apparently committed suicide
allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20thstory balcony
you okay
i told you i was in my apartment
across the hall
i heard a scream
so i called the manager
the place was empty except for the dog
i opened the balcony door
and looked out
splat bang pancake time
okay thank you very much
hi there fella
have a bad night
so
animals can sense evil
who let dr doolittle in
lieutenant he came with miss robinson
this is police business well let you
know if the coroner finds a tick
face it
forget it shes right
besides
i wouldnt want someone tracing
my steps pointing out my mistakes
so
you dont think this is an obvious
suicide mr pet detective
i wouldnt say that theres plenty
of evidence here to support your theory
except of course for that
spot of blood on the railing
may i tell you what i think happened
alrighty then
roger podacter went out after work
had a few drinks then came home
he wasnt alone someone else
was with him there was a struggle
and he was thrown over that balcony
roger podacter didnt commit suicide
he was murdered
thats a very entertaining story
but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called
evidence
i think i heard a toilet flush
maybe somebody lost a turtle
well i
i guess im out of my league here
good work
there is just
one more thing lieutenant
this woman is roger podacters neighbor
she said she heard a scream right
and you had to open
the balcony door when you came in
thats true
youre sure you had to open this door
im certain
whats the point ventura
only this
this is doublepaned soundproof glass
there is no way
she could have heard
podacter scream on the way down
the scream she heard
came from inside
before he was thrown off the balcony
the murderer closed the door upon going
can you feel that buddy
i have exorcized the demons
this house is clear
losers
get him out of here
losers losers
lets go ace
losers
come on
back to the zoo
what are you thinking
this whole thing is connected somehow
i want to find that other ring
ace you checked all the rings
receipts what about receipts
theres gotta be receipts
that was pretty impressive
what you did at the apartment
you dont have to tell me
i was there
maybe you shouldve joined the police
force become a real detective
i dont do humans
you really love animals
if it gets cold enough
no i have a kinship with them
i understand them
wanna hear something spooky
sure
one time when i was about 12 i had
a dream that i was being followed by
a big dog with rabies
he had these bloodshot eyes
and foam came out of his mouth
no matter how fast i ran he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me
then just before i got
to my front door
he jumped and sank his teeth in
thats when i woke up
and felt the back of my neck
check that out
bastard
im sorry i just couldnt help myself
want to know why i do this
im not sure anymore
you better be sure
because once you get
inside my head
theres no turning back
so
are these all theres only a dozen
maybe its in another file
in the back
who the hell is that
what
that
who the hell is that
thats ray finkle the kicker
dont you know who he is
why isnt he in this picture
this was taken earlier in the year
ray finkle wasnt added till midseason
he missed the final field goal
in the super bowl that year
cost the dolphins the game
but he got himself a ring didnt he
definitely
replacement kicker
having a great year
ready for super bowl
allstar kicker boasts
field goal sails wide
dolphins lose super bowl
the kick heard round the world
that was finkle
the dolphins lost by one point
poor guy
poor guy with a motive baby
where is he now
i heard he went back
to his hometown in collier county
really
youre gonna drop me off before you go
no way you shouldnt be
left alone right now
it might not be safe at your apartment
what do you suggest
oh my god
oh my god
three times
im sorry thats never
happened to me before
i must be tired
okay im ready again
im looking for ray finkle
and a clean pair of shorts
what do you know about ray finkle
soccerstyle kicker
graduated from collier high 1976
stetson university honors graduate
1980 holds two ncaa records
most points and distance
nickname the mule
the only pro athlete from here
and one hell of a model american

oh yes i expect him home any minute
would you like some cookies
i just baked them
yummy
ray finkles house
i cant wait to meet him
ray aint coming home
but your wife expects him any minute
she expects him home any minute
see the engines running
but theres nobody behind the wheel
eight years ago
our son escaped from
shady acres mental hospital
and theyre still bugging us
to pick up his stuff
it was all that dan marinos fault
everyone knows that
if hed held the ball laces out
like hes supposed to
ray wouldnt have missed the kick
dan marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell
would you like a cookie son
what do you know
theyre little footballs
laces out
when ray gets back and starts
kicking again
hell never even know he was gone
ive kept his room
just the way he left it
oh boy
what a sports nut huh
may i
oh yes by all means
five seconds to go here
in super bowl 17
dolphins trailing the 49ers
by one this will
win the game for miami
theres the snap
marino holds
the kick
and its high no its
no good
ray finkle blew a 26yard field goal
i dont believe it
the dolphins lose
the dolphins lose
the dolphins lose the super bowl
melissa its ace
where are you
im in psychoville and finkles
the mayor wheres marino
why
hes about to join snowflake
ive gotta know where he is
he has a commercial shoot
at the bogart sound stage
call the police get extra
security over there now
ace whats going on
thought i left
im really gonna go this time
here we go folks very quiet
action
im dan marino and if anyone knows
the value of protection its me
so i take care of the hands
that take care of me
with isotoner gloves
cut again from the top
i said cut
guys its a cut
what the hell are they doing
thats a cut
what is this a rewrite
shut up
whered they go
over there
lets go
excuse me gentlemen
pet detective
come on
whats wrong
cant you hit me
have there been ransom demands
theres no communication
with the kidnappers
will the super bowl be postponed
the game is on as scheduled
why werent we told
about the kidnapping
secrecy was essential
we couldnt risk any interference
are the crimes related
im sorry i cant comment further
now if youll excuse me
get me the autopsy on podacter
aguado send out a memo
no one talks to the press
and somebody get me some coffee
tonight on miami vice
crockett gets the boss a coffee
when i get out of that bathroom
youd better be gone
is it number one or number two
i just wanna know how much time i have
by the way
i went ahead and solved that
pesky snowflakepodacter
marino thing
you ever heard of a former
dolphin kicker named ray finkle
all right ventura
make it quick
i found a rare stone
at the bottom of snowflakes tank
it belongs to a dolphin 84 afc
championship ring
it wouldve been a super bowl ring
but ray missed the kick
blames the whole thing on marino
were talking paranoid delusional
psychosis i saw the guys room
cozy if youre hannibal lecter
so how does roger podacter fit in
my guess is finkle was snooping around
podacter recognized him end of story
as for snowflake they gave him finkles
number taught him how to kick a goal
finkle took it personally
so where is finkle now
busted out of a mental institute hes
been plotting his revenge for years
waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them
the time when itd hurt them most
super bowl time
man im tired of being right
congratulations
youve done some fine detective work
ace
im sorry could you
speak into my good ear
i thought i heard you call me ace
maybe i was wrong about you
maybe you are more than just a pet dick
your gun is digging into my hip
whats wrong

melissa robinson

im a master of disguise
mrs robinson
im dr handly
now who is it you want us to look at
my brother
larry

your master is a loser
what the

thats it
einhorn is finkle
finkle is einhorn
einhorn is a man
oh my god
einhorn is a man
your gun is digging into my hip
god
and the big story in this
super bowl game is the abduction
of miamis starting quarterback
dan marino
its gotta be a strain
on this miami team bob
whats the matter dan
arent you having fun
i just love super bowl sunday
dont you dan
a magical afternoon
where dreams are made
and crushed
look if you want tickets
youre going about it the wrong way
do i look familiar to you
does it seem as if weve
met someplace before
i dont know
i get hit in the head a lot
now the coin toss
kickoff time
my favorite thing
laces out
i made some refreshments dan
would you like some refreshments dan
ill be right back dan
i dont know how much psychowomans
paying you but ill double it
sorry
psychowoman keeps us out of prison
snowflake here you go come on
check it out marino
im throwing passes to a dolphin
damn
go get some more fish
im gonna kill that dolphin
lovely party
pity i wasnt invited
where the hells the smelt
unconscious exactly as i planned
what the hell was that
shit
what happened whats going on
you okay
guess what
its naptime
what a hit
heads up
who are you
ace ventura pet detective
ive been sent with a special play
the quarterback sneak
penalty
too many men on the field
i warned you ventura
whatever happened to ace
good question
be careful with that phone
in time you could develop a tumor
aguado its lieutenant einhorn
send some men over
to the hallandale yacht basin
ive got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse
its ace ventura pet detective
code 1 1 in progress
343 victorville road
at the palmdale basin
officer needs backup
suspects name ace ventura
should be considered
armed and dangerous
its ace we gotta break out of here
is he in trouble
dont worry if theres
one thing i know
theres nothing ace cant handle
dont kill me
please
ill never tell anyone i swear
hes who you want kill him
kill him
kill him he held the ball remember
come on look at him
crybaby
jock
wimp
musclehead
shut up
i think ill kill the dolphin first
i wouldnt want you to miss that
and theres the snap
the kick
and its good
good to see somebody who
doesnt buckle under the pressure
what would you know about pressure
well i have kissed a man
of course theres never been
a more crucial kick in a super bowl
than the kick
heard around the world
i mean its clear to me that it was
a good hold finkle just booted it
the laces were in
they were in
you like that
you like that
and that and that
having a little trouble with the lady
you dont understand
shes a
get him lois get him
get him
shoot him
shoot him
hold your fire
dont shoot
put your guns down or this cop gets it
i mean it
shes not joking
he kidnapped snowflake
he killed roger podacter and was about
to kill marino and me
fiction can be fun
but i find the reference section
much more enlightening
for instance
if you look up
professional footballs
alltime bonehead plays
you might read about a miami dolphin
kicker named ray finkle
who missed a 26yard field goal
in the closing seconds of super bowl 17
you wouldnt read that finkle
was committed to a mental hospital
only to escape and join the police
in a scheme
to get even with marino
whom he blamed for the entire thing
what are you talking about
shes not lois einhorn
shes ray finkle shes a man
hes lying
shoot him
lets just see whos lying shall we
would a real woman have to wear
one of these
boy thats really on there
but tell me this
would a real woman
be missing these
that kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend
but i doubt very much
if he could find the time
during his busy schedule
to get rid of
big old
mr knish
oh boy
come here
would you excuse me for just one second
ladies and gentlemen
my esteemed colleague mr marino
brought new evidence to my attention
now
history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive
criminal investigator can be wrong
but if i am mistaken
if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman
as she claims to be
then my friend
she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids i have ever seen
thats why roger podacter is dead
he found captain winkie
good night
youve been a wonderful audience
be sure to tip your waitress
die animal boy
quick decision
loser
you have any more gum
thats none of your damn business
stay out of my personal affairs
youre a weird guy ace a weird guy
ladies and gentlemen
the miami dolphins are proud
to welcome back
to joe robbie stadium
our beloved mascot
and the star of our halftime show
snowflake
and now
returning for the second half
the dolphins most valuable player
dan marino
idiot
do you know what youve done
you just cost me 25 grand polly
yeah blow me
really
the national football league
