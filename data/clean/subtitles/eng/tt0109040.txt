thank you  miss jacques cousteau

i don t give a good goddamn

if you want to 
all i give a damn about is
winning the super bowl 
my athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place

in this business a long time 
you know how superstitious
these players are 
i have a quarterback that s put his
socks on backwards since high school 
i ve got a linebacker that hasn t washed
his jockey strap in two years   
   because he thinks flies are lucky 
i want that fish on that field
super bowl sunday 
find the fish   
   or find new jobs 
why did it happen now 
two weeks before the super bowl 
i ll tell you  it s those
animal rights activists

that fish lives better than they do 
the police are checking into the animal

when i lost my cuddles

spare me the routine  i know
you re working the snowflake case 
may i suggest you yield
to the experts on this one 
we ll find the porpoise 
now i feel better 
of course  that might not do any good 
nobody s missing a porpoise 
it s a dolphin that s been taken 
the common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout   
   while the bottle nosed dolphin 
or tursiops truncatus   
   has an elongated beak  cone shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage 
but i m sure you already knew that 
that s what turns me on about you 
your attention to detail 
listen  pet dick   
   how would you like me
to make your life a living hell 
well  i m not really ready
for a relationship  lois

a dolphin recently 
come on  i thought you had
a challenge for me

feeder fish  20 000 gallon tank  
wait a minute  look here 
that s a lot of equipment
for a civilian 
ronald camp  the billionaire 
billionaire and rare fish collector 
really 
that is the face of the enemy 
always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species 
hold on 
camp is connected with the dolphins 
that sub genius gave them the land
the stadium s built on 
and look  he s throwing another  i m
the richest man in the universe  party 
looks like it s time for me
to get myself a date 
i m really going out on a limb here 
his social events are strictly a list 
the date started good  chuck  but before
we got to the party  she tensed up 
if you do anything to embarrass me

i m sorry  this is ace v  
tom ace 
pleasure to meet you 
congratulations on all your success 
you smell terrific 
one of the first lessons we learned   
   back at   
   stanford was the growth of food 
poisoning claims against wealthy people 
one could make quite
a lucrative law practice   
   with little else 
how is everybody feeling tonight 
very  very well  thank you 
look  honey   
   there s the hors d oeuvres

i m sorry again  mr  ace 
what re you doing 
i m sorry  ron 
what s he doing 
let s go 
stop it 
i don t even wanna know
why your pants are missing 
you could ve cost me my job 
so you found a pebble
in snowflake s tank  i ll call cnn 
i found it in the filter  thank you 
and it s not a pebble  it s a rare 
triangular cut orange amber 
what re you talking about 
tonight i saw the same stone
in camp s ring 
i thought you said camp didn t do it 
no  his ring wasn t missing a stone 
but whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his 
ring  what ring 
the 1984 dolphin afc championship ring 
i find the ring with a missing stone 
i find snowflake 
how you gonna do that 
simple 
loser 
why don t you learn how to drive  pal 
you wanna play 
damn it 
that stone could ve come from anywhere 
it could ve come from   
   a necklace or a pendant  an earring 
it came from an  84 afc
championship ring 
einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal rights group  you know fan 
free animals now  started by chelsea 
daughter of industrialist fisher gamble 
over half a million members worldwide 
no  who are they 
did you know   
   they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots 
what do you feed your dog 
dog food  why 
he is miserable 
what are you talking about 
he s very unhappy  i feel sorry for him 
bad diet  isolated environment 
it s amazing he s still alive 
you re just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn t work out 
you can t express anger 
yeah  and you re ugly 
i m not even gonna talk to you 
would you please leave 
why  so you can beat him 
fatty 
you re unbelievable 
hiring you was the biggest mistake
i ever made 
well  why don t you cry about it 
saddlebags 
you like her  huh 
yeah  she s all right 
look  melissa  i    
i m here at the north beach towers
condo complex in north miami   
   where roger podacter  head of
operations for the miami dolphins   
   has apparently committed suicide   
   allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th story balcony    
you okay 
i told you  i was in my apartment   
   across the hall 
i heard a scream   
   so i called the manager 
the place was empty  except for the dog 
i opened the balcony door
and looked out   
   splat  bang  pancake time 
okay  thank you very much 
hi there  fella 
have a bad night 
so   
   animals can sense evil 
who let dr  doolittle in 
lieutenant  he came with miss robinson 
this is police business  we ll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick 
face it  
forget it  she s right 
besides   
   i wouldn t want someone tracing
my steps  pointing out my mistakes 
so   
   you don t think this is an obvious
suicide  mr  pet detective 
i wouldn t say that  there s plenty
of evidence here to support your theory 
except  of course  for that
spot of blood on the railing 
may i tell you what i think happened 
alrighty  then 
roger podacter went out after work 
had a few drinks  then came home 
he wasn t alone  someone else
was with him  there was a struggle   
   and he was thrown over that balcony 
roger podacter didn t commit suicide 
he was murdered 
that s a very entertaining story   
   but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called   
   evidence 
i think i heard a toilet flush 
maybe somebody lost a turtle 
well  i    
i guess i m out of my league here 
good work 
there is just
one more thing  lieutenant 
this woman is roger podacter s neighbor 
she said she heard a scream  right 
and you had to open
the balcony door when you came in 
 that s true 
 you re sure you had to open this door 
i m certain 
what s the point  ventura 
only this 
this is double paned  soundproof glass 
there is no way   
   she could have heard
podacter scream on the way down 
the scream she heard
came from inside   
   before he was thrown off the balcony 
the murderer closed the door upon going 
can you feel that  buddy 
i have exorcized the demons 
this house is clear 
 losers 
 get him out of here 
 losers  losers 
 let s go  ace 
losers 
come on 
back to the zoo 
what are you thinking 
this whole thing is connected  somehow 
i want to find that other ring 
ace  you checked all the rings 
receipts  what about receipts 
there s gotta be receipts 
that was pretty impressive 
what you did at the apartment 
you don t have to tell me 
i was there 
maybe you should ve joined the police
force  become a real detective 
i don t do humans 
you really love animals 
if it gets cold enough 
no  i have a kinship with them 
i understand them 
wanna hear something spooky 
sure 
one time when i was about 12  i had
a dream that i was being followed by   
   a big dog with rabies 
he had these bloodshot eyes   
   and foam came out of his mouth 
no matter how fast i ran  he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me 
then just before i got
to my front door   
   he jumped and sank his teeth in 
that s when i woke up   
   and felt the back of my neck 
check that out 
bastard 
i m sorry  i just couldn t help myself 
want to know why i do this 
i m not sure anymore 
you better be sure   
   because once you get
inside my head   
   there s no turning back 
so    
are these all  there s only a dozen 
maybe it s in another file 
in the back 
who the hell is that 
what 
that 
who the hell is that 
that s ray finkle  the kicker 
don t you know who he is 
why isn t he in this picture 
this was taken earlier in the year 
ray finkle wasn t added till mid season 
he missed the final field goal
in the super bowl that year 
cost the dolphins the game 
but he got himself a ring  didn t he 
definitely 
 replacement kicker
having a great year  
 ready for super bowl 
all star kicker boasts  
 field goal sails wide 
dolphins lose super bowl  
 the kick heard round the world  
that was finkle 
the dolphins lost by one point 
poor guy 
poor guy with a motive  baby 
where is he now 
i heard he went back
to his hometown in collier county 
really 
you re gonna drop me off before you go 
no way  you shouldn t be
left alone right now 
it might not be safe at your apartment 
what do you suggest 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
three times 
i m sorry  that s never
happened to me before 
i must be tired 
okay  i m ready again 
i m looking for ray finkle   
   and a clean pair of shorts 
what do you know about ray finkle 
soccer style kicker 
graduated from collier high  1976 
stetson university honors graduate 
1980  holds two ncaa records 
most points and distance 
nickname   the mule  
the only pro athlete from here 
and one hell of a model american 
are you another one of them
hard copy guys 
no  sir 
i m just a big finkle fan 
this is my graceland  sir 
will you put that gun down 
the boy is a fan of our son 
so nice to meet you 
i m ray s mother   
   and this is ray s father 
it s a real honor 
it s an honor to have you here 
my ray is so appreciative of his fans 
he ll be so pleased you stopped by 
are you expecting ray anytime soon 
oh  yes  i expect him home any minute 
would you like some cookies 
i just baked them 
yummy 
ray finkle s house 
i can t wait to meet him 
ray ain t coming home 
but your wife expects him any minute 
she expects him home any minute 
see  the engine s running
but there s nobody behind the wheel 
eight years ago   
   our son escaped from
shady acres mental hospital 
and they re still bugging us
to pick up his stuff 
it was all that dan marino s fault 
everyone knows that 
if he d held the ball laces out 
like he s supposed to   
   ray wouldn t have missed the kick 
dan marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell 
would you like a cookie  son 
what do you know 
they re little footballs 
laces out 
when ray gets back and starts
kicking again   
   he ll never even know he was gone 
i ve kept his room
just the way he left it 
oh  boy 
what a sports nut  huh 
may i 
oh  yes  by all means 
five seconds to go here
in super bowl 17 
dolphins trailing the 49ers   
   by one  this will
win the game for miami 
there s the snap 
marino holds 
the kick   
   and it s high  no  it s   
   no good 
ray finkle blew a 26 yard field goal 
i don t believe it 
the dolphins lose 
the dolphins lose 
the dolphins lose the super bowl 
 melissa  it s ace 
 where are you 
i m in psychoville  and finkle s
the mayor  where s marino 
why 
he s about to join snowflake 
i ve gotta know where he is 
he has a commercial shoot
at the bogart sound stage 
call the police  get extra
security over there  now 
ace  what s going on 
thought i left 
i m really gonna go this time 
here we go  folks  very quiet 
action 
i m dan marino  and if anyone knows
the value of protection  it s me 
so i take care of the hands
that take care of me   
   with isotoner gloves 
cut  again from the top 
i said  cut 
guys  it s a cut 
what the hell are they doing 
that s a cut 
 what is this  a rewrite 
 shut up 
 where d they go 
 over there 
let s go 
excuse me  gentlemen 
pet detective 
come on 
what s wrong 
can t you hit me 
have there been ransom demands 
there s no communication
with the kidnappers 
will the super bowl be postponed 
the game is on as scheduled 
why weren t we told
about the kidnapping 
secrecy was essential 
we couldn t risk any interference 
 are the crimes related 
 i m sorry  i can t comment further 
now  if you ll excuse me    
get me the autopsy on podacter 
aguado  send out a memo 
no one talks to the press 
and somebody get me some coffee 
tonight on miami vice 
crockett gets the boss a coffee 
when i get out of that bathroom 
you d better be gone 
is it number one or number two 
i just wanna know how much time i have 
by the way 
i went ahead and solved that   
   pesky snowflake podacter 
marino thing 
you ever heard of a former
dolphin kicker named ray finkle 
all right  ventura   
   make it quick 
i found a rare stone
at the bottom of snowflake s tank 
it belongs to a dolphin  84 afc
championship ring 
it would ve been a super bowl ring 
but ray missed the kick 
blames the whole thing on marino 
we re talking paranoid  delusional
psychosis  i saw the guy s room 
cozy  if you re hannibal lecter 
so how does roger podacter fit in 
my guess is  finkle was snooping around 
podacter recognized him  end of story 
as for snowflake  they gave him finkle s
number  taught him how to kick a goal 
finkle took it personally 
so where is finkle now 
busted out of a mental institute  he s
been plotting his revenge for years 
waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them 
the time when it d hurt them most 
super bowl time 
man  i m tired of being right 
congratulations 
you ve done some fine detective work   
   ace 
i m sorry  could you
speak into my good ear 
i thought i heard you call me ace 
maybe i was wrong about you 
maybe you are more than just a pet dick 
your gun is digging into my hip

ace ventura  pet detective 
i ve been sent with a special play 
the quarterback sneak 
penalty 
too many men on the field 
i warned you  ventura 
whatever happened to  ace  
good question 
be careful with that phone 
in time  you could develop a tumor 
aguado  it s lieutenant einhorn

to the hallandale yacht basin 
i ve got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse 
it s ace ventura  pet detective 
code 1 1 in progress 
343 victorville road   
   at the palmdale basin 
officer needs backup 
suspect s name  ace ventura   
   should be considered
armed and dangerous 
it s ace  we gotta break out of here 
is he in trouble 
don t worry  if there s
one thing i know   
   there s nothing ace can t handle 
don t kill me 
please 
i ll never tell anyone  i swear 
 he s who you want  kill him

 crybaby 
 jock 
 wimp 
 musclehead 
shut up 
i think i ll kill the dolphin first 
i wouldn t want you to miss that 
and there s the snap 
the kick 
and it s good 
good to see somebody who
doesn t buckle under the pressure 
what would you know about pressure 
well  i have kissed a man 
of course  there s never been
a more crucial kick in a super bowl   
    than the  kick
heard around the world  
i mean  it s clear to me that it was
a good hold  finkle just booted it 
the laces were in 
they were in 
you like that 
you like that 
and that  and that 
having a little trouble with the lady 
you don t understand   
   she s a  
get him  lois  get him 
get him 
shoot him 
 shoot him 
 hold your fire 
don t shoot 
put your guns down  or this cop gets it 
i mean it 
she s not joking 
he kidnapped snowflake 
he killed roger podacter and was about
to kill marino and me 
fiction can be fun 
but i find the reference section
much more enlightening 
for instance   
   if you look up   
   professional football s
all time bonehead plays   
   you might read about a miami dolphin
kicker named ray finkle   
   who missed a 26 yard field goal
in the closing seconds of super bowl 17 
you wouldn t read that finkle
was committed to a mental hospital   
   only to escape and join the police   
   in a scheme
to get even with marino   
   whom he blamed for the entire thing 
what are you talking about 
she s not lois einhorn 
she s ray finkle  she s a man 
he s lying 
shoot him 
let s just see who s lying  shall we 
would a real woman have to wear
one of these 
boy  that s really on there 
but tell me this 
would a real woman   
   be missing these 
that kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend 
but i doubt very much   
   if he could find the time
during his busy schedule   
   to get rid of   
   big old   
   mr  knish 
oh  boy 
come here 
would you excuse me for just one second 
ladies and gentlemen   
   my esteemed colleague  mr  marino   
   brought new evidence to my attention 
now   
   history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive   
   criminal investigator can be wrong 
but if i am mistaken   
   if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman   
   as she claims to be   
   then  my friend   
   she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids i have ever seen 
that s why roger podacter is dead 
he found captain winkie 
good night 
you ve been a wonderful audience 
be sure to tip your waitress 
die  animal boy 
quick decision 
loser 
you have any more gum 
that s none of your damn business 
stay out of my personal affairs 
you re a weird guy  ace  a weird guy 
ladies and gentlemen   
   the miami dolphins are proud   
   to welcome back
to joe robbie stadium   
   our beloved mascot   
   and the star of our halftime show 
snowflake 
and now   
   returning for the second half 
the dolphins most valuable player   
   dan marino 
idiot 
do you know what you ve done 
you just cost me 25 grand  polly 
yeah  blow me 
really 
the national football league   
   would like to offer a special thank 
you to the man who rescued dan marino   
   and our beloved snowflake 
a great humanitarian   
   and a lover of all animals 
mr  ace ventura 
get off me
