we owens women
have been blamed
for everything that has
ever gone wrong in this town
sally ls that why people hate us
so much aunt frances
jet they dont hate us sweetheart
we just we make them a little nervous
frances lets face it jet we owens
women have always created a stir
it all began with your ancestor maria
she was a witch the first in our family
witch
and you my darlings
are the most recent
in a long and distinguished line
sally ls that why they wanted to
hang her because she was a witch
frances well the fact that our aunt maria
was a bit of a heartbreaker didnt help
nor did it help that most of her lovers
had wives on the hanging committee
but no l dont think it was
either of those reasons
they feared her
because she had a gift
a power that has been passed on
to you children
she had the gift
of magic
blrds squawklng
woman gasps
chatterlng
and it was this very gift
that saved her life
gasps
clamorlng
squawklng
she was banished to this very island
with her unborn child
growing inside her belly
she waited for her lover
to rescue her
but he never came
no one came
ln a moment of despair
she cast a spell upon herself
that she would never again
feel the agony of love
sobblng
but as her bitterness grew
the spell turned into a curse
a curse on any man
who dared love an owens woman
here they come aah
sally
so is that why daddy died
from the curse
frances yes my darling
jack
aw l got you l got you l got you
frances
your mother knew
beetle chlrplng
she heard the beetle ticking
for your fathers death all day long
she knew that when you hear
the sound of the deathwatch beetle
the man you love is doomed to die
jet but thats how you came
to live with us
we tucked you into our lives then
weve raised you
the best way we know how
ln this house we have
chocolate cake for breakfast
and we never bother with silly things
like bedtimes or brushing our teeth
jet
but with the sweets
comes the sour
frances so when you find yourself
the center of attention
hi you wanna play
