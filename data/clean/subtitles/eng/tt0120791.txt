   we owens women
have been blamed   
   for everything that has
ever gone wrong in this town 
sally  ls that why people hate us
so much  aunt frances 
jet  they don t hate us  sweetheart 
we just   we make them a little nervous 
frances  let s face it  jet  we owens
women have always created a stir 
it all began with your ancestor  maria 
 she was a witch  the first in our family 
 witch 
and you  my darlings 
are the most recent   
   in a long and distinguished line 
sally  ls that why they wanted to
hang her  because she was a witch 
frances  well  the fact that our aunt maria
was a bit of a heartbreaker didn t help 
nor did it help that most of her lovers   
   had wives on the hanging committee 
but no  l don t think it was
either of those reasons 
they feared her
because she had a gift 
a power that has been passed on
to you children 
she had the gift   
   of magic 
 blrds squawklng 
 woman gasps 
 chatterlng 
and it was this very gift   
   that saved her life 
 gasps 
 clamorlng 
 squawklng 
she was banished to this very island 
with her unborn child
growing inside her belly   
   she waited for her lover
to rescue her 
but he never came 
no one came 
ln a moment of despair   
   she cast a spell upon herself 
that she would never again
feel the agony of love 
 sobblng 
but as her bitterness grew   
   the spell turned into a curse 
a curse on any man
who dared love an owens woman 
here they come  aah 
sally 
so is that why daddy died 
 from the curse 
frances  yes  my darling 
jack 
aw  l got you  l got you  l got you 
frances 
your mother knew 
 beetle chlrplng 
she heard the beetle ticking
for your father s death all day long 
she knew that when you hear
the sound of the deathwatch beetle   
   the man you love is doomed to die 
jet  but that s how you came
to live with us 
we tucked you into our lives then 
we ve raised you
the best way we know how 
ln this house  we have
chocolate cake for breakfast 
and we never bother with silly things
like bedtimes or brushing our teeth 
jet 
but with the sweets   
   comes the sour 
frances  so when you find yourself
the center of attention    
hi  you wanna play 
frances  lt s not that they hate you

with an owens woman   
    is bound to end up 6 feet under 
jet  spare me
