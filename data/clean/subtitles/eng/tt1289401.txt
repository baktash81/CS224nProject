at the time of its construction 
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence 
featuring every luxury  including a face bidet
and an anti irish security fence 
over here 
you can imagine sir aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests 
it s said that  in this very room  p t  barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants 
and if you ll follow me   
now  i m gonna tell you
something a little spooky 
on the morning of october 25th  1894 
sir aldridge awoke  furious 
when his breakfast was not waiting for him 
so he called to his servants 
but none of them responded 
why 
because  during the night  one by one 
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep 
it was later discovered
they were murdered by his eldest daughter 
gertrude aldridge 
sir aldridge once wrote in his diary 
 i know god makes no mistakes 
 but i believe he may have been drunk
when he built gertrude s personality  
now  to spare the family public humiliation 
instead of turning her in to the police 
they locked her in this basement 
and they fed her
through this slot 
years later  when a new owner moved in 
they dug out her remains 
but  after repeatedly hearing strange sounds 
he sealed it shut 
that s right 
no one has opened this door since then 
okay 
follow me 
maybe steer clear of the door 
sorry  sir aldridge  i got to get out of here 
garret  you idiot 
no 
no 
no  no  no 
no  no 
no 
daniel  teresa 
sean  that is an excellent question 
as you can see from my calculations 
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory 
teaching in the big hall  big day 
big hall  big hall  big hall 
big hall 
sorry to interrupt  but i need to speak to you
about something you wrote 
i m sorry  yes  what   
what publication 
i m talking about your book 
book 
i m sorry  i don t know what you mean 
now  if you ll excuse me 
my class will be here any minute 
you re erin gilbert  right 
co author of ghosts from our past 
both literally and figuratively 
the study of the paranormal 
no self respecting scientist
believes in the paranormal 
i can assure you that 
i m sorry 
you re looking for a different erin gilbert 
okay  but this really does look like you 
what  no 
yeah  that s me 
look  it was a very long time ago 
and it was just a gag
between a couple of friends 
i m sorry 
a 460 page gag 
the first sentence is   this is not a joke  
what do you want 
well  i m ed mulgrave 
i m the historian at the aldridge mansion 
and i believe it s haunted 
if you could just come take a look 
i tried the police  but i just sound crazy 
i m sorry 
that book you re holding is utter nonsense 
i don t even know how you got that 
i thought i burned both copies 
it s on amazon  both hard copy and e book 
 what 
 it s on books on tape  too 
only  i know how to read 
is it now 
no 
no  no  no  no  no  i m gonna kill you  abby 
erin 
hi  dr  filmore  hello  hi 
we re set for the final review
of your tenure case on thursday 
great 
but i saw that you had
a recommendation letter
from dr  branum at princeton 
their science department
is really not what it used to be 
and i would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college 
more prestigious than princeton 
yes 
you see  i think you re an asset
to modern physics 
but i would hate to see you
throw it down the drain 
i won t throw it down the drain  sir 
and i will get on that letter 
and about your clothes   
yes  did you   
too sexy for academia 
never mind 
no  no  no  what is it 
 never mind 
 i don t   
abby  you promised you wouldn t do this 
 abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal
 at the kenneth p  higgins
institute of science  
come on  f7 
are you kidding me 
hello 
i ve been waiting a long time 
has been a while  hasn t it 
hope you brought me more than one wonton 
excuse me 
well  well  well 
erin 
abby 
bennie 
yes  i know who you are  bennie  can i just   
can i have my lunch
that i ve been waiting an hour for 
you know they make
smaller headphones now  right 
it s an advance in science 
thank you for asking 
probably the future you re looking at 
here you go 
why don t you show miss gilbert to the door 
it s just the same door we came in from 
 yeah  i know how to get out  it s figurative 
 it s really not that hard 
 no  i m okay 
 don t 
 i tried 
 poorly 
you put our book online
without my permission 
i don t need your permission 
of course you need my permission 
i wrote that book with you 
my name is on it 
no  absolutely not 
that book is a whole new
revenue stream for me 
and i m  like  one tenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here 
look  i am up for tenure right now 
 i m up for tenure  
and if my colleagues at columbia university
google my name 
that is the first thing that comes up 
along with a ghost emoji now 
thank you very much 
 that does a little dance 
 you know what 
that book was our baby 
and you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly 
okay  well  books can t fly 
and neither can babies  so   
you don t know  i ll tell you what 
if i had a human baby that could fly 
i wouldn t be telling the press about it 
if i had a flying baby 
i d zip this  and so would you 
there is no experimental backing
for anything in that book 
and it makes me look like a crazy person 
 god  are you kidding me 
 what 
i got one wonton 
i got a tub of soup 
and i got one split wonton 
look at that  just floating there 
i m sorry you re having
a soup crisis right now 
there s not even any meat in there 
that s just a carrot 
abby  please 
 yes 
 abby 
you re killing me  i got one wonton again 
you got to send bennie back 
and tell him no tip  i should charge him 
and it was split up the middle 
come here often 
i m sorry  hello 
who are you 
 holtzmann 
 erin 
i ve heard terrible things about you 
don t get too close to her  holtzmann 
she ll ask you to write a book 
and then she ll squash your dreams 
okay 
holtzmann works with me here in the lab 
she s a brilliant engineer and very loyal 
she would not abandon you 
i get it 
she also happens to specialize in
experimental particle physics 
holtzmann and i are really busy here
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book 
 really 
 yeah 
we re incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam 
really close 
you re making a reverse tractor beam 
abby  why don t you let her listen to the evp 
 what evp 
 no  not    there s no evp 
 evp is electro   
 electro voice phenomenon 
i m familiar  i know what it means 
and there s never been one substantiated 
there hasn t  there hasn t been one   
you know what  you come with me 
with a suit on and you get so cocky 
a few months ago  we spent eight nights
at the chelsea hotel 
we didn t get anything 
well  we didn t think so 
and then later  in the lab  when we were
reviewing these tapes   
 you really got me 
 you know what 
usually we can t even get people over here 
 but we have never   
 she came right over to it 
never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine 
it s a cool joke  that was funny 
it s disgusting 
is it more or less disgusting
if i tell you it came from the front 
what s next  you gonna give me a wedgie 
no  i think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt 
burn 
okay  you know what  i thought
we could have an adult conversation 
but apparently we can t 
erin  if you don t believe
in this stuff anymore 
then why were you looking for the book 
a man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted 
what building 
the aldridge mansion 
it s obviously a joke 
what are you doing 
see  this is  this is exactly   
 you want to go find some ghosts 
 yes 
break 
 wait  you re going 
 i got the pack 
abby  please  abby  the book

i m not going with you guys 
no  are you kidding 
you were never invited 
i need you out of the lab 
so i can lock the door 
well  you said  let s   so

 we re wasting time 
just close the door behind you  it ll lock 
abby  wait 
hey  taxi 
 hey  hey 
 abby 
abby  come on 
please  abby  just
take the book down  please 
all right  all right 
but you have to introduce us
to this guy at the aldridge mansion 
yes  he would love to meet you 
then i will consider  maybe 
taking the book down
until you get your stupid tenure
at your stupider college 
absolutely  yes  i will  yes  of course 
you got it 
excuse me  excuse me 
we re not open 
 can i help you 
 yes  hi 
we re looking for ed mulgrave 
 i wanted to introduce these people to him 
 hi there 
he came to see me this morning 
 ed mulgrave 
 yes 
but ed mulgrave died 15 years ago 
 yes  that s awesome 
 what 
dead for 15 years 
ed s a ghost  knew it 
i just saw him today   
he s   
so  who is this 
that s ed s son  ed junior 
okay  that s obviously who i meant  that s   
hi  junior  if i may  when is the last time
the paranormal entity was actually seen 
and if you were to rank it  let s say between
probably a t1 and t5   
garret here saw it on tuesday 
and i believe it made him soil himself 
 jesus 
 wow  soiling 
i d put that at a t3 
t4  if it was poop 
 what 
 unless you ate something weird 
then it wasn t the ghost 
kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though 
i didn t soil myself 
he did  he called me sobbing  saying 
 oh  my god  my pants are toast  
 okay  all right 
 i d love to get that back to the lab 
well  so i have made the introduction 
 yeah  thank you 
 there you go 
all right  well  how  bout
you take us across the street 
i got to get in there  set up 
let s go on a tour

aldridge mansion  take one 
and we are rolling 
checking the settings  we look good 
what is that 
looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy 
it s a pke meter 
there s a ghost anywhere around here 
this baby s gonna find it 
does it work 
yeah  it works 
i just haven t had the appropriate proximity
to an entity for it to work 
strange reading here 
ma am  can you tell us where you got
the world s tiniest bow tie 
it came with the shirt 
okay  somebody really doesn t
want us getting in that door 
can you tell us what it s like
to walk around in those shoes all day

holtzmann  check this out 
hold your ponies

gooey stuff on the floor 
you opened the basement door 
you tried to freak me out 
we did not open the basement door   
basement door is open 
 i didn t open it  did you open it 
 i did not open it 
you know what  it was probably ed 
and the guy who didn t poop his pants 
look over there 
i didn t even know it did that

holy crap 
let me have the camera  thank you 
okay 
how can you be eating right now 
you try saying no to these salty parabolas 
are you seeing what i m seeing 
good god 
class 4 apparition 
distinct human form 
this can t be happening 
it s happening  all right 
that s the most beautiful thing
i have ever seen 
i m gonna try to talk to it 
just be careful  she could be malevolent 
yeah  just make sure you re recording it 
 yeah  i m getting it all 
 okay 
just be cautious 
i think she wants to communicate with us 
i knew it  i knew it  i knew it 
it s okay  she seems peaceful 
hello 
i think you re gorgeous 
hello  hi 
my name is erin gilbert 
doctor of particle physics at columbia   
 yes 
 god 
she s getting away  come on 
 hurry  hurry 
 run 
 get it  get it 
 where d it go  where d it go 
 where d it go  where d it go 
 there 
what just happened 
abby  what just happened 
i ll tell you what just happened 
we saw a ghost 
 we saw a ghost 
 yeah  we saw a ghost 
we saw a ghost  oh  my god 
 we saw a ghost 
 we saw a ghost 
oh  my god  we saw a ghost 
we were right  we weren t crazy 
we saw a ghost 
ghosts are real  ghosts are real 
i believe in ghosts  cause i just saw one 
they re real 
who is that 
dr  bronstein saw this on reddit 
it was re blogged
from a site entitled ghost news 
not a publication i d heard of 
i hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure   
i accept your tenure 
when we give someone tenure 
they represent this institution 
but this is just not
what this institution is about 
dr  gibbons  hello 
just moving offices 
you know 
they found a couple cats in the wall 
really stunk in there  glad i m getting out 
i didn t get fired 
i got fired 
after years 
years of hard work 
and ass kissing 
god  i kissed so many
different kinds of asses 
erin  we re sorry that you lost your job 
but  i mean  there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it 
i mean  we saw a real ghost 
you know  and she was beautiful 
till she dislocated her jaw
and ecto projected all over you 
yeah  that stuff went everywhere 
by the way  in every crack 
but  i got to say 
even that was kind of spectacularly beautiful 
i did detect a heavy ionization discharge 
i mean  i could smell it 
a full torso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression 
i mean  how often does that happen 
i mean  they want us to be quiet about that 
we are not gonna be quiet about that 
and it s not just us 
we have over 100 comments already 
and they re not all crazies 
come here  i want to show you this 
read that 
 ain t no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts  
no  no  okay 
the one below it 
this woman is describing
a class 3 haunting in her house 
she can t just move  she can t call the police 
she can t call her friends 
who s she gonna call 
ghost jumpers 
tonight  the ghost jumpers
make contact with the ghost of bigfoot 
god  these phonies 
i mean  you know what 
these guys are the reason you got fired 
it s because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work 
this cannot be the best option for people 
okay  we are on the cusp of something here 
a real discovery 
unlike columbia 
this institute is 100  behind us 
really 
erin  this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids 
i know that if you come and join us here 
they are gonna be so pumped 
we just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money 
i just honestly didn t realize
your department still existed 
 what 
 come on  ghosts 
i will not let the 12 year reputation
of this fine institution be besmirched by you 
come on  suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold 
you re only dean now
because the last dean went to jail 
are you saying that i m not qualified 
you spell science with a  y  
and what s upsetting about that is
i don t think you know that that s wrong 
this is an institution of higher learning 
and if you guys want to study  ghosts  
do it somewhere else 
because i have two words for you 
let me guess   get out  
 no  he s gonna say  suck it  
 he s not gonna say  suck it  
suck it 
 you were right 
 you know   
my gosh 
i think it might be a ghost 
no  it s not  it s just a bird 
bye  there s the door 
later days  can you hear this 
let me turn it up 
oh  my god 
this is incredibly immature behavior 
caught it 
just a minor setback 
you know what  guys 
i think we can really do this 
we can become the first scientists to prove
the existence of the paranormal 
all we have to do is
find an entity and capture it
and bring it into a controlled environment 
that s all 
hey  there s the erin i remember 
welcome back 
 thank you 
 nice 
okay  we should probably
get this equipment out of here 
 they re gonna want it back 
 i thought this stuff was yours 
 all stolen 
 no   
hey  that worthless garbage
belongs to this school 
scatter  scatter  scatter 
go  go  go  scatter 
hey  good morning 
okay 
hey  how you doing  sir  got a metro   
hey  that s a dope jacket  man 
i got that jacket 
you know what  it s a sweater 
i made a mistake 
you have a good day  all right 
hey  how you doing  man 
they ll always ignore you 
they are walking sewage 
concerned only with their own trivial matters 
okay 
when the fourth cataclysm begins 
laborers  such as yourself 
will be among the last led to the butchery 
so  make the most of your extra time 
you are just a bundle of joy  ain t ya 
you have a good day with your crazy ass 
i wonder what train he taking 
is he going on the tracks

you have been bullied your entire life 
now you will be the bully 
trust in your abilities 
and the universe shall bend before your will 
hey  weirdo

nothing would make me happier 
whatever  freak show  just do it 
and the universe shall bend before your will 
charge the lines

break the barrier 
i found a fantastic spot for your business 
it s more of a research lab 
 what do you think 
 that s it 
let s go see your new home 
 oh  my god  look at   
 look at it 
 look at how high 
 look at the amazing spread

all over town 
so i m drumming us up a little business 
 if you see something  say something  
 it s catchy 
 it s good 
 yeah  i ll take it 
 i think it might be the anti terrorism slogan 
god 
 it is  isn t it 
 it is  i m sorry 
well  i guess now we know
why so many people are calling
about suspicious looking bags 
dang it 
 i love the green paper 
 thank you 
hey  i m here about the receptionist job 
 hi  hi 
 hi 
is this a big ol  robot 
what 
the receptionist job that was in the paper 
that s what i was here about 
you re hired 
okay  i    god  you re all sweaty 
i think i got it 
 if there s something strange in the    
kevin  right 
 kevin 
 yeah 
abby  we spoke on the phone 
 we did  yeah 
 hello there 
 okay 
 kevin 
that s a manly name 
my name s erin  with an  e  
for  everything you want  
okay  well  we should probably   
should probably get started 
erin  do you want to join us 
 yes 
 erin 
i ve got some questions 
okay  here we go 
let me just get to my notes 
okay 
all right  first off  i just want to say   
you know  we should probably start with
a very important question
that we re asking all of the applicants 
you know  are you seeing anyone right now 
 seeing anyone 
 yeah 
 just for business purposes 
 business purposes only 
well  i m seeing all three of you 
in front of me 
just forget she even asked 
because if she did  that would be illegal  so   
forgotten 
jillian holtzmann  radio times 
what have you been doing
with your whole life 
great question 
well  lots of different jobs 
i did the  actor thing  
 worked for   
 i m just gonna    just real quick 
can i ask why no glass 
yeah  they just kept getting dirty 
so i took them out 
 that s   
 don t have to clean them anymore 
 oh  boy 
 and i can just   
 i got to try to keep that in mind 
 yeah 
would it be okay
if i bring mike hat to work sometimes 
he has major anxiety problems 
you know what  i would love
to let your cat live here with you 
but i have a pretty severe cat allergy 
no  i don t have a cat 
he s a dog  his name is mike hat 
your dog s name is my cat 
no  mike hat 
your dog s name is mike  last name hat 
well  his full name is michael hat 
i can t say that i m allergic to dogs  so   
it s all right  he lives with my mum 
 well  then we have that figured out 
 okay  that was   
one down  no cat 
but you know what i say  let s jump ahead 
kevin dabbles in web design 
and i asked him to throw together
maybe a couple of logos for us 
 you want to see them 
 now is your moment 
pull it out 
sure 
you re like a lawsuit waiting to happen 
here we go 
okay  so   
what do you think of that 
yeah  you do see how this
might make us look bad  right 
is it the boobs you don t like 
 cause i can make them bigger 
no  i can see them 
yeah  i can definitely see them 
you know what  i think
it s not always about the end result 
it s about the journey 
well  what about this one 
i think that s already a thing 
what  7 1 1 
it s 7 eleven 
yep  it is  i have another option  though 
 okay  please 
 it s this one 
that s one of my favorites 
i think you might ve made a mistake 
i don t think that one s for us 
no  no  that s for you 
you know  i just thought the floating hot dog
implies that a ghost is holding it 
your work is more cerebral than i expected 
see some more 
 those are great 
 yeah 
we re actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second 
so if you could just stand over there 
 we just need to convene for a moment 
 okay 
 sure  all right 
 thank you 
just go right over there 
don t listen 
i won t 
he covered his eyes 
guys  look  as much as

off the hook right now  but they will be 
you know 
an aquarium is a submarine for fish

hire who is most qualified  okay  deal 
there are no other people 
he s the only applicant 
excellent

i mean  it s  like  coincidence 
also  i got chased by a ghost 
what 
you know  up above us

i m telling you 
and don t touch the third rail
unless y all little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts 
 come on 
 you know what 
i should ve gave you some coveralls  man 
it s so unsanitary down here 
you know  you don t usually think about
the amount of urine smell 
that s pretty much how it s gonna be 
it s not gonna freshen up at all 
oh  boy  okay 
definitely got something over here 
look at    is that   
what is that  a burn 
that s where i saw that weird sparking thing 
what was it 
baby  if i knew what it was 
i wouldn t say  a weird sparking thing  
it looks like fission scorch 
what  fission scorch down here 
except that you re right 
what is    wait  i m smelling
both electrical discharge
 and isotopic decay 
 isotopic decay 
how is that    holtzmann 
 yeah  what 
 come here  i need your snoot on this 
am i nuts 
 ey   ey  ladies 
while y all over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage 
we only got a couple of minutes 
do you see that 
 the eyes 
 all right  holtzmann 
 now is not the time to be messing with   
 no 
cream and sugar 
hey  patty  can i get some
illumination on this subject 
yeah  i can put some light on that 
oh  boy 
that is more and more unsettling 
that s the dude i saw 
i m telling you  that s him 
we got another class 4 
and this one s even more ionized
than the one at the aldridge mansion 
where are these ghosts coming from 
you know what 
i got to get this thing on film 
 holtzmann 
 yup 
 power us up 
 okay 
 cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab 
this is a little rough 
it s in its early stages  got to be honest 
just gonna plug these things in here 
 okay  erin  come here 
 let me document this 
 grab it  grab it 
 wait 
that s gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost  okay 
so whenever i say   go   you just do that 
why am i operating
the untested nuclear laser 
you have the longest arms 
you guys might want to hurry up 
oh  my god  i forgot the most important part 
yeah  sorry 
erin  this is just a little bit of grounding
so you don t die immediately 
do you know your iron level 
it s fine 
you have done this before  right 
okay  erin  on my cue 
aim the barrel at him 
ready  aim  fire 
okay  this is a little underwhelming 
can we get more power 
and once again  fire 
this isn t working 
can this beam get any stronger 
well  not at the moment 
that s the train  we got to move 
just try to lure him back to the platform 
grab her

 move  move  move 
come on  move 
 hurry 
 that s the express train 
and it s not stopping 
it s coming  get her up 
not the collar 
well  i guess he going to queens 
he s gonna be the third scariest thing
on that train 
god  did you see that 
you can t see anything 
my god  i mean 
that power surge really held him 
we need more juice 
we need to be more mobile 
i know what to do 
 yes 
 i almost got killed 
yeah  i know  it was so awesome 
it was awesome 
everyone thinks this video is fake 
look at these comments 
we have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it  you guys 
i mean  this stuff is real 
we have to be able to prove it 
we will  and you shouldn t
be reading this stuff 
you re not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write
in the middle of the night online 
look at   
 bogus equipment   you know what 
i d love you to meet me any place  any time

can we just pretend
that didn t happen  please 
all right  well  what do you think 
i    you know what  i just can t watch that 
i m not sure 
i mean  it s just a lot of bits and pieces 
i m pretty sure none of it is
supposed to be in the subway  though 
it s like it was part of a miniature cyclotron 
and they used a chromium alloy for the hull 
i would ve used aluminum  but i m crazy 
what s that weird thing that guy said
to the lady from the subway 
i know what you re talking about 
fourth cataclysm  yeah 
 hi 
 fourth cataclysm 
that sound like a franchise
nobody ever wanted 
yeah  you guys  you have a visitor 
she s here to see you in the booth 
booth number one  with the earrings 
 yeah 
 yeah  we see her now 
 thanks 
 no worries 
i m joining the club 
well  it s not really a    i m sorry 
kevin  hi  can you answer the phone  please 
 i can t  it s in the fish tank 
 no 
the one on the desk that s ringing  that one 
 that one 
 yep 
 oh  my god 
 what s this place called again 
conductors of
the metaphysical examination  talk 
got it  conductors of metamucils and stuff 
slow down  i    what   
they hung up 
no  i was just not into that conversation 
kevin  i m really gonna need you
to try a little harder  okay  buddy 
well  if they call back  i will 
i got to take off  though 
i m in a hide and seek tournament 
and we are in the semis 
kevin  i m gonna need you
to pick up all those suitcases 
did you hurt your face 
hey  did y all hire that big dumb dude 
bye 
man  i got a cousin mookie 
he is half as stupid 
and he will work for vienna sausages 
the thing is  this isn t really a club 
it s a scientific research group 
and i understand that 
but let me tell you something 
i read a lot of nonfiction 
and you guys know
a lot about this science stuff 
but i know new york 
and check this out 
i can borrow a car from my uncle 
and y all won t have to lug
all this heavy equipment around 
 guys  we got to get a car 
 come on  baby 
you need me  you need patty 
patty come with benefits  you need me 
stop playing like you don t 
you re in 
yeah 
you get a car 
and you get a car  and you get a car 
you didn t disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse 
i m sorry  my uncle owns a funeral home 
not a enterprise rent a car 
hope you checked to see
there wasn t a body in the back 
i don t think so  i don t really know 
you didn t check 
i mean  i was in a hurry 
i checked to see if we had gas 
that was more important 
so there is a body 
let holtzmann check 
she likes that type of stuff 
yeah  i can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today 
no  dr  frankenstein 
we got to turn in the body
if there s one in there 
 all right 
 don t do that 
based on the results
of the subway field test   
the one where you were
almost killed  remember 
i remember 
i added a booster using microfabricated
radio frequency quadrupoles
to speed up particles
before entering the dla device 
portable  wearable for maximum flexibility 
then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync
plus holtzy s hollow beam to this baby 
and voilг  
we got a ghost in there 
 slap me 
 okay 
i will slap you as   
i just want to say
what an exciting moment this is 
holtzmann  i am beyond impressed 
abby  is that comfortable 
it s a lot heavier than i expected 
and i m pretty sure
it s compacting my spinal column  but   
 so you re gonna want to plant your feet firm 
 okay 
bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback 
all right  turning the machine on 
boy  she s got an impressive purr 
all right  so that s the target right there 
just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there 
 yeah 
 and go to town 
okay 
and here we go 
i guess she s not
bending her knees enough  right 
she s doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon 
we just got to let her ride it out
until she s out of juice 
she s corkscrewing me 
abby  i ll make some adjustments 
it s like fighting a gator 
so  how did the two of you guys meet 
abby transferred
to my high school  junior year 
go  karate cats 
we started telling ghost stories 
and we just kind of bonded right away 
and all the other kids were  you know 
getting drunk and going to parties 
and we re like   that s stupid  
plus  we were never invited to the parties 
no  i think that s because we told
very  very scary ghost stories 
and i think the other kids were terrified of us 
that s what was actually happening 
so  how did y all get into ghosts 
did one of you see one 
yeah  i did 
really 
when i was eight years old 
the mean old lady that lived next door died 
and that night  i woke up
and she was standing at the foot of my bed 
just staring at me 
she did that every night for almost a year 
what 
and i told my parents 
and they didn t believe me 
still don t believe me 
i had to go to therapy for years 
and the kids at school found out 
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me 
call me  ghost girl  
abby was the only person who believed me 
kids is mean  man  but i believe you 
thanks 
 i have some questions 
 seriously 
it was a long time ago 
hello 
looking forward to this metal show 
hi 
ozzy rocks 
yeah 
yes 
he certainly does rock 
this world cannot be cleansed fast enough 
hi 
enjoy the show 
rock and roll 
a local team of paranormal investigators
released a video of a proclaimed ghost 
you can see clearly there s something
in the picture that isn t easily explained 
oh  my god  they re showing the video 
we famous  we famous 
as a result  there are
a lot of questions being asked now
about the people who shot the video 
so  what do we think of these ghostbusters 
are they to be taken seriously  and   
 ghostbusters   that is not our name 
they can t just make up a name
and just call us   
i spoke with martin heiss earlier

 okay 
 martin heiss  okay  okay

he is a famed debunker of the paranormal 
dr  heiss  you re a highly regarded
scientific authority 
 your credentials are impeccable 
 thank you  pat 
if you see something
of true scientific interest in this video

ghostbusters and everything they stand for 
a game changer  yes 
so  tell me  dr  heiss  is this for real 
hell no 
so  now we re the ghost girls 
i feel your pain  erin

so warm and tingly inside 
that s probably the radiation 
hey  guys  i got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here 
if you want to just turn your head 
i got some newly printed circuit boards 
and i rebuilt the superconducting magnets 
i improved beam accuracy
by adding a plasma shield
to the rf discharge chamber 
i have cryocooler to reduce helium boil off 
and to top it all off 
we got a freakin  faraday cage
to attenuate rf noise and avoid quenching 
 nice 
 all right 
there s a smartin christ here to see you 
smartin christ 
wait  are you saying  martin heiss

they re not here 
dr  heiss  hello  welcome  dr  erin gilbert

or is this dinner rush 
why don t you call
and make an appointment 
it s actually a perfect time 
we were just
doing some experiments over here 
yes  please  have a seat 
let s start light and easy 
why are you pretending to catch ghosts 
you know  it s really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer 
when you don t actually do anything 
you know that we only comprehend
about 4  of the universe 
4  
 across the board  it s four 
 abby  abby   
we all believe in the scientific method 
i ve dedicated my life to it 
and we have actually done it 
today  at 4 32 p m  
we successfully trapped a class 3 vapor 
you re telling me
there is a ghost
inside that thermos 
 in that can 
 don t touch it  don t touch it 
booyah  emphasis on the  boo  
well  i would love to see that  i really would 
shoot  you know what 
you re not gonna get that treat today 
we re still assessing what type
of containment method we re gonna use 
we re testing the lab    in the   
so  till we figure out
how to best keep the entity 
that s not gonna happen 
how s that for my timing 
i come 
you ve caught a ghost  i can t see it 
look  i know it probably
sounds like we re making this up 
 yeah 
 it sounds crazy 
and we probably don t really look like
legitimate scientists 
no  you only lack the proper equipment 
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of 
said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat 
it was my mother s 
yeah  that is an awesome hat 
all right  man  thanks for stopping by 
well  i guess the graciousness has run out 
you want to see it 
i would love to see it 
well  he can t see it 
i m going to show it to you  then 
how about that 
 gear up  you guys 
 no  you re not  don t 
excuse me  why are you doing this 
because he doesn t believe us 
erin  come on  we have finally succeeded

who cares if you impress him 
golly  you two are something 
you re right  i m sorry 
 i don t   
 okay

attagirl 
sorry  i did it  i m sorry 
 my god 
 i know 
casper 
man 
hey  that man went out the wrong door 
oh  my god 
who threw him out the window 
a ghost threw him out the window 
you mean like patrick swayze 
like  he s sitting behind you 
making some pottery 
yeah  like patrick swayze 
that s it  then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the catskills 
and then we sat down 
and he was behind me 
and we made a vase 
you re combining the two   
 i combined a couple of swayze movies 
 yeah 
you know what was a good one 
road house 
i loved road house 
 point break 
 he was a   
point break 
come on  at the end with the big wave 
he was a ghost in that  too 
well  you don t know if he dies at the end 
he doesn t die 
he doesn t die  they don t say he dies 
well  now what 
 who are you guys 
 official business 
we ll take it from here  thank you 
 what 
 you need to come with us 
 what 
 why 
the mayor needs a word  ladies 
mayor 
hey  there you are 
welcome  sorry for the mess
and for the drama 
please  come sit down  take that one 
good  that s right 
and  you  that s a good one for you 
and take the end seat  good 
that s not so good 
no feet on the table  please 
sir  we don t have a lot of time 
 and we re not frauds 
 no 
 we are legitimate scientists 
 let me interrupt you 
we know you re not frauds 
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely 
agents hawkins and rorke
are with homeland security 
so we ve been investigating
this extremely quietly 
 okay 
 so  what do you know 
we believe that someone is creating a device
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity 
and that activity can be escalating now
and giving us an even larger scale event 
 larger scale   well  that sounds terrible 
okay  well 
you ve been doing great work  well done 
we really appreciate it 
but it s time to knock it off 
 what 
 knock it off 
no  i heard you and i see the hand gesture 
what does   
these gentlemen are on it 
let the government do their work 
we re just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention   
 exactly 
    to yourselves 
what 
 patty does wear big earrings 
 patty 
well  if it s a crime to look good 
guilty as charged 
other than that  i feel like
we keep a very low profile 
you drive a hearse with a ghost on it 
and you use a distinctly
un american sounding siren 
we do 
do you have any idea
how many federal regulations
you re breaking on a daily basis 
 one 
 no 
 two 
 no 
is it one 
just sit quietly 
here s the essence of the deal 
we are gonna have to
make the public believe
that you are frauds 
 what  wait  why 
 what 
the human brain  you know 
it can only handle so much 
if everybody knew what was going on 
you know  there d be a panic 
so  we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax 
 cause  otherwise  there d be mass hysteria 
we don t want mass hysteria either 
our main concern is that
we re allowed to continue our work 
 yes  that is very important 
 very important 
but my concern is  i feel like the cat is sort of
already kind of out of the bag 
i think what they re saying is
the cat is out of the bag 
they want us to put the cat
back inside the bag 
no  i know that s what they re saying 
 but i m saying the cat s already out 
 i know  i know it s out 
 so it s hard to put the cat back in 
 it s not impossible 
 but that s why they have that saying 
 it s a nonsense saying 
if the cat is outta the bag 
you can t put it back in 
i put a cat in a bag all the time 
but once the cat is out of the bag 
aren t you like   the cat is out of the bag  
we just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag 
the cat has been out of the bag before 
and yet  people lose interest
and put it back in 
people always move on 
sheriff in new mexico
reports a ufo encounter 
the crew of the ss ourang medan
dies mysteriously 
the entire town of langville  montana 
goes missing 
it does 
okay  but he   
we re talking about relocating 
no one s being killed here  right 
they were turned inside out 
their skin is on the inside of their body 
their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside 
but they re okay  right 
sure 
i think they re dead 
on that horrifying note 
thank you all so much for coming 
now  the mayor said we could
continue our work  and so we shall 
we got to be prepared 
that s why i ve made a table of treats 
erin  you ve had a hard day  step right up 
pick a gun  any gun 
no 
i m sorry  not that gun 
that one s not ready  it s yours when it is 
here  in the meantime   
this 
what does it do 
it s a swiss army knife 
no woman should walk around unarmed 
i know what it does 
 also  here  why don t you take this 
 yeah 
give that a toss 
that s gonna send up a little poof 
it s only dangerous to ghosts 
 all right 
 okay 
nice 
yeah  my mistake  it was a medium poof 
this puppy i like to call a ghost chipper 
hollow laser technology 
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it 
step up to bat and do what you re gonna do 
you truly scare me 
i just want to let you know that 
i m gonna just   
come on 
it s like mardi gras in there 
it s a proton glove 
it s gonna maximize flexibility
during hand to specter combat 
just give it a punch  it s motion activated 
okay  that
was awesome 
 no  that is a deadly high five 
 no 
 no 
 hey  ladies 
i d call this a successful test 
it s fraudulent and unsafe  frankly 
you know  these ghostbusters
are creating an unnecessary panic
 in a sad grab for fame 
 it s fine 
people can rest assured
that these women are fake 
well  it s official  we re all ghost girls now 
all right  i would like
to remind everybody here
that in a very short amount of time 
we have seen
multiple class 4 malevolent apparitions 
 yeah 
 we did 
who cares what anybody else
is saying about us 
we know what we re doing 
i mean  all morning 
i ve been reading about this stuff 
there s sightings all over the city 
 wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th  
another one 
 spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th  
then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at chelsea 
 wait  did you say 6th and 26th 
 yeah   wailing spirits  6th and 26th  
6th and 26th  6th and 26th  okay 
6th and 26th 
aldridge mansion  upper west side  yes 
70    72nd 
where did we find the first device 
 at the subway  right here 
 okay 
theater  downtown  downtown 
 downtown 
 yes  yes  in here 
okay  what was the other address you said 
polar bear on 63rd and 5th avenue 
and the one in chelsea 
 chelsea is at 10th avenue and 18th 
 18th  10th and 18th 
what do those look like to you 
it s an  x   touching other little  x s  
 ley lines 
 ley lines 
what s  ley lines  
it s a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the earth 
it s a current of supernatural energy 
supposedly  if you look at sacred sites
and weird events all over the world 
and connect them with lines
where they intersect 
it s an unusually powerful spot 
abby and i just dismissed this theory
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit 
dismiss this 
okay  that looks like it s got some merit 
he s using the devices
to charge the ley lines 
 he s creating a vortex 
 a vortex 
oh  boy 
okay  if he gets one of his machines in there
and it s big enough 
he s gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier 
letting whatever s on this plane
come crashing down on this plane 
okay  i m calling this in 
okay  that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th 
what is there now 
the mercado 
mercado  it s spanish for  table  
the mercado  that actually makes sense 
okay  yes  i m looking for
agents hawkins and rorke 
the mercado has one of
the weirdest histories
of the buildings in new york 
okay  so it s your standard issue
haunted building 
no  this is even before it was a building 
all sorts of massacres happened at that spot 
like the peaceful trade between
the lenape indians and captain warren 
then  all of a sudden  everybody dies 
oh  my god  you guys 
this is the dude that was at the subway
that was talking about the cataclysms 
this is him 
it s always the sad  pale ones 
okay  ladies  let s gear up
and hit that mercado 
who s in the mood to save new york city 
and did you try adjusting the thermostat
before placing this call 
well  i m terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room 
why don t you hold while i connect you
to someone who might care 
 hi  excuse me 
 hold on 
 what do you want 
 where s your janitor 
that nut job  what has he done   
i don t want to know 
just take the stairs down and get him out 
hey  stop right there 
shut it down 
the ghostbusters 
look  i think it s great
you found yourself a little hobby 
and i m sure  on paper 
flooding new york city with ghosts
seemed like a great idea 
but we happen to like the world the way it is 
then you must ve been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being 
which i have been denied 
not really 
people dump on us pretty much all the time 
i am a genius 
i see things that no one else does 
and for it  i am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery 
luckily  i am not
the only one seeking revenge 
behind these are millions of souls 
souls which have been cast aside 
souls who see the world
as it truly is  as garbage 
garbage that needs to be cleaned up 
when these barriers are destroyed 
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living 
 pester the living  doesn t sound so bad 
they will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment 
that s a different definition of  pester 
than what i was thinking 
i think the word we re looking for
is apocalypse  apocalypse 
well  let s get these barriers destroyed 
shall we 
wait  wait  wait  rowan 
i get it  you don t like people 
people can be terrible 
the thing is  though 
there s so many terrific things out there 
i mean  wonderful things
that are worth living for 
i mean  you got soup 
and  you know  that first    you know when   
god  i can only think of soup 
anybody  somebody  patty 
 salad 
 salad 
no  no  no  wait  wait  wait 
okay  stop what you re doing 
the police are already on their way 
it s over  you re going to jail  rowan 
well  in that case 
bye 
that s a weird move 
he dead  that s a dead man 
see if you can shut that thing down 
 come on 
 holtz 
holtz  are we good 
well  he s not  but  yeah  we re okay 
okay  well  that s over 
okay  we re down here  down here 
you hate to see the smart ones go bad 
man  it smells like burned bologna
and regrets down here 
like  the dude that worked here 
he  like  dressed  like 
in a captain kirk type outfit 
 what s up 
 he was  like  standing over here   
i don t know  it s strange 
you know  his technology s
not that different from ours 
it s basically  like  we re
both using the same science 
 that is strange 
 i think i know why 
look what mr  cuckoo pants
has been reading at the beach  no 
oh  my god 
i told you that there would be
people out there that loved our work 
why am i so flattered that
that weird little sociopath bought our book 
thank you for everything you did 
you saved us all 
the mayor thanks you  of course 
privately  so don t tell anyone 
can i walk you out 
well  why don t you all go get some rest 
these gentlemen here
will get you out of here  okay 
 thank you  that s very nice 
 all right 
 thanks for all you ve done  ladies

he seemed more like a chet to me 
i must admit i am enjoying the body 
first time in my life i don t have to suck it in 
i know you re getting real comfy
in your kevin skin suit 
but it s time you hop out 
we like him 
despite his many  many frustrating quirks 
 he just started figuring out the phones 
 yeah 
i don t know

pure muscle  and baby soft skin 
come on  rowan  show yourself 
what form would you prefer i take 
maybe something stationary

like a friendly little ghost 
is this what you want 
something more familiar 
ice cream 
well  you know what 
i don t have no problem with that 
thank you very much for being reasonable 
if this is what you want  it works for me 
god  he s really going for it 
man  i said cute  cute 
god 
no  no  no  no 
no 
okay  this is not good 
run  run 
come on 
erin 
okay  homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon 
what part of  small and friendly 
did he not understand 
this is bad 
we need to reverse the portal 
it s gonna take an insane amount of energy 
yo  what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car 
if we can get those reactors
super critical inside the vortex 
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity 
causing a total protonic reversal 
it s gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap 
you are a genius  patty 
i m a ghostbuster 
all right  let s narrow his path 
aim for the silver canisters 
it s working 
he s too strong 
we can t let the portal close
with him still here 
all right  ladies 
let s loosen his grip 
yo  that s where
you wanted us to shoot  right 
yes 
look out 
abby 
the portal s closing 
 abby  hang on  i m coming 
 what is she doing 
hang on  abby 
abby 
erin 
i wasn t gonna leave you twice 
yeah 
hold on 
 oh  my god 
 we got to get  em out of there 
we got to get  em out of there 
shut up 
yeah 
hell yeah 
yeah  yeah 
oh  my god  oh  my god 
oh  my god 
yeah  yeah 
 what s  whoa  
 yes

my   
my gosh

my gosh 
what year is it 
 it s 2040 
 what 
 our president is a plant 
 oh  my god 
i m kidding  you were gone two seconds 
 we did it 
 yeah 
 yeah  you did it 
 yep 
 we all did it 
 we all did it 
 we all did it 
 that s right 
 we all did it 
 well   
what did you do  kevin 
i did a lot  actually 
i ll have you know that
i walked over to the power box 
pushed a bunch of buttons 
everything got sucked into the portal 
then it closed up 
 kev 
 that s   
sweet  sweet kev  the two are unrelated 
more important question 
when did you have time to get a sandwich 
when i was looking for you guys 
i looked in that deli over there 
when we were risking our lives 
trying to save new york city 
you stopped in to get a sandwich 
quit splitting hairs  okay 
potatoes  tomatoes  it doesn t matter 
point is  the ghostbusters   
are back together again  okay 
and that s what friends are for 
 just glad you okay  man 
 kevin 
yes  hold my hand longer 
okay  okay  okay 
i love the hair  by the way 
makes you look a lot older 
you know what 
a little help  please 
no 
in the aftermath of the events 
authorities are still trying to understand
what happened in times square
and throughout the city 
i saw pilgrims  ghost pilgrims 
so you re honestly gonna stand here
and tell me that we didn t all see ghosts 
that what actually happened
was that terrorists drugged all of the water
with hallucinogens 
yes  yes 
wait  what 
 baba booey 
 i    i   
   with the government trying to claim
the event wasn t supernatural 
despite so many eyewitness accounts
to the contrary 
the big question is 
was it the four women
who refer to themselves as ghostbusters
who actually thwarted the attack 
we may never know 
well  now i know how batman feels 
you know what 
you don t have to keep fiddling with it 
i think it looks nice  right 
i d talk to you at an aa meeting 
it s my fault  anyway 
the box said the color was called garfield 
it wasn t even the cat  it was the president 
well 
you know what  i want to make a toast 
 here we go 
 here we go 
physics is the study of
the movement of bodies in space 
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe 
but it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here 
and  to me  the purpose of life is to love 
and to love is what you have shown me 
i didn t think that i would
ever really have a friend until i met abby 
and then i feel like i have a family of my own 
and i love you  thank you 
thank you 
i mean  that was like a real thing right there 
 yeah  that was   
 that was  like  so real 
i m so sorry i m late 
we want to thank you for your discretion 
it s not working at all  but thank you 
actually  we d like you to continue
to study this subject 
fully funded 
you know  we need to be better prepared 
just in case 
 yeah  yes  that s smart 
 yes 
whatever you need  going forward 
anything at all 
anything 
anything 
hell yeah 
second floor is mine 
you can t claim a whole floor 
 i just did 
 you can t   
you can t do that  holtzy 
not bad  ghost girl 
thank you  and i proudly take that title 
 is that   
 patty s uncle 
unc 
where is it 
what are you talking about 
i told you what happened 
where s the car 
 it s on the other side 
 in jersey 
no  in the portal 
you know what  we should probably
let them just work this out 
 excuse me 
 patty 
i got four funerals this weekend 
i can t do them with just one hearse 
maybe you could do two at a time 
we re not stacking  em like flapjacks 
 here you go 
 thank you 
i know what you did 
what 
bennie  don t get weird on me  okay 
what is   
yeah 
i m just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth 
this is absolute madness 
ghostbusters  please give
a detailed description of your apparition 
well  that sounds like
an illusional meta physious  spectro mian 
i m talking like you guys 
 way to go  kev 
 yeah 
well  that sounds very scary 
it s probably  cause you got
a lot of bad karma from your previous life 
i hate coffee 
i m just gonna disconnect his phone 
 he won t notice 
 no 
how s it going over here 
good  really good 
i m working on some kind of next level stuff 
case in point 
what is this for 
it catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else 
i don t know where 
but i have a feeling it s michigan 
hey  how s this containment unit 
you got that up and going 
that  that s going real smooth 
i just would say don t be in a room with it
for more than an hour at a time 
because i m thinking a lot of hair loss 
well  that might be
something we want to work on 
hi  hello  sorry  i didn t know
anyone else was here 
what a ding a ling  i forgot to introduce 
this is my mentor  dr  rebecca gorin 
this is reckless  jillian 
all someone has to do is sneeze too hard
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate 
it s completely unstable 
do we need this safety light 
safety lights are for dudes 
safety lights are for dudes 
i hate doing that 
hey  y all need to come check this out 
come up to the roof 
is that for us 
i guess some people
actually do know what we did 
well  that s not terrible 
no  it s not 
it s not terrible at all 
i call it the nutcracker 
 cause it crushes the ghost
