at the time of its construction
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence
featuring every luxury including a face bidet
and an antiirish security fence
over here
you can imagine sir aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests
its said that in this very room pt barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants
and if youll follow me
now im gonna tell you
something a little spooky
on the morning of october 25th 1894
sir aldridge awoke furious
when his breakfast was not waiting for him
so he called to his servants
but none of them responded
why
because during the night one by one
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep
it was later discovered
they were murdered by his eldest daughter
gertrude aldridge
sir aldridge once wrote in his diary
i know god makes no mistakes
but i believe he may have been drunk
when he built gertrudes personality
now to spare the family public humiliation
instead of turning her in to the police
they locked her in this basement
and they fed her
through this slot
years later when a new owner moved in
they dug out her remains
but after repeatedly hearing strange sounds
he sealed it shut
thats right
no one has opened this door since then
okay
follow me
maybe steer clear of the door
sorry sir aldridge i got to get out of here
garret you idiot
no
no
no no no
no no
no
daniel teresa
sean that is an excellent question
as you can see from my calculations
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory
teaching in the big hall big day
big hall big hall big hall
big hall

about something you wrote
im sorry yes what

coauthor of ghosts from our past
both literally and figuratively
the study of the paranormal
no selfrespecting scientist
believes in the paranormal
i can assure you that
im sorry
youre looking for a different erin gilbert
okay but this really does look like you

erin
hi dr filmore hello hi
were set for the final review
of your tenure case on thursday
great
but i saw that you had
a recommendation letter
from dr branum at princeton
their science department
is really not what it used to be
and i would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college
more prestigious than princeton
yes
you see i think youre an asset
to modern physics
but i would hate to see you
throw it down the drain
i wont throw it down the drain sir
and i will get on that letter
and about your clothes
yes did you
too sexy for academia
never mind
no no no what is it
never mind
i dont
abby you promised you wouldnt do this
abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal
at the kenneth p higgins
institute of science
come on f7
are you kidding me
hello
ive been waiting a long time
has been a while hasnt it
hope you brought me more than one wonton
excuse me
well well well
erin
abby
bennie
yes i know who you are bennie can i just
can i have my lunch
that ive been waiting an hour for
you know they make
smaller headphones now right
its an advance in science
thank you for asking
probably the future youre looking at
here you go
why dont you show miss gilbert to the door
its just the same door we came in from
yeah i know how to get out its figurative
its really not that hard
no im okay
dont
i tried
poorly
you put our book online
without my permission
i dont need your permission
of course you need my permission
i wrote that book with you
my name is on it
no absolutely not
that book is a whole new
revenue stream for me
and im like onetenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here
look i am up for tenure right now
im up for tenure
and if my colleagues at columbia university
google my name
that is the first thing that comes up
along with a ghost emoji now
thank you very much
that does a little dance
you know what
that book was our baby
and you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly
okay well books cant fly
and neither can babies so
you dont know ill tell you what
if i had a human baby that could fly
i wouldnt be telling the press about it
if i had a flying baby
id zip this and so would you
there is no experimental backing
for anything in that book
and it makes me look like a crazy person
god are you kidding me
what
i got one wonton
i got a tub of soup
and i got one split wonton
look at that just floating there
im sorry youre having
a soup crisis right now
theres not even any meat in there
thats just a carrot
abby please
yes
abby
youre killing me i got one wonton again
you got to send bennie back
and tell him no tip i should charge him
and it was split up the middle
come here often
im sorry hello
who are you
holtzmann
erin
ive heard terrible things about you
dont get too close to her holtzmann
shell ask you to write a book
and then shell squash your dreams
okay
holtzmann works with me here in the lab
shes a brilliant engineer and very loyal
she would not abandon you
i get it
she also happens to specialize in
experimental particle physics
holtzmann and i are really busy here
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book
really
yeah
were incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam
really close
youre making a reverse tractor beam
abby why dont you let her listen to the evp
what evp
no not theres no evp
evp is electro
electro voice phenomenon
im familiar i know what it means
and theres never been one substantiated
there hasnt there hasnt been one
you know what you come with me
with a suit on and you get so cocky
a few months ago we spent eight nights
at the chelsea hotel
we didnt get anything
well we didnt think so
and then later in the lab when we were
reviewing these tapes
you really got me
you know what
usually we cant even get people over here
but we have never
she came right over to it
never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine
its a cool joke that was funny
its disgusting
is it more or less disgusting
if i tell you it came from the front
whats next you gonna give me a wedgie
no i think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt
burn
okay you know what i thought
we could have an adult conversation
but apparently we cant
erin if you dont believe
in this stuff anymore
then why were you looking for the book
a man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted
what building
the aldridge mansion
its obviously a joke
what are you doing
see this is this is exactly
you want to go find some ghosts
yes
break
wait youre going
i got the pack
abby please abby the book

dead for 15 years
eds a ghost knew it
i just saw him today
hes
so who is this
thats eds son ed junior
okay thats obviously who i meant thats
hi junior if i may when is the last time
the paranormal entity was actually seen
and if you were to rank it lets say between
probably a t1 and t5
garret here saw it on tuesday
and i believe it made him soil himself
jesus
wow soiling
id put that at a t3
t4 if it was poop
what
unless you ate something weird
then it wasnt the ghost
kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though
i didnt soil myself
he did he called me sobbing saying
oh my god my pants are toast
okay all right
id love to get that back to the lab
well so i have made the introduction
yeah thank you
there you go
all right well how bout
you take us across the street
i got to get in there set up
lets go on a tour
youre gonna die in there
aldridge mansion take one
and we are rolling
checking the settings we look good
what is that
looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy
its a pke meter
theres a ghost anywhere around here
this babys gonna find it
does it work
yeah it works
i just havent had the appropriate proximity
to an entity for it to work
strange reading here
maam can you tell us where you got
the worlds tiniest bow tie
it came with the shirt
okay somebody really doesnt
want us getting in that door
can you tell us what its like
to walk around in those shoes all day
its not fun

doctor of particle physics at columbia
yes
god
shes getting away come on
hurry hurry
run

whered it go whered it go
whered it go whered it go
there
what just happened
abby what just happened
ill tell you what just happened
we saw a ghost
we saw a ghost
yeah we saw a ghost
we saw a ghost oh my god
we saw a ghost
we saw a ghost
oh my god we saw a ghost
we were right we werent crazy
we saw a ghost
ghosts are real ghosts are real
i believe in ghosts cause i just saw one
theyre real
who is that
dr bronstein saw this on reddit
it was reblogged
from a site entitled ghost news
not a publication id heard of
i hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure
i accept your tenure
when we give someone tenure
they represent this institution
but this is just not
what this institution is about
dr gibbons hello
just moving offices
you know
they found a couple cats in the wall
really stunk in there glad im getting out
i didnt get fired
i got fired
after years
years of hard work
and asskissing
god i kissed so many
different kinds of asses
erin were sorry that you lost your job
but i mean there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it
i mean we saw a real ghost
you know and she was beautiful
till she dislocated her jaw
and ectoprojected all over you
yeah that stuff went everywhere
by the way in every crack
but i got to say
even that was kind of spectacularly beautiful
i did detect a heavy ionization discharge
i mean i could smell it
a fulltorso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression
i mean how often does that happen
i mean they want us to be quiet about that
we are not gonna be quiet about that
and its not just us
we have over 100 comments already
and theyre not all crazies
come here i want to show you this
read that
aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts
no no okay
the one below it
this woman is describing
a class 3 haunting in her house
she cant just move she cant call the police
she cant call her friends
whos she gonna call
ghost jumpers
tonight the ghost jumpers
make contact with the ghost of bigfoot
god these phonies
i mean you know what
these guys are the reason you got fired
its because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work
this cannot be the best option for people
okay we are on the cusp of something here
a real discovery
unlike columbia
this institute is 100 behind us
really
erin this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids
i know that if you come and join us here
they are gonna be so pumped
we just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money
i just honestly didnt realize
your department still existed
what
come on ghosts
i will not let the 12year reputation
of this fine institution be besmirched by you
come on suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold
youre only dean now
because the last dean went to jail
are you saying that im not qualified
you spell science with a y
and whats upsetting about that is
i dont think you know that thats wrong
this is an institution of higher learning
and if you guys want to study ghosts
do it somewhere else
because i have two words for you
let me guess get out
no hes gonna say suck it
hes not gonna say suck it
suck it
you were right
you know
my gosh
i think it might be a ghost
no its not its just a bird
bye theres the door
later days can you hear this
let me turn it up
oh my god
this is incredibly immature behavior
caught it
just a minor setback
you know what guys
i think we can really do this
we can become the first scientists to prove
the existence of the paranormal
all we have to do is
find an entity and capture it
and bring it into a controlled environment
thats all
hey theres the erin i remember
welcome back
thank you
nice
okay we should probably
get this equipment out of here
theyre gonna want it back
i thought this stuff was yours
all stolen
no
hey that worthless garbage
belongs to this school
scatter scatter scatter
go go go scatter

erin
ive got some questions
okay here we go
let me just get to my notes
okay
all right first off i just want to say
you know we should probably start with
a very important question
that were asking all of the applicants
you know are you seeing anyone right now
seeing anyone
yeah
just for business purposes
business purposes only
well im seeing all three of you
in front of me
just forget she even asked
because if she did that would be illegal so
forgotten
jillian holtzmann radio times
what have you been doing
with your whole life
great question
well lots of different jobs
i did the actor thing

im just gonna just real quick
can i ask why no glass
yeah they just kept getting dirty
so i took them out
thats
dont have to clean them anymore
oh boy

i got to try to keep that in mind
yeah
would it be okay
if i bring mike hat to work sometimes
he has major anxiety problems
you know what i would love
to let your cat live here with you

no i dont have a cat
hes a dog his name is mike hat
your dogs name is my cat
no mike hat
your dogs name is mike last name hat

i cant say that im allergic to dogs so
its all right he lives with my mum
well then we have that figured out
okay that was
one down no cat
but you know what i say lets jump ahead
kevin dabbles in web design
and i asked him to throw together
maybe a couple of logos for us
you want to see them
now is your moment
pull it out

youre like a lawsuit waiting to happen
here we go
okay so
what do you think of that
yeah you do see how this
might make us look bad right
is it the boobs you dont like
cause i can make them bigger
no i can see them
yeah i can definitely see them
you know what i think
its not always about the end result
its about the journey
well what about this one
i think thats already a thing
what 711
its 7eleven
yep it is i have another option though
okay please
its this one
thats one of my favorites
i think you mightve made a mistake
i dont think that ones for us
no no thats for you
you know i just thought the floating hot dog
implies that a ghost is holding it
your work is more cerebral than i expected
see some more
those are great
yeah
were actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second
so if you could just stand over there
we just need to convene for a moment
okay
sure all right
thank you
just go right over there
dont listen
i wont
he covered his eyes

unless yall little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts
come on
you know what
i shouldve gave you some coveralls man

thats pretty much how its gonna be
its not gonna freshen up at all
oh boy okay
definitely got something over here
look at is that
what is that a burn
thats where i saw that weird sparking thing
what was it
baby if i knew what it was
i wouldnt say a weird sparking thing
it looks like fission scorch
what fission scorch down here
except that youre right
what is wait im smelling
both electrical discharge
and isotopic decay
isotopic decay
how is that holtzmann
yeah what
come here i need your snoot on this
am i nuts
ey ey ladies
while yall over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage
we only got a couple of minutes
do you see that

thats the dude i saw
im telling you thats him
we got another class 4
and this ones even more ionized
than the one at the aldridge mansion
where are these ghosts coming from
you know what
i got to get this thing on film
holtzmann
yup
power us up
okay
cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab
this is a little rough
its in its early stages got to be honest
just gonna plug these things in here
okay erin come here
let me document this
grab it grab it
wait
thats gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost okay
so whenever i say go you just do that
why am i operating
the untested nuclear laser
you have the longest arms
you guys might want to hurry up
oh my god i forgot the most important part
yeah sorry
erin this is just a little bit of grounding
so you dont die immediately
do you know your iron level
its fine
you have done this before right
okay erin on my cue
aim the barrel at him
ready aim fire
okay this is a little underwhelming
can we get more power
and once again fire
this isnt working
can this beam get any stronger
well not at the moment
thats the train we got to move
just try to lure him back to the platform
grab her
come on
move move move
come on move
hurry
thats the express train
and its not stopping
its coming get her up
not the collar
well i guess he going to queens
hes gonna be the third scariest thing
on that train
god did you see that
you cant see anything
my god i mean
that power surge really held him
we need more juice
we need to be more mobile
i know what to do
yes
i almost got killed
yeah i know it was so awesome
it was awesome
everyone thinks this video is fake
look at these comments
we have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it you guys
i mean this stuff is real
we have to be able to prove it
we will and you shouldnt
be reading this stuff
youre not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write
in the middle of the night online
look at
bogus equipment you know what
id love you to meet me any place any time

a lot about this science stuff
but i know new york
and check this out
i can borrow a car from my uncle
and yall wont have to lug
all this heavy equipment around
guys we got to get a car
come on baby
you need me you need patty
patty come with benefits you need me
stop playing like you dont
youre in
yeah
you get a car
and you get a car and you get a car
you didnt disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse
im sorry my uncle owns a funeral home
not a enterprise rentacar
hope you checked to see
there wasnt a body in the back
i dont think so i dont really know
you didnt check
i mean i was in a hurry
i checked to see if we had gas
that was more important
so there is a body
let holtzmann check
she likes that type of stuff
yeah i can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today
no dr frankenstein
we got to turn in the body
if theres one in there
all right
dont do that
based on the results
of the subway field test
the one where you were
almost killed remember
i remember
i added a booster using microfabricated
radiofrequency quadrupoles
to speed up particles
before entering the dla device
portable wearable for maximum flexibility
then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync
plus holtzys hollow beam to this baby
and voilг
we got a ghost in there
slap me
okay
i will slap you as
i just want to say
what an exciting moment this is
holtzmann i am beyond impressed
abby is that comfortable
its a lot heavier than i expected
and im pretty sure
its compacting my spinal column but
so youre gonna want to plant your feet firm
okay
bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback
all right turning the machine on
boy shes got an impressive purr
all right so thats the target right there
just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there
yeah
and go to town
okay
and here we go
i guess shes not
bending her knees enough right
shes doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon
we just got to let her ride it out
until shes out of juice
shes corkscrewing me
abby ill make some adjustments
its like fighting a gator
so how did the two of you guys meet
abby transferred
to my high school junior year
go karate cats
we started telling ghost stories
and we just kind of bonded right away
and all the other kids were you know
getting drunk and going to parties
and were like thats stupid
plus we were never invited to the parties
no i think thats because we told
very very scary ghost stories
and i think the other kids were terrified of us
thats what was actually happening
so how did yall get into ghosts
did one of you see one
yeah i did
really
when i was eight years old
the mean old lady that lived next door died
and that night i woke up
and she was standing at the foot of my bed
just staring at me
she did that every night for almost a year
what
and i told my parents
and they didnt believe me
still dont believe me
i had to go to therapy for years
and the kids at school found out
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me
call me ghost girl
abby was the only person who believed me
kids is mean man but i believe you
thanks
i have some questions
seriously
it was a long time ago
hello
looking forward to this metal show

you can see clearly theres something
in the picture that isnt easily explained
oh my god theyre showing the video

hey guys i got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here
if you want to just turn your head
i got some newly printed circuit boards
and i rebuilt the superconducting magnets
i improved beam accuracy
by adding a plasma shield
to the rf discharge chamber
i have cryocooler to reduce helium boiloff
and to top it all off
we got a freakin faraday cage
to attenuate rf noise and avoid quenching
nice
all right
theres a smartin christ here to see you
smartin christ
wait are you saying martin heiss
doctor

theyre not here
dr heiss hello welcome dr erin gilbert
is this a good time doctor
or is this dinner rush
why dont you call
and make an appointment
its actually a perfect time
we were just
doing some experiments over here
yes please have a seat
lets start light and easy
why are you pretending to catch ghosts
you know its really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer
when you dont actually do anything
you know that we only comprehend
about 4 of the universe
across the board its four
abby abby
we all believe in the scientific method
ive dedicated my life to it
and we have actually done it
today at 432 pm
we successfully trapped a class 3 vapor
youre telling me
there is a ghost
inside that thermos
in that can
dont touch it dont touch it
booyah emphasis on the boo
well i would love to see that i really would
shoot you know what
youre not gonna get that treat today
were still assessing what type
of containment method were gonna use
were testing the lab in the
so till we figure out
how to best keep the entity
thats not gonna happen
hows that for my timing
i come
youve caught a ghost i cant see it
look i know it probably
sounds like were making this up
yeah
it sounds crazy
and we probably dont really look like
legitimate scientists
no you only lack the proper equipment
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of
said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat
it was my mothers
yeah that is an awesome hat
all right man thanks for stopping by
well i guess the graciousness has run out
you want to see it
i would love to see it
well he cant see it
im going to show it to you then
how about that
gear up you guys
no youre not dont
excuse me why are you doing this
because he doesnt believe us
erin come on we have finally succeeded
at doing the thing that we have talked about
since we were little kids
and you want to risk it all what for him
who cares if you impress him
golly you two are something
youre right im sorry
i dont
okay
i dont know what i was thinking
all right
its okay
attagirl
sorry i did it im sorry
my god
i know
casper
man
hey that man went out the wrong door
oh my god
who threw him out the window
a ghost threw him out the window
you mean like patrick swayze
like hes sitting behind you
making some pottery
yeah like patrick swayze
thats it then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the catskills
and then we sat down
and he was behind me
and we made a vase
youre combining the two
i combined a couple of swayze movies
yeah
you know what was a good one
road house
i loved road house
point break
he was a
point break
come on at the end with the big wave
he was a ghost in that too
well you dont know if he dies at the end
he doesnt die
he doesnt die they dont say he dies
well now what
who are you guys
official business
well take it from here thank you
what
you need to come with us
what
why
the mayor needs a word ladies
mayor
hey there you are
welcome sorry for the mess
and for the drama
please come sit down take that one
good thats right
and you thats a good one for you
and take the end seat good
thats not so good
no feet on the table please
sir we dont have a lot of time
and were not frauds
no
we are legitimate scientists
let me interrupt you
we know youre not frauds
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely
agents hawkins and rorke
are with homeland security
so weve been investigating
this extremely quietly
okay
so what do you know
we believe that someone is creating a device
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity
and that activity can be escalating now
and giving us an even larger scale event
larger scale well that sounds terrible
okay well
youve been doing great work well done
we really appreciate it
but its time to knock it off
what
knock it off
no i heard you and i see the hand gesture
what does
these gentlemen are on it
let the government do their work
were just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention
exactly
to yourselves
what
patty does wear big earrings
patty
well if its a crime to look good
guilty as charged
other than that i feel like
we keep a very low profile
you drive a hearse with a ghost on it
and you use a distinctly
unamericansounding siren
we do
do you have any idea
how many federal regulations
youre breaking on a daily basis
one
no
two
no
is it one
just sit quietly
heres the essence of the deal
we are gonna have to
make the public believe
that you are frauds
what wait why
what
the human brain you know
it can only handle so much
if everybody knew what was going on
you know thered be a panic
so we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax
cause otherwise thered be mass hysteria
we dont want mass hysteria either
our main concern is that
were allowed to continue our work
yes that is very important
very important
but my concern is i feel like the cat is sort of
already kind of out of the bag
i think what theyre saying is
the cat is out of the bag
they want us to put the cat
back inside the bag
no i know thats what theyre saying
but im saying the cats already out
i know i know its out
so its hard to put the cat back in
its not impossible
but thats why they have that saying
its a nonsense saying
if the cat is outta the bag
you cant put it back in
i put a cat in a bag all the time
but once the cat is out of the bag
arent you like the cat is out of the bag
we just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag
the cat has been out of the bag before
and yet people lose interest
and put it back in
people always move on
sheriff in new mexico
reports a ufo encounter
the crew of the ss ourang medan
dies mysteriously
the entire town of langville montana
goes missing
it does
okay but he
were talking about relocating
no ones being killed here right
they were turned inside out
their skin is on the inside of their body
their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside
but theyre okay right
sure
i think theyre dead
on that horrifying note
thank you all so much for coming
now the mayor said we could
continue our work and so we shall
we got to be prepared
thats why ive made a table of treats
erin youve had a hard day step right up
pick a gun any gun
no
im sorry not that gun
that ones not ready its yours when it is
here in the meantime
this
what does it do
its a swiss army knife
no woman should walk around unarmed
i know what it does
also here why dont you take this
yeah
give that a toss
thats gonna send up a little poof
its only dangerous to ghosts
all right
okay
nice
yeah my mistake it was a medium poof
this puppy i like to call a ghost chipper
hollowlaser technology
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it
step up to bat and do what youre gonna do
you truly scare me
i just want to let you know that
im gonna just
come on
its like mardi gras in there
its a proton glove
its gonna maximize flexibility
during handtospecter combat
just give it a punch its motionactivated
okay that
was awesome
no that is a deadly high five
no
no
hey ladies
id call this a successful test
its fraudulent and unsafe frankly
you know these ghostbusters
are creating an unnecessary panic
in a sad grab for fame
its fine
people can rest assured
that these women are fake
well its official were all ghost girls now
all right i would like
to remind everybody here
that in a very short amount of time
we have seen
multiple class 4 malevolent apparitions
yeah
we did
who cares what anybody else
is saying about us
we know what were doing
i mean all morning
ive been reading about this stuff
theres sightings all over the city
wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th
another one
spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th
then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at chelsea
wait did you say 6th and 26th
yeah wailing spirits 6th and 26th
6th and 26th 6th and 26th okay
6th and 26th
aldridge mansion upper west side yes
70 72nd
where did we find the first device
at the subway right here
okay
theater downtown downtown
downtown
yes yes in here
okay what was the other address you said
polar bear on 63rd and 5th avenue
and the one in chelsea
chelsea is at 10th avenue and 18th
18th 10th and 18th
what do those look like to you
its an x touching other little xs
ley lines
ley lines
whats ley lines
its a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the earth
its a current of supernatural energy
supposedly if you look at sacred sites
and weird events all over the world
and connect them with lines
where they intersect
its an unusually powerful spot
abby and i just dismissed this theory
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit
dismiss this
okay that looks like its got some merit
hes using the devices
to charge the ley lines
hes creating a vortex
a vortex
oh boy
okay if he gets one of his machines in there
and its big enough
hes gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier
letting whatevers on this plane
come crashing down on this plane
okay im calling this in
okay that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th
what is there now
the mercado
mercado its spanish for table
the mercado that actually makes sense
okay yes im looking for
agents hawkins and rorke
the mercado has one of
the weirdest histories
of the buildings in new york
okay so its your standardissue
haunted building
no this is even before it was a building
all sorts of massacres happened at that spot
like the peaceful trade between
the lenape indians and captain warren
then all of a sudden everybody dies
oh my god you guys
this is the dude that was at the subway
that was talking about the cataclysms
this is him
its always the sad pale ones
okay ladies lets gear up
and hit that mercado
whos in the mood to save new york city
and did you try adjusting the thermostat
before placing this call
well im terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room
why dont you hold while i connect you
to someone who might care
hi excuse me
hold on
what do you want
wheres your janitor
that nutjob what has he done
i dont want to know
just take the stairs down and get him out
hey stop right there
shut it down
the ghostbusters
look i think its great
you found yourself a little hobby
and im sure on paper
flooding new york city with ghosts
seemed like a great idea
but we happen to like the world the way it is
then you mustve been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being
which i have been denied
not really
people dump on us pretty much all the time
i am a genius
i see things that no one else does
and for it i am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery
luckily i am not
the only one seeking revenge
behind these are millions of souls
souls which have been cast aside
souls who see the world
as it truly is as garbage
garbage that needs to be cleaned up
when these barriers are destroyed
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living
pester the living doesnt sound so bad
they will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment
thats a different definition of pester
than what i was thinking
i think the word were looking for
is apocalypse apocalypse
well lets get these barriers destroyed
shall we
wait wait wait rowan
i get it you dont like people
people can be terrible
the thing is though
theres so many terrific things out there
i mean wonderful things
that are worth living for

erin
okay homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon
what part of small and friendly
did he not understand
this is bad
we need to reverse the portal
its gonna take an insane amount of energy
yo what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car
if we can get those reactors
supercritical inside the vortex
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity
causing a total protonic reversal
its gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap
you are a genius patty
im a ghostbuster
all right lets narrow his path
aim for the silver canisters
its working
hes too strong
we cant let the portal close
with him still here
all right ladies

yep
we all did it
we all did it
we all did it
thats right
we all did it
well
what did you do kevin
i did a lot actually
ill have you know that
i walked over to the power box
pushed a bunch of buttons
everything got sucked into the portal
then it closed up
kev
thats
sweet sweet kev the two are unrelated
more important question
when did you have time to get a sandwich
when i was looking for you guys
i looked in that deli over there
when we were risking our lives
trying to save new york city
you stopped in to get a sandwich
quit splitting hairs okay
potatoes tomatoes it doesnt matter
point is the ghostbusters
are back together again okay
and thats what friends are for
just glad you okay man
kevin
yes hold my hand longer
okay okay okay
i love the hair by the way
makes you look a lot older
you know what
a little help please
no
in the aftermath of the events
authorities are still trying to understand
what happened in times square
and throughout the city
i saw pilgrims ghost pilgrims
so youre honestly gonna stand here
and tell me that we didnt all see ghosts
that what actually happened
was that terrorists drugged all of the water
with hallucinogens
yes yes
wait what
baba booey
i i
with the government trying to claim
the event wasnt supernatural
despite so many eyewitness accounts
to the contrary
the big question is
was it the four women
who refer to themselves as ghostbusters
who actually thwarted the attack
we may never know
well now i know how batman feels
you know what
you dont have to keep fiddling with it
i think it looks nice right
id talk to you at an aa meeting
its my fault anyway
the box said the color was called garfield
it wasnt even the cat it was the president
well
you know what i want to make a toast
here we go
here we go
physics is the study of
the movement of bodies in space
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe
but it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here
and to me the purpose of life is to love
and to love is what you have shown me
i didnt think that i would
ever really have a friend until i met abby
and then i feel like i have a family of my own
and i love you thank you
thank you
i mean that was like a real thing right there
yeah that was
that was like so real
im so sorry im late
we want to thank you for your discretion
its not working at all but thank you
actually wed like you to continue
to study this subject
fully funded
you know we need to be better prepared
just in case
yeah yes thats smart
yes
whatever you need going forward
anything at all
anything
anything
hell yeah
second floor is mine
you cant claim a whole floor
i just did
you cant
you cant do that holtzy

i cant do them with just one hearse
maybe you could do two at a time

here you go
thank you

what
bennie dont get weird on me okay
what is
yeah
im just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth
this is absolute madness
ghostbusters please give
a detailed description of your apparition
well that sounds like
an illusional metaphysious spectromian
im talking like you guys
way to go kev
yeah
well that sounds very scary
its probably cause you got
a lot of bad karma from your previous life
i hate coffee
im just gonna disconnect his phone
he wont notice
no
hows it going over here
good really good
im working on some kind of nextlevel stuff
case in point
what is this for
it catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else
i dont know where
but i have a feeling its michigan
hey hows this containment unit
you got that up and going
that thats going real smooth
i just would say dont be in a room with it
for more than an hour at a time
because im thinking a lot of hair loss
well that might be
something we want to work on
hi hello sorry i didnt know
anyone else was here
what a dingaling i forgot to introduce
this is my mentor dr rebecca gorin
this is reckless jillian
all someone has to do is sneeze too hard
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate
its completely unstable

safety lights are for dudes
safety lights are for dudes
i hate doing that
hey yall need to come check this out
come up to the roof

i guess some people
actually do know what we did
well thats not terrible

its not terrible at all
i call it the nutcracker
cause it crushes the ghost
