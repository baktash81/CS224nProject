you take your
daddys present now
whoa
i got a picture of you too
maria
no no no no
happy birthday darlin
no
whoa
thank you
obviously youve seen
mankiewiczs house of strangers
its one of my alltime
favorite movies
thats exactly what your
script reminded me of
the power struggle
the fight for
relevance yeah yeah
and youre gonna think
this sounds a little crazy
but in some ways
its king lear
its king lear yeah exactly
see i knew youd understand
what im trying
to do with this film
right
david i dont know
what to say exactly
except this is the
role of a lifetime
and id really love
to be a part of this
cool man ill just give you
a shout in a couple of days
oh if youre worried
about the boston accent
i can do the boston accent
ive been working
on it all week
im not worried nick
okay well if you have
any other questions
or you just wanna
talk give me a call
or if youd like me
to uh to read
you dont need to read for me
of course not
and obviously im not going to
obviously
but i bet a part of you would
love to hear me read right
i mean why wouldnt you
if i were you id
want to hear it
seriously i dont
want you to read okay
anyway this is
me so im gonna
well you know
what im gonna read
its a foregone
conclusion jimmy
it takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain
to send a message to the body
so by the time your bullets
hit me my cerebral cortex
will have transmitted a signal
to the 17 healthy muscles
that operate
my trigger finger
and before your asshole
has had a chance to pucker up
your medulla oblongata
will be splattered on a
fucking wall behind ya
and if thats the last
thing i accomplish
on this beautiful green earth
well then ha i say ha
what a way to fucking go
holy shit
i can do another if you want
damn man
that was good right felt good
mankiewicz
whoohoo incredible pull
i know it just
popped into my head
well good im happy for you
because honestly
man you really need this
what what is that
supposed to mean
you get it this could
be a game changer
i dont need a game changer
if it happens it happens
if it doesnt ill just keep
working thats what i do
im just saying you could
be a little more strategic
make more movie star choices
its like miles davis told me
sometimes its the notes
you dont play
miles davis was a heroin addict
i mean i love him
he was a maestro
but im happy
im healthy when im
working im an actor
no youre a fucking movie star
and dont you ever forget that
okay i dont need
this i dont need this
get out of my car
nicky get out of my car
i dont need this
i need this
this could be a game changer
so youre not happy with
how your career is going
because you seem to
be working all the time
well i never viewed it
as a career only as work
and whats wrong with that
i mean in any other job
hard work is
something to behold
but with film performance
youre making too
many movies nick
youre working too hard nick
have the audience
miss you more nick
i mean hello its my job
i pay my bills
i feed my family
youre annoying
my gosh
yeah
so whats the worry here nick
youve lost some
of your ability
your talent as an actor
no
uh
no its just that
i really want this
this is the role of a lifetime
its a great part
well how do you think your
relationship with your work
affects your relationship
with your daughter
lets bring addy
into this shall we
what oh you
dont have to do that
you guys can keep talking
well ill just finish with
a role like this doesnt
come along every day
and now im gonna zip it
i zipped it good
addy
how do you think
your dads anxiety
over his career
has affected you
well his career is pretty much
the only thing we talk about
that or he makes
me watch old movies
and then discuss them
which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours
its a conversation its
more of a conversation
he made me watch
this bizarre old movie
what was it called the
island of dr calamari
the cabinet of dr caligari
and did you like it addy
its one of my favorite
films have you seen it
no i have not
its about this
insane old doctor
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell
this crazy old loon
can you imagine how
horrifying that would be
to be completely
under someones spell
and you liked it right
i mean you like the painted
sets and the makeup
no i did not
sounds to me like
maybe she didnt
want to see the movie
did you think about that nick
about what she wants
cheryl come on is
that a real question
what do you think
hes gonna say
she has an amazing visual
sensibility always has
were very close and
within that closeness
i was able to ascertain
hey honey hi mom
bye addy i love you
oh no what happened
oh shes mad at me
because we watched
cabinet of dr caligari
together and she hated it
which i find odd given how
mature her taste normally is
wait youre surprised
your teenage daughter
didnt wanna watch an insane
100yearold
german film with you
yes oh my god okay
well its not just that
you know shes never
read mary shelley
or jane austen or even twain
what a little philistine
should we disown her
she thought humphrey
bogart was a porn star
yeah
what really yeah
thats disappointing
unless there is a porn star
called humphrey bogart
that would work wouldnt
it humphrey hump
no
look youre just
youre at a tricky
stage right now
with her okay

learn to connect

i mean what do we know
about this guy anyway

he into something strange
allan did some
research hold on
allan what does this guy do
he owns olive groves apparently
also he wrote this screenplay
and he wants nick to star in it
throw that in the fucking trash
nick youre fine
its not like hes gonna
want you to suck his dick
or fuck his wife
or watch you watch
him fuck his wife
i wouldnt think so relax
have fun and give me

mr cage i yeah
excuse me real quick
the guy that owns this
house whats his name
javi yeah javi
is javi going to want
me to uh you know
im not sure i understand
look if javi wants me to
suck his dick or fuck his wife
or watch me watch
him fuck his wife
thats a nogo you
understand its no bueno
i think so okay and if javi
i am javi
nick cage
so how was it
it was fine
normal no big deal
come on tell me
the truth okay okay
he was incredible was he
but also like super cool
he was a little taller
than i had imagined
because you know they
say actors are pretty short
so was he short
no no
he was
just right
okay but did he say anything
about your screenplay
no he didnt bring it
up i didnt bring it up
it wasnt the right time
just think about
how would it feel
to say in front of
everyone at the party
that nicolas cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote
i dont know gabriela
maybe i am living
in a fantasy world
i mean look who
were talking about here
the man is a legend
hi
hey
cheers
huh
what
oh no im sorry
i thought that
did you say no i did
oh never mind
yeah so along those same
lines i was wondering
and its totally
okay if you havent
but i was just wondering
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay
javi
can i come or its only for vip
uh mr cage this is
ms gabriela lucchesi hi
she runs all of our
agricultural operations
and this is my cousin
lucas gutierrez
mr cage we obviously are
very excited to have you here
what are you working on next
well thats a tough question
for an actor to
get but its fine
oh cause
im no longer an actor
ive retired
what what do you mean retired
so what are you
going to do now
live the life of a house cat
because its just
a matter of time
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice
and we retreat to the
black pit of nothingness
from whence we came
so tell us about
making the rock
bet you wish you
were still making movies
like that huh mr cage
must have been nice
to have been a star
and now
mr cage wake up
jesus christ
so mr gutierrez has been
waiting all day
for you to get up
he really wants to show you
one of his favorite
places of all spain
its called the cliffs
of cap de for mentor
yeah see well
im very jet lagged
so i wont be
attending that okay
thank you
oh my god mr cage
if mr gutierrez is asking you
to go with him
and see the cliffs
youre gonna go with
him and see the cliffs
and youre gonna
love the cliffs
even if you hate the cliffs
are we clear
gabriela said you are
really excited about the cliffs
yeah very much so its just
im not feeling
tiptop right now
so if you wanna
go out there alone
i could go back to
the room oh shit
shit what
we must go now
hey
javi
javi
what is going on
faster
what are we running from
the general
javi
hey
you need to tell me right
now what the hell is going on
or im getting my shit
and im going back
to los angeles
the general
the general forbade me
to see his daughter matilda
but we defied his orders
and now he
wants to end my life
cant you see him
all right all right i get it
youre making this up
what is this
like a little stanislavski
improv thing
well you can stop
stanislavski is he
part of the resistance
stop i am your guest
gabriela ripped the
bedspread off me this morning
now youre sending me
on like a wild goose chase
im sorry but you cant
quit acting you cant
thats none of your business
whether you like it
or not you have a gift
and that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly
dark and broken world
and to turn your
back on that gift
is to turn your back on
the entire human race
the human race
im afraid so
what am i gonna do
oh wow if we dont go now
they will fucking kill us
these people smell blood
and they come running
what am i gonna do
theyre almost to
the edge of the forest
i can hear them
and matilda she is
waiting down the coast
we have to go now
we have to jump
youre in an
untenable situation
you know that right
so tell me one thing
do you love her
ive always loved her
then lets get you
out of here alive
oh shit
fuck
oh god
i didnt know there was a cliff
i didnt know it was that high
we could have died
youre a wild man
i prefer bourbon but thank you
god this place is stunning
i bet my daughter
would like it out here
itd be good for her
are you two close
well its impossible to
be close with a 16yearold
but ive tried to be
there for her its just
theres no script for parenting
thank god for my ex olivia
how did you meet olivia
she was a makeup artist
on captain corellis mandolin
beautiful film thank you
underrated for sure
we just hit it off you know
she was funny smart beautiful
so what happened
what happened
what about you ever
been married kids
no
there is one woman but uh
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love
and thats just the way it is
anyway mr cage
what is your favorite movie
oh favorite movie
oh wow i mean
that that is uh
thats one of those questions
thats impossible to answer
because you see
100plus years of rich cinema
you cant just limit it to one
it depends upon your
mood the seasons
all right lets do
top three you start
number one faceoff
oh thank you
woo is a maestro thank you
number two let me think
the cabinet of dr caligari
you love
caligari i love caligari
wow i was beginning to
think i was the only one
you gonna run
the table here jav
its hard its like you said
100plus years of rich cinema
thank you
look can you just stop stalling
and answer the question
what is your third
favorite movie of all time
paddington 2
what
cabinet of dr caligari
paddington 2
connect those dots
i mean i dont wanna
be a snob but
i cried through
the entire thing
it made me want
to be a better man
bullshit man
paddington 2 is incredible
i fucking told you
truth or dare nick
truth
did you hate my
screenplay its okay if you did
i just need to know
you wrote a script
i sent it to your agent
he was supposed
to give it to you
well he didnt
i guess i can
understand why he didnt
but where is it
ill read it right now
now like right now right now
send it
i sent it fantastic
lets go into town
have a celebratory drink
you can watch me read it
see where it
drags itll be fun
no
honestly im too nervous
my heart is beating so fast
i think i need to go to bed
listen javi truth
i wasnt that thrilled
about coming out here
but tonight has
been the most fun
ive had in a long long time
so thank you
oh hey nicky
so youre unretired then
thats the idea
javi inspired you did
he you like this guy
he has good taste in movies
plus it could be
good for me to do
some smaller roles
with great directors
some challenging character work
huh so like um like what
the gay uncle
in the next duplass
brothers movie kind of thing
exactly
what the fuck are
you talking about
we havent worked
since you were 15
fortyone years to
be number seven
on a call sheet of a
goddamn student film
i think its a good idea
you listen to me
youre nick fucking
cage
addy doesnt need a
struggling artist for a father
she needs you to be a star
now you get the next
one baby and were back
not that we went anywhere
not that we went anywhere
come here
yeah nick cage smooches good
you tell em nick
cage smooches good
ill have another one
jesus
what do you guys
want you want money
here take my watch
its not a copy its real
mr cage were with the us
government we need your help
the man youre
staying with is the head
of a violent
international arms cartel
wait wait wait javi
hes a ruthless motherfucker
he started small coastal spain
but then he got greedy
trying to expand his
operations east west
trail of dead
bodies in his wake
javi gutierrez
yes javi
i dont think were talking
about the same javi
were definitely talking
about the same fucking javi
its the same fucking guy man
okay okay so youre cia
some kind of
intelligence right
and your job is to
read people yeah
well as a thespian
that is also my job
to understand
peoples characters
to feel what theyre feeling
which is how i know that
javi is not a gun dealer
youre saying
your acting ability
trumps five years of hard data
collected by the worlds
finest intelligence agency
my nouveau
shamanic acting ability
you better fucking believe it
oh hey guys this sucks
uh nicolas cages nouveau
shamanic acting ability
has determined that
we got the wrong guy
so lets pack up our
shit and fucking go home
hey man dont mind him
hes all messed up inside
he just found out his
wifes been fucking his dad
thats not all the way true
look do you
recognize this girl
no
its maria delgado
president of
catalonias daughter
javis men kidnapped
her two days ago
to force her father
out of the election
and make way for
someone more cartelfriendly
yeah the us
doesnt like that
yeah look hey
we need to access
javis security cameras
we cant get anywhere
near that compound
because its too fortified
and then you show up
so you want me to what
spy on javi
bingo
yeah im not doing that
you have a daughter
about her age right
this came in yesterday
how do you think
you would feel huh
knowing you could have helped
but you chose not to
be a lot of guilt to
carry wouldnt it
because every time
you look at your daughter
believe me
you are gonna
see that little girl
buried in a ditch somewhere
and that will haunt you
for the rest of your life
all right here we go nick
were going to create
a power blip big enough
to reboot all the
security cameras
once that happens
you got exactly four
minutes and ten seconds
to get in and get out before
they come back online
dont forget set the cameras
and then grab them
when you leave
uhoh oh shit we
got a guy coming
nick guard on the way
all right nick stay calm
just like we talked about
take the incapacitating
agent out of the pouch
put it in your hand
remove the outer layer
the inner layer has
the chemical on it
now if you touch
that to someones skin
theyll be out in seconds
now find a place to hide
theres nowhere to hide in here
hold on
i think i can hide under the
i touched my forehead

i think so im not 100 sure
did you or didnt you
you know what
i dont think i did

nick listen to me right now
you have 30 seconds until
youre drooling on the floor

key that we gave you

oh my god
yes
how is he up trained actor
all right man we in
you know it didnt feel
great betraying javi like that
especially since im still
not convinced hes your guy
but the strange thing is
i can see myself
doing more of this stuff
you know spy craft
subterfuge what have you
i think i might
have a real gift for it
good cause we got
another mission for you
no no no fuck that
it was terrifying
im about to leave for the
airport after the party so
nick our intel suggests that
javi is holding maria delgado
on the compound right now
on the compound yeah
we need you to help us find her
which means we need you
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer
vivian i cant do this
yes you can we
just saw you do it
that little girl nick
she doesnt have anybody else
just you
and if you leave
i dont know whats
gonna happen to her
i just want to thank you
all for coming tonight
it means more to me
than you can know
and i would like
to tell a story
a few years ago
my relationship with my father
had deteriorated to the point
where we were
no longer speaking
he could be extremely difficult
my father
and to be fair maybe
i am not much better
but when he got sick
i realized
i didnt want to lose him
before we could repair
our broken relationship
but i didnt know how
and then one day
about a week before
he died it happened
a miracle
i looked up
and i saw on a tiny
little hospital tv
guarding tess
we disagreed about literally
everything my father and i
except for this movie
we both loved it
we would quote
it back and forth
in a way my father was tess
the former first lady
and i was doug chesnic
the secret service agent
charged with taking care of him
that movie brought us together
so on behalf of my
late father and myself
i want to thank you
i bet you didnt know
doug chesnic could have
such an impact on someone
well doug was
a complicated guy
he had um
competing allegiances
and sometimes
being in the skin of
a character like that
can take its toll
well thank you
for your sacrifice
it was extraordinary
thank you for having me
and im
im
excited to announce that
javi has finally allowed
me to read his screenplay
which is fantastic
its truly a masterclass
its easily one of the best
things ive read in years
so does that mean
that you want to be in it
i dont
but what i would like is to
spend a little more time here
on the compound with you
coming up with our own
movie
what do you say
i say yes
yes
i fired earl
this has happened twice now
no
he is a driver
in the employ of
the secret service
i cant do anything about
the cook or the nurse
no they work for you
but this guy works
for us and hes gone
nick
the security cameras gave
us a probable location for maria
im sending it to you now
find a way to get
into that room nick
mr cage
oh hey javi nick
i realized
that if we are going
to create a work of art
we cant just sit and
stare at a screen
we have to open our minds
to the infinite possibilities
of what the cosmos has to offer
what have you got there
divine inspiration
fuck it
so i was thinking
that maybe our movie
would be characterdriven
yeah
something that doesnt
rely on corny special effects
right or like big explosions
it has to be nuanced
and work on multiple levels
it should be completely
about performance
and maybe its just
the drugs talking
but what if we had
like a big drug scene
oh wow
its gonna be so fucking good
but like
whats it about
in terms of
genre i like comedies
but not when its just two
people sitting around talking
oh man i cant
stand talkie comedies
you gotta have some
plot to drive it forward
its my daughter
oh
nick listen
you know what i was thinking
maybe we could have like
a paranoid thrillery angle
ooh paranoid angle excellent
like see those
two guys over there
theyve been watching us
right right
wait have they
been watching us
i dont know have they
fuck
did you see that they
just looked over at us
oh shit

no no no maybe it
was just a coincidence
i will look again
are you ready
no dont make eye contact
thats how you spook them
no thats how you spook a bear
thats right that is
how you spook a bear
i apologize
but if you are gonna look
maybe do like a fake laugh
a fake laugh okay good yeah

lets just get up slowly
on the count of three
and run

goodbye nicolas cage
ill never forget you javs
ill never forget you
now you get the
hell out of here

mr cage
javi
buddy hey
whered you come from
oh
yeah
turns out we could
have just walked around
yeah i guess so huh whatever
there they are
oh shit oh shit run
do you see em
oh fuck oh
shit
ow ow
no no i cant drive on
acid i cant drive on acid
you have to drive on acid
you are a better driver than me
how do you know that
because i read that you did
all of your own driving stunts
in gone in 60 seconds
well thats true i popped
some good wheelies right
the wheelies are
amazing now drive the car
theyre coming lets go
oh holy shit what
holy shit
what do you see em
no nick i have an idea
maybe this movie
maybe its about this
about us
our relationship
thats good
thats good
is anyone in there
hola
hello
hello
you want me to let
you in there huh
i do
i wanna know whats inside
regardless of what
the consequences are
because once you go in there
it could change the
way you feel about me
our entire relationship
could change nick cage
i need to go in jav
open the door
is it too much
trippy
trippy
i know i am
sorry if it is weird
well its a good collection
its very thorough
a really elegant string
of pearls configuration
the rock
put the bunny back in the box
con air
well thats just really creepy
no its not creepy
oh
is that the chainsaw from mandy
mandy is a masterpiece
you know those
are real guns right
of course they are real
custom springfield armory
made specifically for the film
is this supposed to be me
its
grotesque
just look at the guns
if you dont mind me asking
how much did you pay for this
disturbing statue
hmm about 6000
ill give you 20000 for it
im sorry mr cage
but this is not for sale
bad news girls not there
good news scripts cooking
feels like cassavetes
meets inarritu
with a dash of von trier
nick but i know
what youre gonna say
javi has his issues but my god
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story
he kidnapped a young girl
and every day that passes
the likelihood goes up
that shes gonna be murdered
by javi or one of his men
what do you want me to do now
i dont know
im still figuring that out
but for now why dont you
add a plotline to your movie
where someone gets kidnapped
that way you can see
where he might
theoretically hide a hostage
im working two jobs here
okay
vivian
this is a grounded adult drama
about two tough sensitive men
and their unlikely friendship
theyre kind of like
dueling christ figures
which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself
but what is not
a revolutionary
idea is a kidnapping
and if i bring
that into the mix
javis gonna know
somethings up
hes a hardliner for tone
and this mission
will be blown okay
jesus fucking christ
you know nick
i think a kidnapping
could give this
movie a wider appeal
i mean its pretty hard
to find an audience
these days right
unless youre a marvel movie
star wars whatever yeah
yeah doesnt
sound like this is that
no vivian it isnt
this is an intelligent
film for grownups
now personally
i want a smart
characterdriven adult drama
about real life real people
but the reality is
most people need a bit of a hook
to get em into the theater
okay now youre
talking about marketing
and if youre talking
about marketing
then yes you do need a
hook to get them into the theater
well get em into
the theater come on
all you need is
a trailer moment
pull
hold on hold on your
daughter gets kidnapped
yeah its a big trailer moment
hey am i doing this right
cause i had that
thing in my sights
but who kidnaps her
uh maybe the barrels warped
the barrel is
definitely not warped
who kidnaps her
bad guys
we both put our lives
on the line to save the daughter
and become better men for it
its classic
it feels like a completely
different movie
javi please
just walk down the
road with me on this
and then what
the finale is about
two men saving the girl
thats terrible
give me the gun
you know the key
to shooting well
controlling your breath
and you know how to
control your breath nick
your heart
your heart must be still
at peace
my heart
is not still
my heart
is not at peace
do you know why
hey javi
if youre not gonna shoot
maybe hand me the gun
because youre lying to me
what
dont fucking lie to me
im not
dont fucking lie to me
oh my god im not i swear
i know why you keep on
talking about this kidnapped girl
you feel guilty about
your relationship
to your own daughter
oh my god yes
a thousand times
yes you are blocked
creatively
because you feel guilty
about what kind of
father you have been
youre right yep
youre 100 right
pull
vivian whats going on
nick you need to get out
of that house immediately
the agency caught a
wiretap on our phones
then i picked up
a guy tailing me
if theyve made me
theyve likely made you
all right shit
nick we can no longer
guarantee your safety
jesus christ
you scared the hell out of me
nick
i need you to come with me
right now
im sorry to have to
take this step nick
you dont
though you really dont
no it is the only option
can i just call
my family quickly
tell them i love them
what
theres no need to call them
they are here
dad nick
are you okay what
what the hell is going on
your friend called to say
you were so sick
you couldnt talk
were worried about you yeah
you wanna deal with me
javi you deal with me
but im begging you please
please leave my
family out of this
unfortunately i cant do that
youve left me no choice
are you dying dad yes
oh my god what
creatively oh come on
no physically
he is tremendous
i mean he will
probably outlive us all
so youre not even sick
im okay honey
im fine im okay fuck you
look i have grown to care
very deeply about your father
and exhusband
we are working
on a movie together
a beautiful
characterdriven adult drama
but he has so many
unresolved issues with you
that it is beginning
to bleed into the work
in a negative way
isnt that right nick
are you both out of
your fucking minds
well you see he
has so many regrets
yeah well here is
another one to add to the list
weve been on a plane
all day
i had to cancel clients
we were panicking
because we couldnt find
anyone to feed the cats
you know they could be dead
by the time we get
home after this bullshit
house smelling like a
dead cat thats great
thats fun
well i had a cat die
in the kitchen once
and my grandmother
was never able
to get rid of the smell
i am very sorry for
the inconvenience
but this is an emergency
have lunch with us
and let him say
what he has to say
dont you think thats
a good idea nick
lunch is a wonderful idea javi
and then afterwards
they can go home right
great
lets have some fucking tapas
this is so weird
yeah well thats
whatd you expect
i wanna apologize
to both of you
i think i should have
been more present
while i was at home
i didnt always need to
be focused on my work
my face in a script
but heres what i
keep coming back to
would either of you
have wanted to prevent me
from living my artistic dreams
because i sure know i
wouldnt have wanted that
for either of you
we flew to majorca for that
wow
that was fucking pathetic
god it really was wasnt it
no no no i am
honestly speechless
really because this
shit you get used to it
yeah thats pretty
much par for the course
mmmhmm
cant we just focus
on the good times
we did have together
addy that trip we
took across the desert
i never showed you this before
but i keep this little
photo in my wallet
to remind me of
all the fun we had
and uh
i know it wasnt great
but that song
i meant that moment
that i wrote in that song
i meant it
you didnt write it
you got drunk
and you made it up
because you couldnt stand
not being the
center of attention
for two fucking seconds
addy
because everything
always has to be about you
what you like
what books youve read
what movies youre into
its fucked up you know
like im your daughter
and i get nervous
like debilitating
fucking anxiety
that if i dont
like what you like
you wont like me
addy i was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me
that were important to me
no you werent you werent
you were trying to mold me
into this little version of you
mold you
guide you addy i love you
i love you more than
anything in the world
and i want you to
know i was trying
i know i know you were trying
youre always trying
fuck thats actually
the saddest part
shit
i think we have more work
than i realized but this is good
this is very good
this is a good first step
sorry to interrupt
mr gutierrez
but you have a visitor
gracias
oh hollywood javi there he is
i have some news for you
javi ford coppola
sit
eat with me
froot loops
delicious
taste it
i love froot loops
sergio baldassari huh
hmm
yeah
but i cant do a
deal with the italians
if i am being betrayed
he flew my wife and daughter
all the way out to majorca
my family
shit
no dont say shit
you got us into this
you get us out of this
theres no way
we can mobilize
an extraction in time
then what am i supposed to do
if you can get javi alone
and then take him out
itll buy the agency time
to get you all out of there
do you have access to a firearm
i might
nick im sorry
but this is the best way
to safeguard your family
listen i need you
to be honest with me
what the fuck is happening
okay
im going to tell you something
but please dont freak out
im working for the cia
are you having a
nervous breakdown
probably but im
telling you the truth
they wanted some information
on javis business dealings
so ive been helping them
and the strange thing is
it does kind of make sense
given that so much
of acting is like spying
do you have any
idea how this sounds
cause i mean its
not its not good
okay i need an hour to
do one final thing for them
and when i get back
the three of us will fly to
los angeles together okay
i dont know what to say
dont say anything just
take addy back to my room
dont talk to anyone
dont go anywhere
ill be back to get
you i promise
i love you
your friend nicolas cage
the fucking star of hollywood
is working for the
us government
oh bullshit
bullshit
bullshit
bullshit
listen
i see myself doing more
of this stuff you
know spy craft
subterfuge what have you
i think i might
have a real gift for it
good cause we
got another mission for you
no
lucas no
lucas
no no no no
i would love to
believe you primo
but either i kill you
or you kill nicolas cage
your choice
hi
hey
im sorry
i should have asked you
before bringing them down
yeah
and i was thinking
maybe a kidnapping would work
our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece
and then slowly change
into a more thrilling
hollywood blockbuster
then theres
something for everyone
would you like to
drive out to the cliffs
clear our heads and
think through the third act
perfect
so
we should go
yeah
are those new shoes
these
no ive had these
oh
i havent seen them before
i dont wear them very much
i dont think theyre really me
what
theyre great they
look incredible on you
theyre totally you love em
do you wanna try them on
i think they would
look amazing on you
oh wow
those look incredible on you
i like how those
look on you yeah
you wanna trade
like permanently
okay
cool
im really glad i
got to meet you
youre the kind
of friend i could
not see for years and
not even really talk to
and just pick up
right where we left off
i totally agree
its just
easy
well
i guess its time to figure out
how this thing ends
nick
i meant what i said back there
me too
which is why this really hurts
javi
you brought me out
here to kill me man
im sorry nick
so am i
cause you pull that
trigger and were both dead
wait you were gonna kill me
and are those my golden guns
theyre my golden guns
and it looks like we both
had a little secret doesnt it
why the fuck would you kill me
youre the head of a
criminal organization
my cousin lucas is the
head of the organization
cia said you ran it
the whole world thinks i run it
when my father
died lucas took over
he forced me to
be the figurehead
you take his money
you dont just leave
this world nick
you and everyone you care
about is in constant danger
why do you think i
cannot be with gabriela
you youre into gabriela
are you fucking kidding me
i cant be with gabriella
because that would
put a target on her back
wait you seriously
didnt realize
that we liked each other
youre in the cia
im not in the cia
im a goddamn
actor you know that
the only organization
im a part of
is the screen actors
guild of america
and aftra but i dont
even know what that is
i think its a radio thing
just put down the gun
no way you go first
im not going first you
brought my family out here
this is so fucked i
dont wanna kill you
youre the last
person i wanna kill
i fucking love you i love you
its my cousin
he must have known
i wouldnt kill you
i thought so
which is why i
should always trust
my shamanic
instincts as a thespian
fuck
faster im trying
your shoes dont
offer any ankle support
ah fuck
okay you just run out
there you get the truck
you come back and get
me i will keep a lookout
uhhuh love it love the plan
but given that youve saddled me
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers
maybe you should
go and ill stay here
i love that plan i do
but you are a faster
runner than me
even with subpar footwear
i saw how fast you were
in national treasure
no thatd be the
stunt department
not according to the
making of featurette
fine ill go wait

vivian hello
nick ive sent you the address

to put pressure on
the us government
so theyll back off their
support of delgado
and unless delgado
drops out of the election
nick im sorry

gonna kill both girls
what what what
youre gonna get
him to drop out right
youre gonna get
him to drop out

youll end up dead like her
leave it to the professionals
local police whomever
there is no one else
i love you

you need to know
who you are nick
this isnt a role
youre not a hero

i bought this house 20 years ago
for a situation just like this
it has everything we
need food passports
materials for disguise
well be safe for the night
olivia
i promise you will get
your daughter back
the girls are likely being held
in my cousins compound
it is a monastery that
they use as a cover
but it is a fortress
it is impenetrable there
are walls on every side
any escape routes
tunnels but with metal doors
that only open from the inside
even if it werent for
all of the armed guards
it is impossible to get in
i mean this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter
in 12 hours
so what the fuck
are we gonna do
we are going to walk straight
in through the front gate
okay cool very
dramatic answer
hows that supposed to work
lucas is trying
to form an alliance
with sergio baldassari
the head of the
calabero crime family
baldassari i mean no one
has seen him for 15 years
exactly and since
no one has seen him
no one knows exactly
what he looks like
olivia
nick says that you
were an incredible
makeup artist when you met

lucas gutierrez

to the 17 healthy muscles
that operate
my trigger finger
