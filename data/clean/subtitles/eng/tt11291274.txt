you take your
daddy s present now 
whoa 
i got a picture of you  too 
maria 
no  no  no  no 
happy birthday  darlin  
no 
whoa 
thank you 
obviously  you ve seen
mankiewicz s house of strangers 
it s one of my all time
favorite movies 
that s exactly what your
script reminded me of 
the power struggle 
the fight for
relevance  yeah  yeah 
and you re gonna think
this sounds a little crazy 
but in some ways 
it s king lear 
it s king lear  yeah  exactly 
see  i knew you d understand
what i m trying
to do with this film 
right 
david  i don t know
what to say exactly 
except this is the
role of a lifetime
and i d really love
to be a part of this 
cool  man  i ll just give you
a shout in a couple of days 
oh  if you re worried
about the boston accent 
i can do the boston accent 
i ve been working
on it all week 
i m not worried  nick 
okay  well  if you have
any other questions
or you just wanna
talk  give me a call 
or if you d like me
to  uh    to read   
you don t need to read for me 
of course not 
and obviously  i m not going to 
obviously 
but i bet a part of you would
love to hear me read  right 
i mean  why wouldn t you 
if i were you  i d
want to hear it 
seriously  i don t
want you to read  okay 
anyway  this is
me  so i m gonna   
well  you know
what  i m gonna read 
 it s a foregone
conclusion  jimmy  
 it takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain 
 to send a message to the body  
 so  by the time your bullets
hit me  my cerebral cortex 
 will have transmitted a signal 
 to the 17 healthy muscles 
 that operate
my trigger finger  
 and before your asshole
has had a chance to pucker up  
 your medulla oblongata 
 will be splattered on a
fucking wall behind ya  
 and if that s the last
thing i accomplish 
 on this beautiful green earth  
 well  then  ha  i say  ha 
what a way to fucking go  
holy shit 
i can do another if you want 
damn  man 
that was good  right  felt good 
mankiewicz 
whoo hoo  incredible pull 
i know  it just
popped into my head 
well  good  i m happy for you 
because  honestly 
man  you really need this 
what  what is that
supposed to mean 
you get it  this could
be a game changer 
i don t need a game changer 
if it happens  it happens 
if it doesn t  i ll just keep
working  that s what i do 
i m just saying  you could
be a little more strategic 
make more movie star choices 
it s like miles davis told me   
 sometimes  it s the notes 
 you don t play  
miles davis was a heroin addict 
i mean  i love him 
he was a maestro 
but i m happy 
i m healthy when i m
working  i m an actor 
no  you re a fucking movie star 
and don t you ever forget that 
okay  i don t need
this  i don t need this 
get out of my car 
nicky  get out of my car 
i don t need this 
i need this 
this could be a game changer 
so  you re not happy with
how your career is going
because you seem to
be working all the time 
well  i never viewed it
as a career  only as work 
and what s wrong with that 
i mean  in any other job 
hard work is
something to behold 
but with film performance 
 you re making too
many movies  nick  
 you re working too hard  nick  
 have the audience
miss you more  nick  
i mean   hello  it s my job  
 i pay my bills  
 i feed my family 
you re annoying  
my gosh 
yeah 
so  what s the worry here  nick 
you ve lost some
of your ability 
your talent as an actor 
no 
uh   
no  it s just that
i really want this 
this is the role of a lifetime 
it s a great part 
well  how do you think your
relationship with your work
affects your relationship
with your daughter 
let s bring addy
into this  shall we 
what  oh  you
don t have to do that 
you guys can keep talking 
well  i ll just finish with 
a role like this doesn t
come along every day 
and now  i m gonna zip it 
  i zipped it good 
  addy 
how do you think
your dad s anxiety
over his career
has affected you 
well  his career is pretty much
the only thing we talk about 
that or he makes
me watch old movies 
and then discuss them 
which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours 
it s a conversation  it s
more of a conversation 
he made me watch
this bizarre old movie 
what was it called  the
island of dr  calamari 
the cabinet of dr  caligari 
and did you like it  addy 
it s one of my favorite
films  have you seen it 
no  i have not 
it s about this
insane old doctor
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell 
this crazy old loon 
can you imagine how
horrifying that would be 
to be completely
under someone s spell 
and you liked it  right 
i mean  you like the painted
sets  and the makeup   
no  i did not 
sounds to me like
maybe she didn t
want to see the movie 
did you think about that  nick 
about what she wants 
cheryl  come on  is
that a real question 
what do you think
he s gonna say 
she has an amazing visual
sensibility  always has 
we re very close  and
within that closeness 
i was able to ascertain   
hey  honey  hi  mom 
bye  addy  i love you 
oh  no  what happened 
oh  she s mad at me
because we watched 
cabinet of dr  caligari
together and she hated it 
which i find odd  given how
mature her taste normally is 
wait  you re surprised
your teenage daughter
didn t wanna watch an insane
100 year old
german film with you 
yes  oh  my god  okay 
well  it s not just that 
you know  she s never
read mary shelley 
or jane austen  or even twain 
what a little philistine 
should we disown her 
she thought humphrey
bogart was a porn star 
yeah   
what  really  yeah 
that s disappointing 
unless there is a porn star
called humphrey bogart 
that would work  wouldn t
it  humphrey  hump 
no 
look  you re just   
you re at a tricky
stage right now
with her  okay 
and if you don t
learn to connect 
it s gonna stay broken for   
what the fuck are
you smiling at  huh 
why are you smiling  i m not 
you are  okay

very exciting movie

our first trip together 
we drove overnight 
across the desert 
to the grand canyon 
you remember that  sweetheart 
i do remember that 
and when the sun came up 
i pulled over to
the side of the road
as she rested her little
head on my shoulder
and we just watched   
watched the sun come up 
that was the happiest
moment of my life 
and in that moment 
i composed a little tune
for her 16th birthday 
i ve been working
on it ever since 
and  uh  happy birthday 
sweetheart  here goes 
oh  fucking jesus 
i m so excited to see what
you do with your life  honey

talent goes unappreciated

when the three of us
used to lie on the
living room floor
in the new york apartment

i need you to get
your shit together  nick

yeah

of human traditions 
storytelling and mythmaking 
ah  fuck  man  i m sorry

but fuck lisbon 
that wasn t my fault 
and by the way

i see croods 2 
i m picking you up 
yeah  fink  can you hold on 
excuse me  it s los angeles
calling  i need to take this 
just two minutes  of course 
can you hold one second 
i m getting on a boat 
thank you  yeah 
i mean  what do we know
about this guy anyway 
is he a spanish dr  no  is
he into something strange 
allan did some
research  hold on 
allan  what does this guy do 
he owns olive groves apparently 
also  he wrote this screenplay 
and he wants nick to star in it 
throw that in the fucking trash 
nick  you re fine 
it s not like he s gonna
want you to suck his dick
or fuck his wife 
or watch you watch
him fuck his wife 
i wouldn t think so  relax 
have fun and give me
a call when it s done 
you can tell me all about it 
nice place 
maybe i ought to get
into the olive business 
mr  cage  i    yeah 
excuse me  real quick 
the guy that owns this
house  what s his name 
javi  yeah  javi 
is javi going to want
me to  uh  you know   
i m not sure i understand 
look  if javi wants me to
suck his dick  or fuck his wife 
or watch me watch
him fuck his wife 
that s a no go  you
understand  it s no bueno 
i think so  okay  and if javi   
i am javi 
nick cage 
so  how was it 
it was fine 
normal  no big deal 
come on  tell me
the truth  okay  okay 
he was incredible  was he 
but also  like  super cool 
he was a little taller
than i had imagined
because you know they
say actors are pretty short 
so  was he short 
no  no 
he was   
just right 
okay  but did he say anything
about your screenplay 
no  he didn t bring it
up  i didn t bring it up 
it wasn t the right time 
just think about
how would it feel
to say in front of
everyone at the party
that nicolas cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote 
i don t know  gabriela 
maybe i am living
in a fantasy world 
i mean  look who
we re talking about here 
the man is a legend 
hi 
hey 
cheers 
huh 
what 
oh  no  i m sorry 
i thought that   
did you say    no  i did   
oh  never mind 
yeah  so along those same
lines  i was wondering   
and it s totally
okay if you haven t 
but i was just wondering
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay 
javi 
can i come or it s only for vip 
uh  mr  cage  this is
ms  gabriela lucchesi  hi 
she runs all of our
agricultural operations 
and this is my cousin 
lucas gutierrez 
mr  cage  we obviously are
very excited to have you here 
what are you working on next 
well  that s a tough question
for an actor to
get  but it s fine 
oh   cause
i m no longer an actor 
i ve retired 
what  what do you mean  retired 
so  what are you
going to do now 
live the life of a house cat 
because it s just
a matter of time
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice
and we retreat to the
black pit of nothingness
from whence we came 
so  tell us about
making the rock 
bet you wish you
were still making movies
like that  huh  mr  cage 
must have been nice
to have been a star 
and now   
mr  cage  wake up 
jesus christ 
so  mr  gutierrez has been
waiting all day
for you to get up 
he really wants to show you
one of his favorite
places of all spain 
it s called the cliffs
of cap de for mentor 
yeah  see  well 
i m very jet lagged 
so i won t be
attending that  okay 
thank you 
oh  my god  mr  cage 
if mr  gutierrez is asking you
to go with him
and see the cliffs 
you re gonna go with
him and see the cliffs 
and you re gonna
love the cliffs 
even if you hate the cliffs 
are we clear 
gabriela said you are
really excited about the cliffs 
yeah  very much so  it s just   
i m not feeling
tip top right now 
so if you wanna
go out there alone 
i could go back to
the room    oh  shit 
shit  what 
we must go now 
hey 
javi 
javi 
what is going on 
faster 
what are we running from 
the general 
javi 
hey 
you need to tell me right
now what the hell is going on 
or i m getting my shit 
and i m going back
to los angeles 
the general 
the general forbade me
to see his daughter matilda 
but we defied his orders 
and now  he
wants to end my life 
can t you see him 
all right  all right  i get it 
you re making this up 
what is this 
like a little stanislavski
improv thing 
well  you can stop 
stanislavski  is he
part of the resistance 
stop  i am your guest 
gabriela ripped the
bedspread off me this morning 
now you re sending me
on  like  a wild goose chase 
i m sorry  but you can t
quit acting  you can t 
that s none of your business 
whether you like it
or not  you have a gift 
and that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly
dark and broken world 
and to turn your
back on that gift
is to turn your back on
the entire human race 
the human race 
i m afraid so 
what am i gonna do 
oh  wow  if we don t go now 
they will fucking kill us 
these people smell blood
and they come running 
what am i gonna do 
they re almost to
the edge of the forest 
i can hear them 
and matilda  she is
waiting down the coast 
we have to go now 
we have to jump 
you re in an
untenable situation 
you know that  right 
so tell me one thing 
do you love her 
i ve always loved her 
then let s get you
out of here alive 
oh  shit 
fuck 
oh  god 
i didn t know there was a cliff 
i didn t know it was that high 
we could have died 
you re a wild man 
i prefer bourbon  but thank you 
god  this place is stunning 
i bet my daughter
would like it out here 
it d be good for her 
are you two close 
well  it s impossible to
be close with a 16 year old 
but i ve tried to be
there for her  it s just   
there s no script for parenting 
thank god for my ex  olivia 
how did you meet olivia 
she was a make up artist
on captain corelli s mandolin 
beautiful film  thank you 
underrated for sure 
we just hit it off  you know 
she was funny  smart  beautiful 
so  what happened 
what happened 
what about you  ever
been married  kids 
no 
there is one woman  but  uh 
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love
and that s just the way it is 
anyway  mr  cage 
what is your favorite movie 
oh    favorite movie 
oh  wow  i mean 
that    that is  uh   
that s one of those questions
that s impossible to answer 
because  you see 
100 plus years of rich cinema 
you can t just limit it to one 
it depends upon your
mood  the seasons 
all right  let s do
top three  you start 
number one  face off 
oh  thank you 
woo is a maestro  thank you 
number two  let me think   
the cabinet of dr  caligari 
you love
caligari  i love caligari 
wow  i was beginning to
think i was the only one 
you gonna run
the table here  jav 
it s hard  it s like you said 
100 plus years of rich cinema 
thank you 
look  can you just stop stalling
and answer the question 
what is your third
favorite movie of all time 
paddington 2 
what 
cabinet of dr  caligari 
paddington 2 
connect those dots 
i mean  i don t wanna
be a snob  but   
i cried through
the entire thing 
it made me want
to be a better man 
bullshit  man 
paddington 2 is incredible 
i fucking told you 
truth or dare  nick 
truth 
did you hate my
screenplay  it s okay if you did 
i just need to know 
you wrote a script 
i sent it to your agent 
he was supposed
to give it to you 
well  he didn t 
i guess i can
understand why he didn t 
but where is it 
i ll read it right now 
now  like  right now  right now 
send it 
i sent it  fantastic 
let s go into town 
have a celebratory drink 
you can watch me read it 
see where it
drags  it ll be fun 
no 
honestly  i m too nervous 
my heart is beating so fast 
i think i need to go to bed 
listen  javi  truth 
i wasn t that thrilled
about coming out here 
but tonight has
been the most fun
i ve had in a long  long time 
so  thank you 
oh  hey  nicky 
so  you re unretired then 
that s the idea 
javi inspired you  did
he  you like this guy 
he has good taste in movies 
plus  it could be
good for me to do
some smaller roles
with great directors 
some challenging character work 
huh  so  like  um    like what 
the gay uncle
in the next duplass
brothers movie kind of thing 
exactly 
what the fuck are
you talking about 
we haven t worked
since you were 15   
forty one years to
be number seven
on a call sheet of a
goddamn student film 
i think it s a good idea 
you listen to me 
you re nick fucking   
cage 
addy doesn t need a
struggling artist for a father 
she needs you to be a star 
now you get the next
one  baby  and we re back 
not that we went anywhere 
not that we went anywhere 
come here 
yeah  nick cage smooches good 
you tell  em  nick
cage smooches good 
i ll have another one 
jesus 
what do you guys
want  you want money 
here  take my watch 
it s not a copy  it s real 
mr  cage  we re with the u s 
government  we need your help 
the man you re
staying with is the head
of a violent
international arms cartel 
wait  wait  wait  javi 
he s a ruthless motherfucker 
he started small  coastal spain 
but then  he got greedy 
trying to expand his
operations east  west 
trail of dead
bodies in his wake 
javi gutierrez 
yes  javi 
i don t think we re talking
about the same javi 
we re definitely talking
about the same fucking javi 
it s the same fucking guy  man 
okay  okay  so  you re cia 
some kind of
intelligence  right 
and your job is to
read people  yeah 
well  as a thespian 
that is also my job 
to understand
people s characters 
to feel what they re feeling 
which is how i know that
javi is not a gun dealer 
you re saying
your acting ability
trumps five years of hard data
collected by the world s
finest intelligence agency 
my nouveau
shamanic acting ability 
you better fucking believe it 
oh  hey  guys  this sucks 
uh  nicolas cage s nouveau
shamanic acting ability
has determined that
we got the wrong guy 
so  let s pack up our
shit and fucking go home 
hey  man  don t mind him 
he s all messed up inside 
he just found out his
wife s been fucking his dad 
that s not all the way true 
look  do you
recognize this girl 
no 
it s maria delgado 
president of
catalonia s daughter 
javi s men kidnapped
her two days ago
to force her father
out of the election
and make way for
someone more cartel friendly 
yeah  the u s 
doesn t like that 
yeah  look  hey 
we need to access
javi s security cameras 
we can t get anywhere
near that compound
because it s too fortified 
and then  you show up 
so  you want me to  what 
spy on javi 
bingo 
yeah  i m not doing that 
you have a daughter
about her age  right 
this came in yesterday 
how do you think
you would feel  huh 
knowing you could have helped 
but you chose not to 
be a lot of guilt to
carry  wouldn t it 
because every time
you look at your daughter 
believe me 
you are gonna
see that little girl
buried in a ditch somewhere 
and that will haunt you
for the rest of your life 
all right  here we go  nick 
we re going to create
a power blip big enough
to reboot all the
security cameras 
once that happens 
you got exactly four
minutes and ten seconds
to get in and get out before
they come back online 
don t forget  set the cameras 
and then grab them
when you leave 
uh oh  oh  shit  we
got a guy coming

action 
oh  my god 
yes 
how is he up  trained actor 
all right  man  we in 
you know  it didn t feel
great betraying javi like that 
especially  since i m still
not convinced he s your guy 
but the strange thing is   
i can see myself
doing more of this stuff 
you know  spy craft 
subterfuge  what have you 
i think i might
have a real gift for it 
good   cause we got
another mission for you 
no  no  no  fuck that 
it was terrifying 
i m about to leave for the
airport after the party  so   
nick  our intel suggests that
javi is holding maria delgado
on the compound right now 
on the compound  yeah 
we need you to help us find her 
which means we need you
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer 
vivian  i can t do this 
yes  you can  we
just saw you do it 
that little girl  nick 
she doesn t have anybody else 
just you 
and if you leave 
i don t know what s
gonna happen to her 
i just want to thank you
all for coming tonight 
it means more to me
than you can know 
and i would like
to tell a story 
a few years ago 
my relationship with my father
had deteriorated to the point
where we were
no longer speaking 
he could be extremely difficult 
my father 
and to be fair  maybe
i am not much better 
but when he got sick 
i realized
i didn t want to lose him
before we could repair
our broken relationship 
but i didn t know how 
and then  one day 
about a week before
he died  it happened 
a miracle 
i looked up   
and i saw on a tiny
little hospital tv   
guarding tess 
we disagreed about literally
everything  my father and i 
except for this movie 
we both loved it 
we would quote
it back and forth 
in a way  my father was tess 
the former first lady 
and i was doug chesnic 
the secret service agent
charged with taking care of him 
that movie brought us together 
so  on behalf of my
late father and myself 
i want to thank you 
i bet you didn t know
doug chesnic could have
such an impact on someone 
well  doug was
a complicated guy 
he had  um 
competing allegiances
and sometimes 
being in the skin of
a character like that
can take its toll 
well  thank you
for your sacrifice 
it was extraordinary 
thank you for having me 
and i m   
i m   
excited to announce that
javi has finally allowed
me to read his screenplay
which is fantastic 
it s truly a masterclass 
it s easily one of the best
things i ve read in years 
so  does that mean
that you want to be in it 
i don t 
but what i would like is to
spend a little more time here
on the compound with you 
coming up with our own   
movie 
what do you say 
i say yes 
yes 
i fired earl 
  this has happened twice now 
  no 
he is a driver
in the employ of
the secret service 
i can t do anything about
the cook or the nurse 
no  they work for you 
but this guy works
for us and he s gone 
nick 
the security cameras gave
us a probable location for maria 
i m sending it to you now 
find a way to get
into that room  nick 
mr  cage 
oh  hey  javi  nick 
i realized
that if we are going
to create a work of art 
we can t just sit and
stare at a screen 
we have to open our minds
to the infinite possibilities
of what the cosmos has to offer 
what have you got there 
divine inspiration 
fuck it 
so  i was thinking
that maybe our movie
would be character driven 
yeah 
something that doesn t
rely on corny special effects 
right  or like big explosions 
it has to be nuanced 
and work on multiple levels 
it should be completely
about performance 
and maybe it s just
the drugs talking 
but what if we had
like a big drug scene 
oh  wow 
it s gonna be so fucking good 
but  like 
what s it about 
in terms of
genre  i like comedies 
but not when it s just two
people sitting around talking 
oh  man  i can t
stand talkie comedies 
you gotta have some
plot to drive it forward 
it s my daughter 
oh 
nick  listen 
you know what i was thinking 
maybe we could have  like 
a paranoid thriller y angle 
ooh  paranoid angle  excellent 
like  see those
two guys over there 
they ve been watching us 
right  right 
wait  have they
been watching us 
i don t know  have they 
fuck 
did you see that  they
just looked over at us 
oh  shit 
oh  shit  what s going on 
no  no  no  maybe it
was just a coincidence 
i will look again 
are you ready 
no  don t make eye contact 
that s how you spook them 
no  that s how you spook a bear 
that s right  that is
how you spook a bear 
i apologize 
but if you are gonna look 
maybe do like a fake laugh 
a fake laugh  okay  good  yeah 
oh  no 
okay  okay  let s   
let s just get up slowly
on the count of three
and run 
okay 
one   
oh  fuck 
go  go  go 
faster 
this is fucking crazy 
oh  shit 
it s too high 
here 
use me as a human stool 
do it 
grab my hand 
grab it 
you re heavier than you look 
i have a very big head 
enormous  an enormous head 
i m not gonna make it  am i 
will you tell gabriela
i will miss her 
you can tell her yourself  no 
it s okay  you
go live a good life 
i m not going
anywhere without you 
now  grab my hand  soldier 
but then  we will both die
and i could never live
with myself after that 
so you let go 
you let go 
goodbye  nicolas cage 
i ll never forget you  javs 
i ll never forget you 
now  you get the
hell out of here 
you go 
mr  cage 
javi 
buddy  hey 
where d you come from 
oh 
yeah   
turns out we could
have just walked around 
yeah  i guess so  huh  whatever 
there they are 
oh  shit  oh  shit  run 
do you see  em 
oh  fuck  oh 
shit 
ow  ow 
no  no  i can t drive on
acid  i can t drive on acid 
you have to drive on acid 
you are a better driver than me 
how do you know that 
because i read that you did
all of your own driving stunts
in gone in 60 seconds 
well  that s true  i popped
some good wheelies  right 
the wheelies are
amazing  now drive the car 
they re coming  let s go 
oh  holy shit  what 
holy shit 
what  do you see  em 
no  nick  i have an idea 
maybe this movie 
maybe it s about this 
about us 
our relationship 
that s good 
that s good 
is anyone in there 
hola 
hello 
hello 
you want me to let
you in there  huh 
i do 
i wanna know what s inside 
regardless of what
the consequences are 
because once you go in there 
it could change the
way you feel about me 
our entire relationship
could change  nick cage 
i need to go in  jav 
open the door 
is it too much 
trippy 
trippy 
i know  i am
sorry if it is weird 
well  it s a good collection 
it s very thorough 
 a really elegant string
of pearls configuration  
the rock 
 put the bunny back in the box  
con air 
well  that s just really creepy 
no  it s not creepy 
oh 
is that the chainsaw from mandy 
mandy is a masterpiece 
you know those
are real guns  right 
of course they are real 
custom springfield armory 
made specifically for the film 
is this supposed to be me 
it s   
grotesque 
just look at the guns 
if you don t mind me asking 
how much did you pay for this
disturbing statue 
hmm  about  6 000 
i ll give you  20 000 for it 
i m sorry  mr  cage 
but this is not for sale 
bad news  girl s not there 
good news  script s cooking 
feels like cassavetes
meets inarritu
with a dash of von trier 
nick  but    i know
what you re gonna say 
javi has his issues but  my god 
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story 
he kidnapped a young girl 
and every day that passes 
the likelihood goes up
that she s gonna be murdered
by javi or one of his men 
what do you want me to do now 
i don t know 
i m still figuring that out 
but for now  why don t you
add a plotline to your movie
where someone gets kidnapped 
that way you can see
where he might 
theoretically  hide a hostage 
i m working two jobs here 
okay 
vivian 
this is a grounded  adult drama
about two tough  sensitive men
and their unlikely friendship 
they re kind of like
dueling christ figures 
which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself 
but what is not
a revolutionary
idea is a kidnapping 
and if i bring
that into the mix 
javi s gonna know
something s up 
he s a hardliner for tone 
and this mission
will be blown  okay 
jesus fucking christ 
you know  nick 
i think a kidnapping
could give this
movie a wider appeal 
i mean  it s pretty hard
to find an audience
these days  right 
unless you re a marvel movie 
star wars  whatever  yeah 
yeah  doesn t
sound like this is that 
no  vivian  it isn t 
this is an intelligent
film for grown ups 
now  personally 
i want a smart 
character driven  adult drama
about real life  real people 
but the reality is 
most people need a bit of a hook
to get  em into the theater 
okay  now you re
talking about marketing 
and if you re talking
about marketing 
then  yes  you do need a
hook to get them into the theater 
well  get  em into
the theater  come on 
all you need is
a trailer moment 
pull 
hold on  hold on  your
daughter gets kidnapped 
yeah  it s a big trailer moment 
hey  am i doing this right 
 cause i had that
thing in my sights 
but who kidnaps her 
uh  maybe the barrel s warped 
the barrel is
definitely not warped 
who kidnaps her 
bad guys 
we both put our lives
on the line to save the daughter
and become better men for it 
it s classic 
it feels like a completely
different movie 
javi  please 
just walk down the
road with me on this 
and then what 
the finale is about
two men saving the girl 
that s terrible 
give me the gun 
you know the key
to shooting well 
controlling your breath 
and you know how to
control your breath  nick 
your heart 
your heart must be still 
at peace 
my heart
is not still 
my heart
is not at peace 
do you know why 
hey  javi 
if you re not gonna shoot 
maybe hand me the gun 
because you re lying to me 
what 
don t fucking lie to me 
i m not 
don t fucking lie to me 
oh  my god  i m not  i swear 
i know why you keep on
talking about this kidnapped girl 
you feel guilty about
your relationship
to your own daughter 
oh  my god  yes 
a thousand times 
yes  you are blocked 
creatively 
because you feel guilty
about what kind of
father you have been 
you re right  yep 
you re 100  right 
pull 
vivian  what s going on 
nick  you need to get out
of that house immediately 
the agency caught a
wiretap on our phones 
then i picked up
a guy tailing me 
if they ve made me 
they ve likely made you 
all right  shit 
nick  we can no longer
guarantee your safety 
jesus christ 
you scared the hell out of me 
nick 
i need you to come with me 
right now 
i m sorry to have to
take this step  nick 
you don t 
though  you really don t 
no  it is the only option 
can i just call
my family quickly 
tell them i love them 
what 
there s no need to call them 
they are here 
dad  nick 
are you okay  what   
what the hell is going on 
your friend called to say
you were so sick
you couldn t talk 
we re worried about you  yeah 
you wanna deal with me 
javi  you deal with me 
but i m begging you  please 
please leave my
family out of this 
unfortunately  i can t do that 
you ve left me no choice 
are you dying  dad  yes 
oh  my god  what 
creatively  oh  come on 
no  physically 
he is tremendous 
i mean  he will
probably outlive us all 
so  you re not even sick 
i m okay  honey 
i m fine  i m okay  fuck you 
look  i have grown to care
very deeply about your father 
and ex husband 
we are working
on a movie together 
a beautiful
character driven  adult drama 
but he has so many
unresolved issues with you
that it is beginning
to bleed into the work
in a negative way 
isn t that right  nick 
are you both out of
your fucking minds 
well  you see  he
has so many regrets 
yeah  well  here is
another one to add to the list 
we ve been on a plane 
all day 
i had to cancel clients 
we were panicking
because we couldn t find
anyone to feed the cats 
you know  they could be dead
by the time we get
home after this bullshit 
house smelling like a
dead cat  that s great 
that s fun 
well  i had a cat die
in the kitchen once 
and my grandmother
was never able
to get rid of the smell 
i am very sorry for
the inconvenience 
but this is an emergency 
have lunch with us 
and let him say
what he has to say 
don t you think that s
a good idea  nick 
lunch is a wonderful idea  javi 
and then  afterwards 
they can go home  right 
great 
let s have some fucking tapas 
this is so weird 
yeah  well    that s   
what d you expect 
i wanna apologize
to both of you 
i think i should have
been more present
while i was at home 
i didn t always need to
be focused on my work 
my face in a script 
but here s what i
keep coming back to 
would either of you
have wanted to prevent me
from living my artistic dreams 
because i sure know i
wouldn t have wanted that
for either of you 
we flew to majorca for that 
wow 
that was fucking pathetic 
god  it really was  wasn t it 
no  no  no  i am
honestly speechless 
really  because this
shit  you get used to it 
yeah  that s pretty
much par for the course 
mmm hmm 
can t we just focus
on the good times
we did have together 
addy  that trip we
took across the desert 
i never showed you this before 
but i keep this little
photo in my wallet
to remind me of
all the fun we had 
and  uh 
i know it wasn t great 
but that song   
i meant that moment
that i wrote in that song 
i meant it 
you didn t write it 
you got drunk
and you made it up 
because you couldn t stand
not being the
center of attention
for two fucking seconds 
addy 
because everything
always has to be about you 
what you like 
what books you ve read 
what movies you re into 
it s fucked up  you know 
like  i m your daughter
and i get nervous 
like  debilitating
fucking anxiety
that if i don t
like what you like 
you won t like me 
addy  i was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me 
that were important to me 
no  you weren t  you weren t 
you were trying to mold me
into this little version of you 
mold you 
guide you  addy  i love you 
i love you more than
anything in the world 
and i want you to
know i was trying 
i know  i know you were trying 
you re always trying 
fuck  that s actually
the saddest part 
shit 
i think we have more work
than i realized  but this is good 
this is very good 
this is a good first step 
sorry to interrupt 
mr  gutierrez 
but you have a visitor 
gracias 
oh  hollywood javi  there he is 
i have some news for you 
javi ford coppola 
sit 
eat with me 
froot loops 
delicious 
taste it 
i love froot loops 
sergio baldassari  huh 
hmm 
yeah 
but i can t do a
deal with the italians
if i am being betrayed 
he flew my wife and daughter
all the way out to majorca 
my family 
shit 
no  don t say  shit  
you got us into this 
you get us out of this 
there s no way
we can mobilize
an extraction in time 
then  what am i supposed to do 
if you can get javi alone 
and then take him out 
it ll buy the agency time
to get you all out of there 
do you have access to a firearm 
i might 
nick  i m sorry 
but this is the best way
to safeguard your family 
listen  i need you
to be honest with me 
what the fuck is happening 
okay 
i m going to tell you something 
but please don t freak out 
i m working for the cia 
are you having a
nervous breakdown 
probably  but i m
telling you the truth 
they wanted some information
on javi s business dealings
so i ve been helping them 
and the strange thing is 
it does kind of make sense
given that so much
of acting is like spying 
do you have any
idea how this sounds 
 cause i mean  it s
not    it s not good 
okay  i need an hour to
do one final thing for them
and when i get back 
the three of us will fly to
los angeles together  okay 
i don t know what to say 
don t say anything  just
take addy back to my room 
don t talk to anyone 
don t go anywhere 
i ll be back to get
you  i promise 
i love you 
your friend  nicolas cage 
the fucking star of hollywood
is working for the
u s  government 
oh  bullshit 
bullshit 
bullshit 
bullshit 
listen 
i see myself doing more
of this stuff  you
know  spy craft 
subterfuge  what have you 
i think i might
have a real gift for it 
good   cause we
got another mission for you 
no 
lucas  no 
lucas 
no  no  no  no 
i would love to
believe you  primo 
but either i kill you 
or you kill nicolas cage 
your choice 
hi 
hey 
i m sorry 
i should have asked you
before bringing them down 
yeah 
and i was thinking
maybe a kidnapping would work 
our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece
and then  slowly change
into a more thrilling   
hollywood blockbuster 
then there s
something for everyone 
would you like to
drive out to the cliffs 
clear our heads  and
think through the third act 
perfect 
so   
we should go 
yeah 
are those new shoes 
these 
no  i ve had these 
oh 
i haven t seen them before 
i don t wear them very much 
i don t think they re really me 
what 
they re great  they
look incredible on you 
they re totally you  love  em 
do you wanna try them on 
i think they would
look amazing on you 
oh  wow 
those look incredible on you 
i like how those
look on you  yeah 
you wanna trade 
like  permanently 
okay 
cool 
i m really glad i
got to meet you 
you re the kind
of friend i could
not see for years  and
not even really talk to
and just pick up
right where we left off 
i totally agree 
it s just   
easy 
well   
i guess it s time to figure out
how this thing ends 
nick   
i meant what i said back there 
me  too 
which is why this really hurts 
javi 
you brought me out
here to kill me  man 
i m sorry  nick 
so am i 
 cause you pull that
trigger and we re both dead 
wait  you were gonna kill me 
and are those my golden guns 
they re my golden guns 
and it looks like we both
had a little secret  doesn t it 
why the fuck would you kill me 
you re the head of a
criminal organization 
my cousin lucas is the
head of the organization 
cia said you ran it 
the whole world thinks i run it 
when my father
died  lucas took over 
he forced me to
be the figurehead 
you take his money 
you don t just leave
this world  nick 
you and everyone you care
about is in constant danger 
why do you think i
cannot be with gabriela 
you    you re into gabriela 
are you fucking kidding me 
i can t be with gabriella 
because that would
put a target on her back 
wait  you seriously
didn t realize
that we liked each other 
you re in the cia 
i m not in the cia 
i m a goddamn
actor  you know that 
the only organization
i m a part of
is the screen actors
guild of america 
and aftra  but i don t
even know what that is 
i think it s a radio thing 
just put down the gun 
no way  you go first 
i m not going first  you
brought my family out here 
this is so fucked  i
don t wanna kill you 
you re the last
person i wanna kill 
i fucking love you  i love you 
it s my cousin 
he must have known
i wouldn t kill you 
i thought so 
which is why i
should always trust
my shamanic
instincts as a thespian 
fuck 
faster  i m trying 
your shoes don t
offer any ankle support 
ah  fuck 
okay  you just run out
there  you get the truck 
you come back and get
me  i will keep a lookout 
uh huh  love it  love the plan 
but given that you ve saddled me
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers
maybe you should
go  and i ll stay here 
i love that plan  i do 
but you are a faster
runner than me 
even with subpar footwear 
i saw how fast you were
in national treasure 
no  that d be the
stunt department

making of featurette

your daughter back 
the girls are likely being held
in my cousin s compound 
it is a monastery that
they use as a cover 
but it is a fortress 
it is impenetrable  there
are walls on every side 
any escape routes 
tunnels  but with metal doors
that only open from the inside 
even if it weren t for
all of the armed guards 
it is impossible to get in 
i mean  this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter
in 12 hours 
so  what the fuck
are we gonna do 
we are going to walk straight
in through the front gate 
okay  cool  very
dramatic answer 
how s that supposed to work 
lucas is trying
to form an alliance
with sergio baldassari 
the head of the
calabero crime family 
baldassari  i mean  no one
has seen him for 15 years 
exactly  and since
no one has seen him
no one knows exactly
what he looks like 
olivia 
nick says that you
were an incredible
makeup artist when you met 
so  with some prosthetics
and a little makeup   
then i could play sergio 
lucas gutierrez 
i d like to introduce
my wife barbara 
why for  she was born in
santa barbara  california

walk in here after 15 years
and kill me

who are you working
for  three seconds 
it s just me  two 
i promise 
you think she can
help you  sergio  hmm 
go ahead 
you kill him  i ll
still make the deal 
but i don t think
you re gonna kill him 
you don t think i ll kill him 
no  i think if you
were gonna kill him 
you would have done it by now 
so  no  i don t
think you ll do it 
although  i am wondering
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me 
okay  barbara

javi is about to die 
as are you 
shit 
anything you d like
to say before you die 
 it takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain 
 to send a message to the body  
 so  by the time
your bullets hit me  
 my cerebral cortex will
be transmittin  a signal 
 to the 17 healthy muscles 
 that operate
my trigger finger  
 and before your asshole
has a chance to pucker up  
 your medulla oblongata
will be splattered 
 all over the fucking
wall behind ya  
 and if that s the last
thing i accomplish 
 on this beautiful green earth
