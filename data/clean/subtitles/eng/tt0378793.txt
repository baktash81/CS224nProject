youre gonna spend the rest of the year
turning that object into art
mr freeman
mmhmm
when i was little i was really scared of clowns and i
dont want to relapse and have to go back into therapy
oh yeah well fear is a
great place to begin art
hey whoa you just chose your
destiny you cant change that
i learned how to draw a tree
in like the second grade
oh really
well you gonna show me

look what i got at the store
you dont like it we can
always get store credit
wheres the sweater
i thought you said it was returnable
no i got it on sale
dont wear it dont wear it its fine
well then whyd you say that it
all that crap you hear on tv about
communication and expressing feelings
is a lie
no one really cares
what you have to say
so heres the plan we join
5 clubs one for every day of the week
but not like latin club cool stuff
what do you want to join hey maybe we
can tutor kids at the elementary school
what about your friends from
last year dont you know nicole
i wonder how long it
would take for anyone to notice
if i just stopped talking
0 body fat
i was into bowling
back in la joya that was fun
but the bowling club here does seem
like it really attracts the right people
hanging back is a very common mistake most ninth
graders make i mean you shouldnt be intimidated
wait are you getting
darker than me hold on
oh man you need a mouthguard
gym should be illegal
its humiliating
hey do you know the martha clan they do all these
cool projects like feeding the homeless and stuff
oh and they dress in different color schemes depending
on the season i mean im not good in fall tones
and i said i can wear beige
instead of orange but you know
oh no sordino
front row
i got my eye on you
were studying american history
for the ninth time in nine years
every year they say were going
to get right up to the present
but we always get stuck in the
industrial revolution
my family
has been in this country
for over 200 years
we built this place
we fought in every war
from the first one to the last one
we paid our taxes
they voted
so tell me why my
son cant get a job
reverse discrimination
he wanted to be a firefighter
went up for the job
but he didnt get it
what im suggesting here is maybe if we
had closed our borders
in 1900 then real americans
would get the jobs they deserve
young lady
um i think that were all foreigners and should
just give the country back to the native americans
now we have a debate dont we
native americans
maybe your son didnt get the
job because he wasnt good enough
or maybe hes lazy or maybe the guy was just better
watch your mouth mister
thats my son youre talking about
you know what thats enough debate
everybody take out your book
mr petrakis please take your seat
if the class is debating than any student
has a right to say whats on his mind
i decide who talks
in here mr petrakis
you opened a debate you cant close it just
because its not going your way
watch me take your seat mr petrakis
the constitution does not recognize different
levels of citizenship based
upon the time spent in the country
as a citizen and a student im
protesting the tone of this lesson
as racist
intolerant and xenophobic
sit your butt in that chair
mr petrakis and watch your mouth
i tried to get this debate going and uh you
people turn it into a race thing
sit down mr petrakis or
youre gonna go down to the principals office
dave petrakis is my new hero

the house
with the chunks of glass in its walls
is a symbol of what
it would reflect sparkle
come on people
the house symbolizes
yes
how do you know its what he meant to say
i mean you could just make all that up
its just a story
this is hawthorne
one of americas greatest novelists
and not that makes any difference
but i wrote my
dissertation on hawthorne

can you help me with something
yeah sure whats up
sordino
mr patrucus
the suffragettes fought for their right to speak
they were attacked arrested
and thrown in jail for daring to do
what they wanted to do
like them melinda is willing to
stand up for what she believes
that no one should be
forced to give speeches
what is this
melinda had to deliver her report
to the class as part of the assignment
she made copies everyone can read
oh no you dont
when i say oral i mean
oral now you sit down
and you read that report
open your mouth sordino

lets start with grades
this isnt what we expect of you melissa
melinda
last year
you were a straight b student
no behavioral
problems a few absences
what you have to say
shes mute shes mute
shes not saying anything
i think that we need to explore
the family dynamics at play
all i know is last year i had a
sweet loving little girl and now shes
flushing her grades down the toilet
what have you folks done to her i play
golf with the school board president
did you know that did you know that
nobody cares who you play golf with
can i just remind everyone
that we need to number one reassure
number two
stay open
and number three
dont judge
how old are you
listen
the suffragettes were all about speaking up
you cant speak up for your rights
and be silent
i thought what you did
was cool
but you cant make a difference
unless you speak up
do you lecture all
your friends like this
only the ones i like
gotta go
wow melinda you look pretty
thanks for understanding
you the sweetest heather
