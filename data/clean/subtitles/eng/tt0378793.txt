no one really cares
what you have to say 
so here s the plan  we join
5 clubs  one for every day of the week 
but not like latin club  cool stuff 
what do you want to join  hey  maybe we
can tutor kids at the elementary school 
what about your friends from
last year  don t you know nicole 
i wonder how long it
would take for anyone to notice
if i just stopped talking 
0  body fat 
i was into bowling
back in la joya  that was fun 
but the bowling club here does seem
like it really attracts the right people 
hanging back is a very common mistake most ninth
graders make  i mean you shouldn t be intimidated 
wait  are you getting
darker than me  hold on 
 oh man  you need a mouthguard 
 gym should be illegal 
it s humiliating 
hey  do you know the martha clan  they do all these
cool projects like feeding the homeless and stuff

oh no  sordino 
front row 
i got my eye on you 
we re studying american history
for the ninth time in nine years 
every year they say we re going
to get right up to the present
but we always get stuck in the
industrial revolution 
my family    
has been in this country    
for over 200 years 
we built this place 
we fought in every war 
from the first one to the last one 
we paid our taxes 
they voted 
so  tell me why my
son can t get a job 
reverse discrimination 
he wanted to be a firefighter 
went up for the job
but he didn t get it 
what i m suggesting here is maybe if we
had closed our borders
in 1900  then real americans
would get the jobs they deserve 
young lady 
um  i think that we re all foreigners  and should
just give the country back to the native americans 
now we have a debate  don t we 
native americans 
maybe your son didn t get the
job because he wasn t good enough 
 or maybe he s lazy    or maybe the guy was just better   
 watch your mouth  mister 
that s my son you re talking about 
you know what  that s enough debate 
everybody take out your book 
mr  petrakis  please take your seat 
if the class is debating  than any student
has a right to say what s on his mind 
i decide who talks
in here  mr  petrakis 
you opened a debate  you can t close it just
because it s not going your way 
 watch me  take your seat  mr  petrakis 
 the constitution does not recognize different
levels of citizenship based
upon the time spent in the country 
as a citizen and a student  i m
protesting the tone of this lesson
as racist 
intolerant  and xenophobic 
sit your butt in that chair 
mr  petrakis  and watch your mouth 
i tried to get this debate going and  uh  you
people turn it into a race thing 
sit down  mr  petrakis  or
you re gonna go down to the principal s office

every word hawthorne wrote  every comma  every  
paragraph break  these were done on purpose 
it is our job to try and
figure out what he s really trying to say 
why couldn t he just say what he meant 
would they pin a scarlet letter on his chest 
 as for straightforward   
 the house    
with the chunks of glass in its walls   
is a symbol of what 
it would reflect  sparkle 
come on  people    
the house symbolizes

how do you know it s what he meant to say 
i mean  you could just make all that up 
it s just a story 
this is hawthorne 
one of america s greatest novelists 
and not that makes any difference   
but i wrote my
dissertation on hawthorne 
fine  but    
i thought we were all supposed to have opinions
here  i mean  it s a good story  especially    
when hester and that guy fall in love 
but i don t really believe in symbolism 
i mean  you can just make all that up 
alright  class 
i want you all to write a 500 word essay   
on symbolism 
and then

before they came along 
women were treated like dogs 
to get credit  you have to
deliver it orally 
tomorrow  at the beginning of class 
 can you help me with something 
 yeah  sure  what s up 
sordino 
 mr  patrucus 
 the suffragettes fought for their right to speak 
they were attacked  arrested
and thrown in jail for daring to do
what they wanted to do 
like them  melinda is willing to
stand up for what she believes 
that no one should be
forced to give speeches 
 what is this 
 melinda had to deliver her report    
to the class as part of the assignment 
she made copies everyone can read 
oh no you don t 
when i say oral  i mean
oral  now you  sit down 
and you  read that report 
open your mouth  sordino 
open your damn mouth 
i am so sick of your attitude 
i forgot the suffragettes
were hauled off to jail 
duh 
well   
oh  for the love of god 
open your mouth  melinda 
 this is childish  honey 
 i don t know why she s doing this to us

 melinda 
last year
you were a straight b student 
no behavioral
problems  a few absences 
what you have to say 
she s mute  she s mute 
she s not saying anything 
i think that we need to explore
the family dynamics at play 
all i know is  last year i had a
sweet  loving little girl  and now she s
flushing her grades down the toilet 
what have you folks done to her  i play
golf with the school board president 
 did you know that  did you know that 
 nobody cares who you play golf with 
can i just remind everyone
that we need to  number one  reassure
number two 
stay open 
and number three 
don t judge 
how old are you 
listen 
the suffragettes were all about speaking up 
you can t speak up for your rights
and be silent 
i thought what you did
was cool    
but you can t make a difference
unless you speak up 
do you lecture all
your friends like this 
only the ones i like 
gotta go 
wow  melinda  you look pretty 
 thanks for understanding 
you the sweetest  heather   
hi  class

that s nice 
you need to visit the mind
of  the great one  
picasso 
picasso 
who saw the truth 
who painted the truth 
and ripped it from the earth   
with two angry hands 
excuse me 
it s  night in venice  
this is the color of
an accountant s soul 
a love rejected 
this    i once    
grew mold on an orange
this color when i was living in boston 
and uh    
these are various memories
of the school board 
see uh  if something s eating at you  you
gotta find a way to use it 
it s kind of
dark in here

a revolutionary is only as
good as his analysis

why s a revolutionary only
as good as his or her analysis

 yeah 
 dad  that is so great 
here s what i learned in bio 
if the seed is planted too deep 
it doesn t warm up in time 
once the plant surfaces  it sprouts
leaves so it can absorb more sun 
if someone picks the flower  the plant grows
another bloom to produce more seeds
