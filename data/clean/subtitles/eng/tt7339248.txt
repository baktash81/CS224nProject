weve just got
the regular type of coffee here
uh two please
ugh
okay
bonjour
you have completed
lesson 25 well done
at this point you should have
a firm grasp of the french language
lets continue
i wish i would have
been able to see that
grant is
without a doubt
the worst boss
on the face of the earth
one of these days im going to
punch him in the goddamn throat
i can promise you that
are you talking about grant
we are
i was thinking we should pull
an office prank on grant you know
put like an air horn
under his chair
so when he sits down
it makes a really loud noise
or set fire to his house
something along those lines
i think maggie
gave birth recently
grants wife maggie
actually i i know she did
i went to the cookout
at his house last weekend
and they were there with their new baby
along with their two other children
it was actually a really nice cookout
quality meats and sides
there was even a raffle for a gift card
to that new restaurant in town
most of the office was there
some of them even wore their swimsuits
so maybe burning down
the house isnt the best
but yeah
yeah sometimes
sometimes here at the office
grant will give me an assignment
such as auditing an expense report
and even though its part of my job
reports and auditing
it can be frustrating
whats that magazine
youre reading
what department are you in
accounting
so youre the one who audits
our expense reports
yeah
get the fuck
out of here
im sorry
i didnt know we were out
do you have a gun
what
no no no no
please dont
oh here here
you can take my wallet
theres 10 plus a gift card
to the new restaurant in town
why are you doing this
there was yet
another mugging last night
this one putting
a 35year old dog owner
in critical condition
the motorcycleriding
assailants are still at large
daddy
theres a doggy in here
in an official statement
police are urging residents
to stay indoors after dark
adding that if you must go outside
you should carry a weapon
such as a gun
or a large knife
you have
only one unheard message
hey casey uh this is grant
your boss from work
just calling to check in on you
see how youre doing
i just want you to know
you can take all the time you need
we can keep you on paid leave
for another week
and then itll just start counting
towards your vacation time
uh but youve got so much of that
built up so i wouldnt be concerned
hey um maybe you could take that trip
to france youre always talking about
i hear the people there are lovely
and the food is supposed to be
no one else
left you a message
im sorry
i cant go out there
this isnt how it was
supposed to be
i was supposed to win
you didnt play by the rules
there never were any rules
can i help you
im interested in buying a gun
are you a hunter
no it would be
for selfdefense
i need something
that can fit into my hand
sounds like
youre after a handgun
how about
something like this
yes this is exactly
what im looking for
i can hold it in my hand
quite easily
ill run the background check
and file the necessary paperwork
yeah is there some sort of
box you can put this in or a bag
sorry theres a waiting period before
you can legally purchase this gun
oh
its so a person who is upset with another person
cant come in here and buy a gun
to shoot that person with
instead they have to wait a little
while before they can do that
do you have any children
no i dont just a dog
good if you did
have children
i would warn you that the risk of
accidental death increases drastically
with a gun in the home
but since you dont have any children
that statistic
is irrelevant to you
you did mention selfdefense though
be cautious
in a violent altercation an armed victim is
much more likely to be shot and killed
than an unarmed victim
suicide is more common
with gun owners too
youre really gonna
love owning a gun
im sure youre right
karate is a language
its a way of communicating
when you were a child
you trained your vocal chords
to manipulate air to make words
and then you learned
how to combine those words together
so that they would
form sentences
and those sentences expressed thoughts
wants needs
every conversation that you had
was honing your skills
and now
after all these years
you are black belts
in speech
so at this point
in your karate training
you are learning how to form words
with your fists and with your feet
youre gonna get to the point
where you dont even have to think about it
ask me a question
what what are your
plans for the weekend
im going to do some grocery shopping
and rent a film
perhaps a comedy to watch
in the comfort of my own
home
did that
answer your question
thats it for today
bow to me
bow to grand master
i hope its
i hope its all right
that i watched
the hardest part of your karate journey is
walking through that door
for the first time
thats where most people fail
what was your name
casey casey
my name is sensei
can anyone take classes
the first lesson is free so why dont you
come in tomorrow and give it a shot
ill try
higher manny
you must attain the proper angle
remember youre punching
his nose up into his brain
the key word is up
okay class line up
were gonna work
on a rear naked strangle
with karate our goal is always
to end a fight with strikes
snapping an opponents arm with a karate chop
that would be one way
or shattering their jaw
with a perfectly placed
spinning wheel kick
would be another
but realistically
when engaged in combat
it is not a matter of if a fight
will end up on the ground
its a matter of when
manny
this is called
taking the back
i am in
the dominant position
he is a mouse
i am a python
i slide my arm around his neck
my elbow under his chin
like a python i slowly begin to
squeeze my mouse
my arm cuts off the carotid arteries
on either side of his neck
starving the brain of oxygenated blood
students what is
rule number eight
tap or take a nap
tap or take a nap
okay lets give
this technique a try
bow to me
bow to grand master
hi there
youre an excellent teacher
usually its the mothers
that bring the children not the fathers
which ones yours
oh im not a parent
im actually a new student
im taking my first class today
youre a new white belt
is that the first belt color
white is before color
you havent earned color yet
that makes sense actually
i think i need to borrow
a uniform for class
i was going to ask sensei
but i didnt see him
and youre lucky
he doesnt see you
youre lucky he doesnt
see some white belt
disrespecting his dojo
and everything hes built
what is the first rule
the board is behind you
whats rule number one
oh
no shoes on the mat
take off your
fucking shoes white belt
you need a gi and you need a belt
is that what youre asking
yes
but say im at an atm
mmm
and as my back is turned
a man grabs my throat from behind
okay may i
of course
in this instance
the first thing you always have to do
is alleviate the pressure on your neck
mmmhmm
your center of gravity
needs to be lower than mine
so drop your hips
like this
exactly
now you can lift me
off my feet with ease
good
see even though i have your back
you are now in the dominant position
i have no control
and i can easily be thrown
this is very effective
yes it is
what if theyre resisting more
show me
i see what you mean
i would probably uh
id probably do
something like that
theres a lot of testosterone
in this dojo
thats a hormone
men produce
women produce it too
but men produce much more
is this your first class
it is
here let me help with that
you gotta start from the front
not the back
mmm
i notice
that your belt is blue
it is um i feel a connection
to the color blue
it suits me
is blue a high rank
blue is one of
the middle colors
the order is white yellow green
blue purple brown black
some schools use different colors
or change the order of the colors
but our academy does it this way
and its definitely the best way
and what do the strips of tape mean
theyre called stripes
stripes
stripes signify advancements
and achievements
what does
the red stripe mean
it means the person has killed
another person in combat
im joking
its for instructors
anna the brown belt
has a red stripe
and she teaches
the childrens class
the only two people here
with red stripes are her and sensei
and what about
the black stripe
sensei only gives those to select students
green belt and up
todays your first day though
i wouldnt worry about stripes
it is wise to respect the past
but foolish to ignore innovation
grand master understood this
he would say
the only moves worth learning
are the ones that work
just cause im a karateka
doesnt mean that i wouldnt teach
a bow and arrow choke
from brazilian jiujitsu
or an inside heel hook
from russian sambo
i would teach a reverse wrist splicer
from mongolian judo if it worked
and if it wasnt something
i just made up
rule number 10
if it works use it
which brings me
to todays lesson
to kick with your fists
and punch with your feet
im kennith whats your name
casey
im glad
you chose karate casey
its an excellent martial art
and will likely change your life
would you like to go first
maybe you should go first
okay
not in the day class
sorry sensei
i forgot where i was
it was an accident
you all right
im really glad
youre here
that punch
got away from me
i apologize
would you like to try
okay uh that was
a good first try
that felt a little more like
a kick than a punch though
it felt like
a kick to me too
your whole life youve known
that a foot can only kick
youve known
that a foot cannot punch
forget everything
that you know
much better
that felt like a punch
a very weak punch
but the most important thing is that
youre learning to punch with your foot
let me show you again
dont think of it as me punching
your body with my foot
think of it as you striking
my foot with your body
that makes perfect sense
wow
you have a wonderful
sense of balance
i wanna sign up
for classes
thats excellent news
im gonna go ahead
and enter you into the system
name casey
davies
thats a very
femininesounding name
age
i turn 36 next month
do you know what that is in months
the system does it in months
four hundred
and thirtytwo minus one
is 431 months old
oh
that sounds old
when you put it that way
why karate
um
this question is
multiplechoice
a health and fitness
b career opportunity
c new years resolution
d selfdefensetraumatic experience
what if
its none of the above
should i read the choices again
no thats okay
a health and fitness
this is the equipment room
this room is off limits you understand
okay
wait here please
this is your belt
do not come to class without your belt
it is yours it is sacred
therell be a 15 charge
to replace a lost belt
hello
hi
may i speak to
ms casey davies please
this is him
im a man
my mistake i thought it was
a womans name
who is this
im calling about yourgun the handgun
wait i remember you now
yes you are a man again apologies
thats all right
it looks like your paperwork is gonna
go through without any complications
tomorrow morning you will be able
to come in and purchase your gun
are you still there
i dont need a gun anymore
youre not having a child
are you
because we sell child safety locks
that work reasonably well
no no child i just
i found something else
dont tell me you bought a knife
knives are good for selfdefense too
but nine times out of 10
a person with a knife
who gets into a fight with a person
with a gun will lose
i didnt buy a knife
well the paperwork is valid
for the next six months
in the meantime i hope you dont
get attacked by anyone with a gun
or even a knife
goodbye
good luck
next go
next go
go
horrible
you do that in a fight
and your opponent would laugh at you
next casey
good
very good
hey casey uh its grant
your boss from from work
so its been two months
since youve been in to the office
how are you
ive extended your leave five weeks past

the inbox is full
please clear your messages
who are all
these new people
todays the promotion
ceremony
everyone comes
to the promotion ceremony
even students who take the night class
the night class
black stripes
the color black represents
night as in night class
i think ill stick
with the day class
now that i think about it
youre much more suited to the day class
me on the other hand
im getting
my stripe today
overheard sensei
talking about it
oh congratulations
thank you
i have
i have definitely earned it
todays a special day
not only is it a day
in which we recognize those of you
who have outgrown
your belt color
it is also
an important anniversary
seven years ago today
grand master was killed
in a tragic hiking accident
where he was shot
in the face with a gun
he was mistaken for a bird
by a hunter carrying a shotgun
type of gun
that fires a cartridge
which scatters 10 to 20 pellets
at its target
unlike our karate
which is clean and precise
this gun was imprecise
and boorish
rule number 11
guns are for the weak
that board isnt
just for children
the rules apply
to all of us
grand master is the only person ever
to wear the rainbow belt
its a belt color that he created
and awarded to himself
it is the highest honor
in all of karate
he achieved this rank
after he challenged and defeated
all three other grand masters in the state
in unarmed combat to the death
he finished each fight
with his signature technique
a technique
only he knew
a technique he never
even taught me
he punched through his opponents heads
with his index finger
he was the greatest man
who ever lived
i do not award belts
my students earn them
and this first belt
goes to someone
who i see
a little of myself in
he has devoted
himself to karate
and he has more than earned the right
to wear the color yellow
casey
the progression from
yellow belt to green belt
is one of great sacrifice
and introspection
it is filled with immeasurable pain
both internal and external
thank you all for coming
to support each other
we are all family here
isnt there something else
what was that
i just wanted to make sure you werent
forgetting something
what would i
be forgetting blue belt
uh i heard there was going to be
another promotion tonight
you heard that
i did
something black
oh
something black
actually youre correct
there is something black
well i was saving it till the very end
for dramatic effect
as i said before
today is a special day
not only because it is
the unfortunate anniversary
of grand master being shot
and killed while on a hike
after being mistaken
for a bird by a hunter
today is the first time
that i get to promote one of
my students to black belt
this student has been with us
from the very beginning
they are unquestioning
their loyalty is unwavering
but most importantly they know
that despite this black belt
they will always
be my student
while i will always
be their teacher
thomas
youre in my spot
brown belt
black is higher than brown
please move over to your left
this concludes
the ceremony
as always be sure to hold on
to your old belts
so that if someone questions
the legitimacy of your rank
you can prove them wrong first
with tangible evidence
and then in combat
missionary
ah that is the best position
i also like when im behind her
and shes on her hands and knees
doggy style
yes doggy style
that position
is also very nice
all this stuffs yellow
paper please
excuse me
did you doording my car
i dont know
i think you did
then why
did you ask me
because i wanted to give you the
benefit of the doubt
okay then no
no what
i dont think i did
but you did though
i say i didnt
but it doesnt work that way
you obviously did i saw you
you cant just tell me
do you have a problem
the part where you slammed your door
into my car i have a problem
with that yes
i know karate
what belt are you
yellow belt
your arms are holding
the grocery bag
youd have to drop the bag
in order to strike me
in the time it would
take you to do that
i would punch you
in the face as hard as i can
so im gonna ask you again
do you have a problem
you didnt slam
your door into my car
so i dont have a problem
no
you karate
impossible
no bad dog
im sorry
fuck
are you sure this board
isnt meant for green belts
here let me try
okay
here try a white
belt board
your kicks and punches
lacked conviction today
maybe i was wrong
maybe you werent ready
to be a yellow belt
no youre not supposed to do that
youre supposed to stand up for yourself
but youre right though i wasnt able
to break a single board today
and that stops you from
being a yellow belt how
if a bears forest catches on fire
the bear is still a bear
even if a boat capsizes
in rough seas
and sinks
to the bottom of the ocean
with no survivors
it is still a boat
you will be a yellow belt
until you die
or until youre a green belt
and youll be a green belt
until youre a blue belt
and so on
i wish i could
wear my belt all the time
i feel lessthan
without it
come with me
i want you to tell me
why youre here
i i told you before
it was my new years resolution
i thought you said
it was health and fitness
thats what i meant
why are you really here
i was mugged
at night
a few months ago
i was beaten severely
by several men
im afraid
im afraid of the dark
im afraid of other men
they intimidate me
i wanna be
what intimidates me
well you came to the right place
youre learning karate
youre a blade
and im sharpening you
but theres a mental
component as well
you mean like
believing in myself
yeah that wont hurt
im talking about
something a little different
whats your favorite
style of music
adult contemporary
no should be metal
do you ever listen to metal
you mean like hard rock
metal is much more
aggressive than hard rock
from now on youll listen to metal
yeah
its the toughest music
there is
what about hobbies
is there anything that you feel
particularly passionate about
other than your newfound
passion for metal
i enjoy france
i mean french things
i havent actually been to france
but im learning the language
and i would like to visit there someday
mmm thats not good
historically the perception
of the french
is that theyre weak and
that they surrender easily
hardly traits that
you want to embrace
russia on the other hand
is considered a tough country
also germany
germany is very strong and capable
my dogs breed is german
excellent german shepherd
a dachshund actually
well regardless germany it is
okay
you must start thinking this way
do you understand
in every facet of life what you eat
how you interact with others
what arouses you everything should be
as masculine as possible
as you know
i teach a night class
this is your invitation
ive never opened this class up
to yellow belts before
but im gonna make
an exception for you
what time is the class
its at night its a night class
i dont think i can
i wont make you do anything
but like the color of the belt
youve earned this stripe
this invitation
it will be yours forever
just because you ignore it
doesnt mean it doesnt exist
come here
not only does this class offer you more
of what i believe youre looking for
but i guarantee you it will help you
become what you fear
casey stop being afraid
the usual chocolate croissant
and an orange juice
no ive got a new usual
coffee hot black with nothing to eat
thats mine
its mine now i take what i want
i only care about myself
hey there casey
listening to music
im learning german
german thats very
international of you
you may want to start
on those reports though
that pile is getting awfully high
and i dont want you to feel obligated
to come in to the office
over the weekend
hey um maggie asked me if you wanted
to come over for dinner
what do you say
stop trying to be my friend
bosses cannot be friends
it doesnt work that way
instead of coming over
to your house for dinner
with you and your wife
this weekend
i think ill stay home and masturbate
to the thought of your wife
wearing her bathing suit
at the barbecue
we should do pushups
hey shut up stop talking
what did you say
you talk too much i dont talk i act
i punched him in the goddamn throat
it felt amazing
who
our boss grant
do you want to join us
but theres just
the three chairs
ill sit in your chair
ah
we should do pushups
youre a good dog
and i care for you
that said i wont be
petting you anymore
ive been coddling you
this is for your own good
sorry
what are you doing
youre not supposed to be here
you dont have a black stripe
i thought
you were my friend
a friend wouldnt say
they were a day class student
and then go to the night class
behind my back
i didnt
our limbs get their strength
from leverage points
an elbow can
only bend one way
because if it could bend more than
one way it would be weaker
but this design is also
inherently flawed
henry come on up to the front
i want you to help me demonstrate something
watch closely
leverage is a weapon you can use it
or it can be used against you
you earned your blue belt
i know i could never take that from you
so i took your arm instead
never come back here
not even for the day class
everyone id like you
to welcome casey to the night class
hes a yellow belt
all right lets begin
youre done
for the night
so is he
can you drag him
off the mat
learn to love
this feeling
your bones aching
your chest screaming
this is karate
i have nothing else
congratulations on a great class everyone
lets begin the cooldown
theyre all gonna
cool down on the mat
but since
its your first time
i want you to cool down
away from the others
come with me
i know youre probably a little confused
about whats happening
just know that every one
of them out there
had to do this
at one point
again im sorry
to make you cool down with her
shes a woman so her hands are naturally
weaker than a mans
an afterworkout sports massage works
best with strong hands
so i know
this is not ideal
a massage from a woman
is still better than a selfmassage
well what are you
waiting for yellow belt
take off your jacket
and sit in front of me
sorry
i know theyre not
as strong as a mans
so this is the womens
changing room
it is
its the same as the mens in every way
only its smaller and not as nice
how long have you
been taking karate
i was one of the dojos first students
when it opened
and how long
have you been a brown belt
the cooldown
is supposed to be silent
why was he promoted
to black belt before you
is that why
you fought him tonight
you could have killed him
it looked like you wanted to
i was proving a point
about your belt
no
about why im here
never hold back
not ever
it will only make you weak
and you cant be weak anymore
not in the night classes
do you understand
i think i do
but then again
maybe i dont
you will
this isnt
a safe place casey
my turn
you can come in
your belt its yellow
i had it made
its for everyday use
with casual clothing
obviously i chose yellow
because i am a yellow belt
i wanted to wear
my yellow belt all the time
but i knew
it would look strange
that really is
a wonderful idea
to be honest
i wish id thought of it
now i can be a yellow belt
in everyday life
in addition to being one
in this dojo
i mentioned before
that i had it made
it was a special order
the thing is the belt company
wouldnt make just one
i had to make
at least 50
the positive out of this is that
i have enough for all the other students
i even had them make
a black one for you
i think it turned out
quite nice
i dont know what to say
im honored
how much
did all this cost
oh dont worry about that
this is my gift to the academy
although i was let go from my accounting job
the other day unexpectedly
you have
accounting experience
oh 10 years
or 120 months
im looking for someone
to help manage the books here
i cant keep up
with the growth of the academy
theres more money coming in
its overwhelming
i could use a mind
like yours
it wouldnt be permanent
just till you get things on track
well thank you
yes the answer is yes
good
youll start tomorrow
im sure youll find another job
by the time you finish
organizing the books here
casey
yes
i really am excited
about the belt
hello
casey
who is this
the men you told me about
would you know them if you saw them
is that you sensei
the men
the ones who attacked you
i
would you know their faces
they were wearing helmets
motorcycle helmets
so you didnt see their faces
why are you asking me this
the other day
when you told me about
what happened to you
it made me angry
i have resources
i found one of the men
who attacked you casey
i need you to meet me
but i wont be sure
it was dark
and like i was saying
they were wearing motorcycle helmets
its him
you have to trust me
you trust me dont you
did you park in the garage
like i asked
yeah
there was a motorcycle
im glad you came
i see youre wearing
your belt for strength
me too
not only does it represent
my black belt in karate
but it also helps
keep my pants up
yeah so where is he
in the bar
i still dont are you
are you sure its him
very sure
but how
how what you saw the motorcycle
with your own eyes
how did you find him
you dont need to worry about that
well what does he look like
he wears a hat sometimes
but not always
there he is
thats the man were looking for
him
yeah he matches
the description i gave you
hes not wearing a hat but i told you
he doesnt always wear one
i just dont think we should do this
not like this
although i do appreciate
you trying to
im not giving you
the choice casey
out heres no different
than in my dojo
that belt that youre wearing
is still yellow and mines still black
im your teacher and youre my student
and youll do as youre told
and understand this im not helping you
youre helping yourself
remember what he did to you
he stole your dignity
take it back
hi
do you remember me
i dont think
hey
look at me
im talking to you
do you remember my face
good night
no dont touch him
dont touch him
hes still breathing
what are you doing
you taught him a lesson
he and his friends will definitely
think twice before messing with you again
why are you filming this
im documenting
documenting what
your growth
see you tomorrow
well get you started with determining
which accounts are delinquent
and then if we have enough time
well move on to organizing the receipts
for the businessrelated
purchases
you did the right thing
youll see
im sorry
there was nothing we could do
did he go peacefully
no it was likely
very painful
there was a great deal
of trauma
what do you mean trauma
well the xrays indicated
there were broken ribs
and severe bruising
to the internal tissue
i dont understand
did you hurt your dog
of course not no
he was my best friend
i left him alone in my house
and when i came back
did you notice anything
out of place
i i dont know
i came straight here
do you think
someone did this to him
we found blood on his canines
he bit them
it seems he fought to the very end
he was very brave
i tried my best
not to coddle him
i know this is hard
i dont want to upset you
but its the strangest thing
he died from a punch im sure of it
only the bruising pattern doesnt seem
to indicate a fist but rather a foot
i know it doesnt
make any sense
sometimes your opponent
will be bigger than you
but remember this youre children
youre still growing
if they defeat you in combat there will
always be the opportunity later in life
when you are fully grown
to exact your revenge
casey were in
the middle of a class
what are you doing
im wearing shoes
on the mat
also i didnt bow
what happened
what is it you can tell me
im hungry
dont do this
all this not bowing and eating
on the mat has made me thirsty
rule number nine stay hydrated
enough
you killed my dog
when
last night
i was with you
last night
casey thats impossible
is that the dog that you were telling me
was of german lineage
he was a dachshund
you son of a bitch
dachshund short of stature long of body
not the most masculine of breeds
no unfortunately i have no idea
what youre talking about
my condolences
fuck you
and fuck your dojo
as i said already
i was with you last night
i saw what you did to that man
that innocent man
you said
he was one of them
and deep down you knew
he didnt have anything to do
with whatever happened to you
and yet you did what you did anyway
youre insane
it didnt matter to you did it
you wanted to take out your pain
and frustration on someone else
and you needed to become
what you hated
im done
this isnt karate
i have it all
on tape
the man from last night
has two choices
either become a better version of himself
or succumb
to his weaknesses
you gave him that choice
and his life will never be the same
that night all those months ago
was the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you know it
you are who you always
wanted to be
karate has changed you
channel this energy
into class tonight
and take your shoes off
okay children
back to work
in the art of accounting
im a white belt
and you are
a fiscal black belt
did you kill my dog
no
even if it wasnt a masculine dog
i didnt kill it
but im gonna
make this right
youll see
ive been having trouble
controlling my emotions lately
im sorry
its a very masculine trait
embrace it
women are
much coolerheaded
i want you to come
work for me fulltime
this is
a parttime job at best
i want you to take over
the childrens class
what about anna
let me worry about anna
but shes easily the most qualified person
for this position
im just a yellow belt
shes almost a black belt
anna will never
be a black belt
to be honest i didnt ever think
shed last this long
when she earned her blue belt
i put her in charge of the childrens class
due to her innate maternal instincts
she is a woman
but she let her feminine tendencies
interfere with her karate
i realize now that her being a woman will
prevent her from ever becoming a man
you know there are
things in life that men do
and there are things in life
that women do
there are some things
that women and men do together
like ride a tandem bicycle
or have sex
but even then men ride a tandem bicycle
to please the woman
and sex is
the other way around
karate
karates a thing for men
its time
for the night class
i just wanted to say
thank you for the belts
oh of course yeah
im so glad you like them
like it i love it
now while im walking
around in public
i can still feel
like a brown belt
by wearing this brown belt
thank you
tonight i want you you
and you
how big is your head
uh regular size
finish getting dressed
meet me out the back
i dont think
i can do this
did you hear me
i cant do this
yes you can
youll be fine
youre not coming
im coming
we dont need you
casey can take my place as runner
ill be the driver
this time
otherwise youll only have
three drivers and one runner
you need the extra runner
and you know it
put it on do it
i want you two
to play spotters
well do it
no
youre lucky i even let you
ride with us tonight
thomas is
too recognizable
you can see his disgusting face
and bandages
even with
the helmet on
casey has to do it
he needs to prove himself
its time casey
go find us someone to help
they have to be alone
you should have never
started taking karate casey
but you did
we dont have to do this
hell kill us if we dont
everythings gonna be okay
but one of us has to hurt him casey
i cant
then wait here
who are you
stop
police stop show me
your hands police
shit
i didnt mean to shoot your friend
please stop
stop where you are
show me your hands
it was an accident
casey
casey
casey casey
we have to leave now
they got our guy
hes dead they got away
you know one of the jobs
of the spotter
is to ask the person
if they have a gun
and that man had a gun
why didnt you ask if he had a gun
my kicks arent gonna be
so strong anymore
the bullet
only grazed you
imprecise and boorish
hey this is your fault
remind me to put a red stripe
on your belt tomorrow
what the stripe for instructors
you you can keep that
red stripes arent for instructors
its for ending a life
red represents blood
theres no stripe for instructors
a yellow belt with both
black and red stripes
unprecedented
thomas take anna home
no
ill do it
so how did you get yours
this one on the right
my what
your stripe
the red one
it was another student
he was a belt above me
the highest ranked at the time
other than sensei
i was better than him
i knew it but i also
knew my place
and during
the sparring sessions
i let him win cause i didnt want to
upset the hierarchy
as youve probably noticed
theres a hierarchy in karate
at this point
the dojo only had
one changing room
so i would wait until
the men finished changing
then i would
get dressed alone
and one night as i was
getting undressed
the upper belt came in
and attacked me from behind
id always
held back in class
so he saw me as weak
an easy target
i ended up strangling him
to death with his own belt
i made him suffer
and the last thing he saw
before his eyes burst was
the sense of satisfaction
on my face
he saw that i was not weak
but strong
ive never held
anything back since
after that sensei had
the old equipment closet
converted into the womens
changing room
he said that i had
tempted the upper belt
that it was my fault
but it wasnt your fault
i know
thanks for the ride
i hope i never see you
in class again casey
i hope you leave and never
come back i really do
youre gonna kill him
hes trying to kill him
you think youre the only one
that deserves a red stripe
i deserve a red stripe
just as much as you maybe more
he looks very weak
and hopeless
chances of him making something of
his life are minimal
go ahead
wait
do you hear that
sirens
i hear sirens
i dont hear anything
women are much more sensitive
to higherpitched sounds than men
trust me i hear sirens approaching
we should leave
take his wallet
im going to kill you
do you want
to know why
i could say its for
the honor of the dojo
i could tell you its because youre
blackmailing former students
into paying membership fees
long after they leave
or because private lessons are given
to those who do not ask for them
like myself
but really
its because i hate you
i hate you very much
and not only do i want
to watch you die
but i want to be the reason
that you stop breathing
ive never wanted anything
more in my entire life
im going to
kill you leslie
thats right
i found out that
your real name is leslie
i called you that
to make you angry
when you think about it
leslie is a lot more
femininesounding than casey
i can make you a black belt
you can skip all the other colors
you dont even need to earn it
i challenge you to a fight to the death
in unarmed combat
youll lose
im better at fighting
than you
very well
i accept
ive been thinking
a lot lately
about what i would say to you
after i killed you
i came up with two things
and i dont want to secondguess
my choice later on
so im going to say both
first you would say that using
this makes me a weak man
and without question
it does
but i am alive
and you are dead
so i would argue
it makes you the weaker man
the second thing i came up
with is from a film i saw once
i didnt play by the rules
but there never
were any rules
i defeated him in unarmed combat
to the death
in the tradition
of our grand master
i punched a hole through his head
with my index finger
it was a move that only grand master knew
but now i know it too
i did it to restore honor to grand master
this academy and its students
does anybody have
a problem with that
because if you do im happy to punch
my finger through your skull too
good ive killed
enough people for today
on second thought
there is one more thing
everyone hold their hands out
in front of them
dont make me ask again
whats this for
i sprained my wrist
how did you sprain it
playing guitar
i didnt know you played
i do
how are you
with chords and scales
im good with them
i can play several songs quite well
what type of music were you playing
when you sprained your wrist
soft rock
take off the bandage
why
because it is impossible
to sprain your wrist playing soft rock
only extreme metal
can do that
this is my new dog
weve come
to an understanding
he knows
that im the alpha
this is not mine
i took it
but i did not earn it
now get in line
yellow belt
up until this point youve been
taught that violence equals strength
and compassion
equals weakness
this ideology is limiting
it is possible to be brutally tolerant
or peacefully savage
your karate mindset is equally as important
as your karate skill set
youre gonna notice
some changes around here
but this is still the night class
and you are still its students
do you understand
good
lets start with
some moderate stretching
all right students
lets start with some warmups
jumping jacks
one two
three four five six
very good
seven eight nine 10
good everybody well done
now lets do your side kicks
very good side kicks
excellent form
okay everybody now were doing
karate chops ready
very good chops
great job manny
youve made great strides
