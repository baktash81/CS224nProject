we ve just got
the regular type of coffee here 
uh  two  please 
ugh 
okay 
bonjour 
you have completed
lesson 25  well done 
at this point  you should have
a firm grasp of the french language 
let s continue 
i wish i would have
been able to see that 
grant is
without a doubt
the worst boss
on the face of the earth 
one of these days  i m going to
punch him in the goddamn throat 
i can promise you that 
  are you talking about grant 
  we are 
i was thinking we should pull
an office prank on grant  you know 
put  like  an air horn
under his chair 
so when he sits down 
it makes a really loud noise 
or set fire to his house 
something along those lines 
i think maggie
gave birth recently 
grant s wife  maggie 
actually  i    i know she did 
i went to the cookout
at his house last weekend
and they were there with their new baby 
along with their two other children 
it was actually a really nice cookout 
quality meats and sides 
there was even a raffle for a gift card
to that new restaurant in town 
most of the office was there 
some of them even wore their swimsuits 
so  maybe burning down
the house isn t the best   
but  yeah   
yeah  sometimes   
sometimes here at the office 
grant will give me an assignment 
such as auditing an expense report 
and even though it s part of my job 
reports and auditing 
it can be frustrating 
what s that magazine
you re reading 
  what department are you in 
  accounting 
so you re the one who audits
our expense reports 
yeah 
get the fuck
out of here 
i m sorry 
i didn t know we were out 
do you have a gun 
what 
no  no  no  no 
please don t 
oh  here  here 
you can take my wallet 
there s  10 plus a gift card
to the new restaurant in town 
why are you doing this 
there was yet
another mugging last night 
this one putting
a 35 year old dog owner
in critical condition 
the motorcycle riding
assailants are still at large 
daddy 
there s a doggy in here 
in an official statement 
police are urging residents
to stay indoors after dark 
adding that if you must go outside 
you should carry a weapon 
such as a gun
or a large knife 
you have
only one unheard message 
hey  casey  uh  this is grant 
your boss  from work 
just calling to check in on you 
see how you re doing 
i just want you to know 
you can take all the time you need 
we can keep you on paid leave
for another week
and then it ll just start counting
towards your vacation time 
uh  but you ve got so much of that
built up  so i wouldn t be concerned 
hey  um  maybe you could take that trip
to france you re always talking about 
i hear the people there are lovely
and the food is supposed to be   
no one else
left you a message 
i m sorry 
i can t go out there 
this isn t how it was
supposed to be 
i was supposed to win 
you didn t play by the rules 
there never were any rules 
can i help you 
  i m interested in buying a gun 
  are you a hunter 
no  it would be
for self defense 
i need something
that can fit into my hand 
sounds like
you re after a handgun 
how about
something like this 
yes  this is exactly
what i m looking for 
i can hold it in my hand
quite easily 
i ll run the background check
and file the necessary paperwork 
yeah  is there some sort of
box you can put this in  or a bag 
sorry  there s a waiting period before
you can legally purchase this gun 
  oh 
  it s so a person who is upset with another person
can t come in here and buy a gun
to shoot that person with 
instead  they have to wait a little
while before they can do that 
  do you have any children 
  no  i don t  just a dog 
good  if you did
have children 
i would warn you that the risk of
accidental death increases drastically
with a gun in the home 
but since you don t have any children 
that statistic
is irrelevant to you 
you did mention self defense though 
be cautious 
in a violent altercation  an armed victim is
much more likely to be shot and killed
than an unarmed victim 
suicide is more common
with gun owners too 
you re really gonna
love owning a gun 
i m sure you re right 
karate is a language 
it s a way of communicating 
when you were a child 
you trained your vocal chords
to manipulate air to make words 
and then you learned
how to combine those words together
so that they would
form sentences 
and those sentences expressed thoughts 
wants  needs   
every conversation that you had
was honing your skills 
and now 
after all these years 
you are black belts
in speech 
so  at this point
in your karate training 
you are learning how to form words
with your fists and with your feet 
you re gonna get to the point
where you don t even have to think about it 
ask me a question 
what    what are your
plans for the weekend 
i m going to do some grocery shopping
and rent a film 
perhaps a comedy to watch
in the comfort of my own
home 
did that
answer your question 
that s it for today 
bow to me 
bow to grand master 
i hope it s   
i hope it s all right
that i watched 
the hardest part of your karate journey is
walking through that door
for the first time 
that s where most people fail 
  what was your name 
  casey  casey 
my name is sensei 
can anyone take classes 
the first lesson is free  so why don t you
come in tomorrow and give it a shot 
i ll try 
higher  manny 
you must attain the proper angle 
remember  you re punching
his nose up into his brain 
the key word is  up  
okay  class  line up 
we re gonna work
on a rear naked strangle 
with karate  our goal is always
to end a fight with strikes 
snapping an opponent s arm with a karate chop 
that would be one way 
or shattering their jaw
with a perfectly placed
spinning wheel kick
would be another 
but realistically 
when engaged in combat 
it is not a matter of if a fight
will end up on the ground 
it s a matter of when 
manny 
this is called
 taking the back  
i am in
the dominant position 
he is a mouse 
i am a python 
i slide my arm around his neck 
my elbow under his chin 
like a python  i slowly begin to
squeeze my mouse 
my arm cuts off the carotid arteries
on either side of his neck 
starving the brain of oxygenated blood 
students  what is
rule number eight 
tap or take a nap 
tap or take a nap 
okay  let s give
this technique a try 
bow to me 
bow to grand master 
hi there 
you re an excellent teacher 
usually  it s the mothers
that bring the children  not the fathers 
which one s yours 
oh  i m not a parent 
i m actually a new student 
i m taking my first class today 
  you re a new white belt 
  is that the first belt color 
white is before color 
you haven t earned color yet 
that makes sense  actually 
i think i need to borrow
a uniform for class 
i was going to ask sensei
but i didn t see him   
and you re lucky
he doesn t see you 
you re lucky he doesn t
see some white belt
disrespecting his dojo
and everything he s built 
what is the first rule 
the board is behind you 
what s rule number one 
oh 
no shoes on the mat 
take off your
fucking shoes  white belt 
you need a gi and you need a belt 
is that what you re asking 
yes 
  but say i m at an atm   
  mmm 
   and as my back is turned 
a man grabs my throat from behind 
  okay  may i 
  of course 
in this instance 
the first thing you always have to do
is alleviate the pressure on your neck 
mmm hmm 
your center of gravity
needs to be lower than mine 
so drop your hips 
  like this 
  exactly 
now you can lift me
off my feet with ease 
good 
see  even though i have your back 
you are now in the dominant position 
i have no control
and i can easily be thrown 
  this is very effective 
  yes  it is 
  what if they re resisting more 
  show me 
i see what you mean 
i would probably  uh   
i d probably do
something like that 
there s a lot of testosterone
in this dojo 
that s a hormone
men produce 
women produce it too
but men produce much more 
is this your first class 
  it is 
  here  let me help with that 
you gotta start from the front 
not the back 
mmm 
i notice
that your belt is blue 
it is  um  i feel a connection
to the color blue 
  it suits me 
  is blue a high rank 
blue is one of
the middle colors 
the order is white  yellow  green 
blue  purple  brown  black 
some schools use different colors
or change the order of the colors 
but our academy does it this way
and it s definitely the best way 
  and what do the strips of tape mean 
  they re called  stripes  
stripes 
stripes signify advancements
and achievements 
what does
the red stripe mean 
it means the person has killed
another person in combat 
i m joking 
it s for instructors 
anna  the brown belt 
has a red stripe
and she teaches
the children s class 
the only two people here
with red stripes are her and sensei 
and what about
the black stripe 
sensei only gives those to select students 
green belt and up 
today s your first day though 
i wouldn t worry about stripes 
it is wise to respect the past
but foolish to ignore innovation 
grand master understood this 
he would say 
 the only moves worth learning
are the ones that work  
just  cause i m a karateka
doesn t mean that i wouldn t teach
a bow and arrow choke
from brazilian jiujitsu 
or an inside heel hook
from russian sambo 
i would teach a reverse wrist splicer
from mongolian judo if it worked
and if it wasn t something
i just made up 
rule number 10 
if it works  use it 
which brings me
to today s lesson 
to kick with your fists 
and punch with your feet 
  i m kennith  what s your name 
  casey 
i m glad
you chose karate  casey 
it s an excellent martial art
and will likely change your life 
  would you like to go first 
  maybe you should go first 
okay 
  not in the day class 
  sorry  sensei 
i forgot where i was 
it was an accident 
you all right 
i m really glad
you re here 
that punch
got away from me 
i apologize 
would you like to try 
okay  uh  that was
a good first try 
that felt a little more like
a kick than a punch though 
it felt like
a kick to me too 
your whole life  you ve known
that a foot can only kick 
you ve known
that a foot cannot punch 
forget everything
that you know 
much better 
that felt like a punch 
a very weak punch 
but the most important thing is that
you re learning to punch with your foot 
let me show you again 
don t think of it as me punching
your body with my foot 
think of it as you striking
my foot with your body 
that makes perfect sense 
wow 
you have a wonderful
sense of balance 
i wanna sign up
for classes 
that s excellent news 
i m gonna go ahead
and enter you into the system 
  name  casey   
  davies 
that s a very
feminine sounding name 
  age 
  i turn 36 next month 
do you know what that is in months 
the system does it in months 
four hundred
and thirty two minus one
is 431 months old 
oh 
that sounds old
when you put it that way 
why karate 
um   
this question is
multiple choice 
 a  health and fitness 
b  career opportunity 
 c  new year s resolution 
d  self defense traumatic experience  
what if
it s none of the above 
  should i read the choices again 
  no  that s okay 
a  health and fitness 
this is the equipment room 
  this room is off limits  you understand 
  okay 
wait here  please 
this is your belt 
do not come to class without your belt 
it is yours  it is sacred 
there ll be a  15 charge
to replace a lost belt 
  hello 
  hi 
may i speak to
ms  casey davies  please 
this is him 
i m a man 
my mistake  i thought it was
a woman s name 
  who is this 
  i m calling about yourgun  the handgun 
wait  i remember you now 
yes  you are a man  again  apologies 
that s all right 
it looks like your paperwork is gonna
go through without any complications 
tomorrow morning  you will be able
to come in and purchase your gun 
  are you still there 
  i don t need a gun anymore 
you re not having a child 
are you 
because we sell child safety locks
that work reasonably well 
no  no child  i just   
i found something else 
don t tell me you bought a knife 
knives are good for self defense too 
but nine times out of 10 
a person with a knife
who gets into a fight with a person
with a gun will lose 
i didn t buy a knife 
well  the paperwork is valid
for the next six months 
in the meantime  i hope you don t
get attacked by anyone with a gun 
  or even a knife 
  goodbye 
good luck   
next  go 
next  go 
go 
horrible 
you do that in a fight
and your opponent would laugh at you 
next  casey 
good 
very good 
hey  casey  uh  it s grant 
your boss  from    from work 
so  it s been two months
since you ve been in to the office 
how are you 
i ve extended your leave five weeks past
what i d originally planned 
and your paycheck last week  you know 
that actually came out of my own pocket 
but i consider you a friend 
uh   
look  i hate to be the bad guy here
but i m going to need you to come in 
i can give you another day but you have
to come back to work after that 
or    you know 
i m going to have to let you go 
and i really don t want
to have to do that 
look  if it were up to me  i d give you
all the time you need  but my bosses   
the inbox is full 
please clear your messages 
who are all
these new people 
today s the promotion
ceremony 
everyone comes
to the promotion ceremony 
  even students who take the night class 
  the night class 
black stripes 
the color black represents
night  as in  night class  
i think i ll stick
with the day class 
now that i think about it 
you re much more suited to the day class 
me  on the other hand   
i m getting
my stripe today 
overheard sensei
talking about it 
  oh  congratulations 
  thank you 
i have   
i have definitely earned it 
today s a special day 
not only is it a day
in which we recognize those of you
who have outgrown
your belt color 
it is also
an important anniversary 
seven years ago today 
grand master was killed
in a tragic hiking accident
where he was shot
in the face with a gun 
he was mistaken for a bird
by a hunter carrying a shotgun 
type of gun
that fires a cartridge
which scatters 10 to 20 pellets
at its target 
unlike our karate 
which is clean and precise 
this gun was imprecise
and boorish 
rule number 11 
guns are for the weak 
that board isn t
just for children 
the rules apply
to all of us 
grand master is the only person ever
to wear the rainbow belt 
it s a belt color that he created
and awarded to himself 
it is the highest honor
in all of karate 
he achieved this rank
after he challenged and defeated
all three other grand masters in the state
in unarmed combat to the death 
he finished each fight
with his signature technique 
a technique
only he knew 
a technique he never
even taught me 
he punched through his opponents  heads
with his index finger 
he was the greatest man
who ever lived 
i do not award belts 
my students earn them 
and this first belt
goes to someone
who i see
a little of myself in 
he has devoted
himself to karate 
and he has more than earned the right
to wear the color yellow 
casey 
the progression from
yellow belt to green belt
is one of great sacrifice
and introspection 
it is filled with immeasurable pain 
both internal and external 
thank you all for coming
to support each other 
  we are all family here   
  isn t there something else 
what was that 
i just wanted to make sure you weren t
forgetting something 
what would i
be forgetting  blue belt 
uh  i heard there was going to be
another promotion tonight 
  you heard that 
  i did 
something black 
oh 
 something black  
actually  you re correct 
there is something black 
well  i was saving it till the very end
for dramatic effect 
as i said before 
today is a special day 
not only because it is
the unfortunate anniversary
of grand master being shot
and killed while on a hike
after being mistaken
for a bird by a hunter 
today is the first time
that i get to promote one of
my students to black belt 
this student has been with us
from the very beginning 
they are unquestioning 
their loyalty is unwavering 
but most importantly  they know
that despite this black belt 
they will always
be my student 
while i will always
be their teacher 
thomas 
you re in my spot 
brown belt 
black is higher than brown 
please move over to your left 
this concludes
the ceremony 
as always  be sure to hold on
to your old belts
so that if someone questions
the legitimacy of your rank 
you can prove them wrong first
with tangible evidence 
and then in combat 
  missionary 
  ah  that is the best position 
i also like when i m behind her
and she s on her hands and knees   
  doggy style 
  yes  doggy style 
that position
is also very nice 
all this stuff s yellow 
paper  please 
excuse me
did you door ding my car 
  i don t know 
  i think you did 
then why
did you ask me 
because i wanted to give you the
benefit of the doubt 
  okay  then no 
  no what 
  i don t think i did 
  but you did though 
  i say i didn t 
  but it doesn t work that way 
you obviously did  i saw you 
you can t just tell me   
  do you have a problem 
  the part where you slammed your door
into my car  i have a problem
with that  yes 
  i know karate 
  what belt are you 
yellow belt 
your arms are holding
the grocery bag 
you d have to drop the bag
in order to strike me 
in the time it would
take you to do that 
i would punch you
in the face as hard as i can 
so i m gonna ask you again 
do you have a problem 
you didn t slam
your door into my car 
  so i don t have a problem 
  no 
you  karate 
impossible 
no  bad dog 
i m sorry 
fuck 
are you sure this board
isn t meant for green belts 
here  let me try 
okay 
here  try a white
belt board 
your kicks and punches
lacked conviction today 
maybe i was wrong 
maybe you weren t ready
to be a yellow belt 
no  you re not supposed to do that 
you re supposed to stand up for yourself 
but you re right though  i wasn t able
to break a single board today 
and that stops you from
being a yellow belt how 
if a bear s forest catches on fire 
the bear is still a bear 
even if a boat capsizes
in rough seas
and sinks
to the bottom of the ocean
with no survivors 
it is still a boat 
you will be a yellow belt
until you die 
or until you re a green belt 
and you ll be a green belt
until you re a blue belt 
and so on 
i wish i could
wear my belt all the time 
i feel less than
without it 
come with me 
i want you to tell me
why you re here 
i    i told you before 
it was my new year s resolution 
i thought you said
it was health and fitness 
that s what i meant 
why are you really here 
i was mugged 
at night 
a few months ago 
i was beaten  severely 
by several men 
i m afraid 
i m afraid of the dark 
i m afraid of other men 
they intimidate me 
i wanna be
what intimidates me 
well  you came to the right place 
you re learning karate 
you re a blade
and i m sharpening you 
but there s a mental
component as well 
you mean  like 
believing in myself 
yeah  that won t hurt 
i m talking about
something a little different 
what s your favorite
style of music 
adult contemporary 
no  should be metal 
  do you ever listen to metal 
  you mean  like hard rock 
metal is much more
aggressive than hard rock 
  from now on  you ll listen to metal 
  yeah 
it s the toughest music
there is 
what about hobbies 
is there anything that you feel
particularly passionate about 
other than your new found
passion for metal 
i enjoy france 
i mean  french things 
i haven t actually been to france 
but i m learning the language
and i would like to visit there someday 
mmm  that s not good 
historically  the perception
of the french
is that they re weak and
that they surrender easily 
hardly traits that
you want to embrace 
russia  on the other hand 
is considered a tough country 
also  germany 
germany is very strong and capable 
  my dog s breed is german 
  excellent  german shepherd 
a dachshund  actually 
  well  regardless  germany it is 
  okay 
you must start thinking this way 
do you understand 
in every facet of life  what you eat 
how you interact with others 
what arouses you  everything should be
as masculine as possible 
as you know 
i teach a night class 
this is your invitation 
i ve never opened this class up
to yellow belts before
but i m gonna make
an exception for you 
  what time is the class 
  it s at night  it s a night class 
i don t think i can 
i won t make you do anything 
but like the color of the belt 
you ve earned this stripe 
this invitation 
it will be yours forever 
just because you ignore it
doesn t mean it doesn t exist 
come here 
not only does this class offer you more
of what i believe you re looking for
but i guarantee you it will help you
become what you fear 
casey  stop being afraid 
the usual  chocolate croissant
and an orange juice 
no  i ve got a new usual 
coffee  hot  black  with nothing to eat 
  that s mine 
  it s mine now  i take what i want 
i only care about myself 
hey there  casey 
  listening to music 
  i m learning german 
german  that s very
international of you 
you may want to start
on those reports though 
that pile is getting awfully high
and i don t want you to feel obligated
to come in to the office
over the weekend 
hey  um  maggie asked me if you wanted
to come over for dinner 
what do you say 
stop trying to be my friend 
bosses cannot be friends 
it doesn t work that way 
instead of coming over
to your house for dinner
with you and your wife
this weekend 
i think i ll stay home and masturbate
to the thought of your wife
wearing her bathing suit
at the barbecue 
  we should do push ups 
  hey  shut up  stop talking 
  what did you say 
  you talk too much  i don t talk  i act 
i punched him in the goddamn throat 
it felt amazing 
  who 
  our boss  grant 
do you want to join us 
but there s just
the three chairs 
i ll sit in your chair 
ah 
we should do push ups 
you re a good dog
and i care for you 
that said  i won t be
petting you anymore 
i ve been coddling you 
this is for your own good 
sorry 
what are you doing 
you re not supposed to be here 
you don t have a black stripe 
i thought
you were my friend 
a friend wouldn t say
they were a day class student
and then go to the night class
behind my back 
i didn t   
our limbs get their strength
from leverage points 
an elbow can
only bend one way
because if it could bend more than
one way it would be weaker 
but this design is also
inherently flawed 
henry  come on up to the front 
i want you to help me demonstrate something 
watch closely 
leverage is a weapon  you can use it
or it can be used against you 
you earned your blue belt 
i know i could never take that from you 
so i took your arm instead 
never come back here 
not even for the day class 
everyone  i d like you
to welcome casey to the night class 
he s a yellow belt 
all right  let s begin 
you re done
for the night 
so is he 
can you drag him
off the mat 
learn to love
this feeling 
your bones aching 
your chest screaming 
this is karate 
i have nothing else 
congratulations on a great class  everyone 
let s begin the cool down 
they re all gonna
cool down on the mat 
but since
it s your first time 
i want you to cool down
away from the others 
come with me 
i know you re probably a little confused
about what s happening 
just know that every one
of them out there
had to do this
at one point 
again  i m sorry
to make you cool down with her 
she s a woman so her hands are naturally
weaker than a man s 
an after workout sports massage works
best with strong hands 
so i know
this is not ideal 
a massage from a woman
is still better than a self massage 
well  what are you
waiting for  yellow belt 
take off your jacket
and sit in front of me 
sorry 
i know they re not
as strong as a man s 
so  this is the women s
changing room 
it is 
it s the same as the men s in every way 
only it s smaller and not as nice 
how long have you
been taking karate 
i was one of the dojo s first students
when it opened 
and how long
have you been a brown belt 
the cool down
is supposed to be silent 
why was he promoted
to black belt before you 
is that why
you fought him tonight 
you could have killed him 
  it looked like you wanted to 
  i was proving a point 
  about your belt 
  no 
about why i m here 
never hold back 
not ever 
it will only make you weak 
and you can t be weak anymore 
not in the night classes 
do you understand 
i think i do 
but then again 
maybe i don t 
you will 
this isn t
a safe place  casey 
my turn 
you can come in 
your belt  it s yellow 
i had it made 
it s for everyday use
with casual clothing 
obviously  i chose yellow
because i am a yellow belt 
i wanted to wear
my yellow belt all the time
but i knew
it would look strange 
that really is
a wonderful idea 
to be honest 
i wish i d thought of it 
now i can be a yellow belt
in everyday life 
in addition to being one
in this dojo 
i mentioned before
that i had it made 
it was a special order 
the thing is  the belt company
wouldn t make just one 
i had to make
at least 50 
the positive out of this is that
i have enough for all the other students 
i even had them make
a black one for you 
i think it turned out
quite nice 
i don t know what to say 
i m honored 
how much
did all this cost 
oh  don t worry about that 
this is my gift to the academy 
although i was let go from my accounting job
the other day  unexpectedly 
you have
accounting experience 
oh  10 years 
or 120 months 
i m looking for someone
to help manage the books here 
i can t keep up
with the growth of the academy 
there s more money coming in 
it s overwhelming 
i could use a mind
like yours 
it wouldn t be permanent 
just till you get things on track 
well  thank you 
yes  the answer is yes 
good 
you ll start tomorrow 
i m sure you ll find another job
by the time you finish
organizing the books here 
  casey 
  yes 
i really am excited
about the belt 
  hello 
  casey 
who is this 
the men you told me about 
would you know them if you saw them 
is that you  sensei 
the men 
the ones who attacked you 
  i   
  would you know their faces 
they were wearing helmets 
motorcycle helmets 
  so you didn t see their faces 
  why are you asking me this 
the other day 
when you told me about
what happened to you 
it made me angry 
i have resources 
i found one of the men
who attacked you  casey 
i need you to meet me 
but i won t be sure 
it was dark 
and like i was saying 
they were wearing motorcycle helmets 
it s him 
you have to trust me 
you trust me  don t you 
did you park in the garage
like i asked 
yeah 
there was a motorcycle 
i m glad you came 
i see you re wearing
your belt for strength 
me too 
not only does it represent
my black belt in karate
but it also helps
keep my pants up 
yeah  so  where is he 
in the bar 
i still don t    are you   
are you sure it s him 
  very sure 
  but how 
how what  you saw the motorcycle
with your own eyes 
how did you find him 
  you don t need to worry about that 
  well  what does he look like 
he wears a hat sometimes 
but not always 
there he is 
  that s the man we re looking for 
  him 
yeah  he matches
the description i gave you 
he s not wearing a hat  but i told you
he doesn t always wear one 
i just don t think we should do this 
not like this 
although i do appreciate
you trying to   
i m not giving you
the choice  casey 
out here s no different
than in my dojo 
that belt that you re wearing
is still yellow and mine s still black 
i m your teacher and you re my student
and you ll do as you re told 
and understand this  i m not helping you 
you re helping yourself 
remember what he did to you 
he stole your dignity 
take it back 
hi 
do you remember me 
i don t think 
hey 
look at me 
i m talking to you 
do you remember my face 
good night 
no  don t touch him 
don t touch him 
he s still breathing 
what are you doing 
you taught him a lesson 
he and his friends will definitely
think twice before messing with you again 
  why are you filming this 
  i m documenting 
documenting what 
your growth 
see you tomorrow 
we ll get you started with determining
which accounts are delinquent
and then  if we have enough time 
we ll move on to organizing the receipts
for the business related
purchases 
you did the right thing 
you ll see 
i m sorry 
there was nothing we could do 
did he go peacefully 
no  it was likely
very painful 
there was a great deal
of trauma 
what do you mean   trauma  
well  the x rays indicated
there were broken ribs
and severe bruising
to the internal tissue 
i don t understand 
did you hurt your dog 
of course not  no 
he was my best friend 
i left him alone in my house
and when i came back   
did you notice anything
out of place 
i    i don t know 
i came straight here 
do you think
someone did this to him 
  we found blood on his canines 
  he bit them 
it seems he fought to the very end 
he was very brave 
i tried my best
not to coddle him 
i know this is hard 
i don t want to upset you 
but it s the strangest thing 
he died from a punch  i m sure of it 
only  the bruising pattern doesn t seem
to indicate a fist but rather a foot 
i know  it doesn t
make any sense 
sometimes your opponent
will be bigger than you 
but remember this  you re children 
you re still growing 
if they defeat you in combat  there will
always be the opportunity later in life 
when you are fully grown 
to exact your revenge 
casey  we re in
the middle of a class 
what are you doing 
i m wearing shoes
on the mat 
also  i didn t bow 
what happened 
  what is it  you can tell me 
  i m hungry 
don t do this 
all this not bowing and eating
on the mat has made me thirsty 
rule number nine  stay hydrated 
  enough 
  you killed my dog 
  when 
  last night 
i was with you
last night 
casey  that s impossible 
is that the dog that you were telling me
was of german lineage 
he was a dachshund 
you son of a bitch 
dachshund  short of stature  long of body 
not the most masculine of breeds 
no  unfortunately  i have no idea
what you re talking about 
my condolences 
fuck you
and fuck your dojo 
as i said already 
i was with you last night 
i saw what you did to that man 
that innocent man 
you said
he was one of them 
and deep down  you knew
he didn t have anything to do
with whatever happened to you
and yet you did what you did anyway 
  you re insane 
  it didn t matter to you  did it 
you wanted to take out your pain
and frustration on someone else
and you needed to become
what you hated 
i m done 
this isn t karate 
i have it all
on tape 
the man from last night
has two choices 
either become a better version of himself   
   or succumb
to his weaknesses 
you gave him that choice 
and his life will never be the same 
that night all those months ago
was the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you know it 
you are who you always
wanted to be 
karate has changed you 
channel this energy
into class tonight 
and take your shoes off 
okay  children 
back to work 
in the art of accounting 
i m a white belt 
and you are
a fiscal black belt 
  did you kill my dog 
  no 
even if it wasn t a masculine dog 
i didn t kill it 
but i m gonna
make this right 
you ll see 
i ve been having trouble
controlling my emotions lately 
i m sorry 
it s a very masculine trait 
embrace it 
women are
much cooler headed 
i want you to come
work for me full time 
this is
a part time job at best 
i want you to take over
the children s class 
  what about anna 
  let me worry about anna 
but she s easily the most qualified person
for this position 
i m just a yellow belt 
she s almost a black belt 
anna will never
be a black belt 
to be honest  i didn t ever think
she d last this long 
when she earned her blue belt 
i put her in charge of the children s class
due to her innate maternal instincts 
she is a woman 
but she let her feminine tendencies
interfere with her karate 
i realize now that her being a woman will
prevent her from ever becoming a man 
you know  there are
things in life that men do
and there are things in life
that women do 
there are some things
that women and men do together 
like ride a tandem bicycle
or have sex 
but even then  men ride a tandem bicycle
to please the woman
and sex is
the other way around 
karate   
karate s a thing for men 
it s time
for the night class 
i just wanted to say
thank you for the belts 
oh  of course  yeah 
i m so glad you like them 
like it  i love it 
now  while i m walking
around in public 
i can still feel
like a brown belt
by wearing this brown belt 
thank you 
tonight  i want you  you 
and you 
how big is your head 
uh  regular size 
finish getting dressed 
meet me out the back 
i don t think
i can do this 
did you hear me 
i can t do this 
yes  you can 
you ll be fine 
  you re not coming 
  i m coming 
  we don t need you 
  casey can take my place as runner 
i ll be the driver
this time 
otherwise you ll only have
three drivers and one runner 
you need the extra runner
and you know it 
put it on  do it 
i want you two
to play spotters 
we ll do it 
no 
you re lucky i even let you
ride with us tonight 
thomas is
too recognizable 
you can see his disgusting face
and bandages
even with
the helmet on 
casey has to do it 
he needs to prove himself 
it s time  casey 
go find us someone to help 
they have to be alone 
you should have never
started taking karate  casey 
  but you did 
  we don t have to do this 
he ll kill us if we don t 
everything s gonna be okay 
but one of us has to hurt him  casey 
i can t 
then wait here 
who are you 
stop 
police  stop  show me
your hands  police 
shit 
i didn t mean to shoot your friend 
please  stop 
stop where you are 
show me your hands 
it was an accident 
casey 
casey 
casey  casey 
we have to leave now 
they got our guy 
he s dead  they got away 
you know  one of the jobs
of the spotter
is to ask the person
if they have a gun 
and that man had a gun 
why didn t you ask if he had a gun 
my kicks aren t gonna be
so strong anymore 
the bullet
only grazed you 
imprecise and boorish 
hey  this is your fault 
remind me to put a red stripe
on your belt tomorrow 
what  the stripe for instructors 
you    you can keep that 
red stripes aren t for instructors 
it s for ending a life 
red represents blood 
there s no stripe for instructors 
a yellow belt with both
black and red stripes   
unprecedented 
  thomas  take anna home 
  no 
i ll do it 
so  how did you get yours 
this one on the right 
my what 
your stripe 
the red one 
it was another student 
he was a belt above me 
the highest ranked at the time 
other than sensei 
i was better than him 
i knew it  but i also
knew my place 
and during
the sparring sessions 
i let him win  cause i didn t want to
upset the hierarchy 
as you ve probably noticed 
there s a hierarchy in karate 
at this point 
the dojo only had
one changing room 
so i would wait until
the men finished changing 
then i would
get dressed alone 
and one night  as i was
getting undressed 
the upper belt came in
and attacked me from behind 
i d always
held back in class 
so he saw me as weak 
an easy target 
i ended up strangling him
to death with his own belt 
i made him suffer 
and the last thing he saw
before his eyes burst was
the sense of satisfaction
on my face 
he saw that i was not weak 
but strong 
i ve never held
anything back since 
after that  sensei had
the old equipment closet
converted into the women s
changing room 
he said that i had
tempted the upper belt 
that it was my fault 
but it wasn t your fault 
i know 
thanks for the ride 
i hope i never see you
in class again  casey 
i hope you leave and never
come back  i really do 
you re gonna kill him 
he s trying to kill him 
you think you re the only one
that deserves a red stripe 
i deserve a red stripe
just as much as you  maybe more 
he looks very weak
and hopeless 
chances of him making something of
his life are minimal 
  go ahead 
  wait 
do you hear that 
sirens 
i hear sirens 
i don t hear anything 
women are much more sensitive
to higher pitched sounds than men 
trust me  i hear sirens approaching 
we should leave 
take his wallet 
i m going to kill you 
do you want
to know why 
i could say it s for
the honor of the dojo 
i could tell you it s because you re
blackmailing former students
into paying membership fees
long after they leave 
or because private lessons are given
to those who do not ask for them 
like myself 
but really
it s because i hate you 
i hate you very much 
and not only do i want
to watch you die 
but i want to be the reason
that you stop breathing 
i ve never wanted anything
more in my entire life 
i m going to
kill you  leslie 
that s right 
i found out that
your real name is leslie 
i called you that
to make you angry 
when you think about it 
leslie is a lot more
feminine sounding than casey 
i can make you a black belt 
you can skip all the other colors 
you don t even need to earn it 
i challenge you to a fight to the death 
in unarmed combat 
you ll lose 
i m better at fighting
than you 
very well 
i accept 
i ve been thinking
a lot lately 
about what i would say to you
after i killed you 
i came up with two things 
and i don t want to second guess
my choice later on 
so i m going to say both 
first  you would say that using
this makes me a weak man 
and without question 
it does 
but i am alive
and you are dead 
so i would argue
it makes you the weaker man 
the second thing i came up
with is from a film i saw once 
i didn t play by the rules 
but there never
were any rules 
i defeated him in unarmed combat
to the death 
in the tradition
of our grand master 
i punched a hole through his head
with my index finger 
it was a move that only grand master knew
but now i know it too 
i did it to restore honor to grand master 
this academy and its students 
does anybody have
a problem with that 
because if you do  i m happy to punch
my finger through your skull too 
good  i ve killed
enough people for today 
on second thought 
there is one more thing 
everyone hold their hands out
in front of them 
don t make me ask again 
what s this for 
i sprained my wrist 
  how did you sprain it 
  playing guitar 
  i didn t know you played 
  i do 
how are you
with chords and scales 
i m good with them 
i can play several songs quite well 
what type of music were you playing
when you sprained your wrist 
soft rock 
  take off the bandage 
  why 
because it is impossible
to sprain your wrist playing soft rock 
only extreme metal
can do that 
this is my new dog 
we ve come
to an understanding 
he knows
that i m the alpha 
this is not mine 
i took it 
but i did not earn it 
now get in line 
yellow belt 
up until this point  you ve been
taught that violence equals strength
and compassion
equals weakness 
this ideology is limiting 
it is possible to be brutally tolerant
or peacefully savage 
your karate mindset is equally as important
as your karate skill set 
you re gonna notice
some changes around here 
but this is still the night class
and you are still its students 
do you understand 
good 
let s start with
some moderate stretching 
all right  students 
let s start with some warm ups 
jumping jacks 
one  two 
three  four  five  six   
  very good 
     seven  eight  nine  10 
good  everybody  well done 
now let s do your side kicks 
very good side kicks 
excellent form 
okay  everybody  now we re doing
karate chops  ready 
very good chops 
great job  manny 
you ve made great strides
