  like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore  
  hold me close  
  sway me more  
  like a flower
bending in the breeze

dr  sh  
schreber  please 
won t you come in 
you must be emma murdoch 
thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice 
 clicking tongue 
what is this 
 squeaks 
a rather crude experiment   
designed to further my studies 
i don t understand 
you say you re my husband s doctor 
but he never mentioned you to me 
the truth is  mrs  murdoch   
john has been coming to
see me for quite some time 
he had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal   
stemming from your
marital difficulties 
  john told you what happened 
  yes 
when was the last time
that you saw him 
3 weeks ago 
he packed a suitcase 
he was very angry at me 
i understand how difficult
this must be for you 
but for john s sake 
i would like you   
to think of me
as your friend  emma 
it appears that john has suffered
a psychotic break 
complete memory loss 
he may be delusional 
even violent 
emma   
if he were to contact you 
and i suspect he will   
you must call me immediately 
do you understand 
it is imperative that i be
the first one to reach him 
wherever your husband is 
he is searching   
 exhales 
   for himself

sir  we just got

 distant phone rings

 ring 
inspector bumstead 
i came here to file
a missing persons report for my husband 
take it to the front desk 
they told me to come see you 
his name s john murdoch 
mrs  murdoch 
why didn t you report this before 
i mean  if your husband has been missing
as long as you say   
i thought he d simply
walked out on me 
then a   doctor contacted me
this evening 
how long have you been married 
nearly four years 
  hm 
  why do you ask 
because you seem uncomfortable
with your ring 
as if you were   
unaccustomed to wearing it 
no  i never take it off 
do these names
mean anything to you 
no  who are these women 
why are you looking
for my husband 
are you going to accuse him
of something 
maybe  maybe murder 
whose murder 
  which one 
  ha ha  all of them 
mrs  murdoch 
i am sorry  i m sorry 
i didn t mean to alarm you 
i m so sorry that i came 
just both made a mistake 
mrs  murdoch  if you please 
lf you ll just give me
half a second to explain  
     slow saxophone 
  i ll be right out 
 shoe drops loudly on floor 
have we met before 
lf we did   
i hope you re still breathing 
what s your name  honey 
john  ha ha 
ha ha  well 
that s an appropriate name 
yeah 
i was just thinking 
what you do   
seems kind of dangerous   
right now 
i mean  how do you know
i m not the killer 
you don t seem like
the killer type  why 
you feeling any urges
i should know about 
heh 
 may sighs 
 door closes 
aw  shoot 
oh 
 sign creaking 
 clattering 
so it seems you ve discovered
your unpleasant nature 
who are you 
we might ask
the same question  yes 
sleep now 
 wood creaking 
aah 
he can tune 
 clicking 
ah 
  ah 
  ooph 
ah 
 strange chugging noise 
 squealing sound 
 wailing 
 squelching noise 
what is to be done 
this man is dangerous 
it is said he is able to tune 
impossible 
we have seen it
with our own eyes 
on occasion the imprinting
does not take 
they behave erratically
when they awaken 
we find them wandering
like lost children 
but this one was different  yes 
what has the doctor
to say about this 
he has failed to report in 
  and mr  quick 
  no more mr  quick 
mr  quick  dead  yes 
poor  poor mr  quick 
mr  book  does he know 
should we not know  mr  hand 
we had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you 
we can know nothing
until we possess him 
mr  night  you will take the east 
mr  face  you the west 
mr  glove  the south 
mr  shade  the north 
we must have this man 
do you really think my husband could be
capable of committing those murders 
do you 
let s hope  for both our sakes 
that i m wrong 
 gasps 
john 
i ve been so worried about you 
are you punishing me 
you know  if disappearing
is your way of punishing me   
i don t appreciate it 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
i found these keys in my pocket   
so i assume i live here 
you supposed to be my wife 
supposed to be 
john 
you really   
don t know who i am  do you 
your doctor called me 
he was worried
that this might happen 
my doctor 
yeah  he  uh   
he gave me his card 
he s desperate to find you 
schreber 
 sighs 
i feel like i m living out
someone else s nightmare 
what happened to me 
why was i seeing a doctor 
i had an affair 
you were angry at me 
the police are looking for you 
i know  i saw the papers 
 killer stalks city streetwalkers  
i was with one of those women   
before i came here tonight 
i don t understand 
i  i met her outside an automat 
i guess i wanted to test myself 
i wanted to know if i had it in me
to do those things 
maybe i have lost my mind  but whoever
i am  i m still me and i m not a killer 
i believe you 
you do 
what 
the car outside 
the one you arrived in 
it s a cop 
he dropped me off here 
 sniffs 
i didn t know he was still here 
mrs  murdoch  john 
hold it right there  mister 
wait  you have the wrong man 
stand aside  will you  please 
i didn t kill anyone 
right now what you are
is a suspect  turn yourself in 
i ll listen to whatever
you have to say 
you re not gonna believe
what i have to say 
try me 
there s someone after me 
there s this  this group of men 
they want me dead 
and i don t even know if  
they re not even  
yeah  who s gonna
listen to a madman 
stand aside  mrs  murdoch 
run 
no one ever listens to me 
murdoch  stop 
murdoch 
how much further 
we re almost there  buddy 
hey  you happen to know
the way to shell beach 
you re kidding  me and the missus
spent our honeymoon there 
all you gotta do is take
main street west to  
or is it the cross  
you know  that s funny 
i  i can t seem to remember   
if it s main street west
or the cross town 
i m sorry  inspector 
i cannot be of more assistance   
but i am running late
for an appointment 
well  i appreciate
your taking the time 
there s just one thing
that puzzles me 
i ve met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work 
murdoch doesn t strike me as one 
perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough 
well  i do know when someone
is lying to me  doctor 
forgive me  inspector 
but you are not a clinician 
judging personalities
happens to be my business 
well  maybe you could
give me a few pointers 
certainly 
let s take you  for instance 
you are a fastidious man  driven 
consumed by details 
i would say your life is   
rather lonely 
good evening  inspector 
i really must be going 
 starts engine 
woman  closing time 
the pool is now closed 
dr  schreber 
most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here 
you know how uncomfortable
we find all this   
moisture 
  i m sorry  i  
  failed to report in  yes 
i was frightened 
i  i have a weak heart  you know 
your weakness is not  we think 
an affair of the heart 
we found this
in his hotel room 
must we reproduce
mr  murdoch s memories again 
i tried to imprint him   
but he woke up  he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand 
i tried to stop him but he was too fast 
he has no memories  then 
only fragments 
the procedure  it was interrupted 
i  i guess it s only a matter
of rounding him up 
you have had strays
before  right 
this is no stray  doctor 
this one can tune 
but that s impossible 
i thought only you had that ability 
you will process another template
of the subject s memories  yes 
of course  i ll imprint him again 
no  we require them
for a quite different purpose 
it s almost midnight 
dr  schreber 
we ll talk again
after tonight s tuning  but   
no more delays  yes 
no more inconsistencies
in your behavior 
 loud noise 
you appear quite frail  doctor 
perhaps some exercise
would do you good 
 gasps 
 buzzer 
  come in 
  kate 
  how is he 
  the same 
walenski  it s me  frank 
 key in lock 
come in  frank 
close the door 
i ve been looking through
some of your old reports 
it s an interesting case 
the kind that can make
a man s career   
or break it 
yeah  i was on that case 
and then what 
what happened then  eddie 
nothing happened  frank 
i ve just been spending time
on the subway  riding in circles 
thinking in circles 
there s no way out 
i ve been over every inch
of this city 
you re scaring your wife
to death  eddie 
she s not my wife 
i don t know who she is 
i don t know who any of us are 
what makes you say that 
do you think about
the past much  frank 
as much as the next guy 
see  i ve been trying
to remember things  
clearly remember things
from my past 
but the more i try to think back 
the more it all starts to unravel 
none of it seems real 
it s like i ve just been
dreaming this life   
and when i finally wake up
i ll be somebody else 
somebody totally different 
 panting 
you saw something 
didn t you  eddie 
something to do with the case 
there is no case 
there never was 
it s all just a big joke 
it s a joke 
 panting 
 whirring 
man  tonight s requirements are   
12 family photo albums 
9 personal diaries   
17 love letters 
assorted childhood photographs   
26 wallets 
id s and social security cards 
dr  schreber 
these do bring back memories 
this one is still warm 
what is it 
the recollections of a great lover 
a catalog of conquests 
we will soon find out 
you wouldn t appreciate that 
would you  mr  whatever your name is 
not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand 
let s see 
a touch of unhappy childhood 
ahh 
a dash of teenage rebellion 
and last  but not least   
a tragic death in the family 
mr  book  doctor 
mr  book 
whoa 
aah  aah  ah  ah 
why does murdoch not sleep   
during the tuning as the others do 
i don t know  maybe he s a step up
the evolutionary ladder 
a  a freak of nature 
he s adapting to survive 
what do you expect 
weren t you looking for the human soul 
that s the purpose
of your little zoo  isn t it 
that s why you keep changing people
and things around every night 
maybe you have finally found
what you are looking for   
and it s going
to bite you on your  
ah 
it requires several of your lifetimes
to master our gifts 
the idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune  
is absurd  i know   
but what other
explanation is there 
 clock chiming 
it is time 
shut it down 
 horns honking 
man  get your paper right here 
 dog barks 
it s driving me crazy 
i can t sleep 
and they call my job  unskilled  
you think you ve got it tough 
you try looking after these kids 
for a change 
anyways  frederickson says
he ll take me off the damn night shift soon 
well  it s about time  dear

we can t talk here 
it is not safe 
if they see us together  they ll  
i don t care 
i want some answers 
i want some answers now 
who are they 
why are they trying to kill me 
  answer me 
  oh 
my god  you really can do it 
i did that 
listen to me  john 
you have their power 
you can make things happen
by will alone 
they call it tuning  that is how they make
the buildings change 
just now you acted out
of self defense  a reflex 
but i can teach you to control
your power consciously 
let me help you  john 
together we can stop them 
we can take the city back

he made a terrible
impression for the firm

i was going to have to let him go 
and well you should have  darling 
he attacked me 
i don t know where he has gone 
come  dr  schreber 
we have much to do 
yes 
yes 
 clock ticking 
  they say that you re
a run around lover  
  though you say  
  it isn t so  
  but if you put me down
for another  
  i ll know  
  believe me  i ll know  
   cause the night  
  has a thousand eyes  
  and a thousand eyes  
  can t tell  but see  
  if you are true to me  
  so remember  
  when you tell those little white lies  
  that the night
has a thousand eyes  
  a thousand eyes  
 applause 
man  whoo 
tonight s experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations 
the first subject
shall be imprinted here on avenue m 
mr  book  there is a  a problem 
there is no avenue m 
we were unable to complete it 
during the last tuning
we detected a lack of control 
an opposing influence
on the machines 
then this man murdoch
is more powerful than we thought 
he s becoming like us 
so we must become like him 
the good doctor
has done as we asked 
the life and times
of john murdoch  volume 2 
we must not do this 
murdoch does not possess
these memories  yes 
how will his imprint
allow us to find him 
everywhere he goes   
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us 
and as he follows the clues 
so shall we follow the memories 
perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time  when we t  
yes  poor  poor mr   
we have not forgotten 
if mr  hand wishes to make this sacrifice
for the greater good   
so be it 
but to imprint one of us 
failure has always resulted 
what mr  hand proposes
is our only option 
imprint 
this may sting a bit 
ah 
aah 
 clicking 
ah 
 chuckles 
is it done 
oh  yes  mr  book 
i have john murdoch   in mind 
 johnny   
 i found this postcard
among your mother s things 
 brings back memories 
doesn t it 
 stop by sometime 
 we ll see if we
can t hook ourselves   
 another mermaid 
 love to emma  karl

excuse me  can you tell
me the way to avenue c 
try the subway 
you got a problem  pal 
you  uh  been working here long 
25 years  no days off
for good behavior 
 knocking 
mm  mmm  mm 
mm  mm  mm  mm 
we re looking for john murdoch 
mmm 
shhhh 
girl  ah  ah 
mr  wall 
she knows nothing  mr  hand 
a dead end  yes  mr  wall 
we thought his imprint would
allow us to track him  yes   
but instead we have
been brought here 
this is irrational 
instincts are irrational  mr  wall   
and we must follow
where they lead  yes 
mr  sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar   his job 
he does not care about our job 
indulge us  mr  hand 
if you were murdoch  
yes 
if   
i were murdoch   
i would remember   
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man 
and then   
i would look for a way
to hurt her in return 
  leave me alone with her 
   sobs 
there s work to be done 
announcer  all change  platform 3 
platform 3  all change 
all change  excuse me 
how do i get to the end of the line 
you want the express 
announcer  no trains leave
on platform 7 
  you want platform 2 
  got it  thanks a lot 
hey 
how come that train didn t stop 
that s the express 
there s no way out  you know 
you can t get out of the city 
believe me  i ve tried 
you re murdoch  aren t you 
the one they ve been looking for 
  who are you 
  used to be a cop 
at least  in this life  i was 
they steal people s
memories  you know 
then they swap them around
between us 
i ve seen them do it 
back and forth  back and forth   
till no one knows
who they are anymore 
how do you know all this 
once in a while  one of us wakes up
while they re changing things 
it s not supposed to happen 
but it does 
it happened to me 
they ll come looking for you  murdoch 
just like they ll come looking for me 
but that s ok 
i figured a way out 
 horn blasts 
 people screaming 
they were here 
last night 
this was to be his home 
ah 
that was when we loved her 
this is all well and good  mr  hand   
but we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts 
yes 
and i know where to find her 
we re very lucky 
when you think about it 
emma  i m sorry 
to be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us 
i thought it was more
that we were haunted by them 
perhaps 
but imagine a life   
alien to yours   
in which your memories
were not your own   
but those shared
by every other of your kind 
imagine the torment
of such an existence   
no experiences to call your own 
if it was all you knew   
maybe it would be a comfort 
but if you were to discover
something different   
something   better 
there used to be a ferry
when i was a boy 
biggest thing you ever saw 
lit up like a floating birthday cake 
that s just what my husband
once said to me   
on this very spot 
where is your husband now 
i wish i knew 
what brings you here 
i met my wife at this place 
it s where i first met my husband 
small world

homicide coroner to 1440  east  yeah

 loud clock chime 
 clicking 
 panting 
argh  oh 
mr  murdoch   you ve been
the cause of much distress 
  start talking 
  there s no need for this 
there s no escape 
the city s ours  we made it 
what are you talking about 
we fashioned this city
on stolen memories   
different eras  different pasts
all rolled into one 
each night  we revise it  refine it   
in order to learn 
learn what 
about you  mr  murdoch   
you and your fellow inhabitants   
what makes you human 
  why  
  we need to be like you 
i understand you now  mr  murdoch 
i remember that which you do not   
what you ve been missing 
the ocean  yes   
running along the waves as a child   
meeting emma at the river   
that first kiss that followed 
what are you 
you ve seen what we are 
we use your dead as vessels 
ah  ah

half forgotten childhood memory 
i mean like yesterday 
last week  when

with a single memory 
you can t  can you 
you know something 
i don t think the sun even

i wish i could take it all back

this   affair of yours 
whatever it is   
the thing you re
supposed to have done   
you didn t do it 
i don t believe it ever happened 
what do you mean 
i know this is gonna sound crazy   
but what if we never
knew each other before now 
what if the first time we ever met   
was last night in your  
in our apartment   
and everything you remember   
and everything that i m supposed
to remember never really happened 
someone just wants us to think it did 
you know  back in the apartment   
i suddenly felt like
i didn t know you at all 
it was as if you were a stranger 
but how can that be true 
i so vividly remember meeting you 
i remember falling in love with you 
i remember losing you 
time s up 
no  wait  wait 
please  just   
just one more minute 
i love you  john 
you can t fake something like that 
no  you can t 
 knock on door 
inspector  sir 
detective walenski
killed himself last night 
i  um   kind of thought
you should know 
oh  and   
the chief wanted to see you 
sir   
i knew you d track the killer down  sir 
um   sir   
shoelace 
how can we help you  sir 
you can sleep 
gentlemen  
sleep  sleep 
evening  sir 
bumstead 
i wanted to be the first
to congratulate you   about the case 
take us to murdoch 
sleep 
 chokes 
dr  schreber 
ah 
i knew you d come eventually 
don t you think it s about time
you started giving me some answers 
yes  yes  of course 
won t you please sit down 
i  i come here quite often 
it s one of the few places
i m allowed a moment s peace 
you  you see 
they have an aversion to  to water 
one could almost call it a phobia 
ha ha ha ha 
who are they 
what do they want from me 
right 
well  for now  let s just say   
that you were the subject
of their experiment 
w  we all are 
you re not crazy  john 
and you are not a murderer 
i m sorry about this  i truly am 
but we do not have much time   
and i cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way 
everything you need to know   
all the answers
are in this syringe 
i need you to inject yourself 
it s the only way to
make you understand 
you re kidding me  right 
we re running out of time  john 
you have to do this now 
give me the gun  doctor 
inspector  he is more
disturbed than we thought 
i may not be the judge of personality
that you are  doctor   
but you re the one
who looks disturbed to me 
you do not know
what you are doing 
what  exactly is in this   doctor 
all the answers you ve
been looking for  john 
i swear to you 
uh huh 
guess i ll just have to
hold on to it for   safekeeping 
if you don t mind 
let s go  doctor 
  go  where are we going 
  shell beach 
that s where you want to go  isn t it 
the ocean 
why are you doing this 
what do you hope to gain by helping me 
the truth 
none of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean 
you won t find anything there   
i promise you 
i ve been there  and  
lf you ve been there 
you can show us the way  then  can t you 
we ll see for ourselves 
i won t 
i refuse 
you  you can t make me go there 
ah 
ah 
ah  ah 
you were saying  doctor 
i don t understand 
used to be a bridge here 
try that again 
your friends are gonna be   
fishing you out of the canal 
just don t hurt me 
i ll tell you everything 
it doesn t matter anymore anyway 
what   gasps 
who are you people 
we will give you some more
pretty things soon   anna 
i m not anna 
you will be soon  yes 
i have another use for her first 
first there was darkness 
then came the strangers 
they abducted us
and brought us here 
this city  everyone in it   
is their experiment 
they mix and match
our memories as they see fit   
trying to divine
what makes us unique 
one day  a man
might be an inspector 
the next  someone entirely different 
when they want to
study a murderer for instance   
they simply imprint one of their citizens
with a new personality   
arrange a family for him 
friends  an entire history   
even a lost wallet 
then they observe the results 
will a man  given the history
of a killer  continue in that vein 
or are we  in fact  more
than the mere sum of our memories 
this business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence 
you have had dozens
of lives before now 
you just happened to wake up
while i was imprinting you with this one 
why are they doing all of this 
it is our capacity for individuality   
our souls that makes
us different from them 
they think they
can find the human soul   
if they understand
how our memories work 
all they have
are collective memories 
they share one group mind 
they re dying  you see 
their entire race
is on the brink of extinction 
they think we can save them 
  where do i fit in 
  you are different  john 
you resisted my attempt
to imprint you 
somehow you have developed
their ability to tune 
that is how they change things 
that is how they built this city 
they have machines buried deep
beneath the surface   
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies 
they control everything here 
even the sun 
that s why it s always dark 
they can t stand the light 
so why do they need you 
when they first brought us here 
they extracted what was in us 
so they could store the information 
remix it like so much paint   
and give us back new memories
of their choosing 
but they still needed an artist
to help them 
i understood the intricacies
of the human mind   
better than they ever could   
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist   
because they needed them 
but they made me
delete everything else 
ah  ah 
can you imagine what
it is like being forced   
to erase your own past 
what about my past 
what about my childhood 
shell beach  uncle karl 
what about this 
this was blank when i found it 
you still don t understand  john 
you were never a boy   
not in this place 
your entire history is an illusion 
a fabrication   
as it is with all of us 
you made those drawings
happen with your gift 
you say they brought us here 
from where 
i m sorry 
i don t remember 
none of us remember that   
what we once were   
what we might have been   
somewhere else 
i ve taken you this far 
you don t need me anymore 
let s go 
john 
there is no ocean  john 
there is nothing beyond the city 
the only place home exists   
is in your head 
no  no 
john  stop 
no 
stop 
please 
no 
  aah 
  uhh 
and now you know the truth 
aaah 
aah 
no 
aah 
aaaah 
you ll allow yourself
to surrender  mr  murdoch   
or it will result in
this one s death  yes 
what do i care 
she s not my real wife 
she s nothing to me 
but you do still care 
don t you  mr  murdoch 
you see  i have
become the monster   
you were intended to be 
uhh 
shall i end her life now
as you would have 
don t hurt her  please 
then surrender  mr  murdoch 
sleep 
now 
john 
sleep 
the doctor was right 
he has evolved 
kill him 
kill him 
kill him 
kill him  kill him 
he is powerful  yes 
dangerous  but he can also
lead us to what we seek 
what the doctor calls the soul 
it is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase 
we no longer need
the other subjects 
the time for study is over 
it is time to be one
with john murdoch 
it is time  doctor 
imprint 
shut it down 
shut it down forever 
what are you doing 
they want to imprint you
with their own collective memories 
they want to make you one of them 
so they can share your soul 
imprint  doctor 
no more disobedience 
i m sorry  john 
the pain will only last a moment 
no 
remember  john 
you ll rise to greater
heights than that  my boy 
one day when you re older 
you ll understand 
remember 
 whistle 
that s it  john 
practice makes perfect 
schreber  now remember
what i told you  never talk to strangers 
john  remember 
you re probably wondering why i keep
appearing in your memories 
it is because i have
inserted myself in them 
all of these memories
have been fabricated   
to teach you about the strangers 
give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe 
you will survive  john 
you will find strength
within yourself   
and you will prevail 
remember 
young john  hi  uncle karl 
johnny 
you re getting the hang of it  john 
maybe one day
i ll be working for you 
this is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts 
the machine
that changes their world 
you must take control of it 
you must make the machine yours 
i know you can beat them  john 
but you must concentrate 
something s wrong 
aah 
there is no time for romance  john 
the world can be what you make it 
what have you done 
you have the power
to make anything happen   
but you must act now 
  ahhhhh 
  ahhhhhh 
ahhhhh 
  aaaahhh 
  aaaah 
aah 
aah 
aah 
aah 
  aah 
  aah 
raah 
aah 
 shrill scream 
i knew you could do it  john 
you have their power now 
you control their machines 
where s emma 
she is not emma anymore  john 
she has been reimprinted 
so give her back her memories 
i can t  the facility
where the strangers   
stored the memories
has been destroyed 
i m sorry 
what are you going to do now  john 
you told me i had
the power  didn t you 
i can make these machines
do anything i want 
make this world anything
i want it to be 
just so long as i concentrate
hard enough 
dr  schreber 
where are you going 
shell beach 
  what s the fare 
  quarter

what are you doing 
i m just making a few little changes
around here  is all 
are we sure that s what we want 
i m prepared to take my chances 
i m dying  john 
your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind 
but i wanted to know
what it was like   
how you feel 
you know how i was
supposed to feel 
that person isn t me 
never was 
you wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human 
well  you re not going
to find it   in here 
you went looking
in the wrong place 
it s so beautiful here 
so bright

  what s your name 
  john 
john murdoch 
  when marimba rhythms
start to play  
  dance with me  
  make me sway  
  like a lazy ocean hugs the shore  
  hold me close  
  sway me more  
  like a flower
bending in the breeze  
  bend with me  
  sway with ease  
  when we dance
you have a way with me  
  stay with me  
  sway with me  
  other dancers may be on the floor  
  dear  but my eyes will see only you  
  only you have that
magic technique  
  when we sway i go weak  
  i can hear the sound of violins  
  long before it begins  
  make me thrill
