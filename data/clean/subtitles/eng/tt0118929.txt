thank you for coming to see me

clicking tongue
what is this
squeaks
a rather crude experiment
designed to further my studies
i dont understand
you say youre my husbands doctor
but he never mentioned you to me
the truth is mrs murdoch
john has been coming to
see me for quite some time
he had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal
stemming from your
marital difficulties
john told you what happened
yes
when was the last time
that you saw him
3 weeks ago
he packed a suitcase
he was very angry at me
i understand how difficult
this must be for you
but for johns sake
i would like you
to think of me
as your friend emma
it appears that john has suffered
a psychotic break
complete memory loss
he may be delusional
even violent
emma
if he were to contact you
and i suspect he will
you must call me immediately
do you understand
it is imperative that i be
the first one to reach him
wherever your husband is
he is searching
exhales
for himself
mouse squeaking

inspector bumstead
i came here to file

mrs murdoch

i mean if your husband has been missing
as long as you say
i thought hed simply
walked out on me
then adoctor contacted me
this evening
how long have you been married
nearly four years
hm
why do you ask
because you seem uncomfortable
with your ring
as if you were
unaccustomed to wearing it
no i never take it off
do these names
mean anything to you
no who are these women
why are you looking
for my husband
are you going to accuse him
of something
maybe maybe murder
whose murder
which one
ha ha all of them
mrs murdoch
i am sorry im sorry
i didnt mean to alarm you
im so sorry that i came
just both made a mistake
mrs murdoch if you please

have we met before
lf we did
i hope youre still breathing
whats your name honey
john ha ha

i mean how do you know
im not the killer
you dont seem like
the killer type why
you feeling any urges
i should know about
heh
may sighs
door closes
aw shoot
oh
sign creaking

your unpleasant nature

we might ask
the same question yes
sleep now
wood creaking
aah

clicking
ah
ah
ooph
ah
strange chugging noise
squealing sound
wailing
squelching noise
what is to be done
this man is dangerous
it is said he is able to tune
impossible
we have seen it
with our own eyes
on occasion the imprinting
does not take
they behave erratically
when they awaken
we find them wandering
like lost children
but this one was different yes
what has the doctor
to say about this
he has failed to report in
and mr quick
no more mr quick
mr quick dead yes
poor poor mr quick
mr book does he know
should we not know mr hand
we had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you
we can know nothing
until we possess him
mr night you will take the east
mr face you the west
mr glove the south
mr shade the north
we must have this man
do you really think my husband could be
capable of committing those murders
do you
lets hope for both our sakes
that im wrong
gasps
john
ive been so worried about you
are you punishing me
you know if disappearing
is your way of punishing me
i dont appreciate it
i dont know what
youre talking about
i found these keys in my pocket
so i assume i live here
you supposed to be my wife
supposed to be
john
you really
dont know who i am do you
your doctor called me
he was worried
that this might happen
my doctor
yeah he uh
he gave me his card
hes desperate to find you
schreber
sighs
i feel like im living out
someone elses nightmare
what happened to me
why was i seeing a doctor
i had an affair
you were angry at me
the police are looking for you
i know i saw the papers
killer stalks city streetwalkers
i was with one of those women
before i came here tonight
i dont understand
ii met her outside an automat
i guess i wanted to test myself
i wanted to know if i had it in me
to do those things
maybe i have lost my mind but whoever
i am im still me and im not a killer
i believe you
you do
what
the car outside
the one you arrived in
its a cop
he dropped me off here
sniffs
i didnt know he was still here
mrs murdoch john
hold it right there mister
wait you have the wrong man
stand aside will you please
i didnt kill anyone
right now what you are
is a suspect turn yourself in
ill listen to whatever
you have to say
youre not gonna believe
what i have to say
try me
theres someone after me
theres thisthis group of men
they want me dead
and i dont even know if
theyre not even
yeah whos gonna
listen to a madman
stand aside mrs murdoch
run
no one ever listens to me
murdoch stop
murdoch
how much further
were almost there buddy
hey you happen to know
the way to shell beach
youre kidding me and the missus
spent our honeymoon there
all you gotta do is take
main street west to
or is it the cross
you know thats funny
ii cant seem to remember
if its main street west
or the crosstown
im sorry inspector
i cannot be of more assistance
but i am running late
for an appointment
well i appreciate
your taking the time
theres just one thing
that puzzles me
ive met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work
murdoch doesnt strike me as one
perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough
well i do know when someone
is lying to me doctor
forgive me inspector
but you are not a clinician
judging personalities
happens to be my business
well maybe you could
give me a few pointers
certainly
lets take you for instance
you are a fastidious man driven
consumed by details
i would say your life is
rather lonely
good evening inspector
i really must be going
starts engine
woman closing time
the pool is now closed
dr schreber
most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here
you know how uncomfortable
we find all this
moisture
im sorry i
failed to report in yes
i was frightened
ii have a weak heart you know
your weakness is not we think
an affair of the heart
we found this
in his hotel room
must we reproduce
mr murdochs memories again
i tried to imprint him
but he woke up he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand
i tried to stop him but he was too fast
he has no memories then
only fragments
the procedure it was interrupted
ii guess its only a matter
of rounding him up
you have had strays
before right
this is no stray doctor
this one can tune
but thats impossible
i thought only you had that ability
you will process another template
of the subjects memories yes
of course ill imprint him again
no we require them
for a quite different purpose
its almost midnight
dr schreber
well talk again
after tonights tuning but
no more delays yes
no more inconsistencies
in your behavior
loud noise
you appear quite frail doctor
perhaps some exercise
would do you good
gasps
buzzer
come in
kate
how is he
the same
walenski its me frank
key in lock
come in frank
close the door
ive been looking through
some of your old reports
its an interesting case
the kind that can make
a mans career
or break it
yeah i was on that case
and then what
what happened then eddie
nothing happened frank
ive just been spending time
on the subway riding in circles
thinking in circles
theres no way out
ive been over every inch
of this city
youre scaring your wife
to death eddie
shes not my wife
i dont know who she is
i dont know who any of us are
what makes you say that
do you think about
the past much frank
as much as the next guy
see ive been trying
to remember things
clearly remember things
from my past
but the more i try to think back
the more it all starts to unravel
none of it seems real
its like ive just been
dreaming this life
and when i finally wake up
ill be somebody else
somebody totally different
panting
you saw something
didnt you eddie
something to do with the case
there is no case
there never was
its all just a big joke
its a joke
panting
whirring
man tonights requirements are
12 family photo albums
9 personal diaries
17 love letters
assorted childhood photographs
26 wallets
ids and social security cards
dr schreber
these do bring back memories
this one is still warm
what is it
the recollections of a great lover
a catalog of conquests
we will soon find out
you wouldnt appreciate that
would you mr whatever your name is
not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand
lets see
a touch of unhappy childhood
ahh
a dash of teenage rebellion
and last but not least
a tragic death in the family
mr book doctor
mr book
whoa
aah aah ah ah
why does murdoch not sleep
during the tuning as the others do
i dont know maybe hes a step up
the evolutionary ladder
aa freak of nature
hes adapting to survive
what do you expect
werent you looking for the human soul
thats the purpose
of your little zoo isnt it
thats why you keep changing people
and things around every night
maybe you have finally found
what you are looking for
and its going
to bite you on your
ah
it requires several of your lifetimes
to master our gifts
the idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune
is absurd i know
but what other
explanation is there
clock chiming
it is time
shut it down
horns honking
man get your paper right here
dog barks
its driving me crazy
i cant sleep
and they call my job unskilled

oh
my god you really can do it
i did that
listen to me john
you have their power
you can make things happen
by will alone
they call it tuning that is how they make
the buildings change

of selfdefense a reflex
but i can teach you to control
your power consciously
let me help you john

he attacked me
i dont know where he has gone
come dr schreber
we have much to do
yes
yes
clock ticking
they say that youre
a runaround lover
though you say
it isnt so
but if you put me down
for another
ill know
believe me ill know
cause the night
has a thousand eyes
and a thousand eyes
cant tell but see
if you are true to me
so remember
when you tell those little white lies
that the night
has a thousand eyes
a thousand eyes
applause
man whoo
tonights experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations
the first subject
shall be imprinted here on avenue m
mr book there is aa problem
there is no avenue m
we were unable to complete it
during the last tuning
we detected a lack of control
an opposing influence
on the machines
then this man murdoch
is more powerful than we thought
hes becoming like us
so we must become like him
the good doctor
has done as we asked
the life and times
of john murdoch volume 2
we must not do this
murdoch does not possess
these memories yes
how will his imprint
allow us to find him
everywhere he goes
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us
and as he follows the clues
so shall we follow the memories
perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time when we t
yes poor poor mr
we have not forgotten
if mr hand wishes to make this sacrifice
for the greater good
so be it
but to imprint one of us
failure has always resulted
what mr hand proposes
is our only option
imprint
this may sting a bit
ah
aah
clicking
ah
chuckles
is it done
oh yes mr book
i have john murdochin mind
johnny
i found this postcard
among your mothers things
brings back memories

mmm
shhhh
girl ah ah
mr wall
she knows nothing mr hand
a dead end yes mr wall
we thought his imprint would
allow us to track him yes
but instead we have
been brought here
this is irrational
instincts are irrational mr wall
and we must follow
where they lead yes
mr sleep suggests he may go
to places familiarhis job
he does not care about our job
indulge us mr hand
if you were murdoch
yes
if
i were murdoch
i would remember
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man
and then
i would look for a way
to hurt her in return
leave me alone with her
sobs
theres work to be done
announcer all change platform 3
platform 3 all change
all change excuse me
how do i get to the end of the line
you want the express
announcer no trains leave
on platform 7
you want platform 2
got it thanks a lot
hey
how come that train didnt stop
thats the express
theres no way out you know
you cant get out of the city
believe me ive tried
youre murdoch arent you
the one theyve been looking for
who are you
used to be a cop
at least in this life i was
they steal peoples
memories you know
then they swap them around
between us
ive seen them do it
back and forth back and forth
till no one knows
who they are anymore
how do you know all this
once in a while one of us wakes up
while theyre changing things
its not supposed to happen
but it does
it happened to me
theyll come looking for you murdoch
just like theyll come looking for me
but thats ok
i figured a way out
horn blasts
people screaming
they were here
last night
this was to be his home
ah
that was when we loved her
this is all well and good mr hand
but we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts
yes
and i know where to find her
were very lucky
when you think about it
emma im sorry
to be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us
i thought it was more
that we were haunted by them
perhaps
but imagine a life
alien to yours
in which your memories
were not your own
but those shared
by every other of your kind
imagine the torment
of such an existence
no experiences to call your own
if it was all you knew
maybe it would be a comfort
but if you were to discover
something different
somethingbetter
there used to be a ferry
when i was a boy
biggest thing you ever saw
lit up like a floating birthday cake
thats just what my husband
once said to me
on this very spot

that you were the subject
of their experiment
wwe all are
youre not crazy john
and you are not a murderer
im sorry about this i truly am
but we do not have much time
and i cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way
everything you need to know
all the answers
are in this syringe
i need you to inject yourself
its the only way to
make you understand
youre kidding me right
were running out of time john
you have to do this now
give me the gun doctor
inspector he is more
disturbed than we thought
i may not be the judge of personality
that you are doctor
but youre the one
who looks disturbed to me
you do not know
what you are doing
what exactly is in thisdoctor
all the answers youve
been looking for john
i swear to you
uhhuh
guess ill just have to
hold on to it forsafekeeping
if you dont mind
lets go doctor
go where are we going
shell beach
thats where you want to go isnt it
the ocean
why are you doing this
what do you hope to gain by helping me
the truth
none of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean
you wont find anything there
i promise you
ive been there and
lf youve been there
you can show us the way then cant you
well see for ourselves
i wont
i refuse
youyou cant make me go there
ah
ah
ah ah
you were saying doctor
i dont understand
used to be a bridge here
try that again
your friends are gonna be
fishing you out of the canal
just dont hurt me
ill tell you everything
it doesnt matter anymore anyway
what gasps
who are you people
we will give you some more
pretty things soonanna
im not anna
you will be soon yes
i have another use for her first
first there was darkness
then came the strangers
they abducted us
and brought us here
this city everyone in it
is their experiment
they mix and match
our memories as they see fit
trying to divine
what makes us unique
one day a man
might be an inspector
the next someone entirely different
when they want to
study a murderer for instance
they simply imprint one of their citizens
with a new personality
arrange a family for him
friends an entire history
even a lost wallet
then they observe the results
will a man given the history
of a killer continue in that vein
or are we in fact more
than the mere sum of our memories
this business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence
you have had dozens
of lives before now
you just happened to wake up
while i was imprinting you with this one
why are they doing all of this
it is our capacity for individuality
our souls that makes
us different from them
they think they
can find the human soul
if they understand
how our memories work
all they have
are collective memories
they share one group mind
theyre dying you see
their entire race
is on the brink of extinction
they think we can save them
where do i fit in
you are different john
you resisted my attempt
to imprint you
somehow you have developed
their ability to tune
that is how they change things
that is how they built this city
they have machines buried deep
beneath the surface
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies
they control everything here
even the sun
thats why its always dark
they cant stand the light
so why do they need you
when they first brought us here
they extracted what was in us
so they could store the information
remix it like so much paint
and give us back new memories
of their choosing
but they still needed an artist
to help them
i understood the intricacies
of the human mind
better than they ever could
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist
because they needed them
but they made me
delete everything else
ah ah
can you imagine what
it is like being forced
to erase your own past
what about my past
what about my childhood
shell beach uncle karl
what about this
this was blank when i found it
you still dont understand john
you were never a boy
not in this place
your entire history is an illusion
a fabrication
as it is with all of us
you made those drawings
happen with your gift
you say they brought us here
from where
im sorry
i dont remember
none of us remember that
what we once were
what we might have been
somewhere else
ive taken you this far
you dont need me anymore
lets go
john
there is no ocean john
there is nothing beyond the city
the only place home exists
is in your head
no no
john stop
no
stop
please
no
aah
uhh
and now you know the truth
aaah
aah
no
aah
aaaah
youll allow yourself
to surrender mr murdoch
or it will result in
this ones death yes
what do i care
shes not my real wife
shes nothing to me
but you do still care
dont you mr murdoch
you see i have
become the monster
you were intended to be
uhh
shall i end her life now
as you would have
dont hurt her please
then surrender mr murdoch
sleep
now
john
sleep
the doctor was right
he has evolved
kill him
kill him
kill him
kill him kill him
he is powerful yes
dangerous but he can also
lead us to what we seek
what the doctor calls the soul
it is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase
we no longer need
the other subjects
the time for study is over
it is time to be one
with john murdoch
it is time doctor
imprint
shut it down
shut it down forever
what are you doing
they want to imprint you
with their own collective memories
they want to make you one of them
so they can share your soul
imprint doctor
no more disobedience
im sorry john
the pain will only last a moment
no
remember john
youll rise to greater
heights than that my boy
one day when youre older
youll understand
remember
whistle
thats it john
practice makes perfect
schreber now remember
what i told you never talk to strangers
john remember
youre probably wondering why i keep
appearing in your memories
it is because i have
inserted myself in them
all of these memories
have been fabricated
to teach you about the strangers
give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe
you will survive john
you will find strength
within yourself
and you will prevail
remember
young john hi uncle karl
johnny
youre getting the hang of it john
maybe one day
ill be working for you
this is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts
the machine
that changes their world
you must take control of it
you must make the machine yours
i know you can beat them john
but you must concentrate
somethings wrong
aah
there is no time for romance john
the world can be what you make it
what have you done
you have the power
to make anything happen
but you must act now
ahhhhh
ahhhhhh
ahhhhh
aaaahhh
aaaah
aah
aah
aah
aah
aah
aah
raah
aah
shrill scream
i knew you could do it john
you have their power now
you control their machines
wheres emma
she is not emma anymore john
she has been reimprinted
so give her back her memories
i cant the facility
where the strangers
stored the memories
has been destroyed
im sorry
what are you going to do now john
you told me i had
the power didnt you
i can make these machines
do anything i want

i want it to be
just so long as i concentrate
hard enough

john
john murdoch
when marimba rhythms
start to play
dance with me
make me sway
like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
hold me close
sway me more
like a flower
bending in the breeze
bend with me
sway with ease
when we dance
you have a way with me
stay with me
sway with me
other dancers may be on the floor
dear but my eyes will see only you
only you have that
magic technique
when we sway i go weak
i can hear the sound of violins
long before it begins
make me thrill
