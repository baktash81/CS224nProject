wandered around in it
that s because of this country s
national parks system centers
it s so much in the the national park system
to protect the wildlife 
the forest from thousands of campers coming here
every year
now  i know that my opinion don t mean too much
but  i think if we get any further encroachment on
these park areas
we re going to destroy the natural beauty
of what you are looking at
if the government could somehow manage
to protect these areas 
we just might be able to keep this difficult 
completely american landscape like this forever
never thought you d make it 
i would nt miss a kelly briefing
for the world
alright  this is the largest
post season crowd we ve ever had
there s no way with this crummy crew
that we re going to handle them
what kelly s concerned about is we got more backpackers
pitching tents than raccoons in the woods
okay 
now everybody goes out on patrol
there s no way we can keep an eye
on all those backpackers 
we ll just have to do the best we can
okay  everyone knows where they re supposed to go 
so  so let s deal with it
kelly   
my apologies 
accepted
i m going up to r4
you know  maybe the two of us should go 
it s really loaded up there  kell 
hey  come on
i can use the help
well now  see  hayes called in sick
so i m going to need gail here
to help hold down the fort
we tried 
  look  i ll talk to you later for dinner
  okay
okay  girls  keep it moving
even though the season s closed 
but that s no reason to lit out
if you get any complaints about cold food
i want to hear about them right away
dad 
what are those 
unpaid bills  i believe
aw  i must have put them in the wrong drawer
i ll take care of them right away
and i ve been looking over the wine list
you know  you haven t been charging
nearly enough
look what you ve been paying 
i know what i ve been paying
and 
well  good wine at reasonable prices
brings the customers back
and they ve been coming back
i know you ve had a really good season  but    
allison  for the last two weeks
you ve been trying to help me run my business
that s not true
dad  every man needs
a helping hand
you told me that you were coming up here
to shoot pictures of  the changing seasons 
well  i did  i am 
that s what i ve been doing
yeah  well keeping check on how your old man is doing
is not going to help you meet your deadline
i only got maybe a third to go
i mean  maybe thirty or forty more photographs

he ll wait
allison
why don t you write a how to book
 how to avoid responsibilities 
oh hell  i was supposed to meet you
kelly  i m sorry
well  let s go
see you  walt
it was really sweet of you to come and get me 
i really appreciate it
i should be angry
i mean  i said i d take you around
but  i just might be needed
i m an important person around here
guilty as charged
you know what the problem is 
the problem is you re spoiled
and   your father did it
how long have you known me 
oh  a few weeks
then  why don t you just reserve judgment 
i mean  spoiled is a pretty heavy word
first of all  i don t feel spoiled 
i feel needed
i mean  dad s taking a lot more
than he can handle so  
i feel just a bit torn between career
and father
you know  i think your father can handle
his end
it s yours you should be worried about
somehow i always manage to get it together
at last
 we re here
 finally
we must have walked 10 miles today
we got to do something with this
i want to sit down and get out of these boots
i feel a lot better
what s that 
there s something out there
hey  you scared us
sorry  i didn t mean to
what can we do for you 
stay out of trouble
what kind of trouble 
well  just don t take any unnecesary risks
this is a pretty tricky area
how long you girls going to be up here

most of what i shoot i don t use 
wrong angle  wrong light
wrong faces
no  the faces are never wrong
remember 
every face tells a story
oh yeah 
what story
does this face tell you 
you re desending  
you hide everything behind
that tight jaw
one day it s going to break

how you doing  tom 
hey  where you going 
up to r4

maybe a hundred  hundred fifty yards
let s walk on in
hey  hold it tom 
i m going to check out this shed
what the hell   
find anything 
no
how about you 
no  nothing
tom
yeah 
how far down are you 
ah  about quarter of a mile from the shed
there s just nothing here
i can t tell wether a bear came through or not
well  keep looking
roger  out
we better keep looking
you all doing a hell of a job
you find anything 
 no sir  not a thing
all right  keep at it
remember  we re probably not looking for a full body
kelly   what the hell s going on 
a bear
he attacked and killed a girl
that s all we need  a killer bear on the loose
well  there were two of them 
we haven t found the other one yet
reckon she made it out 
no  too much blood around here for that
well  what you want us to do 
look  i got a bunch of guys up on the western slope
so ah  you guys go on up north
he just might go back up country
check
allison   where are you going 
back here to get another angle on the cam
okay  but don t go too far
hey  kell  
 yeah  
 parker and i came up empty handed
well  look 
get  em back out there
nobody sleeps until we
get that son of a bitch
hey  come on kelly  you can t   
tom we got a killer on our hands 
now no excuses  please
it was a big one alright
it seems to me  
the girls came across the cub 
got too close 
and the mother attacked
they didn t find any sign of a cub
they didn t find a sign of the bear anywhere
well  she ate
and buried the rest of her meal for later
why would she come down 
she came down for food
oh shit  we hauled them up
to the high country last season    
there is more than enough of food
and fish for them up there
maybe she had enough fish
hang on to your sick  doc
it s not sickness 
she was hungry enough
to eat two women
bears don t eat people
this one did
hallitt  do me a favor
just put it in writing for me
who s ah   going to contact the family 
me  i guess
why the hell wasn t i notified 
well  obviously you got the message
i had to hear it on the goddamn radio
hey  i m glad to hear that uh  you turn it on these days
if you ll excuse me  gentlemen
aw  that s okay  hallitt 
i was just leaving
i want to see that report on   
kelly  
okay  let s hear it
what the hell happened out there 
one of our bears got lonesome
it wanted a little action
it s not funny
not supposed to be
what are you going to do 
well  i ve got men out on the field
i put r3 and r4 off limits to campers
and i think we can contain it in that area
okay
this time 
you keep me informed all the way
and when this thing is over with
i want a full investigation
investigation 
what kind of investigation 
we have a responsibility to the public 
i mean it s my head
this bear is supposed to be in the high country
that s where we put it
two possibilities  
either he came back  
or you didn t do your job
no way
we tagged every one of those bears
arthur scott knows
every bear that s in this forest
no way he could have missed one
okay  then scott s the man i want to talk to
now  you get him on the wire
and get his ass down here
kelly 
i hope i m not talking to myself
i read you    loud and clear
we interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin
two young women were savagely killed last night
by what the local authorities believe to be
a large bear
michael kelly  ranger in charge of operations
orders all backpackers in the high country
to evacuate the area immediately
campers in all other areas of the park
should not venture
in the upper regions
until the rangers are certain the bear
has been apprehended
and the areas declared safe
if anyone should see this animal
please contact your local authorities
or the park ranger service immediately
stay tuned to 1060 news for further up to the minute news bulletins
if scottie is not in the office  where is he 
i was on the field  
you mean you   
won t connect me or you can t connect me 
well  you listen to me you little  
i ve got 2 girls  aages 19 to 20
broken to the bone
so don t give me any of your bullshit about regulations
now  you get scottie on that field phone
or you re going to be in the unemployment line tomorrow morning 
you get that 
yeah  i m still here
sit down
no   no   
what the hell s the matter with you down there 
i gave strict orders  
who is this 
it s kelly  scottie  kelly 
kelly  do you know what you just did 
i had a whole family of deer up here
i ve been following them 
living with them
and you scared them off
what happened 
it s a bear   killed two girls  but  
a funny thing happened
is that he buried one of them
but bears do that anyway
they cover their kill in a shallow grave
then they go away 
they come back later and finish eating
look  kittridge is holding you and me responsible  so  
just pack it up and get your carcass
here as fast as you can
alright
who s scott 
he s a naturalist attached to this department
you know 
i think he knows every bear
in this forest personally
you guys really love what  you doing  don t you 
yeah   i do
i really do
it sure has changed my values around
changed your values 
how kelly 
well   
i had a perfect plan for fame and fortune
so what happened 
i took a shortcut
i married this beautiful lady
just by chance she
was filthy rich
trouble was  we were both mercenaries
and after a while  i just wanted out 
i couldn t take it anymore
you left 
well  it was a little more subtle than that
i made believe i was having an affair
got turned around
so i sold all my holdings 
gave to the salvation army 
and became a ranger
that turned her off
you re lying   aren t you 
what do you think 
i really don t care
well  we re down in area 3 already 
i don t think he s going to come down this far
these woods are so damn thick
you can t see anything anyway
yeah  he could be hiding anywhere
well  one thing s for sure
he s not around here
look 
why don t you go over and take a break
i ll go up to powder ridge and check it out
and be back in fifteen minutes
good  i m going to set my feet in the stream
okay
have another drink 
when will i stop remembering 
it should tke about 25 years
jesus   poor tom
he liked her 
didn t he 
there s something i m not doing 
sure  you re not killing the bear
i don t think i m cut out for this
you know what i enjoy 
giving lectures around a campfire    
showing slides    
taking long rides in the woods   
watching the animals
for a man who thought of himself a mercenary
you did pretty fine
oh yeah  there is a killer bear out there
and i m sitting right here crushing ice cubes in my mouth
where the hell is that damn scott 
he ll be here 
and there s nothing else you can do but wait
oh yes there is  except i m too paralyzed
is what it is
you better have another drink
no
how about another ice cube 
yeah
you know don  i want to thank you for helping us out
sure going to make finding that bear a lot easier
maybe s got some kind of favorite cave
no  the reason we can t find him is  
he s moving
and he has a few million acres to cover his tracks
well  if it goes near a clearing
we might just pick him up
can you get this thing any closer 
no   negative
too much downdraft today
it might push it into the trees
feel like i ve been   wearing these things permanently
have you locked into any of its patterns yet 
you know  bears got patterns
patterns  yeah patterns 
he likes women   keeps moving
 sort of like me    
 always trolling
yeah  yeah
what about that fillly you been riding 
oh   i didn t know it was that way now
no offense  my man
hey   take her down 
i think i see something
oh boy  that might be our baby
hold it  kelly 
are you crazy 
what the hell are doing up here 
trying to find your bear 
well you re supposed to be down at camp 
kittridge is been all over me 
you better tell him that man
that bear is not one of ours
  you sure 
  positive 
well you   still should have come on down
why  i can do better on my own
you almost got your tail shot off 
hee hee  almost 
well  if you ain t a big bag of grits
what the hell you d done
if you had caught that big brown 
it isn t a big brown
it s a grizzly 
grizzly 
there ain t no grizzlies up here
i used to hunt these woods for years 
it can t be a grizzly
come on scottie  they were killed off
years ago  big bounty hunt  remember 
this one survived
i   i m telling you 
it can t be
i m telling you we got a grizzly  and thensome
guys  i m a little bushed
can i hitch a ride back with you 
yeah  come on
you know  the average grizzly  he s about 7 feet tall
some are shorter
this one here is at least 15 feet
oh no  maybe in alaska  just maybe 
but not down here
right here 
i just checked the claw marks on the tree
now  that means
he s established his territory    
the whole damn forest 
what you talking about is unreal
wait  i got a little more    
according to the depth of his paw prints
he weighs over 2 thousand pounds
you boys want a bite 
look scottie 
you may be some kind of authority on all this
but what you talking about
is science fiction  a fairy tale 
science  yeah 
fiction  no
see the only known grizzlies that large
were called arctodus ursus horribilis
and they were the mightiest carnivores
in the pleistocene era
well  when was that 
about a million years ago
ah  he s a mere baby then 
ah well  he was a mighty ancestor
that managed to hang in there
what the hell is a million year old grizzly
doing here 
he s looking for food
they were   strictly carnivore  those things
they sure do love meat
well  in that case let s get the hell out of here
no 
no 
stay away from her 
stay away
somebody  help
alright people  step back
let s go now 
go on back to your campsites
we got it here

you said it was in the heights 
i said that 
well  it came down
kelly  this is your baby 
your responsibility
i wash my hands

mr  director 
this is your area
so it s your bear
it is not the case
you have not done your job  scott
you are wrong 
was a grizzly killer on our hands
scott  you re mad
running with these costumes
there are no grizzly 
scott  come  let s go
kelly  i want the fucking bear 
send me the washington reinforcement 
to make it a scandal 
listen  let campers
hang their food 
bears the feel 
end of story 
here  it s different 
this monster eats his victims 
i have to say 
four people were killed 
then stop these ridiculous quarrels
you have enough men available
do your job or i ll take care 
yes  of course
 if there s a bear out there i m going to get him
 not if i get him first
you be careful
you got the ammo  charlie 
yep  i got plenty
we ll flush thet old boy out
easy boys  easy 
don t get rambuctious
damn dogs
hunters
what the hell are they doing out here 
they re probably looking for your bear
who opened up this forest for the hunters  huh 
you know that those clowns they re going to shoot
everything in sight
well  let them 
they might get that old bear for us
yeah  including some of my rangers
let s head back
sheesh  what claws 
my god 
there are chairs in this room
i will not sit    
what do all those hunters out 
i have no choice
you just opened
hunt all the animals of the forest
my instructions are clear 
they hunt a bear
it s not a bear 
it is a grizzly
it s not the same thing
a bear is a bear
a bear is not necessarily a bear 
believe it
you have now
a band of drunks outside
these are not professional hunters
that i can not help it 
there are always a few freaks
i want them out of my forest
this is not your forest 
kelly
these woods are full of campers
not in r3 and r4 sectors
you think they are
on marked trails 
there is no danger
bullshit 
i m done with it
no 
i have a question for you
why are you on my back 
i m glad to hear you say
kelly 
you are a rebel
there is no room here for the rebels
listen up  kittridge    
while glandiez on your fat ass    
i invested this forest
ã cout   
no  you listen to me 
these hunters are in my area
and i take care of them
as i see fit
try and stop me 
scottie  wake up
  tom 
  yes
  you okay 
  fine
bastard got a hold of a hunter 
he managed to get away
where is he 
over at the clinic
he s really beat up
he was also one lucky hunter
yeah
okay  let s go
hey scottie  will you take that over
to pick up his stuff
load in some extra rifles 
we ll need em 
i was feeling unloved
well  so was i
glad you stopped by 
we re just getting ready to take off
i m coming with you
look  it s a butcher shop out there
and you just couldn t handle it
i couldn t 
alright  maybe i couldn t handle it
look  i ll stay out of your way
honey  it s not safe out there 
and i don t want to see you get hurt
i mean  for both our sakes
is that a line that s supposed
to make me feel grateful 
i don t feel like playing little boy girl games
you just said the wrong thing 
right  well just pack it up 
you re not coming with me
damn  kelly 
i m glad you see it my ways
really 
this just might be that old grizzly s cub
no way
it s possible
hey  hey listen   
that thing might come in here after that cub
let s get him outta here
he s right 
put him back in the wood
hey  i got an idea
we ll use this cub as bait
we ll take it back in there 
find us a clearing  
we ll go in the blind  
when mama comes back   
pow 
it s a lot different from deer hunting
yeah  that damn thing fights back
hey  we gonna have to hold the noise down 
damn thing won t come around
shh
whose stupid idea was it
to use that cub as live bait 
it was mine
now  that s the kind of bait we need to use  kelly
it really doesn t make any
difference anymore  does it
anybody see it happen 
nah  she just grabbed up the cub 
that was it
we know one thing for sure
what s that 
our grizzly is a he instead of she
now  how the hell you know that 
you been peeking 
don t have to 
only the males are cannibalistic
they ll eat a cub if they are hungry
yeah but  
does that help us any 
sure does 
he s going to retrace his route
that means he s going to come back
the scene of his crime
so then  he ah  
could still be around here
he could be listening to us right now
well  if that s the case
maybe we can flush him out
can we help 
yeah  but we go by the book
everyone follows orders
call the shots  mister
what s your name 
pat
okay pat  you and the rest of the guys
go up the north ridge
that s ah   pinto pass
i know where it is
alright  we re going to spread
and hold  the line at culvert basin
now  if he comes down    
that s were he s coming down
hey listen 
you ole boys come down that ridge
and make like a war party 
make a lot of noise  will you
maybe that crazy will head towards us
alright  we ll expect you to be in place
and ready to go at  ah  
 daybreak 
 well  let s get with it
okay
tom  you re not going to be coming with us
what 
you re not leaving me out of this  man 
no way
we re not leaving you out of anything 
i m assigning you to arrow tower
don t do me any favors
look  i can handle myself down here
look  cool off and listen
now  you know how thick it is down there
now  from up there
you might be able to spot it 
and you might get a crack at it
yeah  and i might just get left out
of all this damn thing
tom  
you re not going to be left out of anything
okay 
wish the hell it would hurry up
and get daylight
it won t be much longer
tom 
it s still a little bit chilly this morning  though 
ain t it 
yes 
sort of cool for this time of year  anyway
  come on
  alright
let s go
let s keep it quiet  okay
kelly  i  d like to have the first shot
well  i can t promise you that
see  we got a grizzly out there
that s at least 15 feet tall
weighs maybe 2  3 thousand pounds  right
i want to capture it
you what 
you want to capture it 
that s right
he s not kidding
i ve been developing these
brand new tranquilizing shells
oh christ   
that shell won t penetrate
a hair of its chinny chin chin
not trying to kill him with it  mister 
just want to put him to sleep
oh yeah well    that s fine 
but first you got to knock him down 
that baby won t do it
we ll see about that
i sure hope you ain t out there alone
you re liable to become its friends
i figure  that old grizzly s hungry
by now
for a while  i told you he just ate the cub 
i doubt if he s hungry now
oh yeah 
well  that was merely an appetizer 
my man
i figure that old grizzly got his taste
for human flesh and he s eating
nothing else
that s pretty ridiculous
it is  huh 
well  let me tell you a little story  boy
a long time ago this tribe of indians
came into these woods
they s was all laid down with the pox  uhh
something i can t remember  
anyway  this herd of grizzlies
smelled them out
they come in  they ate  em
they tore them all up
little children  
the sick   everybody
there s a few braves just
healthy enough to go out on the hunt
they came back  
and the grizzlies turned on themed
so  they had a new situation
a whole herd of man eating grizzlies
was just parading around
tearing up the indians
that s pretty hard to believe
unless you happened to be one of them indians
kelly
i can still root him out my own way
hell  i can look like him  
i can smell like him
now  give me a chance 
let me go in
you got a dime 
i m going to call his mama 
i mean  does your mama know that you re running
around out here in the woods trying to act like a bear  
smell like one 
you scratching around on the ground like one 
i mean  does she know that you re making
a damn fool of yourself  
you re chasing something about the size
of a v8 cat with teeth 
you know  i think your mama would be a little disappointed
maybe
but not nearly as disappointed
as she would be if she had you for a son
sonny 
scottie
scottie 
who spotted him first 
you get a crack at him
but i don t want
you going out in those woods alone
post  here
you see anything moving out there at all 
only your hunters tearing up the forest
well  keep looking 
he has to be out there someplace
jesus
it s the grizzly 
hold on tom  just hold on 
we re on our way
come on don
we re there   we re almost there
   how the bear thing is being handled 
okay  i guess 
i mean  they kept the bear away from here    
if that s what counts
i surely feel sorry for that
poor forest ranger  though
yeah  i think we all feel the same way
i m sorry
so am i
is there anything i can do 
no  he had a family
send some flowers
i ve got a plan
but i need time and men
kelly  i m not   
listen 
just listen to me
he got tom here
now  his first  
his first killing took place up here
he circled and killed  
circled and killed  
he circled and found and killed gail here
and he circled again 
got behind us  
  and killed tom
now  i think he s gonna continue heading down
looking for human food
that thing seems to  
  know what we re thinking
now  i d like to get the jump on him this time
a grizzly is an animal  kelly 
don t give him human qualities
he s not even listening to you  kelly
see  he doesn t understand that we re dealing with a  
  highly intelligent beast
scottie  
scottie 
will you take that sandwich outside and eat it
please 
charley 
close the park
and give me another crack at it
there is no need   to close the park
do you know that there are more  
more reporters out there and tv cameramen  
  than there are animals in this goddamn circus
i invited them
you invited them 
i want them to see the kind of clean 
thorough job that we are capable of doing
you re kidding 
we have five dead people 
one raving  almost dead man
and you call that   clean 
we are doing everything i   
bullshit 
kelly 
you know  i just figured you out
you don t give a good goddan if we
get that grizzly or not
as long as you get your press
so you can go to washington and
get one of those nice dark brown plastic offices
get out 
well  you just lost your office
 cause when i m finished with you  
  there s not gonna be anybody there
waiting to shake your gooshy  bloody hand 
you are finished  dismissed  removed 
in your   
does not
the weight of the world on your shoulders    
they are not wide enough
yeah  i mean    
what they know these fighters 
the rangers know hunting
you know what  scottie 
you know the real kick
i could do with this property 
finally  if it was a private property    
i would divide while plots
do what you want
if you want to give up 
that s your problem 
scottie  do me a favor
go back home
i have this grizzly
what 
you heard me
stay out of the forest
what for 
this is not just a job for me
the forest is like home
i love it and i ll find it
you re crazy  completely crazy
it s possible
meanwhile  you can stay here 
and whining about your little pride
not to mention your scotch
i m going to find our ursus horribilis
robert  you stay close now   you hear 
do you hear me 
yes  ma am
mommy
