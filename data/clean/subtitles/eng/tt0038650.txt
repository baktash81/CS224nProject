and something important 
you know  george

his own roof and walls and fireplace 
and we re helping him get those things 
in our shabby little office 
i know  pop  i  uh  i  i know that i  i

i know you re anxious to make a train 
i have a taxi waiting downstairs 
i want the board to know that george 
gave up his trip to europe
to help straighten 
things out here these past few months 
good luck to you at school  george 
  thanks 
  good luck  so long 
now we come to the real purpose 
of this meeting   
to appoint a successor 
to our dear friend  peter bailey 
mr  chairman  
i d like to get to my real purpose 
  wait just a minute now 
  wait for what 
i claim this institution is not necessary 
to this town 
therefore  mr  chairman  
i make a motion to dissolve this institution
and turn its assets and liabilities over 
to the receiver 
potter  you dirty  contemptible   
i ll wring his neck  so help me  
george 
  you hear what that buzzard   
  mr  chairman 
it s too soon after peter bailey s death to talk 
about chloroforming the building and loan 
peter bailey died three months ago 
i second mr  potter s motion 
very well  in that case  i ll ask the 
two executive officers to withdraw 
but before you go 
i m sure the whole board wishes 
to express its deep sorrow
  at the passing of peter bailey 
  thank you very much 
it was his faith and devotion that are 
responsible for this organization 
i ll go further than that 
i ll say that to the public  peter 
bailey was the building and loan 
oh  that s fine  potter  coming from you 
considering that you probably drove 
him to his grave 
peter bailey was not a business man 
that s what killed him  oh  i don t mean 
any disrespect to him  god rest his soul 
he was a man of high ideals  so called 
but ideals without common sense 
can ruin this town 
now  you take this loan here to ernie 
bishop   
you know  that fellow that sits around 
all day on his brains in his taxi  you know 
i happen to know the bank turned down 
this loan  but he comes here
and we re building him a house 
worth five thousand dollars 
  why 
  well  i handled that  mr  potter 
you have all the papers there 
his salary  insurance  
i can personally vouch for his character 
  a friend of yours 
  yes  sir 
you see  if you shoot pool with 
some employee here 
you can come and borrow money 
what does that get us 
a discontented  lazy rabble 
instead of a thrifty working class 
and all because a few starry eyed 
dreamers like peter bailey
stir them up and fill their heads 
with a lot of impossible ideas 
  now  i say   
  just a minute  just a   
just a minute  
now  hold on  mr  potter 
you re right when you say my father 
was no business man  i know that 
why he ever started this cheap penny ante 
building and loan  i ll never know 
but neither you nor anybody else can say 
anything against his character 
because his whole life was   
why  in the twenty five years since 
he and uncle billy started this thing 
he never once thought of himself  
isn t that right  uncle billy 
he didn t save enough money 
to send harry to school  let alone me 
but he did help a few people 
get out of your slums  mr  potter 
and what s wrong with that 
why   here  
you are all businessmen here 
doesn t it make them better citizens  
doesn t it make them better customers 
you   you said that uh   
what d you say just a minute ago   
they  they had to wait and save their money 
before they even thought of a decent home 
wait  wait for what 
until their children grow up 
and leave them 
until they re so old 
and broken down that they   
do you know how long it takes a working 
man to save five thousand dollars 
just remember this  mr  potter  
that this rabble you re talking about   
they do most of the working and paying 
and living and dying in this community 
well  it is too much to have them work 
and pay and live and die
in a couple of decent rooms 
and a bath 
anyway  my father didn t think so 
people were human beings to him 
but to you  a warped  
frustrated old man  they re cattle 
well  in my book  he died a much 
richer man than you ll ever be 
i m not interested in your book  
i m talking about the building and loan 
i know very well what you re talking about 
you re talking about something you can t 
get your fingers on  and it s galling you 
that s what you re talking about  i know 
well  i  i  i ve said too much 
i    you re  you re the board here  
you do what you want with this thing 
there s j just one thing more though 
this town needs this measly 
one horse institution
if only to have some place where people 
can come without crawling to potter 
come on  
uncle billy 
sentimental hogwash  
i want my motion 
oh boy  that was telling him  
george  old boy 
you shut his big mouth  
you should have heard him 
what happened  
we heard a lot of yelling 
well  we re being voted out of business 
after twenty five years 
easy come  easy go 
here it is  
 help wanted   female  
you still want me hang around  george 
yeah  i ll be right down 
hey  you ll miss your train 
you re a week late for school already  
go on 
  what s going on in there 
  oh  never mind  don t worry about that 
they re putting us out of business  
so what 
i can get another job  
i m only fifty five

  go on  go on 
hey  look  you gave up your boat trip  
now you don t want to miss college  too  do you 
george  
george 
they voted potter down  
they want to keep it going 
  whoopee 
  you did it  george  you did it 
but they got one condition  
only one condition 
  what s that 
  that s the best part of it 
they ve appointed george here as 
executive secretary to take his father s place 
oh  no  
but  uncle billy   
you can keep him on  
that s all right 
as secretary you can hire anyone you like 
dr  campbell  now let s get this thing straight 
i m leaving  
i m leaving right now 
i m going to school  
this is my last chance 
uncle billy here  he s your man 
but  george  they ll vote with potter otherwise 
i know  i know  he didn t go 
that s right 
not only that  but he gave his school money 
to his brother  harry  and sent him to college 
harry became a football star 
made second team all american 
yeah  but what happened to george 
george got four years older  
waiting for harry to come back
and take over the building and loan

i ve just guaranteed the bank 
sufficient funds to meet their needs 
they ll close up for a week 
and then reopen 
he just took over the bank 
i may lose a fortune  
but i m willing to guarantee your people too 
just tell them to bring their shares over here  
and i will pay fifty cents on the dollar 
aw  you never miss a trick  do you  potter 
well  you re gonna miss this one 
if you close your doors before six p m   
you will never reopen 
george  was it a nice wedding  
gosh  i wanted to be there 
yeah   
you can take this one off now 
now  just remember that this thing isn t 
as black as it appears 
i have some news for you folks 
i was just talking to old man potter 
and he s guaranteed cash payments at the bank 
the bank s going to reopen next week 
but  george  i got my money here 
did he guarantee this place 
well  no  charlie  
i didn t even ask him 
  we don t need potter over here 
  i ll take mine now 
no  but you   you   
you re thinking of this place all wrong 
as if i had the money back in a safe 
the  the money s not here 
well  your money s in joe s house   
that s right next to yours 
and in the kennedy house  and mrs  macklin s 
house  and  and a hundred others

house built in this town 
he s already got charge of the bank  
he s got the bus line 
he s got the department stores  
and now he s after us 
why

joe  you had one of those potter houses  
didn t you  well  have you forgotten 
have you forgotten what he charged 
for that broken down shack

do you think potter would have let you keep it 
ca can t you understand 
what s happening here

congressman black is here to see you 
oh  tell the congressman to wait 
go on 
fifteen years ago  a half dozen houses 
stuck here and there 
there s the old cemetery  squirrels  
buttercups  daisies 
i used to hunt rabbits there myself 
look at it today 
dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw 
ninety per cent owned by suckers 
who used to pay rent to you 
your potter s field  my dear mr  employer  
is becoming just that 
and are the local yokels making with 
those david and goliath wisecracks 
oh  they are  are they 
even though they know the baileys 
never made a dime out of it 
you know very well why 
the baileys were all chumps 
every one of these homes is worth twice 
what it cost the building and loan to build 
  if i were you  mr  potter   
  well  you are not me 
as i say  it s no skin off my nose 
but one of these days this bright young man 
is going to be asking george bailey for a job 
the bailey family has been a boil 
on my neck long enough 
  yes  sir 
  come in here 
we just stopped in town to take a look 
at the new factory  and then
  we re going to drive on down to florida 
  oh   
  why don t you have your friends join us 
  why  sure 
hey  why don t you kids drive down 
with us  huh 
oh  i m afraid i couldn t get away  sam 
still got the nose to the old grindstone  eh 
jane  i offered to let george in on the ground 
floor in plastics and he turned me down cold 
  oh  now don t rub it in 
  i m not rubbing it in 
well  i guess we better run along 
awfully glad to have met you  mary 
  nice meeting you 
  goodbye 
  goodbye  george 
  so long  george 
  see you in the funny papers 
  goodbye  sam 
  so long  mary 
  so long  sam  have fun 
thanks for dropping around 
florida  
hee haw 
hee haw                              
thank you  sir 
quite a cigar  mr  potter 
you like it  
i ll send you a box 
well  i  uh  i suppose 
i ll find out sooner or later 
but just what exactly did you want 
to see me about 
george  now that s just 
what i like so much about you 
george  i m an old man  
and most people hate me 
but i don t like them  either  
so that that makes it all even 
you know  just as well as i do  
that i run practically everything in this town
but the bailey building and loan 
you know  also  that for a number of years 
i ve been trying to get control of it or kill it 
but i haven t been able to do it 
you have been stopping me 
in fact  you have beaten me  george 
and as anyone in this county 
can tell you  that takes some doing 
take during the depression  
for instance 
you and i were the only ones 
that kept our heads 
you saved the building and loan  
i saved all the rest 
yeah  well  most people say 
you stole all the rest 
the envious ones say that  
george  the suckers 
now  i have stated my side very frankly 
now  let s look at your side 
young man  twenty seven  twenty eight  
married  making say   forty a week 
  forty five 
  forty five  forty five 
out of which  
after supporting your mother
and paying your bills  you re able to keep  
say ten  if you skimp 
a child or two comes along  and you 
won t even be able to save the ten 
now  if this young man of twenty eight 
was a common 
ordinary yokel  
i d say he was doing fine 
but  george bailey is not a common  
ordinary yokel 
he s an intelligent  
smart  ambitious young man 
who hates his job  who hates the building 
and loan  almost as much as i do 
a young man who s been dying to get 
out on his own ever since he was born 
a young man   the smartest one 
of the crowd  mind you 
a young man who has to sit by and 
watch his friends go places 
because he s trapped 
yes  sir  trapped into frittering his life away  
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters 
do i paint a correct picture  
or do i exaggerate 
oh  what s your point  mr  potter 
  my point  my point is  i want to hire you 
  hire me 
i want you to manage my affairs  
run my properties 
george  i ll start you out at 
twenty thousand dollars a year 
 nbsp 
twenty thous   
twenty thousand dollars a year 
you wouldn t mind living 
in the nicest house in town 
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes 
a couple of business trips to new york 
a year  maybe once in a while europe 
you wouldn t mind that  
would you  george 
would i 
y you re not talking to somebody else 
around here  are you 
you know  th this is me  you remember me  
george bailey 
oh  yes  george bailey  
whose ship has just come in 
provided he has enough brains 
to climb aboard 
holy mackerel 
well  how about the building and loan 
oh  confound it  man  
are you afraid of success 
i m offering you a three year contract at 
twenty thousand dollars a year  starting today 
is it a deal  or isn t it 
well  mr  potter  i   
i   i know i ought to jump 
at the chance but i   i just  uh 
i i wonder if if it would be possible for you 
to give me twenty four hours to think it over 
sure  sure  sure 
you go on home 
and talk about it to your wife 
  i d like to do that 
  yeah 
in the meantime  
i ll draw up the papers 
  all right  sir 
  okay  george 
okay  mr  potter 
 nbsp 
no  no  no  no  wait a minute here  
wait a minute 
i don t need twenty four hours  
i  i don t have to talk to anybody 
i know right now  
and the answer is no  no 
doggone it 
you sit around here 
and you spin your little webs
and you think the whole world revolves 
around you and your money 
well  it doesn t  mr  potter 
in the   in the whole 
vast configuration of things 
i d say you were nothing 
but a scurvy little spider 
you   and that goes for you  too 
and it goes for you  too 
if you wouldn t mind living 
in the nicest house in town 
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes 
going to new york on a business trip 
a couple of times a year 
maybe to europe once in a while 
i know what i m going to do tomorrow
and the next day and next year 
and the hear after that 
i m shaking the dust of this crummy little town  
off my feet  and i m going to see the world
and then i m going to build things  
i m going to build air fields 
i m going to build skyscrapers 
a hundred stories high 
i m going to build a bridge a mile long 
what is it you want 
mary  what  y you want the moon
