sleep in the bathtub again
gerry
oh no i dont know what i said
you said it you know you said it
no i dont know what i said
but i didnt mean it
you mean everything you say
sometimes i mean nothing
when i say something
something is never nothing
its always something
most of what i say is nothing
just something to say
men say its just something to say
to get away with saying something
but they know theyre saying something
say what what did i say
you said at my mothers you
would have a baby but im not ready
to my mother you might as well
have said im a lesbian
well i am the only man you ever had
oh i dated timmy harrison
for four months before i met you
isnt he a woman now
aah
you told my mother
i didnt want children
i did not i didnt say that
yes you did
yes you did you said exactly that
i did not
i didnt say that you werent ready to
have a baby i said that you wanted to wait
which means i dont want one right now
right
thank you
wait a minute im confused
can i get a ruling on this
no youre not confused
youre just wrong
holly doesnt wanna have a baby
we had a plan gerry
to wait to have children
until we could buy an apartment
put 25 percent of each paycheck
into a separate joint account
with a 625 interest for 5 years
why didnt you tell my mother that
hahaha each paycheck
darling you only just started
getting regular paychecks
you quit five jobs in two years remember
well i cant work for idiots
they cant all be idiots
yes they can
they can all be idiots
and why didnt you tell my mother
about the business loan you and john
took out without asking me
oh aha
you see you you finally said it
i knew thats why youre angry
thats not the reason
it is not the reason
it is the reason
we should have waited
waited for what what
ive been driving limos for four years holly
so john and me we wanna start a business
we buy a few cars we get a few clients
thats a career right there
what is your problem
what if it doesnt work
what if we always have to live here
and what about what i want huh
you think
i wanna be a real estate agent
showing apartments to buy
that i can never live in
there may be other things
i wanna do with my life

cranky at home every bloody day anyway

in a fivefloor walkup we can barely move
in id change diapers on the windowsill
you have to have a plan you cant act like
everythings just gonna work out by itself
why do i have to be
the responsible grownup who worries
why cant i be the cute carefree
irish guy who sings all the time
because you cant sing
without making dogs bark
holly grunts
look holly people have babies

i know what youre really saying
even when you dont say it
you mean the two conversations thing
the one were having
and the one you think were having
you said that to my mother because youre
mad at me for not wanting children yet
and because im no fun anymore and
we dont have enough hot nasty sex
because im always bitching about bills
why dont you just be honest and say it
say what you mean
all right
i wish we had more hot nasty sex
or the other kind is fine
what youre really saying is this
isnt the life you wanted is it
well thats not what im saying
is that what youre saying
and what if this is it gerry
what if this is all there is to our life

yankees too and i lost my fiancée last year
really
yeah she slept with my best friend
she left me
oh
my best friend was a woman
oh
her last words to me were id still
be with you if you werent a man
and im like
well castrating me is definitely the first
step toward achieving that particular goal
its still my fault i introduced them
i always had this fantasy about making love
to two women at the same time
except in my fantasy i was still
in the bed for the second and third time
sorry
then thisll make you feel great
the best friend that my exfiancée slept
with was my exexfiancée
and she was my business partner and
we started the business with my money
so i ended up losing the business
my partner and my fiancée
howd you get over that
i went through like
a major hooker phase all year
but that didnt help
no it helped a lot
i just started to run out of money
its actually a lot cheaper to date
do you think that youre gonna ever find
another woman to love

the women that i want the most
thats not true
no

to honor the dead
you know show them
how well were doing
im sorry i always bring him up
yeah im starting to get
a little bit sick of it
woman laughing
chuckles
now thats a real honesttogoodness
couple right there
theyve probably been together
since the flood
were so arrogant arent we
were so afraid of age
we do everything we can to prevent it
we dont realize what a privilege it is
to grow old with someone
someone who doesnt drive you
to commit murder
or doesnt humiliate you beyond repair
its sweet
chuckles
its good huh
laughs
holly can i ask you a favor
daniel sure
i started bagging up gerrys stuff
couldnt finish
i think i need someone who
didnt know him to get rid of it all
daniel
be happy to help you get rid of gerry
do you have to say it like that
like what
what is wrong with you take a pill
nothing what
whats wrong
nothing i
ive just never been alone with another
man in this apartment besides gerry
want me to stand out in the hall
you can just throw me the boxes

holly
its a trip
gerry planned the whole thing
for me and sharon and denise
you think its the best time to vacation
gerry made all the arrangements
i have to go
have you spoken to daniel thought you
two were spending time together
were just friends mom
ive stood by and not said anything about
all this but now i think its time it stopped
what do you mean
its not healthy
gerrys not gonna be able
to keep this up forever is he
his life ended and so will his letters
youre gonna have to face
things on your own
it was a gift from gerry
and how can you say that
my husband was 35 years old
he wasnt supposed to die
but he did it was awful
its what happens
but his death is a part of your life now
and you have to deal with it
stop saying that
like im not dealing with it i am
how by waiting for a letter
from a dead husband
taking a vacation when your father left
i had two children to support
excuse me for not having any children
thats not how i meant it and you know it
your father leaving
was just as devastating
but i did what i needed to do
and got on with it
its not the same thing
why not
my husband died he was taken
he didnt wanna go he didnt wanna leave
yes my husband wanted to leave
and its so much easier
being abandoned by choice is it
ive had my say
i wont say anymore
so wheres he sending you
indistinct chatter
car door closes

its not really a fort
its just a stone wall
he used to call it that when he was little
he goes on about other things

he hadnt much strength in the end
though did he
makes me sick to think
we werent there when he died
for the funeral

maybe youll come and visit us a bit more
now that hes gone eh
martin dont put that on her
youre under no obligation

quite got over the idea either
yeah well you were both so young
and it happened too fast

i told you my mom didnt hate your guts
well you know anymore
you are now standing in my fort
where i did all my big thinking
this is where i stood thinking about you
after the very first time we met
you didnt look real to me at first
i never saw so many colors
on one girl before
but you looked like
you belonged out there all right
you and all your colors

that way
chuckling

i think you quite enjoy this getting lost
dont you
you know actually
i dont mind so much not here

oh on my way home college trip
we started in greece
jesus thats a long walk
thats a bad joke
what are you studying
art yeah
art
oh so youre an artist then
oh i dont know yet
thats great
chuckling
do you make anything or
i dont know yet
both chuckling
well good luck with that
oh
you
would you mind if we walked together
since were going in the same direction
ill stay on this side of the road
dont even have to talk just
just quite nice sometimes walking
along with someone without talking
once you get your feet wet
gerry
at first the notalking thing didnt last
before long i couldnt get you to shut up
but you were so cute trying to impress me
with william blake and all your grand plans
i had no idea
what you were talking about
but i couldnt help
loving the way you talked
i must create a
somethingor be enslaved
by another mans something
wait i will not
grunts
i will not reason or compare
my business is to create
something oh god
did you just make that up then
no its william blake
but i completely screwed it up
no you didnt you made it better
i understood it
gerry
i didnt have a clue actually
all i know is if you dont figure out the
something youll just stay ordinary
and it doesnt matter if its a work of art
or a taco or a pair of socks
just create something new
and there it is
and its you out in the world
outside of you
and you can look at it or hear it
or read it or feel it
and you know
a little bit more about you
a little bit more than anybody else does
does that make any sense at all
yeah
youre saying you want to paint socks
maybe
chuckles
gerry
i loved you right then and there
holly
hey i like this jacket
gerry
it looks good on you got it on a bet
what was the bet
heh
i was a few guinnesss
for the worse at this point
but a fella bet me
that i couldnt get a certain girl
to kiss me without a provocation
what girl
his girl
oh haha
uhhuh haha
howd you do it
theres nothing to it really
a fella just has to tell a woman
the truth without words
its like a signal you send out
the woman she just picks it up
and whats the truth
that kissing her would be
the end of life as i know it
wow
and thats true of every girl
youve gotten to kiss you
gerry laughs
i could turn it on and off when i was
younger and i had no principles
when every girl that i was lucky enough
to kiss was the end of life as i knew it
and now
now i only send it out when i think
she might be the one that makes it true
i know where i am now
thanks it was really nice to meet you
no i could walk you into town
oh no its okay
i know where i am
i know where im going
ill never forget this
your jacket
dog barking
no wait
whispering
wait wait dont move
what
oh yeah its a wild irish dog
a what
shh
you have to stand still
okay
get close like one person
and if we separate hell feel
threatened and attack our vital parts
what vital parts all my parts are vital
shh shh
barking then growling
gerry
we have to stand still
now just let him sniff around a bit
sniffing
gerry
now wait
whispering
im really scared
would you put
your arms around me
all right
yeah thats probably a good idea
yeah
dog panting
do you think we could turn around and
face each other without freaking him out
ahh okay sure
but lets move very slowly okay
okay
ow
oh sorry
i havent done this in a while
ive been seeing this boy
but we dont do much i dont know why
maybe its me
no hes a boy who
doesnt know anything about kissing
thats a mans business

have to win because
if we do meet again then thatll be
the end of it you know
the end of what
life as we know it
chuckles
look im singing at this pub
no no no dont tell me
if i happen to walk into the right one
in the right town

through this all
so you havent thought about me
in the nude
no
not once
no
not even without my shirt
gerry stop it

somebody the way you felt about gerry
or do you have to wait for a letter

where you going
i really like you
but i cant be the invisible man
im tired of being the shoulder
i want to be another body part you need
you know i wanna be
the bad guy
i want a woman to go crazy over me
and then i wanna use her up
until shes ruined for all other men
you dont wanna do that
no i dont wanna do that but i would
sighs
id like to date a woman
who actually likes men

indistinct chattering
take a break will you
mom
whats the matter
breathing heavily
sobbing
come on
come on
what happened
when when daddy left
i was 14 and i said
thats it never again no man
and then i meet gerry
this wonderful man happens to me
and then and then
and then he died
what was the point
i know honey
im so angry i could kill somebody
im alone and
it doesnt matter what job i have
or what i do or what i dont do
or what friends i have hes not here
im im not here
i mean youre alone no matter what

sobbing
you know i didnt come here for you
to give me some bullshit honest answer
why cant you lie to me just once
im sorry sweetheart
i cant breathe i cant breathe
shh come on
lets go for a walk
patricia
your father and i used to come here
they had dances
well not really dances
wed come with radios and cigarettes
and drink beer and listen to jimi hendrix
i bet youve had a hard time walking into
a room full of people on your own right
yeah i know that
i know what it is not to feel like youre in
the room until he looks at you
or touches your hand or even makes
a joke at your expense
just to let everyone know
youre with him
youre his
god that man could make me laugh
daddy
laughing
i dont ever remember you laughing
well that makes me sad
because i did
i did
did you hate gerry because
he reminded you of dad
a little
sighs
you know the worst thing for a parent
second after losing a child
watching your child head for
the same life you had
and you cant stop it
its a terrible helpless feeling
makes you angry all the time
and ive been angry
a very long time
sighs
im exhausted
do you think well ever see dad again
no sweetheart
never
so you have to stop waiting
you
i have to say i was impressed by how
he worked everything out ahead of time
every delivery schedule
the mailbox key
getting that leather jacket out
of your apartment wasnt easy
with you acting like miss havisham
he made me promise
i couldnt say no
i told him i didnt think
it was good for you but
i couldnt say no
its the last one
so all alone or not
you gotta walk ahead
thing to remember is
if were all alone
then were all together in that too
it helps me sometimes
answering machine beeps

dear holly i dont have much time
i dont mean literally i mean youre out
buying ice cream and youll be home soon
but i have a feeling this is the last letter
because theres only one thing
left to tell you
it isnt to go down memory lane
or make you buy a lamp
you can take care of yourself
without any help from me
its to tell you how much you move me
how you changed me
you made me a man
by loving me holly
and for that i am eternally grateful
literally
if you can promise me anything
promise me that whenever youre sad
or unsure
or you lose complete faith
that youll try and see yourself
through my eyes
thank you for the honor
of being my wife
im a man with no regrets
how lucky am i
you made my life holly
but im just one chapter in yours
therell be more
i promise
so here it comes the big one
dont be afraid to fall in love again
watch out for that signal
when life as you know it ends
ps i will always love you
have you thought about this
about me i mean
have you
yeah
this isnt gonna work is it
no way no how
damn

laughing
oh wow
i mean that was like kissing my sister
im so relieved
hahaha
i got this letter and i thought he must have
been feeling selfsacrificing
but hes really full of crap
if he meant it hed give me a sign
i hate signs
then i got your message on the machine
sighs
weird bitter friends

sighs
whats wrong friend

its been a year
and i dont feel him
around me anymore
i dont think hes here anymore
i think gerrys gone
whispers
hes really gone
holly
dear gerry you said you wanted me
to fall in love again
and maybe one day i will
but there are all kinds of love out there
this is my one and only life
and its a great and terrible
and short and endless thing
and none of us come out of it alive
i dont have a plan except
that its time my mom laughed again

taking her back to where we started
