gerry 
oh  no  i don t know what i said 
  you said it  you know you said it 
  no  i don t know what i said   
   but i didn t mean it 
  you mean everything you say 
sometimes i mean nothing
when i say something 
something is never nothing 
it s always something 
most of what i say is nothing 
just something to say 
men say it s just something to say
to get away with saying something   
   but they know they re saying something 
  say what  what did i say 
you said at my mother s  you
would have a baby but i m not ready 
to my mother  you might as well
have said i m a lesbian 
well  i am the only man you ever had 
oh  i dated timmy harrison
for four months before i met you 
  isn t he a woman now 
  aah 
you told my mother
i didn t want children 
  i did not  i didn t say that 
  yes  you did 
  yes  you did  you said exactly that 
  i did not 
i didn t say that you weren t ready to
have a baby  i said that you wanted to wait 
which means i don t want one right now 
  right 
  thank you 
wait a minute  i m confused 
can i get a ruling on this 
no  you re not confused 
you re just wrong 
 holly doesn t wanna have a baby  
we had a plan  gerry 
to wait to have children
until we could buy an apartment   
   put 25 percent of each paycheck
into a separate joint account   
   with a 6 25 interest for 5 years 
why didn t you tell my mother that 
ha ha ha  each paycheck 
darling  you only just started
getting regular paychecks 
  you quit five jobs in two years  remember 
  well  i can t work for idiots 
  they can t all be idiots 
  yes  they can 
they can all be idiots 
and why didn t you tell my mother   
   about the business loan you and john
took out without asking me 
oh    aha 
you see  you    you finally said it 
  i knew that s why you re angry 
  that s not the reason 
it is not the reason 
  it is the reason 
  we should have waited 
waited for what  what 
i ve been driving limos for four years  holly 
so john and me  we wanna start a business 
we buy a few cars  we get a few clients 
that s a career right there 
what is your problem  
what if it doesn t work 
what if we always have to live here 
and what about what i want  huh

i wanna be a real estate agent   
   showing apartments to buy
that i can never live in 
there may be other things
i wanna do with my life 
  okay  like what

why do i have to be
the responsible grownup who worries 
why can t i be the cute  carefree
irish guy who sings all the time 
because you can t sing
without making dogs bark 
 holly grunts 
look  holly  people have babies
with no money all the time 
if you re so worried about it  why don t

i know what you re really saying
even when you don t say it 
you mean the two conversations thing 
the one we re having
and the one you think we re having 
you said that to my mother because you re
mad at me for not wanting children yet   
   and because i m no fun anymore and
we don t have enough hot  nasty sex   
   because i m always bitching about bills 
why don t you just be honest and say it 
say what you mean 
all right 
i wish we had more hot  nasty sex 
or the other kind is fine 
what you re really saying is this
isn t the life you wanted  is it 
well  that s not what i m saying 
is that what you re saying 
and what if this is it  gerry 
what if this is all there is to our life 
  what do you mean

who own a limo company   
   who may or may not have children 
end of story 
  well  what other story do you want

gone astray
the man that won you
has run off and undone you
that great beginning
has seen a final inning
don t know what happened
it s all a crazy game
no more that all time thrill
for you ve been
through the mill
and never a new love
will be the same
good riddance  goodbye

i don t believe that  i ve never been
too happy  i m not too beautiful 
i think you re hot

they have pills for rudeness 
i know  and they can t figure out
the middle east  go figure 
 both chuckling 
hey  you re irish 
maybe it s an irish curse or something 
well  gerry and i did love the yankees   
   which was pretty much
against our religion 
well  there you go 
that explains a lot  actually  i love the
yankees too  and i lost my fiancée last year 
really 
yeah  she slept with my best friend 
she left me 
oh   
my best friend was a woman 
oh 
her last words to me were   i d still
be with you if you weren t a man  
and i m like 
 well  castrating me is definitely the first
step toward achieving that particular goal  
it s still my fault  i introduced them 
i always had this fantasy about making love
to two women at the same time 
except in my fantasy  i was still
in the bed for the second and third time 
  sorry 
  then this ll make you feel great 
the best friend that my ex fiancée slept
with was my ex ex fiancée   
   and she was my business partner  and
we started the business with my money 
so i ended up losing the business 
my partner and my fiancée 
how d you get over that 
i went through  like 
a major hooker phase all year 
but that didn t help 
no  it helped a lot 
i just started to run out of money 
it s actually a lot cheaper to date 
do you think that you re gonna ever find
another woman to love 
no 
no  i think i repel
the women that i want the most 
that s not true 
no 
 vomiting 
no

holly 
i never let him off the hook 
anytime i was mad 
i made him feel bad 
i was mad when we
left the house that night 
i was mad at him because our apartment
was too small  so stupid 
baby  you were married 
married people make each other
feel like shit on purpose sometimes 
it just feels good 
gerry knew you were crazy about him 
he told me all the time 
well  i wish i would ve told him that night 
so tell him now 
it s slightly dirty  just slightly 
 music playing  indistinct chatter 
ooh 
he s delicious  isn t he 
you could serve coffee on that ass 
do you have to be so vulgar about men 
like they re pieces of meat 
i m sorry  john  i forgot you re sensitive
about your flat ass 
john 
hoh 
you know  denise 
that s why you re not married 
  ahem 
  women act like men   
   then they complain
men don t want them 
oh  is that why  oh 
okay  because i thought
it was something different 
i thought it was because
i thought that i deserve the best 
and he s out there 
he s just with all the wrong women 
and let me be clear 
after centuries of men looking at my tits
instead of my eyes   
   and pinching my ass
instead of shaking my hand   
   i now have the divine right
to stare at a man s backside   
   with vulgar  cheap appreciation
if i want to 
  well said 
  i thought so 
new york city  how we doing  huh

i don t mean to throw this at you 
but what do women want 
i can t figure it out 
they want us to ask

they want us to be on bottom  be on top

  i appreciate that

   and go see a yankees game

joined by self pity  bitterness and vomit 
 both chuckle 
  i d like that

daniel 
i think you re a little bit perverted 
i mean  you bring me

   and we re eating corned beef
sandwiches  that s pretty sick 
gerry thought it was the best way
to honor the dead 
you know  show them
how well we re doing 
i m sorry i always bring him up 
yeah  i m starting to get
a little bit sick of it 
 woman laughing 
 chuckles 
now that s a real honest to goodness
couple right there 
they ve probably been together
since the flood 
we re so arrogant  aren t we 
we re so afraid of age 
we do everything we can to prevent it 
we don t realize what a privilege it is
to grow old with someone   
   someone who doesn t drive you
to commit murder 
or doesn t humiliate you beyond repair 
it s sweet 
 chuckles 
it s good  huh 
 laughs 
holly  can i ask you a favor 
daniel  sure 
i started bagging up gerry s stuff 
couldn t finish 
i think i need someone who
didn t know him to get rid of it all 
daniel 
be happy to help you get rid of gerry 
  do you have to say it like that 
  like what 
  what is wrong with you  take a pill 
  nothing  what 
what s wrong 
nothing  i   
i ve just never been alone with another
man in this apartment besides gerry 
want me to stand out in the hall 
you can just throw me the boxes 
no  heh 
 chuckles 
that s okay 
i m sorry 
i m gonna change 
look through stuff 
if there s anything you want   
   just let me know 
  okay 
mm 
i can t remember the last time
somebody held me like this 
did you find a new husband yet 
shut up 
 chuckles 
where have you been 
  i haven t felt you around lately 
  oh  please

mm 
 whispers 
i can feel you hugging me 
that s because i am 
you look great 
this is the one 
 phone rings 
  are you barbara 
  yes  may i help you 
i hope so 
you re his wife 
he was here 
 crying 
so i don t understand 
you re taking a vacation 
holly 
it s a trip 
gerry planned the whole thing
for me and sharon and denise 
you think it s the best time to vacation 
gerry made all the arrangements 
i have to go 
have you spoken to daniel  thought you
two were spending time together 
we re just friends  mom 
i ve stood by and not said anything about
all this  but now i think it s time it stopped 
  what do you mean 
  it s not healthy 
gerry s not gonna be able
to keep this up forever  is he 
his life ended  and so will his letters 
you re gonna have to face
things on your own 
it was a gift from gerry 
and how can you say that 
my husband was 35 years old 
he wasn t supposed to die 
but he did  it was awful 
it s what happens 
but his death is a part of your life now 
and you have to deal with it 
stop saying that
like i m not dealing with it  i am 
how  by waiting for a letter
from a dead husband 
taking a vacation  when your father left 
i had two children to support 
  excuse me for not having any children 
  that s not how i meant it and you know it 
your father leaving
was just as devastating 
but i did what i needed to do
and got on with it 
  it s not the same thing 
  why not 
my husband died  he was taken 
he didn t wanna go  he didn t wanna leave 
yes  my husband wanted to leave 
and it s so much easier
being abandoned by choice  is it 
i ve had my say 
i won t say anymore 
so where s he sending you 
 indistinct chatter 
 car door closes 
oh  my god 
get the bags 
 chuckles 
oh 
  all right 
  she just elbowed me 
know what  if that s an indication of
how this trip s gonna be  i won t have it 
 denise and holly chattering

 sighs 
he    he was a wonderful lad 
it s all right  you know 
it s okay 
you know  these things   
   they happen now and again 
not very often   
 holly chuckles 
   but now and again 
would you like me to tell you
some stories about me and gerry 
i ve got plenty 
yeah 
okay  here you go  come on  sit back 
you know  he was   
he was my very  very best mate 
starting back when we were terrors
running about at 5 and 6 
 laughs 
oh  he made me laugh 
there was this time 
i don t remember how old we were   
   probably  you know  10  11 
we jumped on a train   
 william talking indistinctly 
 inaudible 
 piano playing 
we received those packages you sent 
come in  come in 
martin 
look who it is 
oh  well  look at that 
come here  dear 
so nice to see you 
he was always one for writing 
wasn t he

no  he did it for the love of it  martin 
now  where is it 
oh  here it is 
 when holly visits  take her
to my fort in the back yard   
   and give her this envelope  
he knew that i d come visit you 
hmm  suppose he did  heh  martin 
all right 
it s not really a fort 
it s just a stone wall 
he used to call it that when he was little 
he goes on about other things   
   lovely things 
he hadn t much strength in the end
though  did he 
makes me sick to think
we weren t there when he died   
   for the funeral 
rose  but you could hardly walk
just after your operation 
maybe you ll come and visit us a bit more
now that he s gone  eh 
martin  don t put that on her 
you re under no obligation 
it s not like we re blood family 
i d like to come visit 
and i m sorry we didn t in the past  i   
i just thought you were angry with me
for taking gerry away 
  she wanted you dead  you know 
  martin  don t you dare 
no  i don t blame you 
you know  my mother  she never
quite got over the idea either 
yeah  well  you were both so young 
and it happened too fast 
but gerry loved you  i saw that 
i saw that 
gerry  to my galway girl 
you re an angel for seeing my folks 
i told you my mom didn t hate your guts 
well  you know  anymore 
you are now standing in my fort
where i did all my big thinking 
this is where i stood thinking about you
after the very first time we met 
you didn t look real to me at first 
i never saw so many colors
on one girl before   
    but you looked like

the national park for a few hours  then 
oh  my god

the paper said it was gonna be warm

  no  would i lie to you 
  dún laoghaire 
  dún laoghaire 
okay  thanks 
you re grand 
but you re going the wrong way 
you know 
 softly 
that way 
 chuckling 
okay 
i think you quite enjoy this getting lost 
don t you 
you know  actually 
i don t mind so much  not here 
so how did you come to be here 
oh  on my way home  college trip 
we started in greece 
jesus  that s a long walk 
that s a bad joke 
what are you studying 
  art  yeah 
  art 
  oh  so you re an artist  then 
  oh  i don t know yet 
that s great 
 chuckling 
do you make anything or 
i don t know yet 
 both chuckling 
well  good luck with that 
oh 
you   
would you mind if we walked together
since we re going in the same direction 
i ll stay on this side of the road 
don t even have to talk  just   
just quite nice  sometimes walking
along with someone without talking   
   once you get your feet wet 
gerry 
at first  the no talking thing didn t last 
before long  i couldn t get you to shut up 
but you were so cute  trying to impress me
with william blake and all your grand plans 
i had no idea
what you were talking about   
    but i couldn t help
loving the way you talked 
 i must create a    
something     or be enslaved
by another man s     something 
wait   i will not   
 grunts 
i will not reason or compare 
my business is to create    
  something  oh  god 
  did you just make that up then 
no  it s william blake 
but i completely screwed it up 
no  you didn t  you made it better 
i understood it 
gerry 
i didn t have a clue  actually 
all i know is  if you don t figure out the
 something   you ll just stay ordinary 
and it doesn t matter if it s a work of art 
or a taco  or a pair of socks 
just create something new
and there it is 
and it s you  out in the world 
outside of you 
and you can look at it  or hear it 
or read it  or feel it   
   and you know
a little bit more about you 
a little bit more than anybody else does 
does that make any sense at all 
yeah 
you re saying you want to paint socks 
maybe 
 chuckles 
gerry 
i loved you right then and there 
holly 
hey  i like this jacket 
gerry 
it looks good on you  got it on a bet 
  what was the bet 
  heh 
i was a few guinness s
for the worse at this point   
   but a fella bet me
that i couldn t get a certain girl   
   to kiss me without a provocation 
  what girl 
  his girl 
  oh  ha ha 
  uh huh  ha ha 
  how d you do it 
  there s nothing to it  really 
a fella just has to tell a woman
the truth without words 
it s like a signal you send out 
the woman  she just picks it up 
and what s the truth 
that kissing her would be
the end of life as i know it 
wow 
and that s true of every girl
you ve gotten to kiss you 
 gerry laughs 
i could turn it on and off when i was
younger and i had no principles 
when every girl that i was lucky enough
to kiss was the end of life as i knew it 
and now 
now i only send it out when i think
she might be the one that makes it true 
i know where i am now 
thanks  it was really nice to meet you 
  no  i could walk you into town 
  oh  no  it s okay 
i know where i am 
i know where i m going 
i ll never forget this 
your jacket 
 dog barking 
no  wait 
 whispering 
wait  wait  don t move 
  what 
  oh  yeah  it s a wild irish dog 
  a what 
  shh 
  you have to stand still 
  okay 
get close  like one person 
and if we separate  he ll feel   
   threatened and attack our vital parts 
  what vital parts  all my parts are vital 
  shh  shh 
 barking then growling 
gerry 
we have to stand still 
now  just let him sniff around a bit 
 sniffing 
gerry 
now wait 
 whispering 
i m really scared 
would you put
your arms around me 
all right 
  yeah  that s probably a good idea 
  yeah 
 dog panting 
do you think we could turn around and
face each other without freaking him out 
ahh    okay  sure 
  but let s move very slowly  okay 
  okay 
  ow 
  oh  sorry 
i haven t done this in a while 
i ve been seeing this boy 
but we don t do much  i don t know why 
  maybe it s me 
  no  he s a boy who   
   doesn t know anything about kissing 
that s a man s business 
is it 
that was the most perfect   
   perfect first kiss 
that was the second 
this is the third 
man 
brody  come 
hey  gerry 
yeah  how are you  jeff 
  hey  where you going 
  no  stay  stay 
no  but    you have my jacket 
i know  i m keeping it
unless we meet again 
i bet we do 
that s a bet you re gonna
have to win because   
   if we do meet again then that ll be
the end of it  you know 
the end of what 
life as we know it 
 chuckles 
  look  i m singing at this pub   
  no  no  no  don t tell me 
if i happen to walk into the right one
in the right town   
   then we ll know for sure  won t we 
and if i don t   
   then that ll just be the most perfect kiss
ever created by two strangers   
   and we ll just keep it perfect
for the rest of our lives 
  what s your name 
  no  no  wait  no  don t 
don t  don t  no  no   
gerry 
life had changed as i knew it 
and now it s changed again  luv

   who looks like jerry springer
and doesn t like me

i ve got some  some ideas for the future 
some possible business prospects 
i think about you all the time

i guess 
yes 
but you did say you were
thinking about me 
because you ve been a real friend
through this all 
so  you haven t thought about me
in the nude 
no 
  not once 
  no 
  not even without my shirt 
  gerry  stop it 
daniel 
i m daniel 
sorry 
you think you ll ever feel about
somebody the way you felt about gerry   
   or do you have to wait for a letter
to figure that out 
where you going 
i really like you   
   but i can t be the invisible man 
i m tired of being the shoulder 
i want to be another body part you need 
you know  i wanna be   
   the bad guy 
i want a woman to go crazy over me   
   and then i wanna use her up
until she s ruined for all other men 
  you don t wanna do that 
  no  i don t wanna do that  but i would   
 sighs 
i d like to date a woman
who actually likes men 
i d like to be somebody s gerry 
it s all right 
honestly  it s not your fault  it s mine 
i didn t plan on feeling something for you 
it just sort of happened 
so i m sorry about that 
is your guest coming back 
  no 
  just you on your own  then 
 indistinct chattering 
take a break  will you 
  mom 
  what s the matter 
 breathing heavily 
 sobbing 
come on 
come on 
what happened 
when    when daddy left   
   i was 14 and i said 
 that s it  never again  no man    
and then i meet gerry 
this wonderful man happens to me
and then    and then   
and then he died 
  what was the point 
  i know  honey 
i m so angry i could kill somebody 
i m alone and   
   it doesn t matter what job i have 
or what i do or what i don t do   
   or what friends i have  he s not here 
i m    i m not here 
  i mean  you re alone no matter what 
  that s right 
 sobbing 
you know  i didn t come here for you
to give me some bullshit honest answer 
why can t you lie to me just once 
i m sorry  sweetheart 
  i can t breathe  i can t breathe 
  shh  come on 
let s go for a walk 
patricia 
your father and i used to come here 
they had dances 
well  not really dances 
we d come with radios and cigarettes   
   and drink beer and listen to jimi hendrix 
i bet you ve had a hard time walking into
a room full of people on your own  right 
yeah  i know that 
i know what it is not to feel like you re in
the room until he looks at you   
   or touches your hand  or even makes
a joke at your expense   
   just to let everyone know
you re with him 
you re his 
god  that man could make me laugh 
daddy 
 laughing 
i don t ever remember you laughing 
well  that makes me sad   
   because i did 
i did 
did you hate gerry because
he reminded you of dad 
a little 
 sighs 
you know the worst thing for a parent 
second after losing a child 
watching your child head for
the same life you had   
   and you can t stop it 
it s a terrible  helpless feeling 
makes you angry all the time   
   and i ve been angry   
   a very long time 
 sighs 
i m exhausted 
do you think we ll ever see dad again 
no  sweetheart 
never 
so you have to stop waiting 
you 
i have to say i was impressed by how
he worked everything out ahead of time   
   every delivery schedule 
the mailbox key   
getting that leather jacket out
of your apartment wasn t easy   
   with you acting like miss havisham 
he made me promise 
i couldn t say no 
i told him i didn t think
it was good for you  but   
   i couldn t say no 
it s the last one   
   so all alone or not   
   you gotta walk ahead 
thing to remember is   
   if we re all alone 
then we re all together in that too 
it helps me sometimes 
 answering machine beeps 
daniel  over machine  
hi  it s daniel 
remember what i said in the restaurant 
well  please forget it word by word

it s okay 
daniel 
 dear holly  i don t have much time 
i don t mean literally  i mean  you re out
buying ice cream and you ll be home soon   
   but i have a feeling this is the last letter 
because there s only one thing
left to tell you 
it isn t to go down memory lane
or make you buy a lamp 
you can take care of yourself
without any help from me 
it s to tell you how much you move me 
how you changed me 
you made me a man
by loving me  holly   
   and for that i am eternally grateful 
literally 
if you can promise me anything 
promise me that whenever you re sad   
   or unsure   
   or you lose complete faith   
   that you ll try and see yourself
through my eyes 
thank you for the honor
of being my wife 
i m a man with no regrets 
how lucky am i 
you made my life  holly 
but i m just one chapter in yours 
there ll be more 
i promise 
so here it comes  the big one 
don t be afraid to fall in love again 
watch out for that signal
when life as you know it ends 
p s   i will always love you  
have you thought about this 
about me  i mean 
have you 
yeah 
  this isn t gonna work  is it 
  no way  no how 
  damn 
  oh 
 laughing 
oh  wow 
i mean  that was like kissing my sister 
  i m so relieved 
  ha ha ha 
i got this letter and i thought he must have
been feeling self sacrificing   
   but he s really full of crap 
if he meant it  he d give me a sign 
  i hate signs 
  then i got your message on the machine 
 sighs 
weird  bitter friends 
forever 
 sighs 
what s wrong  friend 
it s gerry 
it s been a year   
   and i don t feel him
around me anymore 
i don t think he s here anymore 
i think gerry s gone 
 whispers 
he s really gone 
holly 
dear gerry  you said you wanted me   
    to fall in love again   
    and maybe one day i will 
but there are all kinds of love out there 
this is my one and only life   
    and it s a great and terrible
and short and endless thing   
    and none of us come out of it alive 
i don t have a plan except
that it s time my mom laughed again 
she s never seen the world 
she s never seen ireland  so i m
taking her back to where we started 
maybe now she ll understand 
mom 
william
