   you are the property of
the penal administration of french guiana 
after serving your full terms in prison   
   those of you with sentences   
   of eight years or more   
   will remain in guiana   
   as workers and colonists   
   for a period equal
to that of your original sentences 
as for france   
   the nation has disposed of you 
france has rid herself of you altogether 
forget france and put your clothes on 
papillon  papi 
you ll be back  papillon 
don t worry  you ll be back 
no  you won t 
you  that way 
down there  you  too 
next  over here  come along 
come on  come in here 
you  too 
over there 
come along  up there  hurry up 
you  too  down 
down  in there 
in there 
come along  now  down 
come on down  down there 
come on  up there 
in there 
we re really something  aren t we 
the only animals in the world
that shove things up their ass for survival 
the first time i shoved one up my gut   
   it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out 
he doesn t have any ether   
   so he knocks me out with rum 
then you know what he did 
he stole it 
a butterfly 
you re papillon  aren t you 
yeah 
the bastards gave you life 
right to the end of the line  they think 
it may not be as long as you think 
forty percent of us will die   
   the first year out 
they gave him life  too 
the kid s only 18 
look at him  no wonder he dreams 
he ll never make it 
but a man like you could make it   
   if you have enough money 
how long were you there 
nine years of work camp   
   nine years a colonist 
you were outside the walls 
why didn t you run 
there s no place to run to 
you re out in the middle of a swamp 
1 000 miles from no place 
now  if you ve got a lot of money
that s a different thing 
i mean  you take somebody
like dega there  back there 
louis dega 
the best counterfeiter in france 
national defense bonds 
 series of 1928 
 right 
now  if you ve got money like he has 
there s a chance to buy your way out 
that is unless somebody cuts
his guts open first to get at all that cash 
everybody up  let s go 
everybody up 
come on  everybody up  let s go 
let s go 
mind if i sit down here 
if you wish 
you re dega  aren t ya  louis dega 
sorry to see you here 
i presume most of us have earned
our passage 
you re papillon  you got life for killing
a pimp  then you had the bad taste   
   to tell the prosecutor you were going
to escape and kill him  too 
i was framed  i m innocent 
no one is innocent 
i m no pimp killer  for christ s sake 
i m a safecracker 
and that s a profession of which
i thoroughly disapprove 
i put almost everything i had
into national defense bonds 
series of 1928 
1928 
your instincts were sound 
how much did you lose 
i wouldn t put my money on those bonds 
not any more than you would 
i m relieved to hear that 
if that s true 
why are we having this little chat 
every convict on this ship knows
who you are 
any of them would slit you open to
reach inside and get what you re carrying 
so 
you need protection 
from you 
remember what the chicken said
to the weasel 
if he was a healthy weasel  the chicken
didn t get a chance to say anything 
think about that 
hose down 
come on  off your asses  hose down 
come on  you ve got a fever 
do what i tell ya 
come on 
julot 
i ve got a question 
if i wanted to get a boat when i got there 
a small boat  maybe a 15 footer   
   how much would it cost 
i don t know  fr 3 500  fr 4 500  maybe 
it all depends 
what if i could pick up the money
to buy one 
then i guess you d have yourself a boat 
you know the country 
you and i could make it out of there  huh 
the answer is no  nothing against you 
but the answer is no 
if i ve gotta go to solitary for
some half assed escape that didn t work   
   i want the mistake to be mine 
not anybody else s  you understand 
so the answer is no 
how d it feel  kid 
good 
all right  come on  move it 
move it a little  let s go 
let s move 
what do you want 
almost unbearable  isn t it 
what 
the heat 
it s not too bad 
of course  you re closer to it than i am 
oh  yes  you re referring to last night 
aren t you 
well  aren t you 
may i tell you something 
at first glance i m afraid
that i regarded you with rather   
   a large degree of unworthy suspicion 
am i clear 
no 
well  it now seems quite possible
that until we get to a decent jail   
   with bribeable guards 
i may stand in some need of   
   rather close physical protection 
it depends on how long you want to live 
oh  a long time 
then you got a problem 
well  i presume that you have some   
   goals  some particular need that   
   outweighs all others 
i mean  if so  may i ask what it is 
money 
for what 
escape 
very good 
you keep me alive   
   until we land in guiana and i will
underwrite any escape you care to arrange 
escape for me  not for us 
of course 
i have no intention of even attempting
an escape  ever 
done 
thank you 
leave him alone   
   or i ll cut your head off 
hide this 
over there is saint joseph 
the other island is royale 
the one on the right is devil s 
julot  why is it so hard
to escape from there 
a man could almost swim to the mainland 
no  there must be a better way
than swimming 
no  no  swimming s not the way 
the current is so strong it ll push you
right back where you started from 
you know  when you re on those islands
you re there for keeps 
where do we go 
we go up the moroni river 
then we dock at saint laurent 
that s where they decide whether
to send you to the work camps or   
   to the islands

right over there 
they served their time

do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone   
   used it as an ornament 
i ve always admired him for that 
there s one search party that gave up 
instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens   
   i made the lens fit the orifice 
what do you think 
did he make it or didn t he 
i d say his chances are very poor 
wouldn t you 
jesus  ls that all you ve got to say 
what do you expect me to say 
that man risked his life to save mine 
for me that s a new experience 
these may work better than i had hoped 
i told you  you couldn t miss it 
the only trouble is  you re a week early 
it s up to you 
you re worth just as much dead
as you are alive 
the rule here is total silence 
we make no pretense
of rehabilitation here 
we re not priests  we re processors 
a meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones 
we process dangerous men
into harmless ones 
this we accomplish by breaking you 
breaking you physically  spiritually 
and here 
strange things happen to the head here 
put all hope out of your mind   
   and masturbate as little as possible 
it drains the strength 
that s all  take him away 
one  two   
   three  four  five 
one  two  three  four  five

put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months 
darkness does wonders for a bad memory 
you know the charge 
i m innocent 
i didn t kill that pimp 
you couldn t get anything on me
and you framed me 
that is quite true 
but your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp s death 
well then 
what is it 
yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit 
i accuse you   
   of a wasted life 
guilty 
the penalty for that is death 
guilty 
guilty 
guilty 
they know 
how did you hear 
trusty works on the launch
between here and saint joseph 
that s all that he said 
then it s only a matter of time 
you think so 
he s on half rations now 
he can t exist on that 
forced to choose between starvation
and telling  what would you do 
we re not talking about me 
what would you do 
i d tell  i d have to 
you get weak  you get delirious 
you lose control   
   and you talk 
then you won t blame him  huh 
blame is for god and small children 
look at me  i eat bugs

to get out of the rain 
prisoner  show yourself 
give me the name

welcome to the penal colony   
   of french guiana   
   whose prisoners you are   
   and from which there is no escape 
first attempts at escape   
   add two years in solitary
to existing sentences

of course  more serious offenses   
   are dealt with in this fashion 
hello  papi

if you d given them my name 
i almost did 
someone once said
that temptation resisted   
   is the true measure of character 
how d you get out of kilo 40 
it was the rankest sort of corruption 
suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house   
   and i ve become his chief clerk 
papi  look    
my wife and lawyer   
   have convinced certain members
in the ministry of justice   
   that my sentence was a bit harsh 
some months back i asked them   
   to look into your case   
   and they ve made some headway 
one of the principle witnesses
against you   
   may be willing to change his story   
   for a price 
if this happened  when would it be 
you could be out in perhaps three years 
 too long 
 no  it isn t 
and with a good job 
the time will pass very quickly
