pacific tech professors  
there s nobody else
around here now 
  hurry up  jump in 
  there was a girl with them  
  if i could find her 
  come on  jump in  will you 
  she s kind of lost  
  you look kind of lost yourself  
i think i know where she ll be  
come on  come on  it s your last
chance to get out of here 
wolfgang  
wake up  wolfgang  come on  
wake up 
wolfgang 
wolfgang 
jesus christ 
ben  it s 3 00 in the morning 
this had better be good 
i just had one of those
dreams again  
i was flying  it was so real  it was over
this giant circuit board or something 
you know  i had a dream
that i was naked at school 
i had to hide in the bathroom 
  it was terrible  
  so anyway 
i drew as much
as i could remember 
and i d like you to take a look
at it tomorrow  ok 
sure 
can i go back to bed  please 
my mom s coming anyway 
over and out 
the martians had no resistance
to the bacteria in our atmosphere
that we have long since
become immune to  
once they had breathed our air 
the germs which no longer affect us
began to kill them  
the end came swiftly  
all over the world 
their machines began to    
  yeah 
  come on 
get up  get up 
kick his ass  man 
come on  jackie  kill him 
go 
  get him 
  heard you called me
something funny  crandall 
  come on  get him  let s go 
  what s so funny 
i said you had elephantitis 
crandall  why can t you talk
like everybody else 
  kill him  steve 
  get off me 
i mean  i don t like people
calling me stuff
when i don t know what it is 
get   
elephantitis is when something gets
bloated and ugly  like your ass 
  come on  you don t learn  do you 
  cut it out  jackson 
  who s gonna make me  you 
  sure  elephantitis head 
kick his ass

buddy 
go  go  go 
hey 
everything ok 
this damn carburetor 
must have rebuilt this thing
100 times 
i just wanted to say thanks for
with jackson and everything today 
steve jackson s a jerk 
he tries it again  i ll kick his butt 
you wanna come over to my house 
i just got this new tape
of this island earth 
  it s got this great saucer landing   
  sounds great 
and it s got  no  it s got this big mutant 
with this  like  two brains 
it s really cool  you d like it 
darren  darren  wait up 
how come you didn t stop 
look  why don t you
just take off  ok 
i did you a favor  but i didn t know
you re gonna bug me about it
  the rest of my life 
  it s ok  here  forget it 
oh  no  my dad s home

what does he do 
hauls junk

ok  well  leave your bike here 
and we ll take the creek 
  your folks fight a lot 
  my mom died when i was a kid 
my dad s ok 
just isn t very lucky 
he always breaks things 
or loses them 
anyway  he taught me how to run 
he can t catch me anymore 
  your mom and dad still together 
  yeah  i guess they get along ok 
they just talk about
the stupidest junk all the time 
where are we going 
oh  i just wanna see
my friend wolfgang 
wolfgang 
oh  it s not his fault 
his parents won t let him change it 
you ll probably think
he s weird anyway 
probably 
he s been playing sick 
working on a project 
i wanna see how it s going 
if i had a name like wolfgang 
i think i d kill myself 
  benjamin  come in  and this is 
  darren 
darren 
you only have to tell me once 
i never forget anything 
look  mommy  this looks
like uncle fred 
so it does 
ludwig  stop that right now 
have a seat  boys 
wolfgang is down in his lab 
i ll ring him 
he s feeling much better now 
  wolfgang 
  yes  mother 
benjamin is here
with his friend derek 
  have you seen the bug bomb 
  i think it s in the bedroom 
well  can i offer you anything 
some baklava 
  oh  yeah  sure 
  what 
it s greek pastry  try some 
geek pastry 
no  greek  it s pretty good 
  ben 
  is the bug bomb in the basement 
  i don t know 
  where is the bug bomb 
oh  ben 
  who s he 
  oh  he saved my life today 
darren 
  from steve jackson 
  ok 
  finished it 
  you did 
  i sure did 
  come on 
oh  could you please shut the door 
  thank you 
  frieda  frieda  here s more 
it s crazy  but your diagram
actually translates
  into some kind of circuit board 
  it does 
  help  help  
  down  erhart  down 
  thank you  thank you  
  this is heinlein 
  hello  heinlein 
  hello  hello  
i would like    
    cheese  
  there you go 
see  i put these sentences
into his voice synthesizer 
sometimes they make sense 
  i would like    
  it smells down here 
  not right now  heinlein 
  go to hell  
i m busy  heinlein  don t bother me 
or i ll turn your voice down 
oh  that s a good one 
all these are mine 
my dad thinks i threw them away 
it s weird  never could get
into this stuff 
oh  but don t you wonder
what s out there 
i mean  up in the universe 
on other planets 
you believe everything you see
in the movies 
not everything 
there s nobody out there 
  here it is 
  oh  great 
i tied into my father s computer
on the modem
and filled in some details
on your drawing 
it s mostly guesswork 
this is our circuit board 
which called for a terminal 
so i used my computer 
which is only a 128k 
but that should be enough
to find out what it   
what it does  if it does
anything at all  which it   
which it probably doesn t 
so you got it 
  makes sense to me 
  good 
there s no sense in waiting 
are you ready 
sure  i guess 
it ll probably just burn out
or something 
oh  well 
this kind of stuff usually takes
years and years to develop
and work out the bugs 
what s  what s it doing 
i don t get it 
it s programming itself 
i don t believe this 
it s asking for coordinates
on x   y  and z axes
to locate a point in space
relative to its terminal 
how did you dream this 
guess i m just that kind of guy 
well  let s see what happens 
 confirm   
what was that 
i have no idea 
there s holes in all these 
i can see through there 
  this is from my dream 
  calm down  ben 
there has got to be a logical
explanation for this  a scientific reason 
this is a trick  right  you guys 
listen  we have got
to swear to secrecy 
if someone finds out about this 
they re gonna try to take it away 
and they can t do that 
because you dreamt it 
i built it  and it s our secret 
  right 
  right 
you pull this on every other sucker
that comes in here 
wolfgang 
oh  it s my father 
wolfgang   
   i was sure the bug bomb
was down here somewhere 
insect byproducts   
hello  oh  so this is the new
experiment 
  yeah  yeah 
  how s it going 
oh  it s fine  fine 
well  with all this equipment   
is that my video sync generator 
  no  i seriously doubt it  father 
  hello  
  hello  heinlein 
  go to hell  
shut up  heinlein 
now that i come to think of it 
i did see some insect waste products
over in that corner  and there
could be some bug bomb 
  bug bomb 
  yeah  of course 
  most definitely in that corner 
  are you sure 
  yeah  yes 
  good  i remember   
i have to get it running again anyway 
i ll call you tonight 
all right  don t forget 
good night  mr  m√ºller 
ja  ja 
father  now that i come
to think of it  maybe it s   
it s not here 
frieda  swat them with the broom 
our speed is diminishing  
we re now in the atmosphere
of earth  
where are you going 
our universe is vast  
full of wonders  
i ll explore  
perhaps find another metaluna  
a place inhabited by beings
not unlike myself  
you see  i m more adventurous
than you imagined me  
exeter  you ve used all your power
bringing us here  
even if you had a place to go 
you couldn t make it  
come with us  
we ll heal your wounds  
i m afraid my wounds
can never be healed  
you ve things to teach us  
thank you  
we re over your earth now  
it s time for you to go  
farewell  
ben  
ben 
  yeah 
  hey  i got it working again  
everybody s at the movies  
get over here right now  
  well  what is it 
  jeez 
you know  ben  you are such
an obsessive person 
and that drives me crazy 
because you can t get emotional
if you re going to study
anything scientifically 
now  what we have here 
as near as i can tell   
   is an electrically generated
point of force 
what 
by typing in coordinates  i can make it
move anywhere in three dimensions 
even as far as slamming it
through a few books or a brick wall 
how 
  this is a vector graphic of the lab 
  you mean a drawing 
well  yes  but in technical terms 
it s a vector graphic 
ok 
that s where it ll be
when it comes on 
  where 
  oh  you mean in physical form 
oh  well  it s right there
somewhere 
i can t see it 
sorry  i miscalculated 
i can t see it 
oh  yeah  i ll fix that 
it s pretty neat  huh 
  wow 
  yeah 
here  i waited for you to get here
so that we could make
the official document 
  can i touch it 
  go ahead 
  it s pretty solid 
  yeah 
  how come we can see it now 
  power modulation 
see  this variable changes
its diameter 
see  it s a perfect sphere 
  wanna see it move 
  yeah 
i ll move it from here to there 
boy  this is pretty weird 
  sure you know what you re doing 
  ben  i m a scientist 
hello  
hey  look out 
oh  my god 
hey  what the hell s going on
in there 
darren  come on  get in here 
it s that thing we found 
it s going crazy 
  you guys weren t kidding 
  no 
hey  it s destroying the neighborhood 
get it back in here 
i ve tried  ok  i ve already tried 
  can you see it 
  no  i don t see anything 
come on  get it back in here 
help  help  
watch it 
damn 
it s gone 
well  so is most of the basement 
look at this mess 
oh  no 
  what now 
  it s my parents  they re back 
if my dad sees all this 
he s gonna stuff me in a test tube 
you guys  sneak out the back 
and we ll continue
testing tomorrow  ok 
this is crazy  i m not coming home
with the house like this 
bad kitty 
so  what d you tell them
about the basement 
i told them it was
a rocketry experiment 
i just mentioned wernher von braun 
and everything was ok 
that wouldn t have worked
at my house 
my brother and i used to come
up here all the time 
that was before he went
into his jerk phase 
boy  you can see the whole town
from up here 
there s lori s house 
who s lori 
she s this gorgeous blond 
  where s she live 
  never mind 
i made a rough sketch of the terrain
in graphics mode for referencing 
i m gonna look for something
to experiment with 
ben   
   don t touch 
mr  professor 
it s my dream  and i can
touch it if i want 
is he always like this 
just about  i mean  it doesn t
make him so intelligent
just because he has a computer 
i can do it  i mean 
it s not that tough 
that s where it s gonna be
when it comes on 
can you make it bigger 
sure 
how do you make it come on 
like this 
help  ben 
  i didn t know it could get that big 
  get me out 
  me neither 
  turn it off  man  get him out of there 
i m   
  come on 
  i m trying 
it s    it s just not working 
ben  get me out 
help 
  where s he going 
  where s he going 
this is like journey to the center
of the earth 
are you crazy 
he s on his way to china 
wolfgang 
oh  god  man  i m sorry 
are you all right 
i mean  are you ok 
i didn t mean to turn it on 
it just came on 
i couldn t breathe in that thing 
  what was it like 
  well   
   it was airtight 
i couldn t feel myself speed up
or slow down 
do you know what this means 
do you realize what it means  
no 
tr√§gheitslosigkeit 
that s german for  no inertia  
  no   
  inertia 
if we had something to sit in 
all three of us could
fly around in this thing 
we could look in top
of the girls  gym 
i have got a great idea 
oh  no  ben  no 
are you serious 
a little higher  
that s it  i can almost see in  
oh  my god 
there she is 
she won t be undressing this early 
she s talking on the phone 
and she s eating some   
it looks like   
it looks like boston cream pie 
she s got some stuffed animals
on her bed 
and it looks like some
thompson twins records  
he s got it bad 
idiotic 
i can almost read her lips  
get me closer 
quick  she ll see me 
get me down 
here she comes 
who is that 
is that you  ben 
yeah  yeah 
i guess so 
well  what are you doing
down there 
i saw a cat in your tree 
so i thought i d get it down 
she wants me  i know she does 
once we get this built 
how fast will it go 
well  imagine being in a car
and accelerating from zero to 90
in less than a second 
you d be instantly squished 
but in this force field 
you have no inertia 
no resistance to acceleration 
you can start  speed up 
stop without slowing down 
and  basically  you won t
get squished 
how fast 
well  it depends on the amount
of power that you put into it 
well  to give you an idea 
this is the amount of power
that i m putting into it right now 
  who s roger 
  this old guy 
he won t notice
if we borrow anything 
do you come here often 
yeah 
got my own key 
that s bozo 
i always come over here at night
to get parts 
so i kept bringing things
to make friends with him 
bones  meat    nothing ever worked 
finally  i found out what he likes 
gum 
he likes gum 
don t you 
well  yeah 
i guess 
doesn t he swallow it 
no 
bozo s pretty weird 
maybe someday i ll teach him
how to blow bubbles 
i used to hang out here
when things got bad at home 
pretty neat  huh 
oh  yeah 
  i could live here 
  not me 
there s some old carnival rides
over there 
bunch of rats live in them 
well  i mean  we don t have
to go there  right  ben 
  ben 
  don t worry  he ll find us 
oh  there you are 
here s the thing
i thought we could use 
it s beautiful 
she needs a little work 
i think this used to be called
a tilt a whirl 
oh  it s perfect 
we can all fit in here too 
yeah  well   
   how are we gonna
get this thing home 
it s got wheels  we ll roll it 
turn it around  turn it around 
come on 
that s my foot  you idiot 
sorry 
that s enough  that s enough 
that s all right 
oh  that s enough  that s enough 
no more  it s fine here 
  what time is it 
  i don t know 
  i got a test tomorrow 
  it s so late 
  so do i 
  mrs  doyle hates me 
ok 
so who would like to tell us something
about carbon dioxide 
ben 
carbon dioxide 
that s what you breathe on mars 
they have dust storms
for months there  you know 
  and   
  stupid 
and the temperature s 50 below 
and that s what you d breathe
on mars 
  what a geek 
  what is he talking about 
and   
  trisha 
  what 
carbon dioxide is formed
during respiration  combustion
and decomposition 
are you crazy  i m here 
stop it 
some of you have not brought in
your field trip permission slips 
let me just remind you 
they have to be in by wednesday 
now  yesterday we briefly covered
the field of physiology 
would anyone like to review that
for us today 
tonight  we launch 
all right 
very good  not so good  very good 
easy test  very high curve 
of course  there s always
an exception 
that s three strikes in a row  woods 
what s the problem here 
  very good  very good 
  just stupid  i guess 
not so good  very good 
don t you feel  i don t know 
like something big is about to happen 
well  maybe  but  i mean 
we really haven t been
  very scientific about this  you know 
  wolfgang 
  well  listen  it might be dangerous 
  don t you believe in anything 
have a little faith  will you 
hey  come on 
  that s not funny 
  all right  cool it 
i swiped some beer
so we can name it something 
it s good beer 
my dad drinks a lot of it 
why don t we call it   
we ll call it the jules verne 
no  no  we can   
we could call it the einstein 
now  that s a great name 
oh  come on 
come on  what do you wanna call it 
the lori swenson 
well   
  i have an idea 
  and what s that 
how about the thunder road 
  it s from a bruce springsteen song 
  it s not bad 
not bad  it s perfect 
the thunder road 
i christen thee the thunder road 
the thunder road 
  oh  now it breaks 
  let s go 
i knew we should have put hinges
on this thing 
  come on  you got it  let s go 
  i m going to take it very easy at first
because something might happen 
and we all could get killed 
stop talking about getting killed
all the time  it s gonna be great 
well  what if the ship falls apart  ok 
she won t  she s a good ship 
  yeah  don t be so paranoid 
  all right  ok  fine 
  ready 
  yeah 
flashlight 
systems check 
air pressure 
ok  we re ok there 
check 
twelve volt system 
check 
  exterior illumination 
  check 
and   
   drive system s response 
oh  wow 
here s my launch area graphic 
see  since the thunder road s
inside the field now 
i m going to plot our movement
relative to an outside stationary point 
which is the creek 
there we are 
  that makes sense 
  ok 
harness strength 
  oh  come on  check  let s go 
  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
supplies  we need supplies
before we go any   
  look  supplies  check  supplies 
  are you nuts 
  everything 
  oh  come on  come on 
  let s go 
  you nut  are you crazy 
  we need to go  come on 
  all right  fine 
  exterior illumination  off 
  no  no  it ll be cooler if it s on 
are you  the whole world s
gonna see these lights  i mean   
all right  we ll turn them off
when we get out of the creek 
it ll be cooler 
ok  fine  your way  fine 
  all right  masks on 
  let s go  masks on 
ok  we ll be able to talk briefly
after the field is on 
make sure that you breathe through
these hoses most of the time  all right 
we re gonna run out of oxygen
pretty fast in this thing 
all right  everybody ready 
  ready 
  ready 
  check  check  check 
  will you stop checking  let s go 
let s boogie 
field  on 
wow 
ok  let s go   
   down and to the right 
hardly feels like we re moving at all 
great suspension on this thing 
it feels like a dream  doesn t it 
i mean  it s all so perfect 
funny  i never have dreams 
oh  everybody has dreams 
i don t 
gee 
i wish i d gone to the bathroom 
i can t believe this 
we must be going over
100 miles an hour 
and i haven t even used
one tenth of our power yet 
wow 
where should we go 
where s all the action
on friday night 
the drive in 
bloodshed is my life  
pain  my pleasure  
now is the time for destruction  
you see them flying there 
that s what they call
a  traveling matte  
how do you know 
all these movies use them 
it s standard 
may the power be with us  
they attack again  
but they will not touch
my carla  
oh  starkiller  this is great 
you mean  you ve seen this 
yeah  the blond guy is starkiller 
and he spends the whole movie
blowing up aliens 
carla 
explosions in space 
it s impossible 
oh  what do you mean 
you can hardly see the strings 
he was like my father  
do you see what i mean 
he was my father  
carla  
oh  starkiller  
  wow  does she take her clothes off 
  yeah  but she s got three navels 
don t you think we re a little close 
that looks so fake 
we re right in front of the screen 
get us out of here 
ok 
what s happening  
  not so fast  not too low 
  it s not making any sense 
  turn us around 
  you re gonna kill us  you idiot 
  why don t you drive it  i m trying 
  turn us around 
  hey  what s the deal  i gave you a 20 
  it was not 
we re gonna hit that  hold on 
what the   
starkiller  you are being
taken from behind  
burn in hell  alien maggots 
you shall not possess our women 
slime bred vermin 
smooth move  ex lax 
  do you wanna drive 
  well  yeah 
i heard they were gonna
tear it down anyway 
at least  i think i did 
well  it s working ok now 
now let s go back 
  oh  come on 
  come on  not yet 
let s see some more 
yeah  open her up 
let s see what she can do 
  are you serious 
  yeah 
  come on 
  i d say she s done enough already 
  no  she hasn t   
  oh  come on 
what s that 
ok  charlie  what do we do now 
we order it down 
unidentified craft 
you re in direct violation
of controlled airspace 
  what are they saying 
  probably something like 
   you re under arrest   
  i repeat 
you must land immediately  
jesus  did you see that 
i don t know what i saw  charlie 
gordon  there was something inside 
didn t you see it  
i swallowed my gum 
  that guy saw us for sure 
  oh  that s just great 
what if he reports us  and the police
come to our house and arrest us 
  then we ll have a criminal record 
  big deal 
even if he did report us 
who s gonna believe him anyway 
it s doing it again 
  what 
  i don t know 
i never programmed
anything like this 
i mean  look at it 
it s complete nonsense 
  well  then where s it coming from 
  i don t know 
  i have no idea 
  great  the computer s crazy 
we re going straight up 
is it thinking for itself
or taking over the ship  or what 
it has to be receiving this stuff from
somewhere else outside the sphere 
  tell it to turn us around 
  i m trying to  ok  
see   no access  
i don t know what this is
or where it s coming from 
well  you can still read it  can t you 
you guys ready for some
more good news 
we re out of air 
we are 
ok  nobody panic 
we have to trick the computer 
i m going to reverse our x axis diode 
hold your ears 
i m turning off the field 
and air s gonna rush in for a second 
  aren t we still going up 
  no  this is great 
not only do we have new fresh air 
but i tricked the computer
so it thinks it s going
in the opposite direction
than it actually is  it s great 
  well  then we re going straight down 
  well  yeah   
  we re going straight down 
  ok  ok 
oh  we made it 
oh  we made    oh  ok 
  twelve volt system  off 
  wait  wolfgang 
  we re not on the ground 
  and last but not least 
  i ve been waiting for this 
  we re not on the ground 
of course we are 
we re home  we re home 
  field  off 
  don t do it 
you idiot 
you broke my walkman 
you re dead 
yeah  well  i got us
back down  didn t i 
you sure did 
wow  it took us right back home 
what s so funny 
that was great 
that was incredible 
next time   
next time  we ll bring more air 
  next time 
  and we ll go higher 
and we ll explore 
listen  ben  i m not going to get in
that thing again until we find out
exactly where those programs
were coming from 
  and we need to run tests  yes 
  wolfgang  come on 
we have to run hundreds
upon hundreds of serious tests 
you know  it could take years 
what are you talking about 
that was the most important thing
that ever happened 
couldn t you feel it 
that feeling way inside 
  we were flying 
  come on  ben  make some sense 
  we almost didn t come back 
  but we did come back 
here we are 
what do you think 
we should trust the dream  right 
sorry  man  i wanna live 
but we have our own spaceship 
you coming 
no 
i wanna take another look around 
ok  catch you later 
johann 
johann  keep your projectiles
to yourself 
there was quite a lot of activity
in this town last night 
there were numerous
ufo sightings 
many of them at the drive in 
where the police are trying
to investigate
to discover who destroyed
the concession stand 
  wolfgang 
  what 
your color is not good 
you should not be making
experiments so late 
oh  by the way 
i found the bug bomb 
  where was it 
  where was it 
in the bathroom 
hey  man  i waited a lifetime
for something like this to happen 
i wanna find out what the hell it was
we saw up there 
ok  well  i saw something
down in the creek  and i   
i don t know  i can t help it 
can t you understand that 
all i know is 
this is driving me crazy 
gordon   
look  man  i ve been having
dreams about this lately  and   
yes  really 
the weird thing is   
   i haven t had dreams like this
since i was a kid 
lori  it s a dream 
lori 
wow 
is this what your first dream
was like 
  wolfgang  this is a private dream 
  not anymore 
you too 
i thought you never dreamed 
yeah  so did i 
but wait a minute  don t you see 
we re all here 
there must be a reason for this 
there s always a reason
when you dream 
what are these  drive ins 
see  there s the diagram 
and there s a missing part
in the center 
we have to remember it
and then figure it out
when we go up again 
wolfgang  
i just had a dream
weirder than yours 
did you get the diagram 
yes  as a matter of fact  i did 
what s going on here 
we both had the same dream 
see  it s a smaller circuit board
that fits onto the original circuit board 
like this   
  turn it on 
  ok 
what is that stuff 
it s    it s oxygen 
  it s our oxygen 
  well  turn it off  stupid 
i had it turned up a little too high 
but that s ok  we can still go 
finally 
you feel it too 
yeah 
it s ever since the dream last night 
let s face it  somebody s calling us 
they ve been calling us
since the beginning 
but from where 
i don t know 
but it s somewhere up there 
well  i guess we have
to find out  right 
well  they got us this far 
it s like we re supposed to go 
well   
   let s go 
before my dad sees his work shed 
ben  are you using my tweezers again
on one of your models 
  no 
  honey  what are you doing 
i m writing a letter to grandma 
well  good 
  mom 
  yeah 
you remember that stuff
you were telling me
about your dreams
and doing what you wanna do 
well  if i really want to be an astronaut
and go out in space
and really do that 
it d be ok  right 
sure  honey  if that s
what you really wanna do 
ok 
  sleep tight 
  yeah  good night

hey  weren t you in there  
we gotta get out of here 
some guy knows about it 
what  who 
some guy  he tried to grab me
outside my house 
he s probably on his way
over here right now 
so we ll kick his butt 
ok  let s get out of here 
ok  i have to regulate
the air pressure first  ok 
can t you do that
when we re up there 
no  i can t  ben  now 
you re getting on my nerves 
what s that 
something my dad gave me 
do you mind 
no  it s fine  fine 
just put it out of the way 
nice going  kid 
all right 
  so  what happens now 
  i ll take us up higher and   
and then they ll contact us  i guess 
i can t stop thinking
about what s up there 
i mean  what kind of life 
you mean  will it be some
kind of slimy blob 
it could be anything 
i mean  it could be pure energy 
or it could be thought waves 
i mean  i don t know 
it could be something
we can t even imagine 
how about a planet full
of amazon women
who wanna breed a new race 
  you pervert 
  oh  come on  you guys 
you ll see  it ll be great 
it ll be the greatest thing ever 
they re here 
see  they re taking over 
  wow  what was that 
  what happened 
  where are we 
  oh  my god 
eaten alive 
  what if we wanna go back 
  go back 
now you say this 
why don t you look around 
it s a little too late 
will you shut up 
it ll be all right  just don t spoil it 
we are going where no man
has gone before 
to unlock the secrets
of the universe 
it s pretty incredible 
think about it 
the field s off 
well  guys  we re on our own now 
don t worry 
it s all part of the plan 
look at this place 
ride s over 
  i guess we should get out now  huh 
  are you crazy 
we can t just sit here 
they re expecting us 
exactly  i m staying right here 
if they give us any trouble 
we ll kick their butt 
what  what the hell s this 
  let s go 
  we really have to get out 
let s get out of here 
hello 
we re all radioactive now 
our dna s all    screwed up 
and our kids will have tentacles 
dark in here 
maybe they don t have eyes 
think we ll enjoy living here 
i wonder what they re waiting for 
i mean  they must ve been preparing
for this for thousands of years 
maybe they re not hungry yet 
  where s darren 
  look out 
darren 
where is he 
darren 
there must be some
kind of mistake 
mistake  my foot 
they re testing us
like mice in a maze 
  don t be such a downer 
  i m serious 
ben  hey  ben  ben  wait up 
ben 
ben  what was that sound 
i don t know 
wolfgang 
wolfgang 
ben 
darren 
are you ok 
that was weird 
you were in a trance or something 
  where s wolfgang 
  i don t know 
i lost him  i   
this thing came   
well  then let s go find him
and get out of here 
i don t know how it works 
but it puts pictures in your head 
i saw that dream we had and
a whole bunch of other weird stuff 
that sounds just like
in forbidden planet  
they had this brain booster machine 
maybe that s how they got
into my dreams 
it smells in here 
i hate to say this 
but this isn t the way
i thought it would be at all 
it smells in here 
you just said that 
no  i didn t 
what 
  oh  my god 
  oh  my god 
where d he go 
we scared him 
scared him 
yeah  to him  we re the aliens 
to him  we might   
we might be horrible 
horrible  us 
come on  he couldn t
have gotten far 
hello 
don t be scared 
ben  wait a minute 
we gotta find him 
i ve waited all my life to say this 
be my guest 
we come in peace 
great  now try   how do we
get back to our ship  
no  no  just give him a minute 
he s probably just translating
in his head 
see  if we can communicate 
he can give us the answers
to anything 
he s about to say something 
eh  what s up  doc 
what 
ok  but let s face it 
this energy field of yours 
it s quite extraordinary 
but it still needs a lot of work 
talk about bumpy rides 
you d think that
a technology this advanced
could stabilize
such a simple computer 
i never tire of looking
at the stars  do you 
did you know that the light
that we see now
actually began eons ago 
they always make me feel
so romantic 
do you have   
   a girlfriend   
   on earth 
a girlfriend 
well  i mean  of course
i ve got a girlfriend 
no one special 
i m not tied down 
if that s what you mean 
it s    it s probably   
probably not english 
it s just an alien language
that sounds like english 
remember this one 
oh  a horse is a horse
of course  of course
and no one can talk
to a horse  of course
that is  of course
unless the horse
is the famous mister ed
everybody 
right to the source
and ask the horse    
nobody s singing

you re not like the rest of them 
you knew we could be friends   
   if we only got the chance

a series for that 
but  see  this isn t real 
and    and we don t really kill people 
well  we do  but    but not aliens 
because we haven t met any
