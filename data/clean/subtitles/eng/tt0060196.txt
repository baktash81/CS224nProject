told him
all that
know already
tell him
want to live in peace
understand
that its no use
to go on tormenting me
know nothing at all
about that case of coins
now that gold has disappeared
but if hed listened to me
we could have avoided this altogether
went to the army court
there were no witnesses
they couldnt uncover any more
cant tell baker
what happened to the money
go back and tell him that
words around you had a visitor
and baker knows it
name of jackson
jackson was here
or bakers got it all wrong
hes not wrong
maybe baker would like to know
just what you and jackson had to say
about the cash box
thats not what im being paid for
im only interested in
what name jacksons hiding under now
why do you think jackson
may be assuming another name
would have found him already
when
start off to find somebody
find them
thats why they pay me
what is baker paying you
that your family
yes
nice family
what does he pay you for murdering me
to get the name
the name
carson
bill carson
thats what he calls himself now
heres a lot of money 1000
and some in gold
thats a tidy sum
but when im paid
l always see the job through
its you
any information
too much
he said quite a bit
that should interest you
and one or two things
that interested me
such as
the name jacksons hiding under is
bill carson
thats your bit
keep talking
he also mentioned somethin
about a certain
cash box which just happened
to disappear
thats my bit
anything else
not enough for you huh
well you dont have to worry
hell never say anything to anybody again
perfect
here you are
here this is for you
you did a good job for me
worth 500
almost forgot
he gave me 1000
i think his idea was that
kill you
but you know the pity is
when im paid
l always follow my job through
you know that
no pistol amigo
it wont do you any good
there are three of us
hey amigo
you know that you have a face
beautiful enough to be worth 2000

sergeant
the captain wants to see you right away
be sure these two get good treatment
hey blondie did you hear that
good treatment
for the last time sergeant
m telling you
l want the prisoners
treated as prisoners
no more brutality
theres hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them
what am
supposed to do
have to have respect
think that youll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better
are our men treated that well
in andersonville camp
i dont give a goddamn
what they do in andersonville
while im in charge here
the prisoners are not to be
tortured
or cheated
or murdered
is that an accusation
sergeant gangrene is eating
my leg away
not my eyes
know the prisoners here are being
robbed systematically
know theres scum around
or bivouacked near the camp waiting
for someone to deliver this loot
but as long as im commandant
wont permit any such trickery
am
clear
yes sir
just as long as youre the commandant
yes sergeant
know this leg means
wont last very long
but
pray
can manage
to have enough time
to amass evidence and bring to a
courtmartial all those who discredit
and dishonor the uniform
of the union
i wish you luck
you and the others better lay low
for a few days
ill keep this you go
wallace will let you know
bring me carson
right
angel eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days
but well keep close enough
to keep an eye on things
come on saddle your horses

theres no formalities here
its been a long time
youre hungry
sit down eat
i knew it
knew it
the minute
saw you
said to myself
look at that pig angel eyes
il bet hes got himself
an easy job
and he never forgets a friend
i never forget old friends tuco
its good to see old friends again
especially when they come
from so far away
and have so much to talk about
and you do have a lot to talk about
havent you
you were captured near
fort craig
if you were with sibley
then you were
coming from santa fe
was it hard crossing the desert
very hard
especially if you dont have
anything to drink
why are you going under the name
of bill carson now
one name is as good as another
not wise to use your own name
like you
bet they dont call you
angel eyes
sergeant angel eyes

and be right back
listen i forgot to mention
hes not alone theres five of em
five

you back there come on lets go
were you going to die alone
angel eyes is mine
all right
see you soon
idiots
its for you
how peaceful and quiet amigo
like a cemetery for instance
there should be a bridge
across that river
we better wait for nightfall
trust in me blondie
i got a good sense of where im going
tuco has taken you this far
will take you all the way
tell the captain
yes sir
come along now follow me
we found them near the perimeter sir
where do you hail from
illinois
and you
im with him
your reason for being around here
we want to enlist general
youd better learn to distinguish rank
im a captain
get the hell out
it sure as hell might be you today
so go write your will
so you want to enlist
you got to take a test to prove it
well show me
youve got a career
at the least id say youll make colonel
really
sure
like it says in the manual
youve got every qualification
to become expert in the use of weapons
this is the most potent weapon in war
the fighting spirit is in this bottle
volunteers
you want to enlist
then lets go
the shooting hasnt begun yet
yes because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of branston bridge
we have two attacks a day
two attacks a day
sure
the rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area
stupid useless bridge
a flyspeck on headquarters maps
and headquarters has declared that
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck
even if all of us are killed
otherwise the keyll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall
and thats not all
both sides want the bridge intact
intact is how the south wants it
and we want it intact too
youll all turn to dust
but one thing is sure boys
branston bridge will stand unbroken
is it bad
to speak the way
do to volunteers
ive done a lot worse
ive done it ive blown it up
in here ive destroyed it all
its a courtmartial offense to imagine
to dream of blowing it up
a serious crime
even to think of destroying
that bridge is just
why not really blow it up captain
yeah captain its nothing
lets scare the hell out of them
ive been dreaming about it
ive even worked out a plan
sure have
the best time is after the attack
when theres a truce
to get the wounded
if
could do it
l could save many thousands of men
but what i lack is the guts
theyre beginning the daily slaughter
right on time
captain all companies
are awaiting your orders
ill be right there
all right friends
come along and enjoy the spectacle
companies
report
company b ready
it looks like the captain is really asking
for a bullet in his guts
ive never seen
so many men wasted so badly
ive a feeling its really gonna be
a good long battle
the money is
on the other side of the river
where
amigo
said on the other side
thats enough
but while the confederates are there
we cant get across
what would happen
if somebody were to blow up that bridge
then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight
maybe
doctor quick the captains wounded
hurry a stretcher
easy now
get things ready
a little of this will help
take a slug of this captain
and keep your ears open
whatre you doing
you realize we might be risking our lives
if
get killed youll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money
it sure would be a pity
can you help me live a little more
l expect good news
why dont we tell each other
our half of the secret
why dont we
you go first
no
think its better that
you start
all right
the name of the cemetery is
9ad hill now its your turn
the name on the grave is
arch stanton
arch stanton
are you sure
sure im sure
itd be a lot easier with that
two can dig a lot quicker than one
dig
youre not digging
if you shoot me
you wont see a cent of that money
why
mil tell you why
cause theres nothin in there
you thought id trust you
200000 is a lot of money
were gonna have to earn it
how
ill write the name
on the bottom of this stone
the gun
you pig you wanted to get me killed
whend you unload it
last night
you see in this world theres two kinds
of people my friend
those with loaded guns
and those who dig
you dig
where
here
theres no name on it
theres no name here either
you see thats what bill carson told me
theres a grave marked unknown
right beside arch stanton
go ahead
its money its all ours blondie
youre joking blondie you wouldnt
you wouldnt play a joke on me like that
its no joke its a rope tuco
want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose
well now
