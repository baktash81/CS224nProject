 told him
all that 
 know already 
tell him 
 want to live in peace 
understand 
that it s no use
to go on tormenting me 
 know nothing at all
about that case of coins 
now that gold has disappeared 
but if he d listened to me 
we could have avoided this altogether 
 went to the army court 
there were no witnesses 
they couldn t uncover any more 
 can t tell baker
what happened to the money 
go back and tell him that 
word s around you had a visitor   
   and baker knows it 
name of jackson 
jackson was here   
   or baker s got it all wrong 
he s not wrong 
maybe baker would like to know
just what you and jackson had to say   
   about the cash box 
that s not what i m being paid for 
i m only interested in
what name jackson s hiding under now 
why do you think jackson
may be assuming another name 
 would have found him already 
when 
 start off to find somebody 
 find them 
that s why they pay me 
what is baker paying you 
that your family 
yes 
nice family 
what does he pay you for murdering me 
 500 
   to get the name 
the name 
carson 
bill carson 
that s what he calls himself now 
here s a lot of money   1 000 
 1 000   
  and some in gold 
that s a tidy sum 
but when i m paid   
   l always see the job through 
it s you 
any information 
too much 
he said quite a bit
that should interest you   
   and one or two things
that interested me 
such as 
the name jackson s hiding under is   
   bill carson 
that s your bit 
keep talking 
he also mentioned somethin 
about a certain   
   cash box which just happened
to disappear 
that s my bit 
anything else 
not enough for you  huh 
well  you don t have to worry 
he ll never say anything to anybody again 
perfect 
here you are 
here  this is for you 
you did a good job for me 
worth  500 
 almost forgot 
he gave me  1 000 
i think his idea was that 
 kill you 
but you know  the pity is 
when i m paid   
   l always follow my job through 
you know that 
no pistol  amigo 
it won t do you any good 
there are three of us 
hey amigo 
you know that you have a face
beautiful enough to be worth  2 000 
yeah 
but you don t look like
the one who will collect it 
a couple of steps back 
thank you 
how much you worth now 
how much 
 2 000

please  forgive me  brother 
my belly s full 
nice guy  my brother

my brother was in charge here

wallace   
   that s enough 
sergeant 
the captain wants to see you right away 
be sure these two get good treatment 
hey  blondie  did you hear that 
good treatment 
for the last time  sergeant   
     m telling you   
   l want the prisoners
treated as prisoners 
no more brutality 
there s hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them 
what am 
 supposed to do 
 have to have respect 
 think that you ll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better 
are our men treated that well
in andersonville camp 
i don t give a goddamn
what they do in andersonville 
while i m in charge here 
the prisoners are not to be   
tortured   
   or cheated   
   or murdered 
is that an accusation 
sergeant  gangrene is eating
my leg away   
  not my eyes 
 know the prisoners here are being
robbed systematically 
 know there s scum around 
or bivouacked near the camp  waiting   
   for someone to deliver this loot 
but as long as i m commandant 
 won t permit any such trickery 
am 
 clear 
yes  sir 
just as long as you re the commandant 
yes  sergeant 
 know this leg means
 won t last very long   
   but 
 pray 
 can manage
to have enough time   
   to amass evidence and bring to a
court martial all those who discredit   
   and dishonor the uniform   
   of the union 
i wish you luck 
you and the others better lay low
for a few days 
i ll keep this  you go 
wallace will let you know 
  bring me carson

but we ll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things 
come on  saddle your horses 
come on in  tuco 
don t be bashful 
there s no formalities here 
it s been a long time 
you re hungry 
sit down  eat 
i knew it

the minute 
 saw you  
 said to myself 
 look at that pig  angel eyes    
    il bet he s got himself
an easy job  
 and he never forgets a friend  
i never forget old friends  tuco 
it s good to see old friends again 
especially when they come
from so far away   
   and have so much to talk about 
and you do have a lot to talk about 
haven t you 
you were captured near   
   fort craig 
if you were with sibley 
then you were   
   coming from santa fe 
was it hard crossing the desert 
very hard 
especially if you don t have
anything to drink 
why are you going under the name
of bill carson  now 
one name is as good as another 
not wise to use your own name 
like you  
 bet they don t call you
angel eyes 
sergeant angel eyes 
like a little music with your meal  tuco 
music 
yes  very good for the digestion 
bill carson s a fake name  huh 
that fake  too 
bill carson s name is written on it

it s bill carson s tobacco 
was carson dead or alive
when you found him 
what d he tell you about the money 
i don t know what you re talking about

you can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal 
wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes 
so many of us have had a session in there 
how s your digestion now 
you d better talk 
 have nothing to tell you 
play that fiddle  you 
ill talk 
what did he say about the money 
it s buried in a grave 
where

i know the name of the cemetery now   
  and you know the name of the grave 
you re not going to give me
the same treatment 
would you talk 
no  probably not 
that s what 
 thought 
not that you are any tougher than tuco   
   but you re smart enough to know
that talking won t save you 
and tuco  is he 
no  not yet   
   but he s in very good hands 
you changed partners 
but you still got the same deal 
i m not greedy  i m only taking half 
there s two of us 
it should make it easier than just one 
hold it  that s it 
don t move 
don t breathe 
got it  thank you 
hey  corporal  afraid he ll get lost 
where s the rebel going 
to hell with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head

but if lever get you down   
   you re gonna need a lot of help
to get up again 
you re a lot luckier than that one there 
you get some proper rope 
and you re all finished 
and there isn t any partner  this time 
to shoot you down 
get up 
sure would like to put
your paw on it  huh 
 would like to piss  it s rough

our friendship  huh

clemens  take care of the horses 
i ve been looking for you
for eight months 
whenever 
 should have had
a gun in my right hand   
   1 thought of you 
now i find you in exactly
the position that suits me 
 had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left 
when you have to shoot  shoot 
don t talk 
every gun makes its own tune   
  and it s perfect timing  large one 
clem  follow him 
just a minute  i ll be right there 
just give me a little time to get dressed 
and i ll open up 
put your drawers on 
and take your gun off 
how the hell did you get out
of that pigsty 
my own way 
i m here with your old friend angel eyes 
you talked  you traitor  you talked 
no  
 didn t talk 
if 
 did 
 probably wouldn t be here  now 
so  only you know your half of the secret 
i m very happy you are working with me 
and we re together again 
i ll get dressed  
 kill him 
and be right back 
listen  i forgot to mention 
he s not alone  there s five of  em

so  that s why you came to tuco 
it doesn t matter  i ll kill them all 
they shot him at close range 
well  look who s here 
the other one will be along 
they ll come looking for us 
watch out 
there s two of them 
 want that blond alive 
you back there  come on  let s go 
were you going to die alone 
angel eyes is mine 
all right 
 see you soon  
 idiots  
it s for you 
how peaceful and quiet  amigo 
like a cemetery  for instance 
there should be a bridge
across that river 
we better wait for nightfall 
trust in me  blondie 
i got a good sense of where i m going 
tuco has taken you this far 
 will take you all the way   
  tell the captain 
  yes  sir 
come along now  follow me 
we found them near the perimeter  sir 
where do you hail from 
illinois 
and you 
i m with him 
your reason for being around here 
we want to enlist  general 
you d better learn to distinguish rank 
i m a captain 
get the hell out 
it sure as hell might be you today 
so go write your will 
so  you want to enlist 
you got to take a test to prove it 
well  show me 
you ve got a career 
at the least  i d say you ll make colonel 
  really 
  sure 
like it says in the manual 
you ve got every qualification
to become expert in the use of weapons 
this is the most potent weapon in war 
the fighting spirit is in this bottle 
volunteers   
you want to enlist 
then let s go 
the shooting hasn t begun yet 
yes  because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of branston bridge 
  we have two attacks a day 
  two attacks a day 
sure 
the reb s have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area 
stupid  useless bridge 
a flyspeck on headquarters  maps 
and headquarters has declared that
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck   
   even if all of us are killed 
otherwise  the key ll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall 
and that s not all 
both sides want the bridge intact 
intact is how the south wants it 
and we want it intact  too 
you ll all turn to dust 
but one thing is sure  boys   
   branston bridge will stand unbroken 
is it bad   
   to speak the way 
 do to volunteers 
i ve done a lot worse 
i ve done it  i ve blown it up   
   in here  i ve destroyed it all 
it s a court martial offense to imagine  
to dream of blowing it up 
a serious crime 
even to think of destroying
that bridge is just   
why not really blow it up  captain 
yeah  captain  it s nothing 
let s scare the hell out of them 
i ve been dreaming about it 
i ve even worked out a plan 
 sure have 
the best time is after the attack   
   when there s a truce
to get the wounded 
if 
 could do it   
   l could save many thousands of men 
but what i lack is the guts 
they re beginning the daily slaughter 
right on time 
captain  all companies
are awaiting your orders 
i ll be right there 
all right  friends   
  come along and enjoy the spectacle 
companies 
report 
company b  ready 
it looks like the captain is really asking
for a bullet in his guts 
i ve never seen
so many men wasted so badly 
i ve a feeling it s really gonna be
a good long battle 
the money is
on the other side of the river 
where 
amigo  
 said on the other side 
that s enough 
but while the confederates are there 
we can t get across 
what would happen
if somebody were to blow up that bridge 
then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight 
maybe 
doctor  quick  the captain s wounded 
hurry  a stretcher 
easy  now 
get things ready 
a little of this will help 
take a slug of this  captain   
  and keep your ears open 
what re you doing 
you realize we might be risking our lives 
if 
 get killed  you ll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money 
it sure would be a pity 
can you help me live a little more 
l expect good news 
why don t we tell each other
our half of the secret 
why don t we 
you go first 
no  
 think it s better that   
   you start 
all right 
the name of the cemetery is   
   9ad hill  now it s your turn 
the name on the grave is   
   arch stanton 
arch stanton 
are you sure 
sure  i m sure 
it d be a lot easier with that 
two can dig a lot quicker than one 
dig 
you re not digging 
if you shoot me 
you won t see a cent of that money 
why 
mil tell you why 
 cause there s nothin  in there 
you thought i d trust you 
 200 000 is a lot of money 
we re gonna have to earn it 
how 
i ll write the name
on the bottom of this stone 
the gun 
you pig  you wanted to get me killed 
when d you unload it 
last night 
you see  in this world there s two kinds
of people  my friend   
   those with loaded guns 
and those who dig 
you dig 
where 
here 
there s no name on it 
there s no name here  either 
you see  that s what bill carson told me 
 there s a grave marked  unknown  
right beside arch stanton  
go ahead 
it s money  it s all ours  blondie 
you re joking  blondie  you wouldn t   
you wouldn t play a joke on me like that 
it s no joke  it s a rope  tuco 
 want you to stand up there 
and put your head in that noose 
well  now   
  seems just like old times 
four for you
