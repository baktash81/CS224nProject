are predators
good good anybody else
and wasps are more aggressive
more dangerous
one species
the polistes sulcifer
is whats called
a brood parasite
theyve lost the ability
to make nests
so they use brute force
to make other wasp species
raise their young
and they make them feed
their babies things
like beetle larvae
and maggots
