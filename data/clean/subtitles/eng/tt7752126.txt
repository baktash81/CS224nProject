bees are pollinators 
and wasps
are predators 
good  good  anybody else 
and wasps are more aggressive 
more dangerous 
one species 
the polistes sulcifer 
is what s called
a brood parasite 
they ve lost the ability
to make nests 
so they use brute force
to make other wasp species
raise their young 
and they make them feed
their babies things
like beetle larvae
and maggots 
bro  why are you always
talking about maggots 
  you must be one 
   all laugh 
teacher 
okay  alright
