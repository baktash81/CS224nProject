then two more after that
every five minutes

excellent strategy  sir 
i m good with water for now 
thank you 
it s his first day on wall street 
give him time 
  thank you 
  thank you 
mr  hanna 
you re able to do
drugs during the day
and then still function 
still do your job 
how the fuck else would
you do this job 
cocaine and hookers  my friend 
right 
well  i got to say 
i m incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm 
i mean   
the clients you have
are absolutely   
fuck the clients 
your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table 
you got a girlfriend 
i m married  i have a wife 
her name is teresa  she cuts hair 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
think about teresa 
name of the game 
move the money from your client s
pocket into your pocket 
right 
but if you make your clients money
at the same time 
it s advantageous to
everyone  correct 
no 
number one rule of wall street 
nobody   
i don t care if you re warren
buffett or if you re jimmy buffett 
nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up 
down  sideways 
or in fucking circles 
  least of all stockbrokers  right 
  mmm hmm 
it s all a fugazi 
you know what a fugazi is 
uh  fugayzi  it s a fake 
fugayzi  fugazi  it s a whazy 
it s a woozy  it s   
fairy dust  it doesn t exist 
it s never landed  it is no matter 
it s not on the elemental chart 
it s not fucking real 
  right 
  right 
  stay with me 
  mmm hmm 
we don t create shit 
we don t build anything 
no 
so if you got a client
who bought stock at 8
and it now sits at 16 
he s all fucking happy 
he wants to cash in  liquidate 
take his fucking
money and run home 
  you don t let him do that 
  okay 
   cause that would make it real 
  right 
no  what do you do 
you get another brilliant idea 
a special idea 
another  situation   another stock
to reinvest his
earnings and then some 
and he will  every single time 
 cause they re fucking addicted 
and you just keep doing this 
again and again and again 
meanwhile 
he thinks he s getting shit rich 
which he is  on paper 
but you and me  the brokers 
we re taking home cold hard cash
via commission  motherfucker 
right 
that s incredible  sir 
i can t tell you how excited i am 
you should be 
there s two keys to success
in the broker business 
first of all   
  you gotta stay relaxed 
  yeah 
do you jerk off 
do i    do i jerk off 
yeah  yeah  i jerk off  yeah 
how many times a week 
like  um  three or four 
three or four times  maybe five 
gotta pump those numbers up 
those are rookie numbers
in this racket 
i myself  i jerk off
at least twice a day 
  wow 
  once in the morning
right after i work out 
then once right after lunch 
  really 
  mmm hmm 
i want to  that s not why i do it 
i do it  cause i fucking need to 
think about it 
you re dealing with numbers 
all day long 
decimal points  high frequencies 
bang  bang  bang 
fucking digits 
all very acidic
above the shoulders mustard shit 
  all right 
  mmm hmm 
it kind of wigs some people out 
  mmm hmm 
  right 
you got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing 
mmm hmm 
i keep the rhythm below the belt 
done 
this is not a tip  this
is a prescription 
  trust me 
  mmm hmm 
if you don t  you will
fall out of balance 
split your differential
and tip the fuck over 
or worse yet 
i ve seen this happen  implode 
no  i don t want to implode  sir 
no  no  you don t 
i m in it for the
long run  you know 
  implosions are ugly 
  yeah 
pop off to the bathroom 
work one out any time you can 
when you get really good at it 
you ll fucking be stroking it
and you ll be thinking about money 
second key to success
in this racket
is this little baby right here 
it s called cocaine 
right 
it ll keep you sharp
between the ears 
it ll also help your
fingers dial faster 
and guess what 
that s good for me 
yes  sir 
revolutions  you follow 
revolutions 
keep the clients on
the ferris wheel 
and it goes  the park
is open 24 7  365 
every decade  every
goddamn century 
that s it 
the name of the game 
halkidiki 
  hmm 
  thank you 
come on 
we re the common denominator 
ah 
ah 
keep it up for me 
you ve seen the echo
and the money comes in
the parade comes to town
going down broadway
it s a one way street
whichever way i go
the next six months 
i got to know the ins and outs
of wall street 
earning shit money as i geared up
to take my series 7 
oh 
oh  fuckers 
oh 
then i was a licensed
broker at last 
ready to make my fortune

they re out in dubuque 
maybe it s microwaves 
i m not sure 
but you call the
company s main line 
their mom  dorothy  answers
and she is so sweet 
  good company 
  i actually don t know what else to   
i don t know anything else
about them other than that 
six cents a share 
hey  come on  who buys this crap 
well  i mean   
honestly  mostly schmucks 
postmen  there s always postmen 
uh  plumbers  um   
they see our ads in
the back of  uh

our ads actually say
they can get rich quick 
  hustler 
  yeah 
you know  those girlie magazines

we re helping them finance houses 
we re helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring   
a boat maybe 
is this    is this stuff
regulated or are you guys   
what are you doing here 
uh   
sort of 
sort of 
jesus christ 
the spread on these is huge 
yeah  and that s
the point  that s   
what s your name again 
mine    jordan belfort 
jordan  what do you get
on that blue chip stock 
i make one percent 
or i did make one percent 
pink sheets  it s 50 
it s 50  
50  commission 
  yup 
  for what 
it s our markup for our services 
and so if i    if i   
if i sell a stock at  10 000 
my commission is 5 000 bucks 
if you sell  10 000
worth of this stock 
i will personally give you
a blowjob for free 
and i hope it happens 
hello  john 
how are you doing today 
you mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back
requesting information
on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential
with very little downside risk 
  does that ring a bell 
  yeah  i may have sent something 
okay  great  the reason for
the call today  john  is 
something just came
across my desk  john 
it is perhaps the best thing
i ve seen in the last six months 
if you have 60 seconds 
i d like to share
the idea with you 
you got a minute 
actually  i m really very   
the name of the company 
aerotyne international 
it is a cutting edge high tech firm
out of the midwest
awaiting imminent patent approval
on the next generation
of radar detectors
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now 
right now  john 
the stock trades over the counter
at 10 cents a share 
and by the way  john 
our analysts indicate
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that 
your profit on a mere
 6 000 investment
would be upwards of  60 000 
jesus  that s my mortgage  man 
exactly 
you could pay off your mortgage 
this stock will pay off my house 
john  one thing i can promise you 
even in this market 
is that i never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners 
i ask them to judge me on my losers
because i have so few 
and in the case of aerotyne 
based on every technical
factor out there  john 
we are looking at
a grand slam home run 
okay  let s do it  i ll do 4 grand 
 4 000  that d be
40 000 shares  john 
let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you
with my secretary
with an exact confirmation 
sound good  john 
  yeah  sounds good 
  great 
hey  john

vote of confidence 
and welcome to the
investor s center

robbie feinberg  the pinhead 
took five years to
finish high school 
alden kupferberg  the sea otter 
didn t even graduate 
chester ming  the
depraved chinaman 
thought jujitsu was in israel 
smartest of the bunch
was nicky koskoff 
he actually went to law school 
i called him rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece

hungry and stupid
and in no time 
i ll make them rich

oh  boy 
what 
i know that look 
what is it  go ahead 
i don t know  it s    you know   
these stocks    these companies   
they re like crappy companies 
  well  yeah 
  okay 
yeah  they re terrible 
don t worry about it  i told you 
what i m doing is completely legal 
yeah  i know 
but they re not gonna make
anyone money though  right 
well  sometimes they do 
sometimes they don t 
you know how it goes 
wouldn t you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people
who can  like 
afford to lose all that money 
of course 
but rich people don t
buy penny stocks 
they just don t 
why not 
because they re too smart 
that s why not 
i mean  what person with
a college education
would trust this
bunch of jerk offs 
hang up the phone 
tell him you ll call him back 
i got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now 
hey 
but what if they didn t sound
like a bunch of jerk offs 
what if i could teach them
how to sell to people with money 
real money 
so i decided to
reinvent the company 
gentlemen  welcome
to stratton oakmont 
you schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1  of americans 
we re talking about whales here 
moby fucking dicks 
and with this script 
which is now your new harpoon 
i m gonna teach
each and every one of you
to be captain fucking ahab 
get it  huh 
captain who 
captain ahab  from the fucking   
the book  motherfucker 
from the book 
turn your fucking brain on 
  fuck you 
  jesus fuck  robbie 
listen to me  we re a
new company with a new name 
a company that our
clients can believe in 
a company that our
clients can trust 
a firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into wall street
that our very founders sailed over
on the mayflower
and chiseled the name
stratton oakmont
right into plymouth fucking rock 
you got it 
what we re gonna do is this 
first we pitch  em
disney  at t  ibm 
blue chip stocks exclusively 
companies these people know 
once we ve suckered them in 
we unload the dog shit 
the pink sheets  the penny stocks 
where we make the money 
  50  commission  baby 
  ooh 
now the key to making money
in a situation like this
is to position yourself now
before the settlement 
because by the time you read about
it in the wall street journal 
it s already too late 
then you wait 
you wait 
and whoever speaks first loses 
sorry  uh   
i appreciate the call 
i really have to give
this some thought
and talk to my wife about it 
can i call you back 
they don t know  right 
they gotta think about it 
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives  or the fucking tooth fairy 
point is  it doesn t matter
what the fuck they say 
the only real objection that they have
is that they don t trust you guys 
and why should they trust you 
i mean  look at you 
you re a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen  right 
so  what do you say 
you mean to tell me that if i put
you in at union carbide at 7
and took you out at 32   
texas instruments at 11
and took you out at 47   
u s  steel at 16 
took you out at 41

  yeah 
 jordan belfort 
 sounding like a kind
of twisted robin hood
 who takes from the rich
and gives to himself
 and his merry little
band of brokers  
  read that  read it 
  listen 
there is no such thing as
bad publicity  sweetheart 
read the article  babe 
jordan  you look great 
you re in a huge magazine 
big fucking deal i look great 
mr  belfort 
can you look at my resume  please 
excuse me  excuse me  sir 
calm the fuck down 
what the hell s all this 
it s the forbes article 
they all want to work for you now 
hey  what did i say 
i m just trying to be nice 
hey  you want a job 
you talk to me 
  mr  belfort 
  give me one minute 
forbes made me a superstar 
every day  dozens of money crazed
kids beat a path to my door 
if we hired  em  they dropped
straight out of college overnight
and spent whatever
allowance they had
on a new suit from
our stratton tailor 
are you fucking serious right now 
i mean  we were literally putting
clothes on these kids  backs 
and here comes this jerk off
sniffing around 
but  you know  every time
someone rises up in this world 
there s always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down 
within months  we doubled in size 
moved to even bigger offices 
it was a madhouse 
a greed fest 
with equal parts cocaine 
testosterone  and body fluids 
yes 
it got so bad  i had to declare
the office a fuck free zone
between the hours of 9 00 and 7 00 
but i m telling you 
even that didn t help 
actually  the madness started
on our very first day 
when one of our
brokers  ben jenner 
christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob
from a sales assistant 
her name was pam 
and to her credit 
she did have this
amazing technique 
with this wild twist
and jerk motion 
about a month later 
donnie and i decided
to double team her
on a saturday afternoon
while our wives were out shopping
for christmas dresses 
eventually  ben married her 
which was pretty amazing
considering she blew
every single guy in the office 
then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later 
anyway  i hired my dad  max 
to maintain order as the enforcer 
stratton s very own gestapo 
we called him mad max
because of his hair trigger temper 
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a
ringing telephone 
who the fuck has the goddamn gall
to call this house
on a tuesday night 
god damn it 
you re gonna miss it 
ooh  please  tell me
something i don t know 
i wait all week for
the fucking equalizer
and they have to fucking    hello 
but as soon as
he picked up the phone   
gene  how are you  gene 
he d affect this weird
british accent 
right o  gene  that d be great 
cheerio 
it was absolutely bizarre 
the fucking halfwit 
  he d hang up   
  you missed it 
and then he s mad
max all over again 
damn it 
all right  tell me what happened 
what happened 
well  he discovered it
was the mother s sister 
who s he  who  tell me who   
the main guy 
you know who the main   
the main guy   
it was his mother s sister 
she showed up dead 
of course  mad
max didn t have to know
everything we were
doing at stratton 
and then there s a
big target and we   
they get launched at the target 
they stick 
there s a bull s eye
and the bull s eye s a dollar sign 
whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign   
gets the most points 
i m gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing 
so if it gets hurt  what happens 
 cause we re gonna
get fucking nuts 
i don t think he s gonna get hurt 
they re like   
they got like superhuman strength 
i think he s gonna be fine 
you can t look him
right in the eyes 
you can t look him in the eye 
that s a fact  i saw it on pbs 
they get confused
and their wires get crossed 
you gotta look at their chin 
like it looks like
i m looking at you
but i m looking at your chin 
i feel like you re addressing me
right now  but you re not  are you 
they re like the mona lisa 
they find eye contact 
like  wherever you are
standing in the room 
and they lock in 
no  but there is a limit
to what we can do with them 
we re allowed to throw shit at  em 
we re allowed to
throw food  bananas 
any food  correct 
but  for example 
what i wouldn t do is
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out
and like get some of the girls to 
you know 
fondle him and shit like that 
that would be   
that s unacceptable 
let s keep that in our back pocket 
this guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard 
correct  yes  yes  yes 
the thing is  this
is their gift  okay 
they re built to be thrown
like a lawn dart 
they re top heavy like a lawn dart 
so they re built for accuracy 
oh  my god  can we
bowl with this guy 
that s his fucking brother  rob 
his brother s the bowling ball 
the brother 
you put a skateboard on him 
you strap him to a skateboard 
you toss him down an
alley at some pins 
  no shit  that s interesting 
  swear to fucking god 
  can we get that guy 
  yeah  we ll get that guy  too 
but it says here this guy
will show his cock  yeah 
  instead of growing up  yeah 
  he will 
they are very ornery by the way 
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys 
safety first 
safety is first  all right 
i want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun
ready to knock this fucker out 
  do we want to get like a   
  mace  taser guns 
a pellet gun maybe 
no  a pellet gun is gonna hurt him 
i just want him out 
knocked out cold 
but i say we stick with
the loophole  right  okay 
if we don t consider him a human 
we just consider it an act 
i think we re in the clear 
like the flying wallendas 
you know  a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody 
the important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind
is that these things gossip 
they get together and they gossip 
  that s a good point 
  and the last thing
that we need is them
getting together and saying 
 oh  they made fun of us  
like  it s gonna make
stratton look bad 
that s why i love you 
you think of shit like that 
when they come in  we treat
it just like one of us  okay 
one of us 
gooble gobble  one of us 
we accept them  one of us 
gooble gobble  one of us 
we accept them  one of us 
gooble gobble  one of us 
jordan  your dad s coming

what kind of hooker
takes credit cards 
a rich one 
at stratton 
there were three kinds of hookers 
the blue chips  top of the line 
model material 
they cost between  300 and  500
and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip 
which  of course  i always did 
then came the nasdaqs 
who were pretty  not great 
they cost between
200 and 300 bucks 
finally  there were the
pink sheets  skanks 
they cost about 100 or less 
if you didn t wear a condom 
you d have to get a penicillin shot
the next day
and pray your dick didn t fall off 
not that we didn t fuck them  too 
believe me  we did

on wall street 
we got plans up here
that s gonna take this company
into the fucking stratosphere 
wolfie  wolfie 
fuck merrill lynch  fuck them 
why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time 
this way we become
the underwriters 
it was our next big move 
finding companies to
take public  ipos 
it was the only way
these wall street pricks
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop 
we got arncliffe international 
see  we were a little different 
we liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows
in order to stimulate
our free flowing ideas 
which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were m m s 
steve madden 
we own the fucking companies   
we own the companies   
don t know what
a lude is  i ll tell you 
oh  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
looks like those ludes are working
their magic on donnie right now 
the quaalude 
or lude  as it is
commonly referred to 
was first synthesized in 1951
by an indian doctor 
that s dots  not feathers 
as a sedative 
and was prescribed to stressed out
housewives with sleep disorders 
but pretty soon someone figured out
that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes 
you got a pretty
kick ass high from it 
didn t take long for people to
start abusing ludes  of course 
and in 1982  the u s 
government schedule 1 d them 
along with the rest of the world 
which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left 
no shit 
you can t even buy  em anymore 
you people are all
shit out of luck 
what are you saying  what is it 
steve madden 
steve madden

secret about these telephones 
they re not gonna dial themselves 
okay 
without you  they re just
worthless hunks of plastic 
like a loaded m16 without a trained
marine to pull the trigger 
and in the case of the telephone 
it s up to each and
every one of you 
my highly trained strattonites 
my killers 
my killers 
who will not take no for an answer 
my fucking warriors 
who will not hang up the phone
until their client either buys
or fucking dies 
let me tell you something 
there is no nobility in poverty 
i have been a rich man
and i have been a poor man 
and i choose rich
every fucking time 
because at least as a rich man 
when i have to face my problems 
i show up in the back of a limo 
wearing a  2 000 suit
and a  40 000 gold fucking watch 
duke it out  hit him 
get the fuck off me 
and if anyone here
thinks i m superficial
or materialistic 
go get a job at fucking mcdonald s 
 cause that s where
you fucking belong 
but before you depart
this room full of winners 
i want you to take a good look
at the person next to you  go on 
because sometime in
the not so distant future 
you re gonna be pulling
up to a red light
in your beat up old fucking pinto 
and that person s gonna be
pulling up right alongside you
in their brand new porsche
with their beautiful
wife by their side 
who s got big voluptuous tits 
and who re you gonna
be sitting next to 
some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor stubble 
in a sleeveless muumuu 
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries
from the fucking price club 
that s who you re gonna
be sitting next to 
so you listen to me
and you listen well 
are you behind on your
credit card bills 
good  pick up the phone
and start dialing 
is your landlord ready
to evict you  good 
pick up the phone
and start dialing 
does your girlfriend think
you re a fucking worthless loser 
good  pick up the
phone and start dialing 
i want you to deal
with your problems
by becoming rich 
all you have to do today
is pick up that phone
and speak the words
that i have taught you 
and i will make you richer
than the most powerful ceo
in the united states
of fucking america 
yeah 
fuck  yeah 
i want you to go out there
and i want you to ram
steve madden stock
down your clients  throats
until they fucking choke on it 
till they choke on it and they buy
100 000 shares  that s what i want

you guys hungry

got some pasta  shrimp  lobster 
i got whiskey 
any kind of booze you want 
you know what 
the bureau doesn t allow us
to drink while we re at sea 
duh  of course 
ever been on one of these before 
a boat 
i learned how to
sail when i was six 
no shit  is that right  really 
on one like this  though 
i had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there 
see that 
anyway  this is for you 
it s a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding 
i understand you wanted
the whole wedding video 
figured this would help
expedite the whole process  right 
  there you go 
  look 
my point is that
i know you re
investigating stratton 
but for the life of me 
i can t figure out why 
i know we re a little unorthodox 
we re a little
loud in the way we do things 
but you gotta understand 
we re the new guys on the block 
you know 
we re trying to make
a name for ourselves 
but i want you to
understand  we don t
do anything illegal 
whatsoever 
i mean  you could talk to the sec 
they were at my office 15 times
over the last six months 
i mean  i got   
i got nothing to hide 
well  you know the sec is
a civil regulatory agency 
we pursue criminal activities 
exactly  you go after
real criminals  which
makes me wonder what the hell
you re investigating me for 
i mean  honestly   
what is it that you think
that we did or do  i don t get it 
well  i   
look  jordan  i can t discuss
an ongoing investigation 
no  i get that  no  i understand 
with that said   
this case got dumped on my desk   
  did it 
  you know  by a higher up
who needs to make a show
of looking into the new company
on the block 
  with all the press and everything 
  new loud guys 
and then i end up being the schmuck
who does the looking  exactly 
it s just  you know   
it bothers me 
we re the new guy  we re the one
that s banging on wall street s door 
i mean  you should   
you should see what s going
on at the bigger firms 
i mean  i know all the information 
it s true  goldman 
lehman brothers  merrill   
collateralized debt obligations 
this internet stock bullshit 
i mean  it s a fucking travesty 
i could take you step by step
through what exactly is occurring 
all you have to do is ask 
i m available 
  that s exactly what i wanted to hear 
  mmm hmm 
i don t see why a
little sitdown like this
can t be profitable
for the both of us 
it should  right 
it should profit the both of us 
  it should 
  look 
i m gonna give you
my personal line 
five days a week 
you just call me  feel free 
  i ll do that 
  great 
are you sure you guys don t
want something to drink 
you re not hungry  nothing 
  nothing  no 
  oh  no 
let me ask you 
and if you don t wanna
get too personal 
  just tell me to shut up at any time 
  oh 
did you try to get
your broker s license at one time 
did i hear that right  were you
trying to take a stab at wall street 
  no 
  who you been talking to 
who the fuck you been talking to 
well  you re investigating me 
i hear things 
you know what i mean 
you ever think about
what would ve happened
if you would have
stayed the course 
you know what 
when i m riding home on the subway
and my balls are fucking sweating 
i m wearing the same suit
three days in a row   
yeah  you bet i do 
i ve thought about it before 
who wouldn t  right 
right  who fucking wouldn t 
what do you get   
another personal question 
no need to answer   
no  that s all right  jordan 
what do you pull in  50  60k 
something like that 
  a year  in the ballpark 
  oh 
well  i   
let s put it this way 
you get a free handgun
when you sign up for the bureau 
no  but it fucking pisses me off 
you know what i mean 
you think about the people
that built this country 
hardworking people like you 
firefighters  teachers  fbi agents 
end of the day  you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially 
it fucking makes me angry 
now the one thing about wall street
and this market is 
for me  i feel
it s good to give back 
you know  there s   
there are situations where i can
make those situations better
for people  you know 
you know what i mean 
opportunity
is everything 
exactly 
take for example 
i got this one kid  right 
went to school for environmental
science  something like that 
he was bogged down
by student loans 
turns out  his mother needed
triple bypass surgery 
  jesus 
  right  horrible situation 
sure 
but we got him into the market
at the right time
and chose the right stock 
we gave him the right guidance 
boom  overnight 
changed his entire life 
got to put his mother into
the best hospital in new york city 
it didn t work out for her 
granted  she passed
away  unfortunately 
but we gave him that opportunity 
you know what i m saying 
it s just about setting
up the right team 
and then overnight
your life can change 
what does    what does an intern   
what does an intern
make in a deal like that 
well  in that situation 
in that particular trade 
and it was one trade 
north of half a million dollars 
and i d do that for
anybody  you know 
anybody that needs
the proper guidance 
can you say that again 
just the way you said it 
just the same way 
oh 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
oh  come on 
you know what i m talking about 
i think what jordan
just did is he   
  if i m not mistaken   
  no 
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer 
no  technically i
didn t bribe anybody 
no  no  that s not the conversation
i heard  jordan 
no  no  according to
the u s  criminal code 
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure
  for the exchange of services 
  oh 
that would not hold
up in a court of law 
nah  it s not howl heard it 
no  no  no  that s the truth 
but i want to tell you this 
yeah 
the same gentleman that told me
that you tried to get
your broker s license
also told me that
you are a straight arrow 
he ran a security check on me 
well   
yeah  when you sail
on a boat fit for a bond villain 
sometimes you need to
play the part  right 
i think it s time you both
get the fuck off my boat 
what do you say  hmm 
you know  jordan 
i ll tell you something 
most of the wall street jackasses
that i bust 
they re to the manor born 
  is that right 
  yeah 
their fathers are douchebags 
just like their
fathers before them 
but you   
you  jordan 
you got this way all on your own 
did i 
  good for you  little man 
  little man 
good for you 
me  the little man 
and let me tell you something 
let me tell you something else 
honestly 
i m not bullshitting here 
this is one of the nicest boats
  that i ve ever been on  i gotta tell you 
  i bet it is 
and you know
what i was just thinking  too 
the fucking hero that i m
gonna be back at the office
when the bureau seizes

excusez moi  jordan 
swiss custom requires
10 minutes of   
blah  blah  blah 
  chit chat 
  yeah  chit chat  thank you 
before business can be discussed 
yeah 
of course 
let s get down to it 
what would you like to know 
under what circumstances
would you be obligated
to cooperate with an fbi
or a u s  justice department
investigation  for example 
ca depend 
ca depend 
oui 
ca depend on what  exactly 
whether america plans
to invade switzerland
in the coming months 
shall i check if tanks are
rolling down the rue de la croy 
  yes  rue de la croix 
  croix  croix 
not croy  not rue de la croy 
it s croix 
see  this is what he used to do
back in law school  check me 
  champagne  champagne 
  yeah 
yeah  yeah  french
fries  pommes frites 
  and that kind of stuff 
  that s funny 
what i m asking  you swiss dick 
is are you going to fuck me over 
i understand
perfectly  you american shit 
the only way
the banque réal de genéve
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in switzerland 
but there are very few swiss laws
which apply to your practices 
hmm 
from a financial standpoint 
you are now
in heaven 
see  i told you he was
fantastic  right 
if the u s  justice department
sent us a subpoena  it would become
papier toilette 
we would wipe our ass with it 
unless  of course  it
was an investigation
into stock fraud 
which is a crime here in
switzerland  if i m correct 
then there would have to
be coopération on your part 
  if i m not mistaken 
  yes 
yes  we would  mmm hmm 
assuming the account is
under your name 
if it were
another name 
a friend s  camarade   
cousin 
  relative 
  yeah 
hmm 
was that yodeling i just heard
or did you just say
what i thought you said 
yes  yes 
he s telling me
to use a fucking rathole 
but a u s  rathole would never get
into switzerland
with all that money 
what i needed was a rathole
with a european passport 
jordan

it was a miracle i wasn t killed 
or that i didn t kill anybody else 
the cops took me in
for questioning 
but they couldn t charge me 
they had no proof
i was even behind the wheel 
meanwhile 
brad did three months
in jail for contempt
because he wouldn t rat donnie out 
the result 
i was soot free 
but i had eyes on me
like never before 
you re a lucky man  jordan 
you re lucky to be alive 
let alone not in jail 
you know i don t believe
in luck  right 
but it s time 
please  let me call the sec
and cut a deal
before your luck runs out 
wave to daddy 
hey 
hey  sweetie 
what kind of terms would you
be talking about if i   
i don t know 
you plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations 
stock manipulation 
high pressure sales tactics 
ticky tack shit like
that  you know 
you pay a couple million
dollars in fines 
in exchange  the sec fucks
off till the end of time 
and stratton 
what happens to stratton 
there s no way    i mean   
you got to walk away  right 
let donnie be in charge 
right  donnie 
now the fbi is
another animal completely 
they ll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing 
however  with you stepping
down voluntarily 
my guess is that
your best friend agent denham
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand 
jordan 
what do you have to think about 
you beat them 
you won 
god knows you never
have to work again 
what re you gonna do 
spend the rest of your life in jail 
  is that what you want 
  no 
  of course not 
  okay 
okay  you got all the
money in the world 
you need everybody else s money 
  of course not  pops 
  well 
  you know  i built it 
  i know you built it 
you built it  so now preserve it 
you know 
five years ago  when i
started stratton oakmont
with donnie azoff  i knew the day
would eventually come
where i d have to be moving on 
and it s truly with a heavy heart
that i m here to say that   
that that day is finally here 
i wanna   
i want to thank you all for your   
your years of loyalty
and admiration 
but the point is this 
under donnie s leadership 
along with nicky koskoff
and robbie feinberg
moving into key management
positions  this place really
is gonna be better than ever 
that i promise you  okay 
give them a round of applause 
come on 
this is ellis island here  people 
i don t care who you are 
where you re from 
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking mayflower
or on an inner tube from haiti 
this right here is the
land of opportunity 
stratton oakmont is america 
all of you know
kimmie belzer  right 
yes  we do 
fuck you 
come on  kimmie 
what you probably didn t know is 
kimmie was one of
the first brokers here 
one of stratton s original 20 
now most of you met kimmie 
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today 
a woman that wears
 3 000 armani suits 
who drives a brand new
mercedes benz 
a woman who spends
her winters in the bahamas
and summers in the hamptons 
that s not the kimmie that i met 
the kimmie that i met didn t have
two nickels to rub together 
she was a single mom
on the balls of her ass
with an 8 year old son 
okay  she was
three months behind on her rent 
and when she came to me
and asked me for a job 
she asked for a  5 000 advance
just so she could pay
her son s tuition 
and what d i do  kimmie 
go on  tell them 
you wrote me a check
for  25 000 
that s right 
thank you 
and you know why that is 
it s because i believed in you 
it s because i believed
in you  kimmie 
just like i believe in each
and every one of you here today 
  i fucking love you  jordan 
  i fucking love you 
i fucking love you  i love you 
i fucking love you  too 
i fucking love you  too

it s a shame  you know 
for years  i ve been
telling you guys
never to take no for
an answer  right 
you know  to keep pushing 
to never hang up the phone
until you get what you want 
because you all deserve it 
you know  this fucking deal
that i m about to sign
barring me from the
securities industry 
barring me from stratton 
my home 
what the fuck is that  you know 
i ll tell you what it is  it s

the nice thing about
getting rescued by italians

make you drink red wine 
then you get to dance 
did you see that 
that was the plane
i sent to come get us 
i shit you not  it exploded
when a seagull flew
into the engine 
three people killed 
you want a sign from god 
well  after all this 
i finally got the message 
do you dream of becoming
financially independent
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills 
would you like to own
a home like this 
but can barely afford
to pay your rent 
my name is jordan belfort 
and there s no secret
to wealth creation 
no matter who you are 
no matter where you came from 
you too can become
financially independent
in just a matter of months 
all you need is a strategy 
when i was 24 years old 
i made a decision not just
to survive  but to thrive 
at first i didn t feel like
deals like these were possible 
but we have the house
and we have a  33 000 profit 
i certainly believe now 
think about it for a second 
if you don t have the guts
to attend jordan belfort s
straight line persuasion
system seminar 
then how do you expect
to make any money 
if you want to be
a millionaire someday 
have some guts  make a decision 
jordan belfort s
setup worked for me
because i worked hard for it 
and if it doesn t work for you 
it s because you re lazy 
and you should get a
job at mcdonald s 
there s nobody holding
you back from financial freedom 
and there s nobody stopping
you from making millions 
don t just sit at home 
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you 
i changed all these people s lives
and i can change yours  too 
so come to my seminar 
the life of your dreams is only   
good to see you again  jordan 
you re under arrest 
you gotta be joking 
you re kidding me 
hey  get the fuck away from me 
turn that camera off 
i m fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here 
you fucking cocksucker 
  fuck you  you motherfucker

little legal advice

i m never eating at benihana again 
i don t care whose birthday it is 
where s naomi  how s she doing 
that s her in the house there 
you could say hi  but she
probably won t wave back 
naomi  sweetheart 
what s up her ass 
  is she mad at me 
  no  you know   
we probably have to
mortgage the house
in order to make bail 
probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for
all the lawyers 
it s been a nightmare  buddy 
to tell you the truth 
what are you gonna do  right 
anyway  how s stratton 
that s more important 
how s morale 
they all pissed off  cause they
have to make money legally now 
  jordan 
  hmm 
i got the founding
partners together 
i talked to them about everything 
and i got you 
what do you mean  you got me 
the house  money  don t
worry about it  i got you 
all right 
i love you  buddy 
  you know i d do it for you  right 
  i know 
  you know that  right 
  i know 
i could fucking kiss you all over 
all right  enough  enough 
you want a beer  pal 
what are you drinking 
i got this non alcoholic shit 
what s that 
a non alcoholic beer 
it s got no alcohol 
  it s a beer 
  yeah  with no alcohol 
but if you drink enough 
if you drink a lot 
they get you fucked up 
no  there s no alcohol 
that s the fucking point 
i m not a scientist 
i don t know what the fuck
you re talking about 
i can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer 
i know  but i don t drink 
you remember 
i don t drink anymore 
oh  you wanna go inside
and blow some lines
of baking powder 
or baking soda   
can t imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up 
  yeah 
  i love it 
how s being sober 
  fucking sucks 
  boring  right 
so boring  i wanna kill myself 
there s a term 
and we don t like to use it
unless circumstances dictate 
and i think they do
dictate in this case 
and the term is  grenada  
have you ever heard of grenada 
no  no  i haven t 
grenada s very interesting because
it is a small island nation
that was invaded by the united
states of america in 1983 
it s about 90 000 people 
and essentially  it means
this case is unloseable 
okay 
so  you know  we can come in 
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants 
nobody gives a fuck 
i m gonna win 
you  sir 
are what s known
as a grenada 
hmm 
you re looking at real prison time 
hmm 
money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years 
and our case couldn t be stronger
if we caught you
shoving cash in your mattress 
is that right 
hey  jordan  jordan 
your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college 
that s not our ambition here 
there s other people
involved in this  too 
we think they need to
see their day in court as well 
why do i sense
there s an offer in the air 
look at him  he s got a sense 
what are you  kreskin 
full cooperation  he provides
us with a comprehensive list
of all the co conspirators
spanning the last seven years 
and he also agrees to wear a wire 
wait   
did you just say  wear a wire  
a wire  mmm hmm 
what does that mean 
you want me to rat  is that it 
no  i want you to cooperate 
  no  you want me to rat  right 
  yes  we want you to rat 
that s fucking exactly
what we want you to do  to rat 
how was cristy s party 
fine 
good 
babe  i spoke to the
lawyers again today 
i have some really 
really great news 
mmm hmm 
turns out you re completely
off the hook  honey 
i know that already 
right  exactly 
you never did anything wrong
in the first place  right 
it turns out  all the fbi really
wants from me is to  uh 
to cooperate 
you know 
turns out i have so
much information
about the stock market
and wall street 
i could save the government
years of heartache  not to mention
  countless dollars 
  mmm hmm 
but it gets even better  babe 
because if i do
decide to cooperate 
i might only be
looking at four short years 
in which case  you know 
we could start fresh 
maybe sell the house 
and any fines that i d have to pay
wouldn t be due till
after i serve my term 
so we d still have plenty of
money left over  you know 
mmm hmm 
the only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends 
like you said   there s no friends
on wall street   right 
right  right  exactly 
there s a silver lining
to that  too  honey 
because they said eventually   
eventually everyone s gonna have to
give information on this case 
so  at the end of the day  it might
not even be a factor  you know 
well  that s good news  right 
yeah  yeah 
i m really happy for you 
what do you mean  happy for me 
sweetheart 
you should be happy for
the both of us  right 
  yeah  right
