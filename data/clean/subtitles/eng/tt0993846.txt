how the fuck else would
you do this job
cocaine and hookers my friend
right
well i got to say
im incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm
i mean
the clients you have
are absolutely
fuck the clients
your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table
you got a girlfriend
im married i have a wife
her name is teresa she cuts hair
congratulations
thank you
think about teresa
name of the game
move the money from your clients
pocket into your pocket
right
but if you make your clients money
at the same time
its advantageous to
everyone correct
no
number one rule of wall street
nobody
i dont care if youre warren
buffett or if youre jimmy buffett
nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up
down sideways
or in fucking circles
least of all stockbrokers right
mmmhmm
its all a fugazi
you know what a fugazi is
uh fugayzi its a fake
fugayzi fugazi its a whazy
its a woozy its
fairy dust it doesnt exist
its never landed it is no matter
its not on the elemental chart
its not fucking real
right
right
stay with me
mmmhmm
we dont create shit
we dont build anything
no
so if you got a client
who bought stock at 8
and it now sits at 16
hes all fucking happy
he wants to cash in liquidate
take his fucking
money and run home
you dont let him do that
okay
cause that would make it real
right
no what do you do
you get another brilliant idea
a special idea
another situation another stock
to reinvest his
earnings and then some
and he will every single time
cause theyre fucking addicted
and you just keep doing this
again and again and again
meanwhile
he thinks hes getting shit rich
which he is on paper
but you and me the brokers
were taking home cold hard cash
via commission motherfucker
right
thats incredible sir
i cant tell you how excited i am
you should be
theres two keys to success
in the broker business
first of all
you gotta stay relaxed
yeah
do you jerk off
do i do i jerk off
yeah yeah i jerk off yeah
how many times a week
like um three or four
three or four times maybe five
gotta pump those numbers up
those are rookie numbers
in this racket
i myself i jerk off
at least twice a day
wow
once in the morning
right after i work out
then once right after lunch
really
mmmhmm
i want to thats not why i do it
i do it cause i fucking need to
think about it
youre dealing with numbers
all day long
decimal points high frequencies
bang bang bang
fucking digits
all very acidic
abovetheshoulders mustard shit
all right
mmmhmm
it kind of wigs some people out
mmmhmm
right
you got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing
mmmhmm
i keep the rhythm below the belt
done
this is not a tip this
is a prescription
trust me
mmmhmm
if you dont you will
fall out of balance
split your differential
and tip the fuck over
or worse yet
ive seen this happen implode
no i dont want to implode sir
no no you dont
im in it for the
long run you know
implosions are ugly
yeah
pop off to the bathroom
work one out any time you can
when you get really good at it
youll fucking be stroking it
and youll be thinking about money
second key to success
in this racket
is this little baby right here
its called cocaine
right
itll keep you sharp
between the ears
itll also help your
fingers dial faster
and guess what
thats good for me
yes sir
revolutions you follow
revolutions
keep the clients on
the ferris wheel
and it goes the park
is open 247 365
every decade every
goddamn century
thats it
the name of the game
halkidiki
hmm
thank you
come on
were the common denominator
ah
ah
keep it up for me
youve seen the echo
and the money comes in
the parade comes to town
going down broadway

we dont even need computers here
we just trade right off
the pink sheets here
pink sheets
yeah theyre penny stocks
you know uh companies that

they dont have enough capital
their shares trade here
penny stocks
yeah
this one uh aerodyne
is a really interesting
or aerotyne
aerotyne yeah
aero aerotyne
aerotyne yeah
very hot stock right now
oh yeah
theyre just a couple of brothers
that are making
radar detectors out
of their garage
theyre out in dubuque
maybe its microwaves
im not sure
but you call the
companys main line
their mom dorothy answers
and she is so sweet
good company
i actually dont know what else to
i dont know anything else
about them other than that
six cents a share
hey come on who buys this crap
well i mean
honestly mostly schmucks
postmen theres always postmen
uh plumbers um
they see our ads in
the back of uh
hustler and popular mechanics
our ads actually say
they can get rich quick
hustler
yeah
you know those girlie magazines
yeah yeah nudie mag
a lot
yeah
were helping them finance houses
were helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring
a boat maybe
is this is this stuff
regulated or are you guys
what are you doing here
uh
sort of
sort of
jesus christ
the spread on these is huge
yeah and thats
the point thats
whats your name again
mine jordan belfort
jordan what do you get
on that blue chip stock
i make one percent
or i did make one percent
pink sheets its 50
its 50
50 commission
yup

its our markup for our services
and so if i if i
if i sell a stock at 10000
my commission is 5000 bucks
if you sell 10000
worth of this stock
i will personally give you
a blowjob for free
and i hope it happens
hello john
how are you doing today
you mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back
requesting information
on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential
with very little downside risk
does that ring a bell
yeah i may have sent something
okay great the reason for
the call today john is
something just came
across my desk john
it is perhaps the best thing
ive seen in the last six months
if you have 60 seconds
id like to share
the idea with you
you got a minute
actually im really very
the name of the company
aerotyne international
it is a cutting edge hightech firm
out of the midwest
awaiting imminent patent approval
on the next generation
of radar detectors
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now
right now john
the stock trades overthecounter
at 10 cents a share
and by the way john
our analysts indicate
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that
your profit on a mere
6000 investment
would be upwards of 60000
jesus thats my mortgage man
exactly
you could pay off your mortgage
this stock will pay off my house
john one thing i can promise you
even in this market
is that i never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners
i ask them to judge me on my losers
because i have so few
and in the case of aerotyne
based on every technical
factor out there john
we are looking at
a grand slam home run
okay lets do it ill do 4 grand
4000 thatd be
40000 shares john
let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you
with my secretary
with an exact confirmation
sound good john
yeah sounds good
great
hey john

vote of confidence

guys werent like harvard mbas
robbie feinberg the pinhead
took five years to
finish high school
alden kupferberg the sea otter
didnt even graduate
chester ming the
depraved chinaman
thought jujitsu was in israel
smartest of the bunch
was nicky koskoff
he actually went to law school

his piece of shit hairpiece
still give them to me young

i know that look
what is it go ahead
i dont know its you know
these stocks these companies
theyre like crappy companies
well yeah
okay
yeah theyre terrible
dont worry about it i told you
what im doing is completely legal
yeah i know
but theyre not gonna make
anyone money though right
well sometimes they do
sometimes they dont
you know how it goes
wouldnt you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people
who can like
afford to lose all that money
of course
but rich people dont
buy penny stocks
they just dont
why not
because theyre too smart
thats why not
i mean what person with
a college education
would trust this
bunch of jerkoffs
hang up the phone
tell him youll call him back
i got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now
hey
but what if they didnt sound
like a bunch of jerkoffs
what if i could teach them
how to sell to people with money
real money
so i decided to
reinvent the company
gentlemen welcome
to stratton oakmont
you schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1 of americans
were talking about whales here
moby fucking dicks
and with this script
which is now your new harpoon
im gonna teach
each and every one of you
to be captain fucking ahab
get it huh
captain who
captain ahab from the fucking
the book motherfucker
from the book
turn your fucking brain on
fuck you
jesus fuck robbie
listen to me were a
new company with a new name
a company that our
clients can believe in
a company that our
clients can trust
a firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into wall street
that our very founders sailed over
on the mayflower
and chiseled the name
stratton oakmont
right into plymouth fucking rock
you got it
what were gonna do is this
first we pitch em
disney att ibm
blue chip stocks exclusively
companies these people know
once weve suckered them in
we unload the dog shit
the pink sheets the penny stocks
where we make the money
50 commission baby
ooh
now the key to making money
in a situation like this
is to position yourself now
before the settlement
because by the time you read about
it in the wall street journal
its already too late
then you wait
you wait
and whoever speaks first loses
sorry uh
i appreciate the call
i really have to give
this some thought
and talk to my wife about it
can i call you back
they dont know right
they gotta think about it
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives or the fucking tooth fairy
point is it doesnt matter
what the fuck they say
the only real objection that they have
is that they dont trust you guys
and why should they trust you
i mean look at you
youre a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen right
so what do you say
you mean to tell me that if i put
you in at union carbide at 7
and took you out at 32
texas instruments at 11
and took you out at 47
us steel at 16
took you out at 41
you wouldnt be saying
to me right now chester
pick me up a few thousand
shares of disney
on the spot right now come on
honestly kevin honestly
seriously
i dont know you
you coldcalled me
youre a total stranger
i am in complete
agreement with you
you dont know me
i dont know you
let me introduce myself to you
my name is alden kupferberg
robbie feinberg
chester ming
im senior vice president
at stratton oakmont
and i plan on being one of the
top brokers in my firm next year
and im not gonna get there
by being wrong stanley
i do wanna say that
you sound like a
you sound like a
pretty sincere guy
its not gonna make you rich
and its not gonna make you poor
but what this trade
will do is serve as
a benchmark
for future business kevin
you feel comfortable
with me now scotty
and then youll know for sure
that you finally found
a broker on wall street
that you can trust
and who can consistently
make you money
sound fair enough
you know what yeah
i gotta say im pretty impressed

jordan belfort
sounding like a kind
of twisted robin hood
who takes from the rich
and gives to himself
and his merry little
band of brokers
read that read it
listen
there is no such thing as
bad publicity sweetheart
read the article babe
jordan you look great
youre in a huge magazine
big fucking deal i look great
mr belfort
can you look at my resume please
excuse me excuse me sir
calm the fuck down
what the hells all this
its the forbes article
they all want to work for you now
hey what did i say
im just trying to be nice
hey you want a job
you talk to me
mr belfort
give me one minute
forbes made me a superstar
every day dozens of moneycrazed
kids beat a path to my door
if we hired em they dropped
straight out of college overnight
and spent whatever
allowance they had
on a new suit from
our stratton tailor
are you fucking serious right now
i mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs
and here comes this jerkoff
sniffing around
but you know every time
someone rises up in this world
theres always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down
within months we doubled in size
moved to even bigger offices
it was a madhouse
a greedfest
with equal parts cocaine
testosterone and body fluids
yes
it got so bad i had to declare
the office a fuckfree zone
between the hours of 900 and 700
but im telling you
even that didnt help
actually the madness started
on our very first day
when one of our
brokers ben jenner
christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob
from a sales assistant
her name was pam
and to her credit
she did have this
amazing technique
with this wild twist
and jerk motion
about a month later
donnie and i decided
to doubleteam her
on a saturday afternoon
while our wives were out shopping
for christmas dresses
eventually ben married her
which was pretty amazing
considering she blew
every single guy in the office
then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later
anyway i hired my dad max
to maintain order as the enforcer
strattons very own gestapo
we called him mad max
because of his hairtrigger temper
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a
ringing telephone
who the fuck has the goddamn gall
to call this house
on a tuesday night
god damn it
youre gonna miss it
ooh please tell me
something i dont know
i wait all week for
the fucking equalizer
and they have to fucking hello
but as soon as
he picked up the phone
gene how are you gene
hed affect this weird
british accent
righto gene thatd be great
cheerio
it was absolutely bizarre
the fucking halfwit
hed hang up
you missed it
and then hes mad
max all over again
damn it
all right tell me what happened
what happened
well he discovered it
was the mothers sister
whos he who tell me who
the main guy
you know who the main
the main guy
it was his mothers sister
she showed up dead
of course mad
max didnt have to know
everything we were
doing at stratton
and then theres a
big target and we
they get launched at the target
they stick
theres a bullseye
and the bullseyes a dollar sign
whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign
gets the most points
im gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing
so if it gets hurt what happens
cause were gonna
get fucking nuts
i dont think hes gonna get hurt
theyre like
they got like superhuman strength
i think hes gonna be fine
you cant look him
right in the eyes
you cant look him in the eye
thats a fact i saw it on pbs
they get confused
and their wires get crossed
you gotta look at their chin
like it looks like
im looking at you
but im looking at your chin
i feel like youre addressing me
right now but youre not are you
theyre like the mona lisa
they find eye contact
like wherever you are
standing in the room
and they lock in
no but there is a limit
to what we can do with them
were allowed to throw shit at em
were allowed to
throw food bananas
any food correct
but for example
what i wouldnt do is
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out
and like get some of the girls to
you know
fondle him and shit like that
that would be
thats unacceptable
lets keep that in our back pocket
this guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard
correct yes yes yes
the thing is this
is their gift okay
theyre built to be thrown
like a lawn dart
theyre top heavy like a lawn dart
so theyre built for accuracy
oh my god can we
bowl with this guy
thats his fucking brother rob
his brothers the bowling ball
the brother
you put a skateboard on him
you strap him to a skateboard
you toss him down an
alley at some pins
no shit thats interesting
swear to fucking god
can we get that guy
yeah well get that guy too
but it says here this guy
will show his cock yeah
instead of growing up yeah
he will
they are very ornery by the way
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys
safety first
safety is first all right
i want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun
ready to knock this fucker out
do we want to get like a
mace taser guns
a pellet gun maybe
no a pellet gun is gonna hurt him
i just want him out
knocked out cold
but i say we stick with
the loophole right okay
if we dont consider him a human
we just consider it an act
i think were in the clear
like the flying wallendas
you know a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody
the important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind
is that these things gossip
they get together and they gossip
thats a good point
and the last thing
that we need is them
getting together and saying
oh they made fun of us
like its gonna make
stratton look bad
thats why i love you
you think of shit like that
when they come in we treat
it just like one of us okay
one of us
gooble gobble one of us
we accept them one of us
gooble gobble one of us
we accept them one of us
gooble gobble one of us

there were three kinds of hookers
the blue chips top of the line
model material
they cost between 300 and 500
and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip
which of course i always did
then came the nasdaqs
who were pretty not great
they cost between
200 and 300 bucks
finally there were the
pink sheets skanks
they cost about 100 or less
if you didnt wear a condom
youd have to get a penicillin shot
the next day
and pray your dick didnt fall off

on wall street
we got plans up here
thats gonna take this company
into the fucking stratosphere
wolfie wolfie
fuck merrill lynch fuck them
why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time
this way we become
the underwriters
it was our next big move
finding companies to
take public ipos
it was the only way
these wall street pricks
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop
we got arncliffe international
see we were a little different
we liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows
in order to stimulate
our freeflowing ideas
which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were mms
steve madden
we own the fucking companies
we own the companies
dont know what
a lude is ill tell you
oh wait wait wait wait wait
looks like those ludes are working
their magic on donnie right now
the quaalude
or lude as it is
commonly referred to
was first synthesized in 1951
by an indian doctor
thats dots not feathers
as a sedative
and was prescribed to stressedout
housewives with sleep disorders
but pretty soon someone figured out
that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes
you got a pretty
kickass high from it
didnt take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course
and in 1982 the us
government schedule 1d them
along with the rest of the world
which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left
no shit
you cant even buy em anymore
you people are all
shit out of luck
what are you saying what is it
steve madden
steve madden

steve
you remember those ads

look
my point is that
i know youre
investigating stratton
but for the life of me
i cant figure out why
i know were a little unorthodox
were a little
loud in the way we do things
but you gotta understand
were the new guys on the block
you know
were trying to make
a name for ourselves
but i want you to
understand we dont
do anything illegal
whatsoever
i mean you could talk to the sec
they were at my office 15 times
over the last six months
i mean i got
i got nothing to hide
well you know the sec is
a civil regulatory agency
we pursue criminal activities
exactly you go after
real criminals which
makes me wonder what the hell
youre investigating me for
i mean honestly
what is it that you think
that we did or do i dont get it
well i
look jordan i cant discuss
an ongoing investigation
no i get that no i understand
with that said
this case got dumped on my desk
did it
you know by a higherup
who needs to make a show
of looking into the new company
on the block
with all the press and everything
new loud guys
and then i end up being the schmuck
who does the looking exactly
its just you know
it bothers me
were the new guy were the one
thats banging on wall streets door
i mean you should
you should see whats going
on at the bigger firms
i mean i know all the information
its true goldman
lehman brothers merrill
collateralized debt obligations
this internet stock bullshit
i mean its a fucking travesty
i could take you stepbystep
through what exactly is occurring
all you have to do is ask
im available
thats exactly what i wanted to hear
mmmhmm
i dont see why a
little sitdown like this
cant be profitable
for the both of us
it should right
it should profit the both of us
it should
look
im gonna give you
my personal line
five days a week
you just call me feel free
ill do that
great
are you sure you guys dont
want something to drink
youre not hungry nothing
nothing no
oh no
let me ask you
and if you dont wanna
get too personal
just tell me to shut up at any time
oh
did you try to get
your brokers license at one time
did i hear that right were you
trying to take a stab at wall street
no
who you been talking to
who the fuck you been talking to
well youre investigating me
i hear things
you know what i mean
you ever think about
what wouldve happened
if you would have
stayed the course
you know what
when im riding home on the subway
and my balls are fucking sweating
im wearing the same suit
three days in a row
yeah you bet i do
ive thought about it before
who wouldnt right
right who fucking wouldnt
what do you get
another personal question
no need to answer
no thats all right jordan
what do you pull in 50 60k
something like that
a year in the ballpark
oh
well i
lets put it this way
you get a free handgun
when you sign up for the bureau
no but it fucking pisses me off
you know what i mean
you think about the people
that built this country
hardworking people like you
firefighters teachers fbi agents
end of the day you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially
it fucking makes me angry
now the one thing about wall street
and this market is
for me i feel
its good to give back
you know theres
there are situations where i can
make those situations better
for people you know
you know what i mean
opportunity
is everything
exactly
take for example
i got this one kid right
went to school for environmental
science something like that
he was bogged down
by student loans
turns out his mother needed
triple bypass surgery
jesus
right horrible situation
sure
but we got him into the market
at the right time
and chose the right stock
we gave him the right guidance
boom overnight
changed his entire life
got to put his mother into
the best hospital in new york city
it didnt work out for her
granted she passed
away unfortunately
but we gave him that opportunity
you know what im saying
its just about setting
up the right team
and then overnight
your life can change
what does what does an intern
what does an intern
make in a deal like that
well in that situation
in that particular trade
and it was one trade
north of half a million dollars
and id do that for
anybody you know
anybody that needs
the proper guidance
can you say that again
just the way you said it
just the same way
oh
i dont know what
youre talking about
oh come on
you know what im talking about
i think what jordan
just did is he
if im not mistaken
no
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer
no technically i
didnt bribe anybody
no no thats not the conversation
i heard jordan
no no according to
the us criminal code
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services
oh
that would not hold
up in a court of law
nah its not howl heard it
no no no thats the truth
but i want to tell you this
yeah
the same gentleman that told me
that you tried to get
your brokers license
also told me that
you are a straight arrow
he ran a security check on me
well
yeah when you sail
on a boat fit for a bond villain
sometimes you need to
play the part right
i think its time you both
get the fuck off my boat
what do you say hmm
you know jordan
ill tell you something
most of the wall street jackasses
that i bust
theyre to the manor born

of course
lets get down to it
what would you like to know
under what circumstances
would you be obligated
to cooperate with an fbi
or a us justice department

ca depend
ca depend
oui
ca depend on what exactly
whether america plans
to invade switzerland
in the coming months
shall i check if tanks are
rolling down the rue de la croy
yes rue de la croix
croix croix
not croy not rue de la croy
its croix
see this is what he used to do
back in law school check me
champagne champagne
yeah
yeah yeah french
fries pommes frites
and that kind of stuff
thats funny
what im asking you swiss dick
is are you going to fuck me over
i understand
perfectly you american shit
the only way
the banque réal de genéve
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in switzerland
but there are very few swiss laws
which apply to your practices
hmm
from a financial standpoint
you are now
in heaven
see i told you he was
fantastic right
if the us justice department
sent us a subpoena it would become
papier toilette
we would wipe our ass with it
unless of course it
was an investigation
into stock fraud
which is a crime here in
switzerland if im correct
then there would have to
be coopération on your part
if im not mistaken
yes
yes we would mmmhmm
assuming the account is
under your name
if it were
another name
a friends camarade
cousin
relative
yeah
hmm
was that yodeling i just heard
or did you just say
what i thought you said

now the fbi is
another animal completely

with his dick in his hand
jordan

have to work again
whatre you gonna do
spend the rest of your life in jail

five years ago when i
started stratton oakmont
with donnie azoff i knew the day
would eventually come
where id have to be moving on
and its truly with a heavy heart
that im here to say that
that that day is finally here
i wanna
i want to thank you all for your
your years of loyalty
and admiration

positions this place really
is gonna be better than ever
that i promise you okay
give them a round of applause

3000 armani suits
who drives a brandnew
mercedesbenz
a woman who spends
her winters in the bahamas
and summers in the hamptons
thats not the kimmie that i met
the kimmie that i met didnt have
two nickels to rub together
she was a single mom
on the balls of her ass
with an 8yearold son
okay she was
three months behind on her rent
and when she came to me
and asked me for a job
she asked for a 5000 advance
just so she could pay
her sons tuition
and whatd i do kimmie
go on tell them
you wrote me a check
for 25000
thats right

when a seagull flew
into the engine
three people killed
you want a sign from god
well after all this
i finally got the message
do you dream of becoming
financially independent
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills
would you like to own
a home like this
but can barely afford
to pay your rent
my name is jordan belfort
and theres no secret
to wealth creation
no matter who you are
no matter where you came from
you too can become
financially independent
in just a matter of months
all you need is a strategy
when i was 24 years old
i made a decision not just
to survive but to thrive
at first i didnt feel like
deals like these were possible
but we have the house
and we have a 33000 profit
i certainly believe now
think about it for a second
if you dont have the guts
to attend jordan belforts
straight line persuasion
system seminar
then how do you expect
to make any money
if you want to be
a millionaire someday
have some guts make a decision
jordan belforts
setup worked for me
because i worked hard for it
and if it doesnt work for you
its because youre lazy
and you should get a
job at mcdonalds
theres nobody holding
you back from financial freedom
and theres nobody stopping
you from making millions
dont just sit at home
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you
i changed all these peoples lives
and i can change yours too
so come to my seminar
the life of your dreams is only
good to see you again jordan
youre under arrest
you gotta be joking
youre kidding me
hey get the fuck away from me

im fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here
you fucking cocksucker

one dumb enough
to get himself arrested
on u s soil
i know

even more fucked
was that he got busted

in order to pay for

i know
i could fucking kiss you all over
all right enough enough
you want a beer pal

i got this nonalcoholic shit
whats that
a nonalcoholic beer
its got no alcohol
its a beer
yeah with no alcohol
but if you drink enough
if you drink a lot
they get you fucked up
no theres no alcohol
thats the fucking point
im not a scientist
i dont know what the fuck
youre talking about
i can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer
i know but i dont drink
you remember
i dont drink anymore
oh you wanna go inside
and blow some lines
of baking powder
or baking soda
cant imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up
yeah
i love it
hows being sober
fucking sucks
boring right
so boring i wanna kill myself
theres a term
and we dont like to use it
unless circumstances dictate
and i think they do
dictate in this case
and the term is grenada
have you ever heard of grenada
no no i havent
grenadas very interesting because
it is a small island nation
that was invaded by the united
states of america in 1983
its about 90000 people
and essentially it means
this case is unloseable
okay
so you know we can come in
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants
nobody gives a fuck
im gonna win
you sir
are whats known
as a grenada
hmm
youre looking at real prison time
hmm
money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years
and our case couldnt be stronger
if we caught you
shoving cash in your mattress
is that right
hey jordan jordan
your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college
thats not our ambition here
theres other people
involved in this too
we think they need to
see their day in court as well
why do i sense
theres an offer in the air
look at him hes got a sense
what are you kreskin
full cooperation he provides
us with a comprehensive list
of all the coconspirators
spanning the last seven years
and he also agrees to wear a wire
wait
did you just say wear a wire
a wire mmmhmm
what does that mean
you want me to rat is that it
no i want you to cooperate
no you want me to rat right
yes we want you to rat
thats fucking exactly
what we want you to do to rat
how was cristys party
fine
good
babe i spoke to the
lawyers again today
i have some really
really great news
mmmhmm
turns out youre completely
off the hook honey
i know that already
right exactly
you never did anything wrong
in the first place right
it turns out all the fbi really
wants from me is to uh
to cooperate
you know
turns out i have so
much information
about the stock market
and wall street
i could save the government
years of heartache not to mention
countless dollars
mmmhmm
but it gets even better babe
because if i do
decide to cooperate
i might only be
looking at four short years
in which case you know
we could start fresh
maybe sell the house
and any fines that id have to pay
wouldnt be due till
after i serve my term
so wed still have plenty of
money left over you know
mmmhmm
the only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends
like you said theres no friends
on wall street right
right right exactly
theres a silver lining
to that too honey
because they said eventually
eventually everyones gonna have to
give information on this case
so at the end of the day it might
not even be a factor you know
well thats good news right
yeah yeah
im really happy for you
what do you mean happy for me
sweetheart
you should be happy for
the both of us right
yeah right
