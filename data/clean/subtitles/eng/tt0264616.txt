 how s it going  griff 
i can t complain    and won t 
is that him 
yep  might just be some crackpot but
i figured i should call you anyway 
did he ask for me by name 
nope  asked for the agent
in charge of
the  god s hand  case  said he had
some important info on it 
 didn t say what 
 nope  said he d only talk to you 
you the agent in charge of
the  god s hand  case 
that s right 
wesley doyle 
that a picture
of you and your mother  huh 
i d appreciate it if you wouldn t
take things off my desk 
sorry about that 
guess i ve been in here a while 
already had a look at all
your plaques and your citations 
didn t really care
to have a look at those 
what can i do for you  mr    
meiks 
my name s fenton meiks 
now listen  this may sound
a little bit crazy but   
i know who
the  god s hand  killer is 
all right  i ll bite 
who 
you haven t even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me 
why is that 
because in a case like this
nobody just walks in the office
and tells you who the killer is 
it doesn t happen that way 
 sometimes truth defies reason 
 yeah 
so who is it then 
my brother 
what makes you think that 
i got a call from him   
last night 
hello 
 hello 
 demons are taking over the world 
adam 
i can t destroy them all 
 i can t take it anymore 
 now  let s talk about this  adam 
but there s nothing to talk about 
it s over   
whatever happens 
you have to take me to the rose
garden  you promised  remember 
 now  that s just till   
 remember  
you promised 
meat 
that s where all this took place 
it s about 200 miles west of here 
just north of abilene 
why did you go to thurman 
to bury adam 
in the rose garden 
why would you do that 
i promised him i would 
a long time ago 
that s a pretty
wild story  mr  meiks 
i don t see what  if anything 
this has got to do with my case 
adam is the  god s hand  killer 
agent doyle 
he s the one you re looking for 
did he tell you that before
he asked you to take him to thurman 
if that s the case 
you left that part out 
i haven t finished yet 
 oh  there s more 
 a lot more 
excuse me a minute 
meat sheriff s office 
can i talk to a sheriff  please 
this is agent doyle of the fbi 
he s not in right now 
may i help you 
well  i ve got a man here
in my office  name of fenton meiks 
fenton meiks 
what s he doing there 
 you know him 
 he caused a ruckus here earlier 
he stole an ambulance
and his brother s body too 
did my story check out 
yeah  it did 
so am i under arrest now 
you damn sure should be 
the sheriff s willing to forget it
if you bring that ambulance back 
nobody wants to press any charges 
 well you gotta love small towns 
 why would you go to all that
trouble just to walk in here
and confess it to me 
i m here because i can t live
with what i know anymore 
what exactly do you know 
that is your mother  isn t it 
 yeah  it is 
 i knew it 
you got the same eyes 
why don t we
get back to your story 
what makes you think
that your brother s
the  god s hand  killer 
i know it was him 
how do you know 
it started back in thurman 
it was near
the summer of 1979 
i got the joy  joy  joy  joy
down in my heart 
you re supposed to say   where  
i don t want
to sing that dumb song 
you don t have to sing 
just say  where  
all right  where 
not now  i ll point
to you when it s time 
i got the joy  joy  joy  joy
down in my heart 
 where 
 down in my heart 
 where 
 down in my heart 
i got the joy  joy  joy  joy
down in my heart 
and if the devil doesn t
like it  he can sit on a tack 
 ouch

and if the devil doesn t like it 
he can sit on a tack today 
 who was that chick that threw up 
 katie hagen  she s sure pretty 
 it was real messy though 
 oh  yeah 
all over the floor 
and when the principal fell   
i got the joy  joy  joy  joy   
we lived right behind
the thurman public rose garden
in the house where they used to keep
the gardeners back in the fifties 
dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and mom got married 
the unexpected incident that
creates those dangerous moments 
the ropes were suddenly
off the alligator 
adam was 3 years
younger than me 
our mom died
giving birth to him  so
i basically took care
of him ever since i can remember 
our dad worked as a mechanic
over in jupiter 
he usually got home around 5 30
and we d all have dinner together 
 hey  kiddos 
 hey  dad 
something sure smells good 
 how was your day 
 it was all right 
let s eat 
 whoa  tiger  save some for us 
 i sure love peas 
you must  you better be careful 
though  you might turn into one 
 how did you do on that math test 
 i barely passed 
well  i was never
any good at math either 
shoot  i still can t do
anything without a calculator 
yeah  but there s going
to be another test next week 
 and that one s going to be harder 
 hey  don t sound so glum 
tell you what 
we ll sit down this weekend
and we ll see if we can t figure out
that junk together  okay 
all right 
hey  fenton  can we go see
 meatballs  after school tomorrow 
 we ve already seen it 
 i want to see it again 
nah  we re gonna go

 i m just joking with you  egghead

sleep tight

that s right 
love you guys 
 love you too  dad

i wanna see  meatballs  again 
fine  you can see  meatballs 
and i ll see  the warriors  
but i don t like
to watch movies by myself 
too bad 
please 
all right 
just go to bed 
that was our family 
just the three of us 
all of mom and dad s relatives had
died  so there was no one but us 
we didn t mind though 
we didn t need anybody else 
we were happy
together  until   
 fenton  wake up 
 dad 
 i ve got something to tell you 
 what s wrong 
it s okay 
adam  wake up and listen 
i need you both
to listen to me very carefully 
something s happened 
he said he d had
a vision that night 
a vision from god 
an angel came to him
and told him
the truth of this world
and revealed god s
special purpose for our family 
the end of the world
is coming  it s near 
the angel showed me 
there are demons among us 
the devil has released them
for the final battle 
it s being fought right now 
but nobody knows it
except us and others like us 
 i m scared  dad 
 there s nothing to be afraid of 
we ve been chosen by god  he will
protect us  he s given us special
jobs to do 
we don t fear these demons 
we destroy them 
we pick them up one by one  and
we pitch them out of this world 
that s god s purpose for us 
the angel called us  god s hands  
so we re like superheroes 
that s right 
we re a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world 
but  dad  that
doesn t make any sense 
i know it sounds that way 
son  but it s the truth 
so what are our superpowers 
well   
we can see the demons
while other people can t 
the angel told me god would send us
3 weapons to destroy them with 
magical weapons 
i imagine so 
when do we get them 
i don t know 
the angel just said soon 
that s all i was told  except
we re not supposed to tell anybody 
absolutely no one 
if we do  we put them
and ourselves in danger 
fenton 
don t worry  it s okay 
it s a lot to understand 
i waited to tell you until i had
a chance to figure it out myself 
but the angel said
i had to do it now 
fenton 
i didn t know
what to say or how to feel 
do you understand what i told you 
judgment day is here 
it was too messed up
to understand or even acknowledge 
soon we ll all be in heaven 
you  me  adam  with mommy 
i didn t realize it at the moment 
at least not consciously   
she s waiting
to see us in heaven 
but my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over 
 and there were dark things there 
 judgment day is here 
very dark things 
we ve been chosen by god 
and my little boy s mind
just couldn t take it 
adam  fenton 
up and at em  boys 
morning  kiddo 
hey  come on 
lazybones  it s late 
we overslept 
let s go 
snap to it and
get dressed  i gotta get to work 
drop you guys off on the way 
what s wrong with you 
nothing 
hey  let me have a bite of that 
none of us mentioned it 
it was only a dream  a nightmare 
nothing that crazy could be real 
everything was okay 
just like before 
have a good day at school  boys 
and remember not to tell anyone 
we won t  dad  bye 
okay  now  i want you all to copy
down this sentence  we re gonna go
through the structure 
 the girl in
the blue dress    
i refused to believe it 
  walked    
 that next week was a dream too 
 her   
brown dog  
like when dad started bringing
home the  magical  weapons 
he was on his way to work   
when god called to him 
be careful 
i still can t understand
what these gloves are for though 
just a long  long dream 
i want you to write this down at the
top of your pages in big letters 
boys  boys  look at this 
we got them all 
it won t be long now 
the angel came again
last night and told me
that god will be sending us
a list of the first 7 demons soon 
it wasn t real 
it couldn t be 
i just had to wait it out 
 come over here a minute  fenton 
 i m washing dishes 
that can wait  come here 
i want to talk to you 
i know you ve had some trouble
adjusting to everything 
and i m sorry 
but god has willed this
and we must obey god 
maybe you just dreamed it 
i didn t dream it  i wouldn t
make up something like that  son 
maybe   
maybe you re not
right in the head 
it happened  fenton 
it s true 
you ll see that soon 
that s what i wanted to talk
to you about  i got the first list 
the angel came to him
while he was at work 
dad 
 these are people s names 
 that s right 
and they ll look
like people too 
but they re not 
the angel said
when i lay my hands on them
i ll reveal them
for what they truly are 
that s what the gloves are for 
i get them and bring them
back here with the gloves on 
and once they re back here  i take
the gloves off and reveal them 
you ll see 
then you ll believe 
does anyone know
what this word means 
do you remember
what this word means 
the dream had finally ended 
it was all real 
and i had to stop him 
the obvious answer was to tell
someone what he was planning 
but i couldn t do that 
i loved him even
if he had gone crazy 
dad  look  i got a list too 
where did you get this  adam 
god gave it to me 
isn t travis shed that boy that was
picking on you at school last week 
he s a demon 
tell the truth  adam 
you made this list up
yourself  didn t you 
 no  god did 
 adam 
come on  right here 
now  listen to me  son 
you can t make stuff like that up 
we destroy demons 
if we were to use your list 
we d be killing people 
and we can never do that 
now  destroying demons
is a good thing 
killing people is bad 
you understand 
i m sorry  dad 
that s all right 
it s okay 
you just got to have
a little patience  don t worry 
god will send you
your own list when you re older 
okay  go do some homework 
the only thing
left to do was to tell 
that was easier said than done 
dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night 
but he didn t come home from work 
when s dad coming home 
i don t know 
think he s destroying a demon 
 it s all make believe  adam 
 no  it s not  it s true 
listen to me  none of that demon
junk is real  daddy just made it up 
 no  he didn t 
 he did too 
just like santa claus 
you remember when you caught dad
putting our presents under the tree 
it s just like that 
adam 
have i ever lied to you 
all right  look 
dad made up this whole thing  the
names on his list are real people 
do you understand 
 but why would he make it up 
 i don t know 
but i think we should leave 
you mean    run away 
will you go with me 
only for
 a little while 
 i don t want to leave dad 
neither do i 
but we might have to 
why 
dad s gonna kill somebody 
son  come over here 
come on  i need your help 
dad 
come on out here  adam 
shine that light over here 
hey  dad  who is that 
that s a demon  son 
come on in here  boys 
it s all right 
goon  don t be afraid 
god came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come 
after work he drove
down to jacksonville 
about 45 minutes or so
southwest of thurman 
he said he d never been there before
but he had no problem finding it 
god was leading him 
 cynthia harbridge 
 yes 
 dad  don t  please don t 
 fenton 
if i could spare
you this  i would 
but we are god s servants
and his will must be served 
don t be afraid  son 
is that true 
why would i make it up 
where s your father now 
dead 
sir  i was thinking
about heading out 
unless you need me to stay 
no 
that s all right 
you go ahead 
have a good night  sir 
so he killed that woman
right there in front of you 
but not to his way of thinking 
you see  to him he hadn t killed
a woman  he d destroyed a demon 
he believed that when
he laid his hands on her 
it revealed her sins 
dad  don t  please 
no  adam 
do it like this 
it s gotta be done
in a certain way 
the angel was real specific 
why out here
in the rose garden 
god chose it 
just like he chose us  i suppose 
don t cry for her  fenton 
she wasn t human 
didn t you see
when i touched her 
i saw it  dad 
you killed her 
i didn t kill her  son 
i destroyed her 
she was a demon 
you know  i wasn t so sure
i could do it myself 
i mean  she looked like
a woman to me too 
but after i touched her 
all i could see was the evil 
and i had to do it 
i m sorry you
didn t see it too 
you will next time 
you    you re gonna do it again 
this is our job now  son 
you ve got to accept that 
i won t let you 
 we are doing god s work here 
 i ll tell 
if you do  someone will die 
the angel was clear on that 
do you understand 
answer me  fenton 
do you understand 
so you didn t tell 
no  i should have 
but i was afraid 
i mean  i loved my father 
but i was terrified of him 
so now you understand
why i know my brother
is the  god s hand  killer 
have you got
any physical proof 
i read in the paper
that only one of the bodies of the 6
victims had been found  is it true 
you read it
in the papers  didn t you 
it doesn t necessarily
mean it s true 
well  in this case it does 
see  the first victim
was found mutilated
with a note saying that
god s hand had taken him 
all the rest  only notes
were found  no bodies 
how do you know they re dead 
oh  we don t for sure 
but the first note said we wouldn t
find any more bodies from then on 
said
he wanted to keep them 
i got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are 
the rose garden 
now why didn t you
tell me that in the first place 
would you have believed me 
come on 
here 
what s this 
put them on 
or i ll put them on for you 
let s go 
so tell me something 
why didn t you come see me sooner 
you re gonna wanna
get on 30 east up here 
i can t imagine how you can keep
something like that inside so long 
i guess i avoided it
because i wanted to 
you never did tell me why it is you
just keep one picture of your mother
in your office 
my mother was murdered a couple days
after that picture was taken 
butchered by some whacked out
killer like your dad 
did they ever catch him 
no 
is that why you took this job 
you re pretty good at this 
you ever think about becoming a cop 
well  you know 
when i was a kid 
well  you got
the instincts for it 
a cop s gotta have
good instincts 
you know what mine
are telling me now 
you re hiding
something from me 
what is it
you think i m hiding 
why don t you just keep talking 
maybe i ll figure it out 
you okay  dad 
i m all right  son 
here i come 
dad  why did god
let this happen to me 
don t blame god  davy 
it wasn t his fault 
god let me do it 
what god lets you do is decide
for yourself what you will do 
 you re not a puppet with strings 
 no 
so god doesn t make
you do anything 
he wants you
to decide for yourself 
after that night 
nothing much happened 
dad didn t mention it
anymore  neither did adam 
once a full month had gone by  i d
completely convinced myself it was
over and everything
was gonna be all right 
 bye 
 see you all later 
did you see
 dukes of hazard  last night 
remember when daisy duke bent over 
i like boss hogg

when people could just disappear
without anyone knowing
where they went or why 
he said those were the moments
when god s hands could take you 
according to dad  nothing 
not even a camera  could catch us 
we were invisible
when we were god s hands

and don t wake your brother 
sit down 
your brother told me
what you said last night 
i want you to know i ve never
killed anything in my whole life 
that s a lie
and you know it 
i did a lot of thinking
and praying after you went to bed 
i asked the angel to visit you 
but instead he visited me 
and he told me something   
i don t want to believe 
what 
it doesn t matter 
because together you and i
are gonna prove him wrong 
you just don t have any faith 
that s why
you can t see the truth 
but we re gonna change that 
i want you to dig
a hole right here 
need to be
about 10 feet deep and
15 feet wide on both sides 
the length and the width
should form a perfect square 
 what 
 you heard me 
why 
because i m your father and you ll
do what i tell you  understand 
 do you 
 yes  sir 
all right  i expect half that to be
dug by the time i get home tonight 
 dad  i can t do that 
 pray 
i started digging that goddamn
hole  but i did not pray 
i would not 
i hated god 
i despised him 
my hatred helped me dig 
kept me going 
dad s or god s or whoever s plan
it was  it would not work on me 
i knew what dad
was doing was wrong 
and nothing
was gonna change that 
fenton 
sorry i told on you 
 you tell him about running away 
 no 
will you go with me then 
there s no reason to go 
 he s a killer 
 no  he s not 
i ve been praying for you 
have you been praying 
nope  and i m not going to 
 but dad said   
 i don t care what dad said 
he might be able to make me dig
this hole but he can t make me pray 
just get out of here
and leave me alone 
i ll help you if you promise
you won t tell dad 
 i don t want your help 
 but there s another
 shovel in the shed 
 get out of here 
butthole 
i wanted to run away   
far away  but
i still couldn t leave adam 
no matter how crazy dad was turning 
besides  there was nowhere to go 
 finally gave up  huh  kiddo 
 i ll be there again in the morning

no reason to cause yourself pain 
i got an extra pair
of work gloves in the shed 
i want you to use
these from now on 
it won t do you any good now that
you ve wrecked your hands  but
a couple of days
and you ll be fine 
i want you to know
i m proud of you 
and i know god s
proud of you too 
take some time off and let
those blisters callous over

well  good night then 
come on  tiger 
bedtime 
fenton gets to stay up 
please  dad 
come on 
brush your teeth  i ll be in
to say goodnight in a minute 
i kept digging 
my hands bled 
but i wouldn t stop 
i kept at it morning 
noon and night for 5 days 
and by the sixth day 
that hole was as dark
as my hatred for dad s god 
well  you finished it all right 
betcha you didn t pray once
the whole time  did you 
nope 
we started the cellar after that 
at least that s
what dad called it 
but i knew better 
we were building
a dungeon down there 
we basically built
a big wooden box in the ground 
good  boys  get it
over there  cover it good 
dad said it would hold 
he said god would see to it 
get back here
and help me push 
come on  keep it going

come out of the night and stop me 
but i had to do it 
it had to end 
 hello 
 1034 to any and all units
in the vicinity of garden 
we have complaints of a 501 driving
on the alternate side of the street 
hello 
hello

 making up stories like that 
 but  it s true  i can show you

come on in 
i was about to head over to lake
thompson  to get a jump on the bass 
and he comes running in
with this wild story 
 yep  it s quite a tale all right 
 it s the truth and you know it 
it makes me mad to think that he
told everyone down
at your office too 
you can set your mind at ease about
that  i was the only one there 
course  i don t believe
a word of it 
what does get me 
though  is why would he
make up such a crazy story 
i don t know why he made it up 
probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier 
did you tell him about that 
he s lying 
just check the shed 
i don t know what to do with him 
well  they hit puberty  seem
to lose all respect for you 
me and my boys survived it 
you will too 
just check the shed or the rose
garden  i could show you where
 they re buried 
 why don t you just quit all this 
please  i can show you 
maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down 
well  if it has to be done 
it has to be done

cellar  goon down and check it out 
just watch your step 
i m not much of a carpenter 
i don t see a thing

get into over a thing like this 
they must have moved him
because he was here 
adam  adam s got him
somewhere  i know it 
 i think i ve seen enough 
 but   
i could show you where
the bodies are buried

you just have
to accept god s will 
a week 
i can t stay

 i ll pray for you 
adam 
adam  adam 
the days came and went 
i counted them by the light through
the hatch door and adam s visits 
i only slept when
i passed out from exhaustion 
what about your dad 
didn t he ever come back
to at least check on you 
on the seventh day 
has god spoken to you yet 
there is no god 
i lost count of the days
after that  it felt like weeks 
i finally went beyond fear
into total insanity 
i saw god 
he had finally
sent me a vision 
it was then that i understood my
destiny just like dad said i would 
dad  fenton s not answering 
fenton  fenton 
fenton 
fenton 
what  come on  kiddo 
give me that water 
easy  boy 
easy  easy 
here you go  kiddo 
here you go  buddy 
dad 
i saw god 
just try to take a little sip 
slow down there  don t want to eat
too fast  you ll make yourself sick 
so did god
tell you about the demons 
sorry i ever doubted you 
i m sorry too  son 
what did god look like 
 kind of hard to describe 
 was he big 
adam 
let your brother eat in peace 
he can t explain something
 like that 
 but i want to know 
 then maybe you should pray for it 
 it s not fair 
all i ve ever seen are demons 
and he gets to see god 
that s right  but look at
the price he paid 
that s all behind us now 
it s a new day 
isn t it  fenton 
so we gonna go
get us a demon now 
after a while 
when fenton s ready 
a week later i was ready 
my first demon was to be
brad white from dallas 
 there it is 
 i see it 
you re sure
you re ready for this 
yes  sir 
i bought these for you  you ll need
them now that god has spoken to you 
 all right  let s go 
 i want to go too  dad 
not this time  adam  you stay
here and keep your eyes peeled 
don t worry 
your time will come 
let s go 
 sorry to bother you but   
 yeah 
my mom and i  we got
a flat on our van 
 yeah 
 well  i was wondering if you had
a tire iron  we went off
and left ours at home 
hey  pal  what s
with the gloves 
oh  to change the tire 
 don t want to get your hands dirty 
 yeah 
brad  who is it 
mind your business 
you fucking bitch 
goddamn women 
yeah  i think
i got one for you 
 out back 
 great 
back here 
let s see 
here it is 
shit 
grab his legs 
brad white 
you know  fenton 
i ve been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started 
i m ready to fulfill
my destiny 
i m proud of you  son 
fuck you 
you fuck 
get your fucking hands away 
get the fuck off 
destroy him 
dad 
dad  no  no  no 
no 
i buried him
in the rose garden 
we went to the sheriff s
office a week later
and told them
that dad just didn t
come home one day 
they filed a missing persons
but they didn t find anything 
after a while they sent us
to separate orphanages 
so 
nobody ever knew
about any of this 
no 
not until now 
what about adam 
he didn t tell anybody 
mind if we just sit here  i don t
much feel like talking anymore 
tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother 
it was later on that night 
adam 
if you ever destroy me 
promise me you ll bury me here 
i promise to god
i ll bury you here 
i don t get it 
he promised you that
he d bury you here 
yeah 
if he killed you 
no  not killed  destroyed 
don t make any sense 
yes  it does 
if that man standing
in front of you is adam meiks 
so you killed all those people 
no  no  i told you before  i ve
never killed anyone in my life 
fenton was the killer 
just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth 
you ll understand soon 
just let me show you
where i buried fenton 
hold it 
you take it real slow 
that s it 
this is the spot 
there s too many graves here 
there s only six victims 
fenton didn t bury
his victims here 
he kept them as trophies
in his basement 
this is where i put demons 
you thought
your brother was a demon 
he was 
that s why he couldn t
see the truth 
dad knew it too 
he just couldn t accept it 
you see  god asked dad
to destroy his son 
much like he asked abraham
to sacrifice his son isaac 
but dad couldn t do it 
and god didn t take pity
on dad like he did abraham 
so he handed down
the duty to me 
fenton knew i d come  that s why
he left those notes to lure me in 
i guess he figured when the killings
made the news that i d come for him 
but i had to wait
till god put him on my list 
to come before that
would have been murder 
adam 
jesus christ  you really
do believe all this stuff 
i ve always believed 
that s all lies  adam 
no  it s not  i see it
when he touches them 
you re just crazy as hell 
fenton or adam
or whatever your damn name is 
i don t really give a fuck 
all i need to know right now
is you re a murdering
son of a bitch 
and i got you 
maybe 
but that s not gonna bring
your mother back  is it 
she s dead
and her killer
got away  didn t he 
goddamn you 
dirty little son of a   
how did you know 
you were on my list 
you didn t think anybody
knew about that  did you 
god knew 
that s why he sent me 
i m an fbi agent 
they ll come looking for me 
no  they won t 
they ll keep
looking for fenton 
you re going to be
his last victim 
they ve seen you 
they ll know it was you 
god will protect me 
i can t talk right now  i can t 
i ll get back to you 
 here 
 thank you

can remember what he looks like 
look  i told you
