hows it going griff
i cant complain and wont
is that him

i figured i should call you anyway
did he ask for me by name
nope asked for the agent

the gods hand case said he had
some important info on it

now listen this may sound
a little bit crazy but
i know who
the gods hand killer is
all right ill bite
who
you havent even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me
why is that
because in a case like this
nobody just walks in the office
and tells you who the killer is
it doesnt happen that way
sometimes truth defies reason
yeah
so who is it then
my brother
what makes you think that
i got a call from him
last night
hello
hello
demons are taking over the world
adam
i cant destroy them all
i cant take it anymore
now lets talk about this adam
but theres nothing to talk about
its over
whatever happens
you have to take me to the rose
garden you promised remember
now thats just till
remember
you promised
meat
thats where all this took place
its about 200 miles west of here
just north of abilene
why did you go to thurman
to bury adam
in the rose garden
why would you do that
i promised him i would
a long time ago
thats a pretty
wild story mr meiks
i dont see what if anything
this has got to do with my case
adam is the gods hand killer
agent doyle
hes the one youre looking for
did he tell you that before
he asked you to take him to thurman
if thats the case
you left that part out
i havent finished yet
oh theres more
a lot more

fenton meiks
whats he doing there
you know him
he caused a ruckus here earlier
he stole an ambulance
and his brothers body too

yeah it did
so am i under arrest now
you damn sure should be
the sheriffs willing to forget it
if you bring that ambulance back
nobody wants to press any charges
well you gotta love small towns
why would you go to all that
trouble just to walk in here
and confess it to me
im here because i cant live
with what i know anymore
what exactly do you know
that is your mother isnt it

we lived right behind
the thurman public rose garden
in the house where they used to keep
the gardeners back in the fifties
dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and mom got married
the unexpected incident that
creates those dangerous moments
the ropes were suddenly
off the alligator
adam was 3 years
younger than me
our mom died
giving birth to him so
i basically took care
of him ever since i can remember
our dad worked as a mechanic
over in jupiter
he usually got home around 530
and wed all have dinner together
hey kiddos

whoa tiger save some for us
i sure love peas
you must you better be careful
though you might turn into one
how did you do on that math test

anything without a calculator

i wanna see meatballs again
fine you can see meatballs
and ill see the warriors
but i dont like
to watch movies by myself
too bad
please
all right
just go to bed
that was our family
just the three of us
all of mom and dads relatives had
died so there was no one but us
we didnt mind though
we didnt need anybody else
we were happy
together until
fenton wake up
dad
ive got something to tell you
whats wrong
its okay
adam wake up and listen
i need you both
to listen to me very carefully
somethings happened
he said hed had
a vision that night
a vision from god
an angel came to him
and told him
the truth of this world
and revealed gods
special purpose for our family
the end of the world
is coming its near
the angel showed me
there are demons among us
the devil has released them
for the final battle
its being fought right now
but nobody knows it
except us and others like us
im scared dad
theres nothing to be afraid of
weve been chosen by god he will
protect us hes given us special
jobs to do
we dont fear these demons
we destroy them
we pick them up one by one and
we pitch them out of this world
thats gods purpose for us
the angel called us gods hands
so were like superheroes
thats right
were a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world
but dad that
doesnt make any sense
i know it sounds that way
son but its the truth
so what are our superpowers
well
we can see the demons
while other people cant
the angel told me god would send us
3 weapons to destroy them with
magical weapons
i imagine so
when do we get them
i dont know
the angel just said soon
thats all i was told except
were not supposed to tell anybody
absolutely no one
if we do we put them
and ourselves in danger
fenton
dont worry its okay
its a lot to understand
i waited to tell you until i had
a chance to figure it out myself
but the angel said
i had to do it now
fenton
i didnt know
what to say or how to feel
do you understand what i told you
judgment day is here
it was too messed up
to understand or even acknowledge
soon well all be in heaven
you me adam with mommy
i didnt realize it at the moment
at least not consciously
shes waiting
to see us in heaven
but my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over
and there were dark things there
judgment day is here
very dark things
weve been chosen by god
and my little boys mind
just couldnt take it
adam fenton
up and atem boys
morning kiddo
hey come on
lazybones its late
we overslept
lets go
snap to it and
get dressed i gotta get to work
drop you guys off on the way
whats wrong with you
nothing
hey let me have a bite of that
none of us mentioned it
it was only a dream a nightmare
nothing that crazy could be real
everything was okay
just like before
have a good day at school boys
and remember not to tell anyone
we wont dad bye
okay now i want you all to copy
down this sentence were gonna go
through the structure
the girl in
the blue dress
i refused to believe it
walked
that next week was a dream too
her
brown dog
like when dad started bringing
home the magical weapons
he was on his way to work
when god called to him
be careful
i still cant understand
what these gloves are for though
just a long long dream
i want you to write this down at the
top of your pages in big letters
boys boys look at this
we got them all
it wont be long now
the angel came again
last night and told me
that god will be sending us
a list of the first 7 demons soon
it wasnt real
it couldnt be
i just had to wait it out
come over here a minute fenton
im washing dishes
that can wait come here
i want to talk to you
i know youve had some trouble
adjusting to everything
and im sorry
but god has willed this
and we must obey god
maybe you just dreamed it
i didnt dream it i wouldnt
make up something like that son
maybe
maybe youre not
right in the head
it happened fenton
its true
youll see that soon
thats what i wanted to talk
to you about i got the first list
the angel came to him
while he was at work
dad
these are peoples names
thats right
and theyll look
like people too
but theyre not
the angel said
when i lay my hands on them
ill reveal them
for what they truly are
thats what the gloves are for
i get them and bring them
back here with the gloves on
and once theyre back here i take
the gloves off and reveal them
youll see
then youll believe
does anyone know
what this word means
do you remember
what this word means
the dream had finally ended
it was all real
and i had to stop him
the obvious answer was to tell
someone what he was planning
but i couldnt do that
i loved him even
if he had gone crazy
dad look i got a list too
where did you get this adam
god gave it to me
isnt travis shed that boy that was
picking on you at school last week
hes a demon
tell the truth adam
you made this list up
yourself didnt you
no god did
adam
come on right here
now listen to me son
you cant make stuff like that up
we destroy demons
if we were to use your list
wed be killing people
and we can never do that
now destroying demons
is a good thing
killing people is bad
you understand
im sorry dad
thats all right
its okay
you just got to have
a little patience dont worry
god will send you
your own list when youre older
okay go do some homework
the only thing
left to do was to tell
that was easier said than done
dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night
but he didnt come home from work
whens dad coming home
i dont know
think hes destroying a demon
its all makebelieve adam
no its not its true
listen to me none of that demon
junk is real daddy just made it up
no he didnt
he did too
just like santa claus
you remember when you caught dad
putting our presents under the tree
its just like that
adam
have i ever lied to you
all right look
dad made up this whole thing the
names on his list are real people
do you understand
but why would he make it up
i dont know
but i think we should leave
you mean run away
will you go with me
only for
a little while
i dont want to leave dad
neither do i
but we might have to
why
dads gonna kill somebody
son come over here
come on i need your help
dad
come on out here adam
shine that light over here
hey dad who is that
thats a demon son
come on in here boys
its all right
goon dont be afraid
god came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come
after work he drove
down to jacksonville
about 45 minutes or so
southwest of thurman
he said hed never been there before
but he had no problem finding it
god was leading him
cynthia harbridge
yes
dad dont please dont
fenton
if i could spare
you this i would
but we are gods servants
and his will must be served
dont be afraid son
is that true
why would i make it up
wheres your father now
dead
sir i was thinking
about heading out
unless you need me to stay
no
thats all right
you go ahead
have a good night sir
so he killed that woman
right there in front of you
but not to his way of thinking
you see to him he hadnt killed
a woman hed destroyed a demon
he believed that when
he laid his hands on her
it revealed her sins
dad dont please
no adam
do it like this
its gotta be done
in a certain way
the angel was real specific
why out here
in the rose garden
god chose it
just like he chose us i suppose
dont cry for her fenton
she wasnt human
didnt you see
when i touched her
i saw it dad
you killed her
i didnt kill her son
i destroyed her
she was a demon
you know i wasnt so sure
i could do it myself
i mean she looked like
a woman to me too
but after i touched her
all i could see was the evil
and i had to do it
im sorry you
didnt see it too
you will next time
you youre gonna do it again
this is our job now son
youve got to accept that
i wont let you
we are doing gods work here
ill tell
if you do someone will die
the angel was clear on that
do you understand
answer me fenton
do you understand
so you didnt tell
no i should have
but i was afraid
i mean i loved my father
but i was terrified of him
so now you understand
why i know my brother
is the gods hand killer
have you got
any physical proof
i read in the paper
that only one of the bodies of the 6
victims had been found is it true
you read it
in the papers didnt you
it doesnt necessarily
mean its true
well in this case it does
see the first victim
was found mutilated
with a note saying that
gods hand had taken him
all the rest only notes
were found no bodies
how do you know theyre dead
oh we dont for sure
but the first note said we wouldnt
find any more bodies from then on
said
he wanted to keep them
i got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are
the rose garden
now why didnt you
tell me that in the first place
would you have believed me
come on
here
whats this
put them on
or ill put them on for you
lets go
so tell me something
why didnt you come see me sooner
youre gonna wanna
get on 30 east up here
i cant imagine how you can keep
something like that inside so long
i guess i avoided it
because i wanted to
you never did tell me why it is you
just keep one picture of your mother
in your office
my mother was murdered a couple days
after that picture was taken
butchered by some whackedout
killer like your dad
did they ever catch him
no
is that why you took this job
youre pretty good at this
you ever think about becoming a cop
well you know
when i was a kid
well you got
the instincts for it
a cops gotta have
good instincts
you know what mine
are telling me now
youre hiding
something from me
what is it
you think im hiding
why dont you just keep talking
maybe ill figure it out
you okay dad
im all right son
here i come
dad why did god
let this happen to me
dont blame god davy
it wasnt his fault
god let me do it
what god lets you do is decide
for yourself what you will do
youre not a puppet with strings
no
so god doesnt make
you do anything
he wants you
to decide for yourself
after that night
nothing much happened
dad didnt mention it
anymore neither did adam
once a full month had gone by id
completely convinced myself it was
over and everything
was gonna be all right

i did a lot of thinking
and praying after you went to bed
i asked the angel to visit you
but instead he visited me
and he told me something
i dont want to believe

it doesnt matter
because together you and i
are gonna prove him wrong
you just dont have any faith
thats why
you cant see the truth
but were gonna change that
i want you to dig
a hole right here

dug by the time i get home tonight

i hated god
i despised him
my hatred helped me dig
kept me going
dads or gods or whoevers plan

was doing was wrong
and nothing
was gonna change that
fenton

that hole was as dark
as my hatred for dads god
well you finished it all right
betcha you didnt pray once
the whole time did you

we started the cellar after that
at least thats
what dad called it
but i knew better
we were building
a dungeon down there

come out of the night and stop me
but i had to do it
it had to end

on the alternate side of the street

i was about to head over to lake
thompson to get a jump on the bass
and he comes running in
with this wild story

it makes me mad to think that he
told everyone down
at your office too
you can set your mind at ease about
that i was the only one there
course i dont believe
a word of it
what does get me
though is why would he
make up such a crazy story
i dont know why he made it up
probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier
did you tell him about that
hes lying
just check the shed
i dont know what to do with him
well they hit puberty seem
to lose all respect for you
me and my boys survived it
you will too
just check the shed or the rose
garden i could show you where
theyre buried

maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down

i figured we ought to have a storm
cellar goon down and check it out
just watch your step

the bodies are buried

to at least check on you
on the seventh day
has god spoken to you yet
there is no god
i lost count of the days
after that it felt like weeks
i finally went beyond fear

tell you about the demons
sorry i ever doubted you
im sorry too son
what did god look like
kind of hard to describe
was he big
adam
let your brother eat in peace
he cant explain something
like that

after a while
when fentons ready
a week later i was ready
my first demon was to be
brad white from dallas
there it is
i see it
youre sure
youre ready for this
yes sir
i bought these for you youll need
them now that god has spoken to you
all right lets go
i want to go too dad
not this time adam you stay
here and keep your eyes peeled
dont worry
your time will come
lets go
sorry to bother you but
yeah
my mom and i we got
a flat on our van
yeah
well i was wondering if you had
a tire iron we went off
and left ours at home
hey pal whats
with the gloves
oh to change the tire
dont want to get your hands dirty
yeah
brad who is it
mind your business
you fucking bitch
goddamn women
yeah i think
i got one for you
out back
great
back here
lets see
here it is
shit
grab his legs
brad white
you know fenton
ive been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started
im ready to fulfill
my destiny
im proud of you son
fuck you
you fuck
get your fucking hands away
get the fuck off
destroy him
dad
dad no no no
no
i buried him
in the rose garden
we went to the sheriffs
office a week later
and told them
that dad just didnt
come home one day
they filed a missing persons
but they didnt find anything
after a while they sent us
to separate orphanages
so
nobody ever knew
about any of this
no
not until now
what about adam
he didnt tell anybody
mind if we just sit here i dont
much feel like talking anymore
tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother
it was later on that night
adam
if you ever destroy me
promise me youll bury me here
i promise to god
ill bury you here
i dont get it
he promised you that
hed bury you here
yeah
if he killed you
no not killed destroyed
dont make any sense
yes it does
if that man standing
in front of you is adam meiks
so you killed all those people
no no i told you before ive
never killed anyone in my life
fenton was the killer
just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth
youll understand soon
just let me show you
where i buried fenton
hold it
you take it real slow
thats it
this is the spot
theres too many graves here
theres only six victims
fenton didnt bury
his victims here
he kept them as trophies
in his basement
this is where i put demons
you thought
your brother was a demon
he was
thats why he couldnt
see the truth
dad knew it too
he just couldnt accept it
you see god asked dad
to destroy his son
much like he asked abraham
to sacrifice his son isaac
but dad couldnt do it
and god didnt take pity
on dad like he did abraham
so he handed down
the duty to me
fenton knew id come thats why
he left those notes to lure me in
i guess he figured when the killings
made the news that id come for him
but i had to wait
till god put him on my list
to come before that
would have been murder
adam
jesus christ you really
do believe all this stuff
ive always believed
thats all lies adam
no its not i see it
when he touches them
youre just crazy as hell
fenton or adam
or whatever your damn name is
i dont really give a fuck
all i need to know right now
is youre a murdering
son of a bitch
and i got you
maybe
but thats not gonna bring
your mother back is it
shes dead
and her killer
got away didnt he
goddamn you
dirty little son of a
how did you know
you were on my list
you didnt think anybody
knew about that did you
god knew
thats why he sent me
im an fbi agent

looking for fenton
youre going to be
his last victim

theyll know it was you
god will protect me
