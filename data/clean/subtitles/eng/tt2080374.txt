i brought along
my son jonathan
who in the year 2001 will
be the same age as i am now
maybe he will be better
adjusted to this kind of world
that youre trying to portray
the big
difference when he grows up
in fact if we wanted to
wait until the year 2001
is that he will have
in his own house
not a computer as big as this
but at least a console
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer
and get all the information he
needs for his everyday life
like his bank statements
his theater reservations
all the information you need
in the course of living
in a complex modern society
this will be in a compact
form in his own house
hell have a television screen
like these here and a keyboard
and hell talk to the computer
and get information from it
and hell take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone
i wonder though
what sort of a life
would it be like
in social terms
if our whole life is built
around the computer
do we become
a computerdependent society
in some ways but they will
also enrich our society
because it will
make it possible for us
to live really
anywhere we like
any businessman and executive could
live almost anywhere on earth
and still do his business
through a device like this
and this is a wonderful thing it means
we wont have to be stuck in cities
well be able to live out in the
country or wherever we please
screen says
its an unimplemented trap
but the error code is wrong
its a system error
so whats the upshot
its not gonna say hello
it absolutely is
gonna say hello
its nobodys fault its a system error
you built the voice demo
the voice demo is flaky
keep your voices down
ive been telling you that for
this thing is overbuilt
it worked last night
it worked the night before that
it worked three hours ago
its not working now so just
skip over the voice demo
fuck you
everything else is working
skip over the voice demo
we need it to say hello
youre not hearing me its
not going to say hello
just fix it
fix it
yeah
in 40 minutes
fix it
i cant
whos the person who can
im the person who can
and i cant
how bad are you saying
its pretty bad
i dont know what that means
it means the demo is more
than likely gonna crash
you have to keep
your voices down
joel pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house
i dont care if
whos joel pforzheimer
gq hes been shadowing you
for a week did you notice
just look like
everythings fine
hes sitting out in the house
hey
what are you guys saying
some kind of race condition but we
havent been able to track it down yet
is the synthesizer
sampling fast enough
no so the rates are
off and it keeps crashing
its 20 seconds out of a
twohour launch why not just cut it
we cant cut it
yeah you just cut it
two days ago
we ran a super bowl ad
that couldve won the oscar
for best short film
there are more people
who can tell you about the ad
than can tell you
who won the game
i understand but the ad said the
mac was gonna save the world
it didnt say it was
gonna say hello
we open the house in five
dont open the house
were taking a quick break
part of the problem is we
can recompile what
but if its a hardware problem
we cant get into the back
why not
do you wanna tell her
or should i
dont start with me man
why cant he get
into the machine
you need special tools
what kind of special tools
just take a screwdriver
he didnt want users
to be able to open it
you need special tools
is this for real
there are 100 engineers walking around
here none of them have the tools
in fairness not many
of them were issued the tools
what about you
i left them at the office
it was 300 am when i
oh jesus christ
cut hello no
whats the first
rule of a launch
its not gonna crash
it just did
andy
which one
the other andy youre right
there why would i be calling out
he needs to talk to you
yeah
the exit signs need to be off
or were not gonna
get a full blackout
weve spoken
to the building manager
and the fire marshal
and
theres absolutely no way theyre
gonna let us turn the exit signs off
ill pay whatever the fine is
the fine is theyre gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave
you explained to
the fire marshal
that were in here
changing the world
i did but unless we can
also change
the properties of fire
he doesnt care
steve
if a fire causes a stampede
to the unmarked exits
itll have been well worth it
for those who survive
for those who dont less so
but still pretty good
look i i need it to go black
real black
get rid of the exit signs and
dont let me know how you did it
fix the voice demo
you need special
tools to open the mac
you knew it was a closed system
i didnt know literally
jesus
and if you keep alienating
people for no reason
theres gonna be no one left
for it to say hello to
its not for no reason
we blow this and ibm will own the
next 50 years like a batman villain
remember the phone company
thats what bell was called
the phone company
ibm will be
the computer company
ten years later theyll be
the information company
and thats very bad
for the human race
so we dont have time
to be polite or realistic
because if we are this
companys next product launch
will be held
in front of 26 people
and a stringer from the alameda
county shoppers guide
we havent advertised
the voice software
we could pull it
out of the demo
and no one would
be disappointed
do you want to try being
reasonable just you know
see what it feels like
okay pull the voice demo
thank you
and then cancel the launch
i see
you just tricked me a little
you can tell me
how unimportant it is
but if the computer
doesnt say hello
then neither will john sculley
who i promise you
agrees with me
sculleys not gonna cancel the
launch because hes not insane
hes also not a hack
and when it comes
to the macintosh
hes gonna do
what i ask him to do
whats in this box
nothing you need to worry
about dont even open it
what the fuck
why is there a carton of
who did this
somebody thought
who
doesnt matter
thought it would be a good idea
to have copies
of that time cover
available at everyones seat
it was nipped in the bud
and all the copies
are being taken
out of the building
so problem solved
this isnt a macintosh
i understand
somebody thought it
would be a good idea
to like enthusiastically
hand over copies of time
with a notamacintosh
on the cover
at the launch of the macintosh
what are they handing out
at hewlettpackard
a bushel of apples
with my face on them
im sure the thinking was
yeah
that since the computer
is man of the year
that thats good
for our business
but like i said im having
them removed from the building
what id like you
to do with them
is to take them
all 2600 copies
and stack them on kottkes desk
and tell him steve says
happy new year to you
okay
i gave time magazine full
access the whole campus
bandley apple ii lisa i
gave him sculley markkula
i gave him woz
i gave him everybody
what should i call
the person who thought
it would be a good idea
to hand these out
im not telling you who it was
it was done without malice
its been taken care of
you have a half hour and we
have things to talk about
like what
like a million
in the first 90 days
joanna 20000
a month after that
look those are the forecasts
im begging you
because this is my field
im begging you to manage
expectations out there
im fanning expectations
were not gonna sell a million
in the first 90 days
everyone everyone everyone
everyone is waiting for the mac
maybe
but what happens when they
find out that for 2495
theres nothing
you can do with it
we were competitive at 1500
but once you replaced the
motorola 6809 with the 68000
which is what
supports menus windows
point and click
highres graphics
yeah because everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners
coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class
i dont have the first fucking
idea what that means
but this is how
it got to 2500
which is the price point on the
pc which can do a lot more
whos gonna want a pc
what idiot is gonna want
if i wanna tell you
theres a spot
on your shirt
i point to the spot
i dont say theres a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button
while i try to remember what
the command is for club soda
thats not how
a persons mind works
if the goal was ease of use maybe
you shouldve given it some memory
you can complain about memory
or you can complain about price
but you cant do both
at the same time
memory is what costs money
and im glad youre telling me
your feelings about the mac now
because we have
a half hour left
we can redesign it
im just asking you
to manage expectations
look at their faces
when they see what it is
they wont know what theyre
looking at or why they like it
but theyll know they want it
not instantly
when people heard
rite of spring
they tore the chairs
out of the theater
they didnt buy the record
rite of spring happens to be
the most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century
ballet
it was a ballet
but igor stravinsky didnt say he was
gonna sell 20000 units a month
i dont know why were
talking about stravinsky
when what i care about
is dan kottke
sodomizing me in time magazine
look obviously
let me say this
obviously daniel didnt think
he was doing anything wrong
by talking to time about it
yeah
i dont know what that means
you said when you told me the story
you said you said to dan
did time magazine ask you if
i had a daughter named lisa
and dan said yeah
my point was that he answered
you simply and honestly
because he didnt think
hed done anything wrong
except joanna except
i dont have
a daughter named lisa
and this story is now about how im
denying paternity and took a blood test
and thats why
theres a picture of
i dont know what
the fuck that is
thats why theres a picture
of a pc on the cover
instead of a picture of me
and the mac
i dont know what to tell you
i was supposed to be time
magazines man of the year
and then dan kottke was born
well
what
shes waiting for you
who
chrisann
brennan
theyre out in the hall
theyve been sitting in the back
of the auditorium
since 700 this morning
im not having a session
with chrisann right now
we issued 335 press
credentials for the launch
steve you piss off chrisann
shes gonna stand in the lobby
and give 335 interviews
and you pal will be longing for
the halcyon days of dan kottke
let me get this over with
but dont leave
youre gonna stay here
what no im not
no theres less of
a chance of a scene
if you stay here
shell be cool
i find all this excruciatingly
personal and
im not staying
come on
i dont wanna be in a room
alone with chrisann
this is me and you
fine
hey
steve
this is a surprise
why dont you come on in
thank you
you coming too
yes im not gonna
leave her in the hallway
okay its a safe hallway
but anyway
you remember joanna hoffman shes
the head of marketing for the mac
good to see you
nice to see you
hello lisa
weve met before and you told
me you like the way i talk
and that was my favorite thing
anyones ever said to me
youre from poland
yes i am do you
know where that is
the top of the earth
i think youre thinking
of the north pole
well were a little
pressed for time so
ill leave you guys alone
why do you wanna leave
when you just said
im gonna check in
with hertzfeld
were trying to get
a computer to say hello
but right now
its being very shy
would you come help me
is that okay
sure
thank you
my dad named
a computer after me
im not your
actually do you know
what a coincidence is lisa
no
like if you met someone
you made a new friend
and her name was lisa too
that would be a coincidence
lisa stands for local
integrated systems architecture
lisa
its a coincidence
you about done
yeah
okay
come
lets make that
computer say hi
go ahead lisa
so it was the other way around
i was named after the computer
nothing was named after anybody
its a coincidence
come on
whats the matter with you
whats the matter with you why
are you telling her these things
why are you still telling
her im her father
a judge told her youre her father
no he didnt
and where the hell
do you get off
telling time magazine ive slept
with 28 of the men in america
thats not
where do you get off
thats not remotely what i said
its right here
first of all can i tell you
something about time magazine
i believe its a training
facility for paid assassins
jobs insists i am quoting
i didnt invent math
28 of the male population of the
united states could be the father
i wasnt saying youve slept
with 28 of american men
i was using an algorithm
based on the blood test
which said there was a 941
chance that im the father
youre trying to publicly paint
me as a slut and a whore
believe me im not trying to
publicly do anything with you
two million people read time
how am i supposed
it would be more if theyd
put me on the cover
but dan kottke decided
to kidneypunch me
i applied for welfare yesterday
im sorry
hello
i said i applied
for welfare yesterday
the time article said your apple
stock was worth 441 million
and i wanted to ask you
how you felt about that
well i feel like apple stock has
been dramatically undervalued
this would be
a good time to get in
your daughter and her mother
chrisann
are on welfare
were living in
a hovel in menlo park
we cant pay the heating bills
she sleeps in a parka
your daughter
shes not my daughter
because as reported
by time magazine
ive slept with 28
of the men in america
no
all of them
exactly nine months
before lisa was born
ive got andy here
excuse me
were there
hey chris
hey andy
how are you doin
terrible
you guys caught up now
excuse me for saying hello to my
friend who thinks youre a dick
i dont think youre a
were there
no its got a oneinsix
chance of working
god damn it
were not a pit crew at daytona
this cant be fixed in seconds
you didnt have seconds
you had three weeks
the universe was created
in a third of that time
well someday youll have to
tell us how you did it
heres what im gonna do
im gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo
im gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up
the bag was designed
by susan kare
the macintosh font thats
scrolling across the screen
was designed by steve capps
the starry night and
skywriting was bruce horn
macpaint macwrite alice
down to the calculator
and then im gonna say the
voice demo that didnt work
was designed by andy hertzfeld
steve
five in six is your chance
of surviving the first round
of russian roulette
and youve reversed those odds
so unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of
your friends family
colleagues stockholders
and the press
i wouldnt stand here arguing
id go try and get some more
bullets out of the gun
do it andy
stop you
what size shirt do you wear me
does anyone know
what size shirt he wears
does anyone know
what size shirt i wear
does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is
the disk fits in your pocket
i need a shirt with a breast
pocket i can take it out onstage
a shirt
the disk
i need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket
yes which one of the no
stores that are open at 845
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes
go out in the lobby find someone my
size whos wearing a white shirt
tell them ill trade them
for a free computer
and they get to keep my shirt
does it have to be a white shirt
is blue okay
no the mac is beige
im beige
the disk is blue
the shirt has to be white
andy
hello im macintosh
bring me the head
of andy hertzfeld
i tried to get it to say
hello but its shy
yeah
so thats it
thats it
i dont get it
i know
what are people
going to do with it
lisa how old are you now
you know how old she is
how old are you lisa
five
come sit here for a minute
do you know what this is
its a computer
can i borrow
your hand for a second
point that arrow and click
you dont have to but if you
want you can play with it
nothing you can do
will break it
so just do
whatever you want with it
what are you doing
im paying you exactly what the
court ordered me to pay you
385 a month
im not the one who
decided on that amount
and im asking you how you feel
if you feel all right
if it feels all right to
you that your daughter
shes not my
that your daughter
and her mother are on welfare
while youre worth 441
million for making that
im proud to say apple donates
computers to underfunded schools
and well be doing more of
the same with the mac
what
apple donates millions of dollars
worth of computers to schools
what does that
have to do with
imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours
were minutes away
from being able to do that
in your head was that
an answer to my question
tell me the question again
i wasnt the one who sued
you for child support
no let
san mateo county sued you
no let me explain
what happened
because i have
plenty of time right now
excuse me
you have a visitor
just wanted to say good luck
hey chrisann
hello woz
hang on
just wanted to say good luck
thanks you too
its a big morning
yeah
you should see
this crowd out there
this crowd its like um
i cant really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor man
yeah so uh listen i
want to ask you a favor yeah
can you acknowledge the apple ii
team in your remarks
i cannot
just an acknowledgment
have them stand up
were launching the mac
itd be a morale booster
just a mention
so they could get
a round of applause
woz
just a mention
can we stick a pin
in this for a minute
sure yep
thank you
just talking about an
acknowledgment for the team
ive got chrisann in there
ill see you in just a second
yep
that
what
you asked me what
people are gonna do with it
theyre gonna do that
one of the engineers
thank you
do you like it
im sorry
its an abstract
you used macpaint
push that key and the s
at the same time
now type your name
do you know
which box says save
right go ahead and click on it
ill put some money
in your account
and buy you a new house
someplace near a decent school
thank you
woz wants a minute
and sculleys asking for you
were done
could you teach me more things
on the computer
lisa wait for me
in the hall please
you can put your coat on
in the hall
bye lisa
bye
lisa in the hall now
i just wanna know when you say
youre gonna put
money in my account
how much were talking about
its a school day
she needs to be in school
im gonna give you
whatever you need
woz wants me to acknowledge
the apple ii team
you must be able to see
that she looks like you
i dont want to insult woz
i just think its backwardlooking
at exactly the wrong moment
i know you heard what i said
i heard what you said joanna
its just were about to
do this thing
at 941 the planets gonna shift
on its axis nigh and forever
two most significant events
of the 20th century
the allies win the war
and this
this
so maybe right now isnt the
very best time to scold me
for not being a better father
to a kid whos not my kid
the test said i i dont
care what the test said
i dont care about 941 or
the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28 of american men
im buying her a new house
im giving her money
theres a small girl who
believes youre her father
thats all  thats all
the math there is
she believes it what are
you gonna do about that
god sent his only son
on a suicide mission
but we like him anyway
because he made trees
were gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days
20000 a month after that
so maybe you could give me
a break ms hoffman
woz
hey
theres nothing in that vending
machine that wont kill you
just browsing
lets take a walk
can i tell you something
yeah after the
meeting in maui
the apple ii team was upset and angry
and down and do you know why
because the apple ii
wasnt mentioned even once
the apple ii wasnt mentioned
yes thats it
you have it yes
that wasnt an oversight
they know that
they know it wasnt
look i dont wanna make
a big deal out of this
thats entirely
within your power
the apple ii is
the apple ii is
what was my friend
the apple ii is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years
and if you
embarrass these people
you are going to see a brain drain
at this company my brother
markkula took you off the lisa
not them and not me
so dont blame
markkula took me off the lisa
because of his strong religious
objection to making it good
now i gave you everything
you wanted on the apple ii
you dont ask for a lot there
wasnt a single fight you lost
do you concede the slots
are the reason
for the success of the apple ii
we cant possibly still be
talking about the slots
i have a point
its been seven years the eight
slots on the apple ii
youre still doing it youre
talking about the slots
theres something
wrong with you
this argument
started in the garage
what are you talking about why
would you only want two slots
a printer and a modem
with eight slots you
this is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots
i appreciate the engineering
but its not what were doing
and thank god i won that argument
woz
because the open system is what
people love about the machine
and its why it sold
and still sells
an open system were not
doing an open system
of course we are
thats what people want and the
breakthrough on the apple ii
people dont know what they want
until you show it to them
serious users want to customize
they wanna modify
they wanna jack it up
they want hardware
engineers like me
to expand its capabilities
okay
keyboards for music
better sound board
better display boards
improved memory cards
and its why there are
3000 people here right now
the slots are what allowed
the apple ii to run
for just one example visicalc
which from my guess
singlehandedly sold between
200000 and 300000 machines
they want slots
they dont get a vote
when dylan wrote
shelter from the storm
he didnt ask people
to contribute to the lyrics
plays dont stop so the
playwright can ask the audience
what scene theyd like
to see next
painters were on the verge of
a tectonic hobbyists are
hobbyists
a printer and a modem
two slots
the apple ii team
has my affection
but im not loving up a 7yearold
product at the mac launch
computers arent paintings
fuck you
im gonna say fuck you
every time you say that
until you either die or stop
steve
try it
steve
say it
computers arent paintings
fuck you
yes they are and what i
want is a closed system
endtoend control
completely incompatible
with anything
computers arent supposed
to have human flaws
im not going to build
this one with yours
steve
hey
today is about the macintosh
and the mac is mine
i give you that
thank you
i give you that
just publicly acknowledge
the apple ii team
because its
the right thing to do
well know soon enough if you are
leonardo da vinci or just think you are
but in the meantime
it would be great
in the meantime
the apple ii is done
seven years
it was a great run
you should go out in the
house and take your seat
the mac is jef raskins
say it for me
computers arent
fuck you
all right
were there
i need more time
you cant have it
twenty minutes
its 858
we can start late
hear me were a computer company
we cant start late
then i have another idea
what
its deceptive and
borderline unethical
im listening
itll run on the 512
you tested it
yeah
wait
youre gonna demo
a 128 computer on a 512
nobodys gonna know
and you think thats
borderline unethical
name my other choices please
please you have to tell me why its
so important for it to say hello
hollywood they made
computers scary things
see how this reminds you
of a friendly face
that the disk slot
is a goofy grin
its warm and its playful
and it needs to say hello
it needs to say hello
because it can
were not committing fraud
the 512 is gonna ship
in under a year
will you absolve me of your
eastern european disapproval
the computer in 2001
said hello all the time
and it still scared
the shit out of me
absolve me
just for this
and just for now
ladies and
gentlemen please welcome
founding board member
mike markkula
all right okay
go make a dent
in the universe steven
see you in a couple of hours
and im going to take us
through the formal part of the meeting
the legal part if you will
thank merciful god
the cavalrys shown up
because i hear youve been
worse than usual this morning
i didnt think
that was possible
so ive been dispatched
as the steve whisperer
this is a 55 margaux
its 900 in the morning
this is a 55 margaux
is it my imagination or have
you started to dress like me
it was a bad idea to have markkula
open with quarterly reports
instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience
just big 10000gallon tanks of cold
water dropped from the ceiling
save mike some money
on index cards
oh just relax
why
i dont know no ones ever
asked me that question
there you go
youre the only one who sees
the world the same way i do
no one sees the world
the same way you do
im like julius caesar john
im surrounded by enemies
no youre not
the board
oh the board
the boards behind you
only because you see
to it they are
oh i think its a good board
but if you want me to
push them out one by one
we can talk about that
i want you to
push them out all at once
through a window
if its the nearest exit
the look on their faces
when we showed them the spot
i couldnt see their faces because they
were banging their heads on the table
yesterday the day after
it airs once
the publisher of adweek calls it
the best commercial of all time
of all time
and it is
and if anyone does one better
its gonna be chiatday who
the board wanted to replace
and its gonna be lee clow who the
board thought was out of his mind
ladies and gentlemen 1984
we have created
for the first time in all history
a garden of pure ideology
where each worker may bloom
secure from the pests
of any contradictory
true thoughts
our unification of thoughts
is more powerful a weapon than
any fleet or army on earth
we are one people
did we use skinheads as extras
a couple of people
have told me that
yeah
we paid skinheads ive got
skinheads on my payroll
they had a look you wanted
the skinheads
yeah
okay lets keep
that to ourselves
we shall prevail
on january 24th
apple computer will
introduce macintosh
who else knows
who else knows what
that we paid terrorists
to be in our tv commercial
john
they were wrong about the ad
but theyre a good board
good people
their only problem their
problem is that theyre people
people
the very nature of people
is something to be overcome
when i was running pepsi
we had a lot of success
focusing on 18to 55yearolds
who werent members
of violent hate groups
i get it youre not
surrounded by enemies
were almost there
im back and forth on the dylan
i might quote a different verse
what are the choices
for the loser now will be later
to win which is what we have
or
come mothers and fathers
throughout the land
and dont criticize
what you cant understand
your sons
and your daughters
are beyond your command
i just lost a hundred bucks
to andy hertzfeld
he said youd change it
to that verse
we got 45 seconds i want to
use it to ask you a question
why do people who are adopted
feel like they were rejected
instead of selected
that came out of nowhere
your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command
your old road
is rapidly aging
so go fuck yourself because
my name is steve jobs
and the times
they are achanging
i dont feel rejected
youre sure
very sure
because its not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say
nah were not interested
in this one
on the other hand
someone did choose you
its having no control
you find out
you were out of the loop
when the most crucial events in
your life were set in motion
as long as you have control
i dont understand people
who give it up
what inspired hertzfeld
to make that bet
he was warning me
that being your father figure
could be dangerous
keep your 100 bucks
im sticking with
the first verse
good
what the hell does he mean
nothing
im proud of you
thank you boss
its my pleasure to
introduce my friend
and the ceo of apple
john sculley
john
yeah
lisa made a painting on the mac
the macintosh apples
nearmythological home computer
has gotten off to a rocky start
in its battle with
industry titan ibm
with sales originally projected
to be 1000000 in
the first quarter
apple has sold only 35000 of
the userfriendly machines
the insistence
by steve jobs that itd have
whats called
endtoend control
which is a way of saying
that its not compatible
with most outside
hardware or software
is the shakespearean flaw in a
machine that had potential
apple computers
closed two of its factories today
in the wake of
disappointing sales
do you know how
many macs were sold last month
in a move that surprised
some but not all on wall street
the board of directors
of apple computers
voted today to fire
its cofounder steve jobs
did he jump or was he pushed
his exboss apple ceo john
sculley refused to comment
however
in an exclusive interview
steve wozniak has slammed the integrity
of his old friend steve jobs
he calls jobs an insulting
and hurtful guy
jobs is hitting back with
a new company and a new computer
apple has a new competitor
steve jobs black cube is aimed
at the education market
few people have the
ability to make the world wait
but that is just what jobs is
doing with his new company next
focus seems kind of sharp
on the slide
the floor the pin spot
i think we want a sharp focus
dont take it personally
just not a fan of
the circus aesthetic
all right lets hold here
were gonna have to go up
and refocus the instruments
just one the 30 is fine
while were holding there are
wellwishers in the vip room
and woz is here
steve wozniak yes
hey thank you very much
and andy hertzfeld
andy hertzfeld
thank you
john sculley is here too
its nice that hes here
really i dont think
its very nice at all
you have to see them
they wanna pay their respects
if they were respectful wed
all still be at apple right now
look
if they really wished me well
theyd keep it to themselves
can i tell you something i dont
think they do wish me well
but im all right with that
im over apple
i got over the mac
and woz and sculley
the same way you get over
your highschool sweetheart
build a new one
can i tell you something
yes
you said you wouldnt
compete with them
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market
which they putatively own
so i think its cool
theyre here
theyre suing me
still
it was nice they came
theyre not being magnanimous
they want it to look
like an amicable divorce
history doesnt remember joe
dimaggio kindly for dumping marilyn
steve
whats your problem
i dont know but im sure
it can be traced back to you
you know im the one who has
to explain you to people
100000 to paul rand
for a corporate logo
when we didnt even know
what our company made
a 650000 mold for the cube
because god forbid the angles be
901 instead of 90
i forbid the angles to
be 901 instead of 90
that box could be on display
at the guggenheim
dont give them reason
to say to the press
you have a chip
on your shoulder
will you do that for me
i dont have a chip
on my shoulder
okay okay
but dont give them
a reason to say you do
i dont
thats the right attitude
thats not an attitude
theyre gonna call me back in a
minute to look at the light
get one out of the way
fine
yeah
yeah
one more thing
sure
no questions from
the press after
no why
until i have better answers
no press avail
if somebody asks where i am you
just saw me and ill be right back
okay
who do you want first
bring me the face
of steve wozniak
hang on
i thought you went to school
hang on
you were supposed to go to school
an hour ago i thought you left
i didnt wake up my mom
on time this morning
its happened before too
i wake up with the alarm and then
i get dressed and eat breakfast
but sometimes i forget to see
what time it is after that
why doesnt your mom just
set her own alarm clock
its one of my chores
i dont understand what that has
to do with why youre still
wheres your mother
she went to find a payphone
an hour ago she said
you dont have to
raise your hand
you said it was off by a little
it is
i just measured it
joanna
exactly a foot
on all four sides
there are six sides but youre
not supposed be here right now
we know if four of the sides
are equal to each other
the other two must be
equal as well
the top bottom right and left
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back
theyre not i measured them
lisa im kind of
an expert in design
and thats a 20cent ruler you think
theres a chance it could be off
if i had another ruler
i would measure this ruler
but i really doubt its off
when your mother comes back
you have to go to school
because its a ruler
why is it off
did you hear what i just said
yes
because sometimes
it seems like you just
keep saying what you want
without listening
im listening
is there something you need
no
why isnt it a perfect cube
youve asked me before
i forget what it is
its an optical anomaly
to the human eye a perfect
cube doesnt look like a cube
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides
whats an anomaly
youve asked me
that before too
i dont know why
you keep doing that
its an exception something
that doesnt fit a pattern
you have to go to school
come in
i think you two have met
hello old friend
you look well
so do you
so do you
and theyre telling me george is
ready for you to look at the focus
take a walk with me
is this lisa
yeah
this cant be lisa
it is
lisas this big they get taller
come on
do you remember me
she doesnt
im your dads friend
steve wozniak
i apologize
i dont remember you
youre very polite
woz
yeah
chrisanns at a payphone
would you find her
yeah
good turnout
great turnout
yeah
insanely great
insanely great
you know this is the first time we
havent played for the same team
its like youre releasing
your first solo album
i appreciate your
inviting me to the launch
i just want to wipe
the slate clean
thats exactly what i want
thats why i came backstage
i want you to know
ill be out there with you
any chance i can get you to
go out there instead of me
i love you steve
i love you too woz
you know some
things were said they were
they were said in public
they were published
were you pressured to do it
was i what
check it out
its the orchestra pit
for the san francisco opera
was i pressured to do it
i once met seiji ozawa
at tanglewood
a thunderous conductor
godly artfulness and nuance
and i asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome cant
surprisingly he
he didnt beat
the living shit out of you
thats right no he said
the musicians play
their instruments
i play the orchestra
that feels like something that sounds
good but doesnt mean anything
markkula sculley they ask you
to slag me off in the press
i had reason to be angry
did they
absolutely not
but they asked you to talk
apple was under siege
youd just left the company
someone had to talk
to the press
im right here woz
the company left me
i begged you
i begged you
the apple ii accounted
for 70 of the revenue
what did you think
was gonna happen
you didnt care enough about
the apple ii or the lisa
lets be really clear
i didnt care at all about
the apple ii or the lisa
i wasnt pressured to do it
what i said to the press
was an honest if tempered
reflection of what i believed
woz
yeah
what the fuck is on your wrist
you wanna know
i literally cant wait
everyones gonna be
wearing these in 10 years
its a nixie watch
made using nixie tubes
this is actually
40yearold technology
coldcathode tubes theyre
operating at 140 volts
i tilt my wrist 45 degrees
its right there
hours minutes and seconds
the way our minds work
look at that
do me a favor
set the watch ahead like youre on a
plane and just changed time zones
not a problem
unscrew that
just hit the button
excuse me flight attendant
the man next to me would appear
to be detonating a bomb
you think this looks
like a bomb
even right now
im not 100 sure it isnt
i think maybe once people
get used to it
no
i was angry
you were saying things
about the apple ii
and the way you were
treating the team
woz
you get a free pass for life
i got to get back onstage
we got like two minutes
of rehearsal time left
do you understand how
condescending that just was
maybe you dont
i dont want to see you
get dragged off
an airplane in
plastic handcuffs
i get a free pass
for life from you
you give out the passes
you give them to me
youre gonna have a stroke
little buddy
what did you do
why has lisa not heard of me
shit man how many
fourthgraders have heard of you
you cant write code
youre not an engineer
youre not a designer
you cant put
a hammer to a nail
i built the circuit board
the graphical
interface was stolen
from xerox parc
jef raskin was the leader
of the mac team
before you threw him off
his own project
everything someone else
designed the box
so how come 10 times in a day i
read steve jobs is a genius
what do you do
i play the orchestra
and youre a good musician
you sit right there youre
the best in your row
i came here to clear the air
do you know why i came here
didnt you just answer that
i came here because
youre gonna get killed
your computers gonna fail
you had a college and
university advisory board
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for 2000 to 3000
youve priced next at 6500
and that doesnt include the
optional 3000 hard drive
which people will discover
isnt optional
because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything
and the 2500 laser printer
brings the total to 12000
and in the entire world
you are the only person who cares
that its housed in a perfect cube
youre gonna get killed
and i came here to stand next
to you while that happens
because thats what friends do
thats what men do
i dont need your pass
we go back so dont talk to
me like im other people
im the only one that knows
that this guy here
is someone you invented
im standing by you because that
perfect cube that does nothing
is about to be
the single biggest failure
in the history of
personal computing
tell me something else
i dont know
back onstage
were out of time theyve got to
mop the stage and open the house
if it crashes
it crashes right
youll make a joke
ill make a joke
if it crashes it crashes
its a good slogan
next if it crashes it crashes
im not just talking
about the demo steve
if it tanks
we dont swallow cyanide
we go back to the drawing board
no more drawing boards
invent the edsel twice you dont
get any more drawing boards
tell me what the plan is
you have to tell me the plan
because i dont know
youre walking around like
youve got cant lose cards
the plan will reveal itself to
you when youre ready to see it
will i have to drop acid
couldnt hurt
is there a plan
have i ever let you down
every single goddamn time
then im due
is there
joanna theres a plan
i just dont wanna put you in a
position where youre lying to people
start 15 minutes late
so avie can recompile
and give us a fighting chance
jesus christ how many times
are we gonna have this
were not starting late ever
fine
were not ever starting late
ever starting late
but where do you come down
on starting late
lisas been doing this thing
where she asks me about stuff
ive already told her
she asks me questions and i know
she already knows the answers
whats that about
kids do that when theyre scared
one of their parents
is in a bad mood
they try to get you talking
about something you like
its very common
and can be treated
by talking to her
about things she likes
do you have any experience
or training in this field
no
tell them to open the house
wheres lisa
shes around
what does that mean
shes running
around the building
an hour ago you said you
were taking her to school
she begged me to let her stay
there are fathers
who would so love
it is wrong okay it is morally
wrong its parentally wrong
it is wrong for you to use lisa as
a way of getting money from me
shell know
if she doesnt already
that that is your
primary use for her
and she will hate you
for the rest of your life
she will see
if she doesnt already
that her mother is a woman who stands
up to men
by living off of them
by not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them
imprisoned
i cant get rid of you
i need a doctor
and i need a dentist
i dropped out of college after a
semester but okay lets have a look
you will support your
daughter and her mother
did you pay someone 1500
to bless your house
did you hear what i said
did you
i dont remember
how much it was steve
it was 1500
they dont do it for free
they dont
they charge 1500
how i spend
fuck you know what
im not even
were you about to say how i spend
my money is none of your business
i have a sinus infection and
i need to see a dentist too
so you can see how your blessing
budget could have been better spent
like on a perfect cube
look at me chrisann
what
you know who i am right
yes
and you know i know people
what are you talking about
look at me
and you know the people i
know they know people
what is this
if i ever hear again
that youve thrown
a cereal bowl at lisas head
what my private
lines gonna ring
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say were all set
thats how ill learn that youre dead
are you
i threw the bowl on the floor
i didnt throw it at her head
she wasnt even in the room
she was nowhere
i threw the bowl on the floor
shes a little girl
youre scaring her
im a grown man
youre scaring me
taking out the garbage
is a chore
clearing the table is a chore
waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy
please teach me more
about being a parent
were all done here
it means so much coming from
someone who wont admit he is one
stop screaming at lisa
i give her responsibilities
got it and one day shes
gonna thank me for it
probably in your sleep
fuck off
okay
i never i never
threw anything at her head
steve
i never would
things dont become so
because you say so
therell be more money in your
account by the end of business
were you being nice
oh yeah
andys next
hertzfeld or cunningham
hertzfeld
hes playing with avie tevanian
on the computer backstage
ladies and gentlemen
the house is now open
playing in front
of thousands of people
steve
can he do it later joel
we go in eight minutes
can i just get a quick reaction
to the press this morning
what about it the size
of it the volume
ill tell you on background
i was hoping for
a quote from steve
ill tell you on background
that ive never seen anything
like it in the tech industry
i called the wall street journal
to take out
a fullpage ad for today
and do you know what
their sales guy said
why bother itd be like notifying
macys that tomorrow is christmas
you saw the stewart alsop
newsletter
i did
im sorry joanna i need to
get steve on the record
the headline was dear next
when can i get my machine
when can he
well announce the ship date
in the next eight to 10 weeks
alsops not talking
about the ship date
he wants to know when he
can get one to play with
we have a lot of
respect for stewart alsop
and we want to get
a machine into his hands
so he can tell
his subscribers about it
when will that be
very soon
a couple of days
a week off the record
off the record
completely
we think
hell get it when its finished
its not finished
its almost finished
ive been watching you rehearse
the demo for three weeks
yeah
whats left
a little thing
what
i think thats
were off the record and joels always
been good at understanding nuance
whats left to finish
i guess in laymans terms youd
have to say we dont have an os
an operating system
yeah
what do you mean
well the os is
what runs the computer
in fact it sort of
is the computer
how has it been running hows
it gonna run this morning
what do you mean
you dont have an os
its like this
avie tevanian is our
chief software designer
and he wrote a demo program
its like we built a great car
but we havent built the engine
so we put a golfcart battery in there
to make it go for a little bit
all this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself
youre telling me the only thing
youve built is a black cube
yes yeah
but isnt it the coolest
black cube youve ever seen
is this
were off the record
is this a strategy or a problem
because if its a problem
do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man
its not a problem
i wouldnt understand it anyway
i dont understand it either
and my names on the patents
its got email
well emails not just
for tech specialists anymore
well it is but it wont be
and i assume an email sent
on a next computer
can only be received
by a next computer
closed endtoend
the new trash can is wrong
i wanna tell you i appreciate
all the hours you put into it
but i cant because
of how terrible it is
go back to the other one
and why are we still giving
three options on the clock
how many options
do you wanna give
two buy it or dont
can i talk to you for a second
absofruitly
uh look man
avies been recompiling
but he says
there may be some
glitches this morning
if all there are
are some glitches
itll be a triumph of
miraculous magnitude
why are you
translating for avie
i didnt want him
to find out the hard way
your position on
glitches in a demo
but it sounds like
youve mellowed
ive been growing andy ive
been learning to love myself
mmm i wouldnt have ever
dreamed that was a problem
fantastic burn
you need to go to your seat
how about lisa getting into
a school for gifted kids
yeah she was tested
and it turns out she can fly
but seriously its a big deal
i know its a big deal  thats why
i built the school a building
well im sure
thats not why she got in
really
can i show you something
funny from macworld
i cant think of anything
i have to do right now
itll make you feel good
joanna look at this
oh andy hes only got
a couple of minutes
its guy kawasaki writing in macworld
youre gonna like this
well can we all enjoy it later
he wrote a parody press release about
apple buying next for your os
he imagines a near future
where apple needs your os
and has to buy next
and you come back as ceo
he has gates saying there would
now be more innovations from jobs
that microsoft could copy
you can read it later
thanks
she wouldve gotten in without
you donating a building
still its something to
talk about in the interview
all right good luck
thanks
give that to me ill
throw it out for you
im gonna hang on to it
what
what
you ready for sculley
excuse me lisa
you cant shout
lisa
you have to go
its dangerous up here thats
why i make other people do it
who are you hiding from
me or your mom
im not hiding
lets go
what were you listening to
im listening to two
versions of the same song
and then when i get to the end
i rewind to listen
to them again
its the same song but the
versions are different
whats the song
okay
so its a really old song and
its called both sides now
both sides now
yeah
whats it about
its about there are three verses
clouds love and life
and the person singing is singing
that they used to think of
that they used to think about
clouds love and life
right one way yeah but now they
look at them another way and they
theyve come to
the conclusion that
they really dont know clouds
love or life at all
those are the exact words
yeah joni mitchell
cause its not a really old song
unless im a really old guy
you have to go to school now
do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions
right now
the first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish
i didnt mean i want to know
the difference right now
i meant you have to
go to school right now
i can stay and watch
you are truant
youre committing a crime
im not gonna miss
anything important
how do you know
i read ahead
the pilgrims make it
to the new world
then the declaration
of independence
yeah you skipped
a couple of centuries
steve
chrisanns out there
lets go
can i make my case for staying
nope
she was with me
come on your dad
doesnt want us to stay
thats not true thats not
you have to be
in school is all
im committing
a crime right now
and i dont
wanna get in trouble
youre not in trouble
i was kidding
okay
hey what was
the second version
you said the first version was girlish
what was the second version
i cant really
think of the word
okay well
have a good day at school
regretful
what
like wishing you could go
back and do things different
youre too young
to be regretful
not me
the person singing the song
got it regretful
that makes sense because
i wanna live with you
six minutes
you want to see sculley
no
you know all those times
i told you you needed security
heres why
i dont know how it is ive
gotten older and you havent
some deal with the devil
i was never offered
so you know what ive been
thinking for the last four years
as it turns out john ive never
known what you were thinking
no newborn baby has control
do you know what
im talking about
in 84 before the mac launch
you said
yeah
you said that being adopted
meant you didnt have control
were starting
in a minute so
why do people think i fired you
its fine john
its all behind us
is it
hmm
dont play stupid
you cant pull it off
you came here to ask me why
people think you fired me
why do people think i fired you
just confirm
something for me okay
you liked the ad
right the commercial
1984 you liked it
when are you
gonna get furniture
its not an easy process
it is you buy a
couch take it from there
id be really surprised
if you came here
to talk about
interior decorating
i liked the ad very much
you did
you know i did
youre a lying son of a
bitch who tried to kill it
its time to take
a hard look at the mac
its past time
its overpriced
we need to drop it to 1995 we
need to double the marketing budget
put more bodies on an internal hard
drive and invest in fileserver
where the hell did you get the
idea that i tried to kill
lee clow
lees wrong
hes lying
hes mistaken
where would the money come from
it would come from finally
getting rid of the apple ii
the apple ii is the
only thing making money
you agreed with the board
i understood the boards
concerns but i
the boards concerns that
we didnt show the product
among other things
but my question was
what other things honestly im
just asking cause im curious
you said among other things
among other things it was
set in a dystopian galaxy
it took place on a planet
where we dont live
it was dark and the
opposite of our brand
and we didnt show the product
people talked about the ad but most of
them didnt know what we were selling
the mac needs
to sell for 1995
there is no market
research telling us
that the mac is failing
because its overpriced
its telling us that
people dont like it
because they think it
doesnt do anything
its closed endtoend
we didnt know it wasnt what
people wanted but it isnt
they want slots they want
choices they want options
the way we buy stereos
mix and match components
john listen to me
whoever said the customer
is always right was
i promise you a customer
it had skinheads in it
she was liberating them
liberating the skinheads
the ad didnt have anything to
do with fucking skinheads
we used them as fucking extras
nobody even knows
they were skinheads
im just saying
the board had concerns
you invented
lifestyle advertising
and our brand was my brand
my job is to make a
recommendation to the board
we showed a lot of happy
people drinking pepsi
we didnt say the world was going
to end if you bought a dr pepper
recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget
i cant
and we showed the product
we showed it being opened
we showed it being poured
being consumed
what are you gonna do recommend
that we kill the mac
i already have steve
what
when
you think the secret to
your success
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda
i didnt kill the ad steve
im the only reason
it made it on the air
just now
an hour ago im coming
from markkulas house
what did he say
what did he say
invent something new
ill give you a team
you can sit in maui
the resorts come with couches
wait a minute are you saying you
recommended terminating the mac
or you recommended taking me
off the mac team
we bought three spots
in the super bowl
two 30s and a 60
and after we screened it the
board wanted that money back
and they asked me to
sell off the spots
chiatday sold off the
two 30s but not the 60
and i let it be known
to lee clow
that if he didnt try very hard
to sell the last spot
i wouldnt be unhappy
if we drop the price
and double the budget
you cant drop the price
or double the budget
i mean the only way to do that is
to take money out of the apple ii
the apple ii should embarrass you
it embarrasses me
it doesnt embarrass
the shareholders
i dont give a shit
about the shareholders
thats why i hired you so i dont
ever have to hear about shareholders
the shareholders are my problem
and the board represents
the shareholders
thats how it works
you sure it wasnt lee clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60
at my direction steve
you think he would have done that
on his own taken it on himself
yeah i think he wouldve done
what it took to save it from you
i was the only thing
protecting it
you didnt want the ad
because you were trying to kill the
mac two months before it launched
you are fucking delusional
can i mention something to you
sure
i have no earthly idea
why youre here
the story of why
and how you left apple
which is quickly becoming
mythologized isnt true
im gonna take this
to the board myself
dont do that
i am doing that
you cant
why
they believe youre no longer
necessary to this company
i get hate mail
death threats
i get death threats
my kids are getting taunted
why do people think i fired you
joannas gonna call
my name in a second
steve
that was unrehearsed
yeah ill be there
in just a second
i gave you your day in court
you gave me i gave the
board a clear choice
i said do you want to invest
in the apple ii or the mac
and they chose the apple ii
the same people who wanted
to dump the super bowl spot
and then i got on
a plane to china
mr sculley theres a call
for you on line 1
or i almost got on a plane because
i got a call in the lounge
who made that call
doesnt matter
it matters to me
who made the call
john sculley
john if you get on that plane
youll have lost your job
by the time it lands
steves been calling the board
he wants you out
i left my bags on the plane
my shits still somewhere
in beijing
i took a car back to cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night
i know what time it is
i need a quorum here in one hour
and i want steve here too
you took me off the
mac and it was bad business
the quorum call was a homicide
right there thats the part
thats bullshit my friend
it was a suicide because
you knew your cards
and i showed you mine
i showed you mine
and you did it anyway
what did you think
i was going to do
im okay losing
but im not gonna forfeit
im not okay losing
were losing market share
and the mac is losing money
our only hope is the apple ii
which is stagnating
because of its
soontobe obsolete dos
users are already rigging their machines
to run with a cpm operating system
thats been built
to run on intel
i cant put it
more simply than this
we need to put our resources
into updating the apple ii
by taking resources
from the mac
its failing
thats a fact
its overpriced theres
no evidence that its
im the evidence
im the worlds leading
expert on the mac john
whats your resume
youre issuing
contradictory instructions
youre insubordinate
you make people miserable
our top engineers are fleeing
to sun dell hp
wall street doesnt know
whos driving the bus
weve lost hundreds
of millions in value
and im the ceo of apple steve
thats my resume
but before that you sold
carbonated sugar water right
i sat in a fucking garage with
wozniak and invented the future
because artists lead and hacks
ask for a show of hands
all right well
this guys out of control
im perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight
but if you want me to stay
you cant have steve
settle him out
he can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter
hell have to sever
his connection to apple
im dead serious i want the
secretary to call for a vote
i fucking dare you
you have done an outstanding
job over the years
of cultivating the press and by
that i mean manipulating them
because none of them
none of their editors
none of their editors
publishers to this day
know that you forced it
that you forced the board
even after i told you
exactly what theyd do
which is exactly what they did
unanimously
i dont have any trouble
remembering that john
because of it being
the worst night of my life
and i forced the vote because
i believed i was right
i still believe im right
and im right
now i bled that night
and i dont bleed
but times done its thing
and i really havent thought
about it in a while
i absolutely understand
why youre upset
and i want people
to know the truth too
its time
got it
youre gonna end me arent you
youre being ridiculous
im gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself
then im gonna order a nice
meal with a 55 margaux
and sign some autographs
jesus christ
you want some advice
pepsi generation
dont send woz out to slap me
around in the press
anybody else
you markkula arthur rock
anyone but rain man
dont manipulate him like that
whatever you may think
im always gonna protect him
come on steve
thats what men do
we cant start late
i dont think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder
did you know back at bandley
the mac team gave
an award every year
to the person who could
stand up to you
no
i won
three years in a row
cool
this this
this guy kawasaki in macworld
he accidentally
got it right didnt he
youve been dragging
your feet on the next os
until you can figure out
what apples going to need
even if that were true it doesnt
sound that diabolical to me
hey were ready for you
im your closest confidante
your best friend
your thing
what do you call it
your work wife
the whole time
the last three years
when did you change your mind
and start building the steve
jobs revenge machine
house to half
do you remember skylab
it was an unmanned satellite
nasa sent up in the early 70s
on a datagathering mission
the thing is
when they sent it up
they didnt know yet how they
were going to get it back
but they felt like
they were close enough
that in the eight years it was going
to be up there theyd figure it out
theyre on their way now
they didnt
so after eight years
it came crashing down in a 1000mile
swath across the indian ocean
a little to the left
a little to the right
somebody could have gotten hurt
i really wanted to build
a computer for colleges
the technology just didnt catch
up as fast as i needed it to
and you know were out of money
ladies and gentlemen the
program will be starting momentarily
but then apple stopped
innovating and i saw something better
joanna i know schools
arent going to buy
a 13000 dictionary
with good speakers
you know i know that
but apple will
because avie tevanian is going to
build them exactly the os they need
theyre going to
have to buy me too
for half a billion
dollars in stock
and endtoend control
on every product
ladies and gentlemen
please welcome
more than a
year after it was first unveiled
to industry insiders
the next computer is finally
available in stores
and it appears to be two
strikes in a row for steve jobs
students and educators
are finding it difficult
to justify
the machines high cost
so much for the black cube
next just sold
its factory to canon
and laid off half its employees
in the world of computers
its kill or be killed
apple computer has
fallen on hard times
it is laying off
about 2500 people
apple is
continuing to lose market share
with no new innovations
in the pipeline
except the newton a pet
project of ceo john sculley
if you really want to
be mobile you want a newton pda
but then again
maybe you dont
it turns handwriting
into computer text
hey dolph take a memo on your newton
beat up martin
in 1980 apple
had 30 of the market
today apple has only 32
thats it john sculley

and what
about this internet thing
do you know anything about that
uh it is the big new thing

andy come on back a minute
which one
hertzfeld
forbes calls it
an industryaltering success
look here
why havent we ever
slept together
were not in love look
sculley
look what he said
he has implemented
the same simple strategy
that made apple so
successful 15 years ago
make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing
that was nice of him
it was
i meant it
sightings of jd salinger are
more common than john sculley
i wasnt being sarcastic
it was nice of him
do you talk to him
no
you havent talked
to him since 88
id have told you if i did
doesnt matter
i dont want people thinking
they can cross me
and then boom 15 years
later im cool with it
i was kidding
whats wrong with you
this morning
lets get off the stage
the only thing apples providing
now is leadership in colors
dont worry about it
what does bill gates
have against me
i dont know youre both
out of your minds
listen to me
he dropped out of a better
school than i dropped out of
but hes a tool bag
ill tell you why
make everything
all right with lisa
you know joanna
boundaries
youve come to my apartment at 100 am
and cleaned it
so tell me where
the boundary is
there lets say its there
if i give you some
real projections
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage
what do you mean
real projections
what have you been giving me
conservative projections
marketings been lying to me
weve been managing expectations
so that you dont not
what are the real projections
were going to sell a million
units in the first 90 days
20000 a month after that
holy shit
yeah
you see you wait
long enough and
whats more 32 of the sales
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time
and 12 are going to people using
some kind of windows machine
thats what bill gates
has against you
and itll be the fastestselling
computer in history
you brought the company
back from life support
after going through the misery
of laying off 3000 people
and cutting 70 of
the product line
so steven
its over
youre going to win
it would be criminal
not to enjoy this moment
im enjoying it
make things all right with lisa
you know
come on
i dont like having less privacy
than other people have
does being a multibillionaire
take some of the sting off that
no
all lisa did all lisa
did was give her blessing
chrisann sold the house and
and lisa could have done what
how was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house
that i bought
for the two of them
how was she supposed
to stop her
voicing an objection would have been
a step in the right direction
you dont think youre having
a bizarre overreaction
to a 19yearold girl allowing her
mother to list her own house
she couldve tried
how is she supposed to stop her
mother that particular mother
she gave chrisann her
blessing to sell the house
and she did it to spite me
i dont care if she put a pipe
bomb in the water heater
youre going to fix it now
shes been acting weird for months
shes turned on me
fix it
what the
fix it steve
take it easy
fix it or i quit
how about that
i quit and you never see me again
how about that
tell me whats wrong
with you this morning
whats been wrong
with me for 19 years
ive been a witness and i
tell you ive been complicit
i love you steve
you know how much
i love that you dont care how
much money a person makes
you care what they make
but what you make isnt supposed
to be the best part of you
when youre a father
thats whats supposed to be
the best part of you
and its caused me two decades of
agony steve that it is for you
the worst
its a little thing
its a very small thing
fix it
fix it now or you can
contact me at my new job
working anywhere i want
i dont happen to think
it is a little deal
she knew that
no
i bought the house for the two of
no
what do you mean no
i mean no
the house has nothing to do
with why youre angry at lisa
i assure you
the house has everything
to do with why
im angry at lisa
have you ever heard the phrase
reality distortion field
yes
as in steves
reality distortion field
ive heard it
ive read it
its been sung
to me by joan baez
what you call
a reality distortion field
and im pretty sure youre the
one who coined the phrase
is the reason were here
i know that
if i traded in my
bank account for a dollar
every time somebody told me
something was impossible
id come out ahead
i know that too
whats the problem
my problem
it sure isnt the house
jo i
its that you told her you werent
going to pay for harvard
that child that
earnest unironic kid
she told you i wasnt
paying her tuition
i should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago
lisa told you i wasnt
paying her tuition
andy told me that
which one
hertzfeld
how would hertzfeld know
he wrote harvard a check for
25000 to cover the semester
are you fucking
he paid her tuition
isnt that why you
just asked to see him
no i asked to see him
about something
did you tell her you werent
going to pay for college
yes because
how could you do that
because her mother
who is also her landlord
hertzfeld i was ranting
i was just talking
you think i would
i was pissed off because lisa was
trying to piss me off joanna
that was her intent
you obviously scared
the hell out of her
hertzfeld wrote a check to harvard
pay for
is she here yet
im sure she is
can you have someone
bring her back
yes
thank you
you know
my grandmother always
used to say to me
i dont give a shit yentl
ill have someone get lisa
thank you
and if you see hertzfeld
its andy
speak of
the devils chief engineer
go come on in
you look great today
thank you
doesnt she
she looks fantastic
always does
get out
well i think i know
why im here
do you
steve
did you send the check yet
yes
so harvard got a tuition check from
andy hertzfeld to pay for lisa
i dont think
they look that carefully
i dont think theyd notice the
check didnt come from you
close one
this was almost
embarrassing for me
i understand how ill
wire you the money today
i understand how you feel
and i do apologize i do
but let me tell you
my thinking
i cant even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did
i knew you guys would fix things
you always do
but in the meantime
if the money wasnt there
shed miss a semester of school
yeah
and shed have to
tell her friends why
and she needed things
she needed socks
what
its cold in cambridge
she needed warm socks
you gave her socks
well i gave her money
for socks
you dont get to deputize
yourself as her interim
you dont get to override my decisions
do you understand
you dont get to act
like youre her father
somebody had to
what the fuck did you
just say to me
ive known her
since she was six
i also consider
chrisanns my friend
outside of what you and i
outside of our relationship
so youre like a family advisor
im a family friend
then you probably know that
lisas been seeing a therapist
yeah
for many years
yeah
without my knowledge
that really wasnt my business
im fascinated by what you
think is and isnt your business
lisas been going to a
therapist and she likes it
and would love for you and
chrisann to go with her
and the reason
you know that is because
youre the one that
recommended the therapist
well i know a guy
no i mean youre the one who
recommended that she see a therapist
you know what
it was a while ago and i dont
remember how the whole
you told chrisann that lisa
should see a therapist
steve youre stigmatizing
its a perfectly norm
its not my thing was
how can it hurt
lets find out
chrisann is my friend
what was the reason you gave
you mean
what was the reason you gave chrisann
why lisa should see a therapist
i dont remember we were
talking and i said
its pretty much
what i just said
that it certainly couldnt hurt
you didnt say that lisa needed
a strong male role model
i did
i think its a miracle
shes not robbing banks
with the symbionese
liberation army
there is no reason in the
world why she should be nice
but she is
so i helped
because somebody had to
ill wire the money
to you this afternoon
you threatened me
a long time ago
sorry
a long time ago
you threatened me once
people are attracted
to people with talent
people without it
find that threatening
maybe you should see a therapist
certainly couldnt hurt
i meant you literally
threatened me
at flint
right before the mac launch
i was recompiling  i was
trying to debug the voice demo
and you said if i couldnt
find a solution
youd call me out
in front of the audience
did it say hello
it did
no need to thank me
why do you want people
to dislike you
i dont want people
to dislike me
im indifferent to whether
they dislike me
since it doesnt matter
i always have
really
ive always liked you a lot
thats too bad
knock em dead
thank you
what is remarkable whats
hard to fathom but true
is that for a given
clock rate a powerpc chip
is twice as fast
as a pentium ii chip
in other words
a 266 megahertz g3 chip
is twice as fast
as a 266 megahertz pentium ii
or
a 266 g3 is equal to
about 500 megahertz
take a look at byte magazines byte
marks the gold standard for any
come in
i sent someone into the lobby
they found her and she
where is she
she said shed rather
not come back
why
that was it
im going out there myself
you cant
you cant itll be a scene
out of hard days night
excuse me
hey joel
andy said it was okay
to come back
which one
andy cunningham
i cant do this forever
i need one of them
to change their name
you call
andy cunningham andrea
it doesnt matter
what i call them
i know who im talking about
when im talking
i need everyone else to
call them different names
give me one second
can you go get her
for me please
i just talked to andy hertzfeld
im just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with drano
but i do want to talk to lisa
okay just
stay cool
okay
thank you
hey steve
how are you feeling
im feeling good joel
how about you
i dont think i could be in your business
it changes too quickly
well id hang on
cause yours is about to
start changing
pretty quickly too
this is the third time in 14
years im writing about you
what do you think so far
excuse me
uh avies looking for you
he has a new shark
want to come backstage
for a second
sure
whos this one
alan turing
singlehandedly won
world war ii and
for an encore
invented the computer
he wont be part of
the campaign though
why not
because you just had
to ask me who he was
can i see new shark
i like it better than the old shark
sharks
sharks
how many sharks
did you go through
a couple
this is the 39th
were on the record
thirtynine sharks
okay
you know whats special
about this shark what
no im really asking
because it looks exactly
like the other 38 sharks to me
let me see it with the cue
from the profile
this is cue 92b
this is a profile here
and this is what
it looks like from the back
and one more thing  it eats pentium
notebooks as a light snack
this is the shark
i really like it
nobody gets it right
the first time
but i should have been shown
this shark 15 20 fish ago
you probably were
lock it in
10 minutes
he killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple alan turing
yeah there should be
statues of that man
his name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren
the rainbow flag apple
with a bite taken out
thats where it came from
no we picked it off a list
of friendlysounding words
but wouldnt it be great if that
had been the story behind it
steve
kinda liked the last shark
fuck you
i wanted to ask you a favor
my friend a long time ago
you asked me a favor before a
product launch and i said no
you wanted me to acknowledge
hang on
if youre about to say
you were wrong
i want to prepare
this journalist
i was 100 right
and you were
spectacularly wrong
but i still owe you a
favor so name it
steve
but it cant be about acknowledging
the apple ii team
acknowledge the apple ii team
how about in private
no no
is this a prank
because im trying to remember
that a 300 megahertz g3 chip
just the top guys
steve
excuse me okay
yep
one second
she said shed rather not
what do you mean
shes sitting with her friends
and she said shed
rather not come back
okay tell her
take her aside i dont want to
embarrass her
in front of her friends
but tell her i just scared
the shit out of andy
and this time nobodys
paying her fucking
all right
dont say that
but do your thing where
you sound old and wise
because of the broad tragic
european canvas of your life
you know i wasnt born in a
19th century shtetl right
please tell her its important
everything all right
yeah
there are people
around here man
including a member of the press
i see him
woz
just the top guys the ones
who are getting laid off
listen okay last year apple
lost one billion dollars
i dont even know
how thats possible
you were less than 90 days
from being insolvent
i had three different accountants
try to explain it to me
the whole place has
to be streamlined
start with two of the accountants
i started with the
joel could you come offstage
were going to go backstage
leave him right there
i started with the apple ii team
because we dont make that anymore
just acknowledge the top guys
have a mimosa and relax
you will not blow me off
right now steve
the top guys
there are no top guys
all right
on the apple ii team
there are no top guys
theyre b players
and b players discourage
the a players
and i want a players
at apple and not dell
theyre not b players and
im a better judge of that
less than 90 days
from insolvency
in part because somebody thought
the newton wasnt a box of garbage
joel could you come off stage please
leave him
im talking about
you guys designed and shipped a little
box of garbage while i was gone
im talking about the apple ii
which is not just a crucial
part of this companys history
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing
for a time
the least you can do if youre
going to downsize these people
theyre going to live in the
biggest houses of anyone
on the unemployment line
is to acknowledge them
acknowledge them and the
apple ii during this launch
this is a new animal
this whole place
was built by the apple ii
you were built by the apple ii
as a matter of fact
i was destroyed
by the apple ii
and its open system
so that hackers and hobbyists could
build ham radios or something
and then
it nearly destroyed apple
when you spent
all your money on it
and developed a grand total
of no new products
the newton
the little box of garbage
you guys came up
with the newton
you like
want people to know that
this is a product launch
not a luncheon
and the last thing i want to
do is connect the imac to
to the only successful product
that this company has ever made
im sorry to be blunt but
that happens to be the truth
the lisa was a failure
the macintosh was a failure
i dont like talking like this
but i am tired of being ringo
when i know i was john
everybody loves ringo
and im tired of
being patronized by you
you think john became john
by winning a raffle woz
you think he tricked somebody
or hit george harrison
over the head
he was john because he was john
he was john because he
wrote ticket to ride
and i wrote the apple ii
everybody
i want to clear the auditorium
nobody moves
you made a beautiful board
which by the way
you were willing to
give out for free
so dont tell me
how you built apple
if it werent for me youd be the
easiest a at homestead high school
these people live and die by your
praise so heres your chance
acknowledge that
something good happened
that you werent
in the room for
no
steve
do it
its right its
its right
sorry but no
then let me put it another way
i dont think theres a man
whos done more
to advance the
democratization that comes
with personal computing
than i have
but youve never had any respect for me
now why is that
id at least consider
the possibility
that its because youve
never had any for me
what the hell is going on here
nothing
thank you for your time
its done
shes coming back
you came a halfinch from putting
this company out of business
now who do i see about that
im letting you keep your job
you get a pass
you know
when people used to ask me
what the difference was
between me and steve jobs
i would say steve
was the bigpicture guy
and i liked a solid workbench
when people ask me what the
difference is now i say
steves an asshole
your products are better
than you are brother
thats the idea brother
and knowing that
thats the difference
its not binary
you can be decent and gifted
at the same time
he didnt mean it
yeah he did
hes a temperamental guy
no hes not
its like five minutes
before every launch
everyone goes to a bar
gets drunk
and tells me
what they really think
shes coming
to your dressing room
i told you to make
things all right with lisa
i didnt say you had to settle
every blood feud you have
the last time blood feuds werent
settled i lost the cover of time
though for the life of me
i still dont know
what the hell dan kottke
was mad at me about
kottke didnt lose you
the cover of time
of course he did
would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong
when youre certain
youre right
dan kottke told time magazine
that i was denying
do you remember the cover
of time
yes
yes
what was it
what are you talking about
what was on the cover
a computer
no it was a sculpture
of a computer
it was a sculpture
time would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance
you were never in the
conversation for man of the year
nobody lost you anything
so what else
are you sure about
i dont know how
i couldve missed that
reality distortion
no seriously
seriously
dont try to win
an argument with lisa
just say you were wrong
come on in honey
its not honey
john get in get in
get out of the hall
i was taken in the side entrance
ill go out the same way
no one will see me
how are you joanna
im good john im
just surprised to see you
everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to forbes
you didnt have to do that
my pleasure
if you want i can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out
im just here
to say good luck okay
you just have
a couple of minutes
would you try to find
yeah
youre a good man john
so i brought you a present
the newton
if you dont take it out of the
box youll be able to sell it
which is more than i can say
everything all right there
what no
yeah
just something
joanna pointed out to me
i missed something
so obvious about
it doesnt matter
look wall streets gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as ceo
so dont let any fluctuation bother
you for the first 12 months
day traders are gonna respond
i dont need to school you
is this your way of telling me i
shouldnt have killed the newton
the most efficient animal on
the planet is the condor
the most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans
well you shouldnt
have killed it for spite
thats bad business
dont do that
but a human with a bicycle becomes
the most efficient animal
and the right computer
a friendly easy computer
that isnt an eyesore
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a tensor lamp
the right computer will be
a bicycle for the mind
do you like it
i was given back
and what if instead of it
being in the right hands
it was in everyones hands
everyone in the world
wed be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since
ever
i dont know why youve always been
interested in my adoption history
but you said its not like someone
looked at me and gave me back
but that is what happened
youre telling me
you have the right computer
its called macintosh
a lawyer couple
adopted me first
then gave me back after a month
they changed their mind
then my parents adopted me
my biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me
had to be collegeeducated
wealthy and catholic
paul and clara jobs
were none of those things
so my biological mother wouldnt
sign the adoption papers
what happened
there was a legal battle
that went on for a while
my mother said she refused to
love me for the first year
you know in case
they had to give me back
you cant refuse to
love someone steve
yeah it turns out you can
what the hell can
a onemonthold do
thats so bad that his
parents give him back
theres nothing
a onemonthold can do
have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father
ive met my biological father
for that matter so have you
its called macintosh

a reason to sue me

you cant use the other five
that are attached to your wrist
things we could have
done together
god the things
we couldve done
im paying your tuition
are you crazy of course
im paying your tuition
i must have misunderstood you when you
said you werent paying my tuition
you and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do
she needed the money
she always needs the money
she needs a doctor
she has a sinus infection
shes had the same
sinus infection since 1988
im gonna take care of my mother
im sorry if that angers you
it does anger me
because youre a kid
and its not your job
to take care of your mother
is that how yours died
guys um step away please
give them some room
when your mom is 90 and cant feed
herself you can take care of her
but right now shes 45 perfectly
healthy and cant feed herself
youre supposed to work hard at
school and be 19 and thats it
ill take care of your mother
well keep up the good work
what the hell do you want from me
i was sent for
i bought her
a house for 400000
its worth twice
that much today
she sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup
it was her house
she used that money
to travel through europe
money which you
make her beg for
steve
dont even start with that
going to andy
and asking for the money
that was so offthecharts
over the line
i did not do that
andy came to me
everybody have an opinion
on this
im sorry guys in 30 seconds
youre going to be late
she spends
the money on antiques
and then sells them for
a fraction of what she paid
and she does it with money
i gave to her for you
steve
you came to me hysterical
when you were 13
asking if you could
live with me
i was not hysterical
because your mom was
screaming at you every day
and 13 was the second
time i asked you
the stress of her life
as a spiritual healer
i dont believe i said youre a bad guy
but if i did i am sorry
something happened
to you at school
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take
i read time
what
i have internet access
at school
i read an old copy of time
and i asked my mom some questions
about my family history
that was time wrote
a mangled piece of journal
you were never
supposed to read that
i had two different
harvard statisticians
try to reverseengineer
the equation
that you came up with
to prove that 28
of american men
could be my father
honey i
you know my mother might
be a troubled woman
but whats your excuse
thats why im not impressed
with your story dad
its that you knew
what i was going through
and you didnt do
anything about it
and that makes you
an unconscionable coward
and not for nothing but
think is a verb all right
making different an adverb
youre asking people
to think differently
and you can talk about the
bauhaus movement and braun
and simplicity is sophistication
and issey miyake uniforms
and bob dylan lyrics all
you want but that thing
looks like judy jetsons
easybake oven
hey
oh gee
youre gonna start late

what
the computer the lisa do
you know what it stood for

its not what i really think
behind my back at the office
you know what it stood for
local integrated
system architecture
