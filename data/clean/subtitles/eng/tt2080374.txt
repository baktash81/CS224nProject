i brought along
my son  jonathan 
who  in the year 2001  will
be the same age as i am now 
maybe he will be better
adjusted to this kind of world
that you re trying to portray 
the big
difference  when he grows up   
in fact  if we wanted to
wait until the year 2001 
is that he will have 
in his own house 
not a computer as big as this 
but at least a console
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer
and get all the information he
needs for his everyday life 
like his bank statements 
his theater reservations 
all the information you need
in the course of living
in a complex modern society 
this will be in a compact
form in his own house 
he ll have a television screen 
like these here  and a keyboard 
and he ll talk to the computer 
and get information from it 
and he ll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone 
i wonder  though 
what sort of a life
would it be like 
in social terms 
if our whole life is built
around the computer 
do we become
a computer dependent society 
in some ways  but they will
also enrich our society
because it will
make it possible for us
to live  really 
anywhere we like 
any businessman and executive could
live almost anywhere on earth
and still do his business
through a device like this 
and this is a wonderful thing  it means
we won t have to be stuck in cities 
we ll be able to live out in the
country  or wherever we please 
screen says
it s an unimplemented trap 
but the error code is wrong 
it s a system error 
  so what s the upshot 
  it s not gonna say   hello  
it absolutely is
gonna say  hello  
it s nobody s fault  it s a system error 
you built the voice demo 
  the voice demo is flaky   
  keep your voices down 
i ve been telling you that for   
this thing is overbuilt 
it worked last night 
it worked the night before that 
it worked three hours ago 
it s not working now  so just
skip over the voice demo 
  fuck you 
  everything else is working 
skip over the voice demo 
we need it to say   hello  
you re not hearing me  it s
not going to say   hello  
just fix it 
  fix it 
  yeah 
  in 40 minutes 
  fix it 
  i can t 
  who s the person who can 
i m the person who can 
and i can t 
  how bad are you saying 
  it s pretty bad 
i don t know what that means 
it means the demo is more
than likely gonna crash 
you have to keep
your voices down 
joel pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house 
i don t care if   
who s joel pforzheimer 
gq  he s been shadowing you
for a week  did you notice 
just look like
everything s fine 
he s sitting out in the house 
hey 
what are you guys saying 
some kind of race condition  but we
haven t been able to track it down yet 
is the synthesizer
sampling fast enough 
no  so the rates are
off  and it keeps crashing 
it s 20 seconds out of a
two hour launch  why not just cut it 
  we can t cut it 
  yeah  you just cut it 
two days ago 
we ran a super bowl ad
that could ve won the oscar
for best short film 
there are more people
who can tell you about the ad
than can tell you
who won the game 
i understand  but the ad said the
mac was gonna save the world 
it didn t say it was
gonna say   hello  
we open the house in five 
don t open the house 
we re taking a quick break 
part of the problem is  we
can recompile    what 
   but if it s a hardware problem
  we can t get into the back 
why not 
do you wanna tell her 
or should i 
don t start with me  man 
why can t he get
into the machine 
you need special tools 
what kind of special tools 
just take a screwdriver 
he didn t want users
to be able to open it 
you need special tools 
is this for real 
there are 100 engineers walking around
here  none of them have the tools 
in fairness  not many
of them were issued the tools 
what about you 
i left them at the office 
it was 3 00 a m  when i   
oh  jesus christ 
cut  hello   no 
what s the first
rule of a launch 
it s not gonna crash 
it just did 
andy 
which one 
the other andy  you re right
there  why would i be calling out 
he needs to talk to you 
yeah 
the exit signs need to be off 
or we re not gonna
get a full blackout 
we ve spoken
to the building manager
  and the fire marshal 
  and 
there s absolutely no way they re
gonna let us turn the exit signs off 
i ll pay whatever the fine is 
the fine is  they re gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave 
you explained to
the fire marshal
that we re in here
changing the world 
i did  but unless we can
also change
the properties of fire 
he doesn t care 
steve   
if a fire causes a stampede
to the unmarked exits 
it ll have been well worth it
for those who survive 
for those who don t  less so 
but still pretty good 
look  i    i need it to go black 
real black 
get rid of the exit signs and
don t let me know how you did it 
fix the voice demo 
you need special
tools to open the mac 
you knew it was a closed system 
  i didn t know literally 
  jesus 
and if you keep alienating
people for no reason 
there s gonna be no one left
for it to say  hello  to 
it s not for no reason 
we blow this  and ibm will own the
next 50 years like a batman villain 
remember the phone company 
that s what bell was called 
 the phone company  
ibm will be
the computer company 
ten years later  they ll be
the information company 
and that s very bad
for the human race 
so we don t have time
to be polite or realistic 
because if we are  this
company s next product launch
will be held
in front of 26 people
and a stringer from the alameda
county shoppers  guide 
we haven t advertised
the voice software 
we could pull it
out of the demo 
and no one would
be disappointed 
do you want to try being
reasonable  just  you know 
see what it feels like 
okay  pull the voice demo 
thank you 
and then cancel the launch 
i see 
you just tricked me a little 
you can tell me
how unimportant it is 
but if the computer
doesn t say   hello  
then neither will john sculley 
who  i promise you 
agrees with me 
sculley s not gonna cancel the
launch because he s not insane 
he s also not a hack 
and when it comes
to the macintosh 
he s gonna do
what i ask him to do 
what s in this box 
nothing you need to worry
about  don t even open it 
what the fuck 
why is there a carton of   
who did this 
  somebody thought   
  who 
doesn t matter 
thought it would be a good idea
to have copies
of that time cover
available at everyone s seat 
it was nipped in the bud 
and all the copies
are being taken
out of the building 
so  problem solved 
this isn t a macintosh 
i understand 
somebody thought it
would be a good idea
to  like  enthusiastically
hand over copies of time
with a not a macintosh
on the cover
at the launch of the macintosh 
what are they handing out
at hewlett packard 
a bushel of apples
with my face on them 
  i m sure the thinking was   
  yeah 
   that since the computer
is man of the year
that that s good
for our business 
but like i said  i m having
them removed from the building 
what i d like you
to do with them
is to take them 
all 2 600 copies 
and stack them on kottke s desk 
and tell him steve says 
 happy new year to you   
okay 
i gave time magazine full
access  the whole campus 
bandley  apple ii  lisa  i
gave him sculley  markkula 
i gave him woz 
i gave him everybody 
what should i call
the person who thought
it would be a good idea
to hand these out 
i m not telling you who it was 
it was done without malice 
it s been taken care of 
you have a half hour  and we
have things to talk about 
like what 
like a million
in the first 90 days 
joanna    20 000
a month after that 
look  those are the forecasts 
i m begging you 
because this is my field 
i m begging you to manage
expectations out there 
i m fanning expectations 
we re not gonna sell a million
in the first 90 days 
everyone  everyone  everyone 
everyone is waiting for the mac 
maybe 
but what happens when they
find out that for  2 495 
there s nothing
you can do with it 
we were competitive at  1 500 
but once you replaced the
motorola 6809 with the 68000   
which is what
supports menus  windows 
point and click 
high res graphics   
yeah  because everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners 
coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class 
i don t have the first fucking
idea what that means 
but this is how
it got to  2 500 
which is the price point on the
pc  which can do a lot more 
who s gonna want a pc 
what idiot is gonna want   
if i wanna tell you
there s a spot
on your shirt 
i point to the spot 
i don t say there s a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button 
while i try to remember what
the command is for club soda 
that s not how
a person s mind works 
if the goal was ease of use  maybe
you should ve given it some memory 
you can complain about memory 
or you can complain about price 
but you can t do both
at the same time 
memory is what costs money 
and i m glad you re telling me
your feelings about the mac now
because we have
a half hour left 
we can redesign it 
i m just asking you
to manage expectations 
look at their faces
when they see what it is 
they won t know what they re
looking at or why they like it 
but they ll know they want it 
not instantly 
when people heard
rite of spring 
they tore the chairs
out of the theater 
they didn t buy the record 
rite of spring happens to be
the most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century 
  ballet 
  it was a ballet 
but igor stravinsky didn t say he was
gonna sell 20 000 units a month 
i don t know why we re
talking about stravinsky 
when what i care about
is dan kottke
sodomizing me in time magazine 
look  obviously   
let me say this 
obviously  daniel didn t think
he was doing anything wrong 
by talking to time about it 
yeah 
i don t know what that means 
you said  when you told me the story 
    you said  you said to dan 
 did time magazine ask you if
i had a daughter named lisa  
and dan said   yeah  
my point was that he answered
you simply and honestly
because he didn t think
he d done anything wrong 
except  joanna  except 
i don t have
a daughter named lisa 
and this story is now about how i m
denying paternity and took a blood test 
and that s why
there s a picture of   
i don t know what
the fuck that is 
that s why there s a picture
of a pc on the cover
instead of a picture of me
and the mac 
i don t know what to tell you 
i was supposed to be time
magazine s man of the year 
and then dan kottke was born 
well   
what 
she s waiting for you 
who 
chrisann 
brennan 
they re out in the hall 
they ve been sitting in the back
of the auditorium
since 7 00 this morning 
i m not having a session
with chrisann right now 
we issued 335 press
credentials for the launch 
steve  you piss off chrisann 
she s gonna stand in the lobby
and give 335 interviews 
and you  pal  will be longing for
the halcyon days of dan kottke 
let me get this over with 
but don t leave 
you re gonna stay here 
what  no  i m not 
no  there s less of
a chance of a scene
if you stay here 
she ll be cool 
i find all this excruciatingly
personal and   
i m not staying 
come on 
i don t wanna be in a room
alone with chrisann 
this is me and you 
fine 
hey 
steve 
this is a surprise 
why don t you come on in 
thank you 
you coming too 
yes  i m not gonna
leave her in the hallway 
okay  it s a safe hallway 
but anyway 
you remember joanna hoffman  she s
the head of marketing for the mac 
good to see you 
nice to see you 
hello  lisa 
we ve met before  and you told
me you like the way i talk 
and that was my favorite thing
anyone s ever said to me 
you re from poland 
yes  i am  do you
know where that is 
the top of the earth 
i think you re thinking
of the north pole 
well  we re a little
pressed for time  so   
i ll leave you guys alone 
why do you wanna leave
when you just said   
i m gonna check in
with hertzfeld 
we re trying to get
a computer to say  hello  
but right now
it s being very shy 
would you come help me 
is that okay 
sure 
thank you 
my dad named
a computer after me 
i m not your   
actually  do you know
what a coincidence is  lisa 
no 
like if you met someone 
you made a new friend
and her name was lisa  too 
that would be a coincidence 
 lisa  stands for  local
integrated systems architecture  
l i s a 
it s a coincidence 
you about done 
  yeah 
  okay 
come 
let s make that
computer say  hi  
go ahead  lisa 
so it was the other way around 
i was named after the computer 
nothing was named after anybody 
it s a coincidence 
come on 
what s the matter with you 
what s the matter with you  why
are you telling her these things 
why are you still telling
her i m her father 
a judge told her you re her father 
no  he didn t 
and where the hell
do you get off
telling time magazine i ve slept
with 28  of the men in america 
that s not   
where do you get off 
that s not remotely what i said 
it s right here 
first of all  can i tell you
something about time magazine 
i believe it s a training
facility for paid assassins 
 jobs insists   i am quoting   
i didn t invent math 
 28  of the male population of the
united states could be the father  
i wasn t saying you ve slept
with 28  of american men 
i was using an algorithm
based on the blood test 
which said there was a 94 1 
chance that i m the father 
you re trying to publicly paint
me as a slut and a whore 
believe me  i m not trying to
publicly do anything with you 
two million people read time 
how am i supposed   
it would be more if they d
put me on the cover 
but dan kottke decided
to kidney punch me 
i applied for welfare yesterday 
  i m sorry 
  hello 
i said i applied
for welfare yesterday 
the time article said your apple
stock was worth  441 million 
and i wanted to ask you
how you felt about that 
well  i feel like apple stock has
been dramatically undervalued 
this would be
a good time to get in 
your daughter and her mother   
  chrisann 
     are on welfare 
we re living in
a hovel in menlo park 
we can t pay the heating bills 
she sleeps in a parka 
your daughter   
she s not my daughter 
because  as reported
by time magazine 
i ve slept with 28 
of the men in america 
  no 
  all of them 
exactly nine months
before lisa was born 
i ve got andy here 
excuse me 
we re there 
hey  chris 
  hey  andy 
  how are you doin  
terrible 
you guys caught up now 
excuse me for saying hello to my
friend who thinks you re a dick 
i don t think you re a   
we re there 
no  it s got a one in six
chance of working 
god damn it 
we re not a pit crew at daytona 
this can t be fixed in seconds 
you didn t have seconds 
you had three weeks 
the universe was created
in a third of that time 
well  someday you ll have to
tell us how you did it 
here s what i m gonna do 
i m gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo 
i m gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up 
the bag was designed
by susan kare 
the macintosh font that s
scrolling across the screen
was designed by steve capps 
the starry night and
skywriting was bruce horn 
macpaint  macwrite  alice   
down to the calculator 
and then i m gonna say  the
voice demo that didn t work
was designed by andy hertzfeld 
steve   
five in six is your chance
of surviving the first round
of russian roulette 
and you ve reversed those odds 
so unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of
your friends  family 
colleagues  stockholders 
and the press 
i wouldn t stand here arguing 
i d go try and get some more
bullets out of the gun 
do it  andy 
stop  you 
what size shirt do you wear  me 
does anyone know
what size shirt he wears 
does anyone know
what size shirt i wear 
does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is 
the disk fits in your pocket 
i need a shirt with a breast
pocket  i can take it out onstage 
  a shirt 
  the disk 
i need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket 
yes  which one of the no
stores that are open at 8 45
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes 
go out in the lobby  find someone my
size who s wearing a white shirt 
tell them i ll trade them
for a free computer 
and they get to keep my shirt 
does it have to be a white shirt 
is blue okay 
  no  the mac is beige 
  i m beige 
the disk is blue 
the shirt has to be white 
andy 
hello  i m macintosh 
bring me the head
of andy hertzfeld 
i tried to get it to say 
 hello   but it s shy 
yeah 
so that s it 
that s it 
i don t get it 
i know 
what are people
going to do with it 
lisa  how old are you now 
you know how old she is 
how old are you  lisa 
five 
come sit here for a minute 
do you know what this is 
it s a computer 
can i borrow
your hand for a second 
point that arrow and click 
you don t have to  but if you
want  you can play with it 
nothing you can do
will break it 
so just do
whatever you want with it 
what are you doing 
i m paying you exactly what the
court ordered me to pay you 
 385 a month 
i m not the one who
decided on that amount 
and i m asking you how you feel 
if you feel all right 
if it feels all right to
you that your daughter   
she s not my   
that your daughter
and her mother are on welfare
while you re worth  441
million for making that 
i m proud to say apple donates
computers to underfunded schools 
and we ll be doing more of
the same with the mac   
what 
apple donates millions of dollars 
worth of computers to schools 
what does that
have to do with   
imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours 
we re minutes away
from being able to do that 
in your head  was that
an answer to my question 
tell me the question again 
i wasn t the one who sued
you for child support 
no  let   
san mateo county sued you 
no  let me explain
what happened 
because i have
plenty of time right now 
  excuse me 
  you have a visitor 
just wanted to say good luck 
hey  chrisann 
hello  woz 
hang on 
just wanted to say good luck 
thanks  you  too 
  it s a big morning 
  yeah 
you should see
this crowd out there 
this crowd  it s like  um   
i can t really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor  man 
yeah  so  uh  listen  i
want to ask you a favor  yeah 
can you acknowledge the apple ii
team in your remarks 
i cannot 
just an acknowledgment 
have them stand up 
we re launching the mac 
it d be a morale booster 
just a mention
so they could get
a round of applause 
  woz   
  just a mention 
can we stick a pin
in this for a minute 
  sure  yep 
  thank you 
just talking about an
acknowledgment for the team 
i ve got chrisann in there 
i ll see you in just a second 
yep 
that 
what 
you asked me what
people are gonna do with it 
they re gonna do that 
one of the engineers 
thank you 
do you like it 
i m sorry 
it s an abstract 
you used macpaint 
push that key and the  s 
at the same time 
now type your name 
do you know
which box says  save  
right  go ahead and click on it 
i ll put some money
in your account 
and buy you a new house 
someplace near a decent school 
thank you 
woz wants a minute 
and sculley s asking for you 
we re done 
could you teach me more things 
on the computer 
lisa  wait for me
in the hall  please 
you can put your coat on
in the hall 
bye  lisa 
bye 
lisa  in the hall  now 
i just wanna know  when you say
you re gonna put
money in my account 
how much we re talking about 
it s a school day 
she needs to be in school 
i m gonna give you
whatever you need 
woz wants me to acknowledge
the apple ii team 
you must be able to see
that she looks like you 
i don t want to insult woz 
i just think it s backward looking
at exactly the wrong moment 
i know you heard what i said 
i heard what you said  joanna 
it s just  we re about to
do this thing 
at 9 41  the planet s gonna shift
on its axis  nigh and forever 
two most significant events
of the 20th century 
the allies win the war 
and this 
this 
so maybe right now isn t the
very best time to scold me
for not being a better father
to a kid who s not my kid 
the test said i    i don t
care what the test said 
i don t care about 94 1   or
the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28  of american men 
i m buying her a new house 
i m giving her money 
there s a small girl who
believes you re her father 
that s all   that s all
the math there is 
she believes it  what are
you gonna do about that 
god sent his only son
on a suicide mission 
but we like him anyway
because he made trees 
we re gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days 
20 000 a month after that 
so maybe you could give me
a break  ms  hoffman 
woz 
hey 
there s nothing in that vending
machine that won t kill you 
just browsing 
let s take a walk 
can i tell you something 
yeah  after the
meeting in maui 
the apple ii team was upset and angry
and down  and do you know why 
because the apple ii
wasn t mentioned even once 
the apple ii wasn t mentioned   
yes  that s it 
you have it  yes 
that wasn t an oversight 
they know that 
they know it wasn t 
look  i don t wanna make
a big deal out of this   
that s entirely
within your power 
the apple ii is   
the apple ii is
what was  my friend 
the apple ii is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years 
and if you
embarrass these people 
you are going to see a brain drain
at this company  my brother 
markkula took you off the lisa 
not them and not me 
so don t blame   
markkula took me off the lisa
because of his strong religious
objection to making it good 
now  i gave you everything
you wanted on the apple ii 
you don t ask for a lot  there
wasn t a single fight you lost 
do you concede the slots
are the reason
for the success of the apple ii 
we can t possibly still be
talking about the slots 
i have a point 
it s been seven years  the eight
slots on the apple ii   
you re still doing it  you re
talking about the slots 
there s something
wrong with you 
this argument
started in the garage 
what are you talking about  why
would you only want two slots 
a printer and a modem 
with eight slots  you   
this is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots 
i appreciate the engineering 
but it s not what we re doing 
  and thank god i won that argument 
  woz 
   because the open system is what
people love about the machine 
and it s why it sold
and still sells 
an open system  we re not
doing an open system 
of course we are 
that s what people want  and the
breakthrough on the apple ii   
people don t know what they want
until you show it to them 
serious users want to customize 
they wanna modify 
they wanna jack it up 
they want hardware
engineers like me
to expand its capabilities 
okay 
keyboards for music 
better sound board 
better display boards 
improved memory cards 
and it s why there are
3 000 people here right now 
the slots are what allowed
the apple ii to run 
for just one example  visicalc 
which  from my guess 
single handedly sold between
200 000 and 300 000 machines 
they want slots 
they don t get a vote 
when dylan wrote
shelter from the storm 
he didn t ask people
to contribute to the lyrics 
plays don t stop so the
playwright can ask the audience
what scene they d like
to see next 
painters    we re on the verge of
a tectonic    hobbyists are   
hobbyists 
a printer and a modem 
two slots 
the apple ii team
has my affection 
but i m not loving up a 7 year old
product at the mac launch 
computers aren t paintings 
fuck you 
i m gonna say  fuck you 
every time you say that
until you either die or stop 
  steve   
  try it 
  steve 
  say it 
computers aren t paintings 
fuck you 
yes  they are  and what i
want is a closed system 
end to end control 
completely incompatible
with anything 
computers aren t supposed
to have human flaws 
i m not going to build
this one with yours 
steve 
hey 
today is about the macintosh 
and the mac is mine 
i give you that 
  thank you 
  i give you that 
just publicly acknowledge
the apple ii team
because it s
the right thing to do 
we ll know soon enough if you are
leonardo da vinci or just think you are 
but in the meantime 
it would be great   
in the meantime 
the apple ii is done 
seven years  
it was a great run 
you should go out in the
house and take your seat 
the mac is jef raskin s 
say it for me 
  computers aren t   
  fuck you 
all right 
  we re there 
  i need more time 
you can t have it 
  twenty minutes 
  it s 8 58 
we can start late 
hear me  we re a computer company 
we can t start late 
  then i have another idea 
  what 
it s deceptive and
borderline unethical 
i m listening 
it ll run on the 512 
  you tested it 
  yeah 
wait 
you re gonna demo
a 128 computer on a 512 
nobody s gonna know 
and you think that s
 borderline  unethical 
name my other choices  please 
please  you have to tell me why it s
so important for it to say  hello  
hollywood  they made
computers scary things 
see how this reminds you
of a friendly face 
that the disk slot
is a goofy grin 
it s warm and it s playful 
and it needs to say  hello  
it needs to say  hello 
because it can 
we re not committing fraud 
the 512 is gonna ship
in under a year 
will you absolve me of your
eastern european disapproval 
the computer in 2001
said  hello  all the time 
and it still scared
the shit out of me 
absolve me 
just for this 
and just for now 
ladies and
gentlemen  please welcome
founding board member 
mike markkula 
all right  okay 
go make a dent
in the universe  steven 
see you in a couple of hours 
and i m going to take us
through the formal part of the meeting 
the legal part  if you will 
thank merciful god 
the cavalry s shown up 
because i hear you ve been
worse than usual this morning 
i didn t think
that was possible 
so i ve been dispatched
as the  steve whisperer  
this is a  55 margaux 
it s 9 00 in the morning 
this is a  55 margaux 
is it my imagination  or have
you started to dress like me 
it was a bad idea to have markkula
open with quarterly reports 
instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience 
just big 10 000 gallon tanks of cold
water  dropped from the ceiling 
save mike some money
on index cards 
oh  just relax 
why 
i don t know  no one s ever
asked me that question 
there you go 
you re the only one who sees
the world the same way i do 
no one sees the world
the same way you do 
i m like julius caesar  john 
i m surrounded by enemies 
no  you re not 
the board   
oh   the board   
the board s behind you 
only because you see
to it they are 
oh  i think it s a good board 
but if you want me to
push them out one by one 
we can talk about that 
i want you to
push them out all at once
through a window 
if it s the nearest exit 
the look on their faces
when we showed them the spot 
i couldn t see their faces  because they
were banging their heads on the table 
yesterday  the day after
it airs once 
the publisher of adweek calls it
the best commercial of all time 
of all time 
and it is 
and if anyone does one better 
it s gonna be chiat day  who
the board wanted to replace 
and it s gonna be lee clow  who the
board thought was out of his mind 
ladies and gentlemen  1984 
we have created 
for the first time in all history 
a garden of pure ideology
where each worker may bloom
secure from the pests
of any contradictory
true thoughts 
our unification of thoughts
is more powerful a weapon than
any fleet or army on earth 
we are one people   
did we use skinheads as extras 
a couple of people
have told me that 
yeah 
we paid skinheads  i ve got
skinheads on my payroll 
they had a look you wanted 
  the skinheads 
  yeah 
okay  let s keep
that to ourselves 
we shall prevail 
on january 24th 
apple computer will
introduce macintosh 
who else knows 
who else knows what 
that we paid terrorists
to be in our tv commercial 
john 
they were wrong about the ad 
but they re a good board 
good people 
their only problem    their
problem is that they re people 
people 
the very nature of people
is something to be overcome 
when i was running pepsi 
we had a lot of success
focusing on 18 to 55 year olds
who weren t members
of violent hate groups 
i get it  you re not
surrounded by enemies 
we re almost there 
i m back and forth on the dylan 
i might quote a different verse 
what are the choices 
 for the loser now will be later
to win   which is what we have 
or 
 come mothers and fathers
throughout the land 
 and don t criticize
what you can t understand 
 your sons
and your daughters    
    are beyond your command   
i just lost a hundred bucks
to andy hertzfeld 
he said you d change it
to that verse 
we got 45 seconds  i want to
use it to ask you a question 
why do people who are adopted
feel like they were rejected
instead of selected 
that came out of nowhere 
 your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command 
 your old road
is rapidly aging  
so go fuck yourself  because
my name is steve jobs 
and  the times
they are a changing   
i don t feel rejected 
  you re sure 
  very sure 
because it s not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say 
 nah  we re not interested
in this one  
on the other hand 
someone did choose you 
it s having no control 
you find out
you were out of the loop
when the most crucial events in
your life were set in motion 
as long as you have control 
i don t understand people
who give it up 
what inspired hertzfeld
to make that bet 
he was warning me
that being your father figure
could be dangerous 
keep your 100 bucks 
i m sticking with
the first verse 
good 
what the hell does he mean 
nothing 
i m proud of you 
thank you  boss 
it s my pleasure to
introduce my friend
and the ceo of apple 
john sculley 
  john 
  yeah 
lisa made a painting on the mac 
the macintosh  apple s
near mythological home computer 
has gotten off to a rocky start
in its battle with
industry titan ibm 
with sales originally projected
to be 1 000 000 in
the first quarter 
apple has sold only 35 000 of
the user friendly machines 
the insistence
by steve jobs that it d have
what s called
 end to end control  
which is a way of saying
that it s not compatible
with most outside
hardware or software
is the shakespearean flaw in a
machine that had potential 
apple computers
closed two of its factories today
in the wake of
disappointing sales 
do you know how
many macs were sold last month 
500 
in a move that surprised
some  but not all  on wall street 
the board of directors
of apple computers
voted today to fire
its co founder  steve jobs 
did he jump  or was he pushed 
his ex boss  apple ceo john
sculley  refused to comment 
however 
in an exclusive interview 
steve wozniak has slammed the integrity
of his old friend steve jobs 
he calls jobs  an insulting
and hurtful guy  
jobs is hitting back with
a new company and a new computer 
apple has a new competitor 
steve jobs  black cube is aimed
at the education market 
few people have the
ability to make the world wait 
but that is just what jobs is
doing with his new company  next 
focus seems kind of sharp 
on the slide 
the floor  the pin spot 
i think we want a sharp focus 
don t take it personally 
just not a fan of
the circus aesthetic 
all right  let s hold here 
we re gonna have to go up
and refocus the instruments 
just one  the 30 is fine 
while we re holding  there are
well wishers in the vip room 
and woz is here 
steve wozniak  yes 
hey  thank you very much 
and andy hertzfeld 
  andy hertzfeld 
  thank you 
john sculley is here  too 
it s nice that he s here 
really  i don t think
it s very nice at all 
you have to see them 
they wanna pay their respects 
if they were respectful  we d
all still be at apple right now 
look   
if they really wished me well 
they d keep it to themselves 
can i tell you something  i don t
think they do wish me well 
but i m all right with that 
i m over apple 
i got over the mac 
and woz and sculley 
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart 
build a new one 
  can i tell you something 
  yes 
you said you wouldn t
compete with them 
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market 
which they putatively own 
so  i think it s cool
they re here 
they re suing me 
still 
it was nice they came 
they re not being magnanimous 
they want it to look
like an amicable divorce 
history doesn t remember joe
dimaggio kindly for dumping marilyn 
steve 
what s your problem 
i don t know  but i m sure
it can be traced back to you 
you know  i m the one who has
to explain you to people 
 100 000 to paul rand
for a corporate logo 
when we didn t even know
what our company made 
a  650 000 mold for the cube
because god forbid the angles be
90 1 instead of 90 
i forbid the angles to
be 90 1 instead of 90 
that box could be on display
at the guggenheim 
don t give them reason
to say to the press
you have a chip
on your shoulder 
will you do that for me 
i don t have a chip
on my shoulder 
okay  okay 
but don t give them
a reason to say you do 
i don t 
that s the right attitude 
that s not an attitude 
they re gonna call me back in a
minute to look at the light 
get one out of the way 
fine 
  yeah 
  yeah 
one more thing 
sure 
no questions from
the press after 
no  why 
until i have better answers 
no press avail 
if somebody asks where i am  you
just saw me  and i ll be right back 
okay 
who do you want first 
bring me the face
of steve wozniak 
hang on 
i thought you went to school 
hang on 
you were supposed to go to school
an hour ago  i thought you left 
i didn t wake up my mom
on time this morning 
it s happened before  too 
i wake up with the alarm  and then
i get dressed and eat breakfast 
but sometimes i forget to see
what time it is after that 
why doesn t your mom just
set her own alarm clock 
it s one of my chores 
i don t understand what that has
to do with why you re still   
where s your mother 
she went to find a payphone 
an hour ago  she said   
you don t have to
raise your hand 
you said it was off by a little 
it is 
i just measured it 
joanna   
exactly a foot
on all four sides 
there are six sides  but you re
not supposed be here right now 
we know if four of the sides
are equal to each other 
the other two must be
equal as well 
the top  bottom  right  and left
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back 
they re not  i measured them 
lisa  i m kind of
an expert in design 
and that s a 20 cent ruler  you think
there s a chance it could be off 
if i had another ruler 
i would measure this ruler 
but i really doubt it s off 
when your mother comes back 
you have to go to school 
because it s a ruler 
why is it off 
did you hear what i just said 
yes 
because sometimes
it seems like you just
keep saying what you want
without listening 
i m listening 
is there something you need 
no 
why isn t it a perfect cube 
you ve asked me before 
i forget what it is 
it s an optical anomaly 
to the human eye  a perfect
cube doesn t look like a cube 
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides 
what s an anomaly 
you ve asked me
that before  too 
i don t know why
you keep doing that 
it s an exception  something
that doesn t fit a pattern 
you have to go to school 
come in 
i think you two have met 
hello  old friend 
  you look well 
  so do you 
so do you 
and they re telling me george is
ready for you to look at the focus 
take a walk with me 
  is this lisa 
  yeah 
  this can t be lisa 
  it is 
lisa s this big  they get taller 
come on 
  do you remember me 
  she doesn t 
i m your dad s friend 
steve wozniak 
i apologize 
i don t remember you 
you re very polite 
  woz 
  yeah 
chrisann s at a payphone 
would you find her 
yeah 
  good turnout 
  great turnout 
yeah 
 insanely great  
insanely great 
you know  this is the first time we
haven t played for the same team 
it s like you re releasing
your first solo album 
i appreciate your
inviting me to the launch 
i just want to wipe
the slate clean 
that s exactly what i want 
that s why i came backstage 
i want you to know
i ll be out there with you 
any chance i can get you to
go out there instead of me 
  i love you  steve 
  i love you  too  woz 
you know  some
things were said  they were 
they were said in public 
they were published 
were you pressured to do it 
was i what 
check it out 
it s the orchestra pit
for the san francisco opera 
was i pressured to do it 
i once met seiji ozawa
at tanglewood 
a thunderous conductor 
godly artfulness and nuance 
and i asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can t 
surprisingly  he   
he didn t beat
the living shit out of you 
that s right  no  he said 
 the musicians play
their instruments 
 i play the orchestra  
that feels like something that sounds
good  but doesn t mean anything 
markkula  sculley  they ask you
to slag me off in the press 
i had reason to be angry 
  did they 
  absolutely not 
but they asked you to talk 
apple was under siege 
you d just left the company 
someone had to talk
to the press 
i m right here  woz 
the company left me 
i begged you 
i begged you 
the apple ii accounted
for 70  of the revenue 
what did you think
was gonna happen 
you didn t care enough about
the apple ii or the lisa 
let s be really clear 
i didn t care at all about
the apple ii or the lisa 
i wasn t pressured to do it 
what i said to the press
was an honest  if tempered 
reflection of what i believed 
  woz 
  yeah 
what the fuck is on your wrist 
you wanna know 
i literally can t wait 
everyone s gonna be
wearing these in 10 years 
it s a nixie watch 
made using nixie tubes 
this is actually
40 year old technology 
cold cathode tubes  they re
operating at 140 volts 
i tilt my wrist 45 degrees 
it s right there 
hours  minutes  and seconds 
the way our minds work 
look at that 
do me a favor 
set the watch ahead like you re on a
plane and just changed time zones 
not a problem 
unscrew that 
just hit the button 
excuse me  flight attendant 
the man next to me would appear
to be detonating a bomb 
you think this looks
like a bomb 
even right now 
i m not 100  sure it isn t 
i think maybe once people
get used to it   
no 
i was angry 
you were saying things
about the apple ii 
and the way you were
treating the team   
woz 
you get a free pass for life 
i got to get back onstage 
we got  like  two minutes
of rehearsal time left 
do you understand how
condescending that just was 
maybe you don t 
i don t want to see you
get dragged off
an airplane in
plastic handcuffs 
i get a free pass
for life from you 
you give out the passes 
you give them to me 
you re gonna have a stroke 
little buddy 
what did you do 
why has lisa not heard of me 
shit  man  how many
fourth graders have heard of you 
you can t write code 
you re not an engineer 
you re not a designer 
you can t put
a hammer to a nail 
i built the circuit board 
the graphical
interface was stolen
from xerox parc 
jef raskin was the leader
of the mac team
before you threw him off
his own project 
everything  someone else
designed the box 
so  how come 10 times in a day i
read  steve jobs is a genius  
what do you do 
i play the orchestra 
and you re a good musician 
you sit right there  you re
the best in your row 
i came here to clear the air 
do you know why i came here 
didn t you just answer that 
i came here because
you re gonna get killed 
your computer s gonna fail 
you had a college and
university advisory board
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for  2 000 to  3 000 
you ve priced next at  6 500 
and that doesn t include the
optional  3 000 hard drive 
which people will discover
isn t optional 
because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything 
and the  2 500 laser printer
brings the total to  12 000 
and  in the entire world 
you are the only person who cares
that it s housed in a perfect cube 
you re gonna get killed 
and i came here to stand next
to you while that happens
because that s what friends do 
that s what men do 
i don t need your  pass  
we go back  so don t talk to
me like i m other people 
i m the only one that knows
that this guy here
is someone you invented 
i m standing by you because that
perfect cube  that does nothing 
is about to be
the single biggest failure
in the history of
personal computing 
tell me something else
i don t know 
back onstage 
we re out of time  they ve got to
mop the stage and open the house 
if it crashes 
it crashes  right 
you ll make a joke 
i ll make a joke 
if it crashes  it crashes 
it s a good slogan 
 next  if it crashes  it crashes  
i m not just talking
about the demo  steve 
if it tanks 
we don t swallow cyanide 
we go back to the drawing board 
no more drawing boards 
invent the edsel twice  you don t
get any more drawing boards 
tell me what the plan is 
you have to tell me the plan 
because i don t know 
you re walking around like
you ve got  can t lose  cards 
the plan will reveal itself to
you when you re ready to see it 
will i have to drop acid 
couldn t hurt 
is there a plan 
have i ever let you down 
every single goddamn time 
then i m due 
is there 
joanna  there s a plan 
i just don t wanna put you in a
position where you re lying to people 
start 15 minutes late
so avie can recompile
and give us a fighting chance 
jesus christ  how many times
are we gonna have this   
we re not starting late ever 
fine 
we re not ever starting late 
    ever starting late  
but where do you come down
on starting late 
lisa s been doing this thing
where she asks me about stuff
i ve already told her 
she asks me questions  and i know
she already knows the answers 
what s that about 
kids do that when they re scared
one of their parents
is in a bad mood 
they try to get you talking
about something you like 
it s very common
and can be treated
by talking to her
about things she likes 
do you have any experience
or training in this field 
no 
tell them to open the house 
where s lisa 
she s around 
what does that mean 
she s running
around the building 
an hour ago  you said you
were taking her to school 
she begged me to let her stay 
there are fathers
who would so love   
it is wrong  okay  it is morally
wrong  it s parentally wrong 
it is wrong for you to use lisa as
a way of getting money from me 
she ll know 
if she doesn t already 
that that is your
primary use for her 
and she will hate you
for the rest of your life 
she will see 
if she doesn t already 
that her mother is a woman who stands
up to men 
by living off of them 
by not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them 
imprisoned 
i can t get rid of you 
i need a doctor 
and i need a dentist 
i dropped out of college after a
semester  but  okay  let s have a look 
you will support your
daughter and her mother 
did you pay someone  1 500
to bless your house 
did you hear what i said 
did you 
i don t remember
how much it was  steve 
it was  1 500 
they don t do it for free 
  they don t 
  they charge  1 500 
how i spend   
fuck  you know what 
i m not even   
were you about to say   how i spend
my money is none of your business  
i have a sinus infection  and
i need to see a dentist  too 
so you can see how your  blessing 
budget could have been better spent 
like on a perfect cube 
  look at me  chrisann 
  what 
you know who i am  right 
yes 
and you know i know people 
what are you talking about 
look at me 
and you know the people i
know  they know people 
what is this 
if i ever hear again
that you ve thrown
a cereal bowl at lisa s head   
what     my private
line s gonna ring 
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say   we re all set  
that s how i ll learn that you re dead 
are you   
i threw the bowl on the floor 
i didn t throw it at her head 
she wasn t even in the room 
she was nowhere   
i threw the bowl on the floor 
she s a little girl 
you re scaring her 
i m a grown man 
you re scaring me 
taking out the garbage
is a chore 
clearing the table is a chore 
waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy 
please teach me more
about being a parent 
we re all done here 
it means so much coming from
someone who won t admit he is one 
stop screaming at lisa 
i give her responsibilities 
got it  and one day she s
gonna thank me for it 
probably in your sleep 
fuck off 
okay 
i never    i never
threw anything at her head 
steve   
i never would 
things don t become so
because you say so 
there ll be more money in your
account by the end of business 
were you being nice 
oh  yeah 
andy s next 
hertzfeld or cunningham 
hertzfeld 
he s playing with avie tevanian
on the computer backstage 
ladies and gentlemen 
the house is now open 
   playing in front
of thousands of people 
steve 
can he do it later  joel 
we go in eight minutes 
can i just get a quick reaction
to the press this morning 
what about it  the size
of it  the volume 
i ll tell you on background   
i was hoping for
a quote from steve 
i ll tell you on background
that i ve never seen anything
like it in the tech industry 
i called the wall street journal
to take out
a full page ad for today 
and do you know what
their sales guy said 
 why bother  it d be like notifying
macy s that tomorrow is christmas  
you saw the stewart alsop
newsletter 
i did 
i m sorry  joanna  i need to
get steve on the record 
the headline was   dear next 
when can i get my machine  
when can he 
we ll announce the ship date
in the next eight to 10 weeks 
alsop s not talking
about the ship date 
he wants to know when he
can get one to play with 
we have a lot of
respect for stewart alsop 
and we want to get
a machine into his hands
so he can tell
his subscribers about it 
  when will that be 
  very soon 
a couple of days 
a week  off the record 
  off the record 
  completely 
we think   
he ll get it when it s finished 
it s not finished 
it s almost finished 
i ve been watching you rehearse
the demo for three weeks 
yeah 
  what s left 
  a little thing 
  what 
  i think that s   
we re off the record  and joel s always
been good at understanding nuance 
what s left to finish 
i guess  in layman s terms  you d
have to say we don t have an os 
  an operating system 
  yeah 
what do you mean 
well  the os is
what runs the computer 
in fact  it sort of
is the computer 
how has it been running  how s
it gonna run this morning 
what do you mean 
you don t have an os 
it s like this 
avie tevanian is our
chief software designer 
and he wrote a demo program 
it s like we built a great car 
but we haven t built the engine 
so we put a golf cart battery in there
to make it go for a little bit 
all this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself 
you re telling me the only thing
you ve built is a black cube 
yes  yeah 
but isn t it the coolest
black cube you ve ever seen 
  is this   
  we re off the record 
is this a strategy or a problem
  because if it s a problem   
do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man 
it s not a problem 
i wouldn t understand it anyway 
i don t understand it either 
and my name s on the patents 
it s got email 
well  email s not just
for tech specialists anymore 
well  it is  but it won t be 
and i assume an email sent
on a next computer
can only be received
by a next computer 
closed  end to end 
the new trash can is wrong 
i wanna tell you i appreciate
all the hours you put into it 
but i can t because
of how terrible it is 
go back to the other one 
and why are we still giving
three options on the clock 
how many options
do you wanna give 
two   buy it  or  don t  
can i talk to you for a second 
abso fruitly 
uh  look  man 
avie s been recompiling 
but he says
there may be some
glitches this morning 
if all there are 
are some glitches 
it ll be a triumph of
miraculous magnitude 
why are you
translating for avie 
i didn t want him
to find out the hard way
your position on
glitches in a demo 
but it sounds like
you ve mellowed 
i ve been growing  andy  i ve
been learning to love myself 
mmm  i wouldn t have ever
dreamed that was a problem 
fantastic burn 
you need to go to your seat 
how about lisa  getting into
a school for gifted kids 
yeah  she was tested 
and it turns out she can fly 
but  seriously  it s a big deal 
i know it s a big deal   that s why
i built the school a building 
well  i m sure
that s not why she got in 
really 
can i show you something
funny from macworld 
i can t think of anything
i have to do right now 
it ll make you feel good 
joanna  look at this 
oh  andy  he s only got
a couple of minutes 
it s guy kawasaki writing in macworld 
you re gonna like this 
well  can we all enjoy it later 
he wrote a parody press release about
apple buying next for your os 
he imagines a near future 
where apple needs your os
and has to buy next 
and you come back as ceo 
he has gates saying   there would
now be more innovations from jobs
 that microsoft could copy  
you can read it later 
thanks 
she would ve gotten in without
you donating a building 
still  it s something to
talk about in the interview 
all right  good luck 
thanks 
give that to me  i ll
throw it out for you 
i m gonna hang on to it 
what 
what 
you ready for sculley 
excuse me  lisa 
you can t shout 
lisa 
you have to go 
it s dangerous up here  that s
why i make other people do it 
who are you hiding from 
me or your mom 
i m not hiding 
let s go 
what were you listening to 
i m listening to two
versions of the same song 
and then  when i get to the end 
i rewind to listen
to them again 
it s the same song  but the
versions are different 
  what s the song 
  okay 
so  it s a really old song  and
it s called both sides  now 
 both sides  now  
yeah 
what s it about 
it s about    there are three verses 
clouds  love  and life 
and the person singing is singing
that they used to think of   
that they used to think about   
clouds  love  and life 
right  one way  yeah  but now they
look at them another way  and they   
they ve come to
the conclusion that
they really don t know clouds 
love  or life at all 
those are the exact words 
yeah  joni mitchell 
 cause it s not a really old song 
unless i m a really old guy 
you have to go to school now 
do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions 
right now 
the first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish 
i didn t mean i want to know
the difference right now 
i meant you have to
go to school right now 
i can stay and watch 
you are truant 
you re committing a crime 
i m not gonna miss
anything important 
how do you know 
i read ahead 
the pilgrims make it
to the new world 
then  the declaration
of independence 
yeah  you skipped
a couple of centuries 
steve 
chrisann s out there 
let s go 
can i make my case for staying 
nope 
she was with me 
come on  your dad
doesn t want us to stay 
that s not true  that s not   
you have to be
in school  is all 
i m committing
a crime right now 
and i don t
wanna get in trouble 
you re not in trouble 
i was kidding 
okay 
hey  what was
the second version 
you said the first version was girlish 
what was the second version 
i can t really
think of the word 
okay  well 
have a good day at school 
 regretful  
what 
like  wishing you could go
back and do things different 
you re too young
to be regretful 
not me 
the person singing the song 
got it   regretful  
that makes sense because   
i wanna live with you 
six minutes 
  you want to see sculley 
  no 
you know all those times
i told you  you needed security 
here s why 
i don t know how it is i ve
gotten older and you haven t 
some deal with the devil
i was never offered 
so  you know what i ve been
thinking for the last four years 
as it turns out  john  i ve never
known what you were thinking 
no newborn baby has control 
do you know what
i m talking about 
in  84  before the mac launch 
you said   
yeah 
you said that being adopted
meant you didn t have control 
we re starting
in a minute  so   
why do people think i fired you 
it s fine  john 
it s all behind us 
is it 
hmm 
don t play stupid 
you can t pull it off 
you came here to ask me why
people think you fired me 
why do people think i fired you 
just confirm
something for me  okay 
you liked the ad 
right  the commercial 
1984  you liked it 
when are you
gonna get furniture 
it s not an easy process 
it is  you buy a
couch  take it from there 
i d be really surprised
if you came here
to talk about
interior decorating 
i liked the ad very much 
  you did 
  you know i did 
you re a lying son of a
bitch who tried to kill it 
it s time to take
a hard look at the mac 
it s past time 
it s overpriced 
we need to drop it to  1 995  we
need to double the marketing budget 
put more bodies on an internal hard
drive and invest in fileserver 
where the hell did you get the
idea that i tried to kill   
  lee clow 
  lee s wrong 
  he s lying 
  he s mistaken 
where would the money come from 
it would come from finally
getting rid of the apple ii 
the apple ii is the
only thing making money 
you agreed with the board 
i understood the board s
concerns  but i   
the board s concerns that
we didn t show the product 
among other things 
but my question was   
what other things  honestly  i m
just asking  cause i m curious 
you said  among other things  
among other things  it was
set in a dystopian galaxy 
it took place on a planet
where we don t live 
it was dark  and the
opposite of our brand 
and we didn t show the product 
people talked about the ad  but most of
them didn t know what we were selling 
the mac needs
to sell for  1 995 
there is no market
research telling us
that the mac is failing
because it s overpriced 
it s telling us that
people don t like it
because they think it
doesn t do anything 
it s closed  end to end 
we didn t know it wasn t what
people wanted  but it isn t 
they want slots  they want
choices  they want options 
the way we buy stereos 
mix and match components 
john  listen to me 
whoever said the customer
is always right was 
i promise you  a customer 
it had skinheads in it 
she was liberating them 
liberating the skinheads 
the ad didn t have anything to
do with fucking skinheads 
we used them as fucking extras 
nobody even knows
they were skinheads 
i m just saying 
the board had concerns   
you invented
lifestyle advertising 
and  our brand  was my brand 
my job is to make a
recommendation to the board 
we showed a lot of happy
people drinking pepsi 
we didn t say the world was going
to end if you bought a dr  pepper 
recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget 
i can t 
and we showed the product 
we showed it being opened 
we showed it being poured 
being consumed 
what are you gonna do  recommend
that we kill the mac 
i already have  steve 
what 
when 
you think the secret to
your success
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda 
i didn t kill the ad  steve 
i m the only reason
it made it on the air 
just now 
an hour ago  i m coming
from markkula s house 
what did he say 
what did he say 
invent something new 
i ll give you a team 
you can sit in maui 
the resorts come with couches 
wait a minute  are you saying you
recommended terminating the mac 
or you recommended taking me
off the mac team 
we bought three spots
in the super bowl 
two 30s and a 60 
and after we screened it  the
board wanted that money back 
and they asked me to
sell off the spots 
chiat day sold off the
two 30s  but not the 60 
and i let it be known
to lee clow
that if he didn t try very hard
to sell the last spot 
i wouldn t be unhappy 
if we drop the price
and double the budget   
you can t drop the price
or double the budget 
i mean  the only way to do that is
to take money out of the apple ii 
the apple ii should embarrass you 
it embarrasses me 
it doesn t embarrass
the shareholders 
i don t give a shit
about the shareholders 
that s why i hired you  so i don t
ever have to hear about shareholders 
the shareholders are my problem 
and the board represents
the shareholders 
that s how it works 
you sure it wasn t lee clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60 
at my direction  steve 
you think he would have done that
on his own  taken it on himself 
yeah  i think he would ve done
what it took to save it from you 
i was the only thing
protecting it 
you didn t want the ad
because you were trying to kill the
mac two months before it launched 
you are fucking delusional 
can i mention something to you 
sure 
i have no earthly idea
why you re here 
the story of why
and how you left apple 
which is quickly becoming
mythologized  isn t true 
i m gonna take this
to the board myself 
  don t do that 
  i am doing that 
you can t 
why 
they believe you re no longer
necessary to this company 
i get hate mail 
death threats 
i get death threats 
my kids are getting taunted 
why do people think i fired you 
joanna s gonna call
my name in a second 
  steve 
  that was unrehearsed 
yeah  i ll be there
in just a second 
i gave you your day in court 
you  gave  me  i gave the
board a clear choice 
i said   do you want to invest
in the apple ii or the mac  
and they chose the apple ii 
the same people who wanted
to dump the super bowl spot 
and then i got on
a plane to china 
mr  sculley  there s a call
for you on line 1 
or i almost got on a plane  because
i got a call in the lounge 
who made that call 
doesn t matter 
it matters to me 
who made the call 
john sculley 
john  if you get on that plane 
you ll have lost your job
by the time it lands 
steve s been calling the board 
he wants you out 
i left my bags on the plane 
my shit s still somewhere
in beijing 
i took a car back to cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night 
i know what time it is 
i need a quorum here in one hour 
and i want steve here  too 
you took me off the
mac  and it was bad business 
the quorum call was a homicide 
right there  that s the part
that s bullshit  my friend 
it was a suicide  because
you knew your cards 
and i showed you mine 
i showed you mine 
and you did it anyway 
what did you think
i was going to do 
i m okay losing 
but i m not gonna forfeit 
i m not okay losing 
we re losing market share 
and the mac is losing money 
our only hope is the apple ii 
which is stagnating
because of its
soon to be obsolete dos 
users are already rigging their machines
to run with a cp m operating system
that s been built
to run on intel 
i can t put it
more simply than this 
we need to put our resources
into updating the apple ii 
by taking resources
from the mac 
  it s failing 
  that s a fact 
it s overpriced  there s
no evidence that it s   
i m the evidence 
i m the world s leading
expert on the mac  john 
what s your resume 
you re issuing
contradictory instructions 
you re insubordinate 
you make people miserable 
our top engineers are fleeing
to sun  dell  hp 
wall street doesn t know
who s driving the bus 
we ve lost hundreds
of millions in value 
and i m the ceo of apple  steve 
that s my resume 
but before that  you sold
carbonated sugar water  right 
i sat in a fucking garage with
wozniak and invented the future 
because artists lead and hacks
ask for a show of hands 
all right  well 
this guy s out of control 
i m perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight 
but if you want me to stay 
you can t have steve 
settle him out 
he can keep a share of stock 
so he gets our newsletter 
he ll have to sever
his connection to apple 
i m dead serious  i want the
secretary to call for a vote 
i fucking dare you 
you have done an outstanding
job over the years
of cultivating the press  and by
that i mean manipulating them
because none of them 
none of their editors 
none of their editors 
publishers  to this day 
know that you forced it 
that you forced the board 
even after i told you
exactly what they d do 
which is exactly what they did 
unanimously 
i don t have any trouble
remembering that  john 
because of it being
the worst night of my life 
and i forced the vote because
i believed i was right 
i still believe i m right 
and i m right 
now  i bled that night 
and i don t bleed 
but time s done its thing 
and i really haven t thought
about it in a while 
i absolutely understand
why you re upset 
and i want people
to know the truth  too 
it s time 
got it 
you re gonna end me  aren t you 
you re being ridiculous 
i m gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself 
then i m gonna order a nice
meal with a  55 margaux 
and sign some autographs 
jesus christ   
you want some advice 
pepsi generation 
don t send woz out to slap me
around in the press 
anybody else 
you  markkula  arthur rock 
anyone but rain man 
don t manipulate him like that 
whatever you may think 
i m always gonna protect him 
come on  steve 
that s what men do 
we can t start late 
i don t think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder 
did you know  back at bandley
the mac team gave
an award every year
to the person who could
stand up to you 
no 
i won 
three years in a row 
cool 
this    this   
this guy kawasaki in macworld   
he accidentally
got it right  didn t he 
you ve been dragging
your feet on the next os
until you can figure out
what apple s going to need 
even if that were true  it doesn t
sound that diabolical to me 
hey  we re ready for you 
i m your closest confidante 
your best friend 
your thing   
what do you call it 
your  work wife  
the whole time 
the last three years   
when did you change your mind
and start building the steve
jobs revenge machine 
house to half 
do you remember skylab 
it was an unmanned satellite
nasa sent up in the early  70s
on a data gathering mission 
the thing is 
when they sent it up 
they didn t know yet how they
were going to get it back 
but they felt like
they were close enough
that in the eight years it was going
to be up there  they d figure it out 
they re on their way now 
they didn t 
so  after eight years 
it came crashing down in a 1 000 mile
swath across the indian ocean 
a little to the left 
a little to the right 
somebody could have gotten hurt 
i really wanted to build
a computer for colleges 
the technology just didn t catch
up as fast as i needed it to 
and you know we re out of money 
ladies and gentlemen  the
program will be starting momentarily 
but then  apple stopped
innovating  and i saw something better 
joanna  i know schools
aren t going to buy
a  13 000 dictionary
with good speakers 
you know i know that 
but apple will 
because avie tevanian is going to
build them exactly the os they need 
they re going to
have to buy me  too 
for half a billion
dollars in stock 
and end to end control
on every product 
ladies and gentlemen 
please welcome   
more than a
year after it was first unveiled
to industry insiders 
the next computer is finally
available in stores 
and it appears to be two
strikes in a row for steve jobs 
students and educators
are finding it difficult
to justify
the machine s high cost 
so much for the black cube 
next just sold
its factory to canon 
and laid off half its employees 
in the world of computers 
it s kill or be killed 
apple computer has
fallen on hard times 
it is laying off
about 2 500 people 
apple is
continuing to lose market share
with no new innovations
in the pipeline
except the newton  a pet
project of ceo john sculley 
if you really want to
be mobile  you want a newton pda 
but  then again 
maybe you don t 
it turns handwriting
into computer text 
hey  dolph  take a memo on your newton 
 beat up martin  
in 1980  apple
had 30  of the market 
today  apple has only 3 2  
that s it  john sculley
has been fired from apple 
and what
about this internet thing 
do you know anything about that 
uh  it is the big  new thing 
rumors are flying around
apple computer once again 
over who will
take over the helm 
in the news at this hour  a
remarkable high tech reunion 
well  it s happening 
in a billion dollar shake up 
apple is purchasing
next computer s
operating system 
which may mean   
ls the prodigal
son returning  bet on it 
guess what  mac is back 
apple co founder steven jobs   
steve jobs    steve jobs   
steve jobs
is returning to apple 
if you want to beam your digital
photographs from your digital camera 
it s built into every product  we re
going to the new generation of i o 
12 megabyte usb  two ports

the correct time

a great keyboard and the coolest
mouse you ve ever seen

look like today 
and now  i d like to show you what
they re going to look like tomorrow

that was cool 
why did i like that
better than i usually do 
i don t know 
something was different 
hey  stupid 
i think she s talking to one of you guys 
  did you notice a difference 
  that s what i m   
the exit signs were off 
full blackout 
you did it 
we wired all the exit
lights to our board 
they go out with the cue
for seven seconds 
then come back on again 
in theory 
we think that s legal 
no  we re very certain it s not 
you want to see some quotes 
let s hold off on those 
no  he ll like them 
i ll show them to you later 
i ll take them now

wireless camera we stole from panasonic 
i ll show you
what this looks like 
the whole thing is translucent 
you can see into it 
how s that
for a compromise  woz

but you can see into it 
fair enough 
we put stereo speakers in
front  infrared right up here 
cd rom drive in the middle 
nice 
dual stereo headphone jacks 
and all the connectors
are inside
one beautiful little door  here 
ethernet  usb 
even though this is a full blooded
macintosh  we re targeting it
for the number one use the consumers

  which is   
  let s hold it  please 
hold it 
the answer was  the internet  
  joanna 
  yeah 
just stand in front of me 
i want to look at these quotes 
but i don t want joel to know 
they re all great 
 it is not only the coolest looking
computer introduced in years 
 but a chest thumping statement
 that silicon valley s original dream
company is no longer somnambulant  
  it s a word  it means  sleepwalking  
  steve 
i m sorry  we have to clear the house
if we re going to start on time 
we re absolutely starting on time 
we re going to start on time 
here  take this 
everybody  that s it 
they ve got to mop the stage 
reset  and open the house 
i love you guys 
andy  come on back a minute 
  which one 
  hertzfeld 
forbes calls it
an industry altering success 
look here 
why haven t we ever
slept together 
we re not in love  look 
sculley 
look what he said 
 he has implemented
the same simple strategy
 that made apple so
successful 15 years ago 
 make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing  
that was nice of him 
it was 
i meant it 
sightings of j d  salinger are
more common than john sculley 
i wasn t being sarcastic 
it was nice of him 
do you talk to him 
no 
you haven t talked
to him since  88 
i d have told you if i did 
doesn t matter 
i don t want people thinking
they can cross me
and then  boom  15 years
later  i m cool with it 
i was kidding 
what s wrong with you
this morning 
let s get off the stage 
 the only thing apple s providing
now is leadership in colors  
don t worry about it 
what does bill gates
have against me 
i don t know  you re both
out of your minds 
listen to me 
he dropped out of a better
school than i dropped out of 
but he s a tool bag 
i ll tell you why 
make everything
all right with lisa 
  you know  joanna 
  boundaries 
you ve come to my apartment at 1 00 a m 
and cleaned it 
so tell me where
the boundary is 
there  let s say it s there 
if i give you some
real projections 
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage 
what do you mean 
 real projections  
what have you been giving me 
conservative projections 
marketing s been lying to me 
we ve been managing expectations
so that you don t not 
what are the real projections 
we re going to sell a million
units in the first 90 days 
20 000 a month after that 
  holy shit 
  yeah 
you see  you wait
long enough  and   
what s more  32  of the sales
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time 
and 12  are going to people using
some kind of windows machine 
that s what bill gates
has against you 
and it ll be the fastest selling
computer in history 
you brought the company
back from life support
after going through the misery
of laying off 3 000 people
and cutting 70  of
the product line 
so  steven 
it s over 
you re going to win 
it would be criminal
not to enjoy this moment 
i m enjoying it 
make things all right with lisa 
  you know   
  come on 
i don t like having less privacy
than other people have 
does being a multi billionaire
take some of the sting off that 
no 
all lisa did    all lisa
did was give her blessing 
chrisann sold the house and   
and lisa could have done what 
how was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house 
that i bought
for the two of them 
how was she supposed
to stop her 
voicing an objection would have been
a step in the right direction 
you don t think you re having
a bizarre overreaction
to a 19 year old girl allowing her
mother to list her own house 
she could ve tried 
how is she supposed to stop her
mother  that particular mother   
she gave chrisann her
blessing to sell the house 
and she did it to spite me 
i don t care if she put a pipe
bomb in the water heater 
you re going to fix it  now 
she s been acting weird for months 
she s turned on me 
  fix it 
  what the   
  fix it  steve 
  take it easy 
fix it or i quit 
how about that 
i quit and you never see me again 
how about that 
tell me what s wrong
with you this morning 
what s been wrong
with me for 19 years 
i ve been a witness  and i
tell you i ve been complicit 
i love you  steve 
you know how much 
i love that you don t care how
much money a person makes 
you care what they make 
but what you make isn t supposed
to be the best part of you 
when you re a father 
that s what s supposed to be
the best part of you 
and it s caused me two decades of
agony  steve  that it is for you
the worst 
it s a little thing 
it s a very small thing 
fix it 
fix it now  or you can
contact me at my new job 
working anywhere i want 
i don t happen to think
it is a little deal 
  she knew that   
  no 
  i bought the house for the two of 
  no 
what do you mean   no  
i mean  no 
the house has nothing to do
with why you re angry at lisa 
i assure you 
the house has everything
to do with why
i m angry at lisa 
have you ever heard the phrase
 reality distortion field  
yes 
as in   steve s
reality distortion field  
  i ve heard it 
  i ve read it 
it s been sung
to me by joan baez 
what you call
a reality distortion field 
and i m pretty sure you re the
one who coined the phrase 
is the reason we re here 
i know that 
if i traded in my
bank account for a dollar
every time somebody told me
something was impossible 
i d come out ahead 
i know that  too 
what s the problem 
my problem 
it sure isn t the house 
jo  i   
it s that you told her you weren t
going to pay for harvard 
that child  that
earnest  un ironic kid 
she told you i wasn t
paying her tuition 
i should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago 
lisa told you i wasn t
paying her tuition 
andy told me that 
which one 
hertzfeld 
how would hertzfeld know 
he wrote harvard a check for
 25 000 to cover the semester 
are you fucking   
he paid her tuition 
isn t that why you
just asked to see him 
no  i asked to see him
about something   
did you tell her you weren t
going to pay for college 
yes  because   
how could you do that 
because her mother 
who is also her landlord   
hertzfeld  i was ranting 
i was just talking 
you think i would   
i was pissed off because lisa was
trying to piss me off  joanna 
that was her intent 
you obviously scared
the hell out of her 
  hertzfeld wrote a check to harvard 
  pay for   
is she here yet 
i m sure she is 
can you have someone
bring her back 
yes 
thank you 
you know 
my grandmother always
used to say to me   
i don t give a shit  yentl 
i ll have someone get lisa 
thank you 
and if you see hertzfeld   
it s andy 
speak of
the devil s chief engineer 
go  come on in 
you look great today 
  thank you 
  doesn t she 
she looks fantastic 
always does 
get out 
well  i think i know
why i m here 
  do you 
  steve   
did you send the check yet 
yes 
so harvard got a tuition check from
andy hertzfeld to pay for lisa 
i don t think
they look that carefully 
i don t think they d notice the
check didn t come from you 
close one 
this was almost
embarrassing for me 
i understand how    i ll
wire you the money today 
i understand how you feel 
and i do apologize  i do 
but  let me tell you
my thinking 
i can t even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did 
i knew you guys would fix things 
you always do 
but in the meantime 
if the money wasn t there 
she d miss a semester of school 
yeah 
and she d have to
tell her friends why 
and she needed things 
she needed socks 
what 
it s cold in cambridge 
she needed warm socks 
you gave her socks 
well  i gave her money
for socks 
you don t get to deputize
yourself as her interim 
you don t get to override my decisions 
do you understand 
you don t get to act
like you re her father 
somebody had to 
what the fuck did you
just say to me 
i ve known her
since she was six 
i also consider   
chrisann s my friend 
outside of what you and i   
outside of our relationship 
so you re like a family advisor 
i m a family friend 
then you probably know that
lisa s been seeing a therapist 
yeah 
  for many years 
  yeah 
without my knowledge 
that really wasn t my business 
i m fascinated by what you
think is and isn t your business 
lisa s been going to a
therapist  and she likes it 
and would love for you and
chrisann to go with her 
and the reason
you know that is because
you re the one that
recommended the therapist 
well  i know a guy 
no  i mean you re the one who
recommended that she see a therapist 
you know what 
it was a while ago  and i don t
remember how the whole   
you told chrisann that lisa
should see a therapist 
steve  you re stigmatizing 
it s a perfectly norm   
it s not    my thing was 
how can it hurt 
let s find out 
chrisann is my friend 
what was the reason you gave 
you mean   
what was the reason you gave chrisann
why lisa should see a therapist 
i don t remember  we were
talking and i said   
it s pretty much
what i just said 
that it certainly couldn t hurt 
you didn t say that lisa needed
a strong male role model 
i did 
i think it s a miracle
she s not robbing banks
with the symbionese
liberation army 
there is no reason in the
world why she should be nice 
but she is 
so i helped 
because somebody had to 
i ll wire the money
to you this afternoon 
you threatened me
a long time ago 
sorry 
a long time ago 
you threatened me once 
people are attracted
to people with talent 
people without it
find that threatening 
maybe you should see a therapist 
certainly couldn t hurt 
i meant you literally
threatened me 
at flint 
right before the mac launch 
i was recompiling   i was
trying to debug the voice demo 
and you said if i couldn t
find a solution 
you d call me out
in front of the audience 
did it say  hello  
it did 
no need to thank me 
why do you want people
to dislike you 
i don t want people
to dislike me 
i m indifferent to whether
they dislike me 
since it doesn t matter 
i always have 
really 
i ve always liked you a lot 
that s too bad 
knock  em dead 
thank you 
what is remarkable  what s
hard to fathom but true
is that for a given
clock rate  a powerpc chip
is twice as fast
as a pentium ii chip 
in other words 
a 266 megahertz g3 chip
is twice as fast
as a 266 megahertz pentium ii 
or   
a 266 g3 is equal to
about 500 megahertz 
take a look at byte magazine s byte
marks  the gold standard for any   
come in 
i sent someone into the lobby 
they found her and she   
where is she 
she said she d rather
not come back 
why 
that was it 
i m going out there myself 
you can t 
you can t  it ll be a scene
out of hard day s night 
excuse me 
hey  joel 
andy said it was okay
to come back 
  which one 
  andy cunningham 
i can t do this forever 
i need one of them
to change their name 
you call
andy cunningham  andrea  
it doesn t matter
what i call them 
i know who i m talking about
when i m talking 
i need everyone else to
call them different names 
give me one second 
can you go get her
for me  please 
i just talked to andy hertzfeld 
i m just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with drano 
but i do want to talk to lisa 
okay  just   
  stay cool 
  okay 
thank you 
hey  steve 
how are you feeling 
i m feeling good  joel 
how about you 
i don t think i could be in your business 
it changes too quickly 
well  i d hang on 
 cause yours is about to
start changing
pretty quickly  too 
this is the third time in 14
years i m writing about you 
what do you think so far 
excuse me 
uh  avie s looking for you 
he has a new shark 
want to come backstage
for a second 
sure 
who s this one 
alan turing 
single handedly won
world war ii and 
for an encore 
invented the computer 
he won t be part of
the campaign  though 
why not 
because you just had
to ask me who he was 
can i see new shark 
  i like it better than the old shark 
  sharks 
sharks 
how many sharks
did you go through 
  a couple 
  this is the 39th 
we re on the record 
thirty nine sharks 
okay 
you know what s special
about this shark  what 
no  i m really asking 
because it looks exactly
like the other 38 sharks to me 
let me see it with the cue 
from the profile 
this is cue 92 b 
this is a profile here 
and this is what
it looks like from the back 
and one more thing   it eats pentium
notebooks as a light snack 
this is the shark 
i really like it 
nobody gets it right
the first time 
but i should have been shown
this shark 15  20 fish ago 
you probably were 
lock it in 
10 minutes 
he killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple  alan turing 
yeah  there should be
statues of that man 
his name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren 
the rainbow flag apple
with a bite taken out 
that s where it came from 
no  we picked it off a list
of friendly sounding words 
but wouldn t it be great if that
had been the story behind it 
steve 
kinda liked the last shark 
fuck you 
i wanted to ask you a favor 
my friend  a long time ago 
you asked me a favor before a
product launch  and i said no 
  you wanted me to acknowledge 
  hang on 
if you re about to say
you were wrong 
i want to prepare
this journalist 
i was 100  right 
and you were
spectacularly wrong 
but i still owe you a
favor  so name it 
steve 
but it can t be about acknowledging
the apple ii team 
acknowledge the apple ii team 
how about in private 
  no  no 
  is this a prank 
because i m trying to remember
that a 300 megahertz g3 chip   
just the top guys 
steve 
  excuse me  okay 
  yep 
one second 
she said she d rather not 
what do you mean 
she s sitting with her friends 
and she said she d
rather not come back 
okay  tell her   
take her aside  i don t want to
embarrass her
in front of her friends 
but tell her i just scared
the shit out of andy 
and this time  nobody s
paying her fucking   
  all right 
  don t say that 
but do your thing  where
you sound old and wise
because of the broad  tragic
european canvas of your life 
you know i wasn t born in a
19th century shtetl  right 
please tell her it s important 
  everything all right 
  yeah 
there are people
around here  man 
including a member of the press 
i see him 
woz 
just the top guys  the ones
who are getting laid off 
listen  okay  last year  apple
lost one billion dollars 
i don t even know
how that s possible 
you were less than 90 days
from being insolvent 
i had three different accountants
try to explain it to me 
the whole place has
to be streamlined 
start with two of the accountants 
i started with the   
joel  could you come off stage 
we re going to go backstage 
leave him right there 
i started with the apple ii team
because we don t make that anymore 
just acknowledge the top guys 
have a mimosa and relax 
you will not blow me off
right now  steve 
the top guys   
there are no top guys 
all right 
on the apple ii team 
there are no top guys 
they re b players 
and b players discourage
the a players 
and i want a players
at apple  and not dell 
they re not b players  and
i m a better judge of that 
less than 90 days
from insolvency 
in part  because somebody thought
the newton wasn t a box of garbage 
joel  could you come off stage please 
leave him 
i m talking about   
you guys designed and shipped a little
box of garbage while i was gone 
i m talking about the apple ii 
which is not just a crucial
part of this company s history 
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing 
for a time 
the least you can do  if you re
going to downsize these people   
they re going to live in the
biggest houses of anyone
on the unemployment line 
   is to acknowledge them 
acknowledge them and the
apple ii during this launch 
this is a new animal 
this whole place
was built by the apple ii 
you were built by the apple ii 
as a matter of fact 
i was destroyed
by the apple ii
and its open system 
so that hackers and hobbyists could
build ham radios  or something 
and then 
it nearly destroyed apple
when you spent
all your money on it
and developed a grand total
of no new products 
the newton 
the little box of garbage 
you guys came up
with the newton 
you  like 
want people to know that 
this is a product launch 
not a luncheon 
and the last thing i want to
do is connect the imac to   
to the only successful product
that this company has ever made 
i m sorry to be blunt  but
that happens to be the truth 
the lisa was a failure 
the macintosh was a failure 
i don t like talking like this 
but i am tired of being ringo
when i know i was john 
everybody loves ringo 
and i m tired of
being patronized by you 
you think john became john
by winning a raffle  woz 
you think he tricked somebody 
or hit george harrison
over the head 
he was john because he was john 
he was john because he
wrote ticket to ride 
and i wrote the apple ii 
everybody 
i want to clear the auditorium 
nobody moves 
you made a beautiful board
which  by the way 
you were willing to
give out for free 
so don t tell me
how you built apple 
if it weren t for me  you d be the
easiest  a  at homestead high school 
these people live and die by your
praise  so here s your chance 
acknowledge that
something good happened
that you weren t
in the room for 
  no 
  steve 
do it 
it s right  it s   
it s right 
sorry  but no 
then let me put it another way 
i don t think there s a man
who s done more
to advance the
democratization that comes
with personal computing
than i have 
but you ve never had any respect for me 
now why is that 
i d at least consider
the possibility
that it s because you ve
never had any for me 
what the hell is going on here 
nothing 
thank you for your time 
  it s done 
  she s coming back 
you came a half inch from putting
this company out of business 
now  who do i see about that 
i m letting you keep your job 
you get a pass 
you know 
when people used to ask me
what the difference was
between me and steve jobs 
i would say steve
was the big picture guy
and i liked a solid workbench 
when people ask me what the
difference is now  i say
steve s an asshole 
your products are better
than you are  brother 
that s the idea   brother  
and knowing that 
that s the difference 
it s not binary 
you can be decent and gifted
at the same time 
he didn t mean it 
yeah  he did 
he s a temperamental guy 
no  he s not 
it s like  five minutes
before every launch 
everyone goes to a bar 
gets drunk 
and tells me
what they really think 
she s coming
to your dressing room 
i told you to make
things all right with lisa 
i didn t say you had to settle
every blood feud you have 
the last time blood feuds weren t
settled  i lost the cover of time 
though  for the life of me 
i still don t know
what the hell dan kottke
was mad at me about 
kottke didn t lose you
the cover of time 
of course he did 
would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong
when you re certain
you re right 
dan kottke told time magazine
that i was denying   
do you remember the cover 
of time 
  yes 
  yes 
what was it 
what are you talking about 
what was on the cover 
a computer 
no  it was a sculpture
of a computer 
it was a sculpture 
time would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance 
you were never in the
conversation for man of the year 
nobody lost you anything 
so  what else
are you sure about 
i don t know how
i could ve missed that 
reality distortion 
  no  seriously 
  seriously 
don t try to win
an argument with lisa 
just say you were wrong 
come on in  honey 
it s not  honey  
john  get in  get in 
get out of the hall 
i was taken in the side entrance 
i ll go out the same way 
no one will see me 
how are you  joanna 
i m good  john  i m
just surprised to see you 
everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to forbes 
you didn t have to do that 
my pleasure 
if you want  i can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out 
i m just here
to say  good luck   okay 
you just have
a couple of minutes 
would you try to find   
yeah 
you re a good man  john 
so  i brought you a present 
the newton 
if you don t take it out of the
box  you ll be able to sell it 
which is more than i can say 
everything all right there 
  what  no 
  yeah 
just something
joanna pointed out to me 
i missed something
so obvious about   
it doesn t matter 
look  wall street s gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as ceo 
so don t let any fluctuation bother
you for the first 12 months 
day traders are gonna respond 
i don t need to school you 
is this your way of telling me i
shouldn t have killed the newton 
the most efficient animal on
the planet is the condor 
the most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans 
well  you shouldn t
have killed it for spite 
that s bad business 
don t do that 
but a human with a bicycle becomes
the most efficient animal 
and the right computer   
a friendly  easy computer
that isn t an eyesore 
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a tensor lamp 
the right computer will be
a bicycle for the mind 
do you like it 
i was given back 
and what if  instead of it
being in the right hands 
it was in everyone s hands 
everyone in the world 
we d be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since   
ever 
i don t know why you ve always been
interested in my adoption history 
but you said  it s not like someone
looked at me and gave me back 
but that is what happened 
you re telling me
you have the right computer 
it s called macintosh 
a lawyer couple
adopted me first 
then gave me back after a month 
they changed their mind 
then my parents adopted me 
my biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me
had to be college educated 
wealthy  and catholic 
paul and clara jobs
were none of those things 
so my biological mother wouldn t
sign the adoption papers 
what happened 
there was a legal battle
that went on for a while 
my mother said she refused to
love me for the first year 
you know  in case
they had to give me back 
you can t refuse to
love someone  steve 
yeah  it turns out you can 
what the hell can
a one month old do
that s so bad that his
parents give him back 
there s nothing
a one month old can do 
have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father 
i ve met my biological father 
for that matter  so have you 
it s called macintosh 
mr  steve jobs 
jandali 
say hello to john sculley 
jandali owns the place 
and john s the ceo of pepsi 
but i m trying to get him
to move to cupertino 
put a dent in the universe 
you eat vegan as well 
you re kidding me 
no  i ll eat anything 
why don t you start us off with
the mediterranean lettuce
salad with purslane  mint   
my sister found him 
does he know 
no  in fact  he bragged to mona
that steve jobs comes in the
restaurant all the time 
  you don t want to   
  no 
don t you think
you should talk to him 
he d probably find
a reason to sue me 
oh  steve   
john  if you re here
about your legacy 
you need to form
a line behind wozniak 
wozniak s gonna be fine 
i m the guy who fired steve jobs 
 rich  college educated 
and catholic  
steve  it s time 
i ve gotta go 
  did i do this 
  screw it up 
let s let it go now 
it has to be time 
come be our ceo 
yeah  okay 
it was the stylus  john 
what 
i killed the newton
because of the stylus 
if you re holding a stylus 
you can t use the other five
that are attached to your wrist 
things we could have
done together 
god  the things
we could ve done 
i m paying your tuition 
are you crazy  of course
i m paying your tuition 
i must have misunderstood you when you
said you weren t paying my tuition 
you and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do 
she needed the money 
she always needs the money 
she needs a doctor 
she has a sinus infection 
she s had the same
sinus infection since 1988 
i m gonna take care of my mother 
i m sorry if that angers you 
it does anger me 
because you re a kid
and it s not your job
to take care of your mother 
is that how yours died 
guys  um  step away  please 
give them some room 
when your mom is 90 and can t feed
herself  you can take care of her 
but right now  she s 45  perfectly
healthy  and can t feed herself 
you re supposed to work hard at
school and be 19  and that s it 
i ll take care of your mother 
well  keep up the good work 
what the hell do you want from me 
i was sent for 
i bought her
a house for  400 000 
it s worth twice
that much today 
she sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup 
it was her house 
she used that money
to travel through europe 
money which you
make her beg for 
  steve   
  don t even start with that 
going to andy
and asking for the money 
that was so off the charts
over the line   
i did not do that 
andy came to me 
everybody have an opinion
on this 
i m sorry  guys  in 30 seconds 
you re going to be late 
she spends
the money on antiques 
and then sells them for
a fraction of what she paid 
and she does it with money
i gave to her for you 
steve   
you came to me hysterical
when you were 13 
asking if you could
live with me   
i was not hysterical 
   because your mom was
screaming at you every day 
and 13 was the second
time i asked you 
the stress of her life
as a spiritual healer 
i don t believe i said you re a bad guy 
but if i did  i am sorry 
something happened
to you at school 
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take   
i read time 
what 
i have internet access
at school 
i read an old copy of time 
and i asked my mom some questions
about my family history 
that was    time wrote
a mangled piece of journal 
you were never
supposed to read that 
i had two different
harvard statisticians
try to reverse engineer
the equation
that you came up with
to prove that 28 
of american men
could be my father 
honey  i   
you know  my mother might
be a troubled woman 
but what s your excuse 
that s why i m not impressed
with your story  dad 
it s that you knew
what i was going through 
and you didn t do
anything about it 
and that makes you
an unconscionable coward 
and not for nothing  but
 think  is a verb  all right 
making  different  an adverb 
you re asking people
to think differently 
and you can talk about the
bauhaus movement and braun
and  simplicity is sophistication  
and issey miyake uniforms 
and bob dylan lyrics all
you want  but that thing
looks like judy jetson s
easy bake oven 
hey 
oh  gee 
you re gonna start late 
you know what  lisa  stood for 
what 
the computer  the lisa  do
you know what it stood for 
i m sorry i said that about the imac 
it s not what i really think 
behind my back  at the office 
you know what it stood for 
local integrated
system architecture 
i was five 
why couldn t you just lie 
i did 
of course it was named
after you 
 local integrated system architecture 
doesn t even mean anything 
why d you say it wasn t
all those years 
i honestly don t know 
why d you say
you aren t my father 
i m poorly made 
it s after 9 00 
you re gonna be late 
i don t care 
you re writing for the crimson 
what 
the apple chapter of the
harvard alumni association
tells me you re writing
for the crimson 
oh  yeah 
a little bit  essays   
i d like to read one 
sure 
no  i mean now  i d like to
read one of your essays now 
come on 
you ve got to go on stage 
the imac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays 
so the world is waiting for you 
i m really sorry  guys 
good luck 
gonna put music in your pocket 
what 
100 songs 
1 000 songs  500 songs 
somewhere between 500 and 1 000
songs  right in your pocket 
because i can t stand looking at
that inexplicable walkman anymore 
you re carrying around a brick
playing a cassette tape 
we re not savages 
so i m gonna put
1 000 songs in your pocket 
you can do that 
mmm hmm 
you want to watch
from backstage 
okay 
go  cue 1 
you remember that painting
you did on the original mac
