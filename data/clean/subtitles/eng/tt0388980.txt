you re the only man
who can set me right

golf is a game
played by gentlemen

played by gentlemen 
run your own shop  decent wage 
run along  boy 
francis  it s after midnight 
just one more  mother 
mr  hastings 
ah  master francis 
  sir 
we now lack but one essential
to complete the swift
appointment of our round 
your clubs 
  my clubs  sir 
caddies aren t allowed on the course 
if mr  campbell sees me out there   
you let me worry about campbell 
go  get those clubs 
you go  boy 
get those clubs 
hup  hup  hup  hup 
well struck  lad 
  thank you  sir 
what did you shoot 
uh  an 81  sir 
what did you take on 15 
a nine  sir 
so you shot an 81
first time around
on the toughest golf course
in new england 
with a nine 
  well  i    i think i   
i saw you standing there  knowing
caddies aren t supposed to play   
go on 
i    i think i got
a little nervous  sir 
we needed to see how
you handled yourself 
handled myself 
national amateur championship s
here next month 
are you saying that i can   
what do i have to do 
you have to play in the qualifier 
  that s the easy part 
you have to be approved
by the executive committee 
you re a caddie here 
yes  sir 
for ten years 
i recently resigned to preserve
my status as an amateur 
what  no plans
to turn professional 
uh  no  sir  i plan
to have a career in business 
oh  business 
  yes 
what sort of business 
howard  we need   
sorry  carry on 
what s your home club 
i don t see it here 
they have to sponsor you 
my home club 
i m between clubs at the moment 
  look  see here 
you may have qualified
as a player 
but this just isn t the sort
of thing that caddies do 
you re a caddie 
yes  sir  i was 
caddies don t play in the amateur 
it s not for your kind 
members only 
we need to discuss the opening
on the greens committee 
i m sorry 
but there must be a way
for somebody who s not
a member to compete 
not this year 
as if he could afford
the  50 entrance fee 
excuse me  sir   
   if i were to pay the  50 
would i need to belong to a club 
technically  no 
you would still need a club member
in good standing to sponsor you  and   
and    that would be me 
fifty dollars to play golf 
i ll pay back every penny
from my earnings 
is this how i failed you 
is that all you ve learned from me 
no  sir 
but it s just a game 
a game 
a game doesn t give a man what he
needs to make a life  feed his family 
if i win 
great things could happen 
nothing will happen 
they ll use you
for their own amusement 
i can do this  this is
something i m good at 
what if you do 
what will you get for your  50 
i had dreams too  francis 
no matter what you do 
they ll never let you
cross that street 
all i want is a chance 
ok 
ok  we make a bargain 
you promise me if you lose 
no more golf 
you give up this fool s game 
you finish your schooling 
you learn a trade 
and you bring home
an honest wage 
if i don t qualify 
yes  i promise 
it s the english edition 
it s not even in print here yet 
harry vardon 
thank you 
read it  study it 
you ll need a 78 to qualify 
stiffer competition 
these are the best
amateurs in the country 
do you think i m ready 
i don t know  and neither
will you until you re in it 
there s golf  and there s
championship golf 
keep it for me 
i m going to the party 
they said all the players
are invited 
what s it like in there 
i couldn t tell you 
i m not allowed inside 
do me a favor  would you 
hi 
hi  this boy i used to see
before i left for college is after me 
pretend you asked me to dance 
  there you are  you peach 
you know  you can t
avoid me all evening 
i    i said a dance  phillip 
not this one 
i promised this one to   
  francis ouimet 
do i know your family 
  i don t know 
phillip wainwright 
  wainwright 
oh  yes  wainwrights 
good people 
wainwrights

you re a real sport for helping 
it s no trouble 
i had the craziest day 
i take a train from philadelphia 
my bags end up in baltimore 
my tux is in the bags
in baltimore 
i m wearing the houseman s suit 
i think you look just fine

you said you were
going to college 
smith  first semester 
oh 
where are you going 
to college 
oh  uh  um 
i m taking the year off
to consider my options 
i think that s so wise 
perhaps you ll go to europe 
perhaps i will 
 cause i have family in france 
i m sorry  what did you
say your name was again 
francis  ouimet 
oh  look 
there s my brother 
freddie  you must know francis 
  freddie 
caddie boy 
freddie  you re such a kidder 
dad  mother  this is francis ouimet 
how do you do

francis is playing
in the tournament 
yes  yes  i know 
well  you boys chat 
mother and i will be right back 
swell girl  your daughter 
young man  you may
have been invited 
but don t get the idea
that you belong here 
there are only
two types of player 
those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships 
and those who do not 
five or less 
and you make the cut 
eighteen  i can make
five here in my sleep 
that s the one 
congratulations 
that s too bad  caddie boy 
you could caddie for me
in the tournament 
you re available  right 
congratulations  son 
well played 
empire  harry 
the sun never sets on us 
all that rubbish 
consider the glory that was greece
of alexander the great 
now you can t even
find it on a map 
greece
introduced sport to the world 
pure expression
of their superiority 
we ve trodden that same road 
football  cricket  rugby  golf 
all the major championships
remain in british hands 
save one 
what are you proposing 
the u s  open 
you won it before 
i want you to mount
a new campaign
to do to the americans
what alexander
did to the persians 
lay waste to  em 
my papers get exclusive coverage 
bernard here comes along
to chronicle your conquest 
it s our game  man 
win their open and
bring back that trophy 
you pocket
your winnings  of course 
hmm 
wouldn t pay for the crossing  sir 
  all expenses paid 
as part of an exhibition tour 
all sponsors arranged 
does that cover it 
yep  that d do it 
and i hear there s talk
of an honorary
membership at the club 
this would clinch it 
and i daresay his majesty
might want to show his gratitude
to england s greatest sportsman 
harry vardon 
order of the british empire 
has a nice ring to it 
i ll need a partner 
somebody to share the workload with 
my thoughts exactly 
wilfred here is your man 
top amateur in the british isles
