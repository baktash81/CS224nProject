coming into trinity lane
oh
bell dings
stephen
eyes on the road brian
whoa
laughs
brian brian spies
an opening
aha
chuckles
eyes on the staff
hawkings lost it
whoa
no
you lose brian
too slow old man
too slow
oh my goodness right
breathing heavily
brian time for a drink
stephen hello
music playing
oopah
chuckles
what if the secret of the universe
had something to do with sex huh
maybe do your
doctorate on that
the physics of love
stephen i think thats
more your field brian
brian oh not lately
they will boot you out you
know if you dont decide
i know everyone
here whos
brilliant oh dear
scientists
man 1 ah yes
man 2 ah you made it
dont worry we dont
have to stay for long
looks mortifyingly dull
sighs bores
stammering whos that
whos who
oh him oh
hes strange clever
goes to ban the bomb marches
chuckles
wilde jane wilde
chuckles
oh look
theres david david
ill be back in a minute ill be back
in a second  diana diana
hello
hello
science
arts
english chuckles
french and spanish
what about you
what are you
oh cosmologist
im a cosmologist
whats that
its a kind of religion
for intelligent atheists
intelligent atheists
mmmhmm
youre not religious
are you
c of e
church of england
england yeah chuckles
exhales
i suppose someone
has to be
what do cosmologists
worship then
what do we worship
mmm
one single
unifying equation
that explains everything
in the universe
really
yes
whats the equation
that is the question
and a very good question
chuckles
im not quite sure yet
but i intend to find out
jane then why didnt you
stay at oxford
because my finals exams
were such a shambles
that the examiners they
summoned me in for a viva
and they told me that
if i got a second
whats a viva
oh its a sort of mildly
terrifying facetoface thingy
like an interview
an interrogation
and i told them that if they
gave me a secondclass degree
then i would stay with them
and do my research at oxford
but if they gave me the first that
i needed to get into cambridge
then they would never
have to see me again
they gave you the first
they gave me a first
of course
chuckles this party
is officially deceased
come on
i fixed up a ride home
come on jane
sighs jane
well it was lovely
to talk to you
yes
and i hope you find
your equation
yes oh
ah bye
stephen bye
door closes
door opens
stephen
oh
yeah
door closes
well then here we are
a little challenge
for you all
as you embark upon your
separate doctoral journeys
whatever they may be
mr hawking
pass them down
something to separate
the men from the boys
the wheat from the chaff
the mesons from
the pi mesons
the quarks from the quacks
ten questions each more
impregnable than the last
good luck
youll need it
shall we say friday 300
clears throat
this is going
to hospitalize me
and one drive
two drive
grunting
three drive
stay long brian
brian ill give you something long
stay long brian
keep long brian
brian shut up
long brian
brian im exhausted
stay long brian
yells
bell dings
brian flip it
flip it wiggs
brian laughs
ellis somebody else
for once
can i get two more of those please
bartender yeah sure
and some change for the payphone
yeah
steve you all right mate
diana jane
no of course timothy turned
out to be an absolute cad
i mean youll never guess who
i saw him with the other day
caroline
laughs for heavens sake she
can have him quite frankly
whats the probability
reasonably low
chuckles
um this is
this is stephen
do you play croquet
jane croquet
not recently
sunday morning
jane actually busy
sunday mornings
oh
him
okay
diana laughing anyway before
i was completely interrupted
oh come on get up
how many did you get
morning brian
good afternoon stephen
how many of the impossible
questions did you do
brian i have no idea
what youre talking about
how many of sciamas questions
did you get stephen
none
you didnt get any
i was going to
do them later
you havent even
looked at them
no
stephen are you aware that you
have voluntarily embarked upon
a phd in physics at the most
prestigious college in england
yes
oh
i thought maybe youd slept through
the induction or something
bri
what
can you whip on
some wagner
oh sod off
opera music playing
indistinct talking
sighs
groans
knock on door
come in stephen
sorry
um michael
thats so illegible
i cant quite decipher how wrong it is
i suspect enormously
and brian
thats just baffling
have you even
bothered stephen
oh sorry uh
sciama right
train timetables
stephen ah
chuckles
thats uh
totally unacceptable
these expired
a month ago
chuckles its on the back
i had a little accident
ah
i could only do nine
sciama good lord
oh thank god bravo
mouthing nine
sciama come in
ah stephen
take a seat
door closes
i wanted to talk to you
about your subject
were all rather concerned
as to what its going to be
i cant decide
do you have any ideas
no
so this is where jj thomson
discovered the electron
and where rutherford
split the atom
you know one of the great rewards
of this job is one never knows
from where the next
great leap forward
is going to come
or from whom
listen next friday im taking a
few graduates of merit to london
to attend a talk by the
mathematician roger penrose
do come along
if youre interested
oh and close the door
as you leave
door opens
door closes
indistinct talking
so i gather youve
never been to church
once upon a time
tempted to convert
i have a slight problem with the
whole celestial dictator premise
now what are you
doing for lunch
ma makes a cracking roast
ah so jane what are you studying
clears throat
arts
spuds
thank you
um french and spanish
im hoping to do
a phd eventually
oh what on
medieval poetry of
the iberian peninsula
frank medieval poets
what painters do you like
well i like turner
chuckles mmm
turner really
you know i always feel
that his paintings
look as if theyve been
left out in the rain
oh
stephen pa
philippa laughs
and william blake
frank thank you mother
oh good heavens surely not
frank jane have some of my
elderflower wine cork pops
oh yes thank you
stephen dont touch it
dont touch it jane
thank you mother
stephen doesnt like
my homemade wine
philistine
im going to send you back
with a couple of bottles  chuckles
so stephen you have come
from church with a good woman
are you feeling holier
than thou
positively saintly
thank you
chuckles  you havent said
why you dont believe in god
a physicist cant allow his
calculations to be muddled
by a belief in
a supernatural creator
sounds less of an argument against
god than against physicists
philippa laughs
light or dark
jane light meat or dark
oh light please
im inviting jane to be my
partner to the may ball
frank really ah
philippa
very impressive
mouthing  isobel youll have
to dance this year stephen
philippa chuckles
frank make way for mothers leg
here we go
hello
hello
music playing
ooh sorry
chuckles
you okay
yeah
do you dance stephen
no
both laugh
no i dont dance
its a phenomenon
im very happy to observe
but i cant possibly
imagine participating
i absolutely agree
i mean who would want to dance
chuckles
no im serious
i dont dance
no dancing then
you see how the mens
shirtfronts and their bow ties
how they glow more
than the womens dresses
jane yes
do you know why
chuckles why
tide
the washing powder
the fluorescence in the washing
powder is caught by the uv light
why do you know that
chuckles
when stars are born
and when they die
they emit uv radiation
so if we could see the night
sky in the ultraviolet light
then almost all the stars
would disappear
and all that we would see
are these spectacular
births and deaths
i reckon it would
look a little
like that
all cheering
whooping
wow
oh did you see
laughing
like those
like those ones
all cheering
band playing
why
why what
why spanish medieval poetry
i suppose i like
to timetravel
like you
are there any particular time
periods that you like to visit
i imagine the twenties
was fun
the roaring twenties
mmm
seek then
no learning
from starry men
who follow with
the optic glass
the whirling ways
of stars that pass
chuckles
bravo
chuckles
band playing
well thats astonishing
isnt it
jane sighs
in the beginning was the
heaven and the earth
and the earth was
without form
and darkness
was upon the face
of the deep
will you dance with me
band playing
man over pa the train now
departing from platform three is
the nineseventeen service
to london kings cross
train horn hooting
come on stephen
get a move on
whats wrong with
you man chopchop
train horn hooting
a star more than three
times the size of our sun
ought to end its life how
with a collapse
the gravitational forces
of the entire mass
overcoming the electromagnetic
forces of individual atoms
and so collapsing inwards
if the star is
massive enough
it will continue
this collapse
creating a black hole
where the warping of spacetime is
so great that nothing can escape
not even light
it gets smaller
smaller
the star in fact
gets denser
as atoms
even subatomic particles
get literally crushed into
smaller and smaller space
and at its end point
what are we left with
a spacetime singularity
space and time
come to a stop
indistinct talking
i wonder what would happen if you applied
penroses theory about black holes
to the entire universe
if einstein is right or if
general relativity is correct
then the universe
is expanding yes
yes
okay
so if you reverse time then the
universe is getting smaller
all right
so what if i reverse the
process all the way back
to see what happened at the
beginning of time itself
at the beginning of time itself
yes
so the universe getting
smaller and smaller
getting denser and denser
hotter and hotter as we
you mean wind back
the clock
exactly
wind back the clock
wind back the clock
chuckles
is that what youre doing
chuckling
are you winding back the clock
that is what im doing
stephen well keep winding
and youve got quite a long way to go
keep winding
jane i dont want to fall in
youve got to get back
to the beginning of time
youve got a long way to go
keep winding
keep winding
until you get
a singularity
a spacetime singularity
so the universe born
from a black hole exploding
keep going
what do you mean keep going
before the universe began
no no no no keep going
develop the mathematics
flatlining
inaudible
cot squeaking
doctor okay all right
very good
push it as hard
as you can push it
push it
as hard as you can
stephen i am pushing
as hard as i can
why come on
one two
why wont it
all right all right
fourth finger
fourth peg
doctor its called
motor neuron disease
its a progressive
neurological disorder
that destroys
the cells in the brain
that control essential
muscle activity
such as speaking
walking
inhales deeply
breathing swallowing
the signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted
the result is
gradual muscle decay
wasting away
eventually the ability to control
voluntary movement is lost
entirely
im afraid average life
expectancy is two years
theres nothing
i can do for you
what about the brain
the brain isnt affected
your thoughts wont change
its just that
well eventually no one
will know what they are
im ever so sorry
bell tolling
man hello brian
opera music playing
knock on door
music turns off
welcome to this weeks episode
of the natural world
where this week we explore the
bizarre hibernation patterns
of the rare
cambridge physicist
seen here in
his remarkable plumage
so how was it what did they say
hows your wrist
i have a disease bri
is it venereal stephen
chuckles
i have motor neuron disease
stutters
sorry i dont
its lou gehrigs disease
he was a baseball player
sorry im lagging behind in
my pioneering research into
obscure motor baseballrelated
diseases chuckles
i have two years to live
sorry
it does sound odd when you
say it out loud doesnt it
you what do you mean
no you dont
stammering
what did they say
sorry i dont really um
will you go bri
stephen sorry
i was just being a berk
stammering
no its not
footsteps approaching
will you go
knocking on door
stephen phone for you
its a girl
um
ill ill um
ill see you soon
ill
yes
shes waiting
dial tone
stephen
indistinct conversations
nobodys seen him
for a while
i suppose you know
jane jane
brian hello
sorry um
why dont you
why dont you sit down
im so sorry
i spoke to stephen
uh yesterday
and i know that
you called him
continues talking
tv playing
something educational
very
john is having an affair with martha
but
martha is in love
with alan
and i think that alan is probably a
homosexual by the look of his jumper
so
well im just trying to work out the
mathematical probability of happiness
are you close
some integer of zero but no
not quite there yet
stephen
you just missed him
he was here earlier
jane dont do this
go
croquet
play a game with me
go
if you dont get up
and play a game with me
i wont come back
here again
ever
come on
jane sobbing
leave me now
are you going to talk
about this or not
will you just go
is that what you want
yes it is what i want
so please if you care about
me at all then please just go
i cant
i have two years to live
i need to work
i love you
stuttering
thats a false conclusion
i want us to be together
for as long as weve got
and if thats not very long well
then thats just how it is
itll have to do
you dont know whats coming
itll affect everything
exhales
your glasses
are always dirty
chuckles
there
thats better isnt it
yes
yes it is
sciama now the solutions
to the schrödinger equation
must vanish at the boundary
of the box and so we have
time
oh time
thats your subject
any aspect in particular
time
come in come in
chuckling
clears throat
clears throat i
i dont think you realize
what lies ahead jane
his life is going
to be very short
so be careful
the weight of science
is against you
and this will not be
a fight jane
this is going to be
a very heavy defeat
for all of us
i know what you all think
that
that i dont look like
a terribly strong person
but i love him
and he loves me
were going to fight
this illness together
all of us
inaudible
inaudible
grunting
breathing heavily
two three
both grunting
good luck
chuckles
morning stephen
morning professor
sciama i know i know
thorne it could be
a little bit more elegant
sciama yes but i
knocking
come in stephen
indistinct talking
sciama i know its something we
were all worried about initially
but i i knew roger
you had some reservations
about it in the early days
yes but its not uncommon
in any theory
yes
absolutely very well
very well well see
sciama welcome stephen
morning
would you like
to take a seat
no im fine thank you
sciama youre sure
yeah
so stephen
in summary um
as we know chapter one
full of holes uh
lacks mathematical support
professor thorne
chapter two not really original
uses a lot of rogers ideas
well at least
you run with them
uh chapter three too many
unanswered questions
sciama i agree
and then of course
we have chapter four
this black hole at
the beginning of time
spacetime singularity
indeed
its brilliant
brilliant stephen
superb
therefore all there is
to say is well done
or perhaps i should say
to be more precise
well done doctor
penrose
bravo stephen
sciama an extraordinary theory
chuckles
chuckles
thank you
so what next
prove it
to prove with
a single equation
that time has a beginning
wouldnt that be nice
professor
the one simple
elegant equation
to explain everything
yes it would
it would indeed
thank you
jane to the esteemed
and formidable
doctor
who
all laughing
doctor stephen hawking
all doctor stephen hawking
thank you
it is astonishing hes the first
person to receive his doctorate
bearing in mind how little
work hes been doing
all laughing
brian work was the worst
fourletter word for stephen
at oxford especially
he averaged an hour
an hour a day
he averaged
and now here he is
the esteemed man
astonishing levels of sloth
carter ive got
on the theme of sloth brian
how many of your lectures have i
covered in the last six months
when youve been doing research
trips up to the lake district
brian absolutely completely
ellis so have i
carter how many
brian four
indistinct talking
everything all right
all good chuckles
im fine
all laughing
laughing
what can you do
would you like kartoffel
oh please
chuckles
breathing heavily
ellis business or pleasure
jane ah for pleasure
all laughing
grunting

jane
jane ive had an idea
hello
hello dennis
hello dennis
how are you
okay good luck
sciama hell be fine
hell be fine
oops sorry
no problem
door closes
allowing us to predict
that some particles can
in fact escape a black hole
so black holes are not
in fact black at all
but glow
with heat radiation
the steady emission
of heat energy
causes the black holes
to lose mass
and eventually they disappear
in a spectacular explosion
its very very simple in the
way that a body loses heat
second law of thermodynamics
brian right its thermodynamics
stuttering
if we can imagine
that a black hole
is indeed
losing particles
and over time will diminish in
size it will evaporate it will
disappear
so
first
a star vanishes
into a black hole
and then
the black hole itself
vanishes
gone nothing
from nothing to nothing
you owe me another beer
i have just shown you
that our friend has proven
that time indeed
has a beginning
not only that how the
universe was born
and
how it will end
bang
crunch
its uh beautiful
its racy its
complete nonsense
its preposterous
was it something i said
professor
uh excuse me
door slams
my name is professor khalatnikov
from the soviet
academy of science
as you know
my field is evolution
of the hot universe
the properties of the microwave
background radiation
and the theory
of black holes
to be honest
i came here today
expecting to hear
a lot of nonsense
i go home disappointed
the little one here
has done it
murmuring
he has done it
all applauding
it is a pleasure
to meet you professor
entirely my pleasure
my pleasure
stephen thank you
professor well done stephen
stephen well that went pretty
well all things considered
sciama i was
worried for a while
laughing
hawking radiation
the little one has done it
laughing
the little one has done it
indistinct yelling
hey come on genius

right
keep them closed
chuckling
jane tada
chuckling
look daddy look
jane that is
an electric wheelchair
if you dont like it
we can take it back
sciama i dont understand
youve spent years
assuming black holes exist
and you believe
cygnus x1 could
well turn out to be
the first black hole
that we can actually observe
and yet youve bet kip thorne
its not a black hole
yes
what did you
bet him
a oneyear subscription
to a magazine
which magazine nature
no
penthouse

stephen
i need help
if only for robert

were not a normal family
were not a normal family
robert
your mother is
very angry with me
sighing
thanks
sighing
jane
jane stop
breathing heavily
sit
liquid pouring
now
liquid pouring
id like to make
a suggestion
might sound a bit unusual but
i have seen it work wonders
i think
that you should consider
joining the church choir
chuckling
mum
i think thats possibly the most
english thing anyone has ever said
maybe so
i used to love singing
youre very good at it
i dont know about that
just go
its one hour a week
mmmhmm
mmm
singing in latin
really lovely everyone
okay see you next week
byebye
bye
goodbye
hello
hello
have you come to sing
um
i just came to um
chuckling soprano
mezzo
ah
lovely just what we need
where have you been hiding
good question
well youre here now
and uh just in time
as they say
oh uh you know i have to
come back anyway so  good
you have everything
yes thank you yes
thank you for coming
you will be
a valuable asset
thank you chuckling
chuckling
um
well i should be going
um and if your son wants
those piano lessons just
yes yes absolutely i um
call me
i will do
great
my husband
adores music too
oh well i could
does he play
um
i could teach him
as well um
thats a long story
but um
ah okay
well thank you jonathan
my pleasure jane see you again
byebye
byebye
piano playing
third finger no that
that one there
try lifting your wrists a little bit
keep your elbows back
okay try again
robert no
chuckling good
chuckling yeah
jane more wine
um why not
thank you
stephen
no
jonathan clearing throat
stephen jane was telling me that
you have a beautiful uh theorem
um
that proves that
the universe um
had a beginning
is that it
that was my phd thesis
my new project
disproves it
uh disproves it oh
yes
um so then you no longer
believe in the creation
what one believes
is irrelevant in physics
irrelevant in physics
oh clearing throat
i see
stephens done a uturn
the big new idea is that the
universe has no boundaries at all
no boundaries
no beginning
and no god oh
oh i see i chuckles
i thought that um
youd proved the universe had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator
chuckles my mistake
no mine
stephen is looking
for a single theory
that explains all the
forces in the universe
therefore god must die
oh uh why must god die
i dont see
the two great pillars
of physics
are quantum theory
the laws that govern the very small
particles electrons and so on
and general relativity
ah yes einstein
einsteins theory
the laws that govern
the very large planets
and such
but quantum and relativity
dont tell me
theyre different
they dont remotely
play by the same rules
if the world were all
potatoes then easy
you could trace
a precise beginning
as stephen once did
a moment of creation
hallelujah god lives
if you incorporate peas
into the menu
well then it all
goes a little
tits up
oh chuckling
yes haywire
it just all becomes a godless mess
oh dear
chuckling
einstein hated peas
quantum theory he said god doesnt
play dice with the universe
stephen seems
he not only plays dice
but he throws them
where we cant find them
god is back on the endangered species list
jonathan chuckling
well i expect hell cope
and physics
is back in business
jane yes
physics is back in business
i was uh married
actually
um but sadly
she passed
almost a year ago now
exhaling
it was uh leukemia
um she fought it
and i nursed her
but uh in the end
um
sighing
i do get quite lonely
the uh inhaling deeply
tyranny of the empty room
and all that
but music is my salvation
teaching and playing
not really as a career
but im not very ambitious
though thats not
sighing
is that a sin
i dont know
wrong man to ask
thank you so much
for having me
thank you for coming
it was really really wonderful
if theres anything
i can do to be of service
um to you
to the family
i mean i would
consider it a privilege
i have no children
or commitments so
i only mean that
if i could be of help
i believe i might
find a purpose that would
help alleviate my own
um situation chuckles
good night
night
i understand
if you need help
if someone is prepared
to offer it
i wont object
laughing
chilly chuckling
chuckling
yeah its very bracing
chuckles
come on ready
yeah
grunting all right
17 18
there we go right im
going to put the kettle on
piano playing
singing calls you one
and calls you all
to gain his everlasting hall
christ was born to save
jonathan great lovely okay
we can go
just gone 745
chuckles um could you all
leave your copies  goodbye
theres something
i need to tell you
what
im pregnant
chuckles
gosh i um assumed
that you and stephen um
well thats
really wonderful
it is
yes wonderful
chuckles
congratulations jane
thank you
everyone say cheese
ready
on the count of three
one two three
all cheese
cheese
jane gasping is that your brother
on his bike
lucy mummy
just coming
oh come on sweetie
come on
now you know
clearing throat
ive always been supportive of
your choice not to have home help
but we need to find
a permanent solution
this uh situation
cannot continue
you need to have a proper
livein nurse immediately
we have help
look you know
what im talking about
we cant afford
a livein nurse
stephen you need
to find a way
for your familys sake
youre worldfamous
for black holes
not for rock concerts

equipment beeping
jane speaking french
what are you talking about
this way would be
a painless end
if we try to bring him round
from the anesthetic
its not sure
he will survive resuscitation
you have to bring him round
from the anesthetic
are you sure
its what you want
the only way of weaning him
off the ventilator
will be to give him
a tracheotomy
a hole in the neck
bypassing the throat
he will never speak again
theres no question
stephen must live
i will see he gets
everything he needs
i will have him transferred
back to cambridge
he may not survive

youre very lucky
thank you
you must worship
the ground beneath
his wheels
and hes
the perfect patient
hes so funny
when you read about him
lets see how you get on
shall we elaine
technician thats
tightened up
as you can see
its heightadjustable
and we can change the angle
to whatever steve wants it at
you know its cuttingedge
jane so
how does it work
it uses
a very simple interface
that scans
through the alphabet
selects each letter
one at a time
i mean using this technique
the professor can expect
to write about
four words per minute
good better than
one a minute
laughs yes
and what ive done
is taken the components from a
telephone answering system actually
to convert
the written text
into synthesized speech
i mean the voice sounds
a little bit robotic
but um shall we give it a try
great
heres the clicker
jane right hand
technician there you go
clears throat
welcome to the future
stephen speaking
through mechanized voice
its american
is that a problem
oh my goodness well
is there another voice
thats the only one
they have at the moment
i think its great
laughs

stephen speaking
frankly my dear
i dont give a damn
laughing
exterminate
exterminate
exterminate
i will write a book
about what
clicking
time
stephen speaking
what is the nature of time
will it ever come to an end
speaking
someday these answers
may seem as obvious to us
as the earth
orbiting the sun
or perhaps as ridiculous
as a tower of tortoises
only time
whatever that may be
will tell
professor
clicking quickly
it is for a friend
of course it is
thats what they all say
you dont have to be embarrassed
in front of me professor
i know what men are like
shall we take a look
there you go
clears throat
door opens
oh im sorry

stephen so i said i have long been
looking for a model of the universe
i finally found her
laughing
i bet you did
laughing
stephen i need to steal you
the contracts arrived
could you just give us
a minute please jane
there we go
like new
elaine chuckles
who are we
why are we here
if we ever learn this
it will be the ultimate
triumph of human reason
for then we would know
the mind of god
do you mean this
yes
of course
so youre acknowledging him
however
however what
are you actually going to
let me have this moment
you are welcome
i have asked elaine to travel
with me to america

yes
you always used to tell me
when an invitation came in
another award

they said two
youve had so many
sobs
everything will be okay
i have loved you
whispers i did my best
sobs
careful
that thats staying
all right
indistinct chattering
bye jonathan
breathing heavily
piano music starts
reporters clamoring
woman professor
i love your book
audience applauding
thank you
i first met the professor
in 1963
now there you are time
where does it go
it has been
one of the great joys
of my life to watch this man
defy every expectation
both scientific and personal
please welcome onto the stage
my esteemed colleague
my dear friend
professor hawking
audience applauding
thank you
could we please have
the first preselected
question thank you
can you hear me
audience laughing
now you are
recognized everywhere
how do you deal
with all the attention
i was stopped recently
by a tourist in cambridge
who asked if i was
the real stephen hawking
i replied i was not and said the
real one was much better looking
in 1979 you talked
about the possibility
of a theory of everything being
discovered before the end of the century
i now predict
that i was wrong
professor hawking
you have said you do not
believe in god
do you have a philosophy of life
that helps you fades off
you have said
you do not believe in god
do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you
it is clear that we are just
an advanced breed of primates
on a minor planet orbiting
around a very average star
in the outer suburb of one
among 100 billion galaxies
but
ever since
the dawn of civilization
people have craved
for an understanding
of the underlying order
of the world
there ought to be
something very special
about the boundary conditions
of the universe
and what can be more special than
that there is no boundary
and there should be no
boundary to human endeavor
we are all different
however bad life may seem
there is always something
you can do and succeed at
while there is life
there is hope
audience applauding
that came
its from stephen
gosh
your glasses
are always dirty
equerry professor and mrs
hawking her majesty the queen
congratulations
my companion of honour
not bad
for an old liberal socialist
whispers dont worry you
can decline the knighthood
thank you for today
it was extraordinary
