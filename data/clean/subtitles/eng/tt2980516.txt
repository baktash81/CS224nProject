oh 
 bell dings 
stephen 
eyes on the road  brian 
whoa 
 laughs 
brian  brian spies
an opening 
a ha 
 chuckles 
eyes on the staff 
hawking s lost it 
whoa 
no 
you lose  brian 
too slow  old man 
too slow 
oh  my goodness  right 
 breathing heavily 
brian  time for a drink 
stephen  hello 
 music playing 
oo pah 
 chuckles 
what if the secret of the universe
had something to do with sex  huh 
maybe do your
doctorate on that 
the physics of love 
stephen  i think that s
more your field  brian 
brian  oh  not lately 
they will boot you out  you
know  if you don t decide 
i know everyone
here who s   
brilliant  oh  dear 
scientists 
man 1  ah  yes 
man 2  ah  you made it 
don t worry  we don t
have to stay for long 
looks mortifyingly dull 
   sighs  bores 
   stammering  who s that

 chuckles 
  wilde  jane wilde 
   chuckles 
oh  look 
there s david  david 
  i ll be back in a minute  i ll be back
in a second    diana  diana 
  hello 
  hello 
  science 
  arts 
  english   chuckles 
  french and spanish 
what about you 
what are you   
oh  cosmologist 
i m a cosmologist 
what s that 
it s a kind of religion
for intelligent atheists 
  intelligent atheists 
  mmm hmm 
you re not religious 
are you 
c of e 
  church of england 
  england  yeah   chuckles 
 exhales 
i suppose someone
has to be 
what do cosmologists
worship  then 
  what do we worship 
  mmm 
one single
unifying equation
that explains everything
in the universe 
  really 
  yes 
what s the equation 
that is the question 
and a very good question 
 chuckles 
i m not quite sure yet 
but i intend to find out 
jane  then why didn t you
stay at oxford 
because my finals exams
were such a shambles 
that the examiners  they
summoned me in for a viva 
and they told me that
if i got a second   
what s a viva 
oh  it s a sort of mildly
terrifying face to face thingy 
  like an interview 
  an interrogation 
and i told them that if they
gave me a second class degree 
then i would stay with them
and do my research at oxford 
but if they gave me the first that
i needed to get into cambridge 
then they would never
have to see me again 
they gave you the first 
  they gave me a first 
  of course 
 chuckles  this party
is officially deceased 
come on 
i fixed up a ride home 
come on  jane 
 sighs  jane 
well  it was lovely
to talk to you 
yes 
and i hope you find
your equation 
yes  oh 
ah  bye 
stephen  bye 
 door closes 
 door opens 
  stephen 
  oh 
yeah 
 door closes 
well  then  here we are 
a little challenge
for you all 
as you embark upon your
separate doctoral journeys 
whatever they may be 
mr  hawking 
pass them down 
something to separate
the men from the boys 
the wheat from the chaff 
the mesons from
the pi mesons 
the quarks from the quacks 
ten questions  each more
impregnable than the last 
good luck 
you ll need it 
  shall we say friday  3 00 
   clears throat 
this is going
to hospitalize me 
and  one  drive 
  two  drive 
   grunting 
three  drive 
  stay long  brian 
  brian  i ll give you something long 
stay long  brian 
keep long  brian 
brian  shut up 
  long  brian 
  brian  i m exhausted 
  stay long  brian 
   yells 
 bell dings 
brian  flip it 
flip it  wiggs 
 brian laughs 
ellis  somebody else 
for once 
  can i get two more of those  please 
  bartender  yeah  sure 
  and some change for the payphone 
  yeah 
steve  you all right  mate 
diana  jane 
no  of course  timothy turned
out to be an absolute cad 
i mean  you ll never guess who
i saw him with the other day 
caroline 
 laughs  for heaven s sake  she
can have him  quite frankly 
what s the probability 
  reasonably low 
   chuckles 
um    this is   
this is stephen 
  do you play croquet 
  jane  croquet 
not recently 
sunday morning 
jane  actually busy
sunday mornings 
oh 
him 
okay 
diana   laughing  anyway  before
i was completely interrupted   
oh  come on  get up 
how many did you get 
morning  brian 
good afternoon  stephen 
how many of the impossible
questions did you do 
brian  i have no idea
what you re talking about 
how many of sciama s questions
did you get  stephen 
  none 
  you didn t get any 
i was going to
do them later 
you haven t even
looked at them 
no 
stephen  are you aware that you
have voluntarily embarked upon
a phd in physics  at the most
prestigious college in england 
  yes 
  oh 
i thought maybe you d slept through
the induction or something 
bri 
what 
can you whip on
some wagner 
oh  sod off 
 opera music playing 
 indistinct talking 
 sighs 
 groans 
 knock on door 
  come in  stephen 
  sorry 
um  michael 
that s so illegible 
i can t quite decipher how wrong it is 
i suspect enormously 
and  brian 
that s just baffling 
have you even
bothered  stephen 
oh  sorry  uh   
sciama  right 
train timetables 
  stephen  ah 
   chuckles 
that s  uh 
totally unacceptable 
these expired
a month ago 
 chuckles  it s on the back 
i had a little accident 
ah 
i could only do nine 
sciama  good lord 
oh  thank god  bravo 
 mouthing  nine 
sciama  come in 
ah  stephen 
take a seat 
 door closes 
i wanted to talk to you
about your subject 
we re all rather concerned
as to what it s going to be 
i can t decide 
do you have any ideas 
no 
so  this is where j j  thomson
discovered the electron 
and where rutherford
split the atom 
you know  one of the great rewards
of this job is one never knows
from where the next
great leap forward
is going to come 
or from whom 
listen  next friday  i m taking a
few graduates of merit to london
to attend a talk by the
mathematician roger penrose 
do come along 
if you re interested 
oh  and close the door
as you leave 
 door opens 
 door closes 
 indistinct talking 
so  i gather you ve
never been to church 
once upon a time 
tempted to convert 
i have a slight problem with the
whole  celestial dictator  premise 
now  what are you
doing for lunch 
ma makes a cracking roast 
ah  so  jane  what are you studying 
 clears throat 
  arts 
  spuds 
thank you 
um  french and spanish 
i m hoping to do
a phd eventually 
oh  what on 
medieval poetry of
the iberian peninsula 
frank  medieval poets 
what painters do you like 
well  i like turner 
   chuckles  mmm 
  turner  really 
you know  i always feel
that his paintings
look as if they ve been
left out in the rain 
  oh 
  stephen  pa 
   philippa laughs 
  and william blake 
  frank  thank you  mother 
  oh  good heavens  surely not 
frank  jane  have some of my
elderflower wine   cork pops 
  oh  yes  thank you 
  stephen  don t touch it 
  don t touch it  jane 
  thank you  mother 
stephen doesn t like
my home made wine 
philistine 
  i m going to send you back
with a couple of bottles     chuckles 
so  stephen  you have come
from church with a good woman 
are you feeling holier
than thou 
positively saintly 
thank you 
   chuckles    you haven t said
why you don t believe in god 
a physicist can t allow his
calculations to be muddled
by a belief in
a supernatural creator 
sounds less of an argument against
god than against physicists 
   philippa laughs 
  light or dark 
  jane  light meat or dark 
  oh  light  please 
i m inviting jane to be my
partner to the may ball 
frank  really  ah 
philippa 
very impressive 
   mouthing    isobel  you ll have
to dance this year  stephen 
 philippa chuckles 
frank  make way for mother s leg 
here we go 
hello 
hello 
 music playing 
  ooh  sorry 
   chuckles 
  you okay 
  yeah 
  do you dance  stephen 
  no 
 both laugh 
no  i don t dance 
it s a phenomenon
i m very happy to observe 
but i can t possibly
imagine participating 
i absolutely agree 
i mean  who would want to dance 
 chuckles 
no  i m serious 
i don t dance 
no dancing  then 
you see how the men s
shirtfronts and their bow ties 
how they glow more
than the women s dresses 
jane  yes 
  do you know why 
   chuckles  why 
tide 
the washing powder 
the fluorescence in the washing
powder is caught by the uv light 
  why do you know that 
   chuckles 
when stars are born 
and when they die 
they emit uv radiation 
so if we could see the night
sky in the ultraviolet light 
then almost all the stars
would disappear
and all that we would see
are these spectacular
births and deaths 
i reckon it would
look a little   
like that 
 all cheering 
 whooping 
wow 
oh  did you see 
 laughing 
like those 
like those ones   
 all cheering 
 band playing 
why 
why what 
why spanish medieval poetry 
i suppose i like
to time travel 
like you 
are there any particular time
periods that you like to visit 
i imagine the twenties
was fun 
  the roaring twenties 
  mmm 
 seek  then 
 no learning
from starry men 
 who follow with
the optic glass
 the whirling ways
of stars that pass 
 chuckles 
bravo 
 chuckles 
 band playing 
well  that s astonishing 
isn t it 
 jane sighs 
 in the beginning was the
heaven and the earth 
 and the earth was
without form 
 and darkness
 was upon the face
of the deep  
will you dance with me 
 band playing 
man   over pa  the train now
departing from platform three is
the nine seventeen service
to london king s cross 
 train horn hooting 
come on  stephen 
get a move on 
what s wrong with
you  man  chop chop 
 train horn hooting 
a star  more than three
times the size of our sun 
ought to end its life how 
with a collapse 
the gravitational forces
of the entire mass
overcoming the electromagnetic
forces of individual atoms 
and so collapsing inwards 
if the star is
massive enough 
it will continue
this collapse 
creating a black hole 
where the warping of space time is
so great that nothing can escape 
not even light 
it gets smaller 
smaller 
the star  in fact 
gets denser 
as atoms 
even subatomic particles 
get literally crushed into
smaller and smaller space 
and at its end point 
what are we left with 
a space time singularity 
space and time
come to a stop 
 indistinct talking 
i wonder what would happen if you applied
penrose s theory about black holes
to the entire universe 
if einstein is right  or if
general relativity is correct 
then the universe
is expanding  yes 
  yes 
  okay 
so  if you reverse time  then the
universe is getting smaller 
all right 
so  what if i reverse the
process all the way back 
to see what happened at the
beginning of time itself 
  at the beginning of time itself 
  yes 
so the universe  getting
smaller and smaller 
getting denser and denser 
hotter and hotter as we   
you mean wind back
the clock 
exactly 
wind back the clock 
wind back the clock 
 chuckles 
  is that what you re doing 
   chuckling 
  are you winding back the clock 
  that is what i m doing 
stephen  well  keep winding 
and you ve got quite a long way to go 
keep winding 
jane  i don t want to fall in 
you ve got to get back
to the beginning of time 
you ve got a long way to go 
keep winding 
keep winding
until you get   
  a singularity 
  a space time singularity 
so  the universe born
from a black hole exploding 
  keep going 
  what do you mean   keep going  
before the universe began 
no  no  no  no  keep going 
develop the mathematics 
 flatlining 
 inaudible 
 cot squeaking 
doctor  okay  all right 
very good 
push it as hard
as you can  push it 
push it 
as hard as you can 
stephen  i am pushing
as hard as i can 
why    come on 
one  two   
why won t it   
all right  all right 
fourth finger 
fourth peg 
doctor  it s called
motor neuron disease 
it s a progressive
neurological disorder
that destroys
the cells in the brain
that control essential
muscle activity 
such as speaking 
walking   
 inhales deeply 
   breathing  swallowing 
the signals that muscles must receive
in order to move are disrupted 
the result is
gradual muscle decay 
wasting away 
eventually  the ability to control
voluntary movement is lost 
entirely 
i m afraid average life
expectancy is two years 
there s nothing
i can do for you 
what about the brain 
the brain isn t affected 
your thoughts won t change 
it s just that   
well  eventually  no one
will know what they are 
i m ever so sorry 
 bell tolling 
man  hello  brian 
 opera music playing 
 knock on door 
 music turns off 
welcome to this week s episode
of the natural world 
where this week we explore the
bizarre hibernation patterns
of the rare
cambridge physicist
seen here in
his remarkable plumage 
so how was it  what did they say 
how s your wrist 
i have a disease  bri 
is it venereal  stephen 
 chuckles 
i have motor neuron disease 
 stutters 
sorry  i don t   
it s lou gehrig s disease 
he was a baseball player 
sorry  i m lagging behind in
my pioneering research into
obscure  motor  baseball related
diseases   chuckles 
i have two years to live 
sorry 
it does sound odd when you
say it out loud  doesn t it 
you    what do you mean 
no  you don t 
 stammering 
what did they say 
sorry  i don t really  um   
will you go  bri 
stephen  sorry 
i was just being a berk 
   stammering 
  no  it s not   
 footsteps approaching 
will you go 
 knocking on door 
stephen  phone for you 
it s a girl 
um   
i ll    i ll    um   
i ll see you soon 
i ll   
yes 
she s waiting 
 dial tone 
stephen 
 indistinct conversations 
nobody s seen him
for a while 
i suppose  you know   
jane  jane 
brian  hello 
sorry  um   
why don t you   
why don t you sit down 
i m so sorry 
i spoke to stephen 
uh  yesterday 
and i know that
you called him   
 continues talking 
 tv playing 
something educational 
very 
john is having an affair with martha 
but   
martha is in love
with alan 
and i think that alan is probably a
homosexual by the look of his jumper 
so   
well  i m just trying to work out the
mathematical probability of happiness 
are you close 
some integer of zero  but no 
not quite there yet 
stephen 
you just missed him 
he was here earlier 
jane  don t do this 
go 
croquet 
play a game with me 
go 
if you don t get up
and play a game with me 
i won t come back
here again 
ever 
come on 
 jane sobbing 
leave me now 
are you going to talk
about this or not 
will you just go 
  is that what you want 
  yes  it is what i want 
so  please  if you care about
me at all  then please just go 
  i can t 
  i have two years to live 
  i need to work 
  i love you 
 stuttering 
that s a false conclusion 
i want us to be together
for as long as we ve got 
and if that s not very long  well 
then that s just how it is 
  it ll have to do 
  you don t know what s coming 
it ll affect everything 
 exhales 
your glasses
are always dirty 
 chuckles 
there 
that s better  isn t it 
yes 
yes  it is 
sciama  now the solutions
to the schrödinger equation
must vanish at the boundary
of the box  and so we have   
time 
oh  time 
that s your subject 
any aspect in particular 
time 
  come in  come in 
   chuckling 
 clears throat 
 clears throat  i   
i don t think you realize
what lies ahead  jane 
his life is going
to be very short 
so  be careful 
the weight of science
is against you 
and this will not be
a fight  jane 
this is going to be
a very heavy defeat 
for all of us 
i know what you all think 
that   
that i don t look like
a terribly strong person 
but i love him 
and he loves me 
we re going to fight
this illness together 
all of us 
 inaudible 
 inaudible 
 grunting 
 breathing heavily 
two  three   
 both grunting 
  good luck 
   chuckles 
  morning  stephen 
  morning  professor 
sciama  i know  i know 
thorne  it could be
a little bit more elegant 
sciama  yes  but i   
 knocking 
come in  stephen 
 indistinct talking 
sciama  i know it s something we
were all worried about initially 
but i    i knew  roger   
you had some reservations
about it in the early days 
yes  but it s not uncommon
in any theory 
yes 
absolutely  very well 
very well  we ll see 
  sciama  welcome  stephen 
  morning 
would you like
to take a seat 
no  i m fine  thank you 
  sciama  you re sure 
  yeah 
so  stephen 
in summary  um 
as we know  chapter one 
full of holes  uh 
lacks mathematical support 
  professor thorne 
  chapter two  not really original 
uses a lot of roger s ideas 
well  at least
you run with them 
uh  chapter three  too many
unanswered questions 
sciama  i agree 
and then  of course 
we have chapter four 
this black hole at
the beginning of time 
  space time singularity 
  indeed 
it s brilliant 
brilliant  stephen 
superb 
therefore  all there is
to say is well done 
or perhaps i should say 
to be more precise 
well done  doctor 
penrose 
bravo  stephen 
  sciama  an extraordinary theory 
   chuckles 
   chuckles 
  thank you 
so  what next 
prove it 
to prove with
a single equation
that time has a beginning 
wouldn t that be nice 
professor 
the one simple 
elegant equation
to explain everything 
yes  it would 
it would indeed 
thank you 
jane  to the esteemed
and formidable
  doctor   
  who 
 all laughing 
doctor stephen hawking 
all  doctor stephen hawking 
thank you 
it is astonishing he s the first
person to receive his doctorate
bearing in mind how little
work he s been doing 
 all laughing 
brian  work was the worst
four letter word for stephen 
at oxford especially 
he averaged an hour 
an hour a day 
he averaged 
and now  here he is 
the esteemed man 
astonishing levels of sloth 
carter  i ve got   
on the theme of sloth  brian 
how many of your lectures have i
covered in the last six months 
when you ve been doing research
trips up to the lake district 
  brian  absolutely  completely   
  ellis  so have i 
  carter  how many 
  brian  four 
 indistinct talking

  hello  dennis 
  hello  dennis 
  how are you 
okay  good luck 
sciama  he ll be fine 
he ll be fine 
oops  sorry 
no problem 
 door closes 
allowing us to predict
that some particles can 
in fact  escape a black hole 
so  black holes are not 
in fact  black at all 
but glow
with heat radiation 
the steady emission
of heat energy
causes the black holes
to lose mass
and eventually they disappear
in a spectacular explosion 
it s very  very simple  in the
way that a body loses heat 
  second law of thermodynamics 
  brian  right  it s thermodynamics 
 stuttering 
if we can imagine
that a black hole
is  indeed 
losing particles
and over time  will diminish in
size  it will evaporate  it will   
disappear 
so
first
a star vanishes
into a black hole 
and then
the black hole itself
vanishes 
gone  nothing 
from nothing to nothing 
you owe me another beer 
i have just shown you
that our friend has proven
that time  indeed 
has a beginning 
not only that  how the
universe was born 
  and   
  how it will end 
bang 
crunch 
it s  uh  beautiful 
it s racy  it s   
complete nonsense 
it s preposterous 
was it something i said 
professor 
uh  excuse me 
 door slams 
my name is professor khalatnikov
from the soviet
academy of science 
as you know 
my field is evolution
of the hot universe 
the properties of the microwave
background radiation
and the theory
of black holes 
to be honest 
i came here today
expecting to hear
a lot of nonsense 
i go home disappointed 
the little one here
has done it 
 murmuring 
he has done it 
 all applauding 
it is a pleasure
to meet you  professor 
entirely my pleasure 
my pleasure 
stephen  thank you 
professor  well done  stephen 
stephen  well  that went pretty
well  all things considered

if you don t like it 
we can take it back 
sciama  i don t understand 
you ve spent years
assuming black holes exist
and you believe
cygnus x 1 could
well turn out to be
the first black hole
that we can actually observe 
and yet  you ve bet kip thorne
it s not a black hole 
yes 
what did you
bet him

jane  stop 
 breathing heavily 
sit 
 liquid pouring 
now 
 liquid pouring 
i d like to make
a suggestion 
might sound a bit unusual  but
i have seen it work wonders 
i think
that you should consider
joining the church choir 
 chuckling

english thing anyone has ever said

  but  um   
  ah  okay 
  well  thank you  jonathan 
  my pleasure  jane  see you again 
  bye bye 
  bye bye 
 piano playing 
third finger  no  that

keep your elbows back 
okay  try again 
robert  no 
   chuckling  good 
   chuckling  yeah 
jane  more wine 
um  why not 
thank you 
  stephen 
  no 
 jonathan clearing throat 
stephen  jane was telling me that
you have a beautiful  uh  theorem 
um   
that proves that
the universe  um 
had a beginning 
is that it 
that was my phd thesis 
my new project
disproves it 
  uh  disproves it  oh 
  yes 
um  so then you no longer
believe in the creation 
what one believes
is irrelevant in physics 
 irrelevant in physics  
oh   clearing throat 
i see 
stephen s done a u turn 
the big new idea is that the
universe has no boundaries at all 
no boundaries 
no beginning 
and no god  oh 
oh  i see  i     chuckles 
i thought that  um 
you d proved the universe had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator 
 chuckles  my mistake 
no  mine 
stephen is looking
for a single theory
that explains all the
forces in the universe 
therefore  god must die 
oh  uh  why must god die 
i don t see 
the two great pillars
of physics
are quantum theory 
the laws that govern the very small
particles  electrons and so on 
and general relativity 
ah  yes  einstein 
einstein s theory 
the laws that govern
the very large planets
and such 
but quantum and relativity   
don t tell me 
they re different 
they don t remotely
play by the same rules 
if the world were all
potatoes  then  easy 
you could trace
a precise beginning
as stephen once did 
a moment of creation 
hallelujah  god lives 
if you incorporate peas
into the menu 
well  then it all
goes a little   
  tits up 
  oh   chuckling 
yes  haywire 
  it just all becomes a godless mess 
  oh  dear 
   chuckling 
  einstein hated peas 
quantum theory  he said   god doesn t
play dice with the universe  
stephen  seems
he not only plays dice 
but he throws them
where we can t find them 
god is back on the endangered species list 
 jonathan chuckling 
well  i expect he ll cope 
and physics
is back in business 
jane  yes 
physics is back in business 
i was  uh  married 
actually 
um    but  sadly 
she passed 
almost a year ago now 
 exhaling 
it was  uh  leukemia 
um  she fought it
and i nursed her 
but  uh  in the end   
um   
 sighing 
i do get quite lonely 
the  uh   inhaling deeply 
tyranny of the empty room
and all that 
but music is my salvation 
teaching and playing 
not really as a career 
but i m not very ambitious 
though that s not   
 sighing 
is that a sin 
i don t know 
wrong man to ask 
thank you so much
for having me 
  thank you for coming 
  it was really  really wonderful 
if there s anything
i can do to be of service 
um  to you 
to the family 
i mean  i would
consider it a privilege 
i have no children
or commitments  so   
i only mean that
if i could be of help 
i believe i might
find a purpose that would
help alleviate my own 
um  situation   chuckles 
good night 
night 
i understand
if you need help 
if someone is prepared
to offer it 
i won t object 
 laughing 
chilly   chuckling

your choice not to have home help 
but we need to find
a permanent solution 
this  uh  situation
cannot continue 
you need to have a proper
live in nurse immediately 
we have help 
look  you know

a live in nurse 
stephen  you need
to find a way

stephen  this isn t funny 
i believe it s urgent 
 water rushing 
we do have

isobel  whose child
timothy is

jonathan 
jonathan 
stephen s been taken ill 
he s in hospital and
  he  uh    he s in a coma 
  stephen s been taken ill 
 equipment beeping 
 jane speaking french 
what are you talking about 
this way would be
a painless end 
if we try to bring him round
from the anesthetic 
it s not sure
he will survive resuscitation 
you have to bring him round
from the anesthetic 
are you sure
it s what you want 
the only way of weaning him
off the ventilator
will be to give him
a tracheotomy 
a hole in the neck 
bypassing the throat 
he will never speak again 
there s no question 
stephen must live 
i will see he gets
everything he needs 
i will have him transferred
back to cambridge 
he may not survive
the journey 
yes  he will 
i know 
i ll
step back 
did you get everything

stephen 
this is
a spelling board 
firstly  you tell me
what letter you want
by blinking when i say
the color of the group
that contains
the letter 
once i know the group 
you can choose
the character
inside that group
by blinking again
when i say
the color of each letter
within that group 
apparently 
let s just try 
green

so  how did you get on 
you know   
i think he s the most
brilliant man i ve ever met 
you re very lucky 
thank you 
you must worship
the ground beneath   
his wheels 
and he s
the perfect patient 
he s so funny 
when you read about him   
let s see how you get on 
shall we  elaine 
technician  that s
tightened up 
as you can see 
it s height adjustable
and we can change the angle
to whatever steve wants it at 
you know  it s cutting edge 
jane  so 
how does it work 
it uses
a very simple interface
that scans
through the alphabet 
selects each letter
one at a time 
i mean  using this technique 
the professor can expect
to write about
four words per minute 
good  better than
one a minute 
 laughs  yes 
and what i ve done
is taken the components from a
telephone answering system  actually 
to convert
the written text
into synthesized speech 
i mean  the voice sounds
a little bit robotic 
but  um  shall we give it a try 
  great 
  here s the clicker 
jane  right hand 
technician  there you go 
 clears throat 
welcome to the future 
 stephen speaking
through mechanized voice 
it s american 
is that a problem 
oh  my goodness  well 
is there another voice 
that s the only one
they have at the moment 
i think it s great 
 laughs 
 clicking 
 stephen speaking 
frankly  my dear 
i don t give a damn 
   laughing 
  exterminate 
exterminate 
exterminate 
i will write a book 
about what 
 clicking 
time 
 stephen speaking 
what is the nature of time 
will it ever come to an end 
 speaking 
someday  these answers
may seem as obvious to us
as the earth
orbiting the sun 
or perhaps as ridiculous
as a tower of tortoises 
only time 
whatever that may be 
will tell 
professor 
 clicking quickly 
it is for a friend 
of course it is 
that s what they all say 
you don t have to be embarrassed
in front of me  professor 
i know what men are like 
shall we take a look 
there you go 
 clears throat 
 door opens 
oh  i m sorry 
next one 
what 
stephen  so i said   i have long been
looking for a model of the universe 
   i finally found her  
   laughing 
i bet you did 
 laughing 
stephen  i need to steal you 
the contract s arrived 
could you just give us
a minute  please  jane 
there we go 
like new 
 elaine chuckles 
 who are we 
 why are we here 
 if we ever learn this 
 it will be the ultimate
triumph of human reason 
 for then we would know
the mind of god  
do you mean this 
yes 
of course 
so  you re acknowledging him 
however   
 however  what 
are you actually going to
let me have this moment 
you are welcome 
i have asked elaine to travel
with me to america

another award

 sobs

 indistinct chattering 
bye  jonathan 
 breathing heavily 
 piano music starts 
 reporters clamoring 
woman  professor 
i love your book 
 audience applauding 
thank you 
i first met the professor
in 1963 
now there you are  time 
where does it go 
it has been
one of the great joys
of my life to watch this man
defy every expectation 
both scientific and personal 
please welcome onto the stage
my esteemed colleague 
my dear friend 
professor hawking 
 audience applauding 
thank you 
could we please have
the first pre selected
question  thank you 
can you hear me 
 audience laughing 
now you are
recognized everywhere 
how do you deal
with all the attention 
i was stopped recently
by a tourist in cambridge 
who asked if i was
the real stephen hawking 
i replied i was not and said the
real one was much better looking 
in 1979  you talked
about the possibility
of a theory of everything being
discovered before the end of the century 
i now predict
that i was wrong 
professor hawking 
you have said you do not
believe in god 
do you have a philosophy of life
that helps you   fades off 
you have said
you do not believe in god 
do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you 
it is clear that we are just
an advanced breed of primates
on a minor planet orbiting
around a very average star
in the outer suburb of one
among 100 billion galaxies 
but 
ever since
the dawn of civilization 
people have craved
for an understanding
of the underlying order
of the world 
there ought to be
something very special
about the boundary conditions
of the universe 
and what can be more special than
that there is no boundary   
and there should be no
boundary to human endeavor 
we are all different 
however bad life may seem 
there is always something
you can do and succeed at 
while there is life 
there is hope 
 audience applauding 
that came 
it s from stephen 
gosh 
your glasses
are always dirty 
equerry  professor and mrs 
hawking  her majesty the queen 
congratulations   
my companion of honour 
not bad
for an old liberal socialist 
 whispers  don t worry  you
can decline the knighthood 
thank you  for today 
it was extraordinary
