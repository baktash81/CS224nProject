we lost in the war of  96
did not perish in vain 
they inspired us to rise from the
ashes as one people of one world

seen no arm conflict 
nations have put their
petty differences aside 
united  we rebuild our families 
our cities and our lives 
the fusion of human and alien technology
not only enable us to defy gravity
and travel with unimaginable speed 
it also made our planet
finally safe again

tug 10 collided

jiang s coming in hot 
and he s got that look

he knows we don t
speak chinese  right 
you almost destroyed us 
  that was a close call  sir 
  you almost got us all killed 
ah  yeah 
but then i saved everyone 
you don t get credit for
cleaning up you own mess 
and you destroyed
one of our tugs

the planet for 3 weeks now 
but  now that i have you 
excuse me

floyd rosenberg 
government appointed controller 
please be advised 
entering hostile territories 
we should slow down 
we don t want to look like
we are posing a threat 
now  we are going to
start with appendix 2 
i know a lot of people have a
negative reaction to being audited 
  but i actually find that it s a
  very constructive experience 
  lloyd  lloyd  lloyd 
  it s floyd 
  we have to meet a friend right now 
a great guy 
come say hi 
where are we 
director levinson 
director levinson 
who are those men 
  it s umbutu s rebel forces 
  the warlord 
i don t think there s
anything to worry about 
his old man just died 
and i hear that the son
is much more of a moderate 
but    uh 
hey  fellas 
howdy doody 
say  uh 
i m looking for dikembe umbutu 
i see you found their armory 
the one and only david levinson 
catherine 
wow 
wh   um  what are you 
what are you doing here 
you don t think you re the
only expert he called  do you 
um  i m so surprise to see you 
a little bit 
i m a little surprise that
you remember my name 
hey  hey 
come on 
let s be   
let s be professional 
well  we both remembered
what happened the last time
we tried to be professional 
i m sensing a affable tension here 
we ve bumped into each other
in a few conferences 
i bet you have 
shut up  floyd 
director levinson  i m sorry 
we re not done with our business here 
 where are your papers 
  what papers 
  uh  it looks like this 
so why does umbutu junior
need a psychiatrist 
unresolved daddy issues 
these people fought a grand war
with the aliens for 10 years 
their connection is the
strongest i ve ever seen 
it s as if their mind is tapped
into the aliens subconscious 
yeah  your obsession with the
 human alien psychic residual condition  
you  calling me obsessive 
that s cute 
how do they get the lights on 
we didn t 
it happened on it s own 
2 days ago 
of course you re aware that this
is the only ship that landed in  96 
and so i appreciate you finally granting
us this access  mr  umbutu 
your father was    very tenacious 
his pride caused the death of
more than half of my people 
  including my brother 
  i m so sorry 
  becareful 
  whoa 
wow 
what happened here 
they were drilling 
for what 
man  i don t know 
when did the drilling stop 
when you blew up the mother ship 
and uh  right now for us 
anyway to get up there 
you re not afraid of heights 
are you 
oh yes  i do 
oh my god 
that s the same pattern 
so the signal was
coming from this ship 
20 years ago  when we
destroyed the mother ship 
we detected a burst in
an x band frequency
directed towards deep space 
oh 
the distress call 
looks like someone picked up
the phone and answered 
i m going crazy up here 
i can t take it anymore 
tell me how much
you miss me 
actually the chief of staff just
got a really handsome intern 
not quite as tall as you 
but has great dimples 
and plays a cello 
  you know how much i miss you 
  you know what 
i m going to steal a tug and
come back to see you right now 
no  please don t 
because the last time you did that 
they added a month
to your tour 
come on  tell me that wasn t
the best 2 minutes of your life 
yes

yeah  i can see that 
babe 
you got a bit fat 
and really bald 
you still look great 
this just came in from hubble 
there s some kind of force
pulling in saturn s rings 
holy christ 
what about our defense base there 
it s gone 
it s not just the base  it s like
the whole moon just vanished 
  up the alert level to red 
  right away 
hey  honey 
listen  i want you to
pack up your stuff
and go to your
sister s right now 
well  but this symbol comes out more
often than anything i ve encountered 
look 
look at the similarities 
how can you not
see the relevance 
no  it s not that
i don t see it 
i just feel that right now
there are more pressing matters
than analyzing doodles 
you know  like a giant
space ship turning back on 
  sir 
  yeah 
  we lost all contact with saturn 
  what 
  we need to notify the president 
  already tried 
tanner said he ll get back
to us after the press talk 
bypass tanner  hurry 
and you talk to lanford now 
  right  right  right 
  thank you 
uh  at least your father
spared the elephants 
good for him 
look 
the roswell crash  in  47 
the farmer who made contact
drew the same circle 
and everytime i interviewed one of
my patients and showed them this 
  they all expressed the same emotion 
  mm hm 
fear 
and i don t think
it s a circle 
the night the ship turned on 
i experienced the strongest
vision i ve ever had 
and i drew this 
that s incredible 
how did you decipher
so much of their language 
they were hunting us 
we have to learn
how to hunt them 
  that means you re beautiful 
  oh  thanks  man 
not you 
i mean   
you have to remove
the sub sonic inlets
before you can reconfigure the
thermalize plasma cartridges 
that s great  why don t you put
that thing down and help me 
okay  try to have a good
grasp of today s situation 
there she is 
ah 
  it s happening 
  god damn it 
the chemical reaction 
the pheromones 
all the blood of my body
is rushing to my head 
your head  huh 
  i m going to go introduce myself 
  yeah  no problem 
god 
shit 
so 
you must the pilot china sent 
  did the giant flag give it away 
  there s that 
in fact  i heard you speaking
chinese earlier anyway
i was wondering if you
want to get a drink 
maybe fall in love 
  aren t you a little young for that 
  i m 23 and i have 
all personnel  report to
your stations immediately 
arm the primary 
  get me the security council 
  yes  sir

  sir 
  yeah 
this just came in 
it was a spaceship 
madam president  the heads
of state are coming online 
david  are you seeing this 
yes  madam president 
i m looking right at it 
they could be initiating an attack 
we need to strike first 
uh  hold on 
hang on a second 
to my eye 
the design and technology
of this ship
is nothing like the ones
that attacked us 
i m telling you
this is not them 
  and what if you re wrong 
  if you re wrong 
we could be starting a war
with a whole new species 
at this point  we know the
saturn base has been destroyed 
madam president  this could very
well be a coordinated attack 
  get the cannon into firing position 
  yes  sir 
we should be cautious
and listen to director levinson 
how does the rest
of the council feel 
let s hold off until
we know more 
we have to be decisive 
i vote to attack 
i also vote to strike 
madam president 
i need an answer 
take them out  commander 
we are locked on 
i think this is a mistake 
let s take another moment   
fire 
get me an image 
it crashed into
van de graaff crater 
we are not picking up
any signs of life 
let s hope to god
we did the right thing 
madam president  we need to send
a team up to investigate the wreckage 
we need to know who
we just shot down 
there s no sign of life and
the threat has been neutralized 
we can send a team up 
but david needs to be in dc 
no  oh 
can we not make this political 
i need to get up there
and get answers 
david  you can lead a team up there 
but after the celebration 
you heard the president 
i ll expect to see you next to us

  sam  stop the car

this thing showed up
just before they did 
  you know  i think you re right 
  brakish 
you should be in bed  babe 
where 
where did you get this 
that s uh 
that s from a ship
that we shot down 
we need to cut this open 
director levinson  proceed to
command center immediately 
call us as soon as
you have anything 
come on  people 
move 
baby  i m so happy that you
want to dive back into work 
  maybe we should get you some pants 
  pants 
oh 
alright  go on 
why didn t you tell me
my butt was hanging out 
we have infrared
of the alien ship  sir 
  are those dots   
  that must be aliens 
what s that mass 
enlarge the section  please 
that s what our prisoner alien
meant by   
 she is all  
director levinson  i have cheyenne mountain
and the remaining world leaders online 
  david  what can you tell us 
  ma am 
they are like a hive and i think
we ve just found their queen 
their    very big queen 
this is an infrared image
of their ship
and we think that s her 
madam president 
  right there in the middle 
  christ almighty 
general adams  we have a live feed
from our reconnaissance aircraft 
  great  put it up 
  yes  sir 
david  is this one of their plasma drills
you briefed us about 
yeah  i believe so 
the funnel is over
a mile in diameter  sir 
that s 20 times bigger
than the one in africa 
i think they re after
our molten core 
which means no magnetic fields 
our atmosphere evaporate basically
the end of life on this planet 
oh  so you are saying
we re already finished 
not necessarily 
back in  96 
the drilling in africa stops when
we blew up their mother ship 
there must be a queen up
there that we didn t know about 
assuming this hive theory holds true 
general  if we could blow up this
queen  maybe it could work again 
alright then  i m authorizing
an immediate retaliatory strike 
let s do it 
  scramble the fighters 
  right away 
  go get them 
  attention  all pilots report to mission briefing in    
hey 
come find me after
the briefing  okay 
suit up  boys 
i m so sorry  dylan 
i was right there  man 
i couldn t save her 
it s too late 
look  i know i am
probably the last person
you want to hear
from right now 
but i ve been where you are 
and i know how
deep it hurts 
she wouldn t want
you to give up now 
come on  man 
you got to lead us 
see you up there  lieutenant 
good afternoon 
this red mass on
top of the ship 
that s your target 
we re gonna send a fleet of
drones to go ahead of you
and disable their shields 
you mission 
is to fly cover
for the bombers who will be
armed with cold fusion warheads 
now  the blast should
penetrate the hull
and kill that alien queen 
captain hiller will brief
you on the flight plan 
we ll all try to converge
at the same time 
but whoever gets to the target first 
will deliver the payload 
we have to expect
that they re going to
come at us with
everything they got 
so protect the bombers
at all cost 
we all lost someone
that we loved 
so let s do it for them 
alpha launch in 1 minute 
jake 
i m coming back 
i promise 
make them pay 
i m not going out there
to make friends  right 
i looked at the houses 
the one on harrison street 
with the stone walkway 
if it s still there 
okay 
it s getting real 
it s getting real  real 
alright  form up 
on me 
it s the 4th of july 
so show them some fireworks 
i want you to give me
one of your katana blades
and teach me everything you know 
fine 
you know what 
i ll figure something out 
what are you idiots doing 
the world s going to an end 
  even worse  we lost the gold 
  mm hm 
so we thought
we drink a little 
us government is on the line 
they say the aliens are
drilling to the earth s core
and they are looking for a ship in
the area to monitor their progress 
we re the only ones left 
tell them we ll do it 
for a hundred million dollars 
look at this guy 
weee 
yeah  hold on a second 
he s drunk 
they say it s a deal 
look  sam 
they are going off road 
maybe we should do the same 
dear god

at thanksgiving but unfortunately   
unless he had to cancel 
what about you 
where are your parents 
um 
visiting our grandparents in florida 
oh  i see 
where should we go  mr  levinson 
i think the safest place for
all of us to be right now
is by my david 
since you re the leading
expert in this condition 
i really want you to see this 
how can his connection
be so strong 
during the first attack 
he was exposed
to their collective mind 
it was completely unfiltered 
  i need to ask him about this 
  i already have 
he doesn t even
remember drawing them 
okay 
let s try this baby on for size 
you know  i helped bring
that thing back from space 
  is there anything i can do 
  yeah 
back off

let s form up on the leads 
charlie  look at those fields down there

we re going down 
we re going down 
i can t restart 
come on 
we lost all power

tel    patricia   
i    lov    her   
i love you too 
in 5  4  3  2  1 
command  it s a negative impact 
the blasts are contained
by an energy shield 
repeat   
the blasts    contained    by an energy sh   
we lost the signal  sir 
wait 
something s happening 
system offline
she baited us 
tanner  we have to
have a status report 
we re trying 
our satellites are down 
we re completely blind 
madam president 
there will be no peace 
careful 
you ll agitate the crystals 
i build it back in  94 
had to shelf it though after
the meltdown in sector 3 
  here  put it over here 
  brakish  you re overexerting yourself 
what is that thing doing here 
alright  be a good boy 
go stand over there 
wait a second

  yes  sir 
general 
cheyenne mountain is gone 
all members of the presidential
line up succession are presumed dead

  do solemnly swear 
i m so sorry 
you are right 
we re not going to
beat them this time 
god  look at the line 
it s like a thousand cars 
we re never going to get gas 
have a little faith 
you want to talk about faith 
my parents are probably
dead right now 
and most of my friends   
she s upset because her boyfriend 
kyle  is for sure a goner 
what s a goner 
  someone who is dead 
  felix 
why don t you pull over here 
let me drive and
you take a little break 
okay 
david  you should be
in the command center 
president whitmore 
thank god you re okay 
it s been a while 
i had 20 years
to get us ready 
and we never had a chance 
we didn t last time  either 
we always knew they
were coming back 
but look how far we ve come 
in the last 20 years 
this planet has been unified in a way
that s unprecedented in human history 
that s sacred 
that s worth fighting for 
we convinced an entire generation
that this is a battle we could win 
and they believed us 
we can t let them down 
it wasn t luck last time 
it was our resolve 
we all have to fight
till our last breath 
and that is going to
lead us to victory 
you understand some of their language 
i like you to tell me if
any of these writings
mean anything to you 
so okay 
how about this one 
this talks about an
intergalactic war 
this concerns the whole universe 
what about this one 
something about an enemy 
that needs to be destroyed
before it gets to us 
wait 
i had a case study in brazil 
where my patient didn t
describe the circle as sphere 
he refereed to it
as  enemy  
of course 
their enemy is our ally 
uh 
your laser s smoking 
oh oh 
get it out of here 
tell them to try and
pull it open 
hello  gorgeous 
time to find out what
secrets you re hiding 
alright  let s go get everyone 
bring them here 
yes  sir 
watch your back 
go  go 
don t block in front of the guy 
jake  get out of the way 
guys 
you really need to see this 
i ve run every possible scan 
it s not giving off any kind of signal 
i mean nothing 
it s like it doesn t even exist 
it s almost like
it s trying to hide itself 
  it s really smooth 
  hey  whoa  whoa  whoa 
you re not wearing gloves 
you ll contaminate it 
remove your hands  floyd 
that s weird 
  i can t 
  what do you mean you can t  rosenberg 
okay 
i m trapped 
somebody do something 
it s swallowing me 
just stay calm and don t panic 
this thing is trying to eat me 
your advice is not to panic 
enemy detected
enemy detected
it looks like they re mobilizing 
david  please tell me this isn t
some kind of a trojan horse 
i don t think it s a danger to us 
but it must be to them 
he turned it on
just by touching it 
i activated myself when i
detected your biological signature
to be different from theirs 
it speaks  ha 
in english 
i deconstructed your primitive language 
  we re we re primitive 
  correct 
my species shared our biological existence
for a virtual one thousands of years ago 
far out 
why are you here 
when i intercepted
their distress call 
i knew they would come
to exterminate you 
i came to evacuate as
many of you as possible 
but you attacked me with the
same weapons that they used on us 
  they attacked you 
  correct 
a harvester ship conquered our planet
and extracted it s molten core 
they used them to refuel their
ships and grow their technology 
they ve done this
to countless civilizations 
we fought them for
thousands of years 
but they destroyed
all of our ships 
i  am the sole survivor 
i am so sorry to hear that 
do you have a plan 
my system holds the key
to superior technology 
and there is a hidden planet
where i teach refugees
from other fallen worlds how to
build weapons that will defeat them
  once and for all 
  that s why they re afraid of you 
you re the only ones who
threaten their existence 
correct 
but now that i m activated 
the queen will detect my signature
and hunt me down 
it s too late 
she s already on her way 
yeah 
she s coming 
and what would happen if   
if we re able to kill her 
no one has ever killed
a harvester queen 
that s encouraging 
but as a hive 
her fighters will fall
and her ship will leave your planet 
recalled by other harvester queens 
but it s too late now 
you must terminate me or
she will get the coordinates
to the refugee planet 
and that will be the end 
wait wait a second 
wait a second 
if we are so sure that she s
coming here to get you 
maybe 
we can bait her   
like she baited us 
mr  president  dr  okun
thinks that we can
  replicate the sphere s rf radiation signal 
  david  english please 
every computer has a radioactive signature 
whether it s your laptop 
you phone  even your watch 
but the sphere has a rfr
that s completely off the charts 
so  if we hide the real sphere
inside the isolation chamber 
and pack this decoy transmitter
so to speak  onto a tug
filled with cold fusion bombs
and lure her out to the salt flats 
we can fly right up her
royal ass and bon voyage 
you set off cold fusion bombs 
you re gonna kill everyone
from here to houston 
not if we use the shield generators
from this base to contain the blast 
without our shields  you better put
a blaster in every able bodied hand 
  and get them ready
  to shoot some aliens 
  yes  sir 
now  we just need a way to   
see her coming 
follow me 
  do your thing 
  my thing 
my thing 
my thing 
  take it off 
  copy  sir 
watch it 
this old radar truck was suppose
to go to the smithsonian 
  they never picked it up 
  it s a good thing they didn t 
yeah  drive it to the highest point 
the higher the better 
yes  sir 
look what i found
in the hold 
we should be able to
communicate with this 
let s hook up the antenna 
what was that 
whoa whoa whoa whoa 
the drill is cracking the outer mantle 
but   
that shouldn t happen for another   
we were wrong 
we do not have 7 hours
until the earth core breach 
we only have    one 
call it in 
area 51  area 51 
do you copy 
so the idea is to
get her to follow this tug
into the salt flats using the
decoy transmitter on board 
and once she s taken the bait 
our cold fusion bombs
can go to town to hail mary 
it can work 
there s a catch 
as you know  they took out
all of our satellites  which means   
that somebody is going to
have to fly in manually 
and i know that i m asking
for the ultimate sacrifice 
i know that 
but you  you re the only
pilots we have left 
and i need a volunteer 
let s get it done 
i ll fly it in 
no  you won t 
i ll do it 
mr  president 
dad  what are you doing 
patty  there re a lot of reasons
i m the best choice for this 
you all have to pick up
the pieces once it s over 
this is my part 
matthew 
do not let him
get on that tug 
do you understand me 
get the hell off the road 
if you go any slower 
we ll be going backwards 
don t be a schmuck 
we have to conserve gas 
area 51 is still
75 miles away 
  we re running on fumes 
  what do we have here 
  who s in charge here 
  no one 
our driver left us
to take a ride to minnesota 
just like that 
he just left 
he wanted to go have
sex with his girlfriend 
yes 
all aboard 
wait  wait wait wait 
what about our our car 
we ll get you a new one
when you get your license 
on the bus  everybody 
tell the general
we re up and running 
bring it in 
spin it around 
alright 
plug it in 
radar is operational  sir 
son of a bitch 
alright  they re coming in fast 
david  we got a real
firestorm coming our way
and not a lot of
time to prepare 
give me numbers  mr  president 
9 minutes to the
queen ship s arrival 
roughly 22 minutes before the
drill reaches our molten core 
jesus christ 
take your positions 
we don t have a second to lose 
are we going to make it  sir 
you bet your ass we will 
this thing is way cooler
than the machete 
sorry 
sorry  everyone 
that was my bad 
i m going to see

shortwave radios 
to you out there
and here at home 
make no mistake
