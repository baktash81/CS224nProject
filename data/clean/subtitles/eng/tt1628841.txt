we lost in the war of 96
did not perish in vain
they inspired us to rise from the
ashes as one people of one world

seen no arm conflict
nations have put their
petty differences aside
united we rebuild our families
our cities and our lives

and travel with unimaginable speed
it also made our planet
finally safe again

very constructive experience
lloyd lloyd lloyd

director levinson
director levinson
who are those men
its umbutus rebel forces
the warlord

im sensing a affable tension here
weve bumped into each other
in a few conferences
i bet you have
shut up floyd
director levinson im sorry
were not done with our business here
where are your papers
what papers
uh it looks like this
so why does umbutu junior
need a psychiatrist
unresolved daddy issues
these people fought a grand war
with the aliens for 10 years
their connection is the
strongest ive ever seen
its as if their mind is tapped
into the aliens subconscious
yeah your obsession with the
humanalien psychic residual condition
you calling me obsessive
thats cute
how do they get the lights on
we didnt
it happened on its own
2 days ago
of course youre aware that this
is the only ship that landed in 96
and so i appreciate you finally granting
us this access mr umbutu
your father was very tenacious
his pride caused the death of
more than half of my people
including my brother
im so sorry
becareful
whoa
wow
what happened here
they were drilling
for what
man i dont know
when did the drilling stop
when you blew up the mother ship
and uh right now for us
anyway to get up there
youre not afraid of heights
are you
oh yes i do
oh my god
thats the same pattern
so the signal was
coming from this ship
20 years ago when we
destroyed the mother ship
we detected a burst in
an xband frequency
directed towards deep space
oh
the distress call
looks like someone picked up
the phone and answered
im going crazy up here

this just came in from hubble
theres some kind of force
pulling in saturns rings
holy christ

its gone
its not just the base its like
the whole moon just vanished
up the alert level to red
right away
hey honey
listen i want you to
pack up your stuff
and go to your
sisters right now
well but this symbol comes out more
often than anything ive encountered
look
look at the similarities
how can you not
see the relevance
no its not that
i dont see it
i just feel that right now
there are more pressing matters
than analyzing doodles
you know like a giant
space ship turning back on
sir
yeah
we lost all contact with saturn
what
we need to notify the president
already tried
tanner said hell get back
to us after the press talk
bypass tanner hurry
and you talk to lanford now
right right right
thank you
uh at least your father
spared the elephants
good for him
look
the roswell crash in 47
the farmer who made contact
drew the same circle
and everytime i interviewed one of
my patients and showed them this
they all expressed the same emotion
mmhm
fear
and i dont think
its a circle
the night the ship turned on
i experienced the strongest
vision ive ever had
and i drew this
thats incredible
how did you decipher
so much of their language
they were hunting us
we have to learn
how to hunt them
that means youre beautiful
oh thanks man
not you
i mean
you have to remove
the subsonic inlets
before you can reconfigure the
thermalize plasma cartridges
thats great why dont you put
that thing down and help me
okay try to have a good
grasp of todays situation
there she is
ah
its happening
god damn it
the chemical reaction
the pheromones
all the blood of my body
is rushing to my head
your head huh
im going to go introduce myself
yeah no problem
god
shit
so
you must the pilot china sent
did the giant flag give it away
theres that
in fact i heard you speaking
chinese earlier anyway

all personnel report to

madam president the heads
of state are coming online
david are you seeing this
yes madam president
im looking right at it
they could be initiating an attack
we need to strike first
uh hold on
hang on a second
to my eye
the design and technology
of this ship
is nothing like the ones
that attacked us
im telling you
this is not them
and what if youre wrong
if youre wrong
we could be starting a war
with a whole new species
at this point we know the
saturn base has been destroyed
madam president this could very
well be a coordinated attack
get the cannon into firing position
yes sir
we should be cautious
and listen to director levinson
how does the rest
of the council feel
lets hold off until
we know more
we have to be decisive
i vote to attack
i also vote to strike
madam president
i need an answer
take them out commander
we are locked on
i think this is a mistake
lets take another moment
fire
get me an image
it crashed into
van de graaff crater
we are not picking up
any signs of life
lets hope to god
we did the right thing
madam president we need to send
a team up to investigate the wreckage
we need to know who
we just shot down
theres no sign of life and
the threat has been neutralized
we can send a team up
but david needs to be in dc

pants
oh
alright go on
why didnt you tell me
my butt was hanging out
we have infrared
of the alien ship sir
are those dots
that must be aliens
whats that mass
enlarge the section please
thats what our prisoner alien
meant by
she is all
director levinson i have cheyenne mountain
and the remaining world leaders online
david what can you tell us
maam
they are like a hive and i think
weve just found their queen
their very big queen
this is an infrared image
of their ship
and we think thats her
madam president
right there in the middle
christ almighty
general adams we have a live feed
from our reconnaissance aircraft
great put it up
yes sir
david is this one of their plasma drills
you briefed us about
yeah i believe so
the funnel is over
a mile in diameter sir
thats 20 times bigger
than the one in africa
i think theyre after
our molten core
which means no magnetic fields
our atmosphere evaporate basically
the end of life on this planet
oh so you are saying
were already finished
not necessarily
back in 96
the drilling in africa stops when
we blew up their mother ship
there must be a queen up
there that we didnt know about
assuming this hive theory holds true
general if we could blow up this
queen maybe it could work again
alright then im authorizing
an immediate retaliatory strike
lets do it
scramble the fighters
right away
go get them
attention all pilots report to mission briefing in
hey
come find me after
the briefing okay
suit up boys
im so sorry dylan
i was right there man
i couldnt save her
its too late
look i know i am
probably the last person
you want to hear
from right now
but ive been where you are
and i know how
deep it hurts
she wouldnt want
you to give up now
come on man
you got to lead us
see you up there lieutenant
good afternoon
this red mass on
top of the ship
thats your target
were gonna send a fleet of
drones to go ahead of you
and disable their shields
you mission
is to fly cover
for the bombers who will be
armed with coldfusion warheads
now the blast should
penetrate the hull
and kill that alien queen
captain hiller will brief
you on the flight plan
well all try to converge
at the same time
but whoever gets to the target first
will deliver the payload
we have to expect
that theyre going to
come at us with
everything they got
so protect the bombers
at all cost
we all lost someone
that we loved
so lets do it for them
alpha launch in 1 minute
jake

felix

let me drive and
you take a little break
okay
david you should be
in the command center
president whitmore
thank god youre okay
its been a while
i had 20 years
to get us ready
and we never had a chance
we didnt last time either
we always knew they
were coming back
but look how far weve come
in the last 20 years
this planet has been unified in a way
thats unprecedented in human history
thats sacred
thats worth fighting for
we convinced an entire generation
that this is a battle we could win
and they believed us
we cant let them down
it wasnt luck last time
it was our resolve
we all have to fight
till our last breath
and that is going to
lead us to victory
you understand some of their language
i like you to tell me if
any of these writings
mean anything to you
so okay
how about this one
this talks about an
intergalactic war
this concerns the whole universe
what about this one
something about an enemy
that needs to be destroyed
before it gets to us
wait
i had a case study in brazil
where my patient didnt
describe the circle as sphere
he refereed to it
as enemy
of course
their enemy is our ally
uh
your lasers smoking
oh oh
get it out of here
tell them to try and
pull it open
hello gorgeous
time to find out what
secrets youre hiding
alright lets go get everyone
bring them here
yes sir
watch your back
go go
dont block in front of the guy
jake get out of the way
guys
you really need to see this
ive run every possible scan
its not giving off any kind of signal
i mean nothing
its like it doesnt even exist
its almost like
its trying to hide itself
its really smooth
hey whoa whoa whoa
youre not wearing gloves
youll contaminate it
remove your hands floyd
thats weird
i cant
what do you mean you cant rosenberg
okay
im trapped
somebody do something
its swallowing me
just stay calm and dont panic
this thing is trying to eat me
your advice is not to panic
enemy detected
enemy detected
it looks like theyre mobilizing
david please tell me this isnt
some kind of a trojan horse
i dont think its a danger to us
but it must be to them
he turned it on
just by touching it
i activated myself when i
detected your biological signature
to be different from theirs
it speaks ha
in english
i deconstructed your primitive language
werewere primitive
correct
my species shared our biological existence
for a virtual one thousands of years ago
far out
why are you here
when i intercepted
their distress call
i knew they would come
to exterminate you
i came to evacuate as
many of you as possible
but you attacked me with the
same weapons that they used on us
they attacked you
correct
a harvester ship conquered our planet
and extracted its molten core
they used them to refuel their
ships and grow their technology
theyve done this
to countless civilizations
we fought them for
thousands of years
but they destroyed
all of our ships
i am the sole survivor
i am so sorry to hear that
do you have a plan
my system holds the key
to superior technology
and there is a hidden planet
where i teach refugees
from other fallen worlds how to
build weapons that will defeat them
once and for all
thats why theyre afraid of you
youre the only ones who
threaten their existence
correct
but now that im activated
the queen will detect my signature
and hunt me down
its too late
shes already on her way
yeah
shes coming
and what would happen if
if were able to kill her
no one has ever killed
a harvester queen
thats encouraging
but as a hive
her fighters will fall
and her ship will leave your planet
recalled by other harvester queens
but its too late now
you must terminate me or
she will get the coordinates
to the refugee planet
and that will be the end
waitwait a second
wait a second
if we are so sure that shes
coming here to get you
maybe
we can bait her
like she baited us
mr president dr okun
thinks that we can
replicate the spheres rf radiation signal
david english please
every computer has a radioactive signature
whether its your laptop
you phone even your watch
but the sphere has a rfr
thats completely off the charts
so if we hide the real sphere
inside the isolation chamber
and pack this decoy transmitter
so to speak onto a tug
filled with coldfusion bombs
and lure her out to the salt flats
we can fly right up her
royal ass and bon voyage
you set off coldfusion bombs
youre gonna kill everyone
from here to houston
not if we use the shield generators
from this base to contain the blast
without our shields you better put
a blaster in every ablebodied hand
and get them ready
to shoot some aliens
yes sir
now we just need a way to
see her coming
follow me
do your thing
my thing
my thing
my thing
take it off
copy sir
watch it
this old radar truck was suppose
to go to the smithsonian
they never picked it up
its a good thing they didnt
yeah drive it to the highest point
the higher the better
yes sir
look what i found
in the hold
we should be able to
communicate with this
lets hook up the antenna
what was that
whoa whoa whoa whoa
the drill is cracking the outer mantle
but
that shouldnt happen for another
we were wrong
we do not have 7 hours
until the earth core breach
we only have one
call it in
area 51 area 51
do you copy
so the idea is to
get her to follow this tug
into the salt flats using the
decoy transmitter on board
and once shes taken the bait
our coldfusion bombs
can go to town to hail mary
it can work
theres a catch
as you know they took out
all of our satellites which means
that somebody is going to
have to fly in manually
and i know that im asking
for the ultimate sacrifice
i know that
but you youre the only
pilots we have left
and i need a volunteer
lets get it done
ill fly it in
no you wont
ill do it
mr president
dad what are you doing
patty therere a lot of reasons
im the best choice for this
you all have to pick up
the pieces once its over
this is my part
matthew
do not let him
get on that tug
do you understand me
get the hell off the road
if you go any slower
well be going backwards
dont be a schmuck
we have to conserve gas
area 51 is still
75 miles away
were running on fumes
what do we have here
whos in charge here
no one
our driver left us
to take a ride to minnesota
just like that
he just left
he wanted to go have
sex with his girlfriend
yes
all aboard
wait wait wait wait
what about ourour car
well get you a new one
when you get your license
on the bus everybody
tell the general
were up and running
bring it in
spin it around
alright
plug it in
radar is operational sir
son of a bitch
alright theyre coming in fast
david we got a real
firestorm coming our way
and not a lot of
time to prepare
give me numbers mr president
9 minutes to the
queen ships arrival
roughly 22 minutes before the
drill reaches our molten core
jesus christ
take your positions
we dont have a second to lose
are we going to make it sir
you bet your ass we will
this thing is way cooler
than the machete
