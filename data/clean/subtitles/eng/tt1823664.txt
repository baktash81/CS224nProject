my president is

front row  good news 
you re the rich people 
laugh and clap like you re
better than everybody 
ha ha  ha ha ha 
ha ha  ha ha ha 
but fdr didn t like it that everyone
was poor  so  he gave them all jobs 
he called it the new deal 
work hard  and you get rich 
so  when i tap you  you re rich 
he had people build
roads and got paid 
cut down trees and got paid 
made it easy to buy a house 
go to college 
soon  the whole country
was happy 
but don t worry  rich people

when i was a little girl 
i used to think that
they were all my friends 
sorry  that sounded very sad 
sorry 
i have a lot of friends 
so don t worry about me 
i mean  so i work a lot  i do  and
i could have some more friends 
but how many friends
do you really need 
i mean  if you were
my parents asking me 
 are you fulfilled and
are you happy  grace  
that s a whole different
conversation  right 
but we re not
having that conversation 
and  frankly  it s really not your
position to ask me that at all  so   
okay 
there she is  our own
little orphan annie 
foster kid 
she s here 
hey  this is the one  right 
all right  let s get this 
slow your roll

i never said you were   
an idiot  or 10 
truth of the matter is 
i don t know how old you are 
  ten 
  well  now we know that you re not an idiot 
but there are a lot of
people out there that are
and when they saw
that photo of us 
they thought that i would
make a great mayor 
why 
why  because i m a   
i m a rich guy 
i saved an orphan 
i m not an orphan 
i m a foster kid 
and you didn t save me 
oh  i didn t save you 
i didn t just
push you out of
the way of a van 
why don t i call that
van back and have him
finish up what he   
you know what 
the more we re seen together  the
better it is for my campaign 
wait  that s how
a mayor gets elected 
yes  insane  isn t it 
i bet if i moved in with you 
you d become president 
move in with me 
this is not that kind of party 
that s it 
that s it  that s it 
i think he wants to
tell you something 
actually  that s not a bad idea 
annie coming to live with you

from what i understand  it s
very crowded where you live 
how d you like some more space 
is that something
that you might like 
living with the richest
guy in the world

i might like 
great  perfect

taught me so much 
he s given me such
a big opportunity 
  under the glow
of the very bright lights
  i turn my face

of a thousand eyes
  when they re above
five hundred smiles

i see them in my mind 
like this part
of the track right here 
this is where my father
worked 20 hours a day 
work  and work 
and work  and work 
and then  uh  he died 
i was 12 years old 
what was he like 
i don t know 
i barely knew him 
he was always working 
and that s why i felt like
if i worked hard enough 
then that d probably
bring me closer to him 
and that s why i developed this 
well 
now  you got this 
yeah  all right  annie 
you know  this pollen
or something s got
my eyes all scratchy 
let s walk this way 
we can see where the trains go
