everybody who saw that
whoa my hairs gigantic
we can listen to
whatever you like
can you put on talk radio
are you sure you dont
wanna listen to music
i love talk radio
it calms me
so do i i loved it
when i was a little girl
i used to think that
they were all my friends
sorry that sounded very sad
sorry
i have a lot of friends
so dont worry about me
i mean so i work a lot i do and
i could have some more friends
but how many friends
do you really need
i mean if you were
my parents asking me
are you fulfilled and
are you happy grace
thats a whole different
conversation right
but were not
having that conversation
and frankly its really not your
position to ask me that at all so
okay
there she is our own
little orphan annie
foster kid
shes here
hey this is the one right
all right lets get this
slow your roll
excuse me
can we eat first it was a long drive
yeah yeah go go
yeah yeah sure lets eat
we got time for that
all right
so how are you
feeling from yesterday
so whats the hustle
what makes you think theres a hustle
theres no hustle
come on come on
uh
im 10 im not an idiot
i never said you were
an idiot or 10
truth of the matter is
i dont know how old you are
ten
well now we know that youre not an idiot
but there are a lot of
people out there that are
and when they saw
that photo of us
they thought that i would
make a great mayor
why
why because im a
im a rich guy
i saved an orphan
im not an orphan
im a foster kid
and you didnt save me
oh i didnt save you
i didnt just
push you out of
the way of a van
why dont i call that
van back and have him
finish up what he
you know what
the more were seen together the
better it is for my campaign
wait thats how
a mayor gets elected
yes insane isnt it
i bet if i moved in with you
youd become president
move in with me
this is not that kind of party
thats it
thats it thats it
i think he wants to
tell you something
actually thats not a bad idea
annie coming to live with you
what
from what i understand its
very crowded where you live
howd you like some more space
is that something
that you might like
living with the richest
guy in the world
yeah thats something
i might like
great perfect
guy what are
you talking about
listen to me itll
only be for a few weeks
then shell go back
to wherever she came from
taking in a foster kid thats an
automatic 15 point jump in the polls
guaranteed
you want me to play daddy
its easy all i need
is a bed and meals
you dont have to
do anything else
and you get 157 a week
do i look like
i need 157 a week
everybody needs
an extra 157 a week
youre not really
thinking about doing this
you want photos right
im sure theres
easier ways to get photos
not with me in them
smile
mr stacks
are you really doing this
yeah wont even
know shes there
its like having a turtle
i wonder if she has her shots
how was your lunch

sweet lord
hi
bam
you know i dont normally
do the site visits
but ive taken such
a liking to young annie
i forget sometimes you
know why i got into this
its for my files
so does the guardian have adequate
income to provide basic shelter
im just gonna go
ahead and check that box
come on in
about 95 per share
in cash and stock
detonated
an explosive while fire
whoa
oh yeah whoa
hey is there a
cotemporary guardian

would you like a
cotemporary guardian

these guys on a tour

ill come with you
will will will
okay so the state says
that you must have at least
one water source in
check
and a window thats okay
and then at least one
chair per 10 persons
and i think the  starship
enterprise is gonna count
im gonna check that box
how does it do this

then adjusts itself accordingly
its like a friend
i consider it a friend but i have
real friends that arent robots
lets forget this conversation
and the previous conversation
and start afresh
got that great
im gonna record your voice now

work and work
and work and work
and then uh he died
i was 12 years old
what was he like
i dont know
i barely knew him
