at heathrow airport
general opinion makes out
that we live in a world of hatred and greed
but i dont see that
seems to me that love is everywhere
often its not particularly dignified
or newsworthy but its always there
fathers and sons mothers and daughters
husbands and wives
boyfriends girlfriends old friends
when the planes hit the twin towers
none of the phone calls from people on
board were messages of hate or revenge
they were all messages of love
lf you look for it ive got a sneaky feeling
youll find that love actually is all around
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes
feel it in my toes yeah
love is all around me
and so the
feedback

i said over my dead body
and she said no daniel over mine
and as usual my darling girl
and sams darling mum was right
so shes going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but

of the bay city rollers
on speakers

i shouldnt be surprised and a half
s club juniors puppy love
and they called it
hes done it its official
worst dj in the world
oh i guess theyll never know
knocks
sarahs waiting for you
oh yes of course erm
great er good good
how are you doing mia
settling in fine learning who to avoid
absolutely
harry
sarah
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that youve been working here
two years seven months
three days and i suppose what two hours
and how long have you been in love
with karl our enigmatic chief designer
um
two years seven months three days
and i suppose an hour and 30 minutes
thought as much
do you think everybody knows
yes
do you think karl knows
yes
oh that is that is bad news
i just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it
like what
lnvite him out for a drink
then casually mention youd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies
you know that
yes
and so does karl
think about it for all our sakes
its christmas
certainly excellent will do
thanks boss
hi sarah
hi karl
on radio christmas is all around
mobile
babe absolutely fire away
mia mia would you turn that down
what is that
that was the christmas effort
from the once great billy mack
oh dear me how are the mighty fallen
i can safely say that is the worst record
ive heard this century
oh and coincidentally
i believe billy will be a guest
on my friend mikes show
in a few minutes time
welcome back bill
billy welcome back to the airwaves
new christmas single
cover of love is all around
except weve changed
the word love to christmas
yes is that an important message
to you bill
snorts not really mike
christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives
and thats not you
thats not me michael
when i was young and successful
i was greedy and foolish
and now im left with no one
wrinkled and alone
wow thanks for that bill
for what
for actually giving
a real answer to a question
it doesnt often happen here
at radio watford i can tell you
ask me anything ill tell you the truth
best shag you ever had
britney spears
wow
no only kidding snorts
she was rubbish
ok heres one
how do you think the new record
compares to your old classic stuff
come on mikey you know as well as i do
the records crap
bill laughing
but wouldnt it be great
if number one this christmas
wasnt some smug teenager
but an old exheroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price
those young popsters come christmas
will be stretched out naked
with a cute bird balancing on their balls
and ill be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager joe
ugliest man in the world
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didnt pay off
so if you believe in father christmas
children like your uncle billy does
buy my festering turd of a record
and particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line
i think youre referring to
lf you really love christmas
come on and let it snow ouch
so here it is one more time
the dark horse for this years
christmas number one
christmas is all around
thank you billy after this the news
is the new prime minister in trouble already
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes
ok whats next
the presidents visit
ah yes yes i fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play alex
theres a strong feeling in the party
we mustnt allow ourselves to be bullied
like the last government
all here here
this is our first really important test
lets take a stand
right right i understand that
but i have decided
not to not this time
lets not forget that america
is the most powerful country in the world
im not going to act like a petulant child
who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit
right
knocking
yeah come in
these are from the treasury
uhhuh
and these are for you
excellent thanks a lot
i was hoping youd win not that
i wouldnt have been nice to the other bloke
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate
thanks very much thanks
natalie
god come on get a grip
youre the prime minister for gods sake
so what do you reckon
to our new prime minister
oh i like him i cant understand
why hes not married though
you know the type hes married to his job
either that or gay as a picnic basket
excuse me judy if you could
just lower the nipples
and cheat them a bit to the left
ok
i have to say judy this is a real pleasure
its lovely to find someone
i can actually chat to
thank you
oh well you know
and ditto
thank you
the move again please judy
ooh sorry
oh god sorry you all right
exciting news

no
yes
to a fantastic place called wisconsin
no
yes wisconsin babes
here comes sir colin
no col there are a few babes in america
i grant you
but theyre going out
with rich attractive guys
tone youre just jealous
you know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in america
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me
than the whole of the united kingdom
that is total bollocks youre mad
no im wise stateside i am prince william
without the weird family
no colin no
yes
nyet
da
nein
ja darling
right the christmas party
not my favourite night of the year
and your unhappy job to organise
tell me
its basic really
find a venue overorder on the drinks
bulk buy the guacamole
and advise the girls to avoid kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled
wives and family and stuff
yeah i mean not children
but their wives and girlfriends et cetera
oh christ you havent got some horrible
sixfoot tighttshirtwearing boyfriend
no ill just be hanging around the mistletoe
hoping to be kissed
really
right
he now spends all the time in his room
i mean hell be up there now
thats not unusual my horrid son
bernard
bernard stays in his room all the time
thank goodness
yeah but karen this is all the time
im afraid that theres something
really wrong you know
i mean clearly its about his mum
but christ he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all i know
karen at the age of 1 1
daniel well maybe not his eyeballs then
maybe just his veins
the problem is his mum
always used to talk to him you know and
i dont know this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter
iike it never did before
listen it was always going to be
a totally shit time
just be patient
and maybe check the room for needles
and then when he sometimes does
come out its obvious hes been crying
its just such a ridiculous waste
and now if its going to ruin
sams life as well
i just dont know
get a grip
people hate sissies
no ones ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time
yeah absolutely
helpful
so whats the problem samuel
is it just mum or is it something else huh
maybe school
are you being bullied
or is it something worse
can you give me any clues at all
you really want to know
i really want to know
even though you wont be able to help
even if thats the case yeah
ok well
truth is actually
im in love
sorry
i know i should be thinking
about mum and i am but im in love
i was before she died
and theres nothing i can do about it
arent you a bit young to be in love
no
ah well ok well
im a little relieved
why
because l
thought itd be something worse
worse than the total agony of being in love
er
no youre right
total agony
night sarah

mr president has it been a good visit
very satisfactory indeed
we got what we came for
and our special relationship
is still very special
prime minister
i love that word relationship
covers all manner of sins doesnt it
i fear that this has become
a bad relationship
a relationship based on
the president taking what he wants
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to erm
britain
we may be a small country
but were a great one too
the country of shakespeare
churchill the beatles
sean connery harry potter
laughter
david beckhams right foot
laughter
david beckhams left foot come to that
and a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend
and since bullies only respond to strength
from now onward
i will be prepared to be much stronger
and the president
should be prepared for that
press clamouring
mr president
