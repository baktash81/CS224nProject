at heathrow airport 
 general opinion makes out
that we live in a world of hatred and greed
 but i don t see that 
 seems to me that love is everywhere 
 often it s not particularly dignified
or newsworthy but it s always there 
 fathers and sons  mothers and daughters 
husbands and wives 
 boyfriends  girlfriends  old friends 
 when the planes hit the twin towers 
 none of the phone calls from people on
board were messages of hate or revenge 
 they were all messages of love 
 lf you look for it  i ve got a sneaky feeling
you ll find that love actually is all around  
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes

claudia schiffer as my date to the funeral 
i was confident she expected me to ignore 
but others she was pretty damn clear about 
when she first mentioned
what s about to happen 
i said   over my dead body  
and she said   no  daniel  over mine  
and as usual  my darling girl   
and sam s darling mum was right 
so she s going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but 
inevitably 
ever so coolly 
through the immortal genius
of the bay city rollers 
 on speakers

so that s a no  then

this dj  what do you reckon

  probably 
i think it all hangs on the next song 
now here s one for the lovers 
that s quite a few of you 
i shouldn t be surprised and a half 
   s club juniors  puppy love 
  and they called it     
  he s done it  it s official 
  worst dj in the world 
  oh  i guess they ll never know     
 knocks 
sarah s waiting for you 
oh  yes  of course  erm   
great  er  good  good 
how are you doing  mia 
settling in fine  learning who to avoid 
absolutely 
  harry 
  sarah 
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you ve been working here 
two years  seven months 
three days and  i suppose  what  two hours 
and how long have you been in love
with karl  our enigmatic chief designer 
um   
two years  seven months  three days
and  i suppose  an hour and 30 minutes 
thought as much 
  do you think everybody knows 
  yes 
  do you think karl knows 
  yes 
oh  that is    that is bad news 
i just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it 
  like what 
  lnvite him out for a drink
then casually mention you d like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies 
  you know that 
  yes 
and so does karl 
think about it  for all our sakes 
it s christmas 
certainly  excellent  will do 
thanks  boss 
  hi  sarah 
  hi  karl 
   on radio  christmas is all around 
 mobile 
babe  absolutely  fire away 
mia  mia  would you turn that down 
what is that 
that was the christmas effort
from the once great billy mack 
oh  dear me  how are the mighty fallen 
i can safely say that is the worst record
i ve heard this century   
oh  and coincidentally 
i believe billy will be a guest
on my friend mike s show
in a few minutes  time 
welcome back  bill 
billy  welcome back to the airwaves 
new christmas single 
cover of love is all around 
except we ve changed
the word  love  to  christmas  
yes  is that an important message
to you  bill 
 snorts  not really  mike 
christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives 
  and that s not you 
  that s not me  michael 
when i was young and successful 
i was greedy and foolish
and now i m left with no one 
wrinkled and alone 
  wow  thanks for that  bill 
  for what 
for actually giving
a real answer to a question 
it doesn t often happen here
at radio watford  i can tell you 
  ask me anything  i ll tell you the truth 
  best shag you ever had 
  britney spears 
  wow 
no  only kidding   snorts 
  she was rubbish 
  ok  here s one 
how do you think the new record
compares to your old  classic stuff 
come on  mikey  you know as well as i do
the record s crap 
 bill laughing 
but wouldn t it be great
if number one this christmas
wasn t some smug teenager
but an old ex heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price 
those young popsters come christmas
will be stretched out naked
with a cute bird balancing on their balls
and i ll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager joe 
ugliest man in the world 
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn t pay off 
so if you believe in father christmas 
children  like your uncle billy does 
buy my festering turd of a record 
and particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line 
i think you re referring to
 lf you really love christmas    
 come on and let it snow   ouch 
so  here it is one more time 
the dark horse for this year s
christmas number one 
christmas is all around 
thank you  billy  after this  the news 
is the new prime minister in trouble already 
  i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes  
  ok  what s next 
  the president s visit 
ah  yes  yes  i fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play  alex 
there s a strong feeling in the party
we mustn t allow ourselves to be bullied
  like the last government 
   all  here  here 
this is our first really important test 
let s take a stand 
right  right  i understand that
but i have decided   
not to  not this time 
let s not forget that america
is the most powerful country in the world 
i m not going to act like a petulant child 
who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit 
right 
 knocking 
yeah  come in 
  these are from the treasury   
  uh huh 
  and these are for you 
excellent  thanks a lot 
i was hoping you d win  not that
i wouldn t have been nice to the other bloke 
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate 
thanks very much  thanks   
natalie 
god  come on  get a grip 
you re the prime minister  for god s sake 
so what do you reckon
to our new prime minister 
oh  i like him  i can t understand
why he s not married  though 
you know the type  he s married to his job 
either that or gay as a picnic basket 
excuse me  judy  if you could
just lower the nipples
  and cheat them a bit to the left 
  ok 
i have to say  judy  this is a real pleasure 
it s lovely to find someone
i can actually chat to 
  thank you 
  oh  well  you know 
  and ditto 
  thank you 
the move again  please  judy 
  ooh  sorry 
  oh  god  sorry  you all right 
  exciting news 
  what 
i ve bought a ticket to the states 
i m off in three weeks 
  no 
  yes 
  to a fantastic place called wisconsin 
  no 
yes  wisconsin babes 
here comes sir colin 
no  col  there are a few babes in america 
i grant you 
but they re going out
with rich  attractive guys 
tone  you re just jealous 
you know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in america
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me
  than the whole of the united kingdom 
  that is total bollocks  you re mad 
no  i m wise  stateside i am prince william
without the weird family 
  no  colin  no 
  yes 
  nyet 
  da 
  nein 
  ja  darling 
right  the christmas party 
not my favourite night of the year
and your unhappy job to organise 
  tell me 
  it s basic  really 
find a venue  over order on the drinks 
bulk buy the guacamole
and advise the girls to avoid kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled 
  wives and family and stuff 
  yeah  i mean  not children 
but their wives and girlfriends  et cetera 
oh  christ  you haven t got some horrible
six foot  tight t shirt wearing boyfriend 
no  i ll just be hanging around the mistletoe 
hoping to be kissed 
really 
right 
he now spends all the time in his room 
i mean  he ll be up there now 
  that s not unusual  my horrid son   
  bernard 
bernard  stays in his room all the time 
thank goodness 
yeah  but karen  this is all the time 
i m afraid that there s something
really wrong  you know 
i mean  clearly it s about his mum
but christ  he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all i know 
 karen  at the age of 1 1 
 daniel  well  maybe not his eyeballs  then 
maybe just his veins 
the problem is his mum
always used to talk to him  you know  and   
i don t know  this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter
iike it never did before 
listen  it was always going to be
a totally shit time 
just be patient 
and maybe check the room for needles 
and then when he sometimes does
come out  it s obvious he s been crying 
it s just such a ridiculous waste 
and now if it s going to ruin
sam s life as well   
i just don t know 
get a grip 
people hate sissies 
no one s ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time 
yeah  absolutely 
helpful 
so  what s the problem  samuel 
is it just mum or is it something else  huh 
maybe school 
are you being bullied 
or is it something worse 
can you give me any clues at all 
  you really want to know 
  i really want to know 
even though you won t be able to help 
even if that s the case  yeah 
ok  well   
truth is  actually   
i m in love 
sorry 
i know i should be thinking
about mum and i am but i m in love 
i was before she died
and there s nothing i can do about it 
  aren t you a bit young to be in love 
  no 
ah  well  ok  well   
i m a little relieved 
  why 
  because l   
thought it d be something worse 
worse than the total agony of being in love 
er   
no  you re right 
total agony 
  night  sarah 
  night  karl 
 mobile 
yeah  absolutely 
free as a bird  fire away 
alone again

natalie

uncomfortable about us

i m well shot of him 
  he said i was getting fat 
  i beg your pardon 
he said no one d fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks 
not a nice guy  actually  in the end 
no 
you know  erm   
being prime minister 
i could just have him murdered 
thank you  sir  i ll think about it 
do  the sas are absolutely charming 
ruthless  trained killers
are just a phone call away 
oh  god

no  right  silence is golden 
as the tremeloes said 
clever guys 
although i think the original version was
by frankie valli and the four seasons 
gr great band 
   high pitched humming 
silence is golden 
oh  shut up 
 cheering 
 press  mr president 
  over here  sir 
  what will you be talking about 
mr president  welcome 
it s a pleasure to meet you 
come through 
i m sorry your wife couldn t make it 
so is she  although she would have been
kind of lonely 
yes  pathetic  isn t it 
just never been able to tie a girl down 
not sure that politics and dating go together 
really  i ve never found that 
yeah  you re still sickeningly handsome 
whereas i look like my aunt mildred 
  very jealous of your plane  by the way 
  thank you  we love that thing 
ah  natalie  hi 
morning  ma am  how s your day so far 
   natalie giggles 
  excellent 
 sighs  my goodness 
that s a pretty little son of a bitch 
did you see those pipes 
yeah  she s terrific  at her job 
no  absolutely not  we cannot
and will not consult on that either 
that is unexpected 
well  it shouldn t be 
the last administration
made it perfectly clear 
we re being consistent with their policies 
with all respect  they were bad policies 
thanks  alex  i don t think
we re making progress here 
let s  erm    move on  shall we 
well  now  that was an interesting day 
sorry if our line was firm but there s
no point in tiptoeing around today 
then just disappointing you for four years 
i have plans and i plan to see them through 
absolutely 
there is one final thing to look at 
it s very close to my heart 
just give me a second 
i ll give you anything you ask for

er  natalie 
i hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future 
thank you  sir 
er  yes  peter 
mr president  has it been a good visit 
very satisfactory indeed 
we got what we came for
and our special relationship
is still very special 
prime minister 
i love that word  relationship  
covers all manner of sins  doesn t it 
i fear that this has become
a bad relationship 
a relationship based on
the president taking what he wants
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to  erm   
britain 
we may be a small country
but we re a great one  too 
the country of shakespeare 
churchill  the beatles 
  sean connery  harry potter 
   laughter 
  david beckham s right foot 
   laughter 
david beckham s left foot  come to that 
and a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend 
and since bullies only respond to strength
