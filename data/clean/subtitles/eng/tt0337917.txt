one step closer to being a cop

trainee  buttmunch 
sorry  he s training to be a buttmunch 
so immature  isn t he

  now you sound like mom 
and that s so terrible 
you ok 
is this a new style that the kids are sporting 
  dad  don t freak out 
  when do i ever freak out 
it s just that there are a thousand other sports
that don t involve falling 100ft to your death 
you said standing on everest
was the best day of your life 
no  no  i said it was one of
the best days of my life 
look  see  i even wore the hat you gave me 
i don t understand what the problem is
with me trying to be like you 
do we have to discuss this every day 
just till i turn 18 
ok  race fans 
here we are  the last race of the day 
drivers  get in position 
mr p  can i ask you a very serious question 
only if you want a very serious answer 
do ladies like guys
who build stuff with their hands 
or do they go for the nerds
who play computer games and stuff 
what he means is  do women prefer a low iq
Ã¼ber male who only know about spark plugs 
or do they prefer a true artist
who has both sensitivity and a brain 
that s a very difficult question  boys 
but i m afraid i m not the one to ask 
  hey  madeline rose 
  no  no 
dad  don t call me that 
  what are you doing 
  nothing  nothing 
it s an old climber s trick 
you ll have a scar 
why do you get all the cool stuff 
it s true  women love scars 
this drives maddy s mom crazy  check it out 
  that s gross 
  you can touch it 
  is this when you fell 
  yeah  100ft free fall 
ok  ok  ok 
stop touching  bad touch  ok 
  hey  stranger 
  not you too 
  now  this is a nutritious dinner 
  please  don t give me a hard time 
we just miss you  especially maddy 
and i don t wanna have to set my alarm
for the middle of the night
just so i can have a date with my wife 
would you like to go dancing 
i have to go back to work  i can t   
you have to do this first  ok 
quit messing around 
i can t hold you up  i can t   
tom  what s going on 
i can t feel my legs 
where does it hurt  tom 
can you hear me  tom 
tom 
the injury probably occurred
during his accident 
there must be something that you can do 
isn t there any kind of emergency surgery 
not here  a private medical facility in
denmark has done testing on this injury 
ok  let s go  then 
it s experimental 
and even though it s been successful   
  we ll try anything 
  your insurance won t cover it 
  how much 
  what 
how much does the surgery cost 
we ll pay for it 
 250 000 
we ll pay it  mom 
mom  tell her we ll pay it 
mom    we can pay it 
mom  tell her we ll pay it  please 
 250 000 
what happens if your dad
doesn t get the operation 
we ll go door to door  everyone
loves your dad  they ll give us money 
  i could sell my camera 
  it s  250 000  you know how much that is 
i have a coin collection 
they re rare 
what if i borrow half 
and then i can make   
no  it doesn t exceed that 
personal collateral 
we own a go kart track 
let s cut to the chase  shall we  mrs phillips 
you re not qualified
for a personal loan of this size 
i understand  but my husband is sick
and i was hoping   
yes  yes  i am aware of that  mrs phillips 
doesn t it mean anything
that i work for the bank 
but you re freelance  aren t you 
from a security company 
a company  which  under your guidance 
has been unable to provide my bank
with a fully operational security system
in the allotted time stated in the contract 
don t you have a heart 
this is not an emotional issue  mrs phillips 
a bank has no heart 
only paper in a vault 
it s strange not being able to move 
i ve been staring at the same spot
on the ceiling for the past three hours 
mom can t come up with the money  dad 
i escaped death on that climb  maddy 
20ft from the summit my gear stuck 
there was this perfect crack
all the way up to the top 
  you free climbed it 
  it was so easy 
i lost concentration and i fell 
but somebody or something was looking
out for me so i could go home  see you 
get to know what a great girl you are 
in a way that fall was the best thing
that could have happened to me 
you know i d do anything for you 
dad  we ll come up with the money 
i promise 
   200ft high steel chamber
which houses the lion safe 
the system provides the best of new
technology and tried and true security 
making harderbach financial
the most secure a bank can be 
the entire system is run on a generator 
making power loss a virtual impossibility 
meaning the system would remain safe
even in the event of a city wide blackout 
the project began in the fall of 2000 
and is the most advanced security install
to date for any bank in north america 
the halls are lined with hundreds
of motion sensitive cameras 
until the system has been fully tested 
the halls will be patrolled
after hours by attack dogs 
this all leads to the lion safe 
the safe is suspended
nearly 100ft off the ground
and is equipped to hold over  25 million
in cash and gold bullion 
safety deposit boxes line the walls of this
chamber  slated to be finished in april   
are you crazy  we can t rob a bank 
  we ll pay them back 
  how 
i don t know  i ll work  i ll do anything 
you understand what happens
if we get caught 
we go to jail forever  until we re 21 
no one will ever suspect us 
adults treat us like
we re five years old anyway 
tomorrow i ll go to work with my mom
and check out the bank 
gus  you need to find out
who the architect is of the bank
and see if you can get a floor plan or a model 
and austin    austin ll take care of the dogs 
what dogs 
  rottweilers 
  vicious killing dogs 
gus  come on  this is serious  tomorrow i ll
try to check out my mom s security system 
  mrs phillips  who s that with you 
  my daughter 
i ll try to take as many pictures as i can 
you guys  i really need you 
  all right  for mr p

going  save it  pal  license and registration

waiting for your weakest moment 
any chance you give them 
these people    not to be trusted 
my sweethearts 
maddy  i love that you wanted

but i have a lot of work to do
so i need you to keep up

the dogs 
dogs would have done all the work 
dogs and my black belt 
back to the monitor  maggot 
  is your office upstairs 
  yeah  i need to be near the safe 
whoa  that thing looks like it s alive 
it s got a motion detector

you know that s how far i fell 
yeah  i know  dad 
plus  it s illegal to steal money  you know
mom ll get fired if anyone ever found out 
i thought about all that 
but wouldn t it be worth it

how much did they get away with 
  who s this 
  she s the head of security 
three suspects  they got away on go karts 
they hit you for  250 000 
  go karts 
  we also found this in the vault room 
they used it to climb up to the safe 
  do you have the perpetrators in custody 
  not yet 
why would someone break into a safe
with  25 million and steal only 250 000 
excuse me  there she is  she is our so called
head of security  this is all her fault 
  actually  i did   
  with all due respect 
molly told you the security system
had not been tested 
really  you just got your walking papers 
didn t you  hartmann 
are you talking to me 
are you talking to me 
you must be talking to me cos there s nobody
else here  so you must be talking to me 
excuse me 
monsieur nuffaut  i must apologize
for this strange debacle  i assure you   
it s not me you owe an apology to  brisbane 
of course  if the head of security
told you the system is not ready 
then it seems like a   how do you say   
knucklehead move to have this soiree 
je suis dÃ©solÃ©  madame  the blame falls
squarely on your shoulders  on y va  chÃ©rie

mom  i have the money  we can go 
molly  what is this 
i warned him that
the system wasn t online yet 
i know 
and to prove to everyone
just how vulnerable the bank was 
i had my daughter and her two friends  
three kids   rob the bank 
if you look in my contract you will see
that i have a license to perform
undisclosed tests to the system until such
date as the system is deemed fully operable 
are you buying any of this 
yeah 
molly was authorized
to hire consultants to test the system 
this was all a plan 
a brilliant plan 
mrs phillips  is it true your daughter s
a leading suspect in the robbery 
ready 
we understand three children were involved
in a high speed pursuit  ending up here   
the details are sketchy  but it appears the
children have robbed harderbach financial   
and a source inside the bank is saying the
robbery was actually some kind of plot to   
stories are swirling  but this reporter has
learned that one of the children has a father   
the child has not been identified
but the father is registered as tom phillips 
mr phillips runs a local go kart track
and is expected to return home tomorrow 
since his insurance
will not cover his operation
