war suffering loss
on both sides
mutants and the humans
who dared to help them
fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat
are we destined down this path
destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us
or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves
change our fate
is the future truly set
theyre here
times up
sentinels
sunspot
lets go
run
go
blink no
too late assholes
dont move you mutant scum
no
flat on the ground
hands behind your head
so few of us left
professor
ive found them
professor
bobby
hey storm
hey kid
professor you made it
whenever the sentinels attack
warpath spots them
then i send bishop
back to warn us
of the attack before it happens
blink scouts the next site
and then we leave before they
ever know we were there
because
we never were
what do you mean
you were never there
she projects bishop back in time
a few days to warn the others
of the coming attack
so she sends
bishop back in time
no just his consciousness
into his younger self
his younger body
wow
this might just work charles
what might work
the sentinel program
was originally
conceived by
doctor bolivar trask
in the early 70s he was one of the
worlds leading weapons designers
but covertly he had begun
experimenting on mutants
using their gifts
to fuel his own research
this is extraordinary
there was one mutant who
had discovered what he was doing
a mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone
mystique
i knew her as raven
we met when we were children
grew up together
she was like a sister to me
i tried to help her
but only succeeded
in driving her away
she hunted trask
across the world
and at the paris
peace accords in 1973
after the vietnam war
she found trask
and killed him
it was the first
time she killed
it wasnt her last
but killing trask did not have
the outcome she expected
it only persuaded the government
of the need for his program
they captured her that day
tortured her
experimented on her
in her dna
they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation
it gave them
the key they needed
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power
and in less than 50 years
the machines that
have destroyed
so many of our kind were created
but it all started
that day in 1973
the day she first killed
the day she truly became
mystique
you want to go back there
if i can get to her
stop the assassination
keep her out of their hands
then we can stop the sentinels
from ever being born
and end this war
before it ever begins
uh i can send someone
back a couple weeks
maybe a month
but youre talking about
going back decades
you have the most powerful brain
in the world professor
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps
it would rip you apart
im sorry
no one could survive that trip
what if someones mind
has a way of snapping back
what if someone can heal as
fast as theyre ripped apart
okay spread out
take your positions
so i wake up in my younger
body god knows where
then what
youll need to go to
my house and find me
convince me of all of this
wont you be able
to just read my mind
i didnt have my powers in 1973
logan youre going
to have to do for me
what i once did for you
lead me guide me
i was a very different man then
youll have to be patient with me
patience is my strongest suit
youll need me as well
what
after mystique left charles
she came with me
and i set her on
a dangerous path
a darker path
its going to take the two
of us side by side
at a time when we couldnt
be further apart
great
so where do i find you
well its complicated
basically your body
will go to sleep
while your mind
travels back in time
as long as youre back there
past and present will
continue to coexist
but once you wake up
whatever youve done will
take hold and become history
and for the rest of us it will
be the only history that we know
it will be like the last
50 years never happened
and this world and this war
the only person who will
remember it is you
all right logan
i need you to clear your head
and to stay as calm as possible
what what do you mean
if your mind gets rocky it will
be harder for me to hold you
and you could start to slip
between past and future
what if i need to
get a little rocky
think peaceful thoughts
peaceful thoughts
do you have any good news
well you dont really age
so youll pretty
much look the same
you wont have
much time in the past
the sentinels will find us
they always do
and this time
we wont be able to run
well have no escape
this is our last chance
you really think this will work
i have faith in him
its not him im
worried about its us
we were young
we didnt know any better
we will now
see you all soon
this might sting a little
the first time
ever i saw your face
whoa
i thought the sun
rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars
were the gifts you gave
holy shit
it worked
hey whats going on
gwen get dressed
who the hell are you
hey i dont know
whats going on
youre supposed to be
guarding the bosss daughter
not screwing her
well i didnt sleep with her
no
no
i mean yes i slept
with her many times
jimmy
that wasnt me
that was the old me
i just got here 20 seconds ago
really
then what happened
to your clothes
my oh
would you believe
me if i told you
i was sent here from the future
huh
get out of here sweetheart
yeah
were gonna take care of this comedian
no youre not
youre gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas
or youre gonna wake
up in the hospital
trust me i know how
these things play out
oh because youre
from the future
no
because of these
what the hell
god damn it
peaceful thoughts
we are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures
and all the black books
are being opened
we cant support a weapon
that targets our own citizens
if these mutants
as you describe
are already living among us
then they are living
here peacefully
we havent had an
incident in over 10 years
after what happened in cuba
that was never confirmed
we have very real
enemies out there
the russians the chinese
we are talking about
a tenth of a tenth
of a tenth of our population
allow me to read
something to you
please
this was acquired by
our friends at the cia
its a dissertation
written by a mutant
at oxford university
and i quote
to homo neanderthalensis
his mutant cousin
homo sapiens
which is us
was an aberration
the arrival of the mutated
human species homo sapiens
was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin
well
now we are the neanderthal
speak for yourself
dr trask
you know when you sent our
soldiers to vietnam
without the weapons they
needed to win the war
you underestimated your enemy
you do that with this enemy
mmm
and it wont be some border
skirmish halfway around the world
this time the war will
be for our streets
our cities our homes
and by the time you see the
need for my program
it will be too late
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime
we are sorry
dr trask
but your sentinel program
it aint gonna fly
can i help you colonel
just here to give our
boys a proper sendoff
im sorry sir but we have orders
this is a quarantined area
stand aside soldier
thats an order
attenhut
at ease
what is all this
lab reports blood tests
its all getting packed up
and shipped back
where is it going
same place they are
trask industries
lets go gentlemen
im taking you out
of this shit show
shipping home
not just yet
what are you doing with those
something to make the ride
a little smoother
im transferring you
to a private facility
where we can run
a few more tests
your men are not military
private outfit
were authorized
to remand these men
hmm
these troops are going home
well colonel i dont believe you
have jurisdiction in this matter
im afraid i do son
im sorry who are you
the question is major
who are you
raven
thats not my name
i had that
i know
lets move out
come on lets go
wheres erik
im on my own now
lets go move it
hold that plane
wouldnt wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country
yes sir
youre not coming
with us are you
my wars not over
the enemy is still out there
the four privates
where did they go
they were headed
towards the tarmac
can i help you
uh yeah what
happened to the school
the schools been shut for years
are you a parent
i sure as hell
hope not who are you
im hank hank mccoy
i look after the house now
youre beast
look at you i guess
youre a late bloomer
i dont know what
youre talking about
but im gonna have
to ask you to leave
so wheres the professor
theres no professor here
youre pretty strong
for a scrawny kid
you sure theres not
a little beast in there
no hes not here
come on beast
come on beastie
no
hey
i said the schools closed
you need to leave not
until i see the professor
theres no professor here
i told you that
look kid you and i are
gonna be good friends
you just dont know it yet
professor
professor
hank
whats going on here
professor
please dont call me that
why
you know this guy
yeah he looks
slightly familiar
get off the bloody
chandelier hank
you can walk
youre a perceptive one
i thought erik
which makes it
slightly perplexing that
you missed our
sign on the way in
this is private property
my friend
im gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave
well
im afraid i cant do that
because i was sent here for you
well tell whoever it was
that sent you that im busy
thats gonna be
a little tricky
because the person
who sent me was you
what
about 50 years from now
like in the future
50 years from now
yeah
i sent you from the future
yeah
piss off
if you had your powers youd
know i was telling the truth
how do you know
i dont have my p
who are you
i told you
are you cia
no
youve been watching me
i know you charles
weve been friends for years
i know your powers
came when you were 9
i know you thought you were
going crazy when it started
all the voices in your head
and it wasnt
until you were 12
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone elses head
do you want me to go on
i never told anyone that
not yet no but you will
all right
youve piqued my interest
what do you want
we have to stop raven
i need your help
we need your help
i think id like to wake up now
what does she
have to do with this
so youre saying
they took ravens
power and what
they weaponized it
yep
she is unique
yeah she is hank
in the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants
then they began to identify the
genetics in nonmutants
who would eventually have mutant
children and grandchildren
many of the humans tried to help
us but it was a slaughter
leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge
ive been in a lot of wars
id never seen
anything like this
and it all starts with her
lets just say
for the sake of
the sake that i
choose to believe you
that i choose to help you
raven wont listen to me
her heart and soul
belong to someone else now
i know
thats why were
gonna need magneto too
erik
you do know where he is
yeah
hes where he belongs
youre just gonna walk out
ooh top marks like i
said you are perceptive
the professor i know would
never turn his back
on someone whod
lost their path
especially someone he loved
you know
i think i do remember you now
yeah we came to
you a long time ago
seeking your help
and im gonna say to you
what you said to us then
fuck off
listen to me you little shit
ive come a long way and ive
watched a lot of people die
good people friends
if youre gonna
wallow in selfpity
and do nothing then youre
gonna watch the same thing
you understand
we all have to die sometime
told you there was
no professor here
what the hell happened to him
he lost everything
erik raven
his legs
we built the school
the labs this whole place
then just after
the first semester
the war in vietnam got worse
many of the teachers
and older students were drafted
it broke him
he retreated into himself
i wanted to help
do something
so i designed a serum
to treat his spine
derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation
i take just enough
to keep myself balanced
but he takes too much
i tried easing him back
but he just couldnt bear
the pain the voices
the treatment
gives him his legs
but its not enough
hes
hes just lost too much
youre not scared of me
i always believed i
couldnt be the only one in the world
charles xavier
raven
youre hungry and alone
take whatever you want
weve got lots of food
you dont have to steal
in fact
you never have to steal again
and thats a promise
ill help you get her
not for any of your future
shite but for her
fair enough
but ill tell you this
you dont know erik
that man is a monster
a murderer
you think you can
convince raven to change
to come home
thats splendid
but what makes you think
you can change him
because you and erik sent
me back here together
the room theyre holding him in
was built during
the second world war
when there was
a shortage of steel
so the foundation is pure
concrete and sand no metal
hes being held
a hundred floors
beneath the most
heavily guarded
building on the planet
why is he in there
what he forgot to mention
uh jfk
he killed
what else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air
eriks always had
a way with guns
are you sure you want
to carry on with this
this is your plan not mine
we dont have any
resources to get us in
or out
its just me and hank
i knew a guy
yeah hed be a young man now
grew up outside of dc
he could get into anywhere
i just dont know how the hell
were gonna find him
is cerebro out of the question
we have a phonebook
i thought youd be getting
ready for your trip sir
i just came to
grab a couple files
is that a new scarf
its nice
thank you
dr trask
one second
oh
we added some names
to the paris meeting
thank you
is something wrong sir
no its nothing
would you mind
typing up my itinerary
i dont wanna miss anything
here here here
where
just stop here
all right all right
next time im driving
dont get used to it
whats he done now
i will just write you a
check for whatever he took
we just need to talk to him
peter the cops

to show your powers
what powers what
are you talking about
do you see
something strange here
nothing anybody would
believe if you told them
so who are you
what do you want
we need your help peter

to break into a highly
secured facility
and to get someone out
prison break
thats illegal you know
um
well only if you get caught
so whats in it for me
you you kleptomaniac get
to break into the pentagon
how do i know i can trust you
because were just like you
show him
thats cool
but its disgusting
built in 1943 the pentagon
is the worlds largest office building
housing more than
25000 military employees
stretched over six
million square feet
wheres the bathroom
he always needs to pee
yeah were getting broadcast
signal down here whats going on
damn it call maintenance
get them down here
fought for and captured the island
of iwo jima from the japanese empire
now this monthlong battle

the fiercest fighting
during world war
ii in the pacific
in three seconds those
doors are going to open
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us
i know thats what
im waiting for
what are you doing
im holding your neck so
you dont get whiplash
what
whiplash
dont move
youre good itll pass
it happens with everyone
you must have done
something pretty serious
what did you do man
what did you do
what did you do whyd
they have you in there
for killing the president
ah wow
shit
the only thing im guilty of
is fighting for people like us
you take karate
you know karate man
i dont know karate
but i know crazy
ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls this is a code red situation
we are evacuating
the entire floor
so that my associate and i
can uh secure the prison
who are you
were special operations cb
fbcid
perhaps you didnt hear me
when first i spoke
but it is imperative
that you understand
were in a complete
lockdown situation
we have to get you
to the third floor
oh im sorry
were you finished
they told me you control metal
they
you know my mom once knew
a guy who could do that
im sorry im just not
very good with violence
charles
good to see you too old friend
and walking
no thanks to you
youre the last person in the
world i expected to see today
believe me
i wouldnt be here
if i didnt have to
if we get you out of here
we do it my way
no killing
no helmet
i couldnt disobey
you even if i wanted
im never getting
inside of that head again
i need your word erik
nobody move
hold it right there
charles
dont move
hands up or we will shoot
freeze them charles
i cant
hands up
no
if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing
that id like to do
is to save every day
till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
if i could make days
last forever
if words could make
wishes come true
id save every day
like a treasure and then
again
i would spend them with you
but there never seems
to be enough time
to do the things you want to do
once you find them
ive looked around
enough to know
that youre the one i want
to go through time with
thanks kid
peter
thank you very very much
you take care
hey i saw your
flight plan in the cockpit
why are you going to paris
imagine if they were metal
do me a favor and return it for me
okay
and peter
take it slow
where did they dig you up
youre gonna find
this hard to believe
but uh you sent me
you and charles
from the future
how did you lose them
the treatment for my
spine affects my dna
you sacrificed your powers
so you could walk
i sacrificed my powers
so that i could sleep
what do you know about it
ive lost my fair share
ha
dry your eyes erik
it doesnt justify
what youve done
you have no idea what ive done
i know that you took the things
that mean the most to me
well maybe you should have
fought harder for them
if you want a fight erik
sit down
i will give you a fight
let him come
you abandoned me
you took her away
and you abandoned me
angel
azazel
emma
banshee
mutant brothers and sisters
all dead
countless others
experimented on
butchered
erik
where were you charles
we were supposed
to protect them
where were you when your
own people needed you
hiding you and hank
pretending to be
something youre not
erik
you abandoned us all
so you were always an asshole
i take it were best
buddies in the future
i spent a lot of years
trying to bring you down bub
how does that work out for you
youre like me
youre a survivor
do you wanna pick
all that shit up
general maybe you should slow down
we have a big day tomorrow
were celebrating captain its not every day you win
a war let alone against the american devils
im getting another bottle
excuse me
im pretty sure it was my fault
you speak vietnamese
im an interpreter
i speak many tongues
let me buy you another drink
unless youre here with someone
im alone
a bottle of johnnie walker please
youre going to the summit tomorrow
a pretty girl interested in politics
looks can be deceiving
lady
show me more baby
clothes off
whats the matter baby you dont
think i look pretty like this
fancy a game
its been a while
im not in the mood
for games thank you
i havent had
a real sip in ten years
i didnt kill the president
the bullet curved erik
because i was
trying to save him
they took me out before i could
why would you try and save him
because he was one of us
you must think me so foolish
weve always said they
would come after us
i never imagined theyd
use ravens dna to do it
when did you last see her
the day i left for dallas
and how was she
strong
driven
loyal
how how was she
she was
we were
i could see why she
meant so much to you
you should be proud
of her charles
shes out there
fighting for our cause
your cause
the girl i raised was
not capable of killing
you didnt raise her
you grew up with her
she couldnt stay a little girl
forever thats why she left
she left because you
got inside her head
thats not my power
she made a choice
but now we know where
that choice leads dont we
shes going to murder trask
theyre going to capture her
and then theyre
going to wipe us out
not if we get to her first
not if we change
history tomorrow
im sorry charles
for what happened
i truly am
its been a while since ive played
ill go easy on you
might finally be a fair fight
you have the first move
the diplomats from
all around the world
are arriving here
today at the hotel royal
its an historic day
its the uh official ending
of the united states military
involvement in vietnam
there we have the south
vietnamese foreign minister
with other south
vietnamese dignitaries
the summit doesnt begin
for another hour
the hotel has arranged
a private room
upstairs for
your special guests
that will be plenty of time
good afternoon everyone
hello thank you for coming
congratulations on
winning this war
now i know you all
have hands to shake
and photos to take downstairs
so i will get
right to the point
there is a new enemy out there
an enemy that will render
your arsenals useless
your armies powerless
and your nations defenseless
you will need a new weapon for
this war i call them sentinels
named after
the ancient guardians
that stood at
the gates of the citadel
they have the aeronautic
capabilities of a harrier jet
armed with guns
that can fire off
more than 2000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition
but size power speed
you could find that
at lockheed or boeing
no what makes the
sentinels so special
is the ability to target
the mutant xgene
a genetic guidance system
that can lock onto a mark a half a
mile away
it wont trigger unless it
has identified the target
with this weapon there will be
no human collateral damage
if i turn it on the system
couldnt even activate in here
unless theres a mutant
there has to be
some kind of mistake
my machines dont make mistakes
what are you
i assure you
no dont shoot it
i assure you
i dont know what
youre talking about
raven
raven raven
raven
charles
weve come for you erik and i
together

id see you again

a promise a long time ago
that i would protect you
wolverine
im going to keep you safe
im going to keep you
out of their hands
erik
erik
what are you doing
securing our future
forgive me mystique
as long as youre out
there well never be safe

really bad acid yeah
just hold on tight
well get through this together
oh my god kitty
shes wounded pretty bad
i got him
professor
what happened to you
i just saw someone whos gonna
bring me a lot of pain someday
wheres raven
gone
what
we have to get out of here
we want to know if theres
any sort of connection with
yesterday
the paris peace summit
was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants
the likes of which
the world has never seen
mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask
where did they come from
will they be back
and most importantly
are they friend or foe
that was london
correspondent toby elliot
reporting from the
paris peace summit yesterday
what the hell are we dealing with here
off the record
two days ago this
man erik lehnsherr
escaped from a maximum security
prison inside the pentagon
we believe that this woman
is a former associate
of lehnsherrs
they were together in cuba
the day of the crisis in 62
he was also implicated
in kennedys assassination
what about that thing
we dont know what
that thing is sir
actually we really dont
know what any of them are
yes yes we do
theyre mutants
he has the power
to control metal
last i checked thats what
most of your weapons
were made of
and she can transform
into anyone
a general a secret serviceman
even you
mr president
she could walk
into this office
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood
and thats only two of them
do we have any countermeasures
any defense
i was waiting for you
to ask me that question
thats an experimental program sir
strictly off the books
youre telling me these mutants
are out in the world
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots
many of the mutants
look like us
my sentinels can
tell the difference
i have eight prototypes
ready to go
theyre built out of
a spaceage polymer
not an ounce of metal on them
i want to make a demonstration
i want the world to know
that we can protect them
what do you need to get
these things operational
i already gave that
number to congress
unfortunately they
elected to shut me down
its going to cost a bit
more to turn them on
whatever you need
oh and one more thing
if we do manage to capture
them i would like her
for research purposes
of course
terrible thing
what is
being born like that
is it
can you imagine
looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you
yes i can
where do you think she comes from
you think she has a family
yes
she does
if i see so much
as a screw move
i will jam this
into your throat
how did you find me
you taught me well
its been a long time
since we were this close
i missed you
you tried to kill me
so the rest of us could live
what do you mean
we received a message
from the future
dont lie to me
i never have and i never will
humans use your blood
your genes
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out
i was only doing what i thought
necessary to secure our future
so whats to stop me
from killing you
right now and
securing my future
nothing
it doesnt matter anymore
they have your dna your
blood was on the street
whose fault was that
mine
ive seen their plans
theyre creating a weapon
and now they have what they
need to take it further
we have to strike now while
we still hold the upper hand
ive seen too many
friends die erik
i dont want a war
i only want the man
who murdered them
this is war
what happened to you
did you lose your way
while i was gone
are you still charles raven
or are you mystique
trask is the enemy
killing one man isnt enough
it never was for you
goodbye erik
what happened
come on
can he walk
he needs his treatment
hank i can hear them
i know its okay
can you make it stop
ill get them
hey hey
pull yourself together
its not over yet
you dont believe that
how do you know
as these go
this comes back
they all come back
look
im still here
and shes still out there
we need your help charles
not like this
i need you
we cant find raven
not without your powers
i added a little extra
because you missed a dose
charles
hank do me a favor
would you help me
to my study please
come on i got you
are you sure about this
absolutely not
this creature is extraordinary
her genes could hold the key
to mutation itself
i need more
thats all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in paris
more than blood
i need brain tissue
spinal fluid bone marrow
imagine
sentinels that could transform
adapt to any target
if i could just get
my hands on her
this girl could leap
the program forward years
decades into the future
how old is your son now major
jason
hes coming up on ten now
if you can believe it
eight years from fighting age
and how many of
our sons and brothers
did we just ship
home in body bags
maybe fifty
fiftyfive thousand
and how many more
on the other side
never before
in all of human history
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species
until now
you really hate
mutants dont you
on the contrary
i rather admire them
the things they can do
i see mutants as our salvation
a common enemy
a common struggle
against the ultimate enemy
extinction
i believe our new friends
are going to help us
usher in a new era bill
a new era of genuine
and longlasting peace
attention attention
transport departure
in two hours
repeat transport
departure in two hours
when was the last
time you were down here
the last time we went
looking for students
a lifetime ago
welcome professor
ravens wounded
she wont be moving fast
these are muscles i havent
stretched in a long time
charles
charles
charles its all right
ill go check the generator
its not the machinery is it
i cant do this
my mind
yes you can
it wont take it
youre just a little rusty
you dont understand its not
a question of being rusty
i can flip the switches
i can turn the knobs
but my power comes from here
it comes from
and its broken
i feel like one of my students
helpless
it was a mistake
coming down here
it was a mistake freeing erik
this whole thing has
been one bloody mistake
im sorry logan but they
sent back the wrong man
youre right
i am
actually it was
supposed to be you
but i was the only one who could
physically make the trip
and uh
and i dont know
how long ive got here
but i do know that
a long time ago
actually a long
time from now
i was your most
helpless student
and you unlocked my mind
you showed me what i was
you showed me what i could be
i dont know how
to do that for you
youre right
i dont
but i know someone who might
hmm
look into my mind
you saw what i did to cerebro
you dont want me
inside your head
theres no damage you can do
that hasnt already
been done trust me
come on
hey
hey logan
hi jean
kill me
i love you
you poor poor man
look past me
no i dont want your suffering
i dont want your future
look past my future
look for your future
thats it
thats it
thats it
charles
charles
so this is what becomes of us
erik was right
humanity does this to us
not if we show
them a better path
you still believe
just because someone
stumbles loses their way
it doesnt mean
theyre lost forever
sometimes we all need
a little help
oh im not the man i was
i open my mind
and it almost overwhelms me
youre afraid
and cerebro knows it
all those voices
so much pain
its not their pain
youre afraid of
its yours charles
and as frightening
as it may be
that pain will
make you stronger
if you allow
yourself to feel it
embrace it
it will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined
its the greatest
gift we have
to bear their pain
without breaking
and its born
from the most human power
hope
please charles
we need you to hope again
find what you were looking for
the powers back on
yes
yes it is
shes lost too much blood
she cant keep going like this
we have no choice bobby
we can wake him up
no
they need more time
i had
a glimpse into the past
if we wake logan now
we may set our fate
on an even darker course
they need more time
raven stop
stop running
charles
where are you
back at the house
where you should be
i need you to come home
i know what i need to do
if you kill trask
you will be creating countless
more just like him
then ill kill them too
those are eriks words
not yours
oh
the girl i grew up with
wasnt capable of killing
she was good
fair full of compassion
i have compassion
just not for trask
hes murdered too many of us
shut her down charles
get in her head
shes not letting me in
im barely holding on
im not strong enough yet
i know what trask has done
but killing him
will not bring them back
it will set you on a path
from which there is no return
an endless cycle of killing
us and them until
there is nothing left
but we can stop it
right now you and i
you just have to come home
i have to
you havent changed
at all charles
like i said
i know exactly
what i have to do
where is she
shes in an
airport boarding a plane
a plane to where
washington dc
guys theres something
i need to show you
were going backwards in time
i set the system i designed
to record any news about paris
over all three networks
and pbs
all three wow
yeah and pbs
look what i found
tomorrow in front
of the white house
the president will
make his announcement
he will be joined by secretary
of defense laird
and has even sought the help of
renowned scientist bolivar trask
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue
the white house has asked
raven doesnt realize
that if she kills trask
at an event like that
with the whole world watching
then i came a long way
for nothing
and theres more bad news
i saw in a report
they found traces
of her blood in paris
for all we know
they already have her dna
which is all theyd need
to create the sentinels
of the future
theres a theory
in quantum physics
that time is immutable
its like a river you can
throw a pebble into it
and create a ripple but the
current always corrects itself
no matter what you do the river
just keeps flowing
in the same direction
what are you trying to say
what im saying is
what if the war is inevitable
what if shes meant
to kill trask
what if this is just
simply who she is
just because someone
stumbles loses their way
doesnt mean
theyre lost forever
no i dont believe
that theory hank
and i cannot believe
that is who she is
ready the plane
were going to washington
you all right
getting there
whatever happens today i need
you to promise me something
youve looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad
but youve seen the good too
the xmen

oh dear god no
so much for being a survivor
one of them is in here
no no no
dont kill it
i need it alive
what the hell has happened
you built these
weapons to destroy us
why
because you are
afraid of our gifts
because we are different
humanity has always feared
that which is different
well i am here to tell you
to tell the world
you are right to fear us
we are the future
we are the ones
who will inherit this earth
and anyone who
stands in our way
will suffer the same fate
as these men
you see before you
today was meant to be a
display of your power
instead i give you a glimpse
of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours
let this be a warning
to the world
and to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there
i say this
no more hiding
no more suffering
you have lived in the shadows
in shame and fear for too long
come out
join me
fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind
a new tomorrow
that starts today
all those years wasted
fighting each other charles
to have a precious
few of them back
mr president sir
stand down
i said stand down
you want to make a statement
kill me fine
but spare everyone else
very heroic
mr president
but you had no intention
of sparing any of us
the future of our
species begins now
you used to be a better shot
trust me i still am
get out of my head charles
raven

the enemy today
