war  suffering  loss   
on both sides 
mutants and the humans
who dared to help them 
fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat 
are we destined down this path 
destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us 
or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves 
change our fate 
is the future truly set 
they re here 
time s up 
sentinels 
sunspot 
let s go 
run 
go 
blink  no 
too late  assholes 
don t move  you mutant scum 
no 
flat on the ground 
hands behind your head 
so few of us left 
professor 
i ve found them 
professor 
bobby 
hey  storm 
hey  kid 
professor  you made it 
whenever the sentinels attack 
warpath spots them   
then i send bishop
back to warn us
of the attack before it happens 
blink scouts the next site   
and then we leave before they
ever know we were there 
because   
we never were 
what do you mean
you were never there 
she projects bishop back in time
a few days to warn the others   
of the coming attack 
so she sends
bishop back in time 
no  just his consciousness 
into his younger self 
his younger body 
wow 
this might just work  charles 
what might work 
the sentinel program
was originally
conceived by
doctor bolivar trask 
in the early  70s  he was one of the
world s leading weapons designers 
but  covertly  he had begun
experimenting on mutants   
using their gifts
to fuel his own research 
this is extraordinary 
there was one mutant who
had discovered what he was doing 
a mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone 
mystique 
i knew her as raven 
we met when we were children 
grew up together 
she was like a sister to me 
i tried to help her   
but only succeeded
in driving her away 
she hunted trask
across the world 
and at the paris
peace accords in 1973 
after the vietnam war   
she found trask   
and killed him 
it was the first
time she killed 
it wasn t her last 
but killing trask did not have
the outcome she expected 
it only persuaded the government
of the need for his program 
they captured her that day   
tortured her 
experimented on her 
in her dna 
they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation 
it gave them
the key they needed   
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power 
and in less than 50 years   
the machines that
have destroyed   
so many of our kind were created 
but it all started
that day in 1973   
the day she first killed 
the day she truly became   
mystique 
you want to go back there 
if i can get to her 
stop the assassination   
keep her out of their hands   
then we can stop the sentinels
from ever being born 
and end this war
before it ever begins 
uh  i can send someone
back a couple weeks 
maybe a month 
but you re talking about
going back decades 
you have the most powerful brain
in the world  professor   
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps 
it would rip you apart 
i m sorry 
no one could survive that trip 
what if someone s mind
has a way of snapping back 
what if someone can heal as
fast as they re ripped apart 
okay  spread out 
take your positions 
so i wake up in my younger
body  god knows where 
then what 
you ll need to go to
my house and find me 
convince me of all of this 
won t you be able
to just read my mind 
i didn t have my powers in 1973 
logan  you re going
to have to do for me
what i once did for you 
lead me  guide me 
i was a very different man then 
you ll have to be patient with me 
patience is my strongest suit 
you ll need me as well 
what 
after mystique left charles 
she came with me   
and i set her on
a dangerous path 
a darker path 
it s going to take the two
of us  side by side   
at a time when we couldn t
be further apart 
great 
so where do i find you 
well  it s complicated 
basically  your body
will go to sleep
while your mind
travels back in time 
as long as you re back there 
past and present will
continue to coexist 
but once you wake up   
whatever you ve done will
take hold and become history 
and for the rest of us  it will
be the only history that we know 
it will be like the last
50 years never happened 
and this world  and this war   
the only person who will
remember it is you 
all right  logan   
i need you to clear your head
and to stay as calm as possible 
what  what do you mean 
if your mind gets rocky  it will
be harder for me to hold you   
and you could start to slip
between past and future 
what if i need to
get a little rocky 
think peaceful thoughts 
peaceful thoughts   
do you have any good news 
well  you don t really age 
so you ll pretty
much look the same 
you won t have
much time in the past 
the sentinels will find us 
they always do 
and this time 
we won t be able to run 
we ll have no escape 
this is our last chance 
you really think this will work 
i have faith in him 
it s not him i m
worried about  it s us 
we were young   
we didn t know any better 
we will now 
see you all soon 
this might sting a little 
the first time
ever i saw your face
whoa 
i thought the sun
rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars
were the gifts you gave
holy shit 
it worked 
hey  what s going on 
  gwen  get dressed 
  who the hell are you 
hey  i don t know
what s going on 
you re supposed to be
guarding the boss s daughter 
not screwing her 
well  i didn t sleep with her 
no 
no 
i mean  yes  i slept
with her many times 
jimmy 
that wasn t me 
that was the old me 
i just got here 20 seconds ago 
really 
then what happened
to your clothes 
my    oh 
would you believe
me if i told you
i was sent here from the future 
huh 
get out of here  sweetheart 
yeah 
  we re gonna take care of this comedian 
  no  you re not 
you re gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas   
or you re gonna wake
up in the hospital 
trust me  i know how
these things play out 
oh  because you re
from the future 
no 
because of these 
what the hell 
god damn it 
peaceful thoughts 
we are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures   
and all the black books
are being opened 
we can t support a weapon
that targets our own citizens 
if these mutants 
as you describe   
are already living among us   
then they are living
here peacefully 
we haven t had an
incident in over 10 years 
after what happened in cuba 
that was never confirmed 
we have very real
enemies out there   
the russians  the chinese 
we are talking about
a tenth of a tenth   
of a tenth of our population 
allow me to read
something to you 
please 
this was acquired by
our friends at the cia 
it s a dissertation   
written by a mutant
at oxford university 
and i quote   
 to homo neanderthalensis    
 his mutant cousin 
homo sapiens    
 which is us    
 was an aberration  
 the arrival of the mutated
human species  homo sapiens    
 was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin  
well   
now  we are the neanderthal 
speak for yourself 
dr  trask 
you know  when you sent our
soldiers to vietnam   
without the weapons they
needed to win the war   
you underestimated your enemy 
you do that with this enemy   
mmm   
and it won t be some border
skirmish halfway around the world 
this time  the war will
be for our streets   
our cities  our homes   
and by the time you see the
need for my program   
it will be too late   
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime 
we are sorry 
dr  trask   
but your sentinel program   
it ain t gonna fly 
can i help you  colonel 
just here to give our
boys a proper send off 
i m sorry  sir  but we have orders 
this is a quarantined area 
stand aside  soldier 
that s an order 
atten hut 
at ease 
what is all this 
lab reports  blood tests 
it s all getting packed up
and shipped back 
where is it going 
same place they are 
trask industries 
let s go  gentlemen 
i m taking you out
of this shit show 
shipping home 
not just yet 
what are you doing with those 
something to make the ride
a little smoother 
i m transferring you
to a private facility   
where we can run
a few more tests 
your men are not military 
private outfit 
we re authorized
to remand these men 
hmm 
these troops are going home 
well  colonel  i don t believe you
have jurisdiction in this matter 
i m afraid i do  son 
i m sorry  who are you 
the question is  major   
   who are you 
raven 
that s not my name 
i had that 
i know 
let s move out 
come on  let s go 
where s erik 
i m on my own now 
let s go  move it 
hold that plane 
wouldn t wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country 
yes  sir 
you re not coming
with us  are you 
my war s not over 
the enemy is still out there 
the four privates 
where did they go 
they were headed
towards the tarmac 
can i help you 
uh    yeah  what
happened to the school 
the school s been shut for years 
are you a parent 
i sure as hell
hope not  who are you 
i m hank  hank mccoy 
i look after the house now 
you re beast 
look at you  i guess
you re a late bloomer 
i don t know what
you re talking about 
but i m gonna have
to ask you to leave 
so where s the professor 
there s no professor here 
you re pretty strong
for a scrawny kid 
you sure there s not
a little beast in there 
no  he s not here 
come on  beast 
come on  beastie 
no 
hey 
i said the school s closed 
you need to leave  not
until i see the professor 
there s no professor here 
i told you that 
look  kid  you and i are
gonna be good friends 
you just don t know it yet 
professor 
professor 
hank 
what s going on here 
professor 
please don t call me that 
why 
you know this guy 
yeah  he looks
slightly familiar 
get off the bloody
chandelier  hank 
you can walk 
you re a perceptive one 
i thought erik   
which makes it
slightly perplexing that
you missed our
sign on the way in 
this is private property 
my friend 
i m gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave 
well 
i m afraid i can t do that   
because i was sent here for you 
well  tell whoever it was
that sent you that i m busy 
that s gonna be
a little tricky   
because the person
who sent me was you 
what 
about 50 years from now 
like in the future 
50 years from now 
yeah 
i sent you from the future 
yeah 
piss off 
if you had your powers  you d
know i was telling the truth 
how do you know
i don t have my p   
  who are you 
  i told you 
are you cia 
no 
you ve been watching me 
i know you  charles 
we ve been friends for years 
i know your powers
came when you were 9 
i know you thought you were
going crazy when it started   
all the voices in your head 
and it wasn t
until you were 12   
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else s head 
do you want me to go on 
i never told anyone that 
not yet  no  but  you will 
all right 
you ve piqued my interest 
what do you want 
we have to stop raven 
i need your help 
we need your help 
i think i d like to wake up now 
what does she
have to do with this 
so you re saying   
they took raven s
power  and what 
they weaponized it 
yep 
she is unique 
yeah  she is  hank 
in the beginning  the sentinels
were just targeting mutants 
then they began to identify the
genetics in non mutants   
who would eventually have mutant
children and grandchildren 
many of the humans tried to help
us  but it was a slaughter 
leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge 
i ve been in a lot of wars 
i d never seen
anything like this 
and it all starts with her 
let s just say
for the sake of   
the sake  that i
choose to believe you   
that i choose to help you 
raven won t listen to me 
her heart and soul
belong to someone else now 
i know 
that s why we re
gonna need magneto  too 
erik 
you do know where he is 
yeah 
he s where he belongs 
you re just gonna walk out 
ooh  top marks  like i
said  you are perceptive 
the professor i know would
never turn his back   
on someone who d
lost their path 
especially someone he loved 
you know   
i think i do remember you now 
yeah  we came to
you a long time ago   
seeking your help 
and i m gonna say to you
what you said to us then 
fuck off 
listen to me  you little shit 
i ve come a long way  and i ve
watched a lot of people die 
good people  friends 
if you re gonna
wallow in self pity   
and do nothing  then you re
gonna watch the same thing   
you understand 
we all have to die sometime 
told you there was
no professor here 
what the hell happened to him 
he lost everything 
erik  raven   
his legs 
we built the school 
the labs  this whole place   
then  just after
the first semester   
the war in vietnam got worse 
many of the teachers   
and older students were drafted 
it broke him 
he retreated into himself 
i wanted to help 
do something   
so i designed a serum
to treat his spine   
derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation 
i take just enough
to keep myself balanced   
but he takes too much 
i tried easing him back   
but he just couldn t bear
the pain  the voices 
the treatment
gives him his legs   
but it s not enough 
he s   
he s just lost too much 
you re not scared of me 
i always believed i
couldn t be the only one in the world 
charles xavier 
raven 
you re hungry and alone 
take whatever you want 
we ve got lots of food 
you don t have to steal 
in fact   
you never have to steal again 
and that s a promise 
i ll help you get her 
not for any of your future
shite  but for her 
fair enough 
but i ll tell you this 
you don t know erik 
that man is a monster 
a murderer 
you think you can
convince raven to change 
to come home 
that s splendid 
but what makes you think
you can change him 
because you and erik sent
me back here together 
the room they re holding him in
was built during
the second world war   
when there was
a shortage of steel 
so the foundation is pure
concrete and sand  no metal 
he s being held   
a hundred floors
beneath the most
heavily guarded
building on the planet 
why is he in there 
what  he forgot to mention 
uh  jfk 
he killed   
what else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air 
erik s always had
a way with guns 
are you sure you want
to carry on with this 
this is your plan  not mine 
we don t have any
resources to get us in 
or out 
it s just me and hank 
i knew a guy 
yeah  he d be a young man now 
grew up outside of d c 
he could get into anywhere 
i just don t know how the hell
we re gonna find him 
is cerebro out of the question 
we have a phonebook 
i thought you d be getting
ready for your trip  sir 
i just came to
grab a couple files 
is that a new scarf 
it s nice 
thank you 
dr  trask 
one second 
oh 
we added some names
to the paris meeting 
thank you 
is something wrong  sir 
no  it s nothing 
would you mind
typing up my itinerary 
i don t wanna miss anything 
  here  here  here 
  where 
just stop here 
all right  all right 
next time i m driving 
don t get used to it 
what s he done now 
i will just write you a
check for whatever he took 
we just need to talk to him 
peter  the cops
are here  again 
what do you guys want 
i didn t do anything 
i ve been here all day 
just relax  peter 
we re not cops 
of course you re not 
if you were 
you wouldn t be
driving a rental car 
how did you know
we ve got a rental car 
i checked your registration when
you were walking to the door 
i also had some time to kill
so i went through
your rental agreement 
saw you were from out of town 
are you fbi 
no  you re not cops  hey  what s
with this gifted youngsters place 
that s an old card 
he s fascinating 
he s a pain in the arse 
what  a teleporter 
no  he s just fast 
and when i knew him
he wasn t so    young 
young 
you re just old 
so you re not afraid
to show your powers 
what powers  what
are you talking about 
do you see
something strange here 
nothing anybody would
believe if you told them 
so  who are you 
what do you want 
we need your help  peter 
for what 
to break into a highly
secured facility   
and to get someone out 
prison break 
that s illegal  you know 
um   
well  only if you get caught 
so  what s in it for me 
you  you kleptomaniac  get
to break into the pentagon 
how do i know i can trust you 
because we re just like you 
show him 
that s cool 
but it s disgusting 
built in 1943  the pentagon
is the world s largest office building   
housing more than
25 000 military employees   
stretched over six
million square feet 
where s the bathroom 
he always needs to pee 
yeah  we re getting broadcast
signal down here  what s going on 
damn it  call maintenance 
get them down here 
   fought for and captured the island
of iwo jima from the japanese empire 
now  this month long battle   
included some of
the fiercest fighting
during world war
ii in the pacific   
in three seconds  those
doors are going to open   
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us 
i know  that s what
i m waiting for 
what are you doing 
i m holding your neck so
you don t get whiplash 
what 
whiplash 
don t move 
you re good  it ll pass 
it happens with everyone 
you must have done
something pretty serious 
what did you do  man 
what did you do 
what did you do  why d
they have you in there 
for killing the president 
ah  wow 
shit 
the only thing i m guilty of
is fighting for people like us 
you take karate 
you know karate  man 
i don t know karate 
but i know crazy 
ladies and gentlemen  boys and
girls  this is a code red situation 
we are evacuating
the entire floor   
so that my associate and i   
can  uh  secure the prison 
who are you 
we re special operations  cb   
fb cid 
perhaps you didn t hear me
when first i spoke   
but it is imperative
that you understand   
we re in a complete
lockdown situation 
we have to get you
to the third floor   
oh  i m sorry 
were you finished 
they told me you control metal 
 they  
you know  my mom once knew
a guy who could do that 
i m sorry  i m just not
very good with violence 
charles 
good to see you too  old friend 
and walking 
no thanks to you 
you re the last person in the
world i expected to see today 
believe me   
i wouldn t be here
if i didn t have to 
if we get you out of here 
we do it my way 
no killing 
no helmet 
i couldn t disobey
you even if i wanted 
i m never getting
inside of that head again 
i need your word  erik 
nobody move 
hold it right there 
  charles 
  don t move 
hands up  or we will shoot 
freeze them  charles 
i can t 
hands up 
no 
if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing
that i d like to do
is to save every day
till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
if i could make days
last forever
if words could make
wishes come true
i d save every day
like a treasure and then
again 
i would spend them with you
but there never seems
to be enough time
to do the things you want to do
once you find them
i ve looked around
enough to know
that you re the one i want
to go through time with
thanks  kid 
peter 
thank you very  very much 
you take care 
hey  i saw your
flight plan in the cockpit 
why are you going to paris 
imagine if they were metal 
do me a favor and return it for me 
okay 
and  peter 
take it slow 
where did they dig you up 
you re gonna find
this hard to believe   
but  uh  you sent me 
you and charles 
from the future 
how did you lose them 
the treatment for my
spine affects my dna 
you sacrificed your powers
so you could walk 
i sacrificed my powers
so that i could sleep 
what do you know about it 
i ve lost my fair share 
ha 
dry your eyes  erik 
it doesn t justify
what you ve done 
you have no idea what i ve done 
i know that you took the things
that mean the most to me 
well  maybe you should have
fought harder for them 
if you want a fight  erik   
sit down 
   i will give you a fight 
let him come 
you abandoned me 
you took her away   
and you abandoned me 
angel 
azazel 
emma 
banshee 
mutant brothers and sisters   
all dead 
countless others   
experimented on 
butchered 
erik 
where were you  charles 
we were supposed
to protect them 
where were you when your
own people needed you 
hiding  you and hank 
pretending to be
something you re not 
erik 
you abandoned us all 
so  you were always an asshole 
i take it we re best
buddies in the future 
i spent a lot of years
trying to bring you down  bub 
how does that work out for you 
you re like me 
you re a survivor 
do you wanna pick
all that shit up 
general  maybe you should slow down 
we have a big day tomorrow 
we re celebrating  captain  it s not every day you win
a war  let alone against the american devils 
i m getting another bottle 
excuse me 
i m pretty sure it was my fault 
you speak vietnamese 
i m an interpreter 
i speak many tongues 
let me buy you another drink   
unless you re here with someone 
i m alone 
a bottle of johnnie walker please 
you re going to the summit tomorrow 
a pretty girl interested in politics   
looks can be deceiving 
lady 
show me more  baby 
clothes off 
what s the matter  baby  you don t
think i look pretty like this 
fancy a game 
it s been a while 
i m not in the mood
for games  thank you 
i haven t had
a real sip in ten years 
i didn t kill the president 
the bullet curved  erik 
because i was
trying to save him 
they took me out before i could 
why would you try and save him 
because he was one of us 
you must think me so foolish 
we ve always said they
would come after us 
i never imagined they d
use raven s dna to do it 
when did you last see her 
the day i left for dallas 
and how was she 
strong 
driven 
loyal 
how    how was she 
she was   
we were   
i could see why she
meant so much to you 
you should be proud
of her  charles 
she s out there
fighting for our cause 
your cause 
the girl i raised was
not capable of killing 
you didn t raise her 
you grew up with her 
she couldn t stay a little girl
forever  that s why she left 
she left because you
got inside her head 
that s not my power 
she made a choice 
but now we know where
that choice leads  don t we 
she s going to murder trask 
they re going to capture her   
and then they re
going to wipe us out 
not if we get to her first 
not if we change
history tomorrow 
i m sorry  charles   
for what happened 
i truly am 
it s been a while since i ve played 
i ll go easy on you 
might finally be a fair fight 
you have the first move 
the diplomats from
all around the world
are arriving here
today at the hotel royal 
it s an historic day 
it s the  uh  official ending
of the united states  military
involvement in vietnam 
there we have the south
vietnamese foreign minister   
with other south
vietnamese dignitaries 
the summit doesn t begin
for another hour 
the hotel has arranged
a private room
upstairs for
your special guests 
that will be plenty of time 
good afternoon  everyone 
hello  thank you for coming 
congratulations on
winning this war 
now  i know you all
have hands to shake
and photos to take downstairs   
so i will get
right to the point 
there is a new enemy out there 
an enemy that will render
your arsenals useless   
your armies powerless   
and your nations defenseless 
you will need a new weapon for
this war  i call them sentinels 
named after
the ancient guardians
that stood at
the gates of the citadel 
they have the aeronautic
capabilities of a harrier jet 
armed with guns
that can fire off   
more than 2 000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition 
but size  power  speed   
you could find that
at lockheed or boeing 
no  what makes the
sentinels so special   
is the ability to target
the mutant x gene 
a genetic guidance system
that can lock onto a mark a half a
mile away 
it won t trigger unless it
has identified the target 
with this weapon  there will be
no human collateral damage 
if i turn it on  the system
couldn t even activate in here 
unless there s a mutant 
there has to be
some kind of mistake 
my machines don t make mistakes 
what are you 
i assure you   
no  don t shoot it 
i assure you

somebody gave you
really bad acid  yeah 
just hold on tight 
we ll get through this together 
oh  my god  kitty 
she s wounded pretty bad 
i got him 
professor 
what happened to you 
i just saw someone who s gonna
bring me a lot of pain someday 
where s raven 
gone 
what 
we have to get out of here 
we want to know if there s
any sort of connection with   
yesterday 
the paris peace summit   
was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants   
the likes of which
the world has never seen 
mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask   
 where did they come from 
will they be back  
and most importantly 
 are they friend or foe  
that was london
correspondent toby elliot   
reporting from the
paris peace summit yesterday 
what the hell are we dealing with here 
off the record 
two days ago  this
man  erik lehnsherr   
escaped from a maximum security
prison inside the pentagon 
we believe that this woman
is a former associate
of lehnsherr s 
they were together in cuba 
the day of the crisis in  62 
he was also implicated
in kennedy s assassination 
what about that thing 
we don t know what
that thing is  sir 
actually  we really don t
know what any of them are 
yes  yes  we do 
they re mutants 
he has the power
to control metal 
last i checked  that s what
most of your weapons
were made of 
and she can transform
into anyone 
a general  a secret serviceman 
even you 
mr  president 
she could walk
into this office   
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood 
and that s only two of them 
do we have any countermeasures 
any defense 
i was waiting for you
to ask me that question 
that s an experimental program  sir 
strictly off the books 
you re telling me these mutants
are out in the world   
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots 
many of the mutants
look like us 
my sentinels can
tell the difference 
i have eight prototypes
ready to go 
they re built out of
a space age polymer 
not an ounce of metal on them 
i want to make a demonstration 
i want the world to know
that we can protect them 
what do you need to get
these things operational 
i already gave that
number to congress 
unfortunately  they
elected to shut me down 
it s going to cost a bit
more to turn them on 
whatever you need 
oh  and one more thing 
if we do manage to capture
them  i would like her 
for research purposes 
of course 
terrible thing 
what is 
being born like that 
is it 
can you imagine   
looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you 
yes  i can 
where do you think she comes from 
you think she has a family 
yes 
she does 
if i see so much
as a screw move 
i will jam this
into your throat 
how did you find me 
you taught me well 
it s been a long time
since we were this close 
i missed you 
you tried to kill me 
so the rest of us could live 
what do you mean 
we received a message
from the future 
don t lie to me 
i never have  and i never will 
humans use your blood 
your genes 
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out 
i was only doing what i thought
necessary to secure our future 
so what s to stop me
from killing you
right now and
securing my future 
nothing 
it doesn t matter anymore 
they have your dna  your
blood was on the street 
whose fault was that 
mine 
i ve seen their plans 
they re creating a weapon 
and now they have what they
need to take it further 
we have to strike now  while
we still hold the upper hand 
i ve seen too many
friends die  erik 
i don t want a war 
i only want the man
who murdered them 
this is war 
what happened to you 
did you lose your way
while i was gone 
are you still charles  raven 
or are you mystique 
trask is the enemy 
killing one man isn t enough 
it never was for you 
goodbye  erik 
what happened 
come on 
can he walk 
he needs his treatment 
hank  i can hear them 
i know  it s okay 
can you make it stop 
i ll get them 
hey  hey 
pull yourself together 
it s not over yet 
you don t believe that 
how do you know 
as these go   
this comes back 
they all come back 
look 
i m still here   
and she s still out there 
we need your help  charles 
not like this 
i need you 
we can t find raven 
not without your powers 
i added a little extra
because you missed a dose 
charles 
hank  do me a favor 
would you help me
to my study  please 
come on  i got you 
are you sure about this 
absolutely not 
this creature is extraordinary 
her genes could hold the key
to mutation itself 
i need more 
that s all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in paris 
more than blood 
i need brain tissue   
spinal fluid  bone marrow 
imagine   
sentinels that could transform 
adapt to any target 
if i could just get
my hands on her 
this girl could leap
the program forward years   
decades into the future 
how old is your son now  major 
jason 
he s coming up on ten now 
if you can believe it 
eight years from fighting age 
and how many of
our sons and brothers
did we just ship
home in body bags 
maybe fifty 
fifty five thousand 
and how many more
on the other side 
never before   
in all of human history   
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species 
until now 
you really hate 
mutants  don t you 
on the contrary 
i rather admire them 
the things they can do 
i see mutants as our salvation 
a common enemy 
a common struggle
against the ultimate enemy 
extinction 
i believe our new friends   
are going to help us
usher in a new era  bill 
a new era of genuine   
and long lasting peace 
attention  attention 
transport departure
in two hours 
repeat  transport
departure in two hours 
when was the last
time you were down here 
the last time we went
looking for students 
a lifetime ago 
welcome  professor 
raven s wounded 
she won t be moving fast 
these are muscles i haven t
stretched in a long time 
charles 
charles 
charles  it s all right 
i ll go check the generator 
it s not the machinery  is it 
i can t do this 
my mind   
yes  you can 
it won t take it 
you re just a little rusty 
you don t understand  it s not
a question of being rusty 
i can flip the switches 
i can turn the knobs 
but my power comes from here 
it comes from   
and it s broken 
i feel like one of my students 
helpless 
it was a mistake
coming down here 
it was a mistake freeing erik 
this whole thing has
been one bloody mistake 
i m sorry  logan  but they
sent back the wrong man 
you re right 
i am 
actually  it was
supposed to be you 
but i was the only one who could
physically make the trip 
and  uh   
and i don t know
how long i ve got here 
but i do know that
a long time ago   
actually  a long
time from now   
i was your most
helpless student 
and you unlocked my mind 
you showed me what i was 
you showed me what i could be 
i don t know how
to do that for you 
you re right 
i don t 
but i know someone who might 
hmm 
look into my mind 
you saw what i did to cerebro 
you don t want me
inside your head 
there s no damage you can do   
that hasn t already
been done  trust me 
come on 
hey 
hey  logan 
hi  jean 
kill me 
i love you 
you poor  poor man 
look past me 
no  i don t want your suffering 
i don t want your future 
look past my future 
look for your future 
that s it 
that s it 
that s it 
charles 
charles 
so this is what becomes of us 
erik was right 
humanity does this to us 
not if we show
them a better path 
you still believe 
just because someone
stumbles  loses their way   
it doesn t mean
they re lost forever 
sometimes we all need
a little help 
oh  i m not the man i was 
i open my mind   
and it almost overwhelms me 
you re afraid 
and cerebro knows it 
all those voices   
so much pain 
it s not their pain
you re afraid of 
it s yours  charles 
and as frightening
as it may be   
that pain will
make you stronger 
if you allow
yourself to feel it   
embrace it   
it will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined 
it s the greatest
gift we have   
to bear their pain
without breaking 
and it s born   
from the most human power 
hope 
please  charles   
we need you to hope again 
find what you were looking for 
the power s back on 
yes 
yes  it is 
she s lost too much blood 
she can t keep going like this 
we have no choice  bobby 
we can wake him up 
no 
they need more time 
i had   
a glimpse into the past 
if we wake logan now   
we may set our fate
on an even darker course 
they need more time 
raven  stop 
stop running 
charles 
where are you 
back at the house   
where you should be 
i need you to come home 
i know what i need to do 
if you kill trask   
you will be creating countless
more just like him 
then i ll kill them  too 
those are erik s words 
not yours 
oh 
the girl i grew up with
wasn t capable of killing 
she was good   
fair  full of compassion 
i have compassion 
just not for trask 
he s murdered too many of us 
shut her down  charles 
get in her head 
she s not letting me in 
i m barely holding on 
i m not strong enough yet 
i know what trask has done   
but killing him
will not bring them back 
it will set you on a path   
from which there is no return 
an endless cycle of killing 
us and them  until
there is nothing left 
but we can stop it 
right now  you and i 
you just have to come home 
i have to 
you haven t changed
at all  charles 
like i said   
i know exactly
what i have to do 
where is she 
she s in an
airport  boarding a plane 
a plane to where 
washington  d c 
guys  there s something
i need to show you 
we re going backwards in time 
i set the system i designed   
to record any news about paris
over all three networks   
and pbs 
all three  wow 
yeah  and pbs 
look what i found 
tomorrow  in front
of the white house 
the president will
make his announcement 
he will be joined by secretary
of defense laird   
and has even sought the help of
renowned scientist bolivar trask   
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue 
the white house has asked   
raven doesn t realize   
that if she kills trask
at an event like that   
with the whole world watching   
then i came a long way
for nothing 
and there s more bad news 
i saw in a report   
they found traces
of her blood in paris 
for all we know 
they already have her dna   
which is all they d need 
to create the sentinels
of the future 
there s a theory
in quantum physics   
that time is immutable 
it s like a river  you can
throw a pebble into it   
and create a ripple  but the
current always corrects itself 
no matter what you do  the river
just keeps flowing
in the same direction 
what are you trying to say 
what i m saying is   
what if the war is inevitable 
what if she s meant
to kill trask 
what if this is just
simply who she is 
just because someone
stumbles  loses their way   
doesn t mean
they re lost forever 
no  i don t believe
that theory  hank 
and i cannot believe
that is who she is 
ready the plane 
we re going to washington 
you all right 
getting there 
whatever happens today  i need
you to promise me something 
you ve looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad   
but you ve seen the good  too 
the x men 
promise me you ll find us 
use your power 
bring us together 
guide us  lead us 
storm  scott 
jean

different countries

the president
of the united states 
my fellow americans   
today we face the gravest
threat in our history   
mutants 
we have prepared
for this threat 
in the immortal words
of robert oppenheimer

so much for being a survivor 
one of them is in here 
no  no  no 
don t kill it 
i need it alive 
what the hell has happened 
you built these
weapons to destroy us 
why 
because you are
afraid of our gifts 
because we are different 
humanity has always feared
that which is different 
well  i am here to tell you   
to tell the world   
you are right to fear us 
we are the future 
we are the ones
who will inherit this earth 
and anyone who
stands in our way   
will suffer the same fate
as these men   
you see before you 
today was meant to be a
display of your power 
instead i give you a glimpse   
of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours 
let this be a warning
to the world 
and to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there   
i say this 
no more hiding 
no more suffering 
you have lived in the shadows   
in shame and fear for too long 
come out 
join me 
fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind 
a new tomorrow

all those years wasted   
fighting each other  charles 
to have a precious
few of them back   
mr  president  sir 
stand down 
i said  stand down 
you want to make a statement 
kill me  fine 
but spare everyone else 
very heroic 
mr  president   
but you had no intention   
of sparing any of us 
the future of our
species begins now 
you used to be a better shot 
trust me  i still am 
get out of my head  charles 
raven 
please  do not make us
the enemy today 
look around you

is save the lives of these men 
you can show them a better path
