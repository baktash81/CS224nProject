grew up hidden away
in a convent
by the edge of the sea
mariejosephe
mariejosephe
her very existence
was a secret
for she was
the kings daughter
mariejosephe
from a very
early age
she was drawn to the water
much to the dismay of
the convents strict nuns
who did their best
to shelter her from the world
how often have you been
warned not to swim in the sea
very often
and my previous punishments
revoking your riding privileges
burning your beloved cello
none were enough to deter you
it is satans voice
which calls you
to the unholy sea
no
abbess it is
a simple joy of nature
silence
it is
silence i said
meanwhile
at the palace of versailles
mariejosephes
father king louis xiv
king of france
had recently returned
victorious
from an expensive war
that had dragged on for years
our troops have been fighting
with exceptional
skill and courage
it has been
the greatest honor for me
to stand beside each
france
still had enemies
and that night the man
also known as the sun king
learned that even
he would not live forever
now
where was i
few inches to the right
would have found your heart
if france loses you
it will be catastrophic
not to mention lonely for me
hmm
there is a possible solution
ive been investigating
certain properties
of an organ in a legendary
sea creature
a fish
thats your solution
if the question
is the kings mortality
this creature
could hold the key
and with that
the sun king
commissioned a risky expedition
to find the underwater
lost city of atlantis
and its fabled mermaids
believing they held
the key of life everlasting
for this dangerous mission
a courageous captain
was sent to search
the far reaches of the seas
i think i saw it
due north
are you sure
only if you believe
in the unbelievable
ready the barrels
ready the barrels
lower the nets
drop them both now
fire
fire
heave
pull
heave
up
its gonna kill us all
no
we only need the female
let the male go
so
captain yves de la croix
sent word of the amazing
capture back to versailles
on the wings
of the royal carrier pigeons
fantastic news your majesty
de la croixs ship
sails for home
in possession
of the miraculous cargo
the coming eclipse
is perfect timing
the books are clear
about these matters
and specify that the creature
must be sacrificed
right as the moon passes
in front of the sun
in order to transfer
its gift of eternal life
perhaps we should
withhold our glee dr labarthe
until we have proof that
your books are not just fiction
relax father
surely the doctor wouldnt
be risking his reputation
on this outlandish claim
unless he was feeling
very confident
port le harve
dead ahead captain
the kings
closest minister
had serious doubts
about the doctors plan
for the mermaid
and as fate would have it
he had just requested
that the kings daughter
attend the world celebration
of the coming solar eclipse
father a response from
the convent de st helene
give me the girls files
it seems the abbess cant
wait to grant us our request
and on the next day
father la chaise
went to retrieve
the kings long lost daughter
thus starting mariejosephes
great adventure
she has become
incurably defiant
immune to all discipline
your reports
over the years
have told of
a prodigious musical talent
a soul poised
in devotion to god
throughout her childhood yes
but shes become
dear abbess
i need to know
whether her talents
might be welcomed in court
you are leaving us
mariejosephe
where am i going
to a lavish
and glimmering hell
where you will
no doubt thrive
do you serve the king
no i work for the king
i serve god
are you taking me
to meet the king or god
i always heard
the tales of versailles
i never imagined
it would be quite so
magnificent
the stuff of dreams
magali please
mariejosephe dalembert
this is magali
bonjour
please show her to her room
no were not in the chateau
this way mademoiselle
sire it is the hour
boring
i can write better
music than that
maybe you should compose
your own music majesty
maybe i should be my own priest
find me a composer
whos fresh exciting
no hurry
no hurry meaning
immediately
ah
shall we start our day
forgive me father
for i have sinned
i shared my bed last night
with madame scarron
devereaux
that was madame devereaux
i dont think so
devereaux is an intellectual
shes also a brunette
forgive me father
for i have sinned
i shared my bed last night
with madame devereaux
you shall be forgiven
to have earned private
quarters so quickly
is a magnificent feat
i doubt ive earned anything
humility will get you nowhere
at court mademoiselle
color and bravado
are the order of the day
look at those girls
i dont fit in here
its my job to see
that you will
all ladies
chambers face east
so that each awakens with a
ray of the king on her cheek
its the last piece
she wrote
at the convent your majesty
i am not the one to judge
whether or not her
skills are good enough
she is not without talent
and remember
she has no formal training
im speaking of talent
the stuff one is made of
i will meet her tomorrow
and remember no one
must know shes my daughter
so how long were
you at the convent
since birth
i never knew my parents
were you taken from them
like i was from mine
no
i was left there
how poetic
trauma at the start of life
often inspires greatness
sometimes i think
the trauma was greater
for the abbess
than it was for me
your majestys
first honor this morning
is bestowed on
monsieur jeanmichel lintillac
son of the lace and export
baron pierre lintillac
i feel a sense of
awe standing here
in the light of the sun king
a light cast for all france
for all france
i come to show my gratitude
our nations gratitude
for your recent
military triumph
it is gods triumph
and our brave soldiers
in honor of your
upcoming birthday majesty
let me offer this gift
my fathers dearest possession
forged from rare
chinese diamonds
how i dislike birthdays
they remind me of mortality
it will also remind you
of your
souls immortality
your majesty
i am not worried about
my soul well not just yet
so tell me how
is your dear father
hes ready to pass
from this world to the next
i see
perhaps there is more
to do with the boy
meaning
this war has
depleted the treasury
well why dont we just turn
the boy upsidedown
and see what falls
from his pockets
he stands to inherit a fortune
youre being secretive
and enigmatic
inappropriate behavior
for anyone but me
do you believe in coincidence
or fate
why is everyone staring
appearance
is everything
appearance
yes mademoiselle
theyd rather gossip about you
than reflect on the emptiness
of their own lives
being kicked out of a convent
is hardly the making
of a fairy tale
perhaps
but the fact that the king
had you brought here
makes you an object of intrigue
second only
to some secret surprise
he has planned
for the coming solar eclipse
the king owns
the eclipse too does he
i guess when one rules
over the moon and the sun
hes entitled to schedule
their rendezvous
do you have
a favorite fountain
yes the fountain of flora
its right over there
isnt she beautiful
mademoiselle be careful
mademoiselle
the king
allow me mademoiselle
are you okay
mariejosephe
present yourself before
the king if you please
might we remove that shock
from your face
and offer a smile
do you have a genuine smile
hidden somewhere
no regrets mademoiselle
that statue is of a woman
who has caused many
to lose their balance
although
mostly men
no need to bother mademoiselle
i have another one
move into quarters
befitting my new composer
have we died
and gone to heaven
i think so
we are now in the chateau
among the truly privileged
and ive been appointed
your ladyinwaiting
its all so magnificent
if you could choose only one
which would it be
theyre all so beautiful
but
i choose my cello
my freedom
steady
hold it
the king built all this
to bring water to versailles
from the ocean via the seine
those are a system of valves
that regulate
the various fountains
there is the path
to the underground river
brings all the water here
after the male
was returned to the sea
the female fell into
a dark and lethargic trance
a seamans drunken commentary
there were two of them
yes majesty
but the male is useless
for our purpose
only the female possesses
the infinite light source
what you propose doctor
is sacrilegious
what im proposing
is revolutionary
stop the bickering stop it
i want to see the creature
as soon as possible
yes majesty
if this is real we need it
which means we need him
why are you so anxious
to make him your enemy
selfrespect perhaps
my immortality secures
the future of france
the only thing god
gives you as immortal
is your soul and you only
have one of those to lose
there must be
something you will eat
captain
bring up the creature
thats easier said
than done sire
she remains on
the bottom weakened
and traumatized
from her journey
you speak as if it were human
i cannot speak
to such things father
i only meant
she behaves like a human
shes rebellious she wont eat
its as if shes lost
the will to live
interesting
you think it chooses to die
nonsense
the creatures condition
is unacceptable
it must be brought
to health at once
well youre the doctor
im a sailor
perhaps you should remember that
before you speak
with such insolence
captain yves
you understand the creature
is the centerpiece
of the celebration
yes sire
good
then see to its full
and robust recovery
in time for the eclipse
and in return you shall
receive a royal pardon
majesty
however
you fail me
then a dark cell
will seem like a paradise
i promise
urgh
what are you doing
no one is allowed in here
what is that
i ask the questions not you
now answer me
it called me here
who called you
the creature in the water
she called you
yes
with her music
cant you hear it
i hear noise like a
dolphin or a whale
but certainly not music
i want to use
her song in my music
so that the king and the whole
world can hear in it what i do
im not sure
which one of you
is the more peculiar
please dont go
she has green
eyes hair almost like us
and she called me
from my chamber
a beautiful hairy fish called
you from your chamber
no no not a fish
i think she is a mermaid
like in the books
her music inspired this
dont fret monsieurs
a womans soul
is as musical as a mans
with perhaps
touch more vibrato
sire it is the hour
a touch of melancholy
like nothing
ive ever heard before
it seems both of this
world and another
invite our young
composer to the ball
forgive me father
for i have sinned
yes
i cant remember the exact
details of what happened
last night
i understand youre forgiven
ive become used
to pretend to put on make up
for an imaginary grand ball
mademoiselle you spoil things
dont speak
now
prepare to dazzle
magali
whats wrong
well
i look like a clown
nonsense thats how
all the ladies will be painted
well then maybe
id rather look like a man
thats also
how the men will look
majesty
may i present a somewhat
different version
of mademoiselle dalembert
i like this unique
look of yours
perhaps others will follow
oh i doubt it
you are something
they can never be
an individual
in all things i suspect
including your music
i need your help
excuse me mademoiselle
i need a brilliant suite for
the celebration of the eclipse
something regal
something spiritual
something befitting apollo
and the sun king
ah monsieur lintillac
perhaps you can offer to dance
with this young mademoiselle
i would be honored
the two newest
members of the court
one a dashing son of
frances wealthiest merchant
and an orphan
recently freed from
a convent defined by
humility and chastity
then i must humbly ask whether
such a virtuous young lady
would even know how to dance
im afraid majesty
i wouldnt know where to begin
well then mademoiselle
allow me to take the lead
a minuet
threequarter time
and
down up
up down
now kick
thats it beautiful
away yes to lead and spin
beautiful and kick
and kick
and up and turn
good and hold
thats it back
and down down
away
to lead
and ready
up turn
thats it
i am so sorry
you did fine my dear
shes very beautiful
what she is is an opportunity
just one i dont
fully understand yet
everyone
come and enjoy the fireworks
it was so amazing
the king is the most
graceful dancer
you would have loved
the fireworks
it was so spectacular
something about you scares her
perhaps its because
youre feeding her dead fish
she told you that
of course who else
who else indeed
this place is so beautiful
i love the water
you dont seem to be
afraid of it
you dont seem to be
afraid of anything
definitely not water
i grew up by the sea
it was the only place i could go
to escape the prison
of my convent
i feel the same way
about versailles
out there beyond that gate
is the sailors favorite sight
the shore line disappearing
in the distance
not knowing whats coming next
other than grand adventure
sounds wonderful
have you ever been to sea
only in my dreams
the abbess considered
even swimming a crime
a crime against who
against god
the life force
has been confirmed
as i predicted
it emanates from the heart
once the water has been drained
the creature will be killed
and the organelle removed
placing the life force
into our hands
its a lovely dress
interesting with your eyes
never seen anything like it
its wonderful to be here
with someone again
a completely different
experience
i understand you have company
here from time to time
a rumor
odd in a court
so devoid of gossip
doesnt make it false
the statue in the fountain
where you fell in
that was the last woman who
was here with me in the garden
who is she
i used to draw her
im not very good
her name was
louise de la valliere
do i remind you of her
no one reminds me of her
until you
im afraid
ive abused my authority
i questioned some of the nuns
at your convent
the ones you liked
not that theres
such a thing as privacy
oh i shouldnt think so
they tell me
that you like to ride
and you are fascinated
by spiders which is strange
because they terrified
you as a young girl
after one bit you on the leg
you cant possibly know that
im a king you know
and kings have a way of
knowing absolutely everything
you have made
a pledge of two million livre
its a hefty sum sir
even for a duchy
no cost is too great
to honor my fathers life
i see no reason
to place the duchy
into the ground
with your father
the title duc de lintillac
shall remain alive
as yours
i am touched beyond words
majesty
you didnt tell me
the fish men were so
so
handsome
exactly
the creature seems to have
recovered your majesty
it will be in perfect health
for the ceremony
good servants of france
in the memory of the export
baron pierre lintillac
who has found safe passage
to the kingdom of heaven
i present to you his son
the future duc de lintillac
whose title shall
be bestowed by me
in my supreme celebration
of the solar eclipse
for all france
for all france
one barracuda is
gruesome enough
ten will curdle your toes
we hit a pod of 300 big ones
meaner than a slamboon of
drunken musketeers
they were ramming the hull
bang
forcing us onto the rocks
and just as they were about
to tear through the planks
oh how frightening
now youll be telling us
you tore them apart
with your bare teeth
we turned sail and beat
them with the wind
the easy way out
well i think
its the clever way out
a man who fails to kill his prey
is either a weakling
or a coward
and a man who sees only
two choices is a fool
you are a worthless commoner
and you merely behave like one
thats enough
calm
your majesty
forgive me majesty
it was all my fault
serve the sixth course play on
mariejosephe
you should not be
swimming in there
her tail is sharp enough
to cut through stone
luckily im not made of stone
no i suppose youre not
why do you hate him so much
i used to sail lace
to china for his father
on our last voyage the chinese
refused to pay for half
so our soontobe duc
accused me of stealing it
and had me arrested
shame isnt it
when lies obscure the truth
it seems to be the way things
work around here
not with you
you say what you think
as do you
yes and it gets me in trouble
so you can ride
perhaps better than you
the arm is badly broken
im afraid were going
to have to amputate
no
the bone will not heal
itself mademoiselle
this is the prescribed
procedure
father please
dont let him take my arm
god will protect me
put her arm
back in a sling doctor
and review her condition
in the morning
you are out of your element
here father
if we dont act infection will
result in the loss of life
act how
majesty
he wants to take my arm
surely we can review
this situation in the morning
before taking
such drastic action
im not sure
hold your silence
may i
life is filled
with suffering my child
and you have suffered
with such grace
just rest
take care then
god is with her
even better than science
monsieur yves
shes not well
the mermaid
she wants to help
she told you
who else
the fish also speaks to you
well a manner of
speaking yes
if anything happens
ill never forgive myself
imagine how i would feel
could she possibly
have healed so quickly
apparently she is
capable of anything
she produced a golden light
majesty
and i could breathe underwater
incontrovertible proof majesty
proof
i assume mademoiselle
you have heard
of the extraordinary
powers of the creature
i grant that something
has occurred here
but what is not yet clear
you are speaking of fables
everythings a fable
until proven true
and now the creature
has chosen you
as the first to experience
her healing powers
dont call her a creature
she has a soul
just the same as you
nonsense she is a creature
and her purpose
is to serve the court
is that why shes here are you
ill and in need of a cure
i must be excused
sit father
no ones ill child
your new friend is here
to herald a brand new day
for old servants of france
you are the most wonderful
and generous monarch
by using the mermaids power
to heal the common
people of france
you have earned your
place in eternity
well
as long as its earned
and once she has completed
this wonderful task
will you then set her free
her life shall be
what god intends
the mermaid was brought here
for the king not for france
just as i was
and just as you were
i have more faith in him
than you do
perhaps but you are too naive
and you are too cynical
with all due respect
mademoiselle
what do you know of the world
that youve not seen
from the window of a convent
please do not assume that
because i havent lived
as broadly as you
that i have not lived as deeply
besides one day
i will see the world
i believe you will
i meant no offense
i thought you were
going to show me
a different side of versailles
i am look
what are people saying
about the mystery
of the kings common girl
well common girl maybe
rumor has it
she has ties to the king
what kind of ties
thats still a mystery
hey
mademoiselle
thats the fishermans house
where benoit and i live
its so sweet
sweet
sweet is not a word used
for fishermen
dashing courageous fearless
not sweet
you have a lighthouse
afraid so
its only a few more steps
the sky is so beautiful
yes but but out there
beyond the horizon
where the river meets the sea
thats where
every sailor gets his last
look at france
i can see you now
at the helm of your ship
sailing into the sunset
thats my dream
to sail away from all this
and whats your dream
i want the mermaid to return
to her home
she is certainly not of
this world
nor am i
i want to go with her
to go with her
not really but
i could swim in her light
and id outrun the fastest ship
one day i will have you
on the bow of my ship
well race the mermaid
and see whos fastest
come
theres theres more to see
this is amazing what is it
hmm
its called
the temple of love
built in honor of
a woman unnamed
the rumor is that
thank you
for receiving me majesty
there is something i must ask
for humbly respectfully
but first permit me to ask
something of you
something for france
anything majesty
even my life
oh its something
a little less drastic
i want you to accept the hand
of my daughter
mariejosephe in marriage
im overwhelmed
this would be an honor
good
well
since you obviously werent
listening at the door
you must be completely
in the dark
utterly
what do you think
does she love lintillac
does it actually matter to you
am i so
endlessly and infinitely
selfcentered
its worse
your power is so complete
youre never allowed to care
about anyone
and its rather terrible
what are you doing here
she called me
i never knew i could feel
like this
oh mademoiselle stars in
your eyes become you
father something amazing
has happened
i was just coming to tell you
later little one
the king has asked to see you
you will step forward slowly
and quietly
do you recall our conversation
in the garden
about the woman of the fountain
yes of course
the only woman
you remind me so much of her
at times i think you are her
you are
the very spirit of your mother
my mother
she had a mind
and spirit all her own
she was an individual
she was not made
for court life
any more than you are
she left for the convent before
i knew she was with child
she died giving birth
youre my father
yes
marie i am a terrible man
a very selfish man
ive cared more for france
than about you or even her
why are you telling me this
because there are sacrifices
you must make
for france
sacrifices
our countrys treasury is empty
enemies surround us
lies treachery
we need money child
the young duke lintillac
his money
when you marry him
no no
i wont marry that man
i wont
you dont have to agree child
you have to obey
of course
majesty
for all france
i prayed every night
as a little girl
for a mother and father
and now i wish my prayers
had never been answered
you must stop hoping
for a perfect world
when we live in this one
you understand things
dont you
i have experienced something
that mermaid has touched
the very fabric of my being
only god can grant us
immortality
unless you believe that hes
bestowed that power on you
i believe hes bestowed on me
the power to discover
im speaking of the soul
i love the king
by murdering an intelligent
being in his name
you are committing him
to eternal damnation
go back to your monastery
priest
worry about your own soul
and stay out of my way
i am no more afraid
than you are
heave
no
everything is in order majesty
the creature is in peak
condition for the procedure
good talk me through
yes
majesty
i can no longer keep silent
how unlike you
sit father
i know your feelings
you are contemplating
the greatest mortal sin
this is not about sin
its about science
science is not
absolute majesty
he who searches
the hearts of men
will know the mind
of the spirit
thank you for the nice line
of scripture
but unless youve talked to god
i dont believe you know
his will
perhaps not but i do know that
immortality is the province
of god alone
then who placed the mermaid
in the sea for us to capture
who called upon me to carry out
his vision of a supreme france
do not confuse divine right
and divine guidance
then let him decide matters
command me oh heavenly father
strike me down here and now
if i am about to commit
a mortal sin
now father
if my communion
with the creature
gives me eternal life
it will be gods will
carry on
benoit
they are going to kill her
i need to warn mariejosephe
tomorrow a new age
will dawn for all but us
you need to make a diversion
i do
i do
i do
sir
halt come back here
doctor i was hoping
save your breath de la croix
you were in enough trouble
but sneaking around the
room of the kings daughter
now thats a capital offense
lock him up for the night
come on keep going
there will be no music
this morning
leave your instruments
it is the hour sire
you cannot kill the mermaid
i wont let you
you wont let me
didnt the abbess teach
you any manners
here is my offer
you return her to the sea
and i will consent
to this marriage
you cant haggle with your
king like some shopkeeper
i can scarcely believe
i was so blind
as to not to see
this moment coming
you swim with her you commune
with her she is your pet
no
she is all but human
she feels her life
just as we feel ours
maybe so
but you are the one who has
proven the doctor right
you think i want this for
my own immortality
france needs a leader
who can protect her
this is ridiculous
this is murder
silence
silence to you father
your wedding is today
be ready
musketeers
whos getting married today
mademoiselle dalembert is
to marry monsieur lintillac
mariejosephe
mademoiselle
you must calm down
and prepare for the wedding
magali
please go call pere la chaise
to come hear my confession
you will do exactly
as youve been ordered
or you shall forfeit your life
drain the water
killing the mermaid will damn
his soul rather than save it
youre the only one
who can stop him
i cant
yes you can
no im sorry
i ive tried
the king has
ruled for so long
he believes he has
been given permission
by the almighty
then free me
from this chamber
so i may bid the mermaid
farewell
the king has
forbidden further contact
which is why im asking you
no im begging you father
please help me
forget whats proper
and do whats right
my reasons may be
different from yours
but the mermaid
must escape the king
no one will believe
youre going to a wedding
dressed like that
my dearest magali
you have been a true friend
i will miss you greatly
i am frightened for you
werent you the one
who taught me
that a little trauma
can inspire greatness
i was just kidding
im taking the girl
to confession
i have orders to hold her
here until the wedding
and you dare
challenge me
this is a kiss i always
thought id give to my father
god has graced you with wings
i only hope you know how to fly
secure the rope
aye
hoist the net
what
we havent got all day
benoit
you cant possibly
be doing this
we do what he says
whether we end
up in the bastille
or married for money
we do as we are told
i would never
let him sentence me
why would you
i swam
with her last night
she conveyed to me
that you were her captor
did you know you
took her from her child
no
but you knew of her mate
yes and we set him free
then you owe her
the right to return
to whatever family she has left
and have my
men face the gallows
im not asking them
im asking you
what makes your desire
to sail the sea more important
than her right to live there
the king justifies everything
you mean your father
i mean the king
are you no better than him
you said
the king cant sentence me
did you mean
i could never marry a man
i do not love
everybody out take the men
head for the ships and set sail
at once for the cliff of
le havre
what about you two
well god willing
we will see you there
lets go men
you heard the captain
lets move
we are going to need
to cross the bridge
youll ruin your dress
so i will
you will follow the directions
i gave
doctor
yes
its the girl shes escaped
her only chance is to go
through the underground river
at least its swimming
to her freedom
the water level is too low for
her to jump the retaining wall
cant you drain the water
from the chateau into the pool
if we drain the canal
and the fountains
all at once
it might work but
but what
the pipes might not hold
but if they do
theres a tributary
before le havre
which will give her safe
harbor to the sea
can you communicate that to her
she understands everything
we should get moving
we need to reverse
the water pressure
stop them
the creature
it must not escape
no
we need it alive
yves
you need to jump the wall
labarthe
yves
yves
youve interfered enough
take yves and go
now
see you there god willing
the caverns below the grotto
of thetis have collapsed
and what
of the girl
she was seen riding off
the grounds your majesty
this way to le havre
order out the ships
so theres no escape
mama a mermaid
jean you ought to have
seen a fish
mermaids dont exist
come on
mariejosephe
stop
stay stay stay
ill jump
you cant mean that
youre angry i understand
but life is so precious
no
you think you understand
you dont
then tell me
the only opportunity
ive ever wanted
was to belong to someone
i came here
fell in love
i met a mermaid
who has become
the greatest friend
and i found you
father
you dont care about me
dont say that
you dont care about anyone
but yourself
give me the chance
to prove you wrong
how could that ever be
musketeers
mark your target
its simple
you take the mermaid
she gives you life
you let her live
she saves mine
whats your choice
come get me
no
i have a clean shot majesty
were running
out of time
stand down
are you alright
yes are you
she saved me
us
youve
always been a great king
now youve become a great man
signal the ships
to retreat
you were right
its something terrible
to care for someone
bless me father
for i have sinned
in the name of the father
and of the son
and of the holy spirit
amen
you are forgiven
only love is immortal
your majesty
so
captain yves and mariejosephe
started their life together
