grew up hidden away
in a convent
by the edge of the sea 
marie josephe 
marie josephe 
her very existence
was a secret 
for she was
the king s daughter 
marie josephe 
from a very
early age 
she was drawn to the water 
much to the dismay of
the convent s strict nuns
who did their best
to shelter her from the world 
how often have you been
warned not to swim in the sea 
very often 
and my previous punishments   
revoking your riding privileges 
burning your beloved cello 
none were enough to deter you 
it is satan s voice
which calls you
to the unholy sea 
no 
abbess  it is
a simple joy of nature 
  silence 
  it is 
silence  i said 
meanwhile 
at the palace of versailles 
marie josephe s
father king louis xiv 
king of france 
had recently returned
victorious
from an expensive war
that had dragged on for years 
our troops have been fighting
with exceptional
skill and courage 
it has been
the greatest honor for me
to stand beside each   
france
still had enemies 
and that night  the man
also known as the sun king 
learned that even
he would not live forever 
now   
where was i 
few inches to the right   
would have found your heart 
if france loses you   
it will be catastrophic 
  not to mention lonely for me 
  hmm 
there is a possible solution 
i ve been investigating
certain properties
of an organ in a legendary
sea creature 
a fish 
that s your solution 
if the question
is the king s mortality   
this creature
could hold the key 
and with that
the sun king
commissioned a risky expedition
to find the underwater
lost city of atlantis
and its fabled mermaids 
believing they held
the key of life everlasting 
for this dangerous mission 
a courageous captain
was sent to search
the far reaches of the seas 
i think i saw it 
due north 
are you sure 
only if you believe
in the unbelievable 
ready the barrels 
ready the barrels 
lower the nets 
drop them both now 
  fire 
  fire 
  heave 
  pull 
heave 
up 
it s gonna kill us all 
no 
we only need the female 
let the male go 
so 
captain yves de la croix
sent word of the amazing
capture back to versailles
on the wings
of the royal carrier pigeons 
fantastic news  your majesty 
de la croix s ship
sails for home   
in possession
of the miraculous cargo 
the coming eclipse
is perfect timing 
the books are clear
about these matters
and specify that the creature
must be sacrificed
right as the moon passes
in front of the sun 
in order to transfer
its gift of eternal life 
perhaps we should
withhold our glee  dr  labarthe 
until we have proof that
your books are not just fiction 
relax  father 
surely  the doctor wouldn t
be risking his reputation
on this outlandish claim
unless he was feeling
very confident 
port le harve 
dead ahead  captain 
the king s
closest minister
had serious doubts
about the doctor s plan
for the mermaid 
and as fate would have it
he had just requested
that the king s daughter
attend the world celebration
of the coming solar eclipse 
father  a response from
the convent de st  helene 
give me the girl s files 
it seems the abbess can t
wait to grant us our request 
and on the next day 
father la chaise
went to retrieve
the king s long lost daughter 
thus  starting marie josephe s
great adventure 
she has become
incurably defiant 
immune to all discipline 
your reports
over the years
have told of
a prodigious musical talent 
a soul poised
in devotion to god 
throughout her childhood  yes 
but she s become   
dear abbess   
i need to know
whether her talents
might be welcomed in court 
you are leaving us 
marie josephe 
where am i going 
to a lavish
and glimmering hell   
where you will
no doubt thrive 
do you serve the king 
no  i work for the king 
i serve god 
are you taking me
to meet the king or god 
i always heard
the tales of versailles 
i never imagined
it would be quite so   
magnificent 
the stuff of dreams 
magali  please 
marie josephe d alembert 
this is magali 
bonjour 
please show her to her room 
no  we re not in the chateau 
this way  mademoiselle 
sire  it is the hour 
boring 
i can write better
music than that 
maybe you should compose
your own music  majesty 
maybe i should be my own priest 
find me a composer
who s fresh  exciting 
  no hurry 
  no hurry    meaning 
  immediately 
  ah 
shall we start our day 
forgive me  father 
for i have sinned 
i shared my bed last night
with madame scarron 
devereaux 
that was madame devereaux 
i don t think so 
devereaux is an intellectual 
she s also a brunette 
forgive me  father 
for i have sinned 
i shared my bed last night
with madame devereaux 
you shall be forgiven 
to have earned private
quarters so quickly
is a magnificent feat 
i doubt i ve earned anything 
humility will get you nowhere
at court  mademoiselle 
color and bravado
are the order of the day 
look at those girls 
i don t fit in here 
it s my job to see
that you will 
all ladies 
chambers face east   
so that each awakens with a
ray of the king on her cheek 
it s the last piece
she wrote
at the convent  your majesty 
i am not the one to judge
whether or not her
skills are good enough 
she is not without talent 
and remember 
she has no formal training 
i m speaking of talent 
the stuff one is made of 
i will meet her tomorrow 
and remember  no one
must know she s my daughter 
so how long were
you at the convent 
since birth 
i never knew my parents 
were you taken from them   
like i was from mine 
no 
i was left there 
how poetic 
trauma at the start of life
often inspires greatness 
sometimes i think
the trauma was greater
for the abbess
than it was for me 
your majesty s 
first honor this morning
is bestowed on
monsieur jean michel lintillac 
son of the lace and export
baron  pierre lintillac 
i feel a sense of
awe standing here
in the light of the sun king 
a light cast for all france 
for all france 
i come to show my gratitude 
our nation s gratitude
for your recent
military triumph 
it is god s triumph 
and    our brave soldiers 
in honor of your
upcoming birthday  majesty 
let me offer this gift 
my father s dearest possession 
forged from rare
chinese diamonds 
how i dislike birthdays 
they remind me of mortality 
it will also remind you
of your
soul s immortality 
your majesty 
i am not worried about
my soul  well  not just yet 
so  tell me  how
is your dear father 
he s ready to pass
from this world to the next 
i see 
perhaps there is more
to do with the boy 
meaning 
this war has
depleted the treasury 
well  why don t we just turn
the boy upside down
and see what falls
from his pockets 
he stands to inherit a fortune 
you re being secretive
and enigmatic 
inappropriate behavior
for anyone but me 
do you believe in coincidence 
or fate 
why is everyone staring 
appearance
is everything 
  appearance 
  yes  mademoiselle 
they d rather gossip about you
than reflect on the emptiness
of their own lives 
being kicked out of a convent
is hardly the making
of a fairy tale 
perhaps 
but the fact that the king
had you brought here
makes you an object of intrigue 
second only
to some secret surprise
he has planned
for the coming solar eclipse 
the king owns
the eclipse too  does he 
i guess when one rules
over the moon and the sun
he s entitled to schedule
their rendezvous 
do you have
a favorite fountain 
yes  the fountain of flora 
it s right over there 
isn t she beautiful 
mademoiselle  be careful 
mademoiselle 
the king 
allow me  mademoiselle 
are you okay 
marie josephe 
present yourself before
the king  if you please 
might we remove that shock
from your face
and offer a smile 
do you have a genuine smile   
hidden somewhere 
no regrets  mademoiselle 
that statue is of a woman
who has caused many
to lose their balance 
although   
mostly men 
no need to bother  mademoiselle 
i have another one 
move into quarters
befitting my new composer 
have we died
and gone to heaven 
i think so 
we are now in the chateau
among the truly privileged 
and i ve been appointed
your lady in waiting 
it s all so magnificent 
if you could choose only one 
which would it be 
they re all so beautiful 
but   
i choose my cello 
my freedom 
  steady 
  hold it 
the king built all this
to bring water to versailles
from the ocean via the seine 
those are a system of valves
that regulate
the various fountains 
there is the path
to the underground river 
brings all the water here 
 after the male
was returned to the sea 
the female fell into
a dark and lethargic trance  
a seaman s drunken commentary 
there were two of them 
yes  majesty 
but the male is useless
for our purpose 
only the female possesses
the infinite light source 
what you propose  doctor 
is sacrilegious 
what i m proposing
is revolutionary 
stop the bickering  stop it 
i want to see the creature
as soon as possible 
yes  majesty 
if this is real  we need it 
which means we need him 
why are you so anxious
to make him your enemy 
self respect  perhaps 
my immortality secures
the future of france 
the only thing god
gives you as immortal
is your soul and you only
have one of those to lose 
there must be
something you will eat 
captain 
bring up the creature 
that s easier said
than done  sire 
she remains on
the bottom  weakened
and traumatized
from her journey 
you speak as if it were human 
i cannot speak
to such things  father 
i only meant
she behaves like a human 
she s rebellious  she won t eat 
it s as if she s lost
the will to live 
interesting 
you think it chooses to die 
nonsense 
the creature s condition
is unacceptable 
it must be brought
to health at once 
well  you re the doctor 
i m a sailor 
perhaps you should remember that
before you speak
with such insolence 
captain yves 
you understand the creature
is the centerpiece
of the celebration 
  yes  sire 
  good 
then see to its full
and robust recovery
in time for the eclipse 
and in return you shall
receive a royal pardon 
majesty 
however 
you fail me   
then a dark cell
will seem like a paradise 
i promise 
urgh 
what are you doing 
  no one is allowed in here 
  what is that   
i ask the questions  not you 
  now answer me 
  it called me here 
who called you 
the creature  in the water 
  she called you 
  yes 
with her music 
can t you hear it 
i hear noise like a   
dolphin or a whale 
but certainly not music 
i want to use
her song in my music 
so that the king  and the whole
world can hear in it what i do 
i m not sure
which one of you
is the more peculiar 
please don t go 
she has green
eyes  hair almost like us 
and she called me
from my chamber 
a beautiful hairy fish called
you from your chamber 
no  no  not a fish 
i think she is a mermaid
like in the books 
her music inspired this 
don t fret  monsieurs 
a woman s soul
is as musical as a man s 
with perhaps   
touch more    vibrato 
sire  it is the hour 
a touch of melancholy 
like nothing
i ve ever heard before 
it seems both of this
world and another 
invite our young
composer to the ball 
forgive me  father 
for i have sinned   
yes 
i can t remember the exact
details of what happened
last night 
i understand  you re forgiven 
i ve become used
to pretend to put on make up
for an imaginary grand ball 
mademoiselle  you spoil things 
don t speak 
now   
prepare to dazzle 
magali 
  what s wrong 
  well 
i look like a clown 
nonsense  that s how
all the ladies will be painted 
well then maybe
i d rather look like a man 
that s also
how the men will look 
majesty   
may i present a somewhat
different version
of mademoiselle d alembert 
i like this unique
look of yours 
perhaps others will follow 
oh  i doubt it 
you are something
they can never be 
an individual 
in all things  i suspect   
including your music 
i need your help 
excuse me  mademoiselle 
i need a brilliant suite for
the celebration of the eclipse 
something regal 
something spiritual 
something befitting apollo 
and the sun king 
ah  monsieur lintillac 
perhaps you can offer to dance
with this young mademoiselle 
i would be honored 
the two newest
members of the court 
one a dashing son of
france s wealthiest merchant   
and an orphan 
recently freed from
a convent defined by
humility and chastity 
then i must humbly ask whether
such a virtuous young lady
would even know how to dance 
i m afraid  majesty 
i wouldn t know where to begin 
well then  mademoiselle 
allow me to take the lead 
a minuet 
three quarter time 
and   
down  up   
up  down 
now kick 
that s it  beautiful 
away    yes  to lead and spin 
beautiful  and kick 
and kick 
and up and turn   
good  and hold 
that s it  back 
and down    down 
away   
to lead 
and ready 
up  turn   
that s it 
i am so sorry 
you did fine  my dear 
she s very beautiful 
what she is  is an opportunity 
just one i don t
fully understand yet 
everyone 
come and enjoy the fireworks 
it was so amazing 
the king is the most
graceful dancer 
you would have loved
the fireworks 
it was so spectacular 
something about you scares her 
perhaps it s because
you re feeding her dead fish 
she told you that 
of course  who else 
who else indeed 
this place is so beautiful 
i love the water 
you don t seem to be
afraid of it 
you don t seem to be
afraid of anything 
definitely not water 
i grew up by the sea 
it was the only place i could go
to escape the prison
of my convent 
i feel the same way
about versailles 
out there  beyond that gate 
is the sailor s favorite sight 
the shore line disappearing
in the distance 
not knowing what s coming next
other than grand adventure 
sounds wonderful 
have you ever been to sea 
only in my dreams 
the abbess considered
even swimming a crime 
a crime  against who 
against god 
the life force
has been confirmed 
as i predicted 
it emanates from the heart 
once the water has been drained 
the creature will be killed
and the organelle removed   
placing the life force
into our hands 
it s a lovely dress 
interesting  with your eyes 
never seen anything like it 
it s wonderful to be here
with someone again 
a completely different
experience 
i understand you have company
here from time to time 
a rumor 
odd    in a court
so devoid of gossip 
doesn t make it false 
the statue in the fountain
where you fell in 
that was the last woman who
was here with me in the garden 
  who is she 
  i used to draw her 
i m not very good 
her name was
louise de la valliere 
do i remind you of her 
no one reminds me of her   
until you 
i m afraid
i ve abused my authority 
i questioned some of the nuns
at your convent 
the ones you liked 
not that there s
such a thing as privacy 
oh  i shouldn t think so 
they tell me
that you like to ride 
and you are fascinated
by spiders  which is strange
because they terrified
you as a young girl
after one bit you on the leg 
you can t possibly know that 
i m a king  you know 
and kings have a way of
knowing absolutely everything 
you have made
a pledge of two million livre 
it s a hefty sum  sir 
even for a duchy 
no cost is too great
to honor my father s life 
i see no reason
to place the duchy
into the ground
with your father 
the title duc de lintillac   
shall remain alive   
as yours 
i am touched beyond words 
majesty 
you didn t tell me
the fish men were so   
so   
  handsome 
  exactly 
the creature seems to have
recovered  your majesty 
it will be in perfect health
for the ceremony 
good servants of france   
in the memory of the export
baron  pierre lintillac 
who has found safe passage
to the kingdom of heaven 
i present to you his son 
the future duc de lintillac   
whose title shall
be bestowed by me
in my supreme celebration
of the solar eclipse 
for all france 
for all france 
one barracuda is
gruesome enough 
ten will curdle your toes 
we hit a pod of 300 big ones 
meaner than a slamboon of
drunken musketeers 
they were ramming the hull   
bang 
forcing us onto the rocks 
and just as they were about
to tear through the planks   
oh  how frightening 
now you ll be telling us
you tore them apart
with your bare teeth 
we turned sail and beat
them with the wind 
the easy way out 
well  i think
it s the clever way out 
a man who fails to kill his prey
is either a weakling
or a coward 
and a man who sees only
two choices is a fool 
you are a worthless commoner 
and you merely behave like one 
that s enough 
calm 
your majesty 
forgive me  majesty 
it was all my fault 
serve the sixth course  play on 
marie josephe 
you should not be
swimming in there 
her tail is sharp enough
to cut through stone 
luckily  i m not made of stone 
no  i suppose you re not 
why do you hate him so much 
i used to sail lace
to china for his father 
on our last voyage  the chinese
refused to pay for half 
so  our soon to be duc
accused me of stealing it
and had me arrested 
shame  isn t it 
when lies obscure the truth 
it seems to be the way things
work around here 
not with you 
you say what you think 
as do you 
yes  and it gets me in trouble 
so  you can ride 
perhaps better than you 
the arm is badly broken 
i m afraid we re going
to have to amputate 
no 
the bone will not heal
itself  mademoiselle 
this is the prescribed
procedure 
father  please 
don t let him take my arm 
god will protect me 
put her arm
back in a sling  doctor 
and review her condition
in the morning 
you are out of your element
here  father 
if we don t act  infection will
result in the loss of life 
act how 
majesty 
he wants to take my arm 
surely  we can review
this situation in the morning
before taking
such drastic action 
  i m not sure   
  hold your silence 
may i 
life is filled
with suffering  my child 
and you have suffered
with such grace 
just rest 
take care then 
god is with her 
even better than science 
monsieur yves 
she s not well 
the mermaid 
she wants to help 
she told you 
who else 
the fish also speaks to you 
well  a manner of
speaking    yes 
if anything happens   
i ll never forgive myself 
imagine how i would feel 
could she possibly
have healed so quickly 
apparently  she is
capable of anything 
she produced a golden light 
majesty 
and i could breathe underwater 
incontrovertible proof  majesty 
proof 
i assume  mademoiselle 
you have heard
of the extraordinary
powers of the creature 
i grant that something
has occurred here
but what is not yet clear 
you are speaking of fables 
everything s a fable
until proven true 
and now the creature
has chosen you
as the first to experience
her healing powers 
don t call her a creature 
she has a soul 
just the same as you 
nonsense  she is a creature 
and her purpose
is to serve the court 
is that why she s here  are you
ill and in need of a cure 
  i must be excused   
  sit  father 
no one s ill  child 
your new friend is here
to herald a brand new day
for old servants of france 
you are the most wonderful
and generous monarch 
by using the mermaid s power
to heal the common
people of france   
you have earned your
place in eternity 
well
as long as it s earned 
and once she has completed
this wonderful task   
will you then set her free 
her life shall be
what god intends 
the mermaid was brought here
for the king  not for france 
just as i was
and just as you were 
i have more faith in him
than you do 
perhaps  but you are too naive 
and you are too cynical 
with all due respect 
mademoiselle 
what do you know of the world
that you ve not seen
from the window of a convent 
please do not assume that   
because i haven t lived
as broadly as you
that i have not lived as deeply 
besides  one day
i will see the world 
i believe you will 
i meant no offense 
i thought you were
going to show me
a different side of versailles 
i am  look 
what are people saying
about the mystery
of the king s common girl 
well  common girl  maybe 
rumor has it 
she has ties to the king 
what kind of ties 
that s still a mystery 
hey 
mademoiselle 
that s the fisherman s house 
where benoit and i live 
it s so sweet 
sweet 
sweet is not a word used
for fishermen 
dashing  courageous  fearless 
not sweet 
you have a lighthouse 
afraid so 
it s only a few more steps 
the sky is so beautiful 
yes  but    but out there 
beyond the horizon
where the river meets the sea 
that s where   
every sailor gets his last
look at france 
i can see you now 
at the helm of your ship 
sailing into the sunset 
that s my dream 
to sail away from all this 
and what s your dream 
i want the mermaid to return
to her home 
she is certainly not of
this world 
nor am i 
i want to go with her 
to go with her 
not really  but
i could swim in her light
and i d outrun the fastest ship 
one day  i will have you
on the bow of my ship 
we ll race the mermaid
and see who s fastest 
come 
there s    there s more to see 
  this is amazing  what is it 
  hmm 
it s called
the temple of love   
built in honor of
a woman unnamed 
the rumor is that   
thank you
for receiving me  majesty 
there is something i must ask
for humbly  respectfully   
but first  permit me to ask
something of you 
something for france 
anything  majesty 
even my life 
oh  it s something
a little less drastic 
i want you to accept the hand
of my daughter 
marie josephe in marriage 
i m overwhelmed 
this would be an honor 
good 
well   
since you obviously weren t
listening at the door
you must be completely
in the dark 
utterly 
  what do you think 
  does she love lintillac 
does it actually matter to you 
am i so   
endlessly and infinitely
self centered 
it s worse 
your power is so complete 
you re never allowed to care
about anyone 
and it s rather terrible 
  what are you doing here 
  she called me 
i never knew i could feel
like this 
oh  mademoiselle  stars in
your eyes become you 
father  something amazing
has happened 
  i was just coming to tell you 
  later  little one 
the king has asked to see you 
you will step forward slowly   
and quietly 
do you recall our conversation
in the garden 
about the woman of the fountain 
yes  of course 
the only woman   
you remind me so much of her 
at times i think you are her 
you are   
the very spirit of your mother 
my mother 
she had a mind
and spirit all her own 
she was an individual 
she was not made
for court life   
any more than you are 
she left for the convent before
i knew she was with child 
she died  giving birth 
  you re my father 
  yes 
marie  i am a terrible man 
a very selfish man 
i ve cared more for france
than about you or even her 
why are you telling me this 
because there are sacrifices
you must make   
for france 
sacrifices 
our country s treasury is empty 
enemies surround us 
lies  treachery 
we need money  child 
the young duke lintillac   
his money   
when you marry him   
no  no 
i won t marry that man 
i won t 
you don t have to agree  child 
you have to obey 
of course 
majesty 
for all france 
i prayed every night
as a little girl
for a mother and father   
and now i wish my prayers
had never been answered 
you must stop hoping
for a perfect world   
when we live in this one 
you understand things 
don t you 
i have experienced something 
that mermaid has touched
the very fabric of my being 
only god can grant us
immortality
unless you believe that he s
bestowed that power on you 
i believe he s bestowed on me
the power to discover 
i m speaking of the soul 
i love the king 
by murdering an intelligent
being in his name 
you are committing him
to eternal damnation 
go back to your monastery 
priest 
worry about your own soul   
and stay out of my way 
i am no more afraid
than you are 
heave 
no 
everything is in order  majesty 
the creature is in peak
condition for the procedure 
  good  talk me through 
  yes 
majesty 
i can no longer keep silent 
how unlike you 
sit  father 
i know your feelings 
you are contemplating 
the greatest mortal sin 
this is not about sin 
it s about science 
science is not
absolute  majesty 
he who searches
the hearts of men
will know the mind
of the spirit 
thank you for the nice line
of scripture 
but unless you ve talked to god 
i don t believe you know
his will 
perhaps not  but i do know that
immortality is the province
of god alone 
then who placed the mermaid
in the sea for us to capture 
who called upon me to carry out
his vision of a supreme france 
do not confuse divine right
and divine guidance 
then  let him decide matters 
command me  oh heavenly father 
strike me down here and now
if i am about to commit
a mortal sin 
now  father 
if my communion
with the creature
gives me eternal life 
it will be god s will 
carry on 
benoit 
they are going to kill her 
i need to warn marie josephe 
tomorrow a new age
will dawn for all but us 
you need to make a diversion 
i do 
i do 
i do 
sir   
halt  come back here 
doctor  i was hoping   
save your breath  de la croix 
you were in enough trouble 
but sneaking around the
room of the king s daughter   
now  that s a capital offense 
lock him up for the night 
come on  keep going 
there will be no music
this morning 
leave your instruments 
it is the hour  sire 
you cannot kill the mermaid 
i won t let you 
you won t let me 
didn t the abbess teach
you any manners 
here is my offer   
you return her to the sea
and i will consent
to this marriage 
you can t haggle with your
king like some shopkeeper 
i can scarcely believe
i was so blind
as to not to see
this moment coming 
you swim with her  you commune
with her  she is your pet 
no 
she is all but human 
she feels her life
just as we feel ours 
maybe so 
but you are the one who has
proven the doctor right 
you think i want this for
my own immortality 
france needs a leader
who can protect her 
this is ridiculous 
this is murder 
  silence 
  silence to you  father 
your wedding is today 
be ready 
musketeers 
who s getting married today 
mademoiselle d alembert is
to marry monsieur lintillac 
marie josephe    
mademoiselle 
you must calm down
and prepare for the wedding 
magali 
please go call pere la chaise
to come hear my confession 
you will do exactly
as you ve been ordered 
or you shall forfeit your life 
drain the water 
killing the mermaid will damn
his soul rather than save it 
you re the only one
who can stop him 
  i can t 
  yes  you can 
no  i m sorry 
i    i ve tried 
the king has
ruled for so long 
he believes he has
been given permission
by the almighty 
then free me
from this chamber
so i may bid the mermaid
farewell 
the king has
forbidden further contact 
which is why i m asking you 
no  i m begging you  father 
please help me 
forget what s proper 
and do what s right 
my reasons may be
different from yours   
but the mermaid
must escape the king 
no one will believe
you re going to a wedding   
dressed like that 
my dearest magali   
you have been a true friend 
i will miss you greatly 
i am frightened for you 
weren t you the one
who taught me
that a little trauma
can inspire greatness 
i was just kidding 
i m taking the girl
to confession 
i have orders to hold her
here until the wedding 
and you dare   
challenge    me 
this is a kiss i always
thought i d give to my father 
god has graced you with wings 
i only hope you know how to fly 
  secure the rope 
  aye 
hoist the net 
what 
we haven t got all day 
benoit 
you can t possibly
be doing this 
we do what he says 
whether we end
up in the bastille
or married for money 
we do as we are told 
i would never
let him sentence me 
why would you 
i swam
with her last night 
she conveyed to me
that you were her captor 
did you know you
took her from her child 
  no 
  but you knew of her mate 
yes  and we set him free 
then you owe her
the right to return
to whatever family she has left 
and have my
men face the gallows 
i m not asking them 
i m asking you 
what makes your desire
to sail the sea more important
than her right to live there 
the king justifies everything 
you mean your father 
i mean the king 
are you no better than him 
you said 
the king can t sentence me 
did you mean   
i could never marry a man
i do not love 
everybody out  take the men 
head for the ships and set sail
at once for the cliff of
le havre 
what about you two 
well  god willing 
we will see you there 
let s go  men 
you heard the captain 
let s move 
we are going to need
to cross the bridge 
you ll ruin your dress 
so i will 
you will follow the directions
i gave   
  doctor 
  yes 
it s the girl  she s escaped 
her only chance is to go
through the underground river 
at least it s swimming
to her freedom 
the water level is too low for
her to jump the retaining wall 
can t you drain the water
from the chateau into the pool 
if we drain the canal
and the fountains
all at once 
it might work but   
but what 
the pipes might not hold 
but if they do 
there s a tributary
before le havre
which will give her safe
harbor to the sea 
can you communicate that to her 
she understands everything 
we should get moving 
we need to reverse
the water pressure 
stop them 
the creature 
it must not escape 
no 
we need it alive 
yves 
you need to jump the wall 
labarthe 
yves 
yves 
you ve interfered enough 
take yves and go 
now 
see you there  god willing 
the caverns below the grotto
of thetis have collapsed 
and what
of the girl 
she was seen riding off
the grounds  your majesty 
this way to le havre 
order out the ships 
so there s no escape 
mama  a mermaid 
jean  you ought to have
seen a fish 
mermaids don t exist 
come on 
marie josephe 
stop 
stay  stay  stay 
i ll jump 
you can t mean that 
you re angry  i understand 
  but life is so precious 
  no 
you think you understand 
you don t 
then tell me 
the only opportunity
i ve ever wanted
was to belong to someone 
i came here   
fell in love 
i met a mermaid
who has become
the greatest friend 
and i found you   
father 
you don t care about me 
don t say that 
you don t care about anyone 
but yourself 
give me the chance
to prove you wrong 
how could that ever be 
musketeers   
mark your target 
it s simple 
you take the mermaid 
she gives you life 
you let her live   
she saves mine 
what s your choice 
come get me 
no 
i have a clean shot  majesty 
we re running
out of time 
stand down 
are you alright 
yes  are you 
she saved me 
us 
you ve
always been a great king 
now you ve become a great man 
signal the ships
to retreat 
you were right 
it s something terrible   
to care for someone 
bless me  father 
for i have sinned   
in the name of the father 
and of the son 
and of the holy spirit 
amen 
you are forgiven 
only love is immortal 
your majesty 
so 
captain yves and marie josephe
started their life together
