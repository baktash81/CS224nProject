and on loan to socom
from the royal marines
i know you
cashed in some chips for this joe
glad i could help just make it good
this is the target and the location
snatch and grab live capture
youll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance
but live fire is for backup only
we got local out there
but we want it tight and quiet
is he a fighter
your target is a fugitive
from the us government
who stole military secrets
he is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists
a military officer an idaho state trooper
and possibly two canadian hunters
so dont wait to see if hes a fighter
tranq him and bring him back

i knew something was different
before i got the shot off
he had it on him when he bolted
is that a girlfriend she helps him maybe
she is no longer a factor
we closed that door to him a long time ago
hes alone
he wants to be alone
but see if hes been talking to anybody
forgive me sir
doesnt anybody want to talk
about what went down in there cause
he didnt lose us
and he was not alone sir we had him
and then something hit us something
something big hit us
it threw a forklift truck like it was a softball
it was the most powerful thing
ive ever seen
well its gone
well if banner knows what it is
im gonna track him down
im gonna put my foot on his throat
and im gonna
that was banner
it
was banner
you have to explain that statement sir
no i dont
youve done a good job
pack up and get our men on a plane
were going home
wait
please
where am i
ive run into bad situations
on crap missions before
ive seen good men go down
purely because someone didnt let us know
what we were walking into
ive moved on to the next one
because thats what we do right
i mean thats the job
but this
this is a whole new level of weird
and i dont feel inclined
to step away from it
so if youre taking another crack at him
i want in
and with respect you should be looking
for a team thats prepped and ready to fight
because if that thing shows up again
youre gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants
sir
tienes m√°s stretchy
yeah perfecto
let me emphasise
that what im about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive
both to me personally and the army
youre aware that weve got an
infantry weapons development programme
well in wwii they initiated a subprogram
for biotech force enhancement
yeah super soldier
yes
an oversimplification but yes
and i dusted it off got em doing
serious work again bold work
across the hall
they were trying to arm you better
we were tryin to make you better
banners work was very early phase
it wasnt even weapons application
he thought he was working
on radiation resistance
i would never have told him
what the project really was
but he was so sure of what he was onto
that he tested it on himself
and something went very wrong
or it went very right
as far as im concerned that mans
whole body is the property of the us army
you said he wasnt working
on weapons right
no
but you were you were werent you
you were trying other things
one serum we developed
was very promising
so why did he run
hes a scientist
he is not one of us
blonsky how old are you 45
39
it takes a toll doesnt it
yes it does
so get out of the trenches
you should be a colonel by now
with your record
no im a fighter
ill be one for as long as i can
you know if i could take what i know now
put it in the body i had ten years ago
that would be someone
i wouldnt want to fight
i could probably arrange
something like that
take care kids
stan i give you my word
whatever youve heard about me
its not true
oh i know it i always knew it
i mean you know how i felt about you two

i havent spoken to him in a couple of years
you have to be sure
bruce i dont understand why we cant
just go in there together and talk to him
he told me what he wanted to do
he wants it out of me
he wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it
he wants to make it a weapon
hi

you know its a point
of professional pride with me
that i can always tell
when somebodys lying
and you are
i dont know where hes going
i know shell help him if she can
then shes aiding a fugitive
and i cant help either one of them
i used to wonder
why she never talked about you

bruce
bruce
its okay its okay
come here come this way
watch your head
okay
were okay
its okay
its just the rain
will he ever walk again

hes got a heart like a machine
never seen anything like it
outside of a racehorse
here
okay
bruce
oh hi
are you okay
yeah
yeah actually i feel a lot better
good
i just had to get my data back
you ate it
well you know the circumstances
called for a little improvisation
wow
okay so they didnt have a great selection
but i got you some options
first things first
oh youre kidding me
what
no
they were the stretchiest pair they had
ill take my chances
rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the us military
and an unknown adversary
on the campus of culver university
earlier today
sophomores jack mcghee and jim wilson
witnessed some of the battle
it was so big
it was like this huge like hulk
yeah
mcghee who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper
captured this on his cell phone
further search for the mysterious hulk
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the smoky mountain national forest
not too short back there
i have done this before you know
i dont know how youve done this
on your own for all this time
with clippers usually
wait wait wait wait
what what
we cant do this
its okay i want to
no
no
i cant
i cant get too excited
not even a little excited
its okay
sir its blonsky
has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family
ask him yourself
sir
good to see you back on your feet soldier
thank you sir
how do you feel
pissed off and ready for round three
basically we cant use any of this
because they can track all of it
well my lip gloss can they track that
no you can take your lip gloss
thank you
well i need my glasses
well you can take
your glasses and your watch okay
okay
we can use most of it we just cant use
the credit cards the id or the phone
dont even turn that on
okay
and well take the cash obviously
how will we get where we need to go
on 40 and no credit cards
well we could sell this
no no thats the only thing
you have left from her no
well well have to try and get it back
federal is
already monitoring phones
plastic and dr rosss web accounts
and local pd have been placed on alert
theyll pop up somewhere
and when they do it comes straight to us
theyre not gonna just pop up
he made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes
hes not gonna use a damn credit card now
if he was trying to escape
hed be long gone
hes not trying to escape this time
hes looking for help
and thats how were gonna get him
we know what theyre after and we know
hes been talking to somebody
you all have copies of the correspondence
the aliases mr green and mr blue
have been added to the
shield operations database
if he comes up for air well be waiting
if he makes a peep well hear him
and when he slips up well be ready
hey
smile
what is it like
when it happens what do you experience
remember those experiments
we volunteered for at harvard
those induced hallucinations
its a lot like that
just a thousand times amplified
its like someones poured
a litre of acid into my brain
do you remember anything
just fragments images
theres too much noise
i can never derive anything out of it
but then its still you inside it
no no its not
i dont know
in the cave i really felt like it knew me
maybe your mind is in there
its just overcharged
and cant process whats happening
i dont want to control it
i want to get rid of it
are you ready
lets even the playing field a little
gentlemen
bruce wake up
theres something going on
we got to go walk toward the back
just dont move too fast
all right come
it is a long way uptown
i think the subways probably quickest
me in a metal tube deep underground
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world
right lets get a cab
come on now lets go
youre too slow you drive like a woman
very nice you see her
oh my
very pretty watch out you goat
breathe breathe breathe
are you out of your mind
what is wrong with you
whats the matter baby
you dont like a good ride
asshole
you know i know a few
techniques could help you
manage that anger very effectively
you zip it were walking
okay
excuse me dr sterns
yes
im sorry to bother you im elizabeth ross
oh dr ross
i have someone whod like to meet you
okay
its mr blue isnt it
mr green
i got to tell you
ive been wondering if you were even real
and if you were what would it look like
a person with that much
power lurking in him
nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand
but look were not strolling
into the park for a picnic here
even if everything goes perfectly
if we induce an episode
if we get the dosage exactly right
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flareup
i dont know
what im saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer
were dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity
you mean it could kill him
kill him yeah i should say so
you should know that theres
a flip side to this too
if we miss on the low side
if we induce me and it fails
this will be very dangerous for you
look ive always been
more curious than cautious
and thats served me pretty well
so are we going to do this
how you feeling man
like a monster
okay on the table
these will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction
you can tell me later
if you thought it was strong
oh come on stupid graduate students
okay
you you you
this will be a somewhat novel sensation
we have begun
the dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood
except the antidote will only take hold
once weve achieved a full reaction
just relax
okay we are comprehensive
here you go
all right we set to pop
id take your hands off him
oh my god
wait wait theres more wait
now okay now
wait
now do it do it
bruce bruce look at me
stay with me the antidote now
sterns do it now
bruce look at me look in my eyes
please look in my eyes
oh youve got to be kidding me
bruce
oh my god
bruce bruce can you hear me
bruce
its okay youre okay youre okay
you did it
hes fine this is fantastic
its over
hi
hi
that was the most extraordinary thing
i have seen in my entire life
okay you know what stop please
we need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there
absolutely okay the gamma pulse
came from the amygdala
i think dr rosss primer
are you okay
lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily and then it abates
thats why you didnt die
of radiation sickness years ago
now maybe weve neutralised
those cells permanently
or maybe we just suppressed that event
im inclined to think the latter
but its hard to know
because none of our
test subjects ever survived
of course they werent getting the primer
wait wait
wait what did you just say
they werent getting
the myostatin primer
no no no test subjects
what test subjects
come with me
whats the activity level
snipers are covering alpha sector
we started on rats and mice
but it just completely fried them
so we had to go bigger
and we still dont know which is more toxic
the gamma or your blood
what do you mean my blood
bruce this is all you
you didnt send me much to work with
so i had to concentrate it and make more
with a little more trial and error
theres no end to what we can do
this is potentially olympian
this gamma technology
has limitless applications
well unlock hundreds of cures
we will make humans
impervious to disease
no no weve got to destroy it
wait what
all of it
tonight were gonna incinerate it
is this the whole supply
what
we could get the nobel for this
you dont understand
the power of this thing
it is too dangerous it cannot be controlled
at your discretion shooter
three of us
this is promethean fire
its just
no shot
blonskys going in
blonsky stand down
my daughters in there
we have the antidote now
they dont want the antidote
they want to make it a weapon
and if we let it go we will never get it back
you dont know how powerful this thing is
i hate the government
just as much as anyone
but youre being a little paranoid
dont you think
bruce bruce
get out
where is it come on where is it
show him to me
blonsky
miss
take this
if you took it from me im gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life
betty
i will never forgive what youve done to him
hes a fugitive
you made him a fugitive
to cover your failures
and to protect your career
dont ever speak to me
as your daughter again
its only because youre my daughter
that youre not in handcuffs too
are you telling me
you can make more like him
no not yet i sorted out a few pieces
but its not like i can put together
the same humpty dumpty
if thats what youre asking
he was a freak accident
the goal is to do it better
so banners the only
shes an annoying bitch
why are you always hitting people
now what possibly could i have done
to deserve such aggression
its not what youve done
its what youre gonna do
i want what you got out of banner
i want that
you look like youve got a little
something in you already dont you
i want more
youve seen what he becomes right
i have
and its beautiful
godlike
well i want that
i need that make me that
i dont know what youve got
inside you already
the mix could be
an abomination
i didnt say i was unwilling
i just need informed consent
and youve given it
this is what i was trying to explain
i dont know what youve been
ladling into yourself
but clearly it worked
lets assume you dont understand
a word im saying
but if youll just get back on the table
i can fix this
shoot it
hey
