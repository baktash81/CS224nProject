so emotion and control 
breathe  breathe 
wait 
okay 
i can make it work for a while 
but you need   
okay  okay 
shut that off  turn it off 
watch out 
okay 
that s not right 
oh  you 
you see that  see that 
my ticket out of here 
damn it 
here s something
a bit more interesting 
it s a possible gamma sickness  milwaukee 
a man drank one of those guarana sodas 
guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for 
wow 
  where was it bottled 
  porto verde  brazil 
have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant 
tell them no contact 
if he even sees them  he s gone 
i got you who i could 
short notice  but they re all quality 
and i pulled you one ace 
emil blonsky 
born in russia  raised in england 
and on loan to socom
from the royal marines 
i know you
cashed in some chips for this  joe 
glad i could help  just make it good 
this is the target and the location 
snatch and grab  live capture 
you ll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance 
but live fire is for backup only 
we got local out there 
but we want it tight and quiet 
is he a fighter 
your target is a fugitive
from the us government
who stole military secrets 
he is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists 
a military officer  an idaho state trooper
and possibly two canadian hunters 
so don t wait to see if he s a fighter 
tranq him and bring him back 
oh  come on 
camera 
here we go 
get rid of the damn dog 
take him 
target s on the move 
where is he 
he s on the ground 
  let s go 
  go 
move  move 
go  go  go 
go  go 
clear everyone out 
do not lose him 
oh  no 
get around behind him 
target moving past mobile unit 0 9 0 
oh  no 
you got to be kidding me 
  where is he 
  target acquired 
gringo 
let s go 
no 
please  no 
not the computer 
gimme that  no 
you bad angry  g 
i very bad angry 
oh  no 
you don t understand  something really bad
is about to happen here 
anybody else seeing this 
we ve got a bogey
of some kind  please advice 
that is the target 
use every tranq you ve got 
do it now 
go live  go live  go live 
  move 
  get out of the way 
no 
it s behind us  move  move 
get him 
shoot 
leave me alone 
no  no 
i knew something was different
before i got the shot off 
he had it on him when he bolted 
is that a girlfriend  she helps him  maybe 
she is no longer a factor 
we closed that door to him a long time ago 
he s alone 
he wants to be alone 
but see if he s been talking to anybody 
forgive me  sir 
doesn t anybody want to talk
about what went down in there   cause   
he didn t lose us 
and he was not alone  sir  we had him 
and then something hit us  something   
something big hit us 
it threw a forklift truck like it was a softball 
it was the most powerful thing
i ve ever seen 
well  it s gone 
well  if banner knows what it is 
i m gonna track him down 
i m gonna put my foot on his throat
  and i m gonna   
  that was banner 
it
was banner 
  you have to explain that statement  sir 
  no  i don t 
you ve done a good job 
pack up and get our men on a plane 
we re going home 
wait 
please 
where am i 
i ve run into bad situations
on crap missions before 
i ve seen good men go down
purely because someone didn t let us know
what we were walking into 
i ve moved on to the next one 
because that s what we do  right 
i mean  that s the job 
but this 
this is a whole new level of weird 
and i don t feel inclined
to step away from it 
so if you re taking another crack at him 
i want in 
and  with respect  you should be looking
for a team that s prepped and ready to fight 
because if that thing shows up again 
you re gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants 
sir 
tienes m√°s stretchy 
yeah  perfecto 
let me emphasise
that what i m about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive 
both to me personally and the army 
you re aware that we ve got an
infantry weapons development programme 
well  in wwii  they initiated a subprogram
for bio tech force enhancement 
yeah  super soldier 
yes 
an oversimplification  but yes 
and i dusted it off  got  em doing
serious work again  bold work 
across the hall 
they were trying to arm you better 
we were tryin  to make you better 
banner s work was very early phase 
it wasn t even weapons application 
he thought he was working
on radiation resistance 
i would never have told him
what the project really was 
but he was so sure of what he was onto 
that he tested it on himself 
and something went very wrong 
or it went very right 
as far as i m concerned  that man s
whole body is the property of the us army 
you said he wasn t working
on weapons  right 
  no 
  but you were  you were  weren t you 
you were trying other things 
one serum we developed
was very promising 
  so why did he run 
  he s a scientist 
he is not one of us 
  blonsky  how old are you  45 
  39 
  it takes a toll  doesn t it 
  yes  it does 
so get out of the trenches 
you should be a colonel by now 
with your record 
no  i m a fighter 
i ll be one for as long as i can 
you know  if i could take what i know now 
put it in the body i had ten years ago 
that would be someone
i wouldn t want to fight 
i could probably arrange
something like that 
take care  kids 
stan  i give you my word 
whatever you ve heard about me 
it s not true 
oh  i know it  i always knew it 
i mean  you know how i felt about you two 
  have you talked to her 
  no 
she doesn t know that i m here 
  she s with somebody 
  yeah  he s a head shrink 
they say he s one of the best 
but a really nice guy 
good  that s good 
  bruce  what can i do to help you 
  i could use a bed for a few nights 
  you can have the spare room upstairs 
  that d be so great 
there is one other thing 
excuse me  pardon me 
coming through 
hey  pal  i got a delivery on five 
i don t think there s anybody up there 
oh  man  i m gonna catch hell
if i don t collect  you got to let me try 
i ll tell you what  i got an extra medium 
take it on the house 
  you are the man 
  god bless you  brother 
all right 
okay 
we re pretty well closed here  folks 
i m sorry 
oh  come on  stan  it s friday night 
oh  kids

oh  i got to have a mister pink  please 
she worked through dinner again 
of course 
stan 
and he    i go    so  yeah 
i mean  where were you 
 i can t    i don t know
where you were  cecil

i thought   oh  my god   i just felt so awful 
bruce 
betty  what s going on 
betty

  i don t know what to say 
  please  just tell me the truth 
don t go  don t go 
i want you to come with me now 
please  come with me 
please 
it s our data 
i got in there before they carted it all away 
i hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday 
  does the general know that you have this 
  no  i don t think so 
i haven t spoken to him in a couple of years 
you have to be sure 
bruce  i don t understand why we can t
just go in there together and talk to him 
he told me what he wanted to do 
he wants it out of me 
he wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it 
he wants to make it a weapon 
  hi 
  hi 
  i thought you might want to   
  thanks 
listen  i should leave early 
as early as i can 
really  you can t stay at all 
i want to 
but it s just not safe for me to be here 
  lf i could borrow some cash   
  of course 
i need to take a bus 
well  at least let me walk you to the station 
okay 
  you have everything you need 
  yeah 
i   
what 
  good night 
  good night 
i hope you get some rest 
we re giving you a very low dose only 
i need you sharp out there and disciplined 
first sign of any side effect 
we stop and you re off team
until you straighten out 
  agreed 
  agreed 
you ll get two separate infusions 
one into the deep muscle 
one into the bone marrow centres 
the bone ones are going to hurt 
is everything okay 
i think so 
come here 
  i just wanna do this 
  oh 
  it s better like that 
  yeah 
it feels too tight  huh 
  yeah  a little 
  okay 
  what 
  they re here 
  betty  look at me  look at me 
  bruce 
you have to go far away
from me as you can 
  don t argue with me  just go  go 
  bruce 
damn it  we d have had snipers on target
in three more minutes 
i wanna know who jumped the gun 
he s heading 2 7 0 
blonsky  not yet 
sir 
look alive  this could get interesting 
i got him 
stop  stop 
i know you re in there 
general  please 
sir 
dad 
  dad  please don t do this 
  you can t see this clearly  now  get inside 
there he is 
target is in the overpass  we have a visual 
do not engage  repeat  do not engage 
he s locked in 
put two canisters in there with him 
fire 
get her back here 
now she ll see 
alpha team 
let him have all of it 
come on  light him up 
where are the fifty cals  move your asses 
oh  my god 
blonsky  now you re up 
sir 
cover me 
remember me 
my god  he s doing it 
move him toward the cannons

hold your position 
do it now 
please  please  please  no

bruce 
bruce  bruce 
where s the gunship 
is that it 
blonsky  pull back now 
pull back 
is that all you got 
  fall back 
  fall back  let s go  let s go 
find cover 
betty 
fire  goddamn it 
bruce 
stop firing 
no 
you did the right thing  calling us 
i need to know where they re going 
she ll be in incredible danger
as long as she s with him 
from who 
he protected her  you almost killed her 
i give you my word  her safety
is my main concern at this point 
you know  it s a point
of professional pride with me
that i can always tell
when somebody s lying 
and you are 
i don t know where he s going 
  i know she ll help him  if she can 
  then she s aiding a fugitive 
and i can t help either one of them 
i used to wonder
why she never talked about you 
now i know 
where does she meet these guys 
bruce 
bruce 
it s okay  it s okay 
come here  come this way 
watch your head 
okay 
we re okay 
it s okay 
it s just the rain 
will he ever walk again 
most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now 
i will say this for him 
he s got a heart like a machine 
never seen anything like it 
outside of a racehorse 
here 
okay 
bruce 
oh  hi 
are you okay 
yeah 
yeah  actually  i feel a lot better 
  good 
  i just had to get my data back 
you ate it 
well  you know  the circumstances
called for a little improvisation 
wow 
okay  so they didn t have a great selection 
but i got you some options 
first thing s first 
oh  you re kidding me 
what 
  no 
  they were the stretchiest pair they had 
i ll take my chances 
rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the us military
and an unknown adversary
on the campus of culver university
earlier today 
sophomores jack mcghee and jim wilson
witnessed some of the battle 
it was so big 
  it was like this huge  like  hulk 
  yeah 
mcghee  who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper 
captured this on his cell phone 
further search for the mysterious  hulk 
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the smoky mountain national forest 
not too short back there 
i have done this before  you know 
i don t know how you ve done this
on your own for all this time 
with clippers  usually 
  wait  wait  wait  wait 
  what  what 
we can t do this 
  it s okay  i want to 
  no 
no 
i can t 
i can t get too excited 
not even a little excited 
it s okay 
sir  it s blonsky 
has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family 
ask him yourself 
sir 
  good to see you back on your feet  soldier 
  thank you  sir 
how do you feel 
pissed off and ready for round three 
basically  we can t use any of this 
because they can track all of it 
well  my lip gloss  can they track that 
  no  you can take your lip gloss 
  thank you 
  well  i need my glasses 
  well  you can take
  your glasses and your watch  okay 
  okay 
we can use most of it  we just can t use
the credit cards  the id or the phone 
  don t even turn that on 
  okay 
and we ll take the cash  obviously 
how will we get where we need to go
on  40 and no credit cards 
well  we could sell this 
no  no  that s the only thing
you have left from her  no 
well  we ll have to try and get it back 
federal is
already monitoring phones 
plastic and dr ross s web accounts 
and local pd have been placed on alert 
they ll pop up somewhere
and when they do  it comes straight to us 
they re not gonna just pop up 
he made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes 
he s not gonna use a damn credit card now 
if he was trying to escape 
he d be long gone 
he s not trying to escape this time 
he s looking for help
and that s how we re gonna get him 
we know what they re after and we know
he s been talking to somebody 
you all have copies of the correspondence 
the aliases mr green and mr blue
have been added to the
shield operations database 
if he comes up for air  we ll be waiting 
if he makes a peep  we ll hear him 
and when he slips up  we ll be ready 
hey 
smile 
what is it like 
when it happens  what do you experience 
remember those experiments
we volunteered for at harvard 
those induced hallucinations 
it s a lot like that 
just a thousand times amplified 
it s like someone s poured
a litre of acid into my brain 
  do you remember anything 
  just fragments  images 
there s too much noise 
i can never derive anything out of it 
  but then it s still you inside it 
  no  no  it s not 
i don t know 
in the cave  i really felt like it knew me 
maybe your mind is in there 
it s just overcharged
and can t process what s happening 
i don t want to control it 
i want to get rid of it 
are you ready 
let s even the playing field a little 
gentlemen 
bruce  wake up 
there s something going on 
we got to go  walk toward the back 
just don t move too fast 
all right  come 
it is a long way uptown 
i think the subway s probably quickest 
me in a metal tube  deep underground 
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world 
right  let s get a cab 
come on  now  let s go 
you re too slow  you drive like a woman 
  very nice  you see her 
  oh  my 
very pretty  watch out  you goat 
breathe  breathe  breathe 
are you out of your mind 
  what is wrong with you 
  what s the matter  baby 
you don t like a good ride 
asshole 
you know  i know a few
techniques could help you
  manage that anger very effectively 
  you zip it  we re walking 
okay 
excuse me  dr sterns 
  yes 
  i m sorry to bother you  i m elizabeth ross 
oh  dr ross 
  i have someone who d like to meet you 
  okay 
it s mr blue  isn t it 
mr green 
i got to tell you 
i ve been wondering if you were even real 
and if you were  what would it look like 
a person with that much
power lurking in him 
nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand 
but  look  we re not strolling
into the park for a picnic  here 
even if everything goes perfectly 
if we induce an episode 
if we get the dosage exactly right 
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare up 
i don t know 
what i m saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer
we re dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity 
  you mean it could kill him 
  kill him  yeah  i should say so 
you should know that there s
a flip side to this  too 
if we miss on the low side 
if we induce me and it fails 
this will be very dangerous for you 
look  i ve always been
more curious than cautious 
and that s served me pretty well 
so  are we going to do this 
how you feeling  man 
like a monster 
okay  on the table 
these will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction 
you can tell me later
if you thought it was strong 
oh  come on  stupid graduate students 
okay   
you  you  you 
this will be a somewhat novel sensation 
we have begun 
the dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood 
except the antidote will only take hold
once we ve achieved a full reaction 
just relax 
okay  we are comprehensive 
here you go 
all right  we set to pop 
i d take your hands off him 
oh  my god 
wait  wait  there s more  wait 
  now  okay  now 
  wait 
now  do it  do it 
bruce  bruce  look at me 
stay with me  the antidote  now 
sterns  do it now 
bruce  look at me  look in my eyes 
please  look in my eyes 
oh  you ve got to be kidding me 
bruce 
oh  my god 
bruce  bruce  can you hear me 
bruce 
it s okay  you re okay  you re okay 
you did it 
he s fine  this is fantastic 
it s over 
hi 
hi 
that was the most extraordinary thing
i have seen in my entire life 
okay  you know what  stop  please 
we need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there 
absolutely  okay  the gamma pulse
came from the amygdala 
  i think dr ross s primer   
  are you okay 
   lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily  and then it abates 
that s why you didn t die
of radiation sickness years ago 
now  maybe we ve neutralised
those cells permanently 
or maybe we just suppressed that event 
i m inclined to think the latter 
but it s hard to know
because none of our
test subjects ever survived 
  of course  they weren t getting the primer 
  wait  wait 
  wait  what did you just say 
  they weren t getting
  the myostatin primer   
  no  no  no  test subjects 
what test subjects 
come with me 
  what s the activity level 
  snipers are covering alpha sector 
we started on rats and mice 
but it just completely fried them 
so we had to go bigger 
and we still don t know which is more toxic 
the gamma or your blood 
  what do you mean  my blood 
  bruce  this is all you 
you didn t send me much to work with 
so i had to concentrate it and make more 
with a little more trial and error 
there s no end to what we can do 
this is potentially olympian 
this gamma technology
has limitless applications 
we ll unlock hundreds of cures 
we will make humans
impervious to disease 
no  no  we ve got to destroy it 
  wait  what 
  all of it 
tonight  we re gonna incinerate it 
  is this the whole supply 
  what   
we could get the nobel for this 
you don t understand
the power of this thing 
it is too dangerous  it cannot be controlled 
at your discretion  shooter 
three of us 
this is promethean fire 
it s just   
no shot 
blonsky s going in 
blonsky  stand down 
my daughter s in there 
we have the antidote now 
they don t want the antidote 
they want to make it a weapon 
and if we let it go  we will never get it back 
you don t know how powerful this thing is 
i hate the government
just as much as anyone 
but you re being a little paranoid 
don t you think 
bruce  bruce 
get out 
where is it  come on  where is it 
show him to me 
blonsky 
miss 
take this 
if you took it from me  i m gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life 
betty 
i will never forgive what you ve done to him 
he s a fugitive 
you made him a fugitive
to cover your failures
and to protect your career 
don t ever speak to me
as your daughter again 
it s only because you re my daughter
that you re not in handcuffs  too 
are you telling me
you can make more like him 
no  not yet  i sorted out a few pieces 
but it s not like i can put together
the same humpty dumpty 
if that s what you re asking 
he was a freak accident 
the goal is to do it better 
so banner s the only   
  she s an annoying bitch 
  why are you always hitting people 
now what possibly could i have done
to deserve such aggression 
it s not what you ve done 
it s what you re gonna do 
i want what you got out of banner 
i want that 
you look like you ve got a little
something in you already  don t you 
i want more 
you ve seen what he becomes  right 
i have 
and it s beautiful 
godlike 
well  i want that 
i need that  make me that 
i don t know what you ve got
inside you already 
the mix could be
an abomination 
i didn t say i was unwilling 
i just need informed consent 
and you ve given it 
this is what i was trying to explain 
i don t know what you ve been
ladling into yourself 
but clearly it worked 
let s assume you don t understand
a word i m saying 
but if you ll just get back on the table 
i can fix this 
  shoot it 
  hey 
no 
delta 4 to leader

two of our guys 
blonsky and the major are still inside
