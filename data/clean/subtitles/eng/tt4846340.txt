negros in the state 
it s the only school
past the eighth grade
anywhere near here

katherine s in the sixth grade 
they want to take her early 
young katherine  tetrahedron 
dodecahedron 
marion  they re offering
a full scholarship 
all you have to do is get there 
ms  coleman   
why don t you solve
the equation on the board 
ms  sumner 
we took up a collection
amongst the teachers and such 
it s not a lot   
but it s enough
to help get you settled in 
that s more than kind 
ms  sumner 
young katherine 
if the product of two terms
is zero then common sense says
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with 
so if you move all the
terms over to one side 
you can put the quadratics
into a form
that can be factored   
allowing that side
of the equation
to equal zero 
once you ve done that 
it s pretty straightforward
from there 
ms  sumner  in all my years
of teaching 
i ve never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has 
mrs  coleman  katherine 
mr  coleman 
hurry on now  love 
ms  sumner  you have to go 
let mama tuck you in 
you have to see
what she becomes 
 clattering 
dorothy  okay 
try to turn it over now 
katherine 
mary 
somebody 
katherine 
quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over 
i got it 
i m not deaf 
i wonder sometimes 
here it goes 
 motor sputtering 
dorothy  yeah 
it s the starter 
that is definitely the starter 
this starter is starting
to make us late 
we are all gonna
end up unemployed   
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day 
you re welcome
to walk the 16 miles 
or sit in the back of the bus 
 chuckles

you have identification on you 
yes  sir 
yes  sir 
we re just on our way to work   
at langley 
nasa  sir 
we do a great deal
of the calculating 
getting our rockets into space 
all three of you 
yes  sir 
yes  officer 
nasa 
now that s something 
i had no idea they hired   
there are quite a few women
working in the space program 
damn russians are
watching us right now 
sputniks 
you girls ever
meet those astronauts 
mercury seven 
absolutely 
uh  yes  sir  we work with those
gentlemen all the time 
those boys are the best
we got  i m sure of that 
yeah 
yeah 
we gotta get a man up there
before the commies do 
yes 
absolutely 
whole damn country s
counting on them 
that s for certain 
hard being of service
broken down
on the side of the road  though 
right  right 
well  do y all need a tow
or something 
no  thank you  officer 
i think i got it 
just give me my   
just need to bypass the starter 
she s good at this stuff 
 engine starts 
dorothy  whoo  attagirl 
we re all set 
well  hell  least i can do
is give y all an escort 
i imagine you re
running late to work 
no  sir  we wouldn t
wanna bother you 
that would be
wonderful  officer 
thank you so much  sir 
follow me 
dorothy  i m driving 
hurry up  dorothy 
before he changes his mind 
dorothy  we re coming 
katherine  hold your horses 
 soul music playing 
 siren wailing 
mary  yes 
whoa  slow down  mary 
mary  slow down 
you re too close 
be quiet 
he said to follow him 
he didn t mean up his behind 
dear lord  i don t even
know where to begin 
oh  i ll tell you
where to begin 
three negro women are chasing
a white police officer
down the highway
in hampton  virginia

they ve achieved
at least one orbit  maybe two 
chernushka is ready to go again 
so is our comrade  ivan 
a brave space traveler 
we have proven life can
be sustained in space 
now we will be first
to send a human 
a damn dog and a damn mannequin 
and then  a 1 6 megaton rds 37

drops down in the middle
of des moines 
well  that s
a pretty big jump  sir 
what 
just that   
who the hell is he 
paul stafford  our lead
engineer  mr  webb 
i think what he meant to say   
is that speculation  at least
on our side of the equation   
by definition can be   
just a little dangerous 
dangerous 
you know what s dangerous 
mr  stafford 
inaction and indecision 
the russians
have a spy satellite
lapping the planet 
taking pictures
of god knows what 
the president is demanding
an immediate response 
no more delay 
alan shepard  john glenn 
your uncle bob 
it doesn t matter 
get us up there  harrison 
we can t justify a space program
that doesn t put
anything in space 
 murmuring 
how d that feel in there  paul 
you think you enlightened
the administrator 
hmm 
no  he didn t look
enlightened to me 
he look enlightened to you  sam 
not particularly 
and just so you know 
he s not wrong about
what he said in there 
you know that  right 
because now that
they can get up there 
a bomb will follow 
it s what happens
to all our good ideas 
i imagine theirs too 
where s   
where s the machine 
any day now 
mr  harrison 
any day now 
yes  sir 
what s it called 
the initials 
the ibm 
international business machines 
space is a business 
 chuckles 
i need a mathematician 
i ll put in
another request  sir 
 another request  
jesus christ 
we don t have a single person
in this entire building
that can handle
analytic geometry 
that s what i ve been told 
tell me something else  ruth   
like we re gonna find
such a person
before the russians plant a flag
on the damn moon 
a real good time 
dorothy  all right  gloria 
you ll be with engineering 
building four 
ladies  ladies 
if you re tardy  you
don t get an assignment 
if you don t get an assignment 
you don t have a job 
eleanor

data reduction 
you re welcome
to join the charmers
in magnetoplasma dynamics 
oh  no  ma am 
thank you  data
reduction is just fine 
mm hmm 
mary 
present 
the mercury seven prototype
has arrived for testing 
mr  zielinski s
requesting you
for permanent assignment 
are you serious 
get moving 
ooh  thank you  jesus 
thank you  jesus 
oh  thank you  mary  mary 
keep it inside 
okay  i m sorry  dor 
all right  ms  late 
you will also be supporting
the east group 
mrs  mitchell 
we re on double time
this morning  girls 
i need these calculations
before lunch 
space task group
needs a computer  asap 
someone with a handle
on analytic geometry 
we can t fill that position
out of the east group 
permanent or temp 
everything s temporary  dorothy 
you have someone 
yes  ma am 
katherine s the gal for that 
she can handle any numbers
you put in front of her 
i ll check her credentials 
didn t think i d come
all the way down here 
here  finish passing
those out 
woman  yes  ma am 
dorothy  mrs  mitchell 
if i could   
my application
for supervisor  ma am 
was just wondering if they re
still considering me
for that position 
yes 
well  the official word is no 
they re not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group 
may i ask why 
i don t know why 
i didn t ask why 
we need a supervisor  ma am 
we haven t had one
since miss jansen got sick 
it s been almost a year 
things are working
just fine as is 
i m doing the work
of a supervisor 
well  that s nasa for you 
fast with rocket ships 
slow with advancement 
get those trajectory
i ll check worked out 
we need them

shut it down 
if we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated   
the capsule might have
more stability 
but the friction  it is
under during re entry   
most shield erosion occurs
on the posterior side
abutting the retro boosters 
conclusion 
the area closest to the boosters
is closest to the heat 
coupled with rising
temperature on re entry   
the contact softens 
we could consider
another fastener
other than the bolts 
yes 
yes 
there is another opening
in the engineer
training program 
flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag 
mary  a person
with engineer s mind
should be an engineer 
you can t be a computer
the rest of your life 
mr  zielinski   
i m a negro woman 
i m not gonna entertain
the impossible 
and i m a polish jew
whose parents died
in a nazi prison camp 
now i m standing
beneath a spaceship
that s going to carry an
astronaut to the stars 
i think we can say we are
living the impossible 
let me ask you   
if you were a white male 
would you wish
to be an engineer 
i wouldn t have to 
i d already be one 
vivian  skirts must be worn
past the knee 
sweaters are preferred
to blouses 
no jewelry 
a simple pearl necklace
is the exception 
your supervisor
is mr  al harrison 
director of
the space task group 
you ll write research  proof
calculations  so forth 
do not talk to mr  harrison
unless he talks to you 
not many computers last
more than a few days 
he s been through a dozen
in as many months 
come on  keep up 
things move fast around here 
your clearance 
they ve never had a colored
in here before  katherine 
don t embarrass me 
 sighs 
 indistinct chattering 
 typewriters clacking 
 telephones ringing 
this wasn t emptied last night 
i m sorry  i m not the   
custodian 
excuse me  ma am 
mr  harrison s computer
reporting 
take the desk in the back 
i ll get you work in a bit 
mr  harrison won t warm up
to you  don t expect it 
do your work 
keep your head down 
thank you 
go on  get settled 
paul 
why are we still losing shingles
off the heat shield 
we re working with a prototype
of the capsule  al 
its lid is one third the
size of what it s going   
al  i get that 
so  what do we do with our
million dollar fan  karl 
turn it down 
no  al  i don t think   
it was a joke 
paul  if the heat shield
comes off   
what do you think happens
to our astronaut 
i know 
so we re gonna come up
with a solve  right 
yes  sir 
we re working on it 
ruth  what s the status
on that computer 
she s right behind you 
mr  harrison 
does she handle
analytic geometry 
absolutely 
and she speaks 
yes  sir  i do 
which one 
both 
geometry and speaking 
ruth  get me the   
you think you   
you think you can find me
the frenet frame
for this data 
using the gram schmidt   
orthogonalization algorithm 
yes  sir 
i prefer it over
euclidean coordinates 
okay  good 
good  then i m gonna need
it by the end of the day 
yes 
i m also gonna ask you
to check
mr  stafford s math
as well as others  on this floor
from time to time 
i can handle that  al 
i m sure you can  paul 
i m sure they all can 
but if that were the case
shingles wouldn t be flying
off the heat shield 
now would they 
excuse me  could i have
everyone s attention
for a moment 
thank you 
just to be clear   
in 14 days  the mercury seven
will be here for training 
and i have no doubt in my mind
that they re going to be
asking us questions
about our work 
i think that s pretty reasonable
given we re putting a human
on top of a missile 
shooting him into space 
and it s never been done before 
 all laugh 
because it s never been done 
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter 
it s gonna matter
to their wives   
to their children 
i believe it s gonna matter
to the whole damn country 
so this space task group
will be as advertised 
america s greatest engineering
and scientific minds
are not gonna have a problem
with having their work checked 
are they  paul 
no  sir 
good  so let s have
an amen  damn it 
all  amen 
 louder  amen 
all right 
 marker squeaking 
my numbers are spot on 
i will double check them  sir 
no problem 
uh   
i m not gonna be able to   
work on what you can read 
the rest is classified 
you don t have clearance 
these are the numbers
mr  harrison gave me 
yes  i m absolutely   
excuse me 
may i ask
where the ladies  room is 
sorry  i have no idea
where your bathroom is 
yes  sir 
uh  yes  sir 
 runnin  by pharrell williams
playing 
 singing  summertime in
virginia was an oven
all the kids eating
ice cream with their cousins
i was studyin  while you
was playing the dozens
don t act like you was there
when you wasn t
runnin  from the man
runnin  from the badge
don t act like you was there
when you wasn t
runnin  toward our plans
and the judges hands
don t act like you was there
when you wasn t
i know they say
you crawl before you walk
but in my mind i already jog
if i stand still
i cannot get far
they want the moon i m on mars
sometime my mind dives deep
when i m runnin 
together we ll fly
but no more runnin 
ruth 
yes  mr  harrison 
ruth  where s that girl
with the numbers 
on a    break 
we take breaks now 
 panting 
sometime my mind dives deep
when i m runnin 
i don t want no free ride
i m just sick and tired
of runnin 
together we fly
but no more runnin 
my god  where have you been 
are you finished yet 
uh   
almost  he said
by the end of the day 
the end of the day around
here was yesterday 
 banging on glass 
i need those done first 
he wants those done first  okay 
get going 
i m sorry about that 
somebody s working on it
right now 
mr  harrison 
yeah  uh  just set it   
you know 
and stafford s
heat shield pharrell 
it s hard to be sure  sir 
hard to be sure 
you know what we re doing here 
trying to put
a man into space  sir 
that s right 
that s right  so you can
throw that in the trash 
excuse me 
i said you can throw it away 
here 
it s not an insult to your work 
it s just obsolete 
that s how fast things
are moving around here 
if i said i was sorry 
i d be saying it all day 
what i m asking you to do 
what i m asking everyone
in that room   
all my geniuses   
is to look beyond the numbers 
to look around them 
through them 
for answers to questions
we don t even know to ask 
math that doesn t yet exist 
because without it 
we re not going anywhere 
we re staying on the ground 
we re not flying into space 
we re not circling the earth 
and we re certainly not
touching the moon 
and in my mind   
in my mind  i m already there 
are you 
yes  sir 
good 
because i don t need
another smart girl
with an adding machine 
can i go  sir 
yeah  go 
yes  you can go 
 sighs 
 mary and dorothy
speaking indistinctly 
we ve been waiting for hours 
next time  you take the bus 
she s in a mood 
 r b playing on car stereo 
 singing  people talkin 
tryin  to break us up
why won t they let us be 
brick and stones
may break my bones
but talk don t bother me
i ve been abused
in my heart
i haven t been late
one day in 10 years 
haven t been out sick 
haven t complained 
my work s on time 
it s done right 
it s done well 
it s not fair  that s a fact 
what s not fair is having
the responsibility
of a supervisor   
but not the title or the pay 
mary  mmm 
watching you two move on 
now  don t get me wrong 
any upward movement
is movement for us all 
just isn t movement for me 
truth be told  dorothy   
i don t even know
if i can keep up in that room 
i ll be back with
the computers in a week 
or out of a job entirely 
oh  please 
you re better with the numbers
than anyone in there 
katherine  and you know it 
just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does   
you ll be fine 
and you  have some respect 
get your damn feet
off my dashboard 
this isn t your living room 
i sound like a supervisor 
don t i 
a mean old salty one 
riddled with authority 
no question 
 laughs 
you don t mess
with mrs  vaughan 
turn that music up 
 music continues

oh  my word 
that sounds important 
it s a promotion 
 chuckles  it might be
a slight promotion 
but you want the job  right 
i think so 
it s a challenge  but   
it s nothing you

it means  uh   
you practice safety
just in case something happens 
truth is  we don t know
what they re doing up there

no  baby 
but i m going to do what i can
to help those brave men
get there  yes  i am

defending our freedom 
give a shout of praise
for colonel jim johnson 
 all applaud 
returning home 
by the grace of god
to set up a national guard unit
right here in hampton 
can i get a hallelujah in here 
hallelujah 
i just don t understand 
i don t understand it 
i don t wanna talk
about this again  okay 
a female engineer 
a female engineer 
we re negro  baby 
ain t no such thing 
understand it 
it s not like that there  levi 
you can t apply for freedom 
freedom is never granted
to the oppressed 
it s got
to be demanded  taken

to achieve something 
i don t want any greens

let me help you 
sure 
fruit salad 
mmm hmm 
pastor mentioned you re
a computer at nasa 
yes 
what s that entail 
oh 
we calculate
the mathematics necessary
to enable launch and landing
for the space program 
 laughing  that s
pretty heady stuff 
yes  it is 
they let women
handle that sort of   
uh   
that s not what i mean 
what do you mean 
i m just surprised
that something so   
taxing   
mmm hmm 
mr  johnson 
if i were you  i d quit
talking right now 
i didn t mean no disrespect 
i will have you know
i was the first
negro female student
at west virginia university
graduate school 
on any given day   
i analyze the manometer levels
for air displacement 
friction  and velocity
and compute
over 10 000 calculations
by cosine  square root   
and  lately  analytic geometry 
by hand 
there are 20 bright 
highly capable
negro women
in the west computing group 
and we re proud to be doing
our part for the country 
so  yes 
they let women do some things
at nasa  mr  johnson 
and it s not because
we wear skirts 
it s because we wear glasses 
have a good day 
 band playing 
 all applauding 
scott  welcome to langley 
welcome to langley 
welcome 
good to have
you here  gentlemen 
thank you 
that s alan shepard 
u s  navy pilot 
he could be the
first man in space 
and that s scott carpenter
and walter schirra   
also navy pilots 
all under 5  11   180 pounds 
iq s over 130 
mmm 
and handsome must be
a requirement too 
how could you possibly be
ogling these white men 
it s equal rights 
i have the right to see
fine in every color 
and that s john glenn  he s
the only marine corps pilot 
gentlemen  if we may 
much to see around here 
well  heck  we haven t
shaken all the hands yet 
we have a fairly tight
itinerary  colonel 
ruth  he s fine 
he s coming this way 
look straight ahead 
i m looking right at him 
ladies  i didn t wanna run
off without saying hello 
seem to be in a big
rush around here 
the russians certainly
aren t slowing down any 
they can t build
a damn refrigerator 
how the heck did they
beat us into space 
 all laughing 
and what do you ladies do
for nasa 
calculate your trajectories 
launch and landing 
you can t get anywhere
without the numbers 
no  sir 
mary jackson  mr  glenn 
engineering 
and i m proud as the devil
to be working with you 
thank you  mary 
john 
john  let s take it inside 
yes  sir 
guys 
nice meeting you guys 
thank you  colonel 
good luck  sir 
god bless you all 
thank you  that s wonderful 
thank you 
mr  harrison wants you
to confirm
launch and landing for the
redstone rocket test 
i cannot work on what
i cannot see  mr  stafford 
it s illegible 
those numbers have
already been confirmed
by two engineers in this
department and myself 
this is more or less
a dummy check 
you have one  we make it two 
make it double  okay 
we gotta get it 
just make it happen 
no one thought to measure
these things 
i m afraid not  sir 
well  would you like us to stop 
no  no  just   
actually  no 
just keep going 
in fact  use the big hammer 
yes  sir 
come on  use the big hammer 
you heard the man  let s go 
watch out 
ma am 
our runner can pick up
your work  dorothy 
you need to be working 
not walking 
oh  it s break time  ma am 
no trouble at all 
since you made the trip   
you can take that batch
over there 
sure thing  mrs  mitchell 
you need something else 
yes  ma am 
i was wondering if you know
what they re building
over in the tech wing 
it s called an ibm 
a mainframe machine 
apparently  it can
do our calculations
in a fraction of the time 
hmm 
i guess that s good for nasa 
hurry on  now  best if
you do it in one trip 
 grunts 
excuse me 
hi 
what are you looking at  paul 
is that correct 
yeah 
whose work is that 
i said  whose work is that 
katherine goble  sir 
hello 
hi 
paul  how did you know
the redstone
couldn t support orbital flight 
that s classified information 
it s top secret 
it s no secret why the
redstone tests keep failing 
it s fine
for sub orbital flight
but it can t handle
the weight of the capsule
and push it into space 
numbers don t lie 
and you figured
all that out with this 
half the data is redacted 
but what s there tells a story
if you read between the lines 
the distance from launch
to orbit  we know 
redstone mass  we know 
mercury capsule weight  we know 
and the speeds are there
in the data 
you did the math 
yes  sir 
i looked beyond 
how do you know
about the atlas rocket 
that s not math 
that data is not here 
like you said  it s classified 
i held it up to the light 
you held it up to the light 
yes  sir 
well  there it is 
mmm hmm 
atlas 
what s your name 
katherine goble 
are you a spy  katherine 
am i what 
i said  are you a russian spy 
no  sir 
i m not russian 
she s not russian  sir 
all right then  we have
nothing to lose here 
give her everything she needs
to work on shepard s
trajectories 
without redaction 
are we clear on that 
are we sure about this 
what s the issue  paul 
you heard her 
she s not a spy 
i just don t think
it s a good idea 
you know what i think s
a good idea  darker ink 
i think darker ink s
a good idea 
ruth  could you pass it along 
yes  sir 
thank you  katherine 
thank you  sir 
 sighs 
this interrogation s over 
 indistinct conversations 
you can probably get to the
moon and back with this 
just not the bathroom 
at least they re not
blind of what you do 
it s not gonna matter soon 
this ibm s gonna
put us all out of work 
how you doing 
what can we do about it 
only one thing to do 
learn all we can 
make ourselves valuable 
somewhere down the line 
a human being
is gonna have
to push the buttons 
that s right 
oh  mercy 
well  she must be lost 
nasa doesn t commission females
for the engineer
training program 
that position is available
to any qualified applicant 
right  except  you don t have
the educational requirements 
i have a bachelor s degree
in mathematics
and physical science 
it s the same as most
engineers around here 
we now require advanced
extension courses
through the university
of virginia 
it s in the employee
handbook  in addendum 
in case you haven t read it 
every time we have a chance
to get ahead   
they move the finish line 
i just follow the rules
around here 
and i expect everyone
who works for me
to follow them as well 
there are no special
circumstances for anyone 
y all should be thankful
you have jobs at all 
 for those that cannot attend classes
at the university of virginia   
 advanced extension courses
are available
 at the hampton high school  
that s still a
segregated school  mary 
virginia acts like brown
versus board of education
never happened 
they are never gonna
allow a colored woman
to just take classes
at an all white school 
well  sounds about right 
that s all you gonna say 
i m not gonna sit here all day
and listen to you complain
about the way things are 
we re trying to play cards 
petition the court 
fight for what you want 
but quit talking about it 
i ve been complaining 
for days 
ladies 
not one more peep about work 
deal me in 
dorothy  katherine 
mary  come on 
katherine  oh  no 
mary  right here

no  not really 
people   chanting 
segregation must go 
segregation must go 
segregation must go

don t pay attention to all that 
we re not part
of that trouble  go on 
 mind  they must have done    
we don t want any trouble
in here 
oh  i m not here
for any trouble  ma am 
what are you here for 
a book 
you have books
in the colored section 
it doesn t have
what i m looking for 
that s just the way it is 
go on  now 
you know better than this 
get your hands off my boys 
don t touch them 
you have a blessed day

i imagine i m just
out of practice 
mmm hmm 
i was hoping you d allow
me to start over 
mmm hmm 
see  the thing is   
i have an interest in
getting to know you better 
mmm hmm 
 chuckles  you re one

there s many 
that s good practice 
right there 
man   over rand  we interrupt
this musical programming
with breaking news 
the soviet news agency
has announced
that russian cosmonaut 
yuri gagarin 
has become
the first man in space 
gagarin completed
one full orbit around the planet
in 108 minutes 
stay tuned to this station
for more details
as they become available 
guess that puts us
behind the curve 
announcer 
the vostok 1 rocket   
delivered russian cosmonaut
yuri gagarin s 3ka capsule   
into orbit  at 6 07 utc   
reentering russian airspace
at 7 55 utc 
proving conclusively that man
could survive
orbital space flight 
gagarin was awarded
the order of lenin
and a gold star   
well  they beat
the pants off us 
let s go 
he is also conferred
the title   
let s learn how to fly to space 
 first soviet astronaut    
and has been proclaimed
a national hero 
this is a day
of unprecedented triumph   
for the russian space program
and a crushing blow for america
in the race for space 
i wanna thank everyone
for staying 
i know it s late 
and after what i just saw 
i m sure everyone s probably
anxious to just go home 
before we do  i just
have to ask a question 
the same one
i ve been asking myself
all the way over here   
which is   
how the hell did we find ourself
in second place
in a two man race 
anybody 
paul 
and i think glenn said it
pretty well 
they re just outworking us 
the reason i have to think that
is because i refuse to believe
that the russians
are smarter than us
or that they have
more technology 
or that they care more 
but i don t know 
is that possible 
is it possible that it actually
means more to them 
we re in the fight
of our lives  people 
we re not on some epic joy ride 
i just saw seven faces
who aren t sure
that we can get there 
this is our problem 
and so as of right now
there s only two things you
need to know going forward 
one is staying here 
working late 
that s gonna be a fact of life 
and two  don t expect
your paychecks
to reflect the extra time
it s gonna take
to catch up
and pass those bastards 
for those of you
who can t work that way 
i understand and thank you
for what you ve done 
for everyone else   
i suggest you call your wives
and tell them how it s gonna be 
i ll start with mine 
 murmuring 
sam  turn it up 
turn it up 
yes  sir 
john 
morning  sir 
7 5  7 4  7 3   
end of the day 
okay  we re looking good 
okay 
 sighs 
sir  might be
the selector latch 
i m taking a walk 
john  we re honored
to serve our country 
so we don t think about danger 
we don t have time to be scared 
we got a job to do 
good morning 
good morning 
court clerk  mrs  jackson 
colored seats are at the back
of the court room 
thank you  ma am 
so  which one of you
wants to go first 
 crowd laughs 
 crowd applauding 
the ibm 7090
data processing system 
it has the capability of solving
over 24 000 multiplications
per second 
holy moses 
that s lightning fast 
they ll never get that to work 
 chuckles 
oh  it ll run eventually 
and when it does  we have
to know how to program it 
unless you d rather be
out of a job 
all  no  ma am 
mr  z   
i got a court date 
 all applaud 
 the computer uses it
 as its high speed storage unit 
 an information
holding device  
hmm 
you have a brain 
that i can work with 
this is in the wrong spot 
attagirl 
al  ruth 
yes  sir  get me the
cape on the line 
shepard s trajectories
need to be updated 
wow 
where is she 
 singing  you and i are no
different from each other
shut our eyes
when we slumber i see numbers
black and white
we re computers  i am color
don t act like
you was there when you wasn t
 toilet flushes 
i don t want no free ride
 sighs 
some nights i cry
 cause i can see the day comin 
together we fly
oh  but no more runnin 
no more runnin 
 panting 
where the hell have you been 
everywhere i look  you re not
where i need you to be 
it s not my imagination 
now where the hell
do you go every day 
to the bathroom  sir 
to the bathroom 
to the damn bathroom 
for 40 minutes a day 
what do you do in there 
we re t minus zero here 
i put a lot of faith in you 
there s no bathroom for me here 
what do you mean there is
no bathroom for you here 
there is no bathroom 
there are no colored
bathrooms in this building
or any building
outside the west campus 
which is half a mile away 
did you know that 
i have to walk to timbuktu
just to relieve myself 
and i can t use
one of the handy bikes 
picture that  mr  harrison 
my uniform   
skirt below my knees  my heels 
and a simple string of pearls 
well  i don t own pearls 
lord knows you don t pay
coloreds enough
to afford pearls 
and i work like a dog 
day and night 
living off of coffee from a pot
none of you wanna touch 
 katherine s breath trembling 
 inhales deeply 
 softly  so  excuse me
if i have to go to the restroom
a few times a day 
 metal clanging 
there you have it 
no more colored restrooms 
no more white restrooms 
just plain old toilets 
go wherever
you damn well please 
preferably closer to your desk 
here at nasa  we all
pee the same color 
 clears throat 
 knocking on door 
 coughing 
heard you was fighting the flu 
figured you could use some soup 
hot meal for the girls 
come on in 
 chuckles 
 clears throat 
excuse me 
okay  ladies 
let s say grace 
bow your heads 
dear lord  thank you
for this meal 
we ask that you bless this food
so that it may bless our bodies 
in jesus s name we pray 
amen 
amen 
reporter  it s a historic day 
here at cape canaveral 
and here s what we can expect 
alan shepard and freedom 7
will be launched into space
at an altitude of about
116 miles an hour 
dorothy  come on  you gonna miss it 
oh  boy  go 
come on  dorothy 
dorothy  i m coming 
then he will land
around 35 miles
off the coast of florida   
where he ll be picked up
by the men
of the uss lake champlain   
finally  come over here 
who set out
for this historic purpose 
man   over radio  freedom 7 
we re going to have to bleed off
some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank 
that should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule  over 
any day now  capcom 
fix your little problem
and light this candle 
roger that  freedom 7 
stand by 
temperature is returning
to normal 
running one more
launch status check 
man  all systems now go 
move to final countdown
sequence 
moving to final
countdown sequence

get on up there 
come on 
reporter  lift off at
34 minutes after the hour 
 rattling 
pitch 88 
trajectory is good 
yaw is okay 
switching manual roll 
yes 
 all cheer and applaud 
president kennedy  for
the eyes of the world
now look into space 
to the moon
and to the planets beyond 
yes 
we did it 
and we have vowed   
that we shall not
see it governed   
by a hostile flag of conquest   
but by a banner
of freedom and peace 
we set sail on this new sea   
because there is new knowledge
to be gained   
and new rights to be won 
we choose to go to the moon
in this decade
and do the other things   
not because they are easy   
but because they are hard 
suppose we should all
thank president kennedy
for the continued job security 
 all snapping fingers 
uh  gus grissom s up next 
another suborbital flight
with a redstone 
it s our last shot
before we strap glenn
to the atlas
and pray we can bring him
back down 
yes  and i imagine he d like us
to have the math
worked out beforehand 
 all chuckle 
good work  gentlemen 
go have dinner with your kids
and let s get back to work 
 all applaud 
 singing 
look what you ve done to me
make me behave like
i wouldn t ever
i know you re the one for me
your essence is the ink
in the word  forever 
i think it s high time that
i kissed you  katherine 
oh  and why is that 
figured you attracted to me 
same as i to you 
is that right 
mmm hmm 
or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago 
 both laugh 
haven t kissed a man
in a long time 
almost forgot how to 
reporter   over radio  the fbi
has arrested four white men
accused of throwing a fire bomb
into a freedom rider bus
outside of anniston  alabama   
hi  babies 
man  the bus filled rapidly
hi  mama 
with black smoke 
we all hit the floor 
ah of us realized
the bus was on fire   
and had to go out into the mob 
the kids don t need
to be watching this 
they need to see this 
when we got off the bus
in birmingham   
everybody needs to see this 
took me and forced me
out of the door   
and threw me into the crowd 
and then i was beaten by one
big guy and several others 
we think we re rendering
a great service to our nation 
for this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone 
it is a struggle
to save the soul of america 
court clerk  mary jackson 
petition to attend courses
at hampton high school 
good morning  your honor 
hampton high school is
a white school  mrs  jackson 
yes  your honor 
i m aware of that 
virginia 
still a segregated state 
regardless of what
the federal government says 
regardless of what
the supreme court says 
our law is the law 
your honor  if i may 
i believe there are
special circumstances
to be considered 
what would warrant
a colored woman
attending a white school 
may i approach your bench  sir 
your honor   
you of all people
should understand
the importance of being first 
how s that  mrs  jackson 
you were the first
in your family
to serve in the armed forces 
u s  navy 
the first to attend university 
george mason 
and the first state judge
to be recommissioned
by three consecutive governors 
you ve done some research 
yes  sir 
what s the point 
the point is  your honor   
no negro woman
in the state of virginia   
has ever attended
an all white high school 
it s unheard of 
yeah  unheard of 
and before alan shepard
sat on top of a rocket 
no other american
had ever touched space 
and now  he will forever
be remembered
as the u s  navy man
from new hampshire 
the first to touch the stars 
and i  sir   
i plan on being
an engineer at nasa 
but i can t do that
without taking them classes
at that all white high school 
and i can t change
the color of my skin 
sol have no choice
but to be the first 
which i can t do
without you  sir 
your honor   
out of all the cases
you re gonna hear today   
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now 
which one is gonna
make you the first 
hmm 
 chuckles 
only the night classes   
mrs  jackson 
 yells 
yes  yes  yes 
yes 
oh  my god 
i cannot believe 
how late did he say
he was gonna be 
katherine  excuse me  no
more than five minutes  sir 
gus grissom s coordinates 
uh  i d like to get a jump
on john glenn s trajectory 
do you have any idea
what you re asking 
an orbital launch with an atlas
rocket is going to take time 
is there a problem 
mr  harrison   
i was wondering 
uh huh  i ve been
wondering my whole life 
so you just spit it out 
well  sir   
i would like to get a jump
on john glenn s trajectory 
this isn t about
plugging in numbers 
it s about inventing the math 
and i think you and i
talked about that  right 
it doesn t exist 
i can do it  sir 
do you have any idea
how exacting
these calculations have to be 
it s like shooting a sawed off
shotgun from a thousand feet
and getting that one bb through a
hole so tiny  you can t even see it 
okay  let me see
what you ve got 
i m an excellent shot  sir 
how have the
grissom numbers been 
they ve been spot on 
give glenn s orbit a go 
but you run it all through
stafford  you understand 
yes  sir 
thank you 
computers don t author reports 
gus   over radio  capcom 
this is liberty bell 7 
capcom  loud and clear 
gus  okay  it s a nice
ride up to now 
man  roger 
pilot  liberty bell 7 
this is hook 1 approaching 
ready to hook on  over 
gus  i read you loud
and clear  over 
gus  the hatch is blown 
capcom 
newscaster  the liberty bell 7
capsule is taking on water 
gus grissom
is out of the capsule 
rescuers are now going
to pull him
from the ocean waves 
unfortunately  the liberty
bell 7 capsule is lost 
mama 
i can t  i can t 
mary 
senator patrick  mr  harrison 
taxpayer money
sank into the ocean
along with your capsule 
so what makes you think
you can bring
john glenn home safely 
let me say first   
discovery is never
just for the sake
of discovery  gentlemen   
but for the sake
of human survival 
and it will always
come with a risk 
whoever gets there first
will make the rules 
that s been true
of every civilization 
and so  i think
the bigger question
for this body to consider is   
who do you want calling
the shots in space 
we have to know
what s out there  senator 
we have to touch the stars 
if only to ensure
our own survival 
and only a man can do that 
we ll get john glenn home safely
because we have to 
because he has to tell us
what he saw 
the redstone rocket
went straight up 
but the capsule
didn t have enough speed
to go into orbit 
so it came back down 
essentially a triangle 
earth  sub orbit  earth 
that math was known 
that took shepard  took grissom 
that cannot take glenn 
now  the atlas rocket   
that can push us into orbit 
goes up  delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit 
earth s gravity
keeps pulling at it
but it s going so fast 
it keeps missing the earth 
that s how it stays in orbit 
now  getting it back down   
that s the math we don t know 
yes  katherine 
so the capsule will spin
around the earth forever
because there s nothing
to slow it down 
that s right 
slowing it down at precisely
the right moment 
at precisely the right amount 
that s the task 
yes  katherine 
so it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit   
to a parabolic orbit 
yes 
that s the  go no go  
now at this point 
it s a pin head 
we bring him in too soon   
he burns up on reentry 
that s right 
we bring him in too late   
he s pushed
out of earth s gravity 
and any changes to mass 
weight  speed  time   
distance  friction 
or a puff of wind   
would alter the  go no go  
and we start
our calculations over 
yes 
so we need to be able to
choose this reentry point 
now this  go no go  
this has to be exact 
sam 
these are the latest
redstone numbers
in current capsule data 
obviously  we know
the launch spot 
thanks 
a pentagon briefing
should illuminate
where the navy
needs the recovery zone 
then we work backwards
from there 
and the rest is on us 
so let s get to work 
uh  mr  stafford 
what  katherine 
if i could attend the briefings 
i d be more useful
to the project 
pentagon briefings
are closed door 
yes  but if we don t
have the information
of the changes   
we can t keep up 
i need those changes
as they occur 
as you said  it s a pin head 
katherine  that s the job 
you asked for this assignment 
so just calculate
with what you have 
or we ll find someone who can 
okay 
attagirl 
 chuckles 
what the hell are you doing 
you can t be in here 
who are you 
i m with
the west computing group 
dorothy vaughan  sir 
this is a very delicate
piece of equipment 
i m sorry  sir  i m just
trying to be helpful 
bill  uh huh 
bill  we ve got numbers 
what kind of numbers 
well  i ll be 
what s your name again 
dorothy vaughan 
dorothy vaughan 
sir  the parameters
for friendship 7 
oh  this is all moot 
we re altering the
window on the capsule 
when did this happen 
six minutes ago 
the math is changing 
start over 
sir  if i could attend the
briefings  i could stay current   
katherine  we have
been through this 
it is not possible 
there is no protocol
for women attending 
there s no protocol for a man
circling the earth either  sir 
okay  that is just
the way things are 
colonel glenn s
launch coordinates 
accounting for
the window change  sir 
i have told you this 
computers don t
author reports  fix it 
those are my calculations 
my name should be on it 
that is not the way this works 
paul  what s
happening here 
mr  harrison  i would like
to attend today s briefing 
and why is that 
sir  the data changes so fast 
the capsule changes 
the weight and the landing zones
are all changing  every day 
i do my work  you attend
these briefings 
i have to start over 
colonel glenn launches
in a few weeks 
we don t have the math
figured out yet 
why is it she can t attend 
because she doesn t
have clearance  al 
i cannot do my work effectively
if i do not have all of the data
and all of the information
as soon as it s available 
i need to be in that room 
hearing what you hear 
pentagon briefings
are not for civilians 
it requires
the highest clearance 
i feel like i m the best person
to present my calculations   
you re not gonna let this go  are you 
no  i am not 
and she is a woman 
there is no protocol
for a woman
attending these meetings 
okay  i get that part  paul 
but within these walls 
who makes the rules 
you  sir  you are the boss 
you just have
to act like one  sir 
you keep quiet 
thank you 
good morning 
gentlemen 
 indistinct chatter 
 chatter stops 
this is katherine goble
with our trajectory
and launch window division 
her work is pertinent
to today s proceedings 
come on 
wanna get her a chair 
we have a
confirmed launch window   
get her a chair  please 
yes  sir 
we have a
confirmed launch window
for friendship 7 
let s discuss a landing zone 
the navy needs
a singular landing zone 
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval 
outside of that
we risk the capsule s recovery 
we d like three possible
recovery areas 
we can t cover
half the damn ocean 
with all due respect 
our capsule s being
altered daily 
we re orbiting the earth
at what speed now 
uh   
17 544 miles per hour   
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule
into low space orbit 
well  that s one hell
of a speeding ticket 
 all laugh 
okay 
so we have the vehicle s speed 
the launch window   
and for argument s sake 
the landing zone
is the bahamas 
should be enough
to figure the  go no go  
yeah  in theory  sir 
we need to be past
theory at this point 
we ll be able to
calculate a  go no go 
with that information 
when exactly
is that gonna happen 
 chuckles 
katherine 
have a go at it 
 clears throat 
 inhales deeply 
 sighs 
the  go  point for re entry
is 2 990 miles
from where we want
colonel glenn to land 
if we assume
that s the bahamas   
at 17 544 miles per hour   
upon re entry   
370 feet   
at a descent angle   
of 46 56 degrees 
distance   
velocity squared  sine   
gravity squared 
sine  32 feet 
and the distance would be   
20 530 372 feet   
or 2 990 miles   
or 46 33 degrees 
okay  so that puts
your landing zone
at 5 0667 degrees north   
77 3333 degrees west 
which is here 
right here 
give or take 20 square miles 
i like her numbers 
 all chuckle 
thank you 
jim  that  of course 
is assuming
the capsule hits
the re entry point exactly 
how do we ensure that 
that s the math we don t
have yet  gentlemen 
we re working on it 
katherine 
al  what s it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag 
we re just getting up
to speed here  mr  harrison 
i need more manpower 
i need programmers 
folks to feed the cards 
get them  for crying out loud 
okay 
you re the ibm man  right 
yes  sir 
go pull them out of the sky
if you have to 
let s get ahead of this thing
or i m not paying you 
understood 
i got that one  i got that one 
i m not paying any of you 
me 
vivian  temporarily  yes 
we need the ibm
for glenn s launch 
the lead engineer says
you re good with the cards 
programming and such 
what about the girls here 
human computers can t
calculate an orbital flight
in the time we have 
they ll stay put for now 
what about after now 
 stammering 
after glenn s launch 
nasa s dissolving
the computing groups 
i m not accepting reassignment
unless i bring my
ladies with me 
excuse me 
we re gonna need a lot of
manpower to program that beast 
i can t do it alone 
my gals are ready 
they can do the work 
ladies 
we ve been reassigned 
leave your calculators 
you won t need them
where we re going 
 soul music playing 
 indistinct chattering 
bill  welcome  ladies 
you know what your job is  paul 
find the genius
among those geniuses 
to pull us all up 
we all get to the peak together
or we don t get there at all 
paul  yes 
well  good night  sir 
i don t know what time
i m coming home 
class ends at nine 
you got something to say 
i thought you might need these 
you can refill them with
any weight lead you want 
you see  you just
hit the top like this 
all right 
the lead comes out 
you put the new lead in   
and new pencil 
you gonna make a fine engineer 
you think so 
yes 
and nobody dare stand
in the way   
of mary jackson s dreams 
 chuckles 
myself included 
mary   whispers 
don t make me mad again 
yes  ma am 
and don t make me late  either 
you gonna be late 
i mma make you late 
 chuckles 
you won t be late 
all right  gentlemen 
tonight  we discuss
planck einstein
wavelength relationships 
yes 
i m mary jackson 
i m enrolled 
well  the curriculum
is not designed
for teaching a woman 
i imagine it s the same
as teaching a man 
i don t see a colored section 
should i just take any seat 
thank you 
okay  uh   
 clears throat 
planck einstein 
katherine  the problem   
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit
to a parabolic orbit 
there s no mathematical
formula for that 
because we can calculate
launch and landing   
but without this conversion
the capsule stays in orbit 
we can t bring it back home 
maybe we ve been thinking
about this all wrong 
paul  how s that 
maybe it s not new math at all 
it could be old math 
something that looks
at the problem numerically 
and not theoretically 
math is always dependable 
for you it is 
euler s method 
yes 
but that s ancient 
but it works 
it works numerically 
that s it 
let s type it up 
okay 
huh 
 door opens 
dorothy 
mrs  mitchell 
you re working late today 
seems to always happen that way 
yes  seems to 
 vivian clears throat 
thank you 
i hear the ibm s
up to full capacity 
you certainly
have a knack for it 
my father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics 
you know  i have a few
girls in the east group
that have an interest
in learning more about it 
it is the future 
i may bring them by 
if it s all the same to you 
that s not my decision  ma am 
that would be the supervisor s 
yes  that s true 
good night  mrs  mitchell 
you know  dorothy 
despite what you may think   
i have nothing against y all 
i know 
i know you
probably believe that 
dorothy  good night 
katherine 
good night 
mama 
hey  babies 
mama 
hi 
hey

you are  right 
if y all will let me 
well  go on 
she s already crying 
oh  hush 
this was my mother s ring 
it s beautiful 
she and my father
were married for   
for 52 years 
figure it s about as lucky
a ring as you can get 
the day i met you 
i called my mother
and i said   mom  i met the
woman i want to marry  
what d she say 
she said   she must be
something  jimmy 
 really something  
then what d you say 
i said   no 
 she s more than something 
 she s everything  
now   
i planned on this being
more romantic 
i ll make that
up to you real soon 
it s okay 
but i know marrying you
includes marrying
your girls as well 
amen to that 
i do 
 chuckles 
i didn t ask you yet 
hurry up 
 sobbing 
oh  my goodness 
oh 
my babies  look  girls 
isn t it beautiful 
look  mama 
reporter   on tv  the
mercury atlas space vehicle   
which will put john glenn 
the first american 
into earth s orbit   
has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests 
nasa has confirmed
that the ibm 790
data processing system   
has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission s   
launch and recovery
system calculations 
the modifications
and equipment installations
are progressing on schedule 
yes  sir  right in here 
you wanted to see me  sir 
have a seat 
is there something wrong 
mr  harrison 
no  there s nothing wrong 
in fact  our ibm
is churning out numbers
in fractions of the time
any human can 
present company included 
that s good then 
maybe 
the thing is 
the cape s now insisting
on doing all the backups
down there  on site 
i see 
so we won t be
running backups here 
and truth be told  we can t
keep up with that ibm anyhow 
long story short 
we no longer need
a computer in this department 
progress
is a double edged sword 
let s have you report back
to the west group for now 
we ll see if we can find
another assignment 
thank you  sir 
katherine  i m   
i m sorry about this 
it s out of my hands 
if you can believe that 
i understand 
 sighs 
katherine 
we heard you got engaged 
yes 
that s thoughtful of you 
 gasps 
they re lovely 
mr  harrison s idea  really 
although i suspect his
wife did the picking out 
can t imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers 
now you have a great wedding 
you did good work
around here  katherine 
 inaudible 
 church bells tolling  hello there 
good to see you 
hi  reverend  how you doing 
how are you 
i don t think i felt a thing
the first time i did this 
i was so nervous 
dorothy  you re just
as beautiful
as you were back then 
you think so 
dorothy  mmm 
just a little older 
 gasps 
and a little fuller 
 dorothy laughs 
but you look good 
 sighs 
well  here we go  again 
jules bergman 
project mercury   
named after the winged messenger
of the gods in
roman mythology  today 
three years  two months 
and three days afterwards   
we re ready 
after 10 scheduled attempts   
attagirl 
to try again to put
our first man into orbit   
to put colonel john glenn
into orbit 
colonel john glenn will be the
first american to orbit the earth 
as you can see  there are
thousands of people here today
to witness this historic event 
paul  something s off here 
these landing coordinates
don t match yesterday s 
the ibm just ran them 
well  then the ibm
was wrong yesterday 
right 
or the damn thing s wrong today 
paul  am i right 
it appears so 
al  the ibm s been spot on
up to this point  john 
but we ll run it again 
see what it comes up with 
look  i m gonna be
honest with you  al 
when i fly  i fly the machine 
and right now it seems like
this machine is flying me 
we re on the same page  john 
our guys are on it 
let s get the girl
to check the numbers 
the girl 
john  yes  sir 
you mean katherine 
yes  sir  the smart one 
i mean  she says they re good 
i m ready to go 
all right  we ll get into it 
roger 
sam 
go find katherine goble 
she needs to verify
glenn s  go no go  
or we re staying on the ground 
yes  sir 
 panting 
i m looking for katherine goble 
it s katherine johnson now 
they need you to verify
these coordinates 
 reporter speaking on tv 
and tourists have poured
into cocoa beach for weeks 
took this whole area
surrounding cape canaveral
and florida  really 
and all around the country 
it s as if time   
all right  give her
some space  let her work 
as we await
colonel john glenn s launch 
a truly historic day
for america 
the country has waited
for several months 
through many failed unmanned
atlas rocket tests
and 10 scheduled
manned attempts   
which were canceled
for various mechanical
or system complications 
even the weather   
newscaster 
all the final tests and checks
are being conducted 
john glenn is ready to board
the friendship 7 
reporter  but today we remain
truly optimistic 
and it s a  go  day
in all regards 
the capsule is ready 
the rocket itself is a okay 
and the weather here
at cape canaveral   
anything from langley 
not yet 
we are being told
that mission control at nasa
is conducting
a final check of the launch
and recovery coordinates 
including the  go no go 
calculations   
so crucial
to a safe and successful
launch and recovery 
reporter 2  after years of
waiting  and months of delay 
colonel glenn is finally ready
for that space flight   
that we ve been waiting for
with so much anticipation 
newscaster  these last minute
checks could indicate
a hesitancy on nasa s behalf 
but let us say 
without reservation   
that the safety
of colonel john glenn
is paramount to the mission   
and to the nation itself 
no  sir 
we re still a go 
yes  sir 
 muttering indistinctly 
that s it 
 sighs 
what the devil are you doing 
are you taking a break 
 upbeat music plays 
 singing  yes 
say yeah
yeah
say  yeah 
yeah
don t you know  we never ever
never know what makes us major
your and my alchemy
yes  we can
one and one equals three
yes  we can
i feel it like lightning
in the forest
yes  we can
pick a number  pick a note
harmonize the chords
you re my woman
don t need another
get behind the other
we can lift each other
it s all very well
that we may never   
whoo 
do you have the time 
yes  we can
like a solar system
they re surrounded by you
yes  we can
pick a number  pick a note
harmonize the chords
you re my woman
don t need another

we can lift each other
it s all very well
that we may never

 telephone ringing 
pad 14 
katherine 
come on 
sam  sir  we ve got
pad 14 on the box 
al  all right 
let me in there 
this is langley  we have
the coordinates confirmed 
man   over speakers 
stand by  langley 
al  we can confirm   
the  go no go  point
for re entry is   
16 11984 degrees latitude   
 165 2356 degrees longitude 
the launch window is a go 
the landing coordinates match 
that is very good news  al 
it s a little hard to trust something
you can t look in the eyes 
that s right  colonel 
katherine did manage
to calculate
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal 
i will take every digit you got 
be sure to thank her for me 
gentlemen 
let s launch this rocket 
good luck  friendship 7 
godspeed  langley 
bergman  here
at cape canaveral   
the countdown has resumed   
as colonel john glenn   
is now aboard
the friendship 7   
high above the
atlas rocket on pad 14 
a height of over 93 feet 
so far  the countdown is   
newscaster  these are pictures
from cape canaveral  florida 
the gantry is now moving back 
we are go for launch

20 seconds to seco 
commander  the trajectory
is still a okay 
go for seco 
john  roger that  capcom 
go for se co 
zero g and i feel fine 
newscaster  john glenn reports
everything looks good 
oh  that view is tremendous 
man  roger that  friendship 7 
you are go for orbit 
thank you  capcom 
all right 
ten and a half hours to go 
if we make seven round trips 
i could use a coffee 
newscaster  well  as we
approach the end of the day
here on the eastern seaboard   
colonel glenn is just
beginning his third orbit   
three quarters of the way
across the african continent 
we see he s currently
over zanzibar   
which is the next
tracking station coming up 
thankfully 
the friendship 7 capsule is   
new assignment
came down the pike 
always changing around here 
it s hard to keep up 
seems like they re going
to need a permanent team
to feed that ibm 
how big of a team 
thirty  to start 
thank you for the information 
mrs  mitchell 
you re quite welcome 
mrs  vaughan 
hmm 
we have a warning light 
capcom 7 
i have a warning light 
stand by  seven 
sir  we have a warning light 
what are we looking at  paul 
uh   
the heat shield
may have come loose 
seven  will you confirm
the landing bag
is in the off position 
affirmative  capcom 
al  we need to get him down now 
he could burn up
on re entry 
come on  babies 
there is a man in space 
and we don t want to miss it 
so we gotta hurry 
man  something s wrong
with glenn 
what s going on 
come on  let s go 
come on  hurry up  now 
y all follow me 
we just learned
that the friendship 7   
is in danger of losing
its heat shield 
have you heard
any banging noises   
or anything of this type
at higher rates 
that is a negative  capcom 
this poses a grave danger
to the mission 
tell them not to jettison
the retro package 
man   on radio 
nasa is confirming there is
some sort of malfunction
with the capsule s
heat shield   
and it may not stay in place 
if the heat shield s loose   
the retro package straps
might hold it in place 
will that work 
it will work 
it will hold it until he
reaches the  go no go  point 
it will work 
al  he has
to override the  05g 
do it 
friendship 7   
we re recommending
that the retro package not   
i repeat  not be jettisoned 
this means that you will have
to override the  05g switch 
roger 
is there a reason
for this  over 
stand by  seven 
not at this time  seven 
roger that  command 
i will make
a manual  05g entry   
and bring the scope in  over 
he knows 
man   over radio 
without a heat shield   
there is no way that
colonel glenn can get back
through the earth s atmosphere 
the heat is simply
too overpowering 
a malfunction in the automatic
control system   
is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid like fashion 
thus putting the friendship 7 s
re entry point in jeopardy 
even now  colonel glenn is streaking
toward the united states 
and he must begin
the retro sequence
300 miles west of california   
if he s to reenter
the atmosphere
at the designated point   
and land in the recovery area
700 miles south
and east of florida 
stay tuned to this station
for further details 
commander  you re going to be
using fly by wire
for re entry 
you ll need to maintain
a zero angle  over 
roger  i m on fly by wire 
back it up with manual  over 
keep talking to him 
roger

10 miles visibility 
 distorted speech over radio 
capcom  you re going out 
he s crossing the
communication blackout zone 
there s a real fireball outside 
it s getting
a little hot in here 
 distorted speech over radio 
 distorted speech continues 
capcom  do you copy 
 loud static 
friendship 7 
do you copy   over 
again

do you copy   over 
john  loud and clear  capcom 
 all chattering excitedly 
roger that 
how are you doing 
 laughs relieved 
my condition is good 
that was a real fireball  boy 
commander  roger that 
let s get you all the way home 
john  roger that 
here s hoping these landing
coordinates still hold 
approaching 16 11984 
john  roger 
commander  approaching
minus 165 2356   
in three  two  one 
engaging chutes 
beautiful chute 
how are we looking  capcom 
your  go no go  is good 
landing coordinates
are spot on  7 
john  roger that  capcom 
i ve always wanted to swim
in the bahamas  over 
 all whoop and applaud 
john glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered 
thank you 
john glenn has
splashed down safely   
and is being recovered
by the uss noe 
good job  great job  guys 
al  katherine 
nice work 
you too  mr  harrison

don t worry
what the doubter s saying
yes  it s an uphill battle
but guess who else is playin 
the next time y all in action
and the ghost is in the room
watch you work

i swear just believe
you ll find victory

it s gonna be something
you know the devil

 upbeat music playing 
hey 
oh
 vocalizing 
when i first got here
i defined my way
but the end of the days
were dark
when i was not clear
you showed me my mistakes
but told me keep the pace
don t get lost
so should i not fear  yeah
that s how it feels
when you love me
and you re my sightseer
 cause before i m in a rut
you multiply by 10 times
what they took from me
you send out a branch
from the longest tree
when i m in quicksand
but in my mind
it s really your arm to me
can t believe it  what a
lift and hard to believe
surrender
but there s a difference
surrender  surrender
 cause i understand
explain to me
there s no coincidence
just confirmation
let me see them hands
i was down on myself
and i called you
and your answer is
 what can i do  
so much you do for me
in the sound of my breath
seen all the years
of surrender
just know i m here
reporting for duty
when it feel this good
don t ever let go  go
don t ever let go  oh
when it feel this good
don t ever let go  go
don t ever let go  oh
don t ever let go  oh
hard to believe
surrender
but there s a difference
surrender  surrender
 cause i understand
explain to me
there s no coincidence
just confirmation
let me see them hands
please  just wave
wave  wave
wave  wave wave
in this place
just wave wave
wave your hands
wave  wave
 hip hop music playing 
try to understand the way
i ve been behaving
it s a funny thing
you really gotta see
ls it just your love
that s got me going crazy 
or are my eyes playing with me
ah day your love just
comes shining down
just like the sweetest bees
i feel you from
my root to my crown
it s mighty good to me
like caramel
he s right beside me
my mind s his carousel
it s how he rides me
so there s no parallels
y all know me very well
it s yellow lightning
try to understand the way
i ve been behaving
it s a funny thing
you really gotta see
ls it just your love
that s got me going crazy
or are my eyes playing with me
just like a mirage
i love you like you were gold
just like a mirage
i love you like you were gold
just like a mirage
i love you like you were gold
gold  gold
and i m sorry  baby
for the what ifs  maybes
i ve taken too far
i know i must be looking crazy
i m sorry  baby
for the what ifs  maybes
i take it too far
you know i must be looking crazy
try to understand the way
i ve been behaving
it s a funny thing
you really gotta see
ls it just your love that s
got me going crazy
or are my eyes playing with me
i spent many nights
on my knees praying
