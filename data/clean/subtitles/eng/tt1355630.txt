no matter

the guilt card right now 
we ll let you
pick the music 
and bribery 
honey  guilt and bribery
are the glue that have held
parents and teenagers
together for generations 
don t fight tradition 
fine 
boom 
 rock music playing on stereo 
 singing 
i am a passenger
and i ride and i ride   
i thought you said
i d pick the music 
oh  yah  she s right  teddy 
fire up the jams  sister 
let s hear something old school 
 music stops 
how  bout i kick out
a few tunes
from our favorite
austrian melody maker 
franz schubert 
kat  not that old school 
iggy pop  iggy pop 
denny  teddy  you can listen
to iggy on your ipod 
but nothing after 1978 
you understand me  young man 
teddy  yes  sir 
well  l choose
ludwig van beethoven 
teddy  surprise 
 classical music playing 
mia  i ve always wondered if
mom and dad were disappointed
that i didn t turn out
more like them 
i tried to  i mean  mom and i
went to all of dad s shows 
 rock music playing  dad s
band was called nasty bruises 
embarrassing  i know 
they were what you might
call  big  in our town 
and for a while  everyone
thought they might get bigger 
 music continues 
that was my preschool 
but then one day
in second grade   
 string vibrates 
i wanna play it 
 playing 
cellos are crazy expensive 
so  i borrowed
a crappy one from school 
mom and dad found a student from
a local college to teach me 
and i rehearsed
day and night 
i couldn t get enough 
i love her 
but i m about ready
to stab my eyeballs out 
this is exactly why
i could never procreate 
amen  sister 
 continues playing cello 
mia  i loved the order 
the structure 
but what really hooked me was
that feeling i got in my chest 
it s like my heart was
beating with the cello 
dude   sighs 
she s been at it
since this afternoon 
you want me to tell her
to hang it up for the night 
no 
you go in there you d probably
get clubbed with a bow 
 chuckles 
i wouldn t risk it 
i wonder where
she gets that from 
ah  naw  guys play music
for two reasons 
to get laid and
because they got rage 
but mostly to get laid 
well  that s probably
not her motivation 
no  exactly 
she s not doing it
to get anything 
she s just doing it
out of pure   
we made that 
mia  the next day  dad
came home with a present 
a cello of my very own 
 classical music playing 
isn t it amazing how life
is one thing and then 
in an instant 
it becomes something else 
like here i am  mia 
the girl who thinks
about the cello and adam
and whether a letter
is waiting for me at home 
and just like that   
 tires screech 
 loud crash 
 glass shatters 
 gasps

 mia chuckles 
i loved every minute of it 
all right  hall 
so what s your story 
how did parents like yours end
up having a kid like you 
well  i was certainly bred
to be a rocker  mmm hmm 
but i have this theory
that i was switched at birth 
okay  that explains it 
no  but seriously 
i don t know  i ve always
kind of felt like
this martian in my family 
i don t look like
either of my parents 
my mom s this tough chick
and my dad s all outgoing
and i went and chose
beethoven and the cello 
when i was eight 
i saw this old video
of the ramones playing
i wanna be sedated 
and it felt like
my head exploded 
and i was like   i have to
learn to play the guitar  
so  my uncle hooked me up
with this old fender 
yeah  that thing
saved my life 
you didn t really get those tickets
from a family friend  did you 
that was two weeks
of pizza delivery tips 
why

because i like
to watch you play 
you go to another place

adam  mia 
mia 
 mia playing classical music 
mia  being with adam
was like learning to fly 
it was exciting and scary 
all at the same time 
that spring was
a magical time 
adam s band was
playing bigger clubs
and festival in
different cities 
once he graduated  they started
getting booked even more 
by the fall  record labels
were taking notice 
people were taking
notice of me too 
i was the first high school
student ever invited
to perform solo at
the college s fall recital 
and even though
adam was away a lot 
when he was in town  we spent
all of our time together 
i can t believe i m stuck
at school for another year 
it ll go by fast 
you still thinking of
applying to lewis   clark 
yeah  of course  i mean  they
have a great music program 
i need someplace
with financial aid 
maybe we can live around the
corner from each other 
or we could shorten the commute
and get a place together 
really 
that actually sounds
kinda perfect 
 audience applauds 
kid s good 
whoo 
orderly  sir  i told you
you can t go in there 
what do you mean i can t go in there 
this is bullshit 
orderly  sir 
you can t be in there 
nurse davis 
you need to calm down 
icu visitations
are restricted
to immediate family only 
are you family 
all right  you got me 
i m not family 
come on 
just let him in 
nurse davis 
do i need to call security 
adam 
juilliard 
just look on the computer
like you do
and see what it takes
to get in there 
they say it s
the best there is 
of course it is 
but it s across the country 
you know  and lewis   clark has an
amazing performance studies program 
besides 
my whole life is here 
 sighs 
 rock music playing on stereo 
 lowers volume 
dad  can i ask you
a question 
always 
do you ever miss
being in your band 
what brought this on 
you always say that you left your
band to become a better dad 
but you were a great dad
when you were in the band 
you didn t have to give up something
you loved so much just for us 
no  baby  i didn t give anything up 
 sighs 
i played
that adventure out 
and then it was time for a
new adventure with you guys 
and sometimes
you make choices in life 
and sometimes
choices make you 
does that make
any sense 
yeah  i mean 
i think that the cello
was a choice that made me 
there you go 
 sighs 
 increases volume 
do you think the band
would ever relocate 
no  why 
i don t know 
to see someplace new 
maybe new york 
i can t imagine  portland s
where we re from  you know 
oh  yeah

wish you would ve told me 
what  like you told
me about juilliard 
and for the record  i didn t
even hear about the tour
until tonight right
before the show  so   
so that s what  glad you could
make it  was all about 
that s why you re
so pissed at me 
why would i be pissed about
you going to a school
3 000 miles away 
i m not going there  adam 
it s just an audition 
which you didn t even
tell me about  mia 
and besides  this isn t
about juilliard 
this is about you
ditching on our plans 
you re a liar 
whoa 
screw you  adam  i haven t
ditched out on anything 
am i crazy 
or did you say that
us getting a place together
would be perfect  huh 
it s   
no  you know what 
it s fine 
whatever 
what  you get to
follow your dreams 
but i can t follow mine unless
i have your permission 
and i just have to sit
here and wait around 
hoping that you ll come
home every few weeks 
how is that fair 
you lied to me  mia 
we had plans 
one minute  it s one thing  the
next minute  it s the other 
i grew up with
that shit  okay 
i don t need it 
even if i do go
to juilliard 
we can figure it out 
baby  we can text
and we can skype   
skype  skype 
jesus  mia 
have you ever even
had a long distance
relationship 
it s bullshit 
okay  it s like
dating a ghost 
but skype  it solves
everything right 
you know 
you re so naive  man 
you don t know
shit about the world 
i can t believe you
just said that to me 
what  you want me
to write it down for you 
 van honking  liz  adam 
sorry  dude  but we gotta jet
if we wanna make it
to the motel before sunup 
no  no  you cannot
leave me like that

terrified of losing you 
you know what  you do your thing 
i m gonna do mine 
fine  but for the record  you re
the one who s getting in the van 
yeah  whatever 
 van starting 
 ballad playing 
liddy  mr  and mrs  hall 
gramps  yes 
so  mia s still unconscious 
the respiratory therapists
are going to run some tests
to see when they can wean
her off the ventilator 
so  that s good news 
if she can breathe
on her own 
with comatose patients  the
first 24 hours are critical 
if she shows any
signs of awareness   
kim  adam 
i m sorry  i gotta go 
 ballad playing 
 singing 
woke up this morning   
 teacher talking indistinctly 
looked up this morning
saw the roses
full of thorns   
the food was good but the service
is a little  you know   
well  i m sorry  it s
just the way things are 
gran  that s not necessary 
when are we gonna
open presents 
mia 
kat  that s gonna be fun 
yeah  you wanna do that 
yeah  sure 
i ve gone all around
till there s nothing
left to say
wrote it all down
into something that
couldn t be said
i thought you were
supposed to be  uh 
in seattle 
no show tonight
so i just
thought i d drive
down for the day 
mia  what s that 
adam  it s a replica 
of jolari hall
in san francisco 
where you ll be
auditioning for juilliard 
that s the ceiling 
i put it up there 
mia  it s intense 
yeah  i figured 
you know  if you
look at it every night
it wouldn t seem so scary
when you get there 
what do you want  adam 
mia  i m sorry 
i know  i suck 
no  no 
you can t just disappear
from my life like that
and pop back into it
whenever you feel like it 
i know  it s just 
the people in my life have a
habit of disappearing on me
and when you
started making plans   
you re not gonna lose me 
adam  i love you 
but these last few days
have been brutal 
i know 
i know  for me too 
happy birthday 
well  at least i know
the wrapping s yours 
shut up  and just open it 
come on 
it s a cello and a guitar 
do you get it 
 sighs  god  i hate you 
when did you
know you were good 
oh  l dunno 
liar 
no  i mean  the guitar 
come on 
what was  like  the moment 
actually 
there was one night 
when we first
started playing out 
right before the show  liz talked
me into going to the liquor store
and getting her a red bull 
so l go in
and there s this drunk dude
buying a bottle of jack 
and i realize it s him 
it s my old man 
and i just
stop cold 
and he just looks
right at me
and walks out 
no idea who i was 
shit  adam 
then that night 
i played like i was on fire 
i don t know if i
thought i was good 
i just knew that
nothing else mattered 
till now 
till you 
 breathes deeply 
when i play 
i kind of picture
myself inside the cello 
it s like my little house 
really 
actually  no 
i m totally just
in it for the guys 
oh 
i got you  didn t i 
yeah 
yeah 
 machine beeping 
mia  how am i supposed to
find the strength to stay 
what would it feel like
to wake up an orphan 
to never smell dad
cooking pancakes 
to never stand next to mom quietly
talking as we do the dishes 
but how could i go 
the nurse said
i control this whole thing 
if i live  if i die 
it s all up to me 
and that terrifies me
more than anything else 
man  mia hall 
good luck 
 mia chuckles 
 playing classical music 
 song ends 
 panting 
thanks for
driving me  gramps 
i mean  that was   
 exhales 
thank you 
mia 
i just wanted to
tell you that
i watched your audition 
from backstage 
i wasn t too sure
if that cello was
gonna make it out alive 
i know  i didn t know
i had it in me 
well  you do 
you were fearless 
you played your
guts out up there 
mia 
you ve got something special 
your dad had it too 
but i never told him 
i never made too much
fuss about his music
and i don t wanna make
the same mistake with you 
if those juilliard
people don t take you 
they are damn fools
because what you did
up there was magic 
thank you  gramps 
 guitar playing ballad 
adam   singing 
i spend these hollow nights
all alone
safe from the looking glass
which you kept home
i saw the sea and knew
it was a mirage
it wasn t even so
i played the odds
i never wanted to go
and now i m letting you know
i just wanted to feel
the life in me
 song ends 
 mia clapping

playing to statues 
oh  come on  i bet you did
better than you think 
and if not

adam  i played better than
i have in my entire life

and the music  it just   
it poured out of me 
god  i ve never felt
anything like that before 
wow 
i wish i could ve
seen that 
yeah  me too 
you know  for once 
i actually felt
like i could do this 
why didn t you call me
after the audition to brag 
i know i should
have  but   
i don t wanna fight  okay 
i know 
i don t wanna fight 
 sighs 
okay  well  you played better than
you have in your entire life 
we should celebrate 
 ballad playing 
so how come you ve never
written a song for me 
i don t know

 laughs

but what do i know  right 
i m only 17 
you know plenty 
it s just very inconvenient to
fall in love when you re 17 
especially if
it s the real thing 
you know  if we weren t
musicians  we could just   
we could just go
to college together 
you know 
like normal people do 
there s no such
thing as normal  mia 
every relationship is rough 
i don t have to
tell you that 
yeah  i know 
don t blame it on music 
yeah  but music s the reason
we re breaking up 
that is bullshit  mia 
you know that 
what am i gonna do 
i am being completely
torn in half 
you re going to
go to juilliard
and play the hell
out of your cello 
or you re not 
you re gonna stay with adam
and have lots of
amazing adventures 
or you re not 
or maybe tomorrow  the earth s
gonna smash into a meteor 
or it s not 
life is this big fat
gigantic stinking mess 
but that s the beauty
of it too 
whatever you do 
i support you 
either way  you win 
and also either way there s
something that you lose 
what can i say  baby 
true love s a bitch 
 machine beeping 
gramps 
gramps  what do i do 
i ve been trying to think
of what denny would
want me to say to you 
the kid was a helluva
of dad  wasn t he 
he sure had me beat 
i remember the day
that he quit the band 
he just up and said 
 that s it 
the time has come  
i was surprised 
i never really liked
the way the band sounded 
but i knew how
important it was to him 
and so i asked him  i said 
 why are you quitting  
and he said 
 you make sacrifices
for your kids 
 for your kids  
he said that
without even blinking 
that s why
he quit the band 
for teddy 
for you 
it was when he heard
you play so well 
i think that s when
it clicked for him 
your incredible talent  it   
he just couldn t believe it 
and all he wanted to do
was to give you more 
so  he quit the band 
he sold his drum kit
and he bought you that cello 
sacrifice 
that s what we do for the
people that we love 
and here s mine  mia 
i want you to live 
i want that more than
anything in this world 
i want you to fight
like hell to stay with us 
but  with everybody
else gone 
i know it might
not be what you want 
it might be too hard for you
to keep fighting  so   
if you wanna go 
 voice breaking 
i want you to know it s okay 
it s okay 
i understand 
thank you 
gramps 
 inaudible 
hey 
hey 
so many people
have come to see you
i ve lost count
of them all 
there are like 30 people
in that waiting room 
some are related to
you and some aren t 
but we re your family 
you still have
a family  mia 
 chuckles 
look   sniffles 
this is my favorite
picture of you 
ever
you were so happy that day 
and no matter what 
that s the way i m always
gonna remember you 
mia  the best day of my life was
one i never even saw coming 
it was labor day 
early this fall before things
started to go bad with adam 
in some ways  it was just
like a usual potluck dinner 
but there was
a special feel to it 
people kept on showing up 
all the old friends
from dad s band days
and all the new ones
from adam s band 
willow and henry were there
with their newborn baby 
dad hauled the barbecue
out of the basement
and he and teddy spent
the day flipping burgers 
and when it
started to get dark
henry had the bright idea
to start a bonfire 
 playing upbeat music 
denny  mia 
no way  i m not
playing for you guys 
not for us  with us 
seriously  mia 
if you don t  i will 
and have you ever heard the
sound of a thousand dying cats 
come on  hall 
we re playing together 
i really hate you all 
 all cheering 
woman  all right  mia 
man  gotta play for us  mia 
 playing upbeat song 
 playing along 
mia  i ve always thought of the
cello as a solo instrument 
it s probably why it s always
made me so comfortable 
just me and my cello 
but that night 
sitting around the bonfire 
jamming with adam
and everyone else 
i realized i was wrong 
the cello isn t
a solo instrument 
it s part of something bigger 
 singing 
today is the greatest
day i ve ever known
can t live for tomorrow
tomorrow s much too long
i ll burn my eyes out
before i get out
i wanted more
than life could ever grant me
bored by the chore
of saving face
all   singing 
today is the greatest
day i ve never known
can t wait for tomorrow
i might not have that long
i ll tear my heart out
before i get out
mia  the thing is 
mom and dad
always had their scene 
and adam had his 
and i was always jealous
because i didn t have mine 
until the night
of the bonfire 
that was my scene 
that was where i belonged 
 all continue singing 
that s what
happiness felt like 
but that could
never exist again 
 machine beeping 
 chuckling softly 
 cello playing
classical music 
just after this piece 
 song continues on headphones 
adam 
mia 
don t 
stay 
i know a huge part of your
life is forever ruined
because of what
happened today 
i m not dumb enough
to think that i can fix it 
you can t 
but i went to your house 
and i had to climb up the balcony
to get in like i used to 
and i found this in your mail slot 
 sniffles 
i totally broke and entered
and stole your mail 
so the feds might
be comin  after me 
 dear mia 
 it gives me
tremendous pleasure    
mia  you got in 
to juilliard 
mia  you did it 
i got in 
and if you want me
to come with you  i will 
okay  i ll move to new york 
i ll do whatever you want 
just please stay 
you re my home  mia 
i don t care where we are 
i just care that
we re together 
i know that now 
i will do anything
if you stay 
i can t 
you know i can t 
 sighs 
i m still kinda working
on this thing  but   
 clears throat 
 adam playing ballad 
you wrote me a song 
 singing 
breathe deep  breathe clear
know that i m here
know that i m here
waiting
stay strong  stay gold
you don t have to fear
you don t have to fear
waiting
i ll see you soon
how could a heart like yours
ever love a heart like mine 
how could i live before 
how could i
have been so blind 
 audio distorting 
so blind
you opened up my heart   
kim  you still have a family 
adam   singing 
all your love
ls all i ll ever need
adam  i will do
anything if you stay 
gramps  if you wanna go 
i want you to know it s okay 
adam   singing 
how could i live before 
how could i have lived 
 silence 
 gasps 
mia 
 ballad playing 
 singing  take my mind
and take my pain
like an empty bottle
takes the rain
and heal  heal
heal  heal
take my past
and take my sins
like an empty sail
takes the wind
and heal  heal
heal  heal
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
take my heart
and take my hand
like an ocean takes
the dirty sands
and heal  heal
heal  heal
take my mind
and take my pain
like an empty bottle
takes the rain
and heal  heal
heal  heal
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
 ballad playing 
adam   singing 
i spend these hollow nights
all alone
safe from the looking glass
that you kept home
let s go
i saw the sea and knew
it was a mirage
it wasn t even so
i played the odds
full of black and blues
from all the nights with you
i never wanted to go
i don t want you anymore
i don t want you
to feel the same as me
i never wanted to go
but now i m letting you know
i just wanted to feel
the life in me
i went from solid steel
to broken glass
the darkest side in me
you brought out fast
the things i said were true
i m taking them back from you
i never wanted to go
i don t want you anymore
i don t want you
to feel the same as me
i never wanted to go
but now i m letting you know
i just wanted to feel
the life in me
i miss you
i wish you
will let me be
just leave it
we stopped breathing
