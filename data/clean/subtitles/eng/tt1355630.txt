boom
rock music playing on stereo
singing
i am a passenger
and i ride and i ride
i thought you said
id pick the music
oh yah shes right teddy
fire up the jams sister
lets hear something oldschool
music stops
how bout i kick out
a few tunes
from our favorite
austrian melody maker
franz schubert
kat not that oldschool
iggy pop iggy pop
denny teddy you can listen
to iggy on your ipod
but nothing after 1978
you understand me young man
teddy yes sir
well l choose
ludwig van beethoven
teddy surprise
classical music playing
mia ive always wondered if
mom and dad were disappointed
that i didnt turn out
more like them
i tried to i mean mom and i
went to all of dads shows
rock music playing dads
band was called nasty bruises
embarrassing i know
they were what you might
call big in our town
and for a while everyone
thought they might get bigger
music continues
that was my preschool
but then one day
in second grade
string vibrates
i wanna play it
playing
cellos are crazy expensive
so i borrowed
a crappy one from school
mom and dad found a student from
a local college to teach me
and i rehearsed
day and night
i couldnt get enough
i love her
but im about ready
to stab my eyeballs out
this is exactly why
i could never procreate
amen sister
continues playing cello
mia i loved the order
the structure
but what really hooked me was
that feeling i got in my chest
its like my heart was
beating with the cello
dude sighs
shes been at it
since this afternoon
you want me to tell her
to hang it up for the night
no
you go in there youd probably
get clubbed with a bow
chuckles
i wouldnt risk it
i wonder where
she gets that from
ah naw guys play music
for two reasons
to get laid and
because they got rage
but mostly to get laid
well thats probably
not her motivation
no exactly
shes not doing it
to get anything
shes just doing it
out of pure
we made that
mia the next day dad
came home with a present
a cello of my very own
classical music playing
isnt it amazing how life
is one thing and then
in an instant
it becomes something else
like here i am mia
the girl who thinks
about the cello and adam
and whether a letter
is waiting for me at home
and just like that
tires screech
loud crash
glass shatters
gasps

new adventure with you guys

van honking liz adam

van starting
ballad playing
liddy mr and mrs hall
gramps yes

the respiratory therapists

if she shows any
signs of awareness
kim adam
im sorry i gotta go
ballad playing
singing
woke up this morning
teacher talking indistinctly
looked up this morning

full of thorns
the food was good but the service

mia whats that
adam its a replica
of jolari hall
in san francisco
where youll be
auditioning for juilliard

mia its intense
yeah i figured
you know if you
look at it every night
it wouldnt seem so scary
when you get there
what do you want adam
mia im sorry
i know i suck
no no
you cant just disappear
from my life like that
and pop back into it
whenever you feel like it
i know its just
the people in my life have a
habit of disappearing on me
and when you
started making plans
youre not gonna lose me
adam i love you
but these last few days
have been brutal
i know
i know for me too
happy birthday
well at least i know
the wrappings yours
shut up and just open it
come on
its a cello and a guitar
do you get it
sighs god i hate you
when did you
know you were good
oh l dunno
liar
no i mean the guitar
come on
what was like the moment
actually
there was one night
when we first
started playing out
right before the show liz talked
me into going to the liquor store
and getting her a red bull
so l go in
and theres this drunk dude
buying a bottle of jack
and i realize its him
its my old man
and i just
stop cold
and he just looks
right at me
and walks out
no idea who i was
shit adam
then that night
i played like i was on fire
i dont know if i
thought i was good
i just knew that
nothing else mattered
till now
till you
breathes deeply
when i play
i kind of picture
myself inside the cello
its like my little house
really
actually no
im totally just
in it for the guys
oh
i got you didnt i
yeah
yeah
machine beeping
mia how am i supposed to
find the strength to stay
what would it feel like
to wake up an orphan
to never smell dad
cooking pancakes
to never stand next to mom quietly
talking as we do the dishes
but how could i go
the nurse said
i control this whole thing
if i live if i die
its all up to me
and that terrifies me
more than anything else
man mia hall
good luck
mia chuckles
playing classical music
song ends
panting
thanks for
driving me gramps
i mean that was
exhales
thank you
mia
i just wanted to
tell you that

gonna make it out alive
i know i didnt know
i had it in me
well you do
you were fearless
you played your
guts out up there
mia
youve got something special
your dad had it too
but i never told him
i never made too much
fuss about his music
and i dont wanna make
the same mistake with you
if those juilliard
people dont take you
they are damn fools
because what you did
up there was magic
thank you gramps
guitar playing ballad
adam singing
i spend these hollow nights
all alone
safe from the looking glass
which you kept home

im sorry
oh god its gross

warm water soap
oh god
im such a mess
you know we had this
perfect year
and a half together
and now were just moving
in different directions
is it over
yeah
youre supposed to
break up with someone
because youre not
in love with them
not because youre completely
in love with them
but what do i know right
im only 17
you know plenty
its just very inconvenient to
fall in love when youre 17
especially if
its the real thing
you know if we werent
musicians we could just
we could just go
to college together
you know
like normal people do
theres no such
thing as normal mia
every relationship is rough
i dont have to
tell you that
yeah i know
dont blame it on music
yeah but musics the reason
were breaking up
that is bullshit mia
you know that
what am i gonna do
i am being completely
torn in half
youre going to
go to juilliard
and play the hell
out of your cello
or youre not
youre gonna stay with adam
and have lots of
amazing adventures
or youre not
or maybe tomorrow the earths
gonna smash into a meteor
or its not
life is this big fat
gigantic stinking mess
but thats the beauty
of it too
whatever you do
i support you
either way you win
and also either way theres
something that you lose
what can i say baby
true loves a bitch
machine beeping
gramps
gramps what do i do
ive been trying to think
of what denny would
want me to say to you
the kid was a helluva
of dad wasnt he
he sure had me beat
i remember the day
that he quit the band
he just up and said
thats it
the time has come
i was surprised
i never really liked
the way the band sounded
but i knew how
important it was to him
and so i asked him i said
why are you quitting
and he said
you make sacrifices
for your kids
for your kids
he said that
without even blinking
thats why
he quit the band
for teddy
for you
it was when he heard
you play so well
i think thats when
it clicked for him
your incredible talent it
he just couldnt believe it
and all he wanted to do
was to give you more
so he quit the band
he sold his drum kit
and he bought you that cello
sacrifice
thats what we do for the
people that we love
and heres mine mia
i want you to live
i want that more than
anything in this world
i want you to fight
like hell to stay with us
but with everybody
else gone
i know it might
not be what you want
it might be too hard for you
to keep fighting so
if you wanna go
voice breaking
i want you to know its okay
its okay
i understand
thank you
gramps
inaudible
hey
hey
so many people
have come to see you
ive lost count
of them all
there are like 30 people
in that waiting room
some are related to
you and some arent
but were your family
you still have
a family mia
chuckles
look sniffles
this is my favorite
picture of you
ever
you were so happy that day
and no matter what
thats the way im always
gonna remember you
mia the best day of my life was
one i never even saw coming
it was labor day
early this fall before things
started to go bad with adam
in some ways it was just
like a usual potluck dinner
but there was
a special feel to it
people kept on showing up
all the old friends
from dads band days
and all the new ones
from adams band
willow and henry were there
with their newborn baby
dad hauled the barbecue
out of the basement
and he and teddy spent
the day flipping burgers
and when it
started to get dark
henry had the bright idea
to start a bonfire
playing upbeat music
denny mia
no way im not
playing for you guys
not for us with us
seriously mia
if you dont i will
and have you ever heard the
sound of a thousand dying cats
come on hall
were playing together
i really hate you all
all cheering
woman all right mia
man gotta play for us mia
playing upbeat song
playing along
mia ive always thought of the
cello as a solo instrument
its probably why its always
made me so comfortable
just me and my cello
but that night
sitting around the bonfire
jamming with adam
and everyone else
i realized i was wrong
the cello isnt
a solo instrument
its part of something bigger
singing
today is the greatest
day ive ever known
cant live for tomorrow
tomorrows much too long
ill burn my eyes out
before i get out
i wanted more
than life could ever grant me
bored by the chore
of saving face
all singing
today is the greatest
day ive never known
cant wait for tomorrow
i might not have that long
ill tear my heart out
before i get out
mia the thing is
mom and dad
always had their scene
and adam had his
and i was always jealous
because i didnt have mine
until the night
of the bonfire
that was my scene
that was where i belonged
all continue singing
thats what
happiness felt like
but that could
never exist again
machine beeping
chuckling softly
cello playing
classical music
just after this piece
song continues on headphones
adam
mia
dont
stay
i know a huge part of your
life is forever ruined
because of what
happened today
im not dumb enough
to think that i can fix it
you cant
but i went to your house
and i had to climb up the balcony
to get in like i used to
and i found this in your mail slot
sniffles
i totally broke and entered
and stole your mail
so the feds might
be comin after me
dear mia
it gives me
tremendous pleasure
mia you got in
to juilliard
mia you did it
i got in
and if you want me
to come with you i will
okay ill move to new york

i dont care where we are

ballad playing
singing take my mind
and take my pain
like an empty bottle
takes the rain
and heal heal
heal heal
take my past
and take my sins
like an empty sail
takes the wind
and heal heal
heal heal
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
take my heart
and take my hand
like an ocean takes
the dirty sands
and heal heal
heal heal
take my mind
and take my pain
like an empty bottle
takes the rain
and heal heal
heal heal
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
and tell me some things last
ballad playing
adam singing
i spend these hollow nights
all alone
safe from the looking glass
that you kept home
lets go
i saw the sea and knew
it was a mirage
it wasnt even so
i played the odds
full of black and blues
from all the nights with you
i never wanted to go
i dont want you anymore
i dont want you
to feel the same as me
i never wanted to go
but now im letting you know
i just wanted to feel
the life in me
i went from solid steel
to broken glass
the darkest side in me
you brought out fast
the things i said were true
im taking them back from you
i never wanted to go
i dont want you anymore
i dont want you
to feel the same as me
i never wanted to go
but now im letting you know
i just wanted to feel
the life in me
i miss you
i wish you
will let me be
just leave it
we stopped breathing
