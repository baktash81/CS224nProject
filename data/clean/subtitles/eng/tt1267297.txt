his father was zeus  the zeus 
king of the gods 
his mother  alcmene  a mortal woman 
together  they had a boy 
half human 
half god 
but zeus  queen  hera 
saw this bastard child as an insult 
a living reminder of
her husband s infidelity 
alcmene named the boy hercules 
which means  glory of hera  
but this failed to appease the goddess 
she wanted him dead 
luckily  he took after his father 
once he reached manhood 
the gods commanded him
to perform twelve labors 
twelve dangerous missions 
if he completed them all and survived 
hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace 
he fought the lernean hydra 
he battled the erymanthean boar 
but his greatest labor
was the nemean lion 
this was no ordinary beast 
it had a hide so tough 
no weapon could penetrate it 
but even this monster was no match
for the son of zeus 
what a load of crap 
every word is true 
you know what i think 
this friend of yours doesn t even exist 
laugh all you want 
he s coming  and be warned  gryza 
he despises pirates 
macedonia has been good to us 
plenty of villages ripe for pillaging 
we are here to stay 
finish him 
the more you struggle 
the faster you drop 
indeed  your fleet is strong  i   
yet  as i was about to explain
before i was so rudely interrupted 
the nemean lion was strong  too 
yet  he still destroyed it 
and not with a sword
or a spear or arrows  no 
i did it with my bare hands 
or so they say 
hercules 
is this all the men you have 
there s 40 of us  one of you 
the king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you 
so leave  or die 
i get paid either way 
make him bleed 
five men with a single blow 
still think you can destroy
the son of zeus 
bring me his head 
seems they need
more convincing  autolycus 
that s why we re here 
atalanta 
amphiaraus 
may zeus forgive you 
tydeus 
die  hercules 
ah  good man 
hurry 
hurry  uncle 
uncle  hurry 
hurry  hurry 
any longer  uncle   
and the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions 
the rest of you may go 
but not you 
thirteen 
14 15 153 
  17  18  19  20 
  that was fun 
twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head 
minus the headless ones  let s see 
not a bad night 
you see how the pirates ran 
my story softened their resolve 
their resolve must be broken  lolaus 
when you spread
the legend of hercules 
make it bigger  scarier 
the more they believe
hercules is truly the son of zeus 
the less likely they are to fight 
oh 
aye 
  amphiaraus 
  mmm 
care to join us here on earth 
a lion and a crow in strange alliance 
fighting across a sea of corpses 
if you re going to use those herbs 
amphiaraus  at least share 
huh 
hold it  hold it  hold it  hold it 
fight it 
keep practicing  boys 
so who s next  you  you 
ah 
that s a pretty sight 
one more payday  autolycus 
that s all we need 
then we get to live like
the kings we ve served 
or live simply 
you still dreaming of barbarian lands 
beyond the aegean 
at the shores of the black sea 
that is where i will live out
the rest of my days in solitude 
boring  if you ask me 
maybe so  autolycus 
but i ll never find peace unless
i move as far away as possible 
what of tydeus 
without you to temper his rage 
i fear what he may become 
tydeus will go with me 
civilization has become
too civilized for us 
uncle 
join us 
the girls are eager to welcome you 
see  i told you i knew hercules 
are you his servant 
i m his nephew 
are you  really 
i tell of hercules  twelve labors 
like the nemean lion 
the apples of the hesperides 
the belt of hippolyta
with its buxom naked amazons
and exciting bondage 
  i immortalize him   
  he talks  while the rest of us fight 
it is a wonder
you share the same blood as hercules 
have fun 
  ladies 
  oh   
what do you want with hercules 
my words are for him  not you 
atalanta  it s all right 
you certainly are a hard man to find 
maybe i don t want anyone to find me 
i m not just anyone 
my name is ergenia 
daughter to lord cotys 
your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir 
my father is most unfortunate 
he battles a warlord  rhesus 
our land is torn by civil war 
every day  villages are destroyed 
crops ruined  innocents slaughtered 
we all have problems 
well  perhaps i can convince you
to make our problems your own 
unfortunately  my lady 
hercules is fully committed
till the feast of dionysus 
we could  however 
advance you to the front of the line 
for the right price 
hmm 
i thought heroes fight for glory 
but mercenaries fight for gold 
lord cotys is a rich man 
i like him already 
if you agree to aid him 
he will pay your weight in gold 
eat up 
 a lion and crow in strange alliance  
told you 
where are we going 
it is good to see you safe  my lady 
this war claims more victims every day 
we were concerned  my lady 
thank you  general sitacles 
i was well protected 
ah 
the mighty hercules  an honor 
though not quite as big an honor
as i expected 
general  go tell my father
hercules is here 
uncle  hera  impressive 
it s meant to be 
it took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple 
hera is the patron goddess of thrace 
everyone knows the legend 
how hera seeks to destroy hercules 
perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you 
mother 
arius 
  you re hercules 
  that s right 
my name is arius 
i know all your labors by heart 
you killed the giant geryon
with a single blow 
cleaned the augean stables
in one night 
hercules is probably tired 
and the labor of the hide 
and the labor of the mares 
that s enough  arius  come along 
stay away from him 
men who deal in violence
attract violence 
but he s hercules  he s no mere mortal 
he s the greatest 
lord cotys will see you now 
have you ever met royalty  hercules 
once or twice 
  father 
  ah 
megara 
welcome home  my love 
hercules 
whenever i m here  i imagine
this is what elysium must look like 
well  men like us
have the means
to create our own paradise on earth 
look 
magnificent  aren t they 
well  do not keep us in suspense 
are we safe from the monster hydra 
the hydra s heads  your majesty 
the masks of serpents 
no wonder men thought
they were monsters 
you ve done your sovereign
a great service  come 
let the people have their hero 
all hail king eurystheus 
and the mighty protector of athens 
hercules 
hercules  hercules  hercules 
a man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god 
i only want to be
a husband and a father 
lord cotys awaits 
hercules 
welcome 
an honor to host such a legend 
lord cotys 
but in legend  you fight alone 
my reputation would not exist
without my comrades 
autolycus of sparta 
tydeus of thebes 
atalanta of scythia 
lolaus of athens 
and amphiaraus of argos 
amphiaraus 
the famed seer of argos 
it is said you have glimpsed
your own death 
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die 
what else can you tell of the future 
only what the gods see fit to reveal 
a shame 
it would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war 
the gods can be frustrating sometimes 
lord cotys 
with respect  i fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman 
even if she is an amazon warrior 
i stand corrected 
when the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel 
it was intended as
the high seat of all thrace 
but now thrace is divided 
this war has depleted our forces 
we re left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army 
it takes every one of us
to resist rhesus 
people think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal 
only by a god 
rhesus is a sorcerer 
his magic words confuse men 
bend them to his will 
he leads an army of monsters 
half horse  half human 
centaurs 
  you ve actually seen them 
  they have been seen 
come  hercules 
let me show you what misery
rhesus has brought us 
every week  more refugees arrive
seeking my protection 
most of them covered in blood 
crippled or burnt by rhesus  men 
i feared nothing could ever
be good again  till you arrived 
i m just a mercenary fighting for gold 
how we view ourselves
is of little consequence 
how others perceive us is important 
and your name  like it or not 
is a rallying cry 
i have seen too much reality
to trust in legends  and i am not alone 
nobody has any faith anymore 
the people need a hero 
they need someone to look up to 
my son believes in you 
bring us peace 
and i will believe in you  too 
i m convinced these are good people 
i see  and who s more convincing 
cotys or his daughter 
all the gold on earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts 
maybe  but gold never ages 
which is why
i got them to double our price 
double your weight in gold 
well done 
amphiaraus 
if it be the will of zeus 
which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies 
 hercules  savior of thrace 
or  hercules  a legend is born  
both sound terrifyingly boring 
what are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers 
train them 
oh  shit 
in war  there is one thing
more important than killing 
surviving 
my companions and i will show you
how to stay alive 
so that you may return home
to your farms someday 
autolycus 
shield wall  form 
corpses  every last one of you 
because your shield wall was weak 
dead 
dead 
very dead 
soldier 
many lives depend on you 
when attacked 
lock your feet in the ground 
you understand 
yes  sir 
when a shield wall is strong 
nothing can ever defeat it 
you must learn to work together 
react together 
when you do  each individual
will become a link in a chain
that will be stronger than iron 
i hope the enemy has a sense of humor 
right  today s lesson 
how not to stab yourselves 
it is imperative that we strike now 
my lord  given this opportunity 
ah  there you are 
hercules  my scouts have brought news 
rhesus is on the move 
archers who shoot lightning
from their bows 
and infantry 4 000 strong 
their minds bewitched 
demons march with them 
so now we re fighting demons 
no stranger than the monsters
i hear you faced  hercules 
my lord  rhesus is preparing
to attack bessi lands 
he will be on them within six days 
if the bessi fall  we re next 
unless we intercept him 
your men need weeks  if not months 
of training before they re ready 
the bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe 
if we do not protect them 
then there will be a bloodbath 
face rhesus with an untrained army
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle 
my lord  rhesus is coming 
i vouch my life on it 
the longer rhesus lives 
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed 
assemble your men 
we march tomorrow 
hercules 
the gods have offered us a gift 
we must not squander it 
are your gods going to
be fighting with us 
no 
the son of zeus will 
i ve seen how you watch over hercules 
tell me 
how did a woman 
beautiful woman 
fall in with these hardened men 
killers 
son of zeus need
a woman s protection 
i don t protect him 
i protect you from him 
hmm 
general  from now on  maybe you
should favor the company of your men 
he pulled a knife 
it was only a small prick 
ah 
your mother told you to stay away 
you should listen 
what s wrong with him 
tydeus is my most loyal warrior 
he was born in war 
when l found him 
he was more animal than human 
he never speaks of what he saw 
he never speaks at all 
but he relives it every night 
come 
let s find your mother 
when i grow up 
i want to be a great hero like you 
  like me 
  no hero is greater than hercules 
i know all your labors 
like the cretan bull  you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights 
uh  that s a bit exaggerated 
  and struck it 49 times with your club 
  maybe not quite that many 
until it fell dead and crete was saved 
it s my favorite labor 
also queen hippolyta s belt 
with its buxom amazons
and exciting bondage 
  do you even know what that means 
  no 
  mother 
  arius 
you re supposed to be in bed 
why are you in the hospice 
my mother saves people s lives 
many of our physicians
were killed during battle 
so  out of necessity 
i taught myself the art of healing 
if i could be like you 
i would protect all of thrace
and no one would ever get hurt 
here 
i was going to give this
to someone else 
but i never got the chance 
only a hero may wear this 
but to become a hero 
you must grow strong 
is this the nemean lion s tooth 
  it is 
  thank you 
thank you 
good night 
good night  hercules 
have no fear 
if you fall in the service of a just cause 
your souls will go to elysium 
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes 
like theseus 
odysseus 
and the great achilles 
or if you re lucky  you ll go to hades 
where all the fun people are 
lolaus 
your place is beside lord cotys 
where it s safe 
i ve been giving it a lot of thought 
and i really feel i m ready to fight 
you re a storyteller  not a warrior 
we share the same blood 
and i will not see it shed  chariot 
now 
thracians 
the shield wall is your home 
your shelter 
when you sleep 
the wall is your blanket 
when you fight  the wall is your armor 
the shield wall will
never break formation
as long as there is breath in your body 
remember these words 
and you will taste victory 
  move the army out 
  move out 
halt 
halt 
  halt 
  halt 
we are too late 
rhesus has already been here 
leave the chariots 
we ll go down on foot 
the lion and crow
cross a field of corpses 
i hate being right all the time 
halt 
  halt 
  halt 
this head is rotting 
a week old  at least 
yet some of these bodies are fresh 
uncle 
and we ve walked into a trap 
shield wall  form a single square 
protect lord cotys  lolaus  go 
shield wall 
we re here to help them 
why are they attacking 
this is rhesus  doing 
they say his spells have
the power to cloud minds 
turn comrades against each other 
king s guards  around lord cotys 
amphiaraus  do we die in this battle 
my time s not come yet 
not sure about yours 
that s comforting 
i think he wants a challenge 
hercules  fists have been dipped
in the blood of the hydra 
lethal to anyone but him 
watch 
did you see that 
the gods fight on our side 
hercules  hercules  hercules 
hercules  hercules  hercules 
hercules  hercules 
hercules  hercules  hercules 
battle position 
lady artemis  if i am to fall 
let me be judged   
stand fast 
hold your position 
do not yield 
no retreat  stay in the wall 
hold the lines 
do not yield 
defend lord cotys 
the wall has been breached 
seal up the shield wall 
defend lord cotys 
whip 
hercules 
bring the chariots 
defend your lord 
no 
advance 
advance 
make way 
where is rhesus 
lord cotys 
we came here to save this village 
but  no  they killed half my army 
rhesus 
this is all his doing 
and yours 
i warned you 
your men are brave 
but untrained  unprepared for battle 
give me time to make warriors 
very well 
cover up  before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal 
phineas 
you plead your life 
and i gladly offer it 
i failed to see this trap 
the fault is mine 
spare the other scouts 
general sitacles 
i think we ve lost enough men
for the day  don t you 
but just to avoid
future misunderstandings 
i ll be taking charge
of your scouts from now on 
is that clear 
thank you 
another mistake  i ll end you myself 
i m applying a salve of mint 
chamomile and clay to seal the wound 
this is extract of lithops for the pain 
a powerful sedative 
it should rest you after consuming it 
it may have certain side effects 
i don t need it 
ah  forgive me  i forgot 
no mortal can harm hercules 
and  uh 
your lion s hide is indestructible 
drink  son of zeus 
arius  father was the same 
he distrusted medicines 
where is he now 
taken by the gods
before my son was born 
i m sorry 
i never knew my father 
well  he must have been
very  very strong 
tell me about arius 
oh  he s a good boy 
and someday  he will make a fine king 
do you have any children 
do they live in athens 
thank you for your care 
the sedative will help you rest 
how could you do such a terrible thing 
by law  i should execute you 
but i believe a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live 
so you can walk the earth in torment 
haunted by the knowledge
that you alone are responsible
for the death of your loved ones 
the great hercules 
hands forever stained
with innocent blood 
get out  you monster 
get out 
no 
it happened
again  didn t it  hmm 
another vision of cerberus 
the three headed beast of hades 
the gods show you things
they don t share with others 
there s a word for that  madness 
when we were driven from athens 
i consulted the oracle of delphi
on your behalf 
do you remember her prophecy 
 hercules must finish the labor
that remains unfinished  
and what is that  hercules 
confront the beast that haunts you 
only then will you find peace 
i speak from experience 
no matter how far you run  no matter
how fast you go  the beast will follow 
man cannot escape his fate 
room for one more in your company 
it d be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change 
atalanta doesn t quite count 
no offense 
if only your manhood
was as long as your tongue 
both can satisfy in different ways 
you re a famed storyteller  lolaus 
grace me with a story 
any particular subject  my lady 
murder  of a woman
and her three children 
is it true 
did hercules slaughter his own family 
  who said so 
  oh  soldiers talk 
they say if hercules
ever returns to athens 
king eurystheus will have him executed 
hercules had completed his labors
and returned home  but hera   
no myths  i want the truth 
no one knows the truth 
not for sure 
we found hercules alone 
his wife  megara and the children  dead 
he remembers nothing 
do you believe he is innocent 
we grew up together  both orphans 
trying to survive in the streets of athens 
we found a home in the army 
looked out for each other 
hercules  strength set him apart 
kings of athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions 
the twelve labors 
and he took me with him 
to fight by his side 
and with each mission 
our numbers grew 
scythia  the amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated 
my family was gone 
everyone was gone 
hercules helped me
avenge their murder 
he became my brother in arms 
thebes  the city of corpses 
where we found a single child 
still alive 
hercules took tydeus in when
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal 
you know how a rumor spreads 
how a legend grows 
hercules  deeds were so incredible 
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal 
so we played along 
we encourage people to think
hercules was the son of zeus  it s good 
scares the enemy 
lolaus helps 
he talks nice 
you re very loyal friends 
you re avoiding my question 
hercules is a warrior 
and there is something
that haunts warriors 
it can cloud their minds 
we call it the blood rage 
this rage afflicted hercules 
he made me vow
to keep the world away from him 
to make sure that he would
never harm innocents again 
and that  my lady  is the truth 
the truth 
whatever the truth 
the death of his loved ones
haunts hercules 
only the gods can help him 
if he listens 
come  gather around 
soldiers of thrace  and behold 
when hercules gives an order 
even the gods listen 
zeus  master ironsmith 
using the forges of your own citadel 
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible 
as steel is hewn into shields 
so  too  will you be hewn into warriors 
you shall carry the shield of hercules 
it s lighter 
infused with the souls
of stymphalian birds
from hercules  sixth labor 
spirits of birds 
how does that work  exactly 
well  much as birds take flight 
so  too  are these shields
lighter than air  it s in the fibers  here 
try on the helmet of hercules 
it covers my whole face 
forged after hercules  very own helmet 
when he defeated the demon geryon 
you sure it wasn t your horseshit
that frightened geryon to death 
mmm 
general sitacles 
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of hercules 
leather armor 
mmm 
we will be skewered like pigs 
linothorax 
hewn from the skin of
the erymanthean boar 
it s indestructible 
wait  if it s indestructible 
how did hercules cut it off the boar 
he used an indestructible blade 
one  two 
get up 
next 
again 
both eyes open 
keep practicing 
firmer grip 
elbow up 
good 
shield wall  form 
stand tall 
excellent 
careful you don t cut yourself  boy 
again 
rhesus is here 
close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs 
what did you see 
centaurs  half man  half horse 
hundreds of them 
he saw shadows in the night 
my lord 
i will go ahead into the rhesus camp 
i will bring word of his plans 
if we let them get past mount asticus 
thrace will fall 
you want to stop rhesus 
we ll go through the forest
and they ll never see us coming 
it ll slow down our chariots  a gamble 
i have a plan 
the scouts have returned 
rhesus has made his camp
in mount asticus  72 leagues away 
once these men are ready  we march 
so  have you seen if we win or lose 
the gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter 
what they have told me is that
i m soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell 
when will you die 
within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell 
as always 
the gods are generous with hints 
but cheap on specifics 
cheer up  hercules 
i ve lived  not always well 
but long enough 
i m ready for what s next 
thracians  halt 
shield wall  form 
battle positions 
tydeus 
there is no enemy camp 
this is the right place 
centaurs 
they re real 
it seems that we re expected 
centaurs 
rhesus 
you have come looking for a fight 
and we are happy to oblige 
hercules  the son of zeus 
your legend ends here 
look at me 
do i look afraid 
phineas 
traitor 
hades will have you 
after it has you  my lord 
it is over  cotys 
mount asticus on your front 
the woods at your back 
and my troops outman you three to one 
surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful 
men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner 
you ve made your choice 
go 
in this moment  on this day 
become the man you were born to be 
you have it within yourselves
to write your own legends 
let it be to death or victory 
charge 
shield wall 
flanks out 
maybe today 
now 
watch as the amazon
uses the arrows of artemis   
silence  boy 
spears forward 
archers  ready 
loose 
advance 
set them aflame 
take cover 
defend lord cotys 
maybe not 
shield wall  attack 
push forward 
to kill a snake  cut off its head 
victory is yours  lord cotys 
it is not over yet 
fucking centaurs 
hail  lord cotys  hail  lord cotys 
hail  lord cotys  hail  lord cotys 
hail  lord cotys 
halt 
get up 
get up 
  up 
  enough 
you helped a tyrant enslave a nation 
all i did was stop you from
burning more villages 
i burned no villages 
then who did 
ask yourself  if cotys is beloved 
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work 
keep moving  dog 
you ve been fighting on the wrong side 
where are you going 
i m taking some water to the prisoner 
sit down 
it s time 
thrace is finally united 
one land 
one king 
one thrace 
one land 
one king  one thrace 
thrace is not a man  a king  or a god 
thrace is her people 
who cares what rhesus claims 
our work is done 
let s collect our fee and be gone 
don t do anything foolish 
where are you going 
i saw pity in your eyes for rhesus 
why 
look at me 
cotys is responsible for this war 
isn t he 
you lie very well 
clearly  your father s daughter 
i didn t do it for my father 
i did it for my son 
if i disobeyed cotys or resisted
in any way  arius would be executed 
i did what any mother would 
i protected my child 
my husband was king 
and cotys poisoned him
to take his place 
rhesus fought back  civil war broke out 
arius is the legitimate king 
my father is old 
he will not live forever 
and once he is gone 
my son will be a good king 
and he will heal this land 
that s a dream 
and you can help 
please  when you leave thrace 
take arius with you 
please keep him safe 
find another savior 
hercules 
the king commands your presence 
my lady 
ah  champion of thrace 
something tells me
we re not gonna get paid 
  you could be right 
  oh  shit 
you wanted conquerors  not heroes 
you betrayed me  cotys 
betrayed 
a mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold
can hardly presume to
judge his employers 
let s not quibble about details 
we all know your legend  hercules 
but here is mine 
when i was a general
in the army of thrace 
i had dreams of ruling this kingdom 
but thanks to you 
my dreams have grown 
i now crave an empire 
my thousands will train more thousands 
and they even more 
the lessons of hercules will spread 
what you began here
can never be stopped 
and if you fear
what such an army may do 
then lead it 
you want me to serve you 
spare me the moral outrage 
child killer 
getting us all killed  bad idea 
well  i must take this as a  no

our fortunes in macedonia

on my hands 
i can t leave without setting this right 
oh  i see

thrace needs our help 
to hell with thrace  we have gold 
you remember the black sea 
that beach you spoke of is within reach

i would never be free 
in this fight  you re alone 
never saw that one coming 
  how can you just walk away 
  you can t just leave

  it s all right 
you ve sacrificed your lives for me 
now you can finally be free 
whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid 
debt 
you think we follow you
because we owe you 
look around  hercules 
we re family 
all we have is each other 
we will fight for you 
and if it s our time  we will die for you 
because you would die for us 
take that  too  i have no need of it 
this is madness 
you want madness 
tonight  a spear of flame
will pierce my heart 
is that not the most insane death
you ve ever heard of 
crazy  the lot of you 
autolycus 
lolaus  go with autolycus

uncle  all i ve ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others

i overheard her
conspiring with hercules 
they were planning to remove
the young prince from your protection 
no 
let go of him  don t touch him 
arius  no 
no  you re hurting him  no 
hercules  no  help me  stop

  arius  no 
arius  no 
magnificent  aren t they 
an extraordinary species 
incredibly loyal 
as long as they re fed 
  remember them 
  eurystheus 
they remember you 
confused  hercules 
kingdoms are won with armies 
but empires are made by alliances 
king eurystheus and i
will now rule all of greece 
cerberus only exists in my mind 
speak a little louder  hercules 
i didn t quite catch that 
the wolves 
they were there that night 
the wolves were there 
you drugged me 
the wolves were there
the night my family was murdered 
my men told me
how your children screamed
as my wolves gnawed on their bones 
as their fangs despoiled your daughter s
pure flesh 
when the people called out your name
louder than mine 
you see  when they saw you as a god 
how long before
they saw you as their king 
i wanted nothing 
precisely  your sin  hercules 
was that you had no ambition 
i can deal with an ambitious man 
he can be bought 
but a man who wants nothing
has no price 
killing you would have
turned athens against me 
i had to ruin your name 
my wife 
my children 
well  you have our permission
to join them in death 
all of you 
starting with my faithless daughter 
no  get off me 
no  no  no 
unhand me  no 
she s your own flesh and blood 
i will raise arius to be
my worthy successor 
you stay away from my boy 
you monster  you bastard 
  you are a monster  you are a monster 
  no 
you are not a man 
you re a demon 
who are you 
are you a murderer 
damn you  i curse you 
are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent 
stay away from my son 
are you only the legend 
or are you the truth behind the legend 
no  father  please  please  please 
we believe in you 
we have faith in you 
have faith in yourself 
save me 
remember the man
that you are 
father  the gods will punish you 
you cannot escape this time 
remember the deeds
you have performed 
the labors you have accomplished 
no  no 
  stop it 
  leave her alone 
now  tell me 
please 
who are you 
i am hercules 
unleash the wolves 
get away 
ahh 
three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion 
ahh 
hurry 
  hurry 
  hurry 
no 
ahh 
the gods have revealed your innocence 
the final labor is complete 
but i m just getting started 
doesn t take a vision to know
what s waiting for us up there 
my time 
excuse me 
that was my moment  my fate 
you re welcome 
i m going after eurystheus 
hercules  listen to me 
none of this is my fault 
you see  cotys poisoned my mind 
turned me against you 
i like you 
no  stop 
i command you to stop  i m your king 
you took an oath to obey me 
you swore to zeus 
wait  wait  wait 
you fight for gold  i have plenty of gold 
name your price 
find it in your heart to forgive 
you want forgiveness 
ask my family for forgiveness 
i ve never killed a god before 
i really think i m ready to fight now 
well done  warrior 
  eurystheus 
  dead 
  we need to find arius 
  follow me 
soldiers of thrace 
you followed me in battle 
follow me now 
don t be fools 
hercules is mortal  not a god 
anyone who sides with him will die 
and i will show you 
bring him 
  arius 
  mama

you failed to save
your children  hercules 
but you may yet save him 
please  father  no

as you said  hercules 
there is no way to defeat a shield wall 
there is no way out 
come out and face me 
you re no hero  you re no god 
you re nothing but a mercenary 
your wife and children deserved to die 
what re you doing

hercules  hercules

the truth about hercules 
there it is 
to be honest  i prefer it to the legend 
the world needs a hero
they can believe in 
is he actually the son of zeus 
i don t think it really matters 
you don t need to be
