his father was zeus the zeus
king of the gods
his mother alcmene a mortal woman
together they had a boy
half human
half god
but zeus queen hera
saw this bastard child as an insult
a living reminder of
her husbands infidelity
alcmene named the boy hercules
which means glory of hera
but this failed to appease the goddess
she wanted him dead
luckily he took after his father
once he reached manhood
the gods commanded him
to perform twelve labors
twelve dangerous missions
if he completed them all and survived
hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace
he fought the lernean hydra
he battled the erymanthean boar
but his greatest labor
was the nemean lion
this was no ordinary beast
it had a hide so tough
no weapon could penetrate it
but even this monster was no match
for the son of zeus
what a load of crap
every word is true
you know what i think
this friend of yours doesnt even exist
laugh all you want
hes coming and be warned gryza
he despises pirates
macedonia has been good to us
plenty of villages ripe for pillaging
we are here to stay
finish him
the more you struggle
the faster you drop
indeed your fleet is strong i
yet as i was about to explain
before i was so rudely interrupted
the nemean lion was strong too
yet he still destroyed it
and not with a sword
or a spear or arrows no
i did it with my bare hands
or so they say
hercules
is this all the men you have
theres 40 of us one of you
the king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you
so leave or die
i get paid either way
make him bleed
five men with a single blow
still think you can destroy
the son of zeus
bring me his head
seems they need
more convincing autolycus
thats why were here
atalanta
amphiaraus
may zeus forgive you
tydeus
die hercules
ah good man
hurry
hurry uncle
uncle hurry
hurry hurry
any longer uncle
and the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions
the rest of you may go
but not you
thirteen
17 18 19 20
that was fun
twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head
minus the headless ones lets see
not a bad night
you see how the pirates ran
my story softened their resolve
their resolve must be broken lolaus
when you spread
the legend of hercules
make it bigger scarier
the more they believe
hercules is truly the son of zeus
the less likely they are to fight
oh
aye
amphiaraus
mmm
care to join us here on earth
a lion and a crow in strange alliance
fighting across a sea of corpses
if youre going to use those herbs
amphiaraus at least share
huh
hold it hold it hold it hold it
fight it
keep practicing boys
so whos next you you
ah
thats a pretty sight
one more payday autolycus
thats all we need
then we get to live like
the kings weve served
or live simply
you still dreaming of barbarian lands
beyond the aegean
at the shores of the black sea
that is where i will live out
the rest of my days in solitude
boring if you ask me
maybe so autolycus
but ill never find peace unless
i move as far away as possible
what of tydeus
without you to temper his rage
i fear what he may become
tydeus will go with me
civilization has become
too civilized for us
uncle
join us
the girls are eager to welcome you
see i told you i knew hercules
are you his servant
im his nephew
are you really
i tell of hercules twelve labors
like the nemean lion
the apples of the hesperides
the belt of hippolyta
with its buxom naked amazons
and exciting bondage
i immortalize him
he talks while the rest of us fight
it is a wonder
you share the same blood as hercules
have fun
ladies
oh
what do you want with hercules
my words are for him not you
atalanta its all right
you certainly are a hard man to find
maybe i dont want anyone to find me
im not just anyone
my name is ergenia
daughter to lord cotys
your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir
my father is most unfortunate
he battles a warlord rhesus
our land is torn by civil war
every day villages are destroyed
crops ruined innocents slaughtered
we all have problems
well perhaps i can convince you
to make our problems your own
unfortunately my lady
hercules is fully committed
till the feast of dionysus
we could however
advance you to the front of the line
for the right price
hmm
i thought heroes fight for glory
but mercenaries fight for gold
lord cotys is a rich man
i like him already
if you agree to aid him
he will pay your weight in gold
eat up
a lion and crow in strange alliance
told you
where are we going
it is good to see you safe my lady
this war claims more victims every day
we were concerned my lady
thank you general sitacles
i was well protected
ah
the mighty hercules an honor
though not quite as big an honor
as i expected
general go tell my father
hercules is here
uncle hera impressive
its meant to be
it took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple
hera is the patron goddess of thrace
everyone knows the legend
how hera seeks to destroy hercules
perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you
mother
arius
youre hercules
thats right
my name is arius
i know all your labors by heart
you killed the giant geryon
with a single blow
cleaned the augean stables
in one night
hercules is probably tired
and the labor of the hide
and the labor of the mares
thats enough arius come along
stay away from him
men who deal in violence
attract violence
but hes hercules hes no mere mortal
hes the greatest
lord cotys will see you now
have you ever met royalty hercules
once or twice
father
ah
megara
welcome home my love
hercules
whenever im here i imagine
this is what elysium must look like
well men like us
have the means
to create our own paradise on earth
look
magnificent arent they
well do not keep us in suspense
are we safe from the monster hydra
the hydras heads your majesty
the masks of serpents
no wonder men thought
they were monsters
youve done your sovereign
a great service come
let the people have their hero
all hail king eurystheus
and the mighty protector of athens
hercules
hercules hercules hercules
a man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god
i only want to be
a husband and a father
lord cotys awaits
hercules
welcome
an honor to host such a legend
lord cotys
but in legend you fight alone
my reputation would not exist
without my comrades
autolycus of sparta
tydeus of thebes
atalanta of scythia
lolaus of athens
and amphiaraus of argos
amphiaraus
the famed seer of argos
it is said you have glimpsed
your own death
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die
what else can you tell of the future
only what the gods see fit to reveal
a shame
it would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war
the gods can be frustrating sometimes
lord cotys
with respect i fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman
even if she is an amazon warrior
i stand corrected
when the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel
it was intended as
the high seat of all thrace
but now thrace is divided
this war has depleted our forces
were left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army
it takes every one of us
to resist rhesus
people think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal
only by a god
rhesus is a sorcerer
his magic words confuse men
bend them to his will
he leads an army of monsters
half horse half human
centaurs
youve actually seen them
they have been seen
come hercules
let me show you what misery
rhesus has brought us
every week more refugees arrive
seeking my protection
most of them covered in blood
crippled or burnt by rhesus men
i feared nothing could ever
be good again till you arrived
im just a mercenary fighting for gold
how we view ourselves
is of little consequence
how others perceive us is important
and your name like it or not
is a rallying cry
i have seen too much reality
to trust in legends and i am not alone
nobody has any faith anymore
the people need a hero
they need someone to look up to
my son believes in you
bring us peace
and i will believe in you too
im convinced these are good people
i see and whos more convincing
cotys or his daughter
all the gold on earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts
maybe but gold never ages
which is why
i got them to double our price
double your weight in gold
well done
amphiaraus
if it be the will of zeus
which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies
hercules savior of thrace
or hercules a legend is born
both sound terrifyingly boring
what are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers
train them
oh shit
in war there is one thing
more important than killing
surviving
my companions and i will show you
how to stay alive
so that you may return home
to your farms someday
autolycus
shield wall form
corpses every last one of you
because your shield wall was weak
dead
dead
very dead
soldier
many lives depend on you
when attacked
lock your feet in the ground
you understand
yes sir
when a shield wall is strong
nothing can ever defeat it
you must learn to work together
react together
when you do each individual
will become a link in a chain
that will be stronger than iron
i hope the enemy has a sense of humor
right todays lesson
how not to stab yourselves
it is imperative that we strike now
my lord given this opportunity
ah there you are
hercules my scouts have brought news
rhesus is on the move
archers who shoot lightning
from their bows
and infantry 4000strong
their minds bewitched
demons march with them
so now were fighting demons
no stranger than the monsters
i hear you faced hercules
my lord rhesus is preparing
to attack bessi lands
he will be on them within six days
if the bessi fall were next
unless we intercept him
your men need weeks if not months
of training before theyre ready
the bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe
if we do not protect them
then there will be a bloodbath
face rhesus with an untrained army
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle
my lord rhesus is coming
i vouch my life on it
the longer rhesus lives
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed
assemble your men
we march tomorrow
hercules
the gods have offered us a gift
we must not squander it
are your gods going to
be fighting with us
no
the son of zeus will
ive seen how you watch over hercules
tell me
how did a woman
beautiful woman
fall in with these hardened men
killers
son of zeus need
a womans protection
i dont protect him
i protect you from him
hmm
general from now on maybe you
should favor the company of your men
he pulled a knife
it was only a small prick
ah
your mother told you to stay away
you should listen
whats wrong with him
tydeus is my most loyal warrior
he was born in war
when l found him
he was more animal than human
he never speaks of what he saw
he never speaks at all
but he relives it every night
come
lets find your mother
when i grow up
i want to be a great hero like you
like me
no hero is greater than hercules
i know all your labors
like the cretan bull you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights
uh thats a bit exaggerated
and struck it 49 times with your club
maybe not quite that many
until it fell dead and crete was saved
its my favorite labor
also queen hippolytas belt
with its buxom amazons
and exciting bondage
do you even know what that means
no
mother
arius
youre supposed to be in bed
why are you in the hospice
my mother saves peoples lives
many of our physicians
were killed during battle
so out of necessity
i taught myself the art of healing
if i could be like you
i would protect all of thrace
and no one would ever get hurt
here
i was going to give this
to someone else
but i never got the chance
only a hero may wear this
but to become a hero
you must grow strong
is this the nemean lions tooth
it is
thank you
thank you
good night
good night hercules
have no fear
if you fall in the service of a just cause
your souls will go to elysium
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes
like theseus
odysseus
and the great achilles
or if youre lucky youll go to hades
where all the fun people are
lolaus
your place is beside lord cotys
where its safe
ive been giving it a lot of thought
and i really feel im ready to fight
youre a storyteller not a warrior
we share the same blood
and i will not see it shed chariot
now
thracians
the shield wall is your home
your shelter
when you sleep
the wall is your blanket
when you fight the wall is your armor
the shield wall will
never break formation
as long as there is breath in your body
remember these words
and you will taste victory
move the army out
move out
halt
halt
halt
halt
we are too late
rhesus has already been here
leave the chariots
well go down on foot
the lion and crow
cross a field of corpses
i hate being right all the time
halt
halt
halt
this head is rotting
a week old at least
yet some of these bodies are fresh
uncle
and weve walked into a trap
shield wall form a single square
protect lord cotys lolaus go
shield wall
were here to help them
why are they attacking
this is rhesus doing
they say his spells have
the power to cloud minds
turn comrades against each other
kings guards around lord cotys
amphiaraus do we die in this battle
my times not come yet
not sure about yours
thats comforting
i think he wants a challenge
hercules fists have been dipped
in the blood of the hydra
lethal to anyone but him
watch
did you see that
the gods fight on our side
hercules hercules hercules
hercules hercules hercules
hercules hercules
hercules hercules hercules
battle position
lady artemis if i am to fall
let me be judged
stand fast
hold your position
do not yield
no retreat stay in the wall
hold the lines
do not yield
defend lord cotys
the wall has been breached
seal up the shield wall
defend lord cotys
whip
hercules
bring the chariots
defend your lord
no
advance
advance
make way
where is rhesus
lord cotys
we came here to save this village
but no they killed half my army
rhesus
this is all his doing
and yours
i warned you
your men are brave
but untrained unprepared for battle
give me time to make warriors
very well
cover up before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal
phineas
you plead your life
and i gladly offer it
i failed to see this trap
the fault is mine
spare the other scouts
general sitacles
i think weve lost enough men
for the day dont you
but just to avoid
future misunderstandings
ill be taking charge
of your scouts from now on
is that clear
thank you
another mistake ill end you myself
im applying a salve of mint
chamomile and clay to seal the wound
this is extract of lithops for the pain
a powerful sedative
it should rest you after consuming it
it may have certain side effects
i dont need it
ah forgive me i forgot
no mortal can harm hercules
and uh
your lions hide is indestructible
drink son of zeus
arius father was the same
he distrusted medicines
where is he now
taken by the gods
before my son was born
im sorry
i never knew my father
well he must have been
very very strong
tell me about arius
oh hes a good boy
and someday he will make a fine king
do you have any children
do they live in athens
thank you for your care
the sedative will help you rest
how could you do such a terrible thing
by law i should execute you
but i believe a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live
so you can walk the earth in torment
haunted by the knowledge
that you alone are responsible
for the death of your loved ones
the great hercules
hands forever stained
with innocent blood
get out you monster
get out
no
it happened
again didnt it hmm
another vision of cerberus
the threeheaded beast of hades
the gods show you things
they dont share with others
theres a word for that madness
when we were driven from athens
i consulted the oracle of delphi
on your behalf
do you remember her prophecy
hercules must finish the labor
that remains unfinished
and what is that hercules
confront the beast that haunts you
only then will you find peace
i speak from experience
no matter how far you run no matter
how fast you go the beast will follow
man cannot escape his fate
room for one more in your company
itd be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change
atalanta doesnt quite count
no offense
if only your manhood
was as long as your tongue
both can satisfy in different ways
youre a famed storyteller lolaus
grace me with a story
any particular subject my lady
murder of a woman
and her three children
is it true
did hercules slaughter his own family
who said so
oh soldiers talk
they say if hercules
ever returns to athens
king eurystheus will have him executed
hercules had completed his labors
and returned home but hera
no myths i want the truth
no one knows the truth
not for sure
we found hercules alone
his wife megara and the children dead
he remembers nothing
do you believe he is innocent
we grew up together both orphans
trying to survive in the streets of athens
we found a home in the army
looked out for each other
hercules strength set him apart
kings of athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions
the twelve labors
and he took me with him
to fight by his side
and with each mission
our numbers grew
scythia the amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated
my family was gone
everyone was gone
hercules helped me
avenge their murder
he became my brotherinarms
thebes the city of corpses
where we found a single child
still alive
hercules took tydeus in when
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal
you know how a rumor spreads
how a legend grows
hercules deeds were so incredible
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal
so we played along
we encourage people to think
hercules was the son of zeus its good
scares the enemy
lolaus helps
he talks nice
youre very loyal friends
youre avoiding my question
hercules is a warrior
and there is something
that haunts warriors
it can cloud their minds
we call it the blood rage
this rage afflicted hercules
he made me vow
to keep the world away from him
to make sure that he would
never harm innocents again
and that my lady is the truth
the truth
whatever the truth
the death of his loved ones
haunts hercules
only the gods can help him
if he listens
come gather around
soldiers of thrace and behold
when hercules gives an order
even the gods listen
zeus master ironsmith
using the forges of your own citadel
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible
as steel is hewn into shields
so too will you be hewn into warriors
you shall carry the shield of hercules
its lighter
infused with the souls
of stymphalian birds
from hercules sixth labor
spirits of birds
how does that work exactly
well much as birds take flight
so too are these shields
lighter than air its in the fibers here
try on the helmet of hercules
it covers my whole face
forged after hercules very own helmet
when he defeated the demon geryon
you sure it wasnt your horseshit
that frightened geryon to death
mmm
general sitacles
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of hercules
leather armor
mmm
we will be skewered like pigs
linothorax
hewn from the skin of
the erymanthean boar
its indestructible
wait if its indestructible
how did hercules cut it off the boar
he used an indestructible blade
one two
get up
next
again
both eyes open
keep practicing
firmer grip
elbow up
good
shield wall form
stand tall
excellent
careful you dont cut yourself boy
again
rhesus is here
close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs
what did you see
centaurs half man half horse
hundreds of them
he saw shadows in the night
my lord
i will go ahead into the rhesus camp
i will bring word of his plans
if we let them get past mount asticus
thrace will fall
you want to stop rhesus
well go through the forest
and theyll never see us coming
itll slow down our chariots a gamble
i have a plan
the scouts have returned
rhesus has made his camp
in mount asticus 72 leagues away
once these men are ready we march
so have you seen if we win or lose
the gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter
what they have told me is that
im soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell
when will you die
within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell
as always
the gods are generous with hints
but cheap on specifics
cheer up hercules
ive lived not always well
but long enough
im ready for whats next
thracians halt
shield wall form
battle positions
tydeus
there is no enemy camp
this is the right place
centaurs
theyre real
it seems that were expected
centaurs
rhesus
you have come looking for a fight
and we are happy to oblige
hercules the son of zeus
your legend ends here
look at me
do i look afraid
phineas
traitor
hades will have you
after it has you my lord
it is over cotys
mount asticus on your front
the woods at your back
and my troops outman you three to one
surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful
men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner
youve made your choice
go
in this moment on this day
become the man you were born to be
you have it within yourselves
to write your own legends
let it be to death or victory
charge
shield wall
flanks out
maybe today
now
watch as the amazon
uses the arrows of artemis
silence boy
spears forward
archers ready
loose
advance
set them aflame
take cover
defend lord cotys
maybe not
shield wall attack
push forward
to kill a snake cut off its head
victory is yours lord cotys
it is not over yet
fucking centaurs
hail lord cotys hail lord cotys
hail lord cotys hail lord cotys
hail lord cotys
halt
get up
get up
up
enough
you helped a tyrant enslave a nation
all i did was stop you from
burning more villages
i burned no villages
then who did
ask yourself if cotys is beloved
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work
keep moving dog
youve been fighting on the wrong side
where are you going
im taking some water to the prisoner
sit down
its time
thrace is finally united
one land
one king
one thrace
one land
one king one thrace
thrace is not a man a king or a god
thrace is her people
who cares what rhesus claims
our work is done
lets collect our fee and be gone
dont do anything foolish
where are you going
i saw pity in your eyes for rhesus
why
look at me
cotys is responsible for this war
isnt he
you lie very well
clearly your fathers daughter
i didnt do it for my father
i did it for my son
if i disobeyed cotys or resisted
in any way arius would be executed
i did what any mother would
i protected my child
my husband was king
and cotys poisoned him
to take his place
rhesus fought back civil war broke out
arius is the legitimate king
my father is old
he will not live forever
and once he is gone
my son will be a good king
and he will heal this land
thats a dream
and you can help
please when you leave thrace
take arius with you
please keep him safe
find another savior
hercules
the king commands your presence
my lady
ah champion of thrace
something tells me
were not gonna get paid
you could be right
oh shit
you wanted conquerors not heroes
you betrayed me cotys
betrayed
a mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold
can hardly presume to
judge his employers
lets not quibble about details
we all know your legend hercules
but here is mine
when i was a general
in the army of thrace
i had dreams of ruling this kingdom
but thanks to you
my dreams have grown
i now crave an empire
my thousands will train more thousands
and they even more
the lessons of hercules will spread
what you began here
can never be stopped
and if you fear
what such an army may do
then lead it
you want me to serve you
spare me the moral outrage
child killer
getting us all killed bad idea
well i must take this as a no
in that case
your services are no longer required
you will be paid in full
bring them the gold
if we hurry we can be spending
our fortunes in macedonia
take mine too
what do you think youre doing
lets go
there will be no more innocent blood
on my hands
i cant leave without setting this right
oh i see
and whos gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor
thrace needs our help
to hell with thrace we have gold
you remember the black sea
that beach you spoke of is within reach
leave now be free
i would never be free
in this fight youre alone
never saw that one coming
how can you just walk away
you cant just leave
why not
its all right
youve sacrificed your lives for me
now you can finally be free
whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid
debt
you think we follow you
because we owe you
look around hercules
were family
all we have is each other
we will fight for you
and if its our time we will die for you
because you would die for us
take that too i have no need of it
this is madness
you want madness
tonight a spear of flame
will pierce my heart
is that not the most insane death
youve ever heard of
crazy the lot of you
autolycus
lolaus go with autolycus
i think ill stay
nephew
uncle all ive ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others
its time i stopped telling their stories
started living my own
well you may have all
completely lost your minds but not me
not me
autolycus
live like a king my friend
what about cotys
he paid us to save thrace
lets not disappoint him
lay down your arms
lay down your arms
or your nephew dies first
i invite you to join me you refuse
i order you to leave you return
get your hands off me
i overheard her
conspiring with hercules
they were planning to remove
the young prince from your protection
no
let go of him dont touch him
arius no
no youre hurting him no
hercules no help me stop
help no
arius no
arius no
magnificent arent they
an extraordinary species
incredibly loyal
as long as theyre fed
remember them
eurystheus
they remember you
confused hercules
kingdoms are won with armies
but empires are made by alliances
king eurystheus and i
will now rule all of greece
cerberus only exists in my mind
speak a little louder hercules
i didnt quite catch that
the wolves
they were there that night
the wolves were there
you drugged me
the wolves were there
the night my family was murdered
my men told me
how your children screamed
as my wolves gnawed on their bones
as their fangs despoiled your daughters
pure flesh
when the people called out your name
louder than mine
you see when they saw you as a god
how long before
they saw you as their king
i wanted nothing
precisely your sin hercules
was that you had no ambition
i can deal with an ambitious man
he can be bought
but a man who wants nothing
has no price
killing you would have
turned athens against me
i had to ruin your name
my wife
my children
well you have our permission
to join them in death
all of you
starting with my faithless daughter
no get off me
no no no
unhand me no
shes your own flesh and blood
i will raise arius to be
my worthy successor
you stay away from my boy
you monster you bastard
you are a monster you are a monster
no
you are not a man
youre a demon
who are you
are you a murderer
damn you i curse you
are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent
stay away from my son
are you only the legend
or are you the truth behind the legend
no father please please please
we believe in you
we have faith in you
have faith in yourself
save me
remember the man
that you are
father the gods will punish you
you cannot escape this time
remember the deeds
you have performed
the labors you have accomplished
no no
stop it
leave her alone
now tell me
please
who are you
i am hercules
unleash the wolves
get away
ahh
three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion
ahh
hurry
hurry
hurry
no
ahh
the gods have revealed your innocence
the final labor is complete
but im just getting started
doesnt take a vision to know
whats waiting for us up there
my time
excuse me
that was my moment my fate
youre welcome
im going after eurystheus
hercules listen to me
none of this is my fault
you see cotys poisoned my mind
turned me against you
