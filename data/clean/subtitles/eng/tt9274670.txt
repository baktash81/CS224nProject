tornado warnings are
just outside our viewing area

or particularly dangerous
situation tornado watch
what does that mean
for you folks
over at emergency management
well for us it means people
need to be aware and prepared
but shouldnt people
be worried
no prepared is what
people need to be
know where your safe place is
have everything you need
on hand
because if the sirens go off
you will not have time
to go searching
now severe weather
is pretty common
but what about school closures
well the potential today
is heightened
nothings a sure thing
but the ingredients
are coming together
a pds watch means
a potential for numerous
destructive tornadoes
