  hello 
  hi  brad 
kim  today s a day
to be vigilant 
tornado warnings are
just outside our viewing area

or  particularly dangerous
situation  tornado watch 
what does that mean
for you folks
over at emergency management 
well  for us it means people
need to be aware and prepared 
but shouldn t people
be worried 
no  prepared is what
people need to be 
know where your safe place is 
have everything you need
on hand
because if the sirens go off 
you will not have time
to go searching 
now  severe weather
is pretty common 
but what about school closures 
well  the potential today
is heightened 
nothing s a sure thing 
but the ingredients
are coming together 
a pds watch means
a potential for numerous
destructive tornadoes 
   school he  ringing
