okay 
both the people and
the government wanted the purge 
the new founding
fathers came into office   
were voted into office
by a country who wanted change   
this new regime took
advantage of the nation s fear 
i m glad we took
the back roads 
the highways are probably
a mess right now 
yeah 
we ll be there in no time 
yeah 
what are you looking at 
nothing 
just  you know  stuff 
are you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
you sure 
you don t need
to keep asking me 
my name is donald talbot 
our regime was voted into
office nine years ago 
and the first
order of business
was to deal with
the epidemic of crime
that was plaguing
this nation 
the answer was the purge 
you need some protection tonight 
you need something 
hey  man 
we running out of   
hey  that purge tonight 
y all know what time it is 
hitting them in the face
ain t gonna work no more

don t even worry about it 
hey  sweetheart  how you doing 
how you doing 
you gonna need something
for protection tonight

you know what i mean 
we ve lost our
souls to attain this peace

horseshit  where d
you find this lunatic 
i saw his protest posters
all around the neighborhood 
he lives here  papa

the purge is not about
containing crime to one night 
and cleansing our souls
by releasing aggression 
it s about one thing 
money 
who dies tonight  the poor 
we can t afford to
protect ourselves 
that s enough 
i can t listen to this crap

you  too 
whatever happened
to  give me your needy 
 your tired 
 your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free  
the redistribution
of wealth upward
through killing
has to stop 
we must pick up arms 
this year 
we will fight back 
jeez  that guy
freaked me out 
did not
see him coming 
i thought we decided
it was irreversible 
no  you often decide
things on your own 
and then pretend that they
were a joint decision 
you often agree with me 
and then
a week later say 
 i don t remember
doing that  
so  you re calling
me a liar 
and you re calling
me a bully 
just say you changed
your mind 
not that we didn t come
to a joint decision 
this is the exact   
see  this is exactly why we
need to tell your sister
that we re separating 
you re right 
it ll make it real 
but i think we need
to make it real 
maybe i don t wanna
make it real 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
what the hell is that 
the power steering s gone 
what do you mean
