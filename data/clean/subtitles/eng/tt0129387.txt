school ended a couple days later 
and her father got transferred
to florida in july 
so i worked all summer
to pay offthose debts and
well  i never saw mary again 
that was    what 
13 years ago 
that s very interesting 
anyway 
i know it s not the type
of thing you d forget 
but i guess i just    i kinda   
i must have blocked it
out of my head or something 
 cause i was driving down
the highway last week 
and i started thinking about mary 
and all of a sudden
it was like i couldn t breathe 
i mean  i was    i was   
i felt like i was gonna die 
so i pulled offthe road
and i just sorta stopped in this
i guess it was a rest area 
i was just kind of shaking and   
you know 
rest areas are homosexual hangouts 
highway rest areas 
they re the bathhouses ofthe  90s
for many  many  many gay men 
so what    what are you   
what are you saying 
oop  time  she s up 
we ll  uh  delve into that next week 
well  you know  you are a writer 
and writers are artists 
and most artists
are a little foofy  you know 
a little foofy 
thanks for the support 
hey  you guys  i thought
you might like these with your beers 
yes  indeed  ted  help yourself 
i don t think i ll have one 
  you don t want one

not hungry  thank you 
you want a cookie  something like that 
honey  we got cookies 
uh  no  we don t

but it was
it was definitely love  dom 
i mean 
crushes don t last for 13 years  right 
what ever happened to mary 
  she moved with her family to miami 
  so why don t you look her up 
i did
once 
i called  she wasn t listed 
so that s it  you get one little bump
in the road and give up 
it s probably for the best 
after 13 years 
she ll probably think i m a stalker 
you know what you should do
is hire a private investigator 
you know  to find her  follow her around 
she won t know anything 
no way  that s way too creepy 
besides  she s probably married
with a couple of kids by now 
girls like mary   
  they don t stay single 
hey  i ve got an idea 
there s this guy down in my office 
his name s healy 
he s a claims investigator 
he s a hell of a bloodhound 
he goes to miami every couple ofweeks 
he can help you out 
this guy runs a little hot 
but he gets the job done

at 16  he committed his first murder

psychological profile 
the state was forced to release him 
in his mid 20s and again in his early 30s 
he was suspected of homicides
in the states of utah and washington 
unfortunately  the bodies
were so badly decomposed 
there wasn t enough evidence to hold him
