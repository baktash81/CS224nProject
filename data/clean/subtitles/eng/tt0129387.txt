school ended a couple days later
and her father got transferred
to florida in july
so i worked all summer
to pay offthose debts and
well i never saw mary again
that was what
13 years ago
thats very interesting
anyway
i know its not the type
of thing youd forget
but i guess i just i kinda
i must have blocked it
out of my head or something
cause i was driving down
the highway last week
and i started thinking about mary
and all of a sudden
it was like i couldnt breathe
i mean i was i was
i felt like i was gonna die
so i pulled offthe road
and i just sorta stopped in this
i guess it was a rest area
i was just kind of shaking and
you know
rest areas are homosexual hangouts
highway rest areas
theyre the bathhouses ofthe 90s
for many many many gay men
so what what are you
what are you saying
oop time shes up

and writers are artists
and most artists
are a little foofy you know
a little foofy
thanks for the support

it was definitely love dom
i mean
crushes dont last for 13 years right
what ever happened to mary
she moved with her family to miami
so why dont you look her up
i did
once
i called she wasnt listed
so thats it you get one little bump
in the road and give up
its probably for the best
after 13 years
shell probably think im a stalker
you know what you should do
is hire a private investigator
you know to find her follow her around
she wont know anything
no way thats way too creepy
besides shes probably married
with a couple of kids by now
girls like mary
they dont stay single
hey ive got an idea
theres this guy down in my office

hes a claims investigator
hes a hell of a bloodhound
he goes to miami every couple ofweeks
he can help you out
