virginia robert e lee commanding
slips across the potomac
to begin the invasion of the north
it is an army of 70000 men
they move slowly behind the blue ridge
using the mountains
to screen their movements
their objective is to draw
the union army out into the open
where it can be destroyed
late in june the union army
of the potomac 80000 men
turns north from virginia to begin
the great pursuit up the narrow roads
across maryland and into pennsylvania
general lee knows that a letter has been
prepared by the southern government
a letter which offers peace
it is to be placed on the desk
of abraham lincoln president of the u s
the day after lee has destroyed
the army of the potomac
somewhere north of washington
federal cavalry two brigades
howdy friend where you headed
general longstreet i must see him

wherever he is longstreet is nearby
take me that way this is urgent
let me put it to you like this stranger
youre not in a uniform

i knew youd want to know that
as soon as possible
hes right outside here sir
your servant general
didnt expect to see me did you
i paid you in gold three weeks ago
what do you got
i dont suppose you got
another one of those
that good southern tobacco
what do you got
i got the position of the yankee army
theyre only a few miles down the road
the whole yankee army coming this way
seven corps
a few miles
yes two brigades of yankee cavalry
down that road about
two four hours away
behind that theres seven corps
i put it all on a map if youd like to see it
about 80000 men
all seven corps
you didnt know any of that general
you didnt know they were on the move
you wouldnt be spread so thin
if youd known
how do you know were spread out
listen general im good at this business
sir i beg your pardon
but if this mans story is true
why havent we heard about it
general stuarts cavalry is out there
he would have reported
what do you know about jeb stuart
hes out there all right
hes riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers
he hasnt caused anything but a little fuss
if the federal army was moving that fast
as close as you say
i have to believe general stuart
now look here
i came within an angry mules kick
of the whole yankee cavalry
and all the way through a picket line
hazardous too
i dont know what jeb stuarts doing
i dont care i do my job
yankee cavalrys down the road
thick as fleas
not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot
and that by god is the lords truth
major sorrel
yes sir
will you go to general lees headquarters
and notify him about this
yes sir
captain goree
yes sir
get this man a tent
and a cigar
sir
he says the lead element is here
with the third corps
the sixth right behind
supported by a column of federal cavalry
seven corps all together
the first and eleventh
are above taneytown
and theres more cavalry two hours east
there may be as many
as 100000 altogether
do you believe the man this mr harrison
no choice you remember him sir
the actor from mississippi
an actor
we move on the word of an actor
cant afford not to
there would be some word
from general stuart
general stuart would not leave us blind
one other thing hookers been replaced
george meades the new commander
harrison read it in the yankee papers
george meade pennsylvania man
meade would be cautious i think
take him some time to get organized
perhaps we should move more swiftly
there may be an opportunity here
yes sir
no reason to delay
i think we should concentrate here
all the roads converge
just east of this gap
this junction will be very necessary
yes sir
i left my spectacles over there
what is the name of this town
gettysburg
very well
message for colonel chamberlain
colonel darling rise up me bucko
im sorry darling

mutineers colonel me lad
120 men from the old second maine
which has been disbanded
120 mutineers
yes sir
you see what happened was
the enlistment papers
on the old second maine run out
they were sent home
all except these 120 fellows
who foolishly signed threeyear papers
three years that is
so these poor fellows
got one more year to serve
only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the second maine
and the second maine only
so they
quit
they resigned you see 120 men
colonel are you all right
yeah
the point is
these maine fellows wont fight no more
nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them
until they thought of us
being as we are the only other
maine regiment in the fifth corps
so theyve been assigned to us
yes sir
i have a message here
from the new commanding general
george meade sir

our very own general
of our very own corps

joseph bucklin

ive been in 11 different engagements
how many have you been in
not that many
it aint the papers
ive done my share we all have
they are damn good men
shouldnt be used this way
look here
it went clean through
we got a courier coming
listen colonel im tired
you know what i mean im tired
ive had all this army all these officers
this damn hooker this damn idiot meade
all of them the whole bloody lousy mess
of sickbrained potbellied scareheads
they aint fit to lead a johnny detail
they aint fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel
im tired
were good men
and we had our own good flag
these damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse
we arent gonna win this war
we cant win with these
lamebrained bastards from west point
these damn gentlemen these officers
the courier sir
dont go away
colonel chamberlain sir
colonel vincent wishes to inform you
the fifth corps is moving out
you and the 20th maine regiment
are instructed to lead
20th maines assigned first position in line
send out advanced guards and flankers
flankers
yes flankers
right yes
my compliments to the colonel
captain clark you heard him
get the regiment up
sound the assembly strike the tents
you better get something to eat
looks like you could use it
tell your men im coming
the boys from the second maine
are being fed lawrence
dont call me lawrence
damn it lawrence im your brother
be careful about the name business
in front of the men
because were brothers
it looks like favoritism
general meade got his own son
as his aidedecamp
thats different generals can do anything
nothing quite so much like god on earth
as a general on battlefield
what are you going to do with them
colonel sir
you cant shoot them
you never go back to maine if you do
i know that
i wonder if they do
colonel sir you know who this man is
dan burns from orono
i know his daddy the preacher
best cusser i ever heard
knows more fine swear words
than any man in maine
you men gather around
ive been talking with private bucklin
hes told me about your problem
theres nothing i can do today
were moving out in a few minutes
well be moving all day
ive been ordered
to take you men with me
im told that
if you dont come i can shoot you
well you know i wont do that
maybe somebody else will but i wont
so thats that
heres the situation
the whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us
this is no time for an argument
i tell you we could surely use you fellows
were now well below half strength
whether you fight or not thats up to you
whether you come along is
well youre coming
you know who we are why were here
if you fight alongside us
theres a few things you must know
this regiment was formed
last summer in maine
there were 1000 of us then
there are less than 300 of us now
all of us volunteered to fight
for the union just as you did
some came mainly because
we were bored at home
thought this looked like it might be fun
some came because
we were ashamed not to
many of us came
because it was the right thing to do
and all of us have seen men die
this is a different kind of army
if you look back through history
youll see men fighting for pay
for women for some other kind of loot
they fight for land power
because a king leads them
or just because they like killing
we are here for something new
this has not happened much
in the history of the world
we are an army out to set other men free
america should be free ground
all of it
not divided by a line
between slave state and free
all the way from here to the pacific ocean
no man has to bow
no man born to royalty
here we judge you by what you do
not by who your father was
here you can be something
here is the place to build a home
but its not the land
theres always more land
its the idea that we all have value
you and me
what were fighting for in the end
were fighting for each other
sorry
i didnt mean to preach
you go ahead
you talk for a while
if you choose to join us and want
your muskets back you can have them
nothing more will be said
by anybody anywhere
if you choose not to join us
you can come along under guard
when this is over ill do what i can
to see you get a fair treatment
but for now were moving out
gentlemen
i think if we lose this fight
we lose the war
so if you choose to join us
ill be personally very grateful
colonel its a fine morning
captain spear are we ready
sir that we are
then lets move out
20th maine
forward
march
thats infantry all right
at least a whole brigade
any sign of cavalry
not a lick sir
thats strange
infantry moving alone
in enemy country blind
very strange sir
what do you make of that
hes headed this way
sir
lees turned thats the main body
you think so
i thought they were going to harrisburg
he was
thats too many troops
to be a raiding party
theres power behind it
sir if you want to fight here
this is such lovely ground
its the best damn ground ive seen all day
it is that
well move both brigades into town
thatll make the good citizens happy
lets go down and have a look
soldier your shirt needs mending
i thought the war was in virginia
what division are you boys with
colonel do you mind
a good officer doesnt ride all day
ive been sitting too long anyway
what do you think
what do you think
about what
about the second maine boys what else
are any of them going to join us
would you believe it all but six
what
i counted by actual vote
114 voted to pick up the rifle
well ill be
you did good brother real good
good see to it they march together
yes glaziers got the hardheads in tow
there are six
get the names
put them in different companies
i want them spread out
not bunched together
ill see about their muskets
colonel sir
you know whats happening here
in the morning
sir
the whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here
theyll move through this town
occupy the hills on the other side
when our people arrive leell have
high ground therell be the devil to pay
the high ground
meade will come in slowly cautiously
new to command
theyll be on his back from washington
wires hot with messages attack attack
so he will set up a ring around these hills
and when lees army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground
meade will finally attack
if he can coordinate the army
straight up the hillside out in the open
in that gorgeous field of fire
we will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly
and afterward men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest
and say what a brave charge it was
devin ive led a soldiers life
and ive never seen anything
as brutally clear as this
its as if i can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment
going up the long slope to the stony top
as if it were already done
and already a memory
an odd set
stony quality to it
as if tomorrow has already happened
and theres nothing you can do about it
the way you sometimes feel
before an illconsidered attack
knowing it will fail
but you cannot stop it
you must even take part and help it fail
we have 2500 men
theyll be coming in force
there could be 20000
coming down that road in the morning
if we hold this ridge for a couple of hours
we can keep them away
we can block that road
until our main body gets here
we can deprive the enemy
of the high ground
the boys are ready for a brawl
no doubt of that
well force the reb to deploy
thats a narrow road
theyll be coming down
if we stack them up it will take them a
while to get on track to get into position
is calefs battery up yet
his six guns are deploying now
how far back is reynolds
with the main force
about 10 miles sir not much more
sir you were right
my scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way for sure
theyre all concentrating in this direction
well hold here in the morning
long enough for reynolds
and the infantry to arrive
if we hang on to the high ground
we have a chance
to win this fight thats coming
understood
yes sir
post the cannon along this road
the chambersburg pike
the rebels will hit us at dawn
i think we can hold them at least 2 hours
hell general
we can hold them all the livelong day
hes right sir
at thoroughfare gap
you held against longstreet
you held for six hours
they never came we held for nothing
the rebs will hit us just about first light
keep a clear eye
have the pickets give us a good warning
all right gentlemen
lets get posted
general reynolds
my troops are deployed on good ground
west of gettysburg
on the chambersburg pike
ive sent reconnaissance parties
in every direction
from which the enemy
might be approaching
im satisfied ap hills corps
is massed just west of here
back of cashtown
the enemys pickets
are within four miles of my position
rumor says ewells coming
over the mountains from carlisle
if true two confederate corps
will converge upon us in the morning
one from the west and one from the north
do you want me to hold
this position if attacked
confirmation requested
jno buford
bow down thy heaven o lord
come down and touch the mountains
and they shall smoke
blessed be the lord my strength
which teaches my fingers to fight
and my hands to war amen
good morning lucy
traveler good morning to you sir
good morning sir
good morning major taylor
will the general have some breakfast
no thank you
we have flapjacks in small mountains
fresh butter bacon wagons of ham
apple butter ripe cherries
you really ought to pitch in sir
courtesy of our host
the great commonwealth of pennsylvania
good morning sir
general longstreet good morning
federal forces are concentrating
yes and ive confirmed
some of your man harrisons information
their new commander
is definitely george meade
i have reports of union cavalry
in gettysburg
cavalry
general hill reports only militia
he did
well its cavalry
where theres cavalry
infantry will be close behind
meades closing fast
it could be hes thinking
of swinging round behind us
behind in front direction does not matter
well fight him wherever he is
probably got old abe lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of pennsylvania
we may have an opportunity here
i agree
our objective was to get their army
out of virginia and into the open
now they are in the open
general meade has been forcing
the march
the weather has been unusually hot
he will probably arrive here worn out
and weary piece by piece
if we concentrate
we can hit him as he comes up
if we can take out a few of his corps
we can even the odds
but we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly
what artillery is that major
i dont know sir
general heth is in front
my instructions were clear
yes sir to all commanders
avoid contact with the enemy
until the armys up and concentrated
and general heth
he has instructions
not to force major action
i told him this morning
we should move closer to the front
send for general heth
i must know what is going on
yes sir
general
in the fight that is coming
i want you to stay back from the main line
this army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders
and you sir have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward
cant lead from behind
may i say it plainly sir
i cannot afford to lose you
now general lets look to this day
you may bring up your corps
major taylor have traveler saddled up
im going to look around for myself
yes sir
theyve got a brigade in position
and thats all
weve got the best damn ground around
and theyre hitting me with one brigade
lovely
go on down gentlemen
fall back
they are on the run
close crop general
how are your losses
not bad at all sir
we got them out in the open
really got a twist on them
they are arrogant people you know
they came right at us
we took some prisoners
theyre from heths division of hills corps
thats what ive got in front of me
a new division 8000 men more or less
all within sound of this
just back up that road between here
and cashtown a little ways up the road
itll take them a little while to get on line
yes sir but hills whole corps is behind
maybe 25000
longstreet behind that
ewell over there to the north
i know colonel
when john reynolds gets here
he wont have the full army with him
only part of it
the point is the rebs will be here
this afternoon
with everything theyve got
i just thought id mention it
what do you want me to do here sir
heth will be back in a bit
if hes got any brains at all
and hes not stupid
hell know by now hes got at least
a brigade in front of him
he wont wait
to get his whole division in line
that would take half the morning
he dont need his whole division
thats right
does devin report any activity on his front
over to the right
no sir not a lick
all right
ill have devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys
and have them move in alongside you
lengthening your line
when heth gets back
hell run into two brigades
that ought to hold him
until reynolds gets here
right sir
damn sure glad the rain is gone
dont want anything to slow up reynolds
take care of yourself colonel
dont worry about me sir
im the soul of caution
fire
move fall back
that flank hold it
keep up your fire
gambles down sir
colonel gamble but hes not hurt bad sir
im all right
it was close thats all
sir colonel devins compliments
no problem on the right
they came up close
but we put in the reserve
we didnt put it all in sir
wishes to know if you have further orders
tell devin all reserve forward now
keep up your fire
fire
fire
sir its general reynolds
thank god
what goes john
theres the devil to pay
can you hold
i reckon i can
heth probably has about 10000 men
coming down that road wouldnt you say
yes sir but therell be more behind him
we can put almost 20000 in the field
were in very good shape i think
for a while sir
im sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed
its lovely ground
i thought so sir
now lets go surprise harry heth
come on
general heth
sir i beg to report
yes
very strange sir
the situation is very confused
what happened
i moved in this morning as directed
i thought it was only a few militia
but it was dismounted cavalry sir
there werent all that many
and the boys wouldnt hold back
i thought we shouldnt be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry
but they made a good fight
they really put up a scrap sir
go on general
well sir they wouldnt leave
my boys got their dander up
we deployed the whole division
and went after them
we just about had them running
then all of a sudden
they got infantry support
we got pushed back
then we reformed and tried again
we couldnt just leave it to them sir
now theres more yankee infantry coming
i dont know how many
but i dont know
what else we couldve done
it started as a minor scrap
with a few militia
the next thing i know
im tangling with half the union army
things will get out of control mr heth
that is why we have orders
is it possible you misunderstood them
no sir
can you identify those people
the infantry is the first corps
the black hats
theres another corps coming
that we havent identified
i must have all possible information
on enemy strength
major taylor i want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe
and do be careful
yes sir
sir shall i attack
no sir
we are not ready for full engagement
general longstreet is not up
with his corps
sir the enemy is disorganized
if we throw all our forces in the field
we will have the advantage
is that our artillery
yes sir
i cant imagine what has happened
to general stuart
ive heard nothing do you understand
yes sir
i have no idea of what lies in front of me
it may be the entire federal army
sir compliments of colonel babbit
rebels are coming from the north
your instructions sir
thatll be ewells corps
theyre trying to flank us
we got to meet them
and force them to go on line
tell colonel devin to get up that way
as quick as he can
well get gambles boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly
general rodes has encountered
yankee cavalry sir
bufords brigades
general earlys right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour
general early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour
is that penders artillery
yes sir hes up now sir
four batteries in position
with two more in reserve
with general rodes attacking up there
and pender and i we have three divisions
we could sweep them
general sir
i saw only two federal corps
first and eleventh
and general i saw earlys lead columns
coming down north of rodes lines
hell be engaged any minute sir
sir we got 20000 infantry coming down
almost behind the union lines
its perfect sir
gods will
gentlemen it would appear
the fight is already underway
general heth you may attack sir
my orders to all commanders attack
fire
forward men final brigade forward
forward for gods sake forward
hes dead
one thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call
ever hear tell of dan butterfield
what general butterfield
what was with hooker
thats the same fellow
he used to be our brigade commander
yeah he was a pistol
no man like him for having a good time
i dont know about that
but i know he used to like
to write bugle calls
the problem with this army is
we got too many calls
we got a call for artillery infantry
get up and eat retreat
anyway old butterfield he wrote
a special call for this here brigade
say there is an order for this brigade
you and me
hell be blowing his bugle we will think
that orders for us when it wasnt
well follow that order anyway
then well be in a world of hurt
yeah that happened to me once
us that is
half the regiment charged
the other half retreated
you had your choice
this here brigade got a special call
you hear that call
you know the next one is for you
it goes like this
colonel sir
begging the colonels pardon
but would the colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse
ill tell you sir
its not easy handling these new recruits
when the officers act
like they aint got any sense sir
lawrence sir
weve gone over 20 miles today
weve gone over 100 miles
in five days sir
theres something going on
colonel vincent sir
mister chamberlain
far cry from bowdoin college
wouldnt you say
no farther than harvard yard
indeed with luck well both see
our alma maters again
in the meantime colonel you move
your boys along as best you can
two corps have engaged at gettysburg
so well keep going through dark
and on until we get there
yes sir
godspeed
fire
theyre running
general pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back
theyre on the run
very well lieutenant
general early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank going back to gettysburg
theyre all running
very well thank you corporal
find general hills chief of artillery
tell him i want fire placed on that hill
as much fire as possible
yes sir
very well
major taylor
yes sir
deliver this message in person
tell general ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion
we must only push those people
in order to gain the heights
tell him to take that hill if practical
the one beyond the town
do you understand
yes sir
very well
congratulations general
i want you to see this
its like second manassas all over again
couldnt have worked better
if wed planned it
if we can take that hill
i want it occupied by nightfall
sir the federal army has fallen back
through gettysburg
theyre reforming on the ridges
outside of town
very well
this is almost perfect
we got them where we want them
lets move south and east
get between them and lincoln
find some high ground
and theyll have to hit us
then we have them general
you mean disengage
ive always been under the impression
that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible
in order to keep the army intact
granted but the situation has changed
in what way
weve already pushed them back
theyre on the run vacating the town
how can we move off
in the face of the enemy
major marshall
yes sir
i ordered firing on that hill
but no cannons are firing
send over and find out why
ill see to it sir
thank you
what are you thinking general
maybe we should not have fought here
i know that but we have prevailed
the men have prevailed
yes theyve always done that
but in the morning
we may be outnumbered
and theyll be entrenched
on the high ground
you know as well as i weve never been
concerned with being outnumbered
that is true sir you are right
if we move south to washington
they have to pursue us
then we can fight on ground
of our choosing
but the enemy is here
we did not want the fight
but the fight is here
how can i ask this army to retreat
in the face of what theyve done this day
not retreat sir redeploy
our guns will move them off that hill
or ewell will push them off
but if meade is there tomorrow
i cant move this army away
i will attack him
if meade is up there tomorrow
it is because he wants us to attack him
we pushed back two corps
but there are five more coming
general i will bring up my boys
as soon as i can
very well
general
sir
your man harrison the actor
he was quite correct
had it not been for him this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail
the federal force mightve been here
waiting when we turned around
im deeply grateful to you sir
hello men
what outfit are you with
archers brigade heths division
where are you from
tennessee
how about you
maine
ive never been to tennessee
i reckon ive never been to maine neither
i dont mean no disrespect
to you fighting men
but sometimes i cant help but figure
why are you fighting this war
why are you fighting it
to free the slaves of course
and to preserve the union
i dont know about other folk
but i aint fighting for no darkies
im fighting for my rights
thats what were all fighting for
for your what
for our rights
why is it you folks cant just live
the way you want to live
and let us live the way we do
live and let live i hear some folks say
be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart
whered you get captured
railroad cut just west of gettysburg town
it wasnt a pretty sight
many a good boy lost
a young and promising life
some wore blue some wore gray
seen enough of this war
i guess i have
i guess i have too
it looks like ill be sitting out the rest of it
i appreciate you talking to me
see you in hell billy yank
see you in hell johnny reb
i have found a john henry sir
john who
a john henry sir a runaway
i heard him agroaning
is he wounded
dont know for sure
the mans exhausted
well get him something to eat
the surgeons on the way
did you get his name
he said something i couldnt understand
i cant understand anyone
south of masondixon
rebs or darkies
all right men as you were
surgeon see to him
we used to have visitors from the south
before the war
they were always very polite academic
you understand
we stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy
but toward the end there was
no getting away from it
and yet i could never understand
i dont now
i dont know why
they fight so well
tell me something buster
what do you think of negroes
well if you mean the race
i dont really know
this is not a thing to be ashamed of
the thing is you cannot judge a race
any man who judges by the group
is a peawit
you take men one at a time
to me there was never any difference
none at all
none at all
of course i havent known
that many freed men
but those i knew in bangor portland
you look in the eye there was a man
there was a divine spark
as my mother used to call it
that is all there is to it
races are men
what a piece of work is man
how infinite in faculties
in form and moving
how express and admirable
in action how like an angel
well if hes an angel all right then
but he damn well must be a killer angel
colonel darling youre a lovely man
i see a great vast difference between us
yet i admire you lad
youre an idealist praise be
the truth is colonel
there is no divine spark
theres many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog believe me
when youve seen them hang each other
the way i have back in the old country
equality
what im fighting for is the right to prove
im a better man than many of them
where have you seen this divine spark
in operation colonel
where have you noted
this magnificent equality
no two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance
not a leaf not a tree
theres many a man worse than me
and some better
but i dont think race or country
matters a damn
what matters colonel
is justice
which is why im here
ill be treated as i deserve
not as my father deserved
im kilrain
and i damn all gentlemen
there is only one aristocracy
and that is right here
and thats why weve got to win this war
howdy
howdy general
hello my boys virginia has arrived
general pickett presents
his compliments
and asks to parler with
the commanding general sil vous plaît
hey george
general
good lord what is that smell
thats me aint it lovely
he got it off a dead frenchman
good evening to you james
hey lo
i did not get it off a dead frenchman
i bought it in a store
in richmond with sally
it did have a french name
but miss corbert likes it
excuse me
gentlemen colonel fremantle
allow me to introduce
major general george pickett
general pickett
lieutenant colonel arthur fremantle
of her majestys venerable
and elite cold stream guards
britains military attaché
to the confederacy
and you might say
the eyes and ears of queen victoria
hardly sir im merely an observer
and your humble guest
the fame of your regiment
has preceded you
general pickett here
is our ranking strategist
the first corps army of northern virginia
we refer all our deeper questions to him
they do they do indeed
his record at west point
is still the talk of both armies
you know i consider it unbecoming
to a soldier all this book learning
book learning aint for gentlemen right
nor that either
he graduated last in his class dead last
quite a feat considering his classmates
the yankees got all the smart ones
look where its got them
let me present my commanders
each one of these chaps as you might say
commands a brigade of mine
now this fellow here this is lo armistead
lo thats short for lothario
the lover
this here is richard brooke garnett
youll pardon his limp
he got kicked by his horse the other day
that fellow there
thats jim kemper
you note the shifty eye
the hand in the pocket
hes not even a west pointer
so watch him
hes a politician from virginia
jimmys only here for the votes
i was speaker of the house in virginia
as a matter of fact id like to talk to you
about some political matters
you know the queen dont you
what i need to know
and tell my folks back home is
when are you going to do something
about that damn yankee blockade
out there on the water
can you tell me something about that
have you heard any news of old winfield
old winnie boy
hancock oh yeah
well hows he doing
youre going to find out
hes got the second corps
hes headed this way probably run
into him in the next few days
i wish i could see him again
i havent seen him since before the war
never thought it would last this long
me neither lo
i sure would like to talk
to old hancock again
one more time
well why not
you wouldnt mind
hell no
i mean really
do you think it would be proper
you know ethical
when the time comes and hes close
just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over
aint nothing to it
last time i saw him was in california
right when the war was beginning
the night before we all left
to go fight against each other
old friends off to war
hows your brigade
ive never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl
ive got to give the old man credit
a lot of credit for that
who else couldve held
this army together for so long
remember what they used to say
about him
when he first took command
they called him old granny
lord what damn fools we were
now when he passes
the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the lord
have you ever seen anything like that
no i cant say i have
its amazing what one honest man can do
one honest man and a cause
i dont think on that too much anymore
i guess my only cause is victory
this war comes as a nightmare
you pick your nightmare side
then you put your head down and win
old gloomy pete
you see colonel
the government derives its power
from the consent of the people
every government everywhere
let me make this very plain to you sir
we do not consent
and we will never consent
and what youve got to do is
youve got to go back over there
to your parliament and youve got
to make it very plain to them
youve got to tell them
that what were fighting for here
is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power
i mean thats all we want
thats what this war is all about
now we established this country
in the first place
with very strong state governments
just for that very reason
i mean let me put it to you this way
my home is in virginia
the government of my home is home
virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled
by some king over there in london
its not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in washington
virginia by god sir
is going to be run by virginians
oh my the cause
actually jimmy i got a pair of kings
and its all for the yankees
the damn moneygrubbing yankees
i mean those damn fools
they dont get the message
always the darkies
nothing but the darkies
you know jim
sit down i think that my idea
my analogy of a gentlemens club
is fair enough its clear enough
colonel think on it now
suppose that we all joined a club
a gentlemens club
after a time several of the members
began to intrude themselves
into our private lives our home lives
began telling us
what we could and couldnt do
well then wouldnt any one of us
have the right to resign
i mean just resign
thats what we did
thats what i did and now these people
are telling us we dont have that right
i got to hand it to you
you certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous
and complicating the obvious
have you ever considered
running for congress
no its a thought
what does colonel fremantle think
will the british come in on our side
hell yeah theyll come in
when we dont need them no more
like some damn bank lending you money
when youre no longer in debt
look here mr speaker
george
a word
goodnight colonel
see you later
in the next few days i believe
were going to have a hell of a fight here
i want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready
you can start bringing them up
by the first light
i want you all in gettysburg
by tomorrow night
yes sir
good evening john
im surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion
theres an old indian saying
follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there
general hancock
how are you john
im all right
but the brigades are pretty shot up
i need to get refitted
right ill see to it
we know what you did this morning
that was one hell of a piece of soldiering
thank you sir
heard you were with john reynolds
when he was killed
im sending the body up
to his folks in lancaster
they might appreciate a note from you
ill send it
he was a soldier
and a good friend
three of us reynolds
lo armistead and i came up together
mexican war
california
we stayed close
i wonder how old lo is doing
if hes still alive
heard he had one of picketts brigades
under longstreet
remarkable
just across the ridge
id like to see him again but not here
not like this
well maybe after the war
where do you want me in the morning
i want you to hold your position
on the extreme left
get some rest if you can
we may need you in the morning
jeb stuarts still on the prowl
out there someplace
yes sir
well general reynolds
we held the high ground
general trimble is waiting
will you see him now
very well
major i want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find general stuart
yes sir right away sir
thank you
general trimble
sir i most respectfully request
another assignment
do please go on general
the man is a disgrace
sir have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you
ask general gordon or general ewell
ask them
we couldve taken that hill
god in his wisdom knows
we shouldve taken it
there was no one there at all
and it commanded the town
general gordon saw it
i mean he was with us
me and ewell and gordon
all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty
i beg your pardon general
that bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head
we all saw it as god is my witness
we were all there
i said to him general ewell
we have got to take that hill
general jackson wouldnt have stopped
with them on the run
and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty
god help us
i dont know
i dont know why
do please continue general
yes sir
sir
i said to general ewell these words
i said to him
sir give me one division
and i will take that hill
he said nothing
he just stood there and stared at me
i said general ewell
give me one brigade
and i will take that hill
i was becoming disturbed sir
and general ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked
so i said
general give me one regiment
and i will take that hill
and he said nothing
he just stood there
i threw down my sword
down on the ground in front of him
we could have done it sir
a blind man should have seen it
now theyre working up there
you can hear the axes
of the federal troops
and so in the morning
many a good boy will die
taking that hill
sir
i must request another assignment
no sir that wont be necessary
you will be of great service
and i do thank you
general meade sir
hancock its so damn dark out there
i cant see a thing
gentlemen
i hope to god that this is
good ground
is this good ground general
is this a place to have an army
very good ground sir
i hope you are right
because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning
will there be anything else sir
no thank you major
very well
in the morning is the great battle
tomorrow or the next day
will determine the war
virginia is here
all the south is here
what will you do tomorrow
in the morning
the enemy will be up
in fortified positions on high ground
longstreets corps will be coming up
and my boys will be ready
to finish the job
if i tell them to withdraw now no sir
theyve been patient for far too long
with the enemy out there up on the hill
theyll be ready to finish the job
but i dont even know
how much is up there
how many men how many cannon
i dont know the ground on the flanks
i dont know
if i wait in the morning
the early morning
maybe meade under pressure will attack
that would make general longstreet
very happy
but i dont think meade will come down
and i dont think i can withdraw so
gods will thy will be done
major sorrel youve met before
thank you general
the federal position was scouted
during the last several hours
weve drawn it up here
now this is the situation
the position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook
it starts here you see these two hills
this one and the one with the cemetery
that is where they have concentrated
their troops
the hook starts there
now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south
ending before two round hills
of high elevation
the federals have no troops
on those two hills
carry on major
thank you
we now know that general hancock
is in charge of the union center
there are now perhaps 60000
to 70000 men already in position
perhaps as high as 90000
i spoke with general ewell
of your suggestion
that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army
and he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from gettysburg
and giving it back to the enemy
would be very bad for morale
it is unnecessary
it might even be dangerous
do you disagree
we must attack
i would prefer not to fight
upon this ground
but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself
we cannot support ourselves for long
in this country
we must not allow the federal army
to move around behind
and cut us off from home no sir
we must strike him now
we pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it
the men are ready and they are eager
i see no useful alternative
yes sir
very well
gentlemen
good morning all
good morning sir
longstreet will attack on the right
with the first corps
hill will support
with heth in reserve
ewells people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy
from reinforcing against our right flank
yes sir but i still dont have pickett
hes at the rear of column
a full days march
all ive got is hood and mclaws
i do believe that hoods
and mclaws divisions will be sufficient
with the generals permission
general hood
moving in front of those rocky heights
well have enfilade fire
coming down on us
perhaps but not for long your division
will be up over this unoccupied hill
the little rocky one
from there you will threaten
the enemy flank
when youre heavily engaged
general ewell will strike from the left
very well sir
general
lets move out gentlemen
general barksdale
is mississippi ready for this day
mississippi is ready
very well
lets go to it sam
if hes right general lee
then the war is over by sundown
well see
i dont like going in without pickett
its like going in with one boot off
ill wait as long as i can
do you have any idea of the force
we counted five corps including
the two involved in yesterdays action
that dont mean how many might be
hidden behind those hills there
and damn it with stuart gone
there aint no way of knowing for sure
take good care of yourself today
you hear
you too pete
with your permission sir
i dont believe ive had the pleasure
thats major general john bell hood
but we call him sam
one of my three division commanders
fellows from texas and alabama
youve been to texas as i recall
yes actually thats where i came through
courtesy of the yankee navy
who denied me any other point of entry
its a marvelous place texas
full of red indians and mexicans
cowboys bandits and desperados
even hotter and more humid
than this place
if thats possible
that fellow hood
does his performance in battle
match his appearance
he really does look the part
he does his job
most interesting army i must say
virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside texas frontiersmen
and bayou bushwhackers from louisiana
drawn together from across a continent
having traveled a good piece of it myself
i feel a part
or almost a member of this enterprise
you call yourselves americans
but youre really transplanted englishmen
look at your names lee hood
longstreet jackson stuart
my people were dutch
and the same for your adversaries
meade hooker hancock and
shall i say lincoln
the same god same language
same culture and history
the same songs stories legends myths
but different dreams
different dreams
its so very sad very sad
you english had your own civil war once
didnt you
that was ages ago
we wouldnt dream of it now
cavaliers and roundheads
off with his head
heads lying everywhere
one could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown
were much more civilized now
i assure you
we have so much in common
your country and mine
i earnestly hope
that we shall become allies
your government would never ally itself
with a confederacy
that had the institution of slavery
you know that so do i
we should have freed the slaves
then fired on fort sumter
i guess we southerners and you english
have at least one thing in common
wed rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake
we whupped you british twice
as i recollect
your candor is admirable
if somewhat eccentric
a little eccentricity is good for a general
we southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad
i suspect thats why the women
fall in love with preachers
in nomine pater et filii et spiritus sancti
amen
general longstreet
do you mind if i accompany you
not at all im very glad
to have you with us sir
the heat reminds me of mexico
yes but there it was very dry
that was a good outfit
i remember storming the ramparts
of chapultapec with old george pickett
reynolds my old friend
ulysses sam grant
there was some good men in that army
yes indeed
some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges
i dont know i sometimes feel troubled
those fellows those boys in blue
they never quite seem the enemy
i know
i used to command some of those boys
swore an oath too
i couldnt fight against georgia
and south carolina
not against my own family
no sir there was always a higher duty
to virginia
that was our first duty
there was never any question about that
i guess so
let us not think about that now
the issue is in gods hands
we can only do our duty
general
soldiering has one great trap
to be a good soldier
you must love the army
to be a good commander
you must be willing to order the death
of the thing you love
we do not fear our own death you and i
but there comes a time
we are never quite prepared
for so many to die
we do expect the occasional empty chair
a salute to fallen comrades
but this war goes on and on
and the men die
and the price gets ever higher
we are prepared to lose some of us
but we are never prepared to lose all of us
and there is the great trap general
when you attack
you must hold nothing back
you must commit yourself totally
we are adrift here in a sea of blood
and i want it to end
i want this to be the final battle
i woke up this morning and i half thought
hed be gone george meade
that he would not want to fight here
yes sir
i woke up and i thought
meade will be gone
and this war will go on and on and on
well make him sorry he stayed
god go with you general
and with you general
thats mostly to the south
i thought the rebs were all in gettysburg
you dont suppose theyre flanking again
mamas favorite lets go
lawrence whats happening
sir corporal estabrook reporting back sir
brook i thought you were on sick call
yes sir
how are you now
its my stomach
ive been throwing up sir
its something you ate
finish up were about to move out
yes sir
colonel chamberlain
colonel vincent
form your men
follow me and prepare to doublequick
were going to the top of that hill
right there
you hear that
yes sir ill set it up
the rebels are stacking up
on our left flank
and weve got to follow them
make haste
yes sir
sound the assembly
follow me
powder in load
general
look here
the ground is strewn with boulders
the soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground
and there are guns in the rocks
every move i make is observed
if i attack as ordered
i lose half my division
and theyll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there
we must move around to the right sir
and take them from the rear
the commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills
i argued it yesterday
i argued it all morning
ive been arguing against any attack at all
i cant call this one off you know it
let me move up the big round hill
to the south
nobody is on that
if i could get a battery up there
there aint enough time
youd have to cut down trees
to place your artillery
it would be dark before you were in action
one the other hand
if they get batteries up there
well need buckets to catch the lead
youve got to take that hill
they dont even need guns to defend that
all they need to do
is roll rocks down on you
just take it
general
i do this under protest
sam you are the best i got
now sir if you are ready
why dont you take that hill
theyre overshooting again
hey fellows you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots
tom
yes sir
another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for mother
go back to the rear
watch out for stragglers
keep your distance from me
lawrence i dont
the whole damn reb army is down there
and coming up around our flanks
they could be here any minute
weve got to hold this place
weve got to hold it
well all right i place you here
put your colors here and set
your regiment to the left of this line
the rest of the brigade
will form on your right understood
yes ellis this is the point
sir
your regiment is to the left of this point
colonel sir youre the end of the line
yes
youre the extreme left of the union army
understood
the line runs from here
back to cemetery hill
but it ends here
understood
you cant withdraw under any condition
if you go this line will be flanked
if you go the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside
and take this entire army from the rear
you must defend this place to the last
yes sir
now well see how professors fight
ellis position the regiment
all company commanders here
yes sir
sharpshooters to the left
battalion on the right
now file into line march
bugler sound the officers call
hold to the last to the last what
exercise in rhetoric
last shell last man
last foot of ground last reb
advance
move out
turn those guns around
the 83rd pennsylvania 44th new york
and 16th michigan
will be moving in to our right
but if you look left you will see
that there is no one there
because were the end of the line
the union army stops here
we are the flank
do you understand gentlemen
we cannot retreat we cannot withdraw
we are going to have
to be stubborn today
put the boys in position
tell them to stay down
pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can
i want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards
sloping ground is good ground
if you have any breakthroughs
men wounded a hole in the line
plug it with the reserve
hows our ammunition
sir i think about 60 rounds per man
thats good 60 rounds i think
yes thats adequate
any questions
colonel
it seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill
it seems to me that were the back door
and everythings going on
at the front door
that hill is steep and rocky its bare
to come straight up it is impossible
the reb army is going to swing around it
itll come up through that notch
right over there
itll move under the cover of trees
trying to get around the flank
and gentlemen
we are the flank
gentlemen
god go with you
captain clark
take the right side from the 83rd
over in this direction to the center
ellis take the left but be watchful
your flank will be in the air
colonel sir
corporal estabrook
what do i do with these prisoners
the hardheads of the second maine
do any of you care to join us
the rebs really coming
theyre really coming
well its kind of dull
just sitting here watching sir
for any man who joins us
there will be no court martial
no man will call me a coward
why not
ill waste no man to guard you
i expect you to be here when this is over
lets get these fellows some muskets
there are no muskets sir
wait here for a bit
there will be guns available
in a little while
thats the new york boys
the rebs must be getting closer
must be moving this way
private foss is praying
will you put in a kind word for me
yes sir
youre the merrill brothers right
yes sir
boys why arent you on the ground
sir i cant shoot worth a darn lying down
never could bill neither
we like to fight standing
i suggest you find a thicker tree
here they come
i want you to stay with me
but you keep down
buster
i bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way
walk down the line
tell the boys to get good cover
pile the rocks high and fire carefully
go down and come back
right
you got to keep an eye on them
some of them load but never fire
they just keep right on loading
some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel
never fired a shot
sir
fire
keep up your fire boys
keep your head down
watch your left side
keep up your fire
theyre falling back
theyll be back in a minute
how are we doing
were doing fine
colonel
captain clark anybody hurt
head and shoulder wounds
they didnt hit the left
theyre moving out that way
can you see them sir
theyre coming again boys
colonel look here
a new regiment has arrived
thats moving against the left
its out there do you see them
doublequick
i dont think well be able
to hold another one
get all company commanders up here
on the double
sergeant owen
yes sir
get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there
yes sir
were about to be flanked
heres what well do
i want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire
keep a tight hold on the 83rd
on old pennsylvania over there
i want no break in the line
captain clark thats you
you understand no breaks
right wing will sidestep to the left
thinning out to twice the present distance
you see the colors
they will end up down to the extreme left
when you reach that point
we are going to refuse the line
understand
well form a new line at right angles
well pull up as much of a reserve
as possible
weve got to be able to counterattack
whenever theres a hole
any questions
no sir
fine move
lieutenant you fellows on the double
come on
how are you andrew
im fine sir and you
a bit worn
the boys are putting up a hell of a fight
they are indeed
i got me one i got me a reb
buster are you all right
ill be fine in a minute
but plays hell with me target practice
the surgeon will see to it
no a little bandage is all ill be needing
a few minutes off my feet
me brogans are killing me
colonel my men are getting low
on ammunition
go over to the 83rd
ask them to send what they can
lieutenant go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can
pick up what you can from anywhere
here they come sir
keep up the fire
fill your holes down here
there they go
ill be damned
they keep coming
how long are they going to keep coming
i dont have much left i got two shots
thats what i got
they keep coming on the flanks
they keep moving to the left more
they cant send help from the 83rd
they say they got their own troubles
colonel sir wed like to report
what
vincent is badly wounded
he got hit a few minutes
after the fight started
weve been reinforced at the top of the hill
by weeds brigade up front
this is what they tell me
but weed is dead
so they moved hazletts
battery of artillery up there
but hazletts dead far as i can tell
can you can get ammunition
from up there
i dont know its a mess
but theyre holding good
the rebs are having a hard time climbing
its a steep hill

my boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them
we ought to pull out
no we cant do that
we cant hold them again sir
if we dont they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in

this fellow from alabama
captain hawkins this is my brother
colonel chamberlain
sir
may i have some water
yes
sure tom get this man a canteen
yes sir right this way
how you doing
twice
would you believe for the love of mary
twice
and how are you colonel darling
this fine day
i got it in the armpit
for the love of god in the bloody armpit
how is he
its an arm
only an arm you got to lose something
it might as well be an arm
i can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature and thats the truth
i could do with a nip right now
ill see what i can do
you do pretty good
colonel
im right here buster im right here
the army was blessed
i want to tell you just in case
that i never served
ive never served with a better man
dont worry sir
hell make it hes a tough old mick
colonel sir it would so honor me
colonel sir ive been moving these rebs
with an empty musket
thats allowed
youre ordered to go to the top
of the big hill
my new yorkers will take your prisoners
yes sir
we watched from our position above
its the damnedest thing i ever saw
may i shake your hand sir
colonel one thing
the name of this place this hill
has it got a name this hill
this is little round top
thats the name of the hill you defended
the big one youre going up to
thats big round top
is that so i guess ill remember that
ellis move the men out
im going to go ahead
sam
we drugged him sir
itd be better if he slept
didnt see much
the boys went in hit the rocks
how did it go pete
fine sam
we take those rocks
most of them
worst
ground i ever saw
you know that
they call it
devils den its a good name for it
what casualties
dont know yet
got to give my boys credit
you shouldve let me go to the right
we shouldve gone to the right
he needs to rest some
you summoned me sir
harrison
i did
ive got some night work
are you up to it
all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun
when this is all over
i do look forward to seeing you on stage
what are the generals wishes
i want you to go out on the right
scout the federal position
their condition what theyve got
in reserve what theyre bringing up
itll probably take all night
but i want it right and clear
your obedient servant general
good
now harrison itll be dangerous
and i do appreciate this
thank you sir
but i must confess
the thing that bothers me about this job
is the absence of an audience
when you do it right no one knows it
nobody ever watches your work
do you see
thats very hard on an actor
go on
general im very glad to see you well
ive just come by for my orders sir
it would appear
that general stuart has returned
the prodigal son
it was very close this afternoon
sir
they nearly broke
i could feel them breaking
there for a moment i thought i saw
our flags go up the hill
it wasnt that close
the attacks were not properly
coordinated i do not know why
and nevertheless we nearly won the day
i could see a clear road
all the way to washington
how is it with general hood
i think hell live may lose an arm
dear god
i couldnt spare general hood
so many good men were lost this day
sir
lo did take the peach orchard
and wheat field
but he couldnt get up that ridge
and hood he seized the devils den
but he couldnt take the little rocky hill
the federals still hold the heights
and theyre reinforced
general
that way around to the right is still open
i will think on it general
we have enough artillery
for one more good fight but just one
i know
let me think on it
general
i am very glad to see you well
we will speak again in the morning
you know hearing you talk
about monkeys and trees
i remember the time
during a cannonade on the peninsula
there was one tree
for the men to hide behind
it was a skinny little tree
and the boys they fell in behind it
in a long thin line
which ruled just like a pigtail
it swayed to one side then the other
a shell came this way
the line swayed that way
a cannonball came that way
the line swayed this way
it was a thing to see
george what has that got to do
with what were talking about
general
carry on gentlemen
dont let me interrupt the revival
general youre just in time
ive been trying to persuade george here
of the modern scientific
theories of charles darwin
the theory of evolution
the notion that all mankind
is descended from the ape
he does not subscribe
is that so
i do not
ive ordered general armistead to stop
filling his head with heathen blasphemies
now you are to devote
your reflective moments to study
in the matters of military significance
ordered me
or perhaps appropriating
some more of this fine whiskey here
absolutely
would you care for
no thank you
surely the commanding general
shares my deep feelings of disgust
at this simian suggestion
i suppose theres some pretty smart folk
that take darwin for the gospel
they would not be invited to join
georges evershrinking circle of friends
general longstreet sir
i intend to lay this matter to rest
for once and for all time
good
perhaps there are those among you who
think that you are descended from an ape
i suppose its possible
there are those of you
who believe that im descended
from an ape but
i challenge the man to step forward
who believes that general lee
is descended from an ape
here here
not likely
all science trembles before
the searing logic of your fiery intellect
so exactly how many of your relatives
are there that are apes
what do you hear about sam hood
he may lose an arm
dick garnett isnt fit cant hardly walk
thing is if theres a fight
he cant stand to stay out of it
but if you ordered him to stay out
i dont suppose you could do that
that boy can sing
thats kathleen mavourneen
what do you hear about hancock
ran into him today
hes out there about a mile or so
just a mile or so and he was tough
very tough today
hes the best they got
god dont make them any better
and thats a fact
id like to go over to see him
as soon as i can
the last time i saw winn
he played that song that very song
back in california
we were all together for the last time
before we broke up
spring of 1861
myra hancock
do you remember myra hancocks wife
beautiful woman
most perfect woman i ever saw
they were a beautiful couple
beautiful
garnett was with me that night
a lot of fellows from the old outfit
people standing around singing
in the blue uniform
we were leaving the next day
some going north some going south
splitting up
a soldiers farewell
goodbye good luck
ill see you in hell
do you remember that
towards the end of the evening
we all sat around the piano
and myra played
that song there
that was the one she played
maybe for years maybe forever
ill never forget that
you know how it was pete
winn was like a brother to me
remember
towards the end of the evening
things got a little rough
we all began to
there were a lot of tears
i went over to hancock
i took him by the shoulder i said
so help me
if i ever raise my hand against you
may god strike me dead
i havent seen him since
he was at malvern hill
white oak swamp
sharpsburg fredericksburg
one of these days
i will see him im afraid
across that
small deadly space
i thought about sitting this one out
but i cant do that
that wouldnt be right either
i guess not
thank you peter
i had to talk about that
im sending myra hancock
a small package to be opened
in the event of my death
youll drop by and see her
after this is over
wont you pete
thank you
what day is it now major
its long after midnight sir
its already friday
friday july 3
yes sir
then tomorrow is the fourth of july
independence day
id quite forgotten
the good lord has a sense of humor
im very sorry to keep you up so late
it is my pleasure
we should have a larger staff
id be offended sir
i can do the work
very well
general stuart is waiting to see you sir
shall i bring him in
of course
major
yes sir
general stuart and i
must not be disturbed
very well sir
thank you
general lee will see you now sir
you wish to see me sir
it is the opinion of some excellent officers
that you have let us all down
sir if you will please tell me
who these gentlemen are
there will be none of that
there is no time
i ask that i be allowed to defend my
there is no time
general stuart
your mission was to free this army
from the enemy cavalry
and to report any movement
by the enemys main body
that mission was not fulfilled
you left here
with no word of your movement
or movement of the enemy for days
meanwhile we were engaged
and drawn into battle
without adequate knowledge
of the enemys strength or position
without knowledge of the ground
so it is only by gods grace
that we did not meet disaster here
general lee there were reasons
perhaps you misunderstood my orders
perhaps i did not make myself clear
well sir this must be made very clear
you sir
with your cavalry
are the eyes of this army
without your cavalry we are made blind
that has already happened once
it must never never happen again
since i no longer hold the generals
i told you there is no time for that
there is no time
there is another fight coming tomorrow
and we need you
we need every man god knows
you must take what i have told you
and learn from it as a man does
there has been a mistake
it will not happen again
i know your quality
you are one of the finest
cavalry officers i have ever known
and your service to this army
has been invaluable
let us speak no more of this
the matter is concluded
goodnight general
colonel sir
what are you doing up here
im just resting my leg
all right
you sure can see a ways from here
where have you been
we sent out a detail
and found some more departed souls
down there
and they were carrying coffee
for which they had no more use for
youre a ghoul
you did real good yesterday
the way them rebs just kept coming
you had to admire them
you think theyll come again today
it dont look like theyre planning to leave
we dont have but 100 men
even with the whole flock
from the second maine
this positions good
diversion
go alert the pickets
that may be a diversion
they may be coming this way again
wheres the ammunition i asked for
go check the hospital see about the boys
check on buster
very well sir
we need another runner
i keep going up and down this hill
my legs are going to fall off
good morning general
good morning sir
ride with me if you will
yes sir
general longstreet you have
general pickett now and he is fresh
i want you to bring your corps forward
take those heights in the center
and split the federal line
my two divisions hoods and mclaws
they executed a forced march yesterday
and went straight into the fight
lost half of their strength
sustained 50 casualties sir
they are tired and need rest
there are
now three federal corps on those two
rocky hills on our right flank
if i move all my people forward
we wont have a flank at all
theyll simply swing around and crush us
they are well entrenched up there
they aim to fight
they got good artillery and plenty of it
sir any attack we make
will be uphill over open ground
how do we communicate
how do we coordinate attack
theyre all massed together
damned near in a circle
good interior lines
anywhere we hit them
theyll bring up reinforcements in minutes
but we try to bring up support
it has to come from miles away
their cannon will see every move
hell their cannon are looking down
on us right now
in the center they will break
they will break in the center
theyll be gaining men from all directions
guns by the thousands
and richmond has nothing left
to send us so if we stay we fight
if we retreat now
we will have fought here for two days
and will leave knowing
we could not drive him off
and i have never yet left the enemy
in command of the field no sir
retreat is no longer an option
the enemy has been attacked
on both wings
he has reinforced there
and is strongest there on the wings
the hills and the rocks
so the weak point is in the center
they have command of the high ground
but in that long slope you see there
the long slope in the center
theres where hes most vulnerable
general picketts virginians
are the only people not yet engaged yes
with general longstreet in command
my old warhorse
meeting the enemy face to face
on ground of his choosing
and with honor we will prevail
sir a courier from colonel rice
colonel chamberlain
thats some climb sir
my men need rations lieutenant
colonel rice has entrusted me to tell you
that youre relieved sir
relieved
fresh troops are on their way up
and theyll take over here sir
colonel rice wants to give
your people a rest
he wants you to fall back
and im to show you the way
fall back
ellis have the men fall in
were moving out
yes sir
where are we going
lovely spot
very quiet safest place on the battlefield
right smackdab in the center
yes sir general
we will attack the center
but i think you are right about the flank
hood and mclaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday
ill give you two other divisions
general pettigrew and general trimble
they are stronger and rested
now you will have nearly three divisions
at your command including pickett
your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder
the attack will be preceded
by massed artillery
well concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area
a feu denfer as napoleon would call it
when the artillery has had its effect
your charge will break the line
you will have nearly 15000 men
at your command general
you may begin whenever youre ready
but plan it well
do plan it well i pray you sir
we stake everything on this
with your permission
sir ive been a soldier all my life
i have served from the ranks on up
you know my service
i must tell you now
i believe this attack will fail
no 15000 men ever made
can take that ridge
its a distance of more than a mile
over open ground
when the men come out of the trees
they will be
under fire of yankee artillery
from all over the field
those are hancocks boys
and now they have the stone wall
like we did at fredericksburg
we do our duty general
we do what we must do
yes sir
colonel alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good
we will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there
and the men will know what to do
all 15000
will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line that lower ridge there
the line is not strong there
general meade has great strength
on both flanks
he must be weak in the center
i estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5000 men
and colonel alexanders artillery
will break them up like at fredericksburg
yes sir
farewell
what are you thinking general
picketts division is from my corps
but the other two units
are of ap hills corps
shouldnt general hill lead the attack
say again
shouldnt general hill lead the attack
my apologies sir
