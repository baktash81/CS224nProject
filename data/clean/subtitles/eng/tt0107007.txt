virginia  robert e  lee commanding   
slips across the potomac
to begin the invasion of the north 
it is an army of 70 000 men 
they move slowly behind the blue ridge   
using the mountains
to screen their movements 
their objective is to draw
the union army out into the open   
where it can be destroyed 
late in june  the union army
of the potomac  80 000 men   
turns north from virginia to begin
the great pursuit up the narrow roads   
across maryland and into pennsylvania 
general lee knows that a letter has been
prepared by the southern government 
a letter which offers peace 
it is to be placed on the desk
of abraham lincoln  president of the u  s   
the day after lee has destroyed
the army of the potomac   
somewhere north of washington 
federal cavalry  two brigades 
  howdy  friend  where you headed 
  general longstreet  i must see him 
is that a fact 
i know general lee s headquarters
are up here a little ways 
wherever he is  longstreet is nearby 
  take me that way  this is urgent 
  let me put it to you like this  stranger 
you re not in a uniform
and you re coming through my picket line 
i ll take you up there 
but if nobody there knows you   
i guess  unfortunately 
you ll have to be hanged 
sir  general  sir 
i m sorry  excuse me  sir 
but harrison is back 
  harrison 
  yes  sir 
the scout  harrison  sir 
i knew you d want to know that
as soon as possible 
he s right outside here  sir 
your servant  general 
didn t expect to see me  did you 
i paid you in gold three weeks ago 
what do you got 
i don t suppose you got
another one of those 
that good southern tobacco 
what do you got 
i got the position of the yankee army 
they re only a few miles down the road 
the whole yankee army coming this way 
seven corps 
a few miles 
yes  two brigades of yankee cavalry
down that road about   
two  four hours away 
behind that there s seven corps 
i put it all on a map  if you d like to see it 
about 80 000 men 
all seven corps 
you didn t know any of that  general 
you didn t know they were on the move 
you wouldn t be spread so thin
if you d known 
how do you know we re spread out 
listen  general  i m good at this business 
sir  i beg your pardon 
but if this man s story is true   
why haven t we heard about it 
general stuart s cavalry is out there 
he would have reported 
  what do you know about jeb stuart 
  he s out there all right 
he s riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers 
he hasn t caused anything but a little fuss 
if the federal army was moving that fast 
as close as you say   
  i have to believe general stuart   
  now  look here 
i came within an angry mule s kick
of the whole yankee cavalry 
and all the way through a picket line 
hazardous  too 
i don t know what jeb stuart s doing 
i don t care  i do my job 
yankee cavalry s down the road 
thick as fleas   
not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot 
and that  by god  is the lord s truth 
  major sorrel 
  yes  sir 
will you go to general lee s headquarters
and notify him about this 
yes  sir 
  captain goree 
  yes  sir 
get this man a tent 
and a cigar 
sir 
he says the lead element is here
with the third corps   
the sixth right behind   
supported by a column of federal cavalry 
seven corps all together 
the first and eleventh
are above taneytown 
and there s more cavalry two hours east 
there may be as many
as 100 000 altogether 
do you believe the man  this mr  harrison 
no choice  you remember him  sir 
the actor from mississippi 
an actor 
we move on the word of an actor 
can t afford not to 
there would be some word
from general stuart 
general stuart would not leave us blind 
one other thing  hooker s been replaced 
george meade s the new commander 
harrison read it in the yankee papers 
george meade  pennsylvania man 
meade would be cautious  i think 
take him some time to get organized 
perhaps we should move more swiftly 
there may be an opportunity here 
yes  sir 
no reason to delay 
i think we should concentrate here 
all the roads converge
just east of this gap 
  this junction will be very necessary 
  yes  sir 
i left my spectacles over there 
what is the name of this town 
gettysburg 
very well 
message for colonel chamberlain 
colonel  darling  rise up  me bucko 
i m sorry  darling 
but we got a bit of a problem here 
would you like to hear about it 
would you wake up  sir 
we got a whole company coming  sir 
this way  i ll give you time to wake up 
but we ve got quite a problem 
altogether  120 men are coming 
we re to be having them as guests 
what 
should be here any minute 
  who 
  mutineers 
mutineers  colonel  me lad 
120 men from the old second maine
which has been disbanded 
120 mutineers 
yes  sir 
you see  what happened was
the enlistment papers   
on the old second maine run out 
they were sent home 
all except these 120 fellows   
who foolishly signed three year papers 
three years  that is 
so these poor fellows
got one more year to serve 
only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the second maine   
and the second maine only 
so they   
quit 
they resigned  you see  120 men 
  colonel  are you all right 
  yeah 
the point is 
these maine fellows won t fight no more 
nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them 
until they thought of us   
being as we are the only other
maine regiment in the fifth corps 
so they ve been assigned to us 
yes  sir 
i have a message here
from the new commanding general 
george meade  sir 
that s right 
our very own general
of our very own corps   
has been promoted
to command of the whole army 
the latest  if you keep track of them
as they go by 
the message says they ll be arriving
this morning and they are to join us 
 and if they refuse to follow orders 
please feel free to shoot them  
  to shoot them 
  yes  sir 
these maine men 
 you are hereby authorized to shoot
any man who refuses to do his duty  
are these all maine men 
yes  sir  and fine big fellows they are  too

colonel  it s going to be a hot day today 
seeing as you already been down
with the heat  will you ride the horse   
that the good lord provided 
instead of marching in the dirty dust 
you walked

since you was in books 
after the first few thousand miles 
a man gets limber with his feet 
morning  lawrence

guards  get these men back on their feet 
i m looking for commanding officer

colonel chamberlain to you 
captain brewer  sir

whatever force necessary 
you want to shoot them

they re trying to break us
by not feeding us 
we ain t broke yet 
they just told me you were coming

we ve got quite a ways to go today

forward  march 
what s your name 
i don t feel too kindly  colonel 
yes  well  i m usually not this informal 
i just took command
of this regiment a few days ago 
somebody ought to welcome you
to my    our outfit 
they tell me they re holding you fellows
because you signed three year papers 
i m sorry  would you like some coffee 
are you sure 
  go ahead  sit down  mister   
  bucklin 
joseph bucklin 
listen  colonel 
i ve been in 11 different engagements 
how many have you been in 
not that many 
it ain t the papers 
i ve done my share  we all have 
they are damn good men 
shouldn t be used this way 
look here 
it went clean through 
we got a courier coming 
listen  colonel  i m tired 
you know what i mean  i m tired 
i ve had all this army  all these officers   
this damn hooker  this damn idiot meade 
all of them  the whole bloody  lousy mess
of sick brained  potbellied scareheads 
they ain t fit to lead a johnny detail 
they ain t fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel 
i m tired 
we re good men
and we had our own good flag 
these damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse 
we aren t gonna win this war 
we can t win with these
lame brained bastards from west point 
these damn gentlemen  these officers 
the courier  sir 
don t go away 
colonel chamberlain  sir 
colonel vincent wishes to inform you
the fifth corps is moving out 
you and the 20th maine regiment
are instructed to lead 
20th maine s assigned first position in line 
send out advanced guards and flankers 
  flankers 
  yes  flankers 
right  yes 
my compliments to the colonel 
captain clark  you heard him 
get the regiment up 
sound the assembly  strike the tents 
you better get something to eat 
looks like you could use it 
tell your men i m coming 
the boys from the second maine
are being fed  lawrence 
don t call me lawrence 
damn it  lawrence  i m your brother 
be careful about the name business
in front of the men 
because we re brothers 
it looks like favoritism 
general meade got his own son
as his aide de camp 
that s different  generals can do anything 
nothing quite so much like god on earth
as a general on battlefield 
what are you going to do with them 
colonel  sir 
you can t shoot them 
you never go back to maine if you do 
i know that 
i wonder if they do 
colonel  sir  you know who this man is 
dan burns  from orono 
i know his daddy  the preacher 
best cusser i ever heard 
knows more fine swear words
than any man in maine 
you men gather around 
i ve been talking with private bucklin 
he s told me about your problem 
there s nothing i can do today 
we re moving out in a few minutes 
we ll be moving all day 
i ve been ordered
to take you men with me 
i m told that   
if you don t come  i can shoot you 
well  you know i won t do that 
maybe somebody else will  but i won t 
so  that s that 
here s the situation 
the whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us 
this is no time for an argument 
i tell you  we could surely use you fellows 
we re now well below half strength 
whether you fight or not  that s up to you 
whether you come along is   
well  you re coming 
you know who we are  why we re here 
if you fight alongside us 
there s a few things you must know 
this regiment was formed
last summer in maine 
there were 1 000 of us then 
there are less than 300 of us now 
all of us volunteered to fight
for the union  just as you did 
some came mainly because
we were bored at home 
thought this looked like it might be fun 
some came because
we were ashamed not to 
many of us came
because it was the right thing to do 
and all of us have seen men die 
this is a different kind of army 
if you look back through history 
you ll see men fighting for pay   
for women  for some other kind of loot 
they fight for land  power 
because a king leads them 
or just because they like killing 
we are here for something new 
this has not happened much
in the history of the world 
we are an army out to set other men free 
america should be free ground 
all of it 
not divided by a line
between slave state and free 
all the way from here to the pacific ocean 
no man has to bow 
no man born to royalty 
here we judge you by what you do 
not by who your father was 
here you can be something 
here is the place to build a home 
but it s not the land 
there s always more land 
it s the idea that we all have value 
you and me 
what we re fighting for  in the end   
we re fighting for each other 
sorry 
i didn t mean to preach 
you go ahead 
you talk for a while 
if you choose to join us and want
your muskets back  you can have them 
nothing more will be said
by anybody  anywhere 
if you choose not to join us 
you can come along under guard 
when this is over  i ll do what i can   
to see you get a fair treatment 
but for now  we re moving out 
gentlemen 
i think if we lose this fight   
we lose the war 
so  if you choose to join us 
i ll be personally very grateful 
colonel  it s a fine morning 
  captain spear  are we ready 
  sir  that we are 
then let s move out 
20th maine 
forward 
march 
that s infantry  all right 
at least a whole brigade 
any sign of cavalry 
not a lick  sir 
that s strange 
infantry moving alone
in enemy country  blind 
very strange  sir 
what do you make of that 
he s headed this way 
sir 
lee s turned  that s the main body 
you think so 
  i thought they were going to harrisburg 
  he was 
that s too many troops
to be a raiding party 
there s power behind it 
sir  if you want to fight here 
this is such lovely ground 
it s the best damn ground i ve seen all day 
it is that 
we ll move both brigades into town 
that ll make the good citizens happy 
let s go down and have a look 
  soldier  your shirt needs mending 
  i thought the war was in virginia 
what division are you boys with 
colonel  do you mind 
a good officer doesn t ride all day 
i ve been sitting too long anyway 
what do you think 
  what do you think 
  about what 
about the second maine boys  what else 
are any of them going to join us 
would you believe it  all but six 
what 
i counted by actual vote 
114 voted to pick up the rifle 
  well  i ll be 
  you did good  brother  real good 
good  see to it they march together 
yes  glazier s got the hardheads in tow 
there are six 
get the names 
put them in different companies 
i want them spread out 
not bunched together 
  i ll see about their muskets 
  colonel  sir 
you know what s happening here
in the morning 
sir 
the whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here 
they ll move through this town 
occupy the hills on the other side 
when our people arrive  lee ll have
high ground  there ll be the devil to pay 
the high ground 
meade will come in slowly  cautiously 
new to command 
they ll be on his back from washington 
wires hot with messages  attack  attack 
so he will set up a ring around these hills 
and when lee s army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground   
meade will finally attack 
if he can coordinate the army 
straight up the hillside  out in the open   
in that gorgeous field of fire 
we will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly 
and afterward  men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest   
and say what a brave charge it was 
devin  i ve led a soldier s life   
and i ve never seen anything
as brutally clear as this 
it s as if i can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment   
going up the long slope to the stony top   
as if it were already done   
and already a memory 
an odd  set   
stony quality to it 
as if tomorrow has already happened
and there s nothing you can do about it 
the way you sometimes feel
before an ill considered attack   
knowing it will fail   
but you cannot stop it 
you must even take part and help it fail 
we have 2 500 men 
they ll be coming in force 
there could be 20 000
coming down that road in the morning 
if we hold this ridge for a couple of hours 
we can keep them away 
we can block that road
until our main body gets here 
we can deprive the enemy
of the high ground 
the boys are ready for a brawl 
no doubt of that 
we ll force the reb to deploy 
that s a narrow road
they ll be coming down 
if we stack them up  it will take them a
while to get on track to get into position 
is calef s battery up yet 
his six guns are deploying now 
how far back is reynolds
with the main force 
about 10 miles  sir  not much more 
sir  you were right 
my scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way for sure 
they re all concentrating in this direction 
we ll hold here in the morning 
long enough for reynolds
and the infantry to arrive 
if we hang on to the high ground 
we have a chance   
to win this fight that s coming 
  understood 
  yes  sir 
post the cannon along this road 
the chambersburg pike 
the rebels will hit us at dawn 
i think we can hold them at least 2 hours 
hell  general 
we can hold them all the livelong day 
he s right  sir 
at thoroughfare gap 
you held against longstreet 
  you held for six hours 
  they never came  we held for nothing 
the rebs will hit us just about first light 
keep a clear eye 
have the pickets give us a good warning 
all right  gentlemen 
let s get posted 
general reynolds 
my troops are deployed on good ground   
west of gettysburg
on the chambersburg pike 
i ve sent reconnaissance parties
in every direction   
from which the enemy
might be approaching 
i m satisfied a p  hill s corps
is massed just west of here   
back of cashtown 
the enemy s pickets
are within four miles of my position 
rumor says ewell s coming
over the mountains from carlisle 
if true  two confederate corps
will converge upon us in the morning 
one from the west and one from the north 
do you want me to hold
this position if attacked 
confirmation requested 
j n o  buford 
 bow down thy heaven  o lord 
 come down and touch the mountains
and they shall smoke 
 blessed be the lord  my strength 
which teaches my fingers to fight   
 and my hands to war  amen  
good morning  lucy 
traveler  good morning to you  sir 
good morning  sir 
good morning  major taylor 
  will the general have some breakfast 
  no  thank you 
we have flapjacks in small mountains 
fresh butter  bacon  wagons of ham 
apple butter  ripe cherries 
you really ought to pitch in  sir 
courtesy of our host 
the great commonwealth of pennsylvania 
good morning  sir 
general longstreet  good morning 
federal forces are concentrating 
yes  and i ve confirmed
some of your man harrison s information 
their new commander
is definitely george meade 
i have reports of union cavalry
in gettysburg 
cavalry 
general hill reports only militia 
he did 
well  it s cavalry 
where there s cavalry 
infantry will be close behind 
meade s closing fast 
it could be he s thinking
of swinging round behind us 
behind  in front  direction does not matter 
we ll fight him wherever he is 
probably got old abe lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of pennsylvania 
we may have an opportunity here 
i agree 
our objective was to get their army
out of virginia and into the open 
now they are in the open 
general meade has been forcing
the march 
the weather has been unusually hot 
he will probably arrive here worn out
and weary  piece by piece 
if we concentrate 
we can hit him as he comes up 
if we can take out a few of his corps 
we can even the odds 
but we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly 
what artillery is that  major 
i don t know  sir 
general heth is in front 
  my instructions were clear 
  yes  sir  to all commanders 
avoid contact with the enemy
until the army s up and concentrated 
and general heth 
he has instructions
not to force major action 
i told him this morning 
we should move closer to the front 
send for general heth 
  i must know what is going on 
  yes  sir 
general   
in the fight that is coming 
i want you to stay back from the main line 
this army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders   
and you  sir  have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward 
can t lead from behind 
may i say it plainly  sir 
i cannot afford to lose you 
now  general  let s look to this day 
you may bring up your corps 
major taylor  have traveler saddled up 
  i m going to look around for myself 
  yes  sir 
they ve got a brigade in position
and that s all 
we ve got the best damn ground around 
and they re hitting me with one brigade 
lovely 
go on down  gentlemen 
fall back 
they are on the run 
close crop  general 
  how are your losses 
  not bad at all  sir 
we got them out in the open 
really got a twist on them 
they are arrogant people  you know 
they came right at us 
we took some prisoners 
they re from heth s division of hill s corps 
that s what i ve got in front of me 
a new division  8 000 men more or less 
all within sound of this 
just back up that road between here
and cashtown  a little ways up the road 
it ll take them a little while to get on line 
yes  sir  but hill s whole corps is behind 
maybe 25 000 
longstreet behind that 
ewell over there to the north 
i know  colonel 
when john reynolds gets here 
he won t have the full army with him 
only part of it 
the point is  the rebs will be here
this afternoon   
with everything they ve got 
i just thought i d mention it 
what do you want me to do here  sir 
heth will be back in a bit 
if he s got any brains at all 
and he s not stupid   
he ll know by now he s got at least
a brigade in front of him 
he won t wait
to get his whole division in line 
that would take half the morning 
he don t need his whole division 
that s right 
does devin report any activity on his front
over to the right 
  no  sir  not a lick 
  all right 
i ll have devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys   
and have them move in alongside you 
lengthening your line 
when heth gets back 
he ll run into two brigades 
that ought to hold him
until reynolds gets here 
right  sir 
damn sure glad the rain is gone 
don t want anything to slow up reynolds 
take care of yourself  colonel 
don t worry about me  sir 
i m the soul of caution 
fire 
move  fall back 
that flank    hold it 
keep up your fire 
gamble s down  sir 
colonel gamble  but he s not hurt bad  sir 
i m all right 
it was close  that s all 
sir  colonel devin s compliments 
no problem on the right 
they came up close 
but we put in the reserve 
we didn t put it all in  sir 
wishes to know if you have further orders 
tell devin all reserve forward  now 
keep up your fire 
fire 
fire 
sir  it s general reynolds 
thank god 
what goes  john 
there s the devil to pay 
  can you hold 
  i reckon i can 
heth probably has about 10 000 men
coming down that road  wouldn t you say 
yes  sir  but there ll be more behind him 
we can put almost 20 000 in the field 
we re in very good shape  i think 
for a while  sir 
i m sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed 
it s lovely ground 
i thought so  sir 
now let s go surprise harry heth 
come on 
  general heth 
  sir  i beg to report 
yes 
very strange  sir 
the situation is very confused 
what happened 
i moved in this morning  as directed 
i thought it was only a few militia 
but it was dismounted cavalry  sir 
there weren t all that many 
and the boys wouldn t hold back 
i thought we shouldn t be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry   
but they made a good fight 
they really put up a scrap  sir 
go on  general 
well  sir  they wouldn t leave 
my boys got their dander up 
we deployed the whole division
and went after them 
we just about had them running
then all of a sudden   
they got infantry support 
we got pushed back 
then we re formed and tried again 
we couldn t just leave it to them  sir 
now there s more yankee infantry coming 
i don t know how many 
but i don t know
what else we could ve done 
it started as a minor scrap
with a few militia 
the next thing i know 
i m tangling with half the union army 
things will get out of control  mr  heth 
that is why we have orders 
  is it possible you misunderstood them 
  no  sir 
can you identify those people 
the infantry is the first corps 
the black hats 
there s another corps coming
that we haven t identified 
i must have all possible information
on enemy strength 
major taylor  i want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe 
  and do be careful 
  yes  sir 
  sir  shall i attack 
  no  sir 
we are not ready for full engagement 
general longstreet is not up
with his corps 
sir  the enemy is disorganized 
if we throw all our forces in the field 
we will have the advantage 
is that our artillery 
yes  sir 
i can t imagine what has happened
to general stuart 
  i ve heard nothing  do you understand 
  yes  sir 
i have no idea of what lies in front of me 
it may be the entire federal army 
sir  compliments of colonel babbit 
rebels are coming from the north 
your instructions  sir 
that ll be ewell s corps 
they re trying to flank us 
we got to meet them
and force them to go on line 
tell colonel devin to get up that way
as quick as he can 
we ll get gamble s boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly 
general rodes has encountered
yankee cavalry  sir 
buford s brigades 
general early s right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour 
general early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour 
  is that pender s artillery 
  yes  sir  he s up now  sir 
four batteries in position
with two more in reserve 
with general rodes attacking up there
and pender and i  we have three divisions 
we could sweep them 
general  sir 
i saw only two federal corps 
first and eleventh 
and  general  i saw early s lead columns
coming down north of rodes  lines 
he ll be engaged any minute  sir 
sir  we got 20 000 infantry coming down
almost behind the union lines 
it s perfect  sir 
god s will 
gentlemen  it would appear
the fight is already underway 
general heth  you may attack  sir 
my orders to all commanders  attack 
fire 
forward men  final brigade forward 
forward  for god s sake  forward 
he s dead 
one thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call 
ever hear tell of dan butterfield 
what  general butterfield 
what was with hooker 
that s the same fellow 
  he used to be our brigade commander 
  yeah  he was a pistol 
  no man like him for having a good time 
  i don t know about that 
but i know he used to like
to write bugle calls 
the problem with this army is 
we got too many calls 
we got a call for artillery  infantry 
get up and eat  retreat 
anyway  old butterfield  he wrote
a special call for this here brigade 
say there is an order for this brigade 
you and me 
he ll be blowing his bugle  we will think
that order s for us when it wasn t 
we ll follow that order anyway 
then we ll be in a world of hurt 
yeah  that happened to me once 
us  that is 
half the regiment charged 
the other half retreated 
you had your choice 
this here brigade got a special call 
you hear that call 
you know the next one is for you 
it goes like this 
colonel  sir 
begging the colonel s pardon 
but would the colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse 
i ll tell you  sir 
it s not easy handling these new recruits   
when the officers act
like they ain t got any sense  sir 
lawrence  sir 
we ve gone over 20 miles today 
we ve gone over 100 miles
in five days  sir 
there s something going on 
  colonel vincent  sir 
  mister chamberlain 
far cry from bowdoin college 
wouldn t you say 
no farther than harvard yard 
indeed  with luck  we ll both see
our alma maters again 
in the meantime  colonel  you move
your boys along as best you can 
two corps have engaged at gettysburg 
so we ll keep going through dark
and on until we get there 
yes  sir 
godspeed 
fire 
they re running 
general pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back 
  they re on the run 
  very well  lieutenant 
general early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank  going back to gettysburg 
  they re all running 
  very well  thank you  corporal 
find general hill s chief of artillery 
tell him i want fire placed on that hill 
as much fire as possible 
  yes  sir 
  very well 
  major taylor 
  yes  sir 
deliver this message in person 
tell general ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion 
we must only push those people
in order to gain the heights 
tell him to take that hill  if practical 
the one beyond the town 
do you understand 
  yes  sir 
  very well 
congratulations  general 
i want you to see this 
it s like second manassas all over again 
couldn t have worked better
if we d planned it 
if we can take that hill 
i want it occupied by nightfall 
sir  the federal army has fallen back
through gettysburg 
they re reforming on the ridges
outside of town 
very well 
this is almost perfect 
we got them where we want them 
let s move south and east 
get between them and lincoln   
find some high ground   
and they ll have to hit us 
then we have them  general 
you mean disengage 
i ve always been under the impression   
that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible   
in order to keep the army intact 
granted  but the situation has changed 
  in what way 
  we ve already pushed them back 
they re on the run  vacating the town 
how can we move off
in the face of the enemy 
  major marshall 
  yes  sir 
i ordered firing on that hill 
but no cannons are firing 
  send over and find out why 
  i ll see to it  sir 
thank you 
what are you thinking  general 
maybe we should not have fought here 
i know that  but we have prevailed 
the men have prevailed 
yes  they ve always done that 
but in the morning 
we may be outnumbered   
and they ll be entrenched
on the high ground 
you know as well as i  we ve never been
concerned with being outnumbered 
that is true  sir  you are right 
if we move south to washington 
they have to pursue us 
then we can fight on ground
of our choosing 
but the enemy is here 
we did not want the fight 
but the fight is here 
how can i ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they ve done this day 
not retreat  sir  re deploy 
our guns will move them off that hill
or ewell will push them off 
but if meade is there tomorrow 
i can t move this army away 
i will attack him 
if meade is up there tomorrow 
it is because he wants us to attack him 
we pushed back two corps 
but there are five more coming 
general  i will bring up my boys
as soon as i can 
very well 
  general 
  sir 
your man harrison  the actor 
he was quite correct 
had it not been for him  this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail 
the federal force might ve been here
waiting when we turned around 
i m deeply grateful to you  sir 
hello  men 
what outfit are you with 
archer s brigade  heth s division 
  where are you from 
  tennessee 
how about you 
maine 
i ve never been to tennessee 
i reckon i ve never been to maine neither 
i don t mean no disrespect
to you fighting men   
but sometimes i can t help but figure 
why are you fighting this war 
why are you fighting it 
to free the slaves  of course 
and to preserve the union 
i don t know about other folk 
but i ain t fighting for no darkies 
i m fighting for my rights 
that s what we re all fighting for 
for your what 
for our rights 
why is it you folks can t just live
the way you want to live   
and let us live the way we do 
 live and let live   i hear some folks say 
be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart 
where d you get captured 
railroad cut just west of gettysburg town 
it wasn t a pretty sight 
many a good boy lost
a young and promising life 
some wore blue  some wore gray 
seen enough of this war 
i guess i have 
i guess i have  too 
it looks like i ll be sitting out the rest of it 
i appreciate you talking to me 
see you in hell  billy yank 
see you in hell  johnny reb 
i have found a john henry  sir 
john who 
a john henry  sir  a runaway 
i heard him a groaning 
is he wounded 
don t know for sure 
the man s exhausted 
we ll get him something to eat 
the surgeon s on the way 
  did you get his name 
  he said something i couldn t understand 
i can t understand anyone
south of mason dixon 
rebs or darkies 
all right  men  as you were 
surgeon  see to him 
we used to have visitors from the south
before the war 
they were always very polite  academic 
you understand 
we stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy 
but toward the end there was
no getting away from it   
and yet i could never understand 
i don t now 
i don t know why 
they fight so well 
tell me something  buster   
what do you think of negroes 
well  if you mean the race   
i don t really know 
this is not a thing to be ashamed of 
the thing is  you cannot judge a race 
any man who judges by the group
is a pea wit 
you take men one at a time 
to me  there was never any difference 
  none at all 
  none at all 
of course  i haven t known
that many freed men   
but those i knew in bangor  portland   
you look in the eye  there was a man 
there was a  divine spark  
as my mother used to call it 
that is all there is to it 
races are men 
 what a piece of work is man 
 how infinite in faculties 
in form and moving   
 how express and admirable 
 in action  how like an angel  
well  if he s an angel  all right then   
but he damn well must be a killer angel 
colonel  darling  you re a lovely man 
i see a great vast difference between us 
yet i admire you  lad 
you re an idealist  praise be 
the truth is  colonel   
there is no  divine spark  
there s many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog  believe me 
when you ve seen them hang each other
the way i have back in the old country 
equality 
what i m fighting for is the right to prove
i m a better man than many of them 
where have you seen this  divine spark 
in operation  colonel 
where have you noted
this magnificent equality 
no two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance 
not a leaf  not a tree 
there s many a man worse than me
and some better   
but i don t think race or country
matters a damn 
what matters  colonel   
is justice 
which is why i m here 
i ll be treated as i deserve   
not as my father deserved 
i m kilrain   
and i damn all gentlemen 
there is only one aristocracy   
and that is right here 
and that s why we ve got to win this war 
howdy 
howdy  general 
hello  my boys  virginia has arrived 
general pickett presents
his compliments   
and asks to  parler  with
the commanding general   s il vous plaît  
hey  george 
general 
good lord  what is that smell 
that s me  ain t it lovely 
he got it off a dead frenchman 
  good evening to you  james 
  hey  lo 
i did not get it off a dead frenchman 
i bought it in a store
in richmond with sally 
it did have a french name 
but miss corbert likes it 
excuse me 
gentlemen  colonel fremantle 
allow me to introduce
major general george pickett 
general pickett 
lieutenant colonel arthur fremantle   
of her majesty s venerable
and elite cold stream guards   
britain s military attach é 
to the confederacy   
and  you might say 
the eyes and ears of queen victoria 
hardly  sir  i m merely an observer
and your humble guest 
the fame of your regiment
has preceded you 
general pickett here
is our ranking strategist 
the first corps army of northern virginia 
we refer all our deeper questions to him 
they do  they do indeed 
his record at west point
is still the talk of both armies 
you know i consider it unbecoming
to a soldier  all this book learning 
  book learning ain t for gentlemen  right 
  nor that either 
he graduated last in his class  dead last 
quite a feat  considering his classmates 
the yankees got all the smart ones 
look where it s got them 
let me present my commanders 
each one of these chaps  as you might say 
commands a brigade of mine 
now this fellow here  this is lo armistead 
lo  that s short for lothario 
the lover 
this here is richard brooke garnett 
you ll pardon his limp 
he got kicked by his horse the other day 
that fellow there   
that s jim kemper 
you note the shifty eye 
the hand in the pocket 
he s not even a west pointer 
so watch him 
he s a politician from virginia 
jimmy s only here for the votes 
i was speaker of the house in virginia 
as a matter of fact  i d like to talk to you
about some political matters 
you know the queen  don t you 
what i need to know
and tell my folks back home is 
when are you going to do something   
about that damn yankee blockade
out there on the water 
can you tell me something about that 
have you heard any news of old winfield 
old winnie boy 
hancock  oh  yeah 
well  how s he doing 
you re going to find out 
he s got the second corps 
he s headed this way  probably run
into him in the next few days 
i wish i could see him again 
i haven t seen him since before the war 
never thought it would last this long 
me neither  lo 
i sure would like to talk
to old hancock again 
one more time 
well  why not 
you wouldn t mind 
hell  no 
i mean  really 
do you think it would be proper 
you know  ethical 
when the time comes  and he s close   
just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over 
ain t nothing to it 
last time i saw him was in california 
right when the war was beginning   
the night before we all left
to go fight against each other 
old friends off to war 
how s your brigade 
i ve never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl 
i ve got to give the old man credit 
a lot of credit for that 
who else could ve held
this army together for so long 
remember what they used to say
about him 
when he first took command 
they called him  old granny  
lord  what damn fools we were 
now when he passes   
the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the lord 
have you ever seen anything like that 
no  i can t say i have 
it s amazing what one honest man can do 
one honest man and a cause 
i don t think on that too much anymore 
i guess my only cause is victory 
this war comes as a nightmare 
you pick your nightmare side 
then you put your head down and win 
old gloomy pete 
you see  colonel   
the government derives its power
from the consent of the people 
every government  everywhere 
let me make this very plain to you  sir 
we do not consent
and we will never consent 
and what you ve got to do is 
you ve got to go back over there   
to your parliament and you ve got
to make it very plain to them 
you ve got to tell them
that what we re fighting for here   
is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power 
i mean  that s all we want 
that s what this war is all about 
now we established this country
in the first place   
with very strong state governments   
just for that very reason 
i mean  let me put it to you this way 
my home is in virginia 
the government of my home is home 
virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled   
by some king over there in london 
it s not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in washington 
virginia  by god  sir 
is going to be run by virginians 
oh  my  the cause 
actually  jimmy  i got a pair of kings 
and it s all for the yankees 
the damn money grubbing yankees 
i mean  those damn fools 
they don t get the message 
always the darkies 
nothing but the darkies 
you know  jim   
sit down  i think that my idea   
my analogy of a gentlemen s club
is fair enough  it s clear enough 
colonel  think on it now 
suppose that we all joined a club 
a gentlemen s club 
after a time  several of the members
began to intrude themselves   
into our private lives  our home lives 
began telling us
what we could and couldn t do 
well  then  wouldn t any one of us
have the right to resign 
i mean  just resign 
that s what we did 
that s what i did and now these people
are telling us we don t have that right 
i got to hand it to you 
you certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous   
and complicating the obvious 
have you ever considered
running for congress 
no  it s a thought 
what does colonel fremantle think 
will the british come in on our side 
hell  yeah  they ll come in
when we don t need them no more 
like some damn bank lending you money
when you re no longer in debt 
  look here  mr  speaker   
  george 
a word 
goodnight  colonel 
see you later 
in the next few days  i believe
we re going to have a hell of a fight here 
i want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready 
you can start bringing them up
by the first light 
i want you all in gettysburg
by tomorrow night 
yes  sir 
good evening  john 
i m surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion 
there s an old indian saying 
 follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there  
general hancock 
how are you  john 
i m all right 
but the brigades are pretty shot up 
i need to get refitted 
right  i ll see to it 
we know what you did this morning 
  that was one hell of a piece of soldiering 
  thank you  sir 
heard you were with john reynolds
when he was killed 
i m sending the body up
to his folks in lancaster 
they might appreciate a note from you 
i ll send it 
he was a soldier 
and a good friend 
three of us  reynolds 
lo armistead and i came up together 
mexican war 
california 
we stayed close 
i wonder how old lo is doing 
if he s still alive 
heard he had one of pickett s brigades 
under longstreet 
remarkable 
just across the ridge 
i d like to see him again  but not here 
not like this 
well  maybe after the war 
where do you want me in the morning 
i want you to hold your position
on the extreme left 
get some rest if you can 
we may need you in the morning 
jeb stuart s still on the prowl
out there someplace 
yes  sir 
well  general reynolds   
we held the high ground 
general trimble is waiting 
  will you see him now 
  very well 
major  i want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find general stuart 
  yes  sir  right away  sir 
  thank you 
general trimble 
sir  i most respectfully request
another assignment 
do please go on  general 
the man is a disgrace 
sir  have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you 
ask general gordon or general ewell 
ask them 
we could ve taken that hill 
god in his wisdom knows
we should ve taken it 
there was no one there at all
and it commanded the town 
general gordon saw it 
i mean  he was with us 
me and ewell and gordon   
all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty 
i beg your pardon  general 
that bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head 
we all saw it  as god is my witness 
we were all there 
i said to him   general ewell 
we have got to take that hill  
general jackson wouldn t have stopped
with them on the run   
and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty 
god help us 
i don t know   
i don t know why   
do please continue  general 
yes  sir 
sir 
i said to general ewell these words   
i said to him 
 sir  give me one division
and i will take that hill  
he said nothing 
he just stood there and stared at me 
i said   general ewell 
give me one brigade   
 and i will take that hill  
i was becoming disturbed  sir 
and general ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked 
so i said 
 general  give me one regiment   
 and i will take that hill  
and he said nothing 
he just stood there 
i threw down my sword 
down on the ground in front of him 
we could have done it  sir 
a blind man should have seen it 
now they re working up there 
you can hear the axes
of the federal troops 
and so in the morning   
many a good boy will die   
taking that hill 
sir 
i must request another assignment 
no  sir  that won t be necessary 
you will be of great service 
and i do thank you 
general meade  sir 
hancock  it s so damn dark out there
i can t see a thing 
gentlemen 
i hope to god that this is   
good ground 
is this good ground  general 
is this a place to have an army 
very good ground  sir 
i hope you are right 
because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning 
  will there be anything else  sir 
  no  thank you  major 
very well 
in the morning is the great battle 
tomorrow or the next day
will determine the war 
virginia is here 
all the south is here 
what will you do tomorrow 
in the morning   
the enemy will be up
in fortified positions on high ground 
longstreet s corps will be coming up   
and my boys will be ready
to finish the job 
if i tell them to withdraw now  no  sir 
they ve been patient for far too long 
with the enemy out there up on the hill   
they ll be ready to finish the job 
but i don t even know
how much is up there 
how many men  how many cannon 
i don t know the ground on the flanks 
i don t know 
if i wait in the morning 
the early morning   
maybe meade  under pressure  will attack 
that would make general longstreet
very happy 
but i don t think meade will come down 
and i don t think i can withdraw  so   
god s will  thy will be done 
major sorrel  you ve met before 
thank you  general 
the federal position was scouted
during the last several hours 
we ve drawn it up here 
now this is the situation 
the position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook 
it starts here  you see these two hills 
this one and the one with the cemetery 
that is where they have concentrated
their troops 
the hook starts there 
now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south 
ending before two round hills
of high elevation 
the federals have no troops
on those two hills 
  carry on  major 
  thank you 
we now know that general hancock
is in charge of the union center 
there are now perhaps 60 000
to 70 000 men already in position 
perhaps as high as 90 000 
i spoke with general ewell
of your suggestion   
that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army 
and he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from gettysburg   
and giving it back to the enemy
would be very bad for morale 
it is unnecessary 
it might even be dangerous 
do you disagree 
we must attack 
i would prefer not to fight
upon this ground   
but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself 
we cannot support ourselves for long
in this country 
we must not allow the federal army
to move around behind   
and cut us off from home  no  sir 
we must strike him now 
we pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it 
the men are ready and they are eager 
i see no useful alternative 
yes  sir 
very well 
gentlemen 
  good morning  all 
  good morning  sir 
longstreet will attack on the right
with the first corps 
hill will support   
with heth in reserve 
ewell s people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy   
from reinforcing against our right flank 
yes  sir  but i still don t have pickett 
he s at the rear of column 
a full day s march 
all i ve got is hood and mclaws 
i do believe that hood s
and mclaws  divisions will be sufficient 
  with the general s permission 
  general hood 
moving in front of those rocky heights 
we ll have enfilade fire   
coming down on us 
perhaps  but not for long  your division   
will be up over this unoccupied hill 
the little  rocky one 
from there you will threaten
the enemy flank 
when you re heavily engaged 
general ewell will strike from the left 
very well  sir 
  general 
  let s move out  gentlemen 
general barksdale 
is mississippi ready for this day 
  mississippi is ready 
  very well 
let s go to it  sam 
if he s right  general lee   
then the war is over by sundown 
we ll see 
i don t like going in without pickett 
it s like going in with one boot off 
i ll wait as long as i can 
do you have any idea of the force 
we counted five corps  including
the two involved in yesterday s action 
that don t mean how many might be   
hidden behind those hills there 
and  damn it  with stuart gone
there ain t no way of knowing for sure 
take good care of yourself today 
you hear 
you  too  pete 
with your permission  sir 
i don t believe i ve had the pleasure 
that s major general john bell hood 
but we call him sam 
one of my three division commanders 
fellows from texas and alabama 
you ve been to texas  as i recall 
yes  actually that s where i came through 
courtesy of the yankee navy
who denied me any other point of entry 
it s a marvelous place  texas 
full of red indians and mexicans   
cowboys  bandits and desperados 
even hotter and more humid
than this place 
if that s possible 
that fellow hood   
does his performance in battle
match his appearance 
he really does look the part 
he does his job 
most interesting army  i must say 
virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside texas frontiersmen   
and bayou bushwhackers from louisiana 
drawn together from across a continent 
having traveled a good piece of it myself 
i feel a part   
or almost a member of this enterprise 
you call yourselves americans 
but you re really transplanted englishmen 
look at your names  lee  hood   
longstreet  jackson  stuart 
my people were dutch 
and the same for your adversaries 
meade  hooker  hancock  and   
shall i say  lincoln 
the same god  same language 
same culture and history 
the same songs  stories  legends  myths 
but different dreams 
different dreams 
it s so very sad  very sad 
you english had your own civil war once 
didn t you 
that was ages ago 
we wouldn t dream of it now 
cavaliers and roundheads 
 off with his head  
heads lying everywhere 
one could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown 
we re much more civilized now 
i assure you 
we have so much in common 
your country and mine 
i earnestly hope
that we shall become allies 
your government would never ally itself
with a confederacy   
that had the institution of slavery 
you know that  so do i 
we should have freed the slaves 
then fired on fort sumter 
i guess we southerners and you english
have at least one thing in common 
we d rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake 
we whupped you british twice
as i recollect 
your candor is admirable 
if somewhat eccentric 
a little eccentricity is good for a general 
we southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad 
i suspect that s why the women
fall in love with preachers 
in nomine pater  et filii  et spiritus sancti 
amen 
general longstreet 
do you mind if i accompany you 
not at all  i m very glad
to have you with us  sir 
the heat reminds me of mexico 
yes  but there it was very dry 
that was a good outfit 
i remember storming the ramparts
of chapultapec with old george pickett 
reynolds    my old friend 
ulysses sam grant 
  there was some good men in that army 
  yes  indeed 
some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges 
i don t know  i sometimes feel troubled 
those fellows  those boys in blue 
they never quite seem the enemy 
i know 
i used to command some of those boys 
swore an oath  too 
i couldn t fight against georgia
and south carolina 
not against my own family 
no  sir  there was always a higher duty
to virginia 
that was our first duty 
there was never any question about that 
  i guess so 
  let us not think about that now 
the issue is in god s hands 
we can only do our duty 
general 
soldiering has one great trap 
to be a good soldier
you must love the army 
to be a good commander 
you must be willing to order the death   
of the thing you love 
we do not fear our own death  you and i 
but there comes a time   
we are never quite prepared
for so many to die 
we do expect the occasional empty chair 
a salute to fallen comrades   
but this war goes on and on
and the men die   
and the price gets ever higher 
we are prepared to lose some of us 
but we are never prepared to lose all of us 
and there is the great trap  general 
when you attack 
you must hold nothing back 
you must commit yourself totally 
we are adrift here in a sea of blood 
and i want it to end 
i want this to be the final battle 
i woke up this morning and i half thought
he d be gone  george meade 
that he would not want to fight here 
yes  sir 
i woke up and i thought 
 meade will be gone   
 and this war will go on and on and on  
we ll make him sorry he stayed 
god go with you  general 
and with you  general 
that s mostly to the south 
i thought the rebs were all in gettysburg 
you don t suppose they re flanking again 
mama s favorite  let s go 
lawrence  what s happening 
sir  corporal estabrook reporting back  sir 
  brook  i thought you were on sick call 
  yes  sir 
how are you now 
it s my stomach 
i ve been throwing up  sir 
it s something you ate 
  finish up  we re about to move out 
  yes  sir 
  colonel chamberlain 
  colonel vincent 
form your men 
follow me and prepare to double quick 
we re going to the top of that hill 
right there 
  you hear that 
  yes  sir  i ll set it up 
the rebels are stacking up
on our left flank 
and we ve got to follow them 
  make haste 
  yes  sir 
sound the assembly 
follow me 
powder in  load 
general 
look here 
the ground is strewn with boulders 
the soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground 
and there are guns in the rocks 
every move i make is observed 
if i attack as ordered 
i lose half my division 
and they ll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there 
we must move around to the right  sir 
and take them from the rear 
the commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills 
i argued it yesterday 
i argued it all morning 
i ve been arguing against any attack at all 
i can t call this one off  you know it 
let me move up the big round hill
to the south 
nobody is on that 
if i could get a battery up there   
there ain t enough time 
you d have to cut down trees
to place your artillery 
it would be dark before you were in action 
one the other hand 
if they get batteries up there   
we ll need buckets to catch the lead 
you ve got to take that hill 
they don t even need guns to defend that 
all they need to do
is roll rocks down on you 
just take it 
general 
i do this under protest 
sam  you are the best i got 
now  sir  if you are ready 
why don t you take that hill 
they re overshooting again 
hey  fellows  you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots 
  tom 
  yes  sir 
another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for mother 
go back to the rear 
watch out for stragglers 
keep your distance from me 
lawrence  i don t   
the whole damn reb army is down there   
and coming up around our flanks 
they could be here any minute 
we ve got to hold this place 
we ve got to hold it 
well  all right  i place you here 
put your colors here  and set
your regiment to the left of this line 
the rest of the brigade
will form on your right  understood 
  yes  ellis  this is the point 
  sir 
your regiment is to the left of this point 
  colonel  sir  you re the end of the line 
  yes 
you re the extreme left of the union army 
understood 
the line runs from here
back to cemetery hill   
  but it ends here 
  understood 
you can t withdraw under any condition 
if you go  this line will be flanked 
if you go  the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside   
and take this entire army from the rear 
  you must defend this place to the last 
  yes  sir 
now we ll see how professors fight 
ellis  position the regiment 
all company commanders here 
yes  sir 
sharpshooters to the left 
battalion on the right 
now file into line  march 
bugler  sound the officer s call 
 hold to the last   to the last what 
exercise in rhetoric 
last shell  last man 
last foot of ground  last reb 
advance 
move out 
turn those guns around 
the 83rd pennsylvania  44th new york 
and 16th michigan   
will be moving in to our right 
but if you look left  you will see   
that there is no one there 
because we re the end of the line 
the union army stops here 
we are the flank 
do you understand  gentlemen 
we cannot retreat  we cannot withdraw 
we are going to have
to be stubborn today 
put the boys in position 
tell them to stay down 
pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can 
i want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards 
sloping ground is good ground 
if you have any breakthroughs 
men wounded  a hole in the line   
plug it with the reserve 
how s our ammunition 
sir  i think about 60 rounds per man 
that s good  60 rounds  i think   
yes  that s adequate 
any questions 
colonel 
it seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill 
it seems to me that we re the back door 
and everything s going on
at the front door 
that hill is steep and rocky  it s bare 
to come straight up it is impossible 
the reb army is going to swing around it 
it ll come up through that notch
right over there 
it ll move under the cover of trees 
trying to get around the flank 
and gentlemen   
we are the flank 
gentlemen 
god go with you 
captain clark 
take the right side from the 83rd   
over in this direction to the center 
ellis  take the left but be watchful 
your flank will be in the air 
  colonel  sir 
  corporal estabrook 
what do i do with these prisoners 
the hardheads of the second maine 
do any of you care to join us 
  the rebs really coming 
  they re really coming 
well  it s kind of dull
just sitting here watching  sir 
for any man who joins us 
there will be no court martial 
no man will call me a coward 
why not 
i ll waste no man to guard you 
i expect you to be here when this is over 
  let s get these fellows some muskets 
  there are no muskets  sir 
wait here for a bit 
there will be guns available
in a little while 
that s the new york boys 
the rebs must be getting closer 
must be moving this way 
private foss is praying 
  will you put in a kind word for me 
  yes  sir 
  you re the merrill brothers  right 
  yes  sir 
boys  why aren t you on the ground 
sir  i can t shoot worth a darn lying down 
never could  bill neither 
we like to fight standing 
i suggest you find a thicker tree 
here they come 
i want you to stay with me 
but you keep down 
buster 
i bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way 
walk down the line 
tell the boys to get good cover 
pile the rocks high and fire carefully 
  go down and come back 
  right 
you got to keep an eye on them 
some of them load but never fire 
they just keep right on loading 
some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel 
never fired a shot 
sir 
fire 
keep up your fire  boys 
keep your head down 
watch your left side 
keep up your fire 
they re falling back 
they ll be back in a minute 
  how are we doing 
  we re doing fine 
  colonel 
  captain clark  anybody hurt 
  head and shoulder wounds 
  they didn t hit the left 
they re moving out that way 
can you see them  sir 
they re coming again  boys 
colonel  look here 
a new regiment has arrived
that s moving against the left 
it s out there  do you see them 
double quick 
i don t think we ll be able
to hold another one 
  get all company commanders up here 
  on the double 
  sergeant owen 
  yes  sir 
get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there 
yes  sir 
we re about to be flanked 
here s what we ll do 
i want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire 
keep a tight hold on the 83rd 
on old pennsylvania over there 
i want no break in the line 
captain clark  that s you 
you understand  no breaks 
right wing will sidestep to the left   
thinning out to twice the present distance 
you see the colors 
they will end up down to the extreme left 
when you reach that point 
we are going to refuse the line 
understand 
we ll form a new line at right angles 
we ll pull up as much of a reserve
as possible 
we ve got to be able to counter attack
whenever there s a hole 
  any questions 
  no  sir 
fine  move 
lieutenant  you fellows  on the double 
come on 
  how are you  andrew 
  i m fine  sir  and you 
a bit worn 
  the boys are putting up a hell of a fight 
  they are indeed 
i got me one  i got me a reb 
buster  are you all right 
i ll be fine in a minute 
but plays hell with me target practice 
the surgeon will see to it 
no  a little bandage is all i ll be needing 
a few minutes off my feet 
me brogans are killing me 
colonel  my men are getting low
on ammunition 
go over to the 83rd 
ask them to send what they can 
lieutenant  go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can 
  pick up what you can from anywhere 
  here they come  sir 
keep up the fire 
fill your holes down here 
there they go 
i ll be damned 
they keep coming 
how long are they going to keep coming 
i don t have much left  i got two shots 
that s what i got 
they keep coming on the flanks 
they keep moving to the left more 
they can t send help from the 83rd 
they say they got their own troubles 
  colonel  sir  we d like to report 
  what 
vincent is badly wounded 
he got hit a few minutes
after the fight started 
we ve been reinforced at the top of the hill
by weed s brigade up front 
this is what they tell me 
but weed is dead 
so they moved hazlett s
battery of artillery up there 
but hazlett s dead  far as i can tell   
can you can get ammunition
from up there 
i don t know  it s a mess 
but they re holding good 
the rebs are having a hard time climbing 
  it s a steep hill 
  we ll need the ammunition 
colonel  sir  the better of my men
are wounded 
if the rebs come up that hill any stronger 
we can t stop them 
send out word to take ammunition
from the wounded 
  make every round count  go 
  here they come again 
ready  boys 
come on  keep it coming  keep it up  lads 
pour it on  boys 
keep at them  keep up your fire 
here they come  boys 
go plug that hole over there 
sir  half my men are down 
most of the rest are wounded 
the left is too thin 
  how is our ammunition 
  almost gone 
sir  we re running out 
we don t have much left to shoot with 
some boys got nothing at all 
what do we do for ammunition 
my boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them 
  we ought to pull out 
  no  we can t do that 
we can t hold them again  sir 
if we don t  they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in 
here they come 
we can t run away 
if we stay here  we can t shoot 
so let s fix bayonets 
we ll have the advantage
moving down the hill 
they must be tired if we are 
so fix bayonets 
ellis  you take the left wing 
i ll take the right 
right wheel forward  the whole regiment 
  you mean charge 
  yes  but here s what we do 
we re going to charge
swinging down the hill 
just like we pulled back to the left side   
we ll swing it down like a door 
we ll sweep them down the hill
as they come up  understand 
  does everybody understand 
  yes  sir 
ellis  take the left wing 
when i command  the whole regiment
goes forward swinging down to the right 
all right  sir  fine 
move 
bayonets 
come on  let s go  move 
quickly  boys  quickly 
let s go 
bayonets 
draw 
bayonets 
left swing  right wheel 
right wheel 
charge 
charge 
go 
the pistol 
your prisoner  sir 
wait here 
by god  colonel 
the boys are still advancing 
  you better stop them 
  they re on their way to richmond 
  richmond 
  they ve done enough for today 
i want you to meet
this fellow from alabama 
captain hawkins  this is my brother 
colonel chamberlain 
sir 
may i have some water 
yes 
sure  tom  get this man a canteen 
yes  sir  right this way 
how you doing 
twice 
would you believe  for the love of mary 
twice 
and how are you  colonel  darling 
this fine day 
i got it in the armpit 
for the love of god  in the bloody armpit 
how is he 
it s an arm 
only an arm  you got to lose something 
it might as well be an arm 
i can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature  and that s the truth 
i could do with a nip right now 
i ll see what i can do 
you do pretty good 
colonel   
i m right here  buster  i m right here 
the army was blessed 
i want to tell you  just in case   
that i never served   
i ve never served with a better man 
don t worry  sir 
he ll make it  he s a tough old mick 
colonel  sir  it would so honor me 
colonel  sir  i ve been moving these rebs
with an empty musket 
that s allowed 
you re ordered to go to the top
of the big hill 
  my new yorkers will take your prisoners 
  yes  sir 
we watched from our position above 
it s the damnedest thing i ever saw 
may i shake your hand  sir 
colonel  one thing 
the name of this place  this hill   
has it got a name  this hill 
this is little round top 
that s the name of the hill you defended 
the big one you re going up to 
that s big round top 
is that so  i guess i ll remember that 
ellis  move the men out 
i m going to go ahead 
sam 
we drugged him  sir 
it d be better if he slept 
didn t see much 
the boys went in  hit the rocks 
how did it go  pete 
fine  sam 
we take those rocks 
most of them 
worst   
ground i ever saw 
you know that 
they call it   
devil s den  it s a good name for it 
what casualties 
don t know yet 
got to give my boys credit 
you should ve let me go to the right 
we should ve gone to the right 
he needs to rest some 
you summoned me  sir 
harrison 
i did 
i ve got some night work 
are you up to it 
 all the world will be in love with night   
 and pay no worship to the garish sun  
when this is all over 
i do look forward to seeing you on stage 
what are the general s wishes 
i want you to go out on the right 
scout the federal position 
their condition  what they ve got
in reserve  what they re bringing up 
it ll probably take all night 
but i want it right and clear 
  your obedient servant  general 
  good 
now  harrison  it ll be dangerous 
and i do appreciate this 
thank you  sir 
but i must confess 
the thing that bothers me about this job   
is the absence of an audience 
when you do it right  no one knows it 
nobody ever watches your work 
do you see 
that s very hard on an actor 
go on 
general  i m very glad to see you well 
i ve just come by for my orders  sir 
it would appear
that general stuart has returned 
the prodigal son 
it was very close this afternoon 
sir 
they nearly broke 
i could feel them breaking 
there for a moment i thought i saw
our flags go up the hill 
it wasn t that close 
the attacks were not properly
coordinated  i do not know why 
and nevertheless  we nearly won the day 
i could see a clear road
all the way to washington 
how is it with general hood 
i think he ll live  may lose an arm 
dear god 
i couldn t spare general hood 
so many good men were lost this day 
sir 
lo did take the peach orchard
and wheat field 
but he couldn t get up that ridge 
and hood  he seized the devil s den 
but he couldn t take the little rocky hill 
the federals still hold the heights 
and they re reinforced 
general 
that way around to the right is still open 
i will think on it  general 
we have enough artillery
for one more good fight  but just one 
i know 
let me think on it 
  general   
  i am very glad to see you well 
we will speak again in the morning 
you know  hearing you talk
about monkeys and trees   
i remember the time
during a cannonade on the peninsula 
there was one tree
for the men to hide behind 
it was a skinny little tree
and the boys  they fell in behind it   
in a long thin line
which ruled just like a pigtail 
it swayed to one side  then the other 
a shell came this way 
the line swayed that way 
a cannonball came that way 
the line swayed this way 
it was a thing to see 
george  what has that got to do
with what we re talking about 
general 
carry on  gentlemen 
don t let me interrupt the revival 
general  you re just in time 
i ve been trying to persuade george here
of the modern  scientific   
theories of charles darwin 
the theory of evolution 
the notion that all mankind
is descended from the ape 
he does not subscribe 
  is that so 
  i do not 
i ve ordered general armistead to stop
filling his head with heathen blasphemies 
now  you are to devote
your reflective moments to study   
in the matters of military significance 
ordered me 
or perhaps appropriating
some more of this fine whiskey here 
absolutely 
  would you care for 
  no  thank you 
surely the commanding general
shares my deep feelings of disgust   
at this simian suggestion 
i suppose there s some pretty smart folk
that take darwin for the gospel 
they would not be invited to join
george s ever shrinking circle of friends 
general longstreet  sir 
i intend to lay this matter to rest
for once and for all time 
good 
perhaps there are those among you who
think that you are descended from an ape 
i suppose it s possible
there are those of you   
who believe that i m descended
from an ape  but   
i challenge the man to step forward   
who believes that general lee
is descended from an ape 
  here  here 
  not likely 
all science trembles before
the searing logic of your fiery intellect 
so  exactly how many of your relatives
are there that are apes 
what do you hear about sam hood 
he may lose an arm 
dick garnett isn t fit  can t hardly walk 
thing is  if there s a fight 
he can t stand to stay out of it 
but if you ordered him to stay out   
i don t suppose you could do that 
that boy can sing 
that s  kathleen mavourneen  
what do you hear about hancock 
ran into him today 
he s out there about a mile or so 
just a mile or so  and he was tough 
very tough today 
he s the best they got 
god don t make them any better 
and that s a fact 
i d like to go over to see him
as soon as i can 
the last time i saw winn   
he played that song  that very song 
back in california 
we were all together for the last time 
before we broke up 
spring of 1861 
myra hancock 
do you remember myra  hancock s wife 
beautiful woman 
most perfect woman i ever saw 
they were a beautiful couple 
beautiful 
garnett was with me that night 
a lot of fellows from the old outfit 
people standing around singing   
in the blue uniform 
we were leaving the next day 
some going north  some going south 
splitting up 
a soldier s farewell 
 goodbye  good luck 
 i ll see you in hell  
do you remember that 
towards the end of the evening   
we all sat around the piano 
and myra played   
that song there 
that was the one she played 
maybe for years  maybe forever   
i ll never forget that 
you know how it was  pete 
winn was like a brother to me 
remember 
towards the end of the evening   
things got a little rough 
we all began to   
there were a lot of tears 
i went over to hancock 
i took him by the shoulder  i said 
 so help me   
 if i ever raise my hand against you   
 may god strike me dead  
i haven t seen him since 
he was at malvern hill   
white oak swamp 
sharpsburg  fredericksburg 
one of these days
i will see him  i m afraid 
across that   
small deadly space 
i thought about sitting this one out 
but i can t do that 
that wouldn t be right either 
i guess not 
thank you  peter 
i had to talk about that 
i m sending myra hancock   
a small package to be opened   
in the event of my death 
you ll drop by and see her   
after this is over 
won t you  pete 
thank you 
what day is it now  major 
it s long after midnight  sir 
it s already friday 
  friday  july 3 
  yes  sir 
then tomorrow is the fourth of july 
independence day 
  i d quite forgotten 
  the good lord has a sense of humor 
i m very sorry to keep you up so late 
it is my pleasure 
we should have a larger staff 
i d be offended  sir 
i can do the work 
very well 
general stuart is waiting to see you  sir 
  shall i bring him in 
  of course 
  major 
  yes  sir 
general stuart and i
must not be disturbed 
  very well  sir 
  thank you 
general lee will see you now  sir 
you wish to see me  sir 
it is the opinion of some excellent officers
that you have let us all down 
sir  if you will please tell me
who these gentlemen are 
there will be none of that 
there is no time 
i ask that i be allowed to defend my   
there is no time 
general stuart 
your mission was to free this army   
from the enemy cavalry 
and to report any movement
by the enemy s main body 
that mission was not fulfilled 
you left here   
with no word of your movement
or movement of the enemy for days 
meanwhile we were engaged
and drawn into battle   
without adequate knowledge
of the enemy s strength or position 
without knowledge of the ground 
so it is only by god s grace
that we did not meet disaster here 
general lee  there were reasons 
perhaps you misunderstood my orders 
perhaps i did not make myself clear 
well  sir  this must be made very clear 
you  sir   
with your cavalry 
are the eyes of this army 
without your cavalry  we are made blind 
that has already happened once 
it must never  never happen again 
  since i no longer hold the general s   
  i told you there is no time for that 
there is no time 
there is another fight coming tomorrow
and we need you 
we need every man  god knows 
you must take what i have told you   
and learn from it as a man does 
there has been a mistake 
it will not happen again 
i know your quality 
you are one of the finest
cavalry officers i have ever known   
and your service to this army
has been invaluable 
let us speak no more of this 
the matter is concluded 
goodnight  general 
colonel  sir 
what are you doing up here 
i m just resting my leg 
all right 
you sure can see a ways from here 
where have you been 
we sent out a detail   
and found some more departed souls
down there   
and they were carrying coffee
for which they had no more use for 
you re a ghoul 
you did real good yesterday 
the way them rebs just kept coming 
you had to admire them 
you think they ll come again today 
it don t look like they re planning to leave 
we don t have but 100 men 
even with the whole flock
from the second maine 
this position s good 
diversion 
go alert the pickets 
that may be a diversion 
they may be coming this way again 
where s the ammunition i asked for 
go check the hospital  see about the boys 
check on buster 
very well  sir 
we need another runner 
i keep going up and down this hill 
my legs are going to fall off 
  good morning  general 
  good morning  sir 
  ride with me  if you will 
  yes  sir 
general longstreet  you have
general pickett now and he is fresh 
i want you to bring your corps forward 
take those heights in the center
and split the federal line 
my two divisions  hood s and mclaws    
they executed a forced march yesterday
and went straight into the fight 
lost half of their strength 
sustained 50  casualties  sir 
they are tired and need rest 
there are   
now three federal corps on those two
rocky hills on our right flank 
if i move all my people forward   
we won t have a flank at all 
they ll simply swing around and crush us 
they are well entrenched up there 
they aim to fight 
they got good artillery and plenty of it 
sir  any attack we make
will be uphill over open ground 
how do we communicate 
how do we coordinate attack 
they re all massed together 
damned near in a circle 
good interior lines 
anywhere we hit them 
they ll bring up reinforcements in minutes 
but we try to bring up support 
it has to come from miles away 
their cannon will see every move 
hell  their cannon are looking down
on us right now 
in the center  they will break 
they will break in the center 
they ll be gaining men from all directions 
guns by the thousands   
and richmond has nothing left
to send us  so  if we stay  we fight 
if we retreat now 
we will have fought here for two days   
and will leave knowing
we could not drive him off 
and i have never yet left the enemy
in command of the field  no  sir 
retreat is no longer an option 
the enemy has been attacked
on both wings 
he has reinforced there   
and is strongest there on the wings 
the hills and the rocks 
so the weak point is in the center 
they have command of the high ground 
but in that long slope  you see there 
the long slope in the center 
there s where he s most vulnerable 
general pickett s virginians
are the only people not yet engaged  yes 
with general longstreet in command 
my old warhorse   
meeting the enemy face to face
on ground of his choosing   
and with honor  we will prevail 
sir  a courier from colonel rice 
colonel chamberlain 
that s some climb  sir 
my men need rations  lieutenant 
colonel rice has entrusted me to tell you
that you re relieved  sir 
relieved 
fresh troops are on their way up
and they ll take over here  sir 
colonel rice wants to give
your people a rest 
he wants you to fall back 
and i m to show you the way 
fall back 
ellis  have the men fall in 
we re moving out 
yes  sir 
where are we going 
lovely spot 
very quiet  safest place on the battlefield 
right smack dab in the center 
yes  sir  general 
we will attack the center 
but i think you are right about the flank 
hood and mclaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday 
i ll give you two other divisions 
general pettigrew and general trimble 
they are stronger and rested 
now  you will have nearly three divisions
at your command  including pickett 
your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder 
the attack will be preceded
by massed artillery 
we ll concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area 
a  feu d enfer   as napoleon would call it 
when the artillery has had its effect 
your charge will break the line 
you will have nearly 15 000 men
at your command  general 
you may begin whenever you re ready 
but plan it well 
do plan it well  i pray you  sir 
we stake everything on this 
with your permission 
sir  i ve been a soldier all my life 
i have served from the ranks on up 
you know my service 
i must tell you now 
i believe this attack will fail 
no 15 000 men ever made
can take that ridge 
it s a distance of more than a mile
over open ground 
when the men come out of the trees
they will be   
under fire of yankee artillery
from all over the field 
those are hancock s boys 
and now they have the stone wall
like we did at fredericksburg 
we do our duty  general 
we do what we must do 
yes  sir 
colonel alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good 
we will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there 
and the men will know what to do 
all 15 000   
will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line  that lower ridge there 
the line is not strong there 
general meade has great strength
on both flanks 
he must be weak in the center 
i estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5 000 men 
and colonel alexander s artillery
will break them up like at fredericksburg 
  yes  sir 
  farewell 
what are you thinking  general 
pickett s division is from my corps 
but the other two units
are of a p  hill s corps 
shouldn t general hill lead the attack 
say again 
shouldn t general hill lead the attack 
my apologies  sir
