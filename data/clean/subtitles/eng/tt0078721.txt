   that life begins at 40 
i spent the last   
   2 years   
   realizing they d been
lying in their teeth 
i don t know  i think the last 2 years
have been rather good

oh  invalided

  i m going home 
  right 
how s sam 
oh  sam s great 
sam s mostly always great 
can i have my jacket  please 
that sounds mostly intellectual 
not emotional 
i guess so 
i guess she d be happier
if things were more emotional 
  i guess so would you 
  ho ho ho 
for a man who s
never been analyzed   
i d analyze you better
than that expensive shrink 
but you d come out gay
and i couldn t do that to sam 
  here you go 
  thanks 
  i ll give her your love 
  no  give her yours 
he s no more than a man
nothing special that you d run to see
he s a child to be sure
at times insecure
but he pleases me
for when i m in his arms
and the last little star slowly dies
i m enchanted to be
the me that i see in his eyes
he s a man  nothing more
sort of clumsy and absent of mind
not the kind of a beau
i dreamed long ago
that i would find
he s my lover  my friend
what more could i ask him to be 
so in our little plot
the mystery is what he sees in me
why is it i never doubt him
when i ve known all along
now and then
the very best of men must roam
sure  i get lonely without him
but a man  right or wrong
the more you bind him
the less you find him home
he s no more than a man
just a weaver of wishes and dreams
very shy  insecure
he s a child   
oh  shit 
  hi 
  hi 
  are you hurt 
  no 
would you mind stepping out 
  do you have a license 
  yeah 
thank you 
did you know
your license had expired

  july 26 
oh  no 
yeah  uh   
do you have a registration 
  for the car 
  um   
yeah  sure 
expired license  no registration   
   and reckless driving 
i think you ll need a lawyer to help you
with this one  mr  webber 
yeah 
  see if you can get this thing started 
  yeah  thank you 
go on  move it 
marriage is a sacred commitment   
   designed on earth 
sanctified in heaven 
consider these two rings 
perfect circles   
   without beginning  without end   
   signifying god s eternal love
and devotion 
where would we be without god s love 
one of the most glorious
of god s institutions   
   is the institution of marriage 
a union of two souls
swearing allegiance   
   and promising in god s name
to obey one another   
   until death do them part 
in today s world   
   it does well to consider
such a commitment 
for in the final analysis 
on the day of reckoning   
   we shall all be held to account 
the time has come
for david and jenny   
   to make this commitment
to one another 
do you  david  take jennifer   
   as your lawful wedded wife   
   to have and to hold   
   in sickness and in health   
   from this day forward
till death do you part 
ahh  shit 
hello 
hi 
  whose car 
  what 
  whose car 
  it s a loaner 
  jesus  george 
  don t look 
what have you done
to your nose 
a bee flew in the car 
my god  you re lucky
you didn t have a wreck 
  i did have a wreck  i hit a police car 
  a police car 
yes  and not just a police car 
a beverly hills police car 
  my god  does it hurt 
  you bet your knickers it hurts 
have you taken anything for it 
four of your birth control pills 
i hope that s all right 
try an antihistamine 
i don t like those 
they make me pregnant 
i ll start dinner 
thank god for that 
okay  what s up 
what do you mean 
i ve been getting
strange vibrations 
probably just a temporary   
   malfunction of my
biorhythms  dear 
maybe you are allergic 
that bee sting s awfully close
to your frontal lobes 
sit down  you ll just
screw things up in the kitchen 
  go play the piano 
  i want to do my share 
  you shall  darling  later 
  ohh  yeah 
unbelievable 
un fucking believable 
  does that guy have a telescope too 
  yeah 
  see anything interesting 
  oh  yeah 
hi  sam 
shit  she did it again 
the latest hike in opec oil   
that son of a bitch
has a bigger telescope than we have 
not  we  have   you  have 
i don t peep into somebody
else s windows to get my jollies 
you and your friend
are dirty old men 
he s not my friend 
he should be 
you know him intimately now 
i don t watch him  i watch his broads 
he s got a hell of a stable 
he must be good in the sack 
what s that got to do with it 
unless he has a new
remote control screwing device   
   how can you keep
from watching him too 
i concentrate on the broads 
  he s around  isn t he 
  why are you so het up 
you got the time or you want
to wait till after the late show 
first  i m getting a little fed up   
   at sexually emancipated ladies
being referred to as  broads  
second   
   i think a telescope aimed
at anything other than stars   
   is an invasion of privacy and
qualifies the voyeur as a peeping tom 
and there s a very good law
against that 
third  the first two
wouldn t bother me a bit   
   if you d stop watching
so much television   
   and pay attention
to your bedroom guests 
this guest  in particular 
now  you want to argue
or you want to make love 
define  broad  
  your definition or mine 
  i know yours 
a girl who screws around a lot 
  a hooker 
  a hooker s a hooker 
their spreading their legs
doesn t make the terms interchangeable 
  what s the difference 
  a hooker sells it 
so does a broad 
a hooker makes the price going in 
ahh  so by definition a broad
is less virtuous than a hooker 
as far as i m concerned 
virtue has nothing to do with it 
as far as you or any man is concerned 
virtue has everything to do with it 
listen  i just said  broad  
you applied a disparaging connotation
to the term 
come on  are you trying to tell me   
   that  broad  is not a term
used by men   
     to describe women disparagingly 
  i m just saying i didn t use it that way 
  would you call me a broad 
  that depends 
on whether you watched me
through a telescope   
   while i fooled around
with your degenerate neighbor 
okay  you define it 
first and foremost  i don t equate
the term exclusively with sex   
   voyeurism or  quote 
 degeneracy  
  you do that 
  so do you  but you won t admit it 
 broad  to me is just another
colloquial term for  woman  
like  dame    skirt    
   moll  
   crumpet    moll  
i m sure dillinger never used
that word derogatorily 
for authority on female aggrandizement
consult the fbi s 10 most wanted list 
let s look it up 
i want your definition  not webster s 
i m going to get
monsieur roget s definition 
you know my definition 
 broad  means woman  not good 
not bad  unless so designated 
you said a broad does it for money 
you said a hooker sells it 
i said so does a broad 
if a broad is a woman 
then women screw for money 
  some women 
  broads 
some broads do it for other things 
but in a way  they sell it 
here we are 
 woman   dame  hen  petticoat  
 slang or derogatory  jane  broad  
look   slang  derogatory  broad  
okay  how about that  smartass 
you want to look up  derogatory  
george   
don t be a shitheel 
whatever monsieur roget s
d√©finition was   
   i was not using the term
in a derogatory fashion 
some of my oldest and
dearest friends are broads 
  including your mother 
  you bet 
i want a broad   
my maternal grandmother was one
of the greatest broads that ever lived 
they don t make  broads 
like that anymore 
  you know what s wrong with you 
  male chauvinist pig 
besides that 
you re gutless  you re afraid to admit
you blew it  and lose like a man 
i wouldn t mind losing
like a man   
   if you weren t so damned
determined to win like one 
oh  christ 
i ve got an early call 
um    care to translate that 
yup  it s getting late 
i think i d better go 
from hollywood  the tonight show   
   starring johnny carson

along with doc severinsen

inviting you

does he do anything except
swim and jog on the beach 
oh  yes 
he makes me happy  so i let him
swim and jog on the beach 
the more you do for him 
the more he rubs your nose in it 
speaking of noses  why don t you keep
yours out of my personal affairs 
in return  i won t bring up that you ve
acted like a spoiled child all morning 
i m going to the market 
anybody want anything 
no  but bring back the receipts 
george thinks you
take advantage of me 
is that so 
well  i suppose i do 
but then  nobody s perfect 
oh  george is 
what a drag 
hugh  sometimes you really are
a pain in the ass fag 
coming from one of the great
anglo saxon heterosexual   
   bores of all time 
that s the ultimate compliment 
you ve brooded and sulked
around my house all morning   
   without the good manners to explain
or apologize  and i m fed up 
so you know what i ll do 
i ll call it a day 
i ll invite some company over
to soak up the strain 
some happy  conversational   
   intellectually stimulating 
pleasant company 
the malibu chapter
of the sugar plum fairies 
as you don t qualify  you understand
why i don t ask you to stay 
i couldn t  i forgot my tutu 
yeah  see you later  butch 
  i won t be long 
  don t be 
what does that mean 
it means go to the store
and come back 
don t hang around
with your friends at the beach 
don t get heavy with me 
i ll be back when i m ready 
what were your thoughts
at the moment of this fixation 
that she was the most beautiful girl
i had ever seen 
uh  on a scale from 1 to 10 
11 
you said there was
no such thing as a 10 
there s nothing unusual 
i was sitting at the stop sign 
i wasn t thinking anything special 
suddenly there she was 
and i reacted 
i mean  i wasn t expecting
to see that vision 
what about the young girls
on the beach  and larry 
i don t like   
   middle age 
i mean  it s not that complicated 
i d just rather be 30 
or 20  even 
god  if to make it  i had to
change places with larry   
   and a life of faggotry   
   i d sure as hell
give it consideration 
you don t consider that significant 
i m just using an extreme example
to make a point 
if you could  wouldn t you
change places with larry 
but i can t 
didn t you ever
play games like that 
but not to the point
where i got all hung up with it 
you re becoming obsessed
with the ugliness of old age 
the fear of death 
the inevitability of it 
you d change places
with a homosexual to put it off 
so what do you do 
you play it safe 
you get a fixation
on a beautiful young girl 
a  vision   i think
was your description 
and i suspect 
for your total vision   
   a virgin 
yes 
um  excuse me  reverend 
i was just driving by your church   
   and  uh  a thought struck me 
if it wouldn t be an imposition   
   and you could spare a few minutes 
i d be eternally grateful 
by george 
aren t you george    
  webber 
  of course 
george webber 
my goodness 
well  come on in  george 
  thank you 
  how wonderful 
you know  george 
i m a songwriter too 
when you are near
though we re under a cloud
why do i hear
rainbows that shine out loud
why is there music
when i m kissing your glove
could it be
that i have an ear for love
why  when you smile
do those bells ding a ling
turning my heart
into a thumping thing
glee clubs of moonbeams
sing your name in the blue
when i hold you near
my love
look into my ear
my love
you ll see that what i say i hear
my love
is true
well 
well   
now  george  you must be
absolutely frank with me 
yes  well  frankly  i   
  i m stunned 
  do you think it s professional 
i think it s amazing 
you realize  i ve loved music all my life 
excuse us  mrs  kissel 
loved it all my life 
of course  i made a choice 
i m not dissatisfied 
i took the right road 
  i think you did 
  but the music  you know 
  always there  right 
  oh  yes  yes 
sometimes  though 
it gets to be almost too much 
i feel like chucking everything 
and just write  write 
yes  well  i think you should
stick with it  reverend 
you really did like it 
no  he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart   
   who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity   
yes  yes  quite 
all right 
mrs  kissel  we ll take care of it 
  she s been with me for ages 
  yes 
it s all right 
you go on back to the kitchen now 
no damage done 
how old is she 
i honestly don t know 
i don t think she does 
whenever mrs  kissel breaks wind 
we beat the dog 
i mean  the whole depersonalized lifestyle
that puts down anything traditional   
   and completely ignores many of our   
   socially most fundamental institutions 
such as marriage  for instance 
right on  george  heh heh heh 
i think i m fairly well
psychologically oriented 
i ve talked to psychologists 
psychiatrists   
   welfare workers   
but when i drove by your church
today  i thought   god 
goodness   
   who better than somebody
who truly represents   
   the institution of marriage
and all it stands for  
i d be more than happy to help 
that s really marvelous 
well  for instance 
compared to  say  5 or 10   
you may not believe it   
   but just as many young people
are marrying today   
     as they were 10 years ago 
  really 
of course  there s a difference 
it fits right in
with this depersonalized concept 
so many don t seem able to relate
to the true meaning of the ceremony 
mm  can you be more specific 
have you married any young people lately 
yesterday i married
jennifer miles and david hanley 
perhaps you might know
the bride s father  dr  miles 
he s a very prominent
beverly hills dentist 
no  no

  well   
  i don t want to  you know 
he s more trouble than any man
i ve ever known  including my ex husband 
apart from being uncommonly bright 
wonderfully witty   
   generous  occasionally lovable
and a genius   
   i can t think of a single thing 
  how about unnaturally belligerent 
  oh  yes 
  exhaustingly childish 
  uh huh  yeah 
we ve nothing in common 
we re the original odd couple

   i can t ask him to step outside
because he s too small 
i hope he s gone for good 
well  he hasn t 
  he s going through male menopause 
  come on 
all right 
ladies have a biological edge   
   but most males over 40 make up for it
in the emotional department 
he s gone  i don t know where he is 
nothing has happened to him 
nothing sinister  that is 
it ll take him a while to find out
he s a certified imbecile 
he ll come home  tail between his legs
and settle down for good 
lest ye judge harshly  remember   
  nobody s perfect 
  thank god 
anyway  i d still like to punch him
right in the mouth

i like to listen to rock 
i like to dance to jazz 
what do you do to prokofiev 
fuck 
and not only prokofiev  ravel 
did you ever do it to ravel s  bolero  
no 
my uncle turned me on to it 
my stepmother s younger brother 
i spent weekends at his house 
i was at school in england 
uncle fred said  bolero  was the
most descriptive sex music ever written 
and he proved it 
george 
i forgot the joint 
what  now 
oh  god  you beautiful thing 
better hurry or you ll have to start it again 
the music 
you ll have to start it again

why the hell get married 
i got married because i wanted to 
a week later you have an affair with
the man who saved your husband s life 
  oh  wow

 oh  wow  
i don t understand that thinking 
well  evidently not 
five minutes ago
you weren t worried about him 
  oh  boy 
  or whether i was married 
the hell i wasn t 
how do you act
when you re not worried 
i thought maybe you thought
i was more than just a casual lay 
why d you think that 
oh  great  thank you  terrific 
because i thought you were something
different  something special 
i am  as far as i m concerned 
i m very special 
if i sleep with someone 
it s because i want to 
  mm hm 
  i enjoy it  it pleases me 
jolly good 
it s okay if your husband does it 
if it makes him happy 
nothing wrong with being happy   
   but there s more to life than
screwing to ravel s  bolero  
sure there is 
but what s wrong with screwing
to ravel s  bolero  
it depends why you re doing it
and with whom you re doing it   
   with 
if i thought that much  i d be a virgin 
oh  look  jenny 
george  are you happy 
let me see

  i did  was it worth it 
as a matter of fact  it was 
one of your better lyrics 
i was inspired by
one of your better melodies 
you don t sound happy 
i ve always gone on
the premise that   
   to be happy 
you have to feel happy 
how s larry 
he s traveling abroad 
i got a telegram saying
he might come back 
but due to some   
   foolish pride 
i don t think i ll take him back 
have you seen sam 
she s going out to dinner
with bernie kaufman 
don t do as i do  do as i say 
kill if you must  but don t lose her 
  i ll see you tomorrow 
  all right 
it s easy to say
it s over
it s easy
to say
we re the best of friends
you walk away and for a while
you try the summer
of a younger smile
but the memory never ends
you could lose your mind
but then you ll find
it s easy to say
i love you
there s only one way to say
i love you
you could search the years away
that old clich√©
is the first of may
too old   
   for new love
it s easy to say
it s easy
as a  b  c
i love you
love you
love you
that is pretty 
yeah  thank you 
i was going to call it 
 i love you  samantha    
   but some old hack
got there before me 
it s the thought that counts 
yeah 
  sam 
  hm 
do you want to get married 
no 
why not 
just as a matter of interest 
we spend too much time
arguing and not enough making love 
i could work on that 
you know  just reverse that trend 
make a lot of love 
and just that much arguing 
  as easy as that 
  you ve got it 
it would make a difference 
so you ll think about it 
  unless you want to argue 
  oh  no 
i want to make a cup of coffee 
and think about it 
  any action 
  ehh 
she s in the kitchen
