thanks
ill give her your love
no give her yours
hes no more than a man
nothing special that youd run to see
hes a child to be sure
at times insecure
but he pleases me
for when im in his arms
and the last little star slowly dies
im enchanted to be
the me that i see in his eyes
hes a man nothing more
sort of clumsy and absent of mind
not the kind of a beau
i dreamed long ago
that i would find
hes my lover my friend
what more could i ask him to be
so in our little plot
the mystery is what he sees in me
why is it i never doubt him
when ive known all along
now and then
the very best of men must roam
sure i get lonely without him
but a man right or wrong
the more you bind him
the less you find him home
hes no more than a man
just a weaver of wishes and dreams
very shy insecure
hes a child
oh shit
hi
hi
are you hurt
no
would you mind stepping out
do you have a license

with this one mr webber
yeah
see if you can get this thing started
yeah thank you
go on move it
marriage is a sacred commitment
designed on earth
sanctified in heaven
consider these two rings
perfect circles
without beginning without end
signifying gods eternal love
and devotion
where would we be without gods love
one of the most glorious
of gods institutions
is the institution of marriage
a union of two souls
swearing allegiance
and promising in gods name
to obey one another
until death do them part
in todays world
it does well to consider
such a commitment
for in the final analysis
on the day of reckoning
we shall all be held to account
the time has come
for david and jenny
to make this commitment
to one another
do you david take jennifer
as your lawful wedded wife
to have and to hold
in sickness and in health
from this day forward
till death do you part
ahh shit
hello
hi
whose car
what
whose car
its a loaner
jesus george
dont look
what have you done
to your nose
a bee flew in the car
my god youre lucky
you didnt have a wreck
i did have a wreck i hit a police car
a police car
yes and not just a police car
a beverly hills police car
my god does it hurt
you bet your knickers it hurts
have you taken anything for it
four of your birth control pills
i hope thats all right
try an antihistamine
i dont like those
they make me pregnant
ill start dinner
thank god for that
okay whats up
what do you mean
ive been getting
strange vibrations
probably just a temporary
malfunction of my
biorhythms dear
maybe you are allergic
that bee stings awfully close
to your frontal lobes
sit down youll just
screw things up in the kitchen
go play the piano
i want to do my share
you shall darling later
ohh yeah
unbelievable
unfuckingbelievable
does that guy have a telescope too
yeah
see anything interesting
oh yeah
hi sam
shit she did it again
the latest hike in opec oil
that son of a bitch
has a bigger telescope than we have
not we have you have
i dont peep into somebody
elses windows to get my jollies
you and your friend
are dirty old men
hes not my friend
he should be
you know him intimately now
i dont watch him i watch his broads
hes got a hell of a stable
he must be good in the sack
whats that got to do with it
unless he has a new
remote control screwing device
how can you keep
from watching him too
i concentrate on the broads
hes around isnt he
why are you so het up
you got the time or you want
to wait till after the late show
first im getting a little fed up
at sexually emancipated ladies
being referred to as broads
second
i think a telescope aimed
at anything other than stars
is an invasion of privacy and
qualifies the voyeur as a peeping tom
and theres a very good law
against that
third the first two
wouldnt bother me a bit
if youd stop watching
so much television
and pay attention
to your bedroom guests
this guest in particular
now you want to argue
or you want to make love
define broad
your definition or mine
i know yours
a girl who screws around a lot
a hooker
a hookers a hooker
their spreading their legs
doesnt make the terms interchangeable
whats the difference
a hooker sells it
so does a broad
a hooker makes the price going in
ahh so by definition a broad
is less virtuous than a hooker
as far as im concerned
virtue has nothing to do with it
as far as you or any man is concerned
virtue has everything to do with it
listen i just said broad
you applied a disparaging connotation
to the term
come on are you trying to tell me
that broad is not a term
used by men
to describe women disparagingly
im just saying i didnt use it that way
would you call me a broad
that depends
on whether you watched me
through a telescope
while i fooled around
with your degenerate neighbor
okay you define it
first and foremost i dont equate
the term exclusively with sex
voyeurism or quote
degeneracy
you do that
so do you but you wont admit it
broad to me is just another
colloquial term for woman
like dame skirt
moll
crumpet moll
im sure dillinger never used
that word derogatorily
for authority on female aggrandizement
consult the fbis 10 most wanted list
lets look it up
i want your definition not websters
im going to get
monsieur rogets definition
you know my definition
broad means woman not good
not bad unless so designated
you said a broad does it for money
you said a hooker sells it
i said so does a broad
if a broad is a woman
then women screw for money
some women
broads
some broads do it for other things
but in a way they sell it
here we are
woman  dame hen petticoat
slang or derogatory jane broad
look slang derogatory broad
okay how about that smartass
you want to look up derogatory
george
dont be a shitheel
whatever monsieur rogets
d√©finition was
i was not using the term
in a derogatory fashion
some of my oldest and
dearest friends are broads
including your mother
you bet
i want a broad
my maternal grandmother was one
of the greatest broads that ever lived
they dont make broads
like that anymore
you know whats wrong with you
male chauvinist pig
besides that
youre gutless youre afraid to admit
you blew it and lose like a man
i wouldnt mind losing
like a man
if you werent so damned
determined to win like one
oh christ
ive got an early call
um care to translate that
yup its getting late
i think id better go
from hollywood the tonight show
starring johnny carson

does he do anything except
swim and jog on the beach
oh yes
he makes me happy so i let him
swim and jog on the beach
the more you do for him
the more he rubs your nose in it
speaking of noses why dont you keep
yours out of my personal affairs
in return i wont bring up that youve
acted like a spoiled child all morning
im going to the market
anybody want anything
no but bring back the receipts
george thinks you
take advantage of me
is that so
well i suppose i do
but then nobodys perfect
oh george is
what a drag
hugh sometimes you really are
a painintheass fag
coming from one of the great
anglosaxon heterosexual
bores of all time
thats the ultimate compliment
youve brooded and sulked
around my house all morning
without the good manners to explain
or apologize and im fed up
so you know what ill do
ill call it a day
ill invite some company over
to soak up the strain
some happy conversational
intellectually stimulating
pleasant company
the malibu chapter
of the sugar plum fairies
as you dont qualify you understand
why i dont ask you to stay
i couldnt i forgot my tutu
yeah see you later butch
i wont be long
dont be
what does that mean
it means go to the store
and come back
dont hang around
with your friends at the beach
dont get heavy with me
ill be back when im ready
what were your thoughts
at the moment of this fixation
that she was the most beautiful girl
i had ever seen
uh on a scale from 1 to 10
you said there was
no such thing as a 10
theres nothing unusual
i was sitting at the stop sign
i wasnt thinking anything special
suddenly there she was
and i reacted
i mean i wasnt expecting
to see that vision
what about the young girls
on the beach and larry
i dont like
middle age
i mean its not that complicated
id just rather be 30
or 20 even
god if to make it i had to
change places with larry
and a life of faggotry
id sure as hell
give it consideration
you dont consider that significant
im just using an extreme example
to make a point
if you could wouldnt you
change places with larry
but i cant
didnt you ever
play games like that
but not to the point
where i got all hung up with it
youre becoming obsessed
with the ugliness of old age
the fear of death
the inevitability of it
youd change places
with a homosexual to put it off
so what do you do
you play it safe
you get a fixation
on a beautiful young girl
a vision i think
was your description
and i suspect
for your total vision
a virgin
yes
um excuse me reverend
i was just driving by your church
and uh a thought struck me
if it wouldnt be an imposition
and you could spare a few minutes
id be eternally grateful
by george
arent you george
webber
of course
george webber
my goodness
well come on in george
thank you
how wonderful
you know george
im a songwriter too
when you are near
though were under a cloud
why do i hear
rainbows that shine out loud
why is there music
when im kissing your glove
could it be
that i have an ear for love
why when you smile
do those bells dingaling
turning my heart
into a thumping thing
glee clubs of moonbeams
sing your name in the blue
when i hold you near
my love
look into my ear
my love
youll see that what i say i hear
my love
is true
well
well
now george you must be
absolutely frank with me
yes well frankly i
im stunned
do you think its professional
i think its amazing
you realize ive loved music all my life
excuse us mrs kissel
loved it all my life
of course i made a choice
im not dissatisfied
i took the right road
i think you did
but the music you know
always there right
oh yes yes
sometimes though
it gets to be almost too much
i feel like chucking everything
and just write write
yes well i think you should
stick with it reverend
you really did like it
no he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity
yes yes quite
all right
mrs kissel well take care of it
shes been with me for ages
yes
its all right
you go on back to the kitchen now
no damage done
how old is she
i honestly dont know
i dont think she does
whenever mrs kissel breaks wind
we beat the dog
i mean the whole depersonalized lifestyle
that puts down anything traditional
and completely ignores many of our
socially most fundamental institutions
such as marriage for instance
right on george hehhehheh
i think im fairly well
psychologically oriented
ive talked to psychologists
psychiatrists
welfare workers
but when i drove by your church
today i thought god
goodness
who better than somebody
who truly represents
the institution of marriage
and all it stands for
id be more than happy to help
thats really marvelous
well for instance
compared to say 5 or 10
you may not believe it
but just as many young people
are marrying today
as they were 10 years ago
really
of course theres a difference
it fits right in
with this depersonalized concept
so many dont seem able to relate
to the true meaning of the ceremony
mm can you be more specific
have you married any young people lately
yesterday i married
jennifer miles and david hanley
perhaps you might know
the brides father dr miles
hes a very prominent
beverly hills dentist

one of your better melodies
you dont sound happy
ive always gone on
the premise that
to be happy
you have to feel happy
hows larry
hes traveling abroad
i got a telegram saying
he might come back

foolish pride
i dont think ill take him back
have you seen sam
shes going out to dinner
with bernie kaufman
dont do as i do do as i say
kill if you must but dont lose her
ill see you tomorrow
all right
its easy to say
its over
its easy
to say
were the best of friends
you walk away and for a while
you try the summer
of a younger smile
but the memory never ends
you could lose your mind
but then youll find
its easy to say
i love you
theres only one way to say
i love you
you could search the years away
that old clich√©
is the first of may
too old
for new love
its easy to say
its easy
as a b c
i love you
love you
love you
that is pretty
yeah thank you
i was going to call it
i love you samantha
but some old hack
got there before me
its the thought that counts
yeah
sam
hm
do you want to get married
no
why not
just as a matter of interest
we spend too much time
arguing and not enough making love
i could work on that
you know just reverse that trend
make a lot of love
and just that much arguing
as easy as that
youve got it
it would make a difference
so youll think about it
unless you want to argue
oh no
i want to make a cup of coffee
and think about it
any action
ehh
shes in the kitchen
hes playing the piano
and ive had it
thats it george
for one year ive been providing
xrated entertainment
and you reciprocate with pg
