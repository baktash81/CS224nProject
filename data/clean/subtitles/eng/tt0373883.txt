michael  what is going on 
answer me 
   in connection
with tonight s brutal murders 
   the myers family 
and was described by police
as manson like in its viciousness 
and more horrific than anything
hollywood could imagine 
judith myers  nude body
was found lying face down
in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway 
apparently she had been stabbed 17 times 
her boyfriend steven haley s body
was found in the kitchen downstairs 
the victim of an apparent vicious beating
with an aluminum baseball bat 
along with myers and haley 
a third victim  ronnie white 
who was found bound to a chair 
white s neck slit wide open
with a kitchen knife
and stabbed numerous times
in the face and chest 
of course we ll have much more
on this horrific story as it develops 
but for now 
three people brutally murdered 
and a 10 year old boy  michael myers 
being held in custody 
i m standing outside
smith s grove sanitarium
where late last night 
10 year old michael myers was transferred
after being found guilty
of first degree murder 
myers  verdict comes
after one of the lengthiest
and most expensive trials
in the state s history 
in attendance during this trial 
dr  samuel loomis 
loomis has now been appointed
by judge masterson
to oversee myers  care
while incarcerated here at smith s grove 
hello  hello  hello 
can you talk in there 
hi  i m michael myers 
okay  okay  that s fine 
that s good  that s good 
okay  we re on 
how are you feeling today 
good 
could i ask you something 
you can ask me
whatever you want 
that s why i m here 
if you have anything on your mind 
feel free   anything 
okay 
why do you talk so funny 
talk so funny 
tell me  michael 
what do you remember about   
that night  halloween 
what do you mean 
like my costume and candy 
so you remember nothing
about the killing 
you remember nothing
about getting a knife 
  i didn t do that 
  oh  okay 
but you were covered in blood 
whose blood was it 
i don t know 
case  michael myers 
to the untrained eye 
there s nothing visually abnormal
with this angelic young boy 
but one must remember not to be fooled
by his calm  unassuming facade 
can i go home today 
no  not today 
tomorrow 
i don t know 
i have to talk to the doctor about that 
  hey  mommy 
  yeah 
is everyone at home okay 
everything s okay at home 
okay 
hey  mikey 
how you doing 
look  you can t let those walls
get you down 
believe me  i know 
i spent a little time behind walls 
i know they can drive you crazy 
you gotta look beyond the walls 
you know 
learn to live inside your head 
hey  there s no walls
that can stop you there 
all right  i gotta get back to work 
now you take it easy  mikey 
look at my mask 
oh  wow  beautiful  yeah 
why is it all black 
 cause it s one of my favorite colors 
well  actually black isn t a color  is it 
it s the absence of color 
in the spectrum of colors 
you go from black 
which is no color 
all the way through to white 
which is every color 
so technically  
not that it really matters  
but black isn t a color 
why did you make it 
i have my secrets 
wait a minute 
i thought we had no secrets 
you and i 
because no one sees me 
yes  they do 
i see you every day 
your mom  she comes every week 
anybody else 
no 
michael has begun to obsess
on the construction
of these primitive masks 
it is the rare occasion
that he will allow himself
to be seen without one of these 
only during the weekly visits
from his mother
does he show brief glimpses of the boy
he once may have been 
do you like my mask 
when did you make this 
just yesterday 
i like the mask because it hides my face 
i don t like you to hide your face 
take it off 
it hides my ugliness 
sweetie  don t say that 
take it off 
you re not ugly 
don t talk like that  okay 
okay 
i miss you so much 
i miss you  too 
michael s so called normal moments
are becoming fewer and fewer 
and i m particularly worried about this 
i believe that these masks have
begun to create a mental sanctuary
in which michael can hide
within himself and from himself 
  deck the halls with boughs of holly 
fa la la la la  la la la la  
fuck you  fuck you all 
  i hate you 
  let it out 
shut the fuck up 
i gotta get out of here 
just let me out 
i hate this world 
  i don t want to be here anymore 
  i know  it s okay 
  i just want to go home 
  it s okay  it s okay 
it s okay 
why can t i just go home 
okay 
okay  okay  okay 
i m afraid you can t go home 
why 
because you ve done terrible things 
come here  come on 
it s okay  it s okay  michael 
michael s downward slide
into this hellish abyss continues 
i fear he s on the verge
of completely shutting down 
i managed to persuade the suits
to let you come outside
and sit out in the garden 
all right  gardens 
hardly a charming place 
but at least there s a bit of greenery 
but please  i mean 
if you don t communicate with me 
how can i help you 
i m here to help you 
i feel an utter failure at the moment 
that i just can t get through to you 
and you know  they re going
to see in my reports
that you re not responding  and  
you know  they may
take me off the case 
i don t know  i hope not 
i need to get out of here 
yes  that s not going to happen
for a while  michael 
michael  take off the mask 
honey  you don t look good 
you have to eat  come on 
  put my mask back on 
  michael 
please put my mask back on 
come on 
let s try to enjoy the day 
 loomis 
the child christened michael myers
has become a sort of ghost 
a mere shape of a human being 
there s nothing left here now 
well  before i go 
i brought you something 
i found it  i thought you might like
to hang it up in your room 
i thought you d like it 
well  i guess i ll see you next week

what happened 
what happened 
what happened there 
hey 
so you don t fucking talk a lot 
do you  max 
goddamn it  we re gonna get
one thing straight 
i don t work for you 
you may have worked here
for many years
and done all manner of things 
and i suppose that s because
you re a hard worker 
most of you people are 
all your women keep
your little bungalows clean 
sweep off the dirt floors  
keep the papooses in order and all  
but i m my own boss  all right

the bum to freak out

of this kid for almost 20 years 
and me and him  
you know what  never mind

don t look at me 
i ll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare  motherfucker 
i ll come in here and fuck this place up
one night  you watch 
i really don t know what else to say  michael 
you haven t said a word for 15 years 
christ  that s a lifetime 
that s nearly twice as long
as my first marriage 
wow 
it s strange  michael 
in a weird way  you ve become like   
   like my best friend 
it just shows you how fucked up my life is 
i ve done all i possibly can for you 
so i m sorry to tell you
that this is going to be my last day 
michael   
i have to move on 
i m sorry 
take care  michael 
take care 
these eyes will deceive you 
they will destroy you 
they will take from you your innocence   
your pride   
and eventually your soul 
these eyes do not see
what you and i see 
behind these eyes
one finds only blackness 
the absence of light 
these are the eyes   
of a psychopath 
michael was created
by a perfect alignment
of interior and exterior factors
gone violently wrong  
a perfect storm  if you will 
thus creating a psychopath
that knows no boundaries   
and has no boundaries 
kendall  i really don t appreciate
being called out of
my favorite watering hole
to come down on
the fuckin  graveyard shift 
if you do me dirt on this one

dr  loomis  i m going
to have to level with you 
i read your book 
i know exactly who you are

please  just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book 
all right 
i first met michael 17 years ago 
when i first met him 
he was a sweet  charming little boy 
but he had nothing inside 
there was something missing  a void 
there was no conscience  no reason 
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death  right or wrong 
yeah  he s come back for her 
and who is her 
he s come back for his baby sister 
i know it in my bones  sheriff 
to do what 
i don t know  sheriff  but
