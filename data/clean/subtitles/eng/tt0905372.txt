seorg and his wife
were having sex one night
when their young son
suddenly enters the room
hang on a sec
we are going in the right direction
olav
what are we looking for
just keep going
a little bit more or else
we will be flagged on the site
okay
continue the joke
the boy gets scared and leaves
running from the room crying
the mother says honey now
what should we do
you know women
the father says
let me handle this
then he leaves
and goes to the childs bedroom
to say he was joking
he opens the door and sees
the small bastard
is lying on top of his grandmother
having sex with her
very animated too rises and falls
up and down
then he looks
for the father and says
whats wrong dad

kate lloyd
yes
do you know who i am
i do
adam told me
a little bit about you as well
he said you specialized
in vertebrate paleontology
primarily yes
and obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice
ive worked on several cold weather digs
good
an old friend of mine
a colleague of oslo
runs a geological research station
in antarctica
48 hours ago his team found something
quite remarkable
really
whatd they find
were flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site
and i need a paleontologist
doctor im sure you can understand that
i need to know a little bit about what
it is im being asked to dig up
there is a structure
a structure
yes
in antarctica
and a specimen
thats all i can tell you
and i guess i dont have any time
to think about this
no im sorry i need
your answer right now
well
im in
great
adam will get you the details
of our departure
right ill see you in the car
yes of course thank you
adam
what the hell is it
you now officially know as much as i do
but ill tell you one thing i
worked for that guy for three years
and ive never seen him this excited
she us
look at this guy
i mean how is that even
humanly possible
i was hoping maybe you could
help me with something
i cant seem to get ahold of a newspaper
three weeks old
and im a man in desperate need
for certain information
carter dont do this to
yourself man
and what information would that be
i want to know how the
cavaliers are going
i dont follow football
its a basketball team
they play basketball
barely
theyre the cavaliers man
sorry i couldnt help you
nah thats all right
listen just so you guys know
whatever yall are doing
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days
yeah whys that
theres a storm moving in
a nasty one
good morning griggs
yeah hes right
and the last place
where you want to be
is cooped up with a dozen
norwegian guys
trust me
base in sight of my 1 oclock
this is h3 sea king inbound to thule
do you copy
hello h3 sea king
please approach from the west
landing pad is cleared
bravo coming back
good to go griggs
dr halvorson
yes
welcome to thule
thank you
edvard asked you to go
to the site right now
lars is going to drive you
hi
hi welcome
please go in the spryte
thanks
hello sir
watch your step
brighten
edvard
you got it
sure i did
yeah this is kate lloyd
columbia paleontology
welcome
adam finch
my research assistant
welcome
hi
this is edvard my good friend
this is some of my team
karl and juliette both geologists
hi
welcome
okay
let me show you why you flew
10000 miles
holy shit
we estimated this has been here
approximately 100000 years
we picked up a signal transmitting
some kind of distress call perhaps
incredible
we think the signal
was triggered
when the survivor
exited the craft
survivor
my god
how long will it take to get it out
do you know kate
assuming youve the right equipment
id say
maybe half a day
good
the ice should i ask you how fragile
is it
its not in a fracture zone
so theres very little risk of fissuring
and the ice is quite dense
so we think we can get it out in one piece
good
i mean rough estimates about 6 by 12 feet
3 and a half feet high
probably some place right around
thats great
make sure that everyone stays off
the radio
i do not want any information out
and the cranedo we have
something appropriate for this
yes its already there
its all set up
im peder by the way
peder
nice to meet you
so youve gotten it all taken care of
i dont think you really need me
what about him
hes secretly disinterested or
oh thats lars
he does not understand english
but he works like a bear
and as you can see from the scans
the ship carved a 200m tunnel into the ice
so let me get this right
you crashed into a glacier
and then without enough information
you leave the cozy confines of your ship
maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
someplace warm
well i guess it didnt find it
the first night is hard
sorry i didnt mean to keep you up
no no its fine
ill never look at them the same again
what do you mean for transport weight
to cut it down to a portable weight we have to
take it from here to here
start with 4 inches
i never believed in this shit
i always did
were all set
nearly there
good
good
but before we do
im going to take a tissue sample
do you really thats a good idea
yes i do
i mean the conditions are so unpredictable
and we dont have the proper equipment
sterilization is an issue
edvard what do you have in the way of
a small diameter drill
up to 30mm
very good
i think somewhere around here
kate
just a second
in the future dont contradict me
in front of those people again
i just thought
youre not here to think
youre here to get that thing safe out of the ice
i hope we understand each other
so have you ever tasted this before
no i havent
it tastes very bad
gentlemen
ladies
after a short but thorough investigation
of our visitor
i can say unequivocally
that ive never seen anything
on any cellular level
like what we have
in that other room
now the impact of this find
will be felt
for thousands of years
from this point on
the world as we know it
has forever been altered
you my friends
will all be immortalized
as the people
who made this discovery
thank you
do you think theyre going to pay a bonus
for bringing over an alien
instead of coal samples
youve got anything better than
this cough syrup
hey griggy
yeah
you want to go out and get the cabinet stash
sure no problem
im on it
where did i put this bottle
jesus ch
screw you man
son of a
it broke out
what
it aint a damn joke man
the freaking things alive
i was in the room man
looking at the ice
then the freaking thing jumped out
we search
in groups of two and three
the entire camp if you find it pull out
dont attempt anything on your own
and be careful
we dont know what condition its in
griggs did you leave that open
i dont remember
shit
hey just be careful man that thing jumped
through the fucking roof
jesus christ
help over here
help somebody over here
it attacked henrik
come on
jesus
in there
god somebody do something
oh my god
shoot it shoot the fucker man
we got to burn that fucker man burn it
throw it throw it
his blood pressures low
henrik andhis small children
yes its horrible its a horrible tragedy
were all shocked at what happened to henrik
but with due respect we need to examine the remains
before it all disintegrates
hey that was a man not remains
no i know im talking about the creature
and im sure were all aware of the importance
of this discovery
this may be the first and only time
mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform
and as scientists were obliged to study it
didnt work out so well the last time did it
i think you should destroy it
completely
i think youve contributed enough to this matter now
oh really
listen your guy olav back there
hes in bad shape
now were going to fly him back to mcmurdo
at sunup and take him to the military hospital
and whatre you going to tell them hmm
im gonna tell them the truth as crazy
as it sounds
kate
can you help here
come on
pull that side up
his face is encased in some type
of amniotic sac
the tissue looks almost new
what was it doing to him
it appears that it was absorbing him
some type of digestion
its fascinating
it is fascinating
whats the matter are you okay
im fine
you sure
yeah im okay
do you need something
no no im okay
what is this
looks like a titanium plate
used to reinforce bones and compound fractures
yeah thats right
henrik broke his arm last year
he had to go to argentina
to get it set
so if this was in his arm
whats it doing out of him now
thats a good question
what are you doing
took a sample of henriks tissue
i want to find out what this thing
was doing to him
i think you should take a look at this
these cells arent dead
thats not possible
looks like the alien cells
are somehow
attacking henriks cells
and then they
what is that it looks like
they are transforming
theyre imitating his cells
okay i dont know if thats what im seeing but
theyre imitating him
its going to be okay olav
a doctor will see you in mcmurdo
kate
hey
hi
were leaving
once the weather holds up well be back with help
as soon as we can
okay
alright
keep him warm
i will
cmon lets go
sit down there
there you go
ah lets get the hell out of here
carter
carter wait
shes flagging us down
whats wrong
they shouldnt leave
carter
lets just get out of here man
alright fuck it were landing
shit
lets take her down
is there something wrong
no everythings fine
probably just forgot something
well be in the air in no time okay
dont worry
hang in there
somethings wrong
hailing mcmurdo or any ears on
the emergency channel
do you copy over
i repeat this is thule station
they crashed here
right behind this ridgeline
its impossible to reach them
this doesnt make any sense
i mean they have plenty of visibility right
were not going after them
shouldnt we try
we need a chopper to even get close to them
and theres refueling and hailing
all this cant be a coincidence
radios dead its fucking dead
the incoming storm
fuck
theres too much interference
we have four missing persons
we have no helicopter or radio
you made a mistake
for bringing these people here
more people may die
but sander we dont know
even if they are dead or not
colin lars get your gear
well take a snowcat
to the next base
lars do it now
i dont think thats a good idea
and why is that
because no one can leave this camp
until we know more about whats going on here
i make decisions about this camp
i know edvard but
why did you flag down that helicopter
because i thought it was in danger
why
i took a sample of henriks blood
and i saw that the alien cells
were still alive
they were alive and they were copying
henriks cells
replicating them
adam saw it too
is that true
i dont know
i mean i dont know what we saw
i mean we saw something
i dont understand
what are you saying
that this thing can
and probably has
replicated a person
what
that cant be
who
this is insane
okay okay kate kate
okay kate
this is not the time to be yelling fire
lets stop gather our thoughts
and discuss this in private
we dont need any private meeting doctor
we all want the fucking information
theres more
what are those
i think they are fillings from someones teeth
i found them by a puddle of blood in the shower
puddle of blood
it can clone cells
but not inorganic material
it couldnt copy these so
it spit them out
were wasting too much time already lars
listen
when i went back to check it
someone had cleaned up the blood
someone had wiped it away
alright so whatever it is
it is still here
ive heard enough
lars colin get the gear
ten minutes
please edvard
you cant leave
you cant leave
you dont know what were dealing with
well done
kate
i dont know if i should be speaking about this
i dont want to get anyone in trouble
speaking about what
you were saying
about someone cleaning up the
blood from the shower
and that someone here may not be themselves
juliette please
what did you see
after the crash i thinki saw
colin coming from the showers
he was holding something
it couldve been a towel a rag
something to clean up
kate i cant say for sure but
its just that i s
hes leaving with edvard
we cant let them go
we cant let any of them go
i know where they keep
the keys for the vehicles
where are they
in that drawer
this one
yes
how many am i looking for
five
three and four
you said there were five
run
kate what happened
karl it got karl it gotkarl
kate
burn it
enough thats enough
burn in hell
what the fucks happening to us
it attacks its prey
copies it perfectly
and then hides inside it
waiting
is it still among us
it could be any of us
we got to get out of here
yeah right now
and it could be getting a vehicle with it
youll be alone
vulnerable
thats exactly what it wants
not to mention youll be giving it
a way out of here
a way to spread
its like a virus
so what do we do with any virus
quarantine
we isolate it and then we kill it
yeah
we have to rely on science
exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
cells of the creature
might create a reactionof some kind
so we take blood samples from everybody
yeah and we test each one of them
yes adam and i can do that
okay
lars and ill disable the vehicles
we have to trust in this plan
its our only chance of making it through this
is that it
yes
no more vehicles
only these
okay
what
grenades
is everything alright
yes yes everythings fine
good
lars youre okay
yes
kate we should go
the storm is getting worse
who is that
hurry up theyre coming
the americans
it is impossible for a human
to survive in that crash
we should burn them
right here right now
lets finish them off
peder
it could be murder
it could be survival kate
yes but we dont have to kill them
right we can just lock them up
until the sanders test is ready
please
please
so this is a good idea
locking us up
you need our help
warn your scientists they cant handle
with what we saw in that chopper
for all i know you could be one of those things
it is pretty hard to believe you both
walked away from that crash
yeah i get that i do but
were preparing a test
and then we figure out whos who
its all i can offer you right now
damn
theres a fire here
someone sabotaged it
theres nothing left nothing
now theres no test
how could this happen
it was no accident
you
you were in there with him
you were the last one
how are you accusing me
why not
hes got something to hide
what are you an asshole
i was the one working on the test
i left for 2 minutes
you just dont want us to know the truth do ya
bullshit
this is a goddamn fucking nightmare
there might be another way
i think there might be another way
to tell
peder give me your flashlight
now tell lars
to open his mouth
tell him to open his mouth
open your mouth
good
lars has fillings
so hes human
it cant imitate
inorganic material
see
yes
good
good
open
come on
youre next
open your mouth
okay
good
right now its at least something
a way to eliminate
some of us
so im gonna get killed because
i floss
nobodys getting killed
kate
kate come on
kate
just do it
kate
open
just go stand over there
you know as well as i do there are
too many variables
open your mouth
open your mouth

or clean teeth
its bloody absurd
this is wrong
jonas you and lars go out
get carter and jameson
bring them in here well check them too
but why dont we just leave them where they are
they cant do anything
we need to know
what
