seorg and his wife
were having sex one night 
when their young son
suddenly enters the room 
hang on a sec 
we are going in the right direction 
olav 
what are we looking for 
just keep going 
a little bit more or else
we will be flagged on the site 
okay 
continue the joke 
the boy gets scared and leaves
running from the room  crying 
the mother says   honey  now 
what should we do   
you know women   
the father says 
 let me handle this  
then he leaves
and goes to the child s bedroom
to say he was joking 
he opens the door and sees
the small bastard
is lying on top of his grandmother 
having sex with her 
very animated too  rises and falls 
up and down 
then he looks
for the father and says 
what s wrong  dad 
you play with mine
so i play with her  right 
stop 
is it here 
it s right here 
don t move 
turn on the light 
good god 
kate

i m dr  sander halvorson 
kate lloyd 
yes 
do you know who i am 
i do 
adam told me
a little bit about you as well 
he said you specialized
in vertebrate paleontology 
primarily  yes 
and obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice 
i ve worked on several cold weather digs 
good 
an old friend of mine 
a colleague of oslo 
runs a geological research station
in antarctica 
48 hours ago  his team found something
quite remarkable 
really 
what d they find 
we re flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site 
and i need a paleontologist 
doctor  i m sure you can understand that
i need to know a little bit about what
it is i m being asked to dig up 
there is a structure 
a structure 
  yes 
  in antarctica 
and a specimen 
that s all i can tell you 
and i guess i don t have any time
to think about this 
no  i m sorry  i need
your answer right now 
well   
i m in 
great 
adam will get you the details
of our departure 
  right  i ll see you in the car 
  yes  of course  thank you 
adam 
what the hell is it 
you now officially know as much as i do 
but i ll tell you one thing  i
worked for that guy for three years
and i ve never seen him this excited 
she us 
look at this guy 
i mean  how is that even
humanly possible 
i was hoping maybe you could
help me with something 
i can t seem to get ahold of a newspaper
three weeks old
and i m a man in desperate need
for certain information 
carter  don t do this to
yourself  man 
and what information would that be 
i want to know how the
cavaliers are going 
i don t follow football 
it s a basketball team 
they play basketball 
barely 
they re the cavaliers  man 
  sorry  i couldn t help you 
  nah  that s all right 
listen  just so you guys know 
whatever y all are doing 
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days 
yeah  why s that 
there s a storm moving in 
a nasty one 
good morning  griggs 
yeah  he s right 
and the last place
where you want to be
is cooped up with a dozen
norwegian guys 
trust me 
base in sight of my 1 o clock 
this is h3 sea king inbound to thule 
do you copy 
hello  h3 sea king 
please  approach from the west 
landing pad is cleared
bravo  coming back 
good to go  griggs 
  dr  halvorson 
  yes 
  welcome to thule 
  thank you 
edvard asked you to go
to the site  right now 
lars is going to drive you 
  hi 
  hi  welcome 
  please go in the spryte  
  thanks 
hello  sir 
watch your step 
brighten 
edvard 
  you got it 
  sure  i did 
yeah  this is kate lloyd 
  columbia paleontology 
  welcome 
adam finch 
my research assistant 
 welcome 
  hi 
this is edvard  my good friend 
this is some of my team 
karl and juliette  both geologists 
  hi 
  welcome 
okay 
let me show you why you flew
10 000 miles 
holy shit 
we estimated this has been here
approximately 100 000 years 
we picked up a signal transmitting 
some kind of distress call  perhaps 
incredible 
we think the signal
was triggered
when the survivor
exited the craft 
survivor 
my god 
how long will it take to get it out 
do you know  kate 
assuming you ve the right equipment 
i d say   
maybe half a day 
good 
the ice  should i ask you how fragile
is it 
it s not in a fracture zone 
so there s very little risk of fissuring 
and the ice is quite dense 
so we think we can get it out in one piece 
good 
i mean  rough estimates about 6 by 12 feet 
3 and a half feet high 
  probably some place right around  
  that s great   
make sure that everyone stays off
the radio 
i do not want any information out 
and the crane   do we have
something appropriate for this 
yes  it s already there 
it s all set up 
i m peder  by the way 
  peder 
  nice to meet you 
so  you ve gotten it all taken care of 
i don t think you really need me 
what about him 
he s secretly disinterested or   
oh  that s lars 
he does not understand english 
but he works like a bear 
and  as you can see from the scans 
the ship carved a 200m tunnel into the ice 
so  let me get this right 
you crashed into a glacier   
and then without enough information
you leave the cozy confines of your ship 
maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
someplace warm 
well  i guess it didn t find it 
the first night is hard 
  sorry  i didn t mean to keep you up 
  no  no  it s fine 
i ll never look at them the same again 
what do you mean for transport weight 
to cut it down to a portable weight  we have to
take it from here to here 
start with 4 inches 
i never believed in this shit 
i always did 
  we re all set 
  nearly there 
good 
good 
but before we do 
i m going to take a tissue sample 
do you really that s a good idea 
yes  i do 
i mean the conditions are so unpredictable
and we don t have the proper equipment 
sterilization is an issue 
edvard  what do you have in the way of
a small diameter drill 
up to 30mm 
very good 
i think somewhere around here 
kate 
just a second 
in the future  don t contradict me
in front of those people again 
  i just thought   
  you re not here to think 
you re here to get that thing safe out of the ice 
i hope we understand each other 
so  have you ever tasted this before 
  no  i haven t 
  it tastes very bad 
gentlemen 
ladies 
after a short but thorough investigation
of our visitor 
i can say  unequivocally 
that i ve never seen anything
on any cellular level 
like what we have
in that other room 
now  the impact of this find
will be felt
for thousands of years 
from this point on 
the world as we know it
has forever been altered 
you  my friends 
will all be immortalized 
as the people
who made this discovery 
thank you 
do you think they re going to pay a bonus
for bringing over an alien
instead of coal samples 
you ve got anything better than
this cough syrup 
  hey  griggy 
  yeah 
you want to go out and get the cabinet stash 
sure  no problem 
i m on it 
where did i put this bottle 
jesus ch   
screw you  man 
son of a   
it broke out 
what 
it ain t a damn joke  man 
the freaking thing s alive 
i was in the room  man 
looking at the ice
then the freaking thing jumped out 
we search
in groups of two and three 
the entire camp  if you find it  pull out 
don t attempt anything on your own 
and be careful   
we don t know what condition it s in 
griggs  did you leave that open 
  i don t remember 
  shit 
hey  just be careful  man  that thing jumped
through the fucking roof 
jesus christ 
help  over here 
help  somebody  over here 
  it attacked henrik 
  come on 
  jesus 
  in there 
  god  somebody do something 
  oh my god 
shoot it  shoot the fucker  man 
we got to burn that fucker  man  burn it 
throw it  throw it 
his blood pressure s low 
henrik and   his small children 
yes  it s horrible  it s a horrible tragedy 
we re all shocked  at what happened to henrik 
but with due respect  we need to examine the remains
before it all disintegrates 
  hey  that was a man  not remains 
  no  i know  i m talking about the creature 
and i m sure we re all aware of the importance
of this discovery 
this may be the first and only time
mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform 
  and as scientists  we re obliged to study it 
  didn t work out so well the last time  did it 
i think you should destroy it 
completely 
  i think you ve contributed enough to this matter now 
  oh  really 
listen  your guy  olav  back there 
he s in bad shape 
now  we re going to fly him back to mcmurdo
at sun up and take him to the military hospital 
and what re you going to tell them  hmm 
i m gonna tell them the truth  as crazy
as it sounds 
kate 
can you help here 
come on 
pull that side up 
his face is encased in some type
of amniotic sac 
the tissue  looks almost new 
what was it doing to him 
it appears that it was absorbing him 
some type of digestion 
it s fascinating 
it is fascinating 
  what s the matter  are you okay 
  i m fine 
  you sure 
  yeah  i m okay 
  do you need something 
  no  no  i m okay 
what is this 
looks like a titanium plate 
used to reinforce bones and compound fractures 
yeah  that s right 
henrik broke his arm last year 
he had to go to argentina
to get it set 
so if this was in his arm 
what s it doing out of him now 
that s a good question 
what are you doing 
took a sample of henrik s tissue 
i want to find out what this thing
was doing to him 
i think you should take a look at this 
these cells aren t dead 
that s not possible 
looks like the alien cells
are somehow
attacking henrik s cells
and then they  
what is that  it looks like
they are transforming   
they re imitating his cells 
okay  i don t know if that s what i m seeing  but   
they re imitating him 
it s going to be okay  olav 
a doctor will see you in mcmurdo 
kate 
  hey 
  hi 
we re leaving 
once the weather holds up  we ll be back with help
as soon as we can 
okay 
alright 
  keep him warm 
  i will 
c mon  let s go 
sit down there 
there you go 
ah  let s get the hell out of here 
carter 
carter  wait 
she s flagging us down 
  what s wrong 
  they shouldn t leave 
carter 
let s just get out of here  man 
alright  fuck it  we re landing 
shit 
let s take her down 
is there something wrong 
no  everything s fine 
probably just forgot something 
we ll be in the air in no time  okay 
don t worry 
hang in there 
something s wrong 
hailing mcmurdo  or any ears on
the emergency channel 
do you copy  over 
i repeat  this is thule station 
they crashed here 
right behind this ridgeline 
it s impossible to reach them 
this doesn t make any sense 
i mean  they have plenty of visibility  right 
we re not going after them 
shouldn t we try 
we need a chopper to even get close to them 
and there s refueling and hailing 
all this can t be a coincidence 
radio s dead  it s fucking dead 
the incoming storm 
fuck 
there s too much interference 
we have four missing persons 
we have no helicopter or radio 
you made a mistake
for bringing these people here 
more people may die 
but  sander  we don t know
even if they are dead or not 
colin  lars  get your gear 
we ll take a snowcat
to the next base 
lars  do it now 
i don t think that s a good idea 
and why is that 
because no one can leave this camp   
until we know more about what s going on here 
  i make decisions about this camp 
  i know  edvard  but   
why did you flag down that helicopter 
because i thought it was in danger 
why 
i took a sample of henrik s blood   
and i saw that the alien cells
were still alive 
they were alive and they were copying
henrik s cells 
replicating them 
adam saw it too 
is that true 
i don t know 
i mean  i don t know what we saw 
i mean  we saw something 
i don t understand 
what are you saying 
that this thing can 
and probably has 
replicated a person 
  what 
  that can t be 
  who 
 this is insane 
okay  okay  kate  kate 
okay  kate 
this is not the time to be yelling fire 
let s stop  gather our thoughts 
and discuss this in private 
we don t need any private meeting  doctor 
we all want the fucking information 
there s more 
what are those 
i think they are fillings from someone s teeth 
i found them by a puddle of blood in the shower 
puddle of blood 
it can clone cells 
but not inorganic material 
it couldn t copy these  so
it spit them out 
  we re wasting too much time already  lars 
  listen 
when i went back to check it 
someone had cleaned up the blood 
someone had wiped it away 
alright  so whatever it is   
it is still here 
i ve heard enough 
lars  colin  get the gear 
ten minutes 
please  edvard 
you can t leave 
you can t leave 
you don t know what we re dealing with 
well done 
kate 
i don t know if i should be speaking about this 
i don t want to get anyone in trouble 
speaking about what 
you were saying   
about someone cleaning up the
blood from the shower 
  and that someone here may not be themselves 
  juliette  please   
what did you see 
after the crash  i think   i saw
colin coming from the showers 
he was holding something 
it could ve been a towel  a rag 
something to clean up 
kate  i can t say for sure  but
it s just that i s  
he s leaving with edvard 
we can t let them go 
we can t let any of them go 
i know where they keep
the keys for the vehicles 
  where are they 
  in that drawer 
  this one 
  yes 
  how many am i looking for 
  five 
three and four 
you said there were five 
run 
kate  what happened 
karl  it got karl  it got   karl 
kate 
burn it 
enough  that s enough 
burn in hell 
what the fuck s happening to us 
it attacks its prey 
copies it perfectly   
and then hides inside it 
waiting 
is it still among us 
it could be any of us 
we got to get out of here 
yeah  right now 
and it could be getting a vehicle with it 
you ll be alone 
vulnerable 
that s exactly what it wants 
not to mention you ll be giving it
a way out of here 
a way to spread 
it s like a virus 
so what do we do with any virus 
quarantine 
we isolate it and then we kill it 
yeah 
we have to rely on science 
exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
cells of the creature
might create a reaction   of some kind 
so we take blood samples from everybody 
yeah  and we test each one of them 
yes  adam and i can do that 
okay 
lars and i ll disable the vehicles 
we have to trust in this plan 
it s our only chance of making it through this 
  is that it 
  yes 
  no more vehicles 
  only these 
okay 
what 
grenades 
is everything alright 
yes  yes  everything s fine 
good 
  lars  you re okay 
  yes 
kate  we should go 
the storm is getting worse 
who is that 
hurry up  they re coming 
the americans 
it is impossible for a human
to survive in that crash 
we should burn them 
right here  right now 
  let s finish them off 
  peder 
it could be murder 
  it could be survival  kate 
  yes  but we don t have to kill them 
right  we can just lock them up   
until the sander s test is ready 
please 
please 
so this is a good idea 
locking us up 
you need our help 
warn your scientists they can t handle
with what we saw in that chopper 
for all i know  you could be one of those things 
it is pretty hard to believe you both
walked away from that crash 
  yeah  i get that  i do  but   
  we re preparing a test 
and then we figure out who s who 
it s all i can offer you right now 
damn 
there s a fire here 
someone sabotaged it 
there s nothing left  nothing 
now there s no test 
how could this happen 
it was no accident 
you 
you were in there with him 
you were the last one 
  how are you accusing me 
  why not 
  he s got something to hide 
  what are you  an asshole 
i was the one working on the test 
i left for 2 minutes 
  you just don t want us to know the truth  do ya 
  bullshit 
this is a goddamn fucking nightmare 
there might be another way 
i think there might be another way
to tell 
peder  give me your flashlight 
now tell lars
to open his mouth 
tell him to open his mouth 
open your mouth 
good 
lars has fillings 
so he s human 
it can t imitate
inorganic material 
see 
yes 
good 
good 
open 
come on 
you re next 
open your mouth 
okay 
good 
right now  it s at least something 
a way to eliminate
some of us 
so i m gonna get killed because
i floss 
nobody s getting killed 
kate 
kate  come on 
kate 
just do it 
kate 
open 
just go stand over there 
you know as well as i do  there are
too many variables 
open your mouth 
open your mouth 
they are porcelain 
go stand with adam 
anyone else with porcelain fillings 
or clean teeth 
it s bloody absurd 
this is wrong 
jonas  you and lars go out 
get carter and jameson 
bring them in here  we ll check them too 
but why don t we just leave them where they are 
they can t do anything 
we need to know 
  what 
  she wants us to find the americans 
let s do it  then 
come on 
she is smart 
yes 
she is in control now 
shit 
they escaped 
lars 
let s go back inside 
no  we have to find them 
lars  be careful 
they are not human 
lars 
lars 
lars 
lars  wait 
lars 
peder 
stay calm 
the threat isn t here 
it s out there 
the americans are the real enemy 
he s right  peder

it doesn t matter 
you can t trust them 
watch them 
kate

  we don t know if we can trust them 
peder  don t listen to them 
stay on them  stay on them  peder 
they re inside 
where is lars 
calm down 
i said calm down

millions of people could die 
  it s got nowhere to go 
  yes  it does 
alright 
what 
what happened to lars

come on 
run  run
