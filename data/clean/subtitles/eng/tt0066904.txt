leaving churchill member house commons
went house commons got car
drove hyde park
middle park saw group french sailors
little red pompoms képis

clearly frances former ally attacks fight back
morning attack
admiral gensoul received english ultimatum
admiral somerville proceeded send several delegations
order explain gensoul options proposed churchill
could join free french allow disarmed
head neutral port german reach
admiral gensoul refused three options
considered dishonourable solutions
didnt dare risk happening
letting boats fall enemy hands
simply couldnt take risk
wasnt also psychological risk
yes considerable risk
allowed germans spread propaganda
vichy lord knows used opportunity
think understood time
little choice matter
sailors
killed british navy
british navy attempted take french navy
clear us time
thought
believed armistice would respected germans
france thought vichy government told us
french navy would never given germans
us fact
brought believe promises kept
couldnt imagine could political dealings
would eventually lead french navy given away
way
viewed brutal attack
also additional moral problem
according many testimonies
sailors whose boats shelled british
believed moment going cast
order join british fleet
thats terrible
felt hope would never attacked
hope
everything said germans
proved bizerta
germans proceeded give french admiral
twenty minutes surrender
surrender boats
pain immediate bombing attack
taken prisoner
predictions came true
knew dealing
shortly events
french whose faith english greatly shaken
made contact us first time general huntziger

allow military collaboration
discussion options
side undoubtedly personal motivations
initiated negotiations
known collaboration
talks beginning
hitler pétain agreed meet montoire
first meeting laval told germanophile
known years
asked put good word hitler
think hitler felt laval sincere
least one aspect spoke collaboration
main issue second meeting

peace treaty like
whereas victors ive often seen
generally dont know whats next answer questions
thats went montoire
hitler didnt know answer pétains questions
boundaries fate prisoners
ended everything air
ah montoire quite story

heard transpired depressing
even cried next day
people crying yes
soon afterwards new slogan became popular
collaboration
give watch ill give time
slogan
collaboration
often said also presence
hadnt yet decided
whether england france pay war
basis race ideology
whatever call point view
many felt much related english french
convinced france hitler saw
could play minor role
national socialist europe
never france anywhere else europe
whatever knowledge derived books
first adapted point view
mind felt decline french people
unavoidable idea confirmed french defeat
travels hitler sometimes shared thoughts others

inevitable type situation
conditions created national socialism
within german structures time
made impossible us respect clauses armistice
