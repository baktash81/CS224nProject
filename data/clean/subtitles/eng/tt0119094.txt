recovered from the jet wreckage 
found in pollux troy s
briefcase 
 music plays 
woman moans with pleasure 
woman  ohh 
sean  porcelain casing 
thermal cloak 
nerve gas
and biological payload 
hollis  it s enough to flatten
a square mile 
then  depending
on the prevailing winds   
the fallout will be
a tad worse   
than gulf war syndrome 
sean 
the biblical plague to l a   
fuck  aah  where is he 
where s pollux troy 
man  why draw the schematic if
you re not gonna build the bomb 
pollux  what  is it a crime
to exercise the mind 
i won t say another word
until i see my brother 
victor  any progress 
i need about 10 minutes
alone with this guy 
you got castor  just go home 
 sighs 
we won t evacuate the city
on your hunch 
look  i know castor too well
for this to be a hunch 
you know what 
just run the goddamn bureau
any way you like 
 sighs 
hollis  i could put
an agent in his cell 
maybe pollux will let it slip 
sean  oh  come on 
he s a paranoid sociopath 
the only person he d talk to
is his brother  and he s dead 
hollis 
there is one other possibility 
 beeping 
oh  god 
you re keeping him alive 
hollis  relax  archer 
he s a turnip 
 sean groaning 
what if you could walk
into erewhon prison   
and give pollux
a nice big brotherly hug   
as castor troy 
i have no idea
what you re talking about 
malcolm  let me try 
malcolm walsh 
i run the bio cover unit
for special ops 
 i know who you are 
 but not what i can do 
physical alteration 
augmentation 
hollis  dr  walsh
can alter the likeness   
even the voice
of a government witness 
malcolm  i think you ll
recognize this patient 
we had to build
your friend loomis   
a whole new ear from scratch 
what we re suggesting for you
isn t a permanent transplant 
just a temporary trade 
come here 
with new anti inflammatories 
healing takes days  not weeks 
your blood types won t match 
but pollux won t know that 
height difference is negligible 
skin pigment  eye pigment 
both almost identical 
we ll use laser shears
for the hairline   
microplugs for body hair 
we ll do an abdominoplasty   
take care of those  uh 
love handles 
but all that s the easy part 
here s the real science 
this is a state of the art
morphogenetic template 
the inside is modeled
on your skull   
the outside exactly like troy s 
then we fit his face on top 
not a replica 
but the real thing 
then we simply connect   
the muscles  tear ducts 
and nerve endings   
sean  so you want to take
his face and mine  
hollis  borrow 
the procedure s
completely reversible 
sean  you think
that i want to do this 
no  no 
there s no one else  sean 
you have lived and breathed
castor troy for years 
i ll get his gang to talk 
that s what i do 
what if you can t 
the bomb will blow 
and castor troy will win 
sean  get out 
go ahead  wipe your ass 
tito  damn 
what the hell is that smell 
he shit in his pants 
where s dietrich 
sean  hello  sasha 
when was the last time
you saw castor troy 
 who cares  he s dead 
 answer the question 
i know my rights 
i don t have to answer shit 
you re right  but know this 
you re a convicted felon   
on probation
for harboring castor troy 
one phone call from me   
and your son will end up
in a foster home 
i understand why you would use
such a threat   
but you try to take him
away from me   
i swear to you   
i haven t seen him for years 
 sighs 
sean  this reeks of you 
it s got your signature
all over it 
dietrich  maybe  but you
ain t got nothin  on me   
and you know it 
maybe so  but i can keep you
within city limits   
or i can talk
to your sister again 
she s right outside 
only this time i ll be nice 
hey  sean   
how s your dead son 
aah 
i don t know any  
ok  something about the 18th 
but that s all i know 
tito  great  so we got a date 
where the hell s the damn bomb 
only pollux troy ll know that 
it s your call  sean 
sean 
does lazarro know your plan 
hollis  no 
this is a black bag operation 
strictly off the books 
you can t tell lazarro 
and you can t tell your wife 
oh  god 
what are you asking me to do 
ok  let s see 
you re asking me
to break the law   
risk my neck   
and you re asking me
to put in the dark   
all the people
that love me and trust me 
i ll do it 
eve  sean 
sorry i woke you 
i m glad it s you
that woke me   
and not a phone call   
telling me
you won t be coming home 
but that s a fear
i can finally let go of  huh 
it s all right  sean  it s ok 
i keep   
i keep wanting to move this   
over here  you know 
if it had only been an inch
to the left   
mikey d be alive 
and you wouldn t be 
sean  things will get better
now that you re home 
the scar won t move 
but it will heal if you let it 
everything will be better 
he s out of our lives 
eve  if i told you
that i realized that   
that this thing
won t fully end   
until i did one last thing   
eve  something vital 
ok  i know

this is a suicide mission 
sean  yeah  i know  i know

of what he says he can do   
maybe it ll work  i don t know
