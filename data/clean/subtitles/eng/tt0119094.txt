woman moans with pleasure
woman ohh
sean porcelain casing
thermal cloak
nerve gas
and biological payload
hollis its enough to flatten

then depending
on the prevailing winds
the fallout will be
a tad worse
than gulf war syndrome
sean
the biblical plague to la
fuck aah where is he
wheres pollux troy
man why draw the schematic if
youre not gonna build the bomb
pollux what is it a crime
to exercise the mind
i wont say another word
until i see my brother
victor any progress
i need about 10 minutes
alone with this guy
you got castor just go home
sighs
we wont evacuate the city
on your hunch
look i know castor too well
for this to be a hunch
you know what
just run the goddamn bureau
any way you like
sighs
hollis i could put
an agent in his cell
maybe pollux will let it slip
sean oh come on
hes a paranoid sociopath
the only person hed talk to
is his brother and hes dead
hollis
there is one other possibility
beeping
oh god
youre keeping him alive
hollis relax archer
hes a turnip
sean groaning
what if you could walk
into erewhon prison
and give pollux
a nice big brotherly hug
as castor troy
i have no idea
what youre talking about
malcolm let me try
malcolm walsh
i run the bio cover unit
for special ops
i know who you are
but not what i can do
physical alteration
augmentation
hollis dr walsh
can alter the likeness
even the voice
of a government witness
malcolm i think youll
recognize this patient
we had to build
your friend loomis
a whole new ear from scratch
what were suggesting for you
isnt a permanent transplant
just a temporary trade
come here
with new antiinflammatories
healing takes days not weeks
your blood types wont match
but pollux wont know that
height difference is negligible
skin pigment eye pigment
both almost identical
well use laser shears
for the hairline
microplugs for body hair
well do an abdominoplasty
take care of those uh
love handles
but all thats the easy part
heres the real science
this is a state of the art
morphogenetic template
the inside is modeled
on your skull
the outside exactly like troys
then we fit his face on top
not a replica
but the real thing
then we simply connect
the muscles tear ducts
and nerve endings
sean so you want to take
his face and mine
hollis borrow
the procedures
completely reversible
sean you think
that i want to do this
no no
theres no one else sean
you have lived and breathed
castor troy for years
ill get his gang to talk
thats what i do
what if you cant
the bomb will blow
and castor troy will win
sean get out
go ahead wipe your ass
tito damn
what the hell is that smell
he shit in his pants
wheres dietrich
sean hello sasha
when was the last time
you saw castor troy
who cares hes dead
answer the question
i know my rights
i dont have to answer shit
youre right but know this
youre a convicted felon
on probation
for harboring castor troy
one phone call from me
and your son will end up
in a foster home
i understand why you would use
such a threat
but you try to take him
away from me
i swear to you
i havent seen him for years
sighs
sean this reeks of you
its got your signature
all over it
dietrich maybe but you
aint got nothin on me
