with them and have a drink
and talk about anything
id like for them
to give me some tobacco
a glass of wine or even just ask me
how are you today
and i would answer
and we would talk
and from time to time
id make a sketch
of one of them as a gift
they would accept it maybe
and keep it somewhere
and a woman
would smile at me and ask
are you hungry would you
like something to eat
a piece of ham some cheese
or maybe a fruit

im paul gauguin by the way
i know
youre vincent theos brother
yes
i saw your paintings at the cafeteria
you did you mustve been the only one
yes
but if you did it was worth it
there were a couple good ones in there
but it was hard to see
it was a difficult space
and too many works
my idea was a group show
i thought it could be a community
of artists like a family
when the other artists didnt participate
i had to do it by myself
i filled it with everything i had
in my studio
yeah it looked like it
those people you dont
want them to be your family
who needs a family like that
you cant pick your family
but you can pick your friends
i love my brother
then youre lucky
but more importantly he loves you
i know hes very good to you
i want to get as far away
from these people as possible
im going to madagascar
madagascar but what about japan
no no madagascar
its an island a big one
in between africa and india
or even further some remote island
where theyve never heard about painting
about paris or schools
somewhere where i can create a new vision
a new way of painting
far away from all systems and theories
real freedom
sighs id like to be calm
and take my time alone
forget about the rest
of the world and just
paint this here
slowly
what comes to me nothing else
that sounds good
i hate the fog im tired
of this gray light
id like to find a new light
for paintings that we havent yet seen
bright paintings painted in sunlight

mme ginoux what are you

vincent uh no shakespeare
how did you say
shakespeare william shakespeare
hes an english writer
do you know him
no he lived a long time ago
is he any good
oh yes
what does he write about
huffs about everything
about men and women
gods and kings about love and hate
what are you reading right now
its a uh theater play
called richard ill
who is that richard
a king a king of england
a good king
oh no
he was considered a real bastard
did he kill people
oh yes a lot
you shouldnt read a bastards story
why not
does he write well at least
oh yes very well
some of the lines
arent very clear but
i like that
why
because i like mystery
and shakespeare is more mysterious
than any other writer
well when i read a book
i like to understand whats written
what kind of books do you read
mmm
mostly novels modern novels
and short stories in the papers
sad stories
i dont know why
i like a story to be sad
if i had more free time i would
wait a minute ill be right back
dishes clanking
door opens
i have a book for you
thank you
theres nothing written in it
in fact its blank
but i thought you could use the paper
thank you
excuse me ive been meaning to ask you
is there a place
or do you have a storeroom
or a room where i could paint its
its sometimes difficult
with this weather the mistral
the yellow house next door
has been empty for months
maybe he could use it
yes perhaps we could make
an arrangement with your brother
it is a bit run down
but gaby can help you clean it up
that would be perfect for me
maybe i can
uh make a painting of you someday
postman me
yes
if you want sir thank you
gaby have you received
the money for this month
you still owe me for last month
when it arrives ill pay you
your brother he must be rich
well he hes not
hes a merchant he sells paintings
your paintings
not yet
you should wash yourself sometimes
at least once a week
do i look dirty
you smell terrible
youre not bad looking
if you just cleaned up a little
you might even be handsome
if i was clean
would you find me attractive
maybe
would you stay with me here
if i gave you 50 francs
you dont have 50 francs
see you tomorrow vincent
rain pattering
thunder rumbling
tool scratching
gaby why do you paint this
vincent what
these flowers why do you paint them
dont you find them beautiful
well they are beautiful flowers
no doubt
more beautiful than what you paint
you think so
oh yes
maybe youre right
but these flowers will wither
and fade all flowers do
i know everybody knows that
but mine will resist
gaby are you sure
vincent sighs
at least theyll have a chance
you should make a painting of me
why not
if you paint me
i would stay young forever maybe
i can even make you look younger
no it wouldnt be fair

they told me what happened please

i feel so well with you next to me
so well id like to die like this
theo sighs
when we were little i used to climb
into bed with you remember
yes you did
when it was getting cold
how long will you stay
just today im sorry
i have to get back to paris
so many things to do
and they told me you were in a hospital
and i took the first train
cant you stay any longer
i cant im sorry
sighs
it took one day and a night to get here
and im a married man now
i know you are
im very happy for jo and you
vincent
why did they put you here
i have no idea theo i swear to you
exhales
there must be a reason
from time to time i
i feel like im losing my mind
yes my mind goes out of me
im telling you it goes out of me
what do you mean
they say that i scream
in the streets that i cry
that i put black paint on my face
to scare the children
but i dont remember anything
anything except
the darkness and anxiety
so they sent me here
with really insane people
do you drink a lot
i must tell you
whispers dontdont tell it
to the doctors
theo sometimes i have visions
what do you see
its hard to say
ghosts
i dont know
flowers sometimes
and also angels human beings
its confusing
sometimes they talk to me
what do they say
i dont understand them
but its frightening
they arent always very nice
i will talk to the doctors
and see what can be done
when i get like this
i dont know what im capable of
maybe i could kill
and throw myself off a cliff
cries
indistinct chatter nearby
theo dear paul
i know youve been in correspondence
with my brother vincent
and he is very much looking forward
to your arrival in arles
which i know has been postponed
due to financial concerns
i am prepared and committed to sending
250 francs each month
in exchange for one painting
a month of yours at your discretion
it would benefit vincent greatly
to see you as soon as possible
a warm handshake
enthusiastically theo van gogh
ps looking forward to your response
and to seeing your latest works
of all the miseries that afflict humanity
nothing maddens me more
than the lack of money
but not tonight
indistinct chatter
another round madame
mme ginoux gaby
speaks french
some days i feel like a beggar
but not today
its so good to see you vincent
and this fine group
im happy to see you paul
but really no one around here
really likes me
except madame and monsieur ginoux
sometimes its days
before i speak to someone
ive been waiting for this moment
but you were so indecisive
im glad you made up your mind
is your brother still sending you money
two hundred and fifty francs a month
chuckles not much
he does what he can
did you make an arrangement with him
yeah
he pays my expenses here
and i send him a canvas a month
and youre happy with that
its all right
its acceptable
you have such a compelling face
maybe youd come over to the yellow house
and uh pose for me
maybe
ill take that as a yes
vincent chuckles
insects trilling
why do you always
have to paint from nature
i feel lost if i dont have
something to look at
i need something to see
theres so much to see
every time i look i see something
ive never seen before
yes but what you paint
what you do belongs to you
you dont need to copy anything
i dont copy
i know but why dont you paint
just whats in your mind
what your brain sees
because the essence of nature is beauty
what do you mean
what do you mean what do i mean
why did you want to go to madagascar
to get away from society from people
that may have been part of it
but you went there in search of beauty
and nature was definitely there
and it was different
than what you knew before
and it made your paintings look different
when i look at nature
i see more clearly
the tie that unites us all
a vibrating energy
speaking in gods voice
sometimes its so intense
i lose consciousness
scoffs come on
i swear to you
after a while i wake up and i dont know
where i am or what im doing
it takes me some minutes
to even remember my name
listen vincent the time is coming
when painters wont need anymore
to look at models and sit down
in front of nature
you know why
because nature is what we see here
in our heads nothing else
without our eyes theres no nature
and none of us sees the world
around us the same way
we sit you and i
in front of the same landscape
we dont see the same
mountains the same trees
vincent well thats what im saying
the trees that i paint are mine
even the faces you paint are yours
and theyll stay because of you
people will be known
because you painted them
and how you painted them
not because of who they are
thats good
and people will go to museums
to see paintings of people
not to see people who were painted
you know people dont always like
the way they look in my paintings
we have to start a revolution
do you understand
yes we do us our generation
we have to change entirely
the relation between painting
and what you call nature
between painting and reality
because painted reality
is its own reality
vincent youre right about that
both urinating
gauguin the impressionists
theyre out of it do you agree
clicking tongue uh
come on
they only paint their babies
in their gardens
theyll never go any further
seurat confounds painting with science
hes lost himself in optical experiments
theres nothing more to expect
from renoir degas monet
they repeat themselves
theyve given everything they could give
vincent you dont mean that
you like degas
you have to say thank you
for the paintings you like
monets pretty good
gauguin its our turn
we have a huge responsibility
vincent i still think
monets pretty good
you want to go to martinique
breathing heavily
vincent its good to have you here
flapping
door shuts
footsteps approaching
door opens
could you put your hand
back how it was
thank you
can i go
you can go
you have to plan your paintings slowly
whats the rush
work calmly slowly
youre indoors youre not outside
in the wind and the noise
paintings have to be done
in one clear gesture
think about the surface
that youre painting on
and how the paint will sit on it
youre changing things so fast
you cant even see what youve done
paintings have to be painted fast
uptempo piano music playing
vincent the painters i look at
frans hals
goya
velazquez
veronese
delacroix
the painters i like all paint fast
in one clear gesture each stroke
youve heard of a stroke of genius
well thats what it means
you dont even paint that way
you paint fast and you overpaint
your surface looks
like its made out of clay
its more like sculpture than painting
gauguin you dont even paint like that
you paint fast and then you overpaint
your surface looks
like its made out of clay
its more like sculpture than painting
insects chirping
insects chirping
im telling you
you have to look inside
you keep saying look inside
i get it i do
you keep repeating yourself
what do you think im doing
i dont invent the picture
i dont need to invent the picture
i find it already in nature
i just have to free it
all right im just saying
first think about your surface
and how the paint will sit on it
get control over what youre doing
maybe you should work inside more
ive spent all my life alone in a room
i need to go out and work
to forget myself
i want to be out of control
i need to be in a feverish state
wings flapping
its called the act
of painting for a reason
all right calm down
i dont want to calm down
the faster i paint the better i feel
i cant stay here vincent
what are you saying
i cant stay in arles
ill go soon
what
ive sold some paintings lately
maybe your brother told you
and i have to get back to paris
where are you going
vincent
panting
groaning
vincent ive spent
all my life alone in a room
i need to go out and work
gauguin what are you doing
vincentto forget myself
i want to be out of control
gauguin what
i need to be in a feverish state
its called the act of painting
for a reason
gauguin all right calm down
i dont want to calm down
the faster i paint the better i feel
crying
why are you crying
what did i do
where did i go wrong
nothing you have nothing to do
with this decision
vincent we cant live side by side
our temperaments are incompatible
you must admit that
and you have to understand
my reputation is established now
i cant live in a country town anymore
i have to be around people for now
vincent panting
besides i dont like it here
youre surrounded by stupid
wicked ignorant people
come on why are you
being so dramatic
vincent breathing heavily
please dont go
its great having you here
gauguin ive sold some paintings lately
maybe your brother told you
dont do it to me i beg you
no
gauguin nothing
you have nothing to do with this decision
where are you going
door opens
vincent we cant live side by side
vincent
our temperaments are incompatible
you must admit that
vincent groaning
and you have to understand
my reputation is established now
i cant live in a country town anymore
i have to be around people for now
what
besides i dont like it here
youre surrounded by stupid
wicked ignorant people
vincent crying
come on
why are you being so dramatic
cries
vincent what are you saying
gauguin i cant stay in arles
vincent exhales deeply
vincent theres something
strange about me
sometimes i dont know
what ive done or what ive said
about gauguin for instance
what happened right before he left
we had some fights
i
maybe i hurt him i dont know how
i do know
that i took a razor
and i cut off one of my ears yes
i cut it off one of my ears
blood all over the place
no one else did it i did it
i wanted to give it to gauguin
with my apologies
why
god knows
and i thought
she would know where paul was
so i gave my ear to the girl
at the bar to gaby
she was scared all the blood
i think she thought
i was going to kill her
so she called the police
and they put me here
and what would you have done
as a police officer
you can leave its all right
door closes
i
this is a small town vincent
everybodys watching what youre doing
even more in a small town
youre a stranger here
you drink too much
much too much
then you get hysterical
out of control
and yes one night you cut off
one of your ears
can you tell me why
my friend was about to leave me
he was about to leave
and cutting one of your ears
was a way to keep him next to you
that doesnt make sense
was it a kind of gift
or a sacrifice or what
what were you trying to achieve
i dont know
it might help to talk about it
try to tell me i
ive never seen anything like this before
but id like to help you
theres something inside me
i dont know what it is
what i see nobody else sees
and sometimes it frightens me
i think im losing my mind
but then i say to myself
ill show what i see
to my human brothers who cant see it
its a privilege
i can give them hope and consolation
youre confusing people
youre confusing yourself
with your paintings
i am my paintings
what do you mean
by consolation and hope
you might be asking too much of people
id like to share my vision with people
who cant see what i see the way i see
yes but why
because my vision is closer
to the reality of the world
i can make people feel
what its like to be alive
do you feel like they dont feel alive
yes i do
and you think you can make them
feel that through painting
yes yes absolutely
yes
gaby said your ear
was wrapped in this
and she was supposed to give it to paul
remember me
what did you mean by that
sighs deeply
maybe you were trying to show him
what he meant to you through that act
but that was something you couldnt see
i didnt want him to leave
it was a way to get him back
jesus said if thy hand offend thee
cut it off
so you cut off your ear
because you couldnt bear
to hear what paul was saying
i believe i have
a menacing spirit around me
an invisible being
i feel it i dont see it
he speaks to me and threatens me
and all he wants to do
is plunge a knife into my heart
i saw him and i tried to cut him
out of myself
so thats the reason
why you cut off your ear
breathes shakily
your vision of the world as you say
is quite frightening
isnt it
yes
im terrified hell come back
i see
sighs deeply
so listen to me
well send you to saintremy
where
saintremy
a very nice place
the best we have around here
youll be very welltreated
is it a jail
no not at all
its a voluntary asylum
its your choice but youll be subjected
to their rules and methods of care
i do think you can find
some peace there
and when youre less overexcited
you can even paint there
without painting i cant live
i believe you
will you will you come and see me
of course
at least once a week
and youre sure that um ill be allowed
to paint there youre sure
yes
but first when you get there youll have
to stop drinking and take some medicine
for how long
that will depend on you
will you do as i say
may i count on you
can you stay for a minute
i promised your brother id send him
a drawing of what youve done
dont move please
im going to take your bandage off
no i can do it
melancholy classical music playing
indistinct chatter
albert aurier beneath skies
that sometimes dazzle
like faceted sapphires or turquoises
beneath the incessant
and formidable streaming
of every conceivable effect of light
in heavy flaming
burning atmospheres
there is the disquieting
and disturbing display of strange nature
that is at once entirely realistic
and yet almost supernatural
often excessive nature
where everything
beings and things shadows
and lights forms and colors
rears and rises up with a raging will
to howl its own essential song
in the most intense and fiercely
highpitched timbre
it is matter and all of nature
frenetically contorted
it is form becoming nightmare
color becoming flames
light turning
into conflagration
life into burning fever
such is the impression
left upon the retina
when it first views the strange intense
and feverish work of vincent van gogh
how far are we are we not
from the beautiful
great tradition of art
never has there been a painter
whose art appeals so directly
to the senses
from the indefinable aroma
of his sincerity to flesh
and the matter of his paint
this robust and true artist

and when i became secretary

the keys to all the dossiers

and i can tell you they are all crazy
theyve all killed
tortured mutilated raped

where were you stationed

who was born in a tunnel

gauguin my dear vincent
ive looked most attentively
at your works since we parted
first at your brothers place
and then at independence exhibition
its above all at this latter place
that one can properly judge what you do
either because of things
positioned beside each other
or because of neighboring works
i offer you my sincere compliments
and for many artists you are
the most remarkable in the exhibition
with things from nature
youre the only one there who thinks
ive talked about it with your brother
and theres one that i would like
to exchange with you
for one thing of your choice
i hesitated greatly to write to you
knowing that you had just had
a rather long crisis
so please dont reply to me
until you feel completely strong
lets hope that with the warm weather
that will return
youre going to get well at last
the winter
is always dangerous to you
cordially ever yours paul gauguin

not here there
there there
follow me
here he is
thank you
please help me take it off
thank you
better
yes
come sit with me talk to me
please
i suppose you know why youre here
sighs talking to you now
to get better
or because i walked out of the asylum
what happened on the road to arles
i dont remember
you did walk out of the asylum
i wanted to go out
the townspeople of arles have signed
a petition against you
they dont want you to come back there
yes i know
did you ever molest a child
no never
did you cut off one of your ears
to give it to a prostitute is that true
yes i did but gabys not a prostitute
why did you do that
sighs i wanted her to give it
to a friend of mine
and she did
i dont know
and that was a strange offer wasnt it
do you feel angry sometimes
yes
and what do you do then
i go out and look at a blade of grass
or a branch of a fig tree
in order to calm down
and it works
yes
i feel god is nature
and nature is beauty
ive seen you in the garden painting
and ive heard from others
that you say you were a painter
yes thats what i am
why do you say that
do you have a gift for painting
yes
where does this gift come from
would you say that god gave you
the gift of painting
yes he did its the only gift
he gave me
did you paint this
yes i did
and you call it a painting
yes of course
tell me frankly
because id like to understand
why do you say youre a painter
because i paint
i love painting i have to paint
ive always been a painter
that i know
a born painter
yes
how do you know
because i cant do anything else
and believe me ive tried
so god gave you a gift
so you could paint this
yes
but dont you see swallows
now look carefully please
i dont want to hurt your feelings
but dont you see that this painting is
how can i say clears throat
unpleasant its ugly
why would god give me a gift to paint
ugly and disturbing things
sometimes i
feel so far away from everything
does anybody buy your paintings
no
so youre poor
yes rather poor
how do you live
well my brother theo
pays for me to be here
but hes not a rich man either
so you believe
that god gave you this gift
because he wants to keep you in misery
huh
i never thought about it that way
and which way do you think
sometimes i think
yes
maybe maybe
go on
maybe he chose the wrong time
what do you mean the wrong time
maybe god made me a painter for people
who arent born yet
possibly
it is said life is for sowing
the harvest is not here
i paint with my qualities and faults
so you think
god couldve been mistaken
i think of myself as an exile
a pilgrim on this earth
jesus said turn your heart away
from things visible
and turn yourself to things invisible
indeed but
and jesus also
was totally unknown
when he was alive
how do you know that
my father was a pastor
ive been around religion all my life
really a pastor
yes and before i realized
i was a painter
i tried myself to be a man of god
so i learned quite a bit about the topic
so you know the gospels
not only the gospels
i can tell you that jesus
wasnt discovered
until 30 or 40 years after he died
when he was alive
nobody talked about him
theres not even a letter from a roman
centurion to his wife in rome
saying that a man named jeshua
was crucified in jerusalem
with some other criminals
not a word nothing
you know this is my job to decide
if youre well enough to leave this place
this reminds me of jesus on the terrace
which terrace
speaking to pilate
who definitively if you
believe what was written
didnt want to crucify him
it was the people
yes we could have a real discussion
about this theory some other time
pilate didnt want to crucify jesus
but everything christ said
incriminated him so
i too
have to be careful
with what i say to you
i can understand that
listen come see me again
if you feel like
and share some other ideas with me
in the meantime dr rey
is here waiting for you
he came to take you home
im free to go
i think weve done
all we can for you here
i hope im ready
i hope so too
vincent
please return these things
to madame and monsieur ginoux
theyve been real friends
sure i will
and give them that book
tell them thank you
knock on door door opens
hello
dr rey bonjour
this is very important
make sure madame ginoux receives it
it is from the painter vincent van gogh
he apologizes for the delay
a bundle of towels
a ledger
and two empty olive boxes
vincent my works all here
you didnt sell anything
not yet but auriers review
was excellent really wonderful
that review was absurd i dont deserve
anything that man said
far from it
yes you do
theo the review will help
vincent i think
im beyond caring
what anyone thinks but
i care what you think theo
tell me i want to know the truth
am i a good painter
theo overlapping
youre not a good painter
vincent youre a great painter
vincent are you sure
of course im sure
why would i lie to you
i mean youre my brother
youre my brother
just to please me
theo i wouldnt do that
jo no theo would never do that
people say that i dont know how to draw
how to paint
they say my paintings are clumsy ugly
i used to care what people thought
but not anymore
voices continue overlapping
i have no choice
if i couldnt paint
i would murder someone
theo thats why i send you
money for your paintings
because i really believe
you are a great painter
and im a businessman
im a business man after all
so you paint
and leave the rest to us
you paint
and let us do the rest

anywhere out of paris
i cant stand it here
a little village
theres a lovely little inn
in auverssuroise
pissarro knows a doctor there
who knows your work loves art
and maybe he can help you
without getting in the way
jo and we could come and see you
vincent ill go there tomorrow
let me look into it
theo pissarro
i need to go theo
i need to go
ill take care of it
birds chirping
may i talk
vincent yes but dont move too much
why do you paint
i paint
as a matter of fact to stop thinking
a sort of meditation
when i paint i stop thinking
about what
i stop thinking
and i feel
that im a part of everything
outside and inside of me
i wanted
so much to share what i see
an artist
dr gachet yes
sighs i thought an artist
had to teach how to look at the world
but i dont think that anymore
now i just think
about my relationship to eternity
what do you call eternity
time to come
hmm
maybe what you are saying is
that your gift to the world is painting
vincent clicks tongue
sighs if not
what good is an artist
youre happy
when youre painting
most of the time except when i fail
you look sad sometimes
sighs theres a lot of destruction
and failure
at the door of a successful picture
i find joy in sorrow
and sorrow is greater than laughter
you know
an angel is not far
from those who are sad
and illness
can sometimes heal us
its the normal state
that gives birth to painting
you feel that way
sometimes i hate the idea
of regaining my health
laughs in that case
you dont need a doctor
stop laughing stop smiling
please
excuse me
go back to your pose
excuse me
its all right
sighs
sometimes they say im mad
but a grain of madness
is the best of art
youre not a mad man
its good to have a doctor as a friend
vincent
i feel a pain in my stomach
he was dressed like buffalo bill
hey vincent
panting
inaudible
vincent
one of them was nicer
gunshot
young man panting please
dont tell our parents
panting
mellow piano music playing
dr gachet what happened
what did you do
gasps
you have a bullet hole in your stomach
vincent i dont know
did you shoot yourself
maybe
i dont remember
dont blame anyone
dont blame anyone
do you have a gun
no never
so how did you do that
i dont know
tell
yes
tell my brother to come
oh i did hell be here soon
breathing heavily
vincent oh god
will you receive your son
