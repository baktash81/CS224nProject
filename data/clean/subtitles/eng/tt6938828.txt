with them and have a drink 
and talk about anything 
i d like for them
to give me some tobacco 
a glass of wine  or even just ask me 
 how are you today  
and i would answer 
and we would talk 
and from time to time 
i d make a sketch
of one of them as a gift 
they would accept it  maybe 
and keep it somewhere 
and a woman
would smile at me and ask 
 are you hungry  would you
like something to eat 
a piece of ham  some cheese 
or maybe a fruit

  i m paul gauguin  by the way 
  i know 
  you re vincent  theo s brother 
  yes 
i saw your paintings at the cafeteria 
  you did  you must ve been the only one 
  yes 
but if you did  it was worth it 
there were a couple good ones in there 
but it was hard to see 
it was a difficult space 
and too many works 
my idea was a group show 
i thought it could be a community
of artists  like a family 
when the other artists didn t participate 
i had to do it by myself 
i filled it with everything i had
in my studio 
yeah  it looked like it 
those people  you don t
want them to be your family 
who needs a family like that 
you can t pick your family 
but you can pick your friends 
i love my brother 
then you re lucky 
but more importantly  he loves you 
i know he s very good to you 
i want to get as far away
from these people as possible 
i m going to madagascar 
madagascar  but what about japan 
no  no  madagascar 
it s an island  a big one 
in between africa and india 
or even further  some remote island
where they ve never heard about painting 
about paris or schools 
somewhere where i can create a new vision 
a new way of painting 
far away from all systems and theories 
real freedom 
 sighs  i d like to be calm
and take my time  alone 
forget about the rest
of the world  and just   
paint this  here 
slowly 
what comes to me  nothing else 
that sounds good 
i hate the fog  i m tired
of this gray light 
i d like to find a new light 
for paintings that we haven t yet seen

 mme  ginoux  what are you
reading today  the bible 
 vincent  uh  no  shakespeare 
  how did you say 
  shakespeare  william shakespeare 
he s an english writer 
do you know him 
no  he lived a long time ago 
  is he any good 
  oh  yes 
  what does he write about 
   huffs  about everything 
about men and women 
gods and kings  about love and hate 
what are you reading right now 
it s a  uh  theater play
called richard ill 
  who is that  richard 
  a king  a king of england 
  a good king 
  oh  no 
he was considered a real bastard 
  did he kill people 
  oh  yes  a lot 
  you shouldn t read a bastard s story 
  why not 
  does he write well at least 
  oh  yes  very well 
some of the lines
aren t very clear  but   
  i like that 
  why 
because i like mystery 
and shakespeare is more mysterious
than any other writer 
well  when i read a book 
i like to understand what s written 
what kind of books do you read 
mmm   
mostly novels  modern novels 
and short stories in the papers 
sad stories 
i don t know why 
i like a story to be sad 
if i had more free time  i would   
wait a minute  i ll be right back 
 dishes clanking 
 door opens 
  i have a book for you 
  thank you 
there s nothing written in it 
in fact  it s blank 
but i thought you could use the paper 
thank you 
excuse me  i ve been meaning to ask you   
is there a place 
or do you have a storeroom 
or a room where i could paint  it s   
it s sometimes difficult
with this weather  the mistral 
the yellow house next door
has been empty for months 
maybe he could use it 
yes    perhaps we could make
an arrangement with your brother 
it is a bit run down 
but gaby can help you clean it up 
that would be perfect for me 
maybe i can   
uh  make a painting    of you someday 
 postman  me 
yes 
if you want  sir  thank you 
 gaby  have you received
the money for this month 
you still owe me for last month 
when it arrives    i ll pay you 
your brother  he must be rich 
well  he    he s not 
he s a merchant  he sells paintings 
your paintings 
not yet 
you should wash yourself sometimes 
at least once a week 
  do i look dirty 
  you smell terrible 
you re not bad looking 
if you just cleaned up a little 
you might even be handsome 
if i was clean 
would you find me attractive 
maybe 
would you stay with me here
if i gave you 50 francs 
you don t have 50 francs 
see you tomorrow  vincent 
 rain pattering

   gaby  why do you paint this 
   vincent  what 
  these flowers  why do you paint them 
  don t you find them beautiful 
well  they are beautiful flowers 
no doubt 
more beautiful than what you paint 
  you think so 
  oh  yes 
maybe you re right 
but these flowers will wither
and fade  all flowers do 
i know  everybody knows that 
but mine will resist 
 gaby  are you sure 
 vincent sighs 
at least they ll have a chance 
you should make a painting of me 
why not 
if you paint me 
i would stay young forever  maybe 
i can even make you look younger 
no  it wouldn t be fair

i feel so well with you next to me 
so well    i d like to die like this 
 theo sighs 
when we were little  i used to climb
into bed with you  remember 
yes  you did 
when it was getting cold 
how long will you stay 
just today  i m sorry 
i have to get back to paris 
so many things to do 
and they told me you were in a hospital 
and i took the first train 
can t you stay any longer 
i can t  i m sorry 
 sighs 
it took one day and a night to get here 
  and i m a married man now 
  i know you are 
i m very happy for jo and you 
vincent   
why did they put you here 
i have no idea  theo  i swear to you 
 exhales 
there must be a reason 
from time to time  i   
i feel like i m losing my mind 
yes  my mind goes out of me 
i m telling you  it goes out of me 
what do you mean 
they say that i scream
in the streets  that i cry 
that i put black paint on my face
to scare the children 
but    i don t remember anything 
anything except   
the darkness and anxiety 
so they sent me here 
with really insane people 
do you drink a lot 
i must tell you   
 whispers  don t don t tell it
to the doctors   
theo  sometimes i have visions 
  what do you see 
  it s hard to say 
  ghosts 
  i don t know 
flowers  sometimes   
and also angels  human beings 
it s confusing 
sometimes they talk to me 
  what do they say 
  i don t understand them 
but it s frightening 
they aren t always very nice 
i will talk to the doctors
and see what can be done 
when i get like this   
i don t know what i m capable of 
maybe i could kill   
and throw myself off a cliff

 theo  dear paul 
i know you ve been in correspondence
with my brother vincent 
and he is very much looking forward
to your arrival in arles 
which i know has been postponed
due to financial concerns 
i am prepared and committed to sending
250 francs each month
in exchange for one painting
a month of yours  at your discretion 
it would benefit vincent greatly
to see you as soon as possible 
a warm handshake 
enthusiastically  theo van gogh 
p s  looking forward to your response
and to seeing your latest works 
of all the miseries that afflict humanity 
nothing maddens me more
than the lack of money 
but not tonight

 mme  ginoux  gaby

some days  i feel like a beggar 
but not today 
it s so good to see you  vincent 
and this fine group 
i m happy to see you  paul 
but really  no one around here
really likes me 
except madame and monsieur ginoux 
sometimes    it s days
before i speak to someone 
i ve been waiting for this moment 
but you were so indecisive 
i m glad you made up your mind 
is your brother still sending you money 
  two hundred and fifty francs a month 
   chuckles  not much 
he does what he can 
  did you make an arrangement with him 
  yeah 
he pays my expenses here 
and i send him a canvas a month 
  and you re happy with that 
  it s all right 
it s acceptable 
you have such a compelling face 
maybe you d come over to the yellow house
and  uh  pose for me 
maybe 
i ll take that as a yes 
 vincent chuckles 
 insects trilling 
why do you always
have to paint from nature 
i feel lost if i don t have
something to look at 
i need something to see 
there s so much to see 
every time i look  i see something
i ve never seen before 
yes  but what you paint 
what you do belongs to you 
  you don t need to copy anything 
  i don t copy 
i know  but why don t you paint
just what s in your mind 
what your brain sees 
because the essence of nature is beauty 
what do you mean 
what do you mean  what do i mean 
why did you want to go to madagascar 
to get away from society  from people 
that may have been part of it 
but you went there in search of beauty 
and nature was definitely there 
and it was different
than what you knew before 
and it made your paintings look different 
when i look at nature   
i see more clearly   
the tie that unites us all 
a vibrating energy   
speaking in god s voice 
sometimes it s so intense 
i lose consciousness 
   scoffs  come on 
  i swear to you 
after a while  i wake up and i don t know
where i am or what i m doing 
it takes me some minutes
to even remember my name 
listen  vincent  the time is coming
when painters won t need anymore
to look at models and sit down
in front of nature 
you know why 
because nature is what we see here
in our heads  nothing else 
without our eyes  there s no nature 
and none of us sees the world
around us the same way 
we sit  you and i 
in front of the same landscape 
we don t see the same
mountains  the same trees 
 vincent  well  that s what i m saying 
the trees that i paint are mine 
even the faces you paint are yours 
and they ll stay because of you 
people will be known
because you painted them 
and how you painted them 
not because of who they are 
  that s good 
  and people will go to museums
to see paintings of people 
not to see people who were painted 
you know  people don t always like
the way they look in my paintings 
we have to start a revolution 
do you understand 
yes  we do  us  our generation 
we have to change entirely
the relation between painting
and what you call nature 
between painting and reality 
because painted reality
is its own reality 
 vincent  you re right about that 
   both urinating 
   gauguin  the impressionists 
they re out of it  do you agree 
   clicking tongue  uh   
  come on 
they only paint their babies
in their gardens

seurat confounds painting with science 
he s lost himself in optical experiments

 vincent  you don t mean that 
you like degas 
you have to say thank you
for the paintings you like 
  monet s pretty good 
   gauguin  it s our turn 
we have a huge responsibility 
 vincent  i still think
monet s pretty good

you have to plan your paintings slowly 
what s the rush 
work calmly  slowly 
you re indoors  you re not outside
in the wind and the noise 
paintings have to be done
in one clear gesture 
think about the surface
that you re painting on
and how the paint will sit on it 
you re changing things so fast 
you can t even see what you ve done

you ve heard of  a stroke of genius  
well  that s what it means 
you don t even paint that way 
you paint fast and you overpaint 
your surface looks
like it s made out of clay 
it s more like sculpture than painting 
 gauguin  you don t even paint like that 
you paint fast and then you overpaint 
your surface looks
like it s made out of clay 
it s more like sculpture than painting 
 insects chirping

i m telling you 
you have to look inside 
you keep saying  look inside  
i get it  i do 
you keep repeating yourself 
what do you think i m doing 
i don t invent the picture 
i don t need to invent the picture 
i find it already in nature 
i just have to free it 
all right  i m just saying 
first think about your surface
and how the paint will sit on it 
get control over what you re doing 
maybe you should work inside more 
i ve spent all my life alone  in a room 
i need to go out and work
to forget myself

of painting for a reason 
  all right  calm down 
  i don t want to calm down 
the faster i paint  the better i feel 
  i can t stay here  vincent 
  what are you saying 
i can t stay in arles 
i ll go soon

i ve sold some paintings lately 
maybe your brother told you 
and i have to get back to paris 
where are you going

i need to be in a feverish state

i don t want to calm down 
the faster i paint  the better i feel 
 crying 
why are you crying 
what did i do 
where did i go wrong 
nothing  you have nothing to do
with this decision 
vincent  we can t live side by side 
our temperaments are incompatible 
you must admit that 
and you have to understand 
my reputation is established now 
i can t live in a country town anymore 
i have to be around people  for now 
 vincent panting 
besides  i don t like it here 
you re surrounded by stupid 
wicked  ignorant people 
come on  why are you
being so dramatic 
 vincent breathing heavily 
please don t go 
it s great having you here 
 gauguin  i ve sold some paintings lately 
maybe your brother told you 
don t do it to me  i beg you 
  no 
   gauguin  nothing 
you have nothing to do with this decision 
  where are you going

come on 
why are you being so dramatic 
 cries 
 vincent  what are you saying 
 gauguin  i can t stay in arles 
 vincent exhales deeply 
 vincent  there s something
strange about me 
sometimes i don t know
what i ve done or what i ve said 
about gauguin  for instance 
what happened right before he left 
we had some fights   
i   
maybe i hurt him  i don t know how 
i do know   
that i took a razor   
and i cut off one of my ears  yes 
i cut it off  one of my ears 
blood all over the place 
no one else did it  i did it 
i wanted to give it to gauguin
with my apologies 
why 
god knows 
and i thought
she would know where paul was 
so i gave my ear to the girl
at the bar  to gaby 
she was scared  all the blood   
i think she thought
i was going to kill her 
so  she called the police
and they put me here 
and what would you have done 
as a police officer 
you can leave  it s all right 
 door closes 
i   
this is a small town  vincent 
everybody s watching what you re doing 
even more in a small town 
you re a stranger here 
you drink too much 
much too much 
then you get hysterical 
out of control 
and yes  one night you cut off
one of your ears 
can you tell me why 
my friend was about to leave me 
he was about to leave 
and cutting one of your ears
was a way to keep him next to you 
that doesn t make sense 
was it a kind of gift 
or a sacrifice or what 
  what were you trying to achieve 
  i don t know 
it might help to talk about it 
try to tell me  i   
i ve never seen anything like this before 
but i d like to help you 
there s something inside me 
i don t know what it is 
what i see  nobody else sees
and sometimes it frightens me 
i think i m losing my mind 
but then i say to myself 
 i ll show what i see
to my human brothers who can t see it  
it s a privilege 
i can give them hope and consolation 
you re confusing people 
you re confusing yourself
with your paintings 
i am my paintings 
what do you mean
by consolation and hope 
you might be asking too much of people 
i d like to share my vision with people
who can t see what i see the way i see 
yes  but why 
because my vision is closer
to the reality of the world 
i can make people feel
what it s like to be alive 
  do you feel like they don t feel alive 
  yes  i do 
and you think you can make them
feel that through painting 
yes  yes  absolutely 
yes 
gaby said your ear
was wrapped in this 
and she was supposed to give it to paul 
 remember me  
what did you mean by that 
 sighs deeply 
maybe you were trying to show him
what he meant to you through that act 
but that was something you couldn t see 
i didn t want him to leave 
it was a way to get him back 
jesus said   if thy hand offend thee 
cut it off  
so you cut off your ear
because you couldn t bear
to hear what paul was saying 
i believe i have
a menacing spirit around me 
an invisible being 
i feel it  i don t see it 
he speaks to me and threatens me 
and all he wants to do
is plunge a knife into my heart 
i saw him and i tried to cut him
out of myself 
so that s the reason
why you cut off your ear 
 breathes shakily 
your vision of the world  as you say 
is quite frightening 
  isn t it 
  yes 
i m terrified he ll come back 
  i see 
   sighs deeply 
so  listen to me 
we ll send you to saint remy 
  where 
  saint remy 
a very nice place 
the best we have around here 
you ll be very well treated 
  is it a jail 
  no  not at all 
it s a voluntary asylum 
it s your choice  but you ll be subjected
to their rules and methods of care 
i do think you can find
some peace there 
and when you re less overexcited 
you can even paint there 
without painting  i can t live 
i believe you 
will you    will you come and see me 
of course 
at least once a week 
and you re sure that  um  i ll be allowed
to paint there  you re sure 
yes 
but first  when you get there  you ll have
to stop drinking and take some medicine 
for how long 
that will depend on you 
will you do as i say 
may i count on you 
can you stay for a minute 
i promised your brother i d send him
a drawing of what you ve done 
don t move  please 
i m going to take your bandage off 
no  i can do it

 albert aurier  beneath skies
that sometimes dazzle
like faceted sapphires or turquoises 
beneath the incessant
and formidable streaming
of every conceivable effect of light 
in heavy  flaming 
burning atmospheres 
there is the disquieting
and disturbing display of strange nature
that is at once entirely realistic 
and yet almost supernatural 
often excessive nature
where everything 
beings and things  shadows
and lights  forms and colors 
rears and rises up with a raging will
to howl its own essential song
in the most intense and fiercely
high pitched timbre 
it is matter and all of nature 
frenetically contorted 
it is form becoming nightmare 
color becoming flames 
light turning
into conflagration 
life into burning fever 
such is the impression
left upon the retina
when it first views the strange  intense
and feverish work of vincent van gogh 
how far are we  are we not 
from the beautiful 
great tradition of art 
never has there been a painter
whose art appeals so directly
to the senses 
from the indefinable aroma
of his sincerity to flesh
and the matter of his paint

not crazy  but officers are

to the general 
i had all the keys  can you see it 
  the keys 
  yes 
the keys to all the dossiers
of all the officers 
and i can tell you  they are all crazy 
they ve all killed 
tortured  mutilated  raped

where were you stationed 
oh  it s a faraway place 
it s called tonkin 
 water pouring 
  and years ago  during the war   
   man sighs in relief 
there were many   
many tunnels were dug 
and i knew a tonkinese girl
who was born in a tunnel 
 man  cafe  cafe 
she didn t see the daylight
for the first 12 years of her life 
twelve years  gone 
can you imagine
that you were a painter

what it meant 
twelve years

 gauguin  my dear vincent 
i ve looked most attentively
at your works since we parted 
first at your brother s place 
and then at independence exhibition 
it s above all at this latter place
that one can properly judge what you do 
either because of things
positioned beside each other 
or because of neighboring works 
i offer you my sincere compliments 
and for many artists  you are
the most remarkable in the exhibition 
with things from nature 
you re the only one there who thinks 
i ve talked about it with your brother 
and there s one that i would like
to exchange with you
for one thing of your choice 
i hesitated greatly to write to you 
knowing that you had just had
a rather long crisis 
so  please don t reply to me
until you feel completely strong 
let s hope that  with the warm weather
that will return 
you re going to get well at last 
 the winter
is always dangerous to you 
cordially  ever yours  paul gauguin

please help me take it off 
thank you 
  better 
  yes 
come  sit with me  talk to me 
please 
i suppose you know why you re here 
 sighs  talking to you now 
to get better 
or because i walked out of the asylum 
what happened on the road to arles 
i don t remember 
you did walk out of the asylum 
i wanted to go out 
the townspeople of arles have signed
a petition against you 
  they don t want you to come back there 
  yes  i know 
  did you ever molest a child 
  no  never 
did you cut off one of your ears
to give it to a prostitute  is that true 
yes  i did  but gaby s not a prostitute 
why did you do that 
 sighs  i wanted her to give it
to a friend of mine 
and she did 
i don t know 
and that was a strange offer  wasn t it 
do you feel angry sometimes 
yes 
and what do you do then 
i go out and look at a blade of grass
or a branch of a fig tree
in order to calm down 
  and it works 
  yes 
i feel god is nature
and nature is beauty 
i ve seen you in the garden  painting 
and i ve heard from others
that you say you were a painter 
yes  that s what i am 
why do you say that 
  do you have a gift for painting 
  yes 
where does this gift come from 
would you say that god gave you
the gift of painting 
yes  he did  it s the only gift
he gave me 
  did you paint this 
  yes  i did 
  and you call it a painting 
  yes  of course 
tell me frankly 
because i d like to understand 
why do you say you re a painter 
because i paint 
i love painting  i have to paint 
i ve always been a painter 
that  i know 
  a born painter 
  yes 
how do you know 
because i can t do anything else 
and believe me  i ve tried 
so  god gave you a gift
so you could paint this 
yes 
but don t you see     swallows 
now look  carefully  please 
i don t want to hurt your feelings 
but don t you see that this painting is   
how can i say     clears throat 
unpleasant  it s ugly 
why would god give me a gift to paint
ugly and disturbing things 
sometimes i   
feel so far away from everything 
  does anybody buy your paintings 
  no 
  so  you re poor 
  yes  rather poor 
how do you live 
well  my brother  theo 
pays for me to be here 
but he s not a rich man either 
so  you believe
that god gave you this gift
because he wants to keep you in misery 
huh 
i never thought about it that way 
and which way do you think 
sometimes i think   
  yes 
  maybe  maybe   
  go on 
  maybe he chose the wrong time 
what do you mean the wrong time 
maybe god made me a painter for people
who aren t born yet 
possibly 
it is said   life is for sowing 
the harvest is not here  
i paint with my qualities and faults 
so  you think
god could ve been mistaken 
i think of myself as an exile 
a pilgrim on this earth 
jesus said   turn your heart away
from things visible
and turn yourself to things invisible  
  indeed  but   
  and jesus also
was totally unknown
when he was alive 
  how do you know that 
  my father was a pastor 
i ve been around religion all my life 
really  a pastor 
yes  and before i realized
i was a painter   
i tried myself to be a man of god 
so i learned quite a bit about the topic 
so you know the gospels 
not only the gospels 
i can tell you that jesus
wasn t discovered
until 30 or 40 years after he died 
when he was alive 
nobody talked about him 
there s not even a letter from a roman
centurion to his wife in rome
saying that a man named jeshua
was crucified in jerusalem
with some other criminals 
not a word  nothing 
you know  this is my job to decide
if you re well enough to leave this place 
this reminds me of jesus on the terrace 
which terrace 
speaking to pilate 
who definitively  if you
believe what was written 
didn t want to crucify him 
it was the people 
yes  we could have a real discussion
about this theory some other time 
pilate didn t want to crucify jesus 
but everything christ said
incriminated him  so   
i  too   
have to be careful
with what i say to you 
i can understand that 
listen  come see me again
if you feel like 
and share some other ideas with me 
in the meantime  dr  rey
is here waiting for you 
  he came to take you home 
  i m free to go 
i think we ve done
all we can for you here 
i hope i m ready 
i hope so  too 
 vincent 
please return these things
to madame and monsieur ginoux 
  they ve been real friends 
  sure  i will 
and give them that book 
tell them thank you 
 knock on door  door opens 
  hello 
   dr  rey  bonjour 
this is very important 
make sure madame ginoux receives it 
it is from the painter vincent van gogh 
he apologizes for the delay 
a bundle of towels 
a ledger 
and two empty olive boxes 
 vincent  my work s all here 
you didn t sell anything 
not yet  but aurier s review
was excellent  really wonderful 
that review was absurd  i don t deserve
anything that man said 
  far from it 
  yes  you do 
 theo  the review will help 
 vincent  i think   
i m beyond caring
what anyone thinks  but   
i care what you think  theo 
tell me  i want to know the truth 
am i a good painter 
 theo  overlapping 
you re not a good painter 
vincent  you re a great painter 
 vincent  are you sure 
of course  i m sure 
why would i lie to you 
i mean  you re my brother 
you re my brother 
just to please me 
   theo  i wouldn t do that 
   jo  no  theo would never do that 
people say that i don t know how to draw 
how to paint 
they say my paintings are clumsy  ugly 
i used to care what people thought 
but not anymore 
 voices continue overlapping 
i have no choice 
if i couldn t paint 
i would murder someone 
 theo  that s why i send you
money for your paintings
because i really believe
you are a great painter 
and i m a businessman 
i m a business man  after all 
so  you paint 
and leave the rest to us 
you paint
and let us do the rest 
 vincent 
gauguin sent me this letter 
  yes  i knew he wrote to you 
  did you see him 
 theo  no 
  gauguin   
  he hasn t asked for me 
   sent me this letter 
is he here 
i really don t know 
yes  i knew he wrote to you 
 jo  what about aurier or bernard 
do you want to see them 
i know they re in town 
 vincent  he hasn t asked
for me  is he here 
i   
anywhere  out of paris 
i want to go somewhere 
i can t stand it here  it s not my place 
i find everything too complicated 
i can t see anybody 
i can t stand it here 
it s not my place 
it s worse since aurier s article 
anywhere  out of paris 
i can t stand it here 
a little village 
there s a lovely little inn
in auvers sur oise 
pissarro knows a doctor there
who knows your work  loves art 
and maybe he can help you
without getting in the way 
   jo  and we could come and see you 
   vincent  i ll go there tomorrow 
let me look into it 
   theo  pissarro   
  i need to go  theo 
  i need to go 
  i ll take care of it 
 birds chirping 
  may i talk 
   vincent  yes  but don t move too much 
why do you paint 
i paint   
as a matter of fact  to stop thinking 
a sort of meditation 
  when i paint  i stop thinking 
  about what 
i stop thinking   
and i feel   
that i m a part of everything
outside and inside of me 
i wanted   
so much to share what i see 
an artist   
 dr  gachet  yes 
 sighs  i thought an artist   
had to teach how to look at the world 
but i don t think that anymore 
now i just think
about my relationship to eternity 
what do you call eternity 
  time to come 
  hmm 
maybe what you are saying is
that your gift to the world is painting 
 vincent clicks tongue 
 sighs  if not 
what good is an artist 
you re happy
when you re painting 
most of the time  except when i fail 
you look sad sometimes 
 sighs  there s a lot of destruction
and failure
at the door of a successful picture 
i find joy in sorrow 
and sorrow is greater than laughter 
you know   
an angel is not far
from those who are sad 
and illness
can sometimes heal us 
it s the normal state   
that gives birth to painting 
you feel that way 
sometimes i hate the idea
of regaining my health 
 laughs  in that case 
you don t need a doctor 
stop laughing  stop smiling 
  please 
  excuse me 
go back to your pose 
  excuse me 
  it s all right 
 sighs 
sometimes they say i m mad   
but a grain of madness
is the best of art 
you re not a mad man 
it s good to have a doctor as a friend 
 vincent 
i feel a pain in my stomach 
he was dressed like buffalo bill 
hey  vincent 
 panting 
 inaudible 
 vincent 
one of them was nicer 
 gunshot 
 young man  panting  please 
don t tell our parents 
 panting 
 mellow piano music playing 
 dr  gachet  what happened 
what did you do 
 gasps 
you have a bullet hole in your stomach 
 vincent  i don t know 
  did you shoot yourself 
  maybe 
i don t remember 
don t blame anyone 
don t blame anyone 
do you have a gun 
no  never 
so how did you do that 
i don t know 
tell   
yes 
  tell my brother to come 
  oh  i did  he ll be here soon 
 breathing heavily 
 vincent  oh  god 
will you receive your son
