to their party 
mama 
it s 10 48
on fat tuesday  mardi gras 
now let s go back
in time to 1964 
the beach boys on 105 3 fm 
the heart of new orleans 
  well it s been
building up inside of me
  for oh i don t know
how long  
okay  take it out wide 
give the pig some room 
  when she says
don t worry baby
  don t worry baby 
don t worry  
  don t worry baby
  i guess i should have kept
my mouth shut
  when i started to brag
about my car
  but i can t back down now
  because i pushed
the other guys too far
  she makes me come alive
  and makes me wanna drive
when she says
  don t worry baby 
don t worry baby
  don t worry baby
  everything will turn out
all right  
  don t worry baby 
don t worry  
my daughter s on that ferry 
please  please 
oh  god  my daughter 
do the other side 
atf new orleans 
agent donnelly 
listen 
call new orleans pd 
i want all surveillance
from the algiers dock 
then call city transit 
i want the crescent city
bridge surveillance 
westbound between
10 00 and 11 00 
all right  got it 
hey  seen an atf
agent around here 
yeah 
he went down below 
how do i get there 
the south side
of the bridge 
you agent minuti 
larry minuti  atf 
no  larry s my partner 
i m doug carlin 
paul pryzwarra  fbi 
how you doing 
where s minuti 
on vacation 
not anymore  we re calling in
half the region on this one 
you can  uh  reach him 
i tried  he s not
picking up his phone 
well  try harder 
it s important 
obviously 
what are you
looking for 
anything that
doesn t belong 
you want to give me a spot 
uh  yeah 
anfo 
ammonium nitrate 
water soluble 
fuel oil would have burned
off during the blast 
between the river and the
rain  if anfo was used 
the only place you d
find it would be   
underneath this bridge 
that s right 
we can t rule out an accident
at this point 
it s not officially
a crime scene yet 
here s a thought 
why don t we
double the perimeter
so we don t have wall to wall
trailers down there 
no  we re gonna need
all our manpower
for evidence control
and witness processing 
now  we need to keep it tight
until we can determine that
it is a crime investigation 
it is a crime investigation 
got a piece of electric blasting
cap and a strand of leg wire 
about a million of
those blue particles
washed up on
the algiers side 
it s probably from a plastic
container or a barrel 
anfo 
most likely 
there was post blast residue
under the crescent
city bridge 
the insulation on the
leg wire will inform us
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is 
then we go after
the switching mechanism
and the bomb s
power source 
we probably don t need
to wait for the lab
to tell us what
we already know 
that this is an explosive
and a trigger 
and you are 
oh  i m sorry 
i m doug carlin  atf 
who s in charge 
we re working on that now 
gentlemen  please 
ed elkins  i m in charge

what time does it say 
10 47 
that s before the explosion 
isn t it 
right before 
mccready  can i have
your attention  please 
thanks very much for coming 
i m jack mccready 
special agent
in charge of
this investigation 
first  let me say
our hearts go out
to all of those
affected by this tragedy 
early estimates place
the number of casualties
at 543 men 
women and children 
now  lord knows this city
has seen its share of pain 
but unlike katrina 
this disaster was
not an act of nature 
after careful review of evidence
retrieved at the scene 
we have concluded this was
a deliberate act of terrorism 
and the president concurs
with our assessment 
on our end  we have to
ask for your patience 
as the investigation
will take time 
it s a unique and complicated
crime scene 
there s no baggage checks 
there s no flight data recorder 
there are maximum casualties 
and most of the evidence is
under 100 feet of muddy water 
there are no shortcuts 
kevin  where s doug 
you just missed him 
well  his car s still here 
took the streetcar 
what  streetcar 
hey  don t look at me 
it s part of his process 
he says it helps him think 
sheriff reed 
how you doing 
it s doug carlin returning your call 
hey  doug  i know you got
your hands full right now 
yeah  that s okay 
what do you got for me  bob 
well  a couple of kids
found a woman
face down in the waters
off algiers point 
she was burned
over 30  of her body 
right  well  you re gonna see a lot
of that over the next few weeks 
we ve just set up ecc 
just have crime scene
bag it for us 
well  we already done that 
the body s at the me s right now 
crime scene s
already been there 
yeah  they ve been and gone 
well  exactly what time did
this woman wash up on shore 
kid called it in
at 10 42 a m 
you mean 11 42  don t you 
no  i mean 10 42 
i got the sheet right in front of me 
and i got my
reading glasses on 
immediately evident is the focal
charring of the limbs and torso 
anterior face  neck and chest
are intact 
though swollen from apparent
immersion in water 
hold her hand
for me  will you 
right here 
there we go 
each digit of the right hand
has been severed
between the middle and
distal phalanges  thanks 
angle of shearing indicates
a single sharp force trauma 
possibly caused
by shrapnel 
no  no  it s too even
to be shrapnel trauma 
posterior charring
gives off a strong odor 
suggesting perimortem
immersion in burning fuel 
diesel 
accelerant  maybe 
i don t know 
if she was that close
to the bomb 
she probably wouldn t
be laying here now 
what are you doing 
what are you doing 
you got a uv gun 
yeah 
on the table behind you 
you see that 
duct tape 
mmm hmm 
what s that stippling 
you see that 
adhesive probably retained some
substance against the water 
yeah 
yeah  go ahead 
i ran down
those mprs for you 
a claire kuchever was reported
missing this morning 
supposed to pick up her
father from the airport 
pulled a no show 
okay 
all right  phil  i want
you to do a full autopsy 
concentrate on
time and cause 
full spread of lab tests 
everything 
just pretend like the ferry explosion
never happened today  okay 
absolutely 
claire 
she s beautiful  huh 
yeah 
very 
you ll need a photograph for
your investigation  right 
there s plenty in the house 
plenty to choose from 
mr  kuchever 
i m sorry about this 
but i m gonna need you to confirm
your daughter s identity 
okay 
uh  now  anything
that you can tell me
about your daughter s

all  will be helpful 
well  i don t know 
my flight got in

and she was supposed to pick
me up  but she wasn t there 
i thought maybe
she just overslept 
so i took a cab and i went
straight to her house 
her and alan s car was gone

just finally sold it 
who s alan 
her fiance 
or ex fiance

he moved to montreal 
okay 
she was too good

woman tuesday  1 18 p m 
yeah  this is atf agent doug
carlin returning your call 
my cell number

the blast wave initiated
here  hit the bulkhead
and propagated fore and aft along
the path of least resistance
until it hits
this access hatch 
uh  and that s where
it gets really bad 
the blast wave continues
into the engine room 
bursting the fuel tanks 
this utility shaft here
acts like a chimney 
draws the thermal components
into the engine room 
which ignites the fuel vapor 
causing a secondary explosion
of far greater magnitude 
essentially 
the initial device
turns the whole ferry
into a bomb
and detonates it 
and so our early guess
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or suv 
possibly red or tan 
mccready  make and model 
take weeks 
maybe months 
i got a partial on
the license plate 
shit 
check all the suvs and minivans
that are registered in the state 
anything recently
rented or purchased 
anything tied to a theft
or a missing persons report 
agent mccready 
yeah 
doug carlin  atf 
oh  yeah  oklahoma city 
right  that s right 
this afternoon 
i witnessed an autopsy
of a young woman who washed
up off the poland wharf 
heavy fuel burns 
traces of petn on her face 
petn  that s the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists 
she also lost several fingers in
what appeared to be blast damage 
appeared 
that s right  i checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast 
for her to have washed up that
early and that far upriver 
she would ve had
to have been killed
two hours before
the ferry exploded 
before 
she died before
the explosion 
she died before
the explosion  yeah 
her name is
claire kuchever 
she washed up before the
explosion and against the tide 
do you have a scenario 
yes  i do 
i believe that somebody abducted
her in her home  taped her mouth 
bound her wrists  burned her
alive  dumped her in the river
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim 
a disaster that
hadn t happened yet 
but the petn tells us
that the bomber came in direct
contact with the victim 
you solve her case 
you solve this case 
why this woman 
good question 
her suv is missing 
it s a tan and red bronco 
it could have been stolen to
drive the bomb to the ferry 
oh  one more thing 
the victim called
the local atf office
the morning
of the explosion 
yeah 
we ll look into it 
okay 
all right 
okay 
where s larry 
what 
larry minuti  my partner 
that s his car right there 
is he here 
i thought you said
he was on vacation 
yeah  that s right 
what 
those cars were brought here from
the algiers ferry parking lot 
they re the vehicles
that belonged to the victims 
sorry 
so he s a former marine 
yes  sir  yeah  local  too 
he s born and bred
in new orleans 
his family
still in the area 
nope  nothing  really 
but his job 
you like him 
he s smart 
yeah  i like him  too 
all right 
let s go find him 
oklahoma city 
yeah 
you and larry were close 
yeah 
yeah  you know  close enough
to get on each other s nerves 
doug  i ve been put in charge of a
newly formed investigative unit 
the ferry disaster is our first
case  and i want you on the team 
why me 
we ve got some unique
time constraints 
i need someone who can look at a
crime scene exactly one time 
tell us what s missing  tell
us what shouldn t be there 
tell us what
we can ignore
and  especially 
what we need to pursue 
also  you re local  you know the
people and you know the area 
but why an atf guy 
why not 
it s your shot 
you want to find the guy
who killed minuti  don t you 
yes  i do 
i guess you ve
got some questions 
for me to have questions  first
i d need to know something 
now i do have
some questions 
don t touch anything 
we don t need you yet 
doug  you remember
dr  alexander denny 
where s my audio 
compensating for audio delay 
just a second 
oh  compensating for a technical
blunder by a tech guy   
solid stream 
minus four days 
six hours  three
minutes  45 seconds 
and 14 and
a half nanoseconds 
okay 
anytime you want to jump
in here  be my guest 
me 
yeah 
what are we looking for 
you know  clues  suspects 
anything out of the norm 
when was this taken 
four and a half
days ago 
gunnars  try the guy
with the backpack 
oh  that s tender 
i wish i had someone 
okay  widen out 
let s cruise the car deck for
a while  see what we got 
how can you
change the angle
on footage taken
four and a half days ago 
this is a digital recreation 
we re combining all the data
we ve got into one fluid shot 
any angle  any view
within the target area 
okay  um 
let s cruise the breezeway 
see what we get there 
it s a brand new program 
it s called snow white 
our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites 
but at any given time  as many as
four are surveilling one area 
it s like having
multiple eyewitnesses 
each with their
own vantage point 
snow white 
well  which one
of the seven dwarfs
can explain to me
how you get the audio 
i don t understand 
why do you gotta
look at four days ago 
why don t you just fast forward
it to the day of the explosion 
we have to wait 
it takes four and a half days
to render this
single fluid shot 
the only thing
that matters
is that we have exactly
one look at any one time 
yeah  we can t go back
10 minutes  you know 
can t look back and see
if there was a second gunman 
we can t watch the agent buying
10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983 
all right 
but given enough lead time 
we can look anywhere within
the target area  all right 
it s the when
that s always constant 
it s always four days
and six hours ago 
always  you understand 
it s like a single trailing
moment of now  in the past 
okay  so if  if  if  if you can t
move forward or backward in time 
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that 
it s not the image
that s moving faster 
it s just our
shifting point of view 
the passage of time
remains constant 
but we can shift
our point of view
within the data stream
as fast as we want 
you understand 
yeah  yeah  no 
yeah  i know 
so four days from   
well  actually  three days from now 
since it s after midnight 
you ll be able to look back
to the day of the explosion 
see who did it 
how they did it
and what they did it with 
yeah  you got it 
the only thing is  you need
to tell us where to look 
 cause  you know 
we could miss it 
besides  three days could be
too late  he could leave the country 
could strike again 
we need to do
whatever we can now 
we know he s out there
planning this 
we just don t
know where to look 
so  agent carlin 
where do we look 
claire kuchever s house 
address is in range 
all right  match the viewer
settings to the signal 
signal s solid 
all right  dazzle me 
what 
you see  with snow white
we can track through walls 
it s part of the same infrared
thermal imaging stuff
they re using in iraq 
hello  this is 877 504 8423 
we triangulate
from four satellites 
pick up the heat signal
and reconstruct 
basically 
we can walk through walls 
claire kuchever 
claire  hello 
did you know her 
we held hands once 
but no  i didn t know her 
just checking in 
wondering how you re doing 
montreal s fantastic 
but my boss is an ass

see what she s looking at 
yeah  yeah  yeah

and  oh  hey  carlin 
man  when did
you completely forget
how to investigate
a crime scene 
what do you mean

i wanna know everything there
is to know about this woman 
well  shouldn t we be
concentrating on the ferry 
well  yeah 
it s likely that our guy
cased the ferry first 
but we don t know when 
we don t even know
what he looks like 
i mean  we could stare him right
in the face and not know it s him 
but we will notice a change  even
a small change  in her life 
  hey  beth

i don t even know if i can
do it monday  hang on 
show me the book 
monday works 
damn 
shit 
can we go back 
no 
seriously 
no  it s far too much data for
any existing storage system 
it s a constant stream 
there s no rewind 
no second chances 
we can record what we re
seeing  but we can t go back
and choose to look
at something different 
okay  you said we
can record  though 
yes 
okay 
tell me 
is there any scientific
or forensic insight
likely to be gained
by spying on this woman
in the shower 
shanti  we re trying to make
sure the woman s clean 
all right  why don t you 
you know  look around the rest of
the bathroom  can you do that

government agency 
okay  this is from the atm
camera across the street 
all right  let s fast forward to the
exact time of his phone call to claire 
where are we
supposed to be looking 
behind the guy
on the left 
can you enhance it 
gunnars 
not enough for an id 
wait  go back 
can you rewind it just a little bit 
stop  what is that
on the ground 
looks like
a camcorder bag  maybe 
we have facial
recognition software 
yeah 
let s use it on the bag 
cross match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion  all right 
don t think it s
ever been used this way 
yeah  that s kind of a simple
image to go for a match 
well  we got
nowhere else to go 
look  same bag 
bingo 
okay  freeze it 
yeah  looks like the same guy  too 
where is this 
security camera
at the algiers ferry dock 
okay  when is this 
two nights
before the explosion 
seven hours from now 
two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now 
seven hours from now 
we will be able
to access this point
in our time window 
gotcha 
kind of creepy  seeing that
lady s life go down in flames 
yep 
makes you
appreciate life 
i suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got 
that s what i m gonna do 
nobody home 
how d you let that happen 
everything you have 
you lose  right 
mother  father  gone 
good looks 
pryzwarra  gone 
loved ones
gone in a second 
that s what this job
teaches you  doesn t it 
no matter what 
no matter how hard you grab onto
something  you still lose it  right 
well  we re gonna grab onto
this guy in a couple hours 
we re gonna nail
this son of a bitch 
what s wrong 
no matter what 
we still lose her 
right 
   dot com for
a link to the fema web site 
military helicopters that
have served as an emergency force
are leaving the city  hundreds of
thousands of new orleans residents
have been unable to come back
home  and entire neighborhoods   
did you talk to him 
   are still
waiting to rebuild 
this while
governmental agencies   
  oh  no 
  what is it 
mom asked me to say a prayer for
david this morning  but i forgot 
okay 
mom is gonna be so mad at me 
she s not gonna be mad at you 
come on 
we ll just say
one now  all right 
it s too late 
it s never too late  sweetie 
we ll just pray that david
had a good day  all right 
how about this 
you pray for david 
and i ll pray
for my mom  okay 
okay 
all right 
what s going on 
give it a second 
  gunnars 
  it s rebooting  it s coming back 
are we online 
wait 
are we online 
gunnars 
what the hell s going on 
shanti  are we back online 
i don t know 
something broached the field 
what broached the field 
that broached the field 
right there 
that broached the field 
right there 
that s what
broached the field 
now  you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is 
it s not surveillance  paul 
it s not
electronic thermal imaging 
you guys have
figured out a way
to look into the past 
yes or no 
no 
you re lying 
you re lying 
and you know it 
i ve told you
everything i can 
she saw it  paul 
i pointed this thing at her just now 
and she responded to it from
four and a half days ago 
explain that to me 
all right 
somebody explain it 
hit it  shanti 
for three years 
cambridge has been working
for national reconnaissance
on an r   d grant 
okay 
we were attempting to use
concentrated bursts of energy
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes 
in the process 
we had a breakthrough 
given enough energy  we could
warp the very fabric of space 
i said explain it to me 
not talk science 
they found a way to   
look  i ll tell you what 
why don t you guys just keep talking 
i ll just sit here
until you figure out what it
is you really wanna tell me 
they found a way to fold
space back onto itself 
all right  look  uh  we re used
to viewing space as flat  right 
  like this piece of paper 
  right 
to see something
from a distance 
light has always
had to travel
the long way across
the flat space in between 
but given what i
was trying to explain 
we can fold the space 
bring the target closer to us 
create what s known as
an einstein rosen bridge 
otherwise known
as a wormhole 
suspend it via
gravitational field 
that s what we re looking at 
that s it 
what s on the other end
of the bridge 
claire s house 
wow 
basically  we re folding
space in a higher dimension
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points 
instantaneous 
well  that s what we hoped for
and that s what we expected 
but the electrical force   
we used huge amounts of
energy to create this bridge 
all right  how huge 
you remember that little blackout
we had a few years back 
yes  i do 
new york blamed canada 
right 
canada blamed michigan 
half the northeast 
you re saying you guys   
50 million homes  right 
my bad 
well  i still say
we blame canada  but   
okay  so why can t
i see this bridge 
it s not visible to the human eye 
i mean  it s real  though 
it s just as real
and just as solid
as a cell phone signal
or a radio wave 
right  well  i don t know
how a cell phone works 
i just know how to use it 
so how do we use this 
we can look back
four and a half days 
and what 
we can look anywhere 
limited radius 
right  right  right 
looking into the past 
in a sense  we re always
looking in the past 
even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror
takes some time
to reflect back 
let me get this straight 
you re trying to tell me that on
the other side of this bridge
is the actual past 
yes 
  wow 
  yeah  but look  look  look 
we created this thing by pure accident 
all right 
this  this  this
space and time   
this  this time window
is a complete fluke 
all right  and  and
everybody is terrified
of screwing with it
for fear of losing it
or suffering the consequences
of god knows what 
which is why it can only be
used as a retroactive tool   
hey  let me ask you something 
is she alive or is she dead 
you went to her funeral  doug 
i know that 
but i think
the question still applies 
is she alive
or is she dead 
all right 
life  like time and space 
is not merely
a local phenomenon 
all right 
am i asking a hard question 
looks like i picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash 
all right 
i tell you what 
i ll speak slow 
so those of you
with ph d  s in the room
can understand 
it    here  look 
here s a monitor  right 
now the monitor is broken 
it s dead 
it is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy 
it s dead  right 
now  is she alive
or is she dead 
she s alive 
all right 
now we re getting somewhere 
all right  now  you said light
could go back  what else 
nothing 
something else could be sent back 
come on  paul  something 
what  a body  a human being 
no 
not a person  not alive  anyway 
why not 
because you can t beat the physics 
the electromagnetic field 
look  you transition across
what s known as the wheeler
boundary  all right 
an em pulse annihilates
all electrical activity 
that s your heartbeat  that s
brainwaves  that s everything 
so what  you  you
haven t tried a person 
let s just say that
we ve done enough tests
to know that it s
not even possible 
it s not even
theoretically possible 
the hamster goes back  dead 
a drosophila fly  dead 
what about a radio signal 
what about that 
we could send a radio   
a radio signal 
yeah  a radio signal 
won t work  electrical 
the field would scramble it 
all right  then a note  a warning note 
no 
a single piece of paper  one sheet 
no 
if we keep the mass low   
no 
this could work 
it could work 
sure  we know where
the guy s gonna be 
we can apprehend him
and put him away
before he even
blows up the boat 
and how do we
do that  exactly 
we send it to ourselves 
you send it to me  yeah  send it to me 
send it to my office 
send it to my office
four and a half days ago 
an anonymous tip  and we can capture
this guy before he even meets claire 
we know he s
gonna be at the dock 
whatever you did 
you did it already 
whether you send
this note or you
don t send this note 
it doesn t matter 
you cannot change the past 
it s physically impossible 
what if there s
more than physics 
okay 
something spiritual  right 
yeah  something spiritual 
okay  okay  okay  look 
j just try to
think of it this way 
god s mind is made up
about this  all right 
i mean  you know  call it fate 
call it destiny  whatever 
but it already happened 
it will keep happening 
and it always will happen 
maybe 
and why don t
we call it fate 
since we re
calling it something 
maybe  maybe you re right  maybe you
guys are exactly right  i don t know 
all i know is this 
for all of my career 
i ve been trying
to catch people
after they do
something horrible 
for once in my life 
i d like to catch somebody before
they do something horrible 
all right 
can you understand that 
address is in range 
two l s 
 surveilling   two l s 
since this is such a tremendous
waste of taxpayer money 
the least we could do
is get the spelling right 
that s not necessarily true 
branching universe theory
holds that you can do   
oh 
branching universe theory 
look  hold it 
all right 
no  no  no 
i ll show you 
the traditional
view of time is linear 
like a river flowing from
the past toward the future 
but you can change
the course of a river  right 
exactly  introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river
and you create a new branch 
still flowing toward the future 
but along a different route 
changed 
yeah  but that river
is the mississippi 
and we re lobbing what
amounts to a pebble into it 
that s a very few
tiny ripples in a kind of
big body of water 
don t you think 
traditionalist 
say we do create
this new branch 
what happens to the old one 
to  to this one 
ask the radical 
well  it might continue
parallel to the new branch 
but most likely
it ceases to exist 
the idea is 
we cease to exist 
all right 
this version of us  anyway 
you know  we never came here 
we didn t meet doug 
we don t remember
it ever happening 
well  that s worth
 10 billion right there 
would ve been a lot faster
if you d written it yourself 
right  then i recognize
my own handwriting
and the universe blows up 
we re ready 
all right  third floor 
southwest corner 
that s where we are 
  how d you get that information 
  good police work 
that s me  i can hear me 
i don t wanna play games with you 
where am i 
i m not playing games 
yeah  you are 
no  i m not 
there are protocols    yeah  you are 
there i am 
is that minuti 
there s procedures   
yep  that s my partner  larry 
look  i know how this job works 
you know how this job works 
jesus  i forgot
all about this part 
all right  let s find a nice  happy
place to push the note onto 
that your desk 
yeah  that s my   
okay  line us up 
when i peg a guy on a hunch 
that s good police work 
not some conspiracy to keep you
out of the loop  all right 
you know what  doug 
okay  kid  start pushing 
expand the wave
past the note 
i can t watch your back
if you re holding out on me 
why not 
if my memory serves me right 
we better hurry up 
 cause i think
i m about to leave 
  i need more cowbell 
  i m trying 
okay  well  i   
good 
just give me a second 
don t talk to each other 
expand 
i m about to leave 
   another partner 
how about that  how about that 
everybody relax 
okay  yeah 
let s go 
i m working on it 
prepare for the final
power surge  ready 
have a good vacation 
all right  go  go  go 
walk away 
what the hell happened 
i don t know 
it doesn t matter  doesn t matter 
pull it back 
did it go through 
i don t know  i don t know 
pull it back 
there it is 
it went through 
that s right 
it s through 
  it went through 
  great 
whoa  whoa 
no  wait a minute  hang on 
it ain t great yet 
i don t come back

i m not coming back 
put it down  larry 
larry  don t do it 
follow him 
i m on him 
all right  look  let s    you know what 
let s cut away from minuti 
the bomber s on
his way to the dock 
he s due there any minute 
we ll come back to minuti when
he gets there  all right 
all right 
okay  where is he 
can we  uh  circle it 
we should be able
to see him by now 
that s him 
there he is  all right 
  holy shit 
  all right 
move in on him real close 
i want to see his   
that s him 
that s him 
that s our guy 
that s him 
at the bridge 
the cemetery  the atm 
that s our guy 
shanti  see if you can get
an id  facial id on him 
give me some time 
okay  all right 
take your time 
there s your partner 
i see him 
try to move in
on his truck 
see if we can
get a plate 
no plate 
get back on him 
stay on him 
where s minuti 
federal agent 
turn the engine off 
turn the engine off 
tilt back down 
he s still breathing 
what can we do 
i don t know what to do 
he s traveling east 
he s traveling out of range 
okay  what can we do  anything 
i don t know 
but if we don t do something
fast  i m gonna lose this guy 
we re losing the signal 
we have to boost the signal 
we need to chase him
with the goggle rig 
yeah  well  gunnars is
a little busy right now 
and he s the only one
who can use it 
where is it 
what  the rig  it s   
yeah  the rig 
where is it 
it s in his  
it s in his hummer 
keys in there 
yeah 
all right  quiet 
everybody  it s him 
carlin 
where s he now 
is he going east 
yes 
okay  he s going east 
going up on de gaulle 
all right  just try to keep him in
sight  and keep feeding me directions 
i ll try and track him
with this goggle rig 
can he do that 
yeah  if he can
catch up to the image
and keep him in sight 
that could work 
hey  how do you
turn this thing on 
there s an on off button
on the back of the rig 
okay  i see it 
it s really simple  wherever you look 
the eyepiece will auto focus 
and we ll see what you see 
okay  you re live 
you re on 
try the goggles 
hang on  hang on 
he s gone 
out of range 
what 
where s he headed 
he s headed toward the i 10 
east or west 
  i don t know 
  i don t know 
east or west 
we lost the signal 
we re blind in here 
i don t know 
all right  hang on 
oh  shit 
what  what happened 
what happened 
this is trippy 
doug  look straight ahead 
we ve got the window slaved
to your goggles 
we are seeing what you re
seeing four days in the past 
okay  i got him  i got him 
he s back in range 
he s going west  not east 
on the crescent city bridge 
there he is 
that s him  opposite lane 
i got him 
that s him  that s him 
i got him 
watch the traffic 
what was that 
i think he hit something 
doug  you ve gotta stay with him

yeah  yeah 
where is he 
give us a 360
with the goggle rig 
there  there he is 
pan the thing around 
which way 
to your right 
to your right 
there  there he is 
he s taking
the road to the bayou 
right there 
the road is blocked 
take the expressway 
it parallels the road 
go  go  go 
see him 
pan right  pan right 
you still see him 
he s at the end
of the bridge 
you hear me 
he s at the end of the bridge 
keep talking to me 
i don t know what else
to tell you 
i feel very  very close
to you right now 
he took the exit
ramp beneath you 
take the next off ramp 
take the next off ramp 
all right 
i m on the off ramp 
go right 
then double back on yourself 
all right  i got it 
all right 
take another right 
still see him 
he s heading to the bayou 
take a left here 
good  good  good 
take it easy  doug 
he s dead ahead of you 
okay  okay  okay 
he s slowing down  coming to a fence 
do you see it 
yeah  i see it 
doug  if you re gonna leave
the hummer  take the backpack 
it s the power
source for the rig 
can you hear me 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
yeah  we can hear you 
we can hear you 
all right 
what s he doing now 
he s pulled around
the back of the building 
looks like a bomb went off 
really  we  we see
an intact structure here 
no damage 
no  none 
looks like
a vehicle s inside 
an ambulance 
you see that 
no  nothing 
see anything 
he s dead ahead of you 
doug  he s pulling minuti
out of the car 
where 
all right  now pan to the right 
pan to the right 
  more right 
  you got him 
yeah  he s dragging
him out of the car 
do you see him 
yeah 
yes  right in front of you 
boost the audio for me 
audio boosted 
turn around 
turn around behind you 
larry 
pan back to the right 
you ve got him now 
where is he 
he s being
dragged on the concrete 
larry 
what s that sound 
what s the sound 
he s pouring some kind of
accelerant over agent minuti 
i think it s the diesel fuel 
like at the ferry 
he s waking up 
brace yourselves  i think you re
about to witness a murder 
if we hadn t sent him there 
he wouldn t be dead now 
no  he was already dead from the ferry 
we just changed how he died 
we don t know that 
he could ve been standing
right next to you 
right until we
sent that note 
you d need a branching
multiple universe for that to happen 
oh  come on 
we can t change anything 
we didn t change anything 
that s what i ve been
trying to tell you 
i ll tell you what we did 
the suspect used a stolen
blazer to case the dock 
so now he has
a truck big enough
to drive a bomb
onto the ferry 
now larry shows up  right 
larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield 
you want a mask 
no  no  i m good  thanks 
larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield 
leaves blood all
over the back seat 
so now our bomber
needs a new truck 
you understand 
claire s truck 
you hungry 
yeah  we changed one thing 
but by changing one thing 
we didn t change anything 
what s on tv 
hey  hey  hey 
we got a name 
  carroll oerstadt 
  what 
who is that 
owner of that
bait camp doug found 
truck registration 
airboat registration  match 
and another property 
5874 mullie ave  
ninth ward  new orleans 
is this a he or a she 
it s a he  let s go 
clear 
testing 
one  two  three  four 
testing 
one  two  three  four 
atf new orleans  conducting
interview with carroll oerstadt 
you ve waived your right
to counsel  right 
yes  sir 
okay 
i m fascinated
with your precision 
it s not very often we see that
level of expertise around here 
and if it s all right with you 
i d like to use this interview
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement 
yes  sir 
good  good 
let s talk about motive 
why would you use explosives
against the us navy 
correction  sir 
us government 
us government 
it says here that you tried
to enlist in the marines 
you were rejected 
you tried to enlist in the army 
you were rejected again 
why do you think
they did that 
because they
don t want patriots 
the military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose 
they thought i was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable 
they didn t want to
understand my value 
they understand it now 
i believe so  yes  sir 
you re atf  right 
yes  i am 
got a smoke 
no  i don t 
but i can get you one 
would you like one 
yes 
okay  anything you want to
say  just talk into the mike 
a man can always use more
alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
i can think of
one more thing 
it s like the revolutionary
war  you know what i mean 
 one man s terrorist is another
man s patriot   isn t it 
  yeah 
  exactly 
yeah 
you get it 
this wasn t about revenge 
what was it about 
destiny 
destiny 
you ve been asking me
about my motives 
right  right 
my methods 
they re all connected 
everything s connected 
okay  how was claire
kuchever connected 
i needed a car 
and that s it 
no  well  something
that couldn t be traced back to me 
right 
i had one ready till
that cop showed up 
that cop was a federal agent 
lawrence minuti 
my partner  you shot him 
he    i was about to burn him
and he was waking up  you know 
i mean  i m not cruel 
well  why didn t you  do that 
for claire kuchever 
well  because i needed her
to look like a ferry victim 
and a bullet
would ve given it away 
i see 
i went to her house on the
pretense of buying her car 
i took her from behind 
taped her mouth
and threw
a hood over her head 
then 
i bound her wrists
and her ankles
and i drove her
back to my place 
i loaded
the device into her car
and then i soaked her
with the gasoline 
jesus 
and 
i think you know
what happened after that 
no  i don t know  i want you to tell me 
you gotta talk 
i mean  you know  come on  hero 
what happened after that 
i ll tell you what
happened after that 
you killed 543 people 
how do you feel about that 
i think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning 
sometimes a little human
collateral is the cost of freedom 
to me  those people
were war casualties 
but to you 
they re just evidence 
that ll do  we got him 
what d you say 
you think you know
what s coming 
you don t have a clue 
i know where you re going 
i know you re gonna be away
for a long time  i know that 
this case will
never even go to trial 
no 
uh uh 
 cause i seen what s coming 
did    have you  what 
what is in this glass 
you ve seen
what s coming  huh 
okay  what s coming 
you tell me 
i told you earlier
i have a destiny 
a purpose 
satan reasons like man 
but god thinks of eternity 
well  i prostrate
myself before a world
that s going to hell
in a handbag 
 cause in all eternity  i am
here and i will be remembered 
that s destiny 
a bomb has a destiny 
a predetermined fate set by
the hand of its creator 
and anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed 
anyone who tries to stop it from
happening will cause it to happen 
and that s what
you don t understand 
we re not here to coexist 
i m here to win 
so you d better have some
divine intervention  buddy 
you re gonna need it 
you d better
have some k y 
you re gonna need it 
what am i supposed to do 
we re shutting you down 
what 
yeah  we got what we need 
the forensics  the suspect 
a confession  we re done 
sir  perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime 
the ferry bombing 
right  he s right 
i mean  we  we can t just
go on the confession alone 
we need an airtight case 
we need to collect
more evidence 
well  collecting evidence
would ve been fine  agent carly 
you took it
a little further than that 
agent carlin  carlin 
my name is carlin  not carly 
we had protocols in place 
there s strict protocols 
and then you had to push it 
and now an agent s dead 
sir  by one theory 
that already happened 
we re done 
power it down 
pack it up 
on to the next case 
what about claire 
what   
lookit  charging oerstadt
in the kuchever murder
is gonna raise
too many questions
about how we
obtained the evidence 
i understand that  sir 
but what about claire 
are we just
gonna drop the case 
we got him on
the ferry bombing 
we got him on
killing a federal agent 
that s enough to get him the needle 
i cannot accept that  sir 
well  you know  i don t give a
rat s ass what you can accept 
she doesn t matter 
he s gonna kill her
