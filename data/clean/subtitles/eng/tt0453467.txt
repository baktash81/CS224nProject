to their party
mama
its 1048
on fat tuesday mardi gras
now lets go back
in time to 1964
the beach boys on 1053 fm
the heart of new orleans
well its been
building up inside of me
for oh i dont know
how long
okay take it out wide
give the pig some room
when she says
dont worry baby
dont worry baby
dont worry
dont worry baby
i guess i should have kept
my mouth shut
when i started to brag
about my car
but i cant back down now
because i pushed
the other guys too far
she makes me come alive
and makes me wanna drive
when she says
dont worry baby
dont worry baby
dont worry baby
everything will turn out
all right
dont worry baby
dont worry
my daughters on that ferry
please please
oh god my daughter
do the other side
atf new orleans
agent donnelly
listen
call new orleans pd
i want all surveillance
from the algiers dock
then call city transit
i want the crescent city
bridge surveillance
westbound between
1000 and 1100
all right got it
hey seen an atf
agent around here
yeah
he went down below
how do i get there
the south side
of the bridge
you agent minuti
larry minuti atf
no larrys my partner
im doug carlin
paul pryzwarra fbi
how you doing
wheres minuti
on vacation
not anymore were calling in
half the region on this one
you can uh reach him
i tried hes not
picking up his phone
well try harder
its important
obviously
what are you
looking for
anything that
doesnt belong
you want to give me a spot
uh yeah
anfo
ammonium nitrate
watersoluble
fuel oil would have burned
off during the blast
between the river and the
rain if anfo was used
the only place youd
find it would be
underneath this bridge
thats right
we cant rule out an accident
at this point
its not officially
a crime scene yet
heres a thought
why dont we
double the perimeter
so we dont have walltowall
trailers down there
no were gonna need
all our manpower
for evidence control
and witness processing
now we need to keep it tight
until we can determine that
it is a crime investigation
it is a crime investigation
got a piece of electric blasting
cap and a strand of leg wire
about a million of
those blue particles
washed up on
the algiers side
its probably from a plastic
container or a barrel
anfo
most likely
there was postblast residue
under the crescent
city bridge
the insulation on the
leg wire will inform us
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is
then we go after
the switching mechanism
and the bombs
power source
we probably dont need
to wait for the lab
to tell us what
we already know
that this is an explosive
and a trigger
and you are
oh im sorry
im doug carlin atf
whos in charge
were working on that now

run it forward
what time does it say
thats before the explosion
isnt it
right before
mccready can i have
your attention please
thanks very much for coming
im jack mccready
special agent
in charge of
this investigation
first let me say
our hearts go out
to all of those
affected by this tragedy
early estimates place
the number of casualties
at 543 men
women and children
now lord knows this city
has seen its share of pain
but unlike katrina
this disaster was
not an act of nature
after careful review of evidence
retrieved at the scene
we have concluded this was
a deliberate act of terrorism
and the president concurs
with our assessment
on our end we have to
ask for your patience
as the investigation
will take time
its a unique and complicated
crime scene
theres no baggage checks
theres no flight data recorder
there are maximum casualties
and most of the evidence is
under 100 feet of muddy water
there are no shortcuts
kevin wheres doug
you just missed him
well his cars still here
took the streetcar
what streetcar
hey dont look at me
its part of his process
he says it helps him think
sheriff reed
how you doing
its doug carlin returning your call
hey doug i know you got
your hands full right now
yeah thats okay
what do you got for me bob
well a couple of kids
found a woman
face down in the waters
off algiers point
she was burned
over 30 of her body
right well youre gonna see a lot
of that over the next few weeks
weve just set up ecc
just have crime scene
bag it for us
well we already done that
the bodys at the mes right now
crime scenes
already been there
yeah theyve been and gone
well exactly what time did
this woman wash up on shore
kid called it in
at 1042 am
you mean 1142 dont you
no i mean 1042
i got the sheet right in front of me
and i got my
reading glasses on
immediately evident is the focal
charring of the limbs and torso
anterior face neck and chest
are intact
though swollen from apparent
immersion in water
hold her hand
for me will you
right here
there we go
each digit of the right hand
has been severed
between the middle and
distal phalanges thanks
angle of shearing indicates
a single sharpforce trauma
possibly caused
by shrapnel
no no its too even
to be shrapnel trauma
posterior charring
gives off a strong odor
suggesting perimortem
immersion in burning fuel
diesel
accelerant maybe
i dont know
if she was that close
to the bomb
she probably wouldnt
be laying here now
what are you doing
what are you doing
you got a uv gun
yeah
on the table behind you
you see that
duct tape
mmmhmm
whats that stippling
you see that
adhesive probably retained some
substance against the water
yeah
yeah go ahead
i ran down
those mprs for you
a claire kuchever was reported
missing this morning
supposed to pick up her
father from the airport
pulled a noshow
okay
all right phil i want
you to do a full autopsy
concentrate on
time and cause
full spread of lab tests
everything
just pretend like the ferry explosion
never happened today okay
absolutely
claire

youll need a photograph for
your investigation right
theres plenty in the house
plenty to choose from
mr kuchever

activities over the weekend
or any time anything at
all will be helpful

tuesday 118 pm
yeah this is atf agent doug

woman tuesday 118 pm
yeah this is atf agent doug
carlin returning your call
my cell number
is 5045550130
the blast wave initiated
here hit the bulkhead
and propagated fore and aft along
the path of least resistance
until it hits
this access hatch
uh and thats where
it gets really bad
the blast wave continues
into the engine room
bursting the fuel tanks
this utility shaft here
acts like a chimney
draws the thermal components
into the engine room
which ignites the fuel vapor
causing a secondary explosion
of far greater magnitude
essentially
the initial device
turns the whole ferry
into a bomb
and detonates it
and so our early guess
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or suv
possibly red or tan
mccready make and model
take weeks
maybe months
i got a partial on
the license plate
shit
check all the suvs and minivans
that are registered in the state
anything recently
rented or purchased
anything tied to a theft
or a missing persons report
agent mccready
yeah
doug carlin atf
oh yeah oklahoma city
right thats right
this afternoon
i witnessed an autopsy
of a young woman who washed
up off the poland wharf
heavy fuel burns
traces of petn on her face
petn thats the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists
she also lost several fingers in
what appeared to be blast damage
appeared
thats right i checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast
for her to have washed up that
early and that far upriver
she wouldve had
to have been killed
two hours before
the ferry exploded
before
she died before
the explosion
she died before
the explosion yeah
her name is
claire kuchever
she washed up before the
explosion and against the tide
do you have a scenario
yes i do
i believe that somebody abducted
her in her home taped her mouth
bound her wrists burned her
alive dumped her in the river
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim
a disaster that
hadnt happened yet
but the petn tells us
that the bomber came in direct
contact with the victim
you solve her case
you solve this case
why this woman
good question
her suv is missing
its a tan and red bronco
it could have been stolen to
drive the bomb to the ferry
oh one more thing
the victim called
the local atf office
the morning
of the explosion
yeah
well look into it
okay
all right
okay
wheres larry
what
larry minuti my partner
thats his car right there
is he here
i thought you said
he was on vacation
yeah thats right
what
those cars were brought here from
the algiers ferry parking lot
theyre the vehicles
that belonged to the victims
sorry
so hes a former marine
yes sir yeah local too
hes born and bred
in new orleans
his family
still in the area
nope nothing really
but his job
you like him
hes smart
yeah i like him too
all right
lets go find him
oklahoma city
yeah
you and larry were close
yeah
yeah you know close enough
to get on each others nerves
doug ive been put in charge of a
newlyformed investigative unit
the ferry disaster is our first
case and i want you on the team
why me
weve got some unique
time constraints
i need someone who can look at a
crime scene exactly one time
tell us whats missing tell
us what shouldnt be there
tell us what
we can ignore
and especially
what we need to pursue
also youre local you know the
people and you know the area
but why an atf guy
why not
its your shot
you want to find the guy
who killed minuti dont you
yes i do
i guess youve
got some questions
for me to have questions first
id need to know something
now i do have
some questions
dont touch anything
we dont need you yet
doug you remember
dr alexander denny
wheres my audio
compensating for audio delay
just a second
oh compensating for a technical
blunder by a tech guy
solid stream
minus four days
six hours three
minutes 45 seconds
and 14 and
a half nanoseconds
okay
anytime you want to jump
in here be my guest
me
yeah
what are we looking for
you know clues suspects
anything out of the norm
when was this taken
four and a half
days ago
gunnars try the guy
with the backpack
oh thats tender
i wish i had someone
okay widen out
lets cruise the car deck for
a while see what we got
how can you
change the angle
on footage taken
four and a half days ago
this is a digital recreation
were combining all the data
weve got into one fluid shot
any angle any view
within the target area
okay um
lets cruise the breezeway
see what we get there
its a brandnew program
its called snow white
our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites
but at any given time as many as
four are surveilling one area
its like having
multiple eyewitnesses
each with their
own vantage point
snow white
well which one
of the seven dwarfs
can explain to me
how you get the audio
i dont understand
why do you gotta
look at four days ago
why dont you just fastforward
it to the day of the explosion
we have to wait
it takes four and a half days
to render this
single fluid shot
the only thing
that matters
is that we have exactly
one look at any one time
yeah we cant go back
10 minutes you know
cant look back and see
if there was a second gunman
we cant watch the agent buying
10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983
all right
but given enough lead time
we can look anywhere within
the target area all right
its the when
thats always constant
its always four days
and six hours ago
always you understand
its like a single trailing
moment of now in the past
okay so ifififif you cant
move forward or backward in time
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that
its not the image
thats moving faster
its just our
shifting point of view
the passage of time
remains constant
but we can shift
our point of view
within the data stream
as fast as we want
you understand
yeah yeah no
yeah i know
so four days from
well actually three days from now
since its after midnight
youll be able to look back
to the day of the explosion
see who did it
how they did it
and what they did it with
yeah you got it
the only thing is you need
to tell us where to look
cause you know
we could miss it
besides three days could be
too late he could leave the country
could strike again
we need to do
whatever we can now
we know hes out there
planning this
we just dont
know where to look
so agent carlin
where do we look
claire kuchevers house
address is in range
all right match the viewer
settings to the signal
signals solid
all right dazzle me
what
you see with snow white
we can track through walls
its part of the same infrared
thermalimaging stuff
theyre using in iraq
hello this is 8775048423
we triangulate
from four satellites
pick up the heat signal
and reconstruct
basically
we can walk through walls
claire kuchever
claire hello
did you know her
we held hands once
but no i didnt know her
just checking in
wondering how youre doing
montreals fantastic

seeing but we cant go back
and choose to look
at something different
okay you said we
can record though

in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion all right

ever been used this way
yeah thats kind of a simple
image to go for a match
well we got
nowhere else to go

dotcom for

military helicopters that

thousands of new orleans residents

shanti are we back online
i dont know
something broached the field
what broached the field
that broached the field
right there
that broached the field
right there
thats what
broached the field
now you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is
its not surveillance paul
its not
electronic thermal imaging
you guys have
figured out a way
to look into the past
yes or no
no
youre lying
youre lying
and you know it
ive told you
everything i can
she saw it paul
i pointed this thing at her just now
and she responded to it from
four and a half days ago
explain that to me
all right
somebody explain it
hit it shanti
for three years
cambridge has been working
for national reconnaissance
on an r  d grant
okay
we were attempting to use
concentrated bursts of energy
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes
in the process
we had a breakthrough
given enough energy we could
warp the very fabric of space
i said explain it to me
not talk science
they found a way to
look ill tell you what
why dont you guys just keep talking
ill just sit here
until you figure out what it
is you really wanna tell me
they found a way to fold
space back onto itself
all right look uh were used
to viewing space as flat right
like this piece of paper
right
to see something
from a distance
light has always
had to travel
the long way across
the flat space in between
but given what i
was trying to explain
we can fold the space
bring the target closer to us
create whats known as
an einsteinrosen bridge
otherwise known
as a wormhole
suspend it via
gravitational field
thats what were looking at
thats it
whats on the other end
of the bridge
claires house
wow
basically were folding
space in a higher dimension
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points
instantaneous
well thats what we hoped for
and thats what we expected
but the electrical force
we used huge amounts of
energy to create this bridge
all right how huge
you remember that little blackout
we had a few years back
yes i do
new york blamed canada
right
canada blamed michigan
half the northeast
youre saying you guys
50 million homes right
my bad
well i still say
we blame canada but
okay so why cant
i see this bridge
its not visible to the human eye
i mean its real though
its just as real
and just as solid
as a cell phone signal
or a radio wave
right well i dont know
how a cell phone works
i just know how to use it
so how do we use this
we can look back
four and a half days
and what
we can look anywhere
limited radius
right right right
looking into the past
in a sense were always
looking in the past
even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror
takes some time
to reflect back
let me get this straight
youre trying to tell me that on
the other side of this bridge
is the actual past
yes
wow
yeah but look look look
we created this thing by pure accident
all right
thisthisthis
space and time
thisthis time window
is a complete fluke
all right andand
everybody is terrified
of screwing with it
for fear of losing it
or suffering the consequences
of god knows what
which is why it can only be
used as a retroactive tool
hey let me ask you something
is she alive or is she dead
you went to her funeral doug
i know that
but i think
the question still applies
is she alive
or is she dead
all right
life like time and space
is not merely
a local phenomenon
all right
am i asking a hard question
looks like i picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash
all right
i tell you what
ill speak slow
so those of you
with phds in the room
can understand
it here look
heres a monitor right
now the monitor is broken
its dead
it is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy
its dead right
now is she alive
or is she dead
shes alive
all right
now were getting somewhere
all right now you said light
could go back what else
nothing
something else could be sent back
come on paul something
what a body a human being
no
not a person not alive anyway
why not
because you cant beat the physics
the electromagnetic field
look you transition across
whats known as the wheeler
boundary all right
an em pulse annihilates
all electrical activity
thats your heartbeat thats
brainwaves thats everything
so what youyou
havent tried a person
lets just say that
weve done enough tests
to know that its
not even possible
its not even
theoretically possible
the hamster goes back dead
a drosophila fly dead
what about a radio signal
what about that
we could send a radio
a radio signal
yeah a radio signal
wont work electrical
the field would scramble it
all right then a note a warning note
no
a single piece of paper one sheet
no
if we keep the mass low
no
this could work
it could work
sure we know where
the guys gonna be
we can apprehend him
and put him away
before he even
blows up the boat
and how do we
do that exactly
we send it to ourselves
you send it to me yeah send it to me
send it to my office
send it to my office
four and a half days ago
an anonymous tip and we can capture
this guy before he even meets claire
we know hes
gonna be at the dock
whatever you did
you did it already
whether you send
this note or you
dont send this note
it doesnt matter
you cannot change the past
its physically impossible
what if theres
more than physics
okay
something spiritual right
yeah something spiritual
okay okay okay look
jjust try to
think of it this way
gods mind is made up
about this all right
i mean you know call it fate
call it destiny whatever
but it already happened
it will keep happening
and it always will happen
maybe
and why dont
we call it fate
since were
calling it something
maybemaybe youre right maybe you
guys are exactly right i dont know
all i know is this
for all of my career
ive been trying
to catch people
after they do
something horrible
for once in my life
id like to catch somebody before
they do something horrible
all right
can you understand that
address is in range
two ls
surveilling two ls
since this is such a tremendous
waste of taxpayer money
the least we could do
is get the spelling right
thats not necessarily true
branching universe theory
holds that you can do
oh
branching universe theory
look hold it
all right
no no no
ill show you
the traditional
view of time is linear
like a river flowing from
the past toward the future
but you can change
the course of a river right
exactly introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river
and you create a new branch
still flowing toward the future
but along a different route
changed
yeah but that river
is the mississippi
and were lobbing what
amounts to a pebble into it
thats a very few
tiny ripples in a kind of
big body of water
dont you think
traditionalist
say we do create
this new branch
what happens to the old one
toto this one
ask the radical
well it might continue
parallel to the new branch
but most likely
it ceases to exist
the idea is
we cease to exist
all right
this version of us anyway
you know we never came here
we didnt meet doug
we dont remember
it ever happening
well thats worth
10 billion right there
wouldve been a lot faster
if youd written it yourself
right then i recognize
my own handwriting
and the universe blows up
were ready
all right third floor

he wouldnt be dead now
no he was already dead from the ferry
we just changed how he died
we dont know that
he couldve been standing

right until we
sent that note
youd need a branching
multiple universe for that to happen
oh come on
we cant change anything
we didnt change anything
thats what ive been
trying to tell you
ill tell you what we did
the suspect used a stolen
blazer to case the dock
so now he has
a truck big enough
to drive a bomb
onto the ferry
now larry shows up right
larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield
you want a mask
no no im good thanks
larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield
leaves blood all
over the back seat
so now our bomber
needs a new truck
you understand
claires truck
you hungry
yeah we changed one thing
but by changing one thing
we didnt change anything
whats on tv
hey hey hey
we got a name
carroll oerstadt
what
who is that
owner of that
bait camp doug found
truck registration
airboat registration match
and another property
5874 mullie ave
ninth ward new orleans
is this a he or a she
its a he lets go
clear
testing
one two three four
testing
one two three four
atf new orleans conducting
interview with carroll oerstadt
youve waived your right
to counsel right
yes sir
okay
im fascinated
with your precision
its not very often we see that
level of expertise around here
and if its all right with you
id like to use this interview
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement
yes sir
good good
lets talk about motive
why would you use explosives
against the us navy
correction sir
us government
us government
it says here that you tried
to enlist in the marines
you were rejected
you tried to enlist in the army
you were rejected again
why do you think
they did that
because they
dont want patriots
the military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose
they thought i was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable
they didnt want to
understand my value
they understand it now
i believe so yes sir
youre atf right
yes i am
got a smoke
no i dont
but i can get you one
would you like one
yes
okay anything you want to
say just talk into the mike
a man can always use more
alcohol tobacco and firearms
i can think of
one more thing
its like the revolutionary
war you know what i mean
one mans terrorist is another
mans patriot isnt it
yeah
exactly
yeah
you get it
this wasnt about revenge
what was it about
destiny
destiny
youve been asking me
about my motives
right right
my methods
theyre all connected
everythings connected
okay how was claire
kuchever connected
i needed a car
and thats it
no well something
that couldnt be traced back to me
right
i had one ready till
that cop showed up
that cop was a federal agent
lawrence minuti
my partner you shot him
he i was about to burn him
and he was waking up you know
i mean im not cruel
well why didnt you do that
for claire kuchever
well because i needed her
to look like a ferry victim
and a bullet
wouldve given it away
i see
i went to her house on the
pretense of buying her car
i took her from behind
taped her mouth
and threw
a hood over her head
then
i bound her wrists
and her ankles
and i drove her
back to my place
i loaded
the device into her car
and then i soaked her
with the gasoline
jesus
and
i think you know
what happened after that
no i dont know i want you to tell me
you gotta talk
i mean you know come on hero
what happened after that
ill tell you what
happened after that
you killed 543 people
how do you feel about that
i think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning
sometimes a little human
collateral is the cost of freedom
to me those people
were war casualties
but to you
theyre just evidence
thatll do we got him
whatd you say
you think you know
whats coming
you dont have a clue
i know where youre going
i know youre gonna be away
for a long time i know that
this case will
never even go to trial
no
uhuh
cause i seen whats coming
did have you what
what is in this glass
youve seen
whats coming huh
okay whats coming
you tell me
i told you earlier
i have a destiny
a purpose
satan reasons like man
but god thinks of eternity
well i prostrate
myself before a world
thats going to hell
in a handbag
cause in all eternity i am
here and i will be remembered
thats destiny
a bomb has a destiny
a predetermined fate set by
the hand of its creator
and anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed
anyone who tries to stop it from
happening will cause it to happen
and thats what
you dont understand
were not here to coexist
im here to win
so youd better have some
divine intervention buddy
youre gonna need it
youd better
have some ky
youre gonna need it
what am i supposed to do
were shutting you down
what
yeah we got what we need
the forensics the suspect
a confession were done
sir perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime
the ferry bombing
right hes right
i mean wewe cant just
go on the confession alone
we need an airtight case
we need to collect
more evidence
well collecting evidence
wouldve been fine agent carly
you took it
a little further than that
agent carlin carlin
my name is carlin not carly
we had protocols in place
theres strict protocols
and then you had to push it
and now an agents dead
sir by one theory
that already happened
were done
power it down
pack it up
on to the next case
what about claire
what
lookit charging oerstadt
in the kuchever murder
is gonna raise
too many questions
about how we
obtained the evidence
i understand that sir
but what about claire
are we just
gonna drop the case
we got him on
the ferry bombing
we got him on
killing a federal agent
thats enough to get him the needle
i cannot accept that sir
well you know i dont give a
rats ass what you can accept
she doesnt matter
hes gonna kill her
in 12 hours
hes gonna kill her
he killed her four days ago
you were at the funeral
whats wrong with you
it had to happen
i delayed turning in my report
till we caught the guy
hey mission accomplished
this is a victory doug
hey now my job
is closure
your job is to help
facilitate that closure
then you tell me
what do i tell her father
we caught the son of a bitch
we cant save the victims
its not our job to make
the relatives feel better
we lose everything that we care about
those are your words
doug its not your fault
that claire dies
yeah thats one theory
