squeal 
squeal like a pig 
the police have ways
to determine foul play   
do you remember that fire
in ängby 
a house burned down
and a body was found inside 
we knew that the fire
had been set
to conceal the fact
that the person had been
murdered beforehand 
so  how could they know that 
well    go ahead 
there was no smoke in the lungs
of the person who died 
that s correct 
did you figure that out
right now 
no  i read a lot   
what kind of books
would that be 
just books 
okay    i m going to talk to you
about drugs 
what do you think are the most common
types of drugs   
hey  oskar   
what are you staring at 
are you looking at me 
well  fuck off 
oink

in the jungle gym 
seriously  where do you live 
next door to you 
how do you know where i live 
just so you know 
i can t be your friend 
what do you mean 
does there have to be a reason 
that s just the way it is 
are you so sure
that i want to be your friend 
you re supposed to help me 
do i really have to
take care of this myself 
say something 
forgive me 
they don t know why
the boy was killed 
i realize that many of you
may be worried 
the counselor
will be here all day
so go talk to her
if you feel the need 
any questions 
is it all right to kill the killer
if you happen to meet him 
that wasn t very nice  conny 
oskar

the subway two stations 
or walking a mile 
no  oskar will be staying
with his dad next week 
killer taps blood
victim s blood was tapped
  hi 
  if it isn t my little honey bunny
