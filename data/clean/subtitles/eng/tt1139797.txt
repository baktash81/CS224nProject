squeal
squeal like a pig
the police have ways
to determine foul play
do you remember that fire
in ängby
a house burned down
and a body was found inside
we knew that the fire
had been set
to conceal the fact
that the person had been
murdered beforehand
so how could they know that
well go ahead
there was no smoke in the lungs
of the person who died
thats correct
did you figure that out
right now
no i read a lot
what kind of books
would that be
just books
okay im going to talk to you
about drugs
what do you think are the most common
types of drugs
hey oskar

hi
if it isnt my little honey bunny
the death penalty
has no justification
in a society based on the rule of law
based on the rule of law
