what is it
its a data stream from ps12
where is she
right above sector 14
there isnt anything in sector 14
there is now
hello
miss woods pleasure to speak to you
who is this
my names maxwell stafford
i represent weyland industries
let me guess hes suing us again
you misunderstand
mr weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year if youll meet with him
when
tomorrow
tomorrows gonna be a problem
take me a week to get back to the world
yes i told mr weyland that
he said he didnt have a week
we must be right on top of it
what is it sebastian
the burial chamber is here
i know it we are gonna find it
i know it too but without a crew
and a permit were out of business
hold the team together for two days
ill go to mexico city and ill talk to the bank
ill get us more money
i might be able to help you
accomplish that professor
do i know you
in exchange for a little of your time
oh im sorry
i shouldve switched the flash off
theres your magazine excuse me
thats ok
im documenting the trip for my boys
this is them
jacob and scotty
would you mind taking a picture
thank you
just wanna show them
that their dad wasnt always so boring
smile
ok
there you go
thank you
im graeme miller im a chemical engineer
alexa woods
environmental technician and guide
do you work for weyland
oh no
no i split my time between working
for a small environmental group
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice
lex buckle up
were gonna hit some turbulence
thanks jack
is he a friend of yours
of my dads
he trained most of the pilots here
just passed the psr
oh damn i wish id got a picture
of what
the psr
i wish hed called it out before we passed it
the psr is the point of safe return
it means weve used up half our fuel
so we cant turn back
right but if something went wrong
we could land presumably
we could ditch
yeah ditch
but the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes
welcome aboard everybody please
some of you may be wondering
why this team has been assembled
your host will give you the answer now
mr weyland
seven days ago one of my satellites
over antarctica hunting for mineral deposits
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth which outlined this
the red lines indicate solid walls
through thermal mapping weve generated
a threedimensional image of the structure
its massive containing hundreds of rooms
all built around a central core
my experts tell me its a pyramid
what they cant agree on
is who built it and when
one expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the aztecs
another tells me its probably cambodian
what they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively egyptian
i think your experts are right
which one
all of them
meaning what exactly
this pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures
this might be the first pyramid ever built
but built by whom
by the first civilisation
thank you
but how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here
ancient maps show antarctica free of ice
its likely the continent was once habitable
i cant tell you who built it
but if i could take a sample from it
i can tell you how old it is
dr miller im offering
to put you right next to this thing
what caused the heat bloom
i dont know
where exactly on the ice is this
bouvetøya island
but its not on the ice its 2000ft below it
mr quinn
mr stafford
youre looking at the best drilling team in the
world well chew to that depth in seven days
add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here
we dont have that kind of time ms woods
im not the only one
with a satellite over antarctica
others will be here soon
maybe i wasnt clear
no one in this room is ready for this trip
thats why i asked you here
bouvetøya is one of the worlds most isolated
places the nearest land is 1000 miles away
theres no help if we run into trouble
youre right its a nomansland
but the train has left the station
and i think i speak
for everyone aboard this ship
this is worth the risk
find another guide
ive spoken with mr weyland
moneys been wired to your account
choppers refuelling to fly you home
whod you get
gerald murdoch
come in
murdoch has two seasons of ice time
hes not ready
dont worry about it
what about paul woodman
we called him
he gave the same bullshit answer you did
bullshit
what i told you in there wasnt bullshit if you
rush this people will get hurt maybe die
i dont understand
were not asking you to take us up everest
we need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid and back thats it
what about inside the pyramid
dont worry about that
once were on the site we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy
is this new
its the latest
mr weyland when i lead my team
i dont ever leave my team
i admire your passion
i wish you were going with us
youre making a mistake
its in the upper atmosphere
streams of protons
and electrons from the sun
being deflected by the earths magnetic
field causing a solar radiation storm
shackleton called antarctica
the last great journey left to man
its the one place left in the world
that no one owns
its completely free
me im sort of partial to the penguins
i wish youd reconsider coming with us lex
come on dont make me pull out
pictures of my kids again
your kids arent that cute
what if we got pictures
of other peoples kids
want my advice
stay on the boat
ok let me ask you something
do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you
or with the numbertwo choice
miss woods your helicopters refuelled
theyre waiting for you
everybody listen up
gather round
told you shed stay
she cant resist my animal magnetism
laugh it up miller laugh it up
gentlemen
it is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition
and i need your help to do that
since i dont have time to properly train you
im laying down three rules
one no one goes anywhere alone ever
two
everyone must maintain
constant communication
three unexpected things are gonna happen
when they do no one tries to be a hero
understood
yes maam
good
seven seasons on the ice
and ive never seen a gun save someones life
i dont plan on using it
then why bring it
same principle as a condom
id rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one
im glad that you decided to stay
move the trucks out on the ice
move that ok lets move
whats with the bottle cap
what
whats with the bottle cap
this is a valuable archaeological find
when i was a kid growing up in italy
you know what they call a moon that big
la luna del cacciatore
brava
whats that
hunters moon
hunters moon
hold it guys
keep those engines running
set it down
move over a little further connors
its an abandoned whaling station
according to your satellite imagery
the pyramid is located directly beneath it
all right bring it up come on
spread out
well use this place as a base camp mr quinn
begin drilling operations as soon as you can
im on it ok guys lets move out
what are these
whale bones
this station was abandoned in 1904
everyone just disappeared overnight
it was a big mystery back then
one for national geographic
lex
no one goes anywhere alone
theres something there listen listen
careful they bite
over here over here
what is it
can you believe that
its drilled at a perfect 30degree angle
how far does it go down
all the way to the pyramid
there it is clear as day
and the same time yesterday
nothing
how was it done
thermal equipment of some kind
like yours
more advanced incredibly powerful
ive never seen anything like it
theres no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours
well the only way were gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out
look at that change it now
ok guys whats taking so long
theres a storm coming
theres no room for sick men
on this expedition
my doctors tell me the worst is behind me
youre not a very good liar mr weyland
stay on the ship
well update you at the top of every hour
when you get sick you think about your life
and how youre gonna be remembered
you know what will happen when i go
ten per cent fall in share prices
maybe 12 thats it
ive heard this speech before
my dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of mount rainier
he was like you
he wouldnt go back or let us stop
we reached the top
and he opened a bottle of champagne
i had my first drink with my dad at 14400ft
on the way down he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung
he suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base
you think thats the last thing
your dad remembers the pain
or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14000ft in the air
i need this
come on move
shit
mr weyland
man down
get him somebody get him
move it
now
i dont understand it
no equipment no sign of another team
well that tunnel didnt dig itself
move it connors get those lights up
we have power
congratulations mr weyland
looks like youll be
leaving your mark after all
thank you thank you
thank you all for this
lets make history
thomas
what is it
i recognise the egyptian
the second symbol is aztec
preconquest era the third is cambodian
then you were right
the pyramid contains all three cultures
thats what it looks like
you may choose to enter
those who choose may enter
who taught you to translate
funny kinda looked like you
well its not choose
its chosen
only the chosen ones may enter
quinn is that you out there
mikkel
what is all this
this is the sacrificial chamber
like the aztecs and the egyptians
whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice
this is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods
those that were chosen would lie here
they werent bound or tied in any way
they went to die willingly
men and women
it was considered an honour
lucky them
they gave their lives
so the hunt could begin
what happened here
its common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim
thats nice
but thats not where your heart is
besides it looks like the bones
were bent straight out
something broke out of this body
what have you found max
its a shaft to another level
looks like theres another room down there
lets move to that lower room
were moving on everyone
ms woods
you stay here rousseau you stay with him
keep a team with you
catalogue everything
professor
this should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber
sebastian
its a sarcophagus
this is the long count
this is the aztec calendar
and this its some kind of combination lock
days
months
years
the dials are set for
someone opened this 100 years ago
whats todays date
october 10
are you sure this is gonna work
i dont know
back up
oh my god take a look at this
any idea what these are
no
you
no
its a good thing we brought the experts
well yeah it is a good thing
cos this is like finding
moses dvd collection
weyland
a little too much excitement
weve been out long enough for today
well set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning
well you can go back to the base camp
ms woods but were staying here
no you wanted to leave
without proper prep we did
you wanted to be the first here we are
youve claimed the find its yours
now we move as a team
and were done for the day
you heard her
what do you wanna do with these
take them
well run further tests on the surface
no no dont touch them
watch out
the doors
the door
you ok
yeah
slabs gotta weigh two tons
well never move it
what did you say this room was called
sacrificial chamber
rousseau
tommy come in
come in rousseau
come in
is there anything you didnt tell me
nothing your guess is as good as mine
whatever it is were not prepared
were gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface lets move
what are you doing
my job yours is over
my job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely
and that gun doesnt change anything
this bearing should take us back to the
entrance well regroup at the whaling station
what about thomas rousseau
well find them on the way up
max
stone verheiden cover our backs
the heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now
what do you mean
a building this sophisticated
requires an energy source
i think thats what your satellite detected
a power plant for this pyramid firing up
preparing
preparing for what
gentlemen
keep close
recognise whats on their shoulders
yeah
we worshipped these things
according to this we did
and the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons
lets keep moving
only another 200 yards to the entrance
take cover
wheres stone
stone
the pyramids shifting again
the doors are closing get out
come on
ok lets go
lets go lets go
hey verheiden
verheiden
somebody
run lets go
no
quickly
no no
hey can you hear me
its connors where are you
were never getting out of this place
have you got any children
got a son
yeah ive got two
that means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting
were gonna make it outta here
were surviving this
if i have to carry you the whole way
theres no way out back there
whats that
just a theory
the aztec calendar was metric
based on multiples of ten
im guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes
lets stick together
weyland
it would seem that we are rats in a maze
sorry
connors connors
verheiden verheiden
oh god
dr miller get me outta here
its ok im gonna find a way
to get down to you ok
verheiden
no
you want a piece of me
you ugly son of a bitch
oh god
weyland
you ok
yeah im fine
leave it they can only slow us down
too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing
give it to me
max
hold on
look out
come on we have to get weyland
weyland come on
what were they
youre the expert
ive got to stop ive got to stop
take it easy weyland
look at me
you have to slow your breathing down
slow steady breaths
weyland come on
i can hardly stand
im not gonna let you die down here
you didnt
theres another one we have to go now
weyland
come with us
get her outta here
now
come on
run
dont turn your back on me
wait
this way
go go
look over here
hes marking himself
what
ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill
its a rite of passage
this is starting to make sense
the hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out
but the story is all here
thousands of years ago
these hunters found a backwater planet
they taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods
every hundred years the gods would return
and when they did
they would expect a sacrifice
humans were used to breed the ultimate prey
the hunters would battle
with these great serpents
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark
but if the hunters lost
they made sure nothing survived
an entire civilisation wiped out overnight
so
the humanoids the hunters
they brought those creatures here to hunt
and they use us like cattle
were hosts for them to breed in
the heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here
this whole thing was a trap
without us there could be no hunt
shit
verheiden
oh shit
when that door opens were dead
not if we set things right
what do you mean
this pyramid is like a prison
we took the guards guns
and now the prisoners are running free
to restore order the guards need their guns
when that door opens
were gonna give that thing his gun back
are you crazy during a biggame hunt the
animals being hunted dont arm the hunters
theyre not hunting us
were in the middle of a war
its time to pick a side
we are on our side
we have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here
but we have to make sure
those serpents dont reach the surface
because if they do
everything everywhere could die
the enemy of my enemy
is my friend
lets go find our friend
how do you say scared shitless in italian
non vedo lora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso
more or less
move
lex
hold on
come on lex
oh no
wait wait please wait
the enemy of my enemy is my friend
im coming with you
you hear me you ugly creature
what are you doing
miller
sebastian
help me lex
im gonna get you out of there
its too late its inside me
im gonna get you outta here
you cant
no
no no no no
i have to help him
lex
they mustnt reach the surface
i know
