what is it 
it s a data stream from ps12 
where is she 
right above sector 14 
there isn t anything in sector 14 
there is now 
hello 
miss woods  pleasure to speak to you 
who is this 
my name s maxwell stafford 
i represent weyland industries 
let me guess  he s suing us again 
you misunderstand 
mr weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year  if you ll meet with him 
when 
tomorrow 
tomorrow s gonna be a problem 
take me a week to get back to the world 
yes  i told mr weyland that 
he said he didn t have a week 
we must be right on top of it 
what is it  sebastian 
the burial chamber is here 
i know it  we are gonna find it 
i know it too  but without a crew
and a permit we re out of business 
hold the team together for two days 
i ll go to mexico city and i ll talk to the bank 
i ll get us more money 
i might be able to help you
accomplish that  professor 
do i know you 
in exchange for a little of your time 
oh  i m sorry 
i should ve switched the flash off 
there s your magazine  excuse me 
that s ok 
i m documenting the trip for my boys 
this is them 
jacob and scotty 
would you mind taking a picture 
thank you 
just wanna show them
that their dad wasn t always so boring 
smile 
ok 
there you go 
thank you 
i m graeme miller  i m a chemical engineer 
alexa woods 
environmental technician and guide 
do you work for weyland 
oh  no 
no  i split my time between working
for a small environmental group
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice 
lex  buckle up 
we re gonna hit some turbulence 
thanks  jack 
is he a friend of yours 
of my dad s 
he trained most of the pilots here 
just passed the psr 
oh  damn  i wish i d got a picture 
of what 
the psr 
i wish he d called it out before we passed it 
the psr is the point of safe return 
it means we ve used up half our fuel 
so we can t turn back 
right  but if something went wrong 
we could land  presumably 
we could ditch 
yeah  ditch 
but the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes 
welcome aboard  everybody  please 
some of you may be wondering
why this team has been assembled 
your host will give you the answer now 
mr weyland 
seven days ago  one of my satellites
over antarctica hunting for mineral deposits
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth  which outlined this 
the red lines indicate solid walls 
through thermal mapping  we ve generated
a three dimensional image of the structure 
it s massive  containing hundreds of rooms 
all built around a central core 
my experts tell me it s a pyramid 
what they can t agree on
is who built it and when 
one expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the aztecs 
another tells me it s probably cambodian 
what they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively egyptian 
i think your experts are right 
which one 
all of them 
meaning what  exactly 
this pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures 
this might be the first pyramid ever built 
but built by whom 
by the first civilisation 
thank you 
but how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here 
ancient maps show antarctica free of ice 
it s likely the continent was once habitable 
i can t tell you who built it 
but if i could take a sample from it 
i can tell you how old it is 
dr miller  i m offering
to put you right next to this thing 
what caused the heat bloom 
i don t know 
where exactly on the ice is this 
bouvetøya island 
but it s not on the ice  it s 2 000ft below it 
mr quinn 
mr stafford 
you re looking at the best drilling team in the
world  we ll chew to that depth in seven days 
add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here 
we don t have that kind of time  ms woods 
i m not the only one
with a satellite over antarctica 
others will be here soon 
maybe i wasn t clear 
no one in this room is ready for this trip 
that s why i asked you here 
bouvetøya is one of the world s most isolated
places  the nearest land is 1000 miles away 
there s no help if we run into trouble 
you re right  it s a no man s land 
but the train has left the station 
and i think i speak
for everyone aboard this ship 
this is worth the risk 
find another guide 
i ve spoken with mr weyland 
money s been wired to your account 
chopper s refuelling to fly you home 
who d you get 
gerald murdoch 
come in 
murdoch has two seasons of ice time 
he s not ready 
don t worry about it 
what about paul woodman 
we called him 
he gave the same bullshit answer you did 
 bullshit  
what i told you in there wasn t bullshit  if you
rush this  people will get hurt  maybe die 
i don t understand 
we re not asking you to take us up everest 
we need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid  and back  that s it 
what about inside the pyramid 
don t worry about that 
once we re on the site  we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy 
is this new 
it s the latest 
mr weyland  when i lead my team
i don t ever leave my team 
i admire your passion 
i wish you were going with us 
you re making a mistake 
it s in the upper atmosphere 
streams of protons
and electrons from the sun
being deflected by the earth s magnetic
field  causing a solar radiation storm 
shackleton called antarctica
 the last great journey left to man  
it s the one place left in the world
that no one owns 
it s completely free 
me  i m sort of partial to the penguins 
i wish you d reconsider coming with us  lex 
come on  don t make me pull out
pictures of my kids again 
your kids aren t that cute 
what if we got pictures
of other people s kids 
want my advice 
stay on the boat 
ok  let me ask you something 
do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you
or with the number two choice 
miss woods  your helicopter s refuelled 
they re waiting for you 
everybody  listen up 
gather round 
told you she d stay 
she can t resist my animal magnetism 
laugh it up  miller  laugh it up 
gentlemen 
it is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition 
and i need your help to do that 
since i don t have time to properly train you 
i m laying down three rules 
one  no one goes anywhere alone  ever 
two 
everyone must maintain
constant communication 
three  unexpected things are gonna happen 
when they do  no one tries to be a hero 
understood 
yes  ma am 
good 
seven seasons on the ice
and i ve never seen a gun save someone s life 
i don t plan on using it 
then why bring it 
same principle as a condom 
i d rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one 
i m glad that you decided to stay 
move the trucks out on the ice 
move that  ok  let s move 
what s with the bottle cap 
what 
what s with the bottle cap 
this is a valuable archaeological find 
when i was a kid growing up in italy 
you know what they call a moon that big 
la luna del cacciatore 
brava 
what s that 
hunter s moon 
hunter s moon 
hold it  guys 
keep those engines running 
set it down 
move over a little further  connors 
it s an abandoned whaling station 
according to your satellite imagery 
the pyramid is located directly beneath it 
all right  bring it up  come on 
spread out 
we ll use this place as a base camp  mr quinn 
begin drilling operations as soon as you can 
i m on it  ok  guys  let s move out 
what are these 
whale bones 
this station was abandoned in 1904 
everyone just disappeared overnight 
it was a big mystery back then 
one for national geographic 
lex 
no one goes anywhere alone 
there s something there  listen  listen 
careful  they bite 
over here  over here 
what is it 
can you believe that 
it s drilled at a perfect 30 degree angle 
how far does it go down 
all the way to the pyramid 
there it is  clear as day 
and the same time yesterday   
nothing 
how was it done 
thermal equipment of some kind 
like yours 
more advanced  incredibly powerful 
i ve never seen anything like it 
there s no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours 
well  the only way we re gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out 
look at that  change it  now 
ok  guys  what s taking so long 
there s a storm coming 
there s no room for sick men
on this expedition 
my doctors tell me the worst is behind me 
you re not a very good liar  mr weyland 
stay on the ship 
we ll update you at the top of every hour 
when you get sick  you think about your life
and how you re gonna be remembered 
you know what will happen when i go 
ten per cent fall in share prices 
maybe 12  that s it 
i ve heard this speech before 
my dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of mount rainier 
he was like you 
he wouldn t go back or let us stop 
we reached the top 
and he opened a bottle of champagne 
i had my first drink with my dad at 14400ft 
on the way down  he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung 
he suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base 
you think that s the last thing
your dad remembers  the pain 
or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14000ft in the air 
i need this 
come on  move 
shit 
mr weyland 
man down 
get him  somebody get him 
move it 
now 
i don t understand it 
no equipment  no sign of another team 
well  that tunnel didn t dig itself 
move it  connors  get those lights up 
we have power 
congratulations  mr weyland 
looks like you ll be
leaving your mark after all 
thank you  thank you 
thank you all for this 
let s make history 
thomas 
what is it 
i recognise the egyptian   
the second symbol is aztec 
pre conquest era  the third is cambodian 
then you were right 
the pyramid contains all three cultures 
that s what it looks like 
 you may choose to enter  
 those who choose may enter  
who taught you to translate 
funny  kinda looked like you 
well  it s not  choose  
it s  chosen  
 only the chosen ones may enter  
quinn  is that you out there 
mikkel 
what is all this 
this is the sacrificial chamber 
like the aztecs and the egyptians 
whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice 
this is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods 
those that were chosen would lie here 
they weren t bound or tied in any way 
they went to die willingly 
men and women 
it was considered an honour 
lucky them 
 they gave their lives
so the hunt could begin  
what happened here 
it s common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim 
that s nice 
but that s not where your heart is 
besides  it looks like the bones
were bent straight out 
something broke out of this body 
what have you found  max 
it s a shaft to another level 
looks like there s another room down there 
let s move to that lower room 
we re moving on  everyone 
ms woods 
you  stay here  rousseau  you stay with him 
keep a team with you 
catalogue everything 
professor 
this should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber 
sebastian 
it s a sarcophagus 
this is the long count 
this is the aztec calendar 
and this  it s some kind of combination lock 
 days  
 months  
 years  
the dials are set for   
1904 
someone opened this 100 years ago 
what s today s date 
october 10 
10 10 2004 
are you sure this is gonna work 
i don t know 
back up 
oh  my god  take a look at this 
any idea what these are 
no 
you 
no 
it s a good thing we brought the experts 
well  yeah  it is a good thing 
cos this is like finding
moses  dvd collection 
weyland 
a little too much excitement 
we ve been out long enough for today 
we ll set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning 
well  you can go back to the base camp 
ms woods  but we re staying here 
no  you wanted to leave
without proper prep  we did 
you wanted to be the first here  we are 
you ve claimed the find  it s yours 
now  we move as a team 
and we re done for the day 
you heard her 
what do you wanna do with these 
take them 
we ll run further tests on the surface 
no  no  don t touch them 
watch out 
the doors 
the door 
you ok 
yeah 
slab s gotta weigh two tons 
we ll never move it 
what did you say this room was called 
sacrificial chamber 
rousseau 
tommy  come in 
come in  rousseau 
come in 
is there anything you didn t tell me 
nothing  your guess is as good as mine 
whatever it is  we re not prepared 
we re gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface  let s move 
what are you doing 
my job  yours is over 
my job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely 
and that gun doesn t change anything 
this bearing should take us back to the
entrance  we ll regroup at the whaling station 
what about thomas  rousseau 
we ll find them on the way up 
max 
stone  verheiden  cover our backs 
the heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now 
what do you mean 
a building this sophisticated
requires an energy source 
i think that s what your satellite detected 
a power plant for this pyramid firing up 
preparing 
preparing  for what 
gentlemen 
keep close 
recognise what s on their shoulders 
yeah 
we worshipped these things 
according to this  we did 
and the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons 
let s keep moving 
only another 200 yards to the entrance 
take cover 
where s stone 
stone 
the pyramid s shifting again 
the doors are closing  get out 
come on 
ok  let s go 
let s go  let s go 
hey  verheiden 
verheiden 
somebody 
run  let s go 
no 
quickly 
no  no 
hey  can you hear me 
it s connors  where are you 
we re never getting out of this place 
have you got any children 
got a son 
yeah  i ve got two 
that means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting 
we re gonna make it outta here 
we re surviving this
if i have to carry you the whole way 
there s no way out back there 
what s that 
just a theory 
the aztec calendar was metric 
based on multiples of ten 
i m guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes 
let s stick together 
weyland 
it would seem that we are rats in a maze 
sorry 
connors  connors 
verheiden  verheiden 
oh  god 
dr miller  get me outta here 
it s ok  i m gonna find a way
to get down to you  ok 
verheiden 
no 
you want a piece of me 
you ugly son of a bitch 
oh  god 
weyland 
you ok 
yeah  i m fine 
leave it  they can only slow us down 
too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing 
give it to me 
max 
hold on 
look out 
come on  we have to get weyland 
weyland  come on 
what were they 
you re the expert 
i ve got to stop  i ve got to stop 
take it easy  weyland 
look at me 
you have to slow your breathing down 
slow  steady breaths 
weyland  come on 
i can hardly stand 
i m not gonna let you die down here 
you didn t 
there s another one  we have to go  now 
weyland 
come with us 
get her outta here 
now 
come on 
run 
don t turn your back on me 
wait 
this way 
go  go 
look over here 
he s marking himself 
what 
ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill 
it s a rite of passage 
this is starting to make sense 
the hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out 
but the story is all here 
thousands of years ago 
these hunters found a backwater planet 
they taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods 
every hundred years the gods would return 
and when they did 
they would expect a sacrifice 
humans were used to breed the ultimate prey 
the hunters would battle
with these great serpents
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark 
but if the hunters lost 
they made sure nothing survived 
an entire civilisation wiped out overnight 
so   
the humanoids  the hunters  
they brought those creatures here to hunt 
and they use us like cattle 
we re hosts for them to breed in 
the heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here 
this whole thing was a trap 
without us  there could be no hunt 
shit 
verheiden 
oh  shit 
when that door opens  we re dead 
not if we set things right 
what do you mean 
this pyramid is like a prison 
we took the guards  guns 
and now the prisoners are running free 
to restore order  the guards need their guns 
when that door opens 
we re gonna give that thing his gun back 
are you crazy  during a big game hunt  the
animals being hunted don t arm the hunters 
they re not hunting us 
we re in the middle of a war 
it s time to pick a side 
we are on our side 
we have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here 
but we have to make sure
those serpents don t reach the surface 
because if they do 
everything everywhere could die 
the enemy of my enemy   
is my friend 
let s go find our friend 
how do you say  scared shitless  in italian 
non vedo l ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso 
more or less 
move 
lex 
hold on 
come on  lex 
oh  no 
wait  wait  please  wait 
the enemy of my enemy is my friend 
i m coming with you 
you hear me  you ugly creature 
what are you doing 
miller 
sebastian 
help me  lex 
i m gonna get you out of there 
it s too late  it s inside me 
i m gonna get you outta here 
you can t   
no 
no  no  no  no 
i have to help him 
lex 
they mustn t reach the surface 
i know
