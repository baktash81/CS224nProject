  out in the starlight  
  just like we used to do  
  i m always walking
after midnight  
  searching for you     
this is a true story 
but i can t believe
it s really happening 
it s a murder story  too 
i can t believe my luck 
and a love story 
of all strange things 
i know the murderer 
i know the murderee 
i know the time 
i know the place 
i know the motive 
and i know the means 
i know who will be the foil 
the fool  and the poor foal 
i couldn t stop them
even if i wanted to 
you 
always you 
you can t stop people
once they start 
please   
you can t stop people
once they start creating 
it all started three weeks ago
when i flew in on
a red eye from new york 
nobody in their right mind
wants to come
to london right now 
they re afraid
the crisis is going
to reach a conclusion 
that everything s going
to fall into chaos 
i thought i would be able
to find something
to write about 
see  i write fiction 
but my novels  um   
aren t really fiction 
you have arrived
at your destination 
you know  uh 
not many people rushin  in
to merry ol  london town
these days 
i answered
a personal ad
in the new york review
of books 
the celebrated writer
mark asprey
was offering up his apartment
for a swap 
he would have been
overwhelmed with responses
if it weren t for the crisis 
instead  poor mark ended up
with my shithole
in hell s kitchen 
well  fuck me 
and i got the keys
to his inspiring
three bedroom flat
in the heart of london 
mr  samson young 
mr  mark asprey here 
checking in to see
if you survived
your plane trip  mate 
make yourself at home 
do feel free  by the way 
to touch everything 
everything in that place
has inspired a book
in some way 
or a million sales at least 
and i hope it does that
for you  i really do 
i i m sorry
it s not all finished 
you know  i m refurbishing
the building
but this bloody
panic everywhere 
you just can t get
all the stuff you need
no matter how much money
you throw at the problem 
i left a copy of my
third novel on the desk 
crossbone waters 
it never hurts
to reread the classics
for a spot of inspiration 
your place is just phenomenal 
i had no idea
this would be so   
wonderfully diminished 
as you know 
my latest character
lives in hell s kitchen 
and i think i might
make him even poorer 
it s just going
to be delicious 
and i can t thank you enough 
oh  i just hope
you enjoy yourself 
hey  tiger 
oh  yes 
i do hope you get a chance
to enjoy the mirrors 
i do 
anyway  see you  mate

and you want the whole story 
well  where do you go

from me old loan shark

i ve lived down the road
for over a year now 
and this is the first time
i ve been in here

i suppose this is   
by way of having been
at a wake 
yeah  weren t family 
was he 
not anyone i knew very well 
still  does you credit 
no  shows respect 
don t it 
here we are
at the event horizon
of a black hole 
anything  including
matter and photons 
that pass this boundary
are unable to escape 
a black veil 
it s ironic
how becoming it is 
one never gets enough
opportunity to wear one 
people should die
more often 
what s your name 
sweetheart 
nicola six

yeah  she s begging for it 
she s just been
to a funeral  keith 
well  then
she s praying for it 
life fucking goes on 
don t it  eh 
with keith and guy 
i had two promising
story characters 
two men forming
a social contrast 
but none of this would have
started without the girl 
there was no book
without the girl 
you know  they say
the first thing that will go
with the hot sun
will be the flowers 
won t be any more flowers 
now  i see
a girl like you 
you know  bit of a beauty 
head in the clouds  as such 
now  me  i m handy andy 
you know  i m mr  fixit 
so what s your
phone number  nick 
of all things  she lives
in my building 
remarkable 
the pain kit
from dr  slizzard
arrived in good time 
like a box of candy 
why can t i do it 
why can t i just write 
i write  i m a writer 
from the moment
nicola s thoughts began
to be consecutive 
she knew two strange things 
i ve always known
what was going to happen next 
the second was that
she must never tell anyone
about the first 
hers was a specific kind
of fortune telling 
nicola saw the death
of many  many things 
she knew her young friend
dominique
would fall to her death 
how painful  i was
prepared for mom and dad 
she knew her parents
would die in a plane crash 
they both died 
together 
as i always knew they would 
so why love anyone 
i met the surviving
pilot and slept with him 
if the crash didn t
kill him  love would 
she saw the circles
of concentric devastation
with london like a bull s eye
in the center of the board 
she knew that was coming 
nicola knew when
her own story ended  too 
some minutes after midnight   
on her 30th birthday 
guy fawkes day 
her final entry 
 in the black cross pub  
i found my murderer 
 i found my murderer  
i met him 
 today  
  yes 
  oh  hello 
uh  my name
is samson young

um

anything i might know 
i seriously doubt it 
listen  i believe
your premonitions 
i believe you see
your death 
so who s going to kill you 
i don t know 
i just know
he was there yesterday 
i ve always wanted to write
a murder novel  but i   
was never close
enough to it  i   
um    i i believe
i would have to be there 
recording it 
would you let me do that 
i think you could be
my masterpiece 
yes 
i know what you re thinking 
it s a gift 
and i m going to take it 
regardless 
she was a great character 
a fascinating creature 
compelling 
self destructive 
i had the makings
of a really snappy
little thriller 
she entered the black cross 
she entered the pub
and its murk 
she lifted her veil
with both hands like a bride 
surveyed the main actors
of the scene 
and immediately
she knew  with pain 
within intense recognition 
that she had found him 
her murderer 
i just had a deja vu 
nicola awoke
and heard the rain
and went back to sleep again 
or she tried 
i want more
of that mark asprey 
that s what i want more of 
not to be greedy  my love 
but you cannot expect
a girl to go gentle
into that good night

somehow 
still  one must
never give up hope 
there was something
i wanted to ask you 
yeah  of course 
so when i was
in the orphanage 
i was friends with
a little burmese girl 
she was a few years
younger than me 
we were like sisters 
and i promised her one day
we would live together 
that i d get her out 
but when i returned  i found
out that she d been adopted
by a saudi businessman 
right 
she had his son 
god 
and when he washed
his hands of her 
she was repatriated
back to burma 
now she s not even
allowed back into england

the sort of person
who might know someone

is simply known as
little boy

how to get
to the dead end street 
was that the car

so  it s gonna be guy 
well  it s his car 
and he s falling in love 
it normally ends
very badly with me 
guy clinch was a good guy 
or a nice one  anyway 
he worked
for the family business 
trying to keep tabs
on the proliferating hydra
of clinch money 
guy wanted for nothing
and lacked everything 
guy had money  health 
handsomeness 
and he was lifeless 
nice joint
you got here  yeah 
for years  he d been trying
to have a child
with his wife hope 
excuse me 
they used to worry
about the kind of world
they were bringing
their child into 
but when their prayers
were answered 
they worried
about what kind of child
they were bringing
into the world 
guy always thought it was
life he was looking for 
but it must have been death 
keith  i ve been waiting

so  no one left
to borrow from 
she s lovely 
the little girl 
i decided to send
the first three chapters
to my long time publisher 
missy harter 
i knew missy 
it was right up her alley 
callous and sensational 
she wouldn t be able
to resist 
the normal accepted laws
of writing
are working backwards 
what started out
as reality fiction
is becoming more and more
unvarnished reality 
i have to keep reminding
myself that this is a story 
i m writing a story 
if i can just get
the balance right 
501 up 
it s the texas
hold em of darts 
the rules are pretty simple 
you have to score
exactly 501 points 
you go over  you bust 
play the game 
that s about it 
come on 
the black cross pub 
tossing them out one by one 
excuse me 
not afraid 
nicola used to think that
she might be saved by love 
but it never happened 
she could make
a man feel he was 
at last  really living 
she could attract it 
she could bring love in 
  nicola 
  couldn t send love out 
coming 
  she wore an itsy bitsy  
do you know the origin
of the word  bikini   keith 
you what 
bikini  it s from the
bikini atoll in the pacific 
where the us conducted
atomic bomb tests 
i know all about
your money trouble  keith 
and very soon   
i m gonna give you
a lot of money 
oh  i wanna believe
that you will 
guy is supporting
a foreigner and her son
in their efforts
to escape burma 
very oppressed people 
poor  unfortunate  really 
and you  keith  can get 30 000
just for setting things up 
nicola  i have some  er 
some rather bad news 
i thought that    hello

this is just a little   
to start you off 
oh  nicky 
do you know
what that looks like 
a gun barrel in a holster 
exactly 
you can have the money
if you don t touch 
the qualities
of patience and coolness
that i imagine you apply
to your darts  keith   
apply to me 
nicola 
you ll find with me   
when it rains  it pours 
and when it pours

but i thought it d be   
something to cheer you up 
it s a   
it s a globe 
obviously 
there s burma 
would you do me a favor 
yes  of course 
would you please take these
to a jewelry store
for me and sell them 
i m sure they ll
just take advantage of me
if i try to do it myself 
they were my grandmother s 
i don t know
how much they re worth
but i think
it should be enough
to get me a plane ticket 
it s just that i got a call from
my foreign office friend yesterday 
and he s going to come
into london to talk to me 
he s found enola
and little boy 
but there are warlords
and all sorts
of complications 
and they need to be paid
in order to get out and   
i don t know what else to do 
it s all right 
it s all right 
i think i should come
with you  all right 
it ll be safer 
i promised my friend
i would be alone 
well  in that case

of course 
i better get back to him 
  so sergeant pepper

  that mother s eyes

  those freaks was right
when they said

you should do 
stop it and live 
everyone has
their dreams  don t they 
people kill
for a lot of reasons 
my murderer is not gonna be
a standard issue thrill kill 
pull it off and live 
it s fixed 
if you know
you re going to die

it wouldn t change anything 
i m just playing my part 
beginners  luck 
i always knew i d be killed
over an affair of the heart 
passion  love    you know

fine 
nicola
purposely showed up late
to her dinner with keith 
akbar 
get her a fucking menu 
will you 
double gin and tonic  please 
 i m on
a special diet  
no food 
is there a good reason
why you re late 
did you dress up for me 
you look so handsome 
you remind me of the king
of saudi arabia 
 i once slept  
she said   experimentally 
with the king
of saudi arabia  
he had his men search
the entire world
for the most beautiful
women alive 
people do want value
for their money 
don t they  keith 
yeah  absolutely 
absolutely they do 
the thing
about the king was   
 the king never slept
with the same    
   same woman twice 
when i was brought
to his room 
he laid out two lines
of the finest cocaine 
when i was brought
to his room 
he laid out
the most miraculous panties 
 knickers  
knickers 
 worth a fortune  
   fortune 
they were
absolutely weightless 
six weeks later 
there was a revolution 
and the king was dead
within a year 
and soon  keith 
you ll be king  too 
if london is a spider web 
maybe i m the fly 
did you write that 
in my book 
mmm hmm 
to tell you the truth 
i feel pretty good
about my writing right now 
i think i m doing
the best work of my life 
i picked up your book 
memoirs of a listener 
yeah  let s change the subject 
how about that 
i m not one of your
one dimensional characters  sam 
you ve got to get that 
i m pretty worried
that the critics
are gonna call you
a male fantasy figure 
i know your secret 
you do 
and what is it 
i ll race you
to the finish line 
correction 
you go first  i go second 
remember  i have to write it 
i m not in love with her 
something intertwines us 
but it isn t love 
with nicola 
it s the other thing 
it s death 
there s no language for pain
except bad language 
the single pill in the bottle 
that s for when the living
will envy the dead 
that s for the most
painful condition of all 
life 
hello  mate  mark 
um    i finished
your book  and er 
i ve got to say
i so admire your nerve 
the endless contortions
of your prose 
so brave 
you know  an autobiography
is  uh  most of the time 
just success stories 
for a man to take up his pen
and tell a story
of continual failure 
just so bloody brave 
sales  success  and money
and acclaim 
they re not the measure
of an artist 
no  really  well done  mate 
  hello 
  guy 
i m sorry
but i can t see you any more 
it s just too hard for me 
i just don t trust myself
when i m with you

as a little girl 
nicola did have
a best friend named enola gay 
they were inseparable 
enola shared in all
of nicola s schemes
in domestic terrorism 
but the thing about enola was
she came from inside the head
of nicola six 
it s too much for me 
it s too much for me 
she didn t exist 
so she couldn t die 
  everything  even life  
  seems to be made of  
  particles  
  mathematically the state of  
  these particles cannot  
  be described  
  by six numbers  
  their position and velocity  
  but by a wave function  
  giving them properties  
  both the particles  
  they exist or they don t  
  and a wave can be  
  in several places at once  
  all the simple things  
  that i forgot  
  you cover me  
  you cover me     
nicola 
please stop 
stop it 
stop it

  you
cover me

about me

nicola often found
herself imagining
that she was
going out with god 
she had slept with him once 
and once only 
then never again 
god cried in the street
outside her flat 
god got shakespeare
and dante working
as a team
to write her poems 
of course  there was
another man in nicola s life 
the devil 
nicola gave herself
to the devil
because she wanted
to make god mad 
a jealous god 
he threatened
to wash his hands
of the whole planet 
he promised plague
and famine and terror 
he threatened to make her old
and keep her that way forever 
nicola told him to get lost

unofficial
declaration of war 
a nuclear   
where the undefeated
chick purchase
will play the eighth seed
keith talent
in the black cross pub 
good luck  keith 
you ll need it 
probably sound
more dramatic
than it really is
i expect but   
there s someone else 
it seems to me that
there s been a need
to redefine our relationship 
you should have lied about it 
would you like to know
how the story ends 
or you could always imagine
whatever you want to 
no matter what s going on
in the world 
you can always imagine
anything you like 
and it ll make you happy

is 100 percent tv magic 
love is blind 
but it makes you see
a blind man 
it makes you search him out
with eyes of love 
after years of war
and revolution 
dreams and imagination 
love is a big idea 
it s thought police 
it s a knock on the door
at 3 a m 
love makes you
bring on world war three
for a piece of ass

of all strange things 
i know the murderer

i know the time 
i know the place 
i know the motive   
and i know the means 
you

the equation
she was working on
needed love in it somewhere 
and love was dying 
it was fixed
from that first moment
in the black cross
when she looked my way
with eyes of recognition 
please 
i should have understood
that a cross has four points 
not three 
you can t stop people
once they start 
you can t stop people
once they start creating 
there are two kinds of titles 
the first kind of title
decides on a name
or something
that is already there 
the second kind of title
is present all along 
it lives and breathes   
or it tries  on every page 
if love travels
at the speed of light 
then it can have other powers
just on the edge
of the possible 
it can create impressions
on those left behind 
like a sun  trying to shine
right across the universe 
it was me 
always me 
it was me 
joining me now in the studio
is award winning
bestselling author 
mark asprey 
with his new novel 
london fields 
it s such an honor
to have you here today 
just for a treat
to our audience 
could you read a little bit
from your novel 
certainly 
 after sex 
she d whisper 
  that s what i am 
  a black hole 
 nothing can escape me  
 she had the power
of inspiring love
 almost everywhere 
 she received it 
 was empowered by it 
and returned it 
not merely negated 
but murdered  
thank you 
that was great 
you know  i m just
going through this 
and i it doesn t
sound like you 
i it    the kind of prose
it is written in 
the immediacy
of the language 
the whole style
of this 
it feels like
a real tectonic shift
that reads more
like a memoir really 
this is not the voice
of the mark asprey
that we all know 
my audience  my readers   
deserve this level
of authenticity 
no matter what the   
the cost
to me as an artist 
and i m prepared
to shoulder that 
buy the book 
oh  all right

  where did you learn
to run

your choices

that you chose  
  there s a long way
left to go  
  and you ll never get
to where you want to be  
  at least not with me  
  you ve got your vanity  
  but lack sincerity  
  how little can you say  
  before you re on your way 
  there s a place
where you go  
  and you hide away
your choices
