out in the starlight
just like we used to do
im always walking
after midnight
searching for you
this is a true story
but i cant believe
its really happening
its a murder story too
i cant believe my luck
and a love story
of all strange things
i know the murderer
i know the murderee
i know the time
i know the place
i know the motive
and i know the means
i know who will be the foil
the fool and the poor foal
i couldnt stop them
even if i wanted to
you
always you
you cant stop people
once they start
please
you cant stop people
once they start creating
it all started three weeks ago
when i flew in on
a redeye from new york
nobody in their right mind
wants to come
to london right now
theyre afraid
the crisis is going
to reach a conclusion
that everythings going
to fall into chaos
i thought i would be able
to find something
to write about
see i write fiction
but my novels um
arent really fiction
you have arrived
at your destination
you know uh
not many people rushin in
to merry ol london town
these days
i answered
a personal ad
in the new york review
of books
the celebrated writer
mark asprey
was offering up his apartment
for a swap
he would have been
overwhelmed with responses
if it werent for the crisis
instead poor mark ended up
with my shithole
in hells kitchen
well fuck me
and i got the keys
to his inspiring
threebedroom flat
in the heart of london
mr samson young
mr mark asprey here
checking in to see
if you survived
your plane trip mate
make yourself at home
do feel free by the way
to touch everything
everything in that place
has inspired a book
in some way
or a million sales at least
and i hope it does that
for you i really do
iim sorry
its not all finished
you know im refurbishing
the building
but this bloody
panic everywhere
you just cant get
all the stuff you need
no matter how much money
you throw at the problem
i left a copy of my
third novel on the desk
crossbone waters
it never hurts
to reread the classics
for a spot of inspiration
your place is just phenomenal
i had no idea
this would be so
wonderfully diminished
as you know
my latest character
lives in hells kitchen
and i think i might
make him even poorer
its just going
to be delicious
and i cant thank you enough
oh i just hope
you enjoy yourself
hey tiger
oh yes
i do hope you get a chance
to enjoy the mirrors
i do
anyway see you mate
if london is a pub
and you want the whole story

i had to borrow a pinch
from me old loan shark

for an unwise investment
so now i gotta borrow money
from me old mate

at the event horizon
of a black hole

more often

of all things she lives
in my building
remarkable
the pain kit
from dr slizzard
arrived in good time
like a box of candy
why cant i do it
why cant i just write
i write im a writer
from the moment
nicolas thoughts began
to be consecutive
she knew two strange things
ive always known
what was going to happen next
the second was that
she must never tell anyone
about the first
hers was a specific kind
of fortune telling
nicola saw the death
of many many things
she knew her young friend
dominique
would fall to her death
how painful i was
prepared for mom and dad
she knew her parents
would die in a plane crash
they both died
together
as i always knew they would
so why love anyone
i met the surviving
pilot and slept with him
if the crash didnt
kill him love would
she saw the circles
of concentric devastation
with london like a bullseye
in the center of the board
she knew that was coming
nicola knew when
her own story ended too
some minutes after midnight
on her 30th birthday
guy fawkes day
her final entry
in the black cross pub
i found my murderer
i found my murderer
i met him
today

ive always wanted to write
a murder novel but i
was never close

recording it

i think you could be
my masterpiece
yes
i know what youre thinking
its a gift
and im going to take it
regardless
she was a great character
a fascinating creature
compelling
selfdestructive
i had the makings
of a really snappy
little thriller
she entered the black cross
she entered the pub
and its murk
she lifted her veil
with both hands like a bride
surveyed the main actors
of the scene
and immediately
she knew with pain
within intense recognition
that she had found him
her murderer
i just had a deja vu
nicola awoke
and heard the rain
and went back to sleep again
or she tried
i want more
of that mark asprey

not to be greedy my love

a girl to go gentle

in the orphanage
i was friends with
a little burmese girl
she was a few years
younger than me
we were like sisters

but when i returned i found
out that shed been adopted
by a saudi businessman
right
she had his son
god
and when he washed
his hands of her
she was repatriated
back to burma

allowed back into england

is simply known as
little boy

how to get
to the deadend street
was that the car
guy is just so sweet
so its gonna be guy

and hes falling in love
it normally ends
very badly with me
guy clinch was a good guy
or a nice one anyway
he worked
for the family business
trying to keep tabs
on the proliferating hydra
of clinch money
guy wanted for nothing
and lacked everything
guy had money health
handsomeness
and he was lifeless
nice joint
you got here yeah
for years hed been trying
to have a child
with his wife hope
excuse me
they used to worry
about the kind of world
they were bringing
their child into

about what kind of child
they were bringing
into the world
guy always thought it was
life he was looking for

i bought out
all your debts
so noone left
to borrow from
shes lovely
the little girl
i decided to send
the first three chapters
to my longtime publisher
missy harter
i knew missy
it was right up her alley
callous and sensational
she wouldnt be able
to resist
the normal accepted laws
of writing
are working backwards
what started out
as reality fiction
is becoming more and more
unvarnished reality
i have to keep reminding
myself that this is a story
im writing a story
if i can just get
the balance right
501 up
its the texas
holdem of darts
the rules are pretty simple
you have to score
exactly 501 points
you go over you bust
play the game
thats about it
come on
the black cross pub
tossing them out one by one
excuse me
not afraid
nicola used to think that
she might be saved by love
but it never happened
she could make
a man feel he was
at last really living
she could attract it
she could bring love in
nicola
couldnt send love out
coming
she wore an itsy bitsy
do you know the origin
of the word bikini keith
you what
bikini its from the
bikini atoll in the pacific
where the us conducted
atomic bomb tests
i know all about
your money trouble keith
and very soon
im gonna give you
a lot of money
oh i wanna believe
that you will
guy is supporting
a foreigner and her son
in their efforts
to escape burma
very oppressed people
poor unfortunate really
and you keith can get 30000
just for setting things up
nicola i have some er
some rather bad news
i thought that hello
its coming
this is just a little
to start you off
oh nicky
do you know
what that looks like
a gun barrel in a holster
exactly
you can have the money
if you dont touch
the qualities
of patience and coolness
that i imagine you apply
to your darts keith
apply to me
nicola
youll find with me
when it rains it pours
and when it pours
i get rather wet
take this
and this you dont have
to do anything nasty
with it keith just props

something to cheer you up

its a globe
obviously
theres burma
would you do me a favor
yes of course
would you please take these
to a jewelry store
for me and sell them
im sure theyll
just take advantage of me
if i try to do it myself
they were my grandmothers
i dont know
how much theyre worth
but i think
it should be enough
to get me a plane ticket
its just that i got a call from
my foreign office friend yesterday
and hes going to come
into london to talk to me
hes found enola
and little boy
but there are warlords
and all sorts
of complications
and they need to be paid
in order to get out and
i dont know what else to do
its all right
its all right
i think i should come
with you all right
itll be safer
i promised my friend
i would be alone
well in that case
ill come
but ill keep at a distance
all right
look
im gonna take care
of everything
everything from here on in
you really are a good person
yeah

their dreams dont they
people kill
for a lot of reasons
my murderer is not gonna be
a standard issue thrill kill

im just playing my part

i always knew id be killed
over an affair of the heart
passion love you know
you shouldnt kiss me
fine
nicola
purposely showed up late
to her dinner with keith
akbar
get her a fucking menu
will you
double gin and tonic please
im on
a special diet
no food
is there a good reason
why youre late
did you dress up for me
you look so handsome
you remind me of the king
of saudi arabia
i once slept
she said experimentally
with the king
of saudi arabia
he had his men search
the entire world
for the most beautiful
women alive
people do want value
for their money
dont they keith
yeah absolutely
absolutely they do
the thing
about the king was
the king never slept
with the same
same woman twice
when i was brought
to his room
he laid out two lines
of the finest cocaine
when i was brought
to his room
he laid out
the most miraculous panties
knickers
knickers
worth a fortune
fortune
they were
absolutely weightless
six weeks later
there was a revolution
and the king was dead
within a year
and soon keith
youll be king too
if london is a spider web
maybe im the fly
did you write that
in my book
mmmhmm
to tell you the truth
i feel pretty good
about my writing right now
i think im doing
the best work of my life
i picked up your book
memoirs of a listener
yeah lets change the subject
how about that
im not one of your
onedimensional characters sam
youve got to get that
im pretty worried
that the critics
are gonna call you
a male fantasy figure
i know your secret
you do
and what is it
ill race you
to the finish line
correction
you go first i go second
remember i have to write it
im not in love with her
something intertwines us
but it isnt love
with nicola
its the other thing
its death
theres no language for pain
except bad language
the single pill in the bottle
thats for when the living
will envy the dead
thats for the most
painful condition of all
life
hello mate mark
um i finished
your book and er
ive got to say
i so admire your nerve
the endless contortions
of your prose
so brave
you know an autobiography
is uh most of the time
just success stories
for a man to take up his pen
and tell a story
of continual failure
just so bloody brave
sales success and money
and acclaim
theyre not the measure
of an artist
no really well done mate
hello
guy
im sorry
but i cant see you any more
its just too hard for me
i just dont trust myself
when im with you

and between you and me
it dont look too shrewd mate
yeah says to me

yeah goin to some place
with poppies
and drug lords or something
yyyou dont think
shes gonna do that
all this mate
its too much
ive never seen her so down
you know
she just sits there
spinning that little
globe thing
as though shes been having
a bit of a cry
im worried she might
do herself an injury
i had a chill
run through me today
its the feeling of life
leaving me
my breath was shallow
and my heartbeat
was really faint
i guess im quitting
whether i like it or not
but goddammit i cant go yet
i still dont know
who you are
but you know me
its in my diaries
i know youre beautiful
and that the entire world
falls into you
and does anything you want
i mean look at me
and look at you
i have no idea what its like
i cant imagine it
you just dont understand
look at me
really
look at me
no it
as you dont have
any living family member
to advise you
i cant allow you to do this
whats this
nothing
youre leaving tomorrow
i cant let you do that
im sorry guy
its a bloody good thing
you did all right
because im
absolutely furious
you have to take
this money all right
you have to
i couldnt
you have to
i couldnt
as a little girl
nicola did have
a best friend named enola gay
they were inseparable
enola shared in all
of nicolas schemes
in domestic terrorism
but the thing about enola was
she came from inside the head
of nicola six
its too much for me
its too much for me
she didnt exist
so she couldnt die
everything even life
seems to be made of
particles
mathematically the state of
these particles cannot
be described
by six numbers
their position and velocity
but by a wave function
giving them properties
both the particles
they exist or they dont
and a wave can be
in several places at once
all the simple things
that i forgot
you cover me
you cover me
nicola
please stop
stop it
stop it
you know it has to
it has to happen
at least once
you see i cant
i can
be still
be still
you cover me
you
cover me
close your eyes
how do you feel
about me
truthfully
the truth is
youre a bad dream
i keep thinking ill wake up
and youll disappear
youre so alone sam
why am i
the only person with you
people dont like
to see life fading away
its a once in a lifetime
yes
good afternoon im your new social worker
wheres mrs ovens
is your husband
at home at the moment
yes hes not been
well though hes
im sure youre aware
of the dangers
of passive smoking
ive been passively
smoking for years
and it hasnt
done me any harm
im afraid i might have to seek an order
order
what
i know we havent got what
some do but we are trying
yeah you tell her kath
you come in here
you havent got any money
certainly not
enough for proper care
there is nothing i wouldnt do
for my daughter
my god
do you abuse your daughter
and i cant say i like the look of that dog
oi noone talks
about my dog like that
you fuck off out of it
what kind of care
do you give people
from an office
get out you evil witch
get the fuck out
good day
you dont let her touch you
you are who you are
all right
you know im gonna
fucking kill you dont you
shall we say 800
this is london
there are no fields
only fields of operation
and observation
sorry
i didnt say anything
the human being
can formulate
a strategy for death
gentle or defiant
but then death
moves in completely
and decides
to run the show
at some point
near the end
nicola wasnt having
any of that
she would be
running things right up
to the very last second
you know
im looking forward
to the eclipse
its on my birthday
no no no no no
you shouldnt have come
to my place
never should have done that
now i know why
you didnt want me
to see how you live
you live like a pig
that is so fucking
out of order
sixty thousand pounds
thats more than you need
so that you could take care
of all your other troubles
and clear your mind
for whats really important
the big one
the big one
yes
tv stardom
televised
see thats where you belong
that is where everything

god cried in the street
outside her flat
god got shakespeare
and dante working
as a team
to write her poems
of course there was
another man in nicolas life
the devil
nicola gave herself
to the devil
because she wanted
to make god mad
a jealous god

to wash his hands
of the whole planet
he promised plague
and famine and terror

and keep her that way forever

without the story

this is the dress
of my dreams
unofficial
declaration of war
a nuclear
where the undefeated
chick purchase
will play the eighth seed
keith talent
in the black cross pub
good luck keith
youll need it
probably sound
more dramatic
than it really is
i expect but
theres someone else
it seems to me that
theres been a need
to redefine our relationship
you should have lied about it
would you like to know
how the story ends
or you could always imagine
whatever you want to
no matter whats going on
in the world
you can always imagine
anything you like
and itll make you happy
okay
package for you sir

the actual pub
pub

wheres the crowd
and the birds and that
we use cutaways
and just slug in fake audience
reaction shots later
theres never anybody here
what you see at home
is 100 percent tv magic
love is blind
but it makes you see
a blind man
it makes you search him out
with eyes of love
after years of war
and revolution
dreams and imagination
love is a big idea
its thought police
its a knock on the door
at 3 am
love makes you
bring on world war three
for a piece of ass

its really happening
i go out walking
its a murder story too
i cant believe my luck
its a love story
of all strange things
i know the murderer
i know the murderee
i know the time
i know the place
i know the motive
and i know the means
you
always you
the equation
she was working on
needed love in it somewhere
and love was dying
it was fixed
from that first moment
in the black cross
when she looked my way
with eyes of recognition
please
i should have understood
that a cross has four points
not three
you cant stop people
once they start
you cant stop people
once they start creating
there are two kinds of titles
the first kind of title
decides on a name
or something
that is already there
the second kind of title
is present all along
it lives and breathes
or it tries on every page
if love travels
at the speed of light
then it can have other powers
just on the edge
of the possible
it can create impressions
on those left behind
like a sun trying to shine
right across the universe
it was me
always me
it was me
joining me now in the studio
is awardwinning
bestselling author
mark asprey
with his new novel
london fields
its such an honor
to have you here today
just for a treat
to our audience
could you read a little bit
from your novel
certainly
after sex
shed whisper
thats what i am
a black hole
nothing can escape me
she had the power
of inspiring love
almost everywhere
she received it
was empowered by it
and returned it
not merely negated
but murdered
thank you
that was great
you know im just
going through this
and iit doesnt
sound like you
iit the kind of prose
it is written in
the immediacy
of the language
the whole style
of this
it feels like
a real tectonic shift
that reads more
like a memoir really
this is not the voice
of the mark asprey
that we all know
my audience my readers
deserve this level
of authenticity
no matter what the
the cost
to me as an artist
and im prepared
to shoulder that
buy the book
oh all right
subtitles by explosiveskull
where did you learn
to run
always under the gun
always a little less
when trying to impress
theres a place
where you go
and you hide away
your choices
while i wait for you
to turn yourself around
and this road
that you chose
theres a long way
left to go
and youll never get
to where you want to be
at least not with me
youve got your vanity
but lack sincerity
how little can you say
before youre on your way
theres a place
where you go
and you hide away
your choices
while i wait for you
to turn yourself around
