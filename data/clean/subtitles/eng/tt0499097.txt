isnt likely to pull through
also killed was his wife
uh kelly is the third member
of the special operations unit
to be attacked
in the last 24 hours
fbi has provided the remaining
team members and their families
access to security
and protective custody
we have to be alert
to the fact that
these seals get themselves
into all worlds of trouble
drugs arms information
and keeping that in mind
we are taking
every possible scenario
into consideration
yes
ritter
what the hell was that
every possible scenario
bullshit in there
my men were not dirty
and you know it
what is the whole story
and dont bullshit me ritter
today is not the day for it
were looking into it
how come both times
my world has gone to shit
youre standing
in the middle of it
just good luck i guess
i need a doctor
code blue

i dont know

all i need
is a name
give me a name
even if i knew
you know i cant do that
which part of please knock
wasnt clear
excuse me mr secretary
my apologies sir
no need
i wouldve been disappointed
with anything less
special assignment to the dod
its impressive
you even got a window
please
i did some work with your uncle
jim greer is
one hell of an operative
if you say so sir
he speaks very highly of you
and your judgment
which is why i would like
to talk to you about john kelly
lieutenant commander
in your opinion
how far can kelly be trusted
you know the drill
chest press to 15
lets go
lieutenant commander come in
uh
mr secretary all due respect
the director made it clear
i was to brief you and you only
hmm
take a seat
i asked the cia to brief me
on the situation
relating to your men
i thought youd like
to be present
thank you sir
yuri zelin
son of nikolay zelin
head of the fsb
this is yuri in aleppo
an hour before our assault
lieutenant commanders team
killed him on the second floor
now what he was doing there
we dont know
but webb rowdy and kelly
all seem to have been payback
all the men kelly killed
in his house had fsb links
so you are actually telling me
the massacres of our men
and their families
were foreign attacks
on us soil
russians
by proxy
none of them were connected to
russia in an official capacity
did you know russia
was dealing weapons
out of aleppo when we went in
oh we had a feeling
were a man short
kelly said one of
the russians got away
theres three men here
wheres the fourth
uh it doesnt matter
the cias position on this
moving forward
is that the matter is closed
what
the director considers
the score even
she feels uh
its unnecessary
to poke the bear any further
if sarah believes
theres not enough intel
for me to generate a response
my hands are tied
for now
get your mug
we celebrating something
drink
thats an order
i finally understand
how you felt
on that helicopter in syria
about ritter
cia doesnt support
any further investigation
into the attacks
or pams murder
came straight from
the directors office
theyre calling it
national security
they know it was
russian nationals and
jesus
its just a file on a
classified server somewhere now
shit
probably gonna go
to jail for this
but hey
these are your toe tags
i got em from secretary clay
wheres the fourth
your survivors a ghost
but these three were cleared
by the chief of intel
andre vaseliev exfsb
hes the one
who issued their passports
vaseliev
hell know
who the fourth man is
anybody talk to him yet
nope
hes fullon untouchable
watch out there whoa

911 whats the nature
of your emergency
hey im dropping off somebody
at dulles airport
and i see a car swerving
in and out of the lanes
i pulled up next to him
and um
i hate to be this guy
but im pretty sure
he flashed a gun at me
dark suv
license plate
rtfivesixtwonine
hurry up
imim really scared
why does it take so much time
to get rid of the police
dont worry mr vaseliev
ill get you to the gate
yeah you remember me huh
who killed my wife huh
who was the fourth guy
at my house
give me a name
you give me a name
okay
ill give you a name
john kelly
you are the problem john
youre supposed to be dead
so wherever you go
death will follow
yeah
yeah i punctured your lung
my wife pam
she drowned in her own blood
now you give me a name
give me a name
and ill make it quick
viktor rykov
hes exiting the vehicle
get down
hands where we can see em
let us see your hands
get down
im military
turn around
hands up
dont shoot im military
get your hands behind your head
literally hours
before the dulles attack
an anonymous source releases
classified documents
that tie the russian government
to the attacks
on our navy seals
here in the us
and youre telling me
thats coincidental
im saying id be wary
about accusing
the russian state
of assassinating
us service members
on american soil
we didnt leak
the russian thing
i mean why would we
we were the ones
trying to cover it up
and as a courtesy
director dillard thought
you might want to know
how kelly got to vaseliev
lieutenant commander greer
yeah we cant prove it
although as i recall
you were quite insistent
that she be briefed
on the matter
she did seem resourceful
there is the obvious concern
that this new development
sends the wrong message
to moscow
the wrong message
they hit us at home
now theyre paying attention
and kelly has
a big target on his back
even in prison
he wont be safe
some situations warrant
thinking outside the box
has it occurred to you
that john kelly
perhaps has done
something we cant
he shook a tree
that needed shaking
so
lets see who else falls out
youre pretty messy right now
in more ways than one
no im not
i spent half my life
playing that game
im the one that went to hell
and did their dirty work
we served a country
that didnt love us back
because we believed
in what it could be
we fought for what
america could be
but they crossed a line
they brought their war
into my house
they took my wife
and they took my baby girl
before she got a chance
to take a breath
that contract is broken
theyre gonna play
by my rules now
ill show them
what a pawn can do to a king
the files you got
on those russians
secretary clay gave it
to you right
i need you to get
a message to him
thats impossible john
but i found out something
what do you have
no
if he wants to know what i know
then you got to get me
out of here and fast
why do you think i ended up
in a prison full of russian mob
think about it
they can get to me in here
on your feet
turn around and face the wall
now why would i do that
im taking you on a little trip
nah im good right here
stand up and face the wall
if you cant tell me
where im going
im not moving
go go go go
move move
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
close the door
or ima start snapping necks
make a hole
maam approaching john now
senior chief kelly
im united states marshal
kevin townsend
im gonna slide a phone
through your hatch
somebody would like
to talk to you
drop it in
this is john
john its me
were getting you out of there
follow the us marshal
you can trust him
unless youre not done
im done
you know you messed up
when they send a motorcade
buddy theyre gonna write songs
about all the shit
you messed up
this way
mr secretary
senior chief john kelly
john
have you met sarah dillard
she runs the cia
and robert ritter
also from the c
i know him
so what have you learned
make our trip down here
worthwhile
viktor rykov
how do you know that name
he was the fourth gunman
at my house
he killed my wife
viktor rykov is dead
who the hell is viktor rykov
hes classified
tell the man
viktor anatoly rykov
born in tyumen
parents died early
moved to the us
as a young child for a time
suspected russian
special forces
counterespionage fsb weapons
his ideology was postsoviet
he believed the west
could be brought down
by a series of strategic attacks
on american soil
he was a planner and a doer
he had an established set
of embedded agents
that is until we uh
sanctioned him
or thought we sanctioned him
tran
can you reassure us
that mr kelly
wouldnt know mr rykov
if he was standing
in front of him
put him in a lineup please
top right
yeah thats him
if it is him what do we do
if rykov is alive we need
to find him and bring him in
we know his mo
we have to assume that
this operation is not a oneoff
think about it
and uh
if i had to guess hes probably
staged out of russia
i need to be on that team
thank you john sincerely
but well take it from here
lieutenant commander
youll head the mission
youll be making an extraction
i suggest you prepare a list
no no
i think ive shown
that im willing to go
further than anyone
to get the job done
consider what i did in dulles
as an audition
sir if this guys
as bad as he says he is
then you need somebody like me
and theres nobody like me
i dont think
that would be optimal sir
it is my opinion
that senior chief kelly is not
in the right state of mind
to be in the field right now
with all due respect
i think hes perfectly suited
he goes too
but after the mission
you will return
to the penitentiary as a felon
never jumped from
a passenger jet before
its modified
youll jump out
of the cargo door
but backstopping
an unplanned flight
over germany to russia
takes time
the route from leipzig
to anchorage is already cleared
goes right over the dz
ill see you guys later
copy that
so this rykovs hiding
in murmansk
no bullshit i thought
this was an exercise
were flying civilian
given the heightened tension
with russia
its the cleanest plan
and we cannot leave a trace
of us presence behind
understood
whats our exfil
you should read
the mission brief
hey ritter
youre not joining us
ill see you over there
stop
hmm
dont do that john
im serious
mm okay
okay
okay im sorry
im sorry im sorry
why are you such an asshole
i dont think senior chief
kellys fit for the field
hmm
what was that
you dont trust me no more
like i said
youre pretty messy right now
before i put a bullet
in vaselievs head
you know what he told me
that death follows me around
he was right
john he was
no no no no
just hear me out
if i hadnt been
on that mission in aleppo
if i wouldve pulled out
one tour earlier my wife
my kid theyd still be here
my family
dont get much more death
around you than that
john
no no
youre not responsible
for any of that
but i am
its my family
im gonna make it right
after that
my life doesnt matter
this isnt a revenge mission
this is an extraction
we are going to
bring him to justice
tell me thats gonna
be enough for you
im done making promises
that i cant keep

have to sack the mission

hmm
keep moving keep moving
come on kelly
come on baby
come on
can you walk can you walk
the others went ahead
you guys heard
what rykov said right
he said it started in dc
i thought i was
a pawn hunting a king
rykov wasnt a king
he was just me
on the other side
pawns could never kill a king
all ive got
to go back to is jail
theres a duffel bag of money
below deck
its yours
but you never made it out alive
you died in murmansk
with you as a ghost
maybe we can find out
whos behind this
i was wrong about you
minister has accused the us
of an attack on a civilian
building in murmansk
which resulted
in multiple casualties
the white house denies
any connection
in response
the us has accused russia
of trying to shift blame
for the downed commercial flight
over the barents sea
each country has yet
to prove its claims
but the fact remains
relations between
the two nations
havent been this strained
since the cold war
there are also concerns about
how an escalation in tensions
could affect the economy
a us trade representative
has stated that
mr secretary
john
greer told me you were dead
im sorry to sneak up
on you like this
but i had to go ghost
it was the only way i could
get you that information
whwhat information
about the mission
we werent supposed to
make it out of there alive
sir this was a cia op
they ran it out of dc
the entire time
theyre trying to heat up
tension with russia
youre not suggesting dillard
ive known sarah for years
i dont always agree
with her methods
but shes nothing
if not a patriot
i know she doesnt seem
like the type of person
that would put an operative
in an explosive vest
have him blow himself up
well thats exactly my point
thing is greer left
that part out of the report
and when i said that
just now you
you didnt seem a bit surprised
well nothing surprises me
anymore john
there he goes
i dont know what you think
youre doing sailor
helpless huh
you sent me all over this world
put my life on the line
because i believed that we were
on the right side of things
that our way would keep
people like you in check
pull over john
youre confused
so youre gonna tell me why
why my family
my wife
my daughter
why kill my team
rykov was all in
so id like a little bit
of what you sold him
you are making a mistake
hey hey hey hey
know where we driving
you got a farm
out in west virginia right
your daughter should be
home from college
wesleyan
thats a good school
your wife
your son too
so i suggest you start talking
because if you dont
im gonna make you watch me kill
your whole damn family
i never met rykov in my life
im listening
you know who won world war ii
it wasnt the generals
or the admirals
it was the economists
more tanks planes ships
and all that spending lifted
this entire nation
out of poverty
freed the world from tyranny
a big country needs big enemies
the best enemy we ever had
was the soviet union
our fear of them
unified our people
gave us purpose
the problem today john
is half this country thinks
the other half is its enemy
because they have
no one else to fight
so
we gave them a real enemy
one with the power
to threaten their lives
their freedoms
freedoms you take for granted
and it works john

you just wouldnt die
you had no right
to take so much from us

into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
