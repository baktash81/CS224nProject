what we know is
three perps are dead
and senior chief kelly
is in critical condition 
isn t likely to pull through 
also killed was his wife 
uh  kelly is the third member
of the special operations unit
to be attacked
in the last 24 hours 
fbi has provided the remaining
team members and their families
access to security
and protective custody 
we have to be alert
to the fact that
these seals get themselves
into all worlds of trouble 
drugs  arms  information 
and keeping that in mind 
we are taking
every possible scenario
into consideration 
  yes 
  ritter 
what the hell was that
 every possible scenario 
bullshit in there 
my men were not dirty 
and you know it 
what is the whole story 
and don t bullshit me  ritter 
today is not the day for it 
we re looking into it 
how come both times
my world has gone to shit 
you re standing
in the middle of it 
just good luck  i guess 
i need a doctor 
code blue 
  check his pulse 
  bp s dropping 
  start chest compressions 
  i got you 
the baby 
know who s behind it 
i don t know 
pros 
they were pros 
the guy they found
in my bedroom   
i didn t kill him 
he was already dead
when i got there 
one got away 
all i need   
   is a name 
give me a name 
even if i knew   
   you know i can t do that 
which part of  please knock 
wasn t clear 
excuse me  mr  secretary 
my apologies  sir 
no need 
i would ve been disappointed
with anything less 
special assignment to the dod 
it s impressive 
you even got a window 
please 
i did some work with your uncle 
jim greer is
one hell of an operative 
if you say so  sir 
he speaks very highly of you
and your judgment 
which is why i would like
to talk to you about john kelly 
lieutenant commander 
in your opinion 
how far can kelly be trusted 
you know the drill 
chest press to 15 
let s go 
lieutenant commander  come in 
uh   
mr  secretary  all due respect 
the director made it clear
i was to brief you and you only 
hmm 
take a seat 
i asked the cia to brief me
on the situation
relating to your men 
i thought you d like
to be present 
thank you  sir 
yuri zelin 
son of nikolay zelin 
head of the fsb 
this is yuri in aleppo
an hour before our assault 
lieutenant commander s team
killed him on the second floor 
now  what he was doing there 
we don t know 
but webb  rowdy and kelly
all seem to have been payback 
all the men kelly killed
in his house had fsb links 
so you are actually telling me
the massacres of our men
and their families
were foreign attacks
on u s  soil 
russians 
by proxy 
none of them were connected to
russia in an official capacity 
did you know russia
was dealing weapons
out of aleppo when we went in 
oh  we had a feeling 
we re a man short 
kelly said one of
the russians got away 
there s three men here 
where s the fourth 
uh  it doesn t matter 
the cia s position on this
moving forward
is that the matter is closed 
what 
the director considers
the score even 
she feels  uh 
it s unnecessary
to poke the bear any further 
if sarah believes
there s not enough intel
for me to generate a response 
my hands are tied 
for now 
get your mug 
we celebrating something 
drink 
that s an order 
i finally understand
how you felt
on that helicopter in syria 
about ritter 
cia doesn t support
any further investigation
into the attacks
or pam s murder 
came straight from
the director s office 
they re calling it
national security 
they know it was
russian nationals  and   
jesus 
   it s just a file on a
classified server somewhere now 
shit 
probably gonna go
to jail for this 
but hey 
these are your toe tags 
i got  em from secretary clay 
  where s the fourth 
  your survivor s a ghost 
but these three were cleared
by the chief of intel 
andre vaseliev  ex fsb 
he s the one
who issued their passports 
vaseliev 
he ll know
who the fourth man is 
  anybody talk to him yet 
  nope 
he s full on untouchable 
watch out there  whoa 
what are you doing  man 
come on 
hey  you watch out 
  hey  you

  blow me 
hey  hey

i just need to go   
  no  get back  take a step   
  get by 
  i got to get through 
  no  you don t  no  you don t 
  you need to go this way

  no  you don t  you need to step   
  i i   
  okay  okay  all right  okay 
  i told you  get back 
okay  okay 
okay  i just   
i just need to go   
911  what s the nature
of your emergency 
hey  i m dropping off somebody
at dulles airport 
and i see a car swerving
in and out of the lanes 
i pulled up next to him 
and  um 
i hate to be this guy 
but i m pretty sure
he flashed a gun at me 
dark suv 
license plate
r t five six two nine 
hurry up 
i m i m really scared 
why does it take so much time
to get rid of the police 
don t worry  mr  vaseliev 
i ll get you to the gate 
yeah  you remember me  huh 
who killed my wife  huh 
who was the fourth guy
at my house 
give me a name 
you give me a name 
okay 
i ll give you a name 
john kelly 
you are the problem  john 
you re supposed to be dead 
so wherever you go 
death will follow 
yeah 
yeah  i punctured your lung 
my wife pam 
she drowned in her own blood 
now  you give me a name 
give me a name 
and i ll make it quick 
viktor rykov 
he s exiting the vehicle 
get down 
hands where we can see  em 
  let us see your hands 
  get down 
  i m military 
  turn around 
  hands up 
  don t shoot  i m military 
get your hands behind your head 
literally hours
before the dulles attack 
an anonymous source releases
classified documents
that tie the russian government
to the attacks
on our navy seals
here in the u s  
and you re telling me
that s coincidental 
i m saying i d be wary
about accusing
the russian state
of assassinating
u s  service members
on american soil 
we didn t leak
the russian thing 
i mean  why would we 
we were the ones
trying to cover it up 
and as a courtesy 
director dillard thought
you might want to know
how kelly got to vaseliev 
lieutenant commander greer 
yeah  we can t prove it 
although  as i recall 
you were quite insistent
that she be briefed
on the matter 
she did seem resourceful 
there is the obvious concern
that this new development
sends the wrong message
to moscow 
the wrong message 
they hit us at home 
now they re paying attention 
and kelly has
a big target on his back 
even in prison 
he won t be safe 
some situations warrant
thinking outside the box 
has it occurred to you
that john kelly
perhaps has done
something we can t 
he shook a tree
that needed shaking 
so   
   let s see who else falls out 
you re pretty messy right now 
in more ways than one 
no  i m not 
i spent half my life
playing that game 
i m the one that went to hell
and did their dirty work 
we served a country
that didn t love us back 
because we believed
in what it could be 
we fought for what
america could be 
but they crossed a line 
they brought their war
into my house 
they took my wife 
and they took my baby girl
before she got a chance
to take a breath 
that contract is broken 
they re gonna play
by my rules now 
i ll show them
what a pawn can do to a king 
the files you got
on those russians 
secretary clay gave it
to you  right 
i need you to get
a message to him 
that s impossible  john 
but i found out something 
what do you have 
no 
if he wants to know what i know 
then you got to get me
out of here  and fast 
why do you think i ended up
in a prison full of russian mob 
think about it 
they can get to me in here 
on your feet 
turn around and face the wall 
now  why would i do that 
i m taking you on a little trip 
nah  i m good right here 
stand up and face the wall 
if you can t tell me
where i m going 
i m not moving 
  go  go  go  go 
  move  move 
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  close the door 
or i m a start snapping necks 
make a hole 
ma am  approaching john now 
senior chief kelly 
i m united states marshal
kevin townsend 
i m gonna slide a phone
through your hatch 
somebody would like
to talk to you 
drop it in 
this is john 
john  it s me 
we re getting you out of there 
follow the u s  marshal 
you can trust him 
unless you re not done 
i m done 
you know you messed up
when they send a motorcade 
buddy  they re gonna write songs
about all the shit
you messed up 
this way 
mr  secretary 
senior chief john kelly 
john 
have you met sarah dillard 
she runs the cia 
and robert ritter 
also from the c   
i know him 
so  what have you learned 
make our trip down here
worthwhile 
viktor rykov 
how do you know that name 
he was the fourth gunman
at my house 
he killed my wife 
viktor rykov is dead 
who the hell is viktor rykov 
he s classified 
tell the man 
viktor anatoly rykov 
born in tyumen 
parents died early 
moved to the u s 
as a young child for a time 
suspected russian
special forces 
counterespionage  fsb  weapons 
his ideology was post soviet 
he believed the west
could be brought down
by a series of strategic attacks
on american soil 
he was a planner and a doer 
he had an established set
of embedded agents 
that is  until we  uh   
sanctioned him 
or thought we sanctioned him 
tran 
can you reassure us
that mr  kelly
wouldn t know mr  rykov
if he was standing
in front of him 
put him in a lineup  please 
top right 
yeah  that s him 
if it is him  what do we do 
if rykov is alive  we need
to find him and bring him in 
we know his m o 
we have to assume that
this operation is not a one off 
think about it 
and  uh 
if i had to guess  he s probably
staged out of russia 
i need to be on that team 
thank you  john  sincerely 
but we ll take it from here 
lieutenant commander 
you ll head the mission 
you ll be making an extraction 
  i suggest you prepare a list 
  no  no 
i think i ve shown
that i m willing to go
further than anyone
to get the job done 
consider what i did in dulles
as an audition 
sir  if this guy s
as bad as he says he is 
then you need somebody like me 
and there s nobody like me 
i don t think
that would be optimal  sir 
it is my opinion
that senior chief kelly is not
in the right state of mind
to be in the field right now 
with all due respect 
i think he s perfectly suited 
he goes  too 
but after the mission 
you will return
to the penitentiary as a felon 
never jumped from
a passenger jet before 
it s modified 
you ll jump out
of the cargo door 
but backstopping
an unplanned flight
over germany to russia
takes time 
the route from leipzig
to anchorage is already cleared 
goes right over the dz 
  i ll see you guys later 
  copy that 
so  this rykov s hiding
in murmansk 
no bullshit  i thought
this was an exercise 
we re flying civilian 
given the heightened tension
with russia 
it s the cleanest plan 
and we cannot leave a trace
of u s  presence behind 
understood 
what s our exfil 
you should read
the mission brief 
hey  ritter 
you re not joining us 
i ll see you over there 
stop 
hmm 
don t do that  john 
i m serious 
mm  okay 
okay 
okay  i m sorry 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
why are you such an asshole 
 i don t think senior chief
kelly s fit for the field  
hmm 
what was that 
you don t trust me no more 
like i said 
you re pretty messy right now 
before i put a bullet
in vaseliev s head 
you know what he told me 
that death follows me around 
  he was right 
  john  he was   
no  no  no  no 
just hear me out 
if i hadn t been
on that mission in aleppo 
if i would ve pulled out
one tour earlier  my wife   
   my kid  they d still be here 
my family 
don t get much more death
around you than that 
  john 
  no  no 
you re not responsible
for any of that 
but i am 
it s my family 
i m gonna make it right 
after that 
my life doesn t matter 
this isn t a revenge mission 
this is an extraction 
we are going to
bring him to justice 
tell me that s gonna
be enough for you 
i m done making promises
that i can t keep 
this is the captain 
30 minutes to halo jump 
prepare for drop 
let s go  boys

franklin 
seymour 
hey  don t say shit  all right 
karen 
john 
isn t this nice 
mm  still not adding up 
what if us getting shot down
wasn t an accident 
it s really hard to forget about
that last mission
we went on with ritter 
you were in the briefing 
you heard what they said 
ritter was the one
who said rykov was dead 
he was also the one
who stopped the investigation
into my wife s murder 
isn t that right 
so now he s the only asshole 
the only one
that wasn t on the plane 
give me a reason 
what reason would he possibly
have to sack the mission 
don t know 
but either way 
i m going to get some answers 
you tracking me 
according to
senior kremlin officials 
the airbus was not a
transatlantic airlines flight   
but a spy aircraft
operated by the american cia 
one official stated
that the fake manifest

hmm

come on  kelly

the others went ahead 
you guys heard
what rykov said  right 
he said it started in d c 
i thought i was
a pawn hunting a king 
rykov wasn t a king 
he was just me
on the other side 
pawns could never kill a king 
all i ve got
to go back to is jail 
there s a duffel bag of money
below deck 
it s yours 
but you never made it out alive 
you died in murmansk 
with you as a ghost 
maybe we can find out
who s behind this 
i was wrong about you 
   minister has accused the u s 
of an attack on a civilian
building in murmansk
which resulted
in multiple casualties 
the white house denies
any connection 
in response 
the u s  has accused russia
of trying to shift blame
for the downed commercial flight
over the barents sea 
each country has yet
to prove its claims 
but the fact remains
relations between
the two nations
haven t been this strained
since the cold war 
there are also concerns about
how an escalation in tensions
could affect the economy 
a u s  trade representative
has stated that   
mr  secretary 
john 
greer told me you were dead 
i m sorry to sneak up
on you like this 
but i had to go ghost 
it was the only way i could
get you that information 
wh what information 
about the mission 
we weren t supposed to
make it out of there alive 
sir  this was a cia op 
they ran it out of d c 
the entire time 
they re trying to heat up
tension with russia 
you re not suggesting dillard 
i ve known sarah for years 
i don t always agree
with her methods 
but she s nothing
if not a patriot 
i know she doesn t seem
like the type of person
that would put an operative
in an explosive vest 
have him blow himself up 
well  that s exactly my point 
thing is  greer left
that part out of the report 
and when i said that
just now  you   
you didn t seem a bit surprised 
well  nothing surprises me
anymore  john 
there he goes 
i don t know what you think
you re doing  sailor 
helpless  huh 
you sent me all over this world 
put my life on the line
because i believed that we were
on the right side of things 
that our way would keep
people like you in check 
pull over  john 
  you re confused 
  so you re gonna tell me why 
why my family 
my wife 
my daughter 
why kill my team 
rykov was all in 
so i d like a little bit
of what you sold him 
you are making a mistake 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
know where we driving 
you got a farm
out in west virginia  right 
your daughter should be
home from college 
wesleyan 
that s a good school 
your wife 
your son  too 
so i suggest you start talking 
because if you don t 
i m gonna make you watch me kill
your whole damn family 
i never met rykov in my life 
i m listening 
you know who won world war ii 
it wasn t the generals
or the admirals 
it was the economists 
more tanks  planes  ships 
and all that spending lifted
this entire nation
out of poverty 
freed the world from tyranny 
a big country needs big enemies 
the best enemy we ever had
was the soviet union 
our fear of them
unified our people 
gave us purpose 
the problem today  john 
is half this country thinks
the other half is its enemy
because they have
no one else to fight 
so   
we gave them a real enemy 
one with the power
to threaten their lives 
their freedoms 
freedoms you take for granted 
and it works  john 
it works 
you just wouldn t die 
you had no right
to take so much from us 
no  i did  i swore an oath 
me  too 
to my wife 
her name was pam 
and you re gonna say it
before you die 
uh  what   
you re gonna say her name 
get me out of here 
say her name 
get me out of here 
say it 
pam 
pam 
pam 
pam   
there is a heaven 
mm  is this it 
no  baby  it s not 
what about you 
are you in heaven 
i m with you 
not always 
no  not always 
but now 
pam  i miss you 
i know 
it s okay 
 and lead us not
into temptation 
 but deliver us from evil 
 for thine is the kingdom
 and the power and the glory
 forever and ever 
amen  
although the precise nature
of the action
remains classified 
it apparently cost the life
of secretary of defense
thomas clay 
who was found dead
in the potomac river last week
in an apparent suicide 
emerging reports suggest
he was involved
in a potentially treason   
hey  i was listening to that 
lot less people than i thought 
we gave them a real enemy 
one with the power
to threaten their lives 
their freedoms 
freedoms you take for granted 
and it works  john 
it works 
you just wouldn t die 
i need a favor 
vaseliev did say that
none of this would be over
until john kelly was dead 
here s your new legend 
courtesy of
your little friend ritter 
 john clark  
that s real creative 
yeah  well  the cia isn t
exactly known for that 
that s fair 
what are you gonna do  john 
disappear 
and i know
you re dead and all now 
but don t be a stranger 
yes  ma am 
director 
congratulations on
the promotion  by the way 
thank you 
got to say i was surprised
when you  uh  came back to d c 
i ve been thinking
about what happened 
about how it could happen again 
so i put together some thoughts 
a multinational
counterterrorist team 
made up of u s   u k  
hand selected nato personnel 
with the full support of their
national intelligence services 
and who s gonna run
that kind of thing 
i will 
i want to present it
to the president 
do you  now 
calling it rainbow
