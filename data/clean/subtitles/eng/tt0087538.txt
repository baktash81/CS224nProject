think you understand my problem 
miyagi understand problem perfect 
your friend all karate student  eh 
problem  attitude

when you re alone

deep in the night
a dream is born
one that you can t ignore
if you think you can find the passion
and you re ready to take a chance
if you really believe you can make it
then the power is in your own hands
it s the moment of truth
you re giving it all
standing alone  willing to fall
if you can do it
get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
it s the moment of truth 
it s all on the line
this is the place  this is the time
you ve waited forever 
it s now or it s never
nothing can stop you now
once in your life
you make a choice
ready to risk it all
deep in your soul
you hear the voice
answering to the call
though you know that it won t be easy
it s a promise you make for love
for the people that keep believing
and the one that you re thinking of
it s the moment of truth 
you re giving it all
standing alone  willing to fall
if you can do it  get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
it s the moment of truth 
it s all on the line
this is the place  this is the time
you waited forever 
it s now or it s never
nothing can stop you now
it s the moment of truth 
you re giving it all
standing alone  willing to fall
if you can do it  get up and prove it
nothing can stop you now
it s the moment of truth 
you re giving it all
standing alone  willing to fall
if you can do it  get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
it s the moment of truth
