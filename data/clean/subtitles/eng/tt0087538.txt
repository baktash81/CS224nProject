and youre ready to take a chance
if you really believe you can make it
then the power is in your own hands
its the moment of truth
youre giving it all
standing alone willing to fall
if you can do it
get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
its the moment of truth
its all on the line
this is the place this is the time
youve waited forever
its now or its never
nothing can stop you now
once in your life
you make a choice
ready to risk it all
deep in your soul
you hear the voice
answering to the call
though you know that it wont be easy
its a promise you make for love
for the people that keep believing
and the one that youre thinking of
its the moment of truth
youre giving it all
standing alone willing to fall
if you can do it get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
its the moment of truth
its all on the line
this is the place this is the time
you waited forever
its now or its never
nothing can stop you now
its the moment of truth
youre giving it all
standing alone willing to fall
if you can do it get up and prove it
nothing can stop you now
its the moment of truth
youre giving it all
standing alone willing to fall
if you can do it get up and prove it
get up and show them who you are
its the moment of truth
