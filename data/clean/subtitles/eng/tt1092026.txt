  i thought it was okay 
  no  you re thinking about it too much 
  you think so  mmm hmm    oh  god 
they were shaking in their boots 
i think it s pretty obvious
what happened there  isn t it 
is it 
the government used some kind of
neurotoxic paint on the black mailbox 
it caused us to suffer a shared
hallucination about an alien 
it makes complete sense 
wrong

kitchenette  making bagels and coffee

the world is 4 000 years old and can
only be the product of intelligent design 
oh  that s horseshit 
  oh 
all right  well  then 
please explain how something
as complex as the human eye
simply just comes into being 
oh  don t give me that old
irreducible complexity crap 
something as intricate as
that does not just occur
without the intervention
of a guiding hand 
it didn t just occur 
it is the culmination of
billions of years of development
across countless fucking species 
what are you talking about 
  evolution  baby 
  oh 
  blasphemy 
  oh  yeah 
nothing that you can say or
do can shake my belief or faith
in the sure and certain knowledge
that god made heaven and earth
and created us all in his own image 
  oh  his own image 
  yeah 
well  i got a question 
how do you explain me 
she s going  she s falling  catch   
and that s jenga 
  why did you do that 
  she fainted 
we ve gone through this  they faint 
but we re going to have
to take her with us now 
no  no 
this is america  kidnapping a christian 
that s worse than harboring a fugitive 
but she s seen you  if we leave
her  she s going to call the police 
who gives a shit  no one s going to
believe this god bothering cyclops 
let s just dump her on the road 
just roll her up in the rug 
we can t risk that  if we take her with
us  then we can get her on our side 
you d love to get her on
her side  wouldn t you 
that doesn t make sense 
look  she ll be fine  we re quite nice 
all right  what about my passport 
oh  god  you guys 
mmm hmm

oh  shit 
ruth  what in the lord s name   
  morning

you ve been deceived by
an agent of satan himself 
  he s evil 
  i m sitting right here  come on 
no  he s not evil  he s just a bit
rude  we re trying to help him get home 
he s from another world 
there s only one world  our world  the
world that our god  the father  created 
if it makes you feel any better
my existence only disproves
traditional notions
of the abrahamic  judeo christian god 
as well as all one world
theologies  that s all i meant 
amazing grace  how sweet the sound
you can t win with these people 
ruth  just listen to me  for one second 
please  if you could just calm down 
i can t drive like this 
she s talking in tongues now  fuck this 
oh 
what did you do to her 
i just transferred my collective
knowledge and experience
via a tactile psychokinetic bridge 
ooh  wow  could you do me 
it really takes it out of me 
oh  go on  please 
oh  wow 
oh  yeah 
he always knew what was going
on in battlestar before me
 cause his mum had cable 
fine  pull over  i ll do you 
absolutely not  no spoilers 
i didn t call the government 
i called the police 
this is not the police s
area of expertise  mr  buggs 
  that devil took my daughter 
  what do you mean  devil 
and your daughter s name is ruth  is it 
that s right  i brought her up
by myself after her mama died 
do you have a photograph of ruth  sir 
yeah  she s pretty easy to spot 
she s had this eye thing
since she was four years old 
didn t want to take her
to a doctor for that 
the good lord is the only
doctor she ll ever need 
copy that  do you have a phone here
that your daughter might try to
reach you at if she decides to call 
yeah  in the back 
hey  peter parker  want to put the
snappy down and get to the phone 
right

191 after flaming gorge
if they ain t on the interstate 
there s been a big rig spill   
here we go  boys  to the car 
thank you very  very
much for your time  sir

bastard s little girl before it s too late 
ruth 
ruth  wait

please  please  stop 
i ve got shin splints 
he cannot be from
space  it s not possible 
he s from somewhere else 
ruth  you saw it for
yourself  okay  he showed you 
there s probably billions of
intelligent civilizations out there 
so where is everybody  hmm 
but one of them s there 
are they looking  are they looking 
are they looking right now 
sorry 
that s pathetic 
what s your beef  clive 
i don t have a beef 
i m from outer space  you re
a science fiction writer 
we should be best buds 
it s not you 
it s me 
is that what this is 
you re jealous  of her 
it s not just that 
whoa 
of me 
this is because me and graeme
got two minutes of face time
while you were sleeping 
  is that what this is 
  i wanted this to be special  you know 
i have dreamt about meeting you
ever since i saw mac and me 
and i blew it 
now you two are friendly 
and he s off talking to girls
and it s like  where am i 
come on  man 
this is special 
you guys being all nerdy and

time i saw a human  i puked 
you guys are weird looking 
you have giant bodies  you
have tiny  little  tiny heads 
  you re just being nice now 
  no 
look  you want a little sugar 
it s just knowledge and experience  man 
you re a writer  might
give you some inspiration 
will it hurt 
only if you struggle 
all right 
so  everything that i have
been told my whole life
is just a big fat lie 
do you know how that feels 
just because your truth isn t a true truth
doesn t mean that there is no truth  ruth 
  that s easy for you to say 
  it s really not 
so there s no heaven  no hell 
no right  no wrong  no sin 
well   
  i can drink 
  if you like 
  i can fornicate 
  maybe 
  i can curse
