cellular revivification

the other one the other one
oh he
im in the can i ate
a closed pistachio
im paying for it
thats a nice tshirt  oh
thanks i got it at my church
its jesus shooting charles darwin
why would jesus want
to shoot charles darwin
because of his blasphemous theories
are you men of god
were men of science you know
we believe in the establishment
of a biological order
through the maelstrom of
physical and chemical chaos
god created the earth in six days
and on the seventh day he rested
really
or it could be god you dont
know do you its up in the air
the world is 4000 years old and can
only be the product of intelligent design
oh thats horseshit
oh
all right well then
please explain how something
as complex as the human eye
simply just comes into being
oh dont give me that old
irreducible complexity crap
something as intricate as
that does not just occur
without the intervention
of a guiding hand
it didnt just occur
it is the culmination of
billions of years of development
across countless fucking species
what are you talking about
evolution baby
oh
blasphemy
oh yeah
nothing that you can say or
do can shake my belief or faith
in the sure and certain knowledge
that god made heaven and earth
and created us all in his own image
oh his own image
yeah
well i got a question
how do you explain me
shes going shes falling catch
and thats jenga
why did you do that
she fainted
weve gone through this they faint
but were going to have
to take her with us now
no no
this is america kidnapping a christian
thats worse than harboring a fugitive
but shes seen you if we leave
her shes going to call the police
who gives a shit no ones going to
believe this godbothering cyclops
lets just dump her on the road
just roll her up in the rug
we cant risk that if we take her with
us then we can get her on our side
youd love to get her on
her side wouldnt you
that doesnt make sense
look shell be fine were quite nice
all right what about my passport
oh god you guys

rude were trying to help him get home
hes from another world
theres only one world our world the
world that our god the father created

traditional notions
of the abrahamic judeochristian god
as well as all oneworld
theologies thats all i meant
amazing grace how sweet the sound
you cant win with these people
ruth just listen to me for one second
please if you could just calm down
i cant drive like this

knowledge and experience
