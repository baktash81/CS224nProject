and the wire goes    
ln the sleeve and down the dress

 just swipe it 
hi  liliane  hi  alphonse 
these are for you 
thanks for the trainee job 
think you ll like
being a script girl 
lt s hard to say 
after one day 
 lt s a terrific job  you ll see 
 l ll let you know in two months 
right     so long  kids 
you didn t tell me he was stone deaf 
so what  happened in the army 
artillery fire 
do me a favor 
walk ahead 
so l can watch your ass 
like this 
yes  like that 
 l saw you 
 saw me what 
 you re hot for the maid 
 l am 
bastard 
she s your type 
a bouncy little duckling 
don t tell me you re jealous 
absolutely not 
jealousy is dumb 
or you have to go all the way   
   and commit murder 
you re the jealous type 
l can tell  your eyebrows meet 
my eyebrows meet 
no  they don t 
those two beds look lonely 
maybe they should meet 
we have to move the table 
you could ve asked for a double bed 
lt meant asking lajoie 
the new production manager 
lt s heavy 
there 
now the second 
lt s tougher than moving audiences 
what ll we do tonight 
pierrot  the stills man 
gave me a list   
   of great little restaurants
up in the hills 
  great little restaurants    
we have to eat  don t we 
you must be kidding 
this town has 37 movie theaters 
we look in the papers  pick a movie 
go there   
   and make sure
when it starts 
and if there s time 
we grab a sandwich 
your stills man can take his list   
   of cute little   bistros      
   and shove it 
you re impossible 
listen  tonight  l m not going to
a movie or eating in this hotel 
you decide 
okay  we ll do what you want 
but on one condition 
which is 
that you marry me 
odile  try this on 
lt s for your scene 
hold that  not bad  huh 
let s see the apron 
 sold 
 l buy it 
shooting a movie is like
a stagecoach ride in the old west 
at first you hope for a nice trip 
soon you just hope
to reach your destination 
excuse me for bothering you  sir  l m
the new production manager  lajoie 
about the car for pamela s accident 
you have to choose one 
one of those two 
can the white one be painted blue 
sure  for  650 
just to paint it blue 
we ll use it as it is 
but it is very white    
what about that blue one 
lt belongs to your assistant 
jean françois 
maybe he won t mind 
 l ll ask him 
 yes  do that 
what is a film director 
someone who s asked questions
about everything 
sometimes he knows the answers 
 you liked this location 
 lt was fine  you were right 
we were lucky too  great weather 
 want to see the bungalow 
 sure  let s go 
lt s not built yet 
just the sketches 
the interior will be furnished 
bed  night tables 
chairs  table with  
hold on 
the camera will never go inside 
we ll only shoot
through the window 
so all we ll ever see is the bed 
sorry to bother you  but    
the americans insist
on the original schedule 
you only have seven weeks 
 think you can do it 
 lt won t be easy 
lf you need three or four days
for pick up shots   
   we ll use a skeleton crew 
but the actors
must be released by oct  31 st 
l ll go over the schedule
with jean françois 
seven weeks 
five days a week  35 days 
i can t shoot this script
in 35 days 
can you look at this 
lt s severine s wig    
 lsn t it a little too light 
 too light  l really don t know 
tell joelle to see walter about it 
he s the cameraman  they can decide 
props wants to see you 
which gun do you like
for the final scene 
alphonse has small hands 
but we won t take the smallest    
this one 
pamela crew 
report to screening room 
here they are 
rank and file all present
and accounted for  good 
you d be lost without
the rank and file 
what rushes are we seeing 
severine and alphonse    
 and the crowd scene

that s strange 
the crowd scene s missing 
call and ask the lab in paris 
lt s scene 1  
go ahead    
wait  where s severine 
she never comes to rushes 
 where s alexander 
 at the airport  as usual 
he goes every day 
he must be expecting someone 
l bet he has personal problems 
mother  i have to talk to you 
it s about them  do you mind 
 yes 
 i have to 
i ve found out they re in paris 
they re not even hiding 
why torture yourself 
be like me  don t think about them 
that s all i think about 
let s go away 
just the two of us  far away 
we ll do whatever you want 
i ve made up my mind
to go to paris   
   to kill them both 
use the   not even hiding

we ve got a big problem 
a power failure at the lab 
lt ruined the crowd scene 
it has to be re shot

 the insurance

what about you 
how do you keep so young

   l might take up cooking again

20 years ago  in hollywood 
we were there at the same time 
you know  he was a real ladies  man 
ln hollywood  they called him    
 l loved him too 
 ls he married 
l don t know if he is now 
he was married and divorced twice 
maybe he lives with someone 
no one knows  he s very secretive 
he has a moustache in the movie 
l like it 
moustache or not 
he s still playing lovers 
and look at me    
l m only cast as the neglected wife 
desperate   tragic   a real pain    
 you re lovely 
 no way    
cue me for my scene today 
l can t remember a line 
for some reason  lately   
   my memory has gone to hell 
excellent dressing room 
nice and spacious 
only the flowers are missing 
they ve been ordered 
you know 
l admire julie baker as much as you 
you wanted her  we got her 
but if she has a breakdown 
we ve had it 
what do you mean 
after the medical exam 
the doctor refused to insure her 
said she s still too nervous  and we
should postpone the shoot for a month 
what did the americans say 
they re more flexible
than the french 
they re gambling with us 
but if we lose 
no one ll take the blame 
we ll all be in hot water 
you have to trust
your luck sometimes    
you re right 
still  it s a gamble 
 seen severine since the rushes 
 l went to say hello 
you know she had
an affair with alexander 
 l heard    
 very stormy 
lots of publicity 
lt ended badly 
for four years  no producer
could get them to work together 
they hated each other 
but time heals all wounds 
 hello  alphonse 
 got a minute

 lt s all l think of 
me too 
this ll only take a minute 
great dressing room 
nicer than mine 
lt s julie s

 lt s all right  ready 
they do look alike 
l don t understand you  alexander 
you ve been peculiar lately 
walking out on dinner last night 
that was an insult to pamela 
after all  she is alphonse s wife 
you seem to hate her

l don t understand you  alexander 
you ve been peculiar lately 
walking out on dinner last night 
that was an insult to pamela 
after all  she is alphonse s wife 
she ll never do it 
lt s not my fault 
cut  once more 
lt s not my fault if l m confused 
l don t know if she s odile 
actress  or odile  makeup girl 
ln my day  acting was acting   
   and makeup was makeup 
no wonder l m confused 
anyone who has no business
on the set   
   please leave now  thanks 
that doesn t mean you have to go 
l wanted to go to the movies 
anyway 
makeup  give me my mirror 
lt s her fault  she s been boozing 
her son s dying of leukemia 
she s afraid 
a phone call could come any time 
she almost turned down the film 
lt ll be all right  severine 
we ll take a little break 
l m sorry  maybe the wig
is giving me a headache 
this has never happened before 
lt s the first time    
don t worry  severine 
wrap it up for today 
get some rest 
where s odile  not that odile 
tell the makeup girl
l want my scarf 
why don t you make
political films 
why don t you make erotic films 
you have to finish shooting
in seven weeks 
miss severine
needs odile in makeup 
who is that woman l keep seeing 
lajoie s wife 
follows him everywhere 
shall l try to get rid of her 
no  l m getting used to her 
l don t know why ferrand cast me 
 he can t stand me 
 who told you that 
l know he thinks
l m a lousy actress 
just between us  maybe he s right 
no  he didn t cast me 
was it the producer 
something s peculiar
about this film 
he never considered anyone else 
 really 
 l know it 
you never understand anything
anyway 
well  l don t understand this 
lt destroys me 
l m sorry 
l was hired to play a secretary 
no one mentioned a swimsuit 
lf they had 
l d have brought my own 
lt s not in the script 
but the scene plays better 
lt s a working vacation 
the secretary is a guest 
she s swimming   
   then he dictates a letter 
sorry  it s impossible 
l m not being difficult 
l even learned to type 
l wasn t told l had to swim 
l won t go near the water 
what can we shoot
until she calms down 
until julie baker gets here 
the pool scene is all we have 
go talk to her 
try to convince her 
an actress who won t appear
in a bathing suit is ludicrous 
darling  a telegram 
the children are coming 
our son got married
and we haven t met his bride 
no  wait 
here  this is for you 
 they re coming 
 day after tomorrow 
lt s about time 
l m delighted 
l ll write stanley at once 
l have to dictate a letter 
lt must go out today 
coming  sir 
don t worry 
stanley will solve it 
lf we could just rent
the house across the way 
marvelous 
then they d be close to us 
sorry to bother you now 
the letter s to stanley 
  dear stanley 
l m pleased to announce
the arrival of alphonse   
   and his young bride      
now l see why she wouldn t
wear a swimsuit 
why  she s lovely 
take another look 
good god 
stacey tricked us 
she s three months pregnant 
she kept it secret 
so let s tear up her contract 
l don t agree 
frankly  l don t think it shows 
come over here 
look at our schedule 
she shoots one more day now   
   and comes back in six weeks 
by then  it ll show 
we have to replace her 
lt s not a problem 
we ll pick someone now   
   and call her agent 
look  there s lots of girls 
stacey has an iron clad contract 
her agent knows it 
l ll lose 
you know why 
because in life  might makes right 
mr  ferrand  a package for you 
the books l ordered 
 delerue  the composer 
 l ll take it 
here s the playback
for the costume party scene 
that s lovely  georges 
thank you 
airport  julie s plane  press conference 
l can t be late 
say  you like to improvise 
why can t the secretary
be pregnant in the film 
maybe she could  
no  they d suspect alexander 
lt ll confuse the story line 
we can t do it 
come to think of it   
   stacey isn t married 
l wonder who the father is 
your questions  gentlemen 
can you tell us
about your new movie 
meet pamela
is the story of a british girl   
   who falls in love
with her husband s father 
l think it s based on a true story 
how does it end 
since it s a tragedy   
   it ll end unhappily 
but l d rather not reveal
all the details 
do you think these days
people care if a girl   
   sleeps with her husband s father 
when l like a script enough
to do it   
   l think audiences will like it too 
you do 
yes  and l hope l m right 
forgive me for intruding
into your private life   
   but american papers reported   
   that after being ill 
you married your doctor 
no  l didn t marry my doctor 
l married a man who s a doctor 
why isn t the lucky man among us 
my husband came with me 
ln fact he s here  in this very room 
where is he 
sorry  he hates publicity 
on that little note of mystery   
   we ll end this 
and let miss baker go to her hotel 
let the reporters leave first 
this is my husband  dr  nelson 
could you move back  please 
you re in the shot  there 
thank you very much 
she s always around 
 she s lajoie s wife 
 she think she s a crew member 
no  she thinks women are after him 
she makes his life hell 
he s too weak to dump her 
we call them
  the sorrow and the pity    
lajoie  we re ready to shoot 
what s going on there 
l don t like that at all 
you have   le trac   
what does that mean 
liliane  slate this one  please 
our stills man s very busy

hello  children 
my parents

you can see the sea 
she s charming    
do you like it 
my son never tells me anything 
l don t even know how you met 
l was on vacation in yorkshire
with my two cousins   
   dorothy and elizabeth 
he had a date with dorothy 
she got chicken pox 
so l went on the date 
l don t know dorothy   
   but l m glad
you didn t get chicken pox

but we ll try something else 
we re doing it again 
was l late 
we ll try it differently 
 take a break  severine 
 odile 
l wanted you with me 
so l got you the job 
l wanted us to be together 
but learning to be a script girl
is a waste of time 
 l want to learn film editing 
 film editing 
you just had to say the word 
l d have arranged it 
you re here to take stills  right 
odile 
get that bottle out of my sight 
how s your mother 
fine  l told her
we were working together 
she sends her love 
marvelous woman 
everyone in hollywood loved her 
 too bad she quit when she did 
 but she s still very busy 
she hated the way we shoot movies 
in bits and pieces 
l remember escorting her
to the premiere   
   of her first big hollywood movie 
a fantastic evening 
when the film ended   
   she sat there 
then turned to me and said   
     l did all that 
all l remember is the waiting   
lt s so true 
l m calm  not yelling 
but l say you re on the make 
 that s not true 
 oh  no  l m in agony 
l m in agony all the time 
l can t wait to finish a scene   
   so l can go look for you 
l m a complete wreck 
l can t find alphonse 
l know where he is 
while l m shooting  l m in agony 
can l shoot a scene
when l m like this 
l m supposed to keep cool 
lf l m no good  you re to blame 
l m sorry to make you die again 
l m used to it 
ln 80 movies  l ve died 24 times 
electrocuted twice  hanged twice    
l ve been knifed 
committed suicide   
   died in accidents 
but never a natural death 
anyway 
l don t think death is natural 
julie will be right out 
she s changing 
 did things go well 
 l m very pleased 
l ve never used an actress
l hadn t met before 
but julie s just right 
determined  yet fragile 
she s perfect for the role 
lt ll go fine 
sorry to keep you waiting  stacey 
lt ll take five minutes  bernard 
you won t miss your plane 
ready with the pool scene 
good  let s run it 
i need you

lt s not too    
 so it s okay 
 you can leave  don t worry 
have a nice trip 
now run the rest    
know what 
l want to touch you 
 what s that set 
 the love nest 
 lt s in the script 
 l never read scripts 
lt s when alexander
runs off with pamela 
they stop at a shady motel    
get it 
lt s morning 
they want to make love 
she puts the tray outside
to keep the maid out 
l ll leave 
you re not in this scene 
don t worry  l ll be around 
let me ask you    
are women magic 
no  they re not 
neither are men 
lf a woman says
she s known outstanding men   
   it means she s slept around    
excuse me  sir 
l have to take three days off 
you re leaving the crew 
my mother just died 
 l see  was it sudden 
 no  she was in great pain 
for her  it was a relief 
 l see  well  go ahead 
 but someone will fill in for me 
sure  l understand 
l think we can start now 
you re not in the way  doctor 
sit down  this shot should be fun 
l came to say goodbye 
my plane leaves in an hour 
lf l m through  l ll drive you 
what are we waiting for now 
bernard  as usual 
l m ready 
one cat s milk 
another cat s poison 
all right  we can go 
ready  alexander  julie 
not too romantic  the kiss

the boom is scaring it 
we ll wild track the sound 
at the fish market 
cut  once more 
do it this time  or else 
l swear 
it hasn t been fed in three days 
throw it in 
we ll shoot the scene
when you find a cat that can act 
l told you to get two cats 
miss know lt all 
but when we re through   
   l still have
to remove my makeup 
why did you let me down  puss 
you got me in trouble 
now where s joelle 
l found one 
lt s the studio cat 
l can tell by looking at it
that it won t perform 
don t fight 
we ll try the studio cat 
places  everybody 
the kiss    
the tray    
the door    
the cat 
focus 
focus on the cat 
excuse me    
can l ask you something 
ln your opinion  are women magic 
some are  yes 
others  no 
don t worry 
julie will be fine 
yes  she s very happy on this film 
l m sure she ll come through 
 actors are so vulnerable 
 of course they are 
everyone is afraid of being judged 
but actors   
   are always being judged 
ln your work  and in your life 
we wonder what people think of us 
if they love us 
lt must be the same
for all performers 
as a child  when mozart
was asked to play  he d reply   
     gladly 
but first say you love me   
and in your job 
you re always kissing 
as you say    
yes  we do a lot of kissing 
the handshake was invented
to show you re unarmed  friendly 
we went one better 
we show our love 
  my darling  you re so wonderful      
we need all that 
meet christian fersen 
our director  mr  ferrand 
were you waiting outside 
you should ve come in 
do you see what l see 
 are women magic 
 not women  their legs 
that s why they wear skirts 
cut the crap  we going to a movie 
 when does it start 
 we gotta leave 
the kitchen scene must be shot
tomorrow night 
the union contract
calls for a 1 2 hour break 
joelle  we must shoot
the kitchen tomorrow 
 can you work with me tonight 
 okay  so much for the movies 
what s this l hear 
yes 
we do the kitchen scene tomorrow 
 can l have my lines 
 after dinner  tonight 
 that s not much time 
 lt s not written yet 
read it once
and put it under your pillow 
ln the morning 
you ll know it by heart 
you re an optimist 
reporters always ask
the same questions 
  how does it feel to be famous 
to be recognized
and asked for autographs   
but no tv program l ve seen
ever shows that a working movie star   
   gets up at 6 a m 
and gets home at 9 p m  
a 1 5 hour workday 
not quite 1 5 hours 
say 1 3 
or 1 4  if you go to the rushes 
miss severine isn t in her room 
the godfather
is showing all over nice 
lt s wiping out every other movie 
speaking of godfathers 
how about alexander 
he fooled everybody 
we all expected a lolita   
   and a handsome romeo
got off the plane 
maybe he could do
pamela s car accident stunt 
lt s too dangerous 
we need a real stuntman 
back to the kitchen scene 
that night  alexander
finds pamela in the kitchen 
why the kitchen 
so as not to arouse any suspicions 
l m not happy with my first draft 
he    you know
what s happening to us   
she    l think l do   
that s bad 
pamela must know 
or her character will seem weak 
the scene needs a new idea 
call your cowriter 
l thought of it  he s in japan 
he s adapting
turgenev s first love 
set in modern japan  great idea 
better than pamela 
l should ve done it 
want a story line 
how about
  kissinger s successful mission   
  heart transplant   
  jeweler knifes wife   
back to work 
you dictate  l ll type 
we promised it to julie tonight 
okay  back to the kitchen    
no more guilt
or sense of shame 
they decide to run away
like thieves in the night 
pamela could actually say that 
we must show
that she s completely lucid 
she loved the son 
now she loves the father 
 that must come across 
 julie explained it very well 
here s her interview 
in the morning paper 
  the girl realizes
the boy she married   
   is only a pale reflection
of his father   
she understood the script  why 
because her mother was an actress 
she knows hollywood   
   where many kids try to live up
to famous parents 
fairbanks  barrymore and others 
alexander 
  you know what s happening to us   
damn  the phone 
miss dominique is here 
should she come up 
sorry  l m working 
l ll call tomorrow 
l ll give her the message 
he s sorry  he has to work tonight 
he ll call you tomorrow

severine leaves for ltaly tonight 
l don t want to see anyone 
this actor had always dreamed
of playing hamlet 
at last
he staged it and played the role 
but he was so bad 
he was booed every night 
one night he was fed up   
   he stopped in the middle
of   to be or not to be      
turning to the audience  he said    
the champagne  at last 
you still have to finish pamela 
l m so sad to be leaving 
come join us  machos 
move your table 
why are you all alone over there 
are you sad  in love  heartbroken 
don t  he s just a hotel guest 
so what 
come join us  mr  hotel guest 
we re a movie crew
having a farewell party 
l ll introduce you 
can l talk to you 
l think we should get alphonse 
he s locked in his room  sulking 
he s a drag 
that s unfair 
l ve known him for ages 
never fails 
then l ll go 
l ll try again 
come see the great photos 
she s so cute 
she s not  out 
what a funny life we lead 
we meet  we work together 
we love each other  and then    
as soon as we grasp something    
lt s gone  see 
severine is extraordinary 
we made a film together in ltaly 
she was so good 
the director kept saying   
     she s greater than eleonora duse   
so l called her   superduse    
seen alphonse 
he s locked in and won t come out 
well  severine s gone  so  
l need money to go to a whorehouse 
come on  alphonse 
go back to your room 
re read the script   
   learn your lines 
then try to sleep 
tomorrow we work 
that s what matters 
don t be a fool 
you re a very good actor 
no one s private life runs smoothly 
that only happens in the movies 
no traffic jams  no dead periods 
movies go along
like trains in the night 
and people like you and me   
   are only happy in our work 
l m counting on you 
which costume
shall l choose for saturday 
switch the call from 22 7 to 4 1 5 
it s alphonse 
i wanted to tell you
i m leaving tonight 
you ve always been my friend 
tell ferrand for me 
l have to talk to you  wait 
goodbye and thanks 
wait for me 
what is all this  you can t leave 
l am  l m giving it all up 
you ll stay and finish the film 
even if l stayed 
l m too upset to work 
l m a physical wreck 
ls it normal for someone to stop
loving you and just walk out 
then it was all phony 
sickening 
l know how much
you ve been hurt 
but l think liliane still loves you 
you re being selfish too 
you know it s difficult for an
outsider to live with an actor 
but to leave with just anyone 
some brit stuntman 
careful  l m a brit too 
and l know those stuntmen 
you know
what ll happen to their affair 
at first  he ll take her
everywhere with him 
then he ll get bored and she ll feel
lost all alone in london 
she ll be back in two weeks 
think so 
anyway  it s over now 
l d rather suffer 
you see 
l ve made a terrible discovery 
you can be desperately in love   
   with someone you despise 
whose every gesture 
word and thought you detest 
what right have you to say that 
say you made a mistake  but never
be ashamed of having loved 
by despising liliane
you re merely   
   degrading yourself 
maybe you re right 
anyway  my love affairs
have always ended badly 
l thought women were magic 
of course they re not magic 
or men are too 
everyone s magic  and no one is 
l m sure ferrand is wrong 
life is more important than films 
l m going now  thank you 
don t be a fool 
stay and finish your work 
ls that clock working 
lt s 6 a m   time to make coffee 
have you seen julie 
l m looking for lajoie 
know what that idiot did 
mixed up his dates
and sent the costumes back 
so you ve been up for hours 
all night  getting the costumes
from the airport 
or no shooting today 
 where could julie be 
 ln her room 
her bed hasn t been slept in 
everyone s nuts on this movie 
 what time is it 
 6 a m 
 where you going 
 to work 
you can sleep two more hours 
l set the alarm 
stay with me 
l can t 
l have a makeup call
for the costume party scene 
wait 
kiss me 
you won t forget 
we ll go away together
when the film s done 
sleep 
dr  nelson  lt s alphonse 
l have something to tell you 
l love your wife 
l slept with her  set her free 
julie  call for you 
l think it s your husband 
 you owe me for this bill 
 not now 
later it ll be too late 
you looked everywhere 
he s not in his room 
alphonse has disappeared 
could he have gone to paris 
there are flights at 8 50 and 1 0 1 0 
call the airport 
you call  l ll go 
lf he s there  l ll bring him back 
 we ve got trouble 
 l know  alphonse is gone 
l mean julie  nerves  l guess 
she locked herself in 
won t see anyone 
you can hear her crying 
l hope it s not another breakdown 
let s go see 
there s odile 
she got a call from dr  nelson 
l think 
she asked me to leave 
and locked the door 
lt s me  open the door 
open up  we re your friends 
as producer  l want to help you 
quiet 
you don t think she d    
 will she talk to you 
 she won t open the door 
you can hear her crying 
she keeps us out 
and lets stacey in 
motherhood has its privileges 
we can t find alphonse anywhere 
julie didn t sleep in her room 
alphonse disappears 
dr  nelson calls 
the picture s pretty clear 
what is this movie business 
where everyone sleeps with everyone 
everyone lies 
do you think it s normal 
your movie world   
   l think it stinks 
l despise it 
lajoie  calm your wife down 
that woman s wrong 
movie people may be
more obvious about it   
   but love makes
the world go round 
she wants tub butter 
country butter  in bulk 
ls she crazy  what s she doing 
crying  she ll stop 
but find her some tub butter 
find some tub butter 
no way  lt s not in the script 
that s not nice  or friendly 
aren t we one big family 
so were the people
in greek tragedies 
tub butter 
all right  l ll find it myself 
he s really quite lucky 
some whims are more expensive 
there was an austrian actress 
hedy lamarr   
   became a big hollywood star 
she really missed the rainy climate
of her native tyrol 
so  in her garden in california 
she installed   
   a rain making machine 
so a little thing like tub butter    
come help me 
this is all l could find 
that s not it 
there s no tub butter
on the whole riviera 
so we ll knead this
into one block   
   wrap it in gauze 
and it ll look like it 
think it ll work 
lt has to 
what a business 
l found alphonse  where 
you ll never guess 
l ll bring him in 
there you are 
here s the famous tub butter 
l won t deliver it 
no  like the chef
in rules of the game   
     l cater to diets  but not fads   
here s what you asked for 
you didn t 
forgive me 
l m so ashamed 
l ll be all right in a minute 
l know it s not very professional 
l don t like being like this 
holding you up 
lt s all right  we can wait awhile 
we ll change the schedule 
don t change it because of me 
l ll be all right in a minute 
can you lend me a handkerchief 
l must look awful 
why did alphonse do it 
he didn t understand anything 
he acted like the child he is 
l saw enough of your husband
to know he s a wonderful man 
yes  he is 
but you don t know the whole story 
when l had my breakdown   
   he did a very serious thing 
he left his wife and children 
he gave up a life
it took him 20 years to create 
he did that for me 
he devoted himself to me 
he tried to make me
into a responsible adult 
now he must think
it was an awful waste 
no  when he knows what happened   
   he ll understand 
he ll forget  it ll be over 
you think so  even if that s true 
l ll never forget 
thanks to him 
l know l can change my life 
l ve decided to live alone 
l m sick of disguises 
l m quitting movies 
l know that life is rotten 
since we can t shoot 
we ll record some wild tracks 
 ready  rené 
 okay  applause first 
now some background talk 
don t discuss movies 
now more applause 
julie s dressing room
is upstairs right 
l called him and he agreed to come 
l really screwed up 
what can l say to julie
when l see her 
 should l apologize 
 the less said  the better 
l ve made up my mind 
l m quitting movies 
that s a good idea  you do that 
are you seeing julie 
give her this new dialogue
for the scene 
she s to learn it 
can l fix your makeup now 
l m fine now 
we ll make ourselves beautiful 
this is your new dialogue
for the scene 
  even if that s true 
l ll never forget 
l ve decided to live alone 
l know that life is rotten   
he s got some nerve 
are you all right  julie 
let s do it 
l ve decided to live alone 
l know that life is rotten 
no  it isn t 
cut  once more  for the hands 
the candle okay 
 places 
 places  and quiet please 
l ll caress her with this hand 
places 
and let s do it 
l ve decided to live alone 
l know that life is rotten 
no  it isn t 
cut  that was the best one 
alexander is dead 
a car accident 
returning from the airport   
   where he went to meet christian 
a truck hit their car 
christian is badly hurt 
but he ll recover 
alexander died   
   on the way to the hospital 
alexander was buried
in a little cemetery above nice 
now the film s fate was in the hands
of the english insurers 
what i always feared had happened 
a production halted by death 
the era of studio movies
died with alexander 
films will be shot in the streets 
without stars or scripts 
there will be no more films
like meet pamela 
hello  pamela 
come have breakfast with us 
alphonse is still asleep 
no  no     in bed   
we re invited over 
we ll be right there 
 was that okay 
 fine  cut 
wait  l m coming over 
l was afraid
he might have an accident 
l offered him a driver 
he wasn t at home anywhere 
always rushing off somewhere 
a man in a hurry 
no  he was at home everywhere 
he liked people 
he lived for the moment 
he couldn t leave places 
he was rushing back not to be late 
you could say
he died out of generosity 
you may be right 
now we have to finish the film 
what does
the insurance company say 
mr  johanson talked at length
to london last night 
you can t re shoot alexander s
scenes with another actor 
the only solution
is to simplify the script   
   and finish shooting
in five days instead of two weeks 
then the insurance
will cover everything 
five days 
we ll have to simplify things 
we ll leave alexander
out of the costume party scene 
then the shot with the candles
makes no sense any more 
we ll cut the costume party scene 
the story works without it 
then the only important scene left
is when alphonse kills his father 
we can shoot it in the street
and hire a stand in for alexander 
lt won t work  unless alphonse
shoots him in the back 
why not  ln the back 
lt s better  far more violent 
why not have it all take place
in the snow 
all right  walter 
just like last time 
but we ll be closer
on alphonse this time 
but we have to see the gun 
here s the stand in 
could you walk away 
we have to see how you look 
too much hair on the neck 
lt has to work 
that s alexander s stand in 
trim his hair more like alexander s 
this is the gun you wanted
for alphonse  right 
lf that s the one l chose  sure 
places  everybody  hurry 
hurry  please 
to the places l showed you 
l don t want the snow
too white or too clean 
don t worry  l ll fix it
like in   the snow was black   
l ve been offered a movie in tokyo 
l want to accept 
turgenev s first love 
a good story 
for a movie 
with a japanese girl
and you as the frenchman  sure 
l ll do it because it s tokyo 
1 3 000 miles from my problems 
should l hold the gun like this 
or like that 
like that 
so it s seen against the snow 
dr  nelson and julie
want to say goodbye 
 off to london 
 australia  a medical conference 
be ready to shoot when l get back 
see you in paris for the post sync 
let s go before it gets dark 
 good luck 
 you too 
more discreetly 
walk faster 
the gun 
run away 
run to the far end 
cut  shooting s over 
thanks  everyone 
going back to paris 
no  l m staying around here
for a rest
