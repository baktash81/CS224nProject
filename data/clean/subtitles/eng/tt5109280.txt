 rumbling 
 suspenseful music playing 
raya 
i know what you re thinking 
a lone rider 
a dystopian world 
a land that s gone to waste 
how did this world
getso broken 
well  that all began
500 years ago 
kumandra 
 tribal music playing 
this is what we used to be 
when our land was whole 
and we lived harmoniously
alongside   
dragons 
magical creatures
who brought us
waterand rain and peace 
it was paradise 
but then  the druun came 
 rumbling 
a mindless plague
that spread like wildfire 
multiplying
as they consumed life
and turned everyone
they touched into stone 
the dragons fought for us
the best they could 
but it wasn t enough 
that s when
the mighty sisudatu 
the last dragon 
concentrated all her magic
into a gem and   
 suspenseful music rising 
   blasted the druun away 
everyone that was turned
to stone came back 
except the dragons 
all that was left of sisu
was her gem 
it should have been
this big inspirational moment 
where humanity united
over her sacrifice 
but instead 
people being people 
they all fought to possess
the last remnant
of dragon magic 
borders were drawn 
kumandra divided 
we all became enemies 
and the gem had to be hidden 
 suspenseful music playing 
but that s not how
the world broke 
that didn t truly happen
until 500 years later 
when i came into the story 
 suspenseful music continues 
 whooshing 
 rings 
 dramatic music playing 
 rain pattering 
 soft suspenseful music
playing 
hmm 
 exclaims

has sworn to protect the gem 
today  you will join
that legacy 
raya  princess of heart 
my daughter 
you are now
a guardian of the dragon gem 
 water trickling 
 enthralling music playing 
 birds squawking 
 chittering 
 soft upbeat music playing 
man  whoa  ah   
 benja laughing 
well  someone s excited 
young raya  well  yeah 
i mean  anyone hoping
to steal the dragon gem
now has to face the fury
of the two baddest blades
in all the lands 
 laughing  i m glad
you feel prepared  dewdrop 
because i have something
important to tell you 
the other lands  they re on
their way here  as we speak 
 they are  uh   
   tuk tuk squeaks 
okay 
okay  no  we can do this 
i m ready 
i know exactly
how we ll stop them 
really  tell me what you know
about the other lands 
first    tail 
a sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries
who fight dirty 
second  talon 
a floating market famous
for fast deals
and fighters
with even faster hands 
third  spine 
a frigid bamboo forest
guarded by
exceptionally large warriors 
and their giant axes 
 exclaims 
young raya  fourth  fang 
our fiercest enemy 
a nation protected
by angry assassins 
and their even angrier cats 
   hissing 
   tuk tuk exclaims 
okay 
so we re gonna need some
crossbows and catapults and   
ooh  what about
flaming catapults 
or  how about
shrimp paste from tail 
lemongrass from talon 
bamboo shoots from spine 
chilis from fang
and palm sugar from heart 
we ll poison them 
 laughing  no  we re not going
to poison them
and we re not going
to fight them 
we re going to share a meal
with them 
 wait  what 
 i invited them 
but they re our enemies 
they re only our enemies
because they think
the dragon gem
magically brings
us prosperity 
that s ridiculous 
it doesn t do that 
they assume it does 
just like we assume things
about them 
raya  there s a reason why
each land
is named after
a part of the dragon 
we were once unified 
harmoniously as one 
kumandra 
that s ancient history  ba 
but it doesn t have to be 
listen  if we don t stop
and learn to trust
one another again 
it s only a matter of time
before we tear
each other apart 
this isn t the world
i want you to live in 
i believe that
we can be kumandra again 
but someone has to take
the first step 
 sighs 
trust me 
 drum roll playing 
 whispers  things look
a little tense  ba 
 whispers  don t worry 
i m gonna open with a joke 
please don t 
 laughing 
i m kidding  i m kidding 
 in normal voice 
people of tail  talon 
spine  and fang 
welcome to heart 
for far too long 
we have been enemies 
but today is a new day 
today  we can be kumandra
once more 
 clapping 
 sarcastically 
nice speech  chief benja 
but why d you really
bring us here 
are you gonna rob us 
why would he need to rob us 
the land of heart
already has everything 
oh  it s easy to pontificate
on kumandra
when you hold the mightiest
weapon in all the lands 
 crowd muttering 
benja  the gem s not a weapon 
it s a sacred relic 
spine chief  kumandra 
kumandra s a joke 
tail chief 
he brought us all this way
to talk about fairy tales 
spine chief 
this is pointless 
 crowd continues chattering
indistinctly 
i have something to say

and floated downstream

she s more capable
than you realize 
we have to stop her 
 virana sighs 
walk with me 
 soft music playing 
look around 
we made all this
by making smart decisions 
not emotional ones 
we are safe 
our canal protects us
from those monsters 
i don t think it s wise
to risk yourself
when you don t have to 
but you heard the general 
we re running out of space 
we need to expand 
if we had all the gem pieces 
we could do that safely 
you re right 
this isn t
an emotional decision 
it s the only decision
we can make
to secure fang s future

 chuckles softly

that doesn t mean
you shouldn t try 
and i did 
and you know what happened 
i got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a gift 
look around 
we re a world
of orphans because

from the rest of the world 
the only way in or out
is by water

 super flow plan  am i right 
   con baby clapping

i agree 
here s my plan

confront namaari 
and offer her something nice
and go   
hey  wanna help us
save the world 
because all it takes
is one gem piece 
 sisu speaking as namaari 
yes 
i ve been waiting
for someone to ask me 
here you go 
best friends forever 
yeah  i think i d rather
go with boun s plan 
what 
yes 
what  why 
because it s fang 
their blades
are specially designed
for the stabbing of backs 
if it weren t for them 
none of this
would have happened 
they re the worst 
 mumbles in agreement 
if we re just honest with her 
deep down  i got a feeling
she wants to fix the world
as much as we do 
you weren t there
when namaari betrayed me 
we re sticking with my plan 
 sisu grunts annoyedly 
whoa  uh   
what s with the downpour

i need to show you something 
 raya exclaiming fearfully 
so  what do we do now 
i don t know 
raya  where are you taking me 
 enthralling music playing 
sisu  why did you
bring me here 
this is where it all happened 
yeah  i know 
 i was there 
  sisu  no 
this is where it all happened
500 years ago 
 gasps softly 
sisu  i want you to meet
my brothers and sisters 
the real mighty ones 
i miss them 
raya  i never knew
they were here 
see that classy looking one
over there 
that s amba 
i get my glow from her 
and that s pranee 
she s a shapeshifter 
jagan  fog 
and pengu 
he s our big brother 
he brings the rain 
we were the last dragons 
 thundering 
sisu  all the other dragons
had been turned to stone 
we were drowning
in a sea of druun 
 dramatic music playing 
but my oldest brother pengu
refused to accept defeat 
this is where
we d make our last stand   
united 
so  one by one 
they combined all their magic 
creating the dragon gem 
i don t know why
they chose me 
it could have been any of us 
 dramatic music continues 
all i know
is i trusted them   
 druun rumbling 
   and they trusted me 
and so   
 gem ringing mystically 
when they put their faith
in me 
it empowered me beyond
anything i could imagine 
the same can happen
with namaari 
i really wish
i could believe that 
i once thought
that we could be friends 
after all this 
maybe you can be 
even if she wanted to help us 
how could i possibly
trust her 
but if somehow you could 
you wouldn t just bring
your ba back 
you d also bring back
his dream 
kumandra 
 soft music playing 
 exhales softly 
do you think
he would even recognize me 
so much has changed 
of course he will 
you remind me of him 
oh  yeah  strong 
good looking
with impeccable hair 
 chuckles softly 
hopeful 
how would i even
approach namaari
after all that s happened 
it may feel impossible 
but sometimes 
you just have to take
the first step 
even before you re ready 
trust me 
 soft sentimental music
playing 
okay  we ll go with your plan 
what  my plan 
you re gonna go with my plan 
 yeah 
   laughs  all right 
you re not gonna regret this 
but we re gonna need
a really good gift 
what do you think she s into 
cats  knives 
 cats with knives 
   laughs 
sisu  knives with little cats
on them 
actually  i know exactly what
to give her 
and that is how
the land of fang rose
in spite of all the monsters
that wanted to destroy us 
because we re smart  resilient 
and we take care of one another 
mother  we need to talk 
it s princess namaari 
 children exclaiming 
all right  all right 
now  run along  kittens 
   children mumbling disappointedly 
 i have to speak with the princess 
mother  you won t believe what i saw 
you saw a dragon 
general atitāya informed me
that you d be returning home
without the gem pieces 
it was sisu 
she can fix what we broke 
she can bring everyone back 
and that s what scares me 
when everyone comes back 
who do you think
they ll come for 
you forget 
the other lands blame us
for what s happened 
but we    we never meant
for anyone to get hurt 
yes  but if we had the dragon
and the gem pieces 
we would be forgiven 
we could save the world 
but more importantly 
our people would remain safe 
but raya isn t just gonna
give sisu to us 
 sighs 
we re not going to give her
a choice 
what are you going to do 
that s no longer
your concern  my love 
you ve done enough 
 soft tense music playing 
if she refuses to help 
we ve just flushed
our tactical advantage
 into the dung pot 
 i know 
yeah  she really has no reason
to help us 
i know 
this jerky s terrible 
i know 
are you sure
those four miniature menaces
will be successful
