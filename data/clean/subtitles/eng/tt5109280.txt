rumbling
suspenseful music playing
raya
i know what youre thinking
a lone rider
a dystopian world
a land thats gone to waste
how did this world
getso broken
well that all began
500 years ago
kumandra
tribal music playing
this is what we used to be
when our land was whole
and we lived harmoniously
alongside
dragons
magical creatures
who brought us
waterand rain and peace
it was paradise
but then the druun came
rumbling
a mindless plague
that spread like wildfire
multiplying
as they consumed life
and turned everyone
they touched into stone
the dragons fought for us
the best they could
but it wasnt enough
thats when
the mighty sisudatu
the last dragon
concentrated all her magic
into a gem and
suspenseful music rising
blasted the druun away
everyone that was turned
to stone came back
except the dragons
all that was left of sisu
was her gem
it should have been
this big inspirational moment
where humanity united
over her sacrifice
but instead
people being people
they all fought to possess
the last remnant
of dragon magic
borders were drawn
kumandra divided
we all became enemies
and the gem had to be hidden
suspenseful music playing
but thats not how
the world broke
that didnt truly happen
until 500 years later
when i came into the story
suspenseful music continues
whooshing
rings
dramatic music playing
rain pattering
soft suspenseful music
playing
hmm
exclaims
huh
looks like someones trying
to be clever
squeaking

benja dont mistake spirit

you might wanna take out
that blade
youre gonna need it
benja not today
suspenseful music playing
weapons whooshing
suspenseful music rising
young raya grunting
continues grunting
panting
grunts
grunting
exclaims
panting
benja boop

you gave it your best
chuckles i wont
and its either father
or ba to you
you did good dewdrop
you passed the test
enchanting music playing
young raya gasps

the spirit of sisu
for generations our family
has sworn to protect the gem
today you will join
that legacy
raya princess of heart
my daughter
you are now
a guardian of the dragon gem
water trickling
enthralling music playing
birds squawking
chittering
soft upbeat music playing
man whoa ah
benja laughing
well someones excited
young raya well yeah
i mean anyone hoping
to steal the dragon gem
now has to face the fury
of the two baddest blades
in all the lands
laughing im glad
you feel prepared dewdrop
because i have something
important to tell you
the other lands theyre on
their way here as we speak
they are uh
tuk tuk squeaks
okay
okay no we can do this
im ready
i know exactly
how well stop them
really tell me what you know
about the other lands
first tail
a sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries
who fight dirty
second talon
a floating market famous
for fast deals
and fighters
with even faster hands
third spine
a frigid bamboo forest
guarded by
exceptionally large warriors
and their giant axes
exclaims
young raya fourth fang
our fiercest enemy
a nation protected
by angry assassins
and their even angrier cats
hissing
tuk tuk exclaims
okay
so were gonna need some
crossbows and catapults and
ooh what about
flaming catapults
or how about
shrimp paste from tail
lemongrass from talon
bamboo shoots from spine
chilis from fang
and palm sugar from heart
well poison them
laughing no were not going
to poison them
and were not going
to fight them
were going to share a meal
with them
wait what
i invited them
but theyre our enemies
theyre only our enemies
because they think
the dragon gem
magically brings
us prosperity
thats ridiculous
it doesnt do that
they assume it does
just like we assume things
about them
raya theres a reason why
each land
is named after
a part of the dragon
we were once unified
harmoniously as one
kumandra
thats ancient history ba
but it doesnt have to be
listen if we dont stop
and learn to trust
one another again
its only a matter of time
before we tear
each other apart
this isnt the world
i want you to live in
i believe that
we can be kumandra again
but someone has to take
the first step
sighs
trust me
drum roll playing
whispers things look
a little tense ba
whispers dont worry
im gonna open with a joke
please dont
laughing
im kidding im kidding
in normal voice
people of tail talon
spine and fang
welcome to heart
for far too long
we have been enemies
but today is a new day
today we can be kumandra
once more
clapping
sarcastically
nice speech chief benja
but whyd you really
bring us here
are you gonna rob us
why would he need to rob us
the land of heart
already has everything
oh its easy to pontificate
on kumandra
when you hold the mightiest
weapon in all the lands
crowd muttering
benja the gems not a weapon
its a sacred relic
spine chief kumandra
kumandras a joke
tail chief
he brought us all this way
to talk about fairy tales
spine chief
this is pointless
crowd continues chattering
indistinctly

fang may look nice

big holes on the inside
oh

who despise uncomfortable
formal wear
and were both sisu superfans
laughs yeah

sisu youre kidding right
wanna see something
gasps and whispers

scoffs no
according to this
after the mighty sisu
blasted away all the druun
she fell into the water
and floated downstream
legends say shes now sleeping
at the rivers end
but which river

i dont know
but if we could find it
could you imagine
a dragon back in the world
things could be
so much better
young raya yeah

virana and how do you propose
we handle the druun
general atitāya
without proper protection
it would be a death sentence
for our people
i might have a solution
for that mother
gasps softly
my little morning mist

id like to take
the royal army

shes more capable

we have to stop her
virana sighs

soft music playing
look around
we made all this
by making smart decisions
not emotional ones
we are safe
our canal protects us
from those monsters
i dont think its wise
to risk yourself
when you dont have to
but you heard the general
were running out of space
we need to expand
if we had all the gem pieces
we could do that safely
youre right
this isnt
an emotional decision
its the only decision
we can make
to secure fangs future

sisu speaking as namaari
yes
ive been waiting
for someone to ask me
here you go
best friends forever

because its fang
their blades
are specially designed
for the stabbing of backs
if it werent for them
none of this
would have happened
theyre the worst
mumbles in agreement
if were just honest with her
deep down i got a feeling
she wants to fix the world
as much as we do
you werent there

were sticking with my plan
sisu grunts annoyedly
whoa uh

sisu come on
i need to show you something

my brothers and sisters

they were here

over there
thats amba
i get my glow from her
and thats pranee
shes a shapeshifter
jagan fog
and pengu
hes our big brother
he brings the rain
we were the last dragons
thundering
sisu all the other dragons
had been turned to stone
we were drowning
in a sea of druun
dramatic music playing
but my oldest brother pengu
refused to accept defeat
this is where
wed make our last stand
united
so one by one
they combined all their magic
creating the dragon gem
i dont know why
they chose me
it could have been any of us
dramatic music continues
all i know
is i trusted them
druun rumbling
and they trusted me
and so
gem ringing mystically
when they put their faith
in me
it empowered me beyond
anything i could imagine
the same can happen
with namaari
i really wish
i could believe that
i once thought
that we could be friends
after all this
maybe you can be
even if she wanted to help us
how could i possibly
trust her
but if somehow you could
you wouldnt just bring
your ba back
youd also bring back
his dream
kumandra
soft music playing
exhales softly
do you think
he would even recognize me
so much has changed
of course he will
you remind me of him
oh yeah strong
goodlooking
with impeccable hair
chuckles softly
hopeful
how would i even
approach namaari
after all thats happened
it may feel impossible
but sometimes
you just have to take
the first step
even before youre ready
trust me
soft sentimental music
playing
okay well go with your plan
what my plan
youre gonna go with my plan
yeah
laughs all right
youre not gonna regret this
but were gonna need
a really good gift
what do you think shes into
cats knives
cats with knives
laughs
sisu knives with little cats
on them
actually i know exactly what
to give her
and that is how
the land of fang rose
in spite of all the monsters
that wanted to destroy us
because were smart resilient
and we take care of one another
mother we need to talk
its princess namaari
children exclaiming
all right all right
now run along kittens
children mumbling disappointedly
i have to speak with the princess
mother you wont believe what i saw
you saw a dragon
general atitāya informed me
that youd be returning home
without the gem pieces
it was sisu
she can fix what we broke
she can bring everyone back
and thats what scares me
when everyone comes back
who do you think
theyll come for
you forget
the other lands blame us
for whats happened
but we we never meant
for anyone to get hurt
yes but if we had the dragon
and the gem pieces
we would be forgiven
we could save the world
but more importantly
our people would remain safe
but raya isnt just gonna
give sisu to us
sighs
were not going to give her
a choice
what are you going to do
thats no longer
your concern my love
youve done enough
soft tense music playing
if she refuses to help
weve just flushed
our tactical advantage
into the dung pot
i know
yeah she really has no reason
to help us
i know
this jerkys terrible
