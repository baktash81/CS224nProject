another world a secret world
but the war in neighboring
vietnam burst its borders
and the fighting soon spread
to neutral cambodia
in 1973 i went to cover
this sideshow struggle
as foreign correspondent
of the new york times
it was there amidst the fighting
between government troops
and the khmer rouge guerrillas
that i met my guide
and interpreter dith pran
a man who was to change my life
in a country that i grew to love
and pity
so here we go
with voice of america
news for southeast asia
its 645 and a partly cloudy
morning here
clouds too in washington
president nixon announced hell
address the nation on watergate
within the next few days
the speech will be nixons
first since may
the scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the white house staff
it has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps
a constitutional crisis
with senate investigators
and a special
watergate prosecutor
the speech was announced
after the gallup poll disclosed
that mr nixons popularity
had fallen to the lowest point
for an american president
in 20 years
a supreme court judge
william o douglas
has ruled against an appeal
by the administration
for a stay of the injunction
on further us bombing
missions in cambodia
congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal
and they should cease in one
weeks time on august the 15th

sydney this way
sydney look khmer rouge
in washington the
cambodian ambassador
in a speech to
the washington press club said
lets face it you took
advantage of us
i cant eat
you are cleverer than we are and
you induced us into this fighting
indeed the khmer rouge
insurgents in cambodia
have tightened their ring
around the capital phnom penh
now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting
reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad
that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep
in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital
no more electricity
and now i get a message
to try for negotiations
well its just too goddamn late
alan this countrys split apart
we put this ship to sea and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port
any port
what pisses me off is this country
has faults and strengths
and we have done nothing
but play to the faults
i tell you i will be damn
glad to get out of here
this thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light
after what the khmer rouge
have been through
they wont be exactly
affectionate toward westerners
where do you want this
on the floor anywhere

wait just a minute
hes a journalist and hes with me
where is the consul i want to talk
to the consul let me see him
you tell me where he is
i want to speak to him
the picture in cambodia
is increasingly unclear
journalists who have flown
from thailand over phnom penh
report that the khmer rouge
have attempted
a mass evacuation
of the entire population
radio contact with the french embassy
reveals that some 200 europeans
and an undisclosed number
of cambodians have taken refuge
as yet no statement has been made
by the new rulers of cambodia
the whereabouts of prince sihanouk
and the khmer rouge leadership
are not clear
okay
yes hes sleeping
thats the consul
did you see that dennis
the russians are coming
look piss off please
get out you wont get
anything here out
first the main points of the news
bbc dougal
daily reports of fighting
around the airport
14 kilometers outside phnom penh
the capital of cambodia
and now an onthespot report
from our correspondent in thailand
hugh elder
where do they get this crap
do you see that guy across the gate
the little guy
could we not all look at once please
i have it on reliable sources
that thats hugh elder
youre kidding
hes disguised but i got suspicious
about him you know what i mean
how does he get copy out
how does he get his copy out
with specially trained hens
the bbc has like commissioned
them to walk past the khmer rouge
like their regular fowl
theyve been crossing the border into
thailand every day and every night
i told you
unconfirmed reports say
the khmer rouge are demanding
that any officials of
the defeated lon nol government
especially the socalled
six traitors of the cabinet
be handed over to them
it is not known whether
any of the exministers
may have taken refuge
in the embassy
where in the words of a unicef
representative in bangkok
the situation is said to be
increasingly precarious
and when i tried to go
just a kilometer further no
the only sense i can make of it
is that theres
some sort of internal
power struggle going on
different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city
and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control
half of them are under 15
some red cross instruction
