another world  a secret world 
but the war in neighboring
vietnam burst its borders   
   and the fighting soon spread
to neutral cambodia 
in 1973  i went to cover
this sideshow struggle   
   as foreign correspondent
of the new york times 
it was there  amidst the fighting   
   between government troops
and the khmer rouge guerrillas   
   that i met my guide
and interpreter  dith pran   
   a man who was to change my life   
   in a country that i grew to love
and pity 
so here we go
with voice of america   
   news for southeast asia 
it s 6 45 and a partly cloudy
morning here 
clouds too in washington 
president nixon announced he ll
address the nation on watergate   
   within the next few days 
the speech will be nixon s
first since may 
the scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the white house staff 
it has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps   
   a constitutional crisis
with senate investigators   
   and a special
watergate prosecutor 
the speech was announced
after the gallup poll disclosed   
   that mr  nixon s popularity
had fallen to the lowest point   
   for an american president
in 20 years 
a supreme court judge 
william o  douglas   
   has ruled against an appeal
by the administration   
   for a stay of the injunction   
   on further u s  bombing
missions in cambodia 
congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal   
   and they should cease in one
week s time on august the 15th 
let s go  sarun

sydney  this way 
sydney  look  khmer rouge 
in washington  the
cambodian ambassador   
   in a speech to
the washington press club said 
 let s face it  you took
advantage of us  
i can t eat 
 you are cleverer than we are  and
you induced us into this fighting  
indeed  the khmer rouge
insurgents in cambodia   
   have tightened their ring
around the capital  phnom penh   
   now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting 
reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad   
   that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep   
   in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital 
no more electricity 
and now i get a message
to try for negotiations 
well  it s just too goddamn late 
alan  this country s split apart 
we put this ship to sea  and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port 
any port 
what pisses me off is  this country
has faults and strengths   
   and we have done nothing
but play to the faults 
i tell you  i will be damn
glad to get out of here 
this thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light 
after what the khmer rouge
have been through   
   they won t be exactly
affectionate toward westerners 
  where do you want this 
  on the floor  anywhere

the picture in cambodia
is increasingly unclear 
journalists who have flown
from thailand over phnom penh   
   report that the khmer rouge
have attempted   
   a mass evacuation
of the entire population 
radio contact with the french embassy
reveals that some 200 europeans   
   and an undisclosed number
of cambodians have taken refuge 
as yet  no statement has been made
by the new rulers of cambodia 
the whereabouts of prince sihanouk
and the khmer rouge leadership   
   are not clear 
  okay 
  yes  he s sleeping 
that s the consul 
  did you see that  dennis 
  the russians are coming 
look  piss off  please 
get out  you won t get
anything here  out 
first  the main points of the news 
bbc  dougal 
  daily reports of fighting
around the airport   
   14 kilometers outside phnom penh 
the capital of cambodia 
and now  an on the spot report
from our correspondent in thailand   
   hugh elder 
where do they get this crap 
do you see that guy across the gate 
the little guy 
could we not all look at once  please 
i have it on reliable sources
that that s hugh elder 
you re kidding 
he s disguised  but i got suspicious
about him  you know what i mean 
  how does he get copy out 
  how does he get his copy out 
with specially trained hens 
the bbc has  like  commissioned
them to walk past the khmer rouge   
   like their regular fowl 
they ve been crossing the border into
thailand every day and every night 
i told you 
unconfirmed reports say
the khmer rouge are demanding   
   that any officials of
the defeated lon nol government   
   especially the so called
six traitors of the cabinet   
   be handed over to them 
it is not known whether
any of the ex ministers   
   may have taken refuge
in the embassy   
   where  in the words of a unicef
representative in bangkok   
   the situation is said to be
 increasingly precarious  
and when i tried to go
just a kilometer further  no 
the only sense i can make of it
is that there s   
   some sort of internal
power struggle going on 
different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city   
   and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control 
half of them are under 15 
some red cross instruction
