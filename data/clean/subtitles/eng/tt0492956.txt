a tremendous showdown
we have a rematch
of last years conference final
in which denver narrowly escaped
with a 3430 victory
he has the tight end screen
he sidearms it
the catch made by cooper
cooper on the run picks up a blocker
and now directing traffic
nice cut cooper down the sideline
and hes bounced out of bounds

you see ballerinas can leap

for hours and hours
so if ballet were easy
theyd call it football

listen sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet
and call an audible okay and
here this
when the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz
and all of a sudden
youve got to call an audible
to change the play
and you go around and you score
he scores
all right its kind of like just like in life
sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly
then you got to call an audible
you got to learn on the go
just like us okay
