getting the hang of things 
but it s like everything else in his life 
he never says  no   
i mean  he s teaching me
that you can do anything
if you ve got motivation
and determination 
and the place where that starts
is right here  in the heart 
you re the world s greatest father 
that was good 
  that was really good 
  it s going to cost you 
   two  three  four  grand plié   
there you go  there you go

so i m really sorry 
i m sure maybe we can
work something out 
money s no object 
as you probably know 
okay  the thing is
that this is a professional school  and   
  that s very nice

hi  everybody  i m marv albert 
along with boomer esiason 
we re here in the mile high city
where denver hosts boston
in the first round of the playoffs 
in what should be
a tremendous showdown 
we have a rematch
of last year s conference final
in which denver narrowly escaped
with a 34 30 victory 
he has the tight end screen 
he side arms it 
the catch made by cooper 
cooper on the run  picks up a blocker 
and now  directing traffic   
nice cut  cooper down the sideline 
and he s bounced out of bounds 
yeah  i did it again 
oh  our boy looks great today 
he s going to look even greater
lounging poolside
at the new blake resort 
let s just see how many fanny s
kiddie meals he sells first 
fanny 
do you work at fanny s burgers 
i own fanny s burgers  honey 
my mom says   
i mean  my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock 
yeah  they do  they rock  come on 
kick it 
kingman out of the gun 
takes a look 
he has sanders wide open 
he s not going that way 
marv  i ve never
seen a quarterback
who doesn t trust his wide receivers
with a game on the line like this 
touchdown  it s all over 
boston has defeated denver 
all on the legs of joe kingman 
boston advances
to next week s divisional playoffs
for the second year in a row 
now  will this be the year the king
takes them all the way 
peyton  are you okay 
why are you still here 
i guess joe s running a little bit late
from practice 
what  two hours late 
that s unacceptable 
come on  sweetie  let s go 
hey  king 
no  i m the king  you re the king 
don t do it  elvis 
don t jump 
mr  kingman 
oh  no  peyton 
hey 
yeah  i guess practice ran a little
longer than expected  thanks  bo 
  mr  kingman  we need to talk about   
  you know what 
why don t you just call me joe 
stop it  stop it 
mr  kingman 
i informed you from the start
that we are a ballet school 
not a daycare center 
yeah  i got that  mental note 
i m glad you told me  now i know 
ballet school  not a daycare facility 
sure  let me hook you up
for your time  though 
peyton  go grab a hundo out of my bag 
it s in my wallet  around the corner 
i just knew
you were one of those parents 
one of what parents 
the kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else s 
look  lady 
i don t know what kind of parent i am 
all i know is i have an entire team   
scratch that 
an entire city depending on me 
yeah  you also have a daughter
depending on you
not to only take care of her 
but to care about her  okay 
  listen  i care about peyton 
  then prove it 
  i got it 
  hey  sweetie 
your father here was telling me
how excited he is
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school 
and guess what 
i ve got the perfect job for him 
cool 
no  no  no  absolutely not 
you re completely insane 
you re a freakishly large man
and you re telling me you re incapable
of playing a tree  come on 
no  what i m telling you is
i am a serious athlete 
not a ballerina 
you do me a favor  mamita 
can you please hold this for me 
thank you so much 
trust me  no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina  okay 
and now 
i need you to be an enchanted tree   
i m not going to be an enchanted tree 
i m a quarterback 
i m the only one that talks 
up 
   around and    oh  my god  no  no   
please  come over here 
wasn t so bad 
we re just warming up  so come on 
hey  so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport 
hmm 
it wasn t    it wasn t so bad 
you see  ballerinas can leap
as high as you can 
but when they go down 
they go down in plié 
and they hold and hold 
and then they go en pointe
for hours and hours 
so  if ballet were easy 
they d call it football 
yeah  right 
yeah  right 
listen  mr  kingman 
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer 
she has passion  talent  discipline 
i guess she inherited more
than just your charm 
you see 
let s try that one again 
where were you last night 
you missed a great fight 
hey  man 
you look like you were in a fight 
i was doing some stuff 
well  you could ve called 
you never call anymore 
dude  stop being such a chick 
never thought someone so little
could be so much work  huh 
you don t know the half of it 
  hello 
hi 
listen  i finally got to a phone 
i want you to tell me everything 
i don t know where to start 
how about those pictures
you promised me 
e  mail me right now 
i have to see you 
okay  hold on 
i just sent them 
you re breaking up  i love you 
wait  wait  no  no  peyton  honey   
i love you  too 
we need to talk  follow me 
i need my bed back 
wow  that is awesome  i love it 
love it  i love this room 
this is awesome 
it s beautiful 
  thanks  joe 
  you re welcome 
look  p  you know the whole
 playbook for the house  thing 
no more buttonhooks in the kitchen 
right  no more buttonhooks 
you see  the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook
better than anybody 
but you and i 
you ve been playing kid your entire life 
i just joined the dad team 
and i m still learning all these plays 
no kidding 
all right 
listen  sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet
and call an audible  okay  and   
here  this 
when the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz
and all of a sudden
you ve got to call an audible
to change the play 
and you go around and you score 
he scores 
all right  it s kind of like  just like in life 
sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly 
then you got to call an audible 
you got to learn on the go 
  just like us  okay 
  okay 
number one on the field 
and number one in your heart 
  now  number one on your toothbrush 
  that s funny 
my teeth are really white 
ding 
that s ridiculous
