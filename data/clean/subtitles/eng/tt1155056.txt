just to clarify here
my dad worked for ibm
so we moved a lot when i was a kid
robbie always managed to have friends
of course he probably wanted
to suck their dicks but
oswald
no mom its cool i totally did
but he doesnt have to use
that kind of language
indeed
why
my son is a gay man
and i embrace his lifestyle
its true dad loves the gays
i actually made him
an honorary homo last month
the point is zooey peter always
connected better with women
you know i can see that
because hes a great boyfriend
thank you fiancée
also you gotta understand zooey
peter matured sexually
at a very early age
i remember taking him swimming
when he was 12 years old
kid had a bush
like a 40yearold serbian

be proud

into his relationships
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside

but it costs 30000
this house must be
what 4 42 million

he hasnt slept with yet
the feng shui
yeah
how do you know that

zooey you are about to marry
one of the most honest
kind and funloving people
ive ever had the honor of knowing
the pistol is a pleasuregiver
thats for sure
yeah a fucking puke pistol
and the thing about a man like that
a man like peter
is that he never asks
for anything in return
and thats why im here
im here as peters friend
as peters confidant
just to say to you beautiful zooey
give it back yeah
return the favor
and if you do
i guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasurefilled union
i dont think she sucks his dick
watch your mouth
with that id like to raise a glass
to pete and zooey
cheers
peter and zooey
cheers

about me
nothing
i mean aside from how much i love you
so what was with all that
pleasuregiver stuff
i dont
i might have mentioned in passing
or something
that you dont like doing oral sex
peter that stuff is private
is it really
and telling hailey and denise
about the hot tub in mexico isnt
that is so different theyre
what how
ive known them forever
so
peter see sydneys like a stranger
hardly hes become
a really good friend of mine
and now you know how i feel
when theres no privacy
between you and your girlfriends
i thought you loved those guys
i do i love them but you know
some things i want to remain
between you and me
okay okay
by the way
its not that i dont like doing it
its just that
rodney just hated getting them
wait what guy hates getting blowjobs
he had some weird
intimacy problems okay
by the end of our relationship he would
literally shiver when i touched him
but before that i always liked it
i liked it
great thats great
perfect i mean no pressure
its not like im saying
hey lets go home tonight
and get some bjs but you know
look if sydney hadnt asked me
about our sex life

with the ferrigno house
you have all of the skills in the world
and you have no confidence
now sack up man
put on the fucking suit
i cant believe you just touched my balls
hey so listen i also wanted
to talk to you about something
this investment opportunity
has come up its a total winner
the only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities
so im cash poor right now
so i was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels
how much are we talking about
you know 8
8000 thats thats a lot of
thats a lot of quiche you know
a lot of cake
it just it might be a little tricky
just cause zooeys dad
is out of the picture
and you know
were paying for the wedding ourselves
you know what enough said
an opportunity came up
i thought i would ask no big deal
can you tell me about the investment
i cant actually
its confidential in nature so
okay let me think about it
yeah of course buddy
hello peter
doug
this is my
sydney
sydney this is sydney
you know it takes a lot of nerve
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone
and then never call them again
doug i can explain
i just wish i could take back that kiss
because i felt something
that i havent felt in years
and now i know
it was the taste of betrayal
it wasnt the taste of betrayal
it was the taste of betrayal
no it really wasnt
it was the taste of betrayal
you fucking whore
doug
good day
doug wait
i can actually explain what just
i would love to hear that
wow i mean i knew when i got
the nod for the engagement dinner
you didnt have a ton of friends
but i had no idea it went that far
truth is i never even thought about it
until zooey and i got engaged
its like
you were basically just using me
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party
dude no not it at all
id actually given up
on meeting someone
and then you wandered
into that open house we hit it off
and threequarters of the rush
songbook later here we are
i just wish youd have told me
well i was embarrassed
i mean youve had a close group
of male friends your whole life i havent
i started feeling
like some kind of weirdo
i get it but i just want you to know
that youre my friend
and you can tell me anything
thanks sydney i appreciate that
hey man look about that investment
pete please
forget i even brought it up honestly
ive been saving my whole life
and you were right
im gonna sell the ferrigno place
fuck yeah you are
id be happy to lend you the money
i know youre good for it
pistol that is great thank you
its the least i could do
for the best man at my wedding
what are you talking about
i want you to stand up there with me
are you cool with that
am i cool with that
of course ill be your best man
thats an honor its
youre a whore peter
i think were almost there
i think were almost there too
i think its just about putting
the random people together
yeah
we should talk about the main table
because if hailey doesnt find a date
before the wedding
which lets be honest
it seems pretty likely that she wont
i know
we have an extra seat at our table
well i was thinking that maybe
sydney would sit at our table
i asked him to be my best man
great thats awesome
that was the whole thing
im not an idiot
youre not psyched about this at all
no its just
i feel like he has some issue with me
what no you guys just havent
spent any time together
weve spent some time together
ill talk to him
peter do not talk to him
hes gonna think
im saying stuff behind his back
you are saying stuff behind his back
no im just sharing a feeling with you
and i want you to
but peter
please dont say anything to him
okay i wont
so we still have
to pick up the marriage license
can you meet up tomorrow afternoon
totally yeah perfect
so whatd she say
about me being your best man
she was pumped
she thought it was awesome
come on dude
im the worst liar
i promised her i wouldnt say anything
well what is it
she thinks you dont like her
what that is no of course i like her
are you
weve only hung out a few times
but shes gonna be your wife
of course i like her
this dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever
oh man
dude why is ferrigno eating
with that urinalcakefaced fuckhead
we gotta confront him hold this
no wait sydney wait wait
wait sydney
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
what the fuck is going on here
do i know you
no you dont know me
but i believe you know
my friend peter klaven
who has an exclusive listing
on this mans property
lou you promised peter
the commission to your house
i know but hes not doing shit with it
that is total crap hulk all right
listen this kind of stuff
doesnt happen overnight
peter who the hell is this guy
hulk let me tell you something
about peter
look please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me hulk
im a person okay
im a person okay
i warned you
you warned me
hello
hey
im on my way to the marriage bureau
fuck you lou ferrigno

hey
fuck you hulk
oh shit
what the what are you doing
whats going on
sydney hes fighting lou ferrigno
peter hes so strong
easy dont fight it
the hulk has me in a sleeper hold
and i dont think i can take him
easy thats it
peter
wow
peter
why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with lou ferrigno
sydneys a hothead
he thought he was standing up for me
to the incredible hulk
no thats just a character he played
in real life lous actually a sweet man
so what does that mean
for your development property
it means its over
without the ferrigno commission
im not gonna be able to afford it
you have some money saved up
cant you just write them a check
you know to show your good faith
between the wedding and then
you know i lent sydney some money
i mean its just im gonna be short
thats it
wait wait wait wait wait wait
you lent sydney money
for an investment
all his moneys tied up in equities
hes gonna pay me back
peter thats not the point
were getting married you cant
just keep stuff like this from me
can i ask you a question
why do you think were getting married
what are you talking about
no its just sydney asked me
that question and i couldnt
well why zooey
and i didnt know how to answer it
are you kidding youre kidding right
yes
two weeks before our wedding
and you dont know
why youre marrying me
just forget it it was a stupid question
i dont even know what i was thinking
just forget take it back 10 seconds
before i asked it
and lets live in that time
the thing is peter
i get why you would wonder that i do
but i wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me
thats the thing
before i didnt even think about it
that came out bad too
i didnt im so
im confused
i dont know what im saying
let me just make this
a little simpler for you
im gonna go stay
with denise and barry
and you and your bud sydney
can hang out and beat up lou ferrigno
and go to rush concerts
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the venice boardwalk for all i care
we never rode bicycles
goodbye
zooey come on this is ridiculous
zooey zooey
oh my god
my god
all right he put up some billboards
put up some billboards
oh my god
oh god no
fuck me over fucking fucking fuck
are you kidding me
come on
yeah its open
hey
thats what you borrowed 8000 for
you saw the billboards
pretty awesome right
pretty awesome
my buddy dave sells ad space
so he got us a great deal
pretty awesome theyre idiotic
you put my face on a 10foot dick
over santa monica boulevard
yeah its hilarious
well in one day you managed to screw
my career you ruined my relationship
what are you talking about
ruin your relationship
zooey walked out on me
because i asked her
why we were getting married
why would you ask her that
pete that conversation
was between you and me
you cant have that talk with her i just
look i assumed you understood that
god i am so sick
of your ridiculous rules
i like it that i can share things
with zooey
i like it that if i cant sleep at night
shes there to talk to
do you know the best night
ive had in the last five years
is the night
that zooey and i split a bottle of wine
we made a summer salad
and watched chocolat together
you mean chocolate
chocolat
chocolate with johnny depp
chocolat
youre not fucking french pete
its called chocolate
chocolate has got an e on it
that was your favorite night
yes
your best night in five years is
watching chocolate with johnny depp
you should be ashamed of yourself
the combination of wine
and summer salad and chocolat yeah
you should be embarrassed
you know i think youre threatened
by what zooey and i have
because youre afraid
i wont be able to hang out every night
hey you know what
i have a ton of friends all right
yeah who are all moving on
with their lives
theyre in relationships they have kids
theyre growing up
hey lets not forget
you were the one using me
i think we were using each other
whatever

whats going on right now

some time apart

so if i actually do
wind up having a wedding
its probably best that you not be there
yeah sounds good to me pete

those billboards taken down
