this cluster of live work lofts
all along the perimeter here 
and    come here 
i also am planning this neighborhood y
kind of dining and retail area
in the central square 
you know  i even had this thought
that maybe you  denise and hailey
could open up a second location
for your store 
really  because denise keeps talking
about wanting to open up
another branch 
well  it d be great  yeah 
look  the land is a little pricey 
so i couldn t develop it right away 
but once i sell the ferrigno estate 
i figured out i could at least
put a down payment on it
and still have enough money left over
for the reception in santa barbara 
what are you talking about 
what reception 
zooey  i know it s only been
eight months 
but i am so madly  insanely 
ridiculously in love with you 
will you marry me

and you end up marrying
some totally awesome guy
who randomly walks into our store

she s on speakerphone 
you do not know how lucky you are 
it is impossible
to find a good guy in this city

  congratulations 
  thanks  mom

  this is delicious  thank you so much 
  really is  mom 
thank you 
but did peter have any good friends
growing up 
i honestly don t remember any 
all right  look  zooey 
just to clarify here 
my dad worked for ibm 
so we moved a lot when i was a kid 
robbie always managed to have friends 
of course  he probably wanted
to suck their dicks  but   
oswald 
no  mom  it s cool  i totally did 
but he doesn t have to use
that kind of language 
  indeed 
  why 
my son is a gay man 
and i embrace his lifestyle 
it s true  dad loves the gays 
i actually made him
an honorary homo last month 
the point is  zooey  peter always
connected better with women 
you know  i can see that
because he s a great boyfriend 
thank you  fiancée 
also  you gotta understand  zooey 
peter matured sexually
at a very early age 
i remember taking him swimming
when he was 12 years old 
kid had a bush
like a 40 year old serbian 
come on  okay 
dad  please  stop talking 
  good to know 
  nice 
come on  he had a speedo full of brillo 
be proud 
god 
who invited the stand up comedian
over here 
zooey  here s the deal 
peter s always been a  girlfriend guy  
he put all his focus and energy
into his relationships 
and all his dude friends
just fell by the wayside 
zooey  don t listen to him  all right 
i mean  we re eight years apart 
barely grew up together
in the same house 
this is ridiculous 
why is it weird that i had girlfriends 
nothing  we re just saying
you never really had a best friend  is all

my closest friend
since our first year at ibm

it s gonna be a little weird
if we re walking down the aisle alone 
  yeah  i know 
  he s great

  hello 
  hi 
  lf you need any help  just let me know 
  thanks

thank you for eating 
  i m the first one  huh 
  yeah 
i never understood why people
are so afraid to eat at an open house 
i know 
why s ferrigno selling 
he bought a place in jackson hole 
yeah  i think he s tired
of the hollywood grind 
right 
you know  i ve always wanted a pad
with a giant lou ferrigno statue 
so i think i ve found it 
he s got one 
you re wasting your time
with that couple  just fyi 
why do you say that 
i saw the guy pull in 
he s driving a saab 9 3 
which  i m not a snob  it s a great car 
but it costs  30 000 
this house must be 
what  4   4 2 million 
doesn t quite compute  right 
well  i hope that s not the case 
he told me he was gonna make an offer 
i think he s trying to impress that girl
he hasn t slept with yet 
  the feng shui 
  yeah 
how do you know that 
well  it s body language  you know 
look  that guy needs to fart 
it s pretty clear 
but he doesn t know her well enough
to do it in front of her 
so i assume they haven t slept together 
  i like it  you okay 
  yeah  no  i m fine  i m good 
  he does seem to be clenching 
  yeah  he doesn t wanna fart 
watch  when he gets enough space 
he s gonna let one rip  i guarantee you 
that s a good move 
 hey  go check out the kitchen  honey 
i ll meet you in there  
  okay  yeah 
  now watch 
he s making his move slowly 
slowly but surely  watch the leg 
wait for it  wait for it  fart 
  boom  that s a fart  motherfucker 
  oh  my god 
  that s a fucking fart 
  oh  my god 
look at him crop dusting across
your open house  it s a disgrace 
  he farted in my open house 
  he sure did 
you know what  guy 
i like it  but i m thinking
it might be a little bit small 
totally  and it smells like fart 
  what 
  never mind 
let s take off  baby  come on 
roll down the windows
in that car  sweetheart 
you called that 
that was like a play by play 
that s amazing  you called that

come with me

this is where i jerk off 
and the condoms 
  i wear them when i masturbate 
  are you kidding me 
i always get this reaction 
but the fact is they decrease sensitivity
so i can last longer 
and there s no sticky mess to clean up 
and when your divorcées come over 
you put them away 
pete  this is the man cave 
there s no women allowed in here 
i got a jerk off station  for god s sakes 
sit down  man 
what about when your guy friends

  all right 
when was the last time you did it  pete 
i m not gonna tell you that 
hey  listen  you think of this place
as a cone of silence  all right 
i m not gonna tell anybody
any of the things you say in here 
you have my word 
zooey went to the pasadena flea market
with her friends last weekend 
and i did it then 
well  that sounds lovely

  really 
so you ve told zooey that you jacked off
to her picture last weekend 
well  no  but   
all right  well  you shared
that information with me  didn t you 
so there are dividing lines

together a couple of months ago

  we ve been jamming a lot   
  i don t play any instruments 
i slap some bass 
and then sydney s an axman 
 cause i was gonna say
if you wanted to jam with us 
you know  that d be cool 
but you don t have   
you have a piano in your house  though 
don t you 
  yeah  i don t play

  mrs  klaven  the banquet room is ready 
  and who s mr  sunshine here 
hi  this is my husband  barry 
come on back  everybody 
the banquet room is ready 
well  i m filling myself up 
i need to undo my pants 
there s a lot of protein  but i love it 
if i may  i think it s only fitting
that we re eating tonight at hop louie s
because this is  after all 
peter s favorite restaurant
to bring all of his dates 
so of course he would bring zooey here
their first night out 
  just like the rest of them 
  no 
i remember that night when peter
got home  he called me and he said 
 mom  this is the girl i m gonna marry  
and it s not just because she wanted
an extra order of slippery shrimp 
on the first date 
  hey  now 
  sometimes 
but the point is 
here we are eight months later 
peter  zooey 
we love you 
and we wish only the best for you both 
  cheers 
  cheers 
  to peter and zooey 
  cheers 
  cheers 
  thanks  mom 
  cheers  bro 
  thanks 
well  i promised denise
we d be gone after appetizers  so   
you know what 
i d actually like to just say a few words
  if it s cool with the table 
  wow 
what an honor it is to be sitting here
with peter and zooey s friends  family 
hailey  robbie s lover 
robbie  oz  joyce 
thank you
for hosting this beautiful dinner 
you got this guy
with the smoking hot wife 
and finally  we got zooey 
zooey  you are about to marry
one of the most honest 
kind and fun loving people
i ve ever had the honor of knowing 
the pistol is a pleasure giver 
that s for sure 
yeah  a fucking puke pistol 
and the thing about a man like that 
a man like peter 
is that he never asks
for anything in return 
and that s why i m here 
i m here as peter s friend 
as peter s confidant 
just to say to you  beautiful zooey 
give it back  yeah 
return the favor 
and if you do 
i guarantee that you will have a beautiful
and pleasure filled union 
  i don t think she sucks his dick 
  watch your mouth 
with that  i d like to raise a glass
to pete and zooey 
cheers 
  peter and zooey 
  cheers 
what the hell did you tell sydney
about me 
nothing 
i mean  aside from how much i love you 
so  what was with all that
pleasure giver stuff 
i don t   
i might have mentioned in passing
or something
that you don t like doing oral sex 
  peter  that stuff is private 
  is it  really 
and telling hailey and denise
about the hot tub in mexico isn t 
  that is so different  they re   
  what  how 
  i ve known them forever 
  so 
peter  see  sydney s like a stranger 
hardly  he s become
a really good friend of mine 
and now you know how i feel
when there s no privacy
  between you and your girlfriends 
  i thought you loved those guys 
i do  i love them  but  you know 
some things i want to remain
between you and me 
okay  okay 
by the way 
it s not that i don t like doing it 
it s just that
rodney just hated getting them 
wait  what guy hates getting blowjobs 
he had some weird
intimacy problems  okay 
by the end of our relationship  he would
literally shiver when i touched him 
but before that  i always liked it 
i liked it 
great  that s great 
perfect  i mean  no pressure 
it s not like i m saying 
 hey  let s go home tonight
and get some bjs   but  you know   
look  if sydney hadn t asked me
about our sex life 
we wouldn t even be talking about this 
  that s true 
  yeah 
you re right 
  and hailey was really into him 
  she was 
yeah  she liked how honest
and direct he was with her 
and  yeah  i know  that s the way he is 
that s his thing 
  the four of us should go out 
  yeah  that d be great 
yeah 
sweet 
  well  have a good pilates class 
  i will 
  be sure to drink lots of water 
  yeah 
  hey

  yeah  i fucked her 
i wonder if my pineapple

and mine is long and skinny 
yeah 
pete  can i talk to you about something 
  yeah  what s up

and i was just    i got so nervous 
it wasn t so great 
i want you to know i m really sorry 
everybody must hate me 
no  no  no 
look  you had good intentions 
  i did 
  i know one person that didn t hate you 
was it benji s wife 
she s a hot piece of ass 
  no  hailey 
  yeah  she was funny 
i think she likes you 
we should all go out 
she seems great  pete  but honestly 
within five minutes of meeting her 
she was telling me how she can t wait
to get married and have kids 
look  she was kidding around 
i made reservations to play golf
on sunday for the four of us 
no  pete  i told you 
i don t play sports with women 
look  man  you told my fiancée
that she needs to give me blowies
in front of my whole family  all right 
you owe me 
  you make a valid point

  i mean  what s the big deal 
  the big deal is
that we were supposed to have
a date night 
and you took me to this concert 
which is cool 
but then we get there
and it s like i don t even exist 
you don t even look at me 
you re licking sydney s bass guitar 
there were tons of guys
that were licking each other s basses 
i just   
i feel like i m losing you a little bit 
what  we were just doing
a recap of the set list 
  what  zooey 
  okay 
i was going over the set list 
so the big day s coming up 
how are you feeling 
well  you know 
i was feeling really good 
but zooey and i have been
fighting a lot recently 
all right  let me ask you a question 
why are you marrying her 
what kind of question is that 
well  it seems to me like you ve gone
from relationship to relationship 
so is zooey the one
or is she just the next one 
no  she s the one 
all right  well  how come 
because 
i don t know  we re in love 
and   
that s a hard question to answer 
listen  i m not trying to push you at all 
it s just for me 
sometimes talking this stuff out helps
to clarify things  that s all 
let s go try on some penguin suits 
thank you  lovely  what s your name 
  raquel 
  that was my mother s name 
so i m thinking about asking tevin
if he wants in on the ferrigno house 
dude  i pissed on that guy s face
at a bennigan s 
you do not need
to be splitting commission
with that frosty haired chode 
i have to face facts  syd

tevin s got the flash needed
to sell the place 
what do you think

and get on

like the coolest man on earth 
  the name is bond  oh  yeah

the name is james bond 
james bond 
i ll have a margarita 
well  hey there  miss moneypussy

i don t know how   
all right  maybe i was wrong 
let s see the back 
you know what 
i m not sure i m in love with the drape 
what s wrong with the drape 
does the vent move funny 
you should wear something
with a little more pizzazz  right 
  a little more flash 
  you don t like the split panel 
  peacock it out a bit 
  no 
  let s try   
  what are those  checkers 
  here  give this one a try 
  give me a break 
  no way  man 
  come on 
i can t fricking pull that off  it s blue 
look at me 
you have this image of yourself
as this straight laced  tight guy 
but i ve seen you cut loose
in the man cave  and it is fantastic 
well  yeah  slap a little bass 
yeah  it s the same
with the ferrigno house 
you have all of the skills in the world 
and you have no confidence 
now  sack up  man 
put on the fucking suit 
i can t believe you just touched my balls 
hey  so listen  i also wanted
to talk to you about something 
this investment opportunity
has come up  it s a total winner 
the only problem is
all my funds are tied up in equities 
so i m cash poor right now 
so i was wondering if you would
consider loaning me a few shekels 
how much are we talking about 
you know  8 
 8 000  that s    that s a lot of   
that s a lot of quiche  you know 
a lot of cake 
it just    it might be a little tricky 
just  cause zooey s dad
is out of the picture 
and  you know 
we re paying for the wedding ourselves 
you know what  enough said 
an opportunity came up 
i thought i would ask  no big deal 
can you tell me about the investment 
i can t  actually 
it s confidential in nature  so   
okay  let me think about it 
yeah  of course  buddy 
hello  peter 
doug 
  this is my   
  sydney 
sydney  this is sydney 
you know  it takes a lot of nerve
to spend a beautiful evening
with someone
and then never call them again 
doug  i can explain 
i just wish i could take back that kiss 
because i felt something
that i haven t felt in years 
and now i know
it was the taste of betrayal 
it wasn t the taste of betrayal 
  it was the taste of betrayal 
  no  it really wasn t 
it was the taste of betrayal 
you fucking whore 
  doug 
  good day 
doug  wait 
  i can actually explain what just   
  i would love to hear that 
wow  i mean  i knew when i got
the nod for the engagement dinner
you didn t have a ton of friends 
but i had no idea it went that far 
truth is  i never even thought about it
until zooey and i got engaged 
it s like 
you were basically just using me
because you needed
to fill out your wedding party 
dude  no  not it at all 
i d actually given up
on meeting someone 
and then you wandered
into that open house  we hit it off 
and three quarters of the rush
songbook later  here we are 
  i just wish you d have told me 
  well  i was embarrassed 
i mean  you ve had a close group
of male friends your whole life  i haven t 
i started feeling
like some kind of weirdo 
i get it  but i just want you to know
that you re my friend 
and you can tell me anything 
thanks  sydney  i appreciate that 
hey  man  look  about that investment   
pete  please 
forget i even brought it up  honestly 
i ve been saving my whole life 
and you were right 
i m gonna sell the ferrigno place 
fuck  yeah  you are 
i d be happy to lend you the money 
i know you re good for it 
pistol  that is great  thank you 
it s the least i could do
for the best man at my wedding 
what are you talking about 
i want you to stand up there with me 
are you cool with that 
am i cool with that 
of course i ll be your best man 
that s an honor  it s   
you re a whore  peter 
  i think we re almost there 
  i think we re almost there  too 
i think it s just about putting
the random people together 
  yeah 
  we should talk about the main table 
because if hailey doesn t find a date
before the wedding 
which  let s be honest 
it seems pretty likely that she won t   
i know 
   we have an extra seat at our table 
well  i was thinking that maybe
sydney would sit at our table 
i asked him to be my best man 
great  that s awesome 
that was the whole thing 
i m not an idiot 
you re not psyched about this at all 
no  it s just   
i feel like he has some issue with me 
what  no  you guys just haven t
spent any time together 
  we ve spent some time together 
  i ll talk to him 
peter  do not talk to him 
he s gonna think
i m saying stuff behind his back 
  you are saying stuff behind his back 
  no  i m just sharing a feeling with you 
and i want you to 
but  peter 
please don t say anything to him 
okay  i won t 
so  we still have
to pick up the marriage license 
  can you meet up tomorrow afternoon 
  totally  yeah  perfect 
so  what d she say
about me being your best man 
she was pumped 
she thought it was awesome 
come on  dude 
i m the worst liar 
i promised her i wouldn t say anything 
well  what is it 
she thinks you don t like her 
what  that is    no  of course i like her 
are you   
we ve only hung out a few times 
but she s gonna be your wife 
of course i like her 
this dumb toast
is gonna haunt me forever 
oh  man 
dude  why is ferrigno eating
with that urinal cake faced fuckhead 
we gotta confront him  hold this 
no  wait  sydney  wait  wait 
wait  sydney 
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
what the fuck is going on here 
  do i know you 
  no  you don t know me 
but i believe you know
my friend peter klaven 
who has an exclusive listing
on this man s property 
lou  you promised peter
the commission to your house 
i know  but he s not doing shit with it 
that is total crap  hulk  all right 
listen  this kind of stuff
doesn t happen overnight 
peter  who the hell is this guy 
hulk  let me tell you something
about peter   
look  please get your hand out of
my face and stop calling me hulk 
i m a person  okay 
i m a person  okay 
  i warned you 
  you warned me 
  hello 
  hey 
i m on my way to the marriage bureau 
fuck you  lou ferrigno 
is that sydney 
  hey 
  fuck you  hulk 
oh  shit 
what the    what are you doing 
  what s going on 
  sydney  he s fighting lou ferrigno 
peter  he s so strong 
  easy  don t fight it 
  the hulk has me in a sleeper hold 
  and i don t think i can take him   
  easy  that s it 
peter 
  wow 
  peter 
why the fuck would anyone
get in a fight with lou ferrigno 
sydney s a hothead 
he thought he was standing up for me 
to the incredible hulk 
no  that s just a character he played 
in real life  lou s actually a sweet man 
so  what does that mean
for your development property 
it means it s over 
without the ferrigno commission 
i m not gonna be able to afford it 
you have some money saved up 
can t you just write them a check 
you know  to show your good faith 
between the wedding  and then 
you know  i lent sydney some money 
i mean  it s just i m gonna be short 
that s it 
wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
you lent sydney money 
for an investment 
all his money s tied up in equities 
  he s gonna pay me back 
  peter  that s not the point 
we re getting married  you can t
just keep stuff like this from me 
can i ask you a question 
why do you think we re getting married 
what are you talking about 
no  it s just    sydney asked me
that question  and i couldn t   
 well  why zooey  
and i didn t know how to answer it 
  are you kidding  you re kidding  right 
  yes 
two weeks before our wedding
and you don t know
why you re marrying me 
just forget it  it was a stupid question 
i don t even know what i was thinking 
just forget    take it back 10 seconds
before i asked it 
and let s live in that time 
the thing is  peter 
i get why you would wonder that  i do 
but i wish you would have answered
the question before you proposed to me 
that s the thing 
before i didn t even think about it 
that came out bad  too 
i didn t    i m so   
i m confused 
i don t know what i m saying 
let me just make this
a little simpler for you 
i m gonna go stay
with denise and barry 
and you and your bud sydney
can hang out and beat up lou ferrigno
and go to rush concerts
and ride a tandem bicycle down
the venice boardwalk for all i care 
  we never rode bicycles 
  goodbye 
zooey  come on  this is ridiculous 
zooey  zooey 
oh  my god 
my god 
all right  he put up some billboards 
put up some billboards 
oh  my god 
oh  god  no 
fuck me over  fucking fucking fuck 
are you kidding me 
come on 
yeah  it s open 
hey 
that s what you borrowed  8 000 for 
you saw the billboards 
pretty awesome  right 
pretty awesome 
my buddy dave sells ad space 
so he got us a great deal 
pretty awesome  they re idiotic 
you put my face on a 10 foot dick
over santa monica boulevard 
yeah  it s hilarious 
well  in one day you managed to screw
my career  you ruined my relationship   
what are you talking about 
ruin your relationship 
zooey walked out on me
because i asked her
why we were getting married 
why would you ask her that 
pete  that conversation
was between you and me 
you can t have that talk with her  i just   
look  i assumed you understood that 
god  i am so sick
of your ridiculous rules 
i like it that i can share things
with zooey 
i like it that if i can t sleep at night 
she s there to talk to 
do you know the best night
i ve had in the last five years
is the night
that zooey and i split a bottle of wine 
we made a summer salad 
and watched chocolat together 
  you mean chocolate 
  chocolat 
  chocolate with johnny depp 
  chocolat 
you re not fucking french  pete 
it s called chocolate 
chocolate has got an  e  on it 
  that was your favorite night 
  yes 
your best night in five years is
watching chocolate with johnny depp 
you should be ashamed of yourself 
the combination of wine
and summer salad and chocolat  yeah 
you should be embarrassed 
you know  i think you re threatened
by what zooey and i have
because you re afraid
i won t be able to hang out every night 
hey  you know what 
i have a ton of friends  all right 
yeah  who are all moving on
with their lives 
they re in relationships  they have kids 
they re growing up 
hey  let s not forget 
you were the one using me 
  i think we were using each other 
  whatever 
i really don t understand
what s going on right now 
i think we should spend
some time apart 
okay 
so if i actually do
wind up having a wedding 
it s probably best that you not be there 
yeah  sounds good to me  pete 
and if you could have
those billboards taken down   
yeah  yeah  yeah  no  it ll take
a few days  but i will get on that 
and i ll also make sure you get
