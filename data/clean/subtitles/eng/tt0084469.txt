oh  geoffrey  don t be
such a fuddy duddy 
your father paid me well
to be a fuddy duddy
and i shall continue to be so
until i get you safely home to london 
you re like a little bird 
what s he saying 
my dear miss
unless they speak the king s english 
i m as much at a loss as you are 
the king s english is fit for selling pigs
not for praising the beauty of
such a perfect desert flower 
el aziz  leave her alone 
she is under my protection 
ah  haboush  and what is
your protection worth 
five gold coins for the girl
and ten if she is a virgin 
we shall meet again 
then the english will be dealt with 
thank you for helping us 
i m afraid geoffrey and i would
have been quite lost without you 
the british east india company
did much business here 
your father was greatly respected 
and a good friend to me 
well that last fellow was
certainly a nuisance 
sheik abdul el aziz is much
more than a nuisance 
he is known as elthatlab    the jackal 
he is a slaver 
pray to god you never
meet such a man alone 
why was he offering you money 
he wanted to buy something
that caught his eye 
my father s watch 
no  you 
he must have been quite taken by you 
he offered an extremely
handsome price 
bloody wogs 
oh  excuse me sir 
i didn t mean you sir 
you must trust no one  miss sarah
the people of the desert
look upon the frangi
the foreigners like yourself
much like the hawk
looks upon the sparrow 
excuse me 
five gold  ten it s enough 
one  two five  twenty five
five gold  ten  fifteen 
one  two  you can do better than
that it s a mountain girl 
fifteen  sixteen  seventeen 
come on  come on
she s a mountain girl 
ten  fifteen 
come on  show us your gold 
you english son of the bitch   
go on with the auction 
today s girls are made of god 
david  what happened 
nothing  mother 
david  it is a sin against god
to look upon such wickedness 
they are heathens  non believers 
they will burn in hell 
bashi  i wish only to hire a caravan
not to purchase one 
so do not try your thieving
tricks on me  my friend 
i must employ extra guards 
the way to damascus
is most dangerous 
the sunrise is magnificent
over baghead 
it would be sad if you were not
around to see the next one 
no  no  watch that trunk 
careful with that  man 
what s the matter with you 
are you asleep 
dr  hahn s medical journal 
it was sarah s father s 
lord scott did not trust any doctor
outside of london 
not without reason  rest his soul 
bloody cholera 
excuse me
excuse me  sir 
you  yes you  sir 
how do you do 
my name is mcbride 
reverend james mcbride from boston
my wife rachel  my son david 
how do you do 
ahmed haboush 
this is miss scott
and her manservant  geoffrey 
bashi  we are loosing precious time 
i wonder if we might join
your private caravan 
we have some money    not much   
the people of god are not
always able to give 
we will be travelling fairly fast 
perhaps you would be
more comfortable
with one of the large
merchant caravans 
but sir  we have been trying to get to
damascus for nearly three months 
it would be an act of christian charity 
oh  yes 
we moslems have always been
very concerned with christian charity 
they won t give us any trouble 
dear lord
bless this food to our use that it may
nature us and give us strength
for our journey and for thy holy work
among the heathens
in jesus  name  amen 
bloody camels 
what this country needs is
a fine english coachmaker   
bring em into the 19th century 
allah is great   
i ll make us some tea  miss 
oh  thank you  geoffrey

el aziz  i delievered them
into your hands as agreed 
i demand my payment 
payment 
for what 
the girl has escaped 
there is little else of value 
you have captured many
women  el aziz 
they will bring you a good price 
one less will not make you a poor man 
the english girl will not be for sale 
she s for me 
this water is foul 
treacherous dog 
perhaps that will improve
the water s taste 
agh  agh    thank you  miss sarah 
we commend these souls
to thy keeping in the sure
and certain knowledge of the
resurrection and eternal life 
ashes to ashes  dust to dust  amen
