oh geoffrey dont be
such a fuddyduddy
your father paid me well
to be a fuddyduddy
and i shall continue to be so
until i get you safely home to london
youre like a little bird
whats he saying
my dear miss
unless they speak the kings english
im as much at a loss as you are
the kings english is fit for selling pigs
not for praising the beauty of
such a perfect desert flower
elaziz leave her alone
she is under my protection
ah haboush and what is
your protection worth
five gold coins for the girl
and ten if she is a virgin
we shall meet again
then the english will be dealt with
thank you for helping us
im afraid geoffrey and i would
have been quite lost without you
the british east india company
did much business here
your father was greatly respected
and a good friend to me
well that last fellow was
certainly a nuisance
sheik abdul elaziz is much
more than a nuisance
he is known as elthatlab the jackal
he is a slaver
pray to god you never
meet such a man alone
why was he offering you money
he wanted to buy something
that caught his eye
my fathers watch
no you
he must have been quite taken by you
he offered an extremely
handsome price
bloody wogs
oh excuse me sir
i didnt mean you sir
you must trust no one miss sarah
the people of the desert
look upon the frangi
the foreigners like yourself
much like the hawk
looks upon the sparrow
excuse me
five gold ten its enough
one two five twenty five
five gold ten fifteen
one two you can do better than
that its a mountain girl
fifteen sixteen seventeen
come on come on
shes a mountain girl
ten fifteen
come on show us your gold
you english son of the bitch
go on with the auction
todays girls are made of god
david what happened
nothing mother
david it is a sin against god
to look upon such wickedness
they are heathens nonbelievers
they will burn in hell
bashi i wish only to hire a caravan
not to purchase one
so do not try your thieving
tricks on me my friend
i must employ extra guards
the way to damascus
is most dangerous
the sunrise is magnificent
over baghead
it would be sad if you were not
around to see the next one
no no watch that trunk
careful with that man
whats the matter with you
are you asleep
dr hahns medical journal
it was sarahs fathers
lord scott did not trust any doctor
outside of london
not without reason rest his soul
bloody cholera
excuse me
excuse me sir
you yes you sir
how do you do
my name is mcbride
reverend james mcbride from boston
my wife rachel my son david
how do you do
ahmed haboush
this is miss scott
and her manservant geoffrey
bashi we are loosing precious time
i wonder if we might join
your private caravan
we have some money not much
the people of god are not
always able to give
we will be travelling fairly fast
perhaps you would be
more comfortable
with one of the large
merchant caravans
but sir we have been trying to get to
damascus for nearly three months
it would be an act of christian charity
oh yes
we moslems have always been
very concerned with christian charity
they wont give us any trouble
dear lord
bless this food to our use that it may
nature us and give us strength
for our journey and for thy holy work
among the heathens
in jesus name amen
bloody camels

a fine english coachmaker
bringem into the 19th century

elaziz i delievered them
into your hands as agreed
i demand my payment
payment
for what
the girl has escaped
there is little else of value
you have captured many
women elaziz
they will bring you a good price
one less will not make you a poor man
the english girl will not be for sale
shes for me
this water is foul
treacherous dog
perhaps that will improve
the waters taste

to thy keeping in the sure
and certain knowledge of the
resurrection and eternal life
