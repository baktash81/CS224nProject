narrator way out west
there was this fella
fella i wanna tell you about
fella by the name
of jeff lebowski
east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him
but he never had
much use for it himself
this lebowski
he called himself the dude
now dude
thats a name no one would
selfapply where i come from
but then there was a lot about
the dude that didnt make
a whole lot of sense to me
and a lot about
where he lived likewise
drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds
narrator but then again
maybe thats why
i found the place
so darned interesting
i know when night has gone
that a new worlds
born at dawn
narrator
they call los angeles
the city of angels
i didnt find it to be that
exactly
but ill allow there are
some nice folks there
course i cant say
i seen london
and i never been to france
and i aint never seen no
queen in her damned undies
as the fella says
but ill tell you what
after seeing los angeles
and this here story
im about to unfold
well i guess
ive seen something
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places
and in english too
so i can die with
a smile on my face
without feeling like
the good lord gypped me
now this here story
im about to unfold
took place back
in the early 9s
just about the time
of our conflict with
saddam and the lraqis
i only mention it cause
sometimes theres a man
i wont say a hero
cause whats a hero
but sometimes theres a man
and im talking about
the dude here
sometimes theres a man
well hes the man
for his time and place
he fits right in there
and thats the dude
in los angeles
and even if he is a lazy man
and the dude was
most certainly that
quite possibly the laziest
in los angeles county
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide
but sometimes theres a man
sometimes theres a man
well i lost my train
of thought here
but
hell i done introduced him
enough
bush on tv with them all
for a collective action
this will not stand
this will not stand
this aggression
against kuwait
here on the range i belong
drifting along
with the tumbling
tumbleweeds
yelling
dude exclaiming
spluttering
gasps
wheres the money

from my toes
up to my ears

rust coloration
and was there anything

phone ringing
my rug was also stolen

no here
separate incidents
answering machine clicks
dude on machine
the dude is not in
do you find them much
these stolen cars
sometimes
wouldnt hold out much hope
for the tape deck though
or the creedence
answering machine beeps
what about the briefcase
woman mr lebowski
id like to see you
call when you get home
and ill send a car for you
my name is maude lebowski
im the one who took your rug
well guess we can
close the file
on that one
door closes
woman chanting
thudding
squeaking
yells
woman speaking
foreign language
ill be with you in
a moment mr lebowski
woman chanting
lndistinct chattering
does the female form
make you uncomfortable
mr lebowski
is that what this
is a picture of
in a sense yes
my art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal
which bothers some men
the word itself makes
some men uncomfortable
vagina
oh yeah
yes they dont like
hearing it and find it
difficult to say
whereas without
batting an eye
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his johnson
johnson
all right mr lebowski
lets get down to cases
my father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother
it was not his to give
now your face
as for this kidnapping
huh
yes i know all about it
and i know that you acted
as courier
let me tell you something
the whole thing stinks to
high heaven
yeah right but let me
explain something about
the rug
do you like sex
mr lebowski
excuse me
sex the physical act
of love coitus
do you like it
i was talking
about my rug
youre not interested in sex
you mean coitus
i like it too
its a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex
it can be a natural
zesty enterprise
however there are
some people
it is called
satyriasis in men
nymphomania in women
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy
oh no
oh yes mr lebowski
these unfortunate souls
cannot love in the true
sense of the word
our mutual acquaintance
bunny is one of these
listen maude
im sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho
but you know i dont see
what this has to do with
you have any kahlua
take a look at this sir
dude oh i know that guy
hes a nihilist
karl hungus
lce cubes clinking
hi
hello
mein dispatcher says
there is something
wrong with dein kabel
yeah come on in
im not really sure
exactly whats really
wrong with the cable
thats why they sent me
i am an expert
the tvs in here
you recognize her
of course
helga bring my tools
thats my friend sherry
she just came over
to use the shower
the story is ludicrous
my name is karl
lch bin expert
you must be here
to fix the cable
lord you can imagine
where it goes from here
he fixes the cable
dont be fatuous jeffrey
little matter to me that
this woman chose to pursue
a career in pornography
nor that she has been
banging jackie treehorn
to use the parlance
of our times
however
i am one of the two trustees
of the lebowski foundation
the other being my father
the foundation takes
youngsters from watts and
shit yeah the achievers
little lebowski urban
achievers yes and proud
we are of all of them
i asked my father about
his withdrawal of 1 million
from the foundation account
and he told me
about this abduction
but i tell you
it is preposterous
this compulsive fornicator
is taking my father for
the proverbial ride
yeah but my
im getting to your rug
my father and l
dont get along
he doesnt approve
of my lifestyle and
needless to say
i dont approve of his
however i hardly
wish to make my fathers
embezzlement a police matter
so im proposing that you
try to recover the money
from the people
you delivered it to
well i could do that
if you successfully do so
i will compensate you
to the tune of 10 of
the recovered sum
a hundred
thousand yes
bones or clams or
whatever you call them
yeah but what about my
your rug yes
well with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs
that dont have sentimental
value for me
and i am sorry about
that crack on the jaw
oh thats fine
that doesnt even
heres the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you
you will receive no bill

unrepentantly
betrayed my trust

but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary
to recover their money
from you jeffrey lebowski
and with brandt as my witness
i will tell you this
any further harm
visited upon bunny
