narrator  way out west
there was this fella 
fella i wanna tell you about 
fella by the name
of jeff lebowski 
 east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him 
but he never had
much use for it himself 
this lebowski 
he called himself the dude 
now dude 
that s a name no one would
self apply where i come from 
but then there was a lot about
the dude that didn t make
a whole lot of sense to me 
and a lot about
where he lived likewise 
drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds
narrator  but then again 
maybe that s why
i found the place
so darned interesting 
i know when night has gone
that a new world s
born at dawn
narrator 
they call los angeles
the city of angels 
i didn t find it to be that 
exactly 
but i ll allow there are
some nice folks there 
course  i can t say
i seen london 
and i never been to france 
and i ain t never seen no
queen in her damned undies 
as the fella says 
but i ll tell you what 
after seeing los angeles
and this here story
i m about to unfold 
well  i guess
i ve seen something
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places 
and in english  too 
so i can die with
a smile on my face
without feeling like
the good lord gypped me 
now  this here story
i m about to unfold
took place back
in the early  9 s 
just about the time
of our conflict with
saddam and the lraqis 
i only mention it  cause
sometimes there s a man   
i won t say a hero 
 cause what s a hero 
but sometimes there s a man   
and i m talking about
the dude here 
sometimes there s a man   
well  he s the man
for his time and place 
he fits right in there 
and that s the dude
in los angeles 
and even if he is a lazy man 
and the dude was
most certainly that 
quite possibly the laziest
in los angeles county 
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide 
but sometimes there s a man   
sometimes there s a man   
well  i lost my train
of thought here 
but   
hell  i done introduced him
enough 
bush on tv     with them all
for a collective action 
this will not stand 
this will not stand 
this aggression
against kuwait 
here on the range i belong
drifting along
with the tumbling
tumbleweeds
 yelling 
 dude exclaiming 
 spluttering 
 gasps 
where s the money 
lebowski 
i want that money

all around my door

to find the man in me
but  oh

just to know that you are near
sets my heart a reeling
from my toes
up to my ears
the man in me will
hide sometimes
to keep from being seen
but that s just because
he doesn t want
to turn into some machine
take a woman like you
to get through
to the man in me

just papers 
you know  my papers 
business papers 
and what do you do  sir 
i m unemployed 
 phone ringing 
my rug was also stolen 
your rug was in the car 
no  here 
separate incidents 
 answering machine clicks 
dude on machine 
the dude is not in 
do you find them much 
these stolen cars 
sometimes 
wouldn t hold out much hope
for the tape deck though 
or the creedence 
 answering machine beeps 
what about the briefcase 
woman  mr  lebowski 
i d like to see you 
call when you get home
and i ll send a car for you 
my name is maude lebowski 
i m the one who took your rug 
well  guess we can
close the file
on that one 
 door closes 
 woman chanting 
 thudding 
 squeaking 
 yells 
 woman speaking
foreign language 
i ll be with you in
a moment  mr  lebowski 
 woman chanting 
 lndistinct chattering 
does the female form
make you uncomfortable 
mr  lebowski 
is that what this
is a picture of 
in a sense  yes 
my art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal 
which bothers some men 
the word itself makes
some men uncomfortable 
vagina 
oh  yeah 
yes  they don t like
hearing it and find it
difficult to say 
whereas without
batting an eye 
a man will refer to his dick 
or his rod or his johnson 
 johnson  
all right  mr  lebowski 
let s get down to cases 
my father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug 
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother 
it was not his to give 
now  your face 
as for this kidnapping 
huh 
yes  i know all about it 
and i know that you acted
as courier 
let me tell you something 
the whole thing stinks to
high heaven 
yeah  right  but let me
explain something about
the rug 
do you like sex 
mr  lebowski 
excuse me 
sex  the physical act
of love  coitus 
do you like it 
i was talking
about my rug 
you re not interested in sex 
you mean coitus 
i like it  too 
it s a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex 
it can be a natural 
zesty enterprise 
however  there are
some people 
it is called
satyriasis in men 
nymphomania in women 
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy 
oh  no 
oh  yes  mr  lebowski 
these unfortunate souls
cannot love  in the true
sense of the word 
our mutual acquaintance 
bunny  is one of these 
listen  maude 
i m sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho 
but  you know  i don t see
what this has to do with   
you have any kahlua 
take a look at this  sir 
dude  oh  i know that guy 
he s a nihilist 
 karl hungus  
 lce cubes clinking 
hi 
hello 
mein dispatcher says
there is something
wrong with dein kabel 
yeah  come on in 
i m not really sure
exactly what s really
wrong with the cable 
that s why they sent me 
i am an expert 
the tv s in here 
you recognize her 
of course 
helga  bring my tools 
that s my friend sherry 
she just came over
to use the shower 
the story is ludicrous

lord  you can imagine
where it goes from here 
he fixes the cable 
don t be fatuous  jeffrey 
little matter to me that
this woman chose to pursue
a career in pornography 
nor that she has been
banging jackie treehorn 
to use the parlance
of our times 
however 
i am one of the two trustees
of the lebowski foundation 
the other being my father 
the foundation takes
youngsters from watts and   
shit  yeah  the achievers 
little lebowski urban
achievers  yes  and proud
we are of all of them 
i asked my father about
his withdrawal of  1 million
from the foundation account 
and he told me
about this abduction 
but i tell you
it is preposterous 
this compulsive fornicator
is taking my father for
the proverbial ride 
yeah  but my   
i m getting to your rug 
my father and l
don t get along 
he doesn t approve
of my lifestyle and 
needless to say 
i don t approve of his 
however  i hardly
wish to make my father s
embezzlement a police matter 
so i m proposing that you
try to recover the money
from the people
you delivered it to 
well  i could do that 
if you successfully do so 
i will compensate you
to the tune of 10  of
the recovered sum 
a hundred   
thousand  yes 
bones or clams or
whatever you call them 
yeah  but what about my   
your rug  yes 
well  with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs
that don t have sentimental
value for me 
and i am sorry about
that crack on the jaw 
oh  that s fine 
that doesn t even   
here s the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you 
you will receive no bill 
he s a good man
and thorough 
 stutters 
that s thoughtful but   
please see him  jeffrey 
he s a good man and thorough 
oh  well  all right 
so he says   my wife s
a pain in the ass 
 she s always busting
my frigging agates 
 my daughter s married
to a loser bastard

come to light and   
you know  has it ever
occurred to you
that instead of  you know 
running around  blaming me

of all this new shit 
you know  this could be
a lot more complex

what in god s holy name

well  i ll tell you what
i m blathering about 
i ve got information  man 
new shit has come to light

all over town  including
to known pornographers

that s cool 
i m saying she
needs money  man 
and  you know 
of course they re gonna

occurred to us  dude 
well  okay  you know 
you guys aren t privy
to all the new shit 
so  you know   
but  hey  that s what you

 chuckles 
speaking of which 
do you think that you could
give me my  20 000 in cash 
my concern is  and
i ve gotta check it
with my accountant 
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax   
brandt  give him
the envelope 
oh  well  if you ve
already got the check
made out  that s cool 
brandt  we received this
this morning 
since you have
failed to achieve 
even in the modest task
which was your charge 
since you have
stolen my money 
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust 
i have no choice
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary
to recover their money
from you  jeffrey lebowski 
and with brandt as my witness 
i will tell you this 
any further harm
visited upon bunny
will be visited tenfold
upon your head
