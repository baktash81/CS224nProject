which bears the official papal seal
must be destroyed immediately
following the popes death
the papal apartment is then sealed
for nine days of mourning
a period known as sede vacante
the time of the empty throne
over the last several days
catholic leaders from every corner
of the world
have flocked to rome
shocked by the sudden death
of this progressive
and beloved pope
today in st peters square
the faithful pray
that there is among them
another leader
who can unite their church
which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years
as the body of the pontiff
passes by
we see prayers are being offered
by the preferiti
favourites among those
being considered
to succeed him
as the vicar of christ
at the end of the mourning period
the college of cardinals
will lock itself behind the doors
of the sistine chapel for conclave
the process by which they
will choose a new leader
for the worlds
one billion catholics
who now find their church
at a crossroads
its ancient traditions threatened
by a modern world

i beg your pardon
you got bags under your eyes
its 5 in the morning
and youre from the vatican
crossed keys
under the triregnum
its a papal symbol
claudio vincenzi
corpo della
gendarmeria vaticano
vatican police
i was expecting another letter
my request for access
to your archives
shouldnt you be in rome
a kind of busy time for you guys
isnt it
in fact i was in new york
detailed to the un
i receive a phone call
in the middle of the night
find professor robert langdon
a matter of great urgency
they said to show you this
vincenzi
the illuminati they disappeared
hundreds of years ago
langdon
did they look at that again
its an ambigram
its the same image
forward and backward
now thats common for a symbol
like a yin and yang or a swastika
but thats a word
that illuminati
ambigramatic symbol
has been considered
a myth for 400 years
supposedly
in the 16th century
some artist created it
as a tribute to
galileos love of symmetry
it was only gonna
be revealed
when the illuminati
had amassed enough power
to resurface and carry out
their final goal
i wrote a book about it
which is why youre here
the art of the illuminati
by robert langdon
part one
havent been able
to finish part two because
im not allowed access
to your archives
its remarkable singular
someone is trying
to make you believe
the illuminati themselves
have returned to rome
right after the death of a pope
four cardinals were
kidnapped from their quarters
inside the vatican
sometime between
3 and 5 am this morning
shortly afterward
that document
was sent to the office
of the swiss guard
along with the threat
the cardinals will be
publicly executed
one per hour
beginning at 8 pm
tonight in rome
conclave
was to begin today
weve postponed
its start for a few hours
a story of illness
there are no suspicions yet
what do you want from me
these criminals
who sent this ambigram
meant it as a taunt
a provocation
but captain olivetti think
if you can use it
to learn their identity
perhaps we can stop
this abomination
why me
your expertise your erudition
your recent involvement
with certain church
shall we say
mysteries
i wasnt under the impression
that episode
had endeared me
to the vatican
oh it didnt
but it did make you
whats the word
formidabile
formidable
a vatican jet is standing by
20 minutes from here
will you come with me
professore langdon
youve spent your life
searching for symbols
like the one you now
hold in your hand
how much longer are we
going to pretend
you have not already
decided to come
helicopter blades whirring
vincenzi
if the illuminati have returned
and are in rome
we will hunt them down
and kill them
the illuminati
did not become violent
until the 17th century
their name means
the enlightened ones
they were physicists
and mathematicians
astronomers
they were concerned with
the churchs inaccurate teaching
and they were dedicated
to scientific truth
but the vatican
didnt like that
so the church began to
how did you say it
oh  hunt them down
and kill them
drove them underground
into a secret society
professor langdon
langdon yes
welcome to
vatican city
ernesto olivetti
inspector general
of the vatican police force
my pleasure
this way please
well meet in the headquarters
of the swiss guard
i thought you were
swiss guard
no la gendarmeria
we are responsible for everything
inside the vatican walls
with the exception
of the security of his holiness
yeah
and the apostolic palace
that is swiss guard
the roman carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity
so jurisdictionally
this is
a goddamn nightmare
langdon
oh yes pope pius ixs
great castration
olivetti i beg your pardon
langdon 1857 pope pius ix
felt the male form
would inspire lust
so he took
a hammer and chisel
and unmanned hundreds
of these statues
the plaster fig leaves
were added later
are you anticatholic
professor langdon
no im antivandalism
i urge you to
guard your tone here
the swiss guard is a calling
not a profession
and it encourages
a certain zealotry
commander richter
the head of the guard
is a deeply spiritual man
and he was close
to the late pope
understood
look i dont study symbols
because i consider them
unimportant
ceremony traditions
its how we mark our lives
i just i just hope i can help
so do i
you were my idea
speaking indistinctly
wait here please
commander
commander richter
professor langdon is here
well we have
bigger problems
than that now
dr vetra
im commander richter
comandante principale
of the swiss guard
thank you for coming
hello
professor langdon
yes
what a relief
the symbologist is here
this way
please miss vetra
the situation
has changed
we received another threat
from the kidnapper
vittoria
the canister was stolen from our lab
around noon yesterday
the intruder killed
my research partner
silvano bentivoglio
and mutilated him
in order to bypass security
we use
retinal scanners
they cut out his eye
richter
is that your stolen canister
miss vetra
where is that camera
number 86
its wireless
it too was stolen
it could be anywhere
inside the vatican walls
that canister
contains an extremely
combustible substance
called antimatter
we need to locate it
immediately or
evacuate vatican city
im quite familiar
with incendiaries miss vetra
ive never heard of antimatter
being used as such
well its never been generated
in significant quantities before
its a way of
studying the origins
of the universe
to try to isolate
what some people call
the god particle
but there are implications
for energy research
the god particle
what we call it isnt important
its what gives
all matter mass
the thing without which
we could not exist
youre talking about
the moment of creation
yes in a way i am
the antimatter is suspended there
in an airtight nanocomposite shell
with electromagnets in each end
but if it were to fall out of suspension
and come in contact with matter
say the bottom of the canister
the two opposing forces
would annihilate one another
violently
and what might cause it
to fall out of suspension
the battery going dead
which it will
just before midnight
what kind of annihilation
how violent
a cataclysmic event
a blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons
vatican city
will be consumed by light
those are the exact words
the kidnapper used
man on video
we will destroy your four pillars
we will brand your preferiti
and sacrifice them
on the altars of science
then bring your church down
upon you
vatican city
will be consumed by light
a shining star at the end
of the path of illumination
its the ancient
illuminati threat
destruction of vatican city
through light
four pillars
theres your kidnapped cardinals
you didnt tell me they
were the preferiti the favourites
to be named the next pope
play it again
man
we will destroy your four pillars
we will brand your preferiti
wait stop it stop it
brand them
thats another illuminati legend
this one says that
there are a set of five brands
each one an ambigram
the first four are the fundamental
elements of science
earth air fire and water
the fifth its a mystery
maybe its this
he said theyd be killed publicly
langdon
yes
revenge for la purga
la purga
oh jeez you guys
dont even read
your own history do you
1668 the church kidnapped
four illuminati scientists
and branded
each one of them
on the chest
with the symbol
of the cross
to purge them of their sins
and they executed them
threw their bodies
out into the street
as a warning
to others to stop questioning
church rulings on scientific matters
they radicalized them
the purga created a darker
more violent illuminati
one bent on retribution
look how they intend
to finally get it
using antimatter technology
to destroy the church
science obliterates religion
is there any more
clicks
man
and sacrifice them
on the altars of science
then bring your church down
upon you
vatican city will be consumed
by light
a shining star at the end
of the path of illumination
path of illumination
i need access
to the vatican archives
professor i dont think
this is the appropriate moment
your petition has been denied
seven times
no no this has nothing to do with
my work the path of illumination
is a hidden trail
through rome itself that leads
to the church of the illumination
the place where the illuminati
would meet in secret
if i can find the segno the sign
that marks the beginning of that
path the four churches along it
may be where he intends
to murder your cardinals
one every hour at 8 9 10 and 11
then the device
explodes at midnight
if we can figure out the first church
and get there before he does
maybe we can stop it
but i cant find the start of the path
until i get into the archives
even if i wanted to help you
access to the archives
is only by written decree
by the curator
and the board of vatican librarians
or by papal mandate
yes but as you no doubt have heard
the holy father is dead
what about il camerlengo
the camerlengo is just a priest here
the former popes chamberlain
doesnt the power of
the holy see rest in him
during tempe sede vacante
fellas you called me
man
his holiness once told me a pope
was a man torn between
the real world and the divine
it seems the real world
is upon us tonight
im familiar with illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings
la purga is a dark stain
on this churchs history
im not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us
comandante have you begun
the search for this explosive device
of course but it could
be anywhere
my primary concern
at the moment is
the safety of the cardinals
the sistine chapel
is a fortress
as long as the cardinals
are in conclave
your security concerns
are at a minimum
devote as many
of your resources
if youre about to suggest
a nakedeye search
of the entire vatican city
i will tell you we do not
have the people
commander
though i am not his holiness
when you are addressing me
you are addressing this office
do you understand
yes father
camerlengo
good
you said the image on
the screen was illuminated
by artificial light
might i suggest
methodically cutting power
to various sections of the city
when the image
on the screen goes dark
youll have a more specific idea
of the cameras location
dr vetra besides yourself
and your research partner
who else knew
about this antimatter project
no one but the research team
this project was strictly confidential
but silvano kept detailed journals
if he told anyone else
about what
we were doing he would
have made a note of it
do you have these journals
i can have them flown here
from geneva in an hour
please
professor langdon
mr langdon you are correct
that i may grant you
access to the archives
thank you padre
i said that you were correct
that i may not that i will
christianitys most sacred codices
are in that archive
given your recent
entanglement with the church
there is a question id like
to ask you first here
in the office of his holiness
do you believe in god sir
father i simply believe
that religion
i did not ask if you believe
what man says about god
i asked if you believe in god
im an academic
my mind tells me i will never
understand god
and your heart
tells me im not meant to
faith is a gift
that i have yet to receive
be delicate with our treasures
man speaking in italian
the archives are this way
vittoria
professor langdon
if this path really leads
to the church of illumination
that may be where theyve
hidden the antimatter
a shining star
at the end of the path
i thought so too
follow the path
and we may find the canister
at the end of it
can you deactivate the device
i can change the canisters batteries
as long as we have
more than five minutes
of life
that would give us another 24 hours
to get it safely back to cern
robert langdon
vittoria vetra
are you really a symbologist
or was he mocking you
well both youre a physicist
bioentanglement physics
interconnectivity of life systems
okay
your project it was geared
towards energy research
eventually yes
one speck of antimatter
could power an entire city
for a month
or tonight i guess
destroy one
what are we looking for
in the archives
a bound volume written by galileo
galileo was illuminati
yeah and an obedient
catholic who didnt think
the church and science
were enemies
but just a different language
telling the same story
and he wanted like minds
to find the church of illumination
but he couldnt exactly
advertise its location
so he created a coded path
richter has started to turn off
the power of various grids
itll be back on in a minute
langdon
then some unknown illuminati
master sculpted four statues
each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements
earth air fire water
and placed the statues
out in public in churches
throughout rome
each statue held a clue
pointing to the next
at the end of the path
was the church of illumination
if you could find that
you were one of them
olivetti what makes you
think hes going to murder
the cardinals in the churches
langdon
the illuminati called
those four churches
by the special name
l altare della scienza
sacrifice them on the altars
of science he said
exactly
oh wow look at this
beeping
camerlengo
excuse me signore
cardinal strauss youve been
informed of the situation
strauss
yeah
my belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave
at this late hour
that would be
highly unorthodox
and yet within church law
its in my power
i am great elector
the cruellest honour
in christendom
strauss
i have no personal ambitions
patrick
only those i hold for my church
st peters church
which is under attack
at its most vulnerable moment
and this is not a coincidence
the church will not fall in a day
we must evacuate vatican city
oh that is exactly
what they want
publicity and panic
no we must not give them
oxygen for the media fire
but the people
in st peters square
care deeply about their church
as we do
their faith will sustain them
their faith will not protect them
from an explosion
well
we are all bound for heaven
eventually are we not
spoken like one who has enjoyed
the blessings of a long and full life
patrick
do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold
with your true place
here in the vatican
you were a favourite
of his holiness
but his holiness
is with his father now
mea culpa
seal the doors
camerlengo
extra omnes
hello this way please
langdon
oh beautiful
chartrand
the chambers are hermetic vaults
oxygen is kept
at lowest possible levels
its a partial vacuum inside
so extended stays
are not recommended
langdon
so dont panic if you feel
lightheaded at first
ill be just
outside the door
watching you mr langdon
conclave will go on without us
it must now of all times
may god forgive you
for what youve done
father if god has issues
they wont be
with what ive done
they will be
with what im about to do
langdon
it was confiscated
from the netherlands
by the vatican
just after galileo died
ive been petitioning to see it
for about 10 years
ever since i realised
what was in it
what makes you so sure
the segnos there
the number 503
i kept seeing it over and over again
in illuminati letters
scribbled in the margins
sometimes just signed 503
its a numeric clue but to what
five well thats a meaningful
number to the illuminati
theres the pentagram pythagoras
dozens of other examples in science
but what about three
didnt make sense until i thought
what if its roman numerals
diii
dthree galileos third text
dialogo discorso diagramma
oh
yeah
just a few days with this
and i could have
actually finished my book
and sold dozens of copies
at the harvard bookstore
il diagramma veritatis
diagram of truth
i know about
dialogo and discorsi
galileo laid out his theories
about the earth revolving
around the sun
yeah and said the earth
was not the centre
of some universe
with heaven above hell below
as the church had said it was
so they forced him to
recant in the second book
but what was this one
this is how he got the word out
this is the truth
not what the vatican
forced him to write
smuggled out of rome
printed in holland on
sedge papyrus see
that way any scientist that
was caught with a copy
could just throw it in water
and galileos heresy
would dissolve disappear
and between that
and vatican burnings
its possible that
this is the only copy that remains
and if im correct
the segno is hidden
on page number
five
yeah
do you need help
with the latin
sure
movement of the planets
elliptical orbits heliocentricity
sorry i dont think
theres anything that could
be interpreted as a
wait wait wait
do that again
what is that
wait a minute its a watermark
and theres a line of text
go back
its in english
english why english
english wasnt used in the vatican
it was too polluted
it was freethinking
it was a language of radicals
like shakespeare and chaucer
heres another one
the path of light
is laid the sacred test
will you write this down as i dictate
sorry professor no time
yeah yeah what the hell yeah
olivetti
twenty minutes till 8
where are we headed
hold on hold on
ill tell you in a minute
let me see that page again
where did you get that paper
we borrowed it
from santis earthly tomb
with demons hole
are you insane
cross rome the mystic elements
unfold
speaks in italian
the path of light is laid
the sacred test
let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest
you removed a document
from the vatican archives
she did
from santis earthly tomb
the first marker is at santis tomb
yeah
but whos santi
raphael
il raffaello the sculptor
yeah santi was his last name
so the path starts
at raphaels tomb
raphaels buried at the pantheon
isnt the pantheon a church
oldest catholic church in rome
i just pulled a dozen of
our best men for this
you better be right
this is one of
the busiest spots
in all of rome
hed never get away
with it its impossible
the poem implies
the poem unbelievable
im basing this operation
on an americans interpretation
of a 400yearold poem
the information we have
clearly refers to raphaels tomb
and raphaels tomb
is inside that building
and because the vatican
destroyed all of the pagan
statues in the late1800s
if this is the first marker
whatever clues were here to lead us
to the next church are gone now
the path is dead so this is it
your only chance
separate approaches
no closer than two blocks
and no uniforms three minutes
and i need a set of eyes inside
excuse me
two weightlifters in matching
black suits and earpieces
theyre hardly disguised
well its what i have
well fine ill go in
you dont have communication
you cant carry a walkietalkie
its too conspicuous
tourists have cell phones dont they
no no
you cant send her
in there alone
all right i wont
people chattering
in foreign languages
dont look so anxious
were supposed
to be married
well maybe were not
getting along today hm
hold my hand
but dont crush it
sorry a nervous newlywed
oh look look honey the oculus
that could be
the demons hole in the poem
vittoria
why are the tombs at an angle
langdon
theyre facing east
to worship the rising sun
vittoria
but this is a christian church
new religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays
to make conversion
less of a shock
like the 25th of december
its the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun
and also makes a handy date
for the birth of christ
lets check the recesses
okay
ill go to the right
ill meet you at 180 degrees
docent
follow me please
now the pantheon which means
temple of all gods
was originally built as a temple
to all the gods of ancient rome
in 27 bc
although the design of the building
is usually credited
to apollodorus of damascus
vittoria
robert
robert
its raphaels tomb
but its the wrong one
what are you talking about
he was moved here
in 1759 a century after
diagramma was published
where was he
originally buried
langdon
uh urbino i think
santis earthly tomb
what could it possibly be
santis earthly tomb
damn it santis tomb
it must mean a chapel
that he built
hes not buried in it
he designed it
the demons hole
its not that oculus
its an undercroft its a crypt
docent are there any questions
langdon yes
yes
did raphael santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex
and an angel figure commissioned
by the catholic church
im sorry i can only think of one
one is good
richter
wrong what do you mean wrong
its the chigi chapel
in the church of
the santa maria del popolo
it was once called the capella della
terra the chapel of the earth
earth the first element
thats it
you were certain about the pantheon
we have four minutes
speaks in german
vittoria
back to the vatican you cant
comandante if you care
at all about your church
youll listen to me
my church
my church comforts
the sick and dying
my church feeds
the hungry
what does
your church do
mr langdon
thats right
you dont have one
take him if you want
im done with him
all right this makes sense
look look look
right in front of the church
an obelisk a lofty pyramid
egyptian symbol
adopted by the illuminati
if hes going to kill him
hell do it here
bells tolling
eight oclock
olivetti speaks in italian
vittoria
robert
speaking in italian
no no here its an annulus
popping
which one is the chigi chapel
its in one of these apses
clanging
bangs
gasping
wings flapping
man speaking in italian
over radio
pyramids in
a catholic church
this is it
this is the chigi chapel
rattling
door closes
the demons hole
but its askew
come here
hand me your flashlight
olivetti
whats that
yoruba in latin
i call as my witness christ the lord
who will be my judge
that my vote is given
to the one before god
i think should be elected
in latin
i elect as the most high pontiff
dominic scolamiero
whispers in italian
strauss speaking in latin
edoardo rossi
in english
they are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority
they are waiting for the preferiti
to be rescued
perhaps we should as well yes
crowd chattering
woman
not until the smoke is white
will the college of cardinals
have chosen a new holy father
for now the vatican seat
of ultimate power remains vacant
get the body out of there
and search the rest
of the building
chartrand
chartrand sir
richter
outside a perimeter
secure but invisible
no lights no guns
nobody knows
understand
yes sir
richter
im calling all offduty
no information
is it raphael
the chapel is raphael
but the sculptures
are bernini
the unknown illuminati master
bernini
he worked
for the church
almost exclusively
but the illuminati
were infiltrators
there wasnt a powerful
organisation on earth
they didnt penetrate
including the vatican
by hiding in plain sight
habakkuk and the angel
hes the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth
langdon
let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest
this is the first marker
the path is alive
southwest
it was pointing southwest
earth air fire water
were looking for
a bernini sculpture
having something
to do with air
the second church
is somewhere
southwest of here
youre sure this time
i need a map showing
all the churches of rome
i could use it now
langdon all right the purple
areas with these black crosses
represent the churches
but nothing intersects the line
until it hits
until it hits st peters
michelangelo designed st peters
not bernini
michelangelo designed the basilica
bernini designed
st peters square
the second marker must be
a statue in st peters square
its 10 minutes till 9
can you go any faster
not unless you want
the full attention
of the world press
woman 1 in italian
there was no consensus
after the first ballot
but cardinal baggia the italian
is the oddson favourite
in spanish
there is no new pope
but it is possible
that cardinal guidera
the spaniard
is the most probable
in polish
it is possible that cardinal ebner
from germany is the favourite
woman 1 in italian
stem cell research is murder
in italian
youre condemning
sick people to die
man is not god
langdon
there another obelisk
check the crowd its almost 9
hes gotta be here already
there must be 100 statues
up there
langdon
none of them are angels
those are all saints
how in gods name
would anyone create
a sculpture about air
basrelief of course
its still a sculpture
check the ground
look at the carvings
look for another having something
to do with air
west ponente west wind
vittoria
here it is
west wind an angel
blowing out five streaks of air
this is it
yelling in italian
bell tolling
whistle blowing
screaming
woman in italian
get the police
call an ambulance
hes still alive
blood splatters
his chest
they punctured his lungs
speaking in italian
richter in german
clear the square
olivetti speaking
in italian
man speaking in italian
over megaphone
camerlengo
from within your walls to squeeze
life from the bishop of rome
hes actually claiming responsibility
for the death of his holiness
thats ridiculous
he died of a stroke
it implies the illuminati
murdered him with
his own medication
what
down here
with mans solution
we stilled his heart
with his own needle
did we pierce his unholy veil
did the holy father take any kind
of medication by injection
tinzaparin
he had thrombophlebitis
he took an injection every day
but no one knew that
someone knew
well he had health concerns
and seizures as well
but he took steps to make sure
he was watched for safety
he didnt want it
made public so we have
no reason to discuss it
tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage
an overdose could cause
massive internal bleeding
and brain haemorrhages
it might look like a stroke
at first but in a few days
his body would show signs
this could easily be examined
richter
ms vetra in case
youre not aware of it
papal autopsy is prohibited
by vatican law
were not going to defile
his holinesss body
just because
his enemies claim
why would they send this letter now
camerlengo well to cause panic
the sun will blind at midnight
and neither police nor professors
can stop it
he knows im here
obviously they were hoping
this letter would become public
we might be wise to preempt
their next attempt
by making an announcement
of our own to refute
this absurd claim
simeon
thats out of the question
cardinal strauss has
insisted this entire matter
be kept internal
he shouldnt even be aware of it
hes locked in conclave
his final instructions before sealing
the doors were very clear
cardinal strauss does not dictate
vatican protocols
as you say
yet technically
now that conclave
has begun
its his privilege and duty
to control public announcements
ive drafted
a press release about
the incident in the piazza
but any other statements
are specifically prohibited
for that cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney
commander richter
the search for the device
well weve turned the power
on and off to about
20 percent of vatican city
nothing on the video yet
were running out of options
how long would you need
to evacuate everyone
if i pull all my men from the search
for the bomb 30 minutes
mr langdon you have been right
so far about the path its now 9 15
how quickly can you find
the next church
the lines of breath on
the carving pointed due east
directly away from vatican city
but there were five of them
so theres room for error
about 20 churches
intersect those lines
man speaks in italian
none of them have names
that invoke fire
so a bernini sculpture
must be inside
one of them that does
well need to get back
into the archives to find it
would you escort mr langdon
yes father
vittoria speaks
in italian
silvanos journals
the killers name could be
in here may i stay
please
fine of course
professor
would it surprise you to find
those clothes suit you
it would surprise
the hell out of me
in italian
the vatican is expressing sympathy
for the mugging victim
a düsseldorf tourist
now confirmed dead
in cantonese
the vatican police have
a suspect in custody
in french
the vatican will allow the crowd back
into st peters square
where security will be doubled
the vatican did admit
that where there are crowds
so often follows crime
were trying now to get the name
of the tourist who was
oh wait
man pan to the right keep panning
were getting word now of smoke
smoke from
the sistine chapel chimney
apparently theres been
another vote
the smoke is black
once again
the cardinals have failed
to reach consensus
and the catholic church
remains without a leader
chartrand
what are you looking for now
langdon
church assets
i beg your pardon
artwork its valuable
corporations tend to keep track
of their holdings
the catholic church
is not a corporation
its a beacon
a source of inspiration
for one billion
lost and frightened souls
sure i get that its also a bank
commander olivetti said
i was not to leave
your side this time
it wasnt me it was her
in swiss german
power is now cut to zone 73
no light reaction on the monitor
restore power and move on to 74
what sort of signs
im sorry
if the holy father was given
an overdose of tinzaparin
what signs
would his body bear
bleeding of
the oral mucosa
his tongue
postmortem the blood
congeals and turns the inside
of the mouth black
even after 14 days
it wouldnt show up
until at least a week
after his death
he was very important to me
yeah i understand
will you come with me please
speaking in italian
signore would you organise
a security team
to escort miss vetra and myself
down to the crypt
guard
yes sir
camerlengo
well be leaving straightaway
breathing heavily
do you smoke
a little bit
then you better sit down
before you keel over
and whats all that right there
what does this say
in italian right here
next to the ecstasy of saint teresa
right there
moved at suggestion
of the artist
moved to another church
at the suggestion of bernini
chartrand
i dont know
here translate all of this for me
and ill buy you
a pack of smokes
im looking for
a reference to fire
fires
seraphim meaning the fiery one
right
chartrand
his great golden spear
a point of fire
then woman left completely afire
langdon
ecstasy of saint teresa
saint teresa on fire
so this sculpture
was moved to this church
why did they shut down the system
they know were down here
chartrand
if theres no power
theres no oxygen
langdon can we get out
the door is electronic
oh god
well thats disappointing
vittoria
where are we going
to see my father
i dont
understand
camerlengo
i was orphaned when i was 9 years
of age a bombing in ulster
the uvf protesting the visit
of a catholic archbishop
the archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day
i was raised by him
and by the church
he was the wisest man i ever met
even when i was
young and stubborn
i wanted to be ordained
but i was brought up
in italy so i also wanted
to do my military service
i wanted to fight
he told me learn to fly
so i joined
the aeronautica militare
flew helicopters bringing
the wounded back to hospital
he was a great man
your father died
fourteen days ago
chartrand in swiss german
command do you read me
power is off oxygen is very low
come in can you read me
can you get anything
in english
no the walls are leadlined
theres no signal
beeping
breathing
camerlengo
this way
if the holy father was
murdered the implications
are profound
vatican security is impenetrable
no one from the outside
could have got anywhere near him
it was someone on the inside
and we can trust no one
man in swiss german
no light reaction on zone 97
based on the rate the battery
is using power
the device will detonate
just before midnight
holy father
when i was young
you told me the voice
in my heart was gods voice
you said i should follow it
no matter how painful
forgive me
please
give me strength
what i do i do in the name
of everything you believe
god help us
tyres squealing
santa maria della vittoria
do you know it
yes i do
its the next church
speaks in italian
siren wailing
i think someone
just tried to kill me
professor i promise you
we had no idea
he knows im here
yes
you heard me
ask permission
you gave me an escort
yes but we had no idea
that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building
commander richter
was extending the search
if he had known the archives
were on that grid he never
would have killed the power
or there is the other possibility
is it conceivable the illuminati
have infiltrated the swiss guard
perhaps
the journals where are they
who took the journals
from this desk
metal rattling
beck
someone is here what is this
signore this is unacceptable
for a camerlengo to enter the chapel
once conclave has begun
forgive me
theres been a development
people chattering
horn honking
in italian
his holiness celestine v
was murdered
is it so hard to believe
it could happen again
signori please a moment
please signori
our church is at war
we are under attack
from an old enemy
the illuminati
they have struck us
from within
murdering our holy father
and threatening us all
with destruction at the hands
of their new god science
they call it retribution
they think it justified
because of the churchs attacks
on men of science in the distant past
and its true
since the days of galileo
this church has tried to slow
the relentless march of progress
sometimes with misguided means
but science and religion
are not enemies
there are simply some things
that science is just too young
to understand
so the church pleads
stop slow down think wait
and for this
they call us backward
but who is more ignorant
the man
who cannot define lightning
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power
the battle is well underway signori
we must defend ourselves
but what if this time we fight
their stealth with openness
combat their wicked scheme
with simple truth
and end this brutish battle
once and for all
if the outside world could see
this church as i do
looking beyond the ritual
of these walls
they would see a modern miracle
a brotherhood of imperfect
simple souls
who want nothing more
than to be voices of compassion
in a world spinning out of control
signori i ask
i pray
that you break this conclave
open the doors
evacuate st peters square
and tell the world
the truth
siren wailing
bells tolling
olivetti yelling in italian
olivetti in italian
oh my god
get him down
no

there there that chain

make a ladder
gunshots
gunshots
doors bang
men yell in italian
gendarmeria vaticana
grunts
my son
god answers all prayers
but sometimes his answer is no
the college will not
break conclave
may i suggest
you direct your energies
to helping the swiss guard find
this explosive device
if it exists
and leave
church leadership
to its leaders
simeon
eminence
there is a growing fear
that without the four preferiti
a twothirds majority
for any candidate
will not be possible
unless
speak plainly
it is the recommendation
of many
that you ask to be removed
from your post as great elector
thereby making
yourself eligible
to wear the ring
of the fisherman
well if it is gods will
may his will be done

signore are you okay

guard speaking

those journals are
private property i demand
that you return them to me
theyre material evidence
in a vatican investigation
i am an italian citizen
my rights do not end
just because i crossed to the other
this is not italy
its not even rome
its the vatican
a country of its own
with its own laws
and when those journals
passed the border
they became my property
and i will give them
back to you
when ive decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation
do you have something to hide
comandante richter
chuckles
do you dr vetra
groans
man groaning
were it up to me
it would not be this way
its a sin to kill with pain
its a sin to kill without reason
father
they make me a sinner
langdon
saint teresa on fire
valenti
professor langdon
what direction is that
west i think
cross rome
the mystic elements unfold
piazza barberini is here
saint teresa is here
where is the santa maria
del popolo the first
altar of science
santa maria del popolo
yes
thank you
st peters is here
we are here
man speaking in italian
over radio
a church with water
wait wait wait
cross rome
the poem must mean it literally
cross rome
professor commander richter
has ordered me
to escort you to the vatican
immediately
piazza navona
earth air fire water
cross rome
berninis four rivers
valenti professor langdon
the vatican insists that i have
to take you back immediately
the vatican is about to see
its fourth cardinal murdered tonight
now look you can do as they say
and force me back to the vatican
where we can all mourn
his death together
or you can show how real cops act
and take me to the piazza navona
where we still might be able
to stop it
oh by all means
lets talk it over
in 14 minutes
hes gonna be dead
this way professor
yes padre
at 11 15
if the church is still in peril
give the order
to evacuate the cardinals
but with dignity
let them walk out
into st peters square
with their heads held high
i dont want the last image
of this church to be
of frightened old men
sneaking out
the back door
let angels guide thee
there it is
there it is
professor i know this fountain
there is no angel on it
the dove the angel of peace
and its looking in what direction
east i think
speaking in italian
professor just wait here
stay put
in italian
good evening can you help me
im waiting for a doctor
silenced gunshots
come here

stay calm dont shoot
silenced gunshot
bell tolling
hey

woman yells in italian
cardinal baggia
cardinal baggia
where was he hiding you
the church of illumination
where is it
castel castel santangelo
castle of the angel
chartrand
sir theres news
about cardinal baggia
the cardinal told langdon he was
being held in castel santangelo
if langdons right
thats where the bomb is
send everyone
we can spare
and you
im staying here
vittoria
youre all right
im all right
what about you
i just heard about
olivetti on the radio
im all right im okay
speaking in italian
robert we cant trust richter
he took silvanos journals
there must be
something in there
he doesnt want us to see
the head of the swiss guard
castel santangelo its close
enough so the wireless signal
from that camera
could still reach the vatican
the church of illumination
is somewhere here
your canister is inside it
men speaking in italian
come with me
langdon
for 400 years the illuminati
met right under the churchs nose
the vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies
if the explosion happens here would
the blast radius take out the vatican
and part of rome along with it
go on
theyre pointing to it the angels
the canister must be down there
come on
men speaking in italian
where are they going
back to search the outer castle
no no it has to be here
robert its a dead end
no its not
see if you can find a flashlight
all of these stones
are rectangular granite
except right here what is this
its a pentagram
an eye
that leads to
langdon
nowhere
robert
these walls overlap
and theres a passageway
back here
here let me have
the flashlight
coughing
its a passageway
that leads to the vatican
an ancient escape route
my god
here
look
langdon
this would be the perfect place
for the illuminati to blow
the whole building up
here here
get on the radio get the word out
conclave remains sealed
but the camerlengo gave the order
for evacuation at
im countermanding it
langdon
this is it this is their church
vittoria
the canister should be lit
by artificial light
its not here robert
a shining star
at the end of the path
it has to be
vittoria
its not here
what did the poem say
langdon nothing
nothing its all over it was just the
four lines each one describing the
theres a fifth brand
its not an ambigram
its just two crossed keys
vittoria
the symbol for the vatican
no
no the papacy
they intend to kill him
before they destroy
the vatican
theyre gonna kill
and brand the pope himself
there is no pope
tempe sede vacante
il camerlengo
we have to warn him
take a step back please
take your cell phone
from your pocket
throw it in the fire
murderer
you know when they call me
and they all call me
it is so important to them
that i know
that what they ask
is the lords will
or allahs or yahwehs
and i suppose theyre right
because if he was not vengeful
i would not exist now would i
ive had several chances
to eliminate you tonight
youre still alive
because you have no weapon
and they didnt ask me to kill you
but if you pursue me
it is another matter
be careful
these are men of god
the camerlengo
have you come
to make me a martyr
here here here
people screaming
i need to see the camerlengo
he is not available
i demand to see the camerlengo
he is not available
well see about that
langdon
all locked up senza chiave
its a oneway portal
the only entrance
is on the other side
no hey
in swiss german
i dont care who he talks to
he doesnt go into that room
banging
langdon  vittoria yelling
langdon
this is robert langdon and
dr vetra open the door
open up

hey
the camerlengo

camerlengo yells
hes the one hes got a gun

camerlengo groaning
order the evacuation
we only have 19 minutes
here hes
get the helicopter
for the older cardinals
yes sir
vittoria
robert
the brand the symbol
could it have another meaning
crossed keys
but those are upside down
st peter
the first pope
was crucified upside down
on vatican hill
a few hundred feet below us
necropolis city of the dead
upon this rock
i will build my church
langdon
or bring it down upon itself
the bomb is in st peters tomb
speaking in italian
chartrand
the grid is still cycling
the power to this section
must be down
beeping
it must be here it must be
dont touch it
we have seven minutes
robert hold this
its cold down here isnt it
whats wrong
vittoria
cold decreases battery life
we may have
less than five minutes
so
if i pull the power
with less than five minutes
the residual charge
wont hold suspension
we should leave it here
and get clear if we can
at least down here the damage
no
vittoria no wait
langdon father
woman
we are live here
at st peters square
where despite a bomb threat
and an order of evacuation
the crowd is actually growing
in size as we await an official
announcement
from the vatican spokesman
as to the exact nature
of the threat
and whether or not they
are treating it as a credible danger
this way
speaks in italian
a bomb
camerlengo
roberto theres an emergency
ill take her up alone
man
hes got clearance
oh my god

crowd murmuring
people screaming
langdon
get down

crowd applauding
cardinal strauss
in swiss german
it was the camerlengo
he saved us all
he saved the church
and he is alive
praise god praise god
he is alive
he sacrificed himself for all of us
its so incredible he survived
you know the worst thing
we thought would happen
was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies
we thought
we could change the world
so naive
no no not naive
innocent maybe
but thats not a crime
im not so sure
go back to work
change the world
people singing
in italian
colbert speaking
in french
colbert
a gift do you understand
what im saying
for catholics for everyone
beck
camerlengos age
shouldnt be an obstacle
signori you are no doubt aware
that by holy law the man is ineligible
for election to the papacy
he is not a cardinal he is a priest
he is of insufficient age
well maybe theres a way
we could consider the possibilities
i am sorry the protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification
i will not call a ballot on this matter
but signore
you would not call the ballot
surely you remember
you gave up your post
as great elector
beck
they are singing
in st peters square
and what happened here tonight
transcends our laws
does it
is it gods will that
we give ourselves over to frenzy
discard the rules of the church
perhaps we need not
discard them
signore i am thinking now
of romano pontifici eligendo
numero sessanta
acclamation by adoration
speaks in italian
beck
if the holy spirit speaks
through us
and we call a mans name
out loud
that is election by adoration
hes gods choice
pugini yes
and the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy
present in the sistine chapel
at the moment of his election
i think we have it settled
men chattering
in foreign languages
signore camerlengo
yes
guard
the cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible
me
guard
yes padre
what are you doing
silvanos journals
i want them back
richter said
his holiness suffered
from seizures
but steps were taken
for safety
made sure he was watched
he said
what if he was trying
to give me this key
thats the papal office
if the pope was worried
about seizures
he must have had richter
install cameras without
telling anyone
to keep an eye on him for safety
maybe it records
richter
i read the journals patrick
camerlengo
the scientist kept journals so
richter
well you figure prominently
in them
camerlengo
really
richter
bentivoglio wasnt just a physicist
he was also a catholic priest
and as such he was
deeply conflicted about
the implications of his work
and in need of
spiritual guidance
like galileo
about a month ago he requested
an audience with the pope
but you know that
because you granted
the audience and you were
also present during it
the god particle
to actually claim
an act of creation
the blasphemy the arrogance
the holy father didnt see it
like that
he urged him to go public
his holiness
thought that the discovery
could actually scientifically
prove the existence
of a divine power
and begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion
his work was not religious
it was sacrilegious
but you you saw
the popes position as
a softening of church law
as an old mans weakness
your fathers weakness
you murdered the vicar of christ
he raised me
to protect this church
even from within
and then you conjured up
an old enemy from the past
the illuminati
you found the ancient
brands in the papal vaults
and put them to use
to spread fear
the cardinals
are men of belief
right now their belief in evil
is uniting them
the entire catholic world
will be united by this attack
there is no attack
youre trying to
convince the cardinals
theyre in a war
so they will choose a warrior
to lead them
we are at war
were weak
when we should be strong
if science is allowed
to claim the power of creation
what is left for god
it didnt work patrick
it isnt finished
oh yes its finished
its finished
ive shown the journals
to father simeon
the moment the doors
to the conclave open
he will tell the cardinals
what youve done
i was planning
on doing this alone
put it down
but perhaps its better
that youre here
put it down
put it away
yells
banging
help hes the one hes got a gun
illuminatus
simeon you bastard
illuminatus
sanctimonious bastard
gunshots
camerlengo on video
and get the helicopter
for the older cardinals right
vittoria
robert
the brand the symbol
could it have another meaning
ive been summoned by
the college of cardinals
gently
but within our walls
speaks in swiss german
doors open
father into thy hands
i commend my spirit
screaming
crowd cheering
woman
church sources now confirm
that camerlengo
father patrick mckenna
has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall
in spanish
crowds of the faithful are calling for
the camerlengos immediate
canonization and sainthood
the vatican also announced
the death of three of its cardinals
in the fire
at santa maria della vittoria
man
as we await the appearance
of the new holy father
cardinal baggia of italy
one of the four original preferiti
who despite terrorist attempts
at disruption
seems to have been selected
in one of the swiftest
and smoothest conclaves
in modern church history
professor langdon please
a token of thanks
from his holiness
and from
his new camerlengo
we are grateful
you saved his life
and its our understanding
that you require this text
to complete your scholarly work
we ask only that
in your last will and testament
you ensure
it finds its way home
of course
strauss
and when you write of us
and you will write of us
may i ask one thing
do so gently
ill try
religion is flawed
but only
because man is flawed
all men
including this one
he chose the name luke
theres been
many marks
and johns
never a luke
strauss
its said he was a doctor
its quite a message
science and faith all in one
the world is
in need of both
you will
counsel him wisely
i am an old man
i will counsel him briefly
mr langdon
thanks be to god
for sending someone
to protect his church
i dont believe he sent me father
oh my son
