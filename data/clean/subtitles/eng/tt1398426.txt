any idea how many records were selling
ruthless has arrived eric
were fucking huge
that is dope jerry
thats dope
the combined law enforcement
associations of texas today
called for a halt to sales of the album
i believe that the rap music
promotes violence against authority
and consequently
violence against law enforcement
fifteen on that
fuck man
hey come on put that shit up
excuse me gentlemen im sorry
i dont mean to be the bearer
of bad news but  what you got
oh shit
whats that
motherfuckin fbi
what the fuck
im supposed to not care about this
wait the fbi they comin after us too
kind of
i mean
what the letter say jerry
uh basically uh
a song recorded
by the rap group nwa
on their album
straight out of compton
encourages violence
against law enforcement
advocating violence
and assault is wrong
and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action
fuck that
fuck that
fuck the law enforcement community
we got freedom of speech
what the fuck can they do to us
you wanna provoke em and find out
because this is a warning cube
and its about fuck tha police
in particular so
i think uh maybe we should
not play that song right now
not play what fuck that jerry
thats what the song is about
relax relax were not giving in to anything
i just say we retire it for now
okay
it is a reasonably worded threat
this isnt uh street bullshit
this isnt the crips and bloods and crap
this is the federal government
these guys can come after us
a million different ways
i dont even want to think about it
why provoke them
the fuck does that mean
if it was the lapd maybe id be a little worried
but we cant let them censor us jerry
im not advocating for censorship cube
maybe none of us should be worried
maybe we should be happy
what you mean e
cause this right here is a gift
its the fbi e what you talking about
this
is free publicity for nwa
we take this to the press
and we show them
what type of intimidation
discrimination and harassment
that we dealing with from our government
i like that shit
im with that
my nigga i feel you
if thats what you wanna do then we can
thats what i wanna do

how do you explain inciting a riot in detroit
what do you have to say about that
i have to say that uh
we didnt incite that shit
right yall just got a snapshot
of how americans really feel
we gave the people a voice
we gave the people truth
yeah but your songs they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs guns drugs
our art is a reflection of our reality
what you see
when you go outside your door
i know what i see
and it aint glamorous
we get aks from russia
and cocaine from colombia
and aint none of us got a passport so
yeah
might wanna check the source
next question
will you be more careful about
what you say how you say it
no
probably not no
freedom of speech
includes rap music right
well we exercising our first amendment
as far as im concerned
and the government wrote that
so cube whats a guy from compton do
when he starts making real money like this
cube
buy raider gear
and curl activator
next question
good to see you cube
i can barely see you jerry
whats with all the godfather shit
okay
i know that youve been very eager
to sign a contract with erics company
ruthless records
erics company
aint it your company too
thats incorrect
its not my company i work for you
you work for me
uhhuh
ive made that clear from the beginning
all right cool so i could take this
to a lawyer or somebody right
cube those guys are paid to make trouble
theyre gonna create problems
where no problems exist
jerry you know i dont know what
none of this legal shit mean all right
none of us do were gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything
everybody else has already signed
i thought you knew this
youre the only one who hasnt
theres also this
shit
sign the contract
and all this money is yours
thats my money anyway jerry
i earned that money
now i wrote a lot of hit songs
mmhmm
weve been performing on this tour for
months sellin out shows sellin records
i know its plenty of money
really
jesus christ
give me my money jerry
how the hell do you think this works
how the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for
the hotel rooms the tour buses
security the parties all this shit
how do you think it gets paid for you think its free
why are you doing this now
if we were so good why didnt you give us
contracts in the beginning
because nothing is a sure thing cube
even a great talent can crash and burn
too much ego too much excess
too many expectations
it tends to ruin things
you ought to keep that in mind
this erics company right

the jury in the rodney king case
has delivered its verdict
and not one of the four police officers
seen on videotape
beating mr king a year ago
is guilty of using excessive force
theyve all been found not guilty
oh for christs sake
oh my god
judy the details
peter it was a clean sweep
for the defendants
not guilty the verdict for all of them
only on one count against lawrence powell
im sorry
on excessive use of force
under color of authority
could the jury not agree
its probably the worst case
of police misconduct that ive ever seen
fuck the police
fuck the police
it was devastating to the image
of this city and our police department
it looks kind of like
were in a warzone though
weve got some
courageous shop owners here who are armed
anarchy is obviously a statement
of political dissatisfaction
police officers are still back down
guarding the area down there
where the ralphs
the police are
using eerily reminiscent
of militarystyle assault weapons
the cars have been left
abandoned because their drivers came under attack
the fire that
we showed you and that police presence
we have fires burning
olympic pico
more than 100 injured
mostly in the southcentral
section of los angeles
no justice no peace
hiphop
