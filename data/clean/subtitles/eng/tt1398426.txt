that is dope  jerry 
that s dope 
the combined law enforcement
associations of texas today
called for a halt to sales of the album 
i believe that the rap music
promotes violence against authority
and  consequently 
violence against law enforcement 
fifteen on that 
  fuck  man 
  hey  come on  put that shit up 
excuse me  gentlemen  i m sorry 
  i don t mean to be the bearer
of bad news  but      what you got

motherfuckin  fbi 
what the fuck 
i m supposed to not care about this 
  wait  the fbi  they comin  after us too 
  kind of 
i mean 
what the letter say  jerry 
uh  basically  uh   
 a song recorded
by the rap group n w a   
on their album
straight out of compton   
encourages violence
against law enforcement 
advocating violence
and assault is wrong 
and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action   
  fuck that 
  fuck that 
fuck the law enforcement community 
we got freedom of speech 
what the fuck can they do to us 
you wanna provoke  em and find out 
because this is a warning  cube 
and it s about  fuck tha police 
in particular  so 
i think  uh  maybe we should
not play that song right now 
not play what  fuck that  jerry 
that s what the song is about 
relax  relax  we re not giving in to anything 
i just say we retire it for now 
okay 
it is a reasonably worded threat 
this isn t  uh  street bullshit 
this isn t the crips and bloods and crap 
this is the federal government 
these guys can come after us
a million different ways 
i don t even want to think about it 
why provoke them 
  the fuck does that mean 
  if it was the lapd  maybe i d be a little worried 
  but we can t let them censor us  jerry 
  i m not advocating for censorship  cube 
maybe none of us should be worried 
maybe we should be happy 
what you mean  e 
 cause this right here is a gift 
  it s the fbi  e  what you talking about 
  this   
is free publicity for n w a 
we take this to the press
and we show them   
what type of intimidation 
discrimination and harassment   
that we dealing with from our government

  to be beaten on
and thrown in jail  
  we can go toe to toe
in the middle of a cell  
  fuckin  with me

  to tape off the scene
of the slaughter  
  still gettin  swoll
off bread and water  
  i don t know

  search a nigga down
and grabbin  his nuts  
  and on the other hand 
without a gun  they can t get none  
  but don t let it be
a black and a white one  
   cause they ll slam ya down
to the street top  
  black police showin  out
for the white cop  
  ice cube will swarm  
  on any muthafucka
in a blue uniform  
  just  cause

how do you explain inciting a riot in detroit 
what do you have to say about that 
i have to say that  uh 
we didn t incite that shit 
right  y all just got a snapshot
of how americans really feel 
we gave the people a voice 
we gave the people truth 
yeah  but your songs  they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs  guns  drugs 
our art is a reflection of our reality 
what you see
when you go outside your door 
  i know what i see 
  and it ain t glamorous 
we get aks from russia
and cocaine from colombia 
  and ain t none of us got a passport  so   
  yeah 
  might wanna check the source 
  next question 
will you be more careful about
what you say  how you say it 
  no 
  probably not  no 
freedom of speech
includes rap music  right 
well  we exercising our first amendment
as far as i m concerned 
and the government wrote that 
so  cube  what s a guy from compton do
when he starts making real money like this 
cube 
buy raider gear 
and curl activator 
next question 
good to see you  cube 
i can barely see you  jerry 
what s with all the godfather shit 
okay 
i know that you ve been very eager   
to sign a contract with eric s company 
ruthless records 
eric s company 
ain t it your company too 
that s incorrect 
it s not my company  i work for you 
  you work for me 
  uh huh 
i ve made that clear from the beginning 
all right  cool  so i could take this
to a lawyer or somebody  right 
cube  those guys are paid to make trouble 
they re gonna create problems
where no problems exist 
jerry  you know i don t know what
none of this legal shit mean  all right 
none of us do  we re gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything 
everybody else has already signed 
i thought you knew this 
you re the only one who hasn t 
there s also this 
 75 000 
shit 
sign the contract   
and all this money is yours 
that s my money anyway  jerry 
i earned that money 
  now  i wrote a lot of hit songs 
  mm hmm 
we ve been performing on this tour for
months    sellin  out shows  sellin  records 
  i know it s plenty of money 
  really 
jesus christ 
  give me my money  jerry 
  how the hell do you think this works 
how the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for 
the hotel rooms  the tour buses 
security  the parties  all this shit 
  how do you think it gets paid for  you think it s free 
  why are you doing this now 
if we were so good  why didn t you give us
contracts in the beginning 
because nothing is a sure thing  cube 
even a great talent can crash and burn 
too much ego  too much excess 
too many expectations 
it tends to ruin things 
you ought to keep that in mind 
this eric s company  right 
bye  jerry

of an unarmed motorist  rodney king 
and four guilty lapd officers   
who seem to be daryl gates s
standard issue 
it s also the lapd and the fbi   
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence 
 fuck tha police  is
just a warning  that s it 
you can t treat people like that
and expect  em not to rise up 
i m a journalist just like you   
reporting what s goin  on
in the hood 
the only thing that s different
is that i m brutally honest 
and what s your relationship
with the nation of islam 
they my brothers

that question right there proves to me   
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are 
you talkin  to me like i m some
elected official 
like i m running for office

the jury in the rodney king case
has delivered its verdict 
and not one of the four police officers   
seen on videotape
beating mr  king a year ago   
is guilty of using excessive force 
they ve all been found not guilty 
oh  for christ s sake 
  oh  my god 
  judy  the details 
peter  it was a clean sweep
for the defendants 
not guilty  the verdict for all of them 
  only on one count against lawrence powell

on excessive use of force
under color of authority   
could the jury not agree 
it s probably the worst case
of police misconduct that i ve ever seen

of this city and our police department 
it looks kind of like

courageous shop owners here  who are armed 
anarchy is obviously a statement
of political dissatisfaction 
police officers are still back down   
guarding the area down there
where the ralph s   
   the police are
using  eerily reminiscent   
of military style assault weapons 
the cars have been left
abandoned  because their drivers came under attack 
   the fire that
we showed you and that police presence 
we have fires burning 
olympic  pico 
more than 100 injured 
mostly in the south central
section of los angeles

since then  
  some more friends became enemies
in the quest of victory  
  but i made a vow

that i built an enterprise  
  and my house got a view
of the city like a high rise

how it used to be  
  i used to be
a starving artist  
  so i would never
starve an artist

it s where my heart is  
  it gets the hardest
when i think about the dearly departed  
  like the nigga

looking down through the clouds  
  and regardless 
i know my nigga still proud
