there never was 
you act like you ve never been here before 
i don t get here often enough 
that s the problem 
can you picture how drop dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain 
imagine this town in the  20s 
paris in the  20s 
in the rain  the artists and writers 
why does every city have to be in the rain 
what s wonderful about getting wet 
i mean  could you ever picture us
moving here after we re married 
oh god  no 
i could never live out of the united states 
you know  if i d stayed here and written novels 
and not gotten  you know  caught up in that 
just  grinding out movie scripts   
i ll tell you something 
i would drop the house in beverly hills 
the pool  everything 
in a second 
i mean  look 
this is where monet lived and painted 
we re 30 minutes from town 
imagine the two of us settling here 
we could do it  i mean 
if my book turns out 
you re in love with a fantasy 
i m in love with you 
we should get back to town 
we re meeting mom and dad for dinner 
let s meet  em 
there are our sightseers 
if i never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again  i   
  what a town 
  yes  to visit 
i could see myself living here 
i feel like the parisians kind of  get me  
i can see myself just strolling
along the left bank with a 
you know  baguette under my arm 
headed to café de flore
to scribble away on my book 
what did hemingway say 
he called it a  moveable feast  
in this traffic  nothing moves 
well  a toast to john s new business venture here 
  cheers 
  cheers 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
well  i ll be perfectly frank 
i m excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the french company  but otherwise 
i m not a big francophile 
  john hates their politics 
  certainly been no friend to the united states 
well  i mean  you can t exactly blame them
for not following us down that rabbit s hole in iraq 
  the whole bush  you know    
  oh  please  let s not get into this
  bad discussion again and again 
  honey  honey  we re not getting into   by the way  it s
fine for your father and i to disagree 
that s what a democracy is 
your father defends the right wing of the republican party 
and i happen to think you almost got to be
  like  a demented lunatic  but it s like   
  okay  okay 
but it doesn t mean we don t
respect each other s views  am i right 
  can we talk about the wedding plans 
  yes  please 
let s do that 
  your father is just   
  inez 
  huh  carol 
  hi 
oh my g    what are you doing here 
  nice to see you  hi 
  hey 
  how are you 
  good  thanks 
paul and carol bates  this is my mother
  and father  and  of course  you know gail 
  hi  very nice to meet you 
well  you    you didn t mention
you were going to be here 
no  it was sudden  um   
paul got invited to lecture at
the sorbone  sic   sorbonne 
oh  how wonderful 
well  uh  dad s here on business 
and we just decided to
  freeload along    yes 
  oh 
that s great  we can spend some time together 
well  i think we have a
lot of commitments  but i m sure it s   
  what 
  well  what are doing tomorrow 
  we re driving to verrsailles   sic  
  versailles   
  versailles 
  oh 
  i m dying to see versailles 
  yeah 
but it s too   uh   
we re late   i think what we re   
tomorrow we re locked in
to a lunch at brasserie lipp 
  oh no  that s just   
  yeah  yeah  we are  that s already   
you know i actually had
a professor that dined there 
and saw james joyce 
yeah  you know  like a
million years ago  and
apparently  joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters 
is that   
that s the end of the story 
well  i mean it s not a story 
it s like a detailed   
  we would love to go to versailles  yes 
  oh  good 
i hope you re not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at versailles 
  how was i antisocial 
  oh  please 
i mean  you could totally tell you didn t want to go 
well  i mean  they re your
friends  and i have to admit
i m not quite as taken with them as you are 
he s brilliant 
you know  i had such a crush on him
in college  and carol s very bright 
well  he s a pseudo intellectual 
  just a little bit 
  uh  gil 
i hardly think he d be lecturing at
the sorbonne if he s a pseudo intellectual 
you should give him your book to read 
oh  come on  why 
no  because he could critique your writing 
and maybe show you why you re
having so much trouble 
i m having trouble because
i m a hollywood hack
who never gave actual
literature a real shot 
  until now 
  please   gil   
honey  just promise me something 
if this book   doesn t pan out 
that you ll stop
eating your brains out 
and just go back to doing
what you do best 
i mean  the studios adore you 
you re in demand   
do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle 
  well   
  mmm 
mmm 
why would you   want to do that 
i believe louis moved his court here 
uh  in 1682 
originally  all this was swampland 
in fact  if i m not mistaken 
uh    in old french  the word  versailles 
means  uh  something like 
   terrain were the weeds have been pulled  
  is that right 
uh    the    uh  middle section here
uh    is    uh  french classical style at its height 
uh    the work  i believe  of   
uh   louis vau   louis le vau 
  yes 
  uh   mansart   i think   
  manzard   sic  
     and charles le brun  i believe 
yes  that s right 
i could get used to a summer home like this 
  i know you could 
  me  too 
except  remember  in those days 
they only had baths 
and i m definitely a shower man 
where are you two planning on
moving after you get married 
uh   malibu 
  really 
  we re thinking about malibu  yeah 
i m pushing for a little
attic in paris with a skylight 
  la bowhem   sic  
  yeah 
all that s missing is the tuberculosis 
exactly  thank you 
i mean  you know  the problem
is that he s not exactly sure
  he can write a novel 
  really 
  well   
  i mean  honey  so far your track record s   you know  and   
well  everyone loves your movies 
  yeah  well scripts are easier  so   
  wow 
why don t you tell them about the lead
character that you re working on right now 
  yes     oh  come on 
  i don t like to discuss my work 
well  dear  you don t have to tell
them the whole plot  just the character 
  no  no  no 
  okay 
he works in a nostalgia shop 
  what s a   what s a nostalgia shop 
  oh  not one of those stores where they sell
shirley temple dolls and old radios 
  and i never know who buys that stuff  who d want it 
  exactly 
  i don t know 
  well  people who live in the past 
people who think that
their lives would be happier
if they lived in an earlier time 
and just which era
would you have preferred
to live in  miniver cheevy 
paris in the  20s  in the rain 
  wouldn t have been bad 
  and the rain was an acid rain 
oh  i see  and no global warming 
no tv and suicide bombing 
and nuclear weapons  drug cartels 
usual menu of clichéd horror stories 
you know  nostalgia is denial 
  denial of the painful present 
  oh  whoa 
gil is a complete romantic 
i mean  he would be
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial 
  really 
  and the name for this fallacy
is called  golden age thinking  
  touché 
  yeah  the erroneous notion that
a different time period is better
than the one one s living in 
it s a flaw in the romantic
imagination of those people who   
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive 
  yes 
  this is the nicest ring we saw 
diamonds for a wedding band 
that s the way you d have to go 
and then  everyone will see
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger 
oh  inez  it s gonna be such an event 
  i only wish that   
  i don t want to keep going over it 
it s your choice  what can i say 
gil is   he s smart 
and he s very successful 
  he talks about giving that all up and moving here 
  oh  yeah  he talks about it 
well  that frightens me 
this is  of course  rodin s most famous statue 
a cast of this work was placed next to his tomb 
rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph 
  is that true 
  it would be in moudon  he died of the flu 
if i m not mistaken  in 1917  i believe 
  very good  sir 
  he s so knowledgeable  isn t he 
yeah  so much of rodin s work was influenced by his wife  camille 
yes  she was an influence  though
camille was not the wife  but his mistress 
  camille  no 
  yes 
  yes  rose was the wife 
  no  he was never married to rose 
yes  he did marry rose 
  in the last year their lives 
  i think you re mistaken 
are you arguing with the guide 
  yes  i am 
  yeah  no  i m certain  monsieur 
yeah  actually  she s right 
i recently read a two volume
biography on rodin  and
rose was definitely the wife 
camille  the mistress 
  yeah  you read that  where did you   
  yeah  i just read it   i was surprised
because i mistakenly thought  like you  that it was  yeah 
the other way around 
it s an easy mistake 
so  dad invited you guys for a wine tasting 
  oh  it ll be so french 
  yeah  yeah 
paul is an expert on french wine 
  you re joking  really 
  yes  of course 
when did you read the biography on rodin 
me  why would i read
a biography on rodin 
i will always take a california wine  but 
napa valley s 6 000 miles away 
john  old boy  how are you  buddy 
oh  hey  what re you doing here 
come on  i can t stand that guy 
um   how  bout
  we try some more wine 
  yes  let s start here 
now  which would you prefer here 
well  i think we need to be scientific and just
start drinking them all again  i don t know 
  why are your cheeks so red 
  what do you mean 
  they re not red 
  they re bright red 
oh  maybe it s because of the
pheromones that you re giving off 
these pheromones are driving me mad 
  stop it  stop 
  ahh   sex and alcohol 
  yeah 
  it fuels the desire
but kills the performance 
according to the bard 
have you tasted the  61 
it is divine 
  though  paul picked it out  i didn t   
  what 
  what s happening  what s happening 
  slightly more tannic than the  59 
and i prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling 
so  carol   carol and i
are gonna go dancing 
we heard of a great place  interested 
  no    i don t want to be a killjoy 
  come on 
but i need to get a little fresh air 
oh  come on  come on 
although if you re just gonna sit there and obsess
over where the fire exits are  then   
hey  if gil doesn t want to go 
i ll share paul with you 
i am very democratic 
and paul is a marvelous dancer 
if it s ok with you 
i think i just want to take a little walk 
go to bed  and then we ll do it another night 
ok  alright  well i can go  though  right 
  you want to go 
  well  yeah 
yeah  i mean  i m not tired 
and i ve been dying to go dancing 
and i ll just meet you back at the hotel 
  i ll take good care of her 
  ok 
i ll get a cab  taxi 
  ok  but you should take a cab 
  no  i m not taking a cab   i m walking 
  no  you ll get lost 
  ok  i m gonna walk 
is he a good writer 
i mean  have you read his prose 
  well  he won t let anybody 
  he won t let 
oh look  i mean  if he wants  i d be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him 
  that would be great 
  would you 
  you know  i think that s what he needs 
  yeah 
  well  it helps 
  to have it read by someone  yeah 
  and you wouldn t pull any punches 
  well  i certainly won t be letting
you know i won t do that 
 no 
i do that about you 
see  but  the problem is 
when it comes to his writing 
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else s opinion 
really 
oh  excuse me  parlez vous   
do you speak english 
  uh   hôtel bristol 
   parle pas anglais  désolé  we don t speak english  sorry

i   i   keep looking at the man playing piano  and i
believe it or not  recognize his
face from some old sheet music 
i know i can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics   not that i can write melodies  and i try

bon soir  tous le monde 
 good evening  everyone

greetings and salutations 
you ll forgive me 
i ve been mixing grain and grape 
now  this a writer  uh   gil  yes 
  gil   gil pender 
  gil pender 
hemingway 
hemingway 
you liked my book 
liked  i loved 
all your work 
yes  it was a good book 
because it was an honest book 
and that s what war does to men 
and there s nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud 
unless you die gracefully 
and then it s not only noble  but brave 
did you read my story 
what d you think 
there was some fine writing in it 
but it was unfulfilled 
  i might ve known you d hate it 
  but darling  you re too sensitive 
you liked my story  but he hates me 
please  old sport 
you make matters extremely difficult 
i m jumpy   suddenly i don t like
the atmosphere here any more 
ah  where re you going 
para reunirse con mis amigos en saint germain 
 to meet some friends on saint germain  
  he s going to saint germain  i m going with him 
  zelda  sweetheart   
if you re going to stay here and drink
with him  i m going with the toreador 
would you bring her back
at a reasonable time 
  she ll drive you crazy  this woman 
  she s exciting 
and she has talent 
this month it s writing 
last month it was something else 
you re a writer  you need time to write 
not all this fooling around 
she s wasting you because she s
really a competitor  don t you agree 
me 
speak up  for christ s sake  i m asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake 
actually  i don t know the fitzgeralds that well 
you re a writer  you make observations 
you were with them all night 
could we not discuss my personal life in public 
she s jealous of his gift 
and it s a fine gift  it s rare 
  you like his work  you can speak for it 
  stop it  stop it 
you like mark twain 
i m going to find zelda 
i don t like the thought
of her with that spaniard 
may i 
yeah  i m actually a huge mark twain fan 
i think you can even make the case
that all modern american literature
comes from huckleberry finn 
  you box 
  no  not really  no 
what re you writing 
  a novel 
   bout what 
it s about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop 
what the hell is a nostalgia shop 
a place where they sell old things  memorabilia 
and    does that sound terrible 
no subject is terrible if the story is true 
if the prose is clean and honest 
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure 
no good 
can i ask you the biggest favor in the world 
  what is it 
  would you read it 
  your novel 
  yeah  it s like
400 pages long  and i m just
looking for  you know  an opinion 
my opinion is i hate it 
i mean  you haven t even read it 
if it s bad  i ll hate it
because i hate bad writing 
and if it s good  i ll be envious and hate it all the more 
you don t want the opinion of another writer 
yeah  you know  it s just   
you know what it is 
i m having a hard time 
you know  trusting somebody to evaluate it 
writers are competitive 
i m not gonna be competitive with you 
you re too self effacing 
it s not manly 
if you re a writer 
declare yourself the best writer 
but you re not  as long as i m around 
unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it 
no  i don t 
hey  i m not gonna read your novel 
but i ll tell you what i ll do 
yes 
i ll bring it to gertrude stein s 
she s the only one i trust with my writing 
you ll show my novel to gertrude stein 
  give it to me 
  i ll bring it to you 
  and she gets back from spain tomorrow 
  great 
i m gonna go get it 
i m gonna   
i can t tell you how excited i am 
this is gonna be such a lift 
my heart is just racing right now 
i m gonna get it  and i ll be back

ok  we never said where
we were gonna meet 
good thing you didn t go last night 
you would ve hated the music  and the crowd 
but i had fun 
what re you thinking about 
you seem like you re in a daze 
if i was to tell you that i spent
last night with ernest hemingway
and scott fitzgerald 
  what would you say 
  is that what you were dreaming about 
your literary idols 
yeah  but if i wasn t dreaming   
what does that mean 
if i was with hemingway 
and fitzgerald 
and cole porter 
i d be thinking brain tumor 
and when i tell you 
zelda fitzgerald is exactly
as we ve come to know her through
everything we ve read in books and articles 
you know  charming  but all over the map 
you know  she does not like
hemingway one bit 
and scott knows hemingway is right about her 
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her 
come on  get up  we should
quit the idle chatter 
because we re gonna be late 
you know  i m not gonna   
i think i m gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel 
 cause there s a little polishing i wanna do 
no  you can do that later 
mom said we can use her decorator s discount  get up 
come look at these  inez

oh wait  it s euros  so it s more 
  so that s like 20   20 000

i know  but it s very hard
to find anything like this at home 
  she s right  gil 
  i know  but we haven t even found a house yet 
and we re trying to keep expenses down 
so i don t have to take any crummy rewrite jobs 
well  you get what you pay for 
  nice 
  cheap is cheap 
ok  you guys want to walk back 
walk  no  it s starting to rain 
oh  it ll be nice walking in the rain 
it s beautiful 
no  there s nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain 
no  don t forget 
we re taking you to dinner tonight

and then  also  i have a big
surprise for you after dinner

the most amazing adventure of your life 
  where 
  just  inez  please 
  why are you carrying that manuscript around 
  you ll see  and when you do 
your jaw is gonna drop 
ok  you know i wouldn t hide anything 
so if i m saying it s incredible 
  it s   
  ok 
  it s just  i don t understand 
  i know  you ve been wondering why i ve been acting strange all day 
  yeah 
  well  you re about to find out 
and you re gonna wonder why i wasn t
acting more strange  when you find out 
  this is very   
  i know  i know 
well  i don t know what you re carrying on about 
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure 
i am tired from the gym and a massage 
so i m gonna get this cab 
  taxi 
  inez  wait 
  let s just wait a little longer 
  look 
you want to walk the streets of paris 
and take it in by night 
that s fine  you go ahead 
but i m in the middle of a great book that carol lent me 
come on  just 10 more minutes 
and then we can walk home 
if i m asleep when you get in 
don t wake me up 
what am i doing wrong 
unless she s right 
and i need to see a neurologist 
ok  you left the wine tasting  a little drunk 
but not out of control 
lost  you walk along   
this is the spot   
i mean  it s just like a one shot deal 
the clock struck midnight   
hello 
oh  hi  mr  hemingway  here 
let me just jump in 
the assignment was to take the hill 
there were 4 of us 
5 if you counted vicente  but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off
and couldn t fight as he could when i first met him 
and he was young  and brave 
and the hill was soggy from days of rain 
and the hill sloped down toward a road 
and there were many german soldiers on the road 
and the idea was to aim for the first group 
and if our aim was true  we could delay them 
  were you scared 
  of what 
getting killed 
you ll never write well
if you re afraid of dying 
  do you 
  yeah  i do  i d say it s probably   
maybe my greatest fear  actually 
well  that s something all men before
you have done  all men will do 
  i know  i know 
  have you ever made love to a truly great woman 
actually  my fiancée is pretty sexy 
and when you make love to her 
you feel true  and beautiful
passion  and you  for at least that moment 
lose your fear of death 
no  that doesn t happen 
i believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death 
all cowardice comes from not loving 
or not loving well  which is the same thing 
and when the man who is brave and true
looks death squarely in the face
like some rhino hunters i know 
or belmonte  who s truly brave 
it is because they love with sufficient
passion  to push death out of their minds 
until it returns  as it does  to all men 
and then you must make really good love again 
think about it 
  alice  how the hell are you 
  hi 
good  good  ah  she s here  follow me 
  non  je ne suis pas d accord  no  i don t agree  
  mais pourquoi   but why  
parce que     because    
this is gil pender  miss stein 
he s a young american writer 
i thought you two should know each other 
i m glad you re here 
you can help decide which of us is right 
and which of us is wrong 
i was just telling pablo that
this portrait doesn t capture adriana 
it has a universality  but no objectivity 
non  non  non  vous ne le comprenez pas correctement 
 no  no  no  you don t understand correctly  
connaisez pas adriana  regardez   
 you don t know adriana  look    
regardez le mouvement  le tableau 
 look at the motion  the painting  
c est exactement ce qu elle représente 
 it s exactly what she represents  
non  tu n as pas raison  no  you re wrong  
look how he s done her 
dripping with sexual innuendo 
carnal to the point of smoldering 
and  yes  she s beautiful  but
it s a subtle beauty 
an implied sensuality 
i mean  what is your first
impression of adriana 
exceptionally lovely 
belle  mais trop subtile  plus implicite  pablo 
 beautiful  but too subtle  more defined  pablo  
yes  you re right  miss stein 
 course   uh   
you can see why he s lost all objectivity 
he s made a creature of place pigalle 
a whore with volcanic appetites 
non  non  c est ce qu elle vraiment si vous la connaissez 
 no  no  it s true if you know her  
yes  avec toi  au privé 
 yes  with you  in private  
because she s your lover 
but we don t know her that way 
so you make a petit bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure 
  it s more like a still life than a portrait 
  non 
non  non  je ne suis pas d accord 
 no  no  i do not agree  
and what s this book of
yours i ve been hearing about 
is this it 
  yeah  this is   uh   
  i ll take a look 
have you read it  hemingway 
no  this i leave to you 
you ve always been a fine judge of my work 
   out of the past  was the name of the store  
 and its products consisted of memories  
 what was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation  
 had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years 
 to a status at once magical and also camp  
i love it 
i m already hooked 
hooked 
i ll start it tonight 
but first  you and i
have something to talk about 
i ve been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor 
i sent him the piece you and i
looked at  plus four others 
plus four shorter pieces 
and this guy  i gave him a copy of the   
  nevertheless  two months  nary a word 
  right 
so were you really hooked
with those opening lines 
oh  the past has always had a
great charisma for me 
oh  me  too 
great charisma for me 
i always say that i was born too late 
mmm  moi aussi 
 mmm  me  too  
for me  la belle époque paris
would have been perfect 
  really  better than now 
  yes 
another whole sensibility 
the street lamps  the kiosques 
the   horse and carriages 
and maxim s then 
you speak very good english 
  no  not really 
  no  you do 
how long have you been dating picasso 
my god  did i just say that 
pardon 
i don t mean to   i didn t mean to pry    
were you born in paris 
i was born in bordeaux 
i moved here to study fashion 
but you don t want to hear all this 
yes  i do 
yes  continue 
you moved here to study fashion   
i   came here to study with coco chanel 
and i fell in love with paris 
and also 
a very dark eyed  haunted
jewish italian painter 
and i knew amedeo had another woman  but still 
i couldn t resist moving into his apartment when he asked 
and it was a beautiful six months 
m  m   modigliani 
you lived with   
you lived with modigliani 
you asked me 
so i m telling you my sad story 
with braque  though  there was another woman 
many 
and now 
with pablo 
i mean  he s married 
but   
every day  it s on again  off again 
i don t know how any woman
can stay with him  he s so difficult 
my god  you take  art groupie 
to a whole new level 
  pardon 
  nothing  i was just saying that   
but tell me about yourself 
  what  well  what can i say   
  so  have you come to paris to write 
because  you know 
these days  so many americans
feel the need to move here 
isn t hemingway attractive 
i love his writing 
i know  actually  i m just here visiting 
oh  you must stay here 
  really 
  yeah  it s a wonderful city  for
  writers  artists 
  i know  i d like to  but it s not that easy 
and 
i didn t fall in love madly with your book   
  really 
     so i want to hear the rest of it 
  you really like  because i m still kind of tinkering   
  pender 
  yeah  let s go up to montmartre  let s get a drink  ok 
  uh   yeah 
i ll discuss your book with you as soon as i ve finished it 
where can i reach you 
why don t i drop back by  instead of you
trying to find me  if that s all right 
  we run an open house 
  are you coming with us 
i wish that i could 
i cant  but
hopefully i ll see you again eventually 
that would be nice 
  let s go 
  one of these days  i plan to steal you away from this genius
who s great  but he s no miró 
i m gil pender 
i was with hemingway  and picasso 
pablo picasso  and ernest hemingway 
i m gil pender  from pasadena 
cub scouts  i failed freshman english 
little old gil pender has his novel
with gertrude  stein 
boy  that girl was so   
lovely 
well  it s a shame you two didn t
come to the movies with us last night 
we saw a wonderfully
funny american film 
who was in it 
oh  i don t know 
i forget the name 
wonderful but forgettable 
that sounds like a picture i ve seen 
i probably wrote it 
well  i know it was moronic and infantile  and
utterly lacking in any wit or believability 
  but john and i laughed in spite of all that 
  have we been down this way yet 
was it 
what time did you get in last night 
not that late   uh   
i was   uh   
i m really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively 
without the distractions of the day 
i ll probably end up going on another little
  hike tonight 
  well  we ll see 
yeah  we ll see 
oh  look at those wonderful glass figures 
 cole porter s  you do something to me  
     that simply mystifies me  
  tell me why should it be   
  you have the power to hypnotize me  
vous aimez 
 you like  
yes  very beautiful 
  oh  you re american 
  yeah 
you like cole porter 
i do  i m a big fan 
i like to
kind of think i m a member
of linda and cole s inner circle 
i m kidding 
very pretty lyrics 
  very amusing 
  charming 
gil 
  gil  hi 
  yeah  yes 
  yeah  we should go 
  we re going now 
yeah  we re meeting paul and carol
at the museum for the private showing 
  ok  yeah  right 
you know  paul happens to be an expert in monet 
so you ll find it enlightening  i think 
yeah  ok 
let s get some culture 
the juxtaposition of color is amazing 
this man was the real father
of abstract expressionism 
i take that back 
maybe turner 
i mean  i love turner 
but  i just find this   
overwhelming 
if i m not mistaken 
it took him 2 years to complete this 
he worked out of giverny 
where he was frequently   
i heard that monet 
one of the things that he used to try to   
shh  i m trying to hear paul say it 
well  he was frequently
visited by caillebotte 
an artist who i personally feel was underrated 
ah  now 
here s a superb picasso 
if i m not mistaken  he painted
this marvelous portrait of his
french mistress
madeleine brissou in the  20s 
paul  i m gonna have to
differ with you on this one 
  really 
  gil  just pay attention 
you might learn something 
ok  well  if i m not mistaken 
this was a failed attempt to capture
a young french girl named adriana 
from bordeaux  if my art history serves me 
who came to paris to study
costume design for the theater 
i m pretty sure she had an affair
with modigliani  then braque 
which is how pablo met her 
picasso 
of course  what you don t get
from this portrait
is the subtlety 
and her beauty 
she was just a knock out 
what have you been smoking 
i d hardly call this picture marvelous 
it s more of a petit bourgeois statement
on how pablo sees her  saw her 
he s distracted by the fact
that she was a
absolute volcano in the sack 
too rich for me 
where d gil run off to 
work 
been walking around paris  you know 
the way the city s lit up at night
allegedly inspires him  so   
but that s ok 
because i m going dancing with paul 
where s carol 
uh   she s in bed with a bad oyster 
so i ll see you guys later 
thanks for dinner  daddy 
bye  sweetie 
where do you think
gil goes every night 
you heard her 
he walks  and gets ideas 
  you sound skeptical 
  no 
i ve seen what he earns 
but sometimes i think he s got a   
got a    part missing 
and i didn t like his remark about
tea party republicans 
they are decent
people trying to take back the country 
they are not
crypto fascist
airhead zombies 
you hear him say that 
nevertheless  i don t think
your idea of having him followed
  is very practical 
  no 
i d like to know where he goes every night 
well  we know one thing 
he doesn t go dancing 
oh  excuse me 
  is this gentleman bothering you 
  hello  gil 
hey  how are you 
i was hoping we d see you here 
  what a great party 
  oh  good 
  it s nice to see you here 
  thank you 
oh  delfine 
  gil  we ll catch up with you later  ok 
  sure  sure 
bon soir  madame 
 good evening  madame  
  what a surprise 
  it was just a total fluke 
i was at gertrude stein s 
she s almost finished with my novel 
and i run into this guy 
turns out he s archibald macleish 
he says he s on his way over here 
come on over  oh  i m not
going to crash the fitzgeralds 
but then he said you d be here 
you and pablo  and   
oh  pablo s home 
  we had a   bit of a quarrel 
  oh no 
  you look like you were having fun with djuna barnes  dancing 
  oh  yeah 
wait  that was djuna barnes 
  yeah 
  wow  no wonder she wanted to lead 
isn t this a wonderful
place to throw a party 
  it s so great 
  only the fitzgeralds can do that 
  i want to show you something  come with me 
  ok 
  so  what about your book 
  it s coming along  yeah 
look at that 
  wow 
  it s from the turn of the century 
isn t it beautiful 
it s my favorite era 
i love it so much 
everything was so perfect 
it s so nice to see you tonight 
  i was hoping to   
  it s so nice to see you 
voilà  ma petite adriana 
 there she is  my little adriana  
isn t this little parisian
dream a moveable feast 
mark my words 
i m going to steal you away
from that fugitive from
málaga one way or another 
between belmonte and myself 
whom would you choose 
vous êtes tous deux parfaits 
 you are both perfect  
but he has more courage 
he faces death more often  and
more directly  and if you chose him 
i d be disappointed  but i d understand 
ella ha elegido pablo  
 she chose pablo  
yes  she s chosen picasso 
but pablo thinks
women are only to sleep
with or to paint 
what about you 
i think a woman is equal
to a man in courage 
have you ever shot
a charging lion 
never 
would you like to know
how that feels 
  i don t think so 
  you ever hunted 
  no 
  you 
only for bargains 
tomémonos otra copita 
 let s take another drink  
you know  it s so loud 
i wonder if we can go some place
  where we can hear ourselves think a little bit 
  sure  bye 
who wants a fight 
well  i hope it was nothing
serious with you and pablo 
he s moody and possessive 
artists are like children 
well  you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you 
 cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever 
  it s so interesting   
  oh 
  you re interesting  too  in a lost way 
  lost 
well  i guess i am lost 
tell me more about your book 
my book is kind of a   
you know what 
i couldn t care less about my book tonight 
i just want to walk around paris with you 
i keep forgetting you re just a tourist 
that s putting it mildly 
i can never decide whether
paris is more beautiful by day or by night 
no  you can t 
you couldn t pick one  i mean 
i can give you a checkmate
argument for each side 
you know  i sometimes think 
 how s anyone gonna come up with a
book  or a painting  or a
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city  
you can t   cause  like 
you look around  every   
every street  every boulevard
is its own special art form 
and when you think that in the cold 
violent  meaningless universe 
that paris exists  these lights   
i mean  come on  there s nothing
happening on jupiter or neptune 
but from way out in space
you can see these lights 
the cafés  people drinking  and singing   
i mean  for all we know 
paris is the hottest spot in the universe 
  vous êtes un poète  you are a poet  
  aw  come on 
it s just    you re very kind 
but i wouldn t call my babbling poetic 
although i was on a pretty good roll there 
see anything you like 
yeah  i m ashamed to admit
i m attracted to all of them 
i like cheap sexy 
that makes me shallow 
when i was in catholic school 
one weekend
my roommate and i 
we paid a girl from pigalle
to come and teach us all her tricks 
  honestly 
  yeah 
wow  that s   
that s   that s   
i m going to be thinking about that one 
i love walking with you 
  you look amazing 
  thank you 
god  is that who i think it is 
what is she doing here 
staring into the water 
oh my god 
zelda  what are you doing  
  please  i don t want to live 
  stop 
  what is it 
  scott and that beautiful countess 
they were   it was so obvious
they were whispering about me 
and the more they drank 
the more he fell in love with her 
he   scott loves only you 
  i can tell you that with absolute certainty 
  no 
  he s tired of me 
  you re wrong  you re wrong  i know 
  how 
  trust me  i know 
  sometimes you get a feel for people  and i get   
  my skin hurts 
  what do you mean 
  i don t wanna   i hate the way i look 
don t do that 
  here  take this 
  what is this 
it s a valium 
it ll make you feel better 
  you carry medicine 
  no  not normally 
it s just since i ve been engaged to inez 
i ve been having panic attacks 
but i m sure they ll subside after the wedding 
i ve never heard of valium 
what is this 
it s the   pill of the future 
you never said you were getting married 
yeah  you know 
it s still a    
ways in the future 
  well  good luck with your book  and your wedding 
  thank you 
i think you d like inez 
she has a   
has a very sharp sense of humor  and
she s attractive  she doesn t say
that we agree on everything  but   
but the important things 
yeah  or   actually 
maybe the small things  the   
sometimes there s a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things 
she wants to live in malibu  and
wants me to work in hollywood  and    
but i will say that we both like
indian food 
not all indian food  but the   
you know   the pita bread 
we both like pita bread 
i guess it s called naan 
i should go 
pablo will be missing me 
  come on  i ll walk you home 
  no  no  no 
just finish your drink 
i live just around the corner 
  no  come on  i m not gonna   
  well  i   i   prefer to be by myself for a while 
but thank you for the evening 
bye 
monsieur  c est un dommage 
 sir  it s a shame  
c est un dommage 
 it s a shame  
we met  earlier tonight   
at the party 
dalí  sí 
 dalí  yes  
  yes   
  dalí 
  i remember 
  dalí  ya 
un bouteille de vin rouge 
 a bottle of red wine  
it can t be   
yeah    
so 
un autre verre pour monsieur  s il vous plaît 
 another glass for this man  please  
i love the language 
the french 
the waiters  no 
you like the shape of the rhinoceros 
the rhinoceros  uh   
haven t really thought about it 
i paint the rhinoceros 
i paint you 
sí  your sad eyes 
your big lips  melting over the hot sand 
with one tear 
yes  and in your tear 
another face 
the christ s face 
yes  in the rhinoceros 
yeah  i mean  i probably do look sad  i m in   
a very perplexing situation 
diablo   luis  oye  luis 
 damn  luis  hey  luis  
my friends 
this    señor buñuel 
  buñuel 
  sí  buñuel   and   mr  man ray 
  man ray  my gosh 
  how  bout that 
this is pen der  pen der 
pender 
  yes  and i am dalí 
  dalí  yes 
you have to remember 
pender is in a perplexing situation 
it sounds so crazy to say 
you guys are going to think i m drunk  but
i have to tell someone  i m   
from a   
a different time  another era 
the future  ok  i come   
from the 2000th millenium to here 
i get in a car  and i slide through time 
exactly correct 
you inhabit two worlds 
  so far  i see nothing strange 
  why 
yeah  you re surrealists 
but i m a normal guy 
see  in one life 
i m engaged to marry a woman i love 
at least  i think i love her 
christ  i better love her 
i m marrying her 
the rhinoceros makes love
by mounting the female 
but   
is there a difference
in the beauty between two
rhinoceroses 
there is another woman 
adriana  yes  and i m   
very drawn to her 
i find her extremely alluring 
the problem is that other men 
great artists   geniuses  
also find her alluring 
and she finds them 
so  there s that   
a man in love with a woman
from a different era 
i see a photograph 
i see a film 
i see an insurmountable problem 
i see   
   a rhinoceros 
did you get any work done last night 
yeah   i just    
i m starting to think that maybe my
book is too realistic 
that i m missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of
go crazy  and not be so
damn logical 
  why do you always look so good in the morning 
  no  no  no  no 
  we have to get dressed 
  just for a second 
come here  i ve been working like a demon 
i gotta get this stuff done  but
i can t resist you any more 
you re so fetching in the morning 
paul said we have to go to the countryside 
you know  he said he s taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch 
but  i mean  if you don t want to go 
don t go 
i m not missing it because of you 
hello  bonjour 
  hello  i have a quick question for you about rodin 
  hello 
ok  now  i understand
he loved his wife
and he also loved his mistress 
  yes 
  but do you think that s possible 
to love two women at once 
well  he loved them both 
but in a different way 
you know   
that s very   
that s very french 
you guys are way   
you know   much   
more evolved in that department
than we are 
do you remember me 
i was in the   
  was in the group that   
  yes 
the group with the pedantic gentleman 
pedantic  yes 
that s a perfect word 
here is     his photo 
i want to know where
he goes each night 
what is your suspicion  hm 
he s engaged to my daughter 
to marry  i want to make sure
that she s making the right decision 
naturally  discretion is paramount 
well  you ve come to the
right place  monsieur 
monsieur tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman 
and report about his whereabouts at night 
whoa  whoa  whoa  hey 
hey  thank you for stopping 
  gil pender 
  tom eliot 
tom eliot 
tom stearns eliot 
t s eliot  t s  eliot 
  pender 
  prufrock s like my mantra 
ok  sorry  sorry 
listen  where i come from 
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons 
  hello  ms  stein 
  oh  pender 
i ll get to your book in a moment 
i finished it 
we re just in the middle
of a little personal crisis 
oh  ok  should i come back 
i don t want to interrupt 
no  it s no secret 
adriana has left pablo 
and has flown to africa with hemingway 
sabía que tenía obsesión con este fanfarrón 
 i knew that i had an obsession with that bully  
ya hemos hablado de todo esto 
 we talked about all this  
estoy segura de que ella regresará muy devoto 
 i m sure that she ll come back very devoted  
muy devoto  oh  he took her hunting kudu 
but she ll be back to him 
the sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you re trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy 
mount kilimanjaro is not paris 
  what are you saying  that he took her to mount kilimanjaro 
  now  about your book 
it s very unusual  indeed 
i mean  in a way  it s almost like science fiction 
we all fear death 
and question our place in the universe 
the artist s job is not to succumb to despair 
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence 
you have a clear and lively voice 
don t be such a defeatist 
tell gil to bring his suit   cause we re
going to be dining formal tomorrow night 
i forgot to tell you  actually 
gil isn t coming to mont saint michel 
why not 
i don t understand it 
because  he writes 
he rewrites 
he rewrites the rewrites  you know 
he says   picasso never left his studio  
i said   gil  you have absolutely
nothing in common with picasso  
he just looks at me 
well  he s gonna miss a great weekend 
 cole porter s  let s do it  let s fall in love  
  and that s why birds do it  
  bees do it  
  even educated fleas do it  
  let s do it
let s fall in love  
  in spain  the best upper sets do it  
  lithuanians and letts do it  
you have any cole porter 
  hi 
  hey 
  i remember you 
  yeah 
  he was your friend 
  cole porter  yeah 
and don t forget about linda 
she was a friend  too 
  you realize i was kidding 
  yeah  i did realize 
you re a bit young 
yeah  you seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work 
it s because he wrote
many songs about paris 
yeah  what was the story  it was like he was
in love with your hometown  or something 
  are you a parisian 
  yes  monsieur 
 yes  monsieur   feel free to call me gil 
  what do i owe you 
  for this 
  dix huit euros    18 
  ok 
  oysters down in oyster bay do it  
  let s do it
let s fall in love  
  cold cape cod clams
 gainst their wish  do it  
  even lazy jellyfish do it  
  let s do it  let s fall in love  
can you translate this 
do you speak any english 
ok  alright  thank you 
 that paris exists 
and anyone could choose to live 
 anywhere else in the world 
will always be a mystery to me  
 dinner with   dinner with pablo 
and henri matisse  
 pablo is the greater artist 
but matisse is the greater painter  
 paris in the summer 
what it must have been like  
 to sit opposite one s
lover at maxim s  in its    
 in its   um   best time  
 i m in love with an american
writer i just met  
 named gil pender  
 that immediate magic one hears
about happened to me  
 i know that both picasso and
hemingway are in love with me  
 but for whatever   inexplicable    
  inexplicable   reason   the heart has 
  yes  yes 
 i am drawn by gil  
 perhaps because he seems naïve and unassuming  
 as always in this sad life  
 he s about to marry a woman named inez  
 i had a dream where he came to me 
 and brought me a little gift 
earrings  they were  
 and we made love  
earrings   
earrings    
whoa  oh my god 
what are you guys doing 
daddy had chest pains 
  oh  really 
  yeah  i m sure it s just indigestion 
  we can t take that chance 
  you know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago 
yeah  right 
they put a balloon in me 
big deal 
  balloon 
  i would like the hotel doctor  please  in room 728 
don t call the doctor 
gil  why are you so dressed up 
me  no  no  no  i m not 
i ve been writing 
i was just doing a little writing 
wh   you dress up and
put on cologne to write 
no  no  i jumped in the shower 
just for a second  you know
how i think better in the shower 
and i get the positive ions going in there 
so  we were halfway to mont saint michel
when daddy just   
he went pale as a ghost 
  that s terrible 
  i mean  it was so scary  so we just
  turned right around and came back 
  yeah  you had to 
john  is there anything i can get 
for your color to me looks
  like it s ok  but i m not a doctor 
  naw  i m fine 
i m sure it s the
beef bourguignon she made me have 
  what is that 
  where 
  that in your hand 
  nothing 
  that was a present

  is it jewelry  i hope it s my taste  if it s jewelry  because   
  well   
     that moonstone necklace 
  but i thought you liked the moon 
because it s understated  but elegant 
that s what you always say 
cheap is cheap 
is what i always say 
yeah  you didn t see this necklace 
i ve never actually even worn it 
i ll show you  you ll see why immediately 
  everybody s down on moonstone  all of a sudden 
  well   
  they are   
  a little simple 
i think    i thought
you loved their simplicity 
yeah  that s the problem 
they re too simple 
well  what do i know 
too simple 
where are my pearl earrings 
did   did you bring them 
i don t even remember you packing them 
yes  i did  because i ve worn them here 
no  you didn t 
oh  they must ve fallen out 
both of them 
gil  my ears are pierced 
inez  i told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe 
  do you think it was the maid 
  it s always the maid 
i   i know i saw them
here this morning 
well  i would report the theft right away 
you know  she was so snotty
yesterday when i asked her   
whoa  whoa  whoa  let s not
jump to any conclusions  ok 
  you don t just level a charge of theft against somebody 
  yes  i d like to report a theft 
  shh  inez  no 
  could you call the house detective 
  send him up  thank you 
  this is turning into a witch hunt 
you don t do this to people 
yes  you do 
if they ve stolen 
i didn t like that maid 
i didn t like her from the beginning 
she was sweet  she was pleasant 
she was upbeat 
you always take the
side of the help  as usual 
that s why daddy says you re a communist 
bon soir   good evening  
i m doctor gérard 
  do you want some more water 
  i m fine 
  he s had angioplasty 
  i didn t need it 
look  are these them 
i don t know 
  where did you find them 
  they were just in the bathroom 
  in the bathroom 
  yeah  on the sink 
what the hell were they
doing in the bathroom 
i don t know 
they were just   
but maybe you dropped them  and
when you were putting them away 
and the housekeeper must ve picked them up 
and placed them there  out in
the open where we could see them easily 
that was really thoughtful of her 
i didn t drop them 
i wouldn t drop them 
the important thing is
they re not stolen 
c est l un de vos meilleurs  jusqu au présent 
 it s one of your best  until now  
j ai parlé à leo  je pense qu il va l acheter
 i talked to leo  i think that he ll buy it  
oh  pender 
i was just telling matisse
we re going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection 
i think 500 francs is fair 
500 francs for a matisse 
yeah  i think that sounds fair 
you know  i was wondering if
maybe i could pick up 6 or 7 
  what have we got here 
  yeah  oh 
ok  now  i ve brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book 
and if you could just tell me if i m
heading in the right direction  i d really appreciate it 
  leave it with me 
  ok  great 
and have you heard from hemingway 
oh  they ve been back for days  now 
the trip didn t work out 
i knew they wouldn t hit it off 
it s over  with picasso  too 
she s at deyrolle  by herself 
by herself 
oh  one of those crazy
surrealist painters is getting married 
they re doing it up there 
she ll be glad to see you 
eh bien  mes chers amies  je propose de porter un toast   
 well  my dear friends  i propose to raise a toast to    
oh  what are you doing here 
i came to find you 
  you did 
  yeah  maybe this is coming out of left field  but
let s just say  as a writer 
i m pretty good at
picking up on vibrations from people 
women in particular 
i sense that there are
some complicated feelings  maybe 
that you have for me 
aren t you gonna get married 
well  everything s a little
up in the air right now 
i don t know what is gonna happen 
is there some place that we
can talk  maybe more quiet 
  sure 
  come on 
oh  mr  buñuel 
i had a nice idea
for a movie for you 
  yes 
  a group of people attend a
very formal dinner party  at the end of dinner 
when they try to leave the room  they can t 
why not 
they just can t seem to exit the door 
  b   but why 
  well  momento 
when they re forced to stay together 
the veneer of civilization
quickly fades away 
and what you re left with is
who they really are   animals 
but i don t get it 
why don t they just
walk out of the room 
all i m saying is just think about 
who knows 
maybe when you re shaving one day 
it ll tickle your fancy 
i don t understand 
what s holding them in the room 
what are you doing 
i don t know 
i did feel 
for a minute there 
while i was doing it  like i was immortal 
but you look so sad 
because life is too mysterious 
this is the time we live in 
everything moves so fast 
life is noisy and complicated 
i ve always been a logical person 
i ve never
i never acted too crazy 
i didn t stay here 
when i first came out here 
i didn t take a real shot at being a writer 
i d just  kind of  be a hired hollywood hand 
don t laugh  i just want to   
i feel like i just want to let it go

degas and i were just
talking about how this   
um   this   cette   génération est plus vide  et il manque d imagination 
    this generation is empty  and is missing imagination  
he said   he says that
this generation is empty 
and has no imagination 
better to have lived during the   
la renaissance 
no  this is the golden age 
  non 
  c est l âge d or  it s the golden age  
pas de tout  la renaissance  c est beaucoup mieux 
 not at all  the renaissance is much better  
qu est ce que vous faites dans la vie 
 what is it you do  
j étudie la haute couture 
 i study high fashion  
c est pour ça vous êtes      that s why you re dressed like that

  ah  oui  he wants to have you meet his friend richard 
he s looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet 
so  vous intéresse 
 so  you re interested  
  ballet costumes 
  yes 
oh my god  i   
i don t live here 
i mean  i do  but i don t  i   
it s best not to go
into too many details  we re   
we re temporarily
passing through 
can i speak with you a minute 
permitée 
 may i  
enchanté  
wow  it didn t take
gaugin long to start steaming in 
let s never go back to the  20s 
  what are you talking about 
  we should stay here 
it s the start of la belle époque 
it s the greatest  most
beautiful era paris has ever known 
yeah  but about the  20s 
and the charleston 
and the fitzgeralds 
and the hemingways 
i mean  i love those guys 
but it s the present 
it s dull 
dull 
it s not my present 
i m from 2010 
what do you mean 
i dropped in on you the same way
we re dropping in on the 1890s 
you did 
i was trying to escape my present
the same way you re trying to escape yours 
to a golden age 
surely you don t think
the  20s are a golden age 
well  yeah  to me they are 
but i m from the  20s  and i m
telling you the golden age is la belle époque 
and look at these guys  i mean  to them 
their golden age was the renaissance 
you know  they re trade belle époque
to be painting alongside
titian and michelango 
and those guys probably imagined
life was a lot better
when kublai khan was around 
you see  i m having an insight right now 
it s a minor one  but
it explains the anxiety in my dream that i had 
  what dream 
  i had a dream the other night  where
it was like a nightmare 
where i ran out of zithromax 
and then i went to the dentist 
and he didn t have any novocaine 
you see what i m saying 
these people don t have any antibiotics 
what are you talking about 
adriana  if you stay here 
and this becomes your present 
then  pretty soon  you ll start
imagining another time was really your 
you know  was really the golden time 
that s what the present is 
that it s a little unsatisfying 
because life s a little unsatisfying 
that s the problem with writers 
you are so full of words 
but i am more emotional 
and i m going stay 
and live in paris  most glorious time 
you made a choice to leave
paris once  and you regretted it 
yeah  i did regret it 
it was a bad decision 
but at least it was a choice 
i mean  it was a real choice 
this way  i think  is 
i don t know  crazy 
it doesn t really work 
if i ever want to write
something worthwhile  i have to 
you know  get rid of my
illusions  and then i d be
happier in the past 
as where i want a home 
so   
goodbye  gil 
goodbye 
pender  i read your rewrite 
and you re nicely on the right track 
you understood me clearly 
if the rest of the book
reads as well when you re done 
  you ll have something of value 
  that is the best news 
i really did listen to you 
so i m happy to hear that it
you know  it seems like i m
moving forward 
i mean  it just means
the world to me that you
  hemingway read the chapters  too  and he thinks   
  he read it 
   he thinks it s going to be a fine book 
but he did have one plot suggestion 
what s the suggestion 
well  he doesn t quite believe
that the protagonist
doesn t see that his fiancée is
having an affair right before his eyes 
  with 
  the other character  the pedantic one 
that s called denial 
thank you 
you re crazy 
paul and i 
where did you get such an insane notion 
where  from ernest hemingway 
he figured it out  and  guess what 
it makes perfect sense 
gil  your brain tumor s acting up again 
  no  no 
  there s nothing crazy about hemingway 
or fitzgerald  or gertrude stein 
or salvador dalí 
yeah  except that they ve been dead for years 
no  no  the past is not dead 
actually  it s not even past 
you know who said that 
faulkner  and he was right 
and i met him  too 
i ran into him at a dinner party 
  you re a raving lunatic 
  no  i m not 
  yes  you are 
  no  i m too trusting 
i m jealous 
and i m trusting 
it s cognitive dissonance 
  scott fitzgerald talked about it 
  gil  gil 
inez  you can fool me 
but you cannot fool hemingway 
  i know 
  jesus christ  i m dealing with a madman here 
ok  yes  i did 
i was with paul for a few nights 
because he s romantic 
and he speaks french 
and you were always working  and maybe it s
the mystique of this corny city  but   
get over it  gil 
you just put this in perspective
when we get home 
i m not   i m not going back 
  i m sorry  what 
  i m staying here  and it has nothing to do with 
you know  your romantic fling 
paris is paris 
inez  you and i  it s obvious we re not   
i don t think we re right for each other 
what 
what are you saying 
what are you even talking about 
  you ready to go swimming 
  hi 
we re breaking up 
  what 
  yeah  gil s moving to paris 
  i knew it  i told you 
  what s going on 
no  no  i m going to stay in paris  but
just because we re   
if i m unhappy  i ll move back 
but for the time being  yes 
w   w   with who    
with who  gil 
  no one  i   
  one of your crazy hallucinatory friends 
i mean  mom s right about you 
you have this part missing 
yeah  i said that first 
anyone whose protagonist
makes a living
selling old cap pistols
and joan crawford cutout books   
  honestly   
  look  i m not trying to be
a martyr  but i think
you ll be better off without me 
  i really do 
  but we would 
  i can t believe you re moving 
  go ahead  go ahead 
walk the streets  gush over the
parisian light and the rooftops 
goodbye  inez 
  say hi to trotsky 
  yeah 
  unbelievable 
  you know  i had   
a private detective follow him 
i knew he was up to no good 
  you did 
  you bet i did 
he saw him get into a car
at midnight every night 
and he followed him very closely 
  and what happened 
  i don t know 
the detective agency says
the detective is missing 
à qui dois je l honneur 
 to whom do i owe the honor  
je   je suis perdu 
 i   i m lost  
j ai detournée la mauvaise endroit 
 i made a wrong turn  
gardes  gardes 
 guards  guards  
lui coupe la tête

i was just out for a walk 
yeah  i m actually   i decided 
i m moving to paris 
  really  wow  i m sure you will love it 
  yeah 
  yeah  you think so 
  yeah 
you know  i thought about
you the other day 
  really 
  yeah  because
my boss got a whole
new album of cole porter songs 
that made you think about me 
i like to be thought of that way 
you re on your way home right now 
yes 
can i walk with you 
or  i ll buy you a cup of coffee 
oh  ok  now it s starting to rain 
no  but that s ok 
i don t mind getting wet 
  really 
  yeah 
actually  paris is the most beautiful in the rain 
i feel that s what
i m always saying 
i couldn t agree more with you
