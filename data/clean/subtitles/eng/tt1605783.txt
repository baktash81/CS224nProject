there never was
you act like youve never been here before
i dont get here often enough
thats the problem
can you picture how dropdead
gorgeous this city is in the rain
imagine this town in the 20s
paris in the 20s
in the rain the artists and writers
why does every city have to be in the rain
whats wonderful about getting wet
i mean could you ever picture us
moving here after were married
oh god no
i could never live out of the united states
you know if id stayed here and written novels
and not gotten you know caught up in that
just grinding out movie scripts
ill tell you something
i would drop the house in beverly hills
the pool everything
in a second
i mean look
this is where monet lived and painted
were 30 minutes from town
imagine the two of us settling here
we could do it i mean
if my book turns out
youre in love with a fantasy
im in love with you
we should get back to town
were meeting mom and dad for dinner
lets meet em
there are our sightseers
if i never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again i
what a town
yes to visit
i could see myself living here
i feel like the parisians kind of get me
i can see myself just strolling
along the left bank with a
you know baguette under my arm
headed to café de flore
to scribble away on my book
what did hemingway say
he called it a moveable feast
in this traffic nothing moves
well a toast to johns new business venture here
cheers
cheers
congratulations
thank you
well ill be perfectly frank
im excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the french company but otherwise
im not a big francophile
john hates their politics
certainly been no friend to the united states
well i mean you cant exactly blame them
for not following us down that rabbits hole in iraq
the whole bush you know
oh please lets not get into this
bad discussion again and again
honey honey were not getting into by the way its
fine for your father and i to disagree
thats what a democracy is
your father defends the rightwing of the republican party
and i happen to think you almost got to be
like a demented lunatic but its like
okay okay
but it doesnt mean we dont
respect each others views am i right
can we talk about the wedding plans
yes please
lets do that
your father is just
inez
huh carol
hi
oh my g what are you doing here
nice to see you hi
hey
how are you
good thanks
paul and carol bates this is my mother
and father and of course you know gail
hi very nice to meet you
well you you didnt mention
you were going to be here
no it was sudden um
paul got invited to lecture at
the sorbonesic sorbonne
oh how wonderful
well uh dads here on business
and we just decided to
freeload along  yes
oh
thats great we can spend some time together
well i think we have a
lot of commitments but im sure its
what
well what are doing tomorrow
were driving to verrsailles sic
versailles
versailles
oh
im dying to see versailles
yeah
but its toouh
were latei think what were
tomorrow were locked in
to a lunch at brasserie lipp
oh no thats just
yeah yeah we are thats already
you know i actually had
a professor that dined there
and saw james joyce
yeah you know like a
million years ago and
apparently joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters
is that
thats the end of the story
well i mean its not a story
its like a detailed
we would love to go to versailles yes
oh good
i hope youre not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at versailles
how was i antisocial
oh please
i mean you could totally tell you didnt want to go
well i mean theyre your
friends and i have to admit
im not quite as taken with them as you are
hes brilliant
you know i had such a crush on him
in college and carols very bright
well hes a pseudointellectual
just a little bit
uh gil
i hardly think hed be lecturing at
the sorbonne if hes a pseudointellectual
you should give him your book to read
oh come on why
no because he could critique your writing
and maybe show you why youre
having so much trouble
im having trouble because
im a hollywood hack
who never gave actual
literature a real shot
until now
pleasegil
honey just promise me something
if this bookdoesnt pan out
that youll stop
eating your brains out
and just go back to doing
what you do best
i mean the studios adore you
youre in demand
do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle
well
mmm
mmm
why would youwant to do that
i believe louis moved his court here
uh in 1682
originally all this was swampland
in fact if im not mistaken
uh in old french the word versailles
means uh something like
terrain were the weeds have been pulled
is that right
uh the uh middle section here
uh is uh french classical style at its height
uh the work i believe of
uh louis vau louis le vau
yes
uhmansarti think
manzard sic
and charles le brun i believe
yes thats right
i could get used to a summer home like this
i know you could
me too
except remember in those days
they only had baths
and im definitely a shower man
where are you two planning on
moving after you get married
uhmalibu
really
were thinking about malibu yeah
im pushing for a little
attic in paris with a skylight
la bowhem sic
yeah
all thats missing is the tuberculosis
exactly thank you
i mean you know the problem
is that hes not exactly sure
he can write a novel
really
well
i mean honey so far your track records you know and
well everyone loves your movies
yeah well scripts are easier so
wow
why dont you tell them about the lead
character that youre working on right now
yes   oh come on
i dont like to discuss my work
well dear you dont have to tell
them the whole plot just the character
no no no
okay
he works in a nostalgia shop
whats a whats a nostalgia shop
oh not one of those stores where they sell
shirley temple dolls and old radios
and i never know who buys that stuff whod want it
exactly
i dont know
well people who live in the past
people who think that
their lives would be happier
if they lived in an earlier time
and just which era
would you have preferred
to live in miniver cheevy
paris in the 20s in the rain
wouldnt have been bad
and the rain was an acid rain
oh i see and no global warming
no tv and suicide bombing
and nuclear weapons drug cartels
usual menu of clichéd horror stories
you know nostalgia is denial
denial of the painful present
oh whoa
gil is a complete romantic
i mean he would be
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial
really
and the name for this fallacy
is called goldenage thinking
touché
yeah the erroneous notion that
a different time period is better
than the one ones living in
its a flaw in the romantic
imagination of those people who
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive
yes
this is the nicest ring we saw
diamonds for a wedding band
thats the way youd have to go
and then everyone will see
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger
oh inez its gonna be such an event
i only wish that
i dont want to keep going over it
its your choice what can i say
gil is hes smart
and hes very successful
he talks about giving that all up and moving here
oh yeah he talks about it
well that frightens me
this is of course rodins most famous statue
a cast of this work was placed next to his tomb
rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph
is that true
it would be in moudon he died of the flu
if im not mistaken in 1917 i believe
very good sir
hes so knowledgeable isnt he
yeah so much of rodins work was influenced by his wife camille
yes she was an influence though
camille was not the wife but his mistress
camille no
yes
yes rose was the wife
no he was never married to rose
yes he did marry rose
in the last year their lives
i think youre mistaken
are you arguing with the guide
yes i am
yeah no im certain monsieur
yeah actually shes right
i recently read a twovolume
biography on rodin and
rose was definitely the wife
camille the mistress
yeah you read that where did you
yeah i just read it  i was surprised
because i mistakenly thought like you that it was yeah
the other way around
its an easy mistake
so dad invited you guys for a winetasting
oh itll be so french
yeah yeah
paul is an expert on french wine
youre joking really
yes of course
when did you read the biography on rodin
me why would i read
a biography on rodin
i will always take a california wine but
napa valleys 6000 miles away
john old boy how are you buddy
oh hey whatre you doing here
come on i cant stand that guy
umhow bout
we try some more wine
yes lets start here
now which would you prefer here
well i think we need to be scientific and just
start drinking them all again i dont know
why are your cheeks so red
what do you mean
theyre not red
theyre bright red
oh maybe its because of the
pheromones that youre giving off
these pheromones are driving me mad
stop it stop
ahh sex and alcohol
yeah
it fuels the desire
but kills the performance
according to the bard
have you tasted the 61
it is divine
though paul picked it out i didnt
what
whats happening whats happening
slightly more tannic than the 59
and i prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling
so carol carol and i
are gonna go dancing
we heard of a great place interested
no i dont want to be a killjoy
come on
but i need to get a little fresh air
oh come on come on
although if youre just gonna sit there and obsess
over where the fire exits are then
hey if gil doesnt want to go
ill share paul with you
i am very democratic
and paul is a marvelous dancer
if its ok with you
i think i just want to take a little walk
go to bed and then well do it another night
ok alright well i can go though right
you want to go
well yeah
yeah i mean im not tired
and ive been dying to go dancing
and ill just meet you back at the hotel
ill take good care of her
ok
ill get a cab taxi
ok but you should take a cab
no im not taking a cab  im walking
no youll get lost
ok im gonna walk
is he a good writer
i mean have you read his prose
well he wont let anybody
he wont let
oh look i mean if he wants id be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him
that would be great
would you
you know i think thats what he needs
yeah
well it helps
to have it read by someone yeah
and you wouldnt pull any punches
well i certainly wont be letting
you know i wont do that
no
i do that about you
see but the problem is
when it comes to his writing
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody elses opinion

gilgil pender
gil pender
hemingway
hemingway
you liked my book
liked i loved
all your work
yes it was a good book
because it was an honest book
and thats what war does to men
and theres nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud
unless you die gracefully
and then its not only noble but brave
did you read my story
whatd you think
there was some fine writing in it
but it was unfulfilled
i mightve known youd hate it
but darling youre too sensitive
you liked my story but he hates me
please old sport
you make matters extremely difficult
im jumpy  suddenly i dont like
the atmosphere here any more
ah wherere you going
para reunirse con mis amigos en saintgermain
to meet some friends on saintgermain
hes going to saintgermain im going with him
zelda sweetheart
if youre going to stay here and drink
with him im going with the toreador
would you bring her back
at a reasonable time
shell drive you crazy this woman
shes exciting
and she has talent
this month its writing
last month it was something else
youre a writer you need time to write
not all this fooling around
shes wasting you because shes
really a competitor dont you agree
me
speak up for christs sake im asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake
actually i dont know the fitzgeralds that well
youre a writer you make observations
you were with them all night
could we not discuss my personal life in public
shes jealous of his gift
and its a fine gift its rare
you like his work you can speak for it
stop it stop it
you like mark twain
im going to find zelda
i dont like the thought
of her with that spaniard
may i
yeah im actually a huge mark twain fan
i think you can even make the case
that all modern american literature
comes from huckleberry finn
you box
no not really no
whatre you writing
a novel
bout what
its about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop
what the hell is a nostalgia shop
a place where they sell old things memorabilia
and does that sound terrible
no subject is terrible if the story is true
if the prose is clean and honest
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure
no good
can i ask you the biggest favor in the world
what is it
would you read it
your novel
yeah its like
400 pages long and im just
looking for you know an opinion
my opinion is i hate it
i mean you havent even read it
if its bad ill hate it
because i hate bad writing
and if its good ill be envious and hate it all the more
you dont want the opinion of another writer
yeah you know its just
you know what it is
im having a hard time
you know trusting somebody to evaluate it
writers are competitive
im not gonna be competitive with you
youre too selfeffacing
its not manly
if youre a writer
declare yourself the best writer
but youre not as long as im around
unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it
no i dont
hey im not gonna read your novel
but ill tell you what ill do
yes
ill bring it to gertrude steins
shes the only one i trust with my writing
youll show my novel to gertrude stein

ok we never said where
we were gonna meet
good thing you didnt go last night
you wouldve hated the music and the crowd
but i had fun
whatre you thinking about
you seem like youre in a daze
if i was to tell you that i spent
last night with ernest hemingway
and scott fitzgerald
what would you say
is that what you were dreaming about
your literary idols
yeah but if i wasnt dreaming
what does that mean
if i was with hemingway
and fitzgerald
and cole porter
id be thinking brain tumor
and when i tell you
zelda fitzgerald is exactly
as weve come to know her through
everything weve read in books and articles
you know charming but all over the map
you know she does not like
hemingway one bit
and scott knows hemingway is right about her
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her
come on get up we should
quit the idle chatter
because were gonna be late
you know im not gonna
i think im gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel
cause theres a little polishing i wanna do
no you can do that later

well you get what you pay for

i dont understand
where are we going
but you made us rush through dinner
and dad wasnt finished with his profiteroles
profiteroles youre going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life
where
just inez please
why are you carrying that manuscript around
youll see and when you do
your jaw is gonna drop
ok you know i wouldnt hide anything
so if im saying its incredible
its
ok
its just i dont understand
i know youve been wondering why ive been acting strange all day
yeah
well youre about to find out
and youre gonna wonder why i wasnt
acting more strange when you find out
this is very
i know i know
well i dont know what youre carrying on about
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure
i am tired from the gym and a massage
so im gonna get this cab
taxi
inez wait
lets just wait a little longer
look
you want to walk the streets of paris
and take it in by night
thats fine you go ahead
but im in the middle of a great book that carol lent me
come on just 10 more minutes
and then we can walk home
if im asleep when you get in
dont wake me up
what am i doing wrong
unless shes right
and i need to see a neurologist
ok you left the winetasting a little drunk
but not out of control
lost you walk along
this is the spot
i mean its just like a oneshot deal
the clock struck midnight
hello
oh hi mr hemingway here
let me just jump in
the assignment was to take the hill
there were 4 of us
5 if you counted vicente but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off
and couldnt fight as he could when i first met him
and he was young and brave
and the hill was soggy from days of rain
and the hill sloped down toward a road
and there were many german soldiers on the road
and the idea was to aim for the first group
and if our aim was true we could delay them
were you scared
of what
getting killed
youll never write well
if youre afraid of dying
do you
yeah i do id say its probably
maybe my greatest fear actually
well thats something all men before
you have done all men will do
i know i know
have you ever made love to a truly great woman
actually my fiancée is pretty sexy
and when you make love to her
you feel true and beautiful
passion and you for at least that moment
lose your fear of death
no that doesnt happen
i believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death
all cowardice comes from not loving
or not loving well which is the same thing
and when the man who is brave and true
looks death squarely in the face
like some rhinohunters i know
or belmonte whos truly brave
it is because they love with sufficient
passion to push death out of their minds
until it returns as it does to all men
and then you must make really good love again
think about it
alice how the hell are you
hi
good good ah shes here follow me
non je ne suis pas daccordno i dont agree
mais pourquoi but why
parceque because
this is gil pender miss stein
hes a young american writer
i thought you two should know each other
im glad youre here
you can help decide which of us is right
and which of us is wrong
i was just telling pablo that
this portrait doesnt capture adriana
it has a universality but no objectivity
non non non vous ne le comprenez pas correctement
no no no you dont understand correctly
connaisez pas adriana regardez
you dont know adriana look
regardez le mouvement le tableau
look at the motion the painting
cest exactement ce quelle représente
its exactly what she represents
non tu nas pas raisonno youre wrong
look how hes done her
dripping with sexual innuendo
carnal to the point of smoldering
and yes shes beautiful but
its a subtle beauty
an implied sensuality
i mean what is your first
impression of adriana
exceptionally lovely
belle mais trop subtile plus implicite pablo
beautiful but too subtle more defined pablo
yes youre right miss stein
courseuh
you can see why hes lost all objectivity
hes made a creature of place pigalle
a whore with volcanic appetites
non non cest ce quelle vraiment si vous la connaissez
no no its true if you know her
yes avec toi au privé
yes with you in private
because shes your lover
but we dont know her that way
so you make a petitbourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure
its more like a stilllife than a portrait
non
non non je ne suis pas daccord
no no i do not agree
and whats this book of
yours ive been hearing about
is this it
yeah this isuh
ill take a look
have you read it hemingway
no this i leave to you
youve always been a fine judge of my work
out of the past was the name of the store
and its products consisted of memories
what was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation
had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years
to a status at once magical and also camp
i love it
im already hooked
hooked
ill start it tonight
but first you and i
have something to talk about
ive been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor
i sent him the piece you and i
looked at plus four others
plus four shorter pieces
and this guy i gave him a copy of the
nevertheless two months nary a word
right
so were you really hooked
with those opening lines
oh the past has always had a
great charisma for me
oh me too
great charisma for me
i always say that i was born too late
mmm moi aussi
mmm me too
for me la belle époque paris
would have been perfect
really better than now
yes
another whole sensibility
the street lamps the kiosques
thehorse and carriages
and maxims then
you speak very good english
no not really
no you do
how long have you been dating picasso
my god did i just say that
pardon
i dont mean toi didnt mean to pry
were you born in paris
i was born in bordeaux
i moved here to study fashion
but you dont want to hear all this
yes i do
yes continue
you moved here to study fashion
icame here to study with coco chanel
and i fell in love with paris
and also
a very darkeyed haunted
jewishitalian painter
and i knew amedeo had another woman but still
i couldnt resist moving into his apartment when he asked
and it was a beautiful six months
mmmodigliani
you lived with
you lived with modigliani
you asked me
so im telling you my sad story
with braque though there was another woman
many
and now
with pablo
i mean hes married
but
every day its onagain offagain
i dont know how any woman
can stay with him hes so difficult
my god you take art groupie
to a whole new level
pardon
nothing i was just saying that
but tell me about yourself
what well what can i say
so have you come to paris to write
because you know
these days so many americans
feel the need to move here
isnt hemingway attractive
i love his writing
i know actually im just here visiting
oh you must stay here
really
yeah its a wonderful city for
writers artists
i know id like to but its not that easy
and
i didnt fall in love madly with your book
really
so i want to hear the rest of it
you really like because im still kind of tinkering
pender
yeah lets go up to montmartre lets get a drink ok
uhyeah
ill discuss your book with you as soon as ive finished it
where can i reach you
why dont i drop back by instead of you
trying to find me if thats all right
we run an open house
are you coming with us
i wish that i could
i cant but
hopefully ill see you again eventually
that would be nice
lets go
one of these days i plan to steal you away from this genius
whos great but hes no miró
im gil pender
i was with hemingway and picasso
pablo picasso and ernest hemingway
im gil pender from pasadena
cub scouts i failed freshman english
little old gil pender has his novel
with gertrude stein
boy that girl was so
lovely
well its a shame you two didnt
come to the movies with us last night
we saw a wonderfully
funny american film
who was in it
oh i dont know
i forget the name
wonderful but forgettable
that sounds like a picture ive seen
i probably wrote it
well i know it was moronic and infantile and
utterly lacking in any wit or believability
but john and i laughed in spite of all that
have we been down this way yet
was it
what time did you get in last night
not that lateuh
i wasuh
im really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively
without the distractions of the day
ill probably end up going on another little
hike tonight
well well see
yeah well see
oh look at those wonderful glass figures
cole porters you do something to me
that simply mystifies me
tell me why should it be
you have the power to hypnotize me
vous aimez
you like
yes very beautiful
oh youre american
yeah
you like cole porter
i do im a big fan
i like to
kind of think im a member
of linda and coles inner circle
im kidding
very pretty lyrics
very amusing
charming
gil
gil hi
yeah yes
yeah we should go
were going now
yeah were meeting paul and carol
at the museum for the private showing
ok yeah right
you know paul happens to be an expert in monet
so youll find it enlightening i think
yeah ok
lets get some culture
the juxtaposition of color is amazing
this man was the real father
of abstract expressionism
i take that back
maybe turner
i mean i love turner
but i just find this
overwhelming
if im not mistaken
it took him 2 years to complete this
he worked out of giverny
where he was frequently
i heard that monet
one of the things that he used to try to
shh im trying to hear paul say it
well he was frequently
visited by caillebotte
an artist who i personally feel was underrated
ah now
heres a superb picasso
if im not mistaken he painted
this marvelous portrait of his
french mistress
madeleine brissou in the 20s
paul im gonna have to
differ with you on this one
really
gil just pay attention
you might learn something
ok well if im not mistaken
this was a failed attempt to capture
a young french girl named adriana
from bordeaux if my art history serves me
who came to paris to study
costume design for the theater
im pretty sure she had an affair
with modigliani then braque
which is how pablo met her
picasso
of course what you dont get
from this portrait
is the subtlety
and her beauty
she was just a knockout
what have you been smoking
id hardly call this picture marvelous
its more of a petitbourgeois statement
on how pablo sees her saw her
hes distracted by the fact
that she was a
absolute volcano in the sack
too rich for me
whered gil run off to
work
been walking around paris you know
the way the citys lit up at night
allegedly inspires him so
but thats ok
because im going dancing with paul
wheres carol
uhshes in bed with a bad oyster
so ill see you guys later
thanks for dinner daddy
bye sweetie
where do you think
gil goes every night
you heard her
he walks and gets ideas
you sound skeptical
no
ive seen what he earns
but sometimes i think hes got a
got a part missing
and i didnt like his remark about
tea party republicans
they are decent
people trying to take back the country
they are not
cryptofascist
airhead zombies
you hear him say that
nevertheless i dont think
your idea of having him followed
is very practical
no
id like to know where he goes every night
well we know one thing
he doesnt go dancing
oh excuse me
is this gentleman bothering you
hello gil
hey how are you
i was hoping wed see you here
what a great party
oh good
its nice to see you here
thank you
oh delfine
gil well catch up with you later ok
sure sure
bon soir madame
good evening madame
what a surprise
it was just a total fluke
i was at gertrude steins
shes almost finished with my novel
and i run into this guy
turns out hes archibald macleish
he says hes on his way over here
come on over oh im not
going to crash the fitzgeralds
but then he said youd be here
you and pablo and
oh pablos home
we had abit of a quarrel
oh no
you look like you were having fun with djuna barnes dancing
oh yeah
wait that was djuna barnes
yeah
wow no wonder she wanted to lead
isnt this a wonderful
place to throw a party
its so great
only the fitzgeralds can do that
i want to show you something come with me
ok
so what about your book
its coming along yeah
look at that
wow
its from the turn of the century
isnt it beautiful
its my favorite era
i love it so much
everything was so perfect
its so nice to see you tonight
i was hoping to
its so nice to see you
voilà ma petite adriana
there she is my little adriana
isnt this little parisian
dream a moveable feast
mark my words
im going to steal you away
from that fugitive from
málaga one way or another
between belmonte and myself
whom would you choose
vous êtes tous deux parfaits
you are both perfect
but he has more courage
he faces death more often and
more directly and if you chose him
id be disappointed but id understand
ella ha elegido pablo
she chose pablo
yes shes chosen picasso
but pablo thinks
women are only to sleep
with or to paint
what about you
i think a woman is equal
to a man in courage
have you ever shot
a charging lion
never
would you like to know
how that feels
i dont think so
you ever hunted
no
you
only for bargains
tomémonos otra copita
lets take another drink
you know its so loud
i wonder if we can go some place
where we can hear ourselves think a little bit
sure bye
who wants a fight
well i hope it was nothing
serious with you and pablo
hes moody and possessive
artists are like children
well you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you
cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever
its so interesting
oh
youre interesting too in a lost way
lost
well i guess i am lost
tell me more about your book
my book is kind of a
you know what
i couldnt care less about my book tonight
i just want to walk around paris with you
i keep forgetting youre just a tourist
thats putting it mildly
i can never decide whether
paris is more beautiful by day or by night
no you cant
you couldnt pick one i mean
i can give you a checkmate
argument for each side
you know i sometimes think
hows anyone gonna come up with a
book or a painting or a
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city
you cant cause like
you look around every
every street every boulevard
is its own special art form
and when you think that in the cold
violent meaningless universe
that paris exists these lights
i mean come on theres nothing
happening on jupiter or neptune
but from way out in space
you can see these lights
the cafés people drinking and singing
i mean for all we know
paris is the hottest spot in the universe
vous êtes un poèteyou are a poet
aw come on
its just youre very kind
but i wouldnt call my babbling poetic
although i was on a pretty good roll there
see anything you like
yeah im ashamed to admit
im attracted to all of them
i like cheap sexy
that makes me shallow
when i was in catholic school
one weekend
my roommate and i
we paid a girl from pigalle
to come and teach us all her tricks
honestly
yeah
wow thats
thatsthats
im going to be thinking about that one
i love walking with you
you look amazing
thank you
god is that who i think it is
what is she doing here
staring into the water
oh my god
zelda what are you doing
please i dont want to live
stop

scott and that beautiful countess
they were it was so obvious
they were whispering about me
and the more they drank
the more he fell in love with her
hescott loves only you
i can tell you that with absolute certainty
no
hes tired of me
youre wrong youre wrong i know
how
trust me i know
sometimes you get a feel for people and i get
my skin hurts
what do you mean
i dont wannai hate the way i look
dont do that
here take this
what is this
its a valium
itll make you feel better
you carry medicine

its thepill of the future
you never said you were getting married
yeah you know
its still a
ways in the future
well good luck with your book and your wedding
thank you
i think youd like inez
she has a
has a very sharp sense of humor and
shes attractive she doesnt say
that we agree on everything but
but the important things
yeah oractually
maybe the small things the
sometimes theres a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things
she wants to live in malibu and
wants me to work in hollywood and
but i will say that we both like
indian food
not all indian food but the
you knowthe pita bread
we both like pita bread
i guess its called naan
i should go
pablo will be missing me

monsieur cest un dommage
sir its a shame
cest un dommage
its a shame
we met earlier tonight
at the party
dalí sí
dalí yes
yes
dalí
i remember
dalí ya
un bouteille de vin rouge
a bottle of red wine
it cant be
yeah
so
un autre verre pour monsieur sil vous plaît
another glass for this man please
i love the language
the french
the waiters no
you like the shape of the rhinoceros
the rhinoceros uh
havent really thought about it
i paint the rhinoceros
i paint you
sí your sad eyes
your big lips melting over the hot sand
with one tear
yes and in your tear
another face
the christs face
yes in the rhinoceros
yeah i mean i probably do look sad im in
a very perplexing situation
diabloluis oye luis
damn luis hey luis
my friends
this señor buñuel
buñuel
sí buñuelandmr man ray
man ray my gosh
how bout that
this is pender pender
pender
yes and i am dalí
dalí yes
you have to remember
pender is in a perplexing situation
it sounds so crazy to say
you guys are going to think im drunk but
i have to tell someone im
from a
a different time another era
the future ok i come
from the 2000th millenium to here
i get in a car and i slide through time
exactly correct
you inhabit two worlds
so far i see nothing strange
why
yeah youre surrealists
but im a normal guy
see in one life
im engaged to marry a woman i love
at least i think i love her
christ i better love her
im marrying her
the rhinoceros makes love
by mounting the female
but
is there a difference
in the beauty between two
rhinoceroses
there is another woman
adriana yes and im
very drawn to her
i find her extremely alluring
the problem is that other men
great artists  geniuses
also find her alluring
and she finds them
so theres that
a man in love with a woman
from a different era
i see a photograph
i see a film
i see an insurmountable problem
i see
a rhinoceros
did you get any work done last night
yeahi just
im starting to think that maybe my
book is too realistic
that im missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of
go crazy and not be so
damn logical
why do you always look so good in the morning
no no no no
we have to get dressed
just for a second
come here ive been working like a demon
i gotta get this stuff done but
i cant resist you any more
youre so fetching in the morning
paul said we have to go to the countryside
you know he said hes taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch
but i mean if you dont want to go
dont go
im not missing it because of you
hello bonjour
hello i have a quick question for you about rodin
hello
ok now i understand
he loved his wife
and he also loved his mistress
yes
but do you think thats possible
to love two women at once
well he loved them both
but in a different way
you know
thats very
thats very french
you guys are way
you knowmuch
more evolved in that department
than we are
do you remember me
i was in the
was in the group that
yes
the group with the pedantic gentleman
pedantic yes
thats a perfect word
here is  his photo
i want to know where
he goes each night
what is your suspicion hm
hes engaged to my daughter
to marry i want to make sure
that shes making the right decision
naturally discretion is paramount
well youve come to the
right place monsieur
monsieur tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman
and report about his whereabouts at night
whoa whoa whoa hey
hey thank you for stopping
gil pender
tom eliot
tom eliot
tom stearns eliot
ts eliot ts eliot
pender
prufrocks like my mantra
ok sorry sorry
listen where i come from
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons
hello ms stein
oh pender
ill get to your book in a moment
i finished it
were just in the middle
of a little personal crisis
oh ok should i come back
i dont want to interrupt
no its no secret
adriana has left pablo
and has flown to africa with hemingway
sabía que tenía obsesión con este fanfarrón
i knew that i had an obsession with that bully
ya hemos hablado de todo esto
we talked about all this
estoy segura de que ella regresará muy devoto
im sure that shell come back very devoted
muy devoto oh he took her hunting kudu
but shell be back to him
the sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
youre trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy
mount kilimanjaro is not paris
what are you saying that he took her to mount kilimanjaro
now about your book
its very unusual indeed
i mean in a way its almost like science fiction
we all fear death
and question our place in the universe
the artists job is not to succumb to despair
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence
you have a clear and lively voice
dont be such a defeatist
tell gil to bring his suit cause were
going to be dining formal tomorrow night
i forgot to tell you actually
gil isnt coming to mont saintmichel
why not
i dont understand it
because he writes
he rewrites
he rewrites the rewrites you know
he says picasso never left his studio
i said gil you have absolutely
nothing in common with picasso
he just looks at me
well hes gonna miss a great weekend
cole porters lets do it lets fall in love
and thats why birds do it
bees do it
even educated fleas do it
lets do it
lets fall in love
in spain the best uppersets do it
lithuanians and letts do it
you have any cole porter
hi
hey
i remember you
yeah
he was your friend
cole porter yeah
and dont forget about linda
she was a friend too
you realize i was kidding
yeah i did realize
youre a bit young
yeah you seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work
its because he wrote
many songs about paris
yeah what was the story it was like he was
in love with your hometown or something
are you a parisian
yes monsieur
yes monsieur feel free to call me gil
what do i owe you
for this
dixhuit euros 18
ok
oysters down in oyster bay do it
lets do it
lets fall in love
cold cape cod clams
gainst their wish do it
even lazy jellyfish do it
lets do it lets fall in love
can you translate this
do you speak any english
ok alright thank you
that paris exists
and anyone could choose to live
anywhere else in the world
will always be a mystery to me
dinner withdinner with pablo

pablo is the greater artist
but matisse is the greater painter
paris in the summer

to sit opposite ones
lover at maxims in its
in itsumbest time

writer i just met
named gil pender
that immediate magic one hears
about happened to me
i know that both picasso and
hemingway are in love with me
but for whateverinexplicable
inexplicablereasonthe heart has
yes yes
i am drawn by gil
perhaps because he seems naïve and unassuming
as always in this sad life
hes about to marry a woman named inez
i had a dream where he came to me
and brought me a little gift
earrings they were
and we made love
earrings
earrings
whoa oh my god

shh inez no
could you call the house detective
send him up thank you
this is turning into a witch hunt
you dont do this to people
yes you do
if theyve stolen
i didnt like that maid
i didnt like her from the beginning
she was sweet she was pleasant
she was upbeat
you always take the
side of the help as usual
thats why daddy says youre a communist
bon soir good evening
im doctor gérard
do you want some more water
im fine
hes had angioplasty
i didnt need it
look are these them
i dont know
where did you find them
they were just in the bathroom
in the bathroom
yeah on the sink
what the hell were they
doing in the bathroom
i dont know
they were just
but maybe you dropped them and
when you were putting them away
and the housekeeper mustve picked them up
and placed them there out in
the open where we could see them easily
that was really thoughtful of her
i didnt drop them
i wouldnt drop them
the important thing is
theyre not stolen
cest lun de vos meilleurs jusquau présent
its one of your best until now
jai parlé à leo je pense quil va lacheter
i talked to leo i think that hell buy it
oh pender
i was just telling matisse
were going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection
i think 500 francs is fair
500 francs for a matisse
yeah i think that sounds fair
you know i was wondering if
maybe i could pick up 6 or 7
what have we got here
yeah oh
ok now ive brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book
and if you could just tell me if im
heading in the right direction id really appreciate it
leave it with me
ok great
and have you heard from hemingway
oh theyve been back for days now
the trip didnt work out
i knew they wouldnt hit it off
its over with picasso too
shes at deyrolle by herself
by herself
oh one of those crazy
surrealist painters is getting married
theyre doing it up there
shell be glad to see you
eh bien mes chers amies je propose de porter un toast
well my dear friends i propose to raise a toast to
oh what are you doing here
i came to find you
you did
yeah maybe this is coming out of left field but
lets just say as a writer
im pretty good at
picking up on vibrations from people
women in particular
i sense that there are
some complicated feelings maybe
that you have for me
arent you gonna get married
well everythings a little
up in the air right now
i dont know what is gonna happen
is there some place that we
can talk maybe more quiet
sure
come on
oh mr buñuel
i had a nice idea
for a movie for you
yes
a group of people attend a
very formal dinner party at the end of dinner
when they try to leave the room they cant
why not
they just cant seem to exit the door
bbut why
well momento
when theyre forced to stay together
the veneer of civilization
quickly fades away
and what youre left with is
who they really are  animals
but i dont get it
why dont they just
walk out of the room
all im saying is just think about
who knows
maybe when youre shaving one day
itll tickle your fancy
i dont understand
whats holding them in the room
what are you doing
i dont know
i did feel
for a minute there
while i was doing it like i was immortal
but you look so sad
because life is too mysterious
this is the time we live in
everything moves so fast
life is noisy and complicated
ive always been a logical person
ive never
i never acted too crazy
i didnt stay here
when i first came out here
i didnt take a real shot at being a writer
id just kind of be a hired hollywood hand
dont laugh i just want to

this generation is empty
and has no imagination
better to have lived during the
la renaissance
no this is the golden age
non
cest lâge dorits the golden age
pas de tout la renaissance cest beaucoup mieux
not at all the renaissance is much better
questce que vous faites dans la vie

so vous intéresse
so youre interested
ballet costumes
yes
oh my god i
i dont live here
i mean i do but i dont i
its best not to go
into too many details were
were temporarily
passing through
can i speak with you a minute
permitée
may i
enchanté
wow it didnt take
gaugin long to start steaming in
lets never go back to the 20s
what are you talking about
we should stay here
its the start of la belle époque
its the greatest most
beautiful era paris has ever known
yeah but about the 20s
and the charleston
and the fitzgeralds
and the hemingways
i mean i love those guys
but its the present
its dull
dull
its not my present
im from 2010
what do you mean
i dropped in on you the same way
were dropping in on the 1890s
you did
i was trying to escape my present
the same way youre trying to escape yours
to a golden age
surely you dont think
the 20s are a golden age
well yeah to me they are
but im from the 20s and im
telling you the golden age is la belle époque
and look at these guys i mean to them
their golden age was the renaissance
you know theyre trade belle époque
to be painting alongside
titian and michelango
and those guys probably imagined
life was a lot better
when kublai khan was around
you see im having an insight right now
its a minor one but
it explains the anxiety in my dream that i had
what dream
i had a dream the other night where
it was like a nightmare
where i ran out of zithromax
and then i went to the dentist
and he didnt have any novocaine
you see what im saying
these people dont have any antibiotics
what are you talking about
adriana if you stay here
and this becomes your present
then pretty soon youll start
imagining another time was really your
you know was really the golden time
thats what the present is
that its a little unsatisfying
because lifes a little unsatisfying
thats the problem with writers
you are so full of words
but i am more emotional
and im going stay
and live in paris most glorious time
you made a choice to leave
paris once and you regretted it
yeah i did regret it
it was a bad decision
but at least it was a choice
i mean it was a real choice
this way i think is
i dont know crazy
it doesnt really work
if i ever want to write
something worthwhile i have to
you know get rid of my
illusions and then id be
happier in the past
as where i want a home
so
goodbye gil
goodbye
pender i read your rewrite
and youre nicely on the right track
you understood me clearly
if the rest of the book
reads as well when youre done
youll have something of value
that is the best news
i really did listen to you
so im happy to hear that it
you know it seems like im
moving forward
i mean it just means
the world to me that you
hemingway read the chapters too and he thinks
he read it
he thinks its going to be a fine book
but he did have one plot suggestion
whats the suggestion
well he doesnt quite believe
that the protagonist
doesnt see that his fiancée is
having an affair right before his eyes
with
the other character the pedantic one
thats called denial
thank you
youre crazy
paul and i
where did you get such an insane notion
where from ernest hemingway
he figured it out and guess what
it makes perfect sense
gil your brain tumors acting up again
no no
theres nothing crazy about hemingway
or fitzgerald or gertrude stein
or salvador dalí
yeah except that theyve been dead for years
no no the past is not dead
actually its not even past
you know who said that
faulkner and he was right
and i met him too
i ran into him at a dinner party
youre a raving lunatic
no im not
yes you are
no im too trusting
im jealous
and im trusting
its cognitive dissonance
scott fitzgerald talked about it
gil gil
inez you can fool me
but you cannot fool hemingway
i know
jesus christ im dealing with a madman here
ok yes i did
i was with paul for a few nights
because hes romantic
and he speaks french
and you were always working and maybe its
the mystique of this corny city but
get over it gil
you just put this in perspective
when we get home
im notim not going back
im sorry what
im staying here and it has nothing to do with
you know your romantic fling
paris is paris
inez you and i its obvious were not
i dont think were right for each other
what
what are you saying
what are you even talking about
you ready to go swimming
hi
were breaking up
what
yeah gils moving to paris
i knew it i told you
whats going on
no no im going to stay in paris but
just because were
if im unhappy ill move back
but for the time being yes
wwwith who
with who gil
no one i
one of your crazy hallucinatory friends
i mean moms right about you
you have this part missing
yeah i said that first
anyone whose protagonist
makes a living
selling old cap pistols
and joan crawford cutout books
honestly
look im not trying to be
a martyr but i think
youll be better off without me
i really do
but we would
i cant believe youre moving
go ahead go ahead
walk the streets gush over the
parisian light and the rooftops
goodbye inez
say hi to trotsky
yeah
unbelievable
you know i had
a private detective follow him
i knew he was up to no good
you did
you bet i did
he saw him get into a car
at midnight every night
and he followed him very closely
and what happened
