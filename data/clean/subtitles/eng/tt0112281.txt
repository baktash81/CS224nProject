the wachati are a peaceful tribe
since their sacred
animal has vanished
they believe that there is a
curse fallen on their village
it all started some time ago
so the daughter of the wachati chief
is set to wed the first son
of the wachootoo tribe
and the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage
but if it is not recovered
the result will be
the merciless slaughter
of the wachatis

tell me mr ventura
just how good are you
youre an extreme workaholic
you recently returned from a short
trip to gotan in northern africa

took a nasty spill because of some
shoddy masonry work
very impressive might one ask how
surely
inhales
the abrasion on the
palm of your left hand
is the type one sustains
breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet
the small remnants of plaster
on the tip of your shoe
pointed to a careless
mason being the culprit
your new watch a quality forgery of
a cartier was most likely purchased
through the north african black market
known to reside in gotan
inhales
and my work habits
yes a workaholic
the urine stain on your pants would
signify that youre a singleshake man
far too busy for
the followup jiggle
brilliant mr ventura
simply brilliant
spank you greenwall
spank you very much
mr ventura weve been coexisting
quite nicely with the native cultures
for the past 200 years
theyre almost like family at this point
are they
it is imperative that we
recover the sacred animal
if not the peaceable wachatis
will assuredly be obliterated
the wachootoos are bloodthirsty
they consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse

same
only to the untrained eye

oh water tastes good yes
glub glub
ace grunting
this isnt over yet
theres something ive missed
some clue ive overlooked
some motive and that motive is
pluh think
somebody wants these two
tribes to destroy each other
there must be something
valuable in this equation
perhaps we should
meditate upon it spike
for it is said that when
seeking answers one must
quiet the soul in order to hear them
what is it the wachatis possess
that is of great value to other men
besides the princess
with the amazing rack
inhales
humming
alrighty then
chanting continues
alrighty then
chanting
oh ace youre back
you can dispense with
the smallpox allknowing one
im here on business
and time is of the essence
very well what answer do you seek
i need to know what it
is the wachatis possess
that is of great value
to civilized man
the medallion will lead
you to the answer
you do still have
the medallion dont you
medallion why surely
i left it back uh with my body
your aura is weakening
ok i threw it in the cave
what do you want from me
what are you mr perfect
you want to know where it is
its probably lying
in a big pile of
gasp
guano
they have guano
like
a glove
hi chief
appreciate your meeting me here
lets go kick some
consulate butt
hello ace
youve come for your money
wrong again sweeney toad
ive come for the sacred bat
where is it
why ace whatever can you mean
guano hello
does poo ring a bell
guano mines as a source of nitrate
producing 84 of the worlds supply
of fertilizer a 14 billion industry
thats what this war is all about
you cant legally take
possession of the caves
as long as the wachatis
inhabit the area
and you want that dookie
so bad you can taste it
but sir i thought that
yes thank you fulton
thats a fine theory mr ventura
what has it got to do with me
i thought youd never ask
inhales
the day i met you there was a white substance
on your shoe that i mistook for plaster
yesterday i saw the same white substance
outside the hut where the bat was kept
and suddenly it hit me the great
white bat has great white guano
thats what you slipped in
thats what was on your shoe
and that explains the
abrasion on your palm
