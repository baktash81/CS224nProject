animal has vanished 
they believe that there is a
curse fallen on their village 
it all started some time ago   
so the daughter of the wachati chief
is set to wed the first son
of the wachootoo tribe 
and the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage 
but if it is not recovered 
the result will be
the merciless slaughter
of the wachatis

shoddy masonry work 
very impressive  might one ask how 
surely 
 inhales 
the abrasion on the
palm of your left hand
is the type one sustains
breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet 
the small remnants of plaster
on the tip of your shoe
pointed to a careless
mason being the culprit 
your new watch  a quality forgery of
a cartier  was most likely purchased
through the north african black market 
known to reside in gotan 
 inhales 
  and my work habits 
  yes  a workaholic 
the urine stain on your pants would
signify that you re a single shake man 
far too busy for
the follow up jiggle

mr  ventura  we ve been coexisting
quite nicely with the native cultures
for the past 200 years

it is imperative that we
recover the sacred animal 
if not  the peaceable wachatis
will assuredly be obliterated 
the wachootoos are bloodthirsty 
they consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse

outside the hut where the bat was kept 
and suddenly it hit me  the great
white bat has great white guano
