to dig out these tunnels 
let s get a rotation in here 
hey  i found something 
iwo jima
hanako   
we soldiers dig 
we dig all day 
this is the hole that we will fight   
and die in 
hanako   
am i digging my own grave 
today  i head for the post
where my men await 
i am determined to serve
and give my life for my country 
i believe i have organized
everything at home   
but i am sorry i wasn  t able to attend
to the kitchen floor before i left 
i had all the intention   
but had to leave
without having the time   
and i am still worried about it 
so make sure to have
taro take care of it promptly 
damn this island 
the americans can have it 
nothing grows here 
it smells  it s hot  there are too many
damn bugs  and there s no water 
this island is part
of japan s sacred homeland 
there s nothing sacred about this island 
saigo 
we should just give the island
to the americans   
and then we can go home 
saigo 
what did you say  soldier 
i said if we beat the americans 
then we can go home 
you there  is that what he said 
yes  sir 
i m kuribayashi 
welcome  general 
i am admiral ohsugi 
how long have you been
waiting here for me 
three hours  sir 
sorry to hear that 
they wouldn t allow me
to wire my arrival   
after what happened
to admiral yamamoto 
i understand  sir 
this is my aide  lieutenant fujita 
what s the matter  admiral 
you don t look very well 
it s nothing  sir  the water
doesn t agree with me here 
sorry to hear that 
this way to your quarters 
admiral  i want to make a round
of the island first 
shall i fetch a vehicle 
no  let s walk 
walking is good for the health 
it might be just what you need  ohsugi 
so that s suribachi 
you unpatriotic   
no good peasants 
hey  stop it 
stand up 
what are you doing 
these soldiers   
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words  sir 
i see 
and  captain  do you have
such an excess of soldiers   
that you could put two
of them out of commission 
no  sir 
then stop beating them 
deny their lunch rations instead 
a good captain uses his brain 
not just his whip 
what is all this 
all this 
trenches  sir 
why are the men digging trenches here 
this is where the americans
are expected to land 
have them stop immediately 
but  general   
and  captain   
make sure these men get proper breaks 
they look like they re from mars 
stop digging 
just as well 
my stomach has been
bothering me anyway 
a toast to general kuribayashi   
a fine commander 
better than sake 
i heard he lived in america 
maybe that s why he
doesn t want us digging trenches 
maybe he likes americans 
no  stupid 
he studied the americans 
so now he knows how to beat them 
i heard from someone in the 204th   
that another general was
supposed to command the island   
but he didn t want the job 
so premier tojo gave it
to kuribayashi instead 
nozaki  you hear a lot of things   
but your ears are full of wax 
anyway  you can t trust anyone
from the 204th 
they re part of the navy 
i think this kuribayashi
must be a superb general 
look   
we re not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore  are we 
this heat is more than i had anticipated 
this island is bigger than i thought 
i m exhausted 
ito  reporting for duty 
thank you for coming right away 
how much air force
do we have available 
41 zekes and 13 bombers  sir 
is that all 
in order to support saipan 
we lost 66 planes a few days ago 
we will have to rely on support
from the combined fleet then 
is this the current defense plan 
and what about the army troops 
where will they be stationed 
i don t know exactly 
they are under independent
command of colonel adachi 
you have not coordinated
your plans with the army 
according to navy rules 
until the enemy lands   
this is a real war 
you are aware of that  aren t you 
this will not work 
you are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches 
  move the artillery to higher ground 
  but  sir  we just had them   
moved down to the beaches 
well  move them back 
coordinate with the army
and have them start immediately 
fortifications at suribachi are the priority 
i m going to walk some more 
  it s pitch black out there  sir 
  i know 
this one is trouble 
army commanders usually are  sir 
another letter 
you know that the mail only goes out
when there s a boat available 
i have a lot of family 
then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife 
nosey 
here  let me do you a favor 
otherwise  your letters
will never make it through 
hey  what are you doing 
i used to work at the censorship office
in tokyo before i was transferred 
you mean demoted 
 to hanako  we soldiers dig 
we dig all day  
no  no  no  this will never pass 
give me that back 
there  you ll thank me
for this later  saigo 
next 
good 
are you blind 
can t you see the target 
even my six year old could
shoot better than you do 
do it again 
you re an embarrassment 
you call yourself an imperial soldier 
tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop 
go to the rear 
they should learn to clean their guns
properly  rather than their boots 
what are those tanks doing here 
those are out of commission  sir 
they are waiting for parts 
  for how long 
  about a month  sir 
taro  america is filled with cars 
i have to be very careful
when i cross the street   
there are so many cars everywhere 
taro  are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother 
i miss you 
these civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible 
yes  sir 
hanako   
we have a celebrity here 
baron nishi  the olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping 
he will lead the 26th tank regiment   
and has just arrived from tokyo 
nishi is very handsome  and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills 
but there are no women
left on the island to woo 
lieutenant colonel nishi 
you brought your horse 
from chichi jima 
i used to be a cavalryman myself 
you know 
of course  i know 
i ve been looking forward
to serving under you 
one who understands horses
the way i do 
when we used to ride horses
through the battlefield   
those were the good old days   
not like these mechanized contraptions 
i could send for another horse   
and we could ride together 
i m afraid my riding days are over 
but tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the olympics with 
my stallion  uranus 
oh  yes  this horse has a fine back 
i bought him in italy 
they were happy to get rid of him 
he was such a wild horse 
no one could tame the beast 
but i told them   
such a headstrong horse   
is a perfect match for me 
come dine with me tonight 
i feel like having a drink 
i think that can be arranged 
how did you manage to get
the johnnie walker 
i drank some already 
i m sorry  this is all we have 
that s fine  as long as we have this 
what is this empty plate 
i have told our cook that all officers   
will have the same rations
and food as our men 
i m sorry  but serving three dishes
is regulation 
oh  but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal 
you re absolutely right 
when you think about it   
it is regrettable that most of the
combined fleet was destroyed 
we still have some battleships left   
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea 
nishi  what do you mean 
so you have not heard about
the mariana battle 
admiral ozawa s carrier and boat planes
were destroyed 
the imperial headquarters   
is deceiving not just the people 
but us as well 
if you want my honest opinion  general   
the best thing to do   
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea 
and yet  you still came 
well   
i figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that i could bring 
this must be it 
yes  the enemy must land here 
run 
like you were one of the americans 
go on  which direction would you take 
hey   
i think your general has gone mad 
look at the gun he has 
he probably took it
from a dead american 
maybe 
break time is over 
back to work 
are you all right  kashiwara 
you look pale 
i m fine  it s just the damn water 
but    i    really    need to go 
there will be a major change
in our strategy 
we will dig caves in the motoyama 
higashiyama  and suribachi yama areas 
we will build these underground
fortifications  and fight to the end 
  what about the beach defenses  sir 
  not needed 
but  sir  the beach trenches
are our first line of defense 
without the beach trenches 
how do you expect us to win 
hayashi  do you know how many cars
america produces in a year 
five million 
the americans  technological
advancements cannot be underestimated 
they will cross the beaches eventually 
if we waste our soldiers there 
there is no hope for victory 
it is inevitable that men will die   
but i never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications 
general  it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now 
we should force the enemy
near the island   
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air 
i agree  that makes the most sense 
ohsugi   
doesn t the navy know 
the combined fleet has been completely
destroyed off the marianas 
the island is now isolated 
what s more  i received a new order from
the imperial headquarters this morning 
the remaining fighter planes
are to be sent back   
to tokyo to defend the mainland 
outrageous  how are we to fight 
we do not have time for discussion 
we should head back 
dear mother   
i have been commissioned
to a new troop today 
i cannot talk about this transfer now 
take good care of yourself 
look at this picture 
that s some fancy castle 
you know who this castle was built for 
someone who was already dead 
they must have had
a lot of money back then   
to build a castle like that
for a dead person 
why are you reading that book anyway 
we re never going to war over there 
we ll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we re dead 
don t talk about that  it s bad luck 
is this the 312th 
that s right 
i m nozaki  this is saigo 
shimizu  you can put your bedroll there 
there s an empty space in the back 
don t mind him 
his friend kashiwara just died 
that used to be his spot 
but we are all going to die 
that s the plan  isn t it 
for our country  it is an honor 
kashiwara died of honorable dysentery 
shimizu  where are you from 
kanagawa ken 
ozawa is from there  aren t you 
that s right 
where were you trained 
maybe we were at the same school 
no 
i trained in tokyo 
i trained in tokyo  too  where 
the koho kimmu yoin yoseijo 
hey   
why do you think they put
a kempeitai in our unit 
i don t know 
he s not wearing the white armband 
he s not kempeitai 
he went to the kempeitai
military academy 
maybe he was kicked out 
he acts like a kempeitai 
look at his holster 
that s not standard issue 
he s been put here to spy on us 
why would he spy on us 
maybe it s those letters
you ve been writing 
you should be careful 
weed soup again 
kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle 
we ll be dead
before the americans even get here 
and you would think that with all my
war effort contributions   
we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches 
what 
i ran a bakery in ohmiya with my wife 
back when we could still get sugar   
we sold ampan and kasutera cakes 
however  his kempeitai brethren   
used to come and take
whatever they wanted 
for the war   
for the country   
why bread 
we ran into those types
at our clothing store as well 
when we started making sandwiches   
they took those  too 
and when we ran out of meat
and just had bread  they still came 
eventually  they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal   
and we were out of business 
i should have been a fisherman 
it must have been hard on your wife   
without the shop
and without her husband 
tell them to go away 
we have nothing to sell 
congratulations  your husband
is going to war 
thank you very much 
i m happy to serve the country 
prayers for your eternal success at arms 
i beg of you  we have only each other 
this is not the time 
we have all sent our husbands
and sons to war 
we all have to do our part 
at least you ll have a little one
to carry on your name 
i can t eat with you like that 
what am i going to do after you die 
i m not in the coffin yet 
the men never come home 
not even a soul 
they ll never let you come home 
don t worry 
and now  with the baby 
can you hear me 
it s dad 
listen 
don t tell anyone
what i m telling you now 
it s a secret 
your dad   
is going to come home for you 
hurry up 
the enemy approaches 
this is ridiculous 
why waste time digging these tunnels 
they are all going to die anyway 
at least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach 
you wanted to see me  sir 
care for a drink 
you have been looking
quite pale these days 
it s the water  it has
never agreed with me 
that s not good 
why don t you go back
to the mainland to recoup 
i have commissioned admiral ichimaru
to take your place 
we are wasting time
digging these tunnels 
general  the island won t last
five days without fleet support 
we should fight to the death 
the tunnel digging may be futile 
maybe the stand on iwo will be futile 
maybe the whole war is futile 
but will you give up then 
we will defend this island
until we are dead 
until the very last soldier is dead 
if our children can live safely
for one more day   
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island 
ohsugi   
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer   
i beg of you   
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support 
so the rumor is true 
i couldn t believe it 
i m grateful to be leaving this island 
we may have had our differences   
but i m truly sorry to see you go 
general hayashi  it is up to you now 
kuribayashi belongs behind a desk 
not commanding war 
i understand 
there are many of us
who agree with you  sir 
listen 
the americans are likely to land here 
crossfire positions will be here   
here   
and here 
the fact is   
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector 
but we have a great advantage 
can anyone tell me what that is 
the americans are weak willed
and inferior to japanese soldiers 
very good  shimizu 
why is that 
they are not as disciplined   
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty 
that is correct 
here is the uniform
of an american medic 
he should be your target 
for americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one 
understood 
general  may i speak with you 
please keep an eye on
major general hayashi 
thank you for your concern  nishi   
but we don t have any time to waste 
we must think about what
we can do at this moment 
admiral ichimaru 
reporting for duty  sir 
excuse me 
thank you for coming
on such short notice 
jupiter 
jupiter 
yamazaki   
what are you doing just
sitting there  help us   
i think he s writing about us
in his reports 
he s just writing a letter 
it s been two months  nozaki 
he would have reported us by now 
how can you be sure 
will they ever stop 
day and night  day and night   
it s driving me crazy 
if the damn americans
are going to invade   
why don t they hurry up and land 
tako chan   
the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much 
the mother chicken leads them
for food every day   
but they re giving me a hard time  picking
at the vegetable garden i have grown 
the fleet of american ships
has left saipan 
so they are on their way 
ready the troops 
men   
the time has come
to show your true colors 
as a member of the honorable
imperial army   
i trust that you will fight with honor 
this island is of utmost importance
to japan 
should the island fall   
the enemy   
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland 
for the mainland   
for our homeland   
until the very last man 
our duty is to stop the enemy right here 
not one of you   
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers 
do not expect to return home alive 
i will always be in front of you 
long live the emperor 
take care and be well 
i will fight courageously until the end 
in the spirit of yamato 
my heart will always be with you 
takeichi 
every household is assigned a quota
of bag making for the gunpowder 
i cannot help but get tense when i think
that these will be used in battle 
taro and yoko laugh at me for this 
takako  on evacuation in nagano 
is also doing well 
i pray for your safety 
sincerely  yoshi 
no one can shoot me now 
that s a nice belt 
my wife sent me one  too 
doesn t look like mr  kempeitai
has a thousand stitch belt  does he 
maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform 
he probably doesn t believe
in superstitions  anyway 
his mother made him one after all 
  maybe they re trying to sink the island 
  my head hurts 
how many ships do you think
there are out there 
at least 30  maybe even 50 
  they must be really close 
  i need to take a leak 
don t go near the sewers 
dysentery is spreading through there 
where do i go then 
there is a pot at the end of the cave 
the shit pot is full 
someone needs to throw it out 
if anything happens to that pot   
you ll be carrying our shit away
with your hands 
is this some kind of a joke 
why are you always picking on me 
thank you  god  i take back
what i said before 
shall we commence fire 
not yet 
the men wish to commence firing 
hold your fire 
hold your fire 
hold your fire 
they will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist 
wait until the beach is full 
let s go  commence firing 
commence firing 
commence firing 
the guns of the kitakubo unit
were destroyed 
all the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed 
however  all other forces are intact   
and we estimate more than
1 000 enemy casualties 
the pillbox destruction was unavoidable 
overall  that is good news 
how are the men
holding up at suribachi 
forces are intact 
what is the enemy situation 
approximately 20 000 men and 80 tanks 
there has to be more than that 
they still have men waiting in the boats 
currently the enemy front extends   
between suribachi
and the south landing   
and chidori airfield south 
just as i thought    suribachi
and the motoyama airfield 
they are making a two pronged attack 
that s not enough  i need more ammo 
take his place 
  the machine gun is blasted 
  use your rifle 
watch out  imbecile 
i can t rely on you 
go send a report to colonel adachi
that we need another machine gun 
hurry up 
colonel adachi is asking
for reinforcements 
we can t afford to send reinforcements 
tell him to hold out 
shoot him 
  what s the matter 
  we re out of bullets 
we are losing suribachi 
all is lost  request permission
to lead a suicide mission 
no  you must try to hold them off 
do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves 
but  sir   
i have failed to hold suribachi 
permit me to die with honor with
my men 
no  colonel 
this is an order 
adachi 
adachi 
sir  captain tanida
requests machine guns 
it s over 
suicide   
that s the only thing left 
but   
here  take this to your commander 
i heard general kuribayashi
order colonel adachi to escape 
quiet 
escape is the coward s way 
sit down 
men   
we are   
honorable soldiers of the emperor 
don t ever forget that 
the only way left for us   
is to die with honor 
this is our fate   
to find our place at yasukuni shrine 
i ll see you there 
soldiers  farewell 
stop 
you should die like an honorable soldier 
look  shimizu   
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves 
our orders are to stay here until death 
i heard general kuribayashi himself 
that s what he said   
over the radio 
it s true 
we can die here   
or we can continue fighting 
which would better serve the emperor 
which one 
where does this go 
it will take us closer to motoyama 
do you have orders to move back 
where are the rest of your men 
all dead 
it s the same with us 
there should be an outlet
somewhere near here 
be quiet 
so you thought you could blow us up 
or burn us alive  did you 
  have we heard from suribachi 
  no  sir 
send a messenger 
lieutenant oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave 
we will make a run for motoyama 
there is no cover for two kilometers 
it will be every man for himself 
see you on the other side 
if not on this earth 
then in the next world 
don t run with the herd 
that s where the enemy will fire 
stay back 
that s cowardice 
there is no use for a dead soldier 
wait until the flare is gone 
crawl forward 
what happened to the messenger 
he never came back 
i will go to adachi myself 
motoyama s transmitter
still works  general 
why not try there  sir 
sir  these men retreated
from mt  suribachi 
what are your names 
saigo  from the 312th 
shimizu  reporting for duty 
you escaped from suribachi 
how dare you 
it was your duty
to stay in your position until death 
you should have died   
with your fellow troop members 
you are both a disgrace 
get on your knees 
  but  sir   
  i said  get on your knees 
i don t want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly 
put down your sword 
put it down 
what s going on here 
these men ran from suribachi 
lt  ito  i gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves 
i am very sorry  general 
it s just   
suribachi   
has fallen 
now that suribachi has been taken   
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside 
we must move
our command center north  sir 
ito   
fight for your fallen brethren   
until the end 
get up 
major general hayashi
is leading an attack 
we are to join him 
kuribayashi s orders are
to remain in the caves 
lieutenant ito says kuribayashi
is a weak american sympathizer 
we will take back mt  suribachi 
where is major general hayashi 
we don t know  sir 
who is in charge here 
i m not sure 
stay here until
i determine the plan of action 
we re dead 
pull back 
we ll get reinforcements 
why didn t your regiment join the attack 
don t sit here like rats 
come out of your caves and fight 
where is your commander 
we haven t received the order to attack 
didn t you receive the order
from general hayashi 
kuribayashi countermanded
hayashi s order 
there is to be no attack 
we will take back suribachi   
with or without kuribayashi 
there are already troops on the attack 
get your men in order 
lieutenant  may i remind you
of your rank 
your disrespect for senior officers   
puts your men at needless risk 
i suggest you go back to your cave   
or hand over your men 
enough 
we ll do it ourselves 
that s against regulations 
that s the officer who tried to kill us 
he doesn t care 
i won t go back 
i ve had enough of cave fighting 
you men are now under
lieutenant colonel nishi s command 
i will throw myself under an enemy tank 
i will take out one of their machines 
hurry 
what is the status 
a thousand men were lost   
in a night attack along chidori airfield 
why  i have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves 
it seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors 
hayashi 
damn you 
and the american advancement 
a battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge 
good  once they cross the west ridge 
they will be surrounded on three sides 
this just arrived 
read it 
from headquarters   
 we regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to iwo at this time 
we earnestly hope you will
fight honorably   
and die for your country  
bring him in 
bring him in 
shall i finish him off 
no  treat him 
but  sir   
okubo  you would expect the same 
wouldn t you 
endo  treat him 
we are low on morphine as it is 
sir  the americans would not treat
a wounded japanese soldier 
son  have you ever met one 
treat him 
where are you  american tanks 
come and get me 
how is the prisoner doing 
he is awake  sir 
i will question the prisoner
for information 
damn 
i ve had enough of this 
i m going to surrender 
go ahead and arrest me 
i don t care anymore  that s what
you were put here for  isn t it 
to report treasonous thoughts 
i was put here because   
i was discharged from the kempeitai 
discharged 
i had only been in service
for five days 
shimizu   
you must always be firm 
any mercy and people
will take advantage of you 
that s unpatriotic 
go sort it out  shimizu 
you do not have the imperial flag
properly displayed 
i m sorry 
my husband has gone to war
and i couldn t put it up myself 
it is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed 
if you help me  i ll put it up now 
get that dog to shut up 
what was that  sir 
that dog is a nuisance 
it is disruptive of army communications 
i am very sorry  sir 
shimizu  dispose of the dog 
we can t have a dog interfering
with important military commands 
take the dog in the back 
it s only a dog 
it won t happen again 
take it out back 
keep the children inside 
hurry up 
take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet   
and never let him out 
it s taken care of  sir 
are you trying to make a fool out of me 
if you can t even shoot a dog 
you ll never be able to handle the reds 
you are unpatriotic 
i was discharged for insubordination   
and sent here 
don t look so glum  shimizu 
at least now only the enemy hates you 
i don t blame the dog 
taro   
tonight i attended my farewell party 
the wives also attended 
so there was a lot of fuss 
greeting all the ladies   
kept me from enjoying the food 
is there any information
of the enemy s plan 
no  it s just a letter 
it s from his mother 
 sam   
i have mailed you
a couple of books to read 
i hope that you like them 
yesterday   
the dogs dug a hole under the fence 
they ran all over the neighborhood 
by the time we found them   
the harrisons  roosters were terrorized 
don t worry about us 
just take care of yourself
and come back safely 
remember what i said to you   
always do what is right   
because it is right 
i pray for a speedy end to the war   
and your safe return 
love  mom  
i m sorry  sir  there is no more medicine 
it s all right  i m useless now 
go help the others 
okubo  come here 
how are we on ammunition 
not good  sir 
our mortars have been taken out   
and we re out of machine gun ammo 
we have only our rifles 
okubo   
you are now in charge of the men 
we can no longer hold this area 
you must guide
the rest of the men north 
take whatever food and ammo
we have left 
what about you  sir 
i m tired of sharing this cave
with all of you 
i m a one man show from here on out 
what are you talking about  sir 
your first order of business   
is to find some water 
men   
do your best 
do what is right   
because it is right 
understood 
i will make sure that they send you
medicine and food 
it has been a great honor   
to serve   
under you 
hand me my rifle 
i m sorry  okubo 
why am i not getting any reports 
have we heard from admiral ichimaru 
  no  sir 
  what about nishi or hayashi 
  send out messengers 
  we have  many times 
none of them have come back 
you can t plan strategy like this 
i have been thinking about
what lt  colonel nishi said 
he s right 
i don t know anything about the enemy 
i believed that the americans
were cowards   
but they weren t 
i was taught   
that they were savages   
but that american soldier   
his mother s words   
were the same as my mother s 
i want to fulfill my duty
for the general   
and our country   
but i don t want to die for nothing 
what do you think 
you   
haven t lived enough to realize   
what you are sacrificing 
will you surrender with me 
careful 
they ll notice if we leave together 
you go first 
i ll make up an excuse 
after a while  i ll tell them
i m going to check on you 
we ll be gone before they even notice 
pretend that you have dysentery 
give me your dysentery look 
i guess that ll have to do 
where are you going 
i ve got dysentery 
you re going to surrender  aren t you 
if you are  take me with you 
  i ve had enough of this war 
  be quiet 
where are you going 
he said he wasn t feeling well 
it could be dysentery 
you two  stop 
sir  maybe they got spooked 
miura  you re on guard 
make sure we have no more deserters 
what unit were you with 
higashiyama 314th 
did you hear   
i heard that they would give you a meal 
a meal   
that sounds good 
i m from yokohama  too 
after this is over  you can come visit me 
lieutenant 
let this be a lesson to anyone else   
who wants to surrender 
we need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north   
and join our forces at the front 
listen 
we ll head for that cave
and make our way from there 
don t waste a bullet 
not a single one 
don t shoot recklessly 
these are nishi s troops
and the survivors from suribachi 
are there no officers 
you all did a good job making it here 
fujita  water for them 
i m sorry  sir  there is no more water 
i m sorry 
at least you can rest 
you look familiar 
you almost lost your head 
that was the second time you saved me 
the first time   
was the day you landed on the island 
of course  i remember 
well  everything happens in threes 
hanako   
this letter will probably
never get to you   
but   
it comforts me to write 
for five days  we ve been
without water and food 
to survive   
we do unspeakable things 
there is no escape now 
but   
my only concern is for you and the baby 
dig up some worms 
the battle is approaching its end   
and there is no more ammunition 
no more water 
all the survivors will engage
in a general attack 
i pray for the victory
and safety of the empire 
i bid you farewell 
for the country 
i could not fulfill all of my duties 
now that we have no ammunition 
it is with regret that we must perish 
you made it all the way from suribachi 
that must have been quite a journey 
you are quite a soldier 
no  sir 
i m just a simple baker 
you were a baker 
any family 
a wife   
and a baby girl born
last summer in ohmiya 
i haven t met her yet 
it s strange 
i promised myself to fight
until death for my family   
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise 
a radio transmission from the homeland 
for general kuribayashi   
and his troops  who are fighting bravely
for our country   
a song will be sung by the children
of nagano   
which is kuribayashi s hometown 
on the waves of the pacific
down south from the imperial city
a small lonely island floats
the fate of our imperial country
lies in the hands of this island
iwo jima
as long as we stand
we shall feel safe  as the imperial land
shall forever be at peace
we shall fight with pride
and honor at any price
our proud island
iwo jima
do me a favor 
stay here and burn all these documents 
and my military chest 
everything happens in threes 
we will make a general attack 
although japan has lost   
one day   
our people will praise your dedication 
a day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls 
be proud to die for your country 
i will always be in front of you 
no more 
no more 
thank you  fujita 
this is an order 
you again 
i have one more favor to ask of you 
bury me   
so that no one will find me 
taro   
i will be home soon 
i m glad to be going back to japan   
but i m a bit sad
to leave my friends behind 
i drove home   
but
