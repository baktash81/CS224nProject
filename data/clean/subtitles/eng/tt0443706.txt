you need to see this
go get the publisher
dear editor
this is the murderer
of the two teenagers
last christmas at lake herman
and the girl on the fourth of july
near the golf course in vallejo
to prove i killed them
i shall state some facts
which only i and the police know
christmas
brand name of ammo superx
ten shots were fired
the boy was on his back
with his feet to the car
the girl
would you read that please
the girl was on her right side
feet to the west
fourth of july
one girl was
wearing patterned slacks
the boy was also shot in the knee
brand name of ammo was western
here is part of a cipher
the other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to the editors of
the vallejo times and sf examiner
i want you to print this cipher
on the front page of your paper
in this cipher is my identity
if you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of fry
fry first of aug 69
i will go on a kill rampage fry night
i will cruise around all weekend
killing lone people in the night
then move on to kill again
until i end up with
a dozen people over the weekend
its unsigned except for a symbol
is it me
or does that look like a gunsight
todays august first
he wants his code
in the afternoon edition
if the examiner doesnt have
the balls to run it we scoop the bay
al this man is talking about
shooting 12 people
and not running this
might make him do that
if we run it we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent
oh come on now its newsworthy
well giving some sick bastard
a soapbox
what does that say to people
back up is this vallejo story true
do we know that
paul
what i cover crime in vallejo
yeah i cover crime in vallejo
ten minutes
lets shoot the code and call sfpd
if it turns out to be real
at least well have the material
all right
graysmith
dont you have that cartoon to finish
oh yeah
hi this is paul avery
from the san francisco chronicle
im looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received
thank you
sergeant mulanax
sergeant paul avery from
the san francisco chronicle
i just wanted to check
if you had an unsolved
firearmrelated homicide
on christmas and
maybe one on july fourth
shit
you guys got one too
confirmed
vpd they confirmed the shootings
als on the phone with the examiner
they got the same letter
with a different code
so did timesherald
christmas two teenagers
on lovers lane both doa
david faraday and betty jensen
july fourth
darlene ferrin and michael
i think its mayhew
anyway he lived she didnt
the murder weapons
ballistics everything he said
in the letters matched
i mean i think the timesheralds
gonna go with it
the examiners going
but wont go front page
i say lets go front page
if he kills 12 people its not our fault
robert we need the cartoon
youre not finished
no im finished carol im finished
thieriots still here
really
the first edition
is off the floor in 10 charles
give us a sec
okay replate
well go on page page four
what do you say 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psychos name
he wont give his name
mortis anyone
thats where im heading
all right
put those on my desk turn on the light
grab your book
now go get your jammies on
all right people listen up
the ciphers broken into three sections
each with eight lines and 17 symbols
no breaks between the symbols
denoting different words
no numbers or clues
to substitution keys
and you got symbols
from at least seven different sources
greek morse code navy semaphore
weather symbols astrological signs
hey take a gander at this code thing
okay
you wanna give it a go
guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist bob bastian
now hes doing public television
for some reason
paul avery
robert graysmith
ive been here nine months
you were right by the way
he didnt give his name
who cracked it
a history teacher
and his wife in salinas
i like killing people
because it is so much fun
it is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest
because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill
something gives me
the most thrilling experience
it is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl
the best part of it is that when i die
i will be reborn in paradise
and all that i have killed
will become my slaves
i will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down
or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife
methinks our friends
a tad bit fuckered in the head
i heard he even sent vallejo
a code key just to help
what is that at the bottom
leftovers
maybe an anagram
how does one do that
i like puzzles i do them a lot
how did you know
he wasnt gonna give his name
dangerous animal
dangerous animal
what dangerous animal
how do i know that
paul
yes templeton
editorial now
very well
another letter
more of the same
details about the murders
he taped a flashlight to the gun
thats how he hit them in the dark
and he gave himself a name
you know this used to be
the town of montecello
but at some point
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake
so they flooded it
but theres an entire
hidden city under the water
we were here last spring remember
oh yeah
somebody else is here
it is a public park
i think hes watching us

what the hell is he doing out of vallejo
sweet mother of christ
what are you drawing
kid at the lake
this is what he said
the zodiac was wearing
god thats a hell of a getup
paul what are you doing
hyman i wrote it its done
now i just got to type it up
type it up

weve got to read it
whats that
thats the zodiac at the lake
whats the story with the kid
he seems a little touched
or medicated or
graysmith
yeah what is it
hes a fucking boy scout
he doesnt smoke
he doesnt drink he doesnt curse
and hes back
i knew it
man is the most
dangerous animal of all
i knew that
i heard that from somewhere
the most dangerous game
its a movie about a count
who hunts people for sport
people
the most dangerous game
whos that
thats count zaroff
zaroff with a z
and that will be
all for the news on the 20
weve got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties
napa solano contra costa
alameda marin and san mateo
so please everyone stay safe
vic in san francisco youre on the line
youre not scared of the zodiac
heck no
hes only shooting those farm kids
what scares me
is those hippies out in the haight
with their free love and weird clothes
weve got alfred from vacaville
you know i think
that was really offensive
its not just farm kids
these are nice cleancut young people
hey nobodys downplaying
the loss of human life here alfred
well that last guy was
we have good solid communities
out here in the north bay
unlike in the city where you have
satanists running around
well you bring up a good question
is the zodiac a satanist
amber from oakland
what do you think
i dont really know
but i thought that code
they printed didnt look very christian
but i think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldnt have printed
anything that the zodiac
has been doing
that theyre just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers
well the zodiac did demand
they print his letters
or hed kill more people
yeah but he would have
done it anyway
whether they printed it or not i think
an interesting point
so what do you think hell do next
san francisco police department
yes theres a fight in a cab
what is your location
3398 washington
at the corner of cherry
ones drunk and
we think hes robbing him
is the crime still in progress
yes please hurry
oh my god look

cabbies been shot
three blocks from the presidio

let me just describe
the lamp youre gonna buy me
i just got to sleep
suspects negro male adult
walts on scene locked up the cab
and secured the crowd

i lost feeling in my arm and everything

the victims name is paul stine
dousette pronounced him at 1010
suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head
drivers wallet
and car keys are missing
howd you know his name
leroy there came down
from yellow cab to id him
neighborhoods pretty highend
for this kind of thing
so i already set up transpo for the cab
coroners here
any witnesses
kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window
did they hear a shot
no
they first saw him in the front seat
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver
oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room
described him as a white male glasses
crewcut stocky
and wearing a dark jacket
wait i thought someone said
he was black
thats the description
that went out to radio cars
we already corrected it
oh well thats good
you guys need anything else
no get out of here
thanks happy birthday
wait its your birthday
yep
thats great happy birthday
thanks
body or scene

dave looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good
we got some blood over here

well dust it at the hall
the odd thing is we also got gloves
suspects
theres blood on them
hey pete
yeah dave
you through over there
can i get in there
yeah im all set
who rolled him
stewarts
i got a single 9mm casing
yeah luger
nothing from the crowd
okay
im your shooter negro male adult
who also happens to be
a stocky crewcut caucasian
i flag a cab i give him this address
did i give him this address
whos got the fare book
right here
washington and maple
thats one block east
lightings the same over here
so maybe i see
someone walking their dog
you dont want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block
he pulls over
i wait for him to put it in park
because im smart
and i dont want him
hitting the accelerator
when i shoot him may i
he stops puts it in park boom
i shoot him on the right side
he slumps right
maybe youve got your hand
on his collar when you shoot
all right so either way
i just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat
so why do you get in the front seat
for the money
but hes dead
you could just reach over the seat
pull out his wallet
you dont have to go
anywhere near the blood
so whyd he get in the front seat
im an idiot
but youre not an idiot
you waited for him to put it in park
right thank you
yeah sure
can i see that
yeah
i am an idiot
i just killed a man for 825

it looked like
they were drunk and fighting
yeah and he had a rag
he came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff
did you get a chance to see his face
i did
well sort of
did you remember what he looked like
normal
yeah
normal
this is the zodiac speaking
i am the murderer of the taxi driver
over by washington street
and maple street last night
to prove this here is
a bloodstained piece of his shirt
i am the same man who did in
the people in the north bay area
the sf police could have
caught me last night
if they had searched the park properly
instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles
gentlemen
dave
paul wheres the shirt
right there boss
theres your rag the kids talked about
so he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt
is this on the record
well what do you think
he confirms
the vallejo and napa killings
gets worse
robert do you have a deadline
what does he mean it gets worse
read the last part

i would love to
if i could get out of this
homicide please hold

really why
i dont think he wanted

can you send us everything
that you have
well the road goes both ways
now we need that print
you lifted from the cab
and we should have been in
on the handwriting
i apologize
things have been moving fast

we really should have been in
on the handwriting
i apologize
things have been moving fast
listen were gonna need
your scene photos
cant help you
ken i dont want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here
no no no no no
we didnt have a crime scene
the ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket
all we have are the wing walker prints
the what
boot prints to and from the crime scene
were made by size
10andahalf wing walkers
militarystyle boots
sold only at military pxs
designed to walk
on the wings of planes
and you cant buy at a px
without a military id
so our suspect could be military
did you guys narrow your list off of this
yeah
did vallejo
i dont know i dont work in vallejo
i work here
great im gonna need photos
of those boot prints
sure if you send me the handwriting
i thought questioned documents
already did
nope vallejos got them not us
all right
ill have questioned documents
forget it ill telefax it to you
we dont have telefax yet
okay ill put it in the mail
well mail ours too
and call mulanax in vallejo
maybe he can get you a mimeo
right
why dont you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast
wed have to wait
because they dont have a fax
we dont have a fax either
look im just trying
to get us coordinated
have you called solano sheriffs office
why would i call solano
because the two kids that got killed
last christmas were solanos
i thought they were vallejo
no they were over the county line
so youre gonna need
to coordinate with them too
okay
bill
can i have a word with you
where did you see this guy
we got the call to circle the scene
and look for a negro male adult
where was he
on jackson heading east
about the middle of the block
and this is three minutes
after the shooting
give or take yeah
and you were heading east or west
we were going west
all right so youre
on jackson going west
so the cab was one block
cattycorner southwest
correct
did you slow down
of course we slowed down
all right
listen dispatch said
it was a negro male
that was corrected
no but at the time
they hadnt changed it
this guy was white
right not in a hurry
kind of lumbering along like
lumbering
what do you mean lumbering
shuffling
stocky had a crew cut
yeah thats all correct
listen it was dark
the guy was wearing a dark jacket
theres no way
he would have been covered in blood
did you stop him
did you talk to him
yes no
no
you need to get with a sketch artist
we have to put out
a new composite right away
five persons have been murdered
in the san francisco area
and in each case the killer
i shall wipe out a school bus
some morning
san francisco police
to see the stones in concert
this sunday
the new letters
from the zodiac killer were sent to
the city room of the
san francisco chronicle
one of the letters was
looming no looming
have you considered the water theory
what
geographically every attack
takes place near a body of water
or a waterbased name
this is your water theory
lake berryessa blue rock springs
lake herman
washington and cherry
you think
no
im reading this book
homicide investigation
by lemoyne snyder
leymone
and he says you look for patterns
so im looking for patterns
no
you cant think of this case
in normal police terms
why not
you got four crime scenes
solano vallejo berryessa and here
not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters
how does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent
i mean assuming the gloves are his
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off
so its not his print
maybe maybe not
youre missing the point
the point is the first attack
david faraday and betty jensen
they both die
from there on out
he only manages to kill the girls
not for lack of trying
not for lack of trying
mageau lives ferrin dies
hartnell lives shepard dies
he gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men
plus theyre all couples
and all on lovers lanes
paul stine is not
exactly
single male cab driver
on washington and cherry doesnt fit
doesnt fit
so why does zodiac kill him
hes breaking the pattern
yeah
someone claiming to be zodiac
called oakland pd a halfhour ago
he says hes gonna call in on jim
dunbars morning show in three hours
on television
he wants melvin belli on
to counsel him
all right all right
lets go wake up melvin
animal crackers
glove box
are these windows bulletproof
yes melvin
you dont have to lie down back there
this man is a marksman
could snuff me out
at a moments notice

this man has asked for my help
the man youre worrying about
snuffing you out

so the phone lines are open
mr belli is here

do you think you need medical care
medical not mental
do you have health problems
im sick i have headaches
headaches
i have headaches too
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago
i think i can help you sam
sam
he knows theyre tracing his calls
sam wed like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls
its a long difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls
sam
were not tracing these calls
you have my word
okay
sam you need to tell me
what your problem is
i dont want to go to the gas chamber
i have headaches
i kill i dont get them
that is fucked up
you want to live dont you
well this is your passport
how long have you been
having these headaches
since i killed a kid
do you have blackouts
yes
do you have fits
no i just have headaches
did you attempt to call one other time
when f lee bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago
yes
and why did you want
to talk to mr bailey
why do you wanna talk to me sam
i dont want to be hurt
why is he calling
hey just a second buddy
i dont wanna go to the gas chamber
you wont get hurt if you talk to me
and youre not going
to the gas chamber
i wouldnt think they would ask
for capital punishment
we should ask the district attorney
do you want me to do that sam
do you want me to talk
to the district attorney
what was that sam
i did not say anything
we heard a scream
that was my headache

my my my
you fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting
you know the problem is
i dont want to go to the gas chamber
i have headaches
i kill i dont get them
no its not him
its the voice
the voice is too high its too young
all right
thanks for coming down bryan
do you have blackouts
thats okay i got it
they pulled off the trace
our daly city noshow
called from a mental institution
oakland pds operator is sure
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice
calmer
might have actually been him
so i shall change
my way of collecting slaves
i shall no longer announce to anyone
when i commit my murders
they shall look like routine robberies
killings of anger
and a few fake accidents et cetera
the police shall never catch me
because i have been
too clever for them
i look like the description passed out
only when i do my thing
the rest of the time
i look entirely different
i shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when i kill
as of yet i have left no
fingerprints behind me
contrary to what the police say
i wear transparent fingertips
all it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips
i enjoy needling the blue pigs
hey blue pig i was in the park
you were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars
hey pig doesnt it rile you up
to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos
if you cops think i am going to take
on a bus the way i stated i was
you deserve to have holes
in your heads
and you need to look at this
take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer
one gallon of stove oil
and dump a few bags
of gravel on top
okay
its a bomb
okay we gotta call the army
and see if this
science experiment could actually work
another cipher
when did these arrive
they arrived this morning
are you planning to publish
robert
we should have a drink
thank you
so tell me about yourself
you married
divorced two kids
what do you do for fun
i love to read
i enjoy books
those are the same things
why you been going through my trash
ill come back to that
how did you know
he was gonna send another code
i just guessed
just guessed
the first one seemed too easy
all right this can no longer be ignored
what is that youre drinking
its an aqua velva
you wouldnt make fun of it
if you tried it
but who actually cracked the code
a married couple who like puzzles
so whats that tell us about the zodiac
hes no expert
right
its just a simple substitution code
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts
a is one b is two
we werent all boy scouts robert
well its not that hard
you just got to know where to start
in the first cipher
you actually carry that around with you
why
no reason
whats the most common double
consonant in the english language
consonant
the double l
double l
and whats the one word that we know
that hell use in here at least once
kill
right kill
so the hardens start looking
for double symbols
which they find here here and here
each with the same
two symbols preceding them
so now theyve got
a repeating fourletter word
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for l
and since they think the whole word
is kill then
then you got your k you got your i
and youre on your way
but how do you go
from a is one and b is two
to figuring out this whole code
well same way i did
you go to the library
in this book
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface
eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher
yeah but there are nonletter symbols
because theres all
these medieval ones
i thought they looked medieval too
but then i found a code
written in the middle ages
guess what its called
the zodiac alphabet
jesus
what do you want out of this
what
whats your angle
this is good business
for everyone but you
how do you mean business
hey come to bed
ill be up in a minute
i need to make a phone call
hello
bill
theres not many basements
in california
basement for future use
thats right
ill have vallejo and napa
check with their city planners
get some sleep
yeah sure
dear melvin
this is the zodiac speaking
i wish you a happy christmas
the one thing i ask of you is this
please help me
i cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me wont let me
thank you
i am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check
and i am afraid i will lose control again
and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim
melvin hes reaching out to you
absolutely
inspectors he sent this letter
directly to my residence
it is a cry for help
intended as a private communiquã
which is why
you contacted the chronicle
the people have a right to know
toddy
when did the letter arrive
in the middle of last week
i was away on safari
what did you gentlemen
do for christmas
youre looking at it
you must see africa
cradle of civilization
fascinating people beautiful savage
back to the killer who wrote to you
yes of course
it is my belief
that he only penned this letter
because he couldnt get through to me
on the dunbar show or here
he tried to contact you here
several times
i was out
but he spoke with my housekeeper
didnt leave a number
hes kind of crafty like that
do you mind if i speak to her
not at all but the real story is the letter
ill be back
yeah
shes right this way
inspector toschi it is my belief
this is a window into this mans soul
killing is his compulsion
even though he tries to ignore it
it drives him
its in his blood
could be
or maybe he just likes the attention
i didnt mean to scare you
but your right rear wheel is loose
really
if you like
i could tighten the lugs up for you
if you dont mind
well you cant be too careful
all done
thank you
no problem have a good night
its okay
are you okay
yeah yeah were fine
must have been worse than i thought
i can give you a lift to a service station
okay
its okay come on
i didnt know you had a baby
oh is that okay
the more the merrier
you shouldnt smoke its a bad habit
i think we just passed a filling station
it was closed
do you always go around
helping people in the night
when im done with them
they dont need much help
its okay
before i kill you
im gonna throw your baby
out the window
no help please no
she was on the side of the road
she flagged me down
what happened to her
she said she jumped from a car
i found her like this
what is it
please he said
itll be okay
tried to kill me
my baby
wheres her baby
she didnt have one when i stopped
wheres your baby
jesus
you hid it
in case he came back
this is the zodiac speaking
by the way have you cracked
the last cipher i sent you
im mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now
i hope you do not think i was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie
with a bomb at the cop station
even though i talked about
killing children with one
this is the zodiac speaking
id like to see some nice zodiac
buttons wandering around town
everyone else has these buttons
like peace black power
and melvin eats blubber et cetera
it would cheer me up considerably
if i saw a lot of people
wearing my button
please no nasty ones
this is the zodiac speaking
i shot a man
sitting in a parked car with a 38
zodiac 12 sfpd zero
the map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set
you have until next fall to dig it up
this is the zodiac speaking
im rather unhappy because you people
will not wear
some nice zodiac buttons
so i now have a little list
starting with the woman and her baby
that i gave a rather interesting ride
for a couple of hours one evening
a few months back
that ended in my burning her car
where i found them
were really not gonna run
any more of his letters
the new policy our brothers in blue
want us to hold back
and see how he reacts
four letters in three months
and this is the first mention
of kathleen johns thats very weird
thats because hes full of shit
what do you mean
you dont know
welcome please put your stuff down
youre going down five rows and left
looking for the modesto bee
from march
im going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit
left
left
what am i looking for
kathleen johns
also probably you wanna
pull the chron from
you know never mind ill see to that
okay look at this letter again
the part about kathleen johns
tell me what facts he gives
a woman and her baby abducted
fact
the car on fire
okay now
look at the article from the bee
seen it yet
everything in the letter
already appeared in the article
and hes done it before
officer richard radetich
shot sitting in his car
zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car
couple days after this article came out
the police already had somebody
in custody
zodiac didnt do it
but took credit for it anyway
because hes in it for the press
he even stole his symbol
what
yeah shit
if i show you something
you promise not to tell anyone
who would i tell
okay totally solid point okay
thats the only place
that word and that symbol
ever appeared together
before the letters
the guy stole his logo off a watch
how can somebody
whos killed 13 people do
he claims hes killed 13 people
but which ones
can we actually confirm
theres three in vallejo
one in berryessa the cabbie thats it
bobby you almost look disappointed
chiefs pulling everybody off buses
business as usual
somethingll shake loose
not a peep in four months
first he wont shut up and now
maybe we drove him underground
maybe hes gone
311 at 582 haight cross at biltmore
theres a male
happy birthday bill
thanks
does it ever bother you
that people call you shorty
does it bother you
that people call you a retard
nobody calls me that
right
as governor
i pledge to use all my influence
to make sure that darlene ferrins killer
is brought to justice
i believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of darlene ferrin
i believe her murder was premeditated
who is that
florence douglas mayor of vallejo
shes running for governor
i believe that the police department
either did not have the money the time
or yes the inclination
sayonara police endorsement
good work flo
does anyone ever call me names or
you mean like retard
yeah
no
shit fuck oh my god jesus
tell me thats not a piece
of bloody shirt
fuck holy fucking crap
i feel it in my bones
you ache to know my name
and so ill clue you in
but then why spoil the game
happy halloween
paul you did call him
a latent homosexual
in at least one of your articles
dave i want a gun
a gun
youre in herb caen
paul averys investigation
has won him the accolade
of a message from the zodiac warning
you are doomed
as a result several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading
i am not paul avery

dave
in a bizarre twist
the hunted has become hunter
san francisco chronicle reporter
and zodiac target paul avery
claims to have uncovered
new information
regarding the only unsolved homicide
in riverside countys history
a 1966 southern california murder
that avery now believes
was the zodiacs first victim
what
he didnt call you about this
hang on
the riverside killer
wrote to the press letters
that i then took personally to
the office of questioned documents
and what did this expert tell you
what i knew in my gut ron
the handwriting matches zodiacs
howd he get the evidence
out of riverside
he took it to sherwood
without telling us the son of a bitch
you know how bad this looks
hey how do we know
that this lead is real
its very real you know how i know
because i saw it on tv
excuse me
dave
hi
dave you know mel nicolai
hes working the case for justice
good to see you mel
all due respect
can someone explain to me
why im reading
about breaks in this case
in the chronicle instead
of getting calls from you
we got screwed
dave come on
you do get your name in the paper a lot
people talk
i dont ever talk about an open
investigation period okay ken
dave hey hi
paul avery can i catch a ride
with you gents when we get there
not a good idea paul

i hear you have some files for us
ill show you mine you show me yours
frisco huh
thats right san francisco
ken narlow from napa
ken
mel nicolai justice
mel
heres what we know
cheri jo bates attended
riverside community college
she studies in the library
the night of october 30th 1966
she leaves with an unidentified male
at closing 900 p m
her bodys found the next morning
in a parking lot stabbed to death
her car is disabled
someone cut the coil in the distributor
the battery died
the someone comes back
offers to help
like kathleen johns
who
a woman outside of modesto
might be a zodiac victim
might might be
i have her comp right here in this file
okay
a typewritten confession was sent
to the riverside press enterprise
on november 29th
a month after batess murder
they ran it
im not sick i am insane
but that will not stop the game
this letter should be published
for all to read
he wants to be published
he calls it a game
i mean this could be our boy
six months later the police
the girls father and the paper
they all received these
double postage just like zodiac
these are what sherwood morrill
matched to the zodiac letters
these and the desktop don
this was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in rcc storage
sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood
who etches in their own handwriting
to be honest with you
our letters and your letters
i dont see it
how did paul avery
get his hands on the exemplars
i gave them to him
we talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour
and i told him you were gonna be here
you told him we were meeting
yeah
i also told him
we dont think this is zodiac
okay wait a minute
you dont think this is zodiac
we got a guy we like for it
we dont have enough
to pin it on him yet
but were pretty sure its him
if you dont think this is zodiac
then why give anything to avery
im trying to cooperate
oh thats how you cooperate
by giving information to reporters
look i dont know
about the handwriting
but sherwood says its a match right
so lets just say
that your guy did cheri jo
he types the confession
zodiac reads it in the paper
and he writes a letter taking credit for it
now thats something hes done before
look now you have everything we have
but in my opinion
you guys came south for nothing
fubar gentlemen fubar
i dont care what he says
this still could be z
the problem is
the entire state already thinks it is
well theres your press agent
talk to him about it
i come in peace
i dont want any trouble
i really dont want to talk to you
right now paul not now
just trying to do my job
oh really well now i cant do mine
were already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing
and you just freaked out the entire state
i have got napa vallejo and doj
looking at me sideways
and riversides telling me
im on a snipe hunt
jesus hey cheri jo bates was a gift
i gave that to you
you and armstrong
never would have found her
this may not be zodiac
does that matter to you
what if it is
does it matter that riverside may not
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you
tell it to sherwood
im out here beating the bushes
trying to draw him out
were in this together
no were not in anything together paul
because im not interested
in upping my circulation
oh boy he wrote me
he threatened my life
hey bullitt
been a yearandahalf
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not
go fuck yourself
happily
you should have called me paul
thank you
did you see this
unfortunately yes
here comes every lunatic in california
im the zodiac
and how did you kill your victims
with a gun no with a hammer
all im authorized to tell you
is that hes still under
government employment
and who authorized you to tell me this
thats all im authorized to say
only a little rat bastard like andre
could have done something
like cut off all the victims hands
zodiac didnt cut off
any of the victims hands
are you sure
yes sir
travis and i worked here
side by side for 10 years
his foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin
coincidence
i dont know
youre a cop man do the math
have you considered
the killer might be paul avery
frequently
he was drinking coors
getting a load on
starts talking about hunting people
like that book
says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun
to use as a sight in the dark
he said that
yeah
so i asked him
how would you get away with it
and he said it would be easy
cause thered be no real motive
to the thing
then he said hed write letters
to the police
and call himself zodiac
to mess with them
leigh liked messing with people
youre positive he said zodiac
yeah
i thought it was a stupid name
so i told him
he got up all upset and said
i dont care what you think
ive thought about it a long time
and thats the name im gonna use
did you feel like hed been
thinking about it a long time
he was raw about losing his job
at the school
he talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus
and picking off the little darlings
he actually used those words
thats what made me remember
afterwards i told my wife
i didnt wanna see him again
and i havent since
other thing is leighs into skin diving
i know hes been up to that lake
a bunch of times
lake berryessa
did you ever go with him
couple times we went fishing
by putah creek near there
tell him when you put it together
about a year ago in the paper
there was a story about the zodiac
and it all comes back
i tried to call the local cops
they blew him off
thought he was a nut
and youre sure
the conversation you had about zodiac
took place on january 1 st 1968
it couldnt have been any later
i started a new job in la
on january 20th
i had to move
this is my problem this guy
arthur leigh allen
this guy leigh
just lays out his entire evil plan
to a fishing buddy on new years day
i dont know
hes angry hes been drinking
been thinking about it for a while
i can buy that
so why didnt cheney
contact us sooner
i checked he did
first recorded contact
with the police department about allen
was in pomona january 1 oth 1970
he just got lost in the shuffle
did cheney have anything
against allen
did allen screw his wife or anything
were gonna do
a full background check
but i got to tell you i like this guy
so lets pull
some handwriting samples
hi i talked to sherwood
he got the samples
what are you having
blt
so the check stubs are a wash
theres not enough handwriting
the applications got more
but it doesnt look like zs
so he cant rule him in
but he cant rule him out either
well thats vague
he needs more samples
also our guy is a pervert
when mel got the application
from valley springs
they told him that
allen had been fired for touching kids
touching
polite euphemism
so what do you want to do
make some phone calls
are you done with the fries
go ahead
did you and mr cheney have a chance
to look at the copies
of the zodiac letters we sent you
yeah
some of this stuff is pretty creepy
yeah we know that
i mean creepy like leigh
he misspells words like that
he thinks its funny
what about the handwriting
i dont know
dont you have experts for that stuff
our man at questioned documents
says its inconclusive
maybe he did it with his other hand
the letters are a little too neat
for someone to have written
with the wrong hand
but not for leigh right
what do you mean
hes ambidextrous
he can write with either hand
didnt you guys know that
in everyday life allen uses his left hand
job applications
letters to friends et cetera
but he writes the zodiac letters
with his right hand
producing a different handwriting
that he cant be linked to
we got to see this guy chief
where is he
vallejo
he works at union oil in pinole
his brothers up there too
see them both
make sure you call mulanax
it is his backyard
oh right because that
worked so well for us in riverside
cooperation thats us at all costs
you can talk to him in here
coke machines busted by the way
ill go get him for you
so how do you guys wanna do this
well bill talked to the informants
he leads we follow
its okay by me
mr allen im inspector bill armstrong
this is inspector dave toschi
and sergeant jack mulanax
were investigating the zodiac murders
in san francisco and vallejo
please sit down
the informant notified us
that you made certain statements
11 months prior
to the first zodiac murder
if theyre true
theyre quite incriminating
do you recall
having any such conversation
no
have you ever read
or heard anything about the zodiac
when it was first in the paper
but i didnt follow it
after those first reports
why not
too morbid i
i told all this to the other officer
which other officer
from vallejo
do you remember his name
no but it was right after
the murder at the lake
and what did you tell this officer
i told him that id gone to salt point
that weekend to skin dive
that i was alone
but i met a couple there
i have their names at home
if you want them
that would be great arthur
leigh
what
leigh nobody calls me arthur
also that day when i came home
my neighbor saw me
it was around 400
but i forgot to tell the other officer that
neighbors name
bill white
he died a week or so afterwards
heart attack
so i didnt think to call to follow up
the knives i had in my car
with the blood on them
that blood came from a chicken
that i killed for dinner
what
i had knives in my car that weekend
maybe bill saw them
and called the other officer on me
well well be checking in on that
well let me ask you something else
were you ever in southern california
at any time in 1966
is this about the riverside killing
yes
well i guess i was there
around that time
i used to go down there a lot
i like the auto races
informant says that
youre ambidextrous
no thats untrue
you cant write with both hands
my teachers tried to make me
when i was a kid but i couldnt
im lefthanded
he also said that you made statements
about killing school children
that is
that is horrible that is
thats a horrible thing to say
so you werent angry
about being fired from valley springs
for touching your students
im not the zodiac
and if i was i certainly wouldnt tell you
thats a nice watch
thank you
may i see it
may i see it
whered you get it
it was a christmas gift
from my mother two years ago
thats very sweet
so tell me something arthur
you dont remember anyone
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the zodiac
maybe ted kidder or phil tucker
at vallejo recreation
but i couldnt be positive
i used to work there when
the most dangerous game
what
the most dangerous game
thats why youre here isnt it
it was my favorite book in high school
its about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island
because he was
tired of hunting animals
he hunted the people for the challenge
and man is the most
dangerous animal of all
thats the whole point of the story
great book
or at least thats what i told phil
may i go
sure
thanks for your time
im willing to help in any way possible
i look forward to the day
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs
thanks
well be in touch
so does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation
these are copies of some
of the zodiac letters that were sent
wed like you to take a look at them
you think my brothers the zodiac
well were looking at him
are you going to arrest him
mrs allen we dont arrest people
just because were interested in them
well leighs always been troubled
is it true about the children
unfortunately
we dont see him much anymore
since we found out
what are your feelings
about don cheney
don cheney my old roommate
was he the one who contacted you
thats confidential
well dons a very reliable guy
if he were to tell you something
id believe it to be true
this one
what about it
here where he spells
christmas with two ss
we got a christmas card from leigh
a couple years ago
he spelled it the exact same way
christmass
would you still have that
i can look for it
thank you thatd be great
is there anything else
we can do to help
the brother said
he would search leighs apartment
next time he went out of town
that gets you around a warrant
for the time being
if we do find something
mulanax will go to the da in vallejo
and we could search the place properly
now i got a chance to talk to the cop
who interviewed leigh allen
two days after the berryessa murders
doesnt remember how he got onto him
but didnt think he looked like a killer
so he didnt like him for z
but you do
i wish i couldve taken the guy in there
take it slow dave
try and find more stuff for sherwood
a matchll get us farther
on the warrants
averys on two
tell him to screw
you want me to communicate that
verbatim or can i spice it up a little
christ kid
yeah
paul ive been thinking
oh god save us all
the letter to melvin belli
was sent exactly one year
after the lake herman road murder
and the one to cheri jo bates father
was sent exactly six months
after her death
she was killed a day before halloween
yeah
and you received a halloween card
you know these are all fascinating
pieces of news robert
its a bit early in the day
paul its 1100 and we missed editorial
im sorry i didnt mean to wake you up
no no no
i just thought that
no no no
this suspect is not your zodiac
this sample matches the canceled
checks and the application
perfectly
so weve just retested the left hand
i mean we know hes ambidextrous
in 38 years ive never seen anyone
that ambidextrous
both hands would have commonalities
im sorry
just not gonna work
homicide toschi
dave its jack mulanax
hey mulanax yeah
we struck out with the judge
he wont sign off on a warrant
for allens house
why not
said it wasnt enough
now unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that
how are we gonna get evidence
if we cant toss the house
i dont know
i truly am sorry
no no thank you jack
what do you wanna do
dont know what i can do
without vallejo
we need allens right hand
we cant get it without a warrant
are there other guys
you should be looking at
only what
twentythree hundred
okay then
okay then
paul you wrote the justice department
asking to be put in charge
of the zodiac investigation
i merely suggested
on our letterhead
that those with intimate knowledge
of the case
create an information clearinghouse
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas
and that you run it
well who better than me
the marked man
paul if you want to work here
i need three things
one stop boozing
two stop doing
whatever else it is youre doing
and three cut this nonsense out
sweetest of templetons if at any time
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag
ill more than happily
more than happily
decamp for greener pastures
paul i mean it
paul
yep
what was that
an editorial tãªteã tãªte
wanna grab a drink
its 1000 in the morning
late breakfast
early lunch or
paul
are you okay
no
thank you for asking
shorty lets go out for one
paul where are you going
so you moved off my brotherinlaw
we couldnt get a warrant
last year we arranged for leigh
to get help from a social worker
he only went twice
we saw him recently for
the first time in nine months
my motherinlaw brought him by
to see the new baby
after he left
i went to see that social worker
he couldnt talk about a former patient
so i just asked him straight out
if he thought leigh
was capable of killing people
because of patient confidentiality
the man said yes
why hadnt you seen him
in nine months
hes going to school in santa rosa
santa rosa where is he living
in his trailer
in santa rosa
sonoma county
we wouldnt have to go
through the vallejo da
its been 11 months
since you talked to this guy
and now you wanna search his trailer
if we find something great
if not we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands
i thought sherwood shut you down
what if i can get a second opinion
i dont wanna step on sherwoods toes
he trained me at this
terry all i need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous
could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand
between you and me
because there are differing
schools of thought on this
get the samples of his other hand
if hes the zodiac youll get a match
thats the current thinking
according to terry pascoe
meanwhile i spoke to a psychologist
whod be willing to testify
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like zodiac
would manifest it physically
altering his handwriting
which is why sherwood couldnt
get a match from allens samples
we got terry pascoe
this psychology guy
coupled with cheney
it could be enough for a warrant
get cheney on the record
and that he would call himself zodiac
yes
and youre willing to swear
to this under oath in superior court
without any hesitation
thank you very much mr cheney
thank you very much for your time
thank you
suspect is arthur leigh allen
lives in sunset trailer court
in santa rosa california
physical description
allen is similar in height
weight and build
to a man seen at lake berryessa
on the day of the stabbings
i understand he doesnt look
much like the san francisco composite
true height and weight are sketchy
but lumbering caucasian
with a crew cut is right on
we never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids
the patrolman
who saw zodiac that night
said he didnt look much like the sketch
military boot prints
allen was in the navy
wears a size 10andahalf
same size as the prints
found at berryessa
what about gun
cheney says allen owns several
firearms well list them in the warrant
and the ciphers
could be code training in the navy
and people have seen allen
with ciphers in the past
really who
that would be his sisterinlaw
and a man named phil tucker
that he worked with
at a public pool in vallejo
and phil tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with allen
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun
that gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight
what about his threats on children
suspect worked for elementary schools
and was fired for molestation
in march april 68
could give him motive
at the very least its home turf
hed have knowledge of bus routes
which the two major threats
centered around
what about the bomb
allen works as a chemist
take him through the geography
vallejo murders
allen lives in vallejo
with his mother in her basement
berryessa murder on the day
that the two kids were stabbed
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken
does he have any alibis
he claimed he did but hes been unable
to produce the names
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of berryessa
the bottom line is that allen
cant alibi up on anything
riverside vallejo the lake or us
you want to tell me about the name
what name
zodiac
allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol
and he mentioned zodiac to cheney
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter
john
thats pretty good guys
we think so too
lets take it to a judge
mr allen
this is the
santa rosa police department
we have a warrant
to search your residence
hello
ill check with the neighbors
close the door
close the door
theres rodents running around
neighbor said he tore out of here
about a halfhour ago
you think somebody tipped him
were not leaving till he comes back
ill check the back
jesus
what
squirrels
piece of work this guy
not one but two blue windbreakers
like the stine scene
well have those checked for blood
and a pair of black gloves
mens seven
just like the ones we found in the cab
well hes got the same size shoes
and gloves as z
probably just a coincidence
dave i got a gun
check that two guns
theyre both 22s
one automatic one revolver
well thats interesting
because he happens to have
an m1 rifle here in the closet
for little darlings bouncing off buses
someones here
hello arthur remember us
no
on the handwriting
ballistics no match
prints no match writing no match
on both hands right
because we got handwriting
from both his hands
and neither hand matches
forget sherwood
lets get another opinion
fellas hes not your guy
damn it
hey
what do you want time off
a hug
do you know what
the worst part of this is
i cant tell if i wanted it
to be allen so bad
because i actually thought it was him
or i just want all this to be over
its because you thought it was him
and i did too
you know what take some time off
spend some time with your wife
and the kids
go to candlestick see a movie
to the city of san francisco
i will enjoy killing one person every day
until you pay me 100000
if you agree say so tomorrow morning
in the personal column
san francisco chronicle
and i will set up meeting
if i do not hear from you
it will be my next pleasure
to kill a catholic priest or a
scorpio
whos out of their minds
ive got to get out of here
where the hell does he expect me
to find 100000
youre not thinking of paying him
are you mr mayor
the city of san francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime
the killer gets shot in the chest
thats how it ends

im robert graysmith
i work at the chronicle with paul avery
dave toschi nice to meet you

no im not a crook
generation of hostility

of 50000 americans
and several
hundred thousand vietnamese
patricia hearst is kidnapped
by the symbionese liberation army
all of us should stand up together
and say no more
your declaration of independence
spreads that
americans admire
the united kingdom
mr hoffa has disappeared

that the police have captured a man
whom they believe
to be the son of sam

its no bother at all
nobody comes by from the old days
cheers
to your health and mine
mostly mine
so
whats new
ive been thinking
yeah
somebody should write a book
somebody should write a fucking book
thats for sure
about what
about zodiac
its not new
ive been thinking that
if you put all the information together
maybe you could jog something loose
and then i was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you
yeah thats true
you know all the players
and you have all the files
lost them
you lost them
or i tossed them i dont know
i moved onto a boat
you know that we work
in the daily business right
as in today
what do you think
we were doing back then
do you know that more people die
in the east bay commute
every three months
than that idiot ever killed
he offed a few citizens
he wrote a few letters
and he faded into a footnote
not that i havent been sitting here idly
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose
it was four years ago let it fucking go
youre wrong it was important
then what did you ever do about it
if it was so fucking important
what did you ever do
you hovered over my desk
you stole from wastebaskets
am i being unkind
oh thats right i forgot
you went to the library
im sorry i bothered you
hey hi
hi
where you been
the library
thank you
inspector toschi
yeah one moment please
hi
hi
we met at the movies once
it must have been magical
im robert graysmith
i work at the chronicle
i was wondering if i could buy you lunch
sure why not
so youre a friend of paul averys
hes actually the reason im here
i wanted to ask you about zodiac
well i appreciate the interest
but we dont discuss open cases
oh well whats going on with it
day to day
were actively pursuing all leads
and youre the only one on it right
mr graysmith
zodiac hasnt written in three years
you know how many murders
weve had in san francisco since then
no
over 200
thats a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help
so nobody cares
excuse me i care
okay can i show you something
ive been doing research
on the first cipher
everything an amateur
would need to create it
can be found in these books
now i started thinking
that if you can track these books
then maybe you can track the man
so i remember you thought
that zodiac was military
so i went to every base library
and i got a list of every person
whos ever checked out these books
and thats when i found this
missing
it means they were stolen
so almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the presidio library
and the oakland army terminal library
somebody didnt want a record
of ever having checked out these books
who are you again
i just wanna help
i cant allow you to help
i cant discuss the case with you
i cant give you information
and i certainly couldnt tell you
to go see ken narlow in napa
narlow
im sorry mr graysmith
but we dont cooperate with writers
well im not a writer im a cartoonist
and dave toschi sent you
yes
why
maybe he
maybe he thought
that i could do some good
what are you some kind of boy scout
eagle scout actually first class
well if you wanna do this
dont let me stop you
better start with vallejo jack mulanax
i understand what youre trying to do
but this is an open police investigation
im a friend of dave toschis
and he said
that you might be able to help
i mean the case is dead
zodiacs long gone
hes yesterdays news right
thats what they say
so whats the harm
no pens no paper
anything that you see thats relevant
you got to remember in your head
okay
okay here we go
which one
all of them
and theres more in the next room
theyre all marked with these numbers
you dont smoke do you
once in high school
whats this
thank you
man you really creeped us out
nine millimeter
said nothing and began firing
most dangerous game
do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting
not because of handwriting
darlenes sister linda
it was all just deep breathing george
it was a strange man george
strange man
thank you so much
oh briefcase oh thanks
hey jack
hey bawart
whos that
thats graysmith
some cartoonist
thinks hes gonna solve the zodiac
well good for him
thank you for meeting me inspector
no were not meeting robert
were just two guys
who happen to be sitting
on the same bench at the same time
ive got five minutes
ive got to get back to the hall
okay as far as you know
did anyone ever get in touch
with mike mageau
during your investigation
and show him suspect photos
why
well hes the only surviving victim
who ever saw zodiac without a mask
no i mean why are you asking me
mageau and darlene
thats vallejos case
paul stine is mine
youve got four minutes now
darlene ferrin was being followed
now i know mulanax says
that they already found this guy
a george waters
but he also said
that she had a lot of admirers
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked
she was popular
very
yeah so
she and her husband
they move into their new house
and one night they throw
this painting party
and whats a painting party
its a party where people come
and help you paint
sounds like a terrible party
well supposedly
somebody whos not waters shows up
and darlene is terrified of him
so you think that darlene knew zodiac
and if zodiac knew darlene
then maybe mageau knows zodiac
maybe but mageaus gone
so if you wanna connect
darlene to zodiac
youre gonna have to find another way
i have another way
phone calls the night
of darlenes murder
yeah zodiac called the police
no dave there were four other calls
there were two to darlenes house
one to darlenes brotherinlaw
and one to darlenes fatherinlaw
just heavy breathing
they started around 130 a m
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that darlene had been shot
this was in the vallejo files
yeah
god damn it
its got to be more
than just a coincidence right
i mean somebody doesnt just randomly
prank phone call a victims entire family
90 minutes after they were shot
so either zodiac shoots
a random couple
then he recognizes darlene
or darlene was shot on purpose
either way
zodiac had to have known darlene
thats good robert
so i cant find mageau
so maybe i can find darlenes sister
and maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is
try that ive got to go shes very cute
you know
its interesting that you should mention
zodiac calling people at home
he did that in san francisco once
what who did he call
i cant tell you
thats privileged information
but maybe melvin belli could
melvin belli
how do i get to melvin belli
he should be along soon
oh thats all right
ive really
ive only been waiting two hours so
hes usually not this late
oh cookies thank you
these look great
you are here on business
im writing a book about the zodiac
i remember that i spoke to him
you mean to mr belli about the case
no to the zodiac when he called
he said he had to kill
because it was his birthday
he said it wait
he said it was his birthday
yes you want something to drink
when was this
oh so many years ago
mr belli was away for christmas
gone for a week
the zodiac called
wanting to talk to him
i said he is not here
he said i have to kill
today is my birthday
and then he hangs up
then the letter arrived
so the call came
before the letter of december 20th
mr belli was gone for a week
he came back on christmas
not a good day to work
so he left on the 18th
is that helpful
she said it was his birthday
well youd have to confirm that
now wouldnt you
how
well i never spoke to her
but maybe my partner did
how do i get a hold of him
you dont bill wanted out of this
as far as im concerned
he should stay out
how do i confirm it
well if my partner
did talk to someone from justice
then they wouldve had
to put that in a report
thats standard procedure
okay
mel nicolai
thank you
goodbye
i just need to confirm a date
mr graysmith
ive narrowed it down
between the 18th and the 20th
of december and i just need
okay ill play
lets say this phone call did take place
lets say it really was zodiac
why would he volunteer
the day he was born
plus nobody died on december 18th
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses
hes a liar mr graysmith
what if he made a mistake
what if he wasnt lying
what if it was him on the phone
he didnt expect to pick it up
a nice person to pick up
what if what if what if
look off the record
bill armstrong checked this out
we took this very seriously
none of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller
bill armstrong
can i give you a piece of advice
youre looking in the wrong place
handwriting fingerprints
thats what this whole things about
stick to the evidence
hi
hey how was your day
long
whos sherwood morrill
hes a handwriting expert
in sacramento
he called
he said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 700
oh great
so youre taking off work
just an hour
sacramentos two hours away
really
yes
whats this
oh thats that article
robert graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the zodiac
yeah
it talks all about you
researching zodiac
well thats what the articles about
im not so sure thats something
we want people to know about
why are you embarrassed
robert whats the one thing
we know about zodiac
he reads the chronicle
yeah but hes never
gonna read herb caen
hello
mr graysmith
the robert graysmith
mentioned in the paper today
yeah
i can tell you who the zodiac is
who is this
the zodiac killer
is obsessed with movies
he recorded his murders on film
i tried to tell the police
but they wouldnt follow through on it
theres a man you need to find
his name is bob vaughn
pen pen
vaughn
hes a friend of the zodiacs
mr vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer
and he is storing
some film canisters for him
in these canisters is the evidence
okay yeah friend who is this friend
you have quite enough to get started
oh please
the zodiacs name is rick marshall
your toast is burning
we choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter
once we lock that into our brains
our handwriting may change
over the years
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered
understand
yes
except zodiacs doesnt
specifically with his k
in his first letters
he executed the k with two strokes
later letters he did them with three
why
we dont know
excuse me ive got to spray this
how many suspects
were cleared through handwriting
all of them
also the print in the cab
no match was ever found
is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test
no
whoever the zodiac is
hes not someone i cleared
about a month ago a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught
his name was wallace penny
he said he knew who the zodiac was
gave me a name
rick rick somebody
rick marshall
yeah
i think that the man
who you talked to called me too
after he left then i checked my files
i never cleared a rick marshall
hello
hello who is this
its the wrong number
does the name rick marshall
mean anything to you
what are you after
what do you got
hypothetically you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case
this is off the record
couple years back
i was trying to get marshalls prints
i handed him a photo
he looks at it hes about to give it back
and he stops and he says
my goodness
i got fingerprints all over this
and he wipes them off
why didnt you test him for handwriting
because when they finally
did run his prints
they cleared him
against the one in stines cab
so then its not him
maybe yes maybe no
no what do you mean
zodiac left gloves behind at the scene
if he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him
how the hells he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind
but it was in the victims blood
could have been one of the bystanders
or a cop just reaches out
boom false print
yeah but that print
disqualified 2500 suspects
which is why we also used handwriting
but not for rick marshall
sfpd saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house
decided it looked nothing
like the z letters so they just moved on
how do they know
that rick marshall wrote the sign
my thoughts exactly
rick marshall was a navy man
he received code training
he was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater
well then how do i get copies
of rick marshalls handwriting
three ways
one get a warrant which you cant
two get him to volunteer
which he wont
yeah and three
get creative
i dont know what to tell you
you get it ill analyze it
beyond that youre on your own
okay what about
the guy who came to see you
the one who called me
you mean wallace penny
yeah did he leave a number
hello
hi this is robert graysmith
how did you find me
i need a sample
of rick marshalls handwriting
i told you vaughn is who
mr penny
if rick marshall is the zodiac
i need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it
can you help me or not
rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater vaughn worked at
ill send one down
thank you
ill need to see more samples
yeah but is it
its as close as ive ever seen
we have to tread lightly here
were talking about
implicating this man as the zodiac
i can get more ill just find vaughn
and ill track down linda
i mean linda is darlenes sister
ive been to the dmv
and i talked to her parents
but still nobody knows
where to find her
mr graysmith most of the writing
matches the exemplar
in a way though its the part that
doesnt match that scares me the most
what do you mean
well on the poster
the one letter that absolutely
positively does not match
is the letter k
you wouldnt happen to have any
animal crackers in there would you
unit five
toschi needs to call in on a landline
dispatch
hey dave toschi
ill connect you
dave
yeah whats up
jennings here from the chronicle
it came in this morning
and you need to see it right now
see what
the new zodiac letter
and it mentions you
okay okay
shit all right come on
hall of justice
now come on come on
come on come on come on
dave
do you have it with you
this is the zodiac speaking
im back with you
tell herb caen i am here
i have always been here
that city pig toschi is good
but i am smarter and better
he will get tired then leave me alone
im waiting for a good movie about me
who will play me
im now in control of all things
these guys are from internal affairs
we need to talk
good evening our top story tonight
the san francisco police department
has confirmed
that the man
who calls himself the zodiac
and terrorized the bay area
has broken his silence of 51 months
in a letter claiming
i am back with you
the zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry
and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet
these carrots are perfect
the terse 66 word message
also manages
just go
to mention san francisco chronicle
columnist herb caen
and the departments own
david toschi by name
may i be excused
are they targets
fine but you have to come back
and finish at least half
of whats on that plate
more team coverage
on the cipher slayers return
okay
okay
begins as alan freeman has more
thank you eric
san francisco chronicle columnist
armistead maupin says
that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery
but it was written by the very man
trusted to hunt down this killer
david toschi
maupin a very wellrespected author
has gone on record saying
that he believes toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself
maupin used david
as a character in his column
david got a kick out of it
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters
asking for the character
to be brought back
it was like
writing fan mail to himself thats all
but david did not write that letter
no im sure that he didnt
and im sure that this will all blow over
blow over
they kicked him out of homicide
they made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal
may i talk to him
no
okay can you just ask him
if he ever investigated
a man named rick marshall
is that all you can think about
mr graysmith
maupin works at your paper we trust
this girl she wants music lessons
dave dave
ill catch up to you
you stop calling my house
do you understand me
i just need your help to find linda
jesus
look two seconds
look weve been
running handwriting samples
whos we
sherwood and i
sherwood
sherwood who was fired
from questioned documents
sherwood who drinks
like paul avery now
he retired
is that what he told you
what are you saying hes wrong
im saying stop calling my house
we ran them on rick marshall
no robert
no i know you dont think its him
i mean no i am not having
this conversation
but i think that marshall knew darlene
and i cant talk to mageau or linda
so im gonna talk to bob vaughn
robert robert stop it
what
okay the rick marshalls
of this world will suck you dry
theyre blind alleys
but he said he wasnt gonna announce
his murders anymore dave
he was just gonna do them
do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now
too much time has gone by okay
too much of the evidence is lost
people get old robert they forget
now i have been a cop for 25 years
murder police for 12
what do you do for a living
you know what i do for a living
youre a cartoonist
so what are you saying
i am saying zodiac was my job
it is not yours
hes still out there dave
no robert i am through with this
i am through with you
what about september 26 1970
okay which one was that
the lake tahoe nurse goes missing
one day before the vernal equinox
dad

our special project okay
how come you and mom
dont sleep in the same bed anymore
hello
mr graysmith
its ken narlow from napa
oh captain narlow
thank you for calling me back
yeah how can i help
i called you because weve been
crossreferencing lunar cycles
with the zodiacs timeline
more often than not each cycle
since 69 corresponds with an attack
or with one of the letters
or an unsolved homicide
whos working with you on this
some colleagues
dad
ken can you hold on one second
dad
what is it
whats this
in the decade since the zodiacs
last cipher was received
every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it
but today
where those agencies had failed
a cartoonist has succeeded
how did you do it
oh just a lot of books from the library
and i love puzzles so i just
yeah the fucking library
i believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind
thats a j okay honor camp
thank you so much
hey we found linda
shes in jail isnt that great
whyd you do it
because shell be able to identify rick
what are you talking about
you went on tv
you put yourself out there
for him to see
oh hon youre being paranoid
then whos been calling our house
in the middle of the night
at least once a week
nobody
whats it gonna take
for you to be done with this
i cant talk about this now
i have to go see bob vaughn
well thats too bad
because were gonna talk about this
and when is it gonna be finished
when you catch him
when you arrest him
be serious
i am serious
i need to know who he is
i need to stand there
i need to look him in the eye
and i need to know that its him
is that more important
than your familys safety
of course not
why why do you need to do this
why
because nobody else will
thats not good enough
are you done can i go
mr vaughn
mr graysmith

i wanted to ask you about a film
that the avenue may have played
while you were the organist there
the most dangerous game
oh its a classic rko 1932
fay wray joel mccrea leslie banks
weve run that picture many times
in 68 69
id have to check my records why
do you remember the zodiac
this is about rick marshall isnt it
he was a projectionist there right
for a time yes
but i have no occasion
to correspond with him these days
okay well there is a connection
between one of the zodiac attacks
and that film
you mean the symbol
hold on
the zodiac symbol on film
its on the countdown
its trimmed off each reel
before its shown
but it always arrives with it
right there
the first time i saw it in the papers
i thought about that
we got a tip
that rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open
a tip about a mysterious film canister
is it true
yes
did you open it
no
may i see it
rick took it back in 1972
this tip is how you got it in your head
that rick is the zodiac
that and the poster
the poster
the poster that rick drew
the handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match
rick didnt draw any posters
no he drew this one
mr graysmith i do the posters myself
thats my handwriting
i wont take any more of your time
why dont i just go and find out
when we played that film
oh thats all right
its not a problem
theyre just down in the basement
not many people
have basements in california
i do
you coming mr graysmith
the original studio onesheets
i always kept for myself
the cheapo knockoffs
like you brought today
i end up tossing into the back alley
you live alone
most dangerous game ran in may 69
so that would be about
nine weeks before
the first zodiac letter correct
yeah
do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired
are you sure
theres nobody else in the house
would you like
to go upstairs and check
no
thank you thanks for everything
youre welcome
its locked
thank you
good night mr graysmith
two killers got to be two killers
one has the
guys
youve got five minutes
linda
hi im robert
did you get my note
whats this about
zodiac
figures
you got the look
what look
i didnt mean anything
tell me about this painting party
i told the cops about that so long ago
darlene always had
a lot of boys around
even though she was married
and this one guy was weird though
he used to bring her presents
from tijuana and
i dont know why
she was friends with him
she once told me hed killed somebody
really
yeah i think maybe
when he was in the service
navy
i think so
was he into movies
was he a movie buff
i can tell you that
he was not into people
the party darlene threw
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer help paint
but this guy showed up in a suit
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long
didnt talk to anyone
and darlene told me
to stay away from him
she was scared of him
and a couple of weeks later
she was dead
im sorry do you remember his name
i mean it was short
like a nickname like stan
rick
no i dont think so
are you sure
yeah
how can you be sure
it was a long time ago think hard
i am thinking hard
it was rick
no it wasnt
it was rick it was rick marshall
no
just say it
it wasnt rick
it was leigh
leigh
yeah leigh
sounds right
officer i need you to let me in
is this an emergency
no i just need to see one file
no you need to come back

i know exactly where it is
please
i shouldnt be talking to you

okay
here here
linda states that some of
darlenes closest friends are leigh
who used to bring darlene
presents from tijuana
so what
he knew her
linda said leigh this is leigh
no thats just one name in a file
that contains hundreds
its nothing
dave toschi
agrees with me
our investigation
into this subject is over
im sorry
hello
whos there
you didnt return my calls
oh ive been kind of busy
yeah i can see that
hows the book coming
i tried to send you these
i called the chron
well im not a cartoonist anymore so

whens the last time
you ate something
nothing makes sense anymore
did it ever
yeah it did
robert it was just the date
that didnt end
you dont mean that
a little
the kids miss you
i cant have them see me like this
neither can i
so do whatever you have to
but finish this
dave
dave its robert
dave
is he actually here
im gonna kill him
im calling sfpd wheres my gun
dave
robert go away
dave he made a mistake
get away from the window
ill meet you around front
no you wont
you have to hear this
no i dont robert
the birthday was the one time
that he was weak
the one time
that he gave something away
robert i am calling the police
its arthur leigh allen
where did you get that name
he called the bellis house
december 69
i need to kill todays my birthday
it was his birthday
arthur leigh allen
was born on december 18th
get in here
here you go
thanks
he wrote me you know
2500 suspects
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was leigh allen
they like to help you know sometimes
yes robert i know
he was arrested january 1975
for molestation
he sent me that when he got out
dear dave if i can ever be
of any help to you just let me know
im sorry i wasnt your man
and its typewritten
using a typewriter is not a crime
and he knew darlene
its in the vallejo files
mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect
that you spent two years on him
and that nobody ever came close
all the evidence said no
sherwood disqualified his handwriting
the same sherwood
that drinks like paul avery now
yes you have sherwood morrill
in writing saying
im sorry this just wont work
but you also have terry pascoe
his protãgã
yeah fine its his protãgã
but hes a handwriting expert
nonetheless and hes saying
do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting
so the two cancel each other out
no they dont
it was sherwoods case
he was the head
of questioned documents
if it went to trial
all the defense would have to do
is call sherwood to the stand
and there was no way of getting allen
into court in the first place
because there was no evidence robert
what do you mean
theres no evidence
you have him seen with the ciphers
the military boot prints
the same size shoes and gloves
the most dangerous game
the zodiac watch
the background with school children
the misspellings of christmass
the bloody knives
all circumstantial
paul stines shirt his wallet his keys
we should have found
one of those things in that trailer
we didnt
thats
okay catherine allen states that
leigh cleaned out his trailer
on friday after work
and moved it to santa rosa
on saturday august 7th 1971
you interviewed him
at the refinery on august 4th
yeah
so hes cleaning out his trailer
hes moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him
okay okay
look at the stuff side by side dave
all right
okay arthur leigh allen
and the zodiac their timelines
when was the first murder in vallejo
christmas 1968
eight months before that
allen is fired for molesting his students
and his family discovers
that hes a pedophile
now when do the letters begin
july 69
after the murder of darlene ferrin
and they continue
until you go to see him at work
now after that do any of the letters
contain swatches of paul stines shirt
no because he dumped them
because he got scared
because he knew
that you were on to him
so whens the next letter from zodiac
not until january of 1974
he is silent for three years
then in 74 he feels comfortable again
because everybodys moved off
allen as a suspect
and what do we get
three new letters from zodiac
in january may and july in 74
but then the letters stop
what happens to allen
hes arrested
january 1975
they send him to atascadero
we dont get another letter from zodiac
the entire time hes there
when is he released
august 77
allen gets out he types you an apology
and then what
we get our first new zodiac letter
in four years
okay zodiac had to have known
darlene ferrin right
yes because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder
because of the vallejo file
we know that darlene knew
a man named leigh
yes
so all coincidence aside robert
how can you be sure that leigh allen
is the leigh from this file
now vallejo is a small town
but its not that small
how do you put
the two of them together
this is a case thats covered
both northern and southern california
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles
would you agree
yes
darlene ferrin worked
at the vallejo house of pancakes
on the corner of tennessee and caroll
arthur leigh allen lived in his
mothers basement on fresno street
door to door that is less than 50 yards
is that true
ive walked it
jesus christ
so
the prints the handwriting
im not asking you as a cop
but i am a cop
i cant prove this
just because you cant prove it
doesnt mean its not true
easy dirty harry
finish the book
thank you thank you for breakfast
can i help you
no
mr mageau
thanks for coming to see me
youre the one i talked to on the phone
im george bawart vallejo pd
i took over for jack mulanax
its been 22 years
