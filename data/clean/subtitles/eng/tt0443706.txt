paul  what s on the crime beat 
janice in datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked 
that s a crime 
have you seen her  wouldn t kid you 
it may be the beginning of a crime wave 
you need to see this 
go get the publisher 
 dear editor 
 this is the murderer
 of the two teenagers
last christmas at lake herman
 and the girl on the fourth of july
near the golf course in vallejo 
 to prove i killed them 
 i shall state some facts
which only i and the police know 
 christmas 
brand name of ammo  super x 
 ten shots were fired 
 the boy was on his back
with his feet to the car 
 the girl

 the girl was on her right side 
feet to the west 
 fourth of july 
 one  girl was
wearing patterned slacks 
 the boy was also shot in the knee 
 brand name of ammo was western 
 here is part of a cipher 
 the other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to the editors of
  the vallejo times and s f  examiner 
 i want you to print this cipher
on the front page of your paper 
 in this cipher is my identity 
 if you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of fry  
f r y   first of aug  69
i will go on a kill rampage fry night 
 i will cruise around all weekend
killing lone people in the night
 then move on to kill again
 until i end up with
a dozen people over the weekend   
it s unsigned except for a symbol 
is it me 
or does that look like a gunsight 
today s august first 
he wants his code
in the afternoon edition 
if the examiner doesn t have
the balls to run it  we scoop the bay 
al  this man is talking about
shooting 12 people 
and not running this
might make him do that 
if we run it  we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent 
oh  come on  now  it s newsworthy 
well  giving some sick bastard
a soapbox 
what does that say to people 
back up  is this vallejo story true 
do we know that 
 paul 
 what  i cover crime in vallejo 
yeah  i cover crime in vallejo 
ten minutes 
let s shoot the code and call sfpd 
if it turns out to be real 
at least we ll have the material 
all right 
graysmith 
don t you have that cartoon to finish 
oh  yeah 
hi  this is paul avery
from the san francisco chronicle 
i m looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received 
thank you 
sergeant mulanax 
sergeant  paul avery from
the san francisco chronicle 
i just wanted to check
if you had an unsolved
firearm related homicide
on christmas and
maybe one on july fourth 
shit 
you guys got one  too 
confirmed 
vpd  they confirmed the shootings 
al s on the phone with the examiner 
they got the same letter
with a different code 
so did times herald 
christmas  two teenagers
on lover s lane  both doa 
david faraday and betty jensen 
july fourth 
darlene ferrin and michael   
i think it s  mayhew   
anyway  he lived  she didn t 
the murder weapons 
ballistics  everything he said
in the letters matched 
i mean  i think the times herald s
gonna go with it 
the examiner s going 
but won t go front page 
i say let s go front page 
if he kills 12 people  it s not our fault 
robert  we need the cartoon 
 you re not finished 
 no  i m finished  carol  i m finished 
thieriot s still here 
really 
the first edition
is off the floor in 10  charles 
give us a sec 
okay  re plate 
we ll go on page    page four 
what do you say  20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho s name 
he won t give his name 
morti s  anyone 
 that s where i m heading 
 all right 
put those on my desk  turn on the light 
grab your book 
now go get your jammies on 
all right  people  listen up 
the cipher s broken into three sections 
each with eight lines and 17 symbols 
no breaks between the symbols
denoting different words 
no numbers or clues
to substitution keys 
and you got symbols
from at least seven different sources 
greek  morse code  navy semaphore 
weather symbols  astrological signs 
 hey  take a gander at this code thing 
 okay 
you wanna give it a go 
guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist  bob bastian 
now he s doing public television 
for some reason 
paul avery 
robert graysmith 
i ve been here nine months 
you were right  by the way 
he didn t give his name 
who cracked it 
a history teacher
and his wife in salinas 
 i like killing people
because it is so much fun 
 it is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest
 because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill 
 something gives me
the most thrilling experience 
 it is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl 
 the best part of it is that when i die 
 i will be reborn in paradise 
 and all that i have killed
will become my slaves 
 i will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down
 or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife   
methinks our friend s
a tad bit fuckered in the head 
i heard he even sent vallejo
a code key  just to help 
 what is that at the bottom 
 leftovers 
maybe an anagram 
how does one do that 
i like puzzles  i do them a lot 
how did you know
he wasn t gonna give his name 
dangerous animal 
dangerous animal 
what dangerous animal 
how do i know that 
 paul 
 yes  templeton 
 editorial  now 
 very well 
another letter 
more of the same 
details about the murders 
he taped a flashlight to the gun 
that s how he hit them in the dark 
and he gave himself a name 
you know this used to be
the town of montecello 
but at some point 
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake 
so they flooded it 
 but there s an entire   
 hidden city under the water 
we were here last spring  remember 
oh  yeah 
somebody else is here 
it is a public park 
i think he s watching us 
well  we re very good looking 
where d he go 
he went behind that tree 
all right  so he s taking a leak 
he s coming towards us 
oh  my god  he has a gun 
don t move 
 i want your money and your car keys 
 okay 
we re not gonna do anything  okay 
we re gonna cooperate 
just tell me what you want us to do 
here 
you re welcome to everything i have 
if there s anything else
i could do for you   
maybe i could write you a check 
okay  i could give you
my phone number 
you know  i might be able to help you 
even more than you might think 
he s a sociology major 
pre law  actually 
oh  keys 
you know  i m sorry  i don t know exactly
where i put my keys 
they might be on the blanket 
is it okay if   
here s the keys 
don t get up 
i want her to tie you up 
okay 
you know  if he comes any closer 
i might be able to get that gun 
 don t get any ideas 
 i m not 
i killed a guard
escaping from prison in montana 
i m not doing anything  okay 
i m not afraid to kill again 
look away 
what was the name of that prison 
hey  you said it was in montana  right 
i m taking your car 
i m going to mexico 
we didn t complain
when you tied our hands 
okay  you have everything that i have 
we have done everything
that you ve asked

get on your stomach
so i can tie your feet 
okay 
it gets really cold out here at night 
we could freeze 
okay  you all done

this is all gonna be okay 
dispatch  this is 43l2 
heading south on knoxville road 
i ve got an abandoned white
vw karmann ghia   
napa police department 
i want to report a murder 
no  a double murder 
they are two miles north
of park headquarters 
they were in a white
volkswagen karmann ghia 
i m the one that did it 
43l2 has a male victim with him 
piner s ambulance
has been dispatched 
boy lived  the girl didn t  again 
god  can you imagine
surviving something like that 
writing the dates on the side of the car 
we got two vallejo killings 
now there s one in napa  why napa 
what the hell is he doing out of vallejo 
sweet mother of christ 
what are you drawing 
kid at the lake 
this is what he said
the zodiac was wearing 
god  that s a hell of a get up 
 paul  what are you doing 
 hyman  i wrote it  it s done 
now i just got to type it up 
type it up 
it s not finished until you type it up 
we ve got to read it 
 what s that 
 that s the zodiac at the lake 
what s the story with the kid 
he seems a little touched
or medicated or   
 graysmith 
 yeah  what is it 
he s a fucking boy scout 
he doesn t smoke 
he doesn t drink  he doesn t curse 
 and he s back 
 i knew it 
 man is the most
dangerous animal of all   
i knew that
i heard that from somewhere 
the most dangerous game 
it s a movie about a count
who hunts people for sport 
people 
the most dangerous game 
 who s that 
 that s count zaroff 
zaroff  with a  z  
and that will be
all for the news on the 20 
we ve got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties 
napa  solano  contra costa 
alameda  marin  and san mateo 
so please  everyone  stay safe 
vic in san francisco  you re on the line 
you re not scared of the zodiac 
heck no 
he s only shooting those farm kids 
what scares me
is those hippies out in the haight
with their free love and weird clothes 
we ve got alfred from vacaville 
you know  i think
that was really offensive 
it s not just farm kids 
these are nice  clean cut young people 
hey  nobody s downplaying
the loss of human life here  alfred 
well  that last guy was 
we have good solid communities
out here in the north bay 
unlike in the city where you have
satanists running around 
well  you bring up a good question 
is the zodiac a satanist 
amber from oakland 
what do you think 
i don t really know 
but i thought that code
they printed didn t look very christian 
but i think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldn t have printed
anything that the zodiac
has been doing 
that they re just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers 
well  the zodiac did demand
they print his letters
or he d kill more people 
yeah  but he would have
done it anyway 
whether they printed it or not  i think 
an interesting point 
so  what do you think he ll do next 
 san francisco police department 
 yes  there s a fight in a cab 
what is your location 
3398 washington 
at the corner of cherry 
one s drunk and
we think he s robbing him 
 is the crime still in progress 
 yes  please hurry 
oh  my god  look 
nuts 
whoever this is 
you owe me a new lamp 
cabbie s been shot
three blocks from the presidio 
well  it wasn t me 
i ve been with my bride all night 
 she can vouch 
 go put on the folgers 
you ll pick me up 
let me just describe
the lamp you re gonna buy me 
 i just got to sleep 
 suspect s negro  male adult 
walt s on scene  locked up the cab
and secured the crowd 
seriously  dead asleep 
i lost feeling in my arm and everything 
crackers 
you ever try japanese food 
 what do you mean  like teriyaki 
 no  like the urchin 
 raw fish 
 i m eating here  bill 
 i always wanted to try it 
 so  why don t you 
haven t got around to it 
evening  gents  what a lovely night
for a botched robbery 
yeah  third this week 
must be end of summer rush 
i got foot patrols going through the park 
dogs are on the way 
the victim s name is paul stine 
dousette pronounced him at 10 10 
suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head 
driver s wallet
and car keys are missing 
how d you know his name 
leroy  there  came down
from yellow cab to id him 
neighborhood s pretty high end
for this kind of thing 
so i already set up transpo for the cab 
 coroner s here 
 any witnesses 
kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window 
 did they hear a shot 
 no 
they first saw him in the front seat 
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver 
oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room 
described him as a white male  glasses 
crew cut  stocky 
and wearing a dark jacket 
wait  i thought someone said
he was black 
that s the description
that went out to radio cars 
 we already corrected it 
 oh  well  that s good 
 you guys need anything else 
 no  get out of here 
thanks  happy birthday 
 wait  it s your birthday 
 yep 
 that s great  happy birthday 
 thanks 
 body or scene 
 it s your birthday  i ll take the body 
dave  looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good 
 we got some blood over here 
 prints 
could very well be 
we ll dust it at the hall 
the odd thing is  we also got gloves 
 suspect s 
 there s blood on them 
 hey  pete 
 yeah  dave 
you through over there 
can i get in there 
yeah  i m all set 
 who rolled him 
 stewarts 
i got a single 9mm casing 
yeah  luger 
nothing from the crowd 
okay 
i m your shooter  negro male adult 
who also happens to be
a stocky  crew cut caucasian 
i flag a cab  i give him this address 
did i give him this address 
who s got the fare book 
right here 
washington and maple 
that s one block east 
lighting s the same over here 
so maybe i see
someone walking their dog 
you don t want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block 
he pulls over 
i wait for him to put it in park
because i m smart
and i don t want him
hitting the accelerator
when i shoot him  may i 
he stops  puts it in park  boom 
i shoot him on the right side 
he slumps right 
maybe you ve got your hand
on his collar when you shoot 
all right  so  either way 
i just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat 
 so  why do you get in the front seat 
 for the money 
but he s dead 
you could just reach over the seat 
pull out his wallet 
you don t have to go
anywhere near the blood 
so  why d he get in the front seat 
 i m an idiot 
 but you re not an idiot 
you waited for him to put it in park 
 right  thank you 
 yeah  sure 
 can i see that 
 yeah 
i am an idiot 
i just killed a man for  8 25 
it s his third fare of the night 
does anyone have any animal crackers 
 animal crackers 
 they re in the car 
i m saving those for later 
fine 
 are you a reporter 
 no  i m inspector dave toschi  sfpd 
sir  i was wondering
if i d be able to talk to your children 
one at a time and preferably alone 
they just saw a man murdered 
i understand 
it looked like
they were drunk and fighting 
yeah  and he had a rag 
he came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff 
 did you get a chance to see his face 
 i did 
well  sort of 
did you remember what he looked like 
 normal 
 yeah 
 normal  
 this is the zodiac speaking 
 i am the murderer of the taxi driver
 over by washington street
and maple street last night 
 to prove this  here is
a blood stained piece of his shirt 
 i am the same man who did in
the people in the north bay area 
 the s f  police could have
caught me last night
 if they had searched the park properly
 instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles   
 gentlemen 
 dave 
paul  where s the shirt 
right there  boss 
there s your rag the kids talked about 
so he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt 
 is this on the record 
 well  what do you think 
he confirms
the vallejo and napa killings 
gets worse 
robert  do you have a deadline 
what does he mean  it gets worse 
read the last part 
 school children make nice targets 
 i think i shall wipe out
a school bus some morning 
 just shoot out the front tire
 and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out   
jesus christ  who s got school buses 
department of transportation 
 school board 
 all right 
i m gonna need elimination prints
from your staff

on my way back to my desk 
they have phones  if you want 
we need to get matches

i ll call napa and vallejo 
get the letters up to sherwood
in sacramento 
dave  just one thing 
is it true they got a print off the cab 
yeah  we got a partial in blood 
 but that is not for publication 
 hey  hey  come on 
hey  it s me 
did he say they got a print 
partial 
whoa 
dude  he wears his gun like bullitt

 cause i think zodiac s
gonna send another code 
jesus harold christ
on rubber crutches  bobby 
what are you doing 
you re doing that thing 
the thing we discussed 
the thing that i don t like 
starts with an  l  
 oh  looming 
 yeah 
in cooperation with sfpd 
we will run the zodiac letter
without including the threat
on school children 
we don t want to start a city wide panic
so i m asking all of you
to please keep this confidential 
just go about your daily business 
thank you 
i packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter  okay 
 dad  you don t have to wait with me 
 i know 
you know what  you know what 
i m gonna drive him today  okay 
come on 
what s that 
similarities in the lowercase  r s   
and that 
it is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again 
i have to concentrate 
sorry 
 sorry  counts as speaking 
there are similarities
in the lowercase  r s   
we have to release the bus threat 
 it ll screw us 
 we re already screwed 
we just went from
 routine cabbie shooting 
to  mass murderer targets kids   
the zodiac killer
has come to san francisco 
confirmation tonight 
from the san francisco
police department
that in his latest haunting letter 
which takes credit for the murder
of cab driver paul stine 
the zodiac has threatened to 
 wipe out a school bus
 and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out   
if you think you might know
who the zodiac is 
you can call the san francisco
police department s newest tip line 
press conference is at 4 00 
we got to give them something 
we re coordinating
with the school board 
and we expect
a break in the case very soon 
 what do we really got 
 we re swamped 
when they can t get anyone
on the tip line
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through 
you got any hard suspects 
about 90 an hour  i m up to around 500 
well  can t you narrow it down 
i would love to 
if i could get out of this   
 homicide  please hold 
 yeah  hold  please 
we re gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this 
how many men can you give me 
well  right now  it s you and bill
and monday s a school day 
yeah  i know  chief 
i have three daughters of my own 
yeah  i know  where s armstrong 
he s on the phone with vallejo 
we re playing catch up  jack 
i d like to set up a meeting
with your survivor  michael mageau 
i can t  he skipped town 
the only guy who s seen zodiac
without a mask is missing 
when he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long 
as soon as he got out  he split 
really  why 
i don t think he wanted
to have anything to do with this 
can you send us everything
that you have 
well  the road goes both ways 
now  we need that print
you lifted from the cab
and we should have been in
on the handwriting 
i apologize 
things have been moving fast 
who should i talk to in napa
so we can coordinate 
talk to ken narlow 
we really should have been in
on the handwriting 
i apologize 
things have been moving fast 
listen  we re gonna need
your scene photos 
can t help you 
ken  i don t want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here 
no  no  no  no  no 
we didn t have a crime scene 
the ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket 
all we have are the wing walker prints 
the what 
boot prints to and from the crime scene
were made by size
10 and a half wing walkers 
military style boots
sold only at military pxs
designed to walk
on the wings of planes 
and you can t buy at a px
without a military id 
so our suspect could be military 
did you guys narrow your list off of this 
 yeah 
 did vallejo 
i don t know  i don t work in vallejo 
i work here 
great  i m gonna need photos
of those boot prints 
sure  if you send me the handwriting 
i thought questioned documents
already did 
nope  vallejo s got them  not us 
all right 
i ll have questioned documents   
forget it  i ll telefax it to you 
we don t have telefax yet 
 okay  i ll put it in the mail 
 we ll mail ours  too 
and call mulanax in vallejo 
 maybe he can get you a mimeo 
 right 
why don t you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast 
we d have to wait 
because they don t have a fax 
we don t have a fax  either 
look  i m just trying
to get us coordinated 
have you called solano sheriff s office 
why would i call solano 
because the two kids that got killed
last christmas were solano s 
i thought they were vallejo 
no  they were over the county line
so you re gonna need
to coordinate with them  too 
okay 
bill 
can i have a word with you 
where did you see this guy 
we got the call to circle the scene
and look for a negro male adult 
where was he 
on jackson  heading east 
about the middle of the block 
and this is three minutes
after the shooting 
give or take  yeah 
 and you were heading east or west 
 we were going west 
all right  so you re
on jackson going west 
so the cab was one block
catty corner southwest 
 correct 
 did you slow down 
 of course we slowed down 
 all right 
listen  dispatch said
it was a negro male 
that was corrected 
no  but at the time
they hadn t changed it 
this guy was white 
right  not in a hurry 
kind of lumbering along like   
lumbering 
what do you mean   lumbering  
 shuffling 
 stocky  had a crew cut 
yeah  that s all correct 
listen  it was dark 
the guy was wearing a dark jacket 
there s no way   
he would have been covered in blood 
did you stop him 
did you talk to him 
 yes  no 
 no 
you need to get with a sketch artist 
we have to put out
a new composite right away 
five persons have been murdered
in the san francisco area 
and in each case the killer   
 i shall wipe out a school bus
some morning     
san francisco police   
   to see the stones in concert
this sunday 
the new letters
from the zodiac killer were sent to
the city room of the
san francisco chronicle 
one of the letters was   
looming  no looming 
 have you considered the water theory 
 what 
geographically  every attack
takes place near a body of water
 or a water based name 
 this is your water theory 
lake berryessa  blue rock springs 
 lake herman 
 wash ington and cherry 
you think 
no 
i m reading this book 
homicide investigation
by lemoyne snyder   
  leymone   
     and he says you look for patterns 
 so i m looking for patterns 
 no 
you can t think of this case
in normal police terms 
 why not 
 you got four crime scenes 
solano  vallejo  berryessa  and here 
not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters 
how does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent 
i mean  assuming the gloves are his 
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off 
so it s not his print 
maybe  maybe not 
you re missing the point 
 the point is the first attack   
 david faraday and betty jensen 
they both die 
from there on out 
he only manages to kill the girls 
 not for lack of trying 
 not for lack of trying 
mageau lives  ferrin dies 
hartnell lives  shepard dies 
he gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men 
plus  they re all couples
and all on lover s lanes 
 paul stine is not 
 exactly 
single  male cab driver
on washington and cherry doesn t fit 
doesn t fit 
so  why does zodiac kill him 
he s breaking the pattern 
yeah 
someone claiming to be zodiac
called oakland pd a half hour ago 
he says he s gonna call in on jim
dunbar s morning show in three hours 
on television 
he wants melvin belli on
to counsel him 
all right  all right 
let s go wake up melvin

 good morning  melvin 
 good morning  jim 
so  the phone lines are open 
mr  belli is here 
here to help  jim 
yes  here to help 
and we ask the public not to call in 
so that the zodiac himself can reach us 
i saw your star trek  by the way 
it was excellent 
a shame about the show 
good people 
you know  i ve often thought of
becoming an actor full time 
what was your character s name 
 gorgon 
 gorgon  that s right 
roll the tape  get the tape 
jim  we have a call  we re going live 
hello 
hello  this is melvin belli 
who am i speaking with 
this is the zodiac speaking 
is there something i can call you
that s a little less ominous 
sam 
is there somewhere we can meet  sam 
and talk about this 
meet me on top of the fairmont hotel 
without anyone else or i ll jump   
have a unit go to the fairmont hotel 
 sam 
 yes 
do you think you need medical care 
medical  not mental 
do you have health problems 
i m sick  i have headaches 
headaches 
i have headaches  too 
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago 
i think i can help you  sam 
sam 
he knows they re tracing his calls 
sam  we d like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls 
it s a long  difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls 
sam 
we re not tracing these calls 
you have my word 
okay 
sam  you need to tell me
what your problem is 
i don t want to go to the gas chamber 
i have headaches 
i kill  i don t get them 
that is fucked up 
you want to live  don t you 
well  this is your passport 
how long have you been
having these headaches 
since i killed a kid 
 do you have blackouts 
 yes 
 do you have fits 
 no  i just have headaches 
did you attempt to call one other time
when f  lee bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago 
yes 
and why did you want
to talk to mr  bailey 
why do you wanna talk to me  sam 
 i don t want to be hurt 
 why is he calling 
 hey  just a second  buddy 
 i don t wanna go to the gas chamber 
you won t get hurt if you talk to me 
and you re not going
to the gas chamber 
i wouldn t think they would ask
for capital punishment 
we should ask the district attorney 
do you want me to do that  sam 
do you want me to talk
to the district attorney 
what was that  sam 
i did not say anything 
we heard a scream 
that was my headache 
you sound like you re in
a great deal of pain 
my head aches  i m so sick 
i m gonna kill them 
 oh  okay 
 i m gonna kill those kids 
fantastic 
sam 
 let s meet and talk  just us 
 okay 
how about old st  mary s church
in chinatown 
no 
in front of the daly city
st  vincent de paul at 10 30 
i ll see you there 
take care of yourself  sam 
my  my  my 
you fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting 
you know  the problem is 
i don t want to go to the gas chamber 
i have headaches 
i kill  i don t get them 
no  it s not him 
it s the voice 
the voice is too high  it s too young 
all right 
thanks for coming down  bryan 
do you have blackouts 
that s okay  i got it 
they pulled off the trace 
our daly city no show
called from a mental institution 
oakland pd s operator is sure
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice 
calmer 
might have actually been him 
 so i shall change
my way of collecting slaves 
 i shall no longer announce to anyone
when i commit my murders 
 they shall look like routine robberies 
killings of anger
 and a few fake accidents  et cetera 
 the police shall never catch me
 because i have been
too clever for them 
 i look like the description passed out
only when i do my thing 
 the rest of the time
i look entirely different 
 i shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when i kill 
 as of yet i have left no
fingerprints behind me 
 contrary to what the police say 
 i wear transparent fingertips 
 all it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips 
 i enjoy needling the blue pigs 
hey  blue pig  i was in the park 
 you were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars 
 hey  pig  doesn t it rile you up
 to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos 
 if you cops think i am going to take
on a bus the way i stated i was 
 you deserve to have holes
in your heads   
and you need to look at this 
 take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer 
 one gallon of stove oil 
 and dump a few bags
of gravel on top     
 okay 
 it s a bomb 
okay  we gotta call the army
and see if this
science experiment could actually work 
another cipher 
 when did these arrive 
 they arrived this morning 
are you planning to publish 
robert 
we should have a drink 
thank you 
so  tell me about yourself 
 you married 
 divorced  two kids 
what do you do for fun 
i love to read 
 i enjoy books 
 those are the same things 
why you been going through my trash 
i ll come back to that 
how did you know
he was gonna send another code 
i just guessed 
 just guessed 
 the first one seemed too easy 
all right  this can no longer be ignored 
 what is that you re drinking 
 it s an aqua velva 
you wouldn t make fun of it
if you tried it 
but who actually cracked the code 
a married couple who like puzzles 
so what s that tell us about the zodiac 
 he s no expert 
 right 
it s just a simple substitution code
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts 
 a  is one   b  is two 
we weren t all boy scouts  robert 
well  it s not that hard 
you just got to know where to start 
in the first cipher   
you actually carry that around with you 
 why 
 no reason 
what s the most common double
consonant in the english language 
consonant 
 the double  l  
 double  l  
and what s the one word that we know
that he ll use in here  at least once 
  kill   
 right   kill   
so the hardens start looking
for double symbols 
which they find here  here  and here 
each with the same
two symbols preceding them 
so now they ve got
a repeating four letter word
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for  l  
and since they think the whole word
is  kill  then   
then you got your  k   you got your  i  
and you re on your way 
but how do you go
from  a  is one and  b  is two
to figuring out this whole code 
well  same way i did 
you go to the library 
in this book 
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface 
eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher 
yeah  but there are non letter symbols
because there s all
these medieval ones 
i thought they looked medieval  too 
but then i found a code
written in the middle ages 
guess what it s called 
the zodiac alphabet 
jesus 
what do you want out of this 
 what 
 what s your angle 
this is good business
for everyone but you 
how do you mean  business  
hey  come to bed 
i ll be up in a minute 
i need to make a phone call 
 hello 
 bill 
there s not many basements
in california 
 basement for future use   
that s right 
i ll have vallejo and napa
check with their city planners 
 get some sleep 
 yeah  sure 
 dear melvin 
this is the zodiac speaking 
 i wish you a happy christmas 
 the one thing i ask of you is this 
please help me 
 i cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won t let me   
thank you 
 i am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check
 and i am afraid i will lose control again
 and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim   
melvin  he s reaching out to you 
absolutely 
inspectors  he sent this letter
directly to my residence 
it is a cry for help 
intended as a private communiquã  
which is why
you contacted the chronicle 
the people have a right to know 
toddy 
 when did the letter arrive 
 in the middle of last week 
i was away on safari 
what did you gentlemen
do for christmas 
 you re looking at it 
 you must see africa 
cradle of civilization 
fascinating people  beautiful  savage 
 back to the killer who wrote to you 
 yes  of course 
it is my belief
that he only penned this letter
because he couldn t get through to me
on the dunbar show or here 
 he tried to contact you here 
 several times 
i was out 
but he spoke with my housekeeper 
didn t leave a number 
he s kind of crafty like that 
do you mind if i speak to her 
not at all  but the real story is the letter 
 i ll be back 
 yeah 
she s right this way 
inspector toschi  it is my belief
this is a window into this man s soul 
killing is his compulsion 
even though he tries to ignore it 
it drives him 
it s in his blood 
could be 
or maybe he just likes the attention 
i didn t mean to scare you 
but your right rear wheel is loose 
really 
if you like 
i could tighten the lugs up for you 
if you don t mind 
well  you can t be too careful 
 all done 
 thank you 
no problem  have a good night 
it s okay 
are you okay 
yeah  yeah  we re fine 
must have been worse than i thought 
i can give you a lift to a service station 
okay 
it s okay  come on 
i didn t know you had a baby 
oh  is that okay 
the more the merrier 
you shouldn t smoke  it s a bad habit 
 i think we just passed a filling station 
 it was closed 
do you always go around
helping people in the night 
when i m done with them 
they don t need much help 
it s okay 
before i kill you 
i m gonna throw your baby
out the window 
no  help  please  no 
she was on the side of the road 
she flagged me down 
 what happened to her 
 she said she jumped from a car 
i found her like this 
 what is it 
 please  he said   
 it ll be okay 
 tried to kill me 
my baby 
 where s her baby 
 she didn t have one when i stopped 
where s your baby 
jesus 
 you hid it 
 in case he came back 
 this is the zodiac speaking 
 by the way  have you cracked
the last cipher i sent you 
 i m mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now 
 i hope you do not think i was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie
 with a bomb at the cop station 
 even though i talked about
killing children with one   
 this is the zodiac speaking 
 i d like to see some nice zodiac
buttons wandering around town 
 everyone else has these buttons
 like peace  black power 
and melvin eats blubber  et cetera 
 it would cheer me up considerably
 if i saw a lot of people
wearing my button 
  please no nasty ones   
  this is the zodiac speaking 
 i shot a man
sitting in a parked car with a  38 
 zodiac 12  sfpd zero   
 the map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set 
 you have until next fall to dig it up   
 this is the zodiac speaking 
 i m rather unhappy because you people
 will not wear
some nice zodiac buttons 
 so  i now have a little list 
starting with the woman and her baby
 that i gave a rather interesting ride
 for a couple of hours one evening 
a few months back 
 that ended in my burning her car
where i found them   
we re really not gonna run
any more of his letters 
the new policy  our brothers in blue
want us to hold back
and see how he reacts 
four letters in three months 
and this is the first mention
of kathleen johns  that s very weird 
that s because he s full of shit 
what do you mean 
you don t know 
welcome  please put your stuff down 
you re going down five rows and left 
looking for the modesto bee
from march 
i m going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit 
 left 
 left 
 what am i looking for 
 kathleen johns 
also probably you wanna
pull the chron from   
you know  never mind  i ll see to that 
okay  look at this letter again 
the part about kathleen johns 
tell me what facts he gives 
 a woman and her baby abducted 
 fact 
 the car on fire 
 okay  now 
look at the article from the bee 
seen it yet 
everything in the letter
already appeared in the article 
and he s done it before 
officer richard radetich 
shot sitting in his car 
zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car 
couple days after this article came out 
the police already had somebody
in custody 
zodiac didn t do it 
but took credit for it anyway
because he s in it for the press 
he even stole his symbol 
 what 
 yeah  shit 
if i show you something 
you promise not to tell anyone 
 who would i tell 
 okay  totally solid point  okay 
that s the only place
that word and that symbol
ever appeared together
before the letters 
the guy stole his logo off a watch 
how can somebody
who s killed 13 people do   
he claims he s killed 13 people 
but which ones
can we actually confirm 
there s three in vallejo 
one in berryessa  the cabbie  that s it 
bobby  you almost look disappointed 
chief s pulling everybody off buses 
business as usual 
something ll shake loose 
not a peep in four months 
first he won t shut up and now   
maybe we drove him underground 
maybe he s gone 
311 at 582 haight  cross at biltmore 
there s a male   
 happy birthday  bill 
 thanks 
does it ever bother you
that people call you shorty 
does it bother you
that people call you a retard 
 nobody calls me that 
 right 
as governor 
i pledge to use all my influence
to make sure that darlene ferrin s killer
is brought to justice 
i believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of darlene ferrin 
 i believe her murder was premeditated 
 who is that 
florence douglas  mayor of vallejo 
she s running for governor 
i believe that the police department
either did not have the money  the time
or  yes  the inclination   
sayonara  police endorsement 
good work  flo 
does anyone ever call me names  or   
you mean like retard 
yeah 
no 
shit  fuck  oh  my god  jesus 
tell me that s not a piece
of bloody shirt 
fuck  holy fucking crap 
 i feel it in my bones 
you ache to know my name
 and so i ll clue you in 
 but then  why spoil the game 
happy halloween   
paul  you did call him
a latent homosexual
in at least one of your articles 
dave  i want a gun 
a gun 
you re in herb caen 
 paul avery s investigation
has won him the accolade
 of a message from the zodiac warning 
 you are doomed   
 as a result  several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading 
  i am not paul avery    
you should sell these 
you could do well 
it s been a windfall  since
they published the threat on my life 
i got the leads
coming out of the woodwork 
there s one guy down in riverside 
i m gonna drive down
and see him tonight 
 you wanna tag along 
 no  i have a date 
 really 
 who is this guy 
he wishes to remain anonymous 
i wish to remain infamous 
so we re going to get along great 
hi  good evening  hi 
i m looking for a melanie

 i m working with   
 do you know who paul avery is

well  i work near him
and he s going down tonight
to track an anonymous tipster
down in riverside 
where is riverside 
it s near l a 
oh  wow  i don t think paul knows
that it s that far away 
sounds kind of dangerous 
yeah  how do you mean 
well  you said it was
an anonymous tip  right

when you were saying that the zodiac   
you know  when you said it
was dangerous  i just thought
 that it is dangerous  and it s

i ve ever had 
 paul 
 robert 
 yes 
 you sitting down 
yes 
you re not gonna believe this 
dave 
in a bizarre twist 
the hunted has become hunter 
san francisco chronicle reporter
and zodiac target paul avery
claims to have uncovered
new information
regarding the only unsolved homicide
in riverside county s history 
a 1966 southern california murder 
that avery now believes
was the zodiac s first victim 
what 
 he didn t call you about this 
 hang on 
the riverside killer
wrote to the press letters
that i then took personally to
the office of questioned documents 
and what did this expert tell you 
what i knew in my gut  ron 
the handwriting matches zodiac s 
how d he get the evidence
out of riverside 
he took it to sherwood
without telling us  the son of a bitch 
you know how bad this looks 
hey  how do we know
that this lead is real 
it s very real  you know how i know 
because i saw it on tv 
excuse me 
dave 
hi 
dave  you know mel nicolai 
he s working the case for justice 
good to see you  mel 
all due respect 
can someone explain to me
why i m reading
about breaks in this case
in the chronicle instead
of getting calls from you 
we got screwed 
dave  come on 
you do get your name in the paper a lot 
people talk 
i don t ever talk about an open
investigation  period  okay  ken 
dave  hey  hi 
paul avery  can i catch a ride
with you gents when we get there 
not a good idea  paul 
he s gonna make me take a cab
when we re going to the same place 
ladies and gentlemen 
thank you for choosing psa 
 fair enough  fair enough 
 please take your seats at this time 
remember  smoking is
in the last six aisles only 
enjoy your flight 
 cross  hi 
 yeah 
 detective david toschi  sfpd 
 how are you doing 
great  thanks for having us
down today 
not at all 
i hear you have some files for us 
i ll show you mine  you show me yours 
 frisco huh 
 that s right  san francisco 
 ken narlow from napa 
 ken 
 mel nicolai  justice 
 mel 
here s what we know 
cheri jo bates attended
riverside community college 
she studies in the library
the night of october 30th  1966 
she leaves with an unidentified male
at closing  9 00 p  m 
her body s found the next morning
in a parking lot  stabbed to death 
her car is disabled 
someone cut the coil in the distributor 
the battery died 
the someone comes back 
offers to help 
 like kathleen johns 
 who 
a woman outside of modesto 
might be a zodiac victim 
might  might be 
i have her comp right here in this file 
okay 
a typewritten confession was sent
to the riverside press enterprise
on november 29th 
a month after bates s murder 
they ran it 
 i m not sick  i am insane 
but that will not stop the game 
 this letter should be published
for all to read   
he wants to be published 
he calls it a game 
i mean  this could be our boy 
six months later  the police 
the girl s father  and the paper 
they all received these 
double postage  just like zodiac 
these are what sherwood morrill
matched to the zodiac letters 
these and the desktop  don 
this was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in rcc storage 
sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood 
who etches in their own handwriting 
to be honest with you 
our letters and your letters 
i don t see it 
how did paul avery
get his hands on the exemplars 
i gave them to him 
we talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour 
and i told him you were gonna be here 
 you told him we were meeting 
 yeah 
i also told him
we don t think this is zodiac 
okay  wait a minute 
 you don t think this is zodiac 
 we got a guy we like for it 
we don t have enough
to pin it on him yet 
but we re pretty sure it s him 
if you don t think this is zodiac 
then why give anything to avery 
i m trying to cooperate 
oh  that s how you cooperate 
by giving information to reporters 
look  i don t know
about the handwriting 
but sherwood says it s a match  right 
so  let s just say
that your guy did cheri jo 
he types the confession 
zodiac reads it in the paper 
and he writes a letter taking credit for it 
now  that s something he s done before 
look  now you have everything we have 
but  in my opinion 
you guys came south for nothing 
fubar  gentlemen  fubar 
i don t care what he says 
this still could be z 
the problem is
the entire state already thinks it is 
well  there s your press agent 
talk to him about it 
i come in peace 
i don t want any trouble 
i really don t want to talk to you
right now  paul  not now 
 just trying to do my job 
 oh  really  well  now i can t do mine 
we re already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing 
and you just freaked out the entire state 
i have got napa  vallejo  and doj
looking at me sideways
and riverside s telling me
i m on a snipe hunt 
jesus  hey  cheri jo bates was a gift 
i gave that to you 
you and armstrong
never would have found her 
this may not be zodiac 
does that matter to you 
 what if it is 
 does it matter that riverside may not
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you 
tell it to sherwood 
i m out here  beating the bushes 
trying to draw him out 
we re in this together 
no  we re not in anything together  paul 
because i m not interested
in upping my circulation 
oh  boy  he wrote me 
he threatened my life 
hey  bullitt 
been a year and a half 
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not 
 go fuck yourself 
 happily 
you should have called me  paul 
thank you 
 did you see this 
 unfortunately  yes 
here comes every lunatic in california 
i m the zodiac 
and how did you kill your victims 
with a gun  no  with a hammer 
all i m authorized to tell you
is that he s still under
government employment 
 and who authorized you to tell me this 
 that s all i m authorized to say 
only a little rat bastard like andre
could have done something
like cut off all the victims  hands 
zodiac didn t cut off
any of the victims  hands 
 are you sure 
 yes  sir 
travis and i worked here
side by side for 10 years 
his foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin 
 coincidence 
 i don t know 
you re a cop  man  do the math 
have you considered
the killer might be paul avery 
frequently 
he was drinking coors 
getting a load on 
starts talking about hunting people 
like that book 
says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun
to use as a sight in the dark 
 he said that 
 yeah 
so i asked him 
 how would you get away with it  
and he said   it would be easy
  cause there d be no real motive
to the thing   
then he said he d write letters
to the police
and call himself zodiac
to mess with them 
leigh liked messing with people 
 you re positive he said  zodiac  
 yeah 
i thought it was a stupid name 
so i told him 
he got up all upset and said 
 i don t care what you think 
 i ve thought about it a long time
and that s the name i m gonna use   
did you feel like he d been
thinking about it a long time 
he was raw about losing his job
at the school 
he talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus
and picking off the little darlings 
 he actually used those words 
 that s what made me remember 
afterwards  i told my wife
i didn t wanna see him again 
and i haven t since 
other thing is  leigh s into skin diving 
i know he s been up to that lake
a bunch of times 
lake berryessa 
did you ever go with him 
couple times  we went fishing
by putah creek near there 
tell him when you put it together 
about a year ago  in the paper 
there was a story about the zodiac 
and it all comes back 
i tried to call the local cops 
they blew him off 
thought he was a nut 
and you re sure
the conversation you had about zodiac
took place on january 1 st  1968 
it couldn t have been any later 
i started a new job in l a 
on january 20th 
i had to move 
 this is my problem  this guy   
 arthur leigh allen 
this guy  leigh 
just lays out his entire evil plan
to a fishing buddy on new year s day 
i don t know 
he s angry  he s been drinking 
been thinking about it for a while 
i can buy that 
so why didn t cheney
contact us sooner 
i checked  he did 
first recorded contact
with the police department about allen
was in pomona  january 1 oth  1970 
he just got lost in the shuffle 
did cheney have anything
against allen 
did allen screw his wife or anything 
we re gonna do
a full background check 
but i got to tell you  i like this guy 
so  let s pull
some handwriting samples 
hi  i talked to sherwood 
he got the samples 
 what are you having 
 blt 
so  the check stubs are a wash 
there s not enough handwriting 
the application s got more 
but it doesn t look like z s 
so he can t rule him in 
but he can t rule him out  either 
 well  that s vague 
 he needs more samples 
also  our guy is a pervert 
when mel got the application
from valley springs 
they told him that
allen had been fired for touching kids 
 touching 
 polite euphemism 
 so what do you want to do 
 make some phone calls 
 are you done with the fries 
 go ahead 
did you and mr  cheney have a chance
to look at the copies
of the zodiac letters we sent you 
yeah 
some of this stuff is pretty creepy 
 yeah  we know that 
 i mean  creepy like leigh 
he misspells words like that 
he thinks it s funny 
what about the handwriting 
i don t know 
don t you have experts for that stuff 
our man at questioned documents
says it s inconclusive 
maybe he did it with his other hand 
the letters are a little too neat
for someone to have written
with the wrong hand 
but not for leigh  right 
 what do you mean 
 he s ambidextrous 
he can write with either hand 
didn t you guys know that 
in everyday life  allen uses his left hand 
job applications 
letters to friends  et cetera 
but he writes the zodiac letters
with his right hand
producing a different handwriting
that he can t be linked to 
we got to see this guy  chief 
 where is he 
 vallejo 
he works at union oil in pinole 
his brother s up there  too 
see them both 
make sure you call mulanax 
it is his backyard 
oh  right  because that
worked so well for us in riverside 
cooperation  that s us  at all costs 
you can talk to him in here 
coke machine s busted  by the way 
i ll go get him for you 
so how do you guys wanna do this 
well  bill talked to the informants 
he leads  we follow 
it s okay by me 
mr  allen  i m inspector bill armstrong 
this is inspector dave toschi
and sergeant jack mulanax 
we re investigating the zodiac murders
in san francisco and vallejo 
please  sit down 
the informant notified us
that you made certain statements
11 months prior
to the first zodiac murder 
if they re true 
they re quite incriminating 
do you recall
having any such conversation 
 no 
 have you ever read
or heard anything about the zodiac 
when it was first in the paper 
but i didn t follow it
after those first reports 
 why not 
 too morbid  i   
i told all this to the other officer 
 which other officer 
 from vallejo 
do you remember his name 
no  but it was right after
the murder at the lake 
and what did you tell this officer 
i told him that i d gone to salt point
that weekend to skin dive 
that i was alone
but i met a couple there 
i have their names at home
if you want them 
that would be great  arthur 
 leigh 
 what 
leigh  nobody calls me arthur 
also  that day when i came home 
my neighbor saw me 
it was around 4 00 
but i forgot to tell the other officer that 
 neighbor s name 
 bill white 
he died a week or so afterwards 
heart attack 
so i didn t think to call to follow up 
the knives i had in my car
with the blood on them 
that blood came from a chicken
that i killed for dinner 
 what 
 i had knives in my car that weekend 
maybe bill saw them
and called the other officer on me 
well  we ll be checking in on that 
well  let me ask you something else 
were you ever in southern california
at any time in 1966 
 is this about the riverside killing 
 yes 
well  i guess i was there
around that time 
i used to go down there a lot 
i like the auto races 
informant says that
you re ambidextrous 
no  that s untrue 
you can t write with both hands 
my teachers tried to make me
when i was a kid  but i couldn t 
i m left handed 
he also said that you made statements
about killing school children 
that is   
that is horrible  that is   
that s a horrible thing to say 
so  you weren t angry
about being fired from valley springs
for touching your students 
i m not the zodiac 
and if i was  i certainly wouldn t tell you 
that s a nice watch 
thank you 
may i see it 
may i see it 
where d you get it 
it was a christmas gift
from my mother two years ago 
that s very sweet 
so  tell me something  arthur 
you don t remember anyone
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the zodiac 
maybe ted kidder or phil tucker
at vallejo recreation 
but i couldn t be positive 
i used to work there when   
the most dangerous game 
what 
the most dangerous game 
that s why you re here  isn t it 
it was my favorite book in high school 
it s about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island 
because he was
tired of hunting animals 
he hunted the people for the challenge 
and man is the most
dangerous animal of all 
that s the whole point of the story 
great book 
or  at least  that s what i told phil 
may i go 
sure 
 thanks for your time 
 i m willing to help in any way possible 
i look forward to the day
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs 
thanks 
we ll be in touch 
so does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation 
these are copies of some
of the zodiac letters that were sent 
we d like you to take a look at them 
you think my brother s the zodiac 
well  we re looking at him 
are you going to arrest him 
mrs  allen  we don t arrest people
just because we re interested in them 
well  leigh s always been troubled 
is it true about the children 
unfortunately 
we don t see him much anymore
since we found out 
what are your feelings
about don cheney 
don cheney  my old roommate 
 was he the one who contacted you 
 that s confidential 
well  don s a very reliable guy 
if he were to tell you something 
i d believe it to be true 
 this one 
 what about it 
here  where he spells
 christmas  with two  s s   
we got a christmas card from leigh
a couple years ago 
he spelled it the exact same way 
christ mass 
 would you still have that 
 i can look for it 
thank you  that d be great 
is there anything else
we can do to help 
the brother said
he would search leigh s apartment
next time he went out of town 
 that gets you around a warrant 
 for the time being 
if we do find something 
mulanax will go to the da in vallejo 
and we could search the place properly 
now i got a chance to talk to the cop
who interviewed leigh allen
two days after the berryessa murders 
doesn t remember how he got onto him 
but didn t think he looked like a killer
so he didn t like him for z 
 but you do 
 i wish i could ve taken the guy in there 
take it slow  dave 
try and find more stuff for sherwood 
a match ll get us farther
on the warrants 
 avery s on two 
 tell him to screw 
you want me to communicate that
verbatim or can i spice it up a little 
christ  kid 
yeah 
 paul  i ve been thinking   
 oh  god save us all 
the letter to melvin belli
was sent exactly one year
after the lake herman road murder 
and the one to cheri jo bates  father
was sent exactly six months
after her death 
 she was killed a day before halloween 
 yeah 
and you received a halloween card   
you know  these are all fascinating
pieces of news  robert 
it s a bit early in the day 
paul  it s 11 00 and we missed editorial 
 i m sorry  i didn t mean to wake you up 
 no  no  no 
 i just thought that   
 no  no  no 
this suspect is not your zodiac 
this sample matches the canceled
checks and the application 
perfectly 
so we ve just retested the left hand 
i mean  we know he s ambidextrous 
in 38 years  i ve never seen anyone
that ambidextrous 
both hands would have commonalities 
i m sorry 
just not gonna work 
 homicide  toschi 
 dave  it s jack mulanax 
hey  mulanax  yeah 
we struck out with the judge 
he won t sign off on a warrant
for allen s house 
 why not 
 said it wasn t enough 
now  unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that   
how are we gonna get evidence
if we can t toss the house 
i don t know 
 i truly am sorry 
 no  no  thank you  jack 
what do you wanna do 
don t know what i can do
without vallejo 
we need allen s right hand 
we can t get it without a warrant 
are there other guys
you should be looking at 
only  what 
twenty three hundred 
okay  then 
okay  then 
paul  you wrote the justice department
asking to be put in charge
of the zodiac investigation 
i merely suggested   
on our letterhead 
   that those with intimate knowledge
of the case
create an information clearinghouse
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas 
 and that you run it 
 well  who better than me 
the marked man 
paul  if you want to work here 
i need three things 
one  stop boozing 
two  stop doing
whatever else it is you re doing 
and three  cut this nonsense out 
sweetest of templetons  if at any time
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag 
i ll more than happily   
more than happily
decamp for greener pastures 
paul  i mean it 
 paul 
 yep 
 what was that 
 an editorial tãªte ã  tãªte 
 wanna grab a drink 
 it s 10 00 in the morning 
late breakfast 
 early lunch  or   
 paul 
are you okay 
no 
thank you for asking 
shorty  let s go out for one 
paul  where are you going 
so  you moved off my brother in law 
we couldn t get a warrant 
last year we arranged for leigh
to get help from a social worker 
he only went twice 
we saw him recently for
the first time in nine months 
my mother in law brought him by
to see the new baby 
after he left 
i went to see that social worker 
he couldn t talk about a former patient 
so i just asked him straight out
if he thought leigh
was capable of killing people 
 because of patient confidentiality   
 the man said yes 
why hadn t you seen him
in nine months 
he s going to school in santa rosa 
 santa rosa  where is he living 
 in his trailer 
 in santa rosa 
 sonoma county 
we wouldn t have to go
through the vallejo da 
it s been 11 months
since you talked to this guy 
and now you wanna search his trailer 
if we find something  great 
if not  we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands 
i thought sherwood shut you down 
what if i can get a second opinion 
i don t wanna step on sherwood s toes 
he trained me at this 
terry  all i need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous 
could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand 
between you and me 
because there are differing
schools of thought on this 
get the samples of his other hand 
if he s the zodiac  you ll get a match 
that s the current thinking 
according to terry pascoe 
meanwhile  i spoke to a psychologist
who d be willing to testify
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like zodiac
would manifest it physically 
altering his handwriting 
which is why sherwood couldn t
get a match from allen s samples 
we got terry pascoe 
this psychology guy 
coupled with cheney   
it could be enough for a warrant 
get cheney on the record 
 and that he would call himself zodiac   
yes 
and you re willing to swear
to this  under oath  in superior court 
without any hesitation 
thank you very much  mr  cheney 
thank you very much for your time 
thank you 
suspect is arthur leigh allen 
lives in sunset trailer court
in santa rosa  california 
physical description 
allen is similar in height 
weight and build
to a man seen at lake berryessa
on the day of the stabbings 
i understand he doesn t look
much like the san francisco composite 
true  height and weight are sketchy 
but lumbering caucasian
with a crew cut is right on 
we never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids 
the patrolman
who saw zodiac that night
said he didn t look much like the sketch 
military boot prints 
allen was in the navy 
wears a size 10 and a half 
same size as the prints
found at berryessa 
what about gun 
cheney says allen owns several
firearms  we ll list them in the warrant 
 and the ciphers 
 could be code training in the navy 
and people have seen allen
with ciphers in the past 
really  who 
that would be his sister in law
and a man named phil tucker
that he worked with
at a public pool in vallejo 
and phil tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with allen
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun 
that gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight 
what about his threats on children 
suspect worked for elementary schools
and was fired for molestation
in march  april  68 
 could give him motive 
 at the very least  it s home turf 
he d have knowledge of bus routes 
which the two major threats
centered around 
what about the bomb 
allen works as a chemist 
take him through the geography 
vallejo murders 
allen lives in vallejo
with his mother in her basement 
berryessa murder  on the day
that the two kids were stabbed
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken 
does he have any alibis 
he claimed he did  but he s been unable
to produce the names
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of berryessa 
the bottom line is that allen
can t alibi up on anything 
riverside  vallejo  the lake or us 
 you want to tell me about the name 
 what name 
zodiac 
allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol 
and he mentioned zodiac to cheney
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter 
 john   
 that s pretty good  guys 
 we think so  too 
 let s take it to a judge 
mr  allen 
this is the
santa rosa police department 
we have a warrant
to search your residence 
hello 
i ll check with the neighbors 
close the door 
close the door 
there s rodents running around 
neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half hour ago 
 you think somebody tipped him 
 we re not leaving till he comes back 
i ll check the back 
jesus 
 what 
 squirrels 
piece of work  this guy 
not one  but two blue windbreakers 
 like the stine scene 
 we ll have those checked for blood 
and a pair of black gloves 
men s seven 
just like the ones we found in the cab 
well  he s got the same size shoes
and gloves as z 
probably just a coincidence 
dave  i got a gun 
check that  two guns 
they re both  22s 
one automatic  one revolver 
well  that s interesting 
because he happens to have
an m 1 rifle here in the closet 
for little darlings bouncing off buses 
someone s here 
hello  arthur  remember us 
no 
on the handwriting 
ballistics  no match 
prints  no match  writing  no match 
on both hands  right 
because we got handwriting
from both his hands 
and neither hand matches 
forget sherwood 
let s get another opinion 
fellas  he s not your guy 
damn it 
hey 
what do you want  time off 
a hug 
do you know what
the worst part of this is 
i can t tell if i wanted it
to be allen so bad
because i actually thought it was him 
or i just want all this to be over 
it s because you thought it was him 
and i did  too 
you know what  take some time off 
spend some time with your wife
and the kids 
go to candlestick  see a movie 
 to the city of san francisco 
i will enjoy killing one person every day
 until you pay me  100 000 
 if you agree  say so tomorrow morning
 in the personal column
san francisco chronicle 
 and i will set up meeting 
 if i do not hear from you 
 it will be my next pleasure
to kill a catholic priest or a   
     scorpio   
who s out of their minds 
i ve got to get out of here 
where the hell does he expect me
to find  100 000 
you re not thinking of paying him 
are you  mr  mayor 
the city of san francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime 
the killer gets shot in the chest 
that s how it ends 
do i know you 
i m robert graysmith 
i work at the chronicle with paul avery 
dave toschi  nice to meet you 
dave  that harry callahan
did a hell of a job with your case 
yeah  no need for due process  right 
 what do you do at the chronicle 
 i m a cartoonist 
that s nice 
you re gonna catch him 
pal  they re already
making movies about it 
we today have concluded
an agreement
to end the war and bring peace
with honor in vietnam 
   charles manson for
the tate la bianca mass murders   
guilty in the chowchilla
kidnapping case 
in the murder trial of one   
chairman mao died today   
   an absolute pardon
unto richard nixon   
 no  i m not a crook   
     generation of hostility   
   has now led to the death
of 50 000 americans
and several
hundred thousand vietnamese   
patricia hearst is kidnapped
by the symbionese liberation army   
all of us should stand up together
and say   no more   
your declaration of independence
spreads that   
americans admire
the united kingdom   
mr  hoffa has disappeared 
if we despise our own government   
   that the police have captured a man
whom they believe
to be the  son of sam     
hi  we haven t met 
i m robert graysmith 
i m duffy jennings 
 nice to meet you 
 good to meet you  man 
you got a great desk 
guy who used to work here

 i ll flip you for it 
 you wish 
nobody has more zodiac crap

 are you kidding me 
 hi  paul 
permission to come aboard 
it s right there 
anyway  you got shoes on 
this is perfect right here 
 that s the one 
 okay 
 see that  mesmerizing 
 oh  yeah  yeah  yeah 
my own kids

 how are you 
 fantastic 
i mean  admittedly 
the bee ain t exactly
the chron  but fuck it  right 
do you want a drink 
i don t have anything blue  but i got   
don t worry about that 
don t worry about it 
it s no bother at all 
nobody comes by from the old days 
cheers 
to your health and mine 
mostly mine 
so 
what s new 
 i ve been thinking 
 yeah 
somebody should write a book 
somebody should write a fucking book 
that s for sure 
 about what 
 about zodiac 
it s not new 
i ve been thinking that
if you put all the information together 
maybe you could jog something loose 
and then i was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you 
yeah  that s true 
you know all the players 
and you have all the files 
lost them 
you lost them 
or i tossed them  i don t know 
i moved onto a boat 
you know that we work
in the daily business  right 
as in  today 
what do you think
we were doing back then 
do you know that more people die
in the east bay commute
every three months
than that idiot ever killed 
he offed a few citizens 
he wrote a few letters 
and he faded into a footnote 
not that i haven t been sitting here idly
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose 
it was four years ago  let it fucking go 
you re wrong  it was important 
then  what did you ever do about it 
if it was so fucking important 
what did you ever do 
you hovered over my desk 
you stole from wastebaskets 
am i being unkind 
oh  that s right  i forgot 
you went to the library 
i m sorry i bothered you 
 hey  hi 
 hi 
 where you been 
 the library 
thank you 
 inspector toschi 
 yeah  one moment  please 
 hi 
 hi 
we met at the movies once 
it must have been magical 
i m robert graysmith 
i work at the chronicle 
i was wondering if i could buy you lunch 
sure  why not 
so  you re a friend of paul avery s 
he s actually the reason i m here 
i wanted to ask you about zodiac 
well  i appreciate the interest 
but we don t discuss open cases 
oh  well  what s going on with it 
day to day 
we re actively pursuing all leads 
and you re the only one on it  right 
mr  graysmith 
zodiac hasn t written in three years 
you know how many murders
we ve had in san francisco since then 
 no 
 over 200 
that s a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help 
so  nobody cares 
excuse me  i care 
okay  can i show you something 
i ve been doing research
on the first cipher 
everything an amateur
would need to create it
can be found in these books 
now  i started thinking
that if you can track these books 
then maybe you can track the man 
so  i remember you thought
that zodiac was military 
so i went to every base library
and i got a list of every person
who s ever checked out these books
and that s when i found this 
 missing 
 it means they were stolen 
so  almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the presidio library 
and the oakland army terminal library 
somebody didn t want a record
of ever having checked out these books 
who are you again 
i just wanna help 
i can t allow you to help 
i can t discuss the case with you 
i can t give you information 
and i certainly couldn t tell you
to go see ken narlow in napa 
n a r l o w 
i m sorry  mr  graysmith 
but we don t cooperate with writers 
well  i m not a writer  i m a cartoonist 
 and dave toschi sent you 
 yes 
 why 
 maybe he   
maybe he thought
that i could do some good 
 what are you  some kind of boy scout 
 eagle scout  actually  first class 
well  if you wanna do this 
don t let me stop you 
better start with vallejo  jack mulanax 
i understand what you re trying to do 
but this is an open police investigation 
i m a friend of dave toschi s 
and he said
that you might be able to help 
i mean  the case is dead 
zodiac s long gone 
he s yesterday s news  right 
that s what they say 
so  what s the harm 
no pens  no paper 
anything that you see that s relevant 
you got to remember in your head 
okay 
okay  here we go 
 which one 
 all of them 
and there s more in the next room 
they re all marked with these numbers 
243 146 
you don t smoke  do you 
once  in high school 
what s this 
thank you 
man  you really creeped us out 
 nine millimeter 
 said nothing and began firing   
 most dangerous game 
 do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting 
 not because of handwriting 
 darlene s sister  linda 
 it was all just deep breathing  george 
 it was a strange man  george 
strange man   
thank you so much 
oh  briefcase  oh  thanks 
 hey  jack 
 hey  bawart 
 who s that 
 that s graysmith 
some cartoonist 
thinks he s gonna solve the zodiac 
well  good for him 
 thank you for meeting me  inspector 
 no  we re not meeting  robert 
we re just two guys
who happen to be sitting
on the same bench at the same time 
i ve got five minutes 
i ve got to get back to the hall 
okay  as far as you know 
did anyone ever get in touch
with mike mageau
during your investigation
 and show him suspect photos 
 why 
well  he s the only surviving victim
who ever saw zodiac without a mask 
no  i mean  why are you asking me 
mageau and darlene 
that s vallejo s case 
paul stine is mine 
you ve got four minutes now 
darlene ferrin was being followed 
now  i know mulanax says
that they already found this guy 
a george waters 
but he also said
that she had a lot of admirers
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked 
 she was popular 
 very 
yeah  so   
she and her husband 
they move into their new house 
and one night they throw
this painting party 
and what s a painting party 
it s a party where people come
and help you paint 
sounds like a terrible party 
well  supposedly 
somebody who s not waters shows up 
and darlene is terrified of him 
so you think that darlene knew zodiac 
and if zodiac knew darlene 
then maybe mageau knows zodiac 
maybe  but mageau s gone 
so if you wanna connect
darlene to zodiac 
you re gonna have to find another way 
i have another way 
phone calls the night
of darlene s murder 
 yeah  zodiac called the police 
 no  dave  there were four other calls 
there were two to darlene s house 
one to darlene s brother in law 
and one to darlene s father in law 
just heavy breathing 
they started around 1 30 a  m  
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that darlene had been shot 
 this was in the vallejo files 
 yeah 
god damn it 
it s got to be more
than just a coincidence  right 
i mean  somebody doesn t just randomly
prank phone call a victim s entire family
90 minutes after they were shot 
so  either zodiac shoots
a random couple 
then he recognizes darlene   
or darlene was shot on purpose 
either way 
zodiac had to have known darlene 
that s good  robert 
so  i can t find mageau 
so maybe i can find darlene s sister 
and maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is 
try that  i ve got to go  she s very cute 
you know 
it s interesting that you should mention
zodiac calling people at home 
he did that in san francisco once 
what  who did he call 
i can t tell you 
that s privileged information 
but maybe melvin belli could 
melvin belli 
how do i get to melvin belli 
 he should be along soon 
 oh  that s all right 
i ve really   
i ve only been waiting two hours  so   
he s usually not this late 
oh  cookies  thank you 
these look great 
 you are here on business 
 i m writing a book about the zodiac 
i remember that  i spoke to him 
 you mean to mr  belli about the case 
 no  to the zodiac when he called 
he said he had to kill
because it was his birthday 
he said it    wait 
he said it was his birthday 
yes  you want something to drink 
 when was this 
 oh  so many years ago 
mr  belli was away for christmas 
gone for a week 
the zodiac called 
wanting to talk to him 
i said   he is not here   
he said   i have to kill 
today is my birthday   
and then he hangs up 
then the letter arrived 
so  the call came
before the letter of december 20th 
mr  belli was gone for a week 
he came back on christmas 
not a good day to work 
so  he left on the 18th 
is that helpful 
she said it was his birthday 
well  you d have to confirm that 
now wouldn t you 
how 
well  i never spoke to her 
but maybe my partner did 
 how do i get a hold of him 
 you don t  bill wanted out of this 
as far as i m concerned 
he should stay out 
how do i confirm it 
well  if my partner
did talk to someone from justice 
then they would ve had
to put that in a report 
that s standard procedure 
 okay 
 mel nicolai 
 thank you 
 goodbye 
i just need to confirm a date 
 mr  graysmith   
 i ve narrowed it down
between the 18th and the 20th
of december  and i just need   
okay  i ll play 
let s say this phone call did take place 
let s say it really was zodiac 
why would he volunteer
the day he was born 
plus  nobody died on december 18th 
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people 
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses 
he s a liar  mr  graysmith 
what if he made a mistake 
what if he wasn t lying 
what if it was him on the phone 
he didn t expect to pick it up 
a nice person to pick up 
what if  what if  what if 
look  off the record 
bill armstrong checked this out 
we took this very seriously 
none of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller 
bill armstrong 
can i give you a piece of advice 
you re looking in the wrong place 
handwriting  fingerprints 
that s what this whole thing s about 
stick to the evidence 
hi 
 hey  how was your day 
 long 
who s sherwood morrill 
he s a handwriting expert
in sacramento 
he called 
he said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7 00 
oh  great 
 so you re taking off work 
 just an hour 
sacramento s two hours away 
 really 
 yes 
what s this 
oh  that s that article 
 robert graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the zodiac   
yeah 
it talks all about you
researching zodiac 
well  that s what the article s about 
i m not so sure that s something
we want people to know about 
why  are you embarrassed 
robert  what s the one thing
we know about zodiac 
he reads the chronicle 
yeah  but he s never
gonna read herb caen 
 hello 
 mr  graysmith 
the robert graysmith
mentioned in the paper today 
 yeah 
 i can tell you who the zodiac is 
who is this 
the zodiac killer
is obsessed with movies 
he recorded his murders on film 
i tried to tell the police 
but they wouldn t follow through on it 
there s a man you need to find 
his name is bob vaughn 
 pen  pen 
 v a u g h n 
he s a friend of the zodiac s 
mr  vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer 
and he is storing
some film canisters for him 
in these canisters is the evidence 
okay  yeah  friend  who is this friend 
you have quite enough to get started 
oh  please 
the zodiac s name is rick marshall 
your toast is burning 
we choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter 
once we lock that into our brains 
our handwriting may change
over the years 
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered 
 understand 
 yes 
except zodiac s doesn t 
specifically with his  k  
in his first letters 
he executed the  k  with two strokes 
later letters  he did them with three 
 why 
 we don t know 
excuse me  i ve got to spray this 
how many suspects
were cleared through handwriting 
all of them 
also the print in the cab 
no match was ever found 
is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test 
no 
whoever the zodiac is 
he s not someone i cleared 
about a month ago  a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught 
his name was wallace penny 
he said he knew who the zodiac was 
gave me a name 
rick  rick somebody 
 rick marshall 
 yeah 
i think that the man
who you talked to called me  too 
after he left  then i checked my files 
i never cleared a rick marshall 
hello 
hello  who is this 
it s the wrong number 
does the name rick marshall
mean anything to you 
what are you after 
what do you got 
hypothetically  you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case 
this is off the record 
couple years back 
i was trying to get marshall s prints 
i handed him a photo 
he looks at it  he s about to give it back
and he stops and he says 
 my goodness 
i got fingerprints all over this   
and he wipes them off 
why didn t you test him for handwriting 
because when they finally
did run his prints 
they cleared him
against the one in stine s cab 
 so  then  it s not him 
 maybe yes  maybe no 
no  what do you mean 
zodiac left gloves behind at the scene 
if he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him 
how the hell s he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind 
but it was in the victim s blood 
could have been one of the bystanders 
or a cop just reaches out 
boom  false print 
yeah  but that print
disqualified 2 500 suspects 
which is why we also used handwriting 
but not for rick marshall 
sfpd saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house 
decided it looked nothing
like the z letters  so they just moved on 
how do they know
that rick marshall wrote the sign 
my thoughts exactly 
rick marshall was a navy man 
he received code training 
he was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater 
well  then  how do i get copies
of rick marshall s handwriting 
three ways 
one  get a warrant  which you can t 
two  get him to volunteer 
which he won t 
yeah  and three 
get creative 
i don t know what to tell you 
you get it  i ll analyze it 
beyond that  you re on your own 
okay  what about
the guy who came to see you 
the one who called me 
you mean wallace penny 
yeah  did he leave a number 
 hello 
 hi  this is robert graysmith 
how did you find me 
i need a sample
of rick marshall s handwriting 
i told you  vaughn is who   
mr  penny 
if rick marshall is the zodiac 
i need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it 
can you help me or not 
rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater vaughn worked at 
 i ll send one down 
 thank you 
 i ll need to see more samples 
 yeah  but is it   
it s as close as i ve ever seen 
we have to tread lightly here 
we re talking about
implicating this man as the zodiac 
i can get more  i ll just find vaughn
and i ll track down linda 
i mean  linda is darlene s sister 
i ve been to the dmv 
and i talked to her parents 
but still  nobody knows
where to find her 
mr  graysmith  most of the writing
matches the exemplar 
in a way  though  it s the part that
doesn t match that scares me the most 
 what do you mean 
 well  on the poster 
the one letter that absolutely 
positively does not match
is the letter  k  
you wouldn t happen to have any
animal crackers in there  would you 
unit five 
toschi needs to call in on a landline 
 dispatch 
 hey  dave toschi 
i ll connect you 
 dave 
 yeah  what s up 
jennings here from the chronicle 
it came in this morning
and you need to see it right now 
see what 
the new zodiac letter 
and it mentions you 
okay  okay 
shit  all right  come on 
hall of justice 
now  come on  come on 
come on  come on  come on 
dave 
do you have it with you 
 this is the zodiac speaking 
i m back with you 
 tell herb caen i am here 
i have always been here 
 that city pig toschi is good 
but i am smarter and better 
 he will get tired  then leave me alone 
 i m waiting for a good movie about me 
who will play me 
 i m now in control of all things   
these guys are from internal affairs 
we need to talk 
good evening  our top story tonight 
the san francisco police department
has confirmed
that the man
who calls himself the zodiac
and terrorized the bay area
has broken his silence of 51 months 
in a letter claiming 
 i am back with you  
the zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry 
and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet 
these carrots are perfect 
the terse 66 word message
also manages   
just go 
   to mention san francisco chronicle
columnist herb caen
and the department s own
david toschi by name 
 may i be excused 
 are they targets 
fine  but you have to come back
and finish at least half
of what s on that plate 
more team coverage
on the cipher slayer s return   
 okay 
 okay 
   begins as alan freeman has more 
thank you  eric 
san francisco chronicle columnist
armistead maupin says
that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery 
but it was written by the very man
trusted to hunt down this killer 
david toschi 
maupin  a very well respected author 
has gone on record saying
that he believes toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself 
maupin used david
as a character in his column 
david got a kick out of it
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters
asking for the character
to be brought back 
it was like
writing fan mail to himself  that s all 
but david did not write that letter 
no  i m sure that he didn t 
and i m sure that this will all blow over 
blow over 
they kicked him out of homicide 
they made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal 
 may i talk to him 
 no 
okay  can you just ask him
if he ever investigated
a man named rick marshall 
is that all you can think about 
mr  graysmith 
maupin works at your paper  we trust   
this girl  she wants music lessons 
dave  dave 
i ll catch up to you 
you stop calling my house 
do you understand me 
i just need your help to find linda 
 jesus 
 look  two seconds 
look  we ve been
running handwriting samples 
 who s we 
 sherwood and i 
sherwood 
sherwood who was fired
from questioned documents 
sherwood who drinks
like paul avery now 
 he retired 
 is that what he told you 
 what  are you saying he s wrong 
 i m saying stop calling my house 
 we ran them on rick marshall 
 no  robert 
no  i know you don t think it s him 
i mean  no  i am not having
this conversation 
but i think that marshall knew darlene 
and i can t talk to mageau or linda 
so i m gonna talk to bob vaughn 
 robert  robert  stop it 
 what 
okay  the rick marshalls
of this world will suck you dry 
they re blind alleys 
but he said he wasn t gonna announce
his murders anymore  dave 
he was just gonna do them 
do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now 
too much time has gone by  okay 
too much of the evidence is lost 
people get old  robert  they forget 
now  i have been a cop for 25 years 
murder police for 12 
 what do you do for a living 
 you know what i do for a living 
 you re a cartoonist 
 so what are you saying 
i am saying zodiac was my job 
it is not yours 
 he s still out there  dave 
 no  robert  i am through with this 
i am through with you 
what about september 26  1970 
 okay  which one was that 
 the lake tahoe nurse goes missing 
one day before the vernal equinox 
 dad 
 yeah  mark that 
got another one  june 19th  1971 
that s got to be
near the summer solstice 
oh  guys 
don t tell mom about
our special project  okay 
how come you and mom
don t sleep in the same bed anymore 
hello 
mr  graysmith 
it s ken narlow from napa 
oh  captain narlow 
thank you for calling me back 
yeah  how can i help 
i called you because we ve been
cross referencing lunar cycles
with the zodiac s timeline 
more often than not  each cycle
since  69 corresponds with an attack
or with one of the letters 
or an unsolved homicide 
 who s working with you on this 
 some colleagues 
dad 
 ken  can you hold on one second 
 dad 
 what is it 
 what s this 
in the decade since the zodiac s
last cipher was received 
every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it 
but today 
where those agencies had failed 
a cartoonist has succeeded 
how did you do it 
oh  just a lot of books from the library 
and i love puzzles  so i just   
yeah  the fucking library 
i believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind   
that s a  j   okay  honor camp 
thank you so much 
hey  we found linda 
she s in jail  isn t that great 
why d you do it 
because she ll be able to identify rick   
 what are you talking about 
 you went on tv 
you put yourself out there
for him to see 
oh  hon  you re being paranoid 
then who s been calling our house
in the middle of the night
at least once a week 
nobody 
what s it gonna take
for you to be done with this 
i can t talk about this now 
i have to go see bob vaughn 
well  that s too bad 
because we re gonna talk about this 
and when is it gonna be finished 
when you catch him 
when you arrest him 
 be serious 
 i am serious 
i need to know who he is 
i need to stand there 
i need to look him in the eye
and i need to know that it s him 
is that more important
than your family s safety 
of course not 
why  why do you need to do this 
why 
because nobody else will 
that s not good enough 
are you done  can i go 
 mr  vaughn 
 mr  graysmith 
 yes 
 hi 
you needed to speak to me 
yes  there s a coffee shop
right on the corner 
 why don t we just go to my home 
 oh  i don t wanna put you out 
it s no trouble at all 
 where are you parked 
 just right there 
 you can follow me 
 oh  okay 
watch your step 
come in 
 very nice house 
 oh  thank you 
it s very rustic 
 can i take your jacket 
 no  thank you  i m fine 
okay  this way  please 
 have a seat 
 thank you 
 how about some tea 
 oh  no  i m all right 
 you sure 
 yes 
i wanted to ask you about a film
that the avenue may have played
while you were the organist there 
the most dangerous game 
oh  it s a classic  rko  1932 
fay wray  joel mccrea  leslie banks 
we ve run that picture many times 
in  68   69 
i d have to check my records  why 
do you remember the zodiac 
this is about rick marshall  isn t it 
 he was a projectionist there  right 
 for a time  yes 
but i have no occasion
to correspond with him these days 
okay  well  there is a connection
between one of the zodiac attacks
and that film 
you mean the symbol 
hold on 
the zodiac symbol on film 
it s on the countdown 
it s trimmed off each reel
before it s shown 
but it always arrives with it 
right there 
the first time i saw it in the papers 
i thought about that 
we got a tip
that rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open 
a tip about a mysterious film canister 
is it true 
yes 
 did you open it 
 no 
 may i see it 
 rick took it back in 1972 
this tip is how you got it in your head
that rick is the zodiac 
that and the poster 
the poster 
the poster that rick drew 
the handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match 
 rick didn t draw any posters 
 no  he drew this one 
mr  graysmith  i do the posters myself 
that s my handwriting 
i won t take any more of your time 
why don t i just go and find out
when we played that film 
oh  that s all right 
it s not a problem 
they re just down in the basement 
not many people
have basements in california 
i do 
you coming  mr  graysmith 
the original studio one sheets 
i always kept for myself 
the cheapo knock offs
like you brought today
i end up tossing into the back alley 
 69 
you live alone 
most dangerous game ran in may  69 
so  that would be about
nine weeks before
the first zodiac letter  correct 
yeah 
do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired 
are you sure
there s nobody else in the house 
would you like
to go upstairs and check 
no 
thank you  thanks for everything 
you re welcome 
it s locked 
thank you 
good night  mr  graysmith 
two killers  got to be two killers 
one has the   
guys 
you ve got five minutes 
linda 
hi  i m robert 
did you get my note 
 what s this about 
 zodiac 
figures 
 you got the look 
 what look 
i didn t mean anything 
tell me about this painting party 
i told the cops about that so long ago 
darlene always had
a lot of boys around 
even though she was married 
and this one guy was weird  though 
he used to bring her presents
from tijuana and   
i don t know why
she was friends with him 
she once told me he d killed somebody 
really 
yeah  i think maybe
when he was in the service 
 navy 
 i think so 
was he into movies 
was he a movie buff 
i can tell you that
he was not into people 
the party darlene threw 
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer  help paint 
but this guy showed up in a suit 
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long 
didn t talk to anyone 
and darlene told me
to stay away from him 
she was scared of him 
and a couple of weeks later 
she was dead 
i m sorry  do you remember his name 
i mean  it was short 
like a nickname  like stan 
 rick 
 no  i don t think so 
 are you sure 
 yeah 
how can you be sure 
it was a long time ago  think hard 
i am thinking hard 
it was rick 
no  it wasn t 
 it was rick  it was rick marshall 
 no 
just say it 
it wasn t rick 
it was leigh 
 leigh 
 yeah  leigh 
sounds right 
officer  i need you to let me in 
 is this an emergency 
 no  i just need to see one file 
no  you need to come back
tomorrow morning 
 one file  just for one second 
 8 00 a  m   when we re open 
sergeant  sergeant mulanax 
sergeant  i just need to see one file 
just give me five minutes 
i know exactly where it is 
please 
i shouldn t be talking to you 
 you got five minutes 
 okay 
here  here 
linda states that some of
darlene s closest friends are leigh 
who used to bring darlene
presents from tijuana 
 so what 
 he knew her 
linda said leigh  this is leigh 
no  that s just one name in a file
that contains hundreds 
it s nothing 
 dave toschi   
 agrees with me 
our investigation
into this subject is over 
i m sorry 
hello 
who s there 
 you didn t return my calls 
 oh  i ve been kind of busy 
yeah  i can see that 
how s the book coming 
i tried to send you these 
i called the chron 
well  i m not a cartoonist anymore  so   
i heard 
when s the last time
you ate something 
nothing makes sense anymore 
 did it ever 
 yeah  it did 
robert  it was just the date
that didn t end 
you don t mean that 
a little 
the kids miss you 
 i can t have them see me like this 
 neither can i 
so  do whatever you have to 
but finish this 
dave 
dave  it s robert 
 dave 
 is he actually here 
i m gonna kill him 
i m calling sfpd  where s my gun 
dave 
robert  go away 
dave  he made a mistake 
 get away from the window 
 i ll meet you around front 
no  you won t 
 you have to hear this 
 no  i don t  robert 
the birthday was the one time
that he was weak 
the one time
that he gave something away 
 robert  i am calling the police 
 it s arthur leigh allen 
where did you get that name 
he called the bellis  house 
december  69 
 i need to kill  today s my birthday   
it was his birthday 
arthur leigh allen
was born on december 18th 
get in here 
 here you go 
 thanks 
he wrote me  you know 
2 500 suspects 
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was leigh allen 
they like to help  you know  sometimes 
yes  robert  i know 
he was arrested january 1975
for molestation 
he sent me that when he got out 
 dear dave  if i can ever be
of any help to you  just let me know 
 i m sorry i wasn t your man   
and it s typewritten 
using a typewriter is not a crime 
and he knew darlene 
it s in the vallejo files 
mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect 
that you spent two years on him 
and that nobody ever came close 
all the evidence said no 
sherwood disqualified his handwriting 
the same sherwood
that drinks like paul avery now 
yes  you have sherwood morrill
in writing saying 
 i m sorry  this just won t work   
 but you also have terry pascoe   
 his protã gã  
yeah  fine  it s his protã gã  
but he s a handwriting expert
nonetheless  and he s saying 
 do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting   
 so the two cancel each other out 
 no  they don t 
it was sherwood s case 
he was the head
of questioned documents 
if it went to trial 
all the defense would have to do
is call sherwood to the stand 
and there was no way of getting allen
into court in the first place 
because there was no evidence  robert 
what do you mean 
there s no evidence 
you have him seen with the ciphers 
the military boot prints 
the same size shoes and gloves 
the most dangerous game 
the zodiac watch 
the background with school children 
the misspellings of christ mass 
the bloody knives 
all circumstantial 
paul stine s shirt  his wallet  his keys 
we should have found
one of those things in that trailer 
 we didn t 
 that s   
okay  catherine allen states that
 leigh cleaned out his trailer
on friday after work
 and moved it to santa rosa
on saturday  august 7th  1971  
you interviewed him
at the refinery on august 4th 
 yeah 
 so  he s cleaning out his trailer 
he s moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him 
okay  okay 
look at the stuff side by side  dave 
all right 
okay  arthur leigh allen
and the zodiac  their timelines 
 when was the first murder in vallejo 
 christmas  1968 
eight months before that 
allen is fired for molesting his students
and his family discovers
that he s a pedophile 
 now  when do the letters begin 
 july   69 
after the murder of darlene ferrin 
and they continue
until you go to see him at work 
now  after that  do any of the letters
contain swatches of paul stine s shirt 
no  because he dumped them 
because he got scared 
because he knew
that you were on to him 
 so  when s the next letter from zodiac 
 not until january of 1974 
he is silent for three years 
then  in  74  he feels comfortable again
because everybody s moved off
allen as a suspect 
and what do we get 
three new letters from zodiac
in january  may  and july in  74 
 but then the letters stop 
 what happens to allen 
he s arrested 
january  1975 
they send him to atascadero 
we don t get another letter from zodiac
the entire time he s there 
 when is he released 
 august   77 
allen gets out  he types you an apology 
and then what 
we get our first new zodiac letter
in four years 
okay  zodiac had to have known
darlene ferrin  right 
yes  because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder 
because of the vallejo file 
we know that darlene knew
a man named leigh 
yes 
so  all coincidence aside  robert 
how can you be sure that leigh allen
is the leigh from this file 
now  vallejo is a small town 
but it s not that small 
how do you put
the two of them together 
this is a case that s covered
both northern and southern california 
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles 
 would you agree 
 yes 
darlene ferrin worked
at the vallejo house of pancakes
on the corner of tennessee and caroll 
arthur leigh allen lived in his
mother s basement on fresno street 
door to door  that is less than 50 yards 
is that true 
i ve walked it 
jesus christ 
so 
the prints  the handwriting   
 i m not asking you as a cop 
 but i am a cop 
i can t prove this 
just because you can t prove it 
doesn t mean it s not true 
easy  dirty harry 
finish the book 
thank you  thank you for breakfast 
can i help you 
no 
mr  mageau 
thanks for coming to see me 
you re the one i talked to on the phone 
i m george bawart  vallejo pd 
i took over for jack mulanax 
it s been 22 years 
i don t know how i can help you 
well  this is just a formality 
i m gonna show you
