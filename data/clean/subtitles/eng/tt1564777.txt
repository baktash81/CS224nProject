with glorious beings 
it was perfect 
it did not last 
lucifer revolted against god 
a line was drawn in paradise 
a war began 
every angel was forced to choose
the holiness of heaven or the chaos
that roiled outside 
one angel refused
believing the only thing worth fighting for
was a force we now call love 
cast out of heaven
this angel did not fall alone 
every angel who had yet to choose
fell in a flash of almighty fury 
these are the fallen 
exiled from heaven
they wander the earth
banished until the rebel angel
abandons love and takes a side 
that was then 
this is now 
is that it 
must be 
love you 
my baby 
i just wish i knew how to help you 
i ll be fine 
look here 
it s small 
i wanted you to have something
to open on your birthday 
thank you 
i love you 
bye  dad

you re going to want to stay away from cam 
yeah  why s that 
he s trouble 
not the good kind 
let me see your schedule 
good  you re with us 
  us 
  prep track 
we tend to stick together 
most kids here are psych referrals 
they re lucky to get through the day
without wetting themselves
or attacking a teacher because their
pencils are unevenly sharpened 
don t be spooked  though 
they keep them separate 
all the serious mental defectives are
up on the third floor 
it s one big pharmapalooza 
this is me  208 
where are you 
you re messing with me  right 
you re a psy   
 0k8   
hey 
sorry 
tell me about your hallucinations 
what do you call them 
shadows 
shadows 
and they started when 
when i was little 
five or six  i can t remember exactly 
and you still see them 
no  i haven t for a while 
tell me  lucinda 
why do you think you re here
at sword and cross  
ask the judge 
i ve read your file 
i know what the judge thinks 
what i don t understand is your decision 
doctor segal says that
on medication  you re stable 
no hallucinations  no paranoia 
no nightmares 
i m not crazy  you know 
no  nobody s saying you re crazy 
everybody s saying that 
do you understand  that if you take
your prescribed medication you can leave 
go home  go back to your old school 
be with your friends 
i don t like the way they make me feel 
but if you refuse  you need to be here
in a court sanctioned treatment facility 
under supervision 
even if it means being locked up
i d rather be me than pretend to be
something i m not just to fit in 
you have a chance at a normal life 
poor thing  she has no
idea what she s in for 
maybe it ll be different this time 
you know something i don t 
it d just be nice for a change  that s all 
alright  let s make it interesting 
twenty to one luce goes down in flames 
just like always 
i m in for a hundred 
  arriane 
  what 
  gabbe 
  it s cruel 
this isn t a game  roland

alright 
you poor thing 
  jeez 
  oh  did you fall

  i m fine 
  no you re not 
you ve never been less fine
in your whole nauseating existence 
coming here was a bad choice 
listen  if i did something to upset you 
i m sorry   
you make me sick 
you re nothing 
you bat your lashes and flick your hair and
expect the whole world to come to a stop 
you don t even know me 
i know you re a murdering little psycho 
hey  break it up 
psycho bitch 
you should come with a warning label 
that was quick 
  she   
  don t tell me she started it 
i m sure she did 
but that doesn t mean
you have to take the bait 
you re right  i m sorry 
fighting is grounds for expulsion 
which for you would mean
a transfer to the state psych hospital 
is that what you want 
no 
since today is your first day and i m guessing
you ve yet to read the code of conduct
i ll just give you yard duty 
and you  you come with me 
you know you re not supposed to be
in here without a pass 
i just  ah   
oh no no no  that was a joke 
  oh 
  i m sorry

small school  like really  really small 
like infinitesimally small 
and not a lot happens here

so i m guessing that you re going to be
the centre of a lot of attention
both positive and negative 
great 
tell you what 
i m gonna go  let you do your thing
and then maybe if you re feeling
forgiving you can   
forget the whole me acoosting you
in the bathroom with too much information

because i don t know
know how to stop myself
from talking situation
that s happening right now
and give me another chance 
i ll go now 
  hey penn 
  yeah 
do you mind showing me back to the dorms 
i m a little bit lost 
sure 
thanks 
what if angels actually
walked among us right now  here on earth 
that s the story of the fallen 
angels cast out of heaven
condemned to live
their lives alongside us mere mortals 
banished  because they
failed to pick a side
in lucifer s war against heaven 
who can tell me
what the war in heaven was about 
todd 
good versus evil 
no  that s too simplistic 
lucifer was god s favourite 
his brightest light 
what caused him to turn from god 
anyone 
 cause his girlfriend dumped him 
what happened to the other angels 
those that sided with satan
were banished to hell 
only the faithful remained in heaven 
the angels that didn t choose 
they were cast out 
they are the fallen 
forced to walk the earth
some of the fallen
retained their angelic nature
repented and wait for the chance
to return to heaven 
others aligned themselves with lucifer
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos 
but neither group can leave this world
because of one of their own 
the rebel angel 
he rejected both sides of the war 
god and lucifer alike
all in his pursuit of human love 
the other fallen angels
must remain here on earth
until he chooses a side
in the only war that has ever been waged 
the war we still see every day
raging all around us 
but surely you learned some of this
in sunday school 
no  i didn t go to church growing up 
really 
yeah  my parents aren t really religious 
so  you were never baptized 
um  no 
is it supposed to be over  the war 
i mean  theologically speaking
if the devil is still alive 
what s to stop him trying
from trying again 
excellent question 
so  any more takers on that bet 
yep 
keep them rolling  roland 
luce  you poor thing 
are you okay 
what is going on here  is anyone hurt 
no really  i m fine 
the food is fine 
  anything 
  anything  sweetie 
definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes with
whipped cream with bananas  that sounds   
hey 
what s taking so long  come on 
ineedit 
mom  mom 
allocated time completed 
allocated time completed 
i just can t believe i have to wait
a whole week to talk to them 
you know  i didn t even
get a chance to say goodbye 
you can have my time on tuesday 
no 
yeah  i m not gonna use it 
i ve been here six years 
everyone i know is here
and everyone i m interested in
talking to is in this room 
what about your parents 
i ve been meaning to ask 
how i ended up here 
you don t have to tell me 
it s not a big deal 
well after my parents got divorced
neither of them really wanted me around so
they decided that boarding school
was in my best interest 
and as soon as my morn saw that brochure
the one with the kids riding horses
and swimming and stuff
that was it 
the search was over 
i was enrolled and here i am 
so you re not a kleptomaniac 
manic depressive  anorexic cutter 
no 
my diagnosis is much worse
and  i m afraid  untreatable 
i have tdp 
tdp 
tragically disinterested parents 
yeah  my parents suck 
but there s a pool 
but there is a pool 
you ve gotta be kidding me 
don t tell me 
is cam in love 
that could make things difficult for you 
just don t forget who you work for 
daniel 
i didn t get a chance to
say thanks yesterday 
don t mention it 
well thank you anyway 
there s one more thing
i m a little embarrassed to even ask but   
well then don t 
well i ve committed now 
i m just going to go for it 
it s just you seem really familiar to me 
like i know you from somewhere 
  is that possible 
  no 
i d remember you 
because i keep thinking that   
i ve gotta go  alright  i ll see you later 
thank you 
hey new girl  pretty
eventful first few days 
already planning your escape 
yeah  considering it 
you ah  you want some breakfast 
that s tempting 
but i m actually running late to class 
it s better never than late 
this is really good 
where s it from 
i stole it from the faculty lounge 
they have a pretty decent espresso machine 
you re incorrigible 
that s what they tell me 
you don t agree 
i just know what i like 
and you don t mind
breaking the rules to get it 
well
if the risk is worth the reward 
i don t see why not 
what about you 
you don t end up
at sword and cross by following the rules 
you got a little rebel in you 
i m just misunderstood 
no  i see it 
you got a spark 
what do you mean 
means you re the kind of person who d rather
do what s right than what you re told 
it means you re trouble 
you think you know me  huh 
i know what i like 
time s up 
roland s having a party this friday 
  yeah 
  it s just casual 
  you can bring a friend 
  okay 
bunch of us get together at the end
of the week to blow off some steam 
thanks 
aren t you in this class 
oh  i ve heard it all before 
en garde  allez 
how well did they think this through 
you know  giving weapons to
heavily medicated teenagers
with poor impulse control and anger issues 
halt 
alright  change partners 
sparks  you re up 
price  let s see
if you ve been paying attention 
remember what i showed you 
not really 
en garde 
allez 
that wasn t terrible
considering it was just your first time 
alright 
switch partners 
grigori  come on over 
en garde 
allez 
very good 
one more  en garde 
allez 
grigori  halt 
halt 
halt 
both of you  halt 
i give it a week 
what about the whole baptism thing 
could that affect her 
the details don t matter 
grigori always finds something to obsess
over but it never makes a difference 
now y all just need to relax
and accept that luce is gonna die
and there s nothing you or daniel
or miss sophia can do to stop it 
i thought you d never done this before 
i haven t 
my body just took over 
like i knew exactly what to do 
huh 
it was weird  have you ever felt that 
yeah  i was kinda like
that with trigonometry 
it all just fell into place
so at first i was like
 wow  i m a genius  
but then i remembered that we covered it last
year so i guess that s not as impressive 
you got it bad  huh 
no  it s not like that 
well  maybe it is 
it s just i have these
feelings about daniel 
like i know him 
like i ve known him for a really long time 
yeah  maybe you guys
went to preschool together or something 
well i asked him
if we d met before and he said no
and he basically ran away  it was strange 
yeah 
something definitely not quite    hmm 
what do you mean 
i can get in a lot of trouble
if you tell anybody
what i m about to say to you  okay 
i won t 
so i volunteer in the
office for my free period
which i know sounds totally lame
but is actually kind of cool and fun
in its own weird way  sort of 
turns out randy is totally useless
when it comes to computers 
so he asks yours truly
to do the most basic tasks like
find files on his desktop and search for
videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever 
meaning 
i have full access
to everybody s academic records 
i ve looked at daniel s file 
it s empty 
he s got no home address 
no emergency contact  nothing 
  do you like this 
  yeah 
it s the same with all those kids 
there s just something not quite right
about that whole group 
you never hear them talk about
their families or their old schools 
they barely ever go to class and it s like
they all knew each other from before 
wait  who do you mean 
daniel arrived first 
he transferred at the beginning
of last year and then gabbe 
the tall blonde
that s always hanging around him 
yep  85 percent confectionery
sugar by volume 
then arriane 
oh yeah  she showed me around my first day 
and molly  serious defective 
and roland  i have literally no idea
how he passes his weekly pee test
and then mr  future 25 years to life 
cam  transferred in last spring 
miss sophia  too 
she s new this year and totally ignores
everyone except her favourites 
well what do you make of it 
beats me 
  i can t believe it 
  what 
i m actually going to one
of roland s parties 
oh  don t you two look lovely 
thanks 
you do too  as always 
aren t you sweet 
is it wrong that i kind of hate her 
why  because she s a flawless 
honey scented  spray tanned 
bikini waxed manicured
blond fembot who s always smiling
and is at this moment kissing your crush 
yeah  pretty much that 
it might be wrong  but i totally get it 
anybody order drinks 
i m still trying to figure out
how you ended up here 
well you invited me  remember 
that s not what i meant 
with the rest of us it s obvious  right 
drugs 
vandalism 
depression 
nymphomania 
so why did you end up at a place like this 
maybe i m not as innocent as i look 
  hello 
  hi 
is that a flying lotus jacket 
yeah 
you are such a hipster 
in    in a good way  i mean 
like you know 
it s not like you re trying to be cool 
like you re actually cool 
wow 
i ve been accused of a
lot of things in my life
but never that 
  hey 
  oh  hey  thank you 
oh  is that for me 
amazing  thank you so much  thank you 
sure 
um   
so   
is it from a show  or    
yeah  he s amazing live 
i saw him in asheville with teebs 
get out of it  teebs is my favourite
post dilla artist 
well thundercat changed my life 
well no  except maybe for thundercat 
have you heard the daylight remix 
that bass 
exactly 
yes 
bad memories 
so do you still think about him 
who 
the boy you killed  trevor 
you know  tall  easy on the eyes 
well at least he was before
he hooked up with you 
now he s not so much to look at 
how do you know about him 
  i know a lot about you  crazy luce 
  get that away from me 
i ll bet i know you better than
you know yourself 
for someone who doesn t like fire 
it sure does seem to like you 
that s enough 
shut up  arri  before i give you a scar
on your face to match the one on your back 
back off  molly 
  are you okay 
  yeah  i m fine 
what are you doing 
just having some fun
with your psycho girlfriend 
stay away from luce 
you hear me 
oh  you ve lost track  cam 
you always want what you can t have 
this time she s mine 
lay off me 
there s definitely life in outer space 
hey  where s luce 
um  i don t know 
i thought that she was with you 
 0k8   
she doesn t need your kind of help 
who s gonna protect her  you 
you know  you lovebirds need
to relax  huh  it s a party 
you know  i m feeling pretty tired
all of a sudden  actually 
i think i m just gonna go 
you want me to walk with you 
no  it s okay  you should stay 
hello 
molly 
molly  come on  i know it s you 
where s trevor 
i m so sorry 
i m so sorry 
what did you do  you freak 
it s my fault 
i m so sorry 
so tell me  how was your first week
at sword and cross  
fine 
no incidents to report 
visions  nightmares 
no 
what about your shadows 
good 
good 
good 
what s wrong 
nothing 
i just can t get past it 
what 
this feeling that i know you 
haven t we been through this 
yeah  but   
i don t believe you 
there is something between us 
and you feel it too  don t you 
alright  okay 
you re right 
i should have just told you the truth 
it s   
like i realise i haven t been
very warm towards you  and   
you ve been a real dick 
yeah  but believe me 
you ve got to know
it s not because of anything you ve done 
see  there s this girl   
gabbe 
what  no 
no  not gabbe 
no  just someone else  another girl 
i guess you could say
i m not with her anymore  but 
i still love her 
what i m trying to say is   
you re a mess and i m
better off without you 
something like that 
it s not that simple 
you can t tell someone how to feel 
yeah 
i wish things could be different 
hey  don t go 
there you are  i was worried about you 
you left the party without saying goodbye 
what s wrong 
luce 
stop  talk to me 
i had an interesting conversation
with molly last night 
 0k8   
she knew things about me 
things i haven t shared with anyone 
and    
someone s been talking to her 
someone who s read my file 
oh right   cause that makes perfect sense 
i betrayed your trust to a ruthless 
soulless  unimaginative bully
with suspect hygiene and poor
language skills in exchange for what 
oh  two free body piercings
and a prison tattoo 
i was sure i d get away with it 
but you caught me 
well  at least you re
big enough to admit it 
what s wrong  really 
you have read my file  haven t you 
of course 
so then you know about   
your shadows 
do you still see them 
yeah 
do you see them right now 
no  but since i ve been here
they ve gotten a lot worse 
and i m scared 
i m scared somebody s going to get hurt 
no  don t be ridiculous 
i m not 
trevor was just standing there 
he was just standing there
and we   
  okay  tell me    tell me exactly what happened 
trevor acted like i didn t exist all year
and then suddenly at this party
he was flirting with me 
come up to the cabin with me 
just one time i wanted to feel
normal 
  you want a drink 
  sure 
did you hear that 
trevor  are you sure that we re alone 
luce 
relax 
no 
stop  stop  get off  get off 
  what the hell 
  please  get out of here 
what s going on 
no  no 
luce 
the shadows were bigger than ever 
and then suddenly everything exploded 
and i don t know how but i was outside
and trevor didn t make it 
trevor 
where s trevor  tell me 
i m so sorry 
i m so sorry 
what did you do  you freak 
it s my fault  i m so sorry 
trevor 
and he s dead because
there s something wrong with me 
and i m really glad you
want to be my friend
but you should stay away from me
because i m dangerous 
did you want him to die 
no 
did you try to hurt him 
no 
well then it s not your fault 
you don t need to be alone  luce 
you need a friend 
let me help you 
why 
because that s what friends do 
last time we were discussing how it was
lucifer s pride that led to the fall 
yes 
so who can translate 
humilitas homines sanctis
angelis similes facit
et superma ex angefis demones fan  
anyone 
it was pride that turned
angels into devils 
what was that  luce 
it is humility that makes men as angels 
it was pride that turned
angels into devils 
we have a latin scholar in our midst 
no  i ve never   
it was just a guess 
so how does that relate to the rebel angel 
wasn t it his pride 
his stubborn pursuit of love over god
that led to the fallen
being trapped on earth 
arriane 
i m tired of listening to you twist these
religious fables to fit your own beliefs 
you tell this story of yours
as is love was a choice 
i don t care for your tone 
maybe you re just pissed the rebel angel
chose the wrong girl 
get out 
gladly 
i d rather burn in hell for all eternity
than have to listen to one more second
of your pious self satisfied ravings 
that was kind of awesome 
yeah 
do you think she ll get suspended 
i doubt she even gets detention 
those kids get away with everything 
hey  i forgot my sweater 
i ll catch up with you guys 
 0k8   
listen to me 
you ve got to keep your eye on cam 
what are you talking about 
i don t believe the statue was an accident 
she s in danger 
i saw him on the upper floor
just before it happened 
why would he do that 
you heard  she isn t baptized 
she needs our protection  she s   
sorry  i just    l forgot my sweater 
i ll go talk to her 
hey luce 
wait 
what 
  what do you want 
  nothing 
i just thought maybe
we could walk together 
oh 
sure 
what were you working on in class today 
nothing  it s ah   
sort of a graphic novel 
what kind of story 
i guess you could call it a romance 
does it have a happy ending 
i don t know 
you don t know how it ends 
no  not yet 
i m sort of stuck  to be honest 
well let s hear it  tell me your story 
no  no  i don t think that s a good idea 
no 
maybe i could help you with the ending 
 0k8   
it s about this boy and this girl
and they love each other more than anything
but they can never be together 
why 
because there s this curse 
every seventeen years they meet
and they fall in love
and then just when they re happiest 
the girl dies 
so it s a tragedy 
what happens to the boy 
he waits 
he doesn t age or change 
he remains in love 
years pass  and eventually she returns 
the same girl 
she s changed 
she has a new name  new family 
she has no memory of him
but he knows it s her 
it s her soul
reincarnated 
and they fall in love 
always 
i mean  each time it s slightly different 
there are infinite versions
but the end is always the same 
but then all it takes is a kiss
and she s gone 
who put the curse on them 
it was the devil himself 
he was jealous of their love 
so he tried to break it 
there has to be something
they can do  right 
he s tried everything 
he tries looking for her
then tries to avoid her 
tries to run away
from the inevitable heartbreak 
but the curse always finds a way 
no matter what 
the girl in your story 
is she the one you mentioned at the pool 
the girl you re still in love with 
she s the inspiration  yeah 
this girl 
alright  you got me  it s um   
i was using you for her
current incarnation 
this is meant to be paris 
in 1723 
it s stupid 
why me 
because you re beautiful 
but i messed up the eyes 
there s always been
something about your eyes 
what s wrong 
nothing 
tell me about this place 
have you been there before 
does it matter 
  yes 
  why 
i ve never travelled before 
i ve never even left the country 
but i know that
there s a café just off to the right
and i know it smells like
jasmine after it rains 
and i know that the old man that runs the café
is kind to his dog and he s cruel to his wife
and i know these things
because i ve been there 
and i ve been there with you 
oh  luce  come on 
don t 
don t tell me that i m crazy 
luce  its  a drawing  alright 
it s a story  that s all 
you re lying 
i wish i could tell you
what you want to hear 
i m sorry 
blow 
happy birthday  luce

and i ll tell you everything 
and luce

there s only one way to find out 
  come on 
  no way  i drive 
you really want to start the night by
saying no to the girl 
 0k8   
what am i doing here with you 
celebrating 
you re good at that 
every time i ask you a question
you have some clever
way of avoiding the answer 
that s not true 
here s an example  where did you grow up 
see 
how come you won t tell me
anything about yourself 
because i m having a nice time
and i don t want to ruin it 
it s that bad  huh 
i prefer this 
you promised answers 
come on  luce  it s your birthday 
i m thinking there s something else
you might want 
what are you doing 
  stop 
  i told you to stay away from her 
daniel  what are you doing 
  why  because you care so much about her 
  stop it 
stop 
  no  because i know what you re capable of 
you re still with lucifer  admit it 
why don t you tell her  daniel 
tell her everything 
  she wants the truth 
  stop it 
just stay away from her 
you don t have a say in it 
i don t know what s going on here
but it has nothing to do with me 
i never bought into that idea that
there s one person you re meant to be with
but my visions are so real
and my feelings are so real
it s like past lives or something 
i don t know 
and everything s connected to daniel
somehow but he keeps pushing me away 
and cam s hiding something too 
so what do you think 
i think you re a jerk for not telling me
it was your birthday
but i m willing to overlook that
because this is so ridiculously juicy 
do you believe in reincarnation 
no  not at all 
i didn t think so either but
there has to be
some sort of explanation for this 
hmm 
maybe i can help 
what are you doing 
we just need one more thing 
what 
how do you know which room todd s in 
so how does this work exactly 
have you got those yearbook photos 
todd s been working on this really
cool facial recognition algorithm 
it s not all my code 
it was developed at carnegie mellon 
but i ve tweaked it a little 
he s so modest 
sorry 
this might take a minute 
it s just searching 
luce  hello 
we ve got hits 
whoa 
look at the name 
it must be a relative 
oh  what 
the actual    fuck 
print it 
i ll get it 
todd  i m counting on
you having some sort of explanation
because i am really struggling here 
i haven t got the faintest idea 
i love you 
let s see what else we can find 
it s happening again 
no 
leave me alone 
luce  everything okay 
luce 
penn 
i ve gotta find penn 
penn 
penn  where are you 
todd 
i ve gotta find penn 
  no 
  penn 
todd 
todd 
no 
here at the school infirmary
we provide the same care
she d receive at the hospital 
i want to take her home 
the doctor s clear  she needs to
remain under clinical supervision 
for how long 
until she s stable 
you should get some rest 
we ll call you at the hotel as soon
as luce is able to receive visitors 
there was nothing we could have done 
i refuse to accept that 
i could have warned her 
i could have been there   
when has that ever helped 
it doesn t matter  okay 
she needs us and we let her down 
is this a criminal investigation 
not at the moment 
the fire was caused by lightning 
that report is preliminary 
given the similarity to
the trevor beckman case
we ll definitely want to question her 
i don t want you talking to her
without her attorney present 
we come together today
to mourn the loss of a dear friend 
a kind and generous   
whose life was far
too brief to mourn the loss   
whose tragic passing comes
as a shock to us all 
we will always remember a kind
and generous friend
someone whose company was always a pleasure
and although today
we are understandably overcome with grief
i ask you to have faith that in time
our pain will prove strengthening
and ultimately a testament
to how much todd mattered
and always will 
not only was he a loving son
but he was also a kind and generous friend 
we must transform our sadness
into something strengthening 
that s how we celebrate his life
and ensure his legacy 
you show up to his funeral
after you get him killed 
i know you re the one doing this 
what are you talking about 
the statue  the fire in the library 
you were trying to kill her 
killing luce is your thing  daniel 
don t you dare   
what s the matter  daniel 
you afraid of a little competition 
what i feel for luce is real 
she s different this time 
she deserves more than you can give her 
if you come near her   
you ll what 
how many times do you
have to watch her die 
i love you 
luce 
oh  penn 
luce 
todd 
i m sorry 
i m so  so sorry  it s my fault 
oh  don t say that 
it s true  the shadows
were exactly the same 
  it was the exact same   
  stop it  okay 
you did not cause this 
i won t hear it 
 0k8   
i m so sorry 
did you make a wish 
past lives and destinies 
you want the truth 
she doesn t know me at all 
all it takes is a kiss 
but he knows it s her 
luce  no 
kiss him and you ll die 
who put the curse on them 
it was the devil himself 
daniel  no 
luce  no 
you will die 
you will die 
you feeling better 
every part of me hurts  but i m alive 
well that s something 
i remember 
what 
everything 
the fire 
you carrying me 
being in your arms  it felt like we were   
well you were delirious 
maybe 
but that s not all i remember 
i remember this 
i remember the day this was taken 
what do you mean 
enough 
i know what i know 
my whole life people have
told me that i m crazy 
luce 
let s see if they re right 
no luce  get down from there 
no  luce 
no 
it will always be you  luce 
just as it always has been 
now is not the time for sentimentality 
luce 
i gave you this 
it was a long time ago 
how is this possible 
  it s okay 
  no  every bad thing
that s ever happened to
me is because of that 
no  they can t hurt you  they just observe 
the fires  they killed trevor 
luce  the shadows didn t cause the fire
and neither did you 
they re called announcers 
look 
think of them as windows into the past 
they re attracted to
the most important moments in your life 
what am i seeing 
our lives together 
we ve been in love for thousands of years 
luce  all your visions are real 
so we re reincarnated 
you are 
i m   
an angel 
i m one of the fallen 
stop 
don t do it  luce 
kiss him and you will die 
this is why i tried so hard
to push you away but i can t 
you didn t tell her 
i m so sorry 
unbelievable  you re unbelievable 
what  i don t understand  why 
the curse is my punishment
for not taking a side at the fall 
luce  don t listen to him 
stay  luce  i chose you 
ichoselove 
don t listen to him  luce 
if you kiss him  you will die 
  i ve seen it a thousand times 
  no  this time it s different 
i promise it is different 
he s a liar  luce 
if you stay with me  i can protect you 
you ve seen me in my true form 
this is different 
i can protect you 
this could be our chance 
please 
luce  i can offer you a future 
a life 
i can t lose you again 
i know what i want 
no 
i m still here 
you think you ve beaten the curse 
you have no idea how much danger she s in 
lucifer knows she s not baptized 
i don t understand  tell me why 
he lifted the curse for
himself  not for you 
he ll come for her now 
daniel can t protect you  luce 
i can 
she s safer with me 
there s a natural order to things  daniel 
you can t just do as you please 
well the cycle s been broken 
roland  molly 
luce 
you re coming with me 
keep her safe  i need to deal with cam 
where i m taking her 
i don t want him to follow 
he ll lead lucifer right to us 
they re all angels 
i won t let you take her to lucifer 
i don t answer to him anymore 
you re the one putting
her in danger  daniel 
don t pretend you even care about her 
where are you going 
i can protect her 
stay away from her 
what the heck 
back to your rooms  shut the door 
this is a lockdown 
wait for the all clear 
it s a lockdown  shut the door 
  don t be afraid 
  i m not 
i m not your enemy 
i m not trying to kill her 
then who 
luce  wait 
she set the fire in the library  she   
penn 
no 
no 
go 
luce  your time has come 
i am tired of waiting 
this ends now 
every breath you take keeps daniel
from his rightful place in heaven 
  daniel 
  you are the real curse 
luce 
luce 
sophia  what have you done 
you claim to be a servant of god 
i am  there s a war going on 
loyal soldiers do what they must 
including murder 
you refuse to see the bigger picture 
you always have 
with her gone you d have been
forced to choose a side
and order would have been restored 
thank you 
i don t understand why she d do that 
she s a fanatic  luce 
she fights for god  but she went too far 
why would sophia kill penn 
why did she try to kill me 
you re not baptized 
if you die  it ll be forever 
sophia thought with you gone
i d have no reason to stay on earth
and i d return to heaven 
but cam was right 
lucifer will be coming for you 
which is why i need to
get you somewhere safe 
i know a place  i have friends there 
they ll protect us 
we have to go 
i can t leave now  i can t leave penn 
we ll take care of her 
penn 
she ll come with us  go  please 
luce 
they ll take penn with them 
there s no more time  we have to go 
wait a minute  listen 
my whole life i ve been
searching for the truth 
i ve been trying to figure out who i am 
why i never seem to fit in to the life
that was supposed to be mine 
and now i m terrified 
i have more questions than
i ever have before
but    this is it 
this is who i am 
this is where i belong 
right here  with you
