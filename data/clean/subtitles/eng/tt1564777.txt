with glorious beings
it was perfect
it did not last
lucifer revolted against god
a line was drawn in paradise
a war began
every angel was forced to choose
the holiness of heaven or the chaos
that roiled outside
one angel refused
believing the only thing worth fighting for
was a force we now call love
cast out of heaven
this angel did not fall alone
every angel who had yet to choose
fell in a flash of almighty fury
these are the fallen
exiled from heaven
they wander the earth
banished until the rebel angel
abandons love and takes a side
that was then
this is now
is that it
must be
love you
my baby
i just wish i knew how to help you
ill be fine
look here
its small
i wanted you to have something
to open on your birthday
thank you
i love you
bye dad

tell me lucinda
why do you think youre here

what i dont understand is your decision
doctor segal says that

everybodys saying that
do you understand that if you take
your prescribed medication you can leave

the centre of a lot of attention
both positive and negative

and then maybe if youre feeling
forgiving you can
forget the whole me acoosting you
in the bathroom with too much information

from talking situation

thanks
what if angels actually
walked among us right now here on earth
thats the story of the fallen
angels cast out of heaven
condemned to live
their lives alongside us mere mortals
banished because they
failed to pick a side
in lucifers war against heaven
who can tell me
what the war in heaven was about
todd
good versus evil
no thats too simplistic
lucifer was gods favourite
his brightest light
what caused him to turn from god
anyone
cause his girlfriend dumped him
what happened to the other angels
those that sided with satan
were banished to hell
only the faithful remained in heaven
the angels that didnt choose
they were cast out
they are the fallen
forced to walk the earth
some of the fallen
retained their angelic nature
repented and wait for the chance
to return to heaven
others aligned themselves with lucifer
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos
but neither group can leave this world
because of one of their own
the rebel angel
he rejected both sides of the war
god and lucifer alike
all in his pursuit of human love
the other fallen angels
must remain here on earth
until he chooses a side
in the only war that has ever been waged
the war we still see every day
raging all around us
but surely you learned some of this
in sunday school
no i didnt go to church growing up
really
yeah my parents arent really religious
so you were never baptized
um no
is it supposed to be over the war
i mean theologically speaking
if the devil is still alive
whats to stop him trying
from trying again
excellent question
so any more takers on that bet
yep
keep them rolling roland
luce you poor thing
are you okay
what is going on here is anyone hurt
no really im fine
the food is fine
anything
anything sweetie
definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes with
whipped cream with bananas that sounds
hey
whats taking so long come on
ineedit
mom mom
allocated time completed
allocated time completed
i just cant believe i have to wait
a whole week to talk to them
you know i didnt even
get a chance to say goodbye
you can have my time on tuesday
no
yeah im not gonna use it
ive been here six years
everyone i know is here
and everyone im interested in
talking to is in this room
what about your parents
ive been meaning to ask
how i ended up here
you dont have to tell me
its not a big deal
well after my parents got divorced
neither of them really wanted me around so
they decided that boarding school
was in my best interest
and as soon as my morn saw that brochure
the one with the kids riding horses
and swimming and stuff
that was it
the search was over
i was enrolled and here i am
so youre not a kleptomaniac
manic depressive anorexic cutter
no
my diagnosis is much worse
and im afraid untreatable
i have tdp
tdp
tragically disinterested parents
yeah my parents suck
but theres a pool
but there is a pool
youve gotta be kidding me
dont tell me
is cam in love
that could make things difficult for you
just dont forget who you work for
daniel
i didnt get a chance to
say thanks yesterday
dont mention it
well thank you anyway
theres one more thing
im a little embarrassed to even ask but
well then dont
well ive committed now
im just going to go for it
its just you seem really familiar to me
like i know you from somewhere
is that possible
no
id remember you
because i keep thinking that
ive gotta go alright ill see you later
thank you
hey new girl pretty
eventful first few days
already planning your escape
yeah considering it
you ah you want some breakfast
thats tempting
but im actually running late to class
its better never than late
this is really good
wheres it from
i stole it from the faculty lounge
they have a pretty decent espresso machine
youre incorrigible
thats what they tell me
you dont agree
i just know what i like
and you dont mind
breaking the rules to get it
well
if the risk is worth the reward
i dont see why not
what about you
you dont end up
at sword and cross by following the rules
you got a little rebel in you
im just misunderstood
no i see it
you got a spark
what do you mean
means youre the kind of person whod rather
do whats right than what youre told
it means youre trouble
you think you know me huh
i know what i like
times up
rolands having a party this friday
yeah
its just casual
you can bring a friend
okay
bunch of us get together at the end
of the week to blow off some steam
thanks
arent you in this class
oh ive heard it all before
en garde allez
how well did they think this through
you know giving weapons to
heavily medicated teenagers
with poor impulse control and anger issues
halt
alright change partners
sparks youre up
price lets see
if youve been paying attention
remember what i showed you
not really
en garde
allez
that wasnt terrible
considering it was just your first time
alright
switch partners
grigori come on over
en garde
allez
very good
one more en garde
allez
grigori halt
halt
halt
both of you halt
i give it a week
what about the whole baptism thing
could that affect her
the details dont matter
grigori always finds something to obsess
over but it never makes a difference
now yall just need to relax
and accept that luce is gonna die
and theres nothing you or daniel
or miss sophia can do to stop it
i thought youd never done this before
i havent
my body just took over
like i knew exactly what to do
huh
it was weird have you ever felt that
yeah i was kinda like
that with trigonometry
it all just fell into place
so at first i was like
wow im a genius
but then i remembered that we covered it last
year so i guess thats not as impressive
you got it bad huh
no its not like that
well maybe it is
its just i have these
feelings about daniel
like i know him
like ive known him for a really long time
yeah maybe you guys
went to preschool together or something
well i asked him
if wed met before and he said no
and he basically ran away it was strange
yeah
something definitely not quite hmm
what do you mean
i can get in a lot of trouble
if you tell anybody
what im about to say to you okay
i wont
so i volunteer in the
office for my free period
which i know sounds totally lame
but is actually kind of cool and fun
in its own weird way sort of
turns out randy is totally useless
when it comes to computers
so he asks yours truly
to do the most basic tasks like
find files on his desktop and search for
videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever
meaning
i have full access
to everybodys academic records
ive looked at daniels file
its empty
hes got no home address
no emergency contact nothing
do you like this
yeah
its the same with all those kids
theres just something not quite right
about that whole group
you never hear them talk about
their families or their old schools
they barely ever go to class and its like
they all knew each other from before
wait who do you mean
daniel arrived first
he transferred at the beginning
of last year and then gabbe
the tall blonde
thats always hanging around him
yep 85 percent confectionery
sugar by volume
then arriane
oh yeah she showed me around my first day
and molly serious defective
and roland i have literally no idea
how he passes his weekly pee test
and then mr future 25 years to life
cam transferred in last spring
miss sophia too
shes new this year and totally ignores
everyone except her favourites
well what do you make of it
beats me
i cant believe it
what
im actually going to one
of rolands parties
oh dont you two look lovely
thanks
you do too as always
arent you sweet
is it wrong that i kind of hate her
why because shes a flawless
honeyscented spray tanned
bikini waxed manicured
blondfembot whos always smiling
and is at this moment kissing your crush
yeah pretty much that
it might be wrong but i totally get it
anybody order drinks
im still trying to figure out
how you ended up here
well you invited me remember
thats not what i meant
with the rest of us its obvious right
drugs
vandalism
depression
nymphomania
so why did you end up at a place like this
maybe im not as innocent as i look
hello
hi
is that a flying lotus jacket
yeah
you are such a hipster
in in a good way i mean
like you know
its not like youre trying to be cool
like youre actually cool
wow
ive been accused of a
lot of things in my life
but never that
hey
oh hey thank you
oh is that for me
amazing thank you so much thank you
sure
um
so
is it from a show or

postdilla artist
well thundercat changed my life
well no except maybe for thundercat
have you heard the daylight remix
that bass
exactly
yes
bad memories
so do you still think about him

the boy you killed trevor
you know tall easy on the eyes
well at least he was before
he hooked up with you
now hes not so much to look at
how do you know about him
i know a lot about you crazy luce
get that away from me
ill bet i know you better than
you know yourself
for someone who doesnt like fire
it sure does seem to like you
thats enough
shut up arri before i give you a scar
on your face to match the one on your back
back off molly
are you okay
yeah im fine
what are you doing
just having some fun
with your psycho girlfriend
stay away from luce
you hear me
oh youve lost track cam
you always want what you cant have

theres definitely life in outer space
hey wheres luce
um i dont know
i thought that she was with you
0k8
she doesnt need your kind of help
whos gonna protect her you
you know you lovebirds need
to relax huh its a party
you know im feeling pretty tired
all of a sudden actually
i think im just gonna go

i just cant get past it
what
this feeling that i know you
havent we been through this
yeah but
i dont believe you
there is something between us
and you feel it too dont you
alright okay
youre right
i should have just told you the truth
its
like i realise i havent been
very warm towards you and
youve been a real dick
yeah but believe me
youve got to know
its not because of anything youve done
see theres this girl
gabbe
what no
no not gabbe
no just someone else another girl
i guess you could say
im not with her anymore but
i still love her
what im trying to say is
youre a mess and im
better off without you
something like that
its not that simple
you cant tell someone how to feel
yeah
i wish things could be different
hey dont go
there you are i was worried about you
you left the party without saying goodbye
whats wrong
luce
stop talk to me
i had an interesting conversation
with molly last night
0k8
she knew things about me
things i havent shared with anyone
and
someones been talking to her
someone whos read my file
oh right cause that makes perfect sense
i betrayed your trust to a ruthless
soulless unimaginative bully
with suspect hygiene and poor
language skills in exchange for what
oh two free body piercings
and a prison tattoo
i was sure id get away with it
but you caught me
well at least youre
big enough to admit it
whats wrong really
you have read my file havent you
of course
so then you know about
your shadows
do you still see them
yeah
do you see them right now
no but since ive been here
theyve gotten a lot worse
and im scared
im scared somebodys going to get hurt
no dont be ridiculous
im not
trevor was just standing there
he was just standing there
and we
okay tell me tell me exactly what happened
trevor acted like i didnt exist all year
and then suddenly at this party
he was flirting with me
come up to the cabin with me
just one time i wanted to feel
normal
you want a drink
sure
did you hear that
trevor are you sure that were alone
luce
relax
no
stop stop get off get off
what the hell
please get out of here
whats going on
no no
luce
the shadows were bigger than ever
and then suddenly everything exploded
and i dont know how but i was outside
and trevor didnt make it
trevor
wheres trevor tell me
im so sorry
im so sorry
what did you do you freak
its my fault im so sorry
trevor
and hes dead because
theres something wrong with me
and im really glad you
want to be my friend
but you should stay away from me
because im dangerous
did you want him to die
no
did you try to hurt him
no
well then its not your fault
you dont need to be alone luce
you need a friend
let me help you
why
because thats what friends do
last time we were discussing how it was
lucifers pride that led to the fall
yes
so who can translate
humilitas homines sanctis
angelis similes facit
et superma ex angefis demones fan
anyone
it was pride that turned
angels into devils
what was that luce
it is humility that makes men as angels
it was pride that turned
angels into devils
we have a latin scholar in our midst
no ive never
it was just a guess
so how does that relate to the rebel angel
wasnt it his pride
his stubborn pursuit of love over god
that led to the fallen
being trapped on earth
arriane
im tired of listening to you twist these
religious fables to fit your own beliefs
you tell this story of yours
as is love was a choice
i dont care for your tone
maybe youre just pissed the rebel angel
chose the wrong girl
get out
gladly
id rather burn in hell for all eternity
than have to listen to one more second
of your pious selfsatisfied ravings
that was kind of awesome
yeah
do you think shell get suspended
i doubt she even gets detention
those kids get away with everything
hey i forgot my sweater
ill catch up with you guys
0k8
listen to me
youve got to keep your eye on cam
what are you talking about
i dont believe the statue was an accident
shes in danger
i saw him on the upper floor
just before it happened
why would he do that
you heard she isnt baptized
she needs our protection shes
sorry i just l forgot my sweater
ill go talk to her
hey luce
wait
what
what do you want
nothing
i just thought maybe
we could walk together
oh
sure
what were you working on in class today
nothing its ah
sort of a graphic novel
what kind of story
i guess you could call it a romance
does it have a happy ending
i dont know
you dont know how it ends
no not yet
im sort of stuck to be honest
well lets hear it tell me your story
no no i dont think thats a good idea
no
maybe i could help you with the ending
0k8
its about this boy and this girl
and they love each other more than anything
but they can never be together
why
because theres this curse
every seventeen years they meet
and they fall in love
and then just when theyre happiest
the girl dies
so its a tragedy
what happens to the boy
he waits
he doesnt age or change
he remains in love
years pass and eventually she returns
the same girl
shes changed
she has a new name new family
she has no memory of him
but he knows its her
its her soul
reincarnated
and they fall in love
always
i mean each time its slightly different
there are infinite versions
but the end is always the same
but then all it takes is a kiss
and shes gone
who put the curse on them
it was the devil himself
he was jealous of their love
so he tried to break it
there has to be something
they can do right
hes tried everything
he tries looking for her
then tries to avoid her
tries to run away
from the inevitable heartbreak
but the curse always finds a way
no matter what
the girl in your story
is she the one you mentioned at the pool
the girl youre still in love with
shes the inspiration yeah
this girl
alright you got me its um
i was using you for her
current incarnation
this is meant to be paris
in 1723
its stupid
why me
because youre beautiful
but i messed up the eyes
theres always been
something about your eyes
whats wrong
nothing
tell me about this place
have you been there before
does it matter
yes
why
ive never travelled before
ive never even left the country
but i know that
theres a café just off to the right
and i know it smells like
jasmine after it rains
and i know that the old man that runs the café
is kind to his dog and hes cruel to his wife
and i know these things
because ive been there
and ive been there with you
oh luce come on
dont
dont tell me that im crazy
luce its a drawing alright
its a story thats all
youre lying
i wish i could tell you
what you want to hear
im sorry
blow
happy birthday luce
howd you know
did you make a wish
i cant tell you it wont come true
oh thats okay
i already know what you wished for
oh yeah
whatd i wish for
answers
you want the truth
meet me at the arches at eight
and ill tell you everything
and luce
wear something nice
its party time
look at you
oh wow
is it yours
for tonight
howd you manage that
its rolands special talent
anything you want he can get it for you
am i going to regret this
theres only one way to find out
come on
no way i drive
you really want to start the night by
saying no to the girl
0k8
what am i doing here with you
celebrating
youre good at that
every time i ask you a question
you have some clever
way of avoiding the answer
thats not true
heres an example where did you grow up
see
how come you wont tell me
anything about yourself
because im having a nice time
and i dont want to ruin it
its that bad huh
i prefer this
you promised answers
come on luce its your birthday
im thinking theres something else
you might want
what are you doing
stop
i told you to stay away from her
daniel what are you doing
why because you care so much about her
stop it
stop
no because i know what youre capable of
youre still with lucifer admit it
why dont you tell her daniel
tell her everything
she wants the truth
stop it
just stay away from her
you dont have a say in it
i dont know whats going on here
but it has nothing to do with me
i never bought into that idea that
theres one person youre meant to be with
but my visions are so real
and my feelings are so real
its like past lives or something
i dont know
and everythings connected to daniel
somehow but he keeps pushing me away
and cams hiding something too
so what do you think
i think youre a jerk for not telling me
it was your birthday
but im willing to overlook that
because this is so ridiculously juicy
do you believe in reincarnation
no not at all
i didnt think so either but
there has to be
some sort of explanation for this
hmm
maybe i can help
what are you doing
we just need one more thing
what
how do you know which room todds in
so how does this work exactly
have you got those yearbook photos
todds been working on this really
cool facial recognition algorithm
its not all my code
it was developed at carnegie mellon
but ive tweaked it a little
hes so modest
sorry
this might take a minute
its just searching
luce hello
weve got hits
whoa
look at the name
it must be a relative
oh what
the actual fuck
print it
ill get it
todd im counting on
you having some sort of explanation
because i am really struggling here
i havent got the faintest idea
i love you
lets see what else we can find
its happening again
no
leave me alone
luce everything okay
luce
penn
ive gotta find penn
penn
penn where are you
todd
ive gotta find penn
no
penn
todd
todd
no
here at the school infirmary
we provide the same care
shed receive at the hospital
i want to take her home
the doctors clear she needs to
remain under clinical supervision
for how long
until shes stable
you should get some rest
well call you at the hotel as soon
as luce is able to receive visitors
there was nothing we could have done
i refuse to accept that
i could have warned her
i could have been there
when has that ever helped
it doesnt matter okay
she needs us and we let her down
is this a criminal investigation
not at the moment
the fire was caused by lightning
that report is preliminary
given the similarity to
the trevor beckman case
well definitely want to question her
i dont want you talking to her
without her attorney present
we come together today
to mourn the loss of a dear friend
a kind and generous
whose life was far
too brief to mourn the loss
whose tragic passing comes
as a shock to us all
we will always remember a kind
and generous friend
someone whose company was always a pleasure
and although today
we are understandably overcome with grief
i ask you to have faith that in time
our pain will prove strengthening
and ultimately a testament
to how much todd mattered
and always will
not only was he a loving son
but he was also a kind and generous friend
we must transform our sadness
into something strengthening
thats how we celebrate his life
and ensure his legacy
you show up to his funeral
after you get him killed
i know youre the one doing this
what are you talking about
the statue the fire in the library
you were trying to kill her
killing luce is your thing daniel
dont you dare
whats the matter daniel
you afraid of a little competition
what i feel for luce is real
shes different this time
she deserves more than you can give her
if you come near her
youll what
how many times do you
have to watch her die
i love you
luce
oh penn
luce
todd
im sorry
im so so sorry its my fault
oh dont say that
its true the shadows
were exactly the same
it was the exact same
stop it okay
you did not cause this
i wont hear it
0k8
im so sorry
did you make a wish
past lives and destinies
you want the truth
she doesnt know me at all
all it takes is a kiss
but he knows its her
luce no
kiss him and youll die
who put the curse on them
it was the devil himself
daniel no
luce no
you will die
you will die
you feeling better
every part of me hurts but im alive
well thats something
i remember
what
everything
the fire
you carrying me
being in your arms it felt like we were
well you were delirious
maybe
but thats not all i remember
i remember this
i remember the day this was taken
what do you mean
enough

the fires they killed trevor

and neither did you
theyre called announcers

the most important moments in your life

to push you away but i cant

you claim to be a servant of god
i am theres a war going on
loyal soldiers do what they must
including murder
you refuse to see the bigger picture
you always have
with her gone youd have been
forced to choose a side
and order would have been restored
thank you
i dont understand why shed do that
shes a fanatic luce
she fights for god but she went too far
why would sophia kill penn
why did she try to kill me
youre not baptized
if you die itll be forever
sophia thought with you gone
id have no reason to stay on earth
and id return to heaven
but cam was right
lucifer will be coming for you

get you somewhere safe

theres no more time we have to go
wait a minute listen
my whole life ive been
searching for the truth
ive been trying to figure out who i am
why i never seem to fit in to the life
that was supposed to be mine
and now im terrified
i have more questions than
i ever have before
but this is it
this is who i am
this is where i belong
right here with you
