i must go shell be waiting
and i
you cant go but ill come and tell you everything
so kamasutra the greatest book of love ever written
kama means
love
and sutra means
lessons
very good
so we have it
lessons on love
an ancient book on men and women
and their relationship through life together
now why do we study it you may all ask
when it was written so many hundreds of years ago
because love remains as meaningful
and myterious today as it was then
the kamasutra teaches us the many
ways we use our body for love
it also teaches us
that the ways of love are much deeper
but of course it tells us we must
learn to use our body very well so
lift up your skirts
and look at your
feet
one doesnt pay much attention to ones feet or toes
but believe me when i tell you
if you touch the toes and feet
in a certain way
it can bring great pleasure to you lover
maya is that you
why do i have to wear taras clothes
when she never wears mine
what have i done in my past life
to inherit you from my mother
just because tara and biki drank from
my breast they let you play with her
so what if you bathe with tara
that doesnt mean you can become a maharani yourself
be grateful they let you dance with her
maya
biki
just because youre a prince you think you can spy on me
one day i will be king
and you will be my queen
and my slave
im no ones slave forever
i want to know everything tara knows
you are truly pagli
my mad one
hips just like your mother
and then she dances one jhalak
and the room would be still
youd better deserve those dancing bells she left you
very good maya
we are doing the dance of enticement tara
you are the ones with the beautiful
eyes so play with them
you have to mesmerize with them
dont give up princess tara
come on come on try
wonderful
beautiful dancing maya
come my princess tara
my darling
this is for you
new clothes for me ive never had new clothes
thank you sahib
tara
how is it
looks like leftovers
you can wear it at my wedding
i am going to be married to the great raj singh
such a tender flower
still unopened
women being of tender nature want tender beginnings eh
the wisdom of the kamasutra is such
it teaches us not to rush
for the first 3 days after marriage the girl and the boy
should abstain from sexual pleasures
oh yes
on the 10th night the king will begin gentle love play
to create confidence in you
he will embrace you with the
upper part of his body in darkness
because he doesnt know you well
you should at this time accept his embrace
and allow him to put betel nut in your
mouth
god bless the alliance of our two kingdoms
now lets see if the kings bride
is worth her weight in gold
hes coming
hes so young
small price to pay for such beauty
lets hope shes worth it
tara he likes you
go to your room
and when will this flower open oh my
i wait upon that night
and what a night that will be
please come please come come here
masi
oh maya

seeing things again

just like the tearing of a back tooth
one moment there one moment gone
enough
she is ready for you my son
your good luck charm
one day you are your fathers property
next day you are your husbands property
must be difficult
why not put that around me
i will not do it again if you embrace me
i cannot
you can
you even want to
no please
i will press the marks of my teeth
and nails into your breasts
and i will say i found you this way
and that another man had done it
and what will you say then
i will say i am innocent
who will believe you
maya
maya
you just called me maya
are you trying to read my mind
no
did they not prepare you
didnt they tell you never to question your husband
no
get me the chief courtesan
my name is jai jai kumar
i am the royal sculptor and
i saw you at the kings wedding
you dont know this but you inspire my work
i work in stone like these temples
its hard to believe shes made of stone
why
stone has life
padmini
its not right
dont move
maya
maya
im sorry
let me explain
i work with my hands
i didnt want to frighten you or embarrass you
why do you feel so free to touch me
and dont talk to me as if i was
your servant im not your servant
a servant is a master in disguise
where do you live
come ill walk you home
you do have a home to go to
listen i know somewhere
if you agree i can take you there
she is wonderful she teaches the kamasutra
everything im trying to understand
about love in my work she knows
let me take you to her
when you dance the dance of enticement for a man
you dance like hes the only one left in the world
come on come on try
play
rasa
jai kumar
and to what do we owe this honor
this is maya a new friend
she needs a place to stay
come maya join us
play
so tara was being weighed in gold and she insulted me
before the king so i
you what
i went to the kings chamber
and i gave myself to him the night of his wedding
oh was he as good as his father
oh rasa devi the fuss the shame
shame
now that is an ancient word
when the king i served as chief courtesan went to war
the queen being the dutiful wife she was
washed his feet with holy water
she drank the same water every day he was gone
when he came back
he rode straight to my door
do you think that honored the queen
honor and shame
may be two sides of the same coin
its so beautiful here
you are welcome to live with us here maya
i prepare the girls
some become courtesans in the kings harem
others become wives
i teach my girls the kamasutra
that the art of love is much more than the act itself
come
rest
you have it in you to be a great courtesan maya
reserved maybe for raj singh himself
the king
and why not
no rasa devi never
hush
we shall not speak of it again
you stay here as a daughter
and if you change your mind you come tell me
i used to worship inside temples
until i saw that everything around me was holy
the waterfall
stone
grass
all pure spirit
now like a madman
i worship everything i see
like you
theres a story told
about the neighboring king and his favorite courtesan
this courtesan became pregnant
at the same time as his queen
she gave birth to a son a few days
before the queen had a daughter
the courtesan knew that her son would be considered
a threat to the throne so
the eunuchs would be dispatched to kill her child
she was determined to save him
it was diwali
and the potters came to gift their vessels
suddenly the courtesan had an idea she
begged one of the potters to smuggle
her baby out in an unused urn
did the courtesan see her son again
yes she did
every few years the boy would be dressed as a girl and
smuggled into the inner court
why
men cant enter the harem
so they dressed the boy up
and his mother would take him along secret passages
they would spend a few hours together
then he would be smuggled out
and the courtesan knew that it would be
some time before she saw her child again
a few years later she died
maya come
and this position is called
twining of the creeper
now we add to this what the
kamasutra calls the throbbing kiss
and this is the way for both lovers to have the pleasure
of kissing the lower lip at the same time
this was gentle
what about when love feels intense
on the first union for example or when
angry lovers are reconciled
or when one is intoxicated and full of energy
how can we express our passion then
called by the kamasutra
the blade of the saw
a woman who sees the marks
of her lovers nails on her body
becomes excited again
always remember there should be variety in love sport
jai your padmanis there
there there shes been waiting for hours go
i forgot to return this to you the other day
you touch me and i dont know
if its about your work or
about what
something else dont ask me to name it
is what you do different from them
from the men in the street
youre the same as them arent you
youre accusing me of being the same as those men
ill take you somewhere tonight
and you can see for yourself
but you will have to dress like a man
examining examining
leave im going in as a commoner
can i have some wine
kumar
sahib
you dont know me kumar
tonight im one of you
come here you
there is joy in 3 things
eating meat riding meat and putting meat into meat
i need a woman
chandra bai can you get me a young one
may i entreat you to see a special flower of mine
a virgin as yet unknown to men
i had a virgin not so long ago
a strange girl with a face like a queen
sometimes i still long for her
all the way from the himalayas
padmini herself
a fresh rose of the gutter to bloom only for you
almost the face of a queen
ill take her
enjoying huh
oh rasa
you have seen how some men can be like animals
but it is not all men
i dont believe jai kumar is like that
and since when is woman simply a helpless animal
just like men we are awake and filled with longing
but
no buts
passion remains the spirit behind existence maya
nothing will ever change that
its how we use our passion that is of essence
now we must listen to what kamasutra teaches
that the true union between man and woman
can take us beyond this animal lust into total trust
and merging with the other where each becomes both
imagine such bliss
the story you told me about the courtesan and her son
it was you wasnt it
jai
i made some coconut rice for you
i know you dont usually eat when you work
somethings wrong
what is it tell me
im working differently
but thats good isnt it
shes beautiful
something about being with you has
when i work i see you all the time
youre with me at every moment
is that all you see in me your work
a piece of stone
what if i cant work properly without you
you dont have to we can work together
no
ive never needed anyone
ive never needed to rely on anyone
we cant be together
dont fall in love with me
you were the one that talked about love all the time
and now its facing you you run from it
sometimes things dont make sense immediately
i have known him a few years now
he is used to being alone
be patient maya
be patient
i loved being with him
i would have done anything just to be with him
what kind of love are you talking about real love
if youre looking for real love
youve chosen the hardest task of all
the work for which all other work is but preparation
but i was ready
i wanted to give myself to him
love does not mean surrendering losing yourself
it is a call to ripen
dont look for straight lines maya
life is never like that
i want to understand properly rasa devi
i want to learn about the rules
of love and how to apply them
and if i cant use them on the one i love
ill use them on the ones i dont
teach me im ready
at all times and in all countries
theres ever been a little rivalry
between the chaste and the unchaste
but while some women are born courtesans lets face it
every woman has got an inkling
of the profession in her nature
and makes herself agreeable to the other sex
one of the arts of the courtesan
is that while she involves herself in sex without love
she conducts herself as if love were indeed natural
because we all know that men love
women who apparently love them
but even courtesans should not
always be welcoming because
we must know that men are apt to despise things that
are easily acquired
you can hear all these rules
but remember once the wheel of love is set in motion
there are no rules and no order
salute the day salute the hills and flowers
enough
is this the statue
whose is this
its mine sahib
yours kumar
so imbued is this stone with the warmth of woman
i want to kiss the skin
i have kissed the skin
i have kissed this skin
who is she
a young woman i found
bring her to me
i wish i could sahib but she disappeared
then we must find her
yes sahib
as a reward for your most excellent work kumar
you shall wrestle me
vazir pay the man his weight in gold
sahib
sing
you made her wait
now you will have to wait
listen listen
we are looking for the woman who inspired jai kumar
her skin the color of freshly harvested wheat
her limbs long and languorous
like the creeper
thank you
are you ready my precious child
im frightened
i was frightened too the day they came for me
it is good to be a little frightened
because it means you feel things
come
another courtesan my queen
name
maya
maya
enough
tara
how long do you expect to languish
all day
i was longing to see you
get out
my son has an eye
i trained him
yours
of course
tis the usual custom
the usual custom no longer applies
if a courtesan is not elegantly attired
she will not exhilarate my husband
exhilaration is my department
you get me something new or
we will keep your husband waiting
and im sure i will be blamed for it
he is full of lust and she is in the eye
get her something new and quickly tara
sahib
what news from the stars
there is news of the shah sahib
later
tell me the stars
jupiter the sign of good fortune
is placed in your house of love and marriage
an auspicious time for love
good
sahib we must speak
i said later
vazir matters of state are your affair
as love is mine
adjust
adjust my child
its an old story
he had her on your wedding night
just the way rasa had my husband
there are courtesans and then there are wives
there are dozens like her
but you are queen
the glory of god is in you
oh it was a good night
kumar whose artistry pleases my gods
whatever youve heard in the ring were equal
with or without claws
i can be lethal enough without them
good
you do that again youll have no arms
forgive me sahib
good fight kumar
we have some work to discuss
will you join me tonight
people say i think too much about women
what is there more important to think about
to our great king
who started off a great warrior
and ended as an insect sucking on a poppy flower
vazir
captured
you draw the fleeting moment
show me the eternal
you did make love to maya then
you know her name
i know everything
answer me
im waiting
work can only be an act of love
you will go to china to fetch another
you clumsy son of a whore
yes sahib right away
i have found your girl kumar
sit sit
i tell you she governs me and winds me up at a whim
my moods depend on her
i want to open my eyes to her under me
in the morning
you should be given an audience with her kumar
i want you to carve her across the roof of my room
but if i was god id carve her
across the bright blue sky
poison
bitter as bile
but when taken from childhood
it makes you immune from enemies
my raj
all my life ive lived with your used things
now all your life youll use mine
so
tell me are you happy now
tara
i was young
i had no idea then that what i did that
night would change your life forever
and mine too
you got what you wanted
he desires you
at least one of us is happy
do you think that just because the
king desires me it makes me happy
does it not
no tara it does not
sometimes
when i catch a glimpse of the world outside
trees
sky
i wish we were free like when we were children
tara
