  i must go  she ll be waiting 
  and i 
you can t go  but i ll come and tell you everything 
so  kamasutra  the greatest book of love ever written 
   kama  means   
  love 
and  sutra  means 
lessons 
very good 
so  we have it 
lessons on love 
an ancient book on men and women
and their relationship through life together 
now  why do we study it  you may all ask 
when it was written so many hundreds of years ago 
because love remains as meaningful
and myterious today as it was then 
the kamasutra teaches us the many
ways we use our body for love 
it also teaches us
that the ways of love are much deeper 
but of course  it tells us we must
learn to use our body very well  so   
lift up your skirts
and look at your   
feet 
one doesn t pay much attention to one s feet or toes 
but believe me when i tell you   
if you touch the toes and feet
in a certain way 
it can bring great pleasure to you lover 
maya  is that you 
why do i have to wear tara s clothes 
when she never wears mine 
what have i done in my past life
to inherit you from my mother 
just because tara and biki drank from
my breast they let you play with her 
so what if you bathe with tara 
that doesn t mean you can become a maharani yourself 
be grateful they let you dance with her 
maya 
biki 
just because you re a prince  you think you can spy on me 
one day  i will be king 
and you will be my queen   
and my slave 
i m no one s slave  forever 
i want to know everything tara knows 
you are truly pagli 
my mad one 
hips just like your mother 
and then she dances one jhalak 
and the room would be still 
you d better deserve those dancing bells she left you 
very good  maya 
we are doing the dance of enticement  tara 
you are the ones with the beautiful
eyes  so  play with them 
you have to mesmerize with them 
don t give up  princess tara 
come on  come on  try 
wonderful 
beautiful dancing  maya 
come  my princess tara 
my darling 
this is for you 
new clothes  for me  i ve never had new clothes 
thank you  sahib 
tara 
how is it 
looks like leftovers 
you can wear it at my wedding 
i am going to be married to the great raj singh 
such a tender flower 
still unopened 
women  being of tender nature  want tender beginnings  eh 
the wisdom of the kamasutra is such 
it teaches us not to rush 
for the first 3 days after marriage  the girl and the boy
should abstain from sexual pleasures 
oh  yes 
on the 10th night  the king will begin gentle love play
to create confidence in you 
he will embrace you with the
upper part of his body in darkness 
because he doesn t know you well 
you should at this time accept his embrace 
and allow him to put betel nut in your   
mouth 
god bless the alliance of our two kingdoms 
now let s see if the king s bride
is worth her weight in gold 
he s coming 
he s so young 
small price to pay for such beauty 
let s hope she s worth it 
tara  he likes you 
go to your room 
and when will this flower open  oh  my 
i wait upon that night 
and what a night that will be 
please come  please come  come here 
  masi 
  oh  maya 
that s her 
there she is  my lotus woman 
maybe that was my padmini 
i found her 
  i lost her 
  seeing things again 
  what says the doctor 
  examining  examining 
pulse tells all 
hey  maya 
maya 
easy on those sweets 
that s hot stuff 
aphrodisiacs 
put one in my mouth  maya 
open your mouth and close your eyes 
yes 
forgive me for disturbing you  great king 
your name 
maya 
could you be anything but maya 
i ve brought you something 
some malida to sweeten your tongue 
this is all i need 
this is all i need to sweeten my tongue 
tara   
you re leaving us forever 
tara 
ma  ma  ma   
please get maya for me 
i want to marry her 
this is for you  maya 
tara

but now

maya

maya 
maya  listen to me  listen to me 
think about it 
biki loves you 
you ll be almost like tara 
you a princess  and she  a queen 
i m supposed to just say yes to everything 
to tara s clothes  to her used
dowry  and now to her brother 
it s our destiny  maya 
i ll make my own destiny  masi 
please

she said no 
thank god 
i could never show my face 
daughter marries king  son marries servant girl 
come  ma

please  i beg of you  no 
biki 
i m so sorry 
maya 
masi    oh 
you should better go  my pagli 
  your mother s blessings are with you 
  go 
and take these bells with you 
so the world will know the whore is coming 
for the blood 
i know about the blood 
just put it underneath you at the time of the pain 
what pain 
tell her 
just like the tearing of a back tooth 
one moment there  one moment gone 
enough 
she is ready for you  my son 
your good luck charm 
one day you are your father s property 
next day you are your husband s property 
must be difficult 
why not put that around me 
i will not do it again if you embrace me 
i cannot 
you can 
you even want to 
no  please 
i will press the marks of my teeth
and nails into your breasts 
and i will say i found you this way 
and that another man had done it 
and what will you say then 
i will say i am innocent 
who will believe you 
maya 
maya 
you just called me maya 
  are you trying to read my mind 
  no 
did they not prepare you 
didn t they tell you never to question your husband 
no 
get me the chief courtesan 
my name is jai  jai kumar 
i am the royal sculptor  and
i saw you at the king s wedding 
you don t know this  but you inspire my work 
i work in stone  like these temples 
it s hard to believe she s made of stone 
why 
stone has life 
padmini 
it s not right 
don t move 
maya 
maya 
i m sorry 
let me explain 
i work with my hands 
i didn t want to frighten you or embarrass you 
why do you feel so free to touch me 
and don t talk to me as if i was
your servant  i m not your servant 
a servant is a master in disguise 
where do you live 
come  i ll walk you home 
you do have a home to go to 
listen  i know somewhere 
if you agree  i can take you there 
she is wonderful  she teaches the kamasutra 
everything i m trying to understand
about love in my work  she knows 
let me take you to her 
when you dance the dance of enticement for a man 
you dance like he s the only one left in the world 
come on  come on  try 
play 
rasa 
jai kumar 
and to what do we owe this honor 
this is maya  a new friend 
she needs a place to stay 
come  maya  join us 
play 
so tara was being weighed in gold  and she insulted me
before the king  so i   
you what 
i went to the king s chamber 
and i gave myself to him  the night of his wedding 
oh  was he as good as his father 
oh  rasa devi  the fuss  the shame 
shame 
now  that is an ancient word 
when the king i served as chief courtesan went to war 
the queen  being the dutiful wife she was 
washed his feet with holy water 
she drank the same water every day he was gone 
when he came back   
he rode straight to my door 
do you think that honored the queen 
honor and shame
may be two sides of the same coin 
it s so beautiful here 
you are welcome to live with us here  maya 
i prepare the girls 
some become courtesans in the king s harem 
others become wives 
i teach my girls the kamasutra 
that the art of love is much more than the act itself 
come 
rest 
you have it in you to be a great courtesan  maya 
  reserved maybe for raj singh himself 
  the king 
and why not 
no  rasa devi  never 
hush 
we shall not speak of it again 
you stay here as a daughter 
and if you change your mind    you come tell me 
i used to worship inside temples   
until i saw that everything around me was holy 
the waterfall 
stone 
grass 
all pure spirit 
now  like a madman 
i worship everything i see   
like you 
there s a story told
about the neighboring king and his favorite courtesan 
this courtesan became pregnant
at the same time as his queen 
she gave birth to a son a few days
before the queen had a daughter 
the courtesan knew that her son would be considered
a threat to the throne  so   
the eunuchs would be dispatched to kill her child 
she was determined to save him 
it was diwali 
and the potters came to gift their vessels 
suddenly  the courtesan had an idea  she   
begged one of the potters to smuggle
her baby out in an unused urn 
did the courtesan see her son again 
yes  she did 
every few years the boy would be dressed as a girl and
smuggled into the inner court 
why 
men can t enter the harem 
so they dressed the boy up 
and his mother would take him along secret passages 
they would spend a few hours together 
then he would be smuggled out   
and the courtesan knew that it would be
some time before she saw her child again 
a few years later she died 
maya  come 
and this position is called   
twining of the creeper 
now we add to this what the
kamasutra calls the throbbing kiss 
and this is the way for both lovers to have the pleasure
of kissing the lower lip at the same time 
this was gentle 
what about when love feels intense 
on the first union  for example  or when   
angry lovers are reconciled 
or when one is intoxicated and full of energy 
how can we express our passion then 
called by the kamasutra   
 the blade of the saw  
a woman who sees the marks
of her lover s nails on her body
becomes excited again 
always remember  there should be variety in love sport 
jai  your padmani s there 
there  there  she s been waiting for hours  go 
i forgot to return this to you the other day 
you touch me  and i don t know
if it s about your work or   
about what 
something else  don t ask me to name it 
is what you do different from them 
from the men in the street 
you re the same as them  aren t you 
you re accusing me of being the same as those men 
i ll take you somewhere tonight 
and you can see for yourself 
but you will have to dress like a man 
examining  examining 
leave  i m going in as a commoner 
can i have some wine 
kumar 
sahib 
you don t know me  kumar 
tonight  i m one of you 
come here  you 
there is joy in 3 things 
eating meat  riding meat  and putting meat into meat 
i need a woman 
chandra bai  can you get me a young one 
may i entreat you to see a special flower of mine 
a virgin as yet unknown to men 
i had a virgin not so long ago 
a strange girl with a face like a queen 
sometimes  i still long for her 
all the way from the himalayas 
padmini herself 
a fresh rose of the gutter to bloom only for you 
almost the face of a queen 
i ll take her 
enjoying  huh 
oh  rasa 
you have seen how some men can be like animals 
but it is not all men 
i don t believe jai kumar is like that 
and since when is woman simply a helpless animal 
just like men  we are awake and filled with longing 
  but   
  no buts 
passion remains the spirit behind existence  maya 
nothing will ever change that 
it s how we use our passion that is of essence 
now we must listen to what kamasutra teaches 
that the true union between man and woman
can take us beyond this animal lust into total trust
and merging with the other  where each becomes both 
imagine such bliss 
the story you told me about the courtesan and her son 
it was you  wasn t it 
jai 
i made some coconut rice for you 
i know you don t usually eat when you work 
something s wrong 
what is it  tell me 
i m working differently 
but that s good  isn t it 
she s beautiful 
something about being with you has   
when i work  i see you all the time 
you re with me at every moment 
is that all you see in me  your work 
a piece of stone 
what if i can t work properly without you 
  you don t have to  we can work together 
  no 
i ve never needed anyone 
i ve never needed to rely on anyone 
we can t be together 
don t fall in love with me 
you were the one that talked about love all the time 
and now it s facing you  you run from it 
sometimes things don t make sense immediately 
i have known him a few years now 
he is used to being alone 
be patient  maya 
be patient 
i loved being with him 
i would have done anything just to be with him 
what kind of love are you talking about  real love 
if you re looking for real love 
you ve chosen the hardest task of all 
the work for which all other work is but preparation 
but    i was ready 
i wanted to give myself to him 
love does not mean surrendering  losing yourself 
it is a call to ripen 
don t look for straight lines  maya 
life is never like that 
i want to understand properly  rasa devi 
i want to learn about the rules
of love and how to apply them 
and if i can t use them on the one i love   
i ll use them on the ones i don t 
teach me  i m ready 
at all times and in all countries 
there s ever been a little rivalry
between the chaste and the unchaste 
but while some women are born courtesans  let s face it 
every woman has got an inkling
of the profession in her nature
and makes herself agreeable to the other sex 
one of the arts of the courtesan
is that while she involves herself in sex without love 
she conducts herself as if love were indeed natural 
because we all know that men love
women who apparently love them 
but even courtesans should not
always be welcoming  because   
we must know that men are apt to despise things that
are easily acquired 
you can hear all these rules 
but remember  once the wheel of love is set in motion   
there are no rules and no order 
salute the day  salute the hills and flowers 
enough 
is this the statue 
whose is this 
it s mine  sahib 
yours  kumar 
so imbued is this stone with the warmth of woman 
i want to kiss the skin 
i have kissed the skin 
i have kissed this skin 
who is she 
  a young woman i found 
  bring her to me 
i wish i could  sahib  but she disappeared 
then we must find her 
yes  sahib 
as a reward for your most excellent work  kumar 
you shall wrestle me 
vazir  pay the man his weight in gold 
sahib 
sing 
you made her wait 
now you will have to wait 
listen  listen 
we are looking for the woman who inspired jai kumar 
her skin  the color of freshly harvested wheat 
her limbs long and languorous
like the creeper 
thank you 
are you ready  my precious child 
i m frightened 
i was frightened  too  the day they came for me 
it is good to be a little frightened 
because it means you feel things 
come 
another courtesan  my queen 
name 
maya 
maya 
enough 
tara 
how long do you expect to languish 
all day 
i was longing to see you 
get out 
my son has an eye 
i trained him 
yours 
of course 
 tis the usual custom 
the usual custom no longer applies 
if a courtesan is not elegantly attired 
she will not exhilarate my husband 
exhilaration is my department 
you get me something new  or
we will keep your husband waiting 
and i m sure i will be blamed for it 
he is full of lust  and she is in the eye 
get her something new and quickly  tara 
sahib 
what news from the stars 
there is news of the shah  sahib 
later 
tell me the stars 
jupiter  the sign of good fortune 
is placed in your house of love and marriage 
an auspicious time for love 
good 
sahib  we must speak 
i said later 
vazir  matters of state are your affair 
as love is mine 
adjust 
adjust  my child 
it s an old story 
he had her on your wedding night 
just the way rasa had my husband 
there are courtesans  and then there are wives 
there are dozens like her 
but you are queen 
the glory of god is in you 
oh  it was a good night 
kumar  whose artistry pleases my gods 
whatever you ve heard  in the ring  we re equal 
with or without claws 
i can be lethal enough without them 
good 
you do that again  you ll have no arms 
forgive me  sahib 
good fight  kumar 
we have some work to discuss 
will you join me tonight 
people say i think too much about women 
what is there more important to think about 
to our great king 
who started off a great warrior 
and ended as an insect sucking on a poppy flower 
vazir 
captured 
you draw the fleeting moment 
show me the eternal 
you did make love to maya  then 
you know her name 
i know everything 
answer me 
i m waiting 
work can only be an act of love 
you will go to china to fetch another 
you clumsy son of a whore 
yes  sahib  right away 
i have found your girl  kumar 
sit  sit 
i tell you she governs me and winds me up at a whim 
my moods depend on her 
i want to open my eyes to her under me   
in the morning 
you should be given an audience with her  kumar 
i want you to carve her across the roof of my room 
but if i was god  i d carve her
across the bright blue sky 
poison 
bitter as bile 
but when taken from childhood 
it makes you immune from enemies 
my raj 
all my life  i ve lived with your used things 
now all your life  you ll use mine 
so   
tell me  are you happy now 
tara   
i was young 
i had no idea then that what i did that
night would change your life forever   
and mine  too 
you got what you wanted 
he desires you 
at least one of us is happy 
do you think that just because the
king desires me  it makes me happy 
does it not 
no  tara  it does not 
sometimes   
when i catch a glimpse of the world outside   
trees 
sky   
i wish we were free like when we were children 
tara 
you meet again 
enchanted 
what shall i do 
will you dance 
i like this position 
i did not agree to sculpting by committee  sahib 
allow me the honor of a    an artist s privacy 
maya   
i love you 
you love only yourself 
how naive of me 
maya 
maya 
forgive me  please  i was afraid of losing control 
maya 
you hurt me 
i belong to him now 
no 
i belong to you 
i made a mistake 
take me back 
jai 
i marry you  you marry me 
i marry you 
you marry me 
dr  mani  we believe queen tara is hysterical

her body does not keep from twisting

her heart  please 
so 
her pulse

examining  examining 
sahib 
it seems the opium has made you half a man 
you cannot pass her over 
i ve heard rumors that her own
brother is being courted by the shah 
invaders like the shah  with or without that
hunchback  are no match for my strength 
it is not you that are strong 
it is your neighbors that are weak 
the gods protect me

three

don t worry  we ll blindfold them 
and tie up their hands as well 
 i write this in the interest of the people 
who are being neglected by a debauched king  
  now take this to the shah 
  sahib 
 he has insulted my sister
 and squeezes the common folk
each day  to feed his appetites 
 he has put his affairs entirely in the
hands of his prime minister  the vazir 
 i put myself in your royal hands as an ally 
prince bikram singh  
i want to be alone 
  i want to be alone with you 
  raj 
just you and i    together 
let me lie in your arms 
give me some comfort
