dont pretend like
you dont remember
aah ive waited for this
if you calm down ill try and remember

hey you know what
i do remember
you said if you dont
show up then thats it
because youre a workaholic who
creates work to avoid real work
im still working on that
but to me you see a vacation
cant be an ultimatum
how can you relax on an ultimatum
the whole concept is stressful
you just had to show up i
was looking for a gesture
it didnt have to be
bold just something
screen door squeaking
i just wanted you to show up
hey
i really loved you
sighs
and uh you wrecked everything
all our plans
loose plans

a wellaimed shot from a weapon sounds
like nothing else its like
homerun ball
coming off the bat

i was surrounded by all
this brutal ugliness
philanderers
nothing black and white
soulcrushing mercenaries

i bet the whole
pacific is in play
when did you shoot this
middle of the night
two nights ago
whirring
woman buttkick stick
it to the back nice
allison i called you because i think

your saturday
i got troy and melissa here i
got a girlfriends kid don
have you met a baby named don
no sir hi don
come on this feels more
like a monday kind of thing
tell me everything you know
i dont know whats going on up there
its not an air force launch they let
me know what they want me to know
private moneys running the
whole thing we work for them
this is the new
military captain
kesha could launch a satellite
she doesnt have to tell us whats
on it either no treaty for that
this one looks like a dualpurpose
launch vehicle that will amp up
a worldwide rush to fill
the skies with weapons
i didnt get the memo on that we
dont know whats on this launch
if thats true were in worse
trouble than i thought
dont resign all right youd have
better luck talking to privateers
contractors are
running everything
global one is running the
lead on this operation
its carson welchs rocket
gilcrest
how much does
gilcrest know sir
now that hes back with welch
how much does he not know
cash register beeping
you know what ill
take that hat too
indistinct chatter
whispers
oh boy am i a goner
hello sir
hello captain
it is a victory and an honor to
steal you away this afternoon
got you a peppermint tea ahem
oh the hat
you must be wondering about this
hat this hat serves no purpose
the entire idea of including
sunglasses in the actual hat
is ridiculous and
unwieldy in execution
yet somehow ahem
you lost your sunglasses and
somebody stole your badass look
anyway heh
you may now wear the hat
i understand your reluctance
i know what it represents
my first civilian gift to you
and what do i really
have to offer you
everybody ive gotten close to ive
managed to detach myself in some way
and frankly just floating the
idea of you and me as a couple
all i see are problems i am
talking about world chaos
im talking about
panic in the streets
demonstrations riots problems with
your promotion strange incidents
and lets just be honest
itll end as it began
a flicker of an impossible dream and
an avalanche of emotional chaos
and im sorry but
im in for all of it
sniffles
whimpering
is that a yes
i think i have an allergy
its going around you loving the hat
i feel silly
well you wear silly well
i know what you know
what
stop with the games
oh my god i got
personal with you
i never get personal

believed you you told me not to
no you got this all wrong
i didnt come here to argue
you came to knife me in a gutandrun
i know the type i am the type
what am i saying
sighs
oh
i need you to believe in me
i know what you know

you lied to everybody
you knew about the launch

you were distracting those
hawaiians and giving them what

protect our country
our american culture
you cant stop the future with
one silly desperate act
ill build another rocket
there was a second
payload with weapons
and you almost got
it by everybody
youre about to become the
single biggest joke
in the history of aerodynamic flight
cant hurt me ive been dead before
not like this pally
your life is gonna
become very
very complicated
just remember the general
always speaks first
dont say a word you let him say what he
has to say you sit there you take it
hopefully the holiday spirit
will have him in a good mood
happy new years general
aah
happy new year
and the general is here
dixon gilcrest is
here thats why
mmhm
well i remember the good times
there were no good times
how does it feel to set back our
footprint in the pacific by a decade
you cost us our prime new
partner future missions
a new space command
center all gone
because carson welch canceled
his contract with us and why
why did it all go bad because
cool guy here mr sexy pants
brian gilcrest
lost brave angel
you did that
and now youre gonna go to the
hill and you are gonna testify
and oh it will not go well
the best you can
hope for is some
trailerpark honey falls
in love with you
on cspan and you get a conjugal
visit every other month
always in the presence of
a chaperone named tex
good times
just around the bend
general there was a weaponized
second payload on brave angel
weapons you think you saw weapons
let me tell you what you saw
you saw a complex philanthropic
telecommunications satellite
mooventure between
global one and facebook
designed to help six povertystricken
countries in the pacific rim
now teenagers in equatorial new guinea
cant meet and date because of you
nobody tells me anything
i didnt know that
shut up and keep flexing
your crazy fingers
i told you he would be a disaster
yes sir
and one more thing mr
threeday beard boy

weve got six and a half
years invested in her
shes part of hillary clintons
star guard know what that is
well neither do i

she likes her salute
and so do we
stay away from our girl
man current lat and

tracy poor gilcrest you took
the vanity road didnt you
you ruined yourself
to impress a girl
and did you get the girl

mm

well thats too bad
she was a good one
mm
i got you a new santa
claus very strong neck
they were giving them
away christmas is over
its the holiday of chill
hahaha
brian that is bizarrely sweet of
you and completely unnecessary
guess what
what
woody wrote me a letter
youre kidding
mmmm
nope words and everything
really
dear tracy
you asked me to speak my mind
so here it is my mind
do not penalize me for not being
one of those flowery people
who shoot their feelings in a spray
like a fire hydrant on a summer day
no worry about that hahaha
hahaha
ive never seen him do that
i just hated the way you changed
when gilcrest came back to town
but i dont like to hate
its bad for my brain
every night
when i come home i start fresh
i dont bring what happens
up there down here
i may not be the original
owner of your heart
but i am the better owner and
a much healthier option too
exclamation point there
mom theres a new
santa outside
hi
hi
i liked him a little
better when he was silent
hahaha but keep going
you have no
you have no idea the
fear you calm in me
every night i come back home
through that squeaky back door
sniffles
aloha woody
well anywhere you turn
somebodys heart breaks
well come on
you gotta take a big bite out of
your life your husband wrote that
are you trying to
play matchmaker now
i was on the fence till the door
part but that was the final blow
oh really
i didnt even hear that squeaky door
i think i
i just completely lack
that romantic gene
just noise to me
es your gulf
my opinion
go be with captain ng
that girl lit up your sky
whew no i messed that up
trust a girl whos been on the other
side of your mega messups in the past
take those blue
eyes and go to her
thudding
brian yeah you dont want
it to be taut all right
you want it to billow
and thats how you hang a flag

nobody knew everything except
welch

youve lost your tongue when
you fall from the pendulum
your heart is a drum
right on
keeping time with everyone
everyone if they drown
from the undertow
need to find someone to
show me how to play it slow
and just let it go
your eyes get stung by the
rays of the sinking sun
you fallow the drum
keeping time with everyone
going beat beat beat
its beating me down
beat beat beat beat
its beating me down
day after day its
turning around
till all my days
are drowning out
stars above my head
they will fall
i will be the moon
the moon is full
when all is said and done
we all we come from the sun
and the thing that
was close enough
and its me and
you up above
be afraid of all
that you can see
and dont delay the
way you want to be
when all is said and done
and its me and
you up above
now is always the time
to do whats yours is mine
we all know harm and todo
we are all warm bloods too
when all is said and done
we all we come from the sun
and the thing that
was close enough
and its me and
