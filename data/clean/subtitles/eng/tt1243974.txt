and felt the future 
it belonged to me 
  i know you ve deceived
me now here s a surprise  
hey  hey  man  check this out 
brian  then 2008 happened 
budgets crashed 
nasa was just another
business looking for cash

satellite pirates with deep pockets 
drunk with the idea of ruling the world

the biggest billionaire of them all

allison  i think the
sky is speaking to us 
something s coming 
you know this is all metaphorical 
this is how hawaii works 
we speak money  they
speak myths and sky   
but the sky doesn t
actually speak   
and give an opinion 
that was all about land 
cash and cell phones 
nothing s sacred 
it s all for sale 
tell me you don t
believe in the sky 
you think it s
just air up there 
it s the future 
that is the pull of the unknowable 
that s the answer to every question 
let s just keep it to the
gate and the blessing 
cell phones  mountain 
blessing on sunday

woody doesn t speak

he s a great dad 
i don t think i m ready to talk

to you like a girlfriend  heh 
he is a great dad  he s a really
great dad when he s here 
and he got us this corner house 
and i really don t wanna lose it 
so things are good 
i m not sure if it s supposed to make
it easier with him  you know  flying   
to all these confidential locations
and not being able to tell me or   
i m just    i m
stressed  i m stressed 
i m stressed all the time  and
if i m stressed in hawaii   
i mean  can you imagine what i
would be like somewhere else 
you even recognize the girl who ran
through sheppard s field naked   
  after a cure concert 
  who could forget that girl 
  you know what 
  what 
don t ever have any regrets 
  i m totally girlfriend ing you right now 
  i like it 
i don t even remember
why we broke up 
ha  ha  ha  because you didn t
show up on our vacation 
i didn t mean to actually
talk about that 
i had three days planned
in san francisco 
i had things for us to do and things to
tell you  and you  um  stayed in guam 
guam  really 
don t pretend like
you don t remember 
aah  i ve waited for this 
  if you calm down  i ll try and remember 
  i m calm  this feels good 
hey  you know what 
i do remember 
you said   if you don t
show up  then that s it  
because you re a workaholic who
creates work to avoid real work 
i m still working on that 
but to me  you see  a vacation
can t be an ultimatum 
how can you relax on an ultimatum 
the whole concept is stressful 
you just had to show up  i
was looking for a gesture 
it didn t have to be
bold  just something 
 screen door squeaking 
i just wanted you to show up 
hey 
i really loved you 
 sighs 
and  uh  you wrecked everything 
all our plans 
loose plans 
and i put it back
together by myself 
i found a life in spite of you 
and you need to hear this   
because i ve waited a long time to
tell you this  you need to hear this 
maybe not all of it 
you can t just let people go

  with her naughty glance
and charming hula dance  
  she made me want
to linger and play  
  naughty hula eyes
that slyly hypnotize  
  that cast a spell
right from the start  
  okay  do you see what i mean 
  no  he said a lot  actually 
what did he say 
well  for starters  he said 
 sighs 
 good evening 
welcome to my home  
then he walked over to me and put his
hand on my shoulder and he said

  i don t know what s going on up there 
it s not an air force launch  they let

private money s running the
whole thing  we work for them 
this is the new
military  captain 
kesha could launch a satellite 
she doesn t have to tell us what s
on it either  no treaty for that 
this one looks like a dual purpose
launch vehicle that will amp up   
a worldwide rush to fill
the skies with weapons 
i didn t get the memo on that  we
don t know what s on this launch 
if that s true  we re in worse
trouble than i thought 
don t resign  all right  you d have
better luck talking to privateers

lead on this operation

hello  captain 
it is a victory and an honor to
steal you away this afternoon 
got you a peppermint tea  ahem 
oh  the hat 
you must be wondering about this
hat  this hat serves no purpose 
the entire idea of including
sunglasses in the actual hat   
is ridiculous and
unwieldy in execution 
yet somehow  ahem   
you lost your sunglasses and
somebody stole your badass look 
anyway  heh   
you may now wear the hat 
i understand your reluctance 
i know what it represents 
my first civilian gift to you 
and what do i really
have to offer you 
everybody i ve gotten close to  i ve
managed to detach myself in some way 
and frankly  just floating the
idea of you and me as a couple   
all i see are problems  i am
talking about world chaos 
i m talking about
panic in the streets 
demonstrations  riots  problems with
your promotion  strange incidents 
and let s just be honest 
it ll end as it began 
a flicker of an impossible dream and
an avalanche of emotional chaos 
and i m sorry  but   
i m in for all of it 
 sniffles 
 whimpering 
is that a yes 
  i think i have an allergy 
  it s going around  you loving the hat 
i feel silly 
well  you wear silly well

what 
stop with the games 
oh  my god  i got
personal with you 
i never get personal 
  i had fun with you 
  good 
  i believed you  heh 
  good 
that s   
  you told me not to 
  no  no  no 
might be the worst part  i
believed you  you told me not to 
  no  you got this all wrong 
  i didn t come here to argue 
you came to knife me in a gut and run 
i know the type  i am the type 
what am i saying 
 sighs 
oh 
i need you to believe in me 
i know what you know 
and what do i know 
you lied to everybody 
you knew about the launch 
you knew about that asat rocket 
you were distracting those
hawaiians and giving them what  
property they already owned
a thousand years ago 
  i don t have mountains to give them 
  you let me lie to the hawaiians 
i m hawaiian  you
lost your signal 
you are lost 
hey

good luck with your career 
i m sure you re gonna get nro  find
somebody else to recommend you

  you tell me 
i m here because you
needed a babysitter 
i volunteered to
be your watchdog 
i defended you when everybody said 
 you better watch out for that guy 
he s morally bankrupt and the guy
you get to do your dirty work  
who s everybody  everybody
in the streets 
in the world  were they all gathered
at a mountaintop and sing to you 
your cynicism is
astounding  mr  gilcrest 
thank you for the hat  by the
way  it s a nice souvenir 
  are there weapons in it

you can t stop the future with
one silly  desperate act 
i ll build another rocket 
there was a second

single biggest joke   
  in the history of aerodynamic flight 
  can t hurt me  i ve been dead before

your life is gonna
become very   
very complicated 
just remember  the general

has to say  you sit there  you take it 
hopefully  the holiday spirit
will have him in a good mood 
happy new year s  general 
aah 
  happy new year 
  and the general is here 
dixon  gilcrest is
here  that s why 
mm hm 
  well  i remember the good times 
  there were no good times 
how does it feel to set back our
footprint in the pacific by a decade 
you cost us our prime new
partner  future missions   
a new space command
center  all gone   
because carson welch canceled
his contract with us  and why 
why did it all go bad  because
cool guy here  mr  sexy pants   
brian gilcrest 
lost brave angel 
you did that 
and now you re gonna go to the
hill and you are gonna testify 
and  oh  it will not go well 
the best you can
hope for is some
trailer park honey falls
in love with you   
on c span  and you get a conjugal
visit every other month   
always in the presence of
a chaperone named tex 
good times 
just around the bend 
general  there was a weaponized
second payload on brave angel 
weapons  you think you saw weapons 
let me tell you what you saw 
you saw a complex  philanthropic
telecommunications satellite   
moo venture between
global one and facebook 
designed to help six poverty stricken
countries in the pacific rim 
now teenagers in equatorial new guinea
can t meet and date because of you 
nobody tells me anything 
i didn t know that 
shut up and keep flexing
your crazy fingers 
  i told you he would be a disaster 
  yes  sir

man  current lat and

tracy  poor gilcrest  you took
the vanity road  didn t you 
you ruined yourself
to impress a girl 
and did you get the girl 
  no  i didn t 
  mm 
close  though 
well  that s too bad 
she was a good one 
mm 
i got you a new santa
claus  very strong neck 
they were giving them
away  christmas is over 
  it s the holiday of chill 
  ha ha ha 
brian  that is bizarrely sweet of
you and completely unnecessary 
  guess what 
  what 
  woody wrote me a letter 
  you re kidding 
mm mm 
nope  words and everything 
really 
 dear tracy  
you asked me to speak my mind 
so here it is  my mind 
do not penalize me for not being
one of those flowery people   
 who shoot their feelings in a spray
like a fire hydrant on a summer day  
  no worry about that  ha ha ha 
  ha ha ha 
i ve never seen him do that 
 i just hated the way you changed
when gilcrest came back to town  
but i don t like to hate 
it s bad for my brain 
every night   
when i come home  i start fresh 
i don t bring what happens
up there down here 
i may not be the original
owner of your heart   
 but i am the better owner and
a much healthier option too  
exclamation point there 
mom  there s a new
santa outside 
  hi 
  hi 
i liked him a little
better when he was silent 
  ha ha ha  but keep going 
 you have no    
you have no idea the
fear you calm in me   
every night i come back home
through that squeaky back door 
 sniffles 
 aloha  woody  
well  anywhere you turn 
somebody s heart breaks 
well  come on 
you gotta take a big bite out of
your life  your husband wrote that 
are you trying to
play matchmaker now 
i was on the fence till the door
part  but that was the final blow 
  oh  really 
  i didn t even hear that squeaky door 
i think i   
i just completely lack
that romantic gene 
just noise to me 
e s your gulf 
my opinion 
go be with captain ng 
that girl lit up your sky 
whew  no  i messed that up 
trust a girl who s been on the other
side of your mega mess ups in the past 
take those blue
eyes and go to her 
 thudding 
brian  yeah  you don t want
it to be taut  all right 
you want it to billow 
and that s how you hang a flag 
i like it 
 door opening 
 chuckles 
 sighs 
 gasps 
 tracy chuckles 
mm

hearing  gilcrest 
dixon  congratulations

your buddy carson welch was setting
a nuclear outpost for himself   
up in the sky

  lacy  he hid it from everybody 
he wanted to arm america
with his own nuke 
he would ve owned the sky  he
would ve been his own country 
everybody knew a little  but
nobody knew everything except   
welch 
  it ll all be labeled as a malfunction 
  it was a bit messy 
but you made us look good  i ll
take all the credit  of course 
interpol and our guys are taking over 
they re picking carson up in japan   
in just about 30 seconds 
  hey now did i
hear your voice  
  ringing out in
the early morn  
 laughing 
  did i hear you singing
right through the night  
  out there while
i was rolling   
  love is all  
  a white dove in the
snow mama froze  
 chuckles

into space  drop your bat  go out on a hit

  as the light of day  
  you re falling down
across your lost highway  
  pam bees fl  hurt this way   
  to come so far to find
they ve closed the gates

  you ve lost your tongue when
you fall from the pendulum  
  your heart is a drum  
right on 
  keeping time with everyone  
  everyone if they drown
from the undertow  
  need to find someone to
show me how to play it slow  
  and just let it go  
  your eyes get stung by the
rays of the sinking sun  
  you fallow the drum  
  keeping time with everyone  
  going beat beat beat
it s beating me down  
  beat beat beat beat
it s beating me down  
  day after day  it s
turning around  
  till all my days
are drowning out  
  stars above my head  
  they will fall  
  i will be the moon  
  the moon is full  
  when all is said and done  
  we all we come from the sun  
  and the thing that
was close enough  
  and it s me and
you up above  
  be afraid of all
that you can see  
  and don t delay the
way you want to be  
  when all is said and done  
  and it s me and
you up above  
  now is always the time  
  to do what s yours is mine  
  we all know harm and to do  
  we are all warm bloods too  
  when all is said and done  
  we all we come from the sun  
  and the thing that
was close enough  
  and it s me and
