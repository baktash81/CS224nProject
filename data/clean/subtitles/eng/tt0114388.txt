you will see in my will the estate
of norland was left to me in a way
that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families
norland in its entirety
is therefore yours by law
and i am happy for you and fanny
but your stepmother my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year
barely enough to live on
nothing for the girls dowries
you must help them
of course
you must promise to do this
i promise father
i promise
help them what do you mean
i mean to give them 3000 the
interest will be an extra income
the gift will fulfil my promise
without question more than amply
one had rather on such occasions
do too much than too little
of course he did not stipulate
a particular sum
what do you say to 1500 then
what brother would be so kind to his
real sisters let alone halfblood
they can hardly expect more
what can you afford
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1500 at once
should she live longer than 15 years
wed be completely taken in
people live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise youre right
im convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money
they will have 500 a year
what more could they want for
no housekeeping carriage horses
few servants keeping no company
how comfortable
they will be much more able
to give you something
marianne
can you play something else
mamma has been weeping
since breakfast
i meant something less mournful
a visitor in my own home
it is not to be borne elinor
mamma we have nowhere to go
john and fanny will be here soon
do you expect me to be here
to welcome them vultures
i will start making inquiries
for a new house at once
until then we must try
to bear their coming
margaret are you there come down
john and fanny will be here soon
why are they to live at norland
they have a house in london
houses go from father to son not
father to daughter it is the law
come well play with your atlas
its not mine its their atlas
do sit down
we are looking for a new home and
can only retain thomas and betsy
we re sorry
to have to leave you all
but we are certain you will find the
new mrs dashwood a fair mistress
my only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out
how is mrs ferrars
she is always in good health
my brother is with her this season
quite the most popular bachelor
he has his own barouche
you have two brothers
yes edward is the elder
hes travelling up from plymouth
and will break his journey here
if that is agreeable to you
dear john
this is your home now
fanny wants the key to the silver
what does fanny want with it
one can presume she wants
to count it what are you doing
gifts for the servants where is
margaret shes taken to hiding
at least she can escape fanny
youve not said a word to her
i have
ive said yes and no
good morning fanny
good morning miss marianne
how did you find the silver
was it all genuine
when may we expect your brother
edward is due tomorrow
he will not stay long will margaret
give up her room for him
the view is incomparable and i
want him to see norland at its best
mrs dashwood
miss dashwood miss marianne
my brother edward ferrars
do sit down
where is miss margaret im
beginning to doubt of her existence
forgive us mr ferrars my youngest
is shy of strangers at present
i am shy of strangers myself
and i have nothing like her excuse
how do you like your view
mr ferrars
very much your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept
stables
your windows overlook the lake
an error led me to a family room
but ive rectified the situation
i am happily installed
in the guest quarters
tea
theyre all spoilt miss margaret is
always up trees and under furniture
ive barely had a civil word
from marianne
theyve just lost their father
their lives will never be the same
that is no excuse
library
these are mostly foreign
indeed magnificent
ive never liked the smell of books
the dust perhaps i hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove
i shall have it knocked down
to make place for a grecian temple
that does sound interesting
would you show me the site
too expensive and we do not need
four bedrooms we can share
this one then
we have only 500 a year
ill send out more inquiries today
pardon my intrusion but i think i
have found what you re looking for
wont you come out
we havent seen you all day
well have to enlarge it mattocks
will help you adjust to our hours
forgive me do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas
i believe so
i must check the niles position
my sister tells me
it is in south america
no
no shes quite wrong
i believe it is in belgium
surely not
you must be thinking of the volga
the volga which starts in
in vladivostok and ends in
wimbledon
yes where coffee beans come from
the source of the nile
is in abyssinia
is it interesting
how do you do edward ferrars
margaret dashwood
it adjoins this property
and would be a desirable addition
ill ride there and speak to
gibson
hell be pleased enough to sell
hell want more than it is worth
have i hurt you
thank you
forgive me
that was my fathers favourite
thank you for helping margaret
shes changed since you came
i enjoy her company
has she shown you the tree house
not yet
would you do me the honour
miss dashwood
it is very fine out
with pleasure
margaret always wanted to travel
i know shes off to china soon
im to go as her servant on the
understanding ill be badly treated
what will your duties be
sword fighting and swabbing
which will take precedence
aii i have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life
but my mother is determined
to see me distinguished
orator politician even a barrister
would do if i drove a barouche
what do you wish for
i prefer the church but that is not
smart enough for my mother
she prefers the army
but that is too smart for me
would you stay in london
i hate london
country living is my ideal a small
parish where i might do some good
keep chickens
give very short sermons
you feel idle and useless
imagine how that is compounded
when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever
our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same
except that you will inherit
your fortune
we cannot even earn ours
perhaps margaret is right
piracy is our only option
what is swabbing exactly
no voice divine the storm allayed
no light propitious shone
when snatched from all effectual
aid we perished each alone
but i beneath a rougher sea and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he
no edward
no voice divine the storm allayed
no light propitious shone
when snatched from all effectual
aid we perished each alone
can you not feel his despair
try again
no voice divine the storm allayed
no light propitious shone
when snatched from all effectual
aid we perished each alone
mamma
look
this has just arrived
i should be pleased to offer you a
home at barton cottage as soon
its from sir john middleton
even elinor must approve the rent
has she not yet seen this
no i will fetch her
wait let us delay
i believe that edward and elinor
have formed an attachment
it would be cruel to take her away
so soon devonshire is so far
do you disapprove her choice
by no means
edward is very amiable
amiable but
there is something wanting
he is too sedate his reading
elinor has not your feelings
can he love her can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections
to love is to be on fire
like juliet guinevere heloise
they made rather pathetic ends
pathetic to die for love
what could be more glorious
your romantic sensibilities
is love a fancy or a feeling no
it is immortal as immaculate truth
tis not a blossom shed
when youth drops from lifes stem
it grows without water nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom
a pity
edward has no passion for reading
you asked him to read
then you made him nervous
your behaviour is cordial you
like him in spite of his reading
i think him everything
that is amiable and worthy
praise indeed
he shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother
what shall i do without you
without me
im sure you will be very happy
but promise you wont live far away
there is no question of
do you love him
i do not deny that i think
very highly of him that i
greatly esteem him
i like him
esteem like use these words again
and i shall leave the room
believe my feelings to be stronger
further than that do not believe
is love a fancy or a feeling
or a ferrars
go to bed
i do not deny
that i think very highly of him
that i greatly esteem him
that i like him
we are so happy
that you invited edward to norland
were all very fond of him
we have great hopes for him
mother expects much of him
and in marriage shes determined
both he and robert will marry well
but i hope she desires them
to marry for love
the heart doesnt always lead us
in the most suitable direction
edward is a compassionate person
penniless women prey on that type
having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word
but it would lead to his ruin
im worried mother will withdraw
all financial support from him
should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves
i understand you perfectly
devonshire
my cousin sir john middleton
has offered us a small house
he must be a man of property
hes a widower from barton park
it is barton cottage he has offered
a cottage charming
a cottage is always very snug
you will not leave
before the summer
we can no longer trespass
upon your sisters goodwill
you will come and stay with us
i should like that
edward has long been expected
by our mother
come as soon as you can edward
remember you re always welcome
cant you take him with you
we cant afford him
perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen forgive me
miss dashwood
elinor i must speak to you
there is something of
great importance that i need to
tell you
about my education
your education
yes
it was conducted
oddly enough in plymouth
do you know it
plymouth no
i was four years there
in a school run by mr pratt
pratt
precisely pratt
while i was there
that is to say he had a
has a
you re needed in london
this instant
im leaving this afternoon
mamma wishes you to leave at once
excuse me
edward promised
he would bring the atlas to barton
ill wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight
dear edward
hello there
sir john
dear ladies
upon my word here you are
sir john your kindness
none of that hush please
here is my dear mammainlaw
mrs jennings
you must be mrs dashwood was
your journey tolerable poor souls
why did you not
come up to the park first
we saw you pass
i made john call the carriage
she would not wait
we have so little company
i feel as though i know you already
delightful creatures
youll dine at barton park daily
dear sir john we cannot
no refusals im quite deaf to them
but i insist
let us settle in
but thank you very much
send your man up for the carriage
as soon as youre ready goodbye
dont thank us
your feet are cold
what have you been doing
you can grow potatoes in this dirt
its cold im cold
where can brandon be
i hope hes not lamed his horse
col brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county
he is bound to go for one of you
hes a better age for miss dashwood
but i dare say shes left her heart
behind in sussex
i see you miss marianne i think
ive unearthed a secret
you are worse than my best pointer
is he a butcher baker candlestick
maker ill winkle it out of you
shes good at winkling
weve none of us any secrets here
or if we do
we do not keep them long
hes curate of the parish
or perhaps a handsome lieutenant
give us a clue is he in uniform
he has no profession
hes a gentleman
you know there is no such person
there is his name begins with f
f a promising letter
foster
forrest fotheringay featherty
fortescue
fondant
might i play your pianoforte
yes of course
we dont stand on ceremony here
please forgive
i cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house
brandon come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours
what a pity you re late
you have not heard our songbird
a great pity
this is my good friend col brandon
we served in the east indies
not a better fellow in the world
youve been to the east indies
whats it like
hot
the air is full of spices
now miss dashwood
its your turn to entertain us
and i believe i know
what key you will sing in
f major
you have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions
you told me
i told you nothing
theyll meet him when he comes
you dont speak of such things
everyone else was
mrs jennings is not everyone
i like her she talks about things
we never talk about things
if you can say nothing appropriate
limit your remarks to the weather
surely they have enough reeds
for a moses basket
you know what they re saying
word is youve developed a taste
for certain company and why not
a man like you in his prime
shed be a fortunate young lady
marianne dashwood would
no more think of me than of you
dont think of yourself so meanly
and all the better for her
besotted an excellent match
hes rich and shes handsome
how long have you known him
as long as ive been here
and i came 15 years back
his estate is but four miles hence
he and john are very thick
he has no wife and children
he had a tragic history
he loved a ward to the family
they were not permitted to marry
on what grounds
eliza was poor
she was flung out of the house
and he was packed off to the army
i think hed have done himself harm
if not for john
what became of the lady
she was passed from man to man
she disappeared from good society
when brandon returned from india
he searched and searched
only to find her dying
in a poorhouse
i thought my daughter charlotte
might have cheered him up
look at him now
so attentive
i should try a little experiment
please let the colonel alone
all suitors need a little help
we havent heard you play of late
you have a superior musician here
brandon shares your passion for
music he plays the pianoforte well
you know as many melancholy tunes
as miss marianne
you must play us a duet
let us see you both side by side
i do not know any duets
forgive me colonel
will we never have peace the rent
is low but it comes on hard terms
mrs jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone elses daughters
theres a parcel arrived
look
when is a man safe from such wit
if infirmity does not protect him
if he is infirm
then i am at deaths door
he complained of rheumatism
a slight ache was his phrase
edward said
he would bring it himself
it gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner
business prevents my delivering it
which will hurt me more than you
memories of your kindness must
sustain me and i remain
your devoted servant
ec ferrars
why hasnt he come
he says hes busy dear
he said hed come why hasnt he
im taking you for a walk
it is going to rain
it is not going to rain
i fear
mrs jennings is a bad influence
you must miss him elinor
we are not engaged mamma
but he loves you dearest
i am by no means assured of that
and had he such a preference
there would certainly be obstacles
to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar
but your heart must tell you
it is better to use ones head
it cant be good for me
it is stop complaining
its giving me a cough
it is not giving you a cough
its lovely come on catch up
over there is a field of rabbits
i dont want to see rabbits
is anything superior to this
i told you it would rain
blue sky let us chase it
im not supposed to run
are you hurt
i cannot walk run and fetch help
i will run as fast as i can
margaret
dont be afraid hes quite safe
are you hurt
only my ankle
may i have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks
it is not broken
can you put your arm about my neck
allow me to escort you home
at last
she fell down and hes carrying her
marianne are you hurt
its a twisted ankle
its not serious
i felt the bone and its sound
i cannot begin to thank you
do not think of it
will you not be seated
id leave a water mark
but permit me to call tomorrow
we shall look forward to it
ill show you out
margaret get the gentlemans hat
his name
to whom are we so much obliged
john willoughby of allenham
at your service
john willoughby of allenham
what an impressive gentleman
he lifted me as if i weighed no more
than a dried leaf
tell me if i hurt you
she feels no pain mamma
margaret ask betsy to make up
a cold compress
please dont say anything important
he expressed himself well
with decorum and honour
and spirit and wit and feeling
and economy ten words at most
change or youll catch a cold
what care i for colds
youll care when your nose swells
youre right help me
hes worth catching marianne must
not have all the men to herself
but what do you know of him
theres not a bolder rider
but what are his tastes
his passions his pursuits
he has a smart little pointer
where is allenham
nice little estate three miles east
he is to inherit it from a relative
lady allen is the name
its col brandon
i should go out and keep watch
youre looking out for willoughby
youll not think of brandon now
come in
good morning brandon
how is the invalid
thank you so much colonel
why set your cap at willoughby when
youve already made such a conquest
ill not set my cap at anyone
lady allens nephew
he visits for hes to inherit
he has a pretty estate of his own
combe magna in somerset
id not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills
the man himself come brandon
we know when we are not wanted
thank you so much for calling
marianne the colonel and sir john
are leaving
goodbye
thank you for the flowers
how do you do colonel
how do you do more like
mr willoughby what a pleasure
the pleasure is all mine
miss marianne has not caught cold
youve found out my name
the area is crawling with my spies
you cannot venture out to nature
so nature must be brought to you
how beautiful
these are not from the hothouse
mine is not the first offering
they come from an obliging field
i always prefer wild flowers
would you
our gratitude is beyond words
ive grieved for this lonely house
then i heard it was taken
i felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight
pray sit mr willoughby
who is reading
shakespeares sonnets
marianne is reading them out
and which are your favourites
mine is 116
let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments
love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover
to remove
how does it continue
no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests
is it tempests
its strange you are reading these
i carry them with me always
until tomorrow then
my pocket sonnets are yours
a talisman against further injury
goodbye thank you
good work marianne you covered
shakespeare scott poetry
when you know his views on romance
youll have nothing left to talk of
i suppose i erred against decorum
i should have talked of the weather
mr willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him
should i hide my regard
no but we know so little of him
time does not determine intimacy
seven years is too little for some
seven days is enough for others
or seven hours in this case
i feel i know him already
had i more shallow feelings i could
perhaps conceal them as you do
im sorry
dont trouble yourself marianne
i do not understand her
marianne
havent you finished yet
no patience
youre not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar
there is nothing under ten pence
do you want us to starve
no
just not to eat beef
if my behaviour was improper
i should be sensible of it
it has caused impertinent remarks
do you not doubt your discretion
if mrs jennings remarks prove
impropriety we are all offending
good morning colonel
miss dashwood miss marianne
i come to issue an invitation
a picnic on my estate
at delaford
if you would care to join us
on thursday next
mrs jennings daughter and husband
are travelling up especially
we should be delighted colonel
i will of course be including
mr willoughby in the party
i should be delighted to join you
good morning miss dashwood
good morning colonel
the colonel has invited us
to delaford
i hear you have a fine pianoforte
a broadwood grand
then i shall play for you all
we shall look forward to it
your sister seems very happy
she does not hide her emotions
her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught
she is wholly unspoilt
rather too unspoilt
the sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world the better
i knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper
who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world
the result was only
ruination and despair
do not desire it miss dashwood
col brandons lawn
is perfect for kite launching
col brandons lawn
is perfect for kite launching
mind the pretty ribbons
imagine my surprise when charlotte
and her master appeared with lucy
the last person i expected to see
she came to join in the fun
there is no such luxury at home
id not seen you for so long
you sly thing it was the dashwoods
she wanted to see
ive heard nothing but dashwood
for i dont know how long
what do you think of them my mother
wrote of little else in her letters
are they not as she described
nothing like
you are quite rude today
hes to be an mp and he is forced
to make everybody like him
i said nothing so irrational
mr palmers so droll
here he comes
now you shall see charlotte
hello mr willoughby
you must meet my daughter charlotte
and mr palmer
and our cousin miss lucy steele
welcome to our party
may i sit beside you
ive longed to meet you ive heard
nothing but praise for you
sir john and mrs jennings are
too excessive in their compliments
the praise came from another source
one not inclined to exaggeration
what can this be
is col brandon here
my horse
whats the matter
i must away to london
impossible
we cant picnic without our host
come up to town tomorrow
or wait until we return
i cant afford to lose one minute
forgive me
i hope its nothing serious
upon my soul
this is all very unusual
frailty thy name is brandon
some cannot bear pleasure
you are a wicked pair
col brandon will be missed
why everyone speaks well of him
but no one remembers to talk to him
nonsense he is highly respected
at barton park
which is enough censure in itself
really willoughby
come come mr impudence
i know your wicked ways
reveal your beau no secrets between
friends ill winkle it out of you
ill have you married to the colonel
by tea or ill swallow my bonnet
as if you could marry him
why should you dislike him
because he threatened me with rain
when i wanted it fine
he found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare
if it will be
of satisfaction to you
i believe his character to be in
all other respects irreproachable
in return for this acknowledgement
dont deny me the privilege
of disliking him
as much as i adore
this cottage
i have plans for improvements
that i will never consent to
not a stone must be added
to its walls
were i rich enough id rebuild
combe magna to this exact image
with a fire that smokes
especially the fire that smokes
then id be as happy at combe
as ive been at barton
but this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share
promise never to change it
im honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied
that is what elinor would say
and she would be right
miss marianne will you grant me
an interview tomorrow alone
willoughby we are always alone
but there is
there is something very particular
i should like to ask you
of course i shall ask mamma
if i may stay behind from church
thank you
until tomorrow then
oh virtue
silently and with fear enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day
will he kneel down when he asks her
they always kneel down
what is wrong dearest
willoughby
what is the matter
forgive me
i am sent
lady allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin
she is sending me to london
this morning
what a disappointment your business
wont detain you for long i hope
you are kind but i have no idea of
returning immediately to devonshire
i am invited only once a year
can you wait for our invitation
my engagements are of such a
nature i dare not flatter my
its folly to linger in this manner
i will not torment myself further
willoughby come back
ask betsy to make a cup of tea
for marianne
what is wrong my love
do not ask me questions
they must have quarrelled
that is unlikely
perhaps lady allen disapproves
of his regard for marianne
an excuse to send him away
then why did he not say so
its not like him to be secretive
what do you suspect
why was his manner so guilty
you think hes been acting a part
no he loves her i am sure
of course
has he left her any assurance
of his return
ask if he proposed
no i cannot force a confidence
from marianne neither should you
we must trust her to confide in us
in her own time
there was something underhand
in his manner
you will think the worst of him
i give him the benefit of my
good opinion he deserves no less
i am very fond of willoughby
mamma mamma
she would not let me in
if only this rain would stop
if only you would stop
twas you took her off my hands
mr palmer a good bargain too
now i have the whip hand over you
for you cannot give her back
marianne play with us looking at
the weather will not bring him back
she ate nothing at dinner
were all forlorn these days
dear miss dashwood perhaps now
we might have our discussion
our discussion
ive longed to ask you something
you might think me impertinent
it is an odd question
if only hed gone to combe magna
we live but half a mile away
five and a half
i cannot believe it is that far
i cant believe it
try
you may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help
are you acquainted with your
sisterinlaws mother mrs ferrars
fannys mother
no i have never met her
you must think me strange to ask
if only i dared tell
if she tells you of the famous
mr f you must pass it on
will you take a turn with me
miss dashwood
i had no idea you were at all
connected with that family
i am nothing to mrs ferrars
at present
but the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected
what do you mean
do you have an understanding
with fannys brother robert
the youngest no
i have never met him in my life
with edward
edward ferrars
edward and i have been
secretly engaged these five years
you may well be surprised
i only mention it because i entirely
trust you to keep our secret
edward looks on you
quite as his own sister
i am sorry
surely we
we surely do not mean
the same mr ferrars
yes he was under the tutelage
of my uncle mr pratt in plymouth
has he never spoken of it
yes yes i believe he has
i wanted his mothers approval
but we loved each other so much
you must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him
i cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us
we can scarcely meet
above twice a year
you seem out of sorts
are you quite well
i have not offended you
i must know what you are saying
promise me youll not tell a soul
miss dashwood is quite engrossed
i give you my word
what has so fascinated you
tell us all
we were talking of london
do you hear that charlotte
charlotte and i concocted a plan
the best plan in the world
i make for london shortly
and i invite you lucy
and both the misses dashwood
to join me
can i go
you will all come to my chelsea home
and taste of the seasons delights
please can i go
do you not long for it to be so
i came here with no other view
we cant leave our mother
she can spare you very well
of course she can
i could not be more delighted
i will brook no refusal
let us strike hands on the bargain
if i dont have you married by
michaelmas it will not be my fault
ive never been so grateful
i shall see willoughby
and you will see edward
are you asleep
with you in the room
you cant feel as calm as you look
oh i will never sleep tonight
what were you and miss steele
talking about so long
nothing of significance
how do you think i like poking about
in that big house without charlotte
i wrote to edward yet i do not know
how much i may see of him
secrecy is vital
hell never be able to call
my only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection
you re fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score
i am of a jealous nature had he
talked more of one young woman
but hes not given a moments alarm
on that count
imagine how glad hell be
to learn that we are friends
have you missed me pigeon
very much maam
is everything in order
i suggest the ordering of coal
there you are pooter
still alive i see tea pigeon
you do not waste any time
give it to pigeon
mrs jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town
john and fanny are in town
we should be forced to see them
i think it was for next door
sit down for two seconds
youre making me nervous
oh elinor it is willoughby
indeed it is
excuse me colonel
colonel
what a pleasure to see you have you
been in london all this while
what a pleasure to see you have you
been in london all this while
i have heard
reports through town
tell me once and for all
is everything resolved between
your sister and mr willoughby
though neither one has informed me
of their understanding
i have no doubt
of their mutual affection

my brother
mr edward ferrars
ferrars with an f
are there any messages
no message at all no cards
you do not ask for your messages
no for i do not expect any

very little acquaintance in town
not another word about the ham bone
you and cartwright sort it out
no messages
do not fret my dear
this good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country
but the frost will soon
drive them to town depend on it
i had not thought of that
and miss dashwood
may set her heart at rest
for your sisterinlaw is inviting
mr f to the ball tonight
do be careful
the horses have been here
it is beginning to rain also
follow me
mamma
this is very merry
do you spy anyone we know
no mr palmer has a better view
do you see anyone we know
unfortunately not
how can you be such a tease
there is mrs john dashwood
come along my dears
there you are
how hot it is
you are not alone i trust
john is just gone
to fetch my brother
your brother i declare
this is good news indeed
i shall faint clean away
mrs jennings i am pleased
to meet you my brotherinlaw
mr robert ferrars
miss dashwood
miss steele miss marianne
my dear ladies we meet at last
you must be the younger brother
is mr edward not here
miss dashwood was counting on him
he is far too busy
theres no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile
what are the men about these days
are they in hiding
in the absence of your brother
you must dance with miss dashwood
it would be my honour
perhaps miss steele might consider
reserving the allemande
you reside in devonshire
miss dashwood
in a cottage
yes
i am excessively fond of a cottage
if i had any money to spare
i should build one myself
mr willoughby
how do you do miss dashwood
very well
how is your family
we are all extremely well
thank you for your kind inquiry
willoughby
good god willoughby
will you not shake hands with me
how do you do miss marianne
what is the matter
why have you not come to see me
were you not in london
have you not received my letters
i had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me
for heavens sake willoughby
tell me what is wrong
thank you i am most obliged
excuse me i must rejoin my party
go to him
force him to come to me instantly
you must come away
do you know them
acquaintances from the country
come away dearest
i do not understand
i must speak to him
my goodness come dear
you need some air
lucy
we must go
it would be our pleasure
to escort your young charge home
how kind
she actually sent him messages
during the night
marianne please tell me
do not ask me questions
you have no confidence in me
you confide in no one
i have nothing to tell
we neither of us do
i because i conceal nothing you
because you communicate nothing
lady charteris ought to limit her
invitation list it was very warm
i am glad we left early
there now
lovers quarrels are swift to heal
that letter will do the trick
i must be off i do hope he doesnt
keep her waiting much longer
it hurts to see her this way
what a welcome i had
from edwards family
you never said how agreeable
your sisterinlaw is robert also
it is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement
dear madam i am at a loss to see
how i might have offended you
if i have given rise to a belief of
more than i meant to express
i regret
not having been more guarded
my affections
are engaged elsewhere
it is with regret that i return
your letters and the lock of hair
i am et cetera john willoughby
dearest
it is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it
we re not engaged
i thought he left you
with some kind of understanding
hes not so unworthy as you think
did he tell you that he loved you
yes no never absolutely
it was implied but never declared
sometimes i thought it had been
but it never was he broke no vow
he made us all believe he loved you
he did he loved me as i loved him
i had to come straight up
how are you miss marianne
poor thing she looks very bad
no wonder for it is but too true
i was told by miss morton
that he is soon to marry
a miss grey with 50000
if true he is a goodfornothing
who used my young friend ill
and i wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out
hes not the only young man
worth having
with your pretty face
youll never want for admirers
better let her have her cry out
and have done with it
i will go look out something
to tempt her
does she care for olives
i cannot tell you
apparently they never were engaged
miss grey has 50000
marianne is virtually penniless
she couldnt expect him to go
through with it but i feel for her
she will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like elinor
we might have them to stay for a
few days we are after all family
and my father
my love
i would ask them with all my heart
but ive already asked miss steele
and we cannot deprive mrs jennings
of all her company
we can invite your sisters
some other year
miss steele will profit more
from your generosity poor girl
excellent notion
colonel brandon to see you
thank you so much for coming
how is your sister
i must get her home palmer can take
us to cleveland a day from barton
ill take you to barton myself
i confess that is what i hoped
marianne suffers cruelly
what pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify mr willoughby
perhaps
may i relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful
you have something to tell me
of mr willoughby
when i quitted barton last
no i must go further back
no doubt
no doubt
mrs jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past
the sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named eliza
what is not commonly known
is that 20 years ago
before she died eliza bore a child
the father whoever he was
abandoned them
as eliza lay dying she begged me
to look after the child
i had failed her in ever other way
i could not refuse her now
i placed the child beth
with a family in the country
where i knew she would be looked
after i saw her whenever i could
she grew up so headstrong
and god forgive me
i allowed her too much freedom
almost a year ago she disappeared
i instigated a search but for
eight months i imagined the worst
on the day of the delaford picnic
i received the first news of her
she was with child
and the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts
do you mean willoughby
before i could confront him
lady allen had turned him out
he fled to london
he left without any explanation
he risked losing the estate and the
money that remained to his debtors
so he abandoned marianne
for miss grey
and her 50000
is beth still in town
she has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement
i would not burden you
had i not from my heart
believed it might in time
lessen your sisters regrets
i have described mr willoughby
as the worst of libertines
but i learned from lady allen that
he did mean to propose that day
i cannot deny that his intentions
towards marianne were honourable
i feel certain
that he would have married her
had it not been
for the money
was i right to tell you
of course
whatever his past actions
whatever his present course
you may be certain
that he loved you
but not enough
not enough
here is someone to cheer you up
how is your dear sister
poor thing
i do not know what id do if a man
treated me with so little respect
are you enjoying your stay
with john and fanny
i was never so happy in my life
your sisterinlaw has taken to me
you cannot imagine what happened
no i cannot
yesterday i was introduced to his
mother she was more than civil
i have not yet seen edward
but i feel sure to very soon
there is a mr edward ferrars
to see you
do ask him to come in
what a pleasure to see you
you know miss steele of course
how do you do miss steele
i am well thank you
do sit down
are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sisters house
let me fetch marianne she would be
disappointed to miss you
edward i heard your voice
at last you found us
my visit is shamefully overdue
youre pale are you not well
dont think of me elinor is well
that is enough for both of us
how do you enjoy london
the sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded is that not so
why have you not visited before
i have been engaged elsewhere
but what was that when there were
such friends to be met
perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements
edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone i ever saw
edward will you not sit
help me to persuade him
forgive me i must take my leave
you are only just arrived
ive an urgent commission for fanny
perhaps you might escort me
back to your sisters house
it would be an honour
why did you not urge him to stay
he must have had his reasons
yes your coldness were i edward
id assume you didnt care for me
marianne looked badly it makes me
fear that i shall never marry
nonsense you will marry far better
than the dashwood girls
but i have no dowry
there are other important qualities
that you have in abundance
it would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations
oh i wish that might be so
there is a young man
is he of good fortune and breeding
of both but his family
would certainly oppose the match
they will allow it
as soon as they see you
it is a very great secret
ive told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery
i am the soul of discretion
if i dared tell
i can assure you
i am as silent as the grave
viper in my bosom
stop this
what a commotion edward ferrars
the one i used to joke you about
is engaged these five years
to lucy steele
his mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance
but he refuses to break his promise
he has stood by her
and is cut off without a penny
she settled it all on mr robert
i must find lucy your sisterinlaw
drove her to hysteria
how long have you known
since mrs jennings invited us
why did you not tell me
lucy told me in confidence
i could not break my word
he loves you
he tried to tell me about lucy
he cannot marry her
should he treat her worse
than willoughby treated you
he cant marry without love
he promised a long time ago
he may harbour some regret but he
he will be happy he kept his word
it is bewitching to think ones
happiness depends on one person
but it is not always possible
we must accept
edward will marry lucy
and you and i will go home
always resignation and acceptance
always prudence and honour and duty
elinor where is your heart
what do you know of my heart
or anything but your own suffering
for weeks this has been pressed
on me when i could not speak of it
forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes
i endured her exaltation knowing
i was divided from edward forever
if not bound to silence id have
produced proof of a broken heart
i have heard your mr ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother
have i been rightly informed
it is indeed so
are you acquainted with him
no we have never met
but i know only too well
the cruelty
of dividing two young people
long attached to one another
i have a proposal that may allow him
to marry miss steele immediately
as he is a friend to your family
perhaps youd mention it to him
im sure hed be delighted
to hear it from your own lips
i think not
his behaviour has proved him proud
in the best sense
i feel certain
this is the right course
mr edward ferrars
thank you for responding so quickly
i was grateful
to receive your message
god knows what you must think of me
i have no right to speak
i have good news
do please sit down
you know of col brandon
ive heard his name
col brandon desires me to say
as you wish to join the clergy
that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at delaford
in the hope it may enable
you and miss steele to marry
col brandon
yes
he means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation
col brandon give me a parish
can it be possible
you shouldnt be astonished to find
friendship outside your family
no
not to find it in you
i cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that i owe this
id express it if i could
but i am no orator
you are mistaken
you owe it to your own merit
col brandon must be a man
of great worth
he is the kindest and best of men
may i ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself
i think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend
your friendship has been
the most important in my life
you will always have it
forgive me
you honour your promises that is
more important than anything else
i wish you both happiness
what luck for them
to find a parish so close to barton
youll all be able to meet
very often
ive never disliked a person so much
as i do mr willoughby
we can see his house from the hill
ill ask jackson to plant trees
you wont
i hear miss greys bridal gown
was everything of the finest
mrs bunting
were in desperate need of tea
shes not drawn breath since london
had i only found another way home
there was no other way ill just
take a stroll a moments peace
i think it is going to rain
no it will not rain
when you say so it always does
i shall keep to the garden
we are very proud of our thomas
his papa has such a way with him
oh there you are
come and meet little thomas
i cannot see marianne
love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover
to remove
oh no tis an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests
and is never shaken
willoughby
willoughby
willoughby
marianne
shell be wet through
thank you for pointing that out
do not worry miss dashwood
brandon will find her
we can all guess where she went
shes not hurt
but we must get her warm
there is a fire lit in my room
do hurry
i think marianne may need
a doctor
youll wear yourself out a day or
two in bed will set her to rights
you can rely upon harris colonel
ive never found a better physician
what is the diagnosis
it is an infectious fever
i recommend removing your child
mrs bunting
miss dashwood
i am more sorry than i can say
if you prefer me to stay i shall
that is very kind
but col brandon and dr harris
will look after us
thank you for all you have done
shes not doing as well
as i would like
what can i do
youve done so much already
anything or i shall run mad
she would be easier
if her mother were here
i must fetch more laudanum
i cannot pretend that your sisters
condition is not very serious
you must prepare yourself
i will return shortly
marianne
marianne please try
marianne
please try
i cannot
i cannot do without you
ive tried to bear everything else
i will try
but please dearest
beloved marianne
do not leave me alone
elinor
my mother
she is out of danger
she is out of danger
where is elinor
im here
dearest i am here
col brandon
thank you
hes not so dashing as willoughby
but he has a pleasing countenance
there was something in willoughbys
eyes at times that i did not like
nor is the earth the lesse
or loseth aught
what from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought
for there is nothing lost
but may be found
if sought
shall we continue tomorrow
no for i must away
away where
that i cannot tell you
it is a secret
you will not stay away long
there
there i fell
and there i first saw willoughby
poor willoughby
he will always regret you
does it follow that had he chosen
me he would have been content
he would have had a wife he loved
but no money
and might have learned to rank
his pocketbook above his heart
if his regrets are half as painful
as mine he will suffer enough
do you compare
your conduct with his
i compare it to what it
ought to have been with yours
i fetched those beef fillets maam
beef is less expensive in exeter
anyway its for marianne
was exeter crowded
it was maam
miss pothington
has had another stroke
and miss murden has turned away
coles for his drunkenness
and mr ferrars is married
but of course you know that
who told you he was married
i saw mrs ferrars myself she and
mr ferrars stopped at the inn
i saw it was miss steele
so i took off my hat
she inquired after all of you
especially miss dashwood
she bade me give their compliments
theyre sending a piece of the cake
did mrs ferrars seem well
she said she was vastly contented
as she was always an affable lady
i made free to wish her joy
thank you thomas
what is it thomas
im not sure but its heavy
it is small enough for the parlour
when i follow shortly i expect
that youve learnt the enclosed
your friend christopher brandon
it fits perfectly
here you are miss marianne
fetch some tea
he must like you very much
its for all of us
here is col brandon
i do not think it is the colonel
he said he would arrive today
edward
it is edward
calm
we must be calm
mr ferrars for you maam
edward
what a pleasure to see you
i trust i find you all well
thank you we are all very well
weve been enjoying fine weather
well we have
im glad to hear it
the roads were very dry
i wish you great joy edward
i hope
you have left mrs ferrars well
tolerably thank you
is mrs ferrars at the new parish
no my mother is in town
i meant mrs edward ferrars
youve not heard
i think you mean my brother
mrs robert ferrars
mrs robert ferrars
yes
i received a letter
from miss steele
or mrs ferrars i should say
communicating to me
the transfer of her affections
to my brother robert
it seems they were much
thrown together in london
in view of my new circumstances
i felt it only right
that she be released
from our engagement
at any rate they were married
last week in plymouth
then you
are not married
no
elinor
i met lucy when i was very young
had i had a profession i would not
have felt such an idle inclination
at norland i convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me
and that it was my heart alone
that i was risking
i have come with no expectations
only to express now i am able
that my heart is
and always will be
