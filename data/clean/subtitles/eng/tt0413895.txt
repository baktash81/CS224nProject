ordinary place 
no astonishing thing
ever happened there 
the people who lived there
were just regular people 
and the animals   
well  they were
just plain old animals 
they didn t question
the order of things 
so  the days passed 
one very much like the other 
but  one spring 
on a small farm 
a little girl did something 
something that would
change everything 
what are you doing 
fern  go back to bed 
you re not going to
kill it  are you 
it s a runt 
now  go back to bed 
no  it s not fair 
it can t help
being born small 
careful 
if i d been born small 
would you have killed me 
of course not 
a little girl is one thing 
a runty pig is another 
there s no difference 
this is unfair and unjust 
how could you
be so heartless 
come here 
i want to show you something 
you see that  you see 
there s 11 pigs
and only 10 teats 
sow can t feed it  honey 
then i will 
i ll feed you
and take care of you and   
   absolutely will not
let you kill him 
hey  when did fern get a pig 
avery  it s rude to point 
give me that 
come  sit 
eat your breakfast 
the bus will be
here any minute 
good morning 
hey  pop 
can i have a pig  too 
no  i only give pigs
to early risers 
fern was up before dawn 
ridding the world
of injustice 
fern  put that pig down
and get to school 
avery 
  see ya 
  bye  pop 
have a good one  buddy 
says here we re gonna get
a lot of rain this month 
fern  your books 
bye 
class  these are
some of the questions
that you re likely to be
asked in the exam this week 
so  please take
particular note of every one 
shh 
you got to be quiet  okay 
you re gonna
get me in trouble 
drink that 
so  it s just a matter of
following these questions
and learning the answers 
fern  what s going on 
nothing 
fern  what s in your desk 
  nothing 
  open it 
thank you  mrs  arable 
fern  you know better 
it s a pig  okay 
it s not a toy 
not a doll  not a baby 
a pig 
and you need to start
treating it like one 
this is going too far 
i know she loves animals 
but you have to tell her 
i know 
she s just so happy with it 
i know 
doesn t that feel good 
fern  i m really sorry  honey 
but it s been long enough 
what 
look  he s not
a baby anymore 
i can t have you keeping
what will soon be
a 300 pound pet
around the house 
no 
can t he stay in the barn 
please  dad 
  no 
  please 
no  fern  look 
you know i ve been selling the animals
to get the new
harvesting equipment 
pretty soon there s gonna be no
place in the barn for a pig 
i promised i d
take care of him 
well  i m letting you
out of your promise 
i didn t promise you 
i promised wilbur 
what about homer 
he has animals 
uncle homer 
i m sure he could
make room for a pig 
yeah 
he d be right
across the road 
  go to sleep  my little one
  the sun has said
goodbye for now
  the moon shines on
your beautiful face  
my mom used to sing that
to me to make me feel safe 
good night 
wilbur 
fern had
walked across the road
to her uncle s barn
hundreds of times before 
but it had never
felt so far away 
it was just a big red barn
full of typical stuff 
come to think of it 
it couldn t have been more ordinary 
but sometimes  when you
take two ordinary things
and put them together
at just the right time 
there s a chance they ll become
two less ordinary things 
that runty pig  for instance 
and that big old smelly barn 
one sniff  and you knew it was
a place full of living things 
but that didn t necessarily
mean it was full of life 
it s okay  it s okay 
nope  for that 
this barn needed a pig 
this isn t so bad 
only no one knew it yet 
don t be afraid 
you ll be okay 
i ll come see you every day 
i ll be around so much
you ll be sick of me 
i love you 
avery  the bus is here 
did you remember
your sister s lunch 
got it 
what the hay

probably obably
something smart 
pigs are smart 
pigs are not smart 
apparently  they re as
intelligent as dolphins 
advantage dolphin 
he s going to
knock himself out 
yeah 
that s using your head 
how many times
is he going to try that 
pig s out 
i told you pigs are smart 
that s going to
leave a mark

out of his mind 
homer

they eat their menfolk  you know 
i know

i ve never met
a spider before 
did you make that 
is that what you were
concentrating on last night 
yes 
it s amazing 
think you could teach me
how to make one of those 
oh  hold that thought  please 
what are you doing 
making breakfast 
  oh  boy 
  relax 
first 
i give him a little nip to anesthetize him 
so he ll be more comfortable 
it s a little service
i throw in 
then i wrap him up 
then i just say grace because 
well  that s always nice 
and he ll make
a perfectly delicious meal 
so  you eat flies 
no  no  no 
i drink their blood 
lying down on the job  eh 
fainted like a girl 
that s disgusting 
well  that s easy
for you to say 
you have all your meals
brought to you in a pail 
i don t get that kind
of royal treatment 
i am a trapper 
i have to catch my food 
which is why i make
my home near you 
please don t hurt me 
well 
since you said  please  
and just imagine how many bugs
there would be in this barn 
no  actually  in the world 
if spiders didn t catch them 
insects would
take over the planet 
the way i see it 
i m doing everyone a favor 
except for the fly 
yes  except for the fly 
i think now is the time
for me to say salutations 
what 
salutations 
oh  okay  i ll leave 
no  wilbur 
 salutations 
is just a fancy way of saying hello 
oh  hello 
hey  you know my name 
what s yours 
my name 
my name is charlotte 
charlotte a  cavatica 
charlotte  great name 
thank you 
i ve always thought so 
hey  since you ve said  
you know  that word 
does that mean we re friends 
hmm  i suppose it does 
yeah 
golly 
go see what s going oing on over there 
what s going oing   
hey  kid 
what s going on over here 
oh  sorry 
i just made a new friend 
that s all 
the spider 
oh  yeah  good choice 
yeah  perfect 
you picked someone
even more despised than me 
why would anyone
despise charlotte 
she made that amazing web 
and she keeps
bugs out of the barn 
look at her 
i mean  don t you
think she s a little   
oh  what s the word 
ew 
i think she s beautiful 
i beg your pardon 
she is hideous 
are we even seeing
the same ruddy creature 
i guess not 
hopeless 
what a sorry little friendship
that s going to be 
there s an old expression that
says that ignorance is bliss 
and i m inclined to
believe it s true 
because 
on that late spring day 
wilbur was as happy
as a pig could be 
and those spring days
rolled into summer days 
days filled with
endless conversation
between the two
unlikeliest of friends 
charlotte 
what s a spring pig 
a pig who was
born in the spring 
oh  and i thought
it meant bouncy 
that would be a springy pig 
 after mrs  mallard had
laid eight eggs in the nest 
 she couldn t go to
visit michael anymore 
 because she had to sit on
the eggs to keep them warm 
 she moved off the nest only to get a
drink of water  or to have her lunch 
 or to count the eggs and make
sure they were all there 
 one day 
the ducklings hatched out 
 first came jack 
then kack    
yeah  yeah 
this is going to be great 
wilbur 
what on earth are you doing 
you ll see 
oh  that feels marvelous 
yes  over to the left a bit 
ah  yes 
is that a breeze i feel 
i m 10 pounds lighter 
  i m next 
  i m next 
  i m next 
  i m next  too 
looking pretty good  huh 
sure is 
hi  there 
are you new to the barn 
i m wilbur 
wilbur  it s me 
me  great name 
no  me  me 
samuel  the sheep 
wow  what happened to you 
the world s first pig web 
ta da 
i think you d better leave
the web spinning to me 
after weeks and weeks 
and i m talking about some long
weeks of waiting and expecting 
all the hard work
has finally paid off 
wow  look at them 
they were eggs  and now they re   
they re just   
look at them 
wow  gussy  you did
a really terrific job 
they don t call me
mother goose for nothing 
congratulations 
oh 
would you look at that 
yes  thank you  thank you 
it wasn t easy 
but i managed 
you managed 
i m kidding  honey 
we managed 
six  seven 
weren t there eight eggs 
could this be a dud 
g g golly  golly  golly 
whoa 
w w whoa  there  father goose 
i   i   i m just trying to
help the happy couple 
what do you want
with a rotten egg  anyway 
i want a rotten egg
for the simple reason that   
you never know 
this one didn t make it 
i think we have to
let it go 
mmm hmm 
oh  take it 
and add it to that nasty asty
collection of yours 
last one out is
a rotten egg 
well  i thought it was funny 
  i should have pecked him 
  don t you break that egg  rat 
a broken rotten egg would make
this barn stink to high heaven 
that would be a change 
why are you laughing  bits 
he just said we stink 
oh  yeah  this is good 
this will come in handy 
you really are
a handsome devil 
oh  boy 
egg xactly 
saw a big old spider
in the doorway 
gonna go catch it 
no  avery  come back here 
  here  spidey spidey 
  you can t do that 
stop 
gotcha 
no  no  avery 
wilbur  no 
come on  wilbur  get off 
wilbur  wilbur 
why did you do that 
avery  no 
ew  that stinks 
oh  that is gross 
whew  man  is that you 
no  i smell a smell  though 
think it s scary guy 
  he s trying to stink us away from the   
  corn 
guess the yolk s on me 
that is one ripe egg 
that stinks good 
  ew 
  that is disgusting 
we told you not
to break that egg 
now look what
you ve done  rat 
it saved charlotte 
didn t it 
yeah  ingrates 
i saved
the leggy lady s life 
you mean that as
a good thing  right 
of course 
i do have
a few eyes  you know 
and i think wilbur did
most of the saving 
i know  ironic  isn t it 
he s saving you 
and they re saving him for christmas 
templeton 
what s christmas 
the day you ll be cured 
but i m not sick 
oh  i didn t say
you were sick 
uh oh  that was a mistake 
yep  typical rat 
what  you re going to lie
to the future football here 
but it s a sad statement when i m
the most honest guy in the place 
templeton 
what are you talking about 
come winter 
the farmer will be checking you
into the old
smokehouse hotel 
and the only checking out
that happens is
when people gather
around and say 
 mmm  check out
that yummy sausage 
 check out that
sizzling bacon  
so  that s what that is for 
ain t for roasting chestnuts 
he   he   he wouldn t 
humans love pigs 
well  they love pork 
well  this is awkward 
isn t it 
charlotte 
charlotte  is it true 
wilbur  few spring pigs get
to see the snows of winter 
no  i   i can t believe this 
i won t believe it 
oh  wilbur 
it isn t fair 
i want to live 
i want to see the snow 
and you will 
i m making you
a promise right now 
i am not going to
let them kill you 
you re a spider 
you re little 
they re huge 
how are you
going to stop them 
i have no idea 
but it s a promise 
and promises are something
i never break 
just don t you
worry about it  wilbur 
besides  it s a long time
until christmas 
okay  charlotte 
if you say so 
  dad 
  yeah 
can i walk home 
i promised wilbur i d be there right away 
  sure  that s fine with me 
  thanks 
fern  wait 
why don t you 
um  go to the whites 
or the sergeants 
today and play 
or you could
have someone over 
why 
because you re spending
too much time in that barn 
it isn t good for you
to be alone so much 
alone  all my best
friends are there 
  except the rat 
  the rat 
i wouldn t call him my friend 
but the rest of them are 
they tell the greatest stories 
they make me laugh 
and i promised them i d read  em this book 
so i got to go  bye 
dr  dorian 
it s ridiculous  isn t it 
to think that animals
can actually talk 
i don t know 
maybe an animal said
something to me
and i didn t hear it
because i wasn t
paying attention 
maybe children are just
better listeners than we are 
well 
it worries me to no end 
what s got you worried
is that her only friends
are pigs  sheep 
geese and rats 
well  not rats 
no 
  does she look well 
  yes 
  appetite s good 
  mmm hmm 
  does she sleep well at night 
  yes 
i mean  she s right
as rain in that way 
well  there is
a name for her condition 
it s called
a childhood phase 
and  sadly 
it s something she ll grow out of 
charlotte 
what are you doing 
thinking 
i do my best thinking
upside down 
blood goes to my head
and perks me up 
i ve been thinking  too 
you know  about christmas 
don t worry  wilbur 
we ll figure something out 
come on  ike  come on 
um  not to be
too much trouble 
but have you
figured something out 
not yet 
but it s like a web 
you make it  you wait 
and something always comes 
good night  charlotte 
good night  wilbur 
and swing 
and stick 
and loop 
and back up  stick  and   
hmm 
mr  zuckerman 
uh  okay 
y y you gotta come see this 
come on  homer 
come on 
what s a  so me pig  
it s  some pig  
it s a miracle 
it s nothing short of
a bona fide miracle 
minister beecher 
homer  edith 
what brings you here 
divinity 
we think so 
we d better keep this quiet
until i address it
in my sermon 
you can t tell a soul 
but you gotta come up to the barn 
  keep it between me and you 
  swing by the farm 
okay  goodbye 
now  don t tell nobody 
shouldn t get around 
there s a word in a spider
web at zuckerman s barn 
uh  charlotte 
what does a  some pig  do 
this isn t for what you do 
it s for what you are 
some pigs might smile a bit 
oh  the lifting of the head 
nice touch 
as ugly as that spider is 
we should have known
she was smart 
so  you don t believe that someone
might be smart and pretty 
no  yes  i mean  yes 
because you are 
clever little spider 
isn t she 
where s the spider
who did this 
well  we   we looked all over
and couldn t find one 
looks pretty good 
still ain t gonna change anything 
he s a goner 
yeah  glad nobody eats cows 
got to admit 
that s a fine looking pig 
yep  that s some pig 
all right 
after a few weeks 
the phenomenon of
the web wore off 
nobody cared anymore 
and what was
amazing yesterday
was suddenly
ordinary again today 
it looked like wilbur might
not see snow after all 
excuse me 
but why are we here 
i mean  yes  yes 
barn meeting and so on and so forth 
i understand that 
but must this concern us 
and at such an ungodly hour 
you know 
wilbur s not the only one
who could end up being
christmas dinner
with an apple
in his mouth 
ah  good point 
yes  carry on  then 
ike  this involves
every one of us 
i just have trouble
looking at you 
that s all 
this isn t about me 
it s about wilbur 
and  for the record  my view of you
is not exactly a treat  either 
as we have all seen 
humans have very
short attention spans 
and there s just too much time
between now and christmas 
certainly enough time for zuckerman
to find his affection for a pig
losing out to
his hunger for ham 
  that spider can talk 
  yeah 
what did she say  exactly 
she said the farmer might
possibly still slaughter the pig 
sorry  old chap 
but it is a common fate for your ilk 
i could just bust
through the fence again 
no 
once was enough for that 
i just have to get
the right word written 
something that makes
wilbur so special
that zuckerman will never
think about killing him again 
you need something snappy 
like  pig supreme  
that sounds like a dessert 
so  what s the point  anyway 
it won t work 
could you please 
just once  say
something omething positive 
okay 
i m positive it won t work 
how about
 harmoniously proportioned  
harmoniously
proportioned  yes 
stop that  stop that 
you re following again 
please  all of you 
what s the perfect word
for wilbur 
how about  delicious  
or  nutritious  
or  extra crispy  
how about   
did you get him 
yep  bull s eye 
how about  terrific 
terrific  terrific  
good  much too long  though 
i ve only got so much web 
but one  terrific  might work 
it simply isn t true 
the pig is not terrific 
look at him 
he s absolutely average 
if you wish to be truthful  then that is
the word you should write   average  
hmm  wilbur  this only works
if the word i write is true 
and only you can tell us
which word that is 
so look around 
we ve all gathered
around to help you 
now tell everyone
how you feel 
look  there s a red one 
and a blue one 
avery 
you ll never catch me 
i m going to get you 
look at the fireworks  mom 
avery 
come on if you ever want to catch me 
this web thing is
really paying off 
mr  zuckerman 
there it is  side to side 
right in the same place 
 terrific  
it was the most
amazing thing 
last time we had
hundreds of people 
this time it s going
to be thousands 
it says  terrific 
just as clear as day 
t e double r i f i c 
i mean  can you imagine a spider
being able to spell that word 
i don t think i could spell
that word till the 10th grade 
50 cents 
oh  do you like that one  sir 
that s going to be  1 
  wow 
  gather  round  folks 
remember  you saw it
right here at zuckerman s 
and  before you leave  don t forget to
take some of our berries home with you 
  so  you think this might work 
  nope 
dare i say it 
he looks  terrific  
look at them all 
yeah  smile pretty 
i wish geese had teeth 
been down here since dawn   
what are you suggesting 
that fern has something
to do with all this 
how else could those words
have gotten into that web 
i know everyone is saying it s
some kind of miracle  but   
but what 
you don t think it is 
do you 
the web itself is a miracle 
wouldn t you agree 
well  can you spin one 
i can crochet a doily 
because someone
taught you how 
nobody teaches a spider 
they just know
how to spin a web 
don t you think
that s a miracle 
as summer ended 
so did the excitement about the web 
charlotte needed to
think of something special 
special enough to change the
way people saw the world 
or at least one pig
in the world  anyway 
the truth is 
charlotte feared she would
never find a word
that could do all that 
and she had to hurry 
time was running out for her 
but once a promise is made 
it needs to be kept 
still no web  huh 
nope 
i haven t seen one in 
i d say  at least a month 
funny how you get used to all those
people being around the place 
kind of quiet
without them  isn t it 
i noticed the hinge pin s busted
on the damper in the smokehouse 
want me to order a new one 
suppose you better 
that s a special order 
better get a jump on
that if we re going
to smoke any ham
before the holidays 
we may need another
cord of wood  too 
i m just going to throw this out
here one more time   pig supreme  
oh  golly  now you re
just beating a dead horse 
  hey 
  sorry 
look  i don t come across
many words in the field 
other than  hyah  
or  giddyup  
but that rat s always dragging
in trash with writing on it 
i agree 
it s about time
templeton started
pulling his weight
around here
instead of just eating it 
i bet he could bring us
some choice words 
i ve got
a choice word for you 
a little word called 
 uh uh  
well  that s two words 
and here s a few more 
negative  no way 
nothing doing 
i ain t breaking my back
to try and save  some pig  
no matter how  terrific 
you think the little lunch meat is 
you ll sing a different
tune when he s gone
and nobody brings around those
scrumptious buckets of slop 
and three  two   
cue the rat 
let s get one thing straight 
i don t care about the pig 
  what i care about is the slop 
  of course 
and since i ll be
at the dump anyway 
and it won t take
any extra effort 
maybe  maybe
i ll pick something up 
you re very kind 
don t go spreading it around 
what  what do you want 
you ll need your strength 
oh 
thanks 
but  dad  i heard them 
i heard them talking
about the smokehouse 
he s not your pig anymore 
well  i wouldn t have
sold him in the first place
if i knew this is what
they were gonna do to him 
that s what happens
to a pig on a farm  fern 
you know that 
i ll see about that 
i ve got maybe two 
three years before she can out argue me 
then i m doomed 
and members of
our own 4 h club will have
the opportunity to enter livestock
and poultry in the competition 
so  in addition to
the rides and games 
make sure you show them
your support  as well 
any questions  rita 
miss lewis 
can i bring my chickens 
your chickens  i m sure 
pigs  chickens 
horses and cows 
you certainly can 
and i hope you win first prize 
all right  back it up 
how can he be
in every cornfield 
it can t be the same guy 
it can t be 
he s wearing the same hat 
i m telling you 
he is following us 
i hate that guy 
i have got to get
some corn  elwyn 
all right  all right

don t look at him 
don t even give him
the satisfaction 
just think about
something else 
  think about something else 
  anything 
i think i see a rat 
  that s good 
  no  really  i see a rat 
oh  the rat is stealthy 
the rat is nimble

you want to go
mess with him 
oh  yeah 
i ve got to peck something 
rat on three 
one  two  three 
the rat has been spotted 
the rat is not
enjoying this 
all this for slop 
the rat is desperate 
the rat is trapped 
the rat needs to stop
calling himself  the rat  
 find some words  
yeah  right  the rat will never find words 
hey  look  words 
  hey  is he still in the can 
  he s in the can 
maybe we should give him some privacy 
always helps me out 
no  no  genius

where did he go 
i can t see him 
uh  all i see is
that fruit moving 
  what fruit 
  the fruit with the tail 
they ll never get me now

fattest pigs i ve ever seen

proportioned

the governors of the fair
are honored to present
this handsome medal 
a token of our amazement
and our appreciation 
i love you  wilbur 
well  what can
i say about this pig
that hasn t
already been said 
i know a lot of you folks
have come out to the farm 
and you ve seen the words 
a lot of you have asked me 
 how could this
have happened  
i don t know 
but it has happened
in a time when we really
don t see many
miraculous things 
or maybe we do 
maybe they re all right there around us 
every day 
and we just don t know
where to look 
there s no denying
that our own little wilbur 
he s part of something
that s bigger than all of us 
and life on that farm
is just a whole lot
better with him in it 
he really is some pig 
way to go  wilbur 
charlotte 
look how happy she is 
isn t that great 
yes  it s wonderful 
hey  what s that 
this is my magnum opus

magnum opus 
it means  great work  
it s a nutrient filled  waterproof egg sac 
really 
there s eggs in there 
my babies  514 of them 
wow  with 514 baby spiders
all over the place 
it s going to be
really radiant in the barn 
wilbur  i m afraid they re not
going to make it back to the barn 
what 
what are you talking about 
you re not going to leave them here alone 
are you 
i have no choice 
i m languishing 
what does that mean

we die 
it s just the natural
cycle of life 
no  no  just climb down

the rest of the way 
we ll go back to the barn 
and i ll take care of you 
no  wilbur 
i don t even have
the strength to climb down 
you have to 
you ve done so much for me 
and it was my great pleasure 
please come down  charlotte 
please  there must be
something i can do 
no  wilbur 
don t you know
what you ve already done 
you made me your friend 
and  in doing so 
you made a spider
beautiful to everyone
in that barn 
i didn t do anything 
charlotte 
you did it all 
no  my webs were
no miracle  wilbur 
i was only describing
what i saw 
the miracle is you 
templeton 
charlotte is very sick

  i always knew he could do it 
  never had a doubt 
welcome home  wilbur 
wilbur 
where s charlotte 
i got
a bad feeling  bits 
me  too 
now  that isn t to say
charlotte was gone forever 
she lived on in the hearts
of those that knew her 
and even those that didn t 
something had changed
in somerset county 
it was as if people knew they
lived in a special place now 
and  in small ways 
they started being special people 
a little bit kinder 
a bit more understanding 
and the animals
felt different  too 
closer 
the warmth of their
friendship carried them
through the long 
cold months 
they showed it in little
gestures of kindness 
unusual patience 
and promises kept 
even the hardest of hearts
found themselves
rising to the occasion 
and  finally 
the greatest promise of all 
a spring pig saw
his first snowfall 
it was as though charlotte herself
had shaken it out of the sky 
the stillness of
winter continued
to the first thaw 
like it always does 
and then 
the first buds of spring 
and  before you knew it 
life had come full circle 
they re here  they re here 
they re here  everybody 
hey  there  i m wilbur

hmm  tricky  how about
nellie 
nellie  i like it  well done 
joy  aranea  nellie 
you have chosen
a hallowed doorway
in which to spin your webs 
this was your
mother s doorway 
she was loyal 
brilliant  beautiful 
and she was my friend 
i will treasure
her memory forever 
so  to you  her daughters 
i pledge my friendship 
i pledge mine 
  i do  too 
  so do i 
okay  i d like to make
a couple of announcements 
first of all 
if you gals are word lovers 
and you need a few scraps
of paper for inspiration 
don t look at me 
my word fetching days
are over 
i m not the rat
i used to be 
i m at least twice that 
so  if you need something to write 
try this 
 some rat   some rat 
think about it 
slops  oh  yeah 
and  in an ordinary barn 
an ordinary pig 
a runt no less 
stood surrounded by friends 
welcoming his second spring 
and that spring was followed by many 
many more 
all because someone
stopped to see the grace
and beauty and nobility
of the humblest creature 
that is
the miracle of friendship 
it is not often that
someone comes along
who is a true friend
and a good writer 
charlotte was both 
  it s not that unusual
  when everything is beautiful
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  the sky knows
when it s time to snow
  don t need to teach
a seed to grow
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  life is like a gift they say
  wrapped up for you every day
  open up and find a way
  to give some of your own
  isn t it remarkable 
  like every time
a rain drop falls
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  birds in winter
have their fling
  but always make it
home by spring
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  when you wake up every day
  please don t throw
your dreams away
  hold them close
to your heart
  cause we re all a part
  of the ordinary miracle
  ordinary miracle
  and you ll always
see a miracle
  it seems so exceptional
  that things just
work out after all
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  sun comes up
and shines so bright
  disappears again at night
  it s just another
ordinary miracle today
  ooh  ooh  ooh
  ooh  ooh  ooh
  it s just another ordinary
  miracle today
  there s a place in the sun
  where there s hope
for everyone
  where my poor restless
heart s gotta run
  there s a place in the sun
  and before my life is done
  gotta find me
a place in the sun
  like a long lonely stream
  i keep runnin 
toward a dream
  movin  on
  movin  on
  like a branch on a tree
  i keep reachin  to be free
  movin  on
  movin  on
  there s a place in the sun
  where there s hope
for everyone
  where my poor restless
heart s gotta run
  gotta run
  there s a place in the sun
  and before my life is done
  gotta find me
a place in the sun
  like an old dusty road
  i get weary from the load
  movin  on
  movin  on
  like this tired
troubled earth
  i ve been rollin 
since my birth
  movin  on
  movin  on
  there s a place in the sun
  where there s hope
for everyone
  where my poor restless
heart s gotta run
  gotta run
  there s a place in the sun
  and before my life is done
  gotta find me
a place in the sun
  when times are bad
and you re feeling sad
  always remember that
  there s a place in the sun
  where there s hope
for everyone
  where my poor restless
heart s gotta run
  gotta run
  there s a place in the sun
  and before my life is done
