parading her at the opera like that 
sitting her next to may welland 
it s all very odd 
well  she s had such an odd life 
will they even bring her
to the beauforts  ball  do you suppose 
if they do  the talk will be of little else 
good evening  mrs welland 
good evening  may 
newland 
you know my niece countess olenska 
countess 
i hope you ve told madame olenska 
what 
that we re engaged 
i want everybody to know 
let me announce it this evening at the ball 
if you can persuade mamma 
why should we change
what is already settled 
but you can tell my cousin yourself 
she remembers you 
i remember we played together 
how this brings it all back to me 
i remember everybody here the same way 
in knickerbockers and pantalettes 
you were horrid 
you kissed me once behind a door 
but it was your cousin vandie  the one
who never looked at me  i was in love with 
yes  you have been away a very long time 
centuries and centuries 
so long  i m sure i m dead and buried 
and this dear old place is heaven 
it invariably happened 
as everything happened
in those days  in the same way 
as usuai  mrs julius beaufort appeared 
unaccompanied by her husband 
just before the jewel song 
and again  as usuai  rose at the end
of the third act and disappeared 
new york then knew that a half hour later 
the beauforts  annual opera ball
would begin 
carriages waited at the kerb
for the entire performance 
it was widely known in new york 
but never acknowledged 
that americans want
to get away from amusement 
even more quickly than they want to get to it 
the beauforts  house
was one of the few in new york
that possessed a ballroom 
such a room 
shuttered in darkness 364 days of the year 
was felt to compensate
for whatever was regrettable
in the beaufort past 
regina beaufort came
from an old south carolina family 
but her husband julius 
who passed for an englishman 
was known to have dissipated habits 
a bitter tongue and mysterious antecedents 
his marriage assured him a sociai position 
but not necessarily respect 
newland archer had not stopped at his club 
as young men usually did 
but came directly to the beauforts 
he wanted the announcement
of his engagement
to divert gossip away from the countess 
and show his most ardent support
for may and her whole family 
the beaufort house
had been boldly planned 
instead of squeezing
through a narrow passage
to get to the ballroom 
one marched solemnly
down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms 
good evening 
but only by actually passing
through the crimson drawing room
could one see the return of spring 
the much discussed nude by bouguereau 
which beaufort had had the audacity
to hang in plain sight 
  good evening 
  good evening  mr archer 
archer enjoyed such challenges
to convention 
he questioned conformity in private 
but in public he upheld family and tradition 
this was a world balanced so precariously
that its harmony could be shattered
by a whisper 
on the whole  archer was amused
by the smooth hypocrisies of his peers 
he may even have envied them 
lawrence lefferts  for instance 
was new york s foremost authority on form 
and his opinion on pumps
versus patent leather oxfords
had never been disputed 
on matters of surreptitious romance 
his skills went unquestioned 
old mr sillerton jackson
was as great an authority on family
as lawrence lefferts was on form 
the mean and melancholy history
of countess olenska s european marriage
was a buried treasure
he hastened to excavate 
he carried  like a calling card 
an entire register
of the scandals and mysteries
that had smouldered
under the unruffled surface
of society for the last 50 years 
julius beaufort s secret was
the way he carried things off 
he could arrive casually at his own party 
as if he were another guest 
and might also leave early for a more modest 
but comforting address in the east 30s 
beaufort was intrepid in his business 
but in his personai affairs
absolutely audacious 
archer s fianc√©e was innocent
to all of these intrigues and of much else 
may welland represented
for archer all that was best in their world 
all that he honoured 
and she anchored him to it 
you see 
i ve told all my friends  just as you ve asked 
yes  i couldn t wait 
only i wish it hadn t had to be at a ball 
but even here  we re alone together 
the worst of it is that
i want to kiss you  and i can t 
newland 
did you tell ellen as i asked you to 
no  i didn t have the chance after all 
she s my cousin  newland 
if others know before she does   
it s just that she s been away for so long 
she s rather sensitive 
of course i ll tell her  dearest 
but i didn t see her yet 
she decided not to come at the last minute 
at the last minute 
she was afraid her dress
wasn t smart enough 
we all thought it was so lovely 
but she asked my aunt to take her home 
oh  well 
very handsome  very liberal 
in my time  a cameo set in pearls
was thought to be sufficient 
but it s the hand that sets off the ring 
isn t it  my dear  mr archer 
it s the new setting 
it shows the stone beautifully 
but it looks a little bare
to old fashioned eyes 
i hope you don t mean mine  my dear 
i like all the novelties 
my hands were modelled
in paris by the great roche 
he should do may s 
show me  child 
her hand is so tempered 
it s these modern sports
that spread the joints  but the skin is white 
and when s the wedding to be 
as soon as ever it can 
if only you ll back me up  mrs mingott 
we must give them time to get
to know each other a little better  mamma 
know each other 
everybody in new york
has always known everybody 
don t wait till the bubble s off the wine 
marry them before lent 
i may catch pneumonia any winter now 
and i want to give the wedding breakfast 
what a kind offer 
even if she had not been grandmother
to may 
mrs manson mingott
would still have been the first
to receive the required betrothai visit 
she was not only the matriarch of this world 
she was nearly its dowager empress 
much of new york was already related to her 
and she knew the remainder by marriage
or by reputation 
though brownstone was the norm 
she lived magisterially within a large house
of controversiai pale cream coloured stone
in an inaccessible wilderness
near the central park 
the burden of her flesh
had long since made it impossible
for her to go up and down stairs 
so with characteristic independence 
she had established herself
on the ground floor of her house 
from her sitting room  there was
an unexpected vista of her bedroom 
her visitors were startled and fascinated 
by the foreignness of this arrangement 
which recalled scenes in french fiction 
this was how women
with lovers lived in the wicked old societies 
but if mrs mingott had wanted a lover 
the intrepid woman would have had him  too 
for now she was content
simply for life and passion
to flow northward to her door
and to anticipate eagerly the union
of newland archer
with her granddaughter  may 
in them  two of new york s best families
would finally and momentously be joined 
  bye  mamma 
  good bye 
ellen 
  ladies  archer 
  aunt tessa  may 
beaufort  this is a rare favour 
unnecessarily rare  i d say 
i met countess ellen in madison square 
and she was good enough
to let me walk home with her 
this house will be merrier
now that she s here 
  thank you 
  beaufort  pull up that tuffet 
this one 
i want a good gossip 
of course  you already know
about may and me 
she scolded me
for not telling you at the opera 
of course i know  and i m so glad 
one doesn t tell such news first in a crowd 
careful there 
don t let your ring catch on your sleeve 
  good bye  ellen 
  good bye  good bye 
good bye 
come and see me someday 
it s a mistake for ellen
to be seen parading up
fifth avenue with julius beaufort 
at the crowded hour 
the very day after her arrival 
his behaviour is always so flagrant 
even his wife must know about annie ring 
sillerton jackson enjoyed his frequent visits
to the archer home
more than the actuai dining 
newland archer s mother
and his sister janey were both shy women
and shrank from society  but they like
to be well informed of its doings
and doted on their bachelor friend 
certain nuances escape beaufort 
necessarily  beaufort is a vulgar man 
nevertheless  no business nuances
escape him 
most of new york trusts him with its affairs 
my grandfather newland
always used to say to mother 
 don t let that fellow beaufort
be introduced to the girls   
at least he s had the advantage
of association with gentlemen 
the archers and the mingotts
were two of the sturdiest branches
of new york s tangled family tree 
granny mingott s family
could embrace may s traditionalism
and tolerate ellen s unconventionality 
but archer s family held fast to the old ways 
his mother and sister relied on him
for every security 
he would always be 
mrs archer assured may s mother 
their  strong right hand   
and our new cousin 
was she at the ball  too 
i appreciate the mingotts wanting
to support her  to have her at the opera 
i admire their esprit de corps 
but why my son s engagement
should be mixed up
with this woman s comings and goings 
i don t see 
well  in any case  she was not at the ball 
at least she had that decency 
sir 
oh  no 
i wonder if she wears a round hat
or a bonnet in the afternoon 
the dress she wore to the opera
was so plain and flat 
i m sure it was in better taste
not to go to the ball 
it wasn t a question of taste  mother 
may said the countess decided
her dress wasn t smart enough 
poor ellen 
we must always remember
the eccentric bringing up she had 
what can you expect of a girl
who was allowed to wear black satin
at her coming out ball 
it s odd she should ve kept
such an ugly name as ellen
when she married the count 
i should have changed it to elaine 
why 
i don t know  it sounds more polish 
it certainly sounds more conspicuous 
and that can hardly be what she wishes 
why not  why shouldn t she
be conspicuous if she chooses 
she made an awful marriage  but should she
hide her head as if it s her fault 
should she go slinking around
as if she disgraced herself 
she s had an unhappy life 
that doesn t make her an outcast 
i m sure that s the line
the mingotts mean to take 
i don t have to wait
for their cue if that s what you mean  sir 
i m told she s looking for a house 
she intends to live here 
i hear she means to get a divorce 
i hope she will 
understandably her marriage was intolerable 
but there are the rumours  too 
i ve heard them  the secretary 
he helped get her away from the husband 
they say the count kept her
practically a prisoner 
certainly the count had his own way of life 
you knew him 
i heard of him at nice 
handsome  they say  but   
eyes with a lot of lashes 
when he wasn t with women 
he was collecting china 
paying any price for both  i understand 
then where s the blame 
anyone of us under the same circumstances
would have helped the countess 
just as the secretary did 
he was still helping her a year later then 
because somebody met them living together
at lausanne 
living together 
well  why not  who has the right
to make her life over if she hasn t 
why should we bury a woman alive
if her husband prefers to live with whores 
it s hardly a question of entombment 
the countess is here after all 
or do you believe
a woman should share
the same freedoms as men 
i suppose i do  yes  i do 
well  apparently count olenski
takes a similarly modern view 
i never heard of him lifting a finger
to get his wife back 
three days later  the unthinkable happened 
mrs manson mingott sent out invitations
summoning everyone to a formai dinner 
such an occasion demanded
the most careful consideration 
it required the appropriated plate 
it called for three extra footmen 
two dishes for each course
and a roman punch in the middle 
the dinner  new york read on the invitation 
was  to meet the countess olenska   
and new york declined 
 regret unable to accept   
and from some of our own family 
no one cares enough even
to conceal their feelings about the countess 
this is a disgrace 
they all lived in a kind of
hieroglyphic world 
the reai thing was never said
or done or even thought 
but only represented
by a set of arbitrary signs 
archer knew these signs 
they were not subtle
and were not meant to be 
they were more than a simple snubbing 
they were an eradication 
there was a single court of appeai 
he would plead their case
before the van der luydens 
and all this  you think 
is due to some intentional interference by   
larry lefferts  yes  sir  i m certain of it 
the van der luydens dwelled
above the city s families
in a kind of super terrestriai twilight 
archer appealed to their exquisitely refined
sense of tribal order 
and he spoke plainly 
whenever poor gertrude lefferts begins
to suspect her husband of something 
larry starts making some great diversionary
fuss to show how moral he is 
well  it s the principle that i dislike 
i mean to say 
if a member of a well known family
is backed by that family 
it should be considered final 
we all felt this slight on the countess should
not pass without our consulting you 
so  we are giving a little dinner
for our cousin  the duke of st austrey 
who arrives next week on the russia 
i m sure louisa will be as glad as i am 
if countess olenska
will let us include her among our guests 
the occasion was a solemn one 
but the countess olenska arrived rather late 
signalling a carelessness
of which she was entirely unaware 
she entered without haste or embarrassment 
the drawing room
in which new york s most chosen company
was somewhat awfully assembled 
countess olenska 
good evening 
  we re delighted you re here 
  good evening 
the duke of st austrey 
may i present countess olenska 
the trevenna george ll plate was out 
so was the van der luyden lowestoft
from the east india company 
and the dagonet crown derby 
dining with the van der luydens
was at best no light matter 
dining there with a duke
who was their cousin
was almost a religious solemnity 
when the van der luydens chose 
they knew how to give a lesson 
excuse me 
it was not the custom
in new york drawing rooms
for a lady to get up
and walk away from one gentleman
in order to seek the company of another 
but the countess did not observe this rule 
i want you to talk to me about may 
you knew the duke before 
from nice  we used to see him every winter 
he s very fond of gambling  and he used
to come to our house a great deal 
he likes to wear the same suit every evening 
he thinks it brings him luck 
i think he s the dullest man i ever met 
but he seems to be admired here 
may i tell you
what most interests me about new york 
not all the blind obeying of tradition 
somebody else s tradition 
it seems stupid to have discovered america
only to make it a copy of another country 
do you suppose christopher columbus
would have taken all that trouble
just to go to the opera with larry lefferts 
well  i think
if he d suspected that lefferts were here 
the santa maria might never have left port 
and may  does she share these views 
if she does  she d never say so 
are you very much in love with her 
as much as a man can be 
do you think there s a limit 
if there is  i haven t found it 
it s really and truly a romance then 
not in the least arranged 
have you forgotten  in our country
we don t allow our marriages to be arranged 
yes  i forgot  i m sorry 
i sometimes make these mistakes 
i don t always remember
that everything here is good 
that was bad where i came from 
i m so sorry 
no 
but you know you are among friends here 
yes  i know  that s why i came home 
good evening  louisa 
may i present may welland 
you ll want to be with may 
i m so pleased to meet you 
she s already surrounded 
i have so many rivals 
yes 
then stay with me a little longer 
yes 
mr urban dagonet 
may i present the countess olenska 
how do you do  my dear 
how do you do 
tomorrow then  after 5 00 i ll expect you 
tomorrow 
excuse me 
it was good of you
to devote yourself to madame olenska
so unselfishly  dear newland 
i told henry he really must rescue you 
i think i ve never seen may looking lovelier 
the duke thinks her the handsomest woman
in the room 
it was my pleasure 
mr archer 
so how do you like this odd little house 
to me  it s like heaven 
  you ve arranged it delightfully 
  yes 
some of the things
i managed to bring with me 
little pieces of wreckage 
at least it s less gloomy
than the van der luydens  
and not so difficult to be alone 
i am sure it s often thought
the van der luydens  is gloomy 
though i ve never heard it said before 
but tell me  do you really like to be alone 
as long as my friends
keep me from being lonely 
i see you ve already chosen your corner 
yes 
  please  sit 
  thank you 
this is the hour i like best 
don t you 
i was afraid you d forgotten the hour 
i am sure beaufort can be very intriguing 
he took me to see some houses 
i m told i must move 
even though this street
seems perfectly respectable 
  yes  but it s not fashionable 
  fashionable 
is fashion such a serious consideration 
among people
who have nothing more serious to consider 
perhaps i ve been too independent 
all i really want is to feel cared for and safe 
thank you 
the van der luydens do nothing by halves 
all new york laid itself out for you last night 
it was so kind  such a nice party 
cream or lemon 
lemon  please 
the van der luydens are the most powerful
influence in new york society 
they very seldom receive
because of cousin louisa s health 
perhaps that s the reason then 
thank you   the reason  
for their influence 
they make themselves so rare 
but  of course  you must tell me 
no  it s you telling me 
  thank you 
  then we can both help each other 
but i need help so much more 
there are so many people all ready
to tell you what to do 
i think they re all a little angry with me
for setting up for myself 
still your family can advise you 
show you the way 
is new york such a labyrinth 
i thought it was all straight up and down 
like fifth avenue 
all the cross streets numbered 
and big  honest labels on everything 
everything is labelled  but everybody is not 
then i must count on you for warnings  too 
all the older women like and admire you 
they want to help 
i know  i know  as long
as they don t hear anything unpleasant 
does no one here want
to know the truth  mr archer 
the real loneliness
is living among all these kind people
who only ask you to pretend 
no  no  you mustn t 
madame olenska 
ellen 
does no one cry here either 
i suppose there s no need to 
mr archer  good evening 
we didn t see you this morning
and we weren t sure whether
to send miss welland the usual   
lilies of the valley  yes 
i think we better make that a standing order 
very good  sir 
and those yellow roses 
i ll give you another address 
very good 
george 
mr archer  two separate orders 
they ll go at once 
at once  sir 
it s wonderful to wake every morning
with lilies of the valley in my room 
it s like being with you 
they came late yesterday  i know 
somehow the time got away from me 
but still you always remember 
i sent some roses to your cousin ellen  too 
was that right 
very right 
she didn t mention it at lunch today though 
she said she got some wonderful orchids
from mr beaufort 
and a whole hamper of carnations
from cousin henry van der luyden 
she was so very delighted 
don t people send flowers in europe 
i know you do consider it a long time 
very long 
but the chiverses were engaged
for a year and a half 
larry lefferts and gertrude
were engaged for two 
i m sure mamma expects
something customary 
ever since you were little 
your parents let you have your way 
you re almost 22 
just tell your mother what you want 
i couldn t refuse her the very last thing
she d ask of me as a little girl 
can t we just strike out for ourselves  may 
shall we elope 
well  if you would  why not 
you do love me  newland  i m so happy 
well  why not be happier 
i couldn t be happier  dearest 
did i tell you i showed ellen the ring 
she thought it was
the most beautiful setting she ever saw 
she said there was nothing like it
in the rue de la paix 
i do love you  newland 
everything you do is so special 
i want to call on your legai skills
for a rather delicate matter 
countess olenska
wants to sue her husband for divorce 
it s been suggested she means
to marry again  although she denies it 
because of    i beg your pardon  sir 
but because of my engagement 
perhaps one of the other members of the firm
could consider this matter 
but precisely
because of your prospective alliance 
and considering that several members
of the family have already asked for you 
i d like you to consider the case 
it s a family matter 
perhaps it s best settled by the family 
their position is clear 
they re entirely and rightly
against a divorce 
but countess olenska still insists
on a legal opinion 
but really  what s the use of a divorce 
she s here  he s there 
the whole atlantic s between them 
as things go  olenski s acted generously 
he s already returned
some of the money without being asked 
she ll never get a dollar more than that 
although i understand
she attaches no importance to the money 
considering all that  the wisest thing really 
is to do as the family say 
just let well enough alone 
i think that s for her to decide 
have you considered the consequences
if the countess decides for divorce 
the consequences for the countess 
for everyone 
i don t think the count s accusations amount
to anything more than vague charges 
it will make for some talk 
well  i have heard talk
about the countess and the secretary 
i heard it even before i read the legal papers 
it s certain to be unpleasant 
unpleasant 
divorce is always unpleasant 
don t you agree 
naturally 
then i can count on you 
the family can count on you 
you will use your influence
against a divorce 
i can t promise that 
not until i ve talked to the countess 
i don t understand you  mr archer 
you want to marry into a family
with a scandalous divorce suit
hanging over it 
i don t think that has anything to do
with the case 
can someone take this for me
to the countess  please 
thank you 
you refuse such an invitation
on threat of death 
is it so bad 
not if you have a taste for slow agony 
that s something i ve neglected to cultivate 
three days at skuytercliff
with the van der luydens 
i think you better take your fur
and a hot water bottle 
is the house that cold 
no  but louisa is 
mr archer 
join me at delmonico s on sunday instead 
i m having a nice oyster supper
in your honour 
private room  congenial company 
artists and so on 
that s very tempting  i haven t met
a single artist since i ve been here 
i know one or two painters
i could bring to see you if you d allow me 
painters 
are there any painters in new york 
thank you 
but i was really thinking of singers 
actors  musicians  dramatic artists 
there were always so many
at my husband s house 
may i write tomorrow and let you know 
it s too late to decide this evening 
  is this late 
  yes 
because i still have
to talk business with mr archer 
of course  newland 
if you can persuade the countess
to change her mind about sunday 
you can join us  too 
you know painters then 
you live in their milieu 
not exactly 
but you care about such things 
immensely  when i m in paris or london 
i never miss an exhibition 
i try to keep up 
i used to care immensely  too 
my life was full of such things 
but now i want to cast off all my old life
to become a complete american
and try to be like everybody else 
i don t think you ll ever quite be
like everybody else 
don t say that to me  please 
i just want to put
all the old things behind me 
i know 
mr letterblair told me 
mr letterblair 
yes  i ve come because he asked me to 
i m in the firm 
you mean it ll be you
who ll manage everything for me 
i can talk to you  that s so much easier 
yes  i m here to talk about it 
i ve read all the legal papers 
and the letter from the count 
it was vile 
but if he chooses to fight the case 
he can say things that might be   
that might be disagreeable to you 
and say them publicly 
so that they could be damaging even if   
if 
even if they were unfounded 
what harm could accusations
like that do me here 
perhaps more harm than anywhere else 
our legislation favours divorce 
but our social customs don t 
never 
well  not if the woman
has appearances
in the least degree against her 
has exposed herself
by any unconventional behaviour 
to offensive insinuations and   
yes  so my family tell me 
our family  you ll be my cousin soon 
and you agree with them 
what could you possibly gain
that would make up for the scandal 
my freedom 
but aren t you free already 
it s my business
to help you see these things just the way
the people who are fondest of you see them 
all your friends and relations 
if i didn t show you honestly
how they judge such matters 
it wouldn t be fair of me  would it 
no  it wouldn t be fair 
very well  i ll   
do as you wish 
i   
i do want to help you 
you do help me 
good night  cousin 
for mercy s sake  don t cry so bitterly 
forget what i ve done 
on one condition 
i accept it  whatever it may be 
never speak a word of love to me again 
never 
on my honour 
heaven bless you 
farewell 
it s fascinating  every season  the same play 
the same scene 
the same effect on the audience 
remarkable  isn t it  newland 
i m enjoying it even more
than the london production 
you see this play even when you travel 
  i travel to get away from it 
  so was it a dinner 
it was a reception at mrs struthers 
given on the lord s day but with champagne
and singing from the table tops 
people say there was dancing 
it was a real french sunday then 
well  dissipation can be
wonderfully energising in the early stages   
do you think her lover will send her
a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning 
i   
i was thinking about that  too 
the farewell scene 
yes  i know 
it touches me as well 
i usually leave the theatre after that scene
to take the picture away with me 
i had a letter from may from st augustine 
they always spend the winter there 
on account of her mother s bronchitis 
and what do you do while may is away 
i do my work 
i do want you to know
what you advised me was right 
things can be so difficult sometimes 
and i m so grateful 
the next day newland archer
searched the city in vain
for yellow roses 
from his office 
he sent a note to madame olenska
asking to call that afternoon 
and requesting reply by messenger 
there was no reply that day or the next 
and when yellow roses were again available 
archer passed them by 
it was only on the third day
that he heard from her by post 
from the van der luydens  country home 
 newland  i ran away the day
after i saw you at the play 
 and these kind friends have taken me in 
 i wanted to be quiet and think things over 
 i feel so safe here 
i wish that you were with us 
 yours sincerely   
he had received an invitation
from the lefferts
for a weekend on the hudson 
and he hoped it was not too late to reply 
their house was not far
from the van der luydens  
i came to see
what you were running away from 
i knew you d come 
that shows you wanted me to 
cousin may wrote 
she asked you to take care of me 
  i didn t need to be asked 
  why 
does that mean
i m so helpless and defenceless 
or that women here are so blessed 
they never feel need 
what sort of need 
please don t ask me 
i don t speak your language 
henry left the old patroon house open
for me  i want you to see it 
when you wrote me  you were unhappy 
yes  but i can t feel unhappy
when you re here 
i shan t be here long 
i know 
ellen  if you really wanted me to come 
if i m really to help you 
you must tell me what you re running from 
is he what you were running from 
or what you expected 
i didn t know he was here 
hello  beaufort  this way 
madame olenska was expecting you 
hello 
well  you ve certainly led me
on a bit of a chase 
all this way just to tell you
i d found the perfect little house for you 
it s not on the market yet 
so you must take it at once 
well  archer  rusticating 
that night he did not take
the customary comfort
in his monthly shipment
of books from london 
the taste of the usual
was like cinders in his mouth 
and there were moments when he felt
as if he were being buried alive
under his future 
 newland  come late tomorrow 
i must explain to you 
 ellen   
newland  has anything happened 
yes  i found i had to see you 
  what is it 
  nothing 
so tell me what you do all day 
well  there are a few very pleasant people
from philadelphia and baltimore
who are picnicking at the inn 
and the merrys
are setting up a lawn tennis court 
but nobody here s really heard
of the game yet 
i have my racket  of course 
and so does kate merry 
but she s had this terrible case of bronchitis 
she s still not quite got over it yet  so   
but i thought   
i came here because i thought
i could persuade you
to break away from all that 
to advance our engagement 
don t you understand
how much i want to marry you 
why should we dream away another year 
i m not sure i do understand  newland 
is it because you re not certain
of feeling the same way about me 
what on earth do you mean 
is there someone else 
someone else 
between you and me 
let s talk frankly  newland 
i ve felt a difference in you 
especially since our engagement 
since our engagement 
if it s untrue 
then it won t hurt to talk about it 
and if it is true 
then why shouldn t we talk about it now 
i mean  you might have made a mistake 
if i d made some sort of a mistake 
would i be down here 
asking you to hurry our marriage 
i don t know  you might 
it would be one way to settle the question 
in newport  two years ago 
before we were promised 
everyone said
there was someone else for you 
i even saw you with her once 
sitting together on a veranda at a dance 
when she came into the house 
her face looked so sad 
i felt sorry for her 
and even after  when we were engaged 
i could still see how she looked and   
is that   
is that all you ve been concerned about 
it s long passed 
then is there something else 
no  of course not 
whatever it may have been 
newland  i can t have my happiness
made out of a wrong to somebody else 
if promises were made  or if you feel
in some way pledged to this person 
even if it means her getting a divorce 
then  newland 
don t give her up because of me 
there are no pledges 
there are no promises that matter 
that s all i ve been trying to say 
there is no one between us 
there is nothing between us  may 
which is precisely my argument
for getting married 
quickly 
he could feei her dropping back
to inexpressive girlishness 
her conscience had been eased
of its burden 
it was wonderfui  he thought 
how such depths of feeling
could coexist
with such an absence of imagination 
  and did you succeed 
  no 
no  i d still like to be married in april 
with your help 
now you re seeing the mingott way 
is this really so difficult 
the entire family is difficult 
not one of them wants to be different 
when they are different 
they end up like ellen s parents 
nomads  continental wanderers 
dragging ellen about 
lavishing on her an expensive 
but incoherent education 
out of all of them  i don t believe there s one
that takes after me but my little ellen 
you ve got a quick eye 
why in the world didn t you marry her 
well  for one thing 
she wasn t there to be married 
no  to be sure 
and she s still not  the count  you know 
he s written to mr letterblair 
he wants her back  on her own terms 
the count doesn t defend himself 
i will say that 
and ellen will be losing a great deal
if she stayed here 
there s her old life 
gardens at nice 
jewels  of course  music and conversation 
she says she goes unnoticed in europe 
but i know her portrait s
been painted nine times 
all this  and the remorse of a guilty husband 
i d rather see her dead 
would you really 
we should remember marriage is marriage 
and ellen is still a wife 
ellen  see who s here 
yes  i know 
i went to see your mother
to ask where you ve gone 
since you never answered my note 
i was afraid you might be ill 
well  he was in such a rush to get married 
that s why 
fresh off the train  and straight here 
he wants me to use all my influence
just to marry his sweetheart sooner 
well  surely  granny  between us 
we can persuade the wellands
to do as he wishes 
there  newland  you see 
right to the quick of the problem  like me 
i told him he should have married you 
and what did he say 
oh  my darling 
i leave you to find that out 
i wish i didn t have to leave 
i shall see you very soon  i hope 
fine 
i ll see you out 
when can i see you 
the struthers
are sending the carriage at 7 00 
good evening 
who s ridiculous enough
to send me a bouquet 
i m not going to a ball  and i m not engaged 
nastasia 
some people are always ridiculous 
take these to that nice family
down the street 
well  i ll tell you 
in almost everything she says 
there s something true
and something untrue 
why  what has granny been telling you 
i think she believes
you might go back to your husband 
i think she believes
you might at least consider it 
a lot of things have been believed of me 
but if she thinks i would consider it 
that also means she would consider it for me 
as granny is weighing your idea
of advancing the marriage 
may and i had a frank talk in florida 
it s probably our first 
she wants a long engagement 
to give me time 
time for what 
she thinks i want to marry her at once   
to get away from someone that i care for
more 
time to give her up for another woman 
if i want to 
that s very noble 
yes 
but it s ridiculous 
why 
because there is no other woman 
no 
because i don t mean to marry anyone else 
this other woman  does she love you too 
there is no other woman 
the person may was thinking of was never   
that must be your carriage 
yes  i   
i suppose i should be leaving soon 
to mrs struthers  
yes  i must go where i m invited 
or i should be too lonely 
why not come with me 
may guessed the truth 
there is another woman 
only  not the one she thinks 
don t make love to me 
too many people have done that 
i ve never made love to you 
but you are the woman i would ve married
if it had been possible for either of us 
you can say that when you re the one
who s made it impossible 
  i ve made it 
  isn t it you who made me give up divorcing 
didn t you talk to me here  in this house 
about sacrifice and sparing scandal 
and for may s sake  and for yours 
i did what you asked me 
there were things in your husband s letter   
i had nothing to fear from that letter 
absolutely nothing 
i was just afraid of scandal
for the family and you and may 
ellen 
ellen 
nothing s   
nothing s done that can t be undone 
i m still free 
you can be  too 
please  ellen 
lord  can i marry may now 
do you see me marrying may now 
i don t see you putting that question to may 
do you 
but i have to 
it s too late to do anything else 
you say that because it s the easiest thing
to say at this moment 
not because it s true 
i don t understand you 
you don t understand
because you don t yet realise
how you ve changed things for me 
you don t know all that you ve done 
all i ve done 
all the good things you ve done for me 
newland  that i never knew 
going to the van der luydens 
because people refused to meet me 
announcing your engagement at the ball
so there would be
two families standing behind me
instead of one 
i never understood
how dreadful people thought i was 
granny blurted it out one day 
i was stupid  i never thought   
new york meant freedom to me 
everyone seemed so kind 
and glad to see me 
but they never knew
what it meant to be tempted 
but you did  you understood 
i d never known that before 
and it s better than anything i ve known 
newland  you couldn t be happy
if it meant being cruel 
if we act any other way 
i ll be making you act
against what i love in you most 
and i can t go back to that way of thinking 
don t you see 
i can t love you  unless i give you up 
 ellen  granny s telegram was successful 
 grandma and mamma agreed
to marriage after easter  only a month 
 i will telegraph newland 
i m too happy for words  and love you dearly 
 your grateful cousin  may   
there had been wild rumours
right up to the wedding day
that mrs mingott
would actually attend the ceremony 
it was known that she had sent a carpenter
to measure the front pew 
in case it might be altered
to accommodate her 
but this idea  like the great lady herself 
proved to be unwieldy 
and she settled
for giving the wedding breakfast 
the countess olenska sent her regrets 
she was travelling with an aunt 
but gave the bride and groom
an exquisite piece of old lace 
two elderly aunts in rhinebeck
offered a honeymoon cottage 
and  since it was thought very english
to have a country house on loan 
their offer was accepted 
when the house
proved suddenly uninhabitable  however 
henry van der luyden
stepped in to offer an old cottage
on his property nearby 
may accepted the offer
as a surprise for her husband 
she d never seen the house 
but her cousin  ellen  had mentioned it once 
she had said it was the only house
in america
where she could imagine
being perfectly happy 
they travelled to the expected places 
which may had never seen 
in london  archer ordered his clothes 
and they went to the national gallery 
and sometimes to the theatre 
i hope i don t look ridiculous 
i ve never dined out in london 
english women dress just like
everybody else in the evening  don t they 
how can you say that
when they re always at the theatre
in old ball dresses and bare heads 
well  maybe they save their new dresses
for home 
then i shouldn t have worn this 
no  you look very fine 
really quite beautiful 
in paris  she ordered her clothes 
there were trunks of dresses from worth 
they visited the tuileries 
may s hands were modelled in marble
at roche s studio 
and occasionally  they dined out 
but tell me  you were saying that you were
actually advised here by maupassant 
yes  unfortunately 
i was advised not to write 
archer embraced his new marriage 
even as he reverted
to his old inherited ideas about matrimony 
it was less trouble to conform with tradition 
there was no use trying to emancipate a wife
who hadn t the dimmest notion
that she was not free 
when we were in london 
we could only manage one day
at the national 
we were taken up
by a mrs carfry and mrs harle   
we had an awfully good talk 
he s an interesting fellow 
we talked about books 
and many different things 
i thought i d invite him to dinner 
  the frenchman 
  yes 
i didn t have much chance to talk to him 
but wasn t he a little common 
common 
i thought he was clever 
i suppose i shouldn t have known
if he was clever 
then  i won t ask him to dine 
with a chill  he knew that in future 
many problems
would be solved for him in this same way 
the first six months of marriage
were usually said to be the hardest 
and after that  he thought they would have
pretty nearly finished
polishing down all the rough edges 
but may s pressure
was already wearing down
the very roughness he most wanted to keep 
as for the madness with madame olenska 
archer trained himself to remember it
as the last of his discarded experiments 
she remained in his memory
simply as the most plaintive 
and poignant of a line of ghosts 
she s very deft 
yes  well 
that s the only kind of target she ll ever hit 
no one could ever be jealous
of may s triumphs 
she managed
to give the feeling that she would have been
just as serene without them 
but what if all her calm  her niceness 
were just a negation 
a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness 
archer felt
he had never yet lifted that curtain 
quite stunning  isn t it 
it s julius beaufort
who donates the club s prizes  isn t it 
this looks like him  of course 
it will make quite an heirloom  my dear 
you should leave it to your eldest daughter 
what s the matter  aren t there going
to be any daughters  only sons 
what  can t i say that either 
look at her blushing 
ellen  ellen  are you upstairs 
she s over from portsmouth 
spending the day with me 
it s such a nuisance 
she just won t stay in newport 
insists on putting up with those   
what s their names  blenkers 
but i gave up arguing
with young people 50 years ago  ellen 
i m sorry  ma am 
miss ellen s not in the house 
she s left 
i saw her going down the shore path 
run down and fetch her
like a good grandson 
may and i
will have a gossip about julius beaufort 
go ahead 
i know she ll want to see you both 
is it true beaufort
has given annie ring a diamond bracelet 
i hear he even plans to bring her to newport 
he had heard her name often enough
during the year and a half
since they had last met 
he was even familiar
with the main incidents of her life 
but he heard
all these accounts with detachment 
as if listening
to reminiscences of someone long dead 
but the past
had come again into the present 
as in those newly discovered caverns
in tuscany 
where children had lit bunches of straw 
and seen old images staring from the wall 
he gave himself a single chance 
she must turn before the sailboat
crosses the lime rock light 
then  he would go to her 
i m sorry you didn t find her 
but i ve heard she s so changed 
changed 
so indifferent to her old friends 
summering in portsmouth 
moving to washington 
sometimes  i think we ve always bored her 
i wonder if she wouldn t be happier
with her husband after all 
i don t think
i ve ever heard you be cruel before 
cruel 
even demons
don t think people are happier in hell 
then she shouldn t have married abroad 
here  let me  go on  walk on 
the blenkers  a party for the blenkers 
who are they 
the portsmouth people  i think 
the ones countess olenska is staying with 
 professor and mrs emerson sillerton
request the pleasure wednesday afternoon 
 at 3 00 o clock  punctually
to meet mrs and the misses blenker 
 red gables  catherine street   
i don t think we can decline 
i don t see why  really  he s an archaeologist 
and he s sillerton jackson s cousin 
of course 
some of us will have to go 
i ll go over 
and  janey  why don t you come with me 
i m sure cousin ellen will be there 
it will give you a chance to see her 
newland  you can find a way
to spend your afternoon  can t you 
i think for a change 
i ll just save it instead of spending it 
maybe i ll drive to the farm
to see about a new horse for the brougham 
well  at least the jacksons didn t choose
the day of the cup race for their party 
of course 
i shouldn t be surprised if they had 
hello 
i m sorry  did you ring 
i ve been asleep in the hammock 
well  i didn t mean to disturb you 
are you miss blenker  i m newland archer 
yes  i ve heard so much about you 
i came to the island to look for a new horse 
i thought i d call 
but the house seems to be empty 
it is empty  they re all at the party 
everyone s there  but me with my fever 
and countess olenska 
you found my parasol 
it s my best one  it s from the cameroons 
well  it s very pretty 
the countess was called away 
yes  a telegram came from boston 
she said she might be gone for two days 
i do love
the way she does her hair  don t you 
it reminds me of sir walter scott 
you don t know    i m sorry 
but i have to be in boston tomorrow 
you wouldn t happen to know
where she was staying 
ellen 
i m here on business 
i just got here  actually 
you re doing your hair differently 
only because my maid s not with me 
she stayed back in portsmouth  i m here only
for two days  it didn t seem worthwhile 
you are travelling alone 
yes 
why  do you think it s a little dangerous 
well  it s unconventional 
yes  i suppose it is 
i ve just done
something so much more unconventional 
i refused
to take back money that belonged to me 
someone came with an offer 
what were the conditions 
i refused 
  tell me the conditions 
  nothing unbearable  really 
just to sit at the head
of his table now and then 
and he wants you back at any price 
well  it s a considerable price 
at least  it s considerable for me 
so  you came to see him 
my husband  here  no  of course not 
no  he sent someone 
his secretary 
yes 
he s still here  in fact 
he insisted on waiting 
in case i changed my mind 
you haven t changed  newland 
i had changed until i saw you again 
please don t 
just give me the day 
i ll say anything you like  or nothing 
i won t speak unless you tell me to 
all i want is some time with you 
i want to get you away from that man 
is he coming to hotel 
  at 11 00   
  well  let s go now 
i ll have to leave a note at the hotel 
write on this  i have the paper 
you see how everything is predestined 
and these  have you seen these 
the new stylographic pen 
it s just like   
it s like jerking down the mercury
in a thermometer  now 
try that 
it s not working 
that should do it 
  shall i take it in 
  i ll be only a moment 
why didn t you come down to the beach
to get me the day i was at granny s 
because you didn t turn around  i swore   
i swore i wouldn t call you
unless you turned around 
but i didn t look around on purpose 
you knew 
i recognised the carriage when you drove in 
so  i went to the beach 
to get as far away from me as you could 
as i could  yes 
well  you see  it s no use 
it s better if we face each other 
i only want to be honest with you 
honest  isn t that why
you always admired julius beaufort 
he was more honest than the rest
of us  wasn t he  we ve no character 
no colour  no variety 
i don t know
why you don t just go back to europe 
  i believe that s because of you 
  me 
i m the man who married one woman
because another one told him to 
you promised not to say such things today 
i can t keep that promise 
what about may  what about how may feels 
if you re using my marriage
as some victory of ours 
then there s really no reason on earth
why you shouldn t go back 
you gave me my first glimpse of a real life 
and then you told me
to carry on with a false one 
no one can endure that 
i m enduring it 
what s the use  i know you ll go back 
i won t  not yet 
not as long as we both can stand it 
this is not a life for you 
it is  as long as it s part of yours 
you won t go back 
i won t go back 
he would see her again 
at the theatre  or a reception 
perhaps he might be seated next to her 
perhaps they might
have another time alone  somewhere 
but he could not live without seeing her 
mr archer  i think 
yes 
my name is riviere 
i dined with you in paris last year 
yes  i m sorry  i didn t quite recall 
quite all right  i had the advantage 
i saw you in boston yesterday 
i came here on count olenski s behalf 
because i believed in all good faith
that she should return to him 
forgive me 
forgive me  monsieur 
but i really don t understand your purpose
in coming to see me 
she s changed  monsieur 
you knew her before 
i used to see her
at her husband s house  yes 
well  the count would not
have entrusted my mission to a stranger 
this change that you mentioned 
it may only have been my seeing her
for the first time 
as she is  as an american 
she made her marriage in good faith 
it was a faith the count could not share 
could not understand 
so  her faith was   
detruit 
  broken  destroyed 
  destroyed 
returning to europe
would mean a life of some comfort 
and considerable sacrifice 
and  i would think  no hope 
i will  of course 
fulfil my obligation to the count 
and meet with the family 
i will tell them everything that he suggests 
and wishes for the countess 
but i would ask you to use your influence
with them 
i beg you  monsieur  do not let her go back 
when old mrs baxter pennilow died 
they found her standing order 
48 worth dresses 
still wrapped in tissue paper 
when her daughters left off their mourning 
they wore the first lot to the symphony
without looking in advance of the fashion 
he had written to her once in washington 
just a few lines asking
when they would meet again 
and she wrote back   not yet   
and even that had the front panel changed 
no  i think it was julius beaufort
who started the new fashion 
by making his wife clap her new clothes
on her back as soon as they arrived 
i must say  it takes
all regina s distinction not to look like   
her rivals 
like that annie ring 
careful  dear 
everybody knows 
indeed 
beaufort always put his business around 
and now that his business is gone 
there are bound to be disclosures 
gone  is it really that bad 
as bad as anything i ever heard of 
most everybody we know will be hit
one way or another 
very difficult for regina  of course 
and  it s a pity 
it s certainly a pity that countess olenska
refused her husband s offer 
why  for god s sake 
well  to put it on the lowest ground 
  what s she going to live on now 
  live on 
i mean  now that beaufort   
what the hell does that mean  sir 
most of her money s invested with beaufort 
and the allowance she s been getting
from the family is so cut back 
i m sure she has something 
i would think a little 
whatever remains after sustaining more debt 
i know the family paid close attention
to monsieur riviere 
and considered the count s offer
very carefully 
if everyone had rather
she be beaufort s mistress
than some decent fellow s wife 
you ve all gone about it perfectly 
she won t go back 
that s your opinion  eh 
well  no doubt you know 
i suppose she might still soften
catherine mingott 
who could give her
any allowance she chooses 
but the rest of the family have no particular
interest in keeping her here 
they ll simply let her   
find her own level 
evening  sir 
thank you  martin 
that lamp is smoking again 
the servant should see to it 
i m sorry 
i may have to go to washington
for a few days 
when 
tomorrow  i m sorry 
i should have said it before 
on business 
on business  of course 
there s a patent case
coming up before the supreme court 
i just got the papers from letterblair 
it seems that he intended   
never mind  it sounds too complicated 
i have enough trouble managing this lamp 
let me try that 
but the change will do you good 
and you must be sure to go and see ellen 
excuse me  ma am 
but this came for you while you were out 
do something about this  will you  alice 
certainly  sir 
granny s had a stroke 
a stroke 
ridiculous 
i told them all 
it was just an excessive thanksgiving 
dr bencomb acted most concerned
and insisted on notifying everyone 
as if it were the last reading of my will
and testament 
you re very dear to come 
but perhaps you only wanted to see
what i d left you 
granny  that s shocking 
it was shock that did this to me 
no  it s all due to regina beaufort 
she came here last night 
and she asked me   
she asked me    she had the effrontery
to ask me to back julius 
not to desert him  she said 
to stand behind our common lineage
in the townsend family 
if you back julius 
you can see the family through 
if you don t 
we will all 
every one of us  fall into dishonour 
i said to her   
honour s always been honour 
and honesty s always been honesty
in manson mingott s house 
and will be  till i m carried out feet first 
and then she said  if you can believe this 
 but my name  auntie   
but my name  auntie 
my name s regina townsend 
and i said to her   
your name was beaufort
when he covered you with jewels 
and it s got to stay beaufort 
now that he s covered you with shame 
and then i gave out 
simply gave out 
and now family is arriving from all over 
expecting a funeral 
and they ll have to be entertained 
i don t know
how many notes bencomb sent out 
  if there s anything we can do to help out   
  well  my ellen is coming 
i expressly asked for her 
she arrives this afternoon on the train 
if you could fetch her   
of course  if may will send the brougham 
i ll take the ferry 
fine  fine  thank you 
there  you see  granny 
everyone will be settled 
thank you  dear  bless you 
i didn t want to worry granny 
but how can you meet ellen
and bring her back here
if you have to go
to washington yourself this afternoon 
i m not going  the case is off  postponed 
i heard from letterblair this morning 
postponed  how odd 
mama had a note
from him this morning as well 
he was concerned about granny 
but had to be away 
he was arguing a big patent case
before the supreme court 
you did say it was a patent case  didn t you 
well  that s it  the whole office can t go 
letterblair decided to go himself 
so then  it s not postponed 
no  but my going is 
he knew it was two hours by ferry
and carriage from the pennsylvania terminus
in jersey city back to mrs mingott s 
all of two hours 
and maybe a little more 
  you didn t expect me today 
  no 
i nearly came to washington to see you 
we would have missed each other 
it was granny mingott who sent me 
she s much better 
you know  i hardly remembered you 
hardly remembered 
i mean    i mean  each time is the same 
you happen to me all over again 
yes  i know 
for me  too 
ellen  we can t stay like this  it can t last 
i think we should look at reality  not dreams 
i just want us to be together 
i can t be your wife  newland 
is it your idea i should live with you
as your mistress 
i want   
somehow i want to get away with you 
and find a world
where words like that don t exist 
oh  my dear 
where is that country 
have you ever been there 
is there anywhere we can be happy
behind the backs of people who trust us 
i m beyond caring about that 
no  you re not 
you ve never been beyond that 
i have 
i know what it looks like  it s no place for us 
why are   
why are we stopping  this isn t granny s 
no  i ll get out here 
you were right  i shouldn t have come today 
what are you reading 
it s a book about japan 
why 
i don t know 
because it s a different country 
you used to read poetry 
it was so nice when you read it to me 
newland 
you ll catch your death 
of course 
but then he realised   i am dead 
 i ve been dead for months and months   
then it occurred to him that she might die 
people did 
young people  healthy people did 
she might die and set him free 
newland 
ellen  i have to see you 
i didn t know when you were leaving again 
i m    i m not leaving 
granny s asked me to stay
and take care of her 
then we have to talk now 
i m due at regina beaufort s 
granny lent me her carriage 
i know granny says julius beaufort
is a scoundrel 
but so is my husband  and the family still
want me to go back to him 
only granny understands 
she s even seen to my allowance 
i have to see you 
somewhere we can be alone 
  in new york 
  alone  somewhere we can be alone 
the art museum in the park  2 30 tomorrow 
i ll be at the door 
you came to new york
because you were afraid 
  afraid 
  of my coming to washington 
i thought i would be safer 
safer from me 
ellen 
s   
safer from loving me 
shall i come to you once and then go home 
come to me once then 
when 
tomorrow 
the day after 
i m sorry i m late 
you weren t worried  were you 
is it late 
it s past 7 00 
i stayed at granny s
because cousin ellen came in 
we had a wonderful talk 
she was so dear  just like the old ellen 
granny was so charmed by her 
but you can see  though  how the family s
been annoyed with her at times 
going to see regina beaufort
in granny s carriage and   
are we dining out tonight 
you haven t kissed me today 
it was the custom in old new york
for brides to appear in their wedding dress
during the first year or two of marriage 
but may  since returning from europe 
had not worn her bridal satin
untii this evening 
may  i m sorry  my head s bursting 
please don t tell anyone 
come home with me now 
shouldn t you rest 
my head s not as bad as that 
and there s something important
i have to say to you right away 
may  there is something
that i ve got to tell you 
about myself 
madame olenska   
why should we talk about ellen tonight 
because i should have spoken before and   
is it really worthwhile  dear 
i know i ve been unfair to her at times 
perhaps we all have 
you ve understood her better
than any of us  i suppose 
but does it really matter
now that it s all over 
how do you mean   over  
why  since she s going back
to europe so soon 
granny s approved  and understands 
she s disappointed  of course 
but she s arranged to make ellen
financially independent of the count 
i    i thought you would have heard today
at your offices 
  it s impossible 
  impossible 
certainly she could have stayed here
with granny s extra money 
but i guess she s given us up  after all 
how do you know that 
from ellen 
i told you  i saw her at granny s yesterday 
and she told you that  yesterday 
no  she sent me a note this afternoon 
do you want to see it 
i thought you knew 
 may  dear 
i have at last made granny understand
 that my visit
to her could be no more than a visit 
 and she has been as kind
and generous as ever   
 and she has been as kind
and generous as ever 
 she sees now that if i return to europe 
i must live by myself 
 i am hurrying back to washington
to pack up  and i saii next week 
 you be must very good to granny
when i m gone 
 as good as you ve always been to me 
 if any of my friends wish to urge me
to change my mind 
 please tell them it would be utterly useless   
     tell them it would be utterly useless   
why did she write this 
i suppose
because we talked things over yesterday 
what things 
i told her that i was afraid
i hadn t always been fair to her 
that i hadn t always understood
how hard it must have been for her here 
i knew you d be the one friend she could
always count on  and i wanted her to know
that you and i were the same
in all of our feelings 
she understood why i wanted to tell her this 
i think she understands everything 
my head aches too 
  good night  dear 
  good night 
it was  as mrs archer said to mrs welland 
a great event
for a young couple to give their first dinner 
and it was not to be undertaken lightly 
there was a hired chef 
two borrowed footmen 
roses from henderson s 
roman punch and menus
on gilt edged cards 
it was considered a particular triumph
that the van der luydens 
at may s request 
stayed in the city to be present
at her farewell dinner
for the countess olenska 
you have to leave new york
after the disgrace   
archer saw all the harmless looking people
at the table as a band of quiet conspirators 
with himself
and ellen the centre of their conspiracy 
he guessed himself
to have been for months the centre
of countless silently observing eyes
and patiently listening ears 
he understood that somehow the separation
between himself and the partner of his guilt
had been achieved 
and he knew that now the whole tribe
had rallied around his wife 
he was a prisoner
in the centre of an armed camp 
i wonder if they ll ever get it back 
regina s not well at all 
but that doesn t stop beaufort
from devoting as much time
to annie ring as he can manage 
the best thing beaufort could do
would be to go and stay
at regina s little place in north carolina 
he could breed trotters   
and the key to his release
had been returned the day before 
by maii  unopened 
he may stay here as a deliberate challenge
to the outrage he s created 
perhaps he ll run for public office 
then will annie ring be his first lady 
was your trip from washington very tiring 
the heat on the train was dreadful 
but all travel has its hardships 
well  whatever they may be 
they re worth it just to get away 
i mean to do a lot of travelling myself soon 
what about you  philip 
what about a little adventure 
athens and smyrna 
maybe even constantinople 
possibly  possibly 
but not naples 
dr bencomb says there s a fever 
really  a fever in naples 
well  there s always india  of course 
you must have three weeks
to do india properly 
absolutely 
beaufort may not receive
invitations any more 
but it s clear
he still maintains a certain position 
horizontal from all i ve heard 
if things go on like this 
we ll be seeing our children
fighting for invitations to swindlers  houses
and marrying beaufort s bastards 
has he got any 
be careful there  gentlemen 
draw it mild  draw it mild 
society has a history
of tolerating vulgar women after all 
up to a point 
but once it tolerates a man of that kind 
  the only prospect is total disinheritance   
  have you ever noticed
it s the people with the worst cooks
who are always yelling
about being poisoned when they dine out 
lefferts used to be
a little more adept  i thought 
but then grace is not always required
as long as one knows the steps 
i ve never heard lefferts so abound
in the sentiments
that adorn christian manhood 
indignation lends a scathing eloquence 
it s almost as effective as fear 
the pressure at home must be unrelenting 
i never expected to hear
such a paean to the sanctity   
my mother had a bronze reduction
of the venus de milo she wanted to give us   
the silent organisation
which held this whole small world together
was determined to put itself on record 
it had never for a moment questioned
the propriety of madame olenska s conduct 
it had never questioned archer s fidelity 
and it had never heard of 
suspected or even conceived possible
anything at all to the contrary 
ellen 
from the seamless performance of this rituai 
archer knew that new york
believed him to be madame olenska s lover 
we were discussing
the martha washington ball 
yes  we have it during easter week
to benefit the blind society 
they do excellent work 
lawrence  lawrence   
and he understood for the first time
that his wife shared the belief 
you must come visit me when you do 
i ll write you as soon as i m settled
and let you know where i am 
yes  that would be lovely 
shall i see you to your carriage 
we are driving dear ellen home 
goodbye 
good bye 
and i ll see you very soon in paris 
if you and may could come 
shall we make our way
to the carriage  my dear 
delightful evening  newland 
good night  newland 
good night  sillerton  good night  larry 
it did go off beautifully  didn t it 
yes 
may i come in and talk it over 
of course  but you must be very sleepy 
  no  i m not  i d like to be with you a little 
  fine 
if you feel up to it  may 
there is something
that i ve been wanting to talk to you about 
and i tried to talk to you the other evening 
yes  dear  something about yourself 
about myself  yes 
it s so difficult to find the right words 
but it s just that
i feel so terribly tired at the moment 
and i think   
each day a little more so 
and i think it would be better for everyone
if i were to make a break 
you mean give up the law 
well  certainly that would be a part of it 
and also just to   
just to get away 
i    i d like to do some travelling 
to europe or   
perhaps even farther 
how far 
i don t know  i thought   
india or japan 
as far as that 
well   
i m afraid you can t  dear 
not unless you take me with you 
that is  if the doctors will let me go 
and i m afraid they won t 
newland  i ve been sure of something
since this morning 
and i ve been longing to tell you 
oh  my dear 
you didn t guess 
no  i mean  of course  i    i hoped  but   
have you told anyone else 
only mamma and your mother   
and ellen 
i told you we had a long talk one afternoon
and how wonderful she was to me 
did you mind my telling her  newland 
mind  why should i 
but that was two weeks ago  wasn t it 
i thought you just said
you weren t sure till today 
no  i    i wasn t sure then 
but i told her i was 
and you see  i was right 
it was the room
in which most of the reai things
of his life had happened 
their eldest boy  theodore 
too delicate to be taken to church
in midwinter 
had been christened there 
i baptise thee in the name of the father 
and of the son 
and of the holy spirit 
it was here that ted took his first steps 
and it was here that archer
and his wife always discussed
the future of all their children 
bill s interest in archaeology 
mary s passion for sports and philanthropy 
ted s inclination toward art
that led to a job with an architect 
as well as some considerable redecoration 
it was in this room
that mary had announced her engagement   
i m so happy for you 
to the dullest and most reliable
of larry lefferts  many sons 
and it was in this room  too 
that her father had kissed her
through her wedding veii
before they motored to grace church 
he was a dutifui and loving father 
and a faithful husband 
when may died of infectious pneumonia
after nursing bill safely through 
he had honestly mourned her 
the world of her youth had fallen into pieces
and rebuilt itself without her ever noticing 
this hard  bright blindness 
her incapacity to recognise change 
made her children conceal their views
from her  just as archer concealed his 
she died thinking the world a good place 
full of loving
and harmonious households like her own 
newland archer  in his 57th year 
mourned his past and honoured it 
yes  hello  hello 
chicago wants you 
hello 
  dad 
  is that you  ted 
dad  i m just about finished out here 
but my client wants me to look
at some gardens before i start designing 
that sounds fine  where 
  europe 
  gracious 
i ll have to saii next wednesday
on the mauretania 
what  and miss the wedding 
i think annie will wait for me 
i ll be back on the 1st 
and our wedding s not till the 5th 
i m surprised you remember the date 
  well    dad  i was hoping you d join me 
  what 
i ll need you to remind me
of what s important 
what do you say 
it will be our last father and son trip 
  well  ted  i do appreciate the invitation   
  wonderful 
can you call the cunard office
first thing tomorrow 
but it would take me
till next wednesday just to cancel my   
i won t hear it  dad  the atlantic is calling us 
i ll be in new york on monday 
and i ll contact you then 
  you ll be in new   
  on monday 
i ll see what i can do 
settle the tickets  dad 
i can t promise anything  ted 
i ll see what i can do  all right 
  bye bye 
  bye 
i m going out to versailles with tourneur 
will you join us 
i thought i d go to the louvre 
i ll meet you there later then 
countess olenska s expecting us at 5 30 
what 
didn t i tell you 
annie made me swear
to do three things in paris 
get her the score of the last debussy songs 
go to the grand guignol 
and see madame olenska 
you know  she was awfully good to annie
when mr beaufort sent her over
to the sorbonne 
wasn t the countess friendly
with mr beaufort s first wife or something 
i think mrs beaufort said that she was 
in any case  i called the countess
first thing this morning 
introduced myself as her cousin 
did you tell her i was here  ted 
of course  why not 
she sounds lovely  was she 
lovely 
i don t know  she was different 
whenever he thought of ellen olenska 
it had been abstractly  serenely 
like an imaginary loved one
in a book or picture 
she had become the complete vision
of all that he had missed 
i m only 57 
did mr beaufort
really have such a bad time of it
when he wanted to remarry 
no one wanted to give him an inch 
perhaps because
he d already taken so much 
as if anyone remembers any more  or cares 
well  annie ring and he
did have a lovely daughter  you re very lucky 
we re very lucky  you mean 
yes  of course that s what i mean 
so considering how that all turned out 
and all the time that s gone by 
i don t see how you can resist 
i did have some resistance
at first to your marriage  as i told you   
no  i mean resist seeing the woman
you almost threw everything over for 
only you didn t 
i didn t 
no 
but mother said that she knew
  we would be safe with you 
  your mother 
yes  the day before she died
she asked to see me alone  remember 
she said she knew we were safe with you 
and always would be 
because once  when she asked you to 
you gave up the thing that you wanted most 
she never asked 
she never asked me 
after a little while
he did not regret ted s indiscretion 
it seemed to take an iron band
from his heart to know that 
after all  someone had guessed and pitied 
and that it should have been his wife
moved him inexpressibly 
the porter says it s the third floor 
must be the one with the awnings 
it s nearly 6 00 
i think i ll just sit for a while 
do you mean you won t come 
  you really won t come at all 
  i don t know 
she won t understand 
go on  ted  maybe i ll follow you 
what will i tell her 
don t you always have something to say 
i ll tell her you re old fashioned
