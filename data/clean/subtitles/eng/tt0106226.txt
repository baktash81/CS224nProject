parading her at the opera like that
sitting her next to may welland
its all very odd
well shes had such an odd life
will they even bring her
to the beauforts ball do you suppose
if they do the talk will be of little else
good evening mrs welland
good evening may
newland
you know my niece countess olenska
countess
i hope youve told madame olenska
what
that were engaged
i want everybody to know
let me announce it this evening at the ball
if you can persuade mamma
why should we change
what is already settled
but you can tell my cousin yourself
she remembers you
i remember we played together
how this brings it all back to me
i remember everybody here the same way
in knickerbockers and pantalettes
you were horrid
you kissed me once behind a door
but it was your cousin vandie the one
who never looked at me i was in love with
yes you have been away a very long time
centuries and centuries
so long im sure im dead and buried
and this dear old place is heaven
it invariably happened
as everything happened
in those days in the same way
as usuai mrs julius beaufort appeared
unaccompanied by her husband
just before the jewel song
and again as usuai rose at the end
of the third act and disappeared
new york then knew that a half hour later
the beauforts annual opera ball
would begin
carriages waited at the kerb
for the entire performance
it was widely known in new york
but never acknowledged
that americans want
to get away from amusement
even more quickly than they want to get to it
the beauforts house
was one of the few in new york
that possessed a ballroom
such a room
shuttered in darkness 364 days of the year
was felt to compensate
for whatever was regrettable
in the beaufort past
regina beaufort came
from an old south carolina family
but her husband julius
who passed for an englishman
was known to have dissipated habits
a bitter tongue and mysterious antecedents
his marriage assured him a sociai position
but not necessarily respect
newland archer had not stopped at his club
as young men usually did
but came directly to the beauforts
he wanted the announcement
of his engagement
to divert gossip away from the countess
and show his most ardent support
for may and her whole family
the beaufort house
had been boldly planned
instead of squeezing
through a narrow passage
to get to the ballroom
one marched solemnly
down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms
good evening
but only by actually passing
through the crimson drawing room
could one see the return of spring
the muchdiscussed nude by bouguereau
which beaufort had had the audacity
to hang in plain sight
good evening
good evening mr archer
archer enjoyed such challenges
to convention
he questioned conformity in private
but in public he upheld family and tradition
this was a world balanced so precariously
that its harmony could be shattered
by a whisper
on the whole archer was amused
by the smooth hypocrisies of his peers
he may even have envied them
lawrence lefferts for instance
was new yorks foremost authority on form
and his opinion on pumps
versus patentleather oxfords
had never been disputed
on matters of surreptitious romance
his skills went unquestioned
old mr sillerton jackson
was as great an authority on family
as lawrence lefferts was on form
the mean and melancholy history
of countess olenskas european marriage
was a buried treasure
he hastened to excavate
he carried like a calling card
an entire register
of the scandals and mysteries
that had smouldered
under the unruffled surface
of society for the last 50 years
julius beauforts secret was
the way he carried things off
he could arrive casually at his own party
as if he were another guest
and might also leave early for a more modest
but comforting address in the east 30s
beaufort was intrepid in his business
but in his personai affairs
absolutely audacious
archers fianc√©e was innocent
to all of these intrigues and of much else
may welland represented
for archer all that was best in their world
all that he honoured
and she anchored him to it
you see
ive told all my friends just as youve asked
yes i couldnt wait
only i wish it hadnt had to be at a ball
but even here were alone together
the worst of it is that
i want to kiss you and i cant
newland
did you tell ellen as i asked you to
no i didnt have the chance after all
shes my cousin newland
if others know before she does
its just that shes been away for so long
shes rather sensitive
of course ill tell her dearest
but i didnt see her yet
she decided not to come at the last minute
at the last minute
she was afraid her dress
wasnt smart enough
we all thought it was so lovely
but she asked my aunt to take her home
oh well
very handsome very liberal
in my time a cameo set in pearls
was thought to be sufficient
but its the hand that sets off the ring
isnt it my dear mr archer
its the new setting
it shows the stone beautifully
but it looks a little bare
to oldfashioned eyes
i hope you dont mean mine my dear
i like all the novelties
my hands were modelled
in paris by the great roche
he should do mays
show me child
her hand is so tempered
its these modern sports
that spread the joints but the skin is white
and whens the wedding to be
as soon as ever it can
if only youll back me up mrs mingott
we must give them time to get
to know each other a little better mamma
know each other
everybody in new york
has always known everybody
dont wait till the bubbles off the wine
marry them before lent
i may catch pneumonia any winter now
and i want to give the wedding breakfast
what a kind offer
even if she had not been grandmother
to may
mrs manson mingott
would still have been the first
to receive the required betrothai visit
she was not only the matriarch of this world
she was nearly its dowager empress
much of new york was already related to her
and she knew the remainder by marriage
or by reputation
though brownstone was the norm
she lived magisterially within a large house
of controversiai pale creamcoloured stone
in an inaccessible wilderness
near the central park
the burden of her flesh
had long since made it impossible
for her to go up and down stairs
so with characteristic independence
she had established herself
on the ground floor of her house
from her sitting room there was
an unexpected vista of her bedroom
her visitors were startled and fascinated
by the foreignness of this arrangement
which recalled scenes in french fiction
this was how women
with lovers lived in the wicked old societies
but if mrs mingott had wanted a lover
the intrepid woman would have had him too
for now she was content
simply for life and passion
to flow northward to her door
and to anticipate eagerly the union
of newland archer
with her granddaughter may
in them two of new yorks best families
would finally and momentously be joined
bye mamma
goodbye
ellen
ladies archer
aunt tessa may
beaufort this is a rare favour
unnecessarily rare id say
i met countess ellen in madison square
and she was good enough
to let me walk home with her
this house will be merrier
now that shes here
thank you
beaufort pull up that tuffet
this one
i want a good gossip
of course you already know
about may and me
she scolded me
for not telling you at the opera
of course i know and im so glad
one doesnt tell such news first in a crowd
careful there
dont let your ring catch on your sleeve
goodbye ellen
goodbye goodbye
goodbye
come and see me someday
its a mistake for ellen
to be seen parading up
fifth avenue with julius beaufort
at the crowded hour
the very day after her arrival
his behaviour is always so flagrant
even his wife must know about annie ring
sillerton jackson enjoyed his frequent visits
to the archer home
more than the actuai dining
newland archers mother
and his sister janey were both shy women
and shrank from society but they like
to be wellinformed of its doings
and doted on their bachelor friend
certain nuances escape beaufort
necessarily beaufort is a vulgar man
nevertheless no business nuances
escape him
most of new york trusts him with its affairs
my grandfather newland
always used to say to mother
dont let that fellow beaufort
be introduced to the girls
at least hes had the advantage
of association with gentlemen
the archers and the mingotts
were two of the sturdiest branches
of new yorks tangled family tree
granny mingotts family
could embrace mays traditionalism
and tolerate ellens unconventionality
but archers family held fast to the old ways
his mother and sister relied on him
for every security
he would always be
mrs archer assured mays mother
their strong right hand
and our new cousin
was she at the ball too
i appreciate the mingotts wanting
to support her to have her at the opera
i admire their esprit de corps
but why my sons engagement
should be mixed up
with this womans comings and goings
i dont see
well in any case she was not at the ball
at least she had that decency
sir
oh no
i wonder if she wears a round hat
or a bonnet in the afternoon
the dress she wore to the opera
was so plain and flat
im sure it was in better taste
not to go to the ball
it wasnt a question of taste mother
may said the countess decided
her dress wasnt smart enough
poor ellen
we must always remember
the eccentric bringingup she had
what can you expect of a girl
who was allowed to wear black satin
at her coming out ball
its odd she shouldve kept
such an ugly name as ellen
when she married the count
i should have changed it to elaine
why
i dont know it sounds more polish
it certainly sounds more conspicuous
and that can hardly be what she wishes
why not why shouldnt she
be conspicuous if she chooses
she made an awful marriage but should she
hide her head as if its her fault
should she go slinking around
as if she disgraced herself
shes had an unhappy life
that doesnt make her an outcast
im sure thats the line
the mingotts mean to take
i dont have to wait
for their cue if thats what you mean sir
im told shes looking for a house
she intends to live here
i hear she means to get a divorce
i hope she will
understandably her marriage was intolerable
but there are the rumours too
ive heard them the secretary
he helped get her away from the husband
they say the count kept her
practically a prisoner
certainly the count had his own way of life
you knew him
i heard of him at nice
handsome they say but
eyes with a lot of lashes
when he wasnt with women
he was collecting china
paying any price for both i understand
then wheres the blame
anyone of us under the same circumstances
would have helped the countess
just as the secretary did
he was still helping her a year later then
because somebody met them living together
at lausanne
living together
well why not who has the right
to make her life over if she hasnt
why should we bury a woman alive
if her husband prefers to live with whores
its hardly a question of entombment
the countess is here after all
or do you believe
a woman should share
the same freedoms as men
i suppose i do yes i do
well apparently count olenski
takes a similarly modern view
i never heard of him lifting a finger
to get his wife back
three days later the unthinkable happened
mrs manson mingott sent out invitations
summoning everyone to a formai dinner
such an occasion demanded
the most careful consideration
it required the appropriated plate
it called for three extra footmen
two dishes for each course
and a roman punch in the middle
the dinner new york read on the invitation
was to meet the countess olenska
and new york declined
regret unable to accept
and from some of our own family
no one cares enough even
to conceal their feelings about the countess
this is a disgrace
they all lived in a kind of
hieroglyphic world
the reai thing was never said
or done or even thought
but only represented
by a set of arbitrary signs
archer knew these signs
they were not subtle
and were not meant to be
they were more than a simple snubbing
they were an eradication
there was a single court of appeai
he would plead their case
before the van der luydens
and all this you think
is due to some intentional interference by
larry lefferts yes sir im certain of it
the van der luydens dwelled
above the citys families
in a kind of superterrestriai twilight
archer appealed to their exquisitely refined
sense of tribal order
and he spoke plainly
whenever poor gertrude lefferts begins
to suspect her husband of something
larry starts making some great diversionary
fuss to show how moral he is
well its the principle that i dislike
i mean to say
if a member of a wellknown family
is backed by that family
it should be considered final
we all felt this slight on the countess should
not pass without our consulting you
so we are giving a little dinner
for our cousin the duke of st austrey
who arrives next week on the russia
im sure louisa will be as glad as i am
if countess olenska
will let us include her among our guests
the occasion was a solemn one
but the countess olenska arrived rather late
signalling a carelessness
of which she was entirely unaware
she entered without haste or embarrassment
the drawing room
in which new yorks most chosen company
was somewhat awfully assembled
countess olenska
good evening
were delighted youre here
good evening
the duke of st austrey
may i present countess olenska
the trevenna george ll plate was out
so was the van der luyden lowestoft
from the east india company
and the dagonet crown derby
dining with the van der luydens
was at best no light matter
dining there with a duke
who was their cousin
was almost a religious solemnity
when the van der luydens chose
they knew how to give a lesson
excuse me
it was not the custom
in new york drawing rooms
for a lady to get up
and walk away from one gentleman
in order to seek the company of another
but the countess did not observe this rule
i want you to talk to me about may
you knew the duke before
from nice we used to see him every winter
hes very fond of gambling and he used
to come to our house a great deal
he likes to wear the same suit every evening
he thinks it brings him luck
i think hes the dullest man i ever met
but he seems to be admired here
may i tell you
what most interests me about new york
not all the blind obeying of tradition
somebody elses tradition
it seems stupid to have discovered america
only to make it a copy of another country
do you suppose christopher columbus
would have taken all that trouble
just to go to the opera with larry lefferts
well i think
if hed suspected that lefferts were here
the santa maria might never have left port
and may does she share these views
if she does shed never say so
are you very much in love with her
as much as a man can be
do you think theres a limit
if there is i havent found it
its really and truly a romance then
not in the least arranged
have you forgotten in our country
we dont allow our marriages to be arranged
yes i forgot im sorry
i sometimes make these mistakes
i dont always remember
that everything here is good
that was bad where i came from
im so sorry
no
but you know you are among friends here
yes i know thats why i came home
good evening louisa
may i present may welland
youll want to be with may
im so pleased to meet you
shes already surrounded
i have so many rivals
yes
then stay with me a little longer
yes
mr urban dagonet
may i present the countess olenska
how do you do my dear
how do you do
tomorrow then after 500 ill expect you
tomorrow
excuse me
it was good of you
to devote yourself to madame olenska
so unselfishly dear newland
i told henry he really must rescue you
i think ive never seen may looking lovelier
the duke thinks her the handsomest woman
in the room
it was my pleasure
mr archer
so how do you like this odd little house
to me its like heaven
youve arranged it delightfully
yes
some of the things
i managed to bring with me
little pieces of wreckage
at least its less gloomy
than the van der luydens
and not so difficult to be alone
i am sure its often thought
the van der luydens is gloomy
though ive never heard it said before
but tell me do you really like to be alone
as long as my friends
keep me from being lonely
i see youve already chosen your corner
yes
please sit
thank you
this is the hour i like best
dont you
i was afraid youd forgotten the hour
i am sure beaufort can be very intriguing
he took me to see some houses
im told i must move
even though this street
seems perfectly respectable
yes but its not fashionable
fashionable
is fashion such a serious consideration
among people
who have nothing more serious to consider
perhaps ive been too independent
all i really want is to feel cared for and safe
thank you
the van der luydens do nothing by halves
all new york laid itself out for you last night
it was so kind such a nice party
cream or lemon
lemon please
the van der luydens are the most powerful
influence in new york society
they very seldom receive
because of cousin louisas health
perhaps thats the reason then
thank you the reason
for their influence
they make themselves so rare
but of course you must tell me
no its you telling me
thank you
then we can both help each other
but i need help so much more
there are so many people all ready
to tell you what to do
i think theyre all a little angry with me
for setting up for myself
still your family can advise you
show you the way
is new york such a labyrinth
i thought it was all straight up and down
like fifth avenue
all the cross streets numbered
and big honest labels on everything
everything is labelled but everybody is not
then i must count on you for warnings too
all the older women like and admire you
they want to help
i know i know as long
as they dont hear anything unpleasant
does no one here want
to know the truth mr archer
the real loneliness
is living among all these kind people
who only ask you to pretend
no no you mustnt
madame olenska
ellen
does no one cry here either
i suppose theres no need to
mr archer good evening
we didnt see you this morning
and we werent sure whether
to send miss welland the usual
liliesofthevalley yes
i think we better make that a standing order
very good sir
and those yellow roses
ill give you another address
very good
george
mr archer two separate orders
theyll go at once
at once sir
its wonderful to wake every morning
with liliesofthevalley in my room
its like being with you
they came late yesterday i know
somehow the time got away from me
but still you always remember
i sent some roses to your cousin ellen too
was that right
very right
she didnt mention it at lunch today though
she said she got some wonderful orchids
from mr beaufort
and a whole hamper of carnations
from cousin henry van der luyden
she was so very delighted
dont people send flowers in europe
i know you do consider it a long time
very long
but the chiverses were engaged
for a year and a half
larry lefferts and gertrude
were engaged for two
im sure mamma expects
something customary
ever since you were little
your parents let you have your way
youre almost 22
just tell your mother what you want
i couldnt refuse her the very last thing
shed ask of me as a little girl
cant we just strike out for ourselves may
shall we elope
well if you would why not
you do love me newland im so happy
well why not be happier
i couldnt be happier dearest
did i tell you i showed ellen the ring
she thought it was
the most beautiful setting she ever saw
she said there was nothing like it
in the rue de la paix
i do love you newland
everything you do is so special
i want to call on your legai skills
for a rather delicate matter
countess olenska
wants to sue her husband for divorce
its been suggested she means
to marry again although she denies it
because of i beg your pardon sir
but because of my engagement
perhaps one of the other members of the firm
could consider this matter
but precisely
because of your prospective alliance
and considering that several members
of the family have already asked for you
id like you to consider the case
its a family matter
perhaps its best settled by the family
their position is clear
theyre entirely and rightly
against a divorce
but countess olenska still insists
on a legal opinion
but really whats the use of a divorce
shes here hes there
the whole atlantics between them
as things go olenskis acted generously
hes already returned
some of the money without being asked
shell never get a dollar more than that
although i understand
she attaches no importance to the money
considering all that the wisest thing really
is to do as the family say
just let well enough alone
i think thats for her to decide
have you considered the consequences
if the countess decides for divorce
the consequences for the countess
for everyone
i dont think the counts accusations amount
to anything more than vague charges
it will make for some talk
well i have heard talk
about the countess and the secretary
i heard it even before i read the legal papers
its certain to be unpleasant
unpleasant
divorce is always unpleasant
dont you agree
naturally
then i can count on you
the family can count on you
you will use your influence
against a divorce
i cant promise that
not until ive talked to the countess
i dont understand you mr archer
you want to marry into a family
with a scandalous divorce suit
hanging over it
i dont think that has anything to do
with the case
can someone take this for me
to the countess please
thank you
you refuse such an invitation
on threat of death
is it so bad
not if you have a taste for slow agony
thats something ive neglected to cultivate
three days at skuytercliff
with the van der luydens
i think you better take your fur
and a hot water bottle
is the house that cold
no but louisa is
mr archer
join me at delmonicos on sunday instead
im having a nice oyster supper
in your honour
private room congenial company
artists and so on
thats very tempting i havent met
a single artist since ive been here
i know one or two painters
i could bring to see you if youd allow me
painters
are there any painters in new york
thank you
but i was really thinking of singers
actors musicians dramatic artists
there were always so many
at my husbands house
may i write tomorrow and let you know
its too late to decide this evening
is this late
yes
because i still have
to talk business with mr archer
of course newland
if you can persuade the countess
to change her mind about sunday
you can join us too
you know painters then
you live in their milieu
not exactly
but you care about such things
immensely when im in paris or london
i never miss an exhibition
i try to keep up
i used to care immensely too
my life was full of such things
but now i want to cast off all my old life
to become a complete american
and try to be like everybody else
i dont think youll ever quite be
like everybody else
dont say that to me please
i just want to put
all the old things behind me
i know
mr letterblair told me
mr letterblair
yes ive come because he asked me to
im in the firm
you mean itll be you
wholl manage everything for me
i can talk to you thats so much easier
yes im here to talk about it
ive read all the legal papers
and the letter from the count
it was vile
but if he chooses to fight the case
he can say things that might be
that might be disagreeable to you
and say them publicly
so that they could be damaging even if
if
even if they were unfounded
what harm could accusations
like that do me here
perhaps more harm than anywhere else
our legislation favours divorce
but our social customs dont
never
well not if the woman
has appearances
in the least degree against her
has exposed herself
by any unconventional behaviour
to offensive insinuations and
yes so my family tell me
our family youll be my cousin soon
and you agree with them
what could you possibly gain
that would make up for the scandal
my freedom
but arent you free already
its my business
to help you see these things just the way
the people who are fondest of you see them
all your friends and relations
if i didnt show you honestly
how they judge such matters
it wouldnt be fair of me would it
no it wouldnt be fair
very well ill
do as you wish
i
i do want to help you
you do help me
good night cousin
for mercys sake dont cry so bitterly
forget what ive done
on one condition
i accept it whatever it may be
never speak a word of love to me again
never
on my honour
heaven bless you
farewell
its fascinating every season the same play
the same scene
the same effect on the audience
remarkable isnt it newland
im enjoying it even more
than the london production
you see this play even when you travel
i travel to get away from it
so was it a dinner
it was a reception at mrs struthers
given on the lords day but with champagne
and singing from the table tops
people say there was dancing
it was a real french sunday then
well dissipation can be
wonderfully energising in the early stages
do you think her lover will send her
a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning
i
i was thinking about that too
the farewell scene
yes i know
it touches me as well
i usually leave the theatre after that scene
to take the picture away with me
i had a letter from may from st augustine
they always spend the winter there
on account of her mothers bronchitis
and what do you do while may is away
i do my work
i do want you to know
what you advised me was right
things can be so difficult sometimes
and im so grateful
the next day newland archer
searched the city in vain
for yellow roses
from his office
he sent a note to madame olenska
asking to call that afternoon
and requesting reply by messenger
there was no reply that day or the next
and when yellow roses were again available
archer passed them by
it was only on the third day
that he heard from her by post
from the van der luydens country home
newland i ran away the day
after i saw you at the play
and these kind friends have taken me in
i wanted to be quiet and think things over
i feel so safe here
i wish that you were with us
yours sincerely
he had received an invitation
from the lefferts
for a weekend on the hudson
and he hoped it was not too late to reply
their house was not far
from the van der luydens
i came to see
what you were running away from
i knew youd come
that shows you wanted me to
cousin may wrote
she asked you to take care of me
i didnt need to be asked
why
does that mean
im so helpless and defenceless
or that women here are so blessed
they never feel need
what sort of need
please dont ask me
i dont speak your language
henry left the old patroon house open
for me i want you to see it
when you wrote me you were unhappy
yes but i cant feel unhappy
when youre here
i shant be here long
i know
ellen if you really wanted me to come
if im really to help you
you must tell me what youre running from
is he what you were running from
or what you expected
i didnt know he was here
hello beaufort this way
madame olenska was expecting you
hello
well youve certainly led me
on a bit of a chase
all this way just to tell you
id found the perfect little house for you
its not on the market yet
so you must take it at once
well archer rusticating
that night he did not take
the customary comfort
in his monthly shipment
of books from london
the taste of the usual
was like cinders in his mouth
and there were moments when he felt
as if he were being buried alive
under his future
newland come late tomorrow
i must explain to you
ellen
newland has anything happened
yes i found i had to see you
what is it
nothing
so tell me what you do all day
well there are a few very pleasant people
from philadelphia and baltimore
who are picnicking at the inn
and the merrys
are setting up a lawn tennis court
but nobody heres really heard
of the game yet
i have my racket of course
and so does kate merry
but shes had this terrible case of bronchitis
shes still not quite got over it yet so
but i thought
i came here because i thought
i could persuade you
to break away from all that
to advance our engagement
dont you understand
how much i want to marry you
why should we dream away another year
im not sure i do understand newland
is it because youre not certain
of feeling the same way about me
what on earth do you mean
is there someone else
someone else
between you and me
lets talk frankly newland
ive felt a difference in you
especially since our engagement
since our engagement
if its untrue
then it wont hurt to talk about it
and if it is true
then why shouldnt we talk about it now
i mean you might have made a mistake
if id made some sort of a mistake
would i be down here
asking you to hurry our marriage
i dont know you might
it would be one way to settle the question
in newport two years ago
before we were promised
everyone said
there was someone else for you
i even saw you with her once
sitting together on a veranda at a dance
when she came into the house
her face looked so sad
i felt sorry for her
and even after when we were engaged
i could still see how she looked and
is that
is that all youve been concerned about
its long passed
then is there something else
no of course not
whatever it may have been
newland i cant have my happiness
made out of a wrong to somebody else
if promises were made or if you feel
in some way pledged to this person
even if it means her getting a divorce
then newland
dont give her up because of me
there are no pledges
there are no promises that matter
thats all ive been trying to say
there is no one between us
there is nothing between us may
which is precisely my argument
for getting married
quickly
he could feei her dropping back
to inexpressive girlishness
her conscience had been eased
of its burden
it was wonderfui he thought
how such depths of feeling
could coexist
with such an absence of imagination
and did you succeed
no
no id still like to be married in april
with your help
now youre seeing the mingott way
is this really so difficult
the entire family is difficult
not one of them wants to be different
when they are different
they end up like ellens parents
nomads continental wanderers
dragging ellen about
lavishing on her an expensive
but incoherent education
out of all of them i dont believe theres one
that takes after me but my little ellen
youve got a quick eye
why in the world didnt you marry her
well for one thing
she wasnt there to be married
no to be sure
and shes still not the count you know
hes written to mr letterblair
he wants her back on her own terms
the count doesnt defend himself
i will say that
and ellen will be losing a great deal
if she stayed here
theres her old life
gardens at nice
jewels of course music and conversation
she says she goes unnoticed in europe
but i know her portraits
been painted nine times
all this and the remorse of a guilty husband
id rather see her dead
would you really
we should remember marriage is marriage
and ellen is still a wife
ellen see whos here
yes i know
i went to see your mother
to ask where youve gone
since you never answered my note
i was afraid you might be ill
well he was in such a rush to get married
thats why
fresh off the train and straight here
he wants me to use all my influence
just to marry his sweetheart sooner
well surely granny between us
we can persuade the wellands
to do as he wishes
there newland you see
right to the quick of the problem like me
i told him he should have married you
and what did he say
oh my darling
i leave you to find that out
i wish i didnt have to leave
i shall see you very soon i hope
fine
ill see you out
when can i see you
the struthers
are sending the carriage at 700
good evening
whos ridiculous enough
to send me a bouquet
im not going to a ball and im not engaged
nastasia
some people are always ridiculous
take these to that nice family
down the street
well ill tell you
in almost everything she says
theres something true
and something untrue
why what has granny been telling you
i think she believes
you might go back to your husband
i think she believes
you might at least consider it
a lot of things have been believed of me
but if she thinks i would consider it
that also means she would consider it for me
as granny is weighing your idea
of advancing the marriage
may and i had a frank talk in florida
its probably our first
she wants a long engagement
to give me time
time for what
she thinks i want to marry her at once
to get away from someone that i care for
more
time to give her up for another woman
if i want to
thats very noble
yes
but its ridiculous
why
because there is no other woman
no
because i dont mean to marry anyone else
this other woman does she love you too
there is no other woman
the person may was thinking of was never
that must be your carriage
yes i
i suppose i should be leaving soon
to mrs struthers
yes i must go where im invited
or i should be too lonely
why not come with me
may guessed the truth
there is another woman
only not the one she thinks
dont make love to me
too many people have done that
ive never made love to you
but you are the woman i wouldve married
if it had been possible for either of us
you can say that when youre the one
whos made it impossible
ive made it
isnt it you who made me give up divorcing
didnt you talk to me here in this house
about sacrifice and sparing scandal
and for mays sake and for yours
i did what you asked me
there were things in your husbands letter
i had nothing to fear from that letter
absolutely nothing
i was just afraid of scandal
for the family and you and may
ellen
ellen
nothings
nothings done that cant be undone
im still free
you can be too
please ellen
lord can i marry may now
do you see me marrying may now
i dont see you putting that question to may
do you
but i have to
its too late to do anything else
you say that because its the easiest thing
to say at this moment
not because its true
i dont understand you
you dont understand
because you dont yet realise
how youve changed things for me
you dont know all that youve done
all ive done
all the good things youve done for me
newland that i never knew
going to the van der luydens
because people refused to meet me
announcing your engagement at the ball
so there would be
two families standing behind me
instead of one
i never understood
how dreadful people thought i was
granny blurted it out one day
i was stupid i never thought
new york meant freedom to me
everyone seemed so kind
and glad to see me
but they never knew
what it meant to be tempted
but you did you understood
id never known that before
and its better than anything ive known
newland you couldnt be happy
if it meant being cruel
if we act any other way
ill be making you act
against what i love in you most
and i cant go back to that way of thinking
dont you see
i cant love you unless i give you up
ellen grannys telegram was successful
grandma and mamma agreed
to marriage after easter only a month
i will telegraph newland
im too happy for words and love you dearly
your grateful cousin may
there had been wild rumours
right up to the wedding day
that mrs mingott
would actually attend the ceremony
it was known that she had sent a carpenter
to measure the front pew
in case it might be altered
to accommodate her
but this idea like the great lady herself
proved to be unwieldy
and she settled
for giving the weddingbreakfast
the countess olenska sent her regrets
she was travelling with an aunt
but gave the bride and groom
an exquisite piece of old lace
two elderly aunts in rhinebeck
offered a honeymoon cottage
and since it was thought very english
to have a country house on loan
their offer was accepted
when the house
proved suddenly uninhabitable however
henry van der luyden
stepped in to offer an old cottage
on his property nearby
may accepted the offer
as a surprise for her husband
shed never seen the house
but her cousin ellen had mentioned it once
she had said it was the only house
in america
where she could imagine
being perfectly happy
they travelled to the expected places
which may had never seen
in london archer ordered his clothes
and they went to the national gallery
and sometimes to the theatre
i hope i dont look ridiculous
ive never dined out in london
english women dress just like
everybody else in the evening dont they
how can you say that
when theyre always at the theatre
in old ball dresses and bare heads
well maybe they save their new dresses
for home
then i shouldnt have worn this
no you look very fine
really quite beautiful
in paris she ordered her clothes
there were trunks of dresses from worth
they visited the tuileries
mays hands were modelled in marble
at roches studio
and occasionally they dined out
but tell me you were saying that you were
actually advised here by maupassant
yes unfortunately
i was advised not to write
archer embraced his new marriage
even as he reverted
to his old inherited ideas about matrimony
it was less trouble to conform with tradition
there was no use trying to emancipate a wife
who hadnt the dimmest notion
that she was not free
when we were in london
we could only manage one day
at the national
we were taken up
by a mrs carfry and mrs harle
we had an awfully good talk
hes an interesting fellow
we talked about books
and many different things
i thought id invite him to dinner
the frenchman
yes
i didnt have much chance to talk to him
but wasnt he a little common
common
i thought he was clever
i suppose i shouldnt have known
if he was clever
then i wont ask him to dine
with a chill he knew that in future
many problems
would be solved for him in this same way
the first six months of marriage
were usually said to be the hardest
and after that he thought they would have
pretty nearly finished
polishing down all the rough edges
but mays pressure
was already wearing down
the very roughness he most wanted to keep
as for the madness with madame olenska
archer trained himself to remember it
as the last of his discarded experiments
she remained in his memory
simply as the most plaintive
and poignant of a line of ghosts
shes very deft
yes well
thats the only kind of target shell ever hit
no one could ever be jealous
of mays triumphs
she managed
to give the feeling that she would have been
just as serene without them
but what if all her calm her niceness
were just a negation
a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness
archer felt
he had never yet lifted that curtain
quite stunning isnt it
its julius beaufort
who donates the clubs prizes isnt it
this looks like him of course
it will make quite an heirloom my dear
you should leave it to your eldest daughter
whats the matter arent there going
to be any daughters only sons
what cant i say that either
look at her blushing
ellen ellen are you upstairs
shes over from portsmouth
spending the day with me
its such a nuisance
she just wont stay in newport
insists on putting up with those
whats their names blenkers
but i gave up arguing
with young people 50 years ago ellen
im sorry maam
miss ellens not in the house
shes left
i saw her going down the shore path
run down and fetch her
like a good grandson
may and i
will have a gossip about julius beaufort
go ahead
i know shell want to see you both
is it true beaufort
has given annie ring a diamond bracelet
i hear he even plans to bring her to newport
he had heard her name often enough
during the year and a half
since they had last met
he was even familiar
with the main incidents of her life
but he heard
all these accounts with detachment
as if listening
to reminiscences of someone longdead
but the past
had come again into the present
as in those newlydiscovered caverns
in tuscany
where children had lit bunches of straw
and seen old images staring from the wall
he gave himself a single chance
she must turn before the sailboat
crosses the lime rock light
then he would go to her
im sorry you didnt find her
but ive heard shes so changed
changed
so indifferent to her old friends
summering in portsmouth
moving to washington
sometimes i think weve always bored her
i wonder if she wouldnt be happier
with her husband after all
i dont think
ive ever heard you be cruel before
cruel
even demons
dont think people are happier in hell
then she shouldnt have married abroad
here let me go on walk on
the blenkers a party for the blenkers
who are they
the portsmouth people i think
the ones countess olenska is staying with
professor and mrs emerson sillerton
request the pleasure wednesday afternoon
at 300 oclock punctually
to meet mrs and the misses blenker
red gables catherine street
i dont think we can decline
i dont see why really hes an archaeologist
and hes sillerton jacksons cousin
of course
some of us will have to go
ill go over
and janey why dont you come with me
im sure cousin ellen will be there
it will give you a chance to see her
newland you can find a way
to spend your afternoon cant you
i think for a change
ill just save it instead of spending it
maybe ill drive to the farm
to see about a new horse for the brougham
well at least the jacksons didnt choose
the day of the cup race for their party
of course
i shouldnt be surprised if they had
hello
im sorry did you ring
ive been asleep in the hammock
well i didnt mean to disturb you
are you miss blenker im newland archer
yes ive heard so much about you
i came to the island to look for a new horse
i thought id call
but the house seems to be empty
it is empty theyre all at the party
everyones there but me with my fever
and countess olenska
you found my parasol
its my best one its from the cameroons
well its very pretty
the countess was called away
yes a telegram came from boston
she said she might be gone for two days
i do love
the way she does her hair dont you
it reminds me of sir walter scott
you dont know im sorry
but i have to be in boston tomorrow
you wouldnt happen to know
where she was staying
ellen
im here on business
i just got here actually
youre doing your hair differently
only because my maids not with me
she stayed back in portsmouth im here only
for two days it didnt seem worthwhile
you are travelling alone
yes
why do you think its a little dangerous
well its unconventional
yes i suppose it is
ive just done
something so much more unconventional
i refused
to take back money that belonged to me
someone came with an offer
what were the conditions
i refused
tell me the conditions
nothing unbearable really
just to sit at the head
of his table now and then
and he wants you back at any price
well its a considerable price
at least its considerable for me
so you came to see him
my husband here no of course not
no he sent someone
his secretary
yes
hes still here in fact
he insisted on waiting
in case i changed my mind
you havent changed newland
i had changed until i saw you again
please dont
just give me the day
ill say anything you like or nothing
i wont speak unless you tell me to
all i want is some time with you
i want to get you away from that man
is he coming to hotel
at 1100
well lets go now
ill have to leave a note at the hotel
write on this i have the paper
you see how everything is predestined
and these have you seen these
the new stylographic pen
its just like
its like jerking down the mercury
in a thermometer now
try that
its not working
that should do it
shall i take it in
ill be only a moment
why didnt you come down to the beach
to get me the day i was at grannys
because you didnt turn around i swore
i swore i wouldnt call you
unless you turned around
but i didnt look around on purpose
you knew
i recognised the carriage when you drove in
so i went to the beach
to get as far away from me as you could
as i could yes
well you see its no use
its better if we face each other
i only want to be honest with you
honest isnt that why
you always admired julius beaufort
he was more honest than the rest
of us wasnt he weve no character
no colour no variety
i dont know
why you dont just go back to europe
i believe thats because of you
me
im the man who married one woman
because another one told him to
you promised not to say such things today
i cant keep that promise
what about may what about how may feels
if youre using my marriage
as some victory of ours
then theres really no reason on earth
why you shouldnt go back
you gave me my first glimpse of a real life
and then you told me
to carry on with a false one
no one can endure that
im enduring it
whats the use i know youll go back
i wont not yet
not as long as we both can stand it
this is not a life for you
it is as long as its part of yours
you wont go back
i wont go back
he would see her again
at the theatre or a reception
perhaps he might be seated next to her
perhaps they might
have another time alone somewhere
but he could not live without seeing her
mr archer i think
yes
my name is riviere
i dined with you in paris last year
yes im sorry i didnt quite recall
quite all right i had the advantage
i saw you in boston yesterday
i came here on count olenskis behalf
because i believed in all good faith
that she should return to him
forgive me
forgive me monsieur
but i really dont understand your purpose
in coming to see me
shes changed monsieur
you knew her before
i used to see her
at her husbands house yes
well the count would not
have entrusted my mission to a stranger
this change that you mentioned
it may only have been my seeing her
for the first time
as she is as an american
she made her marriage in good faith
it was a faith the count could not share
could not understand
so her faith was
detruit
broken destroyed
destroyed
returning to europe
would mean a life of some comfort
and considerable sacrifice
and i would think no hope
i will of course
fulfil my obligation to the count
and meet with the family
i will tell them everything that he suggests
and wishes for the countess
but i would ask you to use your influence
with them
i beg you monsieur do not let her go back
when old mrs baxter pennilow died
they found her standing order
48 worth dresses
still wrapped in tissue paper
when her daughters left off their mourning
they wore the first lot to the symphony
without looking in advance of the fashion
he had written to her once in washington
just a few lines asking
when they would meet again
and she wrote back not yet
and even that had the front panel changed
no i think it was julius beaufort
who started the new fashion
by making his wife clap her new clothes
on her back as soon as they arrived
i must say it takes
all reginas distinction not to look like
her rivals
like that annie ring
careful dear
everybody knows
indeed
beaufort always put his business around
and now that his business is gone
there are bound to be disclosures
gone is it really that bad
as bad as anything i ever heard of
most everybody we know will be hit
one way or another
very difficult for regina of course
and its a pity
its certainly a pity that countess olenska
refused her husbands offer
why for gods sake
well to put it on the lowest ground
whats she going to live on now
live on
i mean now that beaufort
what the hell does that mean sir
most of her moneys invested with beaufort
and the allowance shes been getting
from the family is so cut back
im sure she has something
i would think a little
whatever remains after sustaining more debt
i know the family paid close attention
to monsieur riviere
and considered the counts offer
very carefully
if everyone had rather
she be beauforts mistress
than some decent fellows wife
youve all gone about it perfectly
she wont go back
thats your opinion eh
well no doubt you know
i suppose she might still soften
catherine mingott
who could give her
any allowance she chooses
but the rest of the family have no particular
interest in keeping her here
theyll simply let her
find her own level
evening sir
thank you martin
that lamp is smoking again
the servant should see to it
im sorry
i may have to go to washington
for a few days
when
tomorrow im sorry
i should have said it before
on business
on business of course
theres a patent case
coming up before the supreme court
i just got the papers from letterblair
it seems that he intended
never mind it sounds too complicated
i have enough trouble managing this lamp
let me try that
but the change will do you good
and you must be sure to go and see ellen
excuse me maam
but this came for you while you were out
do something about this will you alice
certainly sir
grannys had a stroke
a stroke
ridiculous
i told them all
it was just an excessive thanksgiving
dr bencomb acted most concerned
and insisted on notifying everyone
as if it were the last reading of my will
and testament
youre very dear to come
but perhaps you only wanted to see
what id left you
granny thats shocking
it was shock that did this to me
no its all due to regina beaufort
she came here last night
and she asked me
she asked me she had the effrontery
to ask me to back julius
not to desert him she said
to stand behind our common lineage
in the townsend family
if you back julius
you can see the family through
if you dont
we will all
every one of us fall into dishonour
i said to her
honours always been honour
and honestys always been honesty
in manson mingotts house
and will be till im carried out feetfirst
and then she said if you can believe this
but my name auntie
but my name auntie
my names regina townsend
and i said to her
your name was beaufort
when he covered you with jewels
and its got to stay beaufort
now that hes covered you with shame
and then i gave out
simply gave out
and now family is arriving from all over
expecting a funeral
and theyll have to be entertained
i dont know
how many notes bencomb sent out
if theres anything we can do to help out
well my ellen is coming
i expressly asked for her
she arrives this afternoon on the train
if you could fetch her
of course if may will send the brougham
ill take the ferry
fine fine thank you
there you see granny
everyone will be settled
thank you dear bless you
i didnt want to worry granny
but how can you meet ellen
and bring her back here
if you have to go
to washington yourself this afternoon
im not going the case is off postponed
i heard from letterblair this morning
postponed how odd
mama had a note
from him this morning as well
he was concerned about granny
but had to be away
he was arguing a big patent case
before the supreme court
you did say it was a patent case didnt you
well thats it the whole office cant go
letterblair decided to go himself
so then its not postponed
no but my going is
he knew it was two hours by ferry
and carriage from the pennsylvania terminus
in jersey city back to mrs mingotts
all of two hours
and maybe a little more
you didnt expect me today
no
i nearly came to washington to see you
we would have missed each other
it was granny mingott who sent me
shes much better
you know i hardly remembered you
hardly remembered
i mean i mean each time is the same
you happen to me all over again
yes i know
for me too
ellen we cant stay like this it cant last
i think we should look at reality not dreams
i just want us to be together
i cant be your wife newland
is it your idea i should live with you
as your mistress
i want
somehow i want to get away with you
and find a world
where words like that dont exist
oh my dear
where is that country
have you ever been there
is there anywhere we can be happy
behind the backs of people who trust us
im beyond caring about that
no youre not
youve never been beyond that
i have
i know what it looks like its no place for us
why are
why are we stopping this isnt grannys
no ill get out here
you were right i shouldnt have come today
what are you reading
its a book about japan
why
i dont know
because its a different country
you used to read poetry
it was so nice when you read it to me
newland
youll catch your death
of course
but then he realised i am dead
ive been dead for months and months
then it occurred to him that she might die
people did
young people healthy people did
she might die and set him free
newland
ellen i have to see you
i didnt know when you were leaving again
im im not leaving
grannys asked me to stay
and take care of her
then we have to talk now
im due at regina beauforts
granny lent me her carriage
i know granny says julius beaufort
is a scoundrel
but so is my husband and the family still
want me to go back to him
only granny understands
shes even seen to my allowance
i have to see you
somewhere we can be alone
in new york
alone somewhere we can be alone
the art museum in the park 230 tomorrow
ill be at the door
you came to new york
because you were afraid
afraid
of my coming to washington
i thought i would be safer
safer from me
ellen
s
safer from loving me
shall i come to you once and then go home
come to me once then
when
tomorrow
the day after
im sorry im late
you werent worried were you
is it late
its past 700
i stayed at grannys
because cousin ellen came in
we had a wonderful talk
she was so dear just like the old ellen
granny was so charmed by her
but you can see though how the familys
been annoyed with her at times
going to see regina beaufort
in grannys carriage and
are we dining out tonight
you havent kissed me today
it was the custom in old new york
for brides to appear in their wedding dress
during the first year or two of marriage
but may since returning from europe
had not worn her bridal satin
untii this evening
may im sorry my heads bursting
please dont tell anyone
come home with me now
shouldnt you rest
my heads not as bad as that
and theres something important
i have to say to you right away
may there is something
that ive got to tell you
about myself
madame olenska
why should we talk about ellen tonight
because i should have spoken before and
is it really worthwhile dear
i know ive been unfair to her at times
perhaps we all have
youve understood her better
than any of us i suppose
but does it really matter
now that its all over
how do you mean over
why since shes going back
to europe so soon
grannys approved and understands
shes disappointed of course
but shes arranged to make ellen
financially independent of the count
i i thought you would have heard today
at your offices
its impossible
impossible
certainly she could have stayed here
with grannys extra money
but i guess shes given us up after all
how do you know that
from ellen
i told you i saw her at grannys yesterday
and she told you that yesterday
no she sent me a note this afternoon
do you want to see it
i thought you knew
may dear
i have at last made granny understand
that my visit
to her could be no more than a visit
and she has been as kind
and generous as ever
and she has been as kind
and generous as ever
she sees now that if i return to europe
i must live by myself
i am hurrying back to washington
to pack up and i saii next week
you be must very good to granny
when im gone
as good as youve always been to me
if any of my friends wish to urge me
to change my mind
please tell them it would be utterly useless
tell them it would be utterly useless
why did she write this
i suppose
because we talked things over yesterday
what things
i told her that i was afraid
i hadnt always been fair to her
that i hadnt always understood
how hard it must have been for her here
i knew youd be the one friend she could
always count on and i wanted her to know
that you and i were the same
in all of our feelings
she understood why i wanted to tell her this
i think she understands everything
my head aches too
good night dear
good night
it was as mrs archer said to mrs welland
a great event
for a young couple to give their first dinner
and it was not to be undertaken lightly
there was a hired chef
two borrowed footmen
roses from hendersons
roman punch and menus
on giltedged cards
it was considered a particular triumph
that the van der luydens
at mays request
stayed in the city to be present
at her farewell dinner
for the countess olenska
you have to leave new york
after the disgrace
archer saw all the harmlesslooking people
at the table as a band of quiet conspirators
with himself
and ellen the centre of their conspiracy
he guessed himself
to have been for months the centre
of countless silently observing eyes
and patiently listening ears
he understood that somehow the separation
between himself and the partner of his guilt
had been achieved
and he knew that now the whole tribe
had rallied around his wife
he was a prisoner
in the centre of an armed camp
i wonder if theyll ever get it back
reginas not well at all
but that doesnt stop beaufort
from devoting as much time
to annie ring as he can manage
the best thing beaufort could do
would be to go and stay
at reginas little place in north carolina
he could breed trotters
and the key to his release
had been returned the day before
by maii unopened
he may stay here as a deliberate challenge
to the outrage hes created
perhaps hell run for public office
then will annie ring be his first lady
was your trip from washington very tiring
the heat on the train was dreadful
but all travel has its hardships
well whatever they may be
theyre worth it just to get away
i mean to do a lot of travelling myself soon
what about you philip
what about a little adventure
athens and smyrna
maybe even constantinople
possibly possibly
but not naples
dr bencomb says theres a fever
really a fever in naples
well theres always india of course
you must have three weeks
to do india properly
absolutely
beaufort may not receive
invitations any more
but its clear
he still maintains a certain position
horizontal from all ive heard
if things go on like this
well be seeing our children
fighting for invitations to swindlers houses
and marrying beauforts bastards
has he got any
be careful there gentlemen
draw it mild draw it mild
society has a history
of tolerating vulgar women after all
up to a point
but once it tolerates a man of that kind
the only prospect is total disinheritance
have you ever noticed
its the people with the worst cooks
who are always yelling
about being poisoned when they dine out
lefferts used to be
a little more adept i thought
but then grace is not always required
as long as one knows the steps
ive never heard lefferts so abound
in the sentiments
that adorn christian manhood
indignation lends a scathing eloquence
its almost as effective as fear
the pressure at home must be unrelenting
i never expected to hear
such a paean to the sanctity
my mother had a bronze reduction
of the venus de milo she wanted to give us
the silent organisation
which held this whole small world together
was determined to put itself on record
it had never for a moment questioned
the propriety of madame olenskas conduct
it had never questioned archers fidelity
and it had never heard of
suspected or even conceived possible
anything at all to the contrary
ellen
from the seamless performance of this rituai
archer knew that new york
believed him to be madame olenskas lover
we were discussing
the martha washington ball
yes we have it during easter week
to benefit the blind society
they do excellent work
lawrence lawrence
and he understood for the first time
that his wife shared the belief
you must come visit me when you do
ill write you as soon as im settled
and let you know where i am
yes that would be lovely
shall i see you to your carriage
we are driving dear ellen home
goodbye
goodbye
and ill see you very soon in paris
if you and may could come
shall we make our way
to the carriage my dear
delightful evening newland
good night newland
good night sillerton good night larry
it did go off beautifully didnt it
yes
may i come in and talk it over
of course but you must be very sleepy
no im not id like to be with you a little
fine
if you feel up to it may
there is something
that ive been wanting to talk to you about
and i tried to talk to you the other evening
yes dear something about yourself
about myself yes
its so difficult to find the right words
but its just that
i feel so terribly tired at the moment
and i think
each day a little more so
and i think it would be better for everyone
if i were to make a break
you mean give up the law
well certainly that would be a part of it
and also just to
just to get away
i id like to do some travelling
to europe or
perhaps even farther
how far
i dont know i thought
india or japan
as far as that
well
im afraid you cant dear
not unless you take me with you
that is if the doctors will let me go
and im afraid they wont
newland ive been sure of something
since this morning
and ive been longing to tell you
oh my dear
you didnt guess
no i mean of course i i hoped but
have you told anyone else
only mamma and your mother
and ellen
i told you we had a long talk one afternoon
and how wonderful she was to me
did you mind my telling her newland
mind why should i
but that was two weeks ago wasnt it
i thought you just said
you werent sure till today
no i i wasnt sure then
but i told her i was
and you see i was right
it was the room
in which most of the reai things
of his life had happened
their eldest boy theodore
too delicate to be taken to church
in midwinter
had been christened there
i baptise thee in the name of the father
and of the son
and of the holy spirit
it was here that ted took his first steps
and it was here that archer
and his wife always discussed
the future of all their children
bills interest in archaeology
marys passion for sports and philanthropy
teds inclination toward art
that led to a job with an architect
as well as some considerable redecoration
it was in this room
that mary had announced her engagement
im so happy for you
to the dullest and most reliable
of larry lefferts many sons
and it was in this room too
that her father had kissed her
through her wedding veii
before they motored to grace church
he was a dutifui and loving father
and a faithful husband
when may died of infectious pneumonia
after nursing bill safely through
he had honestly mourned her
the world of her youth had fallen into pieces
and rebuilt itself without her ever noticing
this hard bright blindness
her incapacity to recognise change
made her children conceal their views
from her just as archer concealed his
she died thinking the world a good place
full of loving
and harmonious households like her own
newland archer in his 57th year
mourned his past and honoured it

im going out to versailles with tourneur

i thought id go to the louvre
ill meet you there later then
countess olenskas expecting us at 530
what
didnt i tell you
annie made me swear
to do three things in paris
get her the score of the last debussy songs
go to the grand guignol
and see madame olenska
you know she was awfully good to annie
when mr beaufort sent her over
to the sorbonne
wasnt the countess friendly
with mr beauforts first wife or something
i think mrs beaufort said that she was
in any case i called the countess
first thing this morning
introduced myself as her cousin
did you tell her i was here ted
of course why not
she sounds lovely was she
lovely
i dont know she was different
whenever he thought of ellen olenska
it had been abstractly serenely
like an imaginary loved one
in a book or picture
she had become the complete vision
of all that he had missed
im only 57
did mr beaufort
really have such a bad time of it
when he wanted to remarry
no one wanted to give him an inch
perhaps because
hed already taken so much
as if anyone remembers any more or cares
well annie ring and he
did have a lovely daughter youre very lucky
were very lucky you mean
yes of course thats what i mean
so considering how that all turned out
and all the time thats gone by
i dont see how you can resist
i did have some resistance
at first to your marriage as i told you
no i mean resist seeing the woman
you almost threw everything over for
only you didnt
i didnt
no
but mother said that she knew
we would be safe with you
your mother
yes the day before she died
she asked to see me alone remember
she said she knew we were safe with you
and always would be
because once when she asked you to
you gave up the thing that you wanted most
she never asked
she never asked me
after a little while
he did not regret teds indiscretion
it seemed to take an iron band
from his heart to know that
after all someone had guessed and pitied
and that it should have been his wife
moved him inexpressibly
the porter says its the third floor
must be the one with the awnings
its nearly 600
i think ill just sit for a while
do you mean you wont come
you really wont come at all
i dont know
she wont understand
go on ted maybe ill follow you
what will i tell her
dont you always have something to say
ill tell her youre oldfashioned
