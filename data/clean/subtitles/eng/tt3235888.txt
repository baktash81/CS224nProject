annie 
dad 
hey 
i love you 
i know

i just wanted you and mom
to know how much i love you 
dad  i m sorry i can be such
a shit to you sometimes 
i don t know why i do that

i love you  ok 
i just really love you both 
hey  jay 
hey  what s up 
nothing 
paul and yara are here 
we re gonna watch a movie 
if you feel like it 
actually 
i m going out tonight 
that guy 
i like him 
me  too 
i see you 
you will have access to
advanced information 
relative to the time and strength
of the forthcoming atomic tests 
what about it 
you will provide us with that
information as soon as it is available 
i see 
you re afraid of an overload 
you can t tap enough electricity
wherever you get it from to control   
a strong enough charge 
you are a clever man  doctor 
perhaps too clever 
and what makes you think
i ll give you any information 
it is the only way you can save
your own life when the time comes 
you will be transported to one
of our platforms in space   
what are you reading 
the idiot 
is it any good 
i don t know yet 
it s about paul 
hey  jay 
hey  paul 
stop 
hey  i have an idea 
what 
it got away 
you ever play the trade game 
no  what is that 
it s a people watching game 
my sister and i used
to play it when we were bored 
you re bored right now 
no  shut up 
let me finish 
ok  how do you play 
you start by watching the crowd 
casually scope out
the people around you 
ok 
now without telling me 
pick a person you d want
to trade places with 
it can be anyone
for whatever reason 
ok  i got it 
now i get two guesses
to figure out
who you picked
and why you want to
trade places with them 
ok  good luck 
that guy 
nope 
ok then 
who d you pick 
him 
the dad 
no  the son 
i mean how cool would that be
to have your whole life ahead of you 
you know 
come on 
it s not like you re old 
you re 21 
i know  but   
look how happy that kid is 
plus  at that age you could
go to the bathroom
any time time you want 
  total freedom 
  yeah 
he s probably taking a shit right now 
yeah  exactly 
i can never get away with that 
ok  my turn 
ok 
ok  got it 
how about the girl
in the yellow dress 
where 
right there 
i don t see her 
right there 
are you teasing me 
i m sorry  i just    i don t   
i don t see who you re talking about 
can we go 
i m sorry  i just 
i just don t feel well 
can we  can we go
back to the car 
is there someone in there
that made you want to leave 
like an ex girlfriend or something 
you said you saw a girl
with a yellow dress 
is that someone that you knew 
no  i just felt sick 
i feel better being outside 
thanks for walking with me 
mom knows you smoke 
yeah  but she ll cry if she
actually sees it happening 
or she ll just steal your cigarettes 
how s it going with hugh 
good 
mostly 
i don t know  he was acting
kind of weird last night 
why 
he said he wasn t
feeling well but   
it seemed like
something was on his mind 
have you   
  no 
  no 
i know he wants to  but   
i don t know  it seemed
different last night 
do i smell bad 
like  uh  cherry coke 
banana nicotine 
that s my favorite flavor 
mom will love it 
let s go back to the car 
it s funny 
we used to daydream about being
old enough to go on dates  and
drive around with friends
in their cars 
i had this image of myself
holding hands with a
really cute guy 
listening to the radio   
driving along some pretty road
up north maybe 
and the trees started to change colors 
it s never about going anywhere really 
just having some sort
of freedom  i guess 
now that we re old enough 
where the hell do we go 
jay 
you awake 
i m sorry 
what are you doing 
i m not gonna hurt you 
don t worry 
you re not gonna believe me 
but i need you to remember
what i m saying 
ok 
this thing   
   it s gonna follow you 
somebody gave it to me
and i passed it to you
back in the car 
it could look like
someone you know
or it could be a stranger in a crowd 
whatever helps it
get close to you 
it can look like anyone
but there s only one of it 
help 
help 
sometimes 
sometimes i think it looks like
people you love
just to hurt you 
i see it 
i see it 
who is it 
you get rid of it 
ok 
just sleep with someone
as soon as you can 
just pass it along 
if it kills you 
it ll come after me 
do you understand 
what the fuck do you want 
jay 
i m doing this to help you 
just so you know it s real 
help 
help me 
never go into a place that
doesn t have more than one exit 
it s very slow 
but it s not dumb 
can i have some 
yeah 
listen to this 
 i think that if one is faced by
inevitable destruction 
if a house is falling
upon you  for instance 
one must feel a great
longing to sit down 
close one s eyes and wait 
come what may  
that s why we re
drinking on the porch 
is your mom asleep already 
almost for sure 
she wakes up at 5 15 
that would kill me 
so 
where s jay at 
on a date 
your turn 
who is he 
somebody new 
of course 
your sister s so pretty 
it s annoying 
it is annoying 
well  at least she s nice 
is everything ok 
just don t let it touch you 
jay 
what happened 
i don t know 
those people are such a mess 
it was consensual 
yeah 
and you ve never seen
the woman before 
no 
ok 
have you ever been to his home 
i know where it is  but
i ve never been inside 
he said he was embarrassed
of where he lived 
did she catch anything 
i don t think so 
oh  poor jamie 
apparently  he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city 
the police searched the place 
they can t find him 
oh  my god 
breaks my heart 
the things he said to her 
so weird and sick 
 i should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across floors of silent seas 
and the afternoon  the evening 
sleeps so peacefully 
smoothed by long fingers 
asleep    tired    or it malingers 
stretched out on the floor 
here beside you and me 
should i  after tea and cakes and ices 
have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis 
but though i have wept and fasted 
wept and prayed 
though i have seen my head 
grown slightly bald 
brought in upon a platter 
i am no prophet
and here s no great matter 
i have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker 
and i have seen the eternal footman
hold my coat  and snicker 
and in short  i was afraid 
and would it have been worth it  after all 
after the cups  the marmalade  the tea 
among the porcelain 
among some talk of you and me 
would it have been worthwhile
to have bitten off the matter with a smile 
to have squeezed the universe into a ball 
to roll it toward some
overwhelming question 
to say   i am lazarus  come from the dead 
come back to tell you all 
i shall tell you all 
if one  settling a pillow by her head 
should say 
 that is not what i meant at all 
that is not it  at all   
excuse me 
excuse me 
hello 
hello 
there was an old woman at school today 
and she was staring at me 
it was like she was following me 
did you know her 
no  but she freaked me out 
i didn t go back to class 
did she say something to you 
hugh told me that
he passed it on to me 
that something was gonna follow me 
that s all bullshit  jamie 
yeah  i know 
what exactly is supposed
to be following you 
i don t know 
you should tell mom what you saw 
no 
well  jay 
i m worried about you 
i could stay over tonight if it would
make you feel any better 
  no 
  no 
just on the couch or something 
no 
maybe just on the couch 
you should be more
worried about waking up
and finding paul
humping your leg 
um   
i m choosing to ignore these insults
to my character 
just keep your door locked 
look 
i m gonna stay up all night
and keep an eye out for anything weird 
nothing s gonna happen  ok 
almost sounds like a girl 
a girl 
perhaps 
or a    monster 
andre 
andre 
stop teasing him  hans 
he s in love 
i can t sleep 
not in there 
that s ok 
just sleep here

who brought you there 
ok 
that s where i had my first beer 
i threw up the whole night 
into the pool 
  no  outside the car 
  and in the car 
paul used to pee in it 
eww  that s disgusting 
whatever  there s chlorine 
when i was a little girl 
my parents wouldn t allow me
to go south of eight mile 
and i didn t even know what that meant
until i got a little older 
and i started realizing that
that s where the city started
and the suburbs ended 
and i used to think about
how shitty and weird that was 
i mean 
i had to ask permission
to go to the state fair
with my best friend and her parents
only because it was a
few blocks past the border 
my mom said the same thing 
how long do you think it ll be 
i don t know 
hours  i bet 
oh  my god

  come on  come on  come on 
jay 
jay 
do you see it 
is it still down there 
do you feel any different 
do you 
no 
 when there is torture 
there is pain and wounds 
physical agony and all this
distracts the mind from mental suffering
so that one is tormented
by the wounds
until the moment of death 
and the most terrible agony
may not be in the
wounds themselves
but in knowing for certain
that within an hour 
then within 10 minutes 
then within half a minute 
now at this very instant
