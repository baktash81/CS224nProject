hey whats up
nothing
paul and yara are here
were gonna watch a movie
if you feel like it
actually
im going out tonight
that guy
i like him
me too
i see you
you will have access to
advanced information
relative to the time and strength
of the forthcoming atomic tests
what about it
you will provide us with that
information as soon as it is available
i see
youre afraid of an overload
you cant tap enough electricity
wherever you get it from to control
a strong enough charge
you are a clever man doctor
perhaps too clever
and what makes you think
ill give you any information
it is the only way you can save
your own life when the time comes
you will be transported to one
of our platforms in space
what are you reading
the idiot
is it any good
i dont know yet
its about paul
hey jay
hey paul
stop
hey i have an idea
what
it got away
you ever play the trade game
no what is that
its a people watching game
my sister and i used
to play it when we were bored
youre bored right now
no shut up
let me finish
ok how do you play
you start by watching the crowd
casually scope out
the people around you
ok
now without telling me
pick a person youd want
to trade places with
it can be anyone
for whatever reason
ok i got it
now i get two guesses
to figure out
who you picked
and why you want to
trade places with them
ok good luck
that guy
nope
ok then
whod you pick
him
the dad
no the son
i mean how cool would that be
to have your whole life ahead of you
you know
come on
its not like youre old
youre 21
i know but
look how happy that kid is
plus at that age you could
go to the bathroom
any time time you want
total freedom
yeah
hes probably taking a shit right now
yeah exactly
i can never get away with that
ok my turn
ok
ok got it
how about the girl
in the yellow dress
where
right there
i dont see her
right there
are you teasing me
im sorry i just i dont
i dont see who youre talking about
can we go
im sorry i just
i just dont feel well
can we can we go
back to the car
is there someone in there
that made you want to leave
like an exgirlfriend or something
you said you saw a girl
with a yellow dress
is that someone that you knew
no i just felt sick
i feel better being outside
thanks for walking with me
mom knows you smoke
yeah but shell cry if she
actually sees it happening
or shell just steal your cigarettes
hows it going with hugh
good
mostly
i dont know he was acting
kind of weird last night
why
he said he wasnt
feeling well but
it seemed like
something was on his mind
have you
no
no
i know he wants to but
i dont know it seemed
different last night
do i smell bad
like uh cherry coke
banana nicotine
thats my favorite flavor
mom will love it
lets go back to the car
its funny
we used to daydream about being
old enough to go on dates and
drive around with friends
in their cars
i had this image of myself
holding hands with a
really cute guy
listening to the radio
driving along some pretty road
up north maybe
and the trees started to change colors
its never about going anywhere really
just having some sort
of freedom i guess
now that were old enough
where the hell do we go
jay
you awake
im sorry
what are you doing
im not gonna hurt you
dont worry
youre not gonna believe me
but i need you to remember
what im saying
ok
this thing
its gonna follow you
somebody gave it to me
and i passed it to you
back in the car
it could look like
someone you know
or it could be a stranger in a crowd
whatever helps it
get close to you
it can look like anyone
but theres only one of it
help
help
sometimes
sometimes i think it looks like
people you love
just to hurt you
i see it
i see it
who is it
you get rid of it
ok
just sleep with someone
as soon as you can
just pass it along
if it kills you
itll come after me
do you understand
what the fuck do you want
jay
im doing this to help you
just so you know its real
help
help me
never go into a place that
doesnt have more than one exit
its very slow
but its not dumb
can i have some
yeah
listen to this
i think that if one is faced by
inevitable destruction
if a house is falling
upon you for instance
one must feel a great
longing to sit down
close ones eyes and wait
come what may
thats why were
drinking on the porch
is your mom asleep already
almost for sure
she wakes up at 515
that would kill me
so
wheres jay at
on a date
your turn
who is he
somebody new
of course
your sisters so pretty
its annoying
it is annoying
well at least shes nice
is everything ok
just dont let it touch you
jay
what happened
i dont know
those people are such a mess
it was consensual
yeah
and youve never seen
the woman before
no
ok
have you ever been to his home
i know where it is but
ive never been inside
he said he was embarrassed
of where he lived
did she catch anything
i dont think so
oh poor jamie
apparently he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city
the police searched the place
they cant find him
oh my god
breaks my heart
the things he said to her
so weird and sick
i should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across floors of silent seas
and the afternoon the evening
sleeps so peacefully
smoothed by long fingers
asleep tired or it malingers
stretched out on the floor
here beside you and me
should i after tea and cakes and ices
have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis
but though i have wept and fasted
wept and prayed
though i have seen my head
grown slightly bald
brought in upon a platter
i am no prophet
and heres no great matter
i have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker
and i have seen the eternal footman
hold my coat and snicker
and in short i was afraid
and would it have been worth it after all
after the cups the marmalade the tea
among the porcelain
among some talk of you and me
would it have been worthwhile
to have bitten off the matter with a smile
to have squeezed the universe into a ball
to roll it toward some
overwhelming question
to say i am lazarus come from the dead
come back to tell you all
i shall tell you all
if one settling a pillow by her head
should say
that is not what i meant at all
that is not it at all
excuse me
excuse me
hello
hello
there was an old woman at school today
and she was staring at me
it was like she was following me
did you know her
no but she freaked me out
i didnt go back to class
did she say something to you
hugh told me that
he passed it on to me
that something was gonna follow me
thats all bullshit jamie
yeah i know
what exactly is supposed
to be following you
i dont know
you should tell mom what you saw
no
well jay
im worried about you
i could stay over tonight if it would
make you feel any better
no
no
just on the couch or something
no
maybe just on the couch
you should be more
worried about waking up
and finding paul
humping your leg
um
im choosing to ignore these insults
to my character
just keep your door locked
look

paul used to pee in it
eww thats disgusting
whatever theres chlorine
when i was a little girl
my parents wouldnt allow me
to go south of eight mile
and i didnt even know what that meant
until i got a little older
and i started realizing that
thats where the city started
and the suburbs ended
and i used to think about
how shitty and weird that was
i mean
i had to ask permission
to go to the state fair
with my best friend and her parents
only because it was a
few blocks past the border
my mom said the same thing

jay

come on come on come on
jay
jay
do you see it
is it still down there
do you feel any different
do you
no
when there is torture
there is pain and wounds
physical agony and all this
distracts the mind from mental suffering
so that one is tormented
by the wounds
until the moment of death
and the most terrible agony
may not be in the
wounds themselves
but in knowing for certain
that within an hour
then within 10 minutes
then within half a minute
now at this very instant
