    so that he would always be aware 
the most important thing
you should know about   
    real witches is this 
listen very carefully 
real witches dress in ordinary clothes   
    and look very much like ordinary women 
they live in ordinary houses   
   and they work in ordinary jobs 
every country in the world has witches 
and there is a leader   
   a high witch of each country 
and the ruler   
   of all the witches   
   is the most evil woman in creation 
the grand high witch herself 
witches spend their time
plotting to kill children 
stalking the wretched child like a hunter   
   stalks a bird in the forest 
did they hunt you 
you said it was an accident 
a very unpleasant accident 
when i was younger   
   i traveled the world
in search for the grand high witch   
   but i never found her 
i don t really believe
that anyone has ever found her 
if no one s seen the grand high witch   
   how are you sure she exists 
nobody s ever seen the devil 
but we know he exists  don t we 
for all you know 
a witch might be living next door to you 
when i was little   
    i lived beside a girl called erica   
    who was taken by a witch 
erica had very strict parents 
but even that didn t save poor erica   
    because when a witch chooses a victim   
    there is only one hope of escape 
knowing everything about them
that i am telling you 
i m warning you 
erica  come in 
what makes her dangerous is the fact
that she doesn t look dangerous 
you can never be sure
if it s a witch you re looking at   
    or a kind lady 
erica 
how do you like my new painting 
it s magnifique  papa 
go to larsen s   
   and buy a liter of milk 
yes  papa 
come straight home 
real witches hate children 
real witches are quite bald 
although  of course  they wear wigs   
   that itch   
   and cause them scalp rash 
do you know what scalp rash is 
no 
itching under the wig 
must drive them crazy 
they look quite hideous
behind their human facemasks 
they can only be distinguished
from ordinary women   
    if you are sharp enough
to spot the purple tinge to their eyes 
real witches have no toes 
their feet have square ends   
    revolting stumps
where their toes should be 
so they never wear pointed
or pretty shoes 
just plain  sensible shoes 
remember these things 
perhaps if erica had known them   
my poor erica 
for weeks they searched 
but witches don t murder children
with knives or guns 
that s for people who get caught 
and witches never get caught 
they searched for miles around 
everyone in the town searched   
    but she had completely disappeared 
i was there in erica s house
six weeks later 
good day  frau larsen 
come in  helga  have some cake 
i was her best friend when it happened 
then  that day   
    while erica s mother
was pouring the coffee   
    her father came walking towards us 
it was as though he had seen a ghost 
his face was all twisted up   
    as he walked towards the painting
behind me 
there  as if it always had been there   
    was erica   
    locked in the painting   
    gazing at us 
papa   
i don t believe it 
you saw her in the painting  grandma 
many times 
but the peculiar thing
was that little erica   
   kept changing her position in the picture 
one day she d be feeding the ducks 
the next day 
she d be inside the farmhouse   
   iooking out of a window 
did you see her moving in the picture 
nobody did 
she was always just a figure   
    motionless in the painting 
as the years went by 
erica grew older  too 
and only five or six years ago   
   the old woman that erica had become   
   bent and frail in the painting   
   began to disappear 
until   
   one morning  she was gone 
she died 
who knows 
mysterious things go on
in the world of witches 
it s almost 9 00 
grandma s been telling me
about witches  mom 
and frightening you before you go to sleep 
good night  darling 
everything all right 
very all right 
go on  enjoy yourselves 
good bye  mom 
here you go 
  good night  son 
  good night  dad 
no more stories  okay 
oh  no 
come on  just one more story 
all right  one more  but very short 
witches   
   are very cruel 
they have a highly developed sense
of smell 
a real witch could smell you
across the street   
   on a pitch black night 
not me  i just had a shower 
yes  she could 
the cleaner you are 
the more a witch can smell you 
that doesn t make sense 
yes  it does 
a dirty child  it s the dirt she smells 
a clean child  it is the child 
i ll never have a shower again 
and i ll have you for an excuse 
well  just not too often 
only once a month is probably safe 
so a witch could smell me right now 
to me  you smell of raspberries
and cream   
   but to a witch  you would smell
absolutely disgusting 
what kind of disgusting 
like dog s droppings 
i don t believe it 
you don t believe it 
what s more  to a witch 
you d smell of fresh dog s droppings 
that s not true 
there s no point in arguing 
it s a fact of life 
so  if you see a woman holding her nose
as she passes you   
   she could easily be a witch 
and now it is definitely bedtime 
good night  grandma 
mom 
dad 
frau evershim

  i went to make the bed  they were there 
  what 
  white and disgusting 
calm down 
is this your room 
yes 
i m sorry  madam 
but i cannot permit mice in my hotel 
how dare you say that
when your rotten hotel   
   is full of rats anyway 
rats 
there are no rats in this hotel 
i saw one this morning running
along the corridor into the kitchen 
madam  you only arrived in the hotel
this afternoon 
morning  afternoon 
i saw a rat in your hotel   
   and if matters do not improve   
   i ll have to report you
to the public health authorities 
look  madam  i m not prepared   
the cakes in the lounge are nibbled
all around the edges  i can show you 
if you re not careful   
   the health people
will order the whole hotel closed   
   before everyone gets typhoid fever 
you can t be serious  madam 
i ve never been more serious in my life 
now  will you or will you not
let my grandchild   
   keep his hygienic
and perfectly harmless pet mice 
if they are kept in the cage 
and only in this room 
nowhere else in the hotel 
agreed 
very well 
grandma   
   i can t train my mice if they re in a cage 
nibbled cakes  indeed

only it was a boy called bruno jenkins 
i m teaching william and mary
how to be tightrope walkers 
i brought the circus i m building with me 
good  show me 
let s see 
look  i m planning them a major house 
ramp ways here  a bathtub 
this elevator s pretty neat 
you really did this yourself 
it s good  i m impressed 
you must train your mice   
   but you mustn t get caught
or do it in here   
   because if that hysterical maid
comes back   
now it s teatime 
i just love english hotel teas 
cream cakes and shortbread and   
no  grandma 
no cream cakes 
and no shortbread  either 
it s full of sugar 
i shall end up eating the same diet
as your mice 
that s the trouble with this country 
a queue for everything 
they wouldn t think to have
two tea trolleys 
no  that d be too convenient
for the paying guests 
they ll want two lumps of ice
in their whiskey next 
they d queue for their own funerals
if they could 
i know that woman from somewhere   
   but i can t for the life of me
remember where 
her face is so familiar 
which one 
my memory s going 
but it s as if i met her before 
she s probably on tv or something 
cucumber sandwiches 
fish paste 
you got the wrong one 
oh  no  sugar 
sugar can kill you 
i know  but it was very little 
something very odd is going on 
are you listening to me 
you ll have some fresh air
if i have to take you out by your ear 
we didn t come here for you to sit eating
and watch telly all day 
all the other boys are out there
playing in the water 
pick up your knife 
you re just like your father 
good afternoon  madam

locked and bolted  your grandness 
good  help me 
witches of england   
   you re a disgrace 
miserable witches   
   you are good for nothing worms 
everywhere i look   
   i see the repulsive sight   
   of hundreds   
   thousands   
   of revolting little children 
i ask you 
why 
one child a week is no good to me 
we will do better 
we will do much better 
better is no good  either 
i demand maximum results 
so   
   here are my orders 
my orders are   
   that every child   
   in england   
   shall be rubbed out 
destroyed 
every single child eliminated 
do i make myself clear 
we can t possibly wipe out all of them 
who spoke 
who dares to argue with me 
it was you 
i didn t mean to argue 
you dare to argue with me 
no  honestly  it just was a   
a stupid witch who answers back   
   must burn until her bones are black 
no 
a foolish witch   
   without a brain   
   must sizzle into fiery flame 
a witch   
   who dares to say i m wrong   
   will not be with us   
   very long 
what the devil 
i hope nobody else
is going to make me cross today 
now  this is my plan 
each of you   
   will go back to your homes   
   and resign from your jobs 
give notice 
retire 
you will then buy 
with the money i give you   
   sweet shops 
candy stores 
the best and most respectable
sweet shops in england 
upstairs i have a trunkload
of this english money   
   so you ll be able to offer three   
   maybe four times
what these shops are worth 
go 
on a certain day   
   when all our plans are prepared   
   you ll announce a great gala opening   
   with free sweets  candies 
and chocolates for every child 
poison sweets 
we ll wipe them out like weasels 
  who spoke 
  she did 
it s brilliant 
poison 
and you don t mind getting caught 
exposed 
vilified 
i just thought   
spineless bumpkin 
you blithering bogvumper 
no wonder england is swarming with   
everything you sell that day   
   will have been treated   
   with my very latest   
   and very greatest magic formula 
witches work only with magic 
wait  come here 
formula 86 
my greatest triumph 
a work of   
   genius 
formula 86 
in this bottle   
   500 doses   
   with a delay mechanism   
   that prevents it from working
until two hours   
   after it has been taken 
what does it do   
   genius one 
one dose   
   and the time works to the second 
but more than five doses   
   breaks the delay barrier   
   and the formula works instantly 
the child   
   starts to shrink 
the child   
   starts to   
   grow fur 
starts   
   growing a tail 
all this happens in precisely 25 seconds 
shrinking more 
the child   
   is no longer a child 
the child   
   is a mouse 
silence 
shut up 
silence  enough 
this afternoon   
   at precisely 4 15   
   i put one dose of my formula   
   on a bar of chocolate 
i gave it to a repulsive   
   smelly boy   
   who was in the lobby 
 was that good   i asked him 
 got any more     
   said the nauseating child 
 six more bars like that one   i told him 
in two minutes  time   
   this appalling  foul smelling creature   
   is coming to collect his reward 
in five minutes  time   
   you ll see my magic formula in action 
we re going to see 
quickly  wigs  gloves 
the appalling child will be here   
   and you ll see my miracle 
come on  hurry up 
that s good 
hurry up  everybody
