by the germans 
the occupied and free zones   
are officially divided
by a borderline 
in paris  the curfew   
is imposed at 11 p  m 
no one can afford to miss
the last metro 
hungry parisians queue up
to buy food   
and flock to theatres for warmth 
movies are just as crowded   
playing to full houses 
at the montmartre theatre 
rehearsals are under way   
though its director 
lucas steiner  has fled france 
he didn t have much choice 
excuse me  mlle 
i noticed you    i wonder   
what time it is  it s 6 40

wait    i don t want you
to think i m on the make   
i mean it 
why would i think that 
i was in the caf√©   
making a call   
i noticed you   
i mean it was your eyes   
and your expression 
so i figured   
what 
well  this is my lucky day 
so i thought   
we might have a drink and talk 
i m not thirsty and not interested 
let me be 
you ve got me all wrong 
d you think i do this every day 
no  only every other day 
stop pestering me 
okay  have it your way   
no  wait    let me explain 
do you know what it means
to be attracted to someone 
please  believe me   
i haven t accosted
a strange woman in    4 years 
what an honor   
look  that s enough 
d you want a public scandal 
think about it 
let me have something  a name   
an address  a phone number 
i m bernard 
you want my number 
great  let me write it down 
odeon 84 00 
odeon 84 00   
hey  who re you kidding 
that s the talking clock number 
who s that boy 
he s the concierge s son 
she works at the theatre 
what did he do to you 
he patted my head 
let s go and wash your hair out 
come back here at once 
is the theatre closed 
no  go in through the stage door 
i ve got an appointment 
mr granger 
yes 
mrs steiner is expecting you 
follow me 
beautiful theatre 
it beats the grand guignol  right 
it s twice as big   
i ve been here before   
i saw mrs steiner
in  the cherry orchard  
any news of lucas steiner 
the boss  he was lucky   
one day 
they came looking for him   
here  the germans 
no  the french 
they were buzzing all around   
but he had already
skipped out of paris 
i hear he s in america   
south america   
or around there 
i hope he can work 
the offices are upstairs 
bernard granger    mr merlin 
i recognized you 
merlin s our business manager 
he handles the finances 
wait here 
a few minutes 
okay  thanks 
marion  i know rosen s
aryan certificate is a fake   
but they won t check it
with a magnifying glass 
he s got no work permit 
he ll claim he lost it 
we could use our contacts 
no  we may need them 
with the papers he s got 
he manages to work   
at the film studios 
he s lucky they re so careless   
but here  we stick to the rules 
no permit  no work 
what can i tell rosen 
the truth  no jews
in marion steiner s theatre 
rosen  come this way   
i didn t know you were here 
i ll be right back 
i ll go get marion 
did you explain my case
to mrs steiner 
what did she say 
sorry rosen 
she won t hire a jew   
i just can t believe it 
anywhere else  i d expect this   
but in lucas steiner s
own theatre   
it s truly an outrage 
come in 
hold it  i want to understand 
what 
i considered myself lucky to play
here but if i must lower my pants   
to prove i m not a jew   
thanks  but no thanks 
besides  i refuse to take
anyone s job away from him 
you ve got it all wrong   
that actor was not slated
for the role of the tutor   
but for a walk on in the third act 
believe me 
believe me  granger   
you were my first choice
as marion s leading man 
you must realize our position   
we need an okay for the play 
we re still waiting
for the censor s visa 
this is bernard granger 
i ve heard great things about you   
from friends who saw you
at the grand guignol 
and i trust jean loup 
at first  l was doubtful
about the grand guignol   
but finally  i enjoyed
playing  the skeleton  
i never saw it
because i work at night 
in the past   
my husband managed everything 
i knew nothing
about administration   
and business details 
i had to learn quickly 
let s discuss your contract 
right now 
let s get it over with 
what did you earn
at grand guignol 
i was looking for you 
here s the script  it s wholesome
reading  memorize it  child 
this one 
yes  thanks 
i couldn t find it
at the theatre bookshop 
it hasn t been published 
i ve never heard of it 
it s a norwegian play 
by a norwegian playwright   
karen bergen 
a genuinely norwegian name 
lucas discovered it
and had it translated 
do you speak norwegian 
neither do i  but i bet the critics
will pan the translation 
d you know granger 
is he here 
in my office 
i don t know him   
but we almost met 
hello 
we expected you at lucien s
house warming party 
i couldn t make it 
we ll meet again 
 i hereby declare
i am not jewish   
and to the best
of my knowledge   
my parents or grandparents
are not jewish  
how did it go 
okay 
great  i ll see you around 
you never really wanted
to be an actress 
i enjoyed the job i had 
i know 
if lucas hadn t kidnapped you   
you d still be in fashion 
right  and that s not all 
he said that if i refused 
he d ask coco chanel to fire me 
it sounds just like him 
can i turn the lights off 
yes 
i m waiting for you 
right 
oh hell  daxiat 
i forgot we had a dinner date 
i ll see you later 
goodnight 
don t let him see you   
i forgot to tell you   
that i m having dinner
with daxiat 
he can help us
get the censor s visa   
i sort of promised
you might come 
you shouldn t have 
i don t see how
you can associate with him 
i don t have much choice 
remember why he panned
 britannicus  
yes  he claimed it was
an effeminate play 
even so  we need his help
for the visa   
all i ask is for you to say hello   
and also shake his hand 
i ll shake his hand   
but no dinner  figure out
some excuse  i m going home 
raymond  cut the lights 
 fine  eric  go to bed now  
 fine  eric  go to bed now  
eric hesitates   
then turns back to his mother 
 mother  will mr carl return  
 l don t know 
what do you think  
 he will return  
as helena s embroidery   
drops from her hands   
carl hears a sound
and turns around 
 who s there  
he sees helena 
 why are you hiding  
 leave this house 
your presence here is harmful  
 before i go 
you must hear me out  
 when dr sanders
hired me last spring    
wait    let s reverse that   
i think it s best
to start with  last spring    
 you must hear me out  
hello  darling 
 last spring 
when dr sanders hired me    
come over here 
arlette guillaume 
our set and costume designer 
bernard granger   
he ll play carl 
you must have seen his act 
i don t think so   
wait    yes  i have seen it 
at the grand guignol 
no  in a very banal role 
just a man   
on the prowl 
you can t judge me by that part   
i was improvising 
you seemed to know it by heart 
the rehearsal s over   
but i want to say something 
i m going to stage the play 
like all of you 
i d have preferred   
that  disappearance 
be directed by lucas himself 
fortunately 
he left us explicit notes   
as to the staging 
it goes without saying that   
we ll be guided by his notes 
i ll do my best to help you all 
that s it 
may i leave now 
run along 
what about daxiat 
the drama critic 
can t he help us   
he got us the censor s visa 
so let s not make waves 
can you help me fix my bracelet 
the clasp is stuck 
you read palms 
what do you see 
there are two women in you 
that s true  go on 
raymond  come quickly 
i m scared   
i hear noises in the theatre 
don t worry  germaine 
i ll take a look 
anybody here 
anybody here 
how did you get in 
i watched the rehearsal 
it looks great 
i told you to wait outside  martine 
calm down 
look what i ve got 
still interested 
i had no money 
i ve got to pay for it tonight 
how much 
4 200 francs 
it s 14 lbs 
i ll go ask mrs steiner 
the grand guignol
has 100 orchestra seats   
200 with the balcony 
you average half a house 
just about 
a little more on sundays   
but they average half a house 
the seats range
from 20 to 40 francs   
a daily gross of 6 000 
how many players 
mrs steiner 
excuse me 
the ham 
oh  yes 
how many 
four actors 
tree of us play two roles each 
with the costs 
they barely break even 
it s a losing proposition 
i m ready  shall we go 
goodnight  mrs steiner 
goodnight  marion 
come in 
i ve got your ham  it s 4 200 frs 
4 200 frs 
if it s too expensive

4 200 
right 
thanks  here s the cello 
what do i want with a cello 
here s the animal 
look   
14 pounds 
you can t walk around
with a ham in your arms  can you 
no  i can t

the lights and shutters 
the air raid warden

i ll remember 
sir 
valentin

i know i ve aged a lot 
i left a script
at the desk for you   
a screenplay 
read it and tell me what you think 
i won t detain you 
goodbye marion 
this is for you 
i know 
your keys 
d you have a minute 
i keep on getting mail
for mr steiner   
probably from people
who don t know he s gone 
it s embarrassing 
should i return it to the senders 
or give it to you 
it s probably theatre business mail 
i ll take it 
d you want all his mail 
  yes 
  fine 
  thanks 
  you re most welcome 
room service 
no  i ate at the theatre 
did the reporter
from  paris echos  call you  
no  why 
this morning  he was in the hallway
with a camera 
i told him you weren t in 
he said 
 i just want to take
a picture of her room  
he said it was for a reportage
on  the stars at home  
i told him to call you 
didn t he call 
no 
was i wrong 
no  you were right 
i hate those snoopers 
are you watering your flowers 
it s not flowers 
vegetables 
no 
it s for a pipe   
with a match  it smokes 
you ll wind up in jail 
where the hell is she 
for christ s sake 
do we rehearse  or not 
we re waiting for nadine 
i ll give her an earful 
you know what time it is 
you joy ride with the boches
and i get hell 
i was dubbing  we worked late 
so they drove me here 
you re not squeamish  i bet
you d accept a role in  jew s√ºss  
and how  but they didn t have
a role for me 
excuse me  i m sorry 
take your time 
you re only an hour late 
what s your excuse today 
your alarm clock 
no  i was dubbing 
must you grab every offer 
can t you leave the dubbing jobs
to those who need work 
she needs it 
she s a pain in the ass 
no  i can t   
i take every offer i get 
i do radio in the morning
and dubbing at noon 
at night  i do walk ons 
on thursday  i play moli√©re
for school kids   
and if it s a bit part
in a movie  i say yes 
the only way to succeed
is to accept everything   
to get maximum exposure
and make new contacts 
if you want to fire me  say so   
sacha guitry is casting 
i can run right over 
have you anyone in mind 
yes  i ve got two men 
raoul coquet and fernand coustal 
remember them 
coquet sounds good 
i ll call him 
i m not so sure of coustal 
i ll put a question mark
on his name 
is that her 
yes   
that s her 
still a beauty 
why  still  
 the sin  dates back
to my communion 
you saw the film  how come 
i didn t see it 
but i swiped all the stills   
including the famous one 
she really is beautiful   
but she s strange   
i can t figure her out 
let s make the phone call 
lucas  i ve got bad news for you 
the germans banned the play 
no   
you can t leave next week 
the escape route fell through 
you said it was a sure thing 
it s never sure 
the passer who guides people
through nevers was arrested 
i ve got another lead 
but it s risky 
you re afraid he ll get caught too 
no  worse than that   
some passers   
so called passers   
after taking your money   
drive you straight
up to the kommandantur 
so they get paid off
on both ends   
you re a special case 
some people may recognize you 
or spot your accent 
let s stay put for a while 
will you be able to hold out 
of course i will    i must 
but l hate to feel so useless   
so trapped 
did you talk to jean loup 
will he help us 
frankly  i d rather
keep him out of it   
he knows too many people 
he gossips  he fools around   
it s too dangerous 
d you know how many letters about
jews are mailed to the police 
guess 
i don t know    300 
1 500  1 500 letters daily 
 my boss is jewish    
my neighbour is a jew    
no  they all think you re gone   
let s keep it that way 
i ll take care of you 
did you think i was being polite 
well  you re wrong 
i want to look at your legs 
wait  let me breathe in
the smell of the stage 
from the cellar 
i follow all that goes on 
when the lights are dimmed in the
morning  i know it s rehearsal time 
when they go on again 
it s lunch time 
when all the lights go out
at night  it means   
you re on your way down 
it reminds me of a play
i saw in london 3 years ago 
at night 
the husband would pretend   
to go out  but as soon
as the gaslight grew dim   
we knew it meant he d come back
and was up in the attic 
do you remember that play 
i almost acquired the rights 
he liked the grand guignol   
but he s very happy to be with us 
he s a little like jean gabin in
 the human beast   very physical   
and yet quite gentle 
he says it s because of you
that he s an actor 
no  i ll do it myself 
tell me how rehearsals are going 
jean loup is doing well 
l was delighted today
when he blew his top 
yes  just a minute 
jean loup  it s daxiat 
what does he want 
i don t know 
hello  daxiat  what s up 
i heard it yesterday 
in the last metro 
they may stop rehearsals
of  the dead queen  
why  is montherlant a jew 
you re pretty warm   
daxiat wants to expose the jews
who still work
at the com√©die fran√ßaise 
he claims jean yonnel
is a rumanian jew 
i don t know if yonnel is jewish 
or half jewish   
but i know
he should have run away   
far away from these maniacs 
they re really crazy   
all madmen 
not only in germany  but here 
daxiat and the others   
madmen 
you wanted to know
what bernard granger looked like 
he s just perfect 
at least we don t have to worry 
he looks like a real goy 
what have you got against goyim 
nothing against   
those with short skirts
and long hair 
you dirty racist 
my mother warned me
i d never be happy with a jew 
 you know  carl   
if you wish to remain
in this house   
you must never pronounce
the name of charles henri 
everyone noticed
my new dress last night   
except for you    
that s very good  nadine   
but i want you
to move over to bernard 
we ll give you a lamp 
you ll put it on the table   
it will help   
raymond  stop fooling around   
go get us a lamp 
let s go on 
 don t tell me it s your work  
 i know you work   
more than i do   
but some people in this house   
should keep   
their own duties in mind  
 why do you say that  
because    it s in the script 
yes  it s daxiat 
go over and say hello 
be friendly  remember he helped us
get the censor s visa 
don t worry  i ll thank him 
alright  kids  let s take a break 
who s he 
don t you know him 
he s the lnspector general   
daxiat  the drama critic 
is that daxiat  i had no idea   
i d love to meet him   
you re not fussy 
he practically runs
the com√©die fran√ßaise 
this may sound strange 
coming from me   
but i think your husband   
was wrong to leave france 
the new anti israelite laws   
apply to theatre speculators
and profiteers 
but your husband was a rare pearl 
the only israelite
theatre director   
you can say jewish 
he was at once
a brilliant executive   
a talented stage director
and an artist 
you see  the germans
are deeply attached to culture 
they don t want talented artists
to leave france 
but there s no need
to worry about your play 
i m certain cottins
can handle the job 
still  one wonders
why this play was chosen   
even pitoeff turned it down 
d you know mrs fabre 
she wants to ask you for a favor 
yes  of course  i know madame 
it s about my son  pierre 
what s he doing here 
he likes to sniff around
at rehearsals   
when he s interested in a play 
will he write about us 
he will  or he won t 
i wish he d forget us 
just stay here 
look   
we re all catholics in our family   
here s the proof   
fine    i ll do my best   
come and meet our little circle 
nadine marsac  the top student
of the simon drama course   
well 
he s going to help me 
bernard granger   
our leading man   
straight out of the grand guignol 
as you see 
he plays carl 
yes   
strange    he d be ideal as
 the hairy ape  
raymond will show you the way out 
he doesn t go for girls  does he 
is it okay to ask you a question 
look at this 
what do you call it 
a fishing rod 
but we also call it a gaulle 
now  if we add a second one to it   
we get  deux gaulle  
bravo  raymond   
you re very witty 
i speak to you from the plant
of a journal   
that proclaims the truth 
i say the french theatre
must drive its jews out   
from the rafters
to the prompter s box 
for a jewish prompter
at the  menilmontant    
will worm his way
to the high command of the opera 
we must oust the jew
from the stage and the wings   
and keep him out 
no jew should be allowed
in a key position in theatre   
for his sordid practices
are bound to corrupt it 
let these  gentlemen  be warned   
that france is off limits to jews 
only in this way can true frenchmen
safeguard their nation 
here s the money you asked for 
mrs steiner 
but i can t raise
this amount every month 
of course not 
this is exceptional 
in that case  there s no problem 
hello  mr merlin    come in 
marion  this is rosette 
put your samples on the desk
and run along home 
how old are you 
i ll be fourteen in 3 months 
you re working   
don t you go to school 
no  i don t want to anymore 
d you like the theatre 
yes 
come see our play 
she can t come to the theatre 
the kid can t go out at night 
yes  i can 
3 months ago  i went to hear
edith piaf at the abc theatre 
i wore my scarf down to here   
so nobody could see it 
there was no trouble 
we ll talk about it some other time 
go home  it s late 
i m surprised at you  marion 
now  that child will insist
on seeing the play   
her parents hate to deny her
anything  but they ll blame me 
forgive me  i m sorry 
i was sympathetic because   
are they french 
the girl is 
but her parents are polish 
the father s a tailor 
he works at home   
in an attic 
he can t go out in the street   
on account of his thick accent 
like lucas 
his is much worse   
besides  he hardly speaks french   
lf a german asks him for directions 
he d be trapped 
so he hides in his attic
and his wife manages for him 
isn t he scared of a denunciation 
can t they go to the free zone 
they d love to go   
but it costs a fortune
and they re poor 
got a date tonight 
not really    i m going home 
let s have dinner 
i m sorry  i can t 
you can t spend every night
by yourself 
i ve got to go home 
i ve read them all 
mrs director 
nothing of interest 
you can return them   
but first  make sure to burn
the reader s notes   
they re in my handwriting 
i ll take care of it 
let me explain
about the money 
i divided it in three wads 
the first is for the conveyor
who ll take you to vierzon 
they call them conveyors 
yes  conveyors 
he s to be paid
before he drives off 
you ll be comfortable 
it s a furniture moving van 
i ll sit in an armchair 
like a minister 
listen  lucas  this is serious 
this wad is for the farmer who ll
take you across the borderline 
his property is so big
that it extends over both zones 
at the furthest end 
you re in the free zone 
let me guess 
the third wad is for spain 
for spain and for the rest 
and in case you need more 
i brought this 
no mrs  not the jewelry 
not   the   jewelry 
you may need it 
so will you  bring it along
when you join me   
i want you to join me   
as soon as possible 
to be safe  i ve got to play
the first 100 performances 
good god  what confidence 
d you think it will run till then 
that s 6 months   
no  i want you to leave
after the 50th    no later 
i ll tell them i ve got a spot
on my lungs   
and to find another actress 
i ll turn the management over
to jean loup   
and pretend i m going to
a sanitarium  then  i ll join you   
and we ll start from scratch 
i m not a barber    stop fidgeting 
don t  it s horrible 
i m trying to feel jewish 
it s very hard to portray a jew 
if you underplay  they re skeptical 
if you overplay  they say 
 he doesn t look jewish  
what does it mean
 to look jewish  
why ask me 
don t move around 
listen  marion   
i love that song 
how could i resist his romancing   
or forget his manly embrace 
my heart still believes   
all the sweet lies   
and the tender look in his eyes 
i  who loved him so   
the most wonderful man
of st  jean 
he broke my heart   
didn t say goodbye   
or tell me why 
he broke my heart   
didn t say goodbye   
or tell me why 
  how s the garden 
  okay 
  growing 
  yeah

jacquot  come here

german troops

i heard it on the radio 
people from the free zone
will be happy   
they invaded the free zone 
so what 
i ll have to sneak across
all of france instead of just half 
no  the germans are everywhere 
they search all the trucks 
the passer refuses to risk it   
it s much too dangerous now 
what am i supposed to do 
wait till things simmer down 
i can t stay here  i ll go crazy 
this is no life 
d you know
how i kill time all day 
i read    i read a lot   
i listen to lies on the radio 
then i read lies in the press 
to keep from losing my mind   
i do crossword puzzles 
you want to see them 
just listen 
across  in 5 letters   
symbol of infamy   kikes  
down  in 8 letters   
stinking vultures   sheenies  
these are for the kiddies 
 you can never trust one    
in 3 letters 
the first letter is a j   
so l give up  i listen to
the sounds in the theatre   
i wait for your footsteps
on the stairs 
i wait and wait 
i can t wait anymore 
how many years can a man live 
i can t take it anymore   
please  lucas   
i m going 
where 
away from here 
i ll speak to them 
to whom 
the authorities    the police   
i ll regularize   
my status  i ll register 
are you crazy 
stay here  what do you want 
a concentration camp 
let me go 
you re not leaving   
i won t let you 
here  it s real cognac   
from the black market 
you re shaking   
you d better take a drink 
i just realized something awful 
i could kill a man   
we ll fix up the cellar 
we ll get a real bed   
a comfortable armchair
and some rugs 
i need a desk 
you ll have a real apartment 
i hope you won t forget
the wallpaper 
mrs steiner wants a rifle
for the gamewarden 
we need an official permit
for a prop rifle   
it s not so easy 
it s what she wants 
i can t go out that way 
they re here 
we should have gotten up earlier 
  use the back yard 
  right 
  marion   
  yes 
don t forget to lock the door 
they sent him to another stalag   
but he can t tell me where it is   
i mail them separately 
one of them might reach him 
they fit me  i m the same size
as your husband 
he wasn t my husband 
he was my number two 
i got them
at the colonial exposition   
for cash  of course 
at times  he was fun   
but what a bastard 
hello  bernard 
i bet you slept out 
you haven t shaved 
yes  i spent the night out 
i ran into a raid for
 voluntary labor in germany  
two guys were checking everybody 
so l turn this way and that way   
each guy thought the other
had checked me out 
it s nothing to brag about 
that s why our prisoners
can t come home 
how come you re dressing up here 
don t broadcast it 
yes  i spent the night out 
i hate for a man to touch me 
can t you do this instead of him 
you want to know
how i feel about it 
maybe i can t stand
touching a man 
don t forget my other costume 
what other costume 
it s written in the script 
act 2 
 carl enters  wearing a frown  
i d suggest something sober 
you know granger 
the new actor 
yes  tell him i couldn t wait 
say christian left this 
i ll give it to him 
marion    are you there 
where are you 
go over to the bed
and say something 
say what  i m by the bed 
i can t hear 
same here  i hardly hear you 
go over to the radio 
where is the radio 
i don t see it 
it s next to the boiler 
the boiler 
here i am 
is it this hole 
yes  i hear you as if you were
by my side 
turn the sound on loud
and come up to the stage 
this is very dangerous 
it s not   
it s great 
i rigged up the old heating vent 
with this set up   
i can hear all the rehearsals
from the cellar 
at night  i can give you suggestions
to pass on to jean loup   
now   disappearance  is sure to be
a hit    it could run for a year 
i m back in business 
i m directing again   
but strictly incognito 
 since i came here 
i ve heard nothing but lies   
lies and contradictions  
 they re not lies  but blanks 
they re not lies  but blanks 
for years 
i tried to find out the truth 
it s dreadful not to know
who one is    what one has done 
even worse is the fear
it may occur again 
at times  i feel as if
i don t really exist  
 why won t dr sanders allow you
to consult a doctor  
 he knows more than any doctor 
without him  i d be dead 
i ll be eternally grateful to him  
 a prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer   
and dr sanders
has imprisoned you 
but if a man
tells you he loves you   
why won t you listen   
no    wait a minute 
is it really necessary to shout
all these lines 
i don t know   
it sounds all wrong to me 
lucas  notes are explicit 
this scene is to be played
like a duel 
like a duel 
alright  but it seems absurd to me 
 a prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer   
and dr sanders
has imprisoned you 
but if a man
tells you he loves you   
why won t you listen  
 i have no right to love   
no right to love  or be loved  
you are simply voicing
dr sander s words 
 i will tell you something
about dr sanders  
there   
you told me to shout  so i did 
but i m not happy about it 
i m not happy either 
you see  we re not happy 
granger s right 
the scene should not be shouted 
but that s what you asked for 
so i made a mistake   
jean loup shouldn t take my notes
so literally 
what s that 
an electricity failure 
get a candle 
a candle   
it s on again 
it shouldn t be played as a duel 
but as a conspiracy 
am i boring you 
sorry  i m simply exhausted 
then sleep here   
no  i want to sleep at the hotel   
i ll go home 
so  you re deserting
the conjugal cave 
goodnight 
wait    wait 
i m waiting 
i ll see you tomorrow morning 
raymond 
raymond 
did you see him 
no 
are you the electrician 
no  not the electrician 
the engineer 
here he is 
i know l m late  while i stood
in line at the hardware store   
someone swipes my bike 
so i take the subway   
it breaks down 
we re stuck between two stations   
as always 
why not take a bike cab 
we d have paid for it 
for his size  they charge double 
that s why i don t take them 
i ve got my self respect 
i was just kidding 
can you see me spread out
like a pasha   
being hauled around
by a poor bastard on his bike 
sure  i know  fat men are funny   
good natured clowns 
well  i m not a nice fat man   
i m a nasty one    go to hell 
listen  last year they stole
my bike too   
so i kissed it off 
but 3 days later 
in another street    unbelievable 
what do i see 
my very own bike   
no  813 hk 45 
so i figure i ll take it back 
just then  a creep walks up   
real cool   
i let him unfasten the lock 
then i say 
 look man  this is my bicycle  
the creep acts indignant 
we swap insults   
people gather
around to watch the fight 
you know what he pulls 
he calls me a fairy 
no offense  jean loup 
he claims i m molesting him   
making indecent proposals   
the works 
the people give me dirty looks 
they all side with the crook 
a real lynch mob  so i beat it fast
and never looked back 
there are the boches  the heinies   
the krauts  the jerries   
i don t remember the other one   
you forgot the buzzards   
that s right    the buzzards 
say  that s my record player 
it s not yours  it s marion s 
she lent it to me for a party 
they swipe all my props 
when it s not an armchair 
it s a record player 
a gentleman is waiting for you 
i wonder who it is 
i don t know his name 
he writes in  je suis partout  
daxiat 
yes  it s mr daxiat 
may i speak with you 
i wanted to meet you
outside the theatre   
because it s a confidential matter 
i know you don t like me   
but i daresay
it s perhaps because   
you don t know me 
i m not judging you   
but your articles
have often hurt friends   
whose work i admire 
others say you love the theatre 
i just don t know 
indeed  i am a paradox 
i adore the theatre 
i live for it and yet 
i m hated by most theatre people 
it requires strength of character
to cope with such hostility 
i daresay i ve got that strength 
i ve always admired lucas steiner   
if he was here  i would tell him
our real struggle is socialistic   
anti capitalistic    that we too 
are men of the left   
but we go further 
we want revolution 
you know  lucas   
read newspapers 
but only the theatre section 
i do the same  but politics   
you re wrong 
everything is political 
but that s not what i m here for   
lucas steiner is still in france 
we re sorry   
it s stupid  but obligatory 
everybody down to the shelter 
that identity card was found
on a passer who was arrested 
your husband must be
hiding out in some village   
but at some point 
he s bound to contact you 
would you give him a message 
if he comes back  i won t write
anything against him 
it s a matter of honor 
but if he returns 
you ll be compromised 
and what about your theatre 
the name of steiner
can only harm you 
you ought to get a divorce 
do you remember  marion 
remember what 
the elevator
of that department store 
yes  i remember   
i felt they all knew
what we were doing   
i was terrified   
only terrified 
no  not only terrified   
but the night of that premiere   
there  you were scared   
no  i enjoyed it   
go on    go home   
go back to the hotel 
i d rather you left right now 
what if i stay here tonight 
all night  till tomorrow 
all night  till tomorrow 
you mean it 
i ll put out the light
to consider your proposition 
 but if i tell you i love you   
why won t you listen  
i know it s in the script 
but l d rather
you refrained during rehearsals 
save it for the perfomance 
let s go on 
 i have no right to love   
no right to love  or be loved  
 but if i tell you i love you   
why won t you listen  
bernard  you re supposed to   
caress her face just then 
marion told him not to touch her 
a large crowd is gathered here 
i m trying
to make my way through   
what was that 
i m told that blast is due to   
an explosive device
in a record player 
admiral froelich
has been seriously injured 
they tell me he was killed 
the ambush was set up
by some terrorists   
a record player exploded 
excuse me  mrs steiner 
i m busy  mr merlin 
please  this is important 
i know who he is   
you shouldn t sell your jewelry 
let me take it to a pawn shop 
if the play s a hit 
you can get it back 
it makes sense 
thank you  mr merlin 
i m sorry  but i need some time   
to think it over 
as you wish 
would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room 
the kind of help you want
can be picked up in a brothel 
i can rehearse you 
never mind  i ll manage 
 carl  if you wish to remain
in this house   
you must never mention the name
of charles henri  
it s at the perfume counter of
the galeries  ask for miss yolande 
she ll let you have
 gone with the wind  for 80 frs 
i wouldn t spend that much
on a black market book   
but if marion wants it   
yes  she does 
then  i ll get it 
would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room 
i ve never done it 
it s simple 
you just read the text 
i say a line
and you answer me 
alright 
it s a nice room 
yes  it is 
essentially  they re profiteers 
very few come here to work 
the problem is that there s no way
for most frenchmen   
to recognize a jew 
ilf we could spot them 
we could protect ourselves 
some have typical racial features 
but not all of them 
if only all jews had blue skin 
but as it is   
we need a foolproof way
to detect them   
they say   it s better
to hear that than to be deaf  
but at times 
i d rather be stone deaf 
how was our rehearsal 
great   
i mean it was much better   
the whispering improves the scene   
but you could add to the intimacy
by dimming the lights 
the faces could be illuminated
from the rear    as silhouettes 
don t move   
remember  you re silhouettes 
raymond    if you don t mind 
you re a genius  jean loup 
i ll shift the backdrop
to sharpen the silhouettes 
what the hell  raymond 
we re in the dark 
l know 
the whole area s in the dark 
a light failure 
perfect for a shadow play 
the whole neighbourhood s
blacked out 
you d think they d warn us 
marc  let s get some lamps 
i know where we can get candles   
for cash  of course 
nadine  we re waiting for you 
let me explain 
no need to 
don t judge me 
i m not judging you   
but try to keep your love life
outside the theatre 
marion s heartless 
she s too tough   
she s not interested in anyone 
she has no sympathy for anyone 
she doesn t know i m alive 
she s worse since lucas  gone 
i can t stand it 
calm down  child    calm down   
it s not the end of the world 
she opened a door
that should have been locked 
you see it as a tragedy  but   
in two weeks 
it will have been forgotten 
i hope you re right 
i want to go home 
run along 
can i help 
no  drop it 
you re the last thing she needs 
she ll be alright 
i hate to see her so upset 
christ  i really was
on the wrong track with her 
that s for sure 
she s no playmate for you   
she s more like a competitor 
were you really stuck on her 
i just wanted to sleep with her   
it was like a craving
for a warm croissant 
i wanted to warn you to drop her 
but i figured   
it was none of my business 
you re all going to the joconde
tonight  lt s a cabaret 
you know what the bbc says 
they say all those   
who go to night clubs will be held
to account after the war 
jean loup
wants to boost our morale 
you   
you had the right to be moody   
to throw a party  or be by yourself 
why am i expected to be charming
and smiling at all time 
even jean loup picks on me 
he s right 
and he doesn t know half of it 
i don t mind that you neglect me   
but for the others 
the play comes first 
you must pay
more attention to them 
why don t you answer 
i d rather not 
the coffee s ready 
i ve got to run 
marion 
yes 
i heard you and bernard
rehearsing the love scene 
so what 
it seems to me    i feel   
it might be improved 
what do you mean 
it s the only love scene
in the play  try to be   
more sincere   
no  this seat s for bernard 
i can t stay  i ve got to meet
the producer of  angels of mercy  
i m not sure    it s between me
and two other girls 
i hope you get the role 
we ll pray for you 
i m off 
she ll be good   
but they may feel she s too young 
she d be better
in  school for wives  
nadine in the role of agn√©s 
when she announces 
 the little kitten is dead    
the whole audience will think 
 she s the one who killed it  
enjoying yourselves 
sit here 
well  i m not alone 
i brought a friend  simone   
sit down 
take care of her
while i check our things 
arlette  sit next to me 
just a minute 
give those back 
i ve changed my mind 
sorry  mrs steiner  i can t stay 
come on  let s go 
i forgot    i ve got a date 
you re free  we re all free 
i apologize  i ll see you tomorrow 
that man s staring at us 
don t look  he s coming over 
hello  cottins 
still in show business   
a real trooper 
introduce me 
i forget your name 
ren√© bernardini 
bernardini    arlette guillaume   
marion steiner 
i ll be right back 
you promise 
this joint is tacky 
let s go to the monseigneur 
no  marion s exhausted 
speak for yourself 
i feel like going there 
wait for arlette 
no  you two are kill joys 
i m not sleepy 
it s sinister here  let s go 
what s up 
tonight  i m on my own 
what s going on 
that s marion 
the party fizzles  so she opts
for an all night disaster 
i see daxiat has two seats   
i see daxiat has two seats   
in the 7th row 
remember  20 seats
for the propagandastaffel 
why look at me that way 
it s mandatory 
20 seats every night 
it s a rule 
at the odeon  they put them
in the side boxes 
we ll do the same 
it s too much 
we give good seats
to those who pan us   
and we turn down genuine fans 
lucas would say   we give
our best seats to our enemies  
my purse was in my dressing room 
it s missing 
oh  great 
what a mess 
somebody searched this room 
well 
they took my travel clock 
i think that s all they swiped 
and you 
they left my wallet 
but it s empty 
it s worse for you 
i don t mind the money 
but my ration cards  my i  d  card 
my work permit
and my pass were in my purse 
i m glad
i locked your door  marion 
i ll get the police 
no  we ll do the searching 
just like at radio paris 
some  moving men  came for
the piano  they never returned it 
they were moving men like i am 
that s fine  but i need my papers 
i wonder who did it 
well  i know who did it   
i m almost sure of it 
raymond  you know who i mean 
i guess you don t agree   
yes  i do  it could only be her 
i guessed it at once   
martine   
raymond  you know where she lives 
run over there   
no  i don t know 
come on  she s your sweetie 
she s not  she turned me down 
she peddles her black market stuff
around theatres  that s how we met 
i took her out once  that s all 
i don t even know her address 
i ve never been to her place   
but she s a looker   
i let people think
we slept together 
let s call the police 
i don t want the police
to seet foot in this theatre 
this way  please   
this way  please   
clear the aisle  thank you 
any seats tonight 
no  it s opening night 
that s marion steiner 
where is mrs steiner s office 
it s on the landing 
her dressing room is there 
no  leave the flowers here 
they ll poison the air in there 
i hear them  marion 
i don t see how you can eat 
i couldn t 
sure you can  here 
no  i swear i can t 
what if tonight s a disaster 
we ll do a new play 
with what money 
have you seen our accounts 
i have 
if it s a flop 
we lose the theatre 
i m terrified 
how can you be so calm 
lucas  you picked the play 
you staged it   
we followed your advice 
it s your creation 
if it doesn t work   
if it doesn t work   
i m to blame  it s my fault   
my own fault   
but we ll all be up shit creek 
have a drink 
i don t know how you do it   
i feel faint   
i m sick to my stomach 
just relax   
wait  put this over your stomach   
sit down 
thanks 
i must go now 
we ll talk later 
sure 
so long 
i should be reassuring you 
there s no need to 
i feel gay as a lark 
 isn t eric here  
 he was restless this morning 
he s probably at the gate 
watching the road  
 dr sanders wouldn t allow him
to go to the station  
 my godfather knows best 
i suppose he wanted to speak
to the new tutor in private 
but if i d been consulted 
i d say   
eric has no need for a tutor 
he s too young and i enjoy
teaching him the little i know  
 you are right  mrs   
but this big house
is too quiet for eric 
my mother says
that when she worked here   
she often served 20 dinner guests  
there are 25 of us in paris 
we re  public utilities  
 on my birthday   
when dr sanders told me
i could eat with the grown ups   
i cried  
how come she s going in 
my son is acting in this play 
 shall i prepare eric s room now  
you alright 
as the boss used to say 
 when you gotta go  you gotta go  
 tell eric to finish his homework  
 this is mr carl  our new tutor 
i should have warned you   
the resemblance is striking   
it s truly amazing  
 l don t know what you mean 
but i expected an older man  
 i m an experienced teacher  
 i don t doubt it 
but so far  my son
has been raised solely by us 
i had hoped he might
be guided by someone who   
still 
since my godfather trusts you   
eric  meet your new tutor  
 helena  be wary
of your faulty memory 
here are his credentials 
i showed them to you
a month ago  
what a bastard 
 you re surely right 
i was confused    
 certainly
by the resemblance  
 every new face upsets me   
but i ll get used to him  besides   
eric seems happy  
 can i take mr carl
around the estate  
 of course  child  
 listen  gregory  
 when will you learn to trust me 
don t you realize
how i cherish you 
besides    
 l don t want to lose you  
hurry up 
germaine 
we ve only got five minutes 
don t turn around 
how did it go 
we ll know when it s over 
watch it   
easy   
what s going on 
we re 5 minutes late 
can t we go in quietly 
 i must tell you about dr sanders  
 you ve no right  
 i must tell you  helena 
dr sanders didn t come back
after charles henri s death 
but before it  
 since i came here 
i ve heard nothing but lies   
lies and contradictions  
 they weren t lies  but blanks 
i ve spent years trying
to learn the truth 
it s terrifying not to know
who i am  or what i did 
worse yet  is the fear
that it may occur again 
at times  i feel i don t really exist  
 but when i told you i love you   
why didn t you listen  
i had no right to love 
don t you see 
no right to love  or be loved  
 and now  
 now  i m coming to love
and it hurts 
ls love painful  
 yes  love is painful 
like a bird of prey 
it hovers over us   
as if to threaten us 
but it is also
a promise of happiness 
you re lovely  helena   
so lovely that it s painful
to look at you  
 yesterday  you said it was a joy  
 it is a joy and it s painful  
we won 
i m sorry  but marion s exhausted 
i m sorry  but marion s exhausted 
you understand   
she s got to rest 
you can come in 
send her a note 
she ll appreciate it 
i didn t know you were here 
come in 
my husband s with me 
so he is 
put them there 
  you were wonderful 
  thanks 
i knew the torn dress
would be effective 
sorry  but they insist on it 
captain wiedekind and his wife 
my husband doesn t speak french 
cheer up  you look grim 
i m not  here s to you 
it went smoothly 
except for that louse  daxiat 
what are you brooding about 
i m not  i was thinking
about the play 
i enjoyed playing with you 
i was really moved 
you gave a great performance 
i ll do better in a few days 
see that man over there 
the one who s by himself 
yes  please get him out of here 
leave it to me 
remember me 
yes  you can t stay here   
this is a private gathering   
a working session 
she s expecting me 
she s not expecting anyone 
she s exhausted   
that way out 
did she get my flowers 
were those your roses 
they were so full of thorns
her hands were all bloody 
if i were you 
i d go home real fast 
so long 
thank you very much 
you were excellent 
bravo  you were great 
i was  thanks 
looking for someone 
no  never mind 
are you pleased 
i m happy for marion 
i don t understand you 
you heard the applause  it s a hit 
a hit    a hit   
maybe so  but it s far from perfect 
from down here 
you can tell all the weak spots 
i made notes 
i ll read them to you 
sit down 
in the first place   
are you crazy 
we can t do that now 
they re waiting for me 
i can t stay 
come back later on 
how can i 
we re all together up there 
you know what it s like   
then  spend the night here 
that s impossible  be sensible 
i ll come down tomorrow morning 
then take my notes  study them 
alright 
wait    look at me 
where can i put them 
keep them till tomorrow 
kiss me   
goodbye 
daxiat liked it 
he ll give us a rave   
here s marion 
where were you 
some champagne for marion   
i want the  petit parisien    
 aujourd hui    la gerbe    
  comedia   and   je suis partout   
listen to daxiat 
 the montmartre theatre
has changed its management 
but not its spirit 
its new play is a hazy vignette  
 hazy   sure   
he missed the beginning 
 colorless   
and apolitical  it deliberately
ignores our real problems  
naturally 
 mrs steiner maintains   
the tradition of jewish nihilism   
which has always polluted
that theatre 
the play says nothing about jews 
yet  it reeks of jewishness 
as to the staging
by jean loup cottins   
it is merely an effeminate version
of lucas steiner s style  
hear  hear 
 what can i say
about marion steiner s performance 
it s all pathos 
but unfit for the stage 
back to the movies  mrs  
see 
 the only revelation
is bernard granger    
 he creates a totally
convincing character 
a star is born  
at last 
it s not funny 
no  but the other reviews are good 
with the booking we ve got 
the play s a winner 
thanks to you  marion 
your film fans come to see you
in the play 
    the jewish nihilism
which polluted that theatre  
he signed it  but it reads like
an anonymous letter 
you re right 
daxiat and company
have the same poisonous motives 
before  they were nobodies   
now  they rule the country 
but for how long 
look at this passage   
it s about you 
me 
yes   
look here   
 not content to monopolize
our stage and screen   
the jews steal
our most beautiful women  
they sound cheerful 
it s a private party 
the director of the  hebertot 
wants to meet you 
miss bataille   
mr daxiat   
bravo  congratulations 
you were fantastic 
your article was outrageous 
apologize to mrs steiner 
certainly not 
you ll apologize
to the whole cast 
i won t fight 
let s go outside 
you re insane 
this is absurd 
you re ridiculous 
apologize to mrs steiner 
apologize 
i won t apologize for doing my job 
i won t fight 
yes  you will 
i refuse to fight 
i m not a prize fighter 
i m a journalist 
you re irresponsible 
how could you do this to us 
what about my theatre 
what about our play 
all you care about is your theatre 
 how are the bookings  
 will we do a matinee at xmas  
yes  the theatres are full now 
but so are the jails 
listen  we ll go on
playing together 
but offstage 
don t you dare speak to me 
 you re lovely   
so lovely
it s painful to look at you  
 you said it was a joy  
 lt is a joy   
yet it s painful  
look at this   
lt s crazy 
now that the play s working out   
you can relax 
why look at me that way   
at times  i feel you hate me 
not at all   
i d be crazy to hate you 
you are a little crazy 
i know you by heart 
i know you too 
for me 
that play belongs to the past 
i ve got a new project 
 the magic mountain    
with a great role for you 
are you listening 
yes 
it s about a cruel woman   
me    cruel 
no  the character 
she s gentle  tender 
in love  and yet   
she s cruel 
she doesn t mean to be   
she s cruel despite herself 
cruel 
it ll be wonderful 
no literature 
we ll use everyday language 
i ll use your own words  you see 
i see that from now on  everything
i say may be held against me 
mr daxiat 
over there 
i was reluctant to come 
but with you  one doesn t know   
whether it s an appointment 
or a summons 
apparently 
you misread my review   
was that a review 
i d say it was a vicious attack 
assuming it was  it wasn t
aimed at you  on the contrary   
across all the columns   
and don t forget
the exclamation mark 
i went to the theatre
expecting to see a play   
directed by jean loup cottins 
instead  i saw a nondescript show   
with no style 
i felt you were merely a front   
and worse yet   
a mouth piece for a fugitive 
normally  i d answer in kind 
but as it is  i ll just go 
wait   
i ve got a proposition for you 
whatever it is  my answer is no 
i want you to help me save
the  montmartre  
steiner turned it over to his wife
before running away   
i found out
the transaction is illegal   
because the transfer
was ante dated 
this kind of transaction is labelled
a  fictitious aryanization  
meaning what 
it means that legally  the theatre
doesn t belong to anyone   
and the germans can requisition it 
unless   
unless what 
unless it is taken over
by someone they approve of 
daxiat didn t beat about the bush 
he proposed that they share
the management   
he d select the plays 
jean loup would direct 
i assume jean loup refused 
no  he didn t  he couldn t 
all he could do
was to stall for time 
the only way to fight daxiat
is to appeal to a higher up
like dr dietrich 
but jean loup refuses to do it 
dr dietrich  please 
on the first floor 
you ll have to wait 
dr dietrich  please 
that s impossible 
i called him 
he s expecting me 
what s your name 
marion steiner 
i see you ve got a 5 p  m 
appointment   
but it s impossible 
i don t mind waiting 
i m sorry 
it s useless to wait 
dr dietrich left
for the eastern front 
he was recalled for active duty 
then  that s that 
mrs steiner 
i d like a word with you 
i m an admirer of yours   
i am lieutenant berger 
about dr dietrich   
he s not on the eastern front 
he shot himself last night 
it s tragic   
he admired you enormously   
and so do i 
it s an honor to shake your hand 
i must speak to you 
i m sorry 
but it s absolutely necessary 
i m leaving the theatre 
but i ll give you time to find
another actor 
i should have expected this 
no  it s not what you think   
you can t forgive my row
with daxiat   
and i understand your reaction 
but even if you won t speak to me 
we are a good acting team 
i love the play and i love my role 
so it s not that 
there s no need to justify yourself 
i m not even sure
we ll replace you   
the theatre
may soon be shut down 
i suppose you got a better offer
from hebertot 
no  it s not for hebertot
or any other theatre 
i m temporarily giving up acting   
to join the resistance 
 helena  i wish to speak to mr carl
in private  
 if it s about my son   
i have the right to listen  
civil defense 
cellar inspection 
 mr carl  isn t it unfair 
as eric s mother 
i have the right to know  
 frankly  dr sanders   
this is embarrassing  
 never mind  mr carl 
helena  please do as i say  
 since you insist  i ll leave  
 this is what happened 
last october  she went for a walk   
and simply disappeared  
it s for the cellar 
  the cellar 
  yes 
out of the question 
 when she came back 
she was unable   
to tell us where she d been  
 was she amnesic  
 i suppose so  
put them in a side box 
follow me 
 you re right   
helena s dependency on me
may seem peculiar 
she behaves like a child 
her gratitude is excessive  
 at times  she seems too humble  
 why she feels guilty 
i don t know 
but whatever it is  it leads her   
to seek the affection
of her inferiors 
charles henri
was bewildered by it 
and then the tragedy occured  
 what tragedy  
 i know dr sanders   
came back before
charles henri s death  
d you know them 
civil defense 
no  they re gestapo men 
i know one of them 
gestapo 
  will you help me 
  yes 
but no questions 
 love is painful 
like a bird of prey 
it hovers over us   
as if to threaten us 
but it is also a promise
of happiness 
you re so lovely  helena   
that it s painful to look at you  
 you said it was a joy  
 it is a joy and it s painful  
no curtain calls tonight 
what s up 
it s civil defense   
to inspect the cellar 
this is bernard granger 
bernard    my husband 
don t just stand there  you ve got
to conceal all this and hide 
take us to the cellar 
no    wait for mrs steiner 
i m going in 
no  she s not dressed 
let s be gentlemanly 
so i made a mistake 
be patient 
i ll be right out 
i never go down there 
it s probably full of rats 
have you got the key 
watch your heads 
seems to me it s not deep enough
for a shelter 
there s about 8 
between the ceiling and the yard 
what s this 
we used it in  the cherry orchard  
there s only room for 40 people 
in any case 
it s been condemned since 39 
during air raids 
we use the subway 
the local station is open all night 
can we use that staircase
for firewood 
there are so many air raids now   
nobody bothers to go down 
well  they cleared out   
till the next time 
this is a hell of a life 
it s a life    it s my life 
can t you find
a better hiding place 
i don t want one 
this is my place   
and this is where i stay 
my wife is beautiful 
isn t she 
let me ask you a question 
she s in love with you 
but do you love her 
 i m coming to love and it hurts 
i m coming to love and it hurts 
is love painful  
 yes  love is painful 
like birds of prey 
it hovers over us   
as if to threaten us 
but it is a promise of happiness 
you re so lovely   
that it s painful to look at you  
 you said it was a joy  
 it is a joy and it s painful  
bernard  may i ask you something 
were you going to leave
without saying goodbye 
of course not   
i was waiting
for the rehearsal to end 
well  it s over now  it was sad   
i watched it 
well 
he was good 
it s a lesson in humility 
we re all expendable 
well  goodbye bernard   
i felt you were interested
in all women   
except for me 
first  it s not all women   
and you intimidated me 
you seemed to disapprove of me 
at times 
you were downright hostile 
hostile 
yes  i felt you were judging me 
it s just the opposite 
i was so attracted to you   
that i covered up
so nobody would notice   
and i made you hate me 
that s not true 
i never hated you 
but why did you act so distant
after you d kissed me 
all actors kiss each other 
but not on the mouth 
i kissed you on the mouth 
yes   
on opening night 
i couldn t have 
you kissed me on the mouth 
i know  you see two women in me 
i do 
i see two women in you 
one who no longer
loves her husband   
no  don t   
you wouldn t understand 
don t forget your make up 
i won t need it 
i ll leave it for my successor 
i won t be using any make up 
but you may need a disguise 
forgive me   
and so  lucien ballard
took over the part of carl 
nadine marsac  now famous 
rushes off
right after her final lines 
a chauffeur drives her
to the studios   
where they re shooting
 angels of mercy  at night 
arlette guillaume
is the art director of the film 
in june 1944 
the allies land in normandy 
despite the daily hardships   
parisians keep on crowding
the theatres 
one night   
ignoring the sirens   
the audience stood outside   
to watch the ballet
of the raf planes in the sky 
many theatres are shut down
for lack of electricity 
thanks to raymond s ingenuity 
the  montmartre  remains open 
he s replaced the footlights
by auto headlights
germany s defeat
is now inevitable 
after 813 days and nights
in his dark cellar   
lucas steiner is impatient
to see daylight 
the street   
is a scene of confusion
and sporadic shooting 
no   
not there 
it s a hectic period for jean loup 
arrested by the f f i  
he is released
thanks to his connections   
but re arrested the next day
because of his connections 
as for daxiat 
he is a man on the run 
the one time press lord
is now a pariah 
he s survived the bombing
of hamburg 
after following petain to germany   
he reaches spain
via a series of monasteries 
sentenced to death in absentia 
he will die of a cancer
in the  60 s 
but let us go back
to the summer of 1944   
and to our story 
i tried to forget you  i couldn t 
if not for your pride 
i d have come sooner 
you d have had to make up
a lie each time you came 
why should i lie  and to whom 
he s dead now 
but you ve got your career   
no  i realized i didn t care
about it anymore   
i gave it all up 
the only thing that matters to me   
is to be with you 
to get you out of here 
we can start all over again 
no we can t 
there was never anything   
anything real   
between us 
i toyed with the idea   
but i never really loved you 
it was an abstract notion 
you believed in it
because i believed it myself 
i never stopped thinking of you   
not even for a day 
i thought of you too   
but less and less often 
and now  i don t know
what you re doing here 
i ve almost forgotten your name   
i barely remember
the way you look 
go away 
listen to me 
listen carefully 
it takes two to love   
as it takes two to hate 
and i ll go on loving you 
you make my heart beat faster 
nothing else matters to me
