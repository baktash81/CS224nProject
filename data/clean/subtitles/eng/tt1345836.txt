someone inspires us the way he did
i believed in harvey dent
dr pavel im cia
he wasnt alone
uh you dont get to bring friends
they are not my friends
dont worry no charge for them
cia op and why would i want them
they were trying to grab your prize
they work for the mercenary
the masked man
bane
aye
get them on board ill call it in
cia op the flight plan i
just filed with the agency
lists me my men
dr pavel here
but only one of you
first one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft
who paid you to grab dr pavel
he didnt fly so good
who wants to try next
tell me about bane
why does he wear the mask
a lot of loyalty for a hired gun
well perhaps hes wondering why
someone would shoot a man
before throwing
him out of a plane
at least you can talk
who are you
it doesnt matter who we are
what matters is our plan
no one cared who i was
till i put on the mask
if i pull that off will you die
it would be extremely painful
youre a big guy
for you
was getting caught
part of your plan
of course
dr pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours
we had to find out what he told you
nothing i said nothing
well congratulations
you got yourself caught
sir
now whats the next step of your master plan
crashing this plane
with no survivors
mayday mayday
aah what you doing to me
let me out
no
no no no no
no they expect one of us
in the wreckage brother
have we started the fire
yes the fire rises
calm down doctor
now is not the time for fear
that comes later
or harvey dent day may not be
our oldest public holiday
but were here tonight because
its one of the most important
harvey dents uncompromising stand
against organized crime
had made gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death eight years ago
this city has seen a
historic turnaround
no city is without crime but
this city is without organized
crime because the dent act
gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob
now people are talking about
repealing the dent act
and to them i say
not on my watch
i want to thank the wayne
foundation for hosting this event
im told mr wayne couldnt be here tonight
im sure hes with us in spirit
and now im gonna give way
to an important voice
you ever lay eyes on wayne
at one of these things
no one has not in years
people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape
a thug who showed
his true nature
when he betrayed the
trust of this great man
and murdered him in cold blood
sweetheart
not so fast with the chow
shrimp balls
thank you
jim gordon can tell you the truth about
harvey dent ill let him tell you himself
commissioner gordon
the truth
i have
written a speech
telling the truth
about harvey dent
maybe the time isnt right
maybe right now
all you need to know is that there are
1000 inmates in blackgate prison
as a direct result of the dent act
these are violent criminals essential
cogs in the organizedcrime machine
maybe for now all i should say about
the death of harvey dent is this
it has not been for nothing
maid 1 you see the guy who owns the house
maid 2 no i heard
he never leaves the east wing
i heard he had an accident
yeah that hes disfigured he has to wear a
mr till
why are your people using
the main staircase
and wheres mrs bolton
uh shes at the bar sir
can i help
the east drawing room
unlock the door put the tray on the table
lock the door again nothing more
ed im sorry miss tate i tried
but he wont see you
and you mustnt take it personally
everyone knows that waynes holed
up in there with 8inch nails
peeing into mason jars
its very good of you to
let me on the grounds
why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man
who threw away your investment on
some savetheworld vanity project
he cant get your
money back i can
i could try explaining that a
savetheworld project vain or not
is worth investing in
mr daggett
but you understand only money and
the power you think it buys
so why waste my time indeed
on second shift reports in
you should spend more time with the mayor
well thats your department
anyone shown him the crime stats
he goes by his gut and it bothers him
no matter what the numbers
must be popular with his wife
not really she took the kids to cleveland
hell have plenty of time for visits
the mayors gonna dump him in the spring
really
mmhm
but hes a hero
a war hero this is peacetime
oh sorry sorry
im so terribly sorry mr wayne
it is mr wayne isnt it
although you dont have the long nails or
heh the facial scars sir
is that what they say about me
its just that no
one ever sees you
thats a beautiful necklace reminds
me of one that belonged to my mother
it cant be the same one
because her pearls
are in this safe
the manufacturer
clearly explained
is uncrackable
oops
nobody told me it was uncrackable
im afraid i cant
let you take those
look you wouldnt beat up a woman any
more than i would beat up a cripple
of course sometimes
exceptions have to be made
good night mr wayne
can i have a ride
you read my mind
lets go
miss tate was asking
to see you again
shes very persistent
and quite lovely
in case you were wondering
i wasnt
what are you doing
examining print dust weve been robbed
and this is your idea of uh
sounding the alarm is it
she took the pearls
tracking device and all
she
one of the maids
perhaps you should stop letting
them in this side of the house
perhaps you should start
learning to make your own bed
why were you dusting for prints
i wasnt
she was
sir congressman gillys
wife has been calling in
the congressman never made it home
after the wayne foundation event
thats a job for the police
when you and dent cleaned the streets
you cleaned them good
pretty soon well be chasing down
uh overdue library books
and yet here you are
like were still at war
whats your name son
blake sir
you have something
you want to ask me
its about that night this night
eight years ago the night dent died
the last confirmed
sighting of the batman
he murders those people
takes down two swat teams
breaks dents neck
and then just vanishes
im not hearing a question son
dont you want to know who he was
i know exactly who he was
he was the batman
lets go see about the
congressmans wife
master wayne
master wayne
you havent been down
here in a long time
trying to find out more about
ourjewel thief i ran her prints
unless shes lost
a lot of weight
she was wearing someone
elses fingerprints
shes good
she may be but we have
a trace on the necklace
we do i crossreferenced the
address she went back to
with police data on
highend bandes and um
selina kyle
the databases are full of closecalls
tips from fences
shes good but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet
we should send the police
before she fences the pearls
she wont she likes them too much
and they werent
what she was after
what was she after
my fingerprints
it was printer toner mixed
with graphite on the safe
it gives a good pull
and its untraceable
fascinating you two should
exchange notes over coffee
youre trying to set me
up with a jewel thief
at this point id set you up with a chimpanzee
if it brought you back to the world
theres nothing out there for me
and thats the problem
you hung up your cape and your
cowl but you didnt move on
you never went to find a life
to find someone
alfred
i did find someone
i know and you lost them
but thats all part of living sir
but youre not living youre just waiting
hoping for things to go bad again
remember when you left gotham
before all this before batman
you were gone seven years
seven years i waited
hoping that you wouldnt come back
every year i took a holiday
i went to florence
theres this caf on the banks of the arno
every fine evening id sit there
and order a fernet branca
i had this fantasy
that i would look
across the tables
and id see you there
with a wife
maybe a couple of kids
you wouldnt say anything to me
nor me to you
but wed both know
that youd made it
that you were happy
i never wanted you to
come back to gotham
i always knew there was nothing here
for you except pain and tragedy
and i wanted something
more for you than that
i still do
dwp man they wash up here a
couple of times a month
more when it gets colder
homeless sheltering
in the tunnels
we pulled him from the basin
but other than that we didnt touch him
what
names jimmy
hes from st swithins
its the boys home where i coach some ball
ly jimmy hadnt been around for months
no why
blake you know why
he aged out we dont have the
resources to keep boys on after 16
i thought the wayne foundation
gave money for that
not for the past couple of years
he has a brother here doesnt he
mark ill tell him
id like to if thats all right
you know what he was doing in the tunnels
lot of guys been going down
the tunnels when they age out
say you can live down there
say theres work down there
work
what kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers
more than you can
find up here i guess
so you know about him
of course
do you think hes coming back
i dont know
you brought a date
i like having someone
around to open doors for me
right hand no partials
very nice
mmhm
not so fast handsome
you got something for me
ah yes
i dont know what youre planning
to do with mr waynes prints
but im guessing
youll need his thumb
you dont count so good huh
i count fine
in fact im counting
to 10 right now
okay
my friends outside
just hit send
this place is a little dead
itll liven up in a minute
trust me
is everything okay
great catch you later
hmm
it would have been a lot easier
to just give me what we agreed
we cant have loose ends
and even in that dress
no ones gonna miss you
no
but my friend over there
every cop in the
citys missing him
thats cute
but theyre not gonna be
looking in a place like this
i dont know you did
just use his cell phone
swat 1 go swat 2 go
police get down now
help me help me
help me please please help me
keep some pressure on that
sweetheart

hes bleeding you gotta help him
i got the congressman
clear
manhole get this up get the dwp down here
you three down with me
you two you go down cover the next exit
what they went down there

that was a gas explosion kid
wasnt gas its a sewer
no one goes in till we know whats there
we know sir
the police commissioner
someone get this
hothead out of here
and wheres that dwp guy
why are you here
answer him
i was asking you
its the police commissioner
and you brought him down here
mercenary 1 we didnt know what to do
you panicked
and your weakness has cost
the lives of three others
no hes alone
search him
then i will kill you
hes dead
so show me his body
the water runs to any one of the outflows
wed never find him
follow him mercenary 2 follow him
you okay you okay
hey hey you awake
i need to see bruce wayne
im sorry mr wayne doesnt
take unscheduled calls
even from a police officer
and if i go get a warrant for the
investigation of harvey dents murder
that still count as unscheduled
what can i do for you officer
commissioner gordons been shot
he chased a gunman down into the sewers
when i pulled him out he was
babbling about an underground army
a masked man called bane
shouldnt you be telling
your superior officers
they asked me if he saw
any giant alligators
he needs you
he needs the batman
if commissioner gordon thinks
oh he doesnt know or care who you are
but weve met before
it was a long time ago
i was a kid uh st swithins
it used to be funded by the wayne
foundation its an orphanage
my mom died when i was small it was a
car accident i dont really remember it
but my dad got shot a couple years
later over a gambling debt
and i remember
that one just fine
not a lot of people know
what it feels like do they
to be angry
in your bones
i mean they understand
foster parents
everybody understands
for a while
and then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he cant do
move on
so after a while they stop understanding
they send the angry
kid to a boys home
i figured it out too late
you gotta learn to hide the anger
practice smiling in a mirror
its like putting on a mask
so you showed up this one day
in a cool car
pretty girl on your arm
we were so excited
bruce wayne billionaire orphan
i mean we used to make up
stories about you man legends
and you know with the other kids
thats all it was just stories but
right when i saw you
i knew who you really were
id seen that look
on your face before
its the same one i taught myself
i dont know why you took the
fall for dents murder
but im still a
believer in the batman
even if youre not
why did you say that your boys home used
to be funded by the wayne foundation
because the money stopped
might be time to get some fresh air
start paying attention to the details
some of those details might need your help
you check that name bane
hes a mercenary no other known names
him and his men were behind
a coup in west africa
that secured mining operations
for our friend john daggett
now daggetts brought them here
or so it seems
ill keep digging
yeah
alfred why did the wayne foundation
stop funding boys homes in the city
the foundation is funded by the
profits of wayne enterprises
there have to be some
time to talk to mr fox i think
ill get him on the phone
no no no do we still have
any cars around the place
yes one or two
i need an appointment at
the hospital for my leg
which hospital
whichever one jim gordons in
i have seen worse cartilage in knees
thats good
no thats because there is
no cartilage in your knee
and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders
between that and the scar
tissue on your kidneys
the residual concussive
damage to your brain tissue
and the general scarredover
quality of your body
i cannot recommend that you go heliskiing
right
we were in this together
then you were gone
the batman wasnt needed anymore
we won
based on a lie
and now theres evil rising
from where we tried to bury it
the batman has to come back
what if he doesnt exist anymore
he must
you took my goddamn wallet
didnt you
you f you took my wallet
no i
get out
she took my ah
now
creep
i dont know what hes so upset about
theres only 60 bucks in here
probably the watch
whos that
a stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car
no thats bruce wayne
mr wayne over here
im not sure if my assistant
right through here
thank you so much
bruce wayne at a charity ball
miss tate isnt it
even before you became a recluse
you never came to these things
the proceeds go to the big fat spread
its not about charity
its about feeding the ego of
whichever society hag laid this on
actually this is my party
mr wayne
oh
and the proceeds will go where
they should because i paid
for the big fat spread myself
thats very generous of you
you have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world
take our cleanenergy project
sometimes the investment doesnt pay off
im sorry
you have a practiced apathy mr wayne
but a man who doesnt care about the world
doesnt spend half his fortune to save it
and isnt so wounded
when it fails
that he goes into hiding
have a good evening mr wayne
mind if i cut in
thank you
you dont seem happy to see me
you were supposed to be a shutin
i felt like some fresh air
why didnt you call the police
i have a powerful friend who
deals with things like this
thats a brazen costume
for a cat burglar
yeah who are you pretending to be
bruce wayne eccentric billionaire
whos your date
his wifes in ibiza
she left her diamonds behind though
worried they might get stolen
its pronounced ibiza
you wouldnt want these folks realizing
youre a crook not a social climber
you think i care what anyone
in this room thinks of me
i doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you
dont condescend mr wayne
you dont know a thing about me
well selina kyle i know you came
here from your walkup in old town
a modest place for a
master jewel thief
which means that either youre
saving for retirement
or youre in deep
with the wrong people
you dont get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of wayne manor
actually i was born in the regency room
i started out doing what i had to
once youve done what you had to
they never let you do what you want to
start fresh
ugh theres no fresh
start in todays world
any 12yearold with a cell phone
could find out what you did
everything we do is collated and
quantified everything sticks
is that how you justify stealing
i take what i need from those
who have more than enough
i dont stand on the shoulders
of people with less
robin hood
i think id do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room than you
you think maybe youre
assuming a little too much
maybe youre being unrealistic about whats
really in your pants other than your wallet
ouch
you think all this can last
theres a storm coming mr wayne
you and your friends better batten down
the hatches because when it hits
youre all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large
and leave so little
for the rest of us
you sound like youre looking forward to it
im adaptable
those pearls do look better on
you than they did in my safe
but i still cant
let you keep them
you you scared her off
not likely
must have lost my ticket
your wife said you were taking a cab home
my wife
just you sir
dont worry master wayne
takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things
bruce wayne as i live and breathe
what brings you out of
cryosleep mr wayne
you havent lost
your sense of humor
even if you have lost
most of my money
actually you did that
if you funnel your
entire r and d budget
into a fusion project
that you then mothball
your company is
unlikely to thrive
what are my options
well if youre unwilling
to turn on the machine
i cant i cant lucius
well then sit tight
your majority keeps
daggett at bay
while we figure out a future for
the energy program with miranda tate
she has supported the project all the way
shes smart and quite lovely
we all just want whats
best for you bruce
show her the machine
ill think it over
anything else
nope ww
these conversations used to
end with an unusual request
i retired
mmhm well let me show
you some stuff anyway
just for old times sake
i figured youd have shut this place down
oh it was always shut down
officially
all this new stuff
after your father died wayne enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries
for years ive been
shuttering and consolidating
all the different
prototypes under one roof
my roof
why
keep them from falling into the wrong hands
oh now youre just showing off
defense department projects for
tight geometry urban pacification
rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation
whats it called
oh it has a long uninteresting
wayne enterprises designation
i just took to calling it the bat
and yes mr wayne
it does come in black
works fine
except for the autopilot
takes a better mind
than mine to fix it
better mind
well i was trying to be modest
a less busy mind
yours
is it really painful
youre very welcome to try it alfred
happy watching thank you sir
not bad
not bad at all
if youre seriously considering
going back out there
you should hear the
rumors surrounding bane
im all ears
there is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world
a pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die
but sometimes a man rises from the darkness
sometimes the pit
sends something back
bane
bane
born and raised in hell on earth
born in a prison
no one knows why or how he escaped
but they do know
that once he did
he was trained by ras al ghul
your mentor
bane was a member of the league of shadows
and then he was excommunicated
and any man who is too extreme for
ras al ghul is not to be trifled with
i didnt realize i was known
for trifling with criminals
that was then
and you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on
but that doesnt make you what you were
if this man is everything that you
say he is then the city needs me
the city needs bruce wayne
your resources your knowledge
it doesnt need your body
or your life
that times past
youre afraid that if i go
back out there ill fail
no
im afraid that you want to
you cant short the stock because
bruce wayne goes to a party
wayne coming back is change
change is either good or bad i vote bad
on what basis
i flipped a coin
it says rye i said no rye man
hey rookie lose the helmet
we need faces for camera
come on lets go scalping

like a rat in a trap gentlemen
you might have the wrong animal there sir
you sure it was him
er bane says the batman interfered
but the task was accomplished
what about the men they arrested
he said and i quote
âothey would die before talking
where does he find these guys
open the champagne
and can we get some girls in here
careful what you wish for
cat got your tongue
you dumb bitch
nobody ever accused me of being dumb
youre dumb for
coming here tonight
i want what you owe me
want doesnt get
nice outfit those heels
make it tough to walk
i dont know
aah
do they
so where is it
wheres what
the program the clean slate
the ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record
hold it right there
where is it
the clean slate
where you type in someones name
date of birth
in a few minutes theyre gone
from every database on earth
sound a little too good to be true
youre lying
rykin data took it
to prototype stage
thats why i bought them
but they had nothing
it was a gangland myth
stay back
im not bluffing
they know
they just dont care
youve gotta be kidding me
no guns no killing
wheres the fun in that
my mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men
this isnt a car
see you around
youre welcome
i had it under control
those werent street thugs
they were trained killers
i saved your life
in return i need to know what you
did with bruce waynes fingerprints
wayne wasnt kidding
about a powerful friend
i sold his prints to daggett
for something that
doesnt even exist
i doubt many people get the better of you
hey when a girls desperate
whats he gonna do with them
i dont know
but daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market
miss kyle
so thats what that feels like
i see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back
i retrieved this
arent the police supposed
to be investigating then
they dont have the tools to analyze it
they would if you gave them to them
one mans tool is
another mans weapon
in your mind perhaps but there arent
many things you cant turn into a weapon
alfred enough the police
werent getting it done
perhaps they might have if you
hadnt made a sideshow of yourself
you thought i didnt have it in me
you led a bloated police force on a chase
with a load of fancy
new toys from fox
what about when you come
up against him what then
ill fight harder i always have
look his speed his ferocity his training
i see the power of belief
i see the league of
shadows resurgent
you said he was excommunicated
by ras ai ghul
who leads them now
ras al ghul was the league
of shadows and i beat him
bane is a mercenary
we need to find out what hes up to
trades of some kind coded
and my fingerprint
courtesy of selina kyle
get this to fox
he can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing
ill get this to mr fox
but no more
ive sewn you up ive set your bones
but i wont bury you
ive buried enough members
of the wayne family
youll leave me
you see only one end to your journey
leaving is all i have
to make you understand
youre not batman anymore
you have to find another way
you used to talk about finishing
about a life beyond that awful cave
alfred rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together
that was my life beyond the cave
i cant just move on
she she didnt she couldnt
what if she had
she i cant change that
what if before she died
she wrote a letter
saying she chose harvey dent over you
and what if
to spare you pain
i burnt that letter
how dare you use rachel
to try to stop me
i am using the truth master wayne
maybe its time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day
im sorry
youre sorry
you expect to destroy my world
and then think that
were gonna shake hands
no no no
i know what this means
what does it mean
it means your hatred
and it also means losing someone
that i have cared for
since i first heard
his cries echo
through this house
but it might also
mean saving your life
and that is more important
goodbye alfred
alfred
answering your own door
yeah
page three
seems you made a series of large put
options on the futures exchange
verified by thumbprint
those options expired
at midnight last night
longterm we may be able to prove fraud
but for now youre completely broke
and wayne enterprises is about to
fall into the hands of john daggett
the weapons we cant let daggett
get his hands on applied sciences
applied sciences is all
locked up and off the books
the energy project however
is a different story
miranda tate
lets convince the board to get behind her
lets show her the reactor
were meeting her there in 35 minutes
so you better get dressed
you brought me out here
to show me this mr fox
bear with me miss tate
please keep hands and feet
inside the car at all times
this is it isnt it
the reactor is beneath the river
so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach
is bruce wayne
really that paranoid
im gonna plead the
fifth on that one
i thought you might like to see
what your investment built
no fossil fuels
free clean energy
for an entire city
da three years ago a russian
scientist published a paper
on weaponized fusion reactions
one week later your reactor
started developing problems
i think this machine works
miranda if it were operational
the danger to gotham would be too great
would it make you feel better to
know that the russian scientist
died in a plane
crash six months ago
someone will work out
what dr pavel did
someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon
i need you to take control

when you started why the mask
to protect the people closest to me
but you were a loner right
you didnt have any family
there are always people you care about
you just dont realize how
much until theyre gone
the idea was to be a symbol
batman could be anybody
that was the point
well it was damn good to see him back
not everybody agrees
theyll figure that out in the end

yeah i got 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight
i could use some help actually
you know what drop me in old town

more than youve got right now

me keep the house
the rich dont even go broke the
same as the rest of us huh
my powerful friend might hope to
change your mind about leaving

sir that could also be a coincidence
youre a detective now son
youre not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore
nobodys answering

im on my own now
do you have keys
never needed them
hope you didnt like
me for my money
suffering builds character
ill take care of your
parents legacy bruce
whos this
wheres alfred
he left
taking everything
whats that
my powers been shut off
youre good at that
when i was a child we had almost nothing
but on the nights when we had a fire
we felt very rich indeed
i assumed your family was wealthy
not always
not when i was young
an old mistake
ive made a few myself
more than a few
we could leave
tonight
take my plane
go anywhere we wanted
someday perhaps
not tonight
dont be shy
wayne says you can get me the clean slate
that depends
on what
on what you want it for
i acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands
still dont trust me huh
how can we change that
start by taking me to bane
you asked
from here banes men patrol the tunnels
and theyre not your
average brawlers
neither am i
hes behind you
who
me
what do you think youre
just a little further
i had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me
you made a serious mistake
not as serious as yours i fear
bane
lets not stand on ceremony here
mr wayne
peace has cost you your strength
victory has defeated you
theatricality and deception
powerful agents to the uninitiated
but we are initiated
arent we bruce
members of the league of shadows
and you betrayed us
us you were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths
i am the league of shadows
and im here to fulfill
ras al ghuls destiny
you fight like a younger man
nothing held back
admirable but mistaken
oh you think
darkness is your ally
but you merely adopted the dark
i was born in it
molded by it
i didnt see the light
until i was already a man
by then it was nothing to me but blinding
the shadows betray you
because they belong to me
i will show you where i have made my home
whilst preparing
to bring justice
then i will break you
your precious armory
gratefully accepted
we will need it
ah yes i was wondering
what would break first
your spirit
or your body
get me commissioner gordon i got a
line on the congressmans kidnapping
excuse me miss
uh yes
im gonna need to see your ticket
and identification please
oh do you mind
i showed your picture to the
congressman guess what
dont tell me still in love
oh head over heels
pressing charges though
youve made some mistakes
ms kyle
girls gotta eat
and you have an appetite
why would you run you cant
hide with a record like this
maybe its not you
im running from
who then bane
what do you know about him
that you should be as afraid of him as i am
we can offer you protection
okay
when i spotted you i was looking
for a friend of mine bruce wayne
did they kill him
im not sure
why didnt you just
kill me
you dont fear death
you welcome it
your punishment
must be more severe
torture
yes
but not of your body
of your soul
where am i
home
where i learned the
truth about despair
as will you
there is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth
hope
every man who has rotted
here over the centuries
has looked up to the light and
imagined climbing to freedom
so easy
so simple
and like shipwrecked men turning to
seawater from uncontrollable thirst
many have died trying
i learned here there can be
no true despair without hope
so as i terrorize gotham
i will feed its people
hope to poison their souls
i will let them believe
that they can survive
so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun
you can watch me
torture an entire city
and then when you have truly
understood the depth of your failure
we will fulfill
ras al ghuls destiny
we will destroy gotham
and then when it is done
and gotham is
ashes
then you have my
permission to die
youre locking her up in here
the dent act allows nonsegregation
based on extraordinary need
first time she broke out of
womens correctional she was 16
little closer baby
why honey you wanna hold my hand
shes gonna be fine
i still dont see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project
bruce got a lot of things right
keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them
how good of you to join us
chair president
all i need now is one more
ordinary board member
mr fox would you
like to nominate
no
i will volunteer
where are you taking us
you were right commissioner
will you excuse us please
what happened
your masked man kidnapped
the wayne enterprises board
he let most of them go
but he took three into the sewers
no more patrols
no more hide and seek
get every available cop down
there and smoke him out
the mayor wont want panic
so its a training exercise
im sorry i didnt
take you seriously
not you
youre telling me
the batmans gone
so you chase up the daggett
leads any way you can
yes sir
he asks how much you would
pay us to let you die
i told him i told
him you have nothing
do it for the pleasure
they pay me more than
that to keep you alive
he will try the climb
has anyone ever made it
of course not
he says there is one who did
a child
a child born in this hell
bane
an old legend nothing more
dont
whatever it is they want you to see
its happening soon
fire in the hole
turn it on
i only need one other board member
there are eight others waiting
i wont do it
all right stop
lucius youll kill this man
and yourself
and youll barely
slow them down
go on then do your work
take them up to the surface
people of their status
deserve to experience the
next era of western civilization
ke ive been to half of daggetts
cement plants and locations
they poured underground
gordon anything strange about the pourings
honestly commissioner i dont know
anything about civil engineering
but you know about patterns keep looking
l its done
this is now a 4megaton
nuclear bomb
pull the core out of the reactor
no you cannot
this is the only power source
capable of sustaining it
if you move it the core will
decay in a matter of months
five by my calculations
and then it will go off
and for the sake of your children
dr pavel
indeed i hope it does
hey hey
that was you in front of the
stock exchange wasnt it
when
when
when cops were trying to pull onto castle
street and your truck was shutting them out
oh yeah youre the cop

and uh as a detective were not
allowed to believe in coincidence
what were you doing here
what are you working on
commissioner its blake

of questions call me whenev
