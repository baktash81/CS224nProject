someone inspires us the way he did 
i believed in harvey dent 
dr  pavel  i m cia 
he wasn t alone 
  uh  you don t get to bring friends 
  they are not my friends 
don t worry  no charge for them 
  cia op  and why would i want them 
  they were trying to grab your prize 
they work for the mercenary 
the masked man 
  bane 
  aye 
get them on board  i ll call it in 
cia op  the flight plan i
just filed with the agency   
   lists me  my men 
dr  pavel here   
   but only one of you 
first one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft 
who paid you to grab dr  pavel 
he didn t fly so good 
who wants to try next 
tell me about bane 
why does he wear the mask 
a lot of loyalty for a hired gun 
well  perhaps he s wondering why
someone would shoot a man   
   before throwing
him out of a plane 
at least you can talk 
who are you 
it doesn t matter who we are 
what matters is our plan 
no one cared who i was
till i put on the mask 
if i pull that off  will you die 
it would be extremely painful 
you re a big guy 
for you 
was getting caught
part of your plan 
of course 
dr  pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours 
  we had to find out what he told you  
  nothing  i said nothing 
well  congratulations 
you got yourself caught 
  sir 
  now what s the next step of your master plan 
crashing this plane   
   with no survivors 
mayday  mayday 
aah  what you doing to me 
let me out 
no 
no  no  no  no 
no  they expect one of us
in the wreckage  brother 
have we started the fire 
yes  the fire rises 
calm down  doctor 
now is not the time for fear 
that comes later 
or  harvey dent day may not be
our oldest public holiday 
   but we re here tonight because
it s one of the most important 
harvey dent s uncompromising stand
against organized crime   
   had made gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death  eight years ago 
this city has seen a
historic turnaround 
no city is without crime  but
this city is without organized
crime because the dent act   
   gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob 
now people are talking about
repealing the dent act   
   and to them i say 
 not on my watch  
i want to thank the wayne
foundation for hosting this event 
i m told mr  wayne couldn t be here tonight 
i m sure he s with us in spirit 
and now i m gonna give way
to an important voice   
you ever lay eyes on wayne
at one of these things 
no one has  not in years 
  people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape 
a thug who showed
his true nature   
   when he betrayed the
trust of this great man   
   and murdered him in cold blood 
sweetheart 
not so fast with the chow 
  shrimp balls 
  thank you 
jim gordon can tell you the truth about
harvey dent  i ll let him tell you himself 
commissioner gordon 
the truth 
i have   
   written a speech   
   telling the truth
about harvey dent 
maybe the time isn t right 
maybe right now   
   all you need to know is that there are   
   1000 inmates in blackgate prison
as a direct result of the dent act 
these are violent criminals  essential
cogs in the organized crime machine 
maybe  for now  all i should say about
the death of harvey dent is this 
it has not been for nothing 
maid 1  you see the guy who owns the house 
maid 2  no  i heard   
    he never leaves the east wing 
  i heard he had an accident 
  yeah  that he s disfigured  he has to wear a  
  mr  till 
why are your people using
the main staircase 
and where s mrs  bolton 
uh  she s at the bar  sir 
can i help 
the east drawing room 
unlock the door  put the tray on the table 
lock the door again  nothing more 
ed  i m sorry  miss tate i tried 
but he won t see you 
and you mustn t take it personally 
everyone knows that wayne s holed
up in there with 8 inch nails   
   peeing into mason jars 
it s very good of you to
let me on the grounds 
why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man   
   who threw away your investment on
some save the world vanity project 
he can t get your
money back  i can 
i could try explaining that a
save the world project  vain or not   
   is worth investing in 
mr  daggett 
but you understand only money and
the power you think it buys   
   so why waste my time indeed 
on  second shift reports in 
you should spend more time with the mayor 
well  that s your department 
anyone shown him the crime stats 
he goes by his gut and it bothers him 
no matter what the numbers 
  must be popular with his wife 
  not really  she took the kids to cleveland 
he ll have plenty of time for visits 
the mayor s gonna dump him in the spring 
  really 
  mm hm 
  but he s a hero 
  a war hero  this is peacetime 
oh  sorry  sorry 
i m so terribly sorry  mr  wayne 
it is mr  wayne  isn t it 
although you don t have the long nails or 
heh  the facial scars  sir 
is that what they say about me 
it s just that no
one ever sees you 
that s a beautiful necklace  reminds
me of one that belonged to my mother 
it can t be the same one   
   because her pearls
are in this safe   
   the manufacturer
clearly explained   
   is uncrackable 
oops 
nobody told me it was uncrackable 
i m afraid i can t
let you take those 
look  you wouldn t beat up a woman any
more than i would beat up a cripple 
of course  sometimes
exceptions have to be made 
good night  mr  wayne 
can i have a ride 
you read my mind 
let s go 
miss tate was asking
to see you again 
she s very persistent 
and quite lovely 
in case you were wondering 
  i wasn t 
  what are you doing 
examining print dust  we ve been robbed 
and this is your idea of  uh 
sounding the alarm  is it 
she took the pearls 
tracking device and all 
  she 
  one of the maids 
perhaps you should stop letting
them in this side of the house 
perhaps you should start
learning to make your own bed 
  why were you dusting for prints 
  i wasn t 
she was 
sir  congressman gilly s
wife has been calling in 
the congressman never made it home
after the wayne foundation event 
that s a job for the police 
when you and dent cleaned the streets 
you cleaned them good 
pretty soon we ll be chasing down 
uh  overdue library books 
and yet here you are 
like we re still at war 
  what s your name  son 
  blake  sir 
you have something
you want to ask me 
it s about that night  this night 
eight years ago  the night dent died 
the last confirmed
sighting of the batman 
he murders those people 
takes down two swat teams   
   breaks dent s neck
and then just vanishes 
i m not hearing a question  son 
don t you want to know who he was 
i know exactly who he was 
he was the batman 
let s go see about the
congressman s wife 
master wayne 
master wayne 
you haven t been down
here in a long time 
trying to find out more about
ourjewel thief  i ran her prints 
unless she s lost
a lot of weight   
   she was wearing someone
else s fingerprints 
she s good 
she may be  but we have
a trace on the necklace 
we do  i cross referenced the
address she went back to   
   with police data on
high end b and e s  and  um   
selina kyle 
the databases are full of close calls 
tips from fences 
she s good  but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet 
we should send the police
before she fences the pearls 
she won t  she likes them too much 
and they weren t
what she was after 
  what was she after 
  my fingerprints 
it was printer toner mixed
with graphite on the safe 
it gives a good pull
and it s untraceable 
fascinating  you two should
exchange notes over coffee 
you re trying to set me
up with a jewel thief 
at this point  i d set you up with a chimpanzee 
if it brought you back to the world 
there s nothing out there for me 
and that s the problem 
you hung up your cape and your
cowl but you didn t move on 
you never went to find a life 
to find someone 
alfred   
   i did find someone 
i know  and you lost them 
but that s all part of living  sir 
but you re not living  you re just waiting 
hoping for things to go bad again 
remember when you left gotham 
before all this  before batman 
you were gone seven years 
seven years i waited 
hoping that you wouldn t come back 
every year  i took a holiday 
i went to florence 
there s this caf   on the banks of the arno 
every fine evening i d sit there
and order a fernet branca 
i had this fantasy   
   that i would look
across the tables   
   and i d see you there 
with a wife 
maybe a couple of kids 
you wouldn t say anything to me 
nor me to you 
but we d both know
that you d made it 
that you were happy 
i never wanted you to
come back to gotham 
i always knew there was nothing here
for you  except pain and tragedy 
and i wanted something
more for you than that 
i still do 
dwp man  they wash up here a
couple of times a month 
more when it gets colder 
homeless  sheltering
in the tunnels 
we pulled him from the basin 
but other than that we didn t touch him 
  what 
  name s jimmy 
he s from st  swithin s 
it s the boys  home where i coach some ball 
ly  jimmy hadn t been around for months 
  no  why 
  blake  you know why 
he aged out  we don t have the
resources to keep boys on after 16 
i thought the wayne foundation
gave money for that 
not for the past couple of years 
  he has a brother here  doesn t he 
  mark  i ll tell him 
i d like to  if that s all right 
you know what he was doing in the tunnels 
lot of guys been going down
the tunnels when they age out 
say you can live down there 
say there s work down there 
work 
what kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers 
more than you can
find up here  i guess 
so you know about him 
of course 
do you think he s coming back 
i don t know 
you brought a date 
i like having someone
around to open doors for me 
right hand  no partials 
  very nice 
  mm hm 
not so fast  handsome 
you got something for me 
ah  yes 
i don t know what you re planning
to do with mr  wayne s prints   
   but i m guessing
you ll need his thumb 
you don t count so good  huh 
i count fine 
in fact  i m counting
to 10 right now 
okay 
my friend s outside 
just hit  send  
this place is a little dead 
it ll liven up in a minute 
trust me 
is everything okay 
great  catch you later 
hmm 
it would have been a lot easier   
   to just give me what we agreed 
we can t have loose ends 
and even in that dress 
no one s gonna miss you 
no 
but my friend over there 
every cop in the
city s missing him 
that s cute 
but they re not gonna be
looking in a place like this 
i don t know  you did
just use his cell phone 
swat 1  go  swat 2  go 
police  get down now 
help me  help me 
help me  please  please help me 
keep some pressure on that 
sweetheart 
call me 
  you okay  miss 
  he s bleeding  you gotta help him 
i got the congressman 
clear 
manhole  get this up  get the dwp down here 
you three  down with me 
you two  you go down  cover the next exit 
what  they went down there 
  we re gonna go down there  right 
  that was a gas explosion  kid 
  wasn t gas  it s a sewer 
  no one goes in till we know what s there 
we know  sir 
the police commissioner 
someone get this
hothead out of here 
and where s that dwp guy 
why are you here 
answer him 
i was asking you 
it s the police commissioner 
and you brought him down here 
  mercenary 1  we didn t know what to do 
  you panicked 
and your weakness has cost
the lives of three others 
no  he s alone 
search him 
then i will kill you 
  he s dead 
  so show me his body 
the water runs to any one of the outflows 
we d never find him 
follow him  mercenary 2  follow him 
you okay  you okay 
hey  hey  you awake 
i need to see bruce wayne 
i m sorry  mr  wayne doesn t
take unscheduled calls 
even from a police officer 
and if i go get a warrant for the
investigation of harvey dent s murder 
that still count as unscheduled 
what can i do for you  officer 
commissioner gordon s been shot 
he chased a gunman down into the sewers 
when i pulled him out  he was
babbling about an underground army 
a masked man called bane 
shouldn t you be telling
your superior officers 
they asked me if he saw
any giant alligators 
he needs you 
he needs the batman 
  if commissioner gordon thinks  
  oh  he doesn t know or care who you are 
but we ve met before 
it was a long time ago 
i was a kid  uh  st  swithin s 
it used to be funded by the wayne
foundation  it s an orphanage 
my mom died when i was small  it was a
car accident  i don t really remember it 
but my dad got shot a couple years
later over a gambling debt   
   and i remember
that one just fine 
not a lot of people know
what it feels like  do they 
to be angry   
   in your bones 
i mean  they understand 
foster parents 
everybody understands   
   for a while 
and then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can t do 
move on 
so after a while  they stop understanding 
they send the angry
kid to a boys  home 
i figured it out too late 
you gotta learn to hide the anger 
practice smiling in a mirror 
it s like putting on a mask 
so you showed up this one day 
in a cool car 
pretty girl on your arm 
we were so excited 
bruce wayne  billionaire orphan 
i mean  we used to make up
stories about you  man  legends 
and  you know  with the other kids 
that s all it was  just stories  but   
right when i saw you 
i knew who you really were 
i d seen that look
on your face before 
it s the same one i taught myself 
i don t know why you took the
fall for dent s murder   
   but i m still a
believer in the batman   
   even if you re not 
why did you say that your boys  home used
to be funded by the wayne foundation 
because the money stopped 
might be time to get some fresh air 
start paying attention to the details 
some of those details might need your help 
you check that name  bane 
he s a mercenary  no other known names 
him and his men were behind
a coup in west africa   
   that secured mining operations
for our friend john daggett 
  now daggett s brought them here 
  or so it seems 
  i ll keep digging 
  yeah 
alfred  why did the wayne foundation
stop funding boys  homes in the city 
the foundation is funded by the
profits of wayne enterprises 
there have to be some 
  time to talk to mr  fox  i think 
  i ll get him on the phone 
no  no  no  do we still have
any cars around the place 
yes  one or two 
i need an appointment at
the hospital for my leg 
  which hospital 
  whichever one jim gordon s in 
  i have seen worse cartilage in knees 
  that s good 
no  that s because there is
no cartilage in your knee 
and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders 
between that and the scar
tissue on your kidneys   
   the residual concussive
damage to your brain tissue   
   and the general scarred over
quality of your body   
    i cannot recommend that you go heli skiing 
  right 
we were in this together   
   then you were gone 
the batman wasn t needed anymore 
  we won 
  based on a lie 
and now there s evil rising
from where we tried to bury it 
the batman has to come back 
what if he doesn t exist anymore 
he must 
you took my goddamn wallet 
didn t you 
  you f   you took my wallet 
  no  i  
  get out 
  she took my   ah 
  now 
  creep 
i don t know what he s so upset about 
there s only 60 bucks in here 
probably the watch 
who s that 
a stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car 
  no  that s bruce wayne 
  mr  wayne  over here 
  i m not sure if my assistant  
  right through here 
thank you so much 
bruce wayne at a charity ball 
miss tate  isn t it 
even before you became a recluse 
you never came to these things 
the proceeds go to the big fat spread 
it s not about charity 
it s about feeding the ego of
whichever society hag laid this on 
actually  this is my party 
mr  wayne 
oh 
and the proceeds will go where
they should  because i paid
for the big fat spread myself 
that s very generous of you 
you have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world 
take our clean energy project 
sometimes the investment doesn t pay off 
  i m sorry 
  you have a practiced apathy  mr  wayne 
but a man who doesn t care about the world
doesn t spend half his fortune to save it 
and isn t so wounded
when it fails   
   that he goes into hiding 
have a good evening  mr  wayne 
mind if i cut in 
thank you 
  you don t seem happy to see me 
  you were supposed to be a shut in 
i felt like some fresh air 
why didn t you call the police 
i have a powerful friend who
deals with things like this 
that s a brazen costume
for a cat burglar 
yeah  who are you pretending to be 
bruce wayne  eccentric billionaire 
  who s your date 
  his wife s in ibiza 
she left her diamonds behind  though 
worried they might get stolen 
it s pronounced  ibiza
you wouldn t want these folks realizing
you re a crook  not a social climber 
you think i care what anyone
in this room thinks of me 
i doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you 
don t condescend  mr  wayne 
you don t know a thing about me 
well  selina kyle  i know you came
here from your walk up in old town 
a modest place for a
master jewel thief 
which means that either you re
saving for retirement   
   or you re in deep
with the wrong people 
you don t get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of wayne manor 
  actually  i was born in the regency room 
  i started out doing what i had to 
once you ve done what you had to 
they never let you do what you want to 
start fresh 
ugh  there s no fresh
start in today s world 
any 12 year old with a cell phone
could find out what you did 
everything we do is collated and
quantified  everything sticks 
is that how you justify stealing 
i take what i need from those
who have more than enough 
i don t stand on the shoulders
of people with less 
robin hood 
i think i d do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room  than you 
you think maybe you re
assuming a little too much 
maybe you re being unrealistic about what s
really in your pants other than your wallet 
ouch 
you think all this can last 
there s a storm coming  mr  wayne 
you and your friends better batten down
the hatches  because when it hits   
   you re all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large   
   and leave so little
for the rest of us 
you sound like you re looking forward to it 
i m adaptable 
those pearls do look better on
you than they did in my safe 
but i still can t
let you keep them 
you   you scared her off 
not likely 
must have lost my ticket 
  your wife said you were taking a cab home 
  my wife 
just you  sir 
don t worry  master wayne 
takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things 
bruce wayne  as i live and breathe 
what brings you out of
cryo sleep  mr  wayne 
you haven t lost
your sense of humor 
even if you have lost
most of my money 
actually  you did that 
if you funnel your
entire r and d budget   
   into a fusion project
that you then mothball   
   your company is
unlikely to thrive 
what are my options 
well  if you re unwilling
to turn on the machine   
i can t  i can t  lucius 
well  then sit tight 
your majority keeps
daggett at bay   
   while we figure out a future for
the energy program with miranda tate 
she has supported the project all the way 
she s smart  and quite lovely 
we all just want what s
best for you  bruce 
show her the machine 
i ll think it over 
anything else 
nope  ww 
these conversations used to
end with an unusual request 
i retired 
mm hm  well  let me show
you some stuff anyway 
just for old times  sake 
i figured you d have shut this place down 
oh  it was always shut down 
officially 
all this new stuff 
after your father died  wayne enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries 
for years  i ve been
shuttering and consolidating   
   all the different
prototypes under one roof 
  my roof 
  why 
keep them from falling into the wrong hands 
oh  now you re just showing off 
defense department projects for
tight geometry urban pacification 
rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation 
what s it called 
oh  it has a long  uninteresting
wayne enterprises designation 
i just took to calling it the bat 
and  yes  mr  wayne 
it does come in black 
works fine 
except for the autopilot 
takes a better mind
than mine to fix it 
better mind 
well  i was trying to be modest 
a less busy mind 
yours 
  is it really painful 
  you re very welcome to try it  alfred 
happy watching  thank you  sir 
not bad 
not bad at all 
if you re seriously considering
going back out there   
   you should hear the
rumors surrounding bane 
i m all ears 
there is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world 
a pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die 
but sometimes a man rises from the darkness 
sometimes the pit
sends something back 
  bane 
  bane 
born and raised in hell on earth 
  born in a prison 
  no one knows why  or how he escaped 
but they do know
that once he did   
   he was trained by ra s al ghul 
your mentor 
bane was a member of the league of shadows 
and then he was excommunicated 
and any man who is too extreme for
ra s al ghul is not to be trifled with 
i didn t realize i was known
for trifling with criminals 
that was then 
and you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on   
   but that doesn t make you what you were 
if this man is everything that you
say he is  then the city needs me 
the city needs bruce wayne 
your resources  your knowledge 
it doesn t need your body 
or your life 
that time s past 
you re afraid that if i go
back out there  i ll fail 
no 
i m afraid that you want to 
you can t short the stock because
bruce wayne goes to a party 
wayne coming back is change 
change is either good or bad  i vote bad 
on what basis 
i flipped a coin 
it says rye   i said no rye  man

op  he s heading back downtown 
then he s as dumb as he dresses 
close it off  gentlemen 
like a rat in a trap  gentlemen 
you might have the wrong animal there  sir 
you sure it was him 
er  bane says the batman interfered 
but the task was accomplished 
what about the men they arrested 
he said  and i quote 
â othey would die before talking  
where does he find these guys 
open the champagne 
and can we get some girls in here 
careful what you wish for 
cat got your tongue 
you dumb bitch 
nobody ever accused me of being dumb 
you re dumb for
coming here tonight 
i want what you owe me 
want doesn t get 
nice outfit  those heels
make it tough to walk 
  i don t know 
  aah 
do they 
  so where is it 
  where s what 
the program  the  clean slate  
the ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record 
hold it right there 
where is it 
the clean slate 
where you type in someone s name 
date of birth   
   in a few minutes they re gone
from every database on earth 
  sound a little too good to be true 
  you re lying 
rykin data took it
to prototype stage 
that s why i bought them 
but they had nothing 
it was a gangland myth 
stay back 
i m not bluffing 
they know 
they just don t care 
you ve gotta be kidding me 
  no guns  no killing 
  where s the fun in that 
my mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men 
this isn t a car 
see you around 
you re welcome 
i had it under control 
those weren t street thugs 
they were trained killers 
i saved your life 
in return  i need to know what you
did with bruce wayne s fingerprints 
wayne wasn t kidding
about a powerful friend 
i sold his prints to daggett   
   for something that
doesn t even exist 
  i doubt many people get the better of you 
  hey  when a girl s desperate   
  what s he gonna do with them 
  i don t know   
   but daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market 
miss kyle 
so that s what that feels like 
i see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back 
i retrieved this 
aren t the police supposed
to be investigating  then 
  they don t have the tools to analyze it 
  they would if you gave them to them 
one man s tool is
another man s weapon 
in your mind  perhaps  but there aren t
many things you can t turn into a weapon 
alfred  enough  the police
weren t getting it done 
perhaps they might have if you
hadn t made a sideshow of yourself 
  you thought i didn t have it in me 
  you led a bloated police force on a chase   
   with a load of fancy
new toys from fox 
what about when you come
up against him  what then 
  i ll fight harder  i always have 
  look  his speed  his ferocity  his training 
i see the power of belief 
i see the league of
shadows resurgent 
you said he was excommunicated 
by ra s ai ghul 
who leads them now 
ra s al ghul was the league
of shadows and i beat him 
bane is a mercenary 
we need to find out what he s up to 
trades of some kind  coded 
and my fingerprint 
courtesy of selina kyle 
get this to fox 
he can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing 
i ll get this to mr  fox 
but no more 
i ve sewn you up  i ve set your bones 
but i won t bury you 
i ve buried enough members
of the wayne family 
  you ll leave me 
  you see only one end to your journey 
leaving is all i have
to make you understand 
you re not batman anymore 
you have to find another way 
you used to talk about finishing 
about a life beyond that awful cave 
alfred  rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together 
that was my life beyond the cave 
i can t just move on 
she   she didn t  she couldn t 
what if she had 
she   i can t change that 
what if before she died
she wrote a letter   
   saying she chose harvey dent over you 
and what if   
   to spare you pain   
   i burnt that letter 
how dare you use rachel
to try to stop me 
i am using the truth  master wayne 
maybe it s time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day 
  i m sorry 
  you re sorry 
you expect to destroy my world   
   and then think that
we re gonna shake hands 
no  no  no 
i know what this means 
what does it mean 
it means your hatred 
and it also means losing someone
that i have cared for   
   since i first heard
his cries echo   
   through this house 
but it might also
mean saving your life 
and that is more important 
goodbye  alfred 
alfred 
  answering your own door 
  yeah 
page three 
seems you made a series of large put
options on the futures exchange   
   verified by thumbprint 
those options expired
at midnight last night 
long term  we may be able to prove fraud 
but for now  you re completely broke   
   and wayne enterprises is about to
fall into the hands of john daggett 
the weapons  we can t let daggett
get his hands on applied sciences 
applied sciences is all
locked up and off the books 
the energy project  however 
is a different story 
miranda tate 
let s convince the board to get behind her 
let s show her the reactor 
we re meeting her there in 35 minutes 
so you better get dressed 
you brought me out here
to show me this  mr  fox 
bear with me  miss tate 
please keep hands and feet
inside the car at all times 
this is it  isn t it 
the reactor is beneath the river   
   so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach 
is bruce wayne
really that paranoid 
i m gonna plead the
fifth on that one 
i thought you might like to see
what your investment built 
no fossil fuels 
free clean energy
for an entire city 
da  three years ago  a russian
scientist published a paper   
   on weaponized fusion reactions 
one week later  your reactor
started developing problems 
i think this machine works 
miranda  if it were operational 
the danger to gotham would be too great 
would it make you feel better to
know that the russian scientist   
   died in a plane
crash six months ago 
someone will work out
what dr  pavel did 
someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon 
i need you to take control
of wayne enterprises   
   and this reactor 
to do what with it 
nothing 
until we can guarantee its safety 
and if we can t 
decommission it  flood it 
destroy the world s best chance
for a sustainable future 
if the world s not ready  yes 
bruce  if you want to save the world 
you have to start trusting it 
i m trusting you 
doesn t count  you have no choice 
i could have flooded
this chamber at any time 
i m choosing to trust you 
please 
all right  ladies and gentlemen 
this meeting will now come to order 
i d like to point out that we
have a non board member here   
   which is highly irregular 
even if his family name is above the door 
bruce wayne s family
built this company 
and he himself has run it 
into the ground  sir  does anybody disagree 
check the share price this morning 
crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost mr  wayne his seat   
   it s cost us all a lot of money 
and he has to go 
i m afraid he has a point 
mr  wayne 
now  back to business 
man 1  mr  wayne  over here  man 2 
how s it feel to be one of the people 
mr  wayne  they re towing your car  i
didn t know what to do  they had paperwork 
looks like you need a ride  huh 
wayne  we ll give you a ride 
how the hell did miranda tate get
the inside track on the wayne board 
she been meeting with him 
sleeping with him 
  not that we know of 
  you don t know much of anything  do you 
  where s bane 
  we told him it was urgent 
  where is that masked   
  speak of the devil   
   and he shall appear 
what the hell is going on 
  the plan is proceeding as expected 
  oh  really 
do i look like i m running
wayne enterprises right now 
your hit on the stock exchange 
it didn t work  my friend 
and now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day 
how exactly is that supposed to
help my company absorb wayne s 
  leave us 
  no  you stay here 
i m in charge 
do you feel in charge 
i ve paid you a small fortune 
and this gives you power over me 
what is this 
your money and infrastructure
have been important   
   till now 
what are you 
i m gotham s reckoning 
here to end the borrowed time
you ve all been living on 
you re pure evil 
i m necessary evil 
no  no  no  no 
when you started  why the mask 
  to protect the people closest to me 
  but you were a loner  right 
  you didn t have any family 
  there are always people you care about 
you just don t realize how
much until they re gone 
the idea was to be a symbol 
batman could be anybody 
that was the point 
  well  it was damn good to see him back 
  not everybody agrees 
  they ll figure that out in the end 
  you got anything on bane s whereabouts 
yeah  i got 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight 
i could use some help  actually 
you know what  drop me in old town 
hey  hey  hey  i don t think so 
  that s the way this works 
  i don t think so 
  that is the way  
  he s not a mark 
and he doesn t have a
cent to his name  anyway 
yeah  it s not much  but it s
more than you ve got right now 
actually  they re letting
me keep the house 
the rich don t even go broke the
same as the rest of us  huh 
my powerful friend might hope to
change your mind about leaving 
  and how would he do that 
  by giving you what you want 
  it doesn t exist 
  he says it does 
he wants to meet tonight 
why 
he needs to find bane  says you d know how 
  tell him i ll think about it 
  okay 
i like your place 
mt  wayne 
i m sorry they took all your money 
no  you re not 
  can we help you  officer 
  uh  yeah 
john daggett s body was just found
in a dumpster about an hour ago 
  thought you might want to know 
  why 
his name s all over these permits i just
pulled to  uh  map the tunnels under gotham 
that s mta maintenance  uh 
sewer construction  couple of other things 
where did you get to
with the tunnel searches 
remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out 
we ve had teams down there 
it s a huge network 
well  get more men 
work a grid  i want him found 
yeah  the  uh  masked man 
we re on it 
lose the uniform  you re working for me now 
we could use some hotter heads around here 
  sir  that could also be a coincidence 
  you re a detective now  son 
you re not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore 
nobody s answering 
no 
i m on my own now 
do you have keys 
never needed them 
hope you didn t like
me for my money 
suffering builds character 
i ll take care of your
parents  legacy  bruce 
who s this 
where s alfred 
he left   
   taking everything 
what s that 
my power s been shut off 
you re good at that 
when i was a child  we had almost nothing 
but on the nights when we had a fire 
we felt very rich indeed 
i assumed your family was wealthy 
not always 
not when i was young 
an old mistake 
i ve made a few myself 
more than a few 
we could leave 
tonight 
take my plane 
go anywhere we wanted 
someday  perhaps 
not tonight 
don t be shy 
wayne says you can get me the clean slate 
  that depends 
  on what 
on what you want it for 
i acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands 
still don t trust me  huh 
how can we change that 
start by taking me to bane 
you asked 
from here  bane s men patrol the tunnels 
and they re not your
average brawlers 
neither am i 
  he s behind you 
  who 
me 
what do you think you re   
just a little further 
i had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me 
you made a serious mistake 
not as serious as yours  i fear 
bane 
let s not stand on ceremony here   
   mr  wayne 
peace has cost you your strength 
victory has defeated you 
theatricality and deception 
powerful agents to the uninitiated 
but we are initiated 
aren t we  bruce 
members of the league of shadows 
and you betrayed us 
 us   you were excommunicated   
by a gang of psychopaths 
i am the league of shadows 
and i m here to fulfill
ra s al ghul s destiny 
you fight like a younger man 
nothing held back 
admirable  but mistaken 
oh  you think
darkness is your ally 
but you merely adopted the dark 
i was born in it 
molded by it 
i didn t see the light
until i was already a man 
by then  it was nothing to me but blinding 
the shadows betray you
because they belong to me 
i will show you where i have made my home   
   whilst preparing
to bring justice 
then i will break you 
your precious armory 
gratefully accepted 
we will need it 
ah  yes  i was wondering
what would break first 
your spirit   
   or your body 
get me commissioner gordon  i got a
line on the congressman s kidnapping 
  excuse me  miss 
  uh  yes 
i m gonna need to see your ticket
and identification  please 
oh  do you mind 
i showed your picture to the
congressman  guess what 
don t tell me  still in love 
oh  head over heels 
pressing charges  though 
you ve made some mistakes 
ms  kyle 
  girl s gotta eat 
  and you have an appetite 
why would you run  you can t
hide with a record like this 
maybe it s not you
i m running from 
who then  bane 
what do you know about him 
that you should be as afraid of him as i am 
we can offer you protection 
okay 
when i spotted you  i was looking
for a friend of mine  bruce wayne 
did they kill him 
i m not sure 
why didn t you just   
   kill me 
you don t fear death 
you welcome it 
your punishment
must be more severe 
torture 
yes 
but not of your body 
of your soul 
where am i 
home 
where i learned the
truth about despair 
as will you 
there is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth 
hope 
every man who has rotted
here over the centuries   
   has looked up to the light and
imagined climbing to freedom 
so easy 
so simple 
and like shipwrecked men turning to
seawater from uncontrollable thirst   
   many have died trying 
i learned here there can be
no true despair without hope 
so as i terrorize gotham   
   i will feed its people
hope to poison their souls 
i will let them believe
that they can survive   
   so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun 
you can watch me
torture an entire city 
and then when you have truly
understood the depth of your failure   
   we will fulfill
ra s al ghul s destiny 
we will destroy gotham 
and then  when it is done   
   and gotham is   
   ashes   
   then you have my
permission to die 
you re locking her up in here 
the dent act allows non segregation
based on extraordinary need 
first time she broke out of
women s correctional  she was 16 
little closer  baby 
why  honey  you wanna hold my hand 
she s gonna be fine 
i still don t see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project 
bruce got a lot of things right 
keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them 
how good of you to join us 
chair  president 
all i need now is one more
ordinary board member 
mr  fox  would you
like to nominate 
no 
i will volunteer 
where are you taking us 
you were right  commissioner 
will you excuse us  please 
what happened 
your masked man kidnapped
the wayne enterprises board 
he let most of them go 
but he took three into the sewers 
no more patrols 
no more hide and seek 
get every available cop down
there and smoke him out 
the mayor won t want panic 
so it s a training exercise 
i m sorry i didn t
take you seriously 
not you 
you re telling me
the batman s gone   
   so you chase up the daggett
leads any way you can 
yes  sir 
he asks how much you would
pay us to let you die 
i told him  i told
him you have nothing 
do it for the pleasure 
they pay me more than
that to keep you alive 
he will try the climb 
has anyone ever made it 
of course not 
he says there is one who did 
a child 
a child born in this hell
bane 
an old legend  nothing more 
don t 
whatever it is they want you to see 
it s happening soon 
fire in the hole 
turn it on 
i only need one other board member 
there are eight others waiting 
i won t do it 
all right  stop 
lucius  you ll kill this man 
and yourself   
   and you ll barely
slow them down 
go on  then  do your work 
take them up to the surface 
people of their status   
   deserve to experience the
next era of western civilization 
ke  i ve been to half of daggett s
cement plants and locations
they poured underground 
gordon anything strange about the pourings 
honestly  commissioner  i don t know
anything about civil engineering 
but you know about patterns  keep looking 
l  it s done
this is now a 4 megaton
nuclear bomb 
pull the core out of the reactor 
no  you cannot 
this is the only power source
capable of sustaining it 
if you move it  the core will
decay in a matter of months 
five  by my calculations 
and then it will go off 
and for the sake of your children 
dr  pavel   
   indeed i hope it does 
hey  hey 
that was you in front of the
stock exchange  wasn t it 
  when 
  when 
when cops were trying to pull onto castle
street and your truck was shutting them out 
  oh  yeah  you re the cop 
  detective now 
and  uh  as a detective  we re not
allowed to believe in coincidence 
what were you doing here 
what are you working on 
commissioner  it s blake 
i got two dead witnesses and a lot
of questions  call me whenev  
wait a minute  i m looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene 
that looks like motor
oil right next to it 
jesus  they re not making cement 
they re making explosives 
    patch me in to foley 
foley s overseeing the operation 
they re heading into a trap 
er  we re seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers 
  mr  mayor  literally thousands 
  it s a training exercise  that s all 
now if you ll excuse me  i ve got tickets
to watch our boys thrash rapid city 
    foley    it s a trap 
pull everyone out 
bane has been pouring concrete   
    laced with explosives 
  where 
oh  say  can you see by the
dawn s early light
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilight s   
ke  there s a ring around the
tunnels  they ll blow it and
trap the cops underground 
pull them out  pull them out now 
er  through the perilous fight
o er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming
and the rockets  red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through  
that s a lovely  lovely voice 
  that our ï  ag was still there
oh  say does that star spangled
banner yet wave
o er the land of the free
and the home of the brave
let the games begin 
everybody okay 
cop 2  let s move  move 
move  cop 3  go  go 
gotham   
   take control 
take control of your city 
  foley 
  jesus  blake 
every cop in the city s
in those tunnels 
not every cop 
sir  are you okay  i m a police officer 
i need your car right now 
clear the corners  rookie 
get my coat  son 
this   
this is the instrument
of your liberation 
satellite shows a radiation spike 
whatever it is  it s nuclear 
identify yourself to the world 
dr  leonid pavel 
nuclear physicist 
pavel was confirmed dead 
plane crash on an agency pull
out of uzbekistan  but   
it looks like it s him 
and what     what is this 
it s a fully primed neutron bomb   
   with a blast
radius of six miles 
and who is capable of
disarming such a device 
only me 
only you 
thank you  good doctor
