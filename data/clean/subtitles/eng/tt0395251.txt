well  thank you for smiling

with you  
this man should be
in a straightjacket 
 you feeling better 
 oh  yes  i m fine now  thank you 
 good 
 may i speak to you 
yes  prince myshkin 
what can we do for you 
well  this is hardly
the time for levity  mr  bialystock 
i ve discovered a serious error   
   in the accounts of your last show 
funny boy 
 where  what 
 well  according to the backers list   
   you raised  100 000 
but your show only cost 98 000 
there s 2000 unaccounted for 
i went to a turkish bath 
who cares 
the show was a flop 
bloom  do me a favour   
   move a few decimal points around 
you can do it  you re an accountant 
you re part of a noble profession 
the word  count  is part of your title 
 that s cheating 
 it s not cheating 
it s charity 
bloom   
   you see this stickpin 
this once held a pearl
as big as your eye 
i used to wear handmade
ltalian shoes   500 suits 
and look at me now 
look at me now 
i m wearing a cardboard belt 
bloom  you gotta save me 
i m reaching out to you 
don t send me to prison 
help me 
all right  all right 
okay  i ll do it 
 really 
 yes  i ll do it 
see   2000 isn t so much 
i m sure i can hide it someplace 
after all  the lrs isn t interested
in a show that flopped 
right  good thinking 
you figure it out 
i m gonna take a little nap 
now  let s see 
let s see  if we add up
these deductions  we get    
carry the three  divide by four    
amazing 
it s absolutely amazing  but   
   under the right circumstances   
   a producer could
make more money with a flop   
   than he could with a hit 
yes  it s quite possible  lf he were
certain that a show would fail   
   a man could make a fortune 
 yes 
 yes  what 
 what you were saying  keep talking 
 what was i saying 
you were saying that a producer   
   could make more money
with a flop than a hit 
well  yes  it s quite possible 
you keep saying that 
but you don t say how 
well  it s simply a matter
of creative accounting 
let s assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man 
assume away 
all right  when you produced
your last show  funny boy   
   you raised  2000
more than you needed 
but you could ve raised a million   
   put on your  100 000 flop
and kept the rest 
 but what if my show was a hit 
 then you would go to jail 
see  rather than 100 percent
of the show   
   you would ve sold
more than 1000 percent 
so if the show s a success 
there s no way to pay off the backers 
 get it 
 got it 
so in order for our scheme to work 
we d have to find a sure fire flop 
 our scheme    what scheme 
what scheme 
your scheme 
you bloody little genius 
i meant no scheme  i merely posed
a little academic accounting theory 
 it was just a thought 
 bloom   
   worlds are turned
on such thoughts 
don t you see  bloom 
darling bloom  glorious bloom 
it s so simple 
step one 
we find the worst play ever written 
step two 
we hire the worst director in town 
 step three  i raise 2 million dollars 
 two 
yes  one for me  one for you  there s
a lot of little old ladies out there 
step four  we hire the worst actors
in new york and open on broadway 
and before you can say  step five   
we close on broadway   
   take our 2 million and go to rio 
rio  that d never work 
oh  ye of little faith 
what did lewis say to clark
when everything looked bleak 
what did sir edmund say to tenzing
as they struggled
toward everest s peak 
what did washington say

as they crossed the delaware

to explode and shoot into the sky 
 i m a fountain 
 yes  you re a fountain

 i should explain 
i m going to the choreographers  ball 
there is a prize for best costume 
 we always win 
 i m not so sure about this year 
i m supposed to be
the grand duchess anastasia   
   but i think i look more like
the chrysler building 
well  as far as i m concerned  without
your wig on  you re only half dressed 
well  then 
why don t you go and get it   
   oh  wicked witch of the west 
lf your intention   
   was to shoot an arrow
through my heart   
   bull s eye 
oh  roger  let s face it 
that building is you 
listen  i know we sent it to you
only this morning   
   but did you read
springtime for hitler 
read it  i devoured it 
and i find it remarkable 
remarkable 
i feel it is a very important piece 
drenched with historical goodies 
i  for one  for instance 
never realized that the third reich   
   meant germany 
yeah  how about that 
then you ll do it 
do it  of course not  it s not my
kind of thing  i mean  max  please 
world war ll 
too dark  too depressing 
the theatre s so obsessed
with dramas so depressed
it s hard to sell a ticket on broadway
shows should be more pretty
shows should be more witty
shows should be more
what s the word 
 gay 
 exactly 
no matter what you do on the stage
keep it light  keep it bright
keep it gay
whether it s murder
mayhem or rage
don t complain  it s a pain
keep it gay
people want laughter
when they see a show
the last thing they re after is
a litany of woe
a happy ending
will pep up your play
oedipus won t bomb
if he winds up with mom
 keep it gay
 keep it gay
 keep it gay
 keep it gay
couldn t agree more 
and you have our blessings 
roger   
   to make springtime for hitler just
as gay as anyone could possibly want 
so come on  do it for us  please 
i m sorry  max 
it s simply not my cup of tea 
still  fair is fair 
i should ask my production team
what they think 
your production team 
who are they 
you ll see  they all live here 
guys  come say hello
to bialystock and bloom 
this is my set designer  brian 
hello 
keep it mad  keep it glad
keep it gay
 here s my costume designer  kevin 
 hello 
keep it happy  keep it snappy
keep it gay
we re clever  creative
it s our job to see
that everything s perfect
for mr  debris
scott  my choreographer 
hi there 
and  finally  last and least   
   my lighting designer 
shirley markowitz 
keep it gay
keep it gay
keep it gay
now  they all just read springtime 
what did you think of it  fellas 
 it needs glamour
 and glitz
 it needs sequins
 and tits
leo  leo  i think we re losing them 
go say something nice to roger 
i think he likes you 
 but  max    
 go on  it s just show biz 
mr  debris  roger 
roger  actually 
i think your gown is very stunning 
why  thank you  mr  bloom 
leo 
what is that enchanting
cologne you re wearing 
me  i m not wearing any cologne 
you mean that smell is you 
oh  god 
lf i could bottle you  i d shove you
under my armpits every day 
oh  max 
max  we never should ve started this 
 i think we re getting in too deep 
 too deep  this is nothing 
i ll tell you when
we re getting in too deep 
and so the rule is
when mounting a play
keep it funny
keep it sunny
keep it gay
 what should we do 
 relax  watch this 
roger  i  
i think that springtime for hitler would
be a marvellous opportunity for you 
i mean  up to now 
you ve always been associated with  
dare i say it    frivolous musicals 
you re right 
i ve often felt as though   
   i ve been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments 
dopey showgirls in gooey gowns 
two  three  kick  turn  turn  turn 
kick  turn 
 roger 
 it s enough to make you heave 
nonetheless  i m sorry  max  i just
couldn t do springtime for hitler 
 why not  think of the respect 
 no 
 think of the prestige 
 no  no  no 
think of the tony 
tony  tony  tony  tony  tony
 what s the matter 
 ls he all right 
 he s having a stroke 
 what 
 of genius 
 i see it at last 
the chance
to do something important 
roger debris presents
history
of course that second act
has to be rewritten 
they re losing the war  excuse me 
that s too downbeat 
roger debris presents
history
but maybe    
it s a wild idea 
but it just might work 
see
a line
of beautiful girls
dressed as storm troopers
each one a gem
with leather boots
and whips on their hips
 it s risqué  dare i say  s   m
 love it 
i see german soldiers
dancing through france
played by chorus boys
in very tight pants
and wait  there s more
they ll win the war
and the dances they do
will be daring and new
turn  turn  kick  turn 
one  two  three  kick  turn 
keep it sassy  keep it classy
keep it  
that is brilliant  brilliant  brilliant 
i speak for mr  bloom
and myself  roger   
   when i say you are the only man
in the world   
   who could do justice to
springtime for hitler 
 will you do it  please 
 please 
wait a minute 
this is a very big decision 
it might affect the course of my life 
i shall have to think about it 
i ll do it 
i ll do it
sabu  champagne 
if at the end
you want them to cheer
keep it gay  keep it gay  keep it gay
whether it s hamlet  othello
or lear
keep it gay  keep it gay  keep it gay
comedy s joyous
a constant delight
dramas annoy us
and ruin our night
so keep your strindbergs
and ibsens at bay
 i ll sign
 sign
 sign
 sign
 sign
 sign
sign 
roger elizabeth debris 
keep it gay
 conga 
 everybody 
and so the rule is
when mounting a play
keep it gay
keep it gay
stop it 
keep it gay

 well   
   yesterday when i was stepping out
of a big  white rolls royce limo   
   a crazy man
yelled something out the window   
   that inspired me to write this song 
when you got it
flaunt it
step right up and strut your stuff
people tell you modesty s a virtue
but in the theatre
modesty can hurt you
when you got it
flaunt it
show your assets
let  em know you re proud
your goodies you must push
stick your chest out
shake your tush
when you got it
shout it out loud
now ulla dance 
when you got it
show it
put your hidden treasures
on display
violinists love to play an e string
but audiences really love a g string
when you got it
shout it
let the whole world hear
what you re about
clothes may make the man
all a girl needs is a tan
when you got it
let it hang out
 remember when ulla dance 
 yeah 
ulla dance again 
ulla dance again

if nature blesses you
from top to bottom
show that top to bottom
don t think twice
now ulla belt 
don t think twice 
when you got it
share it
let the public feast
upon your charms
people say that being prim
is proper
but every showgirl knows
that prim will stop her
when you got it
give it
don t be selfish
give it all away
don t be shy
be bold and cute
show the boys your birthday suit
when you got it
if you got it
once you got it
shout out
hooray 
okey dokey

like   like it 
i want you to know  my dear

inside of me   
   like hot lava rising higher
and higher and  
what is that  max 
what is it 
it s called an erection 
it s either that or malaria 
but don t worry 
they have shots for everything now 
come here 
i want to show you something 
 what do you see 
 nothing 
exactly  but now that we ve got
our sure fire flop   
   it s gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars 
two million 
gee  how much do we put in 
how much   
how much do we put in 
bloom   
   the two cardinal rules
of being a broadway producer   
   are one  never put
your own money in the show 
and two 
never put your own money
in the show 
 get it 
 got it 
 good 
 so how do we raise the money 
how  i ll tell you how 
from my investors 
hundreds of little old ladies   
   all looking to max bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery 
so in the days to come  bloom 
you shall see very little of me 
and right now 
i d like to see very little of you 
scram while i get myself ready 
for max bialystock
is about to launch himself   
   into little old lady land 
the time has come
to be a lover from the argentine
to slick my hair down
with brilliantine
and gargle heavily
with listerine
it s time for max
to put his backers on their backs
and thrill them with amazing acts
those aging nymphomaniacs
they were helpless
they were hopeless
then along came bialy
they were joyless
they were boy less
then along came bialy
they re my angels
i m their devil
and i keep those embers aglow
when i woos  em
i can t lose  em
 cause i cast my spell
and they start yellin 
  fire down below   
so romantic
they were frantic
then their prayers were heard
up above
heaven sent them
their bialy
i m the celebration of love
who is it  who is it 
it s max bialystock 
maxy 
fire down below 
we were listing
we were sinking
then along came bialy
we were desperate
we were drinking
 then along came bialy
 who s your daddy 
so romantic
we were frantic
then our prayers were heard
up above
it s bialy
hey  bialy
he s the culmination
the restoration
the consummation
the titillation
ejaculation
he s the celebration of love
thank you 
bloom  bloom 
what  max  what 
i ve done it  i ve done it 
i ve raised the 2 million 
now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history 
that s great 
we can t miss
i gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3 00 or else  
sorry  wrong office 
bialystock  bloom 
max  leo 
 ulla 
 ulla 
what happened to the office 
like you tell ulla   tidy up  
tidy  oop  
how did you find the time
to do all this 
 i skip lunch 
 of course you did 
 very nice 
 she skipped lunch 
almost 3 
that payment to the shuberts 
i ll get the cash from the safe 
you make sure
all those contracts are signed 
yes  max 
she painted over the numbers 
hello  boys 
nobody knows
what i went through to get you 
ulla knows 
you had to shtupp
every little old lady in new york 
that s right  that s right 
and i ve still got
the denture bites to prove it 
work  work  work  work  work  work 
so  mr  bloom 
we are all alone 
yes  we are  aren t we 
why bloom go so far camera right 
bloom no like ulla 
ulla like bloom 
bloom like ulla  all right 
 maybe a little too much 
 good 
i m glad 
why bloom need blue blanket 
oh  it s not important 
it s just a minor compulsion 
it s that i ve  
i ve had it ever since
i was a baby  and i    
you re a little too close 
the urge to merge
can rob us of our senses
the need to breed
can make a man a drone
we must be on alert
with our defences
for every skirt will test
testosterone
so knowing this
i severed all connection
with any creature
sporting silk or lace
i was firmly headed
in the right direction
when suddenly i stumbled on
that face
that face
that face
that dangerous face
i mustn t be unwise
those lips
that nose
those eyes
could lead to my demise
that face
that face
that marvellous face
i never should begin
those cheeks
that neck
that chin
will surely do me in
i must be smart
and hide my heart
if she s within a mile
if i don t duck
i m out of luck
she d kill me with her smile
that face
that face
that fabulous face
it s clear i must beware
i m certain if i fall in love
i m lost without a trace
but it s worth it
for that face
bloom help ulla down 
all right  bloom help ulla down 
that face
that face
that lovable face
it melts my swedish heart
i m certain if i fall in love
i m lost without a trace
but it s worth it
for that face

good luck 
it s bad luck to say   good luck  
on opening night
once it s said

they are scared
  bonne chance  mes amis  
no one says
 the only word you ll ever hear is
 merde
good luck  good luck  good luck 
it s verboten
wishing luck on opening night
take advice
don t think twice
or your show will surely end up
in the scheiss
at the famous la scala in milan
on opening night it s a rule
  al bocca lupo     they say with élan
and just for luck they all shout
   vaffanculo  
 i got it

springtime for hitler and germany
deutschland is happy and gay

poor max 
maybe i should turn myself in
and go to jail with him 
well  my sweet cupcake 
i know we both love max   
   but it seems to me
you have two choices 
number one  you can go to jail
with mr  bialystock   
   for years and years and years 
or number two   
   you can take that 2 million dollars
and ulla  and go to rio

why am i asking you 
  dear max  rio is everything
you said it was and more 
ulla and i think of you
every chance we get 
in the morning  when we
have breakfast on our terrace   
   many different herrings 
in the afternoon  when we rub
each other s sun drenched bodies   
    with banana cream coconut oil 
number 15 
and then  in the evening  when
we samba together in the moonlight   
you ll find your happiness in rio
the beaches there
are strewn with pearls
the tropic breezes
always blow there
and so  we hear
do the girls
  sorry  must run  u lla s waiting 
it s almost 11 
wish you were here 
your pal  leo   
just like cain and abel
you pulled a sneak attack
i thought that we were brothers
then you stabbed me in the back
betrayed
oh  boy  i m so betrayed
like samson and delilah
your love began to fade
i m crying in the hoosegow
you re in rio getting laid
betrayed
let s face it  i m betrayed
boy  have i been taken
oy  i m so forsaken
i should have seen
what came to pass
i should have known
to watch my ass
i feel like othello
everything is lost
leo is iago
max is double crossed
i m so dismayed
did i mention i m betrayed 
now i m about to go to jail
there s no one who will pay my bail
i have no one who i can cry to
no one i can say goodbye to
i m drowning 
i m drowning 
i m drowning here 
i m going down for the last time 
i can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes 
i see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence 
i m running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie  rex 
no  rex  not on the alfalfa 
and i see my mother 
i see mama standing
on the back porch   
   in a worn but clean
gingham gown 
and i hear my mama
calling out to me 
alvin 
don t forget your chores 
the wood needs a cording
and the cows need a milking 
alvin  alvin 
wait a minute 
my name s not alvin 
that s not my life 
somebody else s life
is flashing before my eyes 
what the hell is that about 
i m not a hillbilly 
i grew up in the bronx 
but wait  now i remember
how did it begin 
he walked into my office
with his cockamamie scheme
you can make more money
with a flop than with a hit
we can do it
we can do it
i can t do it
we can do it
i can t do it
goodbye  max
lord  i want that money
i m back  max
come on  leo  we can do it
step one  find the play

just like julius caesar
was betrayed by brutus
who d think an accountant
would turn out to be my judas
i m so dismayed
is this how i m repaid 
to be
betrayed
betrayed
gentlemen of the jury 
have you reached your verdict 
yes  your honour  we have 
we find the defendant   
   incredibly guilty 
hold me  touch me 
i m a little busy 
does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf 
yes  your honour  i do 
i admit  for the last 20 years
i ve been a lying  double crossing   
   two faced  backstabbing 
despicable crook 
but i had no choice 
i was a broadway producer 
a man without a conscience   
   and with no one
who gave a damn about him 
and that  your honour 
is what hurts the most 
i thought i d at last
found a loyal partner 
a man i cared about   
   and who i thought
cared about me 
what breaks my heart is now   
   when i need him most 
he s deserted me 
i will probably never see
or hear from him ever again 
that s not true 
order  order in the court 
and stop that samba 
 who are you 
 i am leopold bloom   
   max bialystock s partner 
and who are you  my dear 
my name is
ulla lnga hansen benson   
   yonsen tallen hallen
svaden svanson bloom 
bloom 
 you re his wife 
 ja  your honour 
he wouldn t do it
unless we got married 
what a schmuck 
now  mr  bloom 
why in the world would you   
   want to come back here
and give yourself up 
why  to speak on his behalf 
we all know that max bialystock
is a lying  double crossing   
   two faced  slimy 
manipulative  underhanded  
please   
   don t help me 
your honour   your honour 
if i may address the court 
the law was created to protect
people from being wronged 
so whom has
max bialystock wronged 
 well  not these dear ladies 
 no 
and not me  not  
not me 
i was this nobody 
no one ever called me    leo  before 
i mean  your honour 
i know it isn t a big legal point   
   but even when i was in kindergarten
everybody always called me    bloom  
i guess what i m trying to say
is that even when i was in rio   
   and had everything
i d ever dreamed of   
   i suddenly realized that  
that this man    
this man    
no one ever made me
feel like someone
till him
life was really nothing
but a glum one
till him
my existence bordered on the tragic
always timid
never took a chance
then i felt his magic
and my heart began to dance
i was always frightened
fraught with worry
till him
i was going nowhere in a hurry
till him
he filled up my empty life
filled it to the brim
there could never
ever be another one
like him
leo    
leo   
   i never realized 
 you re a good singer 
 thank you 
 no  really  like a professional 
 well  i sang it for you  max 
i sang it because i m your friend 
you are 
i ve had a lot of relationships   
   but you couldn t call
any of them  friend  
but come to think of it   
   no one ever  ever really knew me 
till him
everyone was always out
to screw me
till him
never met a man i ever trusted
always dealt with shysters
in the past
now i m well adjusted
 cause i ve got a friend at last
don t help me 
always playing singles
never doubles
till him
never had a pal
to share my troubles
till him
he filled up my empty life
 filled it to the brim
 filled it to the brim
there could never ever be
another one
like him
gentlemen  it breaks my heart   
   to break up
such a beautiful friendship 
so i won t 
five years in the state penitentiary
at sing sing 
gotta sing  sing
gotta sing  sing

leo and max
up off our backs
back on the great white way
leo and max
back on our tracks
we re back on top to stay
so when we take your money
never fear
we ll knock broadway
right on its ear
the cast is great
the script is swell
but this we re telling you  sirs
it s just no go
you ve got no show
without the producers
we ll never quit
hit after hit
the producers
leo and max
the overture is over
the curtain starts to rise
you re suddenly in clover
you can t believe your eyes
you re sitting on the aisle
you break into a smile
why this magic feeling 
and then you realize
that there is
nothing like a show on broadway
nothing like a broadway show
hearts will skip a beat on broadway
if you re feeling blue
i m telling you
that s the place to go
movies drag
their endings sag
tv s just a bore
so hit the street
and move your feet
to the place we all adore
because there s nothing
like a show on broadway
there s nothing
like a broadway show
it s often been said
the theatre is dead
the critics repeat it en masse
but the theatre s alive
it s gonna survive
although it s a pain in the ass
you waited forever
and finally got tickets
to get to your seat
you gotta cross pickets
the guy to your right
is frightfully tight
the guy to your left
appears to have rickets
the music s yuck
the lyrics suck
the casting is all wrong
and when you reach the bathroom
the line is five miles long
but still there s nothing
like a show on broadway
there s nothing
like a broadway show
you swear you ll never go again
it s simply not worthwhile
you make that v ow
and then somehow
 you re back there on the aisle
 you re back there on the aisle
that s why there s
nothing like a show
on broadway
there s nothing
like a broadway show
till you re in movies
there s nothing
like a broadway show
and though it is expensive
at a hundred bucks a throw
there s nothing
like a broadway show 
don t forget to buy mein kampf   
   in paperback 
available near you   
   at borders books   
   or barnes   noble   
   und amazon com 
thanks for coming
to see our show
sad to tell you
we got to go
grab your hat
and head for the door
in case you didn t notice
there ain t any more
if you like our show
tell everyone but
if you think it stinks
keep your big mouth shut
we re glad you came but
we have to shout
