well you know what they say
smile and the world smiles
with you
this man should be
in a straightjacket
you feeling better
oh yes im fine now thank you
good
may i speak to you
yes prince myshkin
what can we do for you
well this is hardly
the time for levity mr bialystock
ive discovered a serious error
in the accounts of your last show
funny boy
where what
well according to the backers list
you raised 100000
but your show only cost 98000
theres 2000 unaccounted for
i went to a turkish bath
who cares
the show was a flop
bloom do me a favour
move a few decimal points around
you can do it youre an accountant
youre part of a noble profession
the word count is part of your title
thats cheating
its not cheating
its charity
bloom
you see this stickpin
this once held a pearl
as big as your eye
i used to wear handmade
ltalian shoes 500 suits
and look at me now
look at me now
im wearing a cardboard belt
bloom you gotta save me
im reaching out to you
dont send me to prison
help me
all right all right
okay ill do it
really
yes ill do it
see 2000 isnt so much
im sure i can hide it someplace
after all the lrs isnt interested
in a show that flopped
right good thinking
you figure it out
im gonna take a little nap
now lets see
lets see if we add up
these deductions we get
carry the three divide by four
amazing
its absolutely amazing but
under the right circumstances
a producer could
make more money with a flop
than he could with a hit
yes its quite possible lf he were
certain that a show would fail
a man could make a fortune
yes
yes what
what you were saying keep talking
what was i saying
you were saying that a producer
could make more money
with a flop than a hit
well yes its quite possible
you keep saying that
but you dont say how
well its simply a matter
of creative accounting
lets assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man
assume away
all right when you produced
your last show funny boy
you raised 2000
more than you needed
but you couldve raised a million
put on your 100000 flop
and kept the rest
but what if my show was a hit
then you would go to jail
see rather than 100 percent
of the show
you wouldve sold
more than 1000 percent
so if the shows a success
theres no way to pay off the backers
get it
got it
so in order for our scheme to work
wed have to find a surefire flop
our scheme what scheme
what scheme
your scheme
you bloody little genius
i meant no scheme i merely posed
a little academic accounting theory
it was just a thought
bloom
worlds are turned
on such thoughts
dont you see bloom
darling bloom glorious bloom
its so simple
step one
we find the worst play ever written
step two
we hire the worst director in town
step three i raise 2 million dollars
two
yes one for me one for you theres
a lot of little old ladies out there
step four we hire the worst actors
in new york and open on broadway
and before you can say step five
we close on broadway
take our 2 million and go to rio
rio thatd never work
oh ye of little faith
what did lewis say to clark
when everything looked bleak
what did sir edmund say to tenzing
as they struggled
toward everests peak
what did washington say
to his troops
as they crossed the delaware
im sure youre well aware
whatd they say
we can do it
we can do it
we can do it
me and you
we can do it
we can do it
we can make our dreams come true
everything youve ever wanted
is just waiting to be had
beautiful girls

i should explain
im going to the choreographers ball
there is a prize for best costume

the grand duchess anastasia
but i think i look more like
the chrysler building
well as far as im concerned without
your wig on youre only half dressed
well then
why dont you go and get it
oh wicked witch of the west
lf your intention
was to shoot an arrow
through my heart
bullseye
oh roger lets face it
that building is you
listen i know we sent it to you
only this morning
but did you read
springtime for hitler
read it i devoured it
and i find it remarkable
remarkable
i feel it is a very important piece
drenched with historical goodies
i for one for instance
never realized that the third reich
meant germany
yeah how about that
then youll do it
do it of course not its not my
kind of thing i mean max please
world war ll
too dark too depressing
the theatres so obsessed
with dramas so depressed
its hard to sell a ticket on broadway
shows should be more pretty
shows should be more witty
shows should be more
whats the word
gay
exactly
no matter what you do on the stage
keep it light keep it bright
keep it gay
whether its murder
mayhem or rage
dont complain its a pain
keep it gay
people want laughter
when they see a show
the last thing theyre after is
a litany of woe
a happy ending
will pep up your play
oedipus wont bomb
if he winds up with mom
keep it gay
keep it gay
keep it gay
keep it gay
couldnt agree more
and you have our blessings
roger
to make springtime for hitler just
as gay as anyone could possibly want
so come on do it for us please

when mounting a play
keep it funny

roger i
i think that springtime for hitler would
be a marvellous opportunity for you
i mean up to now
youve always been associated with
dare i say it frivolous musicals
youre right
ive often felt as though
ive been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments
dopey showgirls in gooey gowns
two three kick turn turn turn
kick turn
roger
its enough to make you heave
nonetheless im sorry max i just
couldnt do springtime for hitler
why not think of the respect

of genius

a crazy man
yelled something out the window
that inspired me to write this song
when you got it
flaunt it
step right up and strut your stuff
people tell you modestys a virtue
but in the theatre
modesty can hurt you
when you got it
flaunt it
show your assets
let em know youre proud
your goodies you must push
stick your chest out
shake your tush
when you got it
shout it out loud
now ulla dance
when you got it
show it
put your hidden treasures
on display
violinists love to play an e string
but audiences really love a gstring
when you got it
shout it
let the whole world hear

all a girl needs is a tan
when you got it
let it hang out

its either that or malaria
but dont worry
they have shots for everything now
come here
i want to show you something
what do you see
nothing
exactly but now that weve got
our surefire flop
its gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars
two million
gee how much do we put in
how much
how much do we put in
bloom
the two cardinal rules
of being a broadway producer
are one never put
your own money in the show
and two
never put your own money
in the show
get it
got it
good
so how do we raise the money
how ill tell you how
from my investors
hundreds of little old ladies
all looking to max bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery
so in the days to come bloom
you shall see very little of me
and right now
id like to see very little of you
scram while i get myself ready
for max bialystock
is about to launch himself
into littleoldlady land
the time has come
to be a lover from the argentine
to slick my hair down
with brilliantine
and gargle heavily
with listerine
its time for max
to put his backers on their backs
and thrill them with amazing acts
those aging nymphomaniacs
they were helpless
they were hopeless
then along came bialy
they were joyless
they were boyless
then along came bialy
theyre my angels
im their devil
and i keep those embers aglow
when i woos em
i cant lose em
cause i cast my spell
and they start yellin
fire down below
so romantic
they were frantic
then their prayers were heard
up above
heaven sent them
their bialy
im the celebration of love
who is it who is it
its max bialystock
maxy
fire down below
we were listing
we were sinking
then along came bialy
we were desperate
we were drinking
then along came bialy
whos your daddy
so romantic
we were frantic
then our prayers were heard
up above
its bialy
hey bialy
hes the culmination
the restoration
the consummation
the titillation
ejaculation
hes the celebration of love
thank you
bloom bloom
what max what
ive done it ive done it
ive raised the 2 million
now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history
thats great
we cant miss
i gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 300 or else
sorry wrong office
bialystock bloom
max leo
ulla
ulla
what happened to the office
like you tell ulla tidy up
tidy oop
how did you find the time
to do all this
i skip lunch
of course you did
very nice
she skipped lunch
almost 3
that payment to the shuberts
ill get the cash from the safe
you make sure
all those contracts are signed
yes max
she painted over the numbers
hello boys
nobody knows
what i went through to get you
ulla knows
you had to shtupp
every little old lady in new york
thats right thats right
and ive still got
the denture bites to prove it
work work work work work work
so mr bloom
we are all alone
yes we are arent we
why bloom go so far camera right
bloom no like ulla
ulla like bloom
bloom like ulla all right
maybe a little too much
good
im glad
why bloom need blue blanket
oh its not important
its just a minor compulsion
its that ive
ive had it ever since
i was a baby and i
youre a little too close
the urge to merge
can rob us of our senses
the need to breed
can make a man a drone
we must be on alert
with our defences
for every skirt will test
testosterone
so knowing this
i severed all connection
with any creature
sporting silk or lace
i was firmly headed
in the right direction
when suddenly i stumbled on
that face
that face
that face
that dangerous face
i mustnt be unwise
those lips
that nose
those eyes
could lead to my demise
that face
that face
that marvellous face
i never should begin
those cheeks
that neck
that chin
will surely do me in
i must be smart
and hide my heart
if shes within a mile
if i dont duck
im out of luck
shed kill me with her smile
that face
that face
that fabulous face
its clear i must beware
im certain if i fall in love
im lost without a trace
but its worth it
for that face
bloom help ulla down
all right bloom help ulla down
that face
that face
that lovable face
it melts my swedish heart
im certain if i fall in love
im lost without a trace
but its worth it
for that face

whod think an accountant
would turn out to be my judas
im so dismayed
is this how im repaid
to be
betrayed
betrayed
gentlemen of the jury
have you reached your verdict
yes your honour we have
we find the defendant
incredibly guilty
hold me touch me
im a little busy
does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf
yes your honour i do
i admit for the last 20 years
ive been a lying doublecrossing
twofaced backstabbing
despicable crook
but i had no choice
i was a broadway producer
a man without a conscience
and with no one
who gave a damn about him
and that your honour
is what hurts the most
i thought id at last
found a loyal partner
a man i cared about
and who i thought
cared about me
what breaks my heart is now
when i need him most
hes deserted me
i will probably never see
or hear from him ever again
thats not true
order order in the court
and stop that samba
who are you
i am leopold bloom
max bialystocks partner
and who are you my dear
my name is
ulla lnga hansen benson
yonsen tallenhallen
svaden svanson bloom
bloom
youre his wife
ja your honour
he wouldnt do it
unless we got married
what a schmuck
now mr bloom
why in the world would you
want to come back here
and give yourself up
why to speak on his behalf
we all know that max bialystock
is a lying doublecrossing
twofaced slimy
manipulative underhanded
please
dont help me
your honour your honour
if i may address the court
the law was created to protect
people from being wronged
so whom has
max bialystock wronged
well not these dear ladies
no
and not me not
not me
i was this nobody
no one ever called me  leo before
i mean your honour
i know it isnt a big legal point
but even when i was in kindergarten
everybody always called me  bloom
i guess what im trying to say
is that even when i was in rio
and had everything
id ever dreamed of
i suddenly realized that
that this man
this man
no one ever made me
feel like someone
till him
life was really nothing
but a glum one
till him
my existence bordered on the tragic
always timid
never took a chance
then i felt his magic
and my heart began to dance
i was always frightened
fraught with worry
till him
i was going nowhere in a hurry
till him
he filled up my empty life
filled it to the brim
there could never
ever be another one
like him
leo
leo
i never realized
youre a good singer
thank you
no really like a professional
well i sang it for you max
i sang it because im your friend
you are
ive had a lot of relationships
but you couldnt call
any of them friend
but come to think of it
no one ever ever really knew me
till him
everyone was always out
to screw me
till him
never met a man i ever trusted
always dealt with shysters
in the past
now im welladjusted
cause ive got a friend at last
dont help me
always playing singles
never doubles
till him
never had a pal
to share my troubles
till him
he filled up my empty life
filled it to the brim
filled it to the brim
there could never ever be
another one
like him

to break up
such a beautiful friendship

leo and max
up off our backs
back on the great white way
leo and max
back on our tracks
were back on top to stay
so when we take your money
never fear
well knock broadway
right on its ear
the cast is great
the script is swell
but this were telling you sirs
its just no go
youve got no show
without the producers
well never quit
hit after hit
the producers
leo and max
the overture is over
the curtain starts to rise
youre suddenly in clover
you cant believe your eyes
youre sitting on the aisle
you break into a smile
why this magic feeling
and then you realize
that there is
nothing like a show on broadway
nothing like a broadway show
hearts will skip a beat on broadway
if youre feeling blue
im telling you
thats the place to go
movies drag
their endings sag
tvs just a bore
so hit the street
and move your feet
to the place we all adore
because theres nothing
like a show on broadway
theres nothing
like a broadway show
its often been said
the theatre is dead
the critics repeat it en masse
but the theatres alive
its gonna survive
although its a pain in the ass
you waited forever
and finally got tickets
to get to your seat
you gotta cross pickets
the guy to your right
is frightfully tight
the guy to your left
appears to have rickets
the musics yuck
the lyrics suck
the casting is all wrong
and when you reach the bathroom
the line is five miles long
but still theres nothing
like a show on broadway
theres nothing
like a broadway show
you swear youll never go again
its simply not worthwhile
you make that v ow
and then somehow
youre back there on the aisle
youre back there on the aisle
thats why theres
nothing like a show
on broadway
theres nothing
like a broadway show
till youre in movies
theres nothing
like a broadway show
and though it is expensive
at a hundred bucks a throw
theres nothing
like a broadway show
dont forget to buy mein kampf
in paperback
available near you
at borders books
or barnes  noble
und amazoncom
thanks for coming
to see our show
sad to tell you
we got to go
grab your hat
and head for the door
in case you didnt notice
there aint any more
if you like our show
tell everyone but
if you think it stinks
keep your big mouth shut
were glad you came but
we have to shout
adíos

wiedersehen
