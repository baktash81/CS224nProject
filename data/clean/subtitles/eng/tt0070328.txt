but   and i must emphasise this point  
no formula can  or will 
ever cover each case 
for instance   
   when three or more applicants
have been recognised 
which is in direct contradiction to   
whose funeral is it 
yours 
one more time again 
not married  by any chance  are you 
good morning  007 
good    good morning 
insomnia  sir 
instructions 
you haven t much time 
i ll explain as you pack 
pack  sir 
three agents have been killed
in the last 24 hours 
dawes in new york  hamilton in
new orleans and baines in the caribbean 
baines  i rather liked baines 
we shared the same boot maker 
coffee 
sir 
i take it these killings are connected 
that s precisely
what you re going to find out 
baines was working on a small
caribbean island called san monique 
dawes was in new york 
keeping an eye on its prime minister 
one dr kananga 
hamilton was on loan to the americans
in new orleans 
is that all it does 
by the way  congratulations 
the italians were most impressed
by the way you handled the rome affair 
thank you  sir 
sugar 
thanks 
the authorities
were more than helpful 
there s one small complaint 
they seem to be missing
one of their agents 
a miss    caruso 
you wouldn t happen to know
where she is 
miss moneypenny 
  morning  moneypenny 
  good morning  sir 
  it s only the hour that s indecent 
  really 
i ve got your ticket to new york 
q has repaired your wristwatch 
  and some background on san monique 
  thank you  moneypenny 
i m sure the overburdened british
taxpayer will be fascinated to know
will how the special ordnance section
disburses its funds 
in future  commander  may i suggest
a perfectly adequate watchmaker
just down the street 
good god 
pulling out this button turns the watch
into a hyper intensified magnetic field 
powerful enough to deflect
the path of a bullet
  at long range   or so q claims 
  i feel tempted to test that theory now 
if you don t mind  commander  my spoon 
sorry  sir 
thank you 
dr kananga is at present in new york 
the cia have been informed 
they are helping with surveillance 
your flight arrives at 11 30am 
now  where did i leave my coat 
allow me 
thank you 
come along  miss moneypenny 
  morning  bond 
  sir 
miss moneypenny 
thank you 
goodbye  james 
or should i say     ciao  bello  
such a delicate touch 
sheer magnetism  darling 
a man comes 
he travels quickly 
he has purpose 
 y i he comes over water 
 y i he travels with others 
he will oppose 
he brings violence and destruction 
hello 
  mr leiter for you  sir 
  thank you 
hello  felix  how are you 
 y i traffic permitting 
i should be with you in half an hour 
 y i then you can buy me
the best lunch in new york 
hi  james  your friend kananga
has just left the un 
he s probably headed back
to his embassy 
no  don t worry  the place is eyeballed 
wired for sound   the works 
right  i ll see you in a half hour 
easy  charlie 
let s get there in one piece 
charlie 
right  stand by 
here comes kananga s limousine 
out he gets
with the usual goon squad
and the girl 
time  11 46 
what is that  
felix  you know i hate to trouble you 
but i ve run into a little bother 
you what  
get me a make on a white pimpmobile 
3 4 7  nelson david george 
 y i it would seem  dr kananga 
that the conference has not
lived up to your expectations 
we can only hope that
this is a temporary setback 
however  i do have
some observations to make 
take a letter  please 
to secretary general 
pan lsland unity conference 
sir   
i wish to point out   
that   
 y i too many
of our island neighbours
 y i have once again let themselves be   
bullied by united states industry 
 y i the story is an old one 
 y i the record a clear one 
 y i since my historic statement of principles
 y i was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago 
 y i our economic outlook
has improved dramatically 
 y i by exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favouritism towards none 
 y i new respect for the entire area
has been injected 
 y i and even though some of my   
james  that car is registered
to a shop at 33 east 65th street 
that s only a block away from here 
right  take your time  buddy 
kananga s knitting a flag in there 
 y i it might be the easiest thing to do 
something    in heads 
just browsing  thank you 
five dollars 
do you think you could
giftwrap it for me  please 
lengthwise  if you don t mind 
thank you 
 y i     remains my first concern 
 y i thus san monique s obligations to
her island neighbours would seem clear 
 y i those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation
 y i must perforce look up
to those who stand  proudly 
 y i wrapped in a justifiable self confidence 
 y i the time has come 
painful as it may be 
 y i to gaze out among our sister nations
in the area and see if any stands   
he s tailing 
i got him in my sights 
  you know where you re goin   man 
  uptown  i believe 
uptown  we headin  into harlem  man 
just keep on the tail of that jukebox
and there s an extra  20 for you 
man  for 20 bucks 
i d take you to a ku klux klan cookout 
125th  you got a honky on your tail 
he s heading east 
can t miss him 
it s like following a cue ball 
that s the car 
they must have gone inside 
pull up where you can 
sure hope you make friends easy 
right on  brother 
he s headin  on in 
good afternoon 
  bourbon and water  please 
  the first booth will do 
tell him neat  would you 
  no ice 
  that s extra  man 
i d like something on the side as well 
information 
three men and a girl came in   
relax  baby 
mr big s gonna take care of you
in a minute 
black queen on the red king  miss    
solitaire 
my name s bond 
james bond 
i know who you are 
what you are  and why you ve come 
you ve made a mistake 
you will not succeed 
rather a sweeping statement 
considering we ve never met 
the cards have followed you for me 
you get ripped off in detroit 
you yell out to me  d you hear 
is he armed 
you can t be too careful in new york city 
funny how the least little thing
amuses him 
fascinating 
that s you  quite obviously 
an amazing resemblance 
am i in there as well 
pick a card 
turn it over 
you have found yourself 
i m telling you 
go out to la and clean it up
or i m coming out there
and clean  you  up  and i mean that 
is this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown 
there seems to be some mistake 
my name   
names is for tombstones  baby 
y all take this honky out
and waste him   now 
   waste him   is that a good thing 
  the reading is over 
nothing about my future 
us 
now  promise you ll stay right there 
i shan t be long 
thank you 
keep your hands up  honky 
what s he think this is 
blow his friggin  head off 
drop it 
now 
harold strutter  cia  where were you
when i didn t need you 
it got obvious
you weren t coming out front 
not even with that clever disguise
you were wearing 
a white face in harlem 
good thinking  bond 
let s get outta here 
i m surprised they didn t spot you 
there s a remarkable girl back there
with a deck of cards 
i saw those cards on the way up 
spades  james  every one 
you were nailed the minute you left 74 
only one man can pull together
that much black muscle in this town 
calls himself mr big 
you name the business 
they say he has a black concession 
what would a foreign prime minister
like kananga
want with an american gangster 
question is  what would mr big
want with a two bit island diplomat 
 y i mr big  where the hell
does  he  fit into this mess 
a genuine felix lighter  illuminating 
 y i now listen  james 
kananga s got a private plane and he s
leaving for san monique within the hour 
 y i   get me on the next available flight 
  i already did 
i knew you wouldn t pass up a chance
to get away from where the  real  action is 
the legendary baron samedi  folks 
that s saturday 
for those who speak french 
voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead 
the man who cannot die 
but  for our purposes 
just a performer in a musical
extravaganza we ve cooked up
for you wonderful people 
good evening  the name s bond 
i have a reservation 
mr bond  of course 
mrs bond s been expecting you 
  mrs bond 
  she arrived earlier this afternoon 
said she preferred
something a little more    private 
bungalow 12 
an incurable romantic   mrs bond 
room service  please 
room service 
this is mr bond  bungalow 12 
i d like a bottle of bollinger  please 
slightly chilled 
two glasses  thank you 
anybody home 
your champagne  sir 
  what was that 
  your champagne 
put it on the table  thanks 
  shall i open it 
  what 
shall i open it 
oh  no  i can manage  thank you 
  here you are 
  thank you 
mrs bond  i presume 
i m rosie carver 
i guess i have a little explaining to do 
yes  either you or
dear uncle felix 
custom 38  smith   wesson 
corrugated three inch stock 
no serial number  standard cia issue 
the question is  why point it at me 
the man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter 
i was just trying to be careful 
as for felix leiter  you re right 
i ve worked for cia down here
for some time now 
he cabled me you were coming
and asked if i would help out if i could 
perhaps you d better start
by getting your head together 
  there s a mirror in the bathroom 
  yes 
you re only my second mission 
you know 
my first was baines 
the agent who was killed 
it s a relief to know i m next in line
for the same kind of aid 
  there s a   
  a snake  i should have told you 
you should never go in there
without a mongoose 
i should have never
gotten into any of this 
i m going to be completely useless to you 
i m sure we ll be able
to lick you into shape 
it s    getting late  mrs bond 
tomorrow will be a very busy day 
you see  kananga is
protecting something down here 
something which baines
obviously discovered 
you re going to show me the spot
where baines  body was found 
that  i m afraid 
only leaves us tonight to   
catch up on old times 
felix told me there d be
moments like this 
what did good old felix suggest 
if all else failed 
cyanide pills 
i settled for two bedrooms 
good night  mr bond 
mrs bond 
it s just a hat  darling 
belonging to a small headed man
who lost a fight with a chicken 
it s a warning  get it outta here 
oh  please 
please don t leave me alone tonight 
james  please promise me 
all right  darling 
if you insist    i promise 
thank you 
rosie 
breakfast s up 
rosie 
  are you ready yet 
  what 
i have to see about organising a car 
i ll see you in the lobby 
over here  sir 
guarantee big fish  catch big fish  sir 
hey  baby  over here 
bring your man over here 
just  20  have a date 
you got warm lady 
we got cold beer over here  man 
you wanna catch a big fish  sir 
it s only  2 over here 
good morning 
come on  rosie 
this one seems eager enough 
excuse me 
where can i change 
me    clothes off    where 
stop right there 
turn around slowly 
keep your hands up 
as i was saying  quarrel  a lousy agent 
but the compensations
speak for themselves 
rosie carver  meet the man
who shares my hairbrush 
quarrel junior 
i m really sorry  i could have shot you 
you might have even killed me
if you d taken off the safety catch 
never mind  darling 
you just let us know when we get
to the spot where baines was killed 
it s up in the hills 
just after we clear the next cove 
hey  quarrel 
who the hell lives up there 
that s the house of the kananga woman 
she s supposed to have
the power of the obeah 
no one on the island
dare go up there except him 
he comes again 
 y i there will be violence 
 y i he approaches even now 
by land or water 
water 
he has arrived 
good 
rosie s been more efficient
than i anticipated 
i know where
we could rustle up a car 
beautiful  brave  and now resourceful 
rosie  you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback 
tell me about the future 
is it death 
 y i i said  is it death 
it is death 
they re coming 
rosie knows what to do 
now  i want no bodies this time  no trace 
it s down there 
but    i thought you said
baines was killed up in the hills  darling 
up in the hills  down there 
why don t we have a bite of lunch
and discuss it 
there s an excellent pâté in the hamper 
i m in no hurry 
are you 
no 
james 
you don t know
what finding you has meant to me 
i can imagine 
and you ve no idea
what finding this has meant to me 
you do know what the queen of cups
means in an upside down position 
a deceitful  perverse woman 
a liar  a cheat 
and i d like some answers now 
please   
you don t understand  sir 
they ll kill me if i do 
and i ll kill you if you don t 
but you couldn t  you wouldn t 
not after what we ve just done 
i certainly wouldn t
have killed you before 
it used to be a convincing act  rosie 
it s wearing a little thin now 
it s not an act  it s   
make your choice 
rosie 
you will explain what went wrong 
i see the intervention of a woman 
the girl was about to confess 
we had to kill her 
the trap was set 
tee hee was waiting 
and you saw death 
it must have been the girl s death 
if you do not ask specific questions 
i cannot be responsible for your
misinterpretation of the answers 
these growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me  solitaire 
as they did with your mother before you 
she had the power and lost it 
became useless to me 
you will not make the same mistake 
solitaire 
where is bond now 
where is bond now  
i cannot see
when you are this way with me 
things become unclear 
let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit 
your power exists to serve me 
and it is mine to control 
if and when the time comes i decide you
are to lose it  i myself will take it away 
solitaire  go to sleep  you have made me
angry with you  and i have no wish to be 
tee hee   
put down those cards 
it is a blasphemy 
they tell nothing
to those who cannot see 
but they do  that s a    a bit of luck 
good luck  for both of us 
the cards say we will be lovers 
you are mistaken 
it s impossible  forbidden for me 
now you must go 
but you do believe   
i mean really  believe  in the cards 
they have never lied to me 
then they won t now 
pick one 
you knew the answer before it was given 
strangely enough  somehow   
so did i 
so it s finally happened 
just as it did to my mother   
and her mother before her 
of course it did 
you re visual proof of that  aren t you 
come on  cheer up  darling 
there has to be a first time for everyone 
now tell me 
where s kananga 
i cannot see 
  oh  yes  the cards  i ll get them 
  no 
there s no need to be frightened 
you ll soon be rid of him  i promise 
i promise 
i just need a
little bit of information  that s all 
the power   
i ve lost it 
the high priestess is wife
to the prince no longer of this world 
the spiritual bridge to the secret church 
it was my fate 
by compelling me to earthly love 
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers 
darling  i ve   
a small confession to make 
now  try not to be too upset 
the deck was slightly stacked
in my favour 
it makes no difference 
the physical violation cannot be undone 
when he finds out i ve lost my power   
he ll kill me 
oh  now  come on 
he ll have to find you first 
lovers  lesson number one 
we have no secrets 
for example  i have a boat waiting 
you can be on it 
all i have to know before we leave is   
what goes on back there in voodoo land 
darling  three men and a girl
have been killed in the last four days 
not counting the times
they ve tried to stop me
from discovering
what kananga s protecting 
now  do you want to be
on that boat or not 
i simply read the cards for him 
i have never been there 
and he s never taken me there 
i ve never dared to go 
but i ve looked in the cards 
i ve seen great riches there 
they ll kill you 
us  darling 
they will kill  us  
lovers  lesson number two  togetherness 
till death do us part  or thereabouts 
is there time before we leave
for lesson number three 
absolutely 
there s no sense in going off half cocked 
  this way 
  how can you be so sure 
these scarecrows are to scare
 people  away  you re not scared  are you 
lesson number four 
follow the scarecrows 
  good morning  boss 
  morning 
it s sure gonna be a  beautiful  day 
yes  sir  a  beautiful  day 
they re heading for the hill 
they re here 
if he finds it  kill him 
quick 
we ve lost him  he has the girl 
they re somewhere under the nets 
at any cost   any   bond must die 
unit 2 5  we have picked them up 
 y i base to 2 5  arrest bond 
but i repeat  the girl is not to be touched 
message received and understood 
over and out 
 y i base to all units 
i repeat  the girl is not to be touched 
get out of the way 
sweet mother of pearl 
all change  end of the line 
get down below  quickly 
here  i ll do that  you get her started 
 y i it appears    a bus 
james 
he ll be looking for me now 
i know he ll never stop 
come on  darling 
it s all over 
voodoo land was just poppy fields 
a simple matter of heroin smuggling 
i ll have a word with a man named felix 
turn the case over to him 
and you and i will be off 
by the way  where would you like to go 
anywhere where we can find
one of these 
how quickly can we make it
to new orleans 
santa mina  four hours away   
you could catch a flight
and be there in the morning 
get in touch with felix  tell him to meet
me there tomorrow  royal orleans hotel 
tampa is closer 
hamilton was killed in new orleans 
so there has to be a connection 
and this is a valuable piece
of merchandise we re carrying 
which  with any luck  they ll want back 
royal orleans hotel  please 
are you sure this is the way
to new orleans 
i don t know  but this sure
