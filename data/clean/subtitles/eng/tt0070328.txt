but  and i must emphasise this point
no formula can or will
ever cover each case
for instance
when three or more applicants
have been recognised
which is in direct contradiction to
whose funeral is it
yours
one more time again
not married by any chance are you
good morning 007
good good morning
insomnia sir
instructions
you havent much time
ill explain as you pack
pack sir
three agents have been killed
in the last 24 hours
dawes in new york hamilton in
new orleans and baines in the caribbean
baines i rather liked baines
we shared the same boot maker
coffee
sir
i take it these killings are connected
thats precisely
what youre going to find out
baines was working on a small
caribbean island called san monique
dawes was in new york
keeping an eye on its prime minister
one dr kananga
hamilton was on loan to the americans
in new orleans
is that all it does
by the way congratulations
the italians were most impressed
by the way you handled the rome affair
thank you sir
sugar
thanks
the authorities
were more than helpful
theres one small complaint
they seem to be missing
one of their agents
a miss caruso
you wouldnt happen to know
where she is
miss moneypenny
morning moneypenny
good morning sir
its only the hour thats indecent
really
ive got your ticket to new york
q has repaired your wristwatch
and some background on san monique
thank you moneypenny
im sure the overburdened british
taxpayer will be fascinated to know
will how the special ordnance section
disburses its funds
in future commander may i suggest
a perfectly adequate watchmaker
just down the street
good god
pulling out this button turns the watch
into a hyperintensified magnetic field
powerful enough to deflect
the path of a bullet
at long range  or so q claims
i feel tempted to test that theory now
if you dont mind commander my spoon
sorry sir
thank you
dr kananga is at present in new york
the cia have been informed
they are helping with surveillance
your flight arrives at 1130am
now where did i leave my coat
allow me
thank you
come along miss moneypenny
morning bond
sir
miss moneypenny
thank you
goodbye james
or should i say ciao bello
such a delicate touch
sheer magnetism darling
a man comes
he travels quickly
he has purpose
yihe comes over water
yihe travels with others
he will oppose
he brings violence and destruction
hello
mr leiter for you sir
thank you
hello felix how are you
yitraffic permitting
i should be with you in half an hour
yithen you can buy me
the best lunch in new york
hi james your friend kananga
has just left the un
hes probably headed back
to his embassy
no dont worry the place is eyeballed
wired for sound  the works
right ill see you in a halfhour
easy charlie
lets get there in one piece
charlie
right stand by
here comes kanangas limousine
out he gets
with the usual goon squad
and the girl
time 1146
what is that
felix you know i hate to trouble you
but ive run into a little bother
you what
get me a make on a white pimpmobile
347 nelson david george
yiit would seem dr kananga
that the conference has not
lived up to your expectations
we can only hope that
this is a temporary setback
however i do have
some observations to make
take a letter please
to secretarygeneral
panlsland unity conference
sir
i wish to point out
that
yitoo many
of our island neighbours
yihave once again let themselves be
bullied by united states industry
yithe story is an old one
yithe record a clear one
yisince my historic statement of principles
yiwas delivered and acted upon
some six months ago
yiour economic outlook
has improved dramatically
yiby exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favouritism towards none
yinew respect for the entire area
has been injected
yiand even though some of my
james that car is registered
to a shop at 33 east 65th street
thats only a block away from here
right take your time buddy
kanangas knitting a flag in there
yiit might be the easiest thing to do
something in heads
just browsing thank you
five dollars
do you think you could
giftwrap it for me please
lengthwise if you dont mind
thank you
yi remains my first concern
yithus san moniques obligations to
her island neighbours would seem clear
yithose who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation
yimust perforce look up
to those who stand proudly
yiwrapped in a justifiable selfconfidence
yithe time has come
painful as it may be
yito gaze out among our sister nations
in the area and see if any stands
hes tailing
i got him in my sights
you know where youre goin man
uptown i believe
uptown we headin into harlem man
just keep on the tail of that jukebox
and theres an extra 20 for you
man for 20 bucks
id take you to a ku klux klan cookout
125th you got a honky on your tail
hes heading east
cant miss him
its like following a cue ball
thats the car
they must have gone inside
pull up where you can
sure hope you make friends easy
right on brother

black queen on the red king miss

you cant be too careful in new york city
funny how the least little thing
amuses him

a white face in harlem
good thinking bond
lets get outta here
im surprised they didnt spot you
theres a remarkable girl back there
with a deck of cards
i saw those cards on the way up
spades james every one
you were nailed the minute you left 74
only one man can pull together
that much black muscle in this town
calls himself mr big
you name the business
they say he has a black concession
what would a foreign prime minister
like kananga
want with an american gangster
question is what would mr big
want with a twobit island diplomat
yimr big where the hell
does he fit into this mess
a genuine felix lighter illuminating
yinow listen james
kanangas got a private plane and hes
leaving for san monique within the hour
yi get me on the next available flight
i already did
i knew you wouldnt pass up a chance
to get away from where the real action is
the legendary baron samedi folks
thats saturday
for those who speak french
voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead
the man who cannot die
but for our purposes
just a performer in a musical
extravaganza weve cooked up
for you wonderful people
good evening the names bond

dear uncle felix

the man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter
i was just trying to be careful
as for felix leiter youre right
ive worked for cia down here
for some time now
he cabled me you were coming
and asked if i would help out if i could
perhaps youd better start
by getting your head together
theres a mirror in the bathroom
yes
youre only my second mission
you know
my first was baines
the agent who was killed
its a relief to know im next in line
for the same kind of aid
theres a
a snake i should have told you
you should never go in there
without a mongoose
i should have never
gotten into any of this
im going to be completely useless to you
im sure well be able
to lick you into shape
its getting late mrs bond
tomorrow will be a very busy day
you see kananga is
protecting something down here
something which baines
obviously discovered
youre going to show me the spot
where baines body was found
that im afraid
only leaves us tonight to
catch up on old times
felix told me thered be
moments like this
what did good old felix suggest
if all else failed
cyanide pills
i settled for two bedrooms
good night mr bond
mrs bond
its just a hat darling
belonging to a smallheaded man
who lost a fight with a chicken
its a warning get it outta here
oh please
please dont leave me alone tonight
james please promise me
all right darling
if you insist i promise
thank you

good morning
come on rosie
this one seems eager enough
excuse me
where can i change
me clothes off where
stop right there
turn around slowly
keep your hands up
as i was saying quarrel a lousy agent
but the compensations
speak for themselves
rosie carver meet the man
who shares my hairbrush
quarrel junior
im really sorry i could have shot you
you might have even killed me
if youd taken off the safety catch
never mind darling
you just let us know when we get
to the spot where baines was killed
its up in the hills
just after we clear the next cove
hey quarrel
who the hell lives up there
thats the house of the kananga woman
shes supposed to have
the power of the obeah
no one on the island
dare go up there except him
he comes again
yithere will be violence
yihe approaches even now
by land or water
water
he has arrived
good
rosies been more efficient
than i anticipated
i know where
we could rustle up a car
beautiful brave and now resourceful
rosie you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback
tell me about the future
is it death
yii said is it death
it is death
theyre coming
rosie knows what to do
now i want no bodies this time no trace
its down there
but i thought you said
baines was killed up in the hills darling
up in the hills down there
why dont we have a bite of lunch
and discuss it
theres an excellent pâté in the hamper
im in no hurry
are you
no
james
you dont know
what finding you has meant to me
i can imagine
and youve no idea
what finding this has meant to me
you do know what the queen of cups
means in an upsidedown position
a deceitful perverse woman
a liar a cheat
and id like some answers now
please
you dont understand sir
theyll kill me if i do
and ill kill you if you dont
but you couldnt you wouldnt
not after what weve just done
i certainly wouldnt
have killed you before
it used to be a convincing act rosie
its wearing a little thin now
its not an act its
make your choice
rosie
you will explain what went wrong
i see the intervention of a woman
the girl was about to confess
we had to kill her
the trap was set
tee hee was waiting
and you saw death
it must have been the girls death
if you do not ask specific questions
i cannot be responsible for your
misinterpretation of the answers
these growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me solitaire
as they did with your mother before you
she had the power and lost it
became useless to me
you will not make the same mistake
solitaire
where is bond now
where is bond now
i cannot see
when you are this way with me
things become unclear
let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit
your power exists to serve me
and it is mine to control
if and when the time comes i decide you
are to lose it i myself will take it away
solitaire go to sleep you have made me
angry with you and i have no wish to be
tee hee
put down those cards
it is a blasphemy
they tell nothing
to those who cannot see
but they do thats a a bit of luck
good luck for both of us
the cards say we will be lovers
you are mistaken
its impossible forbidden for me
now you must go
but you do believe
i mean really believe in the cards
they have never lied to me
then they wont now
pick one
you knew the answer before it was given
strangely enough somehow
so did i
so its finally happened
just as it did to my mother
and her mother before her
of course it did
youre visual proof of that arent you
come on cheer up darling
there has to be a first time for everyone
now tell me
wheres kananga
i cannot see
oh yes the cards ill get them
no
theres no need to be frightened
youll soon be rid of him i promise
i promise
i just need a
little bit of information thats all
the power
ive lost it
the high priestess is wife
to the prince no longer of this world
the spiritual bridge to the secret church
it was my fate
by compelling me to earthly love
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers
darling ive
a small confession to make
now try not to be too upset
the deck was slightly stacked
in my favour
it makes no difference
the physical violation cannot be undone
when he finds out ive lost my power
hell kill me
oh now come on
hell have to find you first
lovers lesson number one
we have no secrets
for example i have a boat waiting
you can be on it
all i have to know before we leave is
what goes on back there in voodoo land
darling three men and a girl
have been killed in the last four days
not counting the times
theyve tried to stop me
from discovering
what kanangas protecting
now do you want to be
on that boat or not
i simply read the cards for him
i have never been there
and hes never taken me there
ive never dared to go
but ive looked in the cards
ive seen great riches there
theyll kill you
us darling
they will kill us
lovers lesson number two togetherness
till death do us part or thereabouts
is there time before we leave
for lesson number three

theres no sense in going off halfcocked
this way

these scarecrows are to scare
people away youre not scared are you
lesson number four
follow the scarecrows
