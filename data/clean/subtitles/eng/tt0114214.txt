and that concludes
the lessons for today
my nose
im shocked
the reverend needs a gun
theres plenty of other gun shops
nowhere as cheap
no place is cheap enough for you
your mouth gets faster every day
pity your hands are so slow
i aint got slow hands
put your hand on the counter
put your gun hand on the counter
see cort heres a gunfighters
hand and heres a farmers hand
i aint got a farmers hand
cort and me are killers
the genuine article but you
youre from different stock
my friend here needs a gun
this is the eaglebutt peacemaker
solid ivory handle
only 30 of these were ever made
this is the customized
remington new model
its more accurate than the colt
the handles are solid silver
used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner
this is the best help a man can get
a smith  wesson schofield 45
me and jesse james think
its the best handgun in the world
trigger guard removal
saves drawing time
but if youre drunk
youll kill your feet
when did you last hold a gun
you know when
i got offered 120 for this colt
you want to try it out
have you got 120 cort
i dont have any money
the lord provides me
with everything i need
were wasting this boys time then
ill be a good samaritan
whats the cheapest gun youve got
the cheapest piece of crap youve
got in the whole miserable store
all right
five bucks
sold
what are you doing
the preachers got the lord on
his side he only needs one bullet
otherwise he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town
that gun shoots straight
its okay i wont draw
you will i know you when it comes
down to it youll pull the trigger
ive got money on you preacher
ive got 20 bucks on you foy
thats money in the bank jimmy
preacher boy youre a dead man
bless me lord
forgive me for my sins
he shot me
you didnt lay down and die
you said you werent gonna fight
it felt natural didnt it
nice and smooth
i thought you werent gonna fight
youre pretty fast
i hope i dont have to fight you
you have a choice to be here
he made you do it
i was the only one
who pulled the trigger
this aint much of a town
for a preacher
i wasnt always a preacher
cort was an outlaw like us
werent you
in fact he used to ride with me
of course thats all changed now
hes a man of peace
he wouldnt hurt a fly
easy
there was a time
when you couldnt tell us apart
is that true
is that true
yes
i shouldve let you die
its yours go ahead take it
you smell good
what are you looking at
a dirty old man and a little girl
this is a business discussion
im offering her a job
just make sure you wash
wherever he touches you
one of these days im gonna
have to shoot you up real good
mr hanlon i wanted to ask you
about lndian wells
did that fight really take place
it sure did
you gunned down four men
i had a gun in each hand
the truth is
i am just as good with either hand
you must be the fastest gun
in the west  or the biggest liar
its a pity
you werent there to find out
but i was i was the one who really
killed the terence brothers
i doubt that a lying chickenshit
like you was even in the same state
how about that left hand ace
how about that lefthanded draw
mr ace hanlon
scourge of the sagebrush
the terror of tucson
a bladder full of hot air
daddy
string him up put him on a chair
daddy
theyre calling for you
on the street
are you really gonna do it
what if you get killed
then i wont have to answer
any more of your dumb questions
miss
what
you can do it
theres a click before the strike
listen to the clock
the last fight of the day
fire at the first chime
youre gonna die now girl
youre dead meat
look at you are you scared
youre trembling like a leaf
theres a click before the strike
listen to the clock
the lady is the winner
damn
come back here
quickfiring resumes
tomorrow at noon
i think youre great
grow up
thanks
dinner tonight
john herod
thirsty
no need to go to all that trouble
just for me
last night the kidtonight herod
youre a busy woman
any man youre not interested in
yeah you
youre looking at me and thinking
we have nothing in common
but we do were both winners
how do you feel
after surviving your first day
the same as yesterday
no your eyes are shining
youve passed a test
you feel alive
i guess it doesnt excite me
as much as it does you
you think i do this contest
because its fun
look at this town these people
would kill you for your bootlaces
this way i get to face my enemies
they cant shoot me in the back
and of course i always win
one day your luck will run out
i dont win because im lucky
apres vous
why did you come here tonight
you invited me
you couldve turned me down
i wanted to see what youre like
what kind of man am l
the kind people hate
im not trying to be popular
the people in this town need me
i bring a sense of order
to their lives
not law order
like hanging a preacher
hes no preacher hes a fraud
if a man is a killer
thats what he is
that same man cant tell me
its not in his blood any more
hes the worst kind of liar
why does he upset you so much
i find myself almost
uncontrollably attracted to you
id think a man like you
would have a woman
i was married to a beautiful woman
she was unfaithful
where is she now
i told you  she was unfaithful
why are you really here
like i said for the money
id give you all the money you want
i wouldnt feel like id earned it
yes you would
did you ever kill anyone
sure
i dont think so it all comes down
to how far youre prepared to go
all the way
my father was a judge
that surprises you
he used to make my mother and
me watch people being hanged
one day he said there was
too much bad in this world
he took a bullet put it in
his gun and spun the chamber
then he took it in turns
clicking it at each of us
until he finally blew
the back of his head off
with the final click
understand this
there is nothing on this
earth that frightens me now
nothing
l have to go
l shouldnt have come here
who are you
let me go
l apologize for my
undignified behaviour
but sometimes its hard
to get a drink around here
l was only a kid when l
hitched up with herod
he singled me out because l was
a little smarter and a
little faster than most
first completely
fearless man l had ever met
and he wanted me to
be just as same as him
we used to go revenue collecting
along the border
just the two of us
like some families go on picnics
we are down the
galls taking the bank
and walked out to a
street full of federal soldiers
we got shot up so bad
this padre hid us in his mission
he tended our wounds fed us
talked to both of us for hours
when we were strong enough to head
home herod told me to shoot him
when l said no
he put a gun to the back of my head
and started to count down from ten
so l killed the priest
lt doesnt matter what l do now
lm already damned l know that
dont go down that road you
dont have to become like me
why did you call me up here  well l
wanted to ask you one simple question
who brought you here to fight me
mr herod
lm just a gentleman adventurer moves in
the town for the challenge of a gunfight
l thought ace hanlon was the
hired gun l was so sure of it
but he was just a buffoon
youre not
my names clay cantrell
and lm a shootist
lve killed 1 7 men
killing is purely a business preposition
for me lt doesnt give me any pleasure
my employer is confidential
do we have business together today
as soon as the rain stops lm
going to make an example of you
then he said give me the gun
what could l do l gave it to him
like hell l did
you got him
yep thats the story
of a flat nose freddy
who currently resides
six feet under  how man
lts a big thing for
you to enter the contest
youve made your point
now l want you to step down
no disgrace
lll step down when you step down
lm telling you to step down

the eight remaining contestants

contestant left standing

well l was
planning to kill you anyway

spineless cowards is how poor you are
how you cant afford
my taxes my protection
yet somehow youve all
managed to find the money
to hire a professional
gunfighter to kill me
wheres all this money coming from
what am l to think
lf youve got so much to spare lm
just gonna take some more off you
because you clearly
ignore the message
this is my town
lf you live to see the dawn
its because l allow it
lm in charge of everything
l decide who lives or who dies
your gunfighters dead
old news
ls it possible
ls it possible to
improve on perfection
the mans dead
the kids the winner
l heard him l heard
him move his hand
l tell you people l
am on a different level
lnfact l am the new
goddamn mayor of this town
wonderful
he stinks worse dead

your father  l dont

youve been hours looking
for his grave hes not here
herods men they
smashed the gravestone l made
and then they burned his body
till there was nothing left
there are good people here
theyre just cowards like me
and theyre waiting hoping for
someone like you to come and stop him
l cant l cant kill him
l had my chance and l was scared
lm scared of dying
youve been dead since it happened
youre more scared of living
lt will be the same
if you keep riding
l pulled this from the fire
he was the best friend l ever had
string him up put him on a chair
say your prayers
heres the rope
daddy no
put her down goddamn it
no
hello bunny
whats wrong with you
what the hell thats mr
herods prisoner
l hope you dont think lve sunk
to some base level of humanity
the bible speaks of turning
ploughsheds and sword against evil
and l feel that it must be
gods will that lm here
so l
l
and l
oh god
why are you doing this to me  because
we could both be dead tomorrow
promise me promise me
youll leave herod for me
l challenge you
go away
lm not fighting
anybody else l wanted you
lve already been challenged
sir its time for me to
see if lm my fathers equal
you would fight your own son
lm gonna kill you if l have to
ride all the way to hell to do it
do you have some
particular problem with me
lll let you know
lm not fighting you

nobody walks out on this contest
no body stands down
you dont tell me what to do
lf you try to leave
town my men will kill you
lf refuse to fight
my men will kill you
you had your chance to
quit and now its gone
clear the street
round three only
four contestants left
mr herod fights the kid
then the lady fights cort
clear the street
you dont have to do this everybody
out here knows youre the best
lt aint about that lm his son
lf this is the only way he
is going to admit that
so be it
what can you possibly get
out of this what do you want
all l want is his respect
l love you
bravo
we are with you
drop out youve made your point
the gunfight is in the head
not in the hands
the only thing that
makes him invincible
because you all think he is
maybe five years ago
he was the fastest
but
time catches up with everyone
hes just a little bit slower than
he used to be and as for myself
could you believe it
l just reached my peak
shit that was fast
no no oh my
oh my god
did l get him
yeah kid you got him
did l kill him
you were so fast kid
l dont want to die
l dont want to die
l know
lt was never proved
that he was my son
lt was a farmer that
he wasnt mine
l gave him a way out
he wouldnt take it
what kind of ink do you have
any kind you need
lf neither one of you fire by
the time l count down from ten
my men will gun you down
ten nine
draw your gun no point
both of us dying  eight

you son of a bitch
ls this what you wanted all along
wait till you get some
son of a bitch
of course well fight
but the rules say tomorrow
lll even let you name the time
dawn
break my nose twice
now well see how fast you can draw
who did that
l did that mr herod
that how you ruined the contest
youve got 20
seconds to get out of town
thats not fair lve only ever
done what you told me to mr herod
you now have 15 seconds
goodbye ratsy
bullshit bullshit bullshit
what do you think cort
theres a lot of
people here that
want entertainment
l could draw with my left hand
how does that sound
of course unlike mr ace hanlon l
really can fight with both hands
how do you feel lm nervous
lt takes a lot to scare me
l love the sensation
times up ratsy
l always wanted to fight you cort
ever since the first time l saw you
lts just this itch
that l had to scratch
whatever happens if hes still
standing in the end gun him down
youre dead youre dead
