your own little piece of heaven 
sunshine  cactus flowers
and you and the orphan children 
we burned that mission down 
just like you said 
all that work  cort    
all those years of hard work
destroyed for no reason 
it must make you angry 
you used to be fast 
are you still fast 
don t i get an answer 
have you taken a vow of silence 
i said  are you still fast 
faster than you 
but i have renounced violence 
we ll see 
string him up 
in here  on the chair

pull him up  foy 
let me make it clear    
i want you in that contest

  three to one 
gentlemen  remember

  until that clock
makes the first chime of the hour 
what if somebody gets excited
and starts shooting early 
any cheats
will be eliminated from the contest 
whoever is standing after the draw
is the winner 
if both men are still standing 
you must continue firing 
gentlemen  the street is yours

spotted horse cannot be killed
by a bullet  see 
four bullets in my arm  three in
my left leg and two in the back 
another bullet went through my lip 
another through my left foot 
today a bullet went into my head
and it s not even come out yet

and that concludes
the lessons for today 
  my nose 
  i m shocked 
  the reverend needs a gun 
  there s plenty of other gun shops 
  nowhere as cheap 
  no place is cheap enough for you 
your mouth gets faster every day 
pity your hands are so slow 
  i ain t got slow hands 
  put your hand on the counter 
put your gun hand on the counter 
see  cort  here s a gunfighter s
hand  and here s a farmer s hand 
i ain t got a farmer s hand 
cort and me are killers 
the genuine article  but you    
you re from different stock 
my friend here needs a gun 
this is the eagle butt peacemaker 
solid ivory handle 
only 30 of these were ever made 
this is the customized
remington new model 
it s more accurate than the colt 
the handles are solid silver 
used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner 
this is the best help a man can get 
a smith   wesson schofield  45 
me and jesse james think
it s the best handgun in the world 
trigger guard removal
saves drawing time 
but if you re drunk 
you ll kill your feet 
  when did you last hold a gun 
  you know when 
i got offered 120 for this colt 
you want to try it out 
  have you got  120  cort 
  i don t have any money 
the lord provides me
with everything i need 
we re wasting this boy s time then 
i ll be a good samaritan 
what s the cheapest gun you ve got 
the cheapest piece of crap you ve
got in the whole miserable store 
all right    
  five bucks 
  sold 
what are you doing 
the preacher s got the lord on
his side  he only needs one bullet 
otherwise he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town 
  that gun shoots straight 
  it s okay  i won t draw 
you will  i know you  when it comes
down to it  you ll pull the trigger 
i ve got money on you  preacher 
  i ve got 20 bucks on you  foy 
  that s money in the bank  jimmy 
preacher boy  you re a dead man 
bless me  lord 
forgive me for my sins 
  he shot me 
  you didn t lay down and die 
you said you weren t gonna fight 
it felt natural  didn t it 
nice and smooth 
i thought you weren t gonna fight 
you re pretty fast 
i hope i don t have to fight you 
  you have a choice to be here 
  he made you do it 
i was the only one
who pulled the trigger 
this ain t much of a town
for a preacher 
  i wasn t always a preacher 
  cort was an outlaw  like us 
weren t you 
in fact  he used to ride with me 
of course  that s all changed now 
he s a man of peace 
he wouldn t hurt a fly 
easy    
there was a time
when you couldn t tell us apart 
is that true 
  is that true 
  yes 
i should ve let you die 
it s yours  go ahead  take it 
you smell good 
  what are you looking at 
  a dirty old man and a little girl 
this is a business discussion 
i m offering her a job 
just make sure you wash
wherever he touches you 
one of these days  i m gonna
have to shoot you up real good 
mr  hanlon  i wanted to ask you
about lndian wells 
  did that fight really take place 
  it sure did 
  you gunned down four men 
  i had a gun in each hand 
the truth is
i am just as good with either hand 
you must be the fastest gun
in the west     or the biggest liar 
it s a pity
you weren t there to find out 
but i was  i was the one who really
killed the terence brothers 
i doubt that a lying chicken shit
like you was even in the same state 
how about that left hand  ace 
how about that left handed draw 
mr  ace hanlon 
scourge of the sagebrush 
the terror of tucson 
a bladder full of hot air 
daddy 
string him up  put him on a chair 
daddy 
they re calling for you
on the street 
are you really gonna do it 
what if you get killed 
then i won t have to answer
any more of your dumb questions 
  miss    
  what 
you can do it 
there s a click before the strike 
listen to the clock 
the last fight of the day 
fire at the first chime 
you re gonna die now  girl 
you re dead meat 
look at you  are you scared 
you re trembling like a leaf 
there s a click before the strike 
listen to the clock 
the lady is the winner 
  damn 
  come back here 
quick firing resumes
tomorrow at noon 
  i think you re great 
  grow up 
thanks 
dinner tonight
john herod
thirsty 
no need to go to all that trouble
just for me 
last night the kid tonight herod 
you re a busy woman 
  any man you re not interested in 
  yeah  you 
you re looking at me and thinking 
we have nothing in common 
but we do  we re both winners 
how do you feel
after surviving your first day 
  the same as yesterday 
  no  your eyes are shining 
you ve passed a test 
you feel alive 
i guess it doesn t excite me
as much as it does you 
you think i do this contest
because it s fun 
look at this town  these people
would kill you for your bootlaces 
this way i get to face my enemies 
they can t shoot me in the back 
  and of course i always win 
  one day your luck will run out 
i don t win because i m lucky 
apres vous 
  why did you come here tonight 
  you invited me 
you could ve turned me down 
  i wanted to see what you re like 
  what kind of man am l 
the kind people hate 
i m not trying to be popular 
the people in this town need me 
i bring a sense of order
to their lives 
  not law  order 
  like hanging a preacher 
he s no preacher  he s a fraud 
if a man is a killer 
that s what he is 
that same man can t tell me
it s not in his blood any more 
  he s the worst kind of liar 
  why does he upset you so much 
i find myself almost
uncontrollably attracted to you 
i d think a man like you
would have a woman 
i was married to a beautiful woman 
  she was unfaithful 
  where is she now 
i told you     she was unfaithful 
  why are you really here 
  like i said  for the money 
i d give you all the money you want 
i wouldn t feel like i d earned it 
yes  you would 
  did you ever kill anyone 
  sure 
i don t think so  it all comes down
to how far you re prepared to go 
all the way 
my father was a judge 
that surprises you 
he used to make my mother and
me watch people being hanged 
one day he said there was
too much bad in this world 
  he took a bullet  put it in
his gun and spun the chamber   
then he took it in turns 
clicking it at each of us  
  until he finally blew
the back of his head off  
  with the final click 
understand this  
there is nothing on this
earth that frightens me now 
nothing 
l have to go 
l shouldn t have come here 
who are you 
let me go 
l apologize for my
undignified behaviour  
  but sometimes it s hard
to get a drink around here 
l was only a kid when l
hitched up with herod 
he singled me out because l was  
  a little smarter and a
little faster than most 
first completely
fearless man l had ever met  
  and he wanted me to
be just as same as him 
we used to go revenue collecting  
    along the border 
just the two of us   
like some families go on picnics 
we are down the
galls taking the bank  
  and walked out to a
street full of federal soldiers 
we got shot up so bad 
  this padre hid us in his mission 
he tended our wounds  fed us    
  talked to both of us for hours 
  when we were strong enough to head
home  herod told me to shoot him   
when l said no  
  he put a gun to the back of my head
and started to count down from ten 
so l killed the priest 
  lt doesn t matter what l do now 
l m already damned  l know that   
don t go down that road  you
don t have to become like me 
why did you call me up here    well   l
wanted to ask you one simple question 
who brought you here to fight me 
mr  herod  
l m just a gentleman adventurer moves in
the town for the challenge of a gunfight 
l thought ace hanlon was the
hired gun  l was so sure of it 
but he was just a buffoon 
you re not 
  my name s clay cantrell 
and l m a shootist   
l ve killed 1 7 men 
killing is purely a business preposition
for me  lt doesn t give me any pleasure 
my employer is confidential 
do we have business together today 
  as soon as the rain stops  l m
going to make an example of you   
  then he said   give me the gun    
what could l do  l gave it to him 
like hell l did 
  you got him 
yep  that s the story
of a flat nose freddy  
  who currently resides
six feet under    how man 
lt s a big thing for
you to enter the contest 
you ve made your point 
now l want you to step down 
no disgrace 
l ll step down when you step down 
l m telling you to step down 
your time will come 
not with you still around 
don t ever cross me 
and don t try to stare me
down like you re doing now 
l m not sick or old  and
you re not half the man l am 
round two 
  four fights today  featuring
the eight remaining contestants   
the winner is the
contestant left standing 
left alive 
  left alive  from now on 
we fight to the death   
  well   well    what a surprise 
john  you changing the rules   
any problem with that 
well   l was
planning to kill you anyway 
  gentlemen  the street is yours   
l m confused 
all l hear from you   you
spineless cowards is how poor you are 
  how you can t afford
my taxes  my protection   
yet somehow you ve all
managed to find the money  
  to hire a professional
gunfighter to kill me 
where s all this money coming from 
what am l to think 
  lf you ve got so much to spare  l m
just gonna take some more off you   
because you clearly
ignore the message
this is my town 
  lf you live to see the dawn 
it s because l allow it   
l m in charge of everything 
l decide who lives or who dies 
your gunfighter s dead 
old news 
ls it possible 
ls it possible to
improve on perfection 
the man s dead 
the kid s the winner 
l heard him  l heard
him move his hand 
  l tell you people  l
am on a different level   
  lnfact  l am the new
goddamn mayor of this town   
wonderful 
he stinks worse dead 
storm coming up  no more fights
till we see what it s gonna do 
fix on me fellas 
we re gonna have to bury this old
man deep  he stinks something awful 
get up 
go  get the hell out of here 
get the hell out of here 
yep 
that little girl is
gonna be a real good earner 
  deal me in  boys 
  all right   
l feel lucky

mouthful of gold teeth

forgiveness if you ask for it 
come on  preacher 
  thank you  ratsy 
  goodbye   
  hey  what are you doing 
not quitting  are you

probably the wrong time but  
  l like you and l want you to stay 
how can you live like this 
  live like what 
aren t you even going to stay
for cort s fight    no  l m not 
wait it will start any minute now
and then     l don t care about them 
  l don t care about you  or
anybody else in this town   
l m through 
l don t think you heard me right 
l said l liked you 
spotted horse cannot
be killed by a bullet 
the man s dead  cort s the winner 
he killed that lndian 
spotted horse cannot
be killed by a bullet 
give me another bullet 
l thought l explained the rules
to you very carefully 
you have to kill the man 
  give me another bullet 
john  somebody give me a bullet   
38 long colt 
 l shall not kill  
that s what you told me 
 l have renounced all violence  
  now goddamn it 
now 
  congratulations  looks like you re
going to the next round  preacher   
applause him 
bravo 
welcome back   killer 
bastard 
give me that 
  l knew l d find you here 
  you know who l am 
of course l do  l
brought you into this world 
  your father     l don t
want to talk about it  
you ve been hours looking
for his grave  he s not here 
herod s men   they
smashed the gravestone l made 
and then they burned his body
till there was nothing left 
there are good people here 
they re just cowards   like me 
  and they re waiting  hoping for
someone like you to come and stop him   
l can t  l can t kill him 
l had my chance and l was scared 
  l m scared of dying   
you ve been dead since it happened 
you re more scared of living 
lt will be the same
if you keep riding 
l pulled this from the fire 
he was the best friend l ever had 
string him up  put him on a chair 
  say your prayers 
  here s the rope 
daddy  no 
put her down goddamn it 
no 
  hello  bunny   
what s wrong with you 
what the hell  that s mr 
herod s prisoner 
l hope you don t think l ve sunk
to some base level of humanity 
the bible speaks of turning  
ploughsheds and sword against evil 
and l feel that it must be
god s will that l m here 
so l  
l  
and l  
oh god  
why are you doing this to me    because
we could both be dead tomorrow 
promise me   promise me
you ll leave herod for me 
l challenge you 
go away 
l m not fighting
anybody else  l wanted you 
l ve already been challenged 
  sir  it s time for me to
see if l m my father s equal   
you would fight your own son 
l m gonna kill you if l have to
ride all the way to hell to do it 
do you have some
particular problem with me 
l ll let you know 
l m not fighting you 
  l m not fighting you 
l came here to kill herod  and
that s what l m gonna to do 
stand down 
  l will not stand down 
stand down and let me take him in
the final  he ll be just as dead 
let me make something
clear to both of you 
you are going to fight 
nobody walks out on this contest 
no body stands down 
you don t tell me what to do 
lf you try to leave
town my men will kill you 
  lf refuse to fight 
my men will kill you   
you had your chance to
quit and now it s gone 
clear the street 
round three  only
four contestants left 
mr  herod fights the kid 
then the lady fights cort 
clear the street 
you don t have to do this  everybody
out here knows you re the best 
lt ain t about that  l m his son 
lf this is the only way he
is going to admit that  
  so be it 
what can you possibly get
out of this  what do you want 
all l want is his respect 
l love you 
bravo 
  we are with you 
drop out  you ve made your point 
  the gunfight is in the head 
not in the hands   
the only thing that
makes him invincible  
  because you all think he is 
maybe five years ago
he was the fastest  
  but  
  time catches up with everyone 
he s just a little bit slower than
he used to be  and as for myself  
  could you believe it 
l just reached my peak 
shit  that was fast 
no  no  oh my  
oh my god 
  did l get him 
  yeah  kid  you got him   
did l kill him 
  you were so fast  kid 
  l don t want to die   
l don t want to die 
l know 
lt was never proved
that he was my son 
lt was a farmer that  
he wasn t mine 
l gave him a way out 
he wouldn t take it 
what kind of ink do you have 
  any kind you need 
lf neither one of you fire by
the time l count down from ten  
  my men will gun you down 
ten   nine  
  draw your gun  no point
both of us dying   eight 
  seven    draw that gun damn it 
    six    kill me  ellen

  chicken for dinner every time 
  you re gonna burn for this
