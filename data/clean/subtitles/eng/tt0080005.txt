of falling bombs

still he thought only of the new order 
only about the dream 
a dream for which i have lived 
a dream    that you have destroyed 
herr brandt   
we thought we could protect you
better by using the sicilian 
sicilian  he is an american gangster 
sam diagusta 
a common criminal  a mob boss 
you give him the jewels to sell
and he steals the money 
you say to me   how i was to know

herr brandt   
we have made a terrible mistake 
but steps are being taken 
to make matters worse   
you come to me saying
you ve killed him 
how does this help  huh  huh 
before he died 
he told us where he put the money 
in a safety deposit box
in san francisco 
now it s simply a matter
of getting the money out of the box 
  how is this to be done 
  very easily  herr brandt 
we have diagusta s wife 
we ll hold her
until the banks open in the morning 
we ll take her there 
and have her open the box 
in two days  i will be in los angeles 
you will hand this money to me 
herr beuler   
or you will pay for your failure   
with your life 
herr doctor  i accept the challenge 
nothing   
nobody will stand in our way 
nobody 
we ll just drill the box

the russian made tokarev 3 5 automatic
swaying slightly in her ivory hand 
she screamed at me and fired 
i took the lead high in my shoulder
and felt that trapdoor open 
i was down the rabbit hole again 
down in the darkness
where father time wears a frocked coat
and holds your life
like a conductor s watch 
the seconds ticking down to zero 
i d been here before 
death s waiting room 
the outer office to eternity 
savage says   the ones with the cute
names are hiding something  
tink was hiding a killer instinct

if i might speak candidly 
i m not that optimistic 
bull 
when the going gets rough 
the dress clerks jump out 
the tigers jump in and take the profits 
it s been that way 
it will continue like this 
you have to find out 
are you a dress clerk or a tiger 
i was thinking that maybe 
before we have
too many financial responsibilities   
maybe is the time to 
as the saying goes   change horses  
and well  i ve been giving much thought
to commercial real estate 
a lot of thought

gusty

i thought you had diagusta s wife 
i thought she was gonna open
the box for us 
all i know is when we got in there 
this guy had already cleaned it out 
we chased him to the airport 
look  colonel

i want that terminal in la covered 
i don t care how many men it takes 
i m gonna be on the next plane 
make me a reservation 
 i was down there again  sitting
on the old man s black couch 
the one with bloodstains 
old men and dead hookers
lounged there with me 
the voices of my mates came through
a wire and spilled out at me
through a broken speaker
screeching my obituary 
mark savage  hollywood tough guy 
iced by a dippy dame
with a ten pound russian cannon 
i should have known she was a no go
the day her mother came to my office
spilling cigarette ashes and wheezing
at me through yellow teeth 
 find my daughter   she said 
i found her  she punched
my ticket with cold lead
and sent me to this place 
savage says if you want to know
about a girl  look at her mother 
 cause that s what she ll be
in 20 years 
her mother was a killer 
and under all that beauty  so was she 
i had ignored that advice
and so i got what i deserved  
oh  boy 
is this seat taken 
no  no  no  go ahead 
i was in b 23 
next to this yucky stockbroker 
he kept trying to get me
to invest in his sex life 
  martha gribb  i m a singer 
  lionel whitney 
i m a    stockbroker 
wingtips  conservative tie  aqua velva 
the whole depressing package 
  what kind of a singer 
  what kind of a stock     you first 
well  i m in institutional sales 
it s really a great field 
you get to go to lunch
with important executives and   
well  go to new york and   
well  it s just really  um   
institutional could be the word
i m looking for 
were you in san francisco on business 
no  with my fiancée and her family
to buy our wedding silver
and bunny s trousseau 
bunny is my fiancée 
mr lacrosse had some business 
he s bunny s father 
also my boss
at gray  johnson   smith in la 
what we did was  well  he and i went
to the san francisco office 
it was   
well  a terrific holiday
and we had lots of fun 
listen  maybe you can help me 
i m trying to decide on a new name 
a stage name 
and my agent made these up  he doesn t
think martha gribb is a winner 
  sissy sherman    amber lane 
  i don t like that one 
gigi wilson    mimi st  cloud 
  well  i don t know 
  lousy  huh 
i ve this theory   
beware of girls with cute names 
they re hiding something 
so you marry a girl named bunny 
  oh  i m sorry  i was only kidding 
  no  it s ok 
she was a cheerleader 
that s what everybody calls 
  i m sure she s darling 
  she is  she is 
  we have a lot in common 
  like what 
well  what we do is    we spend time   
we like to read 
she s got a terrific sense of humour 
she collects antique chess sets   
oh  you play chess 
no 
no  i don t 
i watch sometimes
when bunny and her father play 
you play clue 
i haven t played in years 
but it was a terrific game 
i ve got one in my bag 
do you wanna play 
  yeah  let s 
  oh  terrific 
lionel  it s gonna be ok 
i mean  when people get married 
they tend to have second thoughts 
and evaluate where they re going 
the thing you have to do is listen
to yourself  listen to what you want 
you know what i want 
you know what i d like to do 
i d like to maybe buy a boat
and go sailing 
just me and bunny up the coast
to vancouver 
give us a chance
to know one another better 
get to know one another 
it was very quick with us 
only three months   
sexual attraction 
i don t really get along
with her father 
i think he was about to can me
when we announced our engagement 
subconsciously 
maybe i was trying to save my job
and bunny was trying to get back
at her folks for something 
well  we sort of got caught up in it 
it was fun and parties and 
did i tell you she is very pretty 
no  you didn t 
you be colonel mustard 
he s an adventurer like you 
i ll be miss scarlet 
she s sexy and has a past 
do you think daughters turn out
to be like their mothers 
do they end up looking
like their mothers 20 years later 
i don t know 
i guess it s possible 
i suppose you ll have to roll the dice
and find out 
i m getting patched through now

i m trying to get through to don rico 
donato 
donato  yeah  i m with tommy  hold on

and dumped her out at the bank 
she was really bummed out
over your uncle sam being killed 
and she s kinda in shock or something 
i had dr goldberg look her over 
who  what  where  why  gimme those 
we think your uncle sam was selling
some jewels for a nazi named beuler 
we ve got no first name or nothing 
your uncle tried to stiff them
and these nazis killed him 
where 
we ain t sure yet 
we picked up one of his guys 
but the guy didn t stand up too well
under pressure 
mike and me chopped a couple of fingers 
he went out before we could brace him 
i need a town  donny 
until i get a town  i m sitting here
on the ground with my finger up my nose 
maybe la  the guy was yelling
something  sounded like la 
when he fuzzed out on us 
get what he knows 
then help him find the river 
one other thing  your aunt
celeste says these guys  nazis 
were chasing a shine outside the bank 
nobody knows who he is

every minute  la 
so let me see 
i m in the library with you at last

there about a million years ago 
it s my first real booking 
i ve been at the music conservatory
in new york for 3 years

loose and take the shot 
  it must be exciting 
  oh  is it ever 
i mean  when i m up there  you know 
with the mic in my hands 
singing a number   
entertaining is like being on top
of the highest mountain 
and if they love you  they applaud 
if they stand up and applaud  my heart
races and you can t get enough air   
and you feel warm all over 
and if they don t 
that s horrible  it s just horrible 
the way i look at it 
you ll never get the highs
if you don t risk the lows

if you get my drift 
is e l  turner a black guy 
good looking 
about medium height and muscular 
about 35 or 36 
  that s the guy 
  ok 
what this man has done to me
would fill a book 
i was returning from san francisco 
he claimed to be a driver
and he picked us up  me and my fiancée
and her family  at the airport 
he drove us home and some guys
started chasing us 
then i was arrested for stealing
the limo and this turner 
if that s his name

this guy  hemmet  says my uncle was
fencing some diamonds for some nazi
named beuler 
he says my uncle sam sold the diamonds 
kept the whole bundle   
told beuler to go whistle for it 
so beuler and his nazi friends   
he put one in my uncle sam s forehead 
in his forehead 
this makes me mad 
they pick up my aunt celeste   
and they scare her silly 
she tells them the money
from the diamonds
is in uncle sam s safety deposit box 
so  they drag poor aunt celeste
down there to open the box 
that s where i m missing a piece 
how the money gets from the box to this
guy  tenspeed turner  is a mystery 
but he ends up with it
and they re chasing him 
the money is fine  i mean  i like money

but for killing my uncle sam 
this is something for which
i will demand payment
