but steps are being taken
to make matters worse
you come to me saying
youve killed him
how does this help huh huh
before he died
he told us where he put the money
in a safety deposit box
in san francisco
now its simply a matter
of getting the money out of the box
how is this to be done
very easily herr brandt
we have diagustas wife
well hold her
until the banks open in the morning
well take her there
and have her open the box

the russianmade tokarev 35 automatic
swaying slightly in her ivory hand
she screamed at me and fired
i took the lead high in my shoulder
and felt that trapdoor open

names are hiding something

i dont care how many men it takes
im gonna be on the next plane
make me a reservation
i was down there again sitting
on the old mans black couch
the one with bloodstains
old men and dead hookers
lounged there with me
the voices of my mates came through
a wire and spilled out at me
through a broken speaker
screeching my obituary
mark savage hollywood tough guy
iced by a dippy dame
with a tenpound russian cannon
i should have known she was a nogo
the day her mother came to my office
spilling cigarette ashes and wheezing
at me through yellow teeth
find my daughter she said
i found her she punched
my ticket with cold lead
and sent me to this place
savage says if you want to know
about a girl look at her mother
cause thats what shell be
in 20 years
her mother was a killer
and under all that beauty so was she
i had ignored that advice
and so i got what i deserved
oh boy
is this seat taken
no no no go ahead
i was in b23
next to this yucky stockbroker
he kept trying to get me
to invest in his sex life
martha gribb im a singer
lionel whitney
im a stockbroker
wingtips conservative tie aqua velva
the whole depressing package
what kind of a singer
what kind of a stock you first

to the san francisco office
it was
well a terrific holiday
and we had lots of fun
listen maybe you can help me
im trying to decide on a new name
a stage name
and my agent made these up he doesnt
think martha gribb is a winner
sissy sherman amber lane
i dont like that one
gigi wilson mimi st cloud
well i dont know
lousy huh
ive this theory
beware of girls with cute names
theyre hiding something
so you marry a girl named bunny
oh im sorry i was only kidding
no its ok
she was a cheerleader
thats what everybody calls
im sure shes darling
she is she is
we have a lot in common
like what
well what we do is we spend time
we like to read
shes got a terrific sense of humour
she collects antique chess sets
oh you play chess

when bunny and her father play
you play clue
i havent played in years
but it was a terrific game
ive got one in my bag
do you wanna play
yeah lets
oh terrific
lionel its gonna be ok
i mean when people get married
they tend to have second thoughts
and evaluate where theyre going
the thing you have to do is listen
to yourself listen to what you want
you know what i want
you know what id like to do
id like to maybe buy a boat
and go sailing
just me and bunny up the coast
to vancouver
give us a chance
to know one another better
get to know one another
it was very quick with us
only three months
sexual attraction
i dont really get along
with her father
i think he was about to can me
when we announced our engagement
subconsciously
maybe i was trying to save my job
and bunny was trying to get back
at her folks for something
well we sort of got caught up in it
it was fun and parties and
did i tell you she is very pretty
no you didnt
you be colonel mustard
hes an adventurer like you
ill be miss scarlet
shes sexy and has a past
do you think daughters turn out
to be like their mothers

donato
donato yeah im with tommy hold on

i had dr goldberg look her over
who what where why gimme those
we think your uncle sam was selling
some jewels for a nazi named beuler
weve got no first name or nothing
your uncle tried to stiff them
and these nazis killed him
where
we aint sure yet
we picked up one of his guys
but the guy didnt stand up too well
under pressure
mike and me chopped a couple of fingers
he went out before we could brace him
i need a town donny
until i get a town im sitting here
on the ground with my finger up my nose
maybe la the guy was yelling
something sounded like la
when he fuzzed out on us

were chasing a shine outside the bank
nobody knows who he is

entertaining is like being on top
of the highest mountain

and if they dont
thats horrible its just horrible
the way i look at it

but im really not a bad guy
you should never do your own
commercials reeks of insincerity
i still dont know who you are
my real name is el turner
you see el stands for early leroy
you see i was born in a taxi
so my mother called me early
lionel thats no excuse
but you try going through life
with a joke name and it distorts you
so what are we gonna do now
i dont know lionel
i guess its up to you
but what are we gonna do
we cant just do nothing
we arent gonna do nothing
all my life whenever ive come
to a stop sign ive stopped
this once im gonna keep going
if this nazi war criminal
is planning to come into the country
then one way or another
im going to stop him
the white zone is for loading
and unloading of passengers only

brown shoes
dow jones square tie person
you are insulting me
youre a marksman
bangbang shoot them up
i got you covered
not people targets
can we use the karate
mr okahamu says karate
should never be used in anger
mr okahamu is grossly misinformed
strategy meeting
they are killers
we must call the cops
cant
why not
theres always a plausibility factor
but this has no plausibility
what are you talking about
a hypothetical situation
a what
you go to this cop
and say to this flatfoot
excuse me but hitlers doctor
is coming to town
and a neonazi party is here
at now to meet him
now sam diagustas nephew
and about 50 of his thugs are here
and theyre gonna fight it out
over some diamonds that the nazi party
is fencing through the underworld
what do you get
the truth
no youve got
a low plausibility factor
two options for him
he can risk being laughed off
the force
or he can wrap you up in newspaper
ship you off to the lollipop factory
where you can watch television
play cards with a bunch of nuts
its the money isnt it
if i tell the cops you lose the money
you are a 3 piece suit
do you know that
and youre gonna end in some morgue
with a tag on your toe
cause you havent got a clue
about what youre doing
when i try i can be very plausible
brown shoe

morris ashton track security
whats going on can i help you folks
i think we should move to separation
two trials instead of one
no if i get tried along with el
the judge will have to be more
lenient with the sentence right
thats suicide would you tell him
hes right
you said
that since we gave back the money
and since we did end up catching
a german war criminal
and 10 mobsters and neonazis
that the judge might go easy
ill see what i can do
you got a job turner
half a dozen but none of which
im licensed or commissioned to do
but hes very good at them
show them tenspeed
the move to separate
is neorhem pertinae
i realise you have
a difficult precedent here
if you cite massachusetts v morris
wilcox you maybe convince the judge
i know that case
yes
jail house lawyer
no sir two years at yale law
i was expelled
for rigging a student election
and skipping to tijuana with the funds
you should have been with me
is he on the level
almost never
guard you wanted me to bring you this
yes thank you
is that all you want
yes
id have an easier time
if you had a legitimate job
the judge might find it
difficult to or you
if he thinks youre just gonna hit the
bricks and start up your con games
tell the judge hes gonna be an employee
of the lionel whitney agency
ok ill see what i can do
what kind of agency
is the lionel whitney agency
ive given this a lot of thought
yeah
im gonna take out a licence
become private detective
