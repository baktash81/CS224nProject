united federation of planets 
i m appearing before you 
as a neutral representative
of the fabonan republic 
to bring you a message of good will
and present to you 
esteemed members of the teenaxi delegation
a gift from the fabonan high council 
with the highest regard 
what s wrong with it 
excuse me 
why don t they want it anymore 
well   
this was once a piece of
an ancient weapon 
and now they offer it
as a symbol of   
of peace 
in the fabonan culture 
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce 
how did they come by it 
they told me  they acquired it
a long time ago 
so they stole it  then 
no they  um   
well   
you don t know the fabonans 
like we do 
that s very true 
your excellency  this gift
they re a crowd of
untrustworthy thieves
who want to see us
murdered in our own beds 
this beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace 
they want to cut us into pieces 
and roast us over a fire 
i don t think that s true 
and eat us 
what  
scotty  get me out of here 
that was quick 
there s quite a bit
o  surface interference  sir 
scotty 
i ripped my shirt again 
how d it go 
captain  did you manage to broker
a treaty with the teenaxi 
let s just say i came up short 
would you look    log that and
put it in the vault  spock 
thank you 
  jim  you look like crap 
  thank you  bones 
you got that little vein
popping out of your temple again 
you ok 
never better 
just a another day in the fleet 
captain s log  stardate 2263 2
today is our 966th day
in deep space 
a little over 3 years into
our 5 year mission 
the more time we spend out here 
the harder it is to tell where
one day ends
and the next one begins 
it can be a challenge
to feel grounded 
when even gravity is artifical 
but  well  we do what we can
to make it feel like home 
the crew  as always
continues to act admirably
despite the rigors of our extended
stay  here in outer space 
and the personal sacrifices they have made 
we continue to search
for new life forms in order to
establish firm diplomatic ties 
our extended time
in uncharted territory
has stretched the ships mechanical
capacities 
but  fortunately  our engineering
departement led by mr  scott 
is more than up to the job 
the ship  aside 
prolonged cohabitation has
definitely had effects on
interpersonal dynamics 
some experiences for the better
and some for the worse 
as for me  things
have started to feel
a little episodic 
the farther out we go 
the more i find myself wondering
what  it is  we re trying to accomplish 
if the universe is truly endless  then   
are we not striving
for something forever out of reach 
the enterprise is scheduled for
a reprovisioning stop at yorktown 
federation s newest and
most advanced starbase 
perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite
from mysteries and the unknown 
sorry  i m late 
keenser s leaking some kinda
highly acidic green goo
and scotty s terrified
he s gonna sneeze on the warp core
and kill us all 
what the hell are you drinking 
i m pretty sure it s the rest of that
saurian brandy we picked up on thasus 
my god man  are you trying to go blind 
that stuff s illegal 
besides   
i found this in chekov s locker 
right  i mean i always
assumed he d be
  a vodka guy 
  vodka guy  exactly 
i wanted to have something
appropriate for your birthday 
it s in couple days 
  you know i don t care about that 
  i know 
i know you don t like
celebrating it to on the day
 cause it s also the day
your pa bit the dust 
i was being sensitive 
did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school 
or is it just your southern charm 
  oh yeah 
  oh  that s good 
lordy 
are you gonna call your mom 
yeah  of course i ll call her 
on the day 
one year older 
yeah  that s usually how it works 
a year older than he ever got to be 
he joined the starfleet because he
he believed in it 
i joined on a dare 
you joined and see if you could
live up to him 
you ve spent all this time 
trying to be george kirk
and now you re wondering just
what it means to be jim 
why you re out here 
to perfect eyesight and
a full head of hair 
  kirk here 
  captain 
  approaching yorktown base 
  i m on my way  mr  sulu 
let s keep this birthday thing
under wraps  huh 
you know me  mr  sensitive 
wow  that is impressive 
aye  she s a beauty  isn t she 
what a damn monstrosity 
couldn t we just rent some space
on a planet 
showing geographical favouritism
among inducted federation worlds
could cause diplomatic tension 
oh  you don t think that looks tense 
looks like a damn snow globe in space
just waiting to break 
ah  that s the spirit  bones 
spock 
do you have a moment 
of course  nyota 
i think you should have this back 
after all  it belonged to your mother 
it is not in the vulcan custom
to receive again  that
which was given as a gift 
you guys break up 
what d you do 
a typically reductive inquiry doctor 
you know spock 
if an earth girl says 
it s me  not you 
it s definitely you 
excuse me 
commander spock 
may we have a moment of your time 
thank you for bringing this
to my attention 
live long and prosper 
live long and prosper 
i have def alert on incoming vessel 
unidentified non federation 
attention  unidentified vessel 
you are not authorized for approach 
power down and await instructions 
unidentified vessel  please comply 
just speak normally 
language analysis complete
is this working 
we were on a science mission
inside the nebula 
our ship suffered a critical malfunction 
i took an escape pod 
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet 
we need a ship 
capable of navigating the nebula 
you must have someone 
who can help us 
we tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula 
here at 210 mark 14 
long range scan 
no data  the nebula is too dense 
it s uncharted space 
well  the enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet 
she could handle  er 
the only ship here 
with more advanced technology
is still under construction 
but it s not just the ship
that i m sending 
i ll gather the crew 
captain 
starfleet command sent me your application
for the vice admiral position
here at this installation 
yes  ma am 
if i may  i would recommend
commander spock
to replace me as
captain of the enteprise 
he is an exemplary starfleet officer 
he d make a great captain 
it isn t uncommon  you know 
even for a captain 
to want to leave 
there s no relative direction
in the vastness of space 
there s only yourself 
your ship 
your crew 
it s easier than you think
to get lost 
  it s not   
  i ll bring it up with the general council 
we ll discuss it  when you return 
ma am 
  mr  spock 
  captain 
  i have something   
  perhaps there   
  no  please 
  captain  after you 
i insist 
after this mission  we should 
we should sit down 
there s something
i need to talk you about 
i  as well  have something to share 
we make a good team  right 
i believe we do 
i insist 
lt  uhura  open a ship wide channel 
yes  captain 
attention  crew of the enterprise 
our mission is straightforward 
to rescue a crew stranded
on a planet in uncharted space 
our trajectory will take us through
an unstable nebula 
one which will disable
all communication with starfleet 
we re gonna on our own 
the enteprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has 
you 
as we ve come to understand
there is no such thing as the unknown 
only the temporarily hidden 
kirk  out 
readings indicate
cloud density  diminishing  sir 
this is altamid 
my ship is stranded here 
approaching altamid 
class m planet 
massive subterranean development
but limited to no life forms
on the surface 
proximity alert  sir 
we have an unknown ship
heading right for us 
  lt  uhura  hail them 
  yes  captain 
no response 
i am picking up some kind of signal 
they re jamming us 
magnify  mr  sulu 
what is this 
shields up  red alert 
fire at will 
sir  our phasers are having
minimal effect
and our torpedoes can t track
their movements 
fire everything we ve got 
captain  we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement 
shield frequencies have
no effect  sir 
they took out the dish 
shields are inoperable 
  warp us out of here  mr  sulu 
  yes  sir 
  why the hell aren t we moving 
  i can t engage the warp drive  sir 
scotty  i need warp now 
i cannae  sir  the nacelles  they   
they ve gone 
security  engage all
emergency procedures   
code  1 alpha 4 0 
all personnel to alert stations 
i have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15 
6  9  31 and 21  sir 
captain  there s a chance i can reroute
the energy reserves from the warp core
to the impulse engines 
if we can get back into the nebula 
maybe we can lose them 
do whatever you have to  scotty 
keenser 
let s go 
all clear  krall 
connect the plasma conduits
and stand by to re rout on my mark 
i have the abronath 
secure the ship 
  captain 
  go  spock 
i ve identified the individual who appears
to be leading the attack party 
he infiltrated the archive vault
and removed the artifact
from our mission on teenax 
hold your distance until   
spock 
spock 
you two  with me 
  sulu  you have the conn 
  yes  sir 
my god 
what the hell  
doctor 
doctor  we must evacuate now 
captain
kirk 
yes  we re at 100  impulse 
great work  mr  scott 
maximum impulse towards the nebula 
aye 
krall  the ship is going
into the nebula 
slit its throat 
kirk to bridge 
we are losing the inertial dampeners 
systems are failing  ship wide  captain 
emergency bulkheads are sealing
but structural integrity
is at 18  and falling  sir 
abandon ship  mr  sulu 
sound the alarm 
we need to give those pods
a chance to escape 
can you lead the ship away 
impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve 
we cannot move until
the saucer is separated 
i ll handle it 
aye aye  sir 
we gotta get you guys to
an escape pod  go 
ensign  syl 
i need your help 
yes  sir 
my god 
spock  they re taking the crew 
  are you ok 
  the saucer should be free by now 
i know  mr  sulu 
the captain should be there 
impulse engines  drawing power
from auxiliary generators 
captain 
how many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer 
none 
if i m reading this correctly
the intruders are taking them 
captain  we are caught
in the planet s  grawity  
we cannot pull away 
get your kelvin pods 
  yes  sir 
  aye  captain 
come on  let s go 
you knew 
you knew we d be attacked 
you don t understand 
captain kirk 
yes  i lied 
our ship was attacked 
chekov  check the comms for survivors 
aye  aye  aye  captain 
  who is he 
  his name is krall 
he took my crew 
like he took yours 
how did he know so much
about the enterprise 
all i know is that if i did this 
he would set them free 
chekov  are you picking
anything up  on those scanners 
nothing  sir 
  what if they   
  no  no 
he was taking them 
we have to find that saucer 
even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder 
aye  captain  it s possible 
captain  i was protecting my crew 
what is your name 
how do you know our language 
i know your kind 
i m lt  nyota uhura
of the uss enteprise 
and you have committed
an act of war against feder   
federation  
federation is an act of war 
you attacked us 
your captain   
why did you sacrifice yourself
for him 
he would have done the same 
and if he made it off that ship 
he will come for us 
i m counting on it  lt  uhura 
i can t believe it 
my god  spock 
sit down over here 
ok  easy  easy 
i ll just  eh   
try and relax 
you re gonna be ok 
the forced optimism in
your voice suggests
you are trying to elicit
a sense of calm in order to   
  cut the horse shit 
  doctor 
i failed to see how
excrement of any kind
bears relevance on our current situation 
  what the hell are you doing 
  we must keep moving  doctor 
spock  this thing s punctured
your iliac region 
time is a critical factor 
that s exactly
what i m trying to tell you 
look  if i can t take this out 
you re gonna die 
ok  if i take it out and can t stop
the bleeding  you re gonna die 
i can see no appeal in either option 
believe it or not  neither can i 
so  if i remember correctly 
the    vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers 
that is correct  doctor 
that explains a thing or two 
you know  you are lucky 
an inch to the left
and you d be dead already 
i just don t get it  spock 
i mean  what   
what did they attack us for 
i mean   
they do all this for some doodad
that the tiny critters didn t want 
it is unwise to trivialize that which
one simply does not understand  doctor 
we can safely assume it is
more important than a doodad 
i think you just managed
to insult me twice  spock 
ok 
alright  spock 
i just got one question 
  what s your favorite color 
  i failed to see the relevance   
yeah  they say it hurts less
if it s a surprise 
if i may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar
i can confirm your theory
to be horse shit 
we gotta get outta here 
you re kidding me  aren t you 
hello there 
my name is montgomery scott  and   
who might you be 
watch it sonny  i m pretty handy
when i want to be  right 
don t come back 
well  we certainly showed them 
eh lassie 
hey  that s starfleet property 
you cannae just take   
but  i m feeling generous today 
so have at it 
  where you get that 
  is that english 
i learn from my house 
where you get that 
  this is my starfleet insignia 
  what does it mean 
means that i m an officer of
starfleet s engineering division 
  engineering 
  aye  that s right  i fix things 
i know what is engineering 
you re not with those bastards
that killed my ship are ya 
i ll take that as a no 
he is krall  him and his   
bees 
they search the stars for a   
death machine 
they re the reason why you are here 
why we are all here 
what  even those 3 scunners 
they have fallen from the sky 
like me and you 
come with me  now 
wait  hang on a minute  lassie 
i m having a difficult day  here 
i ve gotta find my crewmates 
i will help you find your mates 
and then you will help me 
with what 
  you want me to fix something 
  yes 
you help me and i help you 
alright  well 
things being as they are 
i doubt i ll get better offer today 
so lead the way 
good 
i am jaylah 
  and you re montgomery scott 
  aye  scotty 
come now  montgomery scotty 
alright  hold on 
the enterprise 
she may not even have power
to the bridge  captain 
she still has a few tricks
up her sleeve 
i d bet on it 
mccoy to enterprise  come in 
mccoy to enterprise 
hey  take it easy there  spock 
that was just a temporary fix back there 
i understand  doctor 
fascinating 
ominous  dark  dangerous 
we re going in 
intriguing 
these symbols are the same as those depicted
on the artifact taken in the attack 
you think it came from here 
it would seem so 
damm it  spock 
hurry 
  are we there yet 
  stop asking that 
  sorry 
  this is the way  come 
and watch your step 
you do not want to set off my traps 
oh  that s clever 
what is this place 
  this is my house 
  your house 
hold on a minute 
is this a ship 
i ll help you find your friends
and you help me fix it 
so i can leave this planet  forever 
w wait a minute 
is this your ship 
no  montgomery scotty 
it s yours 
oh my good lord 
captain  it looks like there is power 
alright  let s get to the bridge
then we ll find the crew 
the console is intact captain 
i will   
try to re route power to it 
work fast 
once we get this place lit up 
we re gonna draw a lot of attention 
what do you think  can you find them 
aye  captain 
i am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crew s sequence 
you  with me   
i left something behind 
that is one heck of a cold 
nice job  keenser 
alright  we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation 
come on 
let s go  c mon 
come on 
this is the magellan probe 
federation was using these to
find a way through the nebula 
what s he using it for 
what do you see 
he s been piggybacking the subspace
links between the probes 
can we use it to send a
distress signal 
i can try 
it s sent 
he has access to yorktown database 
what 
he s got startfleet datafiles 
ship logs   
including the enterprise 
he s been watching us this whole time 
captain 
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time 
i couldn t afford to get
caught with it 
so i hid it in here 
tell krall  i have the abronath 
do you believe every
sad story you hear 
not every 
put the phaser down  please 
did you get it  chekov 
aye  captain  i ve traced
the location of her comm 
what does krall want with this thing 
to save you 
from yourselves 
captain 
  you all right 
  aye  captain  but we are trapped 
can you get this thing started 
are you intimating that we should
engage the thrusters  
i am open to other suggestions 
ok 
  there s a problem  sir 
  what 
fuel is primed  but 
i cannot get it to combust 
captain  we are basically standing
on a  wery  large bomb 
if you miss the combustion compressor   
i am not gonna miss  come on 
do you even know what the
combustion compressor looks like 
ah  it s square  right 
no  sir  it s round 
that s what i said 
go 
chekov 
chekov  move 
you think you know
what sacrifice really means 
federation has taught you
that conflict should not exist 
but without struggle 
you would never know
who you truly are 
you have no idea who we are 
but you ll soon find out 
you mean the distress signal
you thought you sent 
the coordinates were altered 
your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula
and your base left  full open 
you re going to attack yorktown 
millions of souls from every
federation world
holding hands 
it s a perfect target 
you re wrong 
there is strength in unity 
the strength of others  lieutenant 
is what has kept me alive 
no 
spock 
spock  wake up dammit 
i am entirely conscious  doctor 
i am simply contemplating
the nature of mortality 
feeling philosophical  huh 
massive blood loss ll do that to ya 
you asked me why lt  uhura
and i parted ways 
i became concerned 
in the light of vulcan s demise 
that i owed a debt of duty
to my species 
you thought you should be off
making little vulcans  huh 
yup  i can see how that d upset her 
i intended to discuss it
with her further
but i received some news
which affected me unexpectedly 
what news 
ambassador spock has died 
spock  i m so sorry 
i can t imagine what that must feel like 
when you ve lived as many lives as he
fear of death is illogical 
fear of death
is what keeps us alive 
i want to live as he did 
that is why i decided
to redirect my efforts and
continue his work
on new vulcan 
you re leaving starfleet 
what jim have to say about that 
i could not find the time
to tell him 
well  i can tell you
he is not gonna like that 
hell  i don t know what
he d do without ya 
i mean  you know  me on the
other hand  i d throw a party 
my god  you re getting delirious 
how far are we from
the coordinates of that call 
still a ways  sir 
captain 
when did you begin to suspect her 
not soon enough 
how did you know 
i guess you could say
i got a good nose for danger 
run 
is that music 
where on earth is that coming from 
there 
i plugged the little box in the power cell
and the little mouth make it sing 
that s very clever 
music is a bit old fashion
for my taste 
not to mention very loud
and distracting 
but hey  well played 
i like the beat and shouting 
oh  you do 
switch it off 
  ach  you re ok 
  switch it off 
someone set off one of my traps 
captain 
  you know these men 
  aye  lassie 
that wee man there is pavel chekov
and that handsome bastard
is james t  kirk 
they re my mates 
it s good to see you sir 
what is she doing  scotty 
don t hurt them because   
you re free  james t 
mr  scott 
who s your new friend here 
she sure knows how
to throw out the welcome mat 
this is jaylah 
i do not know what is a welcome mat 
  you find anybody else 
  no  sir 
i m sorry  you re the only ones 
what the hell happened up there  jim 
why were we attacked 
they were after the artifact
we brought back from teenax 
  did they get it 
  no 
  have you got it 
  no 
i had to get it off the enterprise
so i put it on a shuttle 
  you hid it in a shuttle 
  yes   
    and no 
this is the uss franklin  sir 
can you believe it 
first earth ship capable of warp 4 
went missing in the gagarin radiation belt
in the early 2160 s 
i remember that from the academy 
captain balthazar edison 
in the first years of starfleet 
how the hell did his ship end up here 
there s a lot o  theories  sir 
surrended to the romulans 
captured by a giant green space hand 
this far out  it s gotta be
a wormhole displacement 
can she fly 
she s missing a few driver coils
and the eps conduits are fried
but jaylah has done a marvelous job
of getting the ship s systems back online 
  thank you  montgomery scotty 
  pardon me 
mr  chekov  could you plug in
the coordinates 
see if you can track the crew s location
from the ship s sensors 
aye  captain 
he likes that seat 
mr  scott  tour 
yes  the mess hall 
jaylah  if you will   
yes 
no clue what happend to the crew  huh 
ach  no  sir  they d be dead
a hundred years by now 
is that    
that s a px 70 
my dad used to have one
when he was a kid 
mom said he d put her on the back
and then drive her nuts 
sir 
so you re telling me this thing s
been here this whole time and
no one s ever noticed it 
she s riggeded up image refractors 
like some sort of
holographic camouflage 
aye  sir 
captain 
i ve intercepted a weak
communication transmission  sir 
it s a starfleet frequency 
can you lock onto the signal 
yes  but how do we get to them 
i have an idea  sir 
but i m gonna need your permission 
why would you need my permission 
because if i mess it up
i don t want it to be just my fault 
mccoy and spock to enteprise crew 
come in  enterprise crew 
anyone 
come on  spock 
come on  you can make it 
leaving me behind will significantly
increase your chances of survival  doctor 
well  that s damned chivalrous of you
but completly out of the question 
it is imperative that you locate
any surviving crew 
and here i was  thinking you cared 
of course i care about you 
i always assumed my respect
for you is clear 
the dialogue we have had
across the years has always   
it s ok  spock 
you don t have to say it 
well  at least i won t die alone 
well  that s just typical 
come on you bastards 
good to see you in one piece doctor 
oh  am i 
i feel like my innards
have been to a barn dace 
aye  well  these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo 
but a few modifications seemed
to do the trick 
i thought it was best
to beam you one at a time 
you know  in case you got spliced 
oh  i couldn t imagine a worse scenario 
good to have you back 
you all right 
yeah  i m fine  he s hurt 
i am functioning adequately  captain 
in a pig s eye  you are 
captain 
we discovered that the stolen artifact
appears to have come from this planet 
dammit  spock 
are there any medical supplies
on this thing 
this way 
lie down  come on 
there you go 
how are we gonna get out of
this one  spock  we got   
no ship  no crew 
  not the best odds 
  we will do what we have always done  jim 
we will find hope in the impossible 
let s get you patched up first  ok 
captain 
you must focus your efforts
on helping the crew 
well  that s why i need you
around spock 
these things are from the dark ages 
bones 
i m pretty sure this is protoplaser 
it ll stop the internal hemorraging 
at least that s my hope 
 the miserable have
no other medicine but only hope  
at death s door and he s
quoting shakespeare 
captain s log  stardate 2263 2
we searched the wreckage 
he must have hidden it elsewhere 
all we have is his crew  krall 
you will tell me where it is 
now 
no 
stop 
let him go and i will give you
what you want 
no  syl  don t 
lieutenant 
unity is not your strength 
it is your weakness 
we should wait until
we re absolutely sure 
no  we have to get the crew back  now 
chekov has the coordinates that
can lead us to krall s base  so we go 
with respect  sir  how do we know
that krall was at the base when she called 
and even if he was  we don t know
that the crew was with them 
or if they re even still alive 
mr  chekov  can you reconfigure
the search parameters
in order to compensate for this formula 
aye  commander but  what is this forumla 
it is vokaya  mr  chekov 
a mineral unique to vulcan
which emits a low level radiation 
i ll have to filter out
all other energy emissions 
spock  what the hell would a vulcan
mineral be doing way out here 
where are you going with this 
lt  uhura wears a vokaya amulet
which i presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect 
you gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelery 
the emissions is harmless  doctor 
but its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify 
you gave your girlfriend
a tracking device 
that was not my intention 
i m glad he doesn t respect me 
i am detecting a  wery  trace
amount of  wokaya  
does the location match the coordinates
you acquired from kalar  mr  chekov 
it is a match  sir 
it s presence suggest that lt  uhura
and thereby the rest of the crew
are being held at
krall s base of operation 
can you beam them out 
no  sir  there is some
geological interference
that is blocking the transporter s signal 
well i guess we re gonna have to go in
and break them out the old fashioned way 
you cannot go to this place 
everyone who goes there  he kills 
you ve been there  you ve seen it 
why didn t you say something 
lassie 
because i knew you will ask me
to take you there 
if your friends are there 
then they will die 
just like my family 
and i will not go back
to that death place 
aye  but if you ve escaped 
then you can show us the way in
  and the way out 
  no 
this is not the deal we made 
montgomery scotty 
if you choose to do this 
you re on your own 
  wait  wait 
  let her go 
she s lost people too  captain 
look  that s our friends
out there lassie  right 
we cannae just leave  em behind 
now  we could really use your help 
we just need you to be brave  is all 
when we were in that place 
krall would come and take someone 
there were screams  i can still hear them 
and we would not see that person again 
we did not know who would be next 
my father planned an escape 
but we were seen by the   
by the one they call manas 
my father fought him so i could get out 
he was brave
and manas killed him 
what you want is impossible 
look  maybe it s not 
right  my wee granny used to say 
 ye cannae break a stick in a bundle  
you re a part of something
bigger now  lassie 
alright  dinnae give up on that 
 cause we ll  sure as hell 
never give up on you 
that is what being part of crew
is all about 
is that what you believe in  james t  
all i know is  we stand
a better chance with you 
the digging machines uncover the tunnel
that goes into the crater 
that s how i got out 
so that ll be our way in 
the away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel 
follow it to krall s base 
get inside the building 
break out the crew 
ah  captain  we can not lock onto
anyone inside the crater
in order to beam them out 
or  i could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers 
  that ll get the signal into the crater 
  alright 
how many people can the franklin
transport at a time 
ah  with a wee bit o  modification 
20 max  but i m not sure
how long it would hold out 
bones  mr  chekov  jaylah 
you re with me in the away team 
mr scott  modify that transporter
then do everything you can
to get this ship operational 
captain  mr  chekov s technical acumen
makes him more valuable
aboard the franklin with mr  scott 
is thereby logical that
i would replace him 
why is that logical spock 
you just got back on your feet 
lt  uhura is in that facility  jim 
i ll keep an eye on him 
understood 
his soldiers are everywhere 
we won t pass unseen 
what we require is a diversion 
i think i have an idea 
this is abronath 
it was used by the ancient ones
as a weapon 
but  when they could not control
its deadly power
they split it into two
and ejected the halves into space 
hoping it would be lost forever 
but i am grateful 
i have spent lifetimes searching for it 
only to have you find it for me 
the poetry of fate 
the world that i was born into
is very different from yours  lieutenant 
we knew pain  we knew terror 
struggle made us strong 
not peace  not unity 
these are myths the federation
would have you believe 
those are strong words 
you might even believe them 
but there s something else
going on with you 
something underneath 
wait 
what are you doing with her 
you already got what you wanted 
let her go 
no 
manas 
it s time 
the federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries 
but no longer 
this is where it begins  lieutenant 
this is where the frontier 
pushes back 
this way 
where is he 
i gotta admit 
it s a hell of a distraction 
your friends are over there 
come on 
let me deal with them 
you ve brought us this far 
finish the mission  krall 
go 
commander  uhura they took her 
get the remainder of the crew
to safety 
come on  let s go  move 
  i ve got them  mr  scott 
  ok  mr  chekov  increase the signal 
we re gonna grab them 20 at a time 
  aye 
  let s hope this doesn t get messy 
energize 
spock 
what are you doing here 
clearly  i am here to rescue you 
let s go 
good to see you  wee man 
you ll die here as your father 
ten seconds until transporter s
recharged  doctor 
wait for my signal 
  doctor 
  dammit man 
we re not leaving without  em 
come on  let s go  move  move 
we are ready for an extract 
just turn on your beacon 
  scotty  do you have everybody 
  aye  sir  everyone except you and jeylah 
start the beacon and we ll grab ya 
they will leave you here 
captain  your beacon 
  there it is 
  energize 
jaylah 
ok  let s never do that again 
i agree  james t 
you all right 
captain  this thing he has   
yorktown 
he s gonna destroy yorktown 
you take my house
and you make it fly 
scotty  can you get this thing started 
start it  yes 
flying sir  that s a different thing 
these old vessels 
they were built in space 
they were never supposed
to take off from atmosphere 
make it happen 
they re called starships 
for a reason  captain 
you tell me this now 
because i didn t wanna disappoint ya 
you know  in case ya didn t make it back 
how thoughtful  mr  scott 
captain 
he s launching 
the attack on yorktown
may be just the beginning 
armed with this bioweapon 
he could rid it of all life
and use the base s advanced technology
to attack an untold number
of federation planets 
we re just gonna have
to get this thing flying 
ach  we cannae just jump start it  sir 
ok  all systems online 
dilithium chambers
at 70  and climbing 
primary subwarp engines standing by 
mr  sulu 
you can   
you know   
fly this thing  right 
you kidding me  sir 
fantastic 
scotty  how are we looking 
ready as she will never be  sir 
that s what i like to hear 
alright 
bones  where are we with the crew 
i could use a functioning med bay
but otherwise we re secure down here 
mr  sulu 
we have to achieve terminal  welocity 
in order for the stabilizers
to  prowide  lift 
are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that 
we ll find out 
call it  mr  sulu 
aye aye  captain 
mr  chekov  be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers
full  on my mark  one quarter impulse 
right 
  one half impulse  mr  chekov 
  aye 
we should belt up  go on  go  go  go 
easy  mr  sulu 
let s not break her  now 
anytime  mr  sulu 
now  mr  chekov 
i have def alert on incoming vessel 
no reply to all frequency id requests 
visual 
red alert  red alert 
look how far they ve come 
i m picking up distress signals from
every frequency coming from yorktown 
krall s already starting his attack 
mr  scott  what kind of
weapons do we have 
we have pulse phase cannons
and spatial torpedoes 
great  lock and load 
it does not matter 
you cannot defeat the bees 
maybe we lure them away 
how do we get yorktown
time to get people to safety 
we are coarse and buggy 
compared to those things 
we re barely holding together 
  as it is  captain 
  captain 
the flight patterns of bees are
determined by individual decisions 
krall s swarm formations
are too complex
not to rely on some form of
unified cyberpathic coordination 
  i surmise that if we   
  spock 
skip to the end 
what he s saying is 
that if we disorient the swarm 
we can kick its ass 
precisely 
scotty  can you beam me onto
one of those swarm ships 
have you gone completly mad 
  yes or no 
  no 
yes   
maybe 
captain  my familiarity of the interior
of those ships  however brief 
makes me more qualified
for this away mission 
spock  you re still hurt 
she s right  spock 
i acknowledge and respect your concerns 
perhaps you would feel more confident
if i were accompanied by someone
with a familiarity of both
the ship and my injury 
he s gonna love this 
you want me to do what 
come along  doctor 
woah  wait a minute 
why  you green blooded ingrate 
this was your idea 
it s a good idea  bones 
you know  next time you have a
piece of pipe stuck in your transverse 
call a plumber 
just make sure you find a way
to break those things 
if it gets hairy
i ll beam ya straight back 
energize 
you re gonna do great 
dammit  jim  i m a doctor  not a   
you do realize  the last time
i fooled with one of these things
we crashed 
so don t blame me if we   
   hit something 
spock  to franklin 
spock  we read you 
captain  from what i can
ascertain  the ships do indeed 
share a cyberpathic link
which coordinates their actions 
patching it through  now 
that s what their signal was 
they weren t jamming us 
they were talking to each other 
how do we get them to stop talking 
what about electromagnetic focusing 
we can use the transporters
to disturb their network 
focus might be too specific 
if we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm 
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate 
it would have to be at a frequency
they would not anticipate 
we could cause a chain reaction
that will wipe out the whole swarm 
sir  a closed network like that
might be susceptible
to very high frequency 
vhf 
radio  we can broadcast
something from the ship
to drown out their links 
something loud and distracting 
loud and distracting 
i ve got just the thing 
do not break my music 
break it   it ll get an upgrade 
swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through 
i just got to reconfigure the vhf output
into a multiphasic sweep 
  let me do it 
  lassie   
  let her do it 
  i ve been doing this for forty   
alright  you do it 
there  see 
  simple 
  alright 
captain  we re ready to broadcast 
but the signal won t travel far 
we have to get closer 
  how close 
  very 
intercept course  mr  sulu 
  put us right in the middle of that thing 
  yes  sir 
my old friend 
the swarm ships are doubling back 
they re forming an attack wave  sir 
i think we got their attention 
hold steady  mr  sulu 
brace yourselves  everybody 
spock  stand by
to drop out of formation 
  scotty  you all cued up back there 
  aye  sir 
ready to broadcast at 57 7 mhz 
  made your choice  lassie 
  i have the beat and shouting 
let s make some noise 
that s a good choice 
faster  doctor  we risk being consumed
by their trajectorial decay 
damn back seat driver 
  get ready  doctor 
  i see it  i see it 
is that classical music 
yes  doctor  it would seem to be 
lt  uhura  make sure yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast 
sir  we now have the distrupion frequency 
broadcast 
you all right  spock 
we are fine  captain 
but there are still three ships
heading into yorktown 
that s got to be krall 
keep on him  spock 
do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon 
my house is breaking 
we ve lost the polarization
of the hull plating 
i can redirect the power
from the dilithium chamber 
i need help 
i need you  jaylah  let s go 
do not lose them  doctor 
you re more than welcome
to switch places with me  spock 
captain  intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility 
gimme a schematic of yorktown 
there  yorktown headquarters 
mr  chekov  can you do a bioscan
of central plaza 
aye 
they re clearing  ciwilians  
bones  there s a city plaza coming up 
you gotta make sure krall heads for it 
  why 
  just do it 
sulu  get us up there 
hold onto something 
  great work  bones 
  thanks  jim 
now i just gotta figure out
how to land 
captain  i have 3 hull breaches
from the impact 
deck 3  the cargo bay and
the engine room 
alright  sulu  chekov 
check the cargo bay and deck 3 
we need confirmation that the weapon
has been neutralized and krall is dead 
captain 
it s krall 
we ve seen him do this 
it s a some kind of energy transference 
it physically changes him 
he must still be on board 
we would ve seen him leave 
sulu  contact yorktown security
and lock down the ship 
let s go 
it s about  damn  time 
captain 
  it s about  damn  time 
  push the frontier   
  it s about  damn  time 
  push the frontier   
  it s about  damn  time 
  push the frontier   
it s him 
scotty  i need you to link into
the franklin database 
find out what you can about
balthazar edison 
  what  the captain of the franklin 
  yeah 
  sir  he d be long dead 
  no he s not 
i don t know how  but edison is krall 
what d you find 
well  his record goes back
way before the federation even existed 
he was a major in the united earth
military assault command operation 
a lot of off world combat 
  he was a soldier 
  aye  sir  and pretty good one 
his military service came to an end
when maco was disbanded 
why  what happened 
the federation  sir  starfleet 
we re not a military agency 
they made him a captain
and gave him the franklin 
  scotty  bring up his logs 
  aye  sir 
captain s log   
last entry 
captain s log   
i don t remember the stardate 
all distress calls  unanswered 
of the crew   
only 3 remain 
i won t allow it 
the indigenous race abandoned
this planet long ago 
they left behind sophisticated
mining equipment
and a drone workforce 
they had some sort of technology
that prolongs   
life 
i ll do whatever it takes
for me and my crew 
the federation do not care about us 
you ll probably never see me again
but if you do
be ready 
why has he not used his weapon yet 
because he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage 
he needs a distribution system 
they have to circulate air here  right 
aye  sir  there s an atmospheric
regulator in the core 
lieutenant  contact yorktown
make sure they shut it down
until we find krall 
how would he access the core 
well  there s a maintenance tower
at the station s gravitational nexus 
that s the only way 
scotty  you get over there 
make sure it gets shut down 
lassie  you re with me 
look  this thing is impossible
to shut down 
aye  well   
   we ll see about that 
mr  scott  why is that thing still on 
we re working on it  sir 
but as you can imagine 
there s a lot of safety protocols
surrounding the thing that  you know 
keeps everybody alive 
figure something out 
be careful captain 
gravity is gonna get a bit screwy
the closer you get to the center 
right  we should scan
the operational schematics 
  see if there s a backdoor 
  right 
lassie  i m gonna need your eyes 
stop 
what happened to you  out there 
edison 
edison 
i have to say  kirk 
i ve missed being me 
we lost ourselves 
but gained a purpose 
a means to bring the galaxy
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong 
i think you underestimate humanity 
i fought for humanity 
lost millions to the xindi
and romulan wars 
and for what 
for the federation to sit
in the captain s chair 
and break bread with the enemy 
we change  we have to 
or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles 
you lost 
there s no way you can make it back there 
give up 
what  like you did 
i read your ship s log 
captain james t  kirk 
at least  i know who i am 
i m a soldier 
you won the war  edison 
you gave us peace 
peace   
is not what i was born into 
  scotty 
  captain 
he s using the gravitational slipstream
to carry him back to the center 
no 
  what s that 
  weapon s in the chamber 
captain we have to stop
the processor now 
or everything breathing
in yorktown is dead 
you can t stop it 
you will die 
better to die saving lives
than to live with taking them 
that s what i was born into 
  scotty 
  captain  i think we can redirect it 
there s a sealed construction hatch
that ll let you vent the weapon
into space 
now we can override the locks
from up here 
but you have to activate the hatch 
  i just have to hit a button 
  it s not a button  sir 
it s a silver lever under a white panel 
  got it 
  and there s 4 of them 
once you ve turned the hatch 
you have to exit the chamber immediately 
if the hatch is open
when the processor cycles 
and you re in it 
you re gonna get sucked into space 
what happens if the hatch isn t open 
you re gonna get sucked
into a big fan 
with the weapon 
and we all die 
dammit  jim 
you won t make it out in time 
the vent 
get out of there  james t 
scotty  the last hatch won t open 
  scotty 
  work fast  captain  time s running out 
he s not gonna make it 
what would i do without you  spock 
for decades  the federation
thought that he was a hero 
i guess time will judge us all 
he just got lost 
you saved this entire base  kirk 
millions of souls  thank you 
it wasn t just me  never is 
needless to say the
position of vice admiral  it s yours 
no one deserves it more 
vice admirals don t fly  do they 
no 
they don t 
no offense  ma am but   
where s the fun in that 
you didn t even try to get
our time out here reduced 
why would i get it reduced 
bones  we know our way
through the nebula now 
can you imagine  what we ll find 
alien despots 
hell bent on killing us 
deadly space borne 
viruses and bacteria 
incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant 
it s gonna be so much fun 
by the way  where re we going 
i thought we re here get a drink 
i know you told me
to keep it under wraps  but   
happy birthday 
mr  sensitive 
  here you go 
  thanks  scotty 
everybody raise a glass
to captain james t  kirk 
  captain kirk 
  thanks  everybody 
  to the enterprise   
  to the enterprise 
   and to absent friends 
  here s to that 
  cheers 
alright  let s get this party started 
i thought you ve got to
finish your mission report 
i do 
but i thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socialy 
you old romantic 
do you know that scotch was actually
 inwented  by a little lady in russia 
excuse me 
did you drink all those yourself 
i m impressed 
someone said it will take
my edge off 
my edge is still not off 
right  well  maybe this ll help 
captain pulled a few strings 
that is acceptance into starfleet academy 
if you want it 
we have a lotta rules 
don t listen to  em all 
will i have to wear that uniform 
 fraid so 
hey  keenser 
kevin  still not wearing pants 
i see 
i heard about ambassador spock 
is that what you wanted to mention
that time in the turbolift 
more or less 
i trust your meeting with
commodore harris went well 
more or less 
you really wanna head back
out there  huh 
space  the final frontier 
these are voyages
of the starship enterprise 
its continuing mission
to explore strange  new worlds
