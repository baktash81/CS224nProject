united federation of planets
im appearing before you
as a neutral representative
of the fabonan republic
to bring you a message of good will
and present to you
esteemed members of the teenaxi delegation
a gift from the fabonan high council
with the highest regard
whats wrong with it
excuse me
why dont they want it anymore
well
this was once a piece of
an ancient weapon
and now they offer it
as a symbol of
of peace
in the fabonan culture
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce
how did they come by it
they told me they acquired it
a long time ago
so they stole it then
no they um
well
you dont know the fabonans
like we do
thats very true
your excellency this gift
theyre a crowd of
untrustworthy thieves
who want to see us
murdered in our own beds
this beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace
they want to cut us into pieces
and roast us over a fire
i dont think thats true
and eat us
what
scotty get me out of here
that was quick
theres quite a bit
o surface interference sir
scotty
i ripped my shirt again
howd it go
captain did you manage to broker
a treaty with the teenaxi
lets just say i came up short
would you look log that and
put it in the vault spock
thank you
jim you look like crap
thank you bones
you got that little vein
popping out of your temple again
you ok
never better
just a another day in the fleet
captains log stardate 22632
today is our 966th day
in deep space
a little over 3 years into
our 5 year mission
the more time we spend out here
the harder it is to tell where
one day ends
and the next one begins
it can be a challenge
to feel grounded
when even gravity is artifical
but well we do what we can
to make it feel like home
the crew as always
continues to act admirably
despite the rigors of our extended
stay here in outer space
and the personal sacrifices they have made
we continue to search
for new life forms in order to
establish firm diplomatic ties
our extended time
in uncharted territory
has stretched the ships mechanical
capacities
but fortunately our engineering
departement led by mr scott
is more than up to the job
the ship aside
prolonged cohabitation has
definitely had effects on
interpersonal dynamics
some experiences for the better
and some for the worse
as for me things
have started to feel
a little episodic
the farther out we go
the more i find myself wondering
what it is were trying to accomplish
if the universe is truly endless then
are we not striving
for something forever out of reach
the enterprise is scheduled for
a reprovisioning stop at yorktown
federations newest and
most advanced starbase
perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite
from mysteries and the unknown
sorry im late
keensers leaking some kinda
highly acidic green goo
and scottys terrified
hes gonna sneeze on the warp core
and kill us all
what the hell are you drinking
im pretty sure its the rest of that
saurian brandy we picked up on thasus
my god man are you trying to go blind
that stuffs illegal
besides
i found this in chekovs locker
right i mean i always
assumed hed be
a vodka guy
vodka guy exactly
i wanted to have something
appropriate for your birthday
its in couple days
you know i dont care about that
i know
i know you dont like
celebrating it to on the day
cause its also the day
your pa bit the dust
i was being sensitive
did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school
or is it just your southern charm
oh yeah
oh thats good
lordy
are you gonna call your mom
yeah of course ill call her
on the day
one year older
yeah thats usually how it works
a year older than he ever got to be
he joined the starfleet because he
he believed in it
i joined on a dare
you joined and see if you could
live up to him
youve spent all this time
trying to be george kirk
and now youre wondering just
what it means to be jim
why youre out here
to perfect eyesight and
a full head of hair
kirk here
captain
approaching yorktown base
im on my way mr sulu
lets keep this birthday thing
under wraps huh
you know me mr sensitive
wow that is impressive
aye shes a beauty isnt she
what a damn monstrosity
couldnt we just rent some space
on a planet
showing geographical favouritism
among inducted federation worlds
could cause diplomatic tension
oh you dont think that looks tense
looks like a damn snow globe in space
just waiting to break
ah thats the spirit bones
spock
do you have a moment
of course nyota
i think you should have this back
after all it belonged to your mother
it is not in the vulcan custom
to receive again that
which was given as a gift
you guys break up
whatd you do
a typically reductive inquiry doctor
you know spock
if an earth girl says
its me not you
its definitely you
excuse me
commander spock
may we have a moment of your time
thank you for bringing this
to my attention
live long and prosper
live long and prosper
i have defalert on incoming vessel
unidentified nonfederation
attention unidentified vessel
you are not authorized for approach
power down and await instructions
unidentified vessel please comply
just speak normally
language analysis complete
is this working
we were on a science mission
inside the nebula
our ship suffered a critical malfunction
i took an escape pod
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet
we need a ship
capable of navigating the nebula
you must have someone
who can help us
we tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula
here at 210 mark 14
long range scan
no data the nebula is too dense
its uncharted space
well the enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet
she could handle er
the only ship here
with more advanced technology
is still under construction
but its not just the ship
that im sending
ill gather the crew
captain
starfleet command sent me your application
for the viceadmiral position
here at this installation
yes maam
if i may i would recommend
commander spock
to replace me as
captain of the enteprise
he is an exemplary starfleet officer
hed make a great captain
it isnt uncommon you know
even for a captain
to want to leave
theres no relative direction
in the vastness of space
theres only yourself
your ship
your crew
its easier than you think
to get lost
its not
ill bring it up with the general council
well discuss it when you return
maam
mr spock
captain
i have something
perhaps there
no please
captain after you
i insist
after this mission we should
we should sit down
theres something
i need to talk you about
i as well have something to share
we make a good team right
i believe we do
i insist
lt uhura open a shipwide channel
yes captain
attention crew of the enterprise
our mission is straightforward
to rescue a crew stranded
on a planet in uncharted space
our trajectory will take us through
an unstable nebula
one which will disable
all communication with starfleet
were gonna on our own
the enteprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has
you
as weve come to understand
there is no such thing as the unknown
only the temporarily hidden
kirk out
readings indicate
cloud density diminishing sir
this is altamid
my ship is stranded here
approaching altamid
class m planet
massive subterranean development
but limited to no life forms
on the surface
proximity alert sir
we have an unknown ship
heading right for us
lt uhura hail them
yes captain
no response
i am picking up some kind of signal
theyre jamming us
magnify mr sulu
what is this
shields up red alert
fire at will
sir our phasers are having
minimal effect
and our torpedoes cant track
their movements
fire everything weve got
captain we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement
shield frequencies have
no effect sir
they took out the dish
shields are inoperable
warp us out of here mr sulu
yes sir
why the hell arent we moving
i cant engage the warp drive sir
scotty i need warp now
i cannae sir the nacelles they
theyve gone
security engage all
emergency procedures
code 1 alpha 40
all personnel to alert stations
i have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15
6 9 31 and 21 sir
captain theres a chance i can reroute
the energy reserves from the warp core
to the impulse engines
if we can get back into the nebula
maybe we can lose them
do whatever you have to scotty
keenser
lets go
all clear krall
connect the plasma conduits
and stand by to rerout on my mark
i have the abronath
secure the ship
captain
go spock
ive identified the individual who appears
to be leading the attack party
he infiltrated the archive vault
and removed the artifact
from our mission on teenax
hold your distance until
spock
spock
you two with me
sulu you have the conn
yes sir
my god
what the hell
doctor
doctor we must evacuate now
captain
kirk
yes were at 100 impulse
great work mr scott
maximum impulse towards the nebula
aye
krall the ship is going
into the nebula
slit its throat
kirk to bridge
we are losing the inertial dampeners
systems are failing shipwide captain
emergency bulkheads are sealing
but structural integrity
is at 18 and falling sir
abandon ship mr sulu
sound the alarm
we need to give those pods
a chance to escape
can you lead the ship away
impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve
we cannot move until
the saucer is separated
ill handle it
aye aye sir
we gotta get you guys to
an escape pod go
ensign syl
i need your help
yes sir
my god
spock theyre taking the crew
are you ok
the saucer should be free by now
i know mr sulu
the captain should be there
impulse engines drawing power
from auxiliary generators
captain
how many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer
none
if im reading this correctly
the intruders are taking them
captain we are caught
in the planets grawity
we cannot pull away
get your kelvin pods
yes sir
aye captain
come on lets go
you knew
you knew wed be attacked
you dont understand
captain kirk
yes i lied
our ship was attacked
chekov check the comms for survivors
aye aye aye captain
who is he
his name is krall
he took my crew
like he took yours
how did he know so much
about the enterprise
all i know is that if i did this
he would set them free
chekov are you picking
anything up on those scanners
nothing sir
what if they
no no
he was taking them
we have to find that saucer
even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder
aye captain its possible
captain i was protecting my crew
what is your name
how do you know our language
i know your kind
im lt nyota uhura
of the uss enteprise
and you have committed
an act of war against feder
federation
federation is an act of war
you attacked us
your captain
why did you sacrifice yourself
for him
he would have done the same
and if he made it off that ship
he will come for us
im counting on it lt uhura
i cant believe it
my god spock
sit down over here
ok easy easy
ill just eh
try and relax
youre gonna be ok
the forced optimism in
your voice suggests
you are trying to elicit
a sense of calm in order to
cut the horse shit
doctor
i failed to see how
excrement of any kind
bears relevance on our current situation
what the hell are you doing
we must keep moving doctor
spock this things punctured
your iliac region
time is a critical factor
thats exactly
what im trying to tell you
look if i cant take this out
youre gonna die
ok if i take it out and cant stop
the bleeding youre gonna die
i can see no appeal in either option
believe it or not neither can i
so if i remember correctly
the vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers
that is correct doctor
that explains a thing or two
you know you are lucky
an inch to the left
and youd be dead already
i just dont get it spock
i mean what
what did they attack us for
i mean
they do all this for some doodad
that the tiny critters didnt want
it is unwise to trivialize that which
one simply does not understand doctor
we can safely assume it is
more important than a doodad
i think you just managed
to insult me twice spock
ok
alright spock
i just got one question
whats your favorite color
i failed to see the relevance
yeah they say it hurts less
if its a surprise
if i may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar
i can confirm your theory
to be horse shit
we gotta get outta here
youre kidding me arent you
hello there
my name is montgomery scott and
who might you be
watch it sonny im pretty handy
when i want to be right
dont come back
well we certainly showed them
eh lassie
hey thats starfleet property
you cannae just take
but im feeling generous today
so have at it
where you get that
is that english
i learn from my house
where you get that
this is my starfleet insignia
what does it mean
means that im an officer of
starfleets engineering division
engineering
aye thats right i fix things
i know what is engineering
youre not with those bastards
that killed my ship are ya
ill take that as a no
he is krall him and his
bees
they search the stars for a
death machine
theyre the reason why you are here
why we are all here
what even those 3 scunners
they have fallen from the sky
like me and you
come with me now
wait hang on a minute lassie
im having a difficult day here
ive gotta find my crewmates
i will help you find your mates
and then you will help me
with what
you want me to fix something
yes
you help me and i help you
alright well
things being as they are
i doubt ill get better offer today
so lead the way
good
i am jaylah
and youre montgomery scott
aye scotty
come now montgomery scotty
alright hold on
the enterprise
she may not even have power
to the bridge captain
she still has a few tricks
up her sleeve
id bet on it
mccoy to enterprise come in
mccoy to enterprise
hey take it easy there spock
that was just a temporary fix back there
i understand doctor
fascinating
ominous dark dangerous
were going in
intriguing
these symbols are the same as those depicted
on the artifact taken in the attack
you think it came from here
it would seem so
damm it spock
hurry
are we there yet
stop asking that
sorry
this is the way come
and watch your step
you do not want to set off my traps
oh thats clever
what is this place
this is my house
your house
hold on a minute
is this a ship
ill help you find your friends
and you help me fix it
so i can leave this planet forever
wwait a minute
is this your ship
no montgomery scotty
its yours
oh my good lord
captain it looks like there is power
alright lets get to the bridge
then well find the crew
the console is intact captain
i will
try to reroute power to it
work fast
once we get this place lit up
were gonna draw a lot of attention
what do you think can you find them
aye captain
i am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crews sequence
you with me
i left something behind
that is one heck of a cold
nice job keenser
alright we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation
come on
lets go cmon
come on
this is the magellan probe
federation was using these to
find a way through the nebula
whats he using it for
what do you see
hes been piggybacking the subspace
links between the probes
can we use it to send a
distress signal
i can try
its sent
he has access to yorktown database
what
hes got startfleet datafiles
ship logs
including the enterprise
hes been watching us this whole time
captain
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time
i couldnt afford to get
caught with it
so i hid it in here
tell krall i have the abronath
do you believe every
sad story you hear
not every
put the phaser down please
did you get it chekov
aye captain ive traced
the location of her comm
what does krall want with this thing
to save you
from yourselves
captain
you all right
aye captain but we are trapped
can you get this thing started
are you intimating that we should
engage the thrusters
i am open to other suggestions
ok
theres a problem sir
what
fuel is primed but
i cannot get it to combust
captain we are basically standing
on a wery large bomb
if you miss the combustion compressor
i am not gonna miss come on
do you even know what the
combustion compressor looks like
ah its square right
no sir its round
thats what i said
go
chekov
chekov move
you think you know
what sacrifice really means
federation has taught you
that conflict should not exist
but without struggle
you would never know
who you truly are
you have no idea who we are
but youll soon find out
you mean the distress signal
you thought you sent
the coordinates were altered
your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula
and your base left full open
youre going to attack yorktown
millions of souls from every
federation world
holding hands
its a perfect target
youre wrong
there is strength in unity
the strength of others lieutenant
is what has kept me alive
no
spock
spock wake up dammit
i am entirely conscious doctor
i am simply contemplating
the nature of mortality
feeling philosophical huh
massive blood lossll do that to ya
you asked me why lt uhura
and i parted ways
i became concerned
in the light of vulcans demise
that i owed a debt of duty
to my species
you thought you should be off
making little vulcans huh
yup i can see how thatd upset her
i intended to discuss it
with her further
but i received some news
which affected me unexpectedly
what news
ambassador spock has died
spock im so sorry
i cant imagine what that must feel like
when youve lived as many lives as he
fear of death is illogical
fear of death
is what keeps us alive
i want to live as he did
that is why i decided
to redirect my efforts and
continue his work
on new vulcan
youre leaving starfleet
what jim have to say about that
i could not find the time
to tell him
well i can tell you
he is not gonna like that
hell i dont know what
hed do without ya
i mean you know me on the
other hand id throw a party
my god youre getting delirious
how far are we from
the coordinates of that call
still a ways sir
captain
when did you begin to suspect her
not soon enough
how did you know
i guess you could say
i got a good nose for danger
run
is that music
where on earth is that coming from
there
i plugged the little box in the power cell
and the little mouth make it sing
thats very clever
music is a bit old fashion
for my taste
not to mention very loud
and distracting
but hey well played
i like the beat and shouting
oh you do
switch it off
ach youre ok
switch it off
someone set off one of my traps
captain
you know these men
aye lassie
that wee man there is pavel chekov
and that handsome bastard
is james t kirk
theyre my mates
its good to see you sir
what is she doing scotty
dont hurt them because
youre free james t
mr scott
whos your new friend here
she sure knows how
to throw out the welcome mat
this is jaylah
i do not know what is a welcome mat
you find anybody else
no sir
im sorry youre the only ones
what the hell happened up there jim
why were we attacked
they were after the artifact
we brought back from teenax
did they get it
no
have you got it
no
i had to get it off the enterprise
so i put it on a shuttle
you hid it in a shuttle
yes
and no
this is the uss franklin sir
can you believe it
first earth ship capable of warp 4
went missing in the gagarin radiation belt
in the early 2160s
i remember that from the academy
captain balthazar edison
in the first years of starfleet
how the hell did his ship end up here
theres a lot o theories sir
surrended to the romulans
captured by a giant green space hand
this far out its gotta be
a wormhole displacement
can she fly
shes missing a few driver coils
and the eps conduits are fried
but jaylah has done a marvelous job
of getting the ships systems back online
thank you montgomery scotty
pardon me
mr chekov could you plug in
the coordinates
see if you can track the crews location
from the ships sensors
aye captain
he likes that seat
mr scott tour
yes the mess hall
jaylah if you will
yes
no clue what happend to the crew huh
ach no sir theyd be dead
a hundred years by now
is that
thats a px70
my dad used to have one
when he was a kid
mom said hed put her on the back
and then drive her nuts
sir
so youre telling me this things
been here this whole time and
no ones ever noticed it
shes riggeded up image refractors
like some sort of
holographic camouflage
aye sir
captain
ive intercepted a weak
communication transmission sir
its a starfleet frequency
can you lock onto the signal
yes but how do we get to them
i have an idea sir
but im gonna need your permission
why would you need my permission
because if i mess it up
i dont want it to be just my fault
mccoy and spock to enteprise crew
come in enterprise crew
anyone
come on spock
come on you can make it
leaving me behind will significantly
increase your chances of survival doctor
well thats damned chivalrous of you
but completly out of the question
it is imperative that you locate
any surviving crew
and here i was thinking you cared
of course i care about you
i always assumed my respect
for you is clear
the dialogue we have had
across the years has always
its ok spock
you dont have to say it
well at least i wont die alone
well thats just typical
come on you bastards
good to see you in one piece doctor
oh am i
i feel like my innards
have been to a barn dace
aye well these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo
but a few modifications seemed
to do the trick
i thought it was best
to beam you one at a time
you know in case you got spliced
oh i couldnt imagine a worse scenario
good to have you back
you all right
yeah im fine hes hurt
i am functioning adequately captain
in a pigs eye you are
captain
we discovered that the stolen artifact
appears to have come from this planet
dammit spock
are there any medical supplies
on this thing
this way
lie down come on
there you go
how are we gonna get out of
this one spock we got
no ship no crew
not the best odds
we will do what we have always done jim
we will find hope in the impossible
lets get you patched up first ok
captain
you must focus your efforts
on helping the crew
well thats why i need you
around spock
these things are from the dark ages
bones
im pretty sure this is protoplaser
itll stop the internal hemorraging
at least thats my hope
the miserable have
no other medicine but only hope
at deaths door and hes
quoting shakespeare
captains log stardate 22632
we searched the wreckage
he must have hidden it elsewhere
all we have is his crew krall
you will tell me where it is
now
no
stop
let him go and i will give you
what you want
no syl dont
lieutenant
unity is not your strength
it is your weakness
we should wait until
were absolutely sure
no we have to get the crew back now
chekov has the coordinates that
can lead us to kralls base so we go
with respect sir how do we know
that krall was at the base when she called
and even if he was we dont know
that the crew was with them
or if theyre even still alive
mr chekov can you reconfigure
the search parameters
in order to compensate for this formula
aye commander but what is this forumla
it is vokaya mr chekov
a mineral unique to vulcan
which emits a lowlevel radiation
ill have to filter out
all other energy emissions
spock what the hell would a vulcan
mineral be doing way out here
where are you going with this
lt uhura wears a vokaya amulet
which i presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect
you gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelery
the emissions is harmless doctor
but its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify
you gave your girlfriend
a tracking device
that was not my intention
im glad he doesnt respect me
i am detecting a wery trace
amount of wokaya
does the location match the coordinates
you acquired from kalar mr chekov
it is a match sir
its presence suggest that lt uhura
and thereby the rest of the crew
are being held at
kralls base of operation
can you beam them out
no sir there is some
geological interference
that is blocking the transporters signal
well i guess were gonna have to go in
and break them out the old fashioned way
you cannot go to this place
everyone who goes there he kills
youve been there youve seen it
why didnt you say something
lassie
because i knew you will ask me
to take you there
if your friends are there
then they will die
just like my family
and i will not go back
to that death place
aye but if youve escaped
then you can show us the way in
and the way out
no
this is not the deal we made
montgomery scotty
if you choose to do this
youre on your own
wait wait
let her go
shes lost people too captain
look thats our friends
out there lassie right
we cannae just leave em behind
now we could really use your help
we just need you to be brave is all
when we were in that place
krall would come and take someone
there were screams i can still hear them
and we would not see that person again
we did not know who would be next
my father planned an escape
but we were seen by the
by the one they call manas
my father fought him so i could get out
he was brave
and manas killed him
what you want is impossible
look maybe its not
right my wee granny used to say
ye cannae break a stick in a bundle
youre a part of something
bigger now lassie
alright dinnae give up on that
cause well sure as hell
never give up on you
that is what being part of crew
is all about
is that what you believe in james t
all i know is we stand
a better chance with you
the digging machines uncover the tunnel
that goes into the crater
thats how i got out
so thatll be our way in
the away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel
follow it to kralls base
get inside the building
break out the crew
ah captain we can not lock onto
anyone inside the crater
in order to beam them out
or i could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers
thatll get the signal into the crater
alright
how many people can the franklin
transport at a time
ah with a wee bit o modification
20 max but im not sure
how long it would hold out
bones mr chekov jaylah
youre with me in the away team
mr scott modify that transporter
then do everything you can
to get this ship operational
captain mr chekovs technical acumen
makes him more valuable
aboard the franklin with mr scott
is thereby logical that
i would replace him
why is that logical spock
you just got back on your feet
lt uhura is in that facility jim
ill keep an eye on him
understood
his soldiers are everywhere
we wont pass unseen
what we require is a diversion
i think i have an idea
this is abronath
it was used by the ancient ones
as a weapon
but when they could not control
its deadly power
they split it into two
and ejected the halves into space
hoping it would be lost forever
but i am grateful
i have spent lifetimes searching for it
only to have you find it for me
the poetry of fate
the world that i was born into
is very different from yours lieutenant
we knew pain we knew terror
struggle made us strong
not peace not unity
these are myths the federation
would have you believe
those are strong words
you might even believe them
but theres something else
going on with you
something underneath
wait
what are you doing with her
you already got what you wanted
let her go
no
manas
its time
the federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries
but no longer
this is where it begins lieutenant
this is where the frontier
pushes back
this way
where is he
i gotta admit
its a hell of a distraction
your friends are over there
come on
let me deal with them
youve brought us this far
finish the mission krall
go
commander uhura they took her
get the remainder of the crew
to safety
come on lets go move
ive got them mr scott
ok mr chekov increase the signal
were gonna grab them 20 at a time
aye
lets hope this doesnt get messy
energize
spock
what are you doing here
clearly i am here to rescue you
lets go
good to see you wee man
youll die here as your father
ten seconds until transporters
recharged doctor
wait for my signal
doctor
dammit man
were not leaving without em
come on lets go move move
we are ready for an extract
just turn on your beacon
scotty do you have everybody
aye sir everyone except you and jeylah
start the beacon and well grab ya
they will leave you here
captain your beacon
there it is
energize
jaylah
ok lets never do that again
i agree james t
you all right
captain this thing he has
yorktown
hes gonna destroy yorktown
you take my house
and you make it fly
scotty can you get this thing started
start it yes
flying sir thats a different thing
these old vessels
they were built in space
they were never supposed
to take off from atmosphere
make it happen
theyre called starships
for a reason captain
you tell me this now
because i didnt wanna disappoint ya
you know in case ya didnt make it back
how thoughtful mr scott
captain
hes launching
the attack on yorktown
may be just the beginning
armed with this bioweapon
he could rid it of all life
and use the bases advanced technology
to attack an untold number
of federation planets
were just gonna have
to get this thing flying
ach we cannae just jumpstart it sir
ok all systems online
dilithium chambers
at 70 and climbing
primary subwarp engines standing by
mr sulu
you can
you know
fly this thing right
you kidding me sir
fantastic
scotty how are we looking
ready as she will never be sir
thats what i like to hear
alright
bones where are we with the crew
i could use a functioning medbay
but otherwise were secure down here
mr sulu
we have to achieve terminal welocity
in order for the stabilizers
to prowide lift
are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that
well find out
call it mr sulu
aye aye captain
mr chekov be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers
full on my mark one quarter impulse
right
one half impulse mr chekov
aye
we should belt up go on go go go
easy mr sulu
lets not break her now
anytime mr sulu
now mr chekov
i have defalert on incoming vessel
no reply to all frequency id requests
visual
red alert red alert
look how far theyve come
im picking up distress signals from
every frequency coming from yorktown
kralls already starting his attack
mr scott what kind of
weapons do we have
we have pulsephase cannons
and spatial torpedoes
great lock and load
it does not matter
you cannot defeat the bees
maybe we lure them away
how do we get yorktown
time to get people to safety
we are coarse and buggy
compared to those things
were barely holding together
as it is captain
captain
the flight patterns of bees are
determined by individual decisions
kralls swarm formations
are too complex
not to rely on some form of
unified cyberpathic coordination
i surmise that if we
spock
skip to the end
what hes saying is
that if we disorient the swarm
we can kick its ass
precisely
scotty can you beam me onto
one of those swarm ships
have you gone completly mad
yes or no
no
yes
maybe
captain my familiarity of the interior
of those ships however brief
makes me more qualified
for this away mission
spock youre still hurt
shes right spock
i acknowledge and respect your concerns
perhaps you would feel more confident
if i were accompanied by someone
with a familiarity of both
the ship and my injury
hes gonna love this
you want me to do what
come along doctor
woah wait a minute
why you greenblooded ingrate
this was your idea
its a good idea bones
you know next time you have a
piece of pipe stuck in your transverse
call a plumber
just make sure you find a way
to break those things
if it gets hairy
ill beam ya straight back
energize
youre gonna do great
dammit jim im a doctor not a
you do realize the last time
i fooled with one of these things
we crashed
so dont blame me if we
hit something
spock to franklin
spock we read you
captain from what i can
ascertain the ships do indeed
share a cyberpathic link
which coordinates their actions
patching it through now
thats what their signal was
they werent jamming us
they were talking to each other
how do we get them to stop talking
what about electromagnetic focusing
we can use the transporters
to disturb their network
focus might be too specific
if we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate
it would have to be at a frequency
they would not anticipate
we could cause a chain reaction
that will wipe out the whole swarm
sir a closed network like that
might be susceptible
to very high frequency
vhf
radio we can broadcast
something from the ship
to drown out their links
something loud and distracting
loud and distracting
ive got just the thing
do not break my music
break it itll get an upgrade
swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through
i just got to reconfigure the vhf output
into a multiphasic sweep
let me do it
lassie
let her do it
ive been doing this for forty
alright you do it
there see
simple
alright
captain were ready to broadcast
but the signal wont travel far
we have to get closer
how close
very
intercept course mr sulu
put us right in the middle of that thing
yes sir
my old friend
the swarm ships are doubling back
theyre forming an attack wave sir
i think we got their attention
hold steady mr sulu
brace yourselves everybody
spock stand by
to drop out of formation
scotty you all cued up back there
aye sir
ready to broadcast at 577 mhz
made your choice lassie
i have the beat and shouting
lets make some noise
thats a good choice
faster doctor we risk being consumed
by their trajectorial decay
damn backseat driver
get ready doctor
i see it i see it
is that classical music
yes doctor it would seem to be
lt uhura make sure yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast
sir we now have the distrupion frequency
broadcast
you all right spock
we are fine captain
but there are still three ships
heading into yorktown
thats got to be krall
keep on him spock
do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon
my house is breaking
weve lost the polarization
of the hull plating
i can redirect the power
from the dilithium chamber
i need help
i need you jaylah lets go
do not lose them doctor
youre more than welcome
to switch places with me spock
captain intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility
gimme a schematic of yorktown
there yorktown headquarters
mr chekov can you do a bioscan
of central plaza
aye
theyre clearing ciwilians
bones theres a city plaza coming up
you gotta make sure krall heads for it
why
just do it
sulu get us up there
hold onto something
great work bones
thanks jim
now i just gotta figure out
how to land
captain i have 3 hull breaches
from the impact
deck 3 the cargo bay and
the engine room
alright sulu chekov
check the cargo bay and deck 3
we need confirmation that the weapon
has been neutralized and krall is dead
captain
its krall
weve seen him do this
its a some kind of energy transference
it physically changes him
he must still be on board
we wouldve seen him leave
sulu contact yorktown security
and lock down the ship
lets go
its about damn time
captain
its about damn time
push the frontier
its about damn time
push the frontier
its about damn time
push the frontier
its him
scotty i need you to link into
the franklin database
find out what you can about
balthazar edison
what the captain of the franklin
yeah
sir hed be long dead
no hes not
i dont know how but edison is krall
whatd you find
well his record goes back
way before the federation even existed
he was a major in the united earth
military assault command operation
a lot of offworld combat
he was a soldier
aye sir and pretty good one
his military service came to an end
when maco was disbanded
why what happened
the federation sir starfleet
were not a military agency
they made him a captain
and gave him the franklin
scotty bring up his logs
aye sir
captains log
last entry
captains log
i dont remember the stardate
all distress calls unanswered
of the crew
only 3 remain
i wont allow it
the indigenous race abandoned
this planet long ago
they left behind sophisticated
mining equipment
and a drone workforce
they had some sort of technology
that prolongs
life
ill do whatever it takes
for me and my crew
the federation do not care about us
youll probably never see me again
but if you do
be ready
why has he not used his weapon yet
because he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage
he needs a distribution system
they have to circulate air here right
aye sir theres an atmospheric
regulator in the core
lieutenant contact yorktown
make sure they shut it down
until we find krall
how would he access the core
well theres a maintenance tower
at the stations gravitational nexus
thats the only way
scotty you get over there
make sure it gets shut down
lassie youre with me
look this thing is impossible
to shut down
aye well
well see about that
mr scott why is that thing still on
were working on it sir
but as you can imagine
theres a lot of safety protocols
surrounding the thing that you know
keeps everybody alive
figure something out
be careful captain
gravity is gonna get a bit screwy
the closer you get to the center
right we should scan
the operational schematics
see if theres a backdoor
right
lassie im gonna need your eyes
stop
what happened to you out there
edison
edison
i have to say kirk
ive missed being me
we lost ourselves
but gained a purpose
a means to bring the galaxy
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong
i think you underestimate humanity
i fought for humanity
lost millions to the xindi
and romulan wars
and for what
for the federation to sit
in the captains chair
and break bread with the enemy
we change we have to
or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles
you lost
theres no way you can make it back there
give up
what like you did
i read your ships log
captain james t kirk
at least i know who i am
im a soldier
you won the war edison
you gave us peace
peace
is not what i was born into
scotty
captain
hes using the gravitational slipstream
to carry him back to the center
no
whats that
weapons in the chamber
captain we have to stop
the processor now
or everything breathing
in yorktown is dead
you cant stop it
you will die
better to die saving lives
than to live with taking them
thats what i was born into
scotty
captain i think we can redirect it
theres a sealed construction hatch
thatll let you vent the weapon
into space
now we can override the locks
from up here
but you have to activate the hatch
i just have to hit a button
its not a button sir
its a silver lever under a white panel
got it
and theres 4 of them
once youve turned the hatch
you have to exit the chamber immediately
if the hatch is open
when the processor cycles
and youre in it
youre gonna get sucked into space
what happens if the hatch isnt open
youre gonna get sucked
into a big fan
with the weapon
and we all die
dammit jim
you wont make it out in time
the vent
get out of there james t
scotty the last hatch wont open
scotty
work fast captain times running out
hes not gonna make it
what would i do without you spock
for decades the federation
thought that he was a hero
i guess time will judge us all
he just got lost
you saved this entire base kirk
millions of souls thank you
it wasnt just me never is
needless to say the
position of viceadmiral its yours
no one deserves it more
viceadmirals dont fly do they
no
they dont
no offense maam but
wheres the fun in that
you didnt even try to get
our time out here reduced
why would i get it reduced
bones we know our way
through the nebula now
can you imagine what well find
alien despots
hellbent on killing us
deadly spaceborne
viruses and bacteria
incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant
its gonna be so much fun
by the way wherere we going
i thought were here get a drink
i know you told me
to keep it under wraps but
happy birthday
mr sensitive
here you go
thanks scotty
everybody raise a glass
to captain james t kirk
captain kirk
thanks everybody
to the enterprise
to the enterprise
and to absent friends
heres to that
cheers
alright lets get this party started
i thought youve got to
finish your mission report
i do
but i thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socialy
you old romantic
do you know that scotch was actually
inwented by a little lady in russia
excuse me
did you drink all those yourself
im impressed
someone said it will take
my edge off
my edge is still not off
right well maybe thisll help
captain pulled a few strings
that is acceptance into starfleet academy
if you want it
we have a lotta rules
dont listen to em all
will i have to wear that uniform
fraid so
hey keenser
kevin still not wearing pants
i see
i heard about ambassador spock
is that what you wanted to mention
that time in the turbolift
more or less
i trust your meeting with
commodore harris went well
more or less
you really wanna head back
out there huh
space the final frontier
these are voyages
of the starship enterprise
its continuing mission
to explore strange new worlds
