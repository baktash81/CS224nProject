frat boy protein shake  did ya 
i ve been feeling so sick 
i swear  i can feel them
swimming inside me

or something 
i think the only thing you need pumped
is the air out of your head 
first  let me just congratulate you
on your choice of sexual activity   
because  sweetie  the world
is not ready for you to reproduce 
second  did you know that ingestion
of bodily fluids

and next time  get away
from the volcano before it erupts 
that wraps up another night 
this is sasha signing off on wzab 
parker  how exactly does sasha
come up with this stuff 
she devours every issue of  cosmo   
  calls it her bible 
  thank you 
finish the story
about stanley hall 
right 
so  this guy   
he was a professor on campus 
maybe 25 years ago 
what did he teach 
i don t know 
physics or some shit 
abnormal psychology 
you know  if you wanna tell
the story right 
not the point of the story 
paperboy 
but fine 
abnormal psych it is 
anyhoo   
this guy  he just flips out 
you know 
goes completely berserk 
grabs a hunting knife   
and he strolls into stanley hall 
bangs on every door 
and every student
that answers their door   
he takes that little knife 
and he cuts their throat   
ear to ear 
yeah  he does away
with an entire floor   
before finally stabbing himself   
straight through the heart 
and thus   
the annual omega sigma phi bash 
so you have a frat party
to commemorate a massacre 
you betcha 
let me get this straight 
when this happened 25 years ago   
you were a sophomore 
that s funny 
well  it s a bullshit story you hear
on every campus in the northeast 
thank you 
i mean  where s the proof 
you see  that s the thing 
pendleton knew damn well
that enrollment   
would suffer permanently 
so  in cahoots with the national
news media and various other powerful 
like lee harvey oswald 
or is it jack ruby 
no  i know who it was 
it was that f b i  guy who used to
prance around in women s underwear 
he covered it all up 
that s the news room 
i gotta go  get a life 
  hey  paul 
  yeah 
before you go  if there s another
e  coli crisis in the cafeteria   
i want you to have
the biggest  juiciest burger on me 
i d love to  that article
almost got me the student pulitzer 
  bye  paul 
  bye  paul 
know what his problem is 
he can t stand any big story   
without having his byline on it 
he is such a babe 
all right 
did it seem like
he was giving me the eye 
it was probably
the mirror behind us 
oh  damn 
should i ask him out anyway 
if parker s story is true
and all those kids were murdered here   
why haven t they torn down
stanley hall 
because the story s not true 
it s just a legend 
if it s just a legend 
then what s the problem 
  i won t encourage this 
  come on  natalie 
cut me a little slack  this is
half the reason i transferred here 
now what exactly happens
when i say  bloody mary  five times 
the person standing next to you wonders
how you got into college in the first place 
  come on 
  you re scared 
yeah  right 
then come on and let s do this 
come on 
time to raise the dead 
i can t believe this 
bloody mary 
fine  no answer 
maybe they re screening 
god 
let s go 
you called 
she was trying to summon
the dead  damon   
not frat boys
with badly grown facial hair 
it took me a month to grow this 
so is this what you do
for your free time  damon 
hang out in the dark by yourself 
waiting to scare people like a freak 
only when i see two losers
stand in front of this relic   
trying to summon the dead 
anyhow  i ll see you two
in class tomorrow 
  unfortunately 
  see ya 
jerk 
you know  he was halfway normal
before pledge week 
sorry 
shut off the fucking light 
sorry 
last week  we discussed
folklore as a gauge   
for the values of the society
that created them 
today 
today  we get more specific 
a baby sitter receives
menacing phone calls 
and upon investigating them   
she realizes that
they are originating   
from an upstairs bedroom   
the very room   
where she s left the children
under her care   
to sleep 
now  who s heard this before 
well  that really happened
to a girl in my hometown 
oh  yes 
i m sure it did 
i m sure most of you   
grew up thinking
this did happen to girls   
in all your hometowns   
but it didn t 
you see  the baby sitter   
and the man upstairs   
is what we call an urban legend 
contemporary folklore   
passed on as a true story 
there are variations
of this one   
going back to the 1960s   
all of them containing
the same cultural admonition 
young women  mind your children   
or harm will come your way 
excuse me 
something funny
you might care to share with us   
ms  
no  i was just saying  like   
maybe the cultural admonition is 
don t baby sit 
why don t you come up here   
and volunteer
for my little experiment  hmm 
yeah  that s a great idea 
now  young lady 
  coming 
  yeah  baby 
don t worry 
you ll probably survive 
  had those before 
  yeah  they re pop rocks 
they crackle in your mouth 
eat some 
thirsty 
well  what s wrong 
something you might have heard
about mixing pop rocks and soda 
well  supposedly   
your stomach and your intestines 
everything bursts 
really  anyone you know
who died this way 
mikey  from the cereal commercial 
give it to mikey 
he ll eat anything 
you mean him 
mikey likes it 
what if i told you
that this is mikey   
alive and well and working
as an ad executive in new york city 
would you drink some then 
i ll do it 
your soda 
voila  still alive 
as i said  class   
this story is nothing
but an urban legend 
professor 
he s gonna explode 
somebody call 911  go 
thank you for your help 
brilliant  he s brilliant 
he is such a moron 
yeah  but who fell for it 
hey  what s going on 
excuse me  young man 
can t read these 
she just left the campus 
  she went to pendleton 
  you have got to be kidding me 
i knew i should ve gone to n y u 
tragic  huh 
hi 
is this true 
i certainly hope so 
otherwise i m gonna have
one hell of a retraction on my hands 
what do you think you re doin  
you can t just come
and take every copy here 
you re the one that wrote
this inflammatory piece of rubbish 
actually  the fatuous quotes about
being deeply shocked and heartsick   
are yours  dean adams 
let me tell you something 
young man 
the only lunatic
on this campus is you 
i m flattered 
can i quote you on that 
i have a quote for ya 
 u s  news and world report    
named pendleton the safest university
in this country 
and you best believe 
i intend to keep it that way 
thank you  reese 
i ll make sure   
and stick that in the special
school safety edition 
hold on a second 
how about some interviews  you know 
students react to
the tragedy on campus 
i am saddened and moved by 
this was someone s life 
did you even spend one minute
thinking about that 
no  i didn t 
but because of my story 
3 500 students will 
i think that s enough
to help me sleep at night 
come on  let s go 
the decapitated body
of 20 year old   
pendleton student  michelle mancini   
was found in her car 
police suspect her assailant
was probably hiding in the back seat 
in the meantime  the search continues
for michael mcdonald   
the proprietor of this gas station
where she was last seen 
police are asking anyone with
any information on his whereabouts   
to contact them immediately 
this is david mcaree
reporting live 
that s horrible 
someone told me that she was listening
to my show when it happened 
my voice was probably
the last thing she heard 
  can you imagine 
  what if there is a lunatic on campus 
that s fine with me  i m hitting the
half pipe at kellington this weekend 
did anyone here know her 
she roomed in daley 
  no 
  no 
hello 
space cadet 
oh  no  i didn t know her 
actually  you know 
i did know her 
  you did 
  yeah 
i ll miss her  too  because   
that girl gave great head 
you get it 
she gave great head 
  come on 
  that was good 
hey  tash 
  sorry about last night 
  yeah 
well  don t let it happen again 
here  you dropped these 
excuse me 
this is my phone line too 
hey  it s brenda 
you seemed kind of weird this afternoon 
you okay  hon  call me 
natalie  it s mom 
listen  sweetie  i m just calling
to make sure you re okay 
isn t it horrible about michelle 
please call  okay 
i love you 
hey  i was just
in the neighborhood 
thought i d drop by 
see if you wanted to go to the house 
parker said he s gonna
pierce hootie s nose 
hootie s a dog 
yeah  there s no reason
he can t be hip 
no  that s okay  damon 
what s up  you all right 
yeah  i m fine 
listen  we don t have to go hang out
with a bunch of drunken frat boys 
we could just
go someplace and talk 
i don t really want this
to get out around campus   
but i can actually be a pretty good
listener every once in a while 
  a little something to warm you up 
  sure 
it s a slight process 
oh  god 
so you and michelle
were friends then 
yeah 
so what happened 
i d really rather not
talk about it anymore 
it s completely understandable 
if you don t want to open up 
that s fine 
i want you to know that   
i know exactly
what you re going through 
  you do 
  sure 
i lost somebody close to me 
my girlfriend  she s 
  she s dead 
  oh  i m so sorry 
no  it s okay 
she was sick for awhile 
she had   
a syndrome   
and after that   
i was afraid to get close to anybody
for a long time  but then   
it hit me  you know 
why am i being so selfish 
i still have so much love
inside of me left to give 
  you do 
  yeah  and natalie   
you re in need of loving 
  i am 
  yeah 
you re lonely 
you re repressed 
you re aching to break loose 
those are the type of problems
that only a man can fix 
and  i suppose 
you re that man 
well  you know 
nice try  that was a fairly good
impersonation of a human being 
i understand  you re afraid 
but you don t
have to be afraid anymore 
you don t have to
be afraid to love 
start the car right now 
okay  that hurt  i m just trying
to help you out here 
you don t have to act
like such a bitch 
it s not an act 
believe me 
you sure you don t wanna
think this over 
because i m all about healing 
one black eye or two 
you decide 
all right  fine 
i m gonna take a piss 
i ll be right back 
pig 
shake it and let s go 
come on 
don t start the car 
this is the end of your rotten life 
you motherfuckin  dope pusher 
it was easy for him because he really
didn t believe it was coming 
but it ain t gonna be easy for you
because you better believe this coming 
girl  what s wrong with you 
they killed him 
somebody killed him 
it s right past this bridge 
i don t see nothing 
are you sure this is it 
  i don t get it  the car was 
  here  huh 
you don t mind me asking 
what the hell are you on 
nothing  the car was right here 
  right here 
  i saw his body  i touched it 
it s probably the same person
who killed michelle mancini 
that s impossible  baby 
the police arrested that gas station
attendant this afternoon 
it was a mannequin 
damon uses it all the time
to scare pledges during hazing 
he also has this
life size blow up doll 
  but you don t wanna know about that 
  it wasn t a mannequin 
  damon was dead 
  come on 
damon is the best practical joker
on this campus  all right 
he once convinced a freshman he was
the middle hanson brother to get laid 
  shouldn t he be enjoying his handiwork 
  weekend snowboarding trip 
some last fling bachelor party
with some high school buddies 
come on 
whoa  wait a minute 
scratching on the roof
of the car 
don t you guys get it 
come on 
just like that urban legend 
  what are you talking about 
  come on 
wexler talks about it
every semester in class 
you know  guy and a girl
parked out in the woods  making out 
  you made out with him 
  guy steps out of the car   
and the girl starts to hear
these scratching noises on the roof 
it s her dead boyfriend 
hung from a tree 
damon s in the class 
he knew the myth 
he must ve just planned
the whole thing out 
well  i thought it was the only way
a girl would ever say he was hung 
conniving bastard 
wait a second 
isn t there another story   
about a guy with an axe
hiding in a woman s back seat 
hello  my mom still checks the back seat
before getting into a car 
that s how michelle mancini died 
oh  my god 
what are you trying to say 
it s like someone out there
is taking all these stories   
and making them reality 
then my big question is 
what is he gonna do next 
maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum
or ram a gerbil up a celebrity s ass 
come on 
give damon a call
up at kellington 
you ll see he s there 
  do you mind if i use 
  what 
never mind 
yeah  there was a blonde guy who arrived
with that group this morning 
bachelor party or something 
damon brooks  specifically 
can you tell me if he checked in 
well  i really
can t tell you that 
the cabin s not in his name 
and it s not on his credit card 
look  i m happy to take the message 
but i can t guarantee he ll pick it up 
so whatever you want me 
hello 
is someone there 
  look what i found 
  what 
an early edition of  kama sutra    
with illustrations 
you think parker ll get into it 
does he have a choice 
what s that 
  don t tell me you still think 
  i don t know 
this is it 
wait a second 
this is definitely not a myth 
  what 
  the  gang high beam initiation   
it happens all the time 
gang members drive around at night
with their headlights off 
and when someone goes to flash their
high beams to warn them  they kill them 
that s why i never warn anybody
about anything when i drive 
anyway  i gotta go 
i got some homework 
  see you later 
  bye 
sounds like elvira s raising more
than just the dead in there 
thanks for the warning 
i m sorry 
i m not looking 
better check her pulse 
she s looked like that for years 
  how is she 
  i don t know 
i haven t had a chance
to talk to her yet 
all right 
i ll see you later 
we know this is
difficult for you  but   
we need to understand why   
if you heard moaning   
you didn t turn on the lights 
i d walked in on tash having sex before 
it wasn t something
i cared to see again 
so you never actually
saw anyone there 
i sensed that 
no  honey  did you
see anyone in the room 
did you know
tash was manic depressive 
she painted half the room black 
i had a pretty good idea 
there are no signs
of foul play here 
no forced entry 
what are you saying 
it appears to be
a tragic suicide 
no  tash didn t kill herself 
there was someone else
in that room 
 aren t you glad you didn t
turn on the lights   for christ s sake 
a very morbid suicide note 
honey  i am so sorry 
are you all right 
of course not 
stupid question 
i mean  who would ve thought
she would do something like that 
i mean  she s weird
and everything  but 
you wanna go get some coffee
and talk 
i just gotta be alone right now 
i know that this is
a really bad time for you   
but i gotta ask you
a couple of questions 
no  i m not doing
any interviews 
if it makes you feel any better 
i don t wanna talk about tash 
i just wanted to know   
if you can tell me
a little bit about this 
how did you get that 
i contacted
michelle s high school 
your high school 
now  why didn t you tell me
you knew her 
so you could exploit her death
more than you already have 
i m just doing my job 
okay  what am i supposed to do 
turn my back on a murder 
or a suicide 
it wasn t a suicide 
what are you talking about 
she was murdered 
just like michelle 
just like damon 
i don t know what s
going on here  but   
you know  if you want 
we can go somewhere and talk 
off the record 
  you don t believe me either 
  that s not what i m saying 
it s just that   
the idea of an urban legend
serial killer   
it s a stretch 
but don t you think it s possible 
yeah  it s possible 
but i don t know 
maybe the gas station attendant
killed michelle 
maybe damon s snowboarding 
and maybe   
tash just killed herself 
if it is true   
why like this 
why now 
tonight s the 25th anniversary 
what s that got to do
with anything 
the stanley hall massacre 
i told you 
that story is not true 
are you sure 
all right  if there s any truth
to stanley hall   
it d be in here 
so this is where you research
all your lurid articles 
reality is lurid  all right 
i m only the messenger 
 71  72   74 
that s weird 
 73 s not here 
how long you been workin  here 
too damn long 
you know anything
about stanley hall 
i don t know
what you re talking about 
did anyone die there 
please 
we really need to know 
talk to wexler 
it s his office hours 
he should be here 
here  watch out 
just a second 
would you look at that 
so do they
teach you this in class 
i dropped journalism ethics early in
the semester  wasn t helping my g p a 
oh  shit 
  is he gone 
  yeah 
something i can help you with 
you two break in
to a professor s office   
and then have the audacity
to accuse him of murder 
we found the axe 
that is a prop
i use in my folklore class 
how can you even suggest that i had
anything to do with that girl s death 
why don t you tell us
about the stanley hall massacre 
professor wexler  reese   
may i have a moment alone
with them 
after our talk this morning   
i decided to take a look
at your personal file 
probation for
reckless endangerment 
it was just for a year 
i d already been accepted here 
which was lucky 
we don t usually accept   
students with a criminal record 
as for you  young man   
you re off the paper   
effective immediately 
no  you can t do that  okay 
read the charter 
the dean can t dictate
editorial policy 
i didn t fire you 
your editor did 
we spoke an hour ago 
have a good weekend 
what was all that about 
reckless endangerment 
we re not exactly talking about
running a stop sign here  are we now 
i really don t
wanna talk about it 
oh  okay  what do you want
to talk about 
my career options
without a body of writing samples 
because for your information 
they re kind of limited 
it was in high school 
it s over 
look  does this have something
to do with michelle mancini 
hey  i just wanna know
what s going on here   
because i don t know
if i buy it anymore 
i don t know
if i ever bought it 
it s gonna be a wet one
out there tonight  folks 
the storm is expected to bring
four inches of rain   
and 30 mile per hour winds
throughout most of new england 
local authorities are advising
everyone to please stay indoors 
if you do decide to go out though 
make sure you grab a slicker 
natalie  nothing is
gonna happen to me 
but why do you keep doing this
to yourself 
look at you 
you ve gotta stop this 
i knew michelle mancini 
we went to high school together 
we hadn t spoken in   
two years 
why 
we were in my car one night 
michelle was driving 
the story about the gang high beam
initiation had been going around 
michelle wanted to play
a practical joke   
so she turned the headlights off   
and waited for the first car
to pass by and flash us 
when someone finally did   
she made a u turn and   
started chasing him   
flashing her high beams  laughing 
i was laughing  too 
at first   
then we started going really fast 
i wanted to tell her to stop   
but i just sat there 
and then the other car
lost control and ran off the road 
he was our age 
by the time the ambulance came 
he was already dead 
the courts were lenient with us 
we just got probation 
i was never able to forgive her
for what she did 
i guess i couldn t forgive myself
for not doing something more to stop it 
oh  my god 
how awful   
for everyone 
i don t know 
i think i should just go home 
come on  you need to be relaxed 
have some fun and come to the party 
please 
  promise you won t leave me alone 
  i promise 
unless  of course  i hook up with
some cute  little blue eyed journalist 
then you might have
to fend for yourself 
  don t do that 
  sorry 
little jumpy 
no  not at all 
i was just thinking 
me too 
it wouldn t be a bad idea to add a few
extra guards this weekend just in case 
in case what 
well  after that suicide and
what happened to the mancini girl   
now i m having trouble locating another
student  a boy named damon brooks 
he s been missing
for some days now 
missing  he s not missing 
it s the weekend 
he s probably shacked up
in some motel   
with a girl or a guy
or a farm animal 
whatever 
weren t you ever 18 
  not that kind of 18 
  my point is   
i don t want you overreacting 
don t contact anyone
without my permission 
no parents  no police 
  is that understood 
  understood 
good night  sir 
go  come on  boy 
there you go 
there you go 
that s my boy 
i love you 
hey  listen 
that scream 
that s an actual cry for help   
by a girl being murdered 
  you re kidding me 
  no 
that s why it sounds so real   
because it was lifted
off a 911 tape 
  that s great 
  yeah 
hey  you made it 
and already 
i m starting to regret it 
i m gonna get something to drink 
you want anything 
  a beer 
  okay  be right back 
stanley hall s not a legend 
there was one survivor that night 
it makes perfect sense 
pendleton covered up
stanley hall   
and wexler  so long as
he keeps his mouth shut   
he gets a job for life 
  why would he do it 
  it eats at him 
and probably every year around
this time  he goes a little wacko 
this year  off the charts 
well  then  we have to call the police
right away before it happens again 
i already tried 
dean adams beat me to it 
they said he warned them
to expect some prank calls tonight 
he even gave them our names 
look 
i m sorry i doubted you before 
what 
  hey 
  what is he trying to do to me 
i m so scared 
hey   
listen to me 
nothing s gonna happen
to you  okay 
i promise 
you don t waste any time  do you 
  here  it s light 
  oh  shit 
what was all that about 
i screwed up 
jesus  you trying to give me
a heart attack here 
the building s off limits
after 10 00 
good night to you too 
hello 
oh  what 
hey  parker 
let me talk to you for a second 
look  you might wanna
end this party a little early 
what 
natalie was right all along 
say no more 
everybody  listen up 
no  listen 
turn the music down 
listen  everybody 
paul here  he thinks
we should end the party 
no 
tell everybody
why they should go home 
there s a killer on campus 
and let me guess 
this killer is offing people   
based on urban legends 
yeah  that s right 
well  i ve got a legend
that you may or may not have heard of 
this mediocre woodward and bernstein
wanna be realized   
i m gonna graduate in a couple of weeks
and end up writing gardening tips   
for martha stewart s  living   
hang on 
unless i get a really hot story 
something that really flies 
i got it 
i ll take advantage
of my homicidal instincts   
and i ll start killing people   
in a trendy 
attention getting  cover story   
kind of way   
basing them on urban legends

i m sorry  but i can t understand
a thing you re saying  doll 
now  if i remove the gag   
you have got to promise me   
that you won t scream 
lord knows i had
enough of that with sasha

i prefer the term  eccentric    
but   
yeah   
i guess you could say
i m a little nutty 
why 
you still haven t
figured it out  have you 
well  lucky for you  miss thang   
i ve got a visual aid 
there i am   
with my boyfriend   
the love of my life 
have you found the love
of your life yet 
course not 
you re too self involved to bother 
pic ring any bells 
oh  my god 
his name was david evans 
the one you and your friend decided
to have a little fun with that night 
david and i
were gonna get married   
that summer   
right after graduation 
he didn t have enough money
to buy me a ring yet so   
he got me this instead   
the night you
took him away from me 
brenda  i wasn t 
you weren t driving 
but it was your car   
and you were there  natalie 
now   
didn t you tell me   
that you were having
a little difficulty   
forgiving yourself 
i thought   
as a friend   
i could help you out
in that department 
payback s a bitch 
isn t it 
brenda  please 
you need to get help 
i have already tried therapy 
obviously  it did me no good 
and i must say   
i am kind of enjoying all this   
playing with your
pretty little head 
you used an urban legend
to kill my boyfriend 
and now 
what are you gonna do 
oh  just my favorite u l 
the kidney heist 
you do know this one  don t you 
guy gets picked up
by a woman at a bar 
she takes him back to her hotel room 
fixes him a drink  boom  knocked out 
when he wakes up 
he s in a bathtub full of ice   
and he realizes that one of his kidneys
has been removed 
supposedly they sell them
on the black market 
i don t think
it s ever actually happened though 
till tonight 
you won t get away with this 
natalie  of course i will 
i ve got the perfect murder   
in the trunk of paul s car 
  you re sick 
  professor   
does away with his students 
then kills himself   
in the same manner
as the course he teaches 
it s beautiful 
it s so fucking clean  isn t it 
well  enough chat  nat 
i m sorry 
i don t have any anesthesia 
i guess you ll just have to bite down
real hard on that gag   
and hope that you go
into shock soon 
please  don t do this 
don t you wanna be
an urban legend 
all your friends are now 
ouch  stupid bitch 
i m really going to enjoy
watching you bleed to death 
now  is this   
your kidney 
or is that the liver 
i was always such a dope
in anatomy 
well  who cares  right 
first organ i see 
i m just gonna grab it 
drop the weapon 
oh  great 
rent a cop to the rescue 
put your hands up 
get up against the wall 
you loony psycho bitch 
it s all right  sugar 
it s gonna be okay 
move it 
don t you move 
don t you fucking move 
shit  bullet through the head 
not exactly an urban legend 
but in the essence of time 
it s not gonna bring him back 
i know that   
but it will bring
a devastated little paul   
right into my arms 
i ll have him 
and he ll have his pulitzer 
what did you think 
i was gonna let you take
two men out of my life 
very well done 
i couldn t have planned it
better myself 
  really 
  yeah 
i mean  i thought i was screwed
after natalie   
fucked it up for me
with the dean  but this 
this is just what i need 
a few things though 
i m listening 
well   
i need some details   
for my article 
you know  about how wexler
did each one 
details only you could give me 
it would be great
for your career 
and we would be
so fucking hot together 
and i d be very grateful 
so why don t you give me the gun 
i ll take care of the rest 
you re cute 
but you re not that fucking cute 
now  which one of you   
do i kill first 
what  are you gonna shoot me 
huh 
what kind of friend are you 
give me the gun 
come here 
  you all right 
  no 
thought i d have to wait
to be a cop   
before a bullet ever hit me 
just stay down 
  we re gonna go get some help 
  all right  quick 
do you think reese ll be okay 
reese is gonna be fine 
paramedics are on the way 
this ll become a legend 
too  you know 
it ll change a little
from person to person  of course 
brenda will become a guy 
you ll become a cop 
and i ll end up
in some insane asylum 
so if this is an urban legend   
at what point
do we get to the twist 
the river was such a mess
because of the storm   
it washed away the body 
the thing of it is   
they never found a body 
it wasn t there 
  bullshit 
  it s true 
happened right here at ashton 
i swear to god 
that is a stupid story you hear
at every campus in the northeast 
exactly 
i mean  where s your proof 
were you even listening 
it all keeps getting covered up 
think about it 
who would enroll at murder u  
yeah  and you know what 
natalie 
she s my old roommate s cousin 
and brenda s the girl
in that noxzema commercial 
look  does anybody here
believe me 
  not a chance 
  no 
  i believe you 
  thank you
