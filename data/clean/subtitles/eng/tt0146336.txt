well thats just the problem
i mean i didnt
had yourself a little
frat boy protein shake did ya
ive been feeling so sick
i swear i can feel them
swimming inside me
should i get my stomach pumped
or something
i think the only thing you need pumped
is the air out of your head
first let me just congratulate you
on your choice of sexual activity
because sweetie the world
is not ready for you to reproduce
second did you know that ingestion
of bodily fluids
is a major safe sex nono
really
really
my suggestion is that you down
a couple shots of pepto
and next time get away
from the volcano before it erupts
that wraps up another night
this is sasha signing off on wzab
parker how exactly does sasha
come up with this stuff
she devours every issue of cosmo
calls it her bible
thank you
finish the story
about stanley hall
right
so this guy
he was a professor on campus
maybe 25 years ago
what did he teach
i dont know
physics or some shit
abnormal psychology
you know if you wanna tell
the story right
not the point of the story
paperboy
but fine
abnormal psych it is
anyhoo
this guy he just flips out
you know
goes completely berserk
grabs a hunting knife
and he strolls into stanley hall
bangs on every door
and every student
that answers their door
he takes that little knife
and he cuts their throat
ear to ear
yeah he does away
with an entire floor
before finally stabbing himself
straight through the heart
and thus
the annual omega sigma phi bash
so you have a frat party
to commemorate a massacre
you betcha
let me get this straight
when this happened 25 years ago
you were a sophomore
thats funny
well its a bullshit story you hear
on every campus in the northeast
thank you
i mean wheres the proof
you see thats the thing
pendleton knew damn well
that enrollment
would suffer permanently
so in cahoots with the national
news media and various other powerful
like lee harvey oswald
or is it jack ruby
no i know who it was
it was that fbi guy who used to
prance around in womens underwear
he covered it all up
thats the news room
i gotta go get a life
hey paul
yeah
before you go if theres another
e coli crisis in the cafeteria
i want you to have
the biggest juiciest burger on me
id love to that article
almost got me the student pulitzer
bye paul
bye paul
know what his problem is
he cant stand any big story
without having his byline on it
he is such a babe
all right
did it seem like
he was giving me the eye
it was probably
the mirror behind us
oh damn
should i ask him out anyway
if parkers story is true
and all those kids were murdered here
why havent they torn down
stanley hall
because the storys not true
its just a legend
if its just a legend
then whats the problem
i wont encourage this
come on natalie
cut me a little slack this is
half the reason i transferred here
now what exactly happens
when i say bloody mary five times
the person standing next to you wonders
how you got into college in the first place
come on
youre scared
yeah right
then come on and lets do this
come on
time to raise the dead
i cant believe this
bloody mary
fine no answer
maybe theyre screening
god
lets go
you called
she was trying to summon
the dead damon
not frat boys
with badly grown facial hair
it took me a month to grow this
so is this what you do
for your free time damon
hang out in the dark by yourself
waiting to scare people like a freak
only when i see two losers
stand in front of this relic
trying to summon the dead
anyhow ill see you two
in class tomorrow
unfortunately
see ya
jerk
you know he was halfway normal
before pledge week
sorry
shut off the fucking light
sorry
last week we discussed
folklore as a gauge
for the values of the society
that created them
today
today we get more specific
a babysitter receives
menacing phone calls
and upon investigating them
she realizes that
they are originating
from an upstairs bedroom
the very room
where shes left the children
under her care
to sleep
now whos heard this before
well that really happened
to a girl in my hometown
oh yes
im sure it did
im sure most of you
grew up thinking
this did happen to girls
in all your hometowns
but it didnt
you see the babysitter
and the man upstairs
is what we call an urban legend
contemporary folklore
passed on as a true story
there are variations
of this one
going back to the 1960s
all of them containing
the same cultural admonition
young women mind your children
or harm will come your way
excuse me
something funny
you might care to share with us
ms
no i was just saying like
maybe the cultural admonition is
dont babysit
why dont you come up here
and volunteer
for my little experiment hmm
yeah thats a great idea
now young lady
coming
yeah baby
dont worry
youll probably survive
had those before
yeah theyre pop rocks
they crackle in your mouth
eat some
thirsty
well whats wrong
something you might have heard
about mixing pop rocks and soda
well supposedly
your stomach and your intestines
everything bursts
really anyone you know
who died this way
mikey from the cereal commercial
give it to mikey
hell eat anything
you mean him
mikey likes it
what if i told you
that this is mikey
alive and well and working
as an ad executive in new york city
would you drink some then
ill do it
your soda
voila still alive
as i said class
this story is nothing
but an urban legend
professor
hes gonna explode
somebody call 911 go
thank you for your help
brilliant hes brilliant
he is such a moron
yeah but who fell for it
hey whats going on
excuse me young man
cant read these
she just left the campus
she went to pendleton
you have got to be kidding me
i knew i shouldve gone to nyu
tragic huh
hi
is this true
i certainly hope so
otherwise im gonna have
one hell of a retraction on my hands
what do you think youre doin
you cant just come
and take every copy here
youre the one that wrote
this inflammatory piece of rubbish
actually the fatuous quotes about
being deeply shocked and heartsick
are yours dean adams
let me tell you something
young man
the only lunatic
on this campus is you
im flattered
can i quote you on that
i have a quote for ya
us news and world report
named pendleton the safest university
in this country
and you best believe
i intend to keep it that way
thank you reese
ill make sure
and stick that in the special
school safety edition
hold on a second
how about some interviews you know
students react to
the tragedy on campus
i am saddened and moved by
this was someones life
did you even spend one minute
thinking about that
no i didnt
but because of my story
3500 students will
i think thats enough
to help me sleep at night
come on lets go
the decapitated body
of 20yearold
pendleton student michelle mancini
was found in her car
police suspect her assailant
was probably hiding in the back seat
in the meantime the search continues
for michael mcdonald
the proprietor of this gas station
where she was last seen
police are asking anyone with
any information on his whereabouts
to contact them immediately
this is david mcaree
reporting live
thats horrible
someone told me that she was listening
to my show when it happened
my voice was probably
the last thing she heard
can you imagine
what if there is a lunatic on campus
thats fine with me im hitting the
half pipe at kellington this weekend
did anyone here know her
she roomed in daley
no
no
hello
space cadet
oh no i didnt know her
actually you know
i did know her
you did
yeah
ill miss her too because
that girl gave great head
you get it
she gave great head
come on
that was good
hey tash

yeah
well dont let it happen again
here you dropped these
excuse me
this is my phone line too

hey i was just
in the neighborhood

parker said hes gonna
pierce hooties nose
hooties a dog
yeah theres no reason
he cant be hip
no thats okay damon
whats up you all right
yeah im fine
listen we dont have to go hang out
with a bunch of drunken frat boys
we could just
go someplace and talk
i dont really want this
to get out around campus
but i can actually be a pretty good
listener every once in a while
a little something to warm you up
sure
its a slight process
oh god
so you and michelle
were friends then
yeah
so what happened
id really rather not
talk about it anymore
its completely understandable
if you dont want to open up
thats fine
i want you to know that
i know exactly
what youre going through
you do
sure
i lost somebody close to me
my girlfriend shes
shes dead
oh im so sorry
no its okay
she was sick for awhile
she had
a syndrome
and after that
i was afraid to get close to anybody
for a long time but then
it hit me you know
why am i being so selfish
i still have so much love
inside of me left to give
you do
yeah and natalie
youre in need of loving
i am
yeah
youre lonely
youre repressed
youre aching to break loose
those are the type of problems
that only a man can fix
and i suppose
youre that man
well you know
nice try that was a fairly good
impersonation of a human being
i understand youre afraid
but you dont
have to be afraid anymore
you dont have to
be afraid to love
start the car right now
okay that hurt im just trying
to help you out here
you dont have to act
like such a bitch
its not an act
believe me
you sure you dont wanna
think this over
because im all about healing
one black eye or two
you decide
all right fine
im gonna take a piss
ill be right back
pig
shake it and lets go
come on
dont start the car
this is the end of your rotten life
you motherfuckin dope pusher
it was easy for him because he really
didnt believe it was coming
but it aint gonna be easy for you
because you better believe this coming
girl whats wrong with you
they killed him
somebody killed him
its right past this bridge
i dont see nothing
are you sure this is it
i dont get it the car was
here huh
you dont mind me asking
what the hell are you on
nothing the car was right here
right here
i saw his body i touched it
its probably the same person
who killed michelle mancini
thats impossible baby
the police arrested that gas station
attendant this afternoon
it was a mannequin
damon uses it all the time
to scare pledges during hazing
he also has this
lifesize blowup doll
but you dont wanna know about that
it wasnt a mannequin
damon was dead
come on
damon is the best practical joker
on this campus all right
he once convinced a freshman he was
the middle hanson brother to get laid
shouldnt he be enjoying his handiwork
weekend snowboarding trip
some lastfling bachelor party
with some high school buddies
come on
whoa wait a minute
scratching on the roof
of the car
dont you guys get it
come on
just like that urban legend
what are you talking about
come on
wexler talks about it
every semester in class
you know guy and a girl
parked out in the woods making out
you made out with him
guy steps out of the car
and the girl starts to hear
these scratching noises on the roof
its her dead boyfriend
hung from a tree
damons in the class
he knew the myth
he mustve just planned
the whole thing out
well i thought it was the only way
a girl would ever say he was hung
conniving bastard
wait a second
isnt there another story
about a guy with an axe
hiding in a womans back seat
hello my mom still checks the back seat
before getting into a car
thats how michelle mancini died
oh my god
what are you trying to say
its like someone out there
is taking all these stories
and making them reality
then my big question is
what is he gonna do next
maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum
or ram a gerbil up a celebritys ass
come on
give damon a call
up at kellington
youll see hes there
do you mind if i use
what
never mind
yeah there was a blonde guy who arrived
with that group this morning
bachelor party or something
damon brooks specifically
can you tell me if he checked in
well i really
cant tell you that
the cabins not in his name
and its not on his credit card
look im happy to take the message
but i cant guarantee hell pick it up
so whatever you want me
hello
is someone there
look what i found
what
an early edition of kama sutra
with illustrations
you think parkerll get into it
does he have a choice
whats that
dont tell me you still think
i dont know
this is it
wait a second
this is definitely not a myth
what
the gang high beam initiation
it happens all the time
gang members drive around at night
with their headlights off
and when someone goes to flash their
high beams to warn them they kill them
thats why i never warn anybody
about anything when i drive
anyway i gotta go
i got some homework
see you later
bye
sounds like elviras raising more
than just the dead in there
thanks for the warning
im sorry
im not looking
better check her pulse
shes looked like that for years
how is she
i dont know
i havent had a chance
to talk to her yet
all right
ill see you later
we know this is
difficult for you but
we need to understand why
if you heard moaning
you didnt turn on the lights
id walked in on tash having sex before
it wasnt something
i cared to see again
so you never actually
saw anyone there
i sensed that
no honey did you
see anyone in the room
did you know
tash was manicdepressive
she painted half the room black
i had a pretty good idea
there are no signs
of foul play here
no forced entry
what are you saying
it appears to be
a tragic suicide
no tash didnt kill herself
there was someone else
in that room
arent you glad you didnt
turn on the lights for christs sake
a very morbid suicide note
honey i am so sorry
are you all right
of course not
stupid question
i mean who wouldve thought
she would do something like that
i mean shes weird
and everything but
you wanna go get some coffee
and talk
i just gotta be alone right now
i know that this is
a really bad time for you
but i gotta ask you
a couple of questions
no im not doing
any interviews
if it makes you feel any better
i dont wanna talk about tash
i just wanted to know
if you can tell me
a little bit about this
how did you get that
i contacted
michelles high school
your high school
now why didnt you tell me
you knew her
so you could exploit her death
more than you already have
im just doing my job
okay what am i supposed to do
turn my back on a murder
or a suicide
it wasnt a suicide
what are you talking about
she was murdered
just like michelle
just like damon
i dont know whats
going on here but
you know if you want
we can go somewhere and talk
off the record
you dont believe me either
thats not what im saying
its just that
the idea of an urban legend
serial killer
its a stretch
but dont you think its possible
yeah its possible
but i dont know
maybe the gas station attendant
killed michelle
maybe damons snowboarding
and maybe
tash just killed herself
if it is true
why like this
why now
tonights the 25th anniversary
whats that got to do
with anything
the stanley hall massacre
i told you
that story is not true
are you sure
all right if theres any truth
to stanley hall
itd be in here
so this is where you research
all your lurid articles
reality is lurid all right
im only the messenger
7172 74
thats weird
73s not here
how long you been workin here
too damn long
you know anything
about stanley hall
i dont know
what youre talking about
did anyone die there
please
we really need to know
talk to wexler
its his office hours
he should be here
here watch out
just a second
would you look at that
so do they
teach you this in class
i dropped journalism ethics early in
the semester wasnt helping my gpa
oh shit
is he gone
yeah
something i can help you with
you two break in
to a professors office
and then have the audacity
to accuse him of murder
we found the axe
that is a prop
i use in my folklore class
how can you even suggest that i had
anything to do with that girls death
why dont you tell us
about the stanley hall massacre
professor wexler reese
may i have a moment alone
with them
after our talk this morning
i decided to take a look
at your personal file
probation for
reckless endangerment
it was just for a year
id already been accepted here
which was lucky
we dont usually accept
students with a criminal record
as for you young man
youre off the paper
effective immediately
no you cant do that okay
read the charter
the dean cant dictate
editorial policy
i didnt fire you
your editor did
we spoke an hour ago
have a good weekend
what was all that about
reckless endangerment
were not exactly talking about
running a stop sign here are we now
i really dont
wanna talk about it
oh okay what do you want
to talk about
my career options
without a body of writing samples
because for your information
theyre kind of limited
it was in high school
its over
look does this have something
to do with michelle mancini
hey i just wanna know
whats going on here
because i dont know
if i buy it anymore
i dont know
if i ever bought it
its gonna be a wet one
out there tonight folks
the storm is expected to bring
four inches of rain
and 30mileperhour winds
throughout most of new england
local authorities are advising
everyone to please stay indoors
if you do decide to go out though
make sure you grab a slicker
natalie nothing is
gonna happen to me
but why do you keep doing this
to yourself
look at you
youve gotta stop this
i knew michelle mancini
we went to high school together
we hadnt spoken in
two years
why
we were in my car one night
michelle was driving
the story about the gang high beam
initiation had been going around
michelle wanted to play
a practical joke
so she turned the headlights off
and waited for the first car
to pass by and flash us
when someone finally did
she made a uturn and
started chasing him
flashing her high beams laughing
i was laughing too
at first
then we started going really fast
i wanted to tell her to stop
but i just sat there
and then the other car
lost control and ran off the road
he was our age
by the time the ambulance came
he was already dead
the courts were lenient with us
we just got probation
i was never able to forgive her
for what she did
i guess i couldnt forgive myself
for not doing something more to stop it
oh my god
how awful
for everyone
i dont know
i think i should just go home
come on you need to be relaxed
have some fun and come to the party
please
promise you wont leave me alone
i promise
unless of course i hook up with
some cute little blueeyed journalist
then you might have
to fend for yourself
dont do that
sorry
little jumpy
no not at all
i was just thinking
me too
it wouldnt be a bad idea to add a few
extra guards this weekend just in case
in case what
well after that suicide and
what happened to the mancini girl
now im having trouble locating another
student a boy named damon brooks
hes been missing
for some days now
missing hes not missing
its the weekend
hes probably shacked up
in some motel
with a girl or a guy
or a farm animal
whatever
werent you ever 18
not that kind of 18
my point is
i dont want you overreacting
dont contact anyone
without my permission
no parents no police
is that understood
understood
good night sir
go come on boy
there you go
there you go
thats my boy
i love you
hey listen
that scream
thats an actual cry for help
by a girl being murdered
youre kidding me
no
thats why it sounds so real
because it was lifted
off a 911 tape
thats great
yeah
hey you made it
and already
im starting to regret it
im gonna get something to drink
you want anything
a beer
okay be right back
stanley halls not a legend
there was one survivor that night
it makes perfect sense
pendleton covered up
stanley hall
and wexler so long as
he keeps his mouth shut
he gets a job for life
why would he do it
it eats at him
and probably every year around
this time he goes a little wacko
this year off the charts
well then we have to call the police
right away before it happens again
i already tried
dean adams beat me to it
they said he warned them
to expect some prank calls tonight
he even gave them our names
look
im sorry i doubted you before
what
hey
what is he trying to do to me
im so scared
hey
listen to me
nothings gonna happen
to you okay
i promise
you dont waste any time do you
here its light
oh shit
what was all that about
i screwed up
jesus you trying to give me
a heart attack here
the buildings offlimits
after 1000
good night to you too
hello

look you might wanna
end this party a little early
what
natalie was right all along
say no more
everybody listen up
no listen
turn the music down
listen everybody
paul here he thinks
we should end the party
no
tell everybody
why they should go home
theres a killer on campus
and let me guess
this killer is offing people
based on urban legends
yeah thats right
well ive got a legend
that you may or may not have heard of
this mediocre woodward and bernstein
wannabe realized
im gonna graduate in a couple of weeks
and end up writing gardening tips
for martha stewarts living
hang on
unless i get a really hot story
something that really flies
i got it
ill take advantage
of my homicidal instincts
and ill start killing people
in a trendy
attentiongetting coverstory
kind of way
basing them on urban legends
why dont you have another drink
maybe youre the one that should leave
and let everybody else have a good time
