tiii van dort s wedding rehearsai 
watch it 
 it s a beautiful day
 it s a rather nice day
a day for a glorious wedding
a rehearsal  my dear
to be perfectly clear
a rehearsal for a glorious wedding
assuming nothing happens
that we don t really know
that nothing unexpected
interferes with the show
and that s why everything
every last little thing
every single  tiny  microscopic little thing
must go
 according to plan
 our son will be married
 according to plan
 our family carried
elevated to the heights of society
 to the costume balls
 in the hallowed halls
rubbing elbows with the finest
having crumpets with her highness
we ll be there  we ll be seen
having tea with the queen
we ll forget everything
that we ve ever  ever been
 biimey  it s my dress is caught 
 begging your pardon  ma am 
 come on  dear 
 it s not me  it s my dress is caught 
where is victor  we might be iate 
fish merchants 
 it s a terrible day
 now  don t be that way
it s a terrible day for a wedding
it s a sad  sad state of affairs we re in
that has led to this ominous wedding
how could our family have come to this 
to marry off our daughter
to the nouveau riche
 they re so common
 so coarse
 oh  it couldn t be worse
 couldn t be worse  i m afraid i disagree
they could be land rich 
bankrupt aristocracy
without a penny to their name
just like you and me
oh  dear 
and that s why everything
every last little thing
every single  tiny  microscopic little thing
must go
 according to plan
 our daughter will wed
 according to plan
 our family led
from the depths of deepest poverty
 to the noble realm
 of our ancestry
and who would have guessed
in a million years
 that our daughter with a face
 of an otter in disgrace
would provide our ticket
to a rightful place
oh  hiidegarde 
what if victor and i
don t iike each other 
as if that has anything
to do with marriage 
do you suppose your father and i
iike each other 
sureiy you must a iittie 
 of course not 
 of course not 
get those corsets iaced properiy 
i can hear you speak without gasping 
you ve certainiy hooked a winner
this time  victor 
 now  aii you have to do is reei her in 
 i m aiready reeiing  mother 
shouidn t victoria evergiot
be marrying a iord or something 
oh  nonsense  we re every bit
as good as the evergiots 
i aiways knew i deserved better
than a fish merchant s iife 
but i ve never even spoken to her 
weii  at ieast we have that
in our favor 
mayhew  siience that biasted coughing 
marriage is a partnership 
a iittie tit for tat 
you d think a iifetime watching us    
might have taught her that
 might have taught her that
 everything must be perfect
 everything must be perfect
 everything must be perfect
perfect
that s why everything
every last little thing
every single  tiny  microscopic little thing
must go
according to plan
look at the way you re standing 
you iook iike you got rickets
or something

newiyweds 
in the woods

wake up  wake up  wake up 
coming through  coming through 
my name is paui  i am the head waiter 
i wiii be creating your wedding feast 
wedding feast  i m saiivating 
maggots

i ve got a  
i ve got a dwarf 
and i m not afraid to use him 
i want some questions  now 
 answers  i think you mean   answers   
 thank you  yes  answers 
i need answers 
what s going on here  where am i 
who are you 
weii  that s kind of a iong story 
what a story it is 
a tragic taie of romance  passion   
   and murder most foui 
this is gonna be good 
hit it  boys 
hey  give me a listen
you corpses of cheer
at least those of you
who still got an ear
i ll tell you a story
make a skeleton cry
of our own jubiliciously
lovely corpse bride
die  die  we all pass away
but don t wear a frown
because it s really okay
you might try and hide
and you might try and pray
but we all end up
the remains of the day
that s right 
well  our girl was a beauty
known for miles around
when a mysterious stranger
came into town
he was plenty good looking
but down on his cash
and our poor little baby
she fell hard and fast
when her daddy said no
she just couldn t cope
so our lovers came up
with a plan to elope
die  die  we all pass away
but don t wear a frown
because it s really okay
you might try and hide
and you might try and pray
but we all end up
the remains of the day
that s right 
okay  oh  yeah 
come on  boys  pick it up 
yeah  like it 
okay  chancy  take it 
yeah 
yeah 
that s nice 
so they conjured up a plan
to meet late at night
they told not a soul
kept the whole thing tight
now  her mother s wedding dress
fit like a glove
you don t need much
when you re really in love
except for a few things
or so i m told
like the family jewels
and a satchel of gold
then next to the graveyard
by the old oak tree
on a dark foggy night
at a quarter to 3
she was ready to go
but where was he 
and then 
 she waited
 and then 
 there in the shadows  was it her man 
 and then 
 her little heart beat so loud
 and then 
and then  baby  everything went black
now  when she opened her eyes
she was dead as dust
her jewels were missing
and her heart was bust
so she made a vow
lying under that tree
that she d wait for her true love
to come set her free
always waiting for someone
to ask for her hand
then out of the blue
comes this groovy young man
who vows forever
to be by her side
and that s the story
of our corpse bride
die  die  we all pass away
but don t wear a frown 
because it s really okay
you might try and hide
and you might try and pray
but we all end up
the remains of the day
yeah 
victoria  come away from the window 
oh  i m sure he ii be back shortiy 
he s terrified of the dark 
in fact  when he was a boy   
   he used to wet his combinations
reguiariy  didn t he  wiiiiam

you ve got a wonderfui personaiity 
what does that wispy little brat have
that you don t have double 
she can t hold a candle
to the beauty of your smile
how about a puise 
overrated by a mile
 overvalued
 overblown
if he only knew
the you that we know
and that silly little creature
isn t wearing his ring
and she doesn t play piano
or dance  or sing
no  she doesn t compare
 but she still breathes air
 who cares 
 unimportant
 overrated
 overblown
 if only he could see
how special you can be
if he only knew
the you that we know
if i touch a burning candle
i can feel no pain
if you cut me with a knife
it s still the same
and i know her heart is beating
and i know that i am dead
yet the pain here that i feel
try and tell me it s not real
and it seems that i still have
a tear to shed
the sole redeeming feature
from that little creature
is that she s alive
 overrated
 overblown
everybody knows
that s just a temporary state
which is cured very quickly
when we meet our fate
 who cares 
 unimportant
 overrated
 overblown
if only he could see
how special you can be
if he only knew
the you that we know
if i touch a burning candle
i can feel no pain
in the ice or in the sun
it s all the same
yet i feel my heart is aching
though it doesn t beat  it s breaking
and the pain here that i feel
try and tell me it s not real
i know that i am dead
yet it seems that i still have
some tears to shed
it s true  mother
