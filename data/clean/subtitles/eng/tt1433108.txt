do you know what hell is 
it s not fire and devils 
all that stuff they taught you
when you was little 
we make our heaven
and our hell while we re alive 
every time we cause pain 
every time we cause suffering 
cicero 
hey  it s me  did i wake you up 
no 
you said on your message
to give you a call  so   
okay  here s the deal 
both of our victims
were informants 
could be something there  right 
  yeah  could be 
nice work 
okay  i need you to follow up on it 
i gotta be in court 
but i really think we re getting close 
it s gotta have something to do
with how they got set up 
did you hear about that stabbing
in henderson 
yeah  yeah  what about it 
i got a hunch it might be our guy 
it s not his m o 
our guy s a shooter 
not a stabber 
like i said  i got a hunch 
yeah  so did quasimodo 
look where it got him 
i m gonna go ask a few questions 
after you do the follow up  right 
got it cleared with the henderson ic 
i m headed up there now 
i have to be in court all day 
i am asking you to do this 
it s my case 
  bring us nothing
but the same politics as usual 
i have fought
to keep government honest 
save you money
and to lower your taxes 
above all 
i will be someone who listens to you 
the choice is simple 
vote margie pageant 
in local news  a henderson man
is fighting for his life
after being brutally attacked
at a gentlemen s club 
the man is suffering
from stab wounds 
doctors describe his condition
as critical 
hello 
  sponge 
  sponge 
we think he ll be heading back 
your position 
tehachapi 
try the hospital in clark county 
his third victim survived the hit 
he ll be wanting to finish the job 
where are you 
good night 
doctor 
what the hell is that 
back in the room  back in the room 
police officer  get back 
police 
  he went that way 
i m a cop  where d he go 
he went downstairs  officer 
how do you have my dad s phone 
he asked me to call you 
are you the one who killed him 
yes 
i m gonna find you
and i m gonna kill you 
do what you need to do 
but you better be sure 
because it s a long  dark road
you re headed down 
i lost him 
client wants to pull the job 
no  no way 
you tell him to back off 
i ve got this under control  all right 
you re running out of time 
where s the old man 
dead 
don t lie to me 
i ll show you the damn grave 
how long ago 
i don t know 
three or four years 
hold still 
okay 
how long you been out 
couple of days 
and why are you here 
came here to kill the old man 
why 
because he set us up 
what makes you think that 
gary went to him for advice
on the bank job
and he wanted full share 
gary wouldn t give it to him 
so do you think
the old man was capable
of murdering his own son 
yeah 
no 
mm mm 
nope 
he couldn t have 
what makes you so sure 
i just    i just know 
tell me 
say it 
mom 
because   
he loved your brother too much 
i m sorry 
and that s the truth
and that s not your fault 
it wasn t like
i could pretend you were his 
he was reminded of that
every time he looked at you 
you never stood a chance 
sorry that i couldn t   
that i didn t protect you 
the beatings and   
gary was the only one
who ever cared for me 
why d he pull you in on that job 
you were never a part
of what they did 
when his driver fell out 
i volunteered 
why 
he owed the wrong people
a lot of money 
and he needed me 
if it wasn t the old man 
then who set us up 
driven by his passions and desires 
you will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive 
hate is like a chain
around your neck
that leads you to places
you don t wanna go 
it ll lead you into darkness
and desolation 
you become a slave
to that hatred 
and it ll only lead
to your own destruction 
you must break free 
hey  cowboy 
you okay  man 
  yeah 
  you laid eyes on him at least 
hey  well done 
thanks  man 
i gotta call you back 
  still in one piece 
  good job 
good lead  cowboy 
you almost got him 
we got close 
yeah 
it was a good hunch 
well  even quasimodo
has his day 
and don t ever hang up on me again 
roger that 
i hate to spoil your moment 
got something i wanna show you 
i think we may have caught a break 
you said  we  again 
i did 
our latest victim was a cl too 
so all three are informants 
mm hm  all got records 
armed robbery  rape  assault 
but none did any serious time 
they all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over 
what are the odds of that 
slim and none 
i m waiting on
the informant logs now 
who are these 
former accomplices of the victims 
let s split them up  check them out 
i ll take these 
and i know there s not a man 
woman or child in this church today
that has not sinned 
but god did not bring you down
on this earth to be perfect  no 
god wants you down here
to be saved 
and when you re down with god 
god is eternally down with you 
when jesus knew his time was near 
when he knew he was gonna die 
when he knew they would not take
that cup from his lips 
his thoughts were not
upon his own 
his thoughts were for those
that he loved 
  amen 
  that s right 
his thoughts were for those
that he loved  preparing them 
why is that 
he used the example of his birth 
that s right  here it is 
jesus told them how a woman
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth 
but then as soon
as she has delivered 
there is no more anguish 
after all the screaming 
after all the pushing 
after all the blood and the tears 
there s only joy that a new child
has been born 
hallelujah 
and i ll tell you my  
  amen  amen 
amen 
amen  amen  amen 
hallelujah 
amen 
amen 
sing me a song 
i was wondering
when you were gonna show up 
you ve been the subject
of many of my sermons
these past few days 
i heard 
you heard 
but did you listen 
everything okay 
baby 
everything s just fine 
honey 
i was just catching up with
an old acquaintance 
you go on home now 
let s take a walk 
was that your son 
adopted 
one of five 
wayward boys 
not unlike me or you
at that age 
you turned your life around 
doesn t change
what you did 
i wouldn t want it to 
i know it sounds cold 
but every good i ve done
hinged on the evil i did 
who set us up 
i don t know 
i never did find out
how they knew about
your safe house 
when i got the call 
 easy money   they said 
all i had to do
was guard the door 
be the lookout
