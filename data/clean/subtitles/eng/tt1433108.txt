honey
were going to hell for what we did
do you know what hell is
its not fire and devils
all that stuff they taught you
when you was little
we make our heaven
and our hell while were alive
every time we cause pain
every time we cause suffering
cicero

okay heres the deal
both of our victims
were informants
could be something there right
yeah could be
nice work
okay i need you to follow up on it
i gotta be in court
but i really think were getting close
its gotta have something to do
with how they got set up
did you hear about that stabbing
in henderson
yeah yeah what about it
i got a hunch it might be our guy
its not his mo
our guys a shooter
not a stabber
like i said i got a hunch
yeah so did quasimodo
look where it got him
im gonna go ask a few questions
after you do the followup right
got it cleared with the henderson ic
im headed up there now
i have to be in court all day
i am asking you to do this
its my case
bring us nothing
but the same politics as usual
i have fought
to keep government honest
save you money
and to lower your taxes
above all
i will be someone who listens to you
the choice is simple
vote margie pageant
in local news a henderson man
is fighting for his life
after being brutally attacked
at a gentlemens club
the man is suffering
from stab wounds
doctors describe his condition
as critical
hello
sponge
sponge
we think hell be heading back
your position
tehachapi
try the hospital in clark county
his third victim survived the hit
hell be wanting to finish the job
where are you
good night
doctor
what the hell is that
back in the room back in the room
police officer get back
police
he went that way
im a cop whered he go
he went downstairs officer
how do you have my dads phone
he asked me to call you
are you the one who killed him
yes
im gonna find you
and im gonna kill you
do what you need to do
but you better be sure
because its a long dark road
youre headed down
i lost him
client wants to pull the job
no no way
you tell him to back off
ive got this under control all right
youre running out of time
wheres the old man
dead
dont lie to me
ill show you the damn grave
how long ago
i dont know
three or four years
hold still
okay
how long you been out
couple of days
and why are you here
came here to kill the old man
why
because he set us up
what makes you think that
gary went to him for advice
on the bank job
and he wanted full share
gary wouldnt give it to him
so do you think
the old man was capable
of murdering his own son
yeah
no
mmmm
nope
he couldnt have
what makes you so sure
i just i just know
tell me
say it
mom
because
he loved your brother too much
im sorry
and thats the truth
and thats not your fault
it wasnt like
i could pretend you were his
he was reminded of that
every time he looked at you
you never stood a chance
sorry that i couldnt
that i didnt protect you
the beatings and
gary was the only one
who ever cared for me
whyd he pull you in on that job
you were never a part
of what they did
when his driver fell out
i volunteered
why
he owed the wrong people
a lot of money
and he needed me
if it wasnt the old man
then who set us up
driven by his passions and desires
you will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive
hate is like a chain
around your neck
that leads you to places
you dont wanna go
itll lead you into darkness
and desolation
you become a slave
to that hatred
and itll only lead
to your own destruction
you must break free
hey cowboy
you okay man
yeah
you laid eyes on him at least
hey well done
thanks man
i gotta call you back
still in one piece
good job
good lead cowboy
you almost got him
we got close
yeah
it was a good hunch
well even quasimodo
has his day
and dont ever hang up on me again
roger that
i hate to spoil your moment
got something i wanna show you
i think we may have caught a break
you said we again
i did
our latest victim was a cl too
so all three are informants
mmhm all got records
armed robbery rape assault
but none did any serious time
they all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over
what are the odds of that
slim and none
im waiting on
the informant logs now
who are these
former accomplices of the victims
lets split them up check them out
ill take these
and i know theres not a man
woman or child in this church today
that has not sinned
but god did not bring you down
on this earth to be perfect no
god wants you down here
to be saved
and when youre down with god
god is eternally down with you
when jesus knew his time was near
when he knew he was gonna die
when he knew they would not take
that cup from his lips
his thoughts were not
upon his own
his thoughts were for those
that he loved
amen
thats right
his thoughts were for those
that he loved preparing them
why is that
he used the example of his birth
thats right here it is
jesus told them how a woman
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth
but then as soon
as she has delivered
there is no more anguish
after all the screaming
after all the pushing
after all the blood and the tears
theres only joy that a new child
has been born
hallelujah
and ill tell you my
amen amen
amen
amen amen amen
hallelujah
amen
amen
sing me a song
i was wondering
when you were gonna show up
youve been the subject
of many of my sermons
these past few days
i heard
you heard
but did you listen
everything okay
baby
everythings just fine
honey
i was just catching up with
an old acquaintance
you go on home now
lets take a walk
was that your son
adopted
one of five
wayward boys
not unlike me or you
at that age
you turned your life around
doesnt change
what you did
i wouldnt want it to
i know it sounds cold
but every good ive done
hinged on the evil i did
who set us up
i dont know
i never did find out
how they knew about
your safe house
when i got the call
easy money they said
all i had to do
was guard the door
be the lookout
i was in a dark place
in my life
numb to the chaos and
right here
but when they cut
that boys throat
oh jesus man no
that boy they killed was my brother
i cant bring him back
and in my heart im sorry
i still took my cut
spent it on drugs and women
ended up in prison
but it was there
that i found my calling
to save and help boys like me
and like you
it was there
that i gave my life to god
god cant save you from me
but maybe he could save you
from yourself
i know theres good
you dont know me
i know the devil
got your heart twisted
with vengeance and hate
the lord is merciful
he sees in your soul
fragile aint it
that moment that sets us
on our road to damascus
sermons over
can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what i did
i cant
thats all right
thats all right
because i forgive you
for what youre about to do
lord see into this mans heart
hes good inside
oh lord save this mans soul
i know you see his heart
release him from the bondage
of hatred and vengeance lord
go back to your family
thats one hell of a peashooter
you got there
hows the recoil
yeah
where are you
inyo county at the reservoir
theyre here both of them
what did you call for backup
theres no time for that
okay dont do this
im sorry
i keep stepping on your case
i dont care about that
want you to do me a favor
if i dont make it out of this
tell my son that
his daddy went out like a man
i am on my way

i figured that out when
he didnt finish me off
at the hospital
his brothers girlfriend
