is singing a tune
daffy down dillies awaken
and prune
bursting in bloom
all the flowers assume
it s a loverly  loverly spring
chit chattery chipmunks
all singing along
humming their
join in a spring along song
spring is the springiest time
for a song
it s a loverly  loverly spring
in the forest we play
with the rabbits all day  
i m sorry to say that this is not
the movie you will be watching 
the movie you are about to see
is extremely unpleasant 
if you wish to see a film
about a happy little elf 
i m sure there is still plenty
of seating in theater number two 
however  if you like stories
about clever
and reasonably attractive orphans 
suspicious fires 
carnivorous leeches 
italian food
and secret organizations 
then stay
as i retrace each and every one
of the baudelaire children s
woeful steps 
my name is lemony snicket 
and it is my sad duty
to document this tale 
violet baudelaire  the eldest 
was one of the finest 14 year old
inventors in the world 
anyone who knew violet well could
tell she was inventing something
when her long hair was tied up
in a ribbon 
in a world of abandoned items
and discarded materials 
violet knew there
was always something 
something she could fashion
into nearly any device
for nearly every occasion 
and no one was better
to test her inventions
than her brother 
klaus baudelaire  the middle child 
loved books 
or  rather  the things he learned
from books 
the baudelaire parents had
an enormous library in their mansion 
a room filled with thousands
of books on nearly every subject 
and nothing pleased klaus more
than spending an afternoon filling up
his head with their contents 
and everything he read
he remembered 
sunny  the youngest 
had a different interest 
she liked to bite things
and had four sharp teeth 
there was very little that sunny
did not enjoy biting 
sunny was at an age when one
mostly speaks
in a series of unintelligible shrieks 
for instance 
which probably meant 
  look at that mysterious figure
emerging from the fog    
or perhaps 
  what is a banker like mr  poe doing
trudging thorough the sand
to find us at briny beach   
children 
i m afraid i must inform you
of an extremely unfortunate event 
i m very  very sorry to tell you this 
but your parents have perished in a fire
that s destroyed your entire home 
if you have ever lost someone
very important to you 
then you already know how it feels 
and if you haven t 
you cannot possibly imagine it 
no one knows the precise cause
of the baudelaire fire 
my colleagues and i
have investigated the best we can 
but all we ve discovered
is that the blaze
was started from a great distance
through the refraction
and convergence of light 
and within moments 
the entire mansion was in flames 
and as mysterious as the source
of the blaze 
other mysteries began to unfold
before the children s eyes 
every family has its secrets 
doors left unopened 
but as klaus now realized 
the smallest discovery would send
his mind reeling with questions 
what was this spyglass hidden
in his father s desk 
were there other secrets about their
parents  lives yet to be revealed 
questions he now feared
might never be answered 
and just like that 
the baudelaire children
became the baudelaire orphans 
i tried to warn you 
this is an excellent opportunity
to walk out of the theater 
iiving room or airplane
where this film is being shown 
it s not too late to see a film
about a happy little elf 
yes  come with me 
now  as chief officer
of mulctuary management
and the executor of
your parents  estate 
it is my legal obligation to take care
of your money till you come of age
and to place you in the care
of your closest relative 
so i m taking you to live
with your dear count olaf 
who resides right here in the city 
just 37 blocks away 
i don t think that s what   closest  
is supposed to mean 
we don t know a count olaf 
yes  yes  of course you do 
he s either your third cousin
four times removed
or your fourth cousin
three times removed 
and he s an actor by trade 
isn t that exciting  children 
you should count yourselves
lucky  children 
this sort of generosity is rare
in a person of his profession 
here we are  your new home 
isn t it lovely  children 
oh  hello 
you must be the baudelaires 
hi 
i was so sorry to hear
about the accident 
but so happy to hear
you were coming here 
welcome  i m justice strauss
of the city high court 
i m violet  and this is my brother 
klaus  and my sister  sunny 
poe  mulctuary management 
how do you do 
lovely 
your house is so beautiful 
thank you 
please don t be strangers 
you come visit me anytime you like 
  visit 
  you mean 
you don t live with count olaf 
live with    with count olaf  no 
no  no  no  no  he s  
he s my neighbor 
entrood 
haven t got all day  in you go 
well  hello  hello  hello 
i am your beloved count olaf 
and welcome to my loverly home 
may you find solace within
the womblike warmth of its     
     downy plume 
or as the greeks
in the ancient times would say 
orphanis     
     encribo     
     something  something  something 
music builds to a crescendo
ending on the right foot
and strike a fosse 
not exactly what i was going for 
but you get the idea 
my dear     
     violet 
enchant√© 
how do you do 
and this must be klaus 
young klaus 
your left side is the good one 
and     
     what is this 
i m sorry  i don t speak monkey 
banana 
sunny s our sister 
i must say  you re a gloomy looking
bunch  why so glum 
our parents just died 
oh  yes  of course 
how very  very awful 
wait  let me do that one more time 
give me the line again 
quickly  while it s fresh in my mind 
our parents just     
     died 
oh  yes 
mr  poe     
     i will raise these orphans
as if they were actually wanted 
and though you would call it
a burden  a sacrifice 
you are mistaken  sir 
and should be ashamed of yourself 
the idea 
anyway  where do i sign
for the fortu    i mean     
     children 
you won t officially have guardianship
until the hearing on thursday morning 
and what am i to do with them
until then 
excuse me 
what i mean is     
do you work out  you look good 
healthy  i mean 
well  i d better get back to the bank 
can t you stay for a brief imbibement 
a glass of port  sanka 
  well  i suppose i could  
  another time  then 
children  if you need anything 
do feel free  
oh  no  we re fine  we re all fine 
any questions be  
i realize that my humble abode
isn t as fancy
as the baudelaire mansion 
but i m coming into a great deal
of money soon 
and i think it ll be
quite charming when it s finished 
shall we take a look 
this is the living room 
the kitchen 
i know what you re thinking 
  this place could use a little tlc   
i trust you ve had your tetanus shots 
polio  smallpox  typhoid  malaria 
this is the entertainment
or rumpus room 
i m told the ceiling can be brought
up to code in no time 
you re not afraid of heights  are you 
imagine that 
a monkey afraid of heights 
my theater 
this way 
what s that up there 
the tower     
     which you are never to enter     
     under any circumstances 
and this is where you ll sleep 
time permitting  nighty night 
  but the sun s still up 
    but the sun s still up   
i don t know
if you ve ever noticed this 
but first impressions
are often entirely wrong 
for instance  klaus  when sunny
was born  didn t like her at all 
but by the time she was six weeks old 
the two of them were thick as thieves 
a phrase which here means 
  fetching and biting for hours on end    
in the case of count olaf  however     
orphans 
      they were correct 
every morning  count olaf
would order the baudelaires
to do a great number
of terrible chores 
after which he would stalk off
to his mysterious tower room 
and as unfortunate
as their situation seemed 
it was only about to get worse 
  tub full of ice in baja 
and i realized that these clever girls
had stolen my kidney 
  no 
  no 
imagine my surprise 
orphans  this is my acting troupe 
acting troupe  orphans 
they don t look rich 
ugly little people 
why aren t you children in the kitchen
preparing our dinner 
dinner 
it s the french word
for the evening meal 
on the back  flip it 
we ll take it in the dining room
at 8 00 
and we ll expect absolute silence
while we re rehearsing our play 
  but we ve never made dinner before 
  it s already 7 30 
eight o clock 
pasta it is 
okay  let s start casting this puppy 
now 
who shall play
the most handsome count
in all the world 
would you do it  sir 
oh  all right 
  pasta puttanesca    that s ltalian
for   very few ingredients    you know 
that s great 
sunny  little help 
  okay  we re gonna need a pot 
  no pot 
  and a strainer 
  no strainer 
thank you 
and a saucepan 
this is a little piece i like to call
  electric chair   
i think you might have to turn it up 
is anybody out there  
strainer  that s brilliant 
sunny  how s that pot coming 
sunny  that s not a pot 
it s a spittoon 
a spittoon  you mean  like      
we ll wash it twice 
well 
it s good  it s really good 
time check 
let s go back to prehistoric times 
when dinosaurs ruled the earth 
baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk 
baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk 
what do you want 
dinner is served 
puttanesca 
what did you call me 
it s pasta  pasta puttanesca 
where s the roast beef 
roast beef 
beef  yes  roast beef 
it s the swedish term for beef
that is roasted 
but you didn t tell us
you wanted roast beef 
you know  there s a big world out there
filled with desperate orphans
who would gladly swim across
an ocean of thumbtacks
just to be eclipsed by the long shadow
that is cast by my accomplishments 
but i don t care about them 
i chose to open my heart
to you two loverly children
and your hideous primate 
all i ask in return is that you do each
and every thing that pops into my head
while i enjoy the enormous fortune
your parents left behind 
  no 
  why  you litt  
it s time you children learned
a little respect 
you put her down 
you monster 
you all saw it  the boy slipped 
you won t get a cent
until violet turns 18 
oh  really 
says who 
the law  look it up 
we re going to call mr  poe
about this right now 
are you 
i m very disappointed
in you  children 
where were we 
are you okay 
no 
klaus  what are you doing 
  i m going 
  going where 
home 
this is our home now 
this is not home 
home is where your parents
put you to bed at night 
where they teach you to ride a bike 
or where they get all choked up
on your first day of school 
this is not home 
how could they do this to us 
they re just bad people 
not them  mom and dad 
  klaus 
  what 
violet  you re thinking it too 
how could they 
they had no plan for us at all 
well  maybe they did have a plan 
well  sure looks like it to me 
do you remember
when mom and dad went to europe 
and we thought they d abandoned us
because they didn t even write 
then we found out they d written
a long letter 
it had just gotten lost in the mail 
do you remember how guilty we felt
for thinking bad thoughts about them 
this is just like that 
no  it s not 
why 
because they re not in europe 
they re not coming back 
do you think anything
will ever feel like home again 
  sanctuary  
is a word which here means    a small 
safe place in a troubling world    
like an oasis in a vast desert
or an island in a stormy sea 
the baudelaires enjoyed their evening
in the sanctuary they d built together 
i see it  i see it 
but in their hearts they knew that
the troubling world lay just outside 
a world which  i m sad to say 
can be described in two dismal words 
custody granted 
thank you  your honor 
nice doing business with you 
children  i ve been contemplating
our situation 
and i realize that i ve been
a bit standoffish  shall we say 
which in this case is a big 
big word meaning  
pure evil 
  tough  but fair 
but now that we re family 
i can make it up to you 
i can be the ultimate dad 
i know  let s stop for a treat 
soda  soda  banana 
got it 
violet  where d the locks go 
hello  i m going on a perfectly
innocent ride in the country
with my kids  whom i love 
is that clock correct 
what is it 
i think it s a schedule 
kiwi watermelon surprise  my favorite 
go 
  he took the keys 
  try everything 
chit chattery chipmunks all singing  
count olaf  hello  poe 
i m calling you back about
that inheritance question you raised 
  mr  poe  thank goodness 
  who is this 
it s violet baudelaire 
we re in count olaf s car 
oh  hello  violet 
well  where s count olaf 
he s not here right now  but  
you re driving the car alone 
no  we re   the car s on the train
tracks  and the train is coming 
i m sorry  violet  i can t hear a thing 
i m driving next to a train 
we re going to be hit by a train 
right  yes  i can t hear
because of the train 
i ll call you back when i get
to the bank  goodbye 
klaus  you ve read books on trains 
what do we do 
the track switcher 
there 
it s too far away 
no  there has to be something
we can use to pull it 
  there s nothing in here 
  there s always something 
sunny  bite the head off that elf 
quick  pull it back in 
  violet 
  i got it 
i don t mean to rush you 
  nice shot 
  thank you  pull 
mr  poe  dear mr  poe  can t we
discuss this like reasonable men 
i m sorry  count olaf 
allowing a child of sunny s age
to drive a car
is simply not good parenting 
he tried to kill us 
let us not exaggerate  klaus 
the vehicle was not even in gear 
may i have a moment
alone with the children 
goodbye  kids 
it s been fun 
i m going to get you 
no matter where you go 
no matter what you do  i ll find you 
you are so deceased 
take them  mr  poe     
     before i lose it  bigtime 
trumping a talentless villain
might seem all in a day s work
for three ingenious orphans 
but the baudelaires
savored their victory
as they sped
towards their new home 
what lay ahead for them
was unclear 
but they remained
cautiously optimistic
that their next guardian would be
better than the last 
or at least wouldn t try
to flatten them with a train 
do you know
what kind of scientist he is 
no  i don t  i was far too busy
making arrangements for you three 
i didn t have time for chitchat 
hello 
oh  my goodness 
look at you  you must be violet 
do you remember me 
i don t suppose so 
you were just a little baby
at the time 
and  klaus  we ve never met 
how do you d   
what a firm grip 
like a burmese python 
and sunny  little sunny  you look
so much like your dear mother 
thank you very much  mr  poe 
i ll take it from here 
oh  perhaps i should come inside 
oh  by all means 
you could help us pick out
the gut worms
from the bowel of the viscid boa 
children  remember 
if you need me anytime 
you can reach me by phone or fax 
good day 
well  we got rid of him  didn t we 
come in  come in  there s not
much time  and we have to pack 
pack 
did you say   pack   
oh  yes  we have to pack
all the equipment 
then there s the essentials 
like clothing and such 
and we have to tag all of the snakes
who are coming with us 
coming where 
oh  did i mention we re going
to peru 
  no 
  yes  we re going to peru 
tomorrow morning 
isn t that exciting 
this way to the reptile room 
welcome to my humble abode 
you children know anything
about snakes 
only what i ve read in books 
no  not very much 
well  we may have one or two things
here that aren t in books 
i ll just put the big fellow in his bed and
introduce you to a few of me friends 
over here     
that s the two headed cobra 
well spotted 
is that a he or a she 
i have no idea 
didn t think it polite to ask 
and over here 
the tibetan third eye toad 
we can t stop this fellow chanting 
om  ribbit 
and now  children  you have
to see my latest discovery 
found him in tanzania  one of a kind 
the lncredibly deadly viper 
my assistant  gustav  and i may be
the only people ever to have seen him 
oh  i m sorry  my ribbon just jammed 
let me just adjust it here 
right 
there we are 
now 
where was i 
oh  yes  the attack
of the incredibly deadly viper 
not to worry  little one 
you re all right 
it can t possibly harm you 
here we go 
the lncredibly deadly viper
couldn t have possibly harmed her 
no  no  no  no  no 
it s a big softy 
one of the least harmful
and most friendly creatures
in the animal kingdom 
it s a misnomer 
i only called him that to play a prank
on those stuffed shirts
down at the herpetological society 
uncle monty 
why are we going to peru 
just this morning i was wondering 
  how are we all going to get
out of town together   
and i thought    peru   
they have snakes in peru  don t they 
but why are we getting out of town 
violet  do you know snakes are more
afraid of you than you are of them 
few people do 
when threatened 
a snake will retreat to a place
that is quiet  safe  remote 
a sanctuary 
where it can feel out of danger 
that s why peru 
wait  that spyglass 
i saw one just like that in our dad s  
plenty of time for chitchat later 
but right now  what i need
is an inventor 
a reader
and a biter 
know any 
high upon highlands
and low upon tay
bonnie george campbell
rode out on a day
saddled and bridled
so gallant rode he
home came his good horse
but never came he
petunia  what have i told you
about this 
she thinks i m a tree  you know 
i think i know that song  i think   i think
our parents used to play it for us 
they certainly did  as i did for mine 
  you had children 
  oh  yes 
and a wife and a home 
until the fire 
a fire 
i may know better than anyone
what you re going through 
but it s gonna be all right 
we ll be among people who
understand us  people who are like us 
people who appreciate
unique children
who can read and invent
and bite things 
uncle monty  why are you doing
all this for us 
isn t that what family does 
  and so the baudelaire children
went to peru
and together had
wonderful adventures
with their loving
and wonderful new guardian 
the end    
these are the words
i desperately wish i could type 
oh  i would give anything
to say that the story ends here 
but alas  my mission is
not to weave happy endings
where they do not occur
but to report the actual events
in the lives of the unfortunate
baudelaire children 
and as much as it pains me 
i must confess that their troubles
had only just begun 
and it did so with two musical notes 
hello 
i am looking
for dr  montgomery montgomery 
i am stephano  i am an ltalian man 
and i am here to assist him
in his research as best i can 
as well as to facilitate
and remain observatory 
you re count olaf 
now  why would you say
something like that 
i have never met such a person
as a count olaf 
but if i had 
i m sure he would look and sound
completely different 
you re olaf 
and we re not letting you in 
well  perhaps you should re evaluate
your hypothesis 
anyway  that s why you should
never run with one of these  kids 
words of wisdom indeed 
mr  stephano 
oops  you caught me being
a mentor 
and bless you for coming
at such short notice 
not at all  not at all 
my chief assistant  gustav  took sick
and phoned not one hour ago 
he d give anything
to be here right now 
thank goodness you were available 
well  i am a fan  if i may gush 
your work has profoundly influenced
my research
up at the monterey bay aquarium     
     on the sea snake 
it s a very volatile animal 
  perhaps we should  
  i ve been bitten 43      700 times 
mostly on the face 
a lot of this has been reconstructed 
but i think they did one heck of a job 
even though my mustache
is a tad askew 
i wonder if i could get the kids
to help me in with my bags 
my left side is somewhat
neurologically challenged 
  but of course  children  
  uncle monty  
please  let us not be rude
to our guest 
now  go on 
what s he up to 
i don t know 
there is no good moment  of course 
for a notorious villain to arrive 
but the timing
of olaf s reappearance 
just when dr  montgomery s secret
could be revealed to the children 
was almost more
than klaus could bear 
violet  listen to me 
monty s spyglass  i saw
the exact same one in dad s desk 
  klaus  it s just a coincidence 
  violet  no 
everything happens for a reason 
now  the children will be helping us
extensively with the research in peru 
do you have experience
with children 
children are strange
and foreign to me 
i never really was one 
i know that they are
an important part of the ecosystem 
he s never gonna let us alone
with monty 
we ve gotta get a message to him 
leave that to me 
i was feeding the moray 
and of course  i got cocky 
and that s all it takes 
that s all it takes  is one time 
just once 
i had the kipper in my mouth 
and i offered it 
and there was a team from
national geographic that were there 
they were filming the whole thing 
and  well  a lot of people don t
know this about the moray 
but you think  you know    this can t be
a tremendously strong animal   
i mean  sure  it has a certain amount
of strength 
but how does it pull a man s face
into a cave 
anyway  long story short 
the bends 
a reconstructive surgery     
but yes  from my understanding 
peru is a wonderful place 
the beaches  the people 
the relaxed guardianship laws 
relaxed guardianship laws 
did i say that 
darn neurotoxins 
oh  stephano  you have
a wonderful gift for storytelling 
  doesn t he  children 
  oh  yeah 
i was wondering if you wouldn t mind
milking petunia for me 
petunia  well  the milking     
now  see  what i was  
could i just      
yeah  sure  i ll take a shot at that 
now  they used to call me old
macdonald up at the milking lab there 
because i d milk these things
all day long 
but the little udders
are hard to locate 
anyway  why don t you take that
and go ahead and start the party
without me  and then     
i m not sure i brought my milking gear 
i ll take a gander 
is he still watching 
yes 
don t look at me 
pretend you re talking to klaus 
okay 
i got your message 
don t worry  i know 
  you do 
  yes 
a moray eel would never eat kippers 
far too salty 
and did you see the way he kept
glancing into my satchel 
where i keep
the exotic snake venoms 
you children were right 
stephano is an imposter 
yes 
he s a spy from
the herpetological society 
he s here to steal
the lncredibly deadly viper 
  no 
  no  uncle monty  
darn  all finished  i was
so looking forward to the milking 
isn t it about time you kids
went to bed 
absolutely 
early start tomorrow  children 
off you go 
good night 
oh  and if you kids should get
restless during the night 
i m right down the hall 
and i m a very light sleeper 
in fact  i hardly sleep at all 
do you have a hall pass 
i didn t think so 
oh  petunia  i m going to miss you 
you re such a good girl  aren t you 
such a pretty girl 
you are  yes  you are 
oh  yes  you are 
it is a curious thing 
the death of a loved one 
uncle monty 
it s like walking up the stairs
to your bedroom in the dark
and thinking that there s
one more stair than there is 
your foot falls down through the air 
and there s a sickly moment
of dark surprise 
uncle monty 
the children s grief
was not only for their uncle
but for that tender hope that they
may have found home again 
a hope which  thanks to a villainous
actor  was now slowly tumbling away 
i do feel somewhat responsible
for this tragedy 
i should ve taken it upon myself
to warn him
that the lncredibly deadly viper
is the most deadly snake
in the entire ecosystem 
i should know  i discovered it 
you what 
detective 
little girl  the big cage door is open 
no snake  dead guy 
you know what i m thinking 
i m thinking    who woke me up
at 9 in the morning for this   
it s definitely a snake bite 
there s no question about it 
snake bite  no question about it 
thanks  doc 
you don t understand  the lncredibly
deadly viper couldn t have killed him 
because it s one of the least dangerous
and most friendly creatures
in the animal kingdom 
you mind if i skip the paperwork
on this 
i think that d be best  these kids
have been through a major upheaval 
i wonder if it s a good idea  even 
to change their plans at this point 
we were headed for peru tomorrow 
  and the tickets are nonrefundable 
  no 
doc  what do you think 
could be the only chance
for them to get closure 
closure  thank you  doc 
from interviews with witnesses
who were there that day 
i have learned the following about
the youngest baudelaire s plan 
brave sunny started here
and approached
the incredibly deadly viper
with single minded determination 
no  he s count olaf 
and that doctor is his accomplice 
he tried to kill us with a train 
  and where would this man get a train 
  where am i gonna get a train 
children  that s enough
of this foolishness 
mr  stephano bears absolutely
no resemblance to count olaf 
who is this incredibly handsome
count olaf they keep speaking of 
count olaf is their old guardian 
who made an error in judgment 
what about the tattoo  count olaf
had a tattoo of an eye on his ankle 
anything for the kids 
voil√†  spick and span 
well  he s an actor 
he covered it with makeup 
doctor  i wonder if you
could help me escort
  these young children to the vehicle 
  no  mr  poe  
  no  mr  poe 
  i ll send you a postcard 
about one thing 
all the witnesses agreed 
the sound they heard next
was so shocking  so surprising 
it still haunts them to this day 
damn it  this was
such a good character 
bum buttery  bluebird is singing a tune
rest assured  children  the authorities
are in hot pursuit of mr  stephano 
from his eyebrowless forehead
to his untattooed ankle 
the ltalian fiend 
though still in the clutches
of a clueless banker 
the baudelaires celebrated
their unmasking of count olaf
as they skimmed their way across
the icy surface of lake lachrymose 
but klaus wasn t the sort to think
on the surface of anything 
he knew there was something
beneath their journey 
even though all he had to go on
was a spyglass 
the knowledge of another terrible fire
and two words on a slip of paper 
aunt josephine 
never heard of her 
does it strike you as odd that none
of our relatives are related to us 
aunt josephine 
baudelaires  is that you 
yes 
oh  good 
come in  come in  come in 
hurricane herman
is about to arrive at any time now 
oh  violet  look at you 
hello 
come in  quickly  quickly  children 
  what  what 
  what s the matter 
not that quickly  you could trip
over the welcome mat
and decapitate yourselves 
so  quickly  but not too quickly 
all right 
i m sorry it s so chilly in here 
sometimes it gets so cold
i can hardly stand it 
would you like me to turn the radiator
up for you  aunt josephine 
oh  no  i never turn on the radiator 
i m frightened that it might explode 
children  i must ask you not to use
any of the doorknobs in the house 
just push on the wood of the door 
and it ll open 
why 
well  i m always afraid
that the doorknobs
will shatter into a million tiny pieces 
and one of them will hit my eye 
  delmo   is not a word 
i can see that i m going to have to
teach her proper english 
grammar is the greatest joy in life 
don t you find 
  most definitely 
  i love grammar 
perfect  nice hot soup 
actually  it s chilled cucumber soup 
i never cook anything hot 
i m afraid that the stove
will burst into flames 
where s your brother 
the kitchen 
klaus 
what are you doing 
napkins 
napkins are here  come away from
the fridge  if it falls  it ll crush you flat 
all right 
everyone  would you like
to see some pictures 
careful  don t get a paper cut 
is this lke 
wasn t he handsome 
all the things you did 
aunt josephine 
you tamed lions 
oh  i was quite adventurous
when lke was alive 
uncle monty 
you knew uncle monty 
no  that s not a good picture of me 
wait  is       is that our parents 
was this some sort of club 
why do you all have
these spyglasses 
i don t like the way i look
in that picture 
did lke die in a fire 
no  no  no  no  silly child  no 
he was eaten by leeches 
come  i ll show you 
watch the chandelier  children 
if it falls  it will impale you 
ike and i explored every cove and inlet
of lake lachrymose 
from horrid harbor 
all the way over to curdled cave 
way over there 
and near that rock is
where the leeches attacked 
lachrymose leeches have six rows
of very sharp teeth 
and one very sharp nose 
they are blind  but they can smell food
on a human from miles away 
and if they smell food 
they will swarm 
i told him    lke  you must wait one hour
before going into the water   
but     
     he only waited 45 minutes 
and     
i apologize  children 
klaus 
that area is private 
that was lke s room 
oh  god  i hate it here 
well  aunt josephine 
have you ever thought
of maybe moving someplace else 
maybe if you moved away from lake
lachrymose you might feel better 
i could never 
never  never  never sell this house 
i m terrified of realtors
