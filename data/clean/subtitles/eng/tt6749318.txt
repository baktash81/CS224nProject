i like this guy

drug sniffing dogs
once the dea got the scent
they were hard to shake
mr aronoff
stuart lopez dea
nice boat
id like to ask you
a few questions
office
ill see you there
look no surprise to you
mr aronoff
cigarette boats are a big hit
on the drugrunning circuit
lately we busted a lot of
smugglers driving your boats
my boats
i mean boats manufactured
by your company
ah yes
the problem is the
sales names are fiction
and the hull numbers
dont make any sense
we sell boats
theyre registered
reregistered
sold and resold
and by the way
the resale value
is through the fucking roof
do you record the hull numbers
associated with each purchase
now you know and i know
that its illegal
not to record those numbers so
where are you going with this
just doing our job
mr aronoff
you know catching bad guys
ok so do you go
to smith and wesson
every time you haul
someone in with a gun
look i make boats
fast boats
people want them they come
in here i take their id
they pay me money and boom
they are standing
in the cockpit of a speedboat
a very sexy speedboat
so what do you want me to do
to chase them down
and fingerprint them
wed put you on our
payroll if you did
thats good
