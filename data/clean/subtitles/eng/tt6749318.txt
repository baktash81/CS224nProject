it s a glorious day
here where a field of 51 racers stream
full speed ahead from
the starting line in miami

racing his way
to his usual position
at the front of the pack 
mr  aronoff 
tell us about that first

well if you really
want to win 
sometimes you have to take
a chance  let it all hang out 
as the kids say 
it s gotta be your bag 
as the leaders
approach nassau  it s bertram 
webb  and ben aronoff 
the racers make the turn to
clear the outside of the island
and oh  my  that s aronoff
placing a big bet 
risking it all on a shortcut
through the shore 
threading the needle
through the jagged rocks 
aronoff in the 0 0 7 
  aronoff 
  yes 
james bond himself
has taken the lead 
and no one s gonna
catch him now 
thank you

the woman has a tattoo
of elvis on both thighs 
and she s not convinced
that it looks like elvis

she finds a drunk 
and she lifts up her skirt 
and she says to the drunk
 do you recognize these guys  
and the drunk says   i don t

but the guy in the middle
is definitely willie nelson

he s gaga for those
powerboats of yours 
and those ads 
hey  robbie

but on your own 
new beginnings 
that s crap 
not wanting to be a bother

to do some things on your own 
you do that when it
comes to banging shiksas
and betting the ponies

swelled up  that s you

big things coming in 
aronoff s
revolutionary cigarette has taken
offshore powerboat
racing by storm 
at each stop on
the european circuit
the cigarette has burned
thru the record books
shattering every mark
for time and speed 
a fantastic 66 miles an hour 
13 miles an hour faster than
the record set three years ago 
boats are sex symbols  and
certainly the cigarette boat
is a sexy boat  but we
don t market it that way 
it s a man s boat  and
it s a dangerous machine 
and there s
ben aronoff speeding home
heading towards his seventh
victory this season 
one more  and he reclaims
the world championship 
my husband would like to
purchase two cigarette boats

mr  aronoff 
stuart lopez  dea 
nice boat 
i d like to ask you
a few questions 
office 
i ll see you there 
look  no surprise to you 
mr  aronoff 
cigarette boats are a big hit
on the drug running circuit 
lately  we busted a lot of
smugglers driving your boats 
my boats 
i mean  boats manufactured
by your company 
ah  yes 
the problem is the
sales names are fiction
and the hull numbers
don t make any sense 
we sell boats 
they re registered 
re registered 
sold and resold 
and by the way 
the resale value
is through the fucking roof 
do you record the hull numbers
associated with each purchase 
now you know  and i know 
that it s illegal
not to record those numbers  so
where are you going with this 
just doing our job 
mr  aronoff 
you know  catching bad guys 
ok  so do you go
to smith and wesson
every time you haul
someone in with a gun 
look  i make boats 
fast boats 
people want them  they come
in here  i take their id 
they pay me money and boom 
they are standing
in the cockpit of a speedboat 
a very sexy speedboat 
so what do you want me to do 
to chase them down
and fingerprint them 
we d put you on our
payroll if you did 
that s good 
  whoa  watch out

he said   people who
have a why to live
can bear almost anything  
what s your why  ben 
let me tell you something 
sometimes  it doesn t matter
who you are or what you have 
it s just too hard to say no 
do you have a plan   cause
you re in with a rough crowd 
you can help us 
and we can help you 
water s calmed down  we just
gotta stay in the boat 
hang on 
that s a risky bet 
i ve been winning with it
my whole life

arrest me  you have a nice day 
hey buddy  there he is 
secret rendezvous on the beach 
black 
i spoke to my buddy

have told me to take a hike
if the subpoena wasn t coming 
if it s typed  it s ripe 
you re getting served 
buddy o  tomorrow 
  that s actually great news 
  really  how s that 
once you get served 
they ll keep you safe 
the reemers  whoever 
they re not gonna touch you
once that happens 
they ll bring the feds
and the miami date p d 
dirty as they are 
no one wants that 
25 years of your giving
me high end advice
