we cannot just swim up
we can swim fast
no we cant
we can
we will get the bends
do you know what the bends is
its nitrogen bubbles in the brain
the only way to go up
is to ascend slowly
with a decompression stop
for five minutes
unprotected in open water
im so scared
were gonna die down here
we are not gonna die
i dont want to die down here kate
were not gonna die down here
