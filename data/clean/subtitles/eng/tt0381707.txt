you know why
because you are
falling asleep again marcus
well if it isnt ben and jerry
let me ask you guys a question
when the chief goes to the bathroom
which one of you guys holds his balls
and which one wipes
thats the ball holder there
yep you can tell by the cup in his hand
see that is exactly the attitude thats going
to keep you guys working the shit detail
while were working
the socialite kidnapping case
you guys got the socialite kidnapping case
thats right
whats that
oh l think l hear the chief flushing
wed better get going
whose turn is it to wipe yours
l think its your turn to wipe
and lll hold the balls
thats right
we received this from mr andrew wilson
ceo of wilson cruise lines
it was delivered to his home
the girls in the photo are his daughters
and heiresses to the wilson fortune
we believe
they are the kidnappers next victims
mr wilson has given us permission
to shadow his daughters
were going to set up surveillance
and if the kidnapper strikes
this time we will be ready
now the wilson sisters will be flying
into jfk this morning
so whos going to pick them up
obviously everyone has read
the profile on the girls
still somebodys got to do it
l dont think this is a good idea
l dont care we deserve to be on this case
just as much as gomez and harper
l know but we dont want
to interrupt the man in a briefing
well somebody got to stand up to him
chief
what
marcus has something he want to tell you
what
chief we just want to know
if we could get on the case
youre on
the boys over at lntel seem to think
that the kidnappers a guy
named ted burton
lt says burton was a partner of wilsons
and some other associates
in some business venture that failed
says he spent time in the federal pen
and lost his fortune
guys been mla since his release and those
dates coincide with the first kidnappings
