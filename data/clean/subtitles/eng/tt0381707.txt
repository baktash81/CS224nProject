you might want to make sure

wait a minute  lntelligence 
look around you  copeland

look  after work  me and kevin went
down to the bar and had a couple of drinks 
l know  l called the bar 
they said you left at 7 45 
l checked mapquest  lt only takes
six minutes to get there from here 
so  if you got somebody on the side 
you need to tell me 
baby  listen to what you just say 
mapquest said it takes six minutes
to get here  l got here in eight 
which means there s two minutes
unaccounted for 
lf l was cheating on you  don t you think
l d need more than two minutes 
you know what 
l ain t going to deal with this 
l m tired  okay 
l had a long day at work  l got shot at 
see  that is exactly what l m talking about 
we don t communicate 
 okay  fine  you want to communicate 
 yes 
come on  let s communicate  okay 
okay  let s start with last week 
last week 
you and l were supposed
to go shopping together  we get to the mall 
l buy this beautiful dress 
l get my hair done 
you don t say anything  l don t know 
maybe you just don t want to    
did you hear me just now 
tell me what l said 
l heard everything  you was communicating 
don t play with me right now 
l am not in the mood 
l cannot believe you came home late
and then you start    
marcus  you are falling asleep again 
l am talking to you 
l wasn t asleep  l was closing my eyes
and visualizing your words 
oh  really  visualizing 
why don t you paint me a picture
of what l just said 
 hold on 
 you know why 
because you are
falling asleep again  marcus 
well  if it isn t ben and jerry 
let me ask you guys a question 
when the chief goes to the bathroom 
which one of you guys holds his balls   
and which one wipes 
 that s the ball holder there 
 yep  you can tell by the cup in his hand 
see  that is exactly the attitude that s going
to keep you guys working the shit detail   
while we re working
the socialite kidnapping case 
you guys got the socialite kidnapping case 
that s right 
what s that 
oh  l think l hear the chief flushing 
we d better get going 
whose turn is it to wipe  yours 
l think it s your turn to wipe
and l ll hold the balls 
that s right 
we received this from mr  andrew wilson 
ceo of wilson cruise lines 
it was delivered to his home 
the girls in the photo are his daughters   
and heiresses to the wilson fortune 
we believe
they are the kidnapper s next victims 
mr  wilson has given us permission
to shadow his daughters 
we re going to set up surveillance   
and if the kidnapper strikes   
this time we will be ready 
now  the wilson sisters will be flying
into jfk this morning 
so who s going to pick them up 
obviously  everyone has read
the profile on the girls 
still  somebody s got to do it 
l don t think this is a good idea 
l don t care  we deserve to be on this case
just as much as gomez and harper 
l know  but we don t want
to interrupt the man in a briefing 
well  somebody got to stand up to him 
 chief 
 what 
 marcus has something he want to tell you 
 what 
chief  we just want to know
if we could get on the case 
you re on 
the boys over at lntel seem to think
that the kidnapper s a guy   
named ted burton 
lt says burton was a partner of wilson s   
and some other associates
in some business venture that failed 
says he spent time in the federal pen
and lost his fortune 
guy s been mla since his release and those
dates coincide with the first kidnappings 
 what do you think 
 l think this babysitting gig sucks 
dude  relax 
look  man 
all we got to do is pick these chicks up   
drop their ass off in the hamptons 
then we back in the chief s good graces 
l didn t join the fbl to become a nanny 
l want to be on the street
where the action is 
okay  blackie chan  and you ll get there
