okay  uh   
gracias

where they went 
i understand  yes  thank you 
so is the embassy

no  they re already closed 
that was a duty officer 
she said to fill out a report 
and somebody would call us
tomorrow when the embassy opens 
and what about the footage 
won t that be too late 
i know 
i ll make some more calls 
somebody s gotta be open 24 7 
so i ll just fill out
this form and   
don t worry 
i m gonna come by first thing
tomorrow morning

we re gonna figure this out 
okay  yeah 
thanks  heather 
good morning  this is assistant
legal attach elijah park 
am i speaking with ms  allen 
hello  hi  hi  hello 
hi  hi there  this is elijah park 
i m calling from
the u s  embassy in colombia 
i thought you guys opened
an hour ago 
sorry  i was on with
ms  damore 
she mentioned you wanted
to speak with me
about some footage 
yes  the security footage 
i put it all in the report   
great  i ll take a look 
now  i m here in colombia 
so i ll be acting as liaison
between you and local police 
did you not get my report 
um    doesn t appear so 
great  okay  well 
the hotel has security footage 
but it constantly overwrites 
so we have about six hours
until it s gone 
so can you please send
an agent over 
i ll do my best 
but keep in mind  the fbi
doesn t have jurisdiction
to investigate in colombia 
so it may take some time while
we work with local authorities 
great  now  listen 
what s even more helpful to us
is any information
you can tell me about your mom 
did she say
or do anything unusual
before she went missing 
could be a text  a voicemail 
no  not really 
okay  that s okay 
um  and do you have access
to anything we could use
to geolocate 
her gmail  icloud 
wait  maybe   
now  listen  we can only use
evidence from accounts
that you have legal access to 
otherwise nothing we learn
will be admissible in court 
i think i might have something 
come on 
never mind 
sorry  i don t have anything 
that s okay 
now  i know you re 18 
but do you have relatives
that could come stay with you 
no  um   
it s just me and my mom 
heather is probably
gonna stop by 
you are going to get
that footage  though  right 
if you get that form in 
i ll make sure it gets
to the right hands  okay 
we ll be in touch 
hi  hello 
hi  um   
i think your sound is off 
oh  hi  yes  yes  hi  javier 
signal okay now 
the signal is great 
i need you   
you are from where 
i m from los angeles  i need   
hollywood 
van nuys 
i need you to go to this hotel
and ask for
their security footage 
i m tryna find someone 
i don t understand 
 tryna find  
she s missing 
how long 
like 36 hours 
and i need someone
to get to the hotel
and get the footage
before it s erased
so we can see when she
and her boyfriend left 
la polic awill not check 
no  no  i mean 
they said they would try 
but they can t even
investigate directly 
so i need your help 
ah  lo siento  pero   
i m only services 
cleaning  electric  you know 
please  please  it s my mom 
please 
you make me think of my son 
never taking no for an answer 
okay  okay 
oh  man  thank you so much

are always tracking you 
yeah  yeah  i know 
but i can t get into her
accounts even if i wanted to 
and did you try his 
what

with her boyfriend 
so if you can t find hers 
maybe

i can find him 
yo hey  vee 
thanks for coming by 
heather never showed up 
of course  this is so crazy 
hey  i think caesar s
eating your smartwatch 
what 
i don t have a smartwatch 
anyway  does kevin give you
same password for everything
type of vibe 
mm  50 50 
actually  60 40 
why is your mom dating this guy 
heather thinks he s hot 
of course she does 
so you re trying
to get his password 
yeah 
oh  yeah  this will work 
do you remember that time
you impersonated the postmates
driver on the phone 
dude  he had no idea 
all right  i need your help 
so to recover your password 
i ll just have to verify
a couple things 
starting with date of birth 
november 10th  1980 
great  and the last four
of your social 
i don t give that out
on the phone 
in that case 
your mother s maiden name 
uh    chen  julia chen 
and the name
of your elementary school 
uh  the name
of my elementary school 
yup 
uh  sir 
do you need the full name or    
honestly  whatever works 
uh  tillman elementary 
oh  sweet  we re in 
okay  let s see
where they were going 
there s their uber to lax 
flight to cartagena 
hotel 
wait 
maybe he didn t have service 
but he was texting me
the whole time 
unless he turned off
his location 
bad news  the footage
is already gone 
but interesting story 
la se or a que limpia 
how do you say 
the cleaning se or a 
she went to school with my son 
and we got to talking   
no  javi  no time for stories 
hold on 
so i explain to her
what i m looking for 
and she says she sees
two american tourists
leave on friday  wait 
so she saw them leave 
now you have time
for the story  huh 
so they re going to leave 
and your mother says sorry
because she spilled some wine
on the bedsheets 
this is like 1 in the afternoon 
she dressed up very nice 
so the se oraasked if they
were going somewhere fancy 
and guess what your stepfather
said 
ew  no  not my stepfather 
oh  all right 
but he says he wants to go to   
how do you say  you know  store
where shovels and hammers   
wait  a hardware store 
s  hardware store 
on vacation 
did she say what store
they went to 
no  she didn t ask 
there s gotta be a way
to figure it out 
yo  me llamo veena 
hola  mucho gusto  javi 
credit card history 
his purchases should have
a location attached to them 
boom  kevin s last purchase 
same day they went missing 
getsemani  that s the store 
no  getsemani 
that s not a store 
that s an area  muy tur stico 
where you go to pay too much
for drinks 
okay  well  i m sending you
all the hardware stores
in getsemani 
talk to the workers 
see if they saw anything  okay 
or maybe i just buy some gum  huh 
to see if the bank code matches 
oh  my god  yes  javi  yes 
okay  i m sending you
the code now 
june  eight stores
might take a few hours 
is that okay with you 
for now 
i ll look through
his emails too 
see if there s a receipt
in there 
okay 
here we go  then 
you re going through his email 
yeah  so  so you can t
break into kevin s email
without permission 
but why would he turn off
his locations 
that doesn t make sense 
i don t know 
but you need to let the police
handle this stuff 
um  are you coming over 
i m sorry 
i gotta go into the office 
i had to change
a client meeting 
but i ll be there 
whoa  what  what is it 
um  sorry  heather  i gotta go 
no match yet  six more to go 
wait  wait  hold up 
i i think kevin was cheating 
 sheeting  
he clearly has a type 
what if you checked
his blocked users 
his what  in his contacts 
remember that one unfiction
episode with the affair 
whoa 
who are these people 
what the hell 
wait  who s greg 
hey  what s going on 
this woman calls him darren 
they all want their money back 
yo 
dude s not cheating  he s a   
he s a con man 
three years
in eastham federal prison 
released last year 
so you weren t gonna tell me
my mom was dating a felon 
  look  don t get me wrong 
  we are looking into him 
but he s never been involved
in a disappearance 
and he s been using
his legal name 
but don t you think this is
a pretty big coincidence 
keep in mind
that all of these cases
were from before
his prison sentence 
and he s never violated parole 
okay 
but what about
that bunny cake girl 
that s from this year  park  i understand 
but right now you are illegally
accessing mr  lin s account 
so any evidence that i receive
from that gets tossed in court 
look  i appreciate the help 
but our job is to find your mom
and build a prosecutable case
if there s a crime 
so we gotta do this
the right way 
you need to trust me on this 
uh  yeah  she works here 
and you haven t
heard from her at all 
nope 
i ve tried calling  dming her 
i ve been stuck
covering her shift
for the last two weeks  so   
two weeks  man  not exactly
out of character  though 
she s    special 
do you mind calling if you hear
from her  it s important 
uh    sure 
bunny cake is missing too 
she hasn t been to work
in two weeks 
you think he did
something to her 
i don t know 
but i know how to find out 
i thought he turned
his location off 
not till they got to colombia 
whoa 
he wasseeing her 
what were you up to 
huh   
what the hell 
and you got this number how 
i m calling about kevin lin 
he visited your house
like two weeks ago 
wait  slow down  kevin 
kevin lin 
he was at your house   
june 8th 
what was he doing there 
look  i don t wanna say anything
that he doesn t want public 
oh  so you re trying
to cover for him 
covering for wha    
of course not 
then why was he at your house 
it s a reentry program
for ex offenders 
i was paired with kevin
before i moved out here 
he comes and visits sometimes 
look  the hardest part
for these guys
is getting past the stigma 
so i try to be careful 
yeah  totally 
and did he ever   
mention my mom anytime 
mention 
i mean  he hasn t shut up about
her since they first met 
she seemed really good for him 
yeah  um   
do you remember how they met 
i mean  you d know
better than me 
yeah 
um  you don t think this was
just another one of his 
you know   
oh  no  i mean  look 
kevin s worked really hard
to put that stuff behind him 
it seemed real to me 
yeah 
and you said your name was jim 
jimmy  yeah 
listen  i ll talk to the wife 
i ll  uh  see
if she remembers anything 
good luck  june 
okay  thanks  jimmy

adi s  veena

her voicemail is full 
she turned off
location services 
and she knows that
she s supposed to be home at 11 
she knows this 
hey  she s almost 18 
if she took the time
to turn off locations 
she s probably okay 
i know  i just   
i don t know  she s   
when i look at her  i just   
i just see her father 
and it s like   
we ve really been through
a lot together 
and i just don t think
that i could  uh   
i don t think that i could
forgive myself
if anything ever happened
to her  you know 
you seem like
a really great mom 
one day  she ll get that 
uh    so actually 
i ve got stuff too 
i have a record

good morning 
i m elijah park with the fbi 
last evening we determined
that u s  citizen grace allen 
previously thought
to have been kidnapped
here in cartagena  colombia 
was in fact impersonated
in an alleged scheme
by the suspects behind me 
we are now turning to
the public for any information
regarding the whereabouts
of miss allen 
who we now believe   
never left los angeles 
hi  everybody 
first up this morning 
 the strangest case
i ve ever seen  
those are the words used
by lapd detective luciana gomez
to describe the disappearance
of a van nuys resident
who was seemingly swapped out
with another woman
along their uber drive to lax 
because of
the staged kidnapping 
we ve lost a lot of time 
it s now been over a week
since miss allen was last seen 
so we need to move quickly 
a ground search begins today
for a woman
police say went missing
somewhere along her nearly
22 mile trip to the airport 
grace 
grace 
grace 
grace 
grace 
they were talking to you
for a while  they know anything 
they think whatever happened
must have been
on the drive to lax 
right  right  right 
look at this  look at  em 
so your mom gets in the uber 
they take the 405 
and then a totally different
woman gets out at lax 
if kevin did something to her 
that s when it happened 
the weird thing is 
he only ever stopped
for three minutes along the way 
he must have had help 
uber has no record of the trip 
and the car was using
stolen plates 
we got an apb out
for the vehicle now 
yep  down in front 
is it possible
that the uber driver was hired 
it s possible 
according to our friends
at the fbi   
large withdrawals
from miss allen s bank account
were made
after her disappearance 
in the meantime  the one person
who knows for sure
what s going on here   
is mr  lin 
so we re working with
the police around the region 
including officers
at the venezuelan border 
we find him   
and we find grace allen 
javi  what are they saying 
they say that the police
arrested some local students
that lin hired
to be part of a movie 
whoa  june 
check this out 
huh 
  they re arresting her 
  right now 
there she is  there  there 
no  no  no  can you see her 
what 
aspiring actress rachel page 
recently detained upon
reentering the u s  
was released today on bail
as a cooperating witness 
he said it was a reality show 
like a lifestyle travel thing 
all shot on a iphone and stuff 
i had to walk a certain way 
dress a certain way 
and i couldn t even post
anything on instagram 
but after the kidnapping scene 
i knew something was up 
so i made a run for it 
but there was no crew 
no real cameras 
none of that seemed odd 
i just thought 
 damn  this guy has a vision  
how do you know she s not lying 
miss page said kevin
and his driver
picked her up near the 405 
so lapd checked traffic cameras 
by the time kevin got there 
your mom was already gone 
miss page never saw her 
okay  well  did she get
a good look at the driver 
middle aged  baseball hat 
that s all we got 
she couldn t see his face
from the back seat 
yo  kevin for sure
hired that guy 
veena  shut up 
i m sorry 
listen  miss allen 
while i have you 
i have some questions regarding
something we re looking into 
okay 
you mentioned that you don t
have any extended family  right 
no 
to the best of your knowledge 
your mom has never gone
by any other names 
no  she s just grace allen  why 
exclusive developments tonight
in the case of grace allen 
public records suggesting
there may be more
to the missing van nuys resident
than meets the eye 
turns out grace allen
is just one
of the mystery woman s aliases 
whose real identity lies locked
behind a court ordered seal 
you re her lawyer 
there s nothing you can do 
it s a court ordered seal 
it s gonna take at least a week
to get a judge to lift it 
and she never said
anything to you about this 
i don t   
no  i don t think so 
why would she keep this from me 
does this suggest grace allen
herself might be implicated 
let me be clear 
right now 
grace allen is not a suspect 
that being said 
we can t rule anything out 
hi  is this june allen 
i m an executive at netflix 
and we d love to talk to you 
calling in for my podcast
on spotify   
  i tried leaving a voicemail 
  i m writing an article   
yo  it s angel 
just checking in
on things with your mom 
also  did you find my watch 
so the missing money
wasn t stolen 
it was payment to kevin
for helping her disappear 
why else would she   
she hired lin and the driver 
stages the kidnapping 
hides in the trunk  drives off 
starts a new life somewhere 
which we know she s done
once before 
i mean  zero known
family members 
other than the daughter 
that s hella sus 
i cannot take this anymore 
it s just the internet  june 
no  no  it s not
just the internet 
it s the police too 
hey  hey  hey 
it s going to be okay  june 
don t let them put you down 
how many tax dollars
have been wasted
searching for someone
who clearly ran away 
i mean 
her coworker described her
as dodgy
and guarded about her past 
how can people
believe any of this 
they re focusing
on the wrong person 
at least they re trying to help 
like  imagine if this
was an unfictionepisode 
you d be asking questions
too  no 
about kevin  not my mom 
yeah  but even you said she was
hiding something  right 
she knew about kevin
the whole time 
plus the whole identity change   
veena  what the hell 
no  i just mean that there are
some legit questions 
there are no questions 
this is not a show 
this is my mom 
june  obviously i   
you should just go 
she was messaging kevin
less than 24 hours ago 
plus she s been ignoring me
since they went missing 
breathe  just breathe 
maybe there is a good answer 
and she s been obsessed with
kevin ever since they met 
it s all making sense 
what is that  it has a camera 
this way 
she won t know i m recording 
june  if you think
something is wrong 
you need to tell la polic a i have tried 
i have tried telling them about
kevin and about rachel 
but anything i find on kevin s
account can t be used
to help  build a prosecutable
case  or whatever 
so i have to record her 
i m syncing to the watch now 
i need you to stay on the phone
while i m in there
in case something happens 
june  i m sorry 
it s too dangerous 
no  the police are acting like
my mom s some kind
of criminal mastermind 
peromaybe right now
you need to trust them 
what are you saying 
just because someone
is your parent 
it doesn t mean
they do not make mistakes 
oh 
i guess you would know  huh 
maybe you gave up on your son   
but i m not giving up on my mom 
it s june 27th  10 p m  
at the office of heather damore 
73815 wilshire boulevard 
approaching her office now 
heather 
heather  it s june 
heather 
i saw your car out there 
i know you re   
hello 
the hell 
what 
hello 
heather 
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
oh  my god  heather 
based on the autopsy 
whoever did this
was there minutes
before you arrived 
you re lucky to be alive 
they must ve seen
the messages i sent to her 
they knew i was coming 
i just don t understand
why she d be messaging him 
look  the wiped computer 
the missing files   
my guess is
that she knew something
that kevin
didn t want us to know 
she wasn t willfully
messaging him 
he was threatening her 
and the photos were    
to keep her quiet  yeah 
she was trying to protect me 
but if kevin is still
in colombia  who did this 
i don t know 
but in the meantime 
lapd will stay there with you
until they find a safe place
for you to go  okay 
look  mr  lin is the key
to all of this 
now  the good news is
police may have spotted him
near the border 
so it might not be long 
he is our best chance
at finding your mom 
yeah 
thank you 
  polic a
