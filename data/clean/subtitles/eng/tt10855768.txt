thanks heather
good morning this is assistant
legal attach elijah park
am i speaking with ms allen
hello hi hi hello
hi hi there this is elijah park
im calling from
the us embassy in colombia
i thought you guys opened
an hour ago
sorry i was on with
ms damore
she mentioned you wanted
to speak with me
about some footage
yes the security footage
i put it all in the report
great ill take a look
now im here in colombia
so ill be acting as liaison
between you and local police
did you not get my report
um doesnt appear so
great okay well
the hotel has security footage
but it constantly overwrites
so we have about six hours
until its gone
so can you please send
an agent over
ill do my best
but keep in mind the fbi
doesnt have jurisdiction
to investigate in colombia
so it may take some time while
we work with local authorities
great now listen
whats even more helpful to us
is any information
you can tell me about your mom
did she say
or do anything unusual
before she went missing
could be a text a voicemail
no not really
okay thats okay
um and do you have access
to anything we could use
to geolocate
her gmail icloud
wait maybe
now listen we can only use
evidence from accounts
that you have legal access to
otherwise nothing we learn
will be admissible in court
i think i might have something
come on
never mind
sorry i dont have anything
thats okay
now i know youre 18
but do you have relatives
that could come stay with you
no um
its just me and my mom
heather is probably
gonna stop by
you are going to get
that footage though right
if you get that form in
ill make sure it gets
to the right hands okay
well be in touch
hi hello

and ask for
their security footage
im tryna find someone
i dont understand

to get to the hotel
and get the footage
before its erased
so we can see when she

on the phone
in that case
your mothers maiden name
uh chen julia chen
and the name
of your elementary school

uh tillman elementary
oh sweet were in
okay lets see
where they were going
theres their uber to lax
flight to cartagena
hotel
wait
maybe he didnt have service
but he was texting me
the whole time
unless he turned off
his location
bad news the footage
is already gone
but interesting story
la se or a que limpia
how do you say
the cleaning se or a
she went to school with my son
and we got to talking
no javi no time for stories
hold on
so i explain to her
what im looking for
and she says she sees
two american tourists
leave on friday wait
so she saw them leave
now you have time
for the story huh
so theyre going to leave
and your mother says sorry
because she spilled some wine
on the bedsheets
this is like 1 in the afternoon
she dressed up very nice
so the se oraasked if they
were going somewhere fancy
and guess what your stepfather
said
ew no not my stepfather
oh all right
but he says he wants to go to
how do you say you know store
where shovels and hammers
wait a hardware store
s hardware store
on vacation
did she say what store
they went to
no she didnt ask
theres gotta be a way
to figure it out
yo me llamo veena
hola mucho gusto javi
credit card history
his purchases should have
a location attached to them
boom kevins last purchase
same day they went missing
getsemani thats the store
no getsemani
thats not a store
thats an area muy tur stico
where you go to pay too much
for drinks
okay well im sending you
all the hardware stores
in getsemani
talk to the workers
see if they saw anything okay
or maybe i just buy some gum huh
to see if the bank code matches
oh my god yes javi yes
okay im sending you
the code now
june eight stores
might take a few hours
is that okay with you
for now
ill look through
his emails too
see if theres a receipt
in there
okay
here we go then
youre going through his email
yeah so so you cant
break into kevins email
without permission
but why would he turn off
his locations
that doesnt make sense
i dont know
but you need to let the police
handle this stuff
um are you coming over
im sorry
i gotta go into the office
i had to change
a client meeting
but ill be there
whoa what what is it
um sorry heather i gotta go
no match yet six more to go
wait wait hold up
ii think kevin was cheating
sheeting
he clearly has a type
what if you checked
his blocked users
his what in his contacts
remember that one unfiction
episode with the affair
whoa
who are these people
what the hell
wait whos greg
hey whats going on
this woman calls him darren
they all want their money back
yo
dudes not cheating hes a
hes a con man
three years
in eastham federal prison
released last year
so you werent gonna tell me
my mom was dating a felon
look dont get me wrong
we are looking into him
but hes never been involved
in a disappearance
and hes been using
his legal name
but dont you think this is
a pretty big coincidence
keep in mind
that all of these cases
were from before
his prison sentence
and hes never violated parole
okay
but what about
that bunny cake girl
thats from this year park i understand
but right now you are illegally
accessing mr lins account
so any evidence that i receive
from that gets tossed in court
look i appreciate the help
but our job is to find your mom
and build a prosecutable case
if theres a crime
so we gotta do this
the right way
you need to trust me on this
uh yeah she works here
and you havent
heard from her at all
nope
ive tried calling dming her
ive been stuck
covering her shift
for the last two weeks so
two weeks man not exactly
out of character though
shes special
do you mind calling if you hear
from her its important
uh sure
bunny cake is missing too
she hasnt been to work
in two weeks
you think he did
something to her
i dont know
but i know how to find out
i thought he turned
his location off
not till they got to colombia
whoa
he wasseeing her
what were you up to
huh
what the hell
and you got this number how
im calling about kevin lin
he visited your house
like two weeks ago
wait slow down kevin
kevin lin
he was at your house
june 8th
what was he doing there
look i dont wanna say anything
that he doesnt want public
oh so youre trying
to cover for him
covering for wha
of course not
then why was he at your house
its a reentry program
for exoffenders
i was paired with kevin
before i moved out here
he comes and visits sometimes
look the hardest part
for these guys
is getting past the stigma
so i try to be careful
yeah totally
and did he ever
mention my mom anytime
mention
i mean he hasnt shut up about
her since they first met
she seemed really good for him
yeah um
do you remember how they met
i mean youd know

oh my god
good morning
im elijah park with the fbi
last evening we determined
that us citizen grace allen
previously thought
to have been kidnapped
here in cartagena colombia
was in fact impersonated
in an alleged scheme
by the suspects behind me
we are now turning to
the public for any information
regarding the whereabouts
of miss allen
who we now believe
never left los angeles
hi everybody
first up this morning
the strangest case
ive ever seen
those are the words used
by lapd detective luciana gomez
to describe the disappearance
of a van nuys resident
who was seemingly swapped out
with another woman
along their uber drive to lax
because of
the staged kidnapping
weve lost a lot of time
its now been over a week
since miss allen was last seen
so we need to move quickly
a ground search begins today
for a woman
police say went missing
somewhere along her nearly
22mile trip to the airport
grace
grace
grace
grace
grace
they were talking to you
for a while they know anything
they think whatever happened
must have been
on the drive to lax
right right right
look at this look at em
so your mom gets in the uber
they take the 405
and then a totally different
woman gets out at lax
if kevin did something to her
thats when it happened
the weird thing is
he only ever stopped
for three minutes along the way
he must have had help
uber has no record of the trip
and the car was using
stolen plates
we got an apb out
for the vehicle now
yep down in front
is it possible
that the uber driver was hired
its possible
according to our friends
at the fbi
large withdrawals
from miss allens bank account
were made
after her disappearance
in the meantime the one person
who knows for sure
whats going on here
is mr lin
so were working with
the police around the region
including officers
at the venezuelan border
we find him
and we find grace allen
javi what are they saying
they say that the police
arrested some local students
that lin hired
to be part of a movie
whoa june
check this out
huh
theyre arresting her
right now
there she is there there
no no no can you see her
what
aspiring actress rachel page
recently detained upon
reentering the us
was released today on bail
as a cooperating witness
he said it was a reality show
like a lifestyle travel thing
all shot on a iphone and stuff
i had to walk a certain way
dress a certain way
and i couldnt even post
anything on instagram
but after the kidnapping scene
i knew something was up
so i made a run for it
but there was no crew
no real cameras
none of that seemed odd
i just thought
damn this guy has a vision
how do you know shes not lying
miss page said kevin
and his driver
picked her up near the 405
so lapd checked traffic cameras
by the time kevin got there
your mom was already gone
miss page never saw her
okay well did she get
a good look at the driver
middleaged baseball hat
thats all we got
she couldnt see his face
from the back seat
yo kevin for sure
hired that guy
veena shut up
im sorry
listen miss allen
while i have you
i have some questions regarding
something were looking into
okay
you mentioned that you dont
have any extended family right
no
to the best of your knowledge
your mom has never gone
by any other names
no shes just grace allen why
exclusive developments tonight
in the case of grace allen
public records suggesting
there may be more
to the missing van nuys resident
than meets the eye
turns out grace allen
is just one
of the mystery womans aliases
whose real identity lies locked
behind a courtordered seal
youre her lawyer
theres nothing you can do
its a courtordered seal
its gonna take at least a week
to get a judge to lift it
and she never said
anything to you about this
i dont
no i dont think so
why would she keep this from me
does this suggest grace allen
herself might be implicated
let me be clear
right now
grace allen is not a suspect
that being said
we cant rule anything out
hi is this june allen
im an executive at netflix
and wed love to talk to you
calling in for my podcast
on spotify
i tried leaving a voicemail
im writing an article
yo its angel
just checking in
on things with your mom
also did you find my watch
so the missing money
wasnt stolen
it was payment to kevin
for helping her disappear
why else would she
she hired lin and the driver
stages the kidnapping
hides in the trunk drives off
starts a new life somewhere
which we know shes done
once before
i mean zero known
family members
other than the daughter
thats hella sus
i cannot take this anymore
its just the internet june
no no its not
just the internet
its the police too
hey hey hey
its going to be okay june
dont let them put you down
how many tax dollars
have been wasted
searching for someone
who clearly ran away
i mean
her coworker described her
as dodgy
and guarded about her past
how can people
believe any of this
theyre focusing
on the wrong person
at least theyre trying to help
like imagine if this
was an unfictionepisode
youd be asking questions
too no
about kevin not my mom
yeah but even you said she was
hiding something right
she knew about kevin
the whole time
plus the whole identity change
veena what the hell
no i just mean that there are
some legit questions
there are no questions
this is not a show
this is my mom
june obviously i
you should just go
she was messaging kevin
less than 24 hours ago
plus shes been ignoring me
since they went missing
breathe just breathe
maybe there is a good answer
and shes been obsessed with
kevin ever since they met
its all making sense
what is that it has a camera
this way
she wont know im recording
june if you think
something is wrong
you need to tell la polic ai have tried
i have tried telling them about
kevin and about rachel
but anything i find on kevins
account cant be used
to help build a prosecutable
case or whatever
so i have to record her
im syncing to the watch now
i need you to stay on the phone
while im in there
in case something happens
june im sorry
its too dangerous
no the police are acting like
my moms some kind
of criminal mastermind
peromaybe right now
you need to trust them
what are you saying
just because someone
is your parent
it doesnt mean
they do not make mistakes
oh
i guess you would know huh
maybe you gave up on your son
but im not giving up on my mom
its june 27th 10 pm
at the office of heather damore
73815 wilshire boulevard
approaching her office now
heather
heather its june
heather
i saw your car out there
i know youre
hello
the hell
what
hello
heather
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god heather
based on the autopsy
whoever did this
was there minutes
before you arrived
youre lucky to be alive
they mustve seen
the messages i sent to her
they knew i was coming
i just dont understand
why shed be messaging him
look the wiped computer
the missing files
my guess is
that she knew something
that kevin
didnt want us to know
she wasnt willfully
