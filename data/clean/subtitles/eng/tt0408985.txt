for those
who don t get a lot of heartburn

you see this area here 
this is your mass 
  my mass 
your tumor 
and this  and this  and this 
i m sorry  georgia

you sold all of your bonds 
ms  byrd  as chairman
of the commerce committee   
i m always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself   
operate the market 
did you think that rates
were going up  or were you   
pessimistic about the future 
well  congressman   
  bob  please  bob 
well  bob  i find that the future
is too depressing to think about 
oh  come on  georgia 
miss byrd

oh  come on  matthew 
why don t we all go along and watch 
it sounds like fun  let s do that 
that is a great idea 
better than some glass factory 
fine  fine  fine 
but i m not going there to watch 
so  because it s a dam
and not a straight jump   
yes 
   when you don t do it right 
you will catch the current   
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam 
so  we don t want that  okay 
so  are you ready 
  yes  i am 
go get them  matthew 
  come on 
damn 
okay  now we re gonna do this 
i don t know what the hell makes people

sales associate 
i wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth 
oh  mademoiselle   
you were incredible tonight 
you amazed us all 
and myself  too 
so  how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home 
probably because you re not home
that much anymore 
well  washington
is a hard place to resist 
come visit me sometime  you ll see 
i m sorry 
but i just can t seem to get past   
that big flashing  for sale  sign
on your forehead 
what are you talking about 
  you know what i m talking about 
what are you doing here with kragen 
i mean  what exactly is it
that you two do for each other 
i m helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee  that s all 
well  it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people   
over some hurdles 
i mean  precious little s happened   
with that community redevelopment
program of yours 
and nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless i get re elected 
having generous supporters
like matthew kragen is a political reality 
yeah  well   
i m sorry  but   
i only have time for reality realities 
good night 
good night  georgia 
mademoiselle byrd  i hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight 
i don t know about that 
  but there s no need to be humble 
did you have a marvelous time 
why re you being so nice to me 
yeah  i know  i m a bitch 
at least that s what people tell me 
oh  miss gunther   
no  you re not  you re just like
a lot of women who work too hard 
and yet you are always so kind 
you are a woman of distinction
and courage 
yeah  apparently i am  all of a sudden 
wish it had happened a little sooner 
miss gunther 
i hope you re not trying
to make a pass at me   
 cause i really can t handle that
right now 
please don t die  miss byrd 
i read the note 
you went through my stuff 
  oh  yeah  i go through everyone s stuff 
i apologize 
well  to tell you the truth 
i m kind of relieved   
to have somebody to share it with 
don t worry  i ll be with you here
to the very end 
i don t know if i want to be here
to the very end 
why are you here
with these terrible people 
you should be with people you love 
yeah  i ve been thinking
about that myself 
one in particular 
it s time i go home and find him 
thank you  god 
that s a lot of snow 
what s going on here 
  it s an avalanche 
i m sorry  but we ll have to go back 
i can t believe this happened
on new year s eve 
you re just not gonna cut me
any slack at all  are you 
you re telling me there s nothing else 
i wanted you to find out everything   
  as i told you before  nothing 
nothing 
  nothing out of the ordinary 
except that she is a saint 
and from new orleans 
  yes 
and her occupation 
  you should know  she works for you 
now  please 
  wait  wait  wait 
she works for me 
  that s all i know and all i m telling 
here s your tip back 
at this rate 
we re going to be here all night 
oh  no  we are not 
we are going back down the mountain 
i prefer to spend the night with my wife 
hey  what are you doing 
are you crazy  it s dangerous 
  yeah  i know 
but i don t have much time 
keep the change 
wish me luck 
i hate snow 
snow sucks 
cookware  are you sure 
i heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche 
i just thought i d check
to see if you needed any help 
but i don t want to get in your way
or nothing 
no  no  no  it would be an honor 
a privilege 
what is this 
it s a turnip 
no  it s not  that can t be no turnip 
the poor baby turnips 
nobody likes them  you know 
of course 
life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom 
but the turnip is to be loved   
because she s a self made woman
of vegetables 
all the others you can only destroy
with cooking 
but the turnip  she gets better 
so  you see  it s not how you start   
but how you finish 
that s gonna be good 
the first time i saw you   
i was so happy
to see your appetite for food   
for life 
i m so sorry 
gunther 
does anybody else know 
no 
okay 
well  good 
let s not say anything  all right 
let s just    let s just cook 
the onions  they make me cry 
you have been very lucky 
well  you didn t get everything
you wanted   
but you have   
next time  we do things different 
we will laugh more  we ll love more 
we ll see the world 
we just won t be so afraid 
happy new year 
look at you 
now  see  look at these tumors 
georgia byrd  mr  smith  and mine 
now there s no way 
even if we all had it   
that they would be
exactly in the same place 
so  i said to myself   rabindranath 
it has to be the machine  
oh  my god 
thanks  i ll see you 
excuse me  young man 
do you live here 
yeah  i live right here 
please tell me you know georgia byrd 
  yeah  i know georgia 
thank you 
tonight i d like to make a toast   
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us 
to georgia byrd 
well  hear  hear 
to georgia 
now  who is this fascinating woman 
it s the question
we ve been asking ourselves all week 
is she a representative
from a competing boardroom 
is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation s capital 
is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur 
the truth  which i discovered tonight 
will amuse you 
you see  georgia byrd is a sales clerk   
in my new orleans store 
in the cookware department  no less 
salary   29 000 a year 
cheers  georgia 
what 
  no 
or as we might say back home 
 attention kragen shoppers 
impostor  aisle three  
oh  come on  georgia  is this true 
mr  kragen is right about me 
i m just a sales associate
in one of his stores 
one of the best 
or i was up until a couple of weeks ago 
that s when   
  you owe these people no explanation 
no  excuse me  i think she does 
she s had plenty to say
about our behavior all week   
and the only reason we took it was   
because we thought
she was somebody 
well  i m sorry 
i didn t come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me 
i just came here to blow
every last cent of my money 
you see   
i m gonna die 
georgia  please 
  oh  it s okay  it s okay 
it s all right 
yeah  see  i had that same reaction
when i found out   
i only had three weeks to live 
i mean  i tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason 
it s a party killer  ain t it 
but i did land on that mountaintop 
and i ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine 
don t feel sorry for me  baby 
never in my life did i think   
i would end up
in such a beautiful place   
doing so many incredible things 
so   
i m sorry if i was   
maybe a little too honest with you 
but i wasted too much of my life
being quiet 
i was afraid  i guess 
you know how it is 
you keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle 
then you look up one day and wonder 
 how did i even get here  
huh  bro 
see  some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless 
so   
i hope i haven t spoiled your evening 
and   
it s truly been my pleasure
