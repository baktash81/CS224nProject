sales associate
i wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth
oh mademoiselle
you were incredible tonight
you amazed us all
and myself too
so how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home
probably because youre not home
that much anymore
well washington
is a hard place to resist
come visit me sometime youll see
im sorry
but i just cant seem to get past
that big flashing for sale sign
on your forehead
what are you talking about
you know what im talking about
what are you doing here with kragen
i mean what exactly is it
that you two do for each other
im helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee thats all
well it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people
over some hurdles
i mean precious littles happened
with that community redevelopment
program of yours
and nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless i get reelected
having generous supporters
like matthew kragen is a political reality
yeah well
im sorry but
i only have time for reality realities
good night
good night georgia
mademoiselle byrd i hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight
i dont know about that
but theres no need to be humble
did you have a marvelous time
whyre you being so nice to me
yeah i know im a bitch
at least thats what people tell me
oh miss gunther
no youre not youre just like
a lot of women who work too hard
and yet you are always so kind
you are a woman of distinction
and courage
yeah apparently i am all of a sudden
wish it had happened a little sooner
miss gunther
i hope youre not trying
to make a pass at me
cause i really cant handle that
right now
please dont die miss byrd
i read the note
you went through my stuff
oh yeah i go through everyones stuff
i apologize
well to tell you the truth
im kind of relieved
to have somebody to share it with
dont worry ill be with you here
to the very end
i dont know if i want to be here
to the very end
why are you here
with these terrible people
you should be with people you love
yeah ive been thinking
about that myself
one in particular
its time i go home and find him
thank you god
thats a lot of snow
whats going on here
its an avalanche
im sorry but well have to go back
i cant believe this happened
on new years eve
youre just not gonna cut me
any slack at all are you
youre telling me theres nothing else
i wanted you to find out everything
as i told you before nothing
nothing
nothing out of the ordinary
except that she is a saint
and from new orleans
yes
and her occupation
you should know she works for you
now please
wait wait wait
she works for me
thats all i know and all im telling
heres your tip back
at this rate
were going to be here all night
oh no we are not
we are going back down the mountain
i prefer to spend the night with my wife
hey what are you doing
are you crazy its dangerous
yeah i know
but i dont have much time
keep the change
wish me luck
i hate snow
snow sucks
cookware are you sure
i heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche
i just thought id check
to see if you needed any help
but i dont want to get in your way
or nothing
no no no it would be an honor
a privilege
what is this
its a turnip
no its not that cant be no turnip
the poor baby turnips
nobody likes them you know
of course
life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom
but the turnip is to be loved
because shes a selfmade woman
of vegetables
all the others you can only destroy
with cooking
but the turnip she gets better
so you see its not how you start
but how you finish
thats gonna be good
the first time i saw you
i was so happy
to see your appetite for food
for life
im so sorry
gunther
does anybody else know
no
okay
well good
lets not say anything all right
lets just lets just cook
the onions they make me cry
you have been very lucky
well you didnt get everything
you wanted
but you have
next time we do things different
we will laugh more well love more
well see the world
we just wont be so afraid
happy new year
look at you
now see look at these tumors
georgia byrd mr smith and mine
now theres no way
even if we all had it
that they would be
exactly in the same place
so i said to myself rabindranath
it has to be the machine
oh my god
thanks ill see you
excuse me young man
do you live here
yeah i live right here
please tell me you know georgia byrd
yeah i know georgia
thank you
tonight id like to make a toast
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us
to georgia byrd
well hear hear
to georgia
now who is this fascinating woman
its the question
weve been asking ourselves all week
is she a representative
from a competing boardroom
is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nations capital
is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur
the truth which i discovered tonight
will amuse you
you see georgia byrd is a sales clerk
in my new orleans store
in the cookware department no less
salary 29000 a year
cheers georgia
what
no
or as we might say back home
attention kragen shoppers
impostor aisle three
oh come on georgia is this true
mr kragen is right about me
im just a sales associate
in one of his stores
one of the best
or i was up until a couple of weeks ago
thats when
you owe these people no explanation
no excuse me i think she does
shes had plenty to say
about our behavior all week
and the only reason we took it was
because we thought
she was somebody
well im sorry
i didnt come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me
i just came here to blow
every last cent of my money
you see
im gonna die
georgia please
oh its okay its okay
its all right
yeah see i had that same reaction
when i found out
i only had three weeks to live
i mean i tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason
its a partykiller aint it
but i did land on that mountaintop
and i ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine
dont feel sorry for me baby
never in my life did i think
i would end up
in such a beautiful place
doing so many incredible things
so
im sorry if i was
maybe a little too honest with you
but i wasted too much of my life
being quiet
i was afraid i guess
you know how it is
you keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle
then you look up one day and wonder
how did i even get here
huh bro
see some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless
so
i hope i havent spoiled your evening
and
its truly been my pleasure
happy new year
happy new year georgia
thank you
asshole
thats a very appropriate sentiment
darling
i second that
happy new year matthew
where are you going
well first im gonna find georgia
and then im gonna go back to school
and im going to get
my business degree
and then one day when your wife
finally decides to divorce you
