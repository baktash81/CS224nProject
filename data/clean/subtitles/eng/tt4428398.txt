  rode a hero  the blazing samurai  
  when one town was found
to be in danger  
  from the evildoers dropping by  
  who appeared 
that brave and mighty stranger  
  to save the day
came the blazing samurai  
  sent by the shogun
with arrows and blowgun  
  his nunchucks could poke out an eye  
  trained in bushido
the samurai s credo  
  he mastered aikido  
  he really was one awesome guy  
  he was legend
with his sword a swinging  
  villains feared
his fearsome battle cry  
  conquered hate
with justice he was bringing  
  he took a stand to save the land  
  praise the blazing samurai  
where did that come from 
the title department 
hyah 
that blue should be more blue blue 
huh 
  that s wrong 
  ah 
you can t climb those  start again 
you like these 
no 
how s everything coming along 
the shogun is coming to visit in one week 
everyone knows he s trying to decide
who his successor will be 
and if i have anything to do with it 
it ll be me 
i ve spared no expense
making this the grandest palace
in the land 
imported mice to chase 
fine couches to ruin 
and the crown jewel of the palace 
my state of the art bathroom 
behold  the future 
i call it the super bowl 
because that s what it is  a super bowl 
impressive 
i hope the shogun thinks so 
the only thing left to solve
is our little problem 
  kakamucho 
  precisely 
what do you do when you re a landlord 
and you have tenants you really hate 
you evict them 
but the town s been there
for thousands of years 
i give you an order 
and you give me facts  really 
the only fact i m interested in
is that that hairball of a town
is ruining my magnificent view 
we ve got to wipe them off the map
to make this palace absolutely perfect 
but what about the samurai
that s there to protect them 
just get rid of their samurai 
the fraidy cats will follow 
but make sure
it can t be traced back to me 
bandits 
you warn the others  i ll get the samurai 
stranger danger  stranger danger 
stranger danger  stranger danger 
stranger danger  stranger danger 
mr  samurai  mr  samurai 
bad cats are coming  we need your help 
i ve got this  i know exactly what to do 
samurai  we re coming for you 
bring it on  bandits 
hyah 
oh  no 
i know these events look dire 
but we must stand on our own four legs
and fight 
this is our home 
it is the sacred place
where our kittens were born
and where we will
one day join our ancestors
in a shoebox buried behind the garage 
dr  katz  you have something to say 
no  i just got a hairball 
what we need is a samurai 
we still can t find the last one 
we even put up posters 
what we need is a new samurai 
not it 
no  think 
where did we get our old samurai 
samurais  r  us 
argh  no  from the shogun 
so why don t we ask the shogun
to send us a new one 
okay  i ve got it 
why don t we ask the shogun
to send us a new one 
work  work  work 
let s see  what s on the agenda today 
cat fights on the western front 
cat scratch fever
breaking out in the east 
what s this  our sacred soil
has been soiled by a dog
who crossed the border 
probably a border collie 
fortunately  he s been apprehended 
oh  well 
you break the law  you pay the price 
it s not personal  it s just business 
and you know what they say 
 there s no business
like shogun business  
i ve got an urgent message 
i ve got an urgent message 
from the cats of kakamucho

yes  that s it  i need a new plan 
but what can that plan be 
why am i asking you 
all right  get up 
it s time 
here  this is for you 
what s that for 
oh  that  that s for your execution 
what  but i haven t done anything 
i don t understand 
you came to this country illegally 
it s strictly no dogs allowed 
didn t you know  cats hate dogs 
but dogs are lovable 
how could you hate a dog 
my dad hated dogs
and that s good enough for me 
it s not really based on logic 
it just feels right to hate  you know 
yeah  makes sense to me 
now severing number one 
number one 
number one 
  i don t want to 
  what 
i don t want to do that 
i don t want to go up there 
  okay  then  you don t have to 
  really  thank you 
of course 
i mean  what are we  barbarians 
archers 
hey  i m trying to think up here 
i know you ve got a lot of prisoners
to kill  but please  can you keep it down 
  sorry 
  yeah  thank you 
there he goes 
  get him 
  come on  move 
he s getting away 
hyah 
hey  can t we just talk this out 
  i don t speak dog 
  but wait 
  we re communicating right now 
  no  we re not 
  you just understood me 
  no  i didn t 
you should ve never come here  dog 
you don t belong 
  there he is 
  don t let him get away 
whew 
doggone it 
plan  plan   
what i need    yes 
i ll send the worst samurai
in the entire world 
and they do a terrible job 
but where do you look
for something truly bad 
wait  please 
i only came to your country
to learn to be a samurai 
as if a dog could ever become a samurai 
never  a dog 
a dog 
hold your fire 
aw 
nice save 
always happy to lend a hand 
hi there  who s a good dog 
yeah  who s a good dog  who s a good dog 
  does this mean you re not gonna kill me 
  on the contrary 
let s talk about what you can do for me 
i am offering to make you
the new samurai of kakamucho 
  kakamucho  what s that 
  in the way 
but that s not as important as you are
at this lucky  lucky moment 
are you sure i m ready
to defend an entire town 
maybe i should start out
as a mall samurai 
what 
no  no 
time to get my new samurai to kakamucho 
so you can hurry up and die i ive   
dive right in 
whoa  uh   
so  do i get a badge
or a certificate or a   
you know  something official like 
there you go  makes it all official 
wow  a samurai cup 
yes  they ve all got one 
just show that around 
 wow  he s got a cup  he s a samurai 
we d better do what he says  
well  better get going 
that town isn t gonna samurai itself 
but i don t know where i m going 
don t worry  the horse knows 
he s got gps 
giddy up  uh  positioning system 
why are you sending the dog
to defend kakamucho 
they will kill him 
and the orphanage said
you would never speak 
yes  they will kill him 
and killing an official samurai   
why  that s against the law 
i would have to arrest all of them 
and that would leave no one in the town
where i want no one 
you did know where we were going 
it s the latest thing 
it s called a  gun  
is it dangerous 
don t be silly  guns don t kill cats 
cars and curiosity kill cats 
what s a car 
careful  you re being curious 
he s coming  he s coming 
there he is  the new samurai 
the new samurai s a dog 
he s a what 
the new samurai is a dog 
the new samurai is a dong 
 welcome to kakamucho  
okay  here goes nothing 
welcoming committee 
maybe this won t be so bad 
okay  first day on the job 
make eye contact  smile   
  it s a dog 
  he s gonna ruin everything 
let s kill him
before the new samurai arrives 
sic him 
kill him  tear him up 
sit 
now that s what i call wokking the dog 
yeah   cause she hit that dog with a wok 
uh  is he dead 
hey  see if he has any snacks
in his pockets 
oh  it s a trick  he s playing dead 
  bad doggy 
  dang it 
  sic him 
  wait  can we just talk for one minute 
shut up  dog 
i am the new samurai  i am 
look  here s my cup 
let him have it 
stop  he is the new samurai 
it says he s been appointed
by the shogun himself 
well  that is    wow 
i did not see that coming 
give me that 
you must be confused  little girl 
argh 
well  this is certainly disappointing 
what is 
i can t read 
she is right  it s official 
so we cannot kill him 
yeah  no 
yeah  i know  i know 
we re all disappointed 
  but we can still hate him  right 
  absolutely 
you are  number one  not a cat 
number two  you are a dog 
so that goes back to you not being a cat 
and three 
you are definitely not a samurai
because you are a dog  and that
goes back to you not being a cat 
go back where you came from  car chaser 
again  what s a car 
stop being curious  you ll kill us all 
hi 
hi 
are you really a dog 
  yes  i am a dog 
  told you 
i didn t know dogs could be samurai 
well  they can  and i   
  wait  why not 
  your sword s on backwards 
no  it s not  actually  is it 
do you know how this is supposed to go 
i know a few things about samurai ing 
fair enough  how about i deputize you
as my official assistant 
bad dog 
don t talk to him 
did you touch him 
time to use our hand sanitizers 
no  no  no 
doggamn it 
what kind of a world do we live in
where good and upright citizens
can t be counted on to kill someone
just because they look different 
we could try beating them up again 
only problem is they still have a samurai 
you re kidding me  right 
he s a labradork 
put his tail between his legs
and let s finish this 
okay  here goes nothing 
ooh 
ooh 
ow 
wow 
excellent 
that s right  i m a samurai now 
take that  take that  oh  yeah 
whoa 
how  bout a little nip 
a little catnip 
  i don t think i m   
  more for me 
who are you 
my friends call me jimbo 
and since i have no friends 
i guess you can call me jimbo too 
i guess it works either way 
well  jimbo  i m hank 
and i m the new samurai 
new samurai  huh 
you know  your sword s on backwards 
oh  and i suppose you know everything
because you re a samurai 
i know you re not 
  why  because i m a dog 
  no  because you re an idiot 
no real samurai
would be caught dead wearing that 
is that a bathrobe 
you get that from a hotel 
you re not a samurai  are you 
i know  right  i m not 
i came here to learn to be a samurai 
and then i got this job 
but i don t have the slightest idea
what i m doing 
is there a book 
you know  an instruction manual 
like how to be a samurai 
you mean samurai for dummies 
  yes 
  no 
that would be dumb 
ow  okay  that hurts 
okay  ow  oh  that s    agh 
you d better get out there 
it s samurai time 
you re the samurai  right 
uh  it looks a little dangerous out there 
oh  yeah  dangerous 
that s n w a  out there 
ninjas with attitude 
but you go ahead  it ll be great 
you are the samurai 
look at that 
  it s that mean old lady 
  yes  it is 
  now i have to   
  yes  you do 
maybe i could just go talk to them 
you know  work this out 
  you should do that 
  i will 
you go reason with them 
uh  excuse me 
excuse me  please 
excuse me 
get lost  dog  this is cat business 
don t listen to him 
you guys are doing a great job 
sword s still on the wrong side 
my eyes are up here 
ohh 
right in the eye 
interesting choice 
using your face to block those punches 
i wouldn t have considered that 
yeah  what do you know 
enough not to get my butt kicked 
i got to get some samurai training 
i don t think training can help you 
couldn t hurt  what am i supposed to do 
if i were you 
i would consider going home 
maybe being a lapdog 
  i can t leave 
  sure you can 
i ve got nowhere else to go 
it took everything i had to come here 
then it s   hey  get shot full of arrows
or take this job   so here i am 
i ve got to make this samurai thing work 
i have to 
but first i need to learn 
sounds like you need a mentor 
dog breath 
not mentos  mentor  a teacher 
to take you under his wing  teach you
all he knows  that kind of thing 
that s exactly what i need 
perhaps a once great samurai
who has fallen on hard times
and maybe could use some help himself 
but where could i find one 
hey  it s you 
what  get out of here  who even made that 
don t believe everything you read 
this is traditionally the place in a movie
where the hero meets his big opportunity 
you re my guy  come on  train me 
  but you re a dog 
  is that what s bothering you 
there s a lot about you
that s bothering me 
like  for instance  how you got here 
it wasn t easy  that s for sure 
i had to cross impassable seas 
unclimbable mountains
and really nasty midtown traffic 
but why do you want to be a samurai 
i was always the runt 
everybody always picked on me 
i lived in a bad neighborhood
in a bad part of town full of bad dogs 
but this day  something awesome happened 
he moved almost faster
than your eye could see 
huh 
and then he was gone 
a samurai in a strange land
took the time to help   
me 
that s why i came here 
to learn to be just like him 
i even kept his sword 
i ve been wondering where that went 
thank you 
wait a minute  that s your sword 
then that means you re   
i don t want to talk about it 
but will you train me 
  nope 
  why 
because you re so busy 
no  because you re so brainless 
i showed you my movie 
the whole flashback thing 
i don t believe it 
i m out of here 
and i never want to see you again 
you  how much did you hear 
samurai hank needs your help 
are you not bound
by your samurai oath to help him 
you mean the one that says
i can t turn my back on those in need 
yeah  that one 
no 
well  maybe 
that s not what   
stupid oath 
the cuteness is strong with this one 
  what s this 
  it is a contract
between a student  you  and a teacher  me 
uh  why do we need a contract 
because at this moment
it would be so nice if i weren t here 
and if you break this contract 
i won t be 
besides  it s very straightforward 
you swear to be brave  honorable 
protect those in need  not seek glory 
finish what you start
and always obey your master 
  the samurai oath 
  yes 
and if you break it 
our contract is broken  and you go home 
should i have my attorney
look at that first 
we don t have that kind of time 
now  sign here 
defend yourself 
what am i supposed to do with a stick 
lesson one 
it is not so important what you do
as it is important that you do something 
a warrior has catlike reflexes 
  i m not a cat  i m a dog 
  nobody s perfect 
ouch 
wait  that music 
this is the training montage  isn t it 
can t we just skip ahead
to the part where i m good 
no  this is my favorite part 
the part where you suffer 
cross the river  any way you can 
to a cat  nothing is unclimbable 
did i mention i wasn t a cat 
just make it
to the other side of the wall 
then you will be ready 
want to give me a hand 
very funny 
don t forget to land on your   
   feet 
nope 
nope 
ha 
ow  ow  ow  ow 
uh uh  nope 
no 
i m starting to think
you don t know what you re doing 
i know exactly what i m doing 
i m talking about training 
you said you could make me a samurai 
i can make you a pizza 
but i cannot make you into anything 
that power s only within yourself 
you said you would help me 
not just whack me with stuff 
i ve been whacked my whole life 
that s why i came here 
to learn to be a samurai 
hmm 
you want glory 
you know nothing of being a true samurai 
i m starting to think you don t either 
and you know what  i don t
even believe you are a real samurai  ha 
so what happened to you 
how did you go from being a samurai
to a washed up loser
who drinks too much catnip 
has an obvious weight problem 
no real friends to speak of 
is prediabetic   
that s enough 
there was a time i was chief bodyguard
of a very important official
named toshiro tytune 
he was a real cool cat 
with greatness ahead of him 
  is this a flashback 
  don t interrupt me 
if it s a flashback  you should
project it  it really brings it to life 
i don t need the projector 
it s an old fashioned remembering 
now stop interrupting 
we d been summoned to a meeting
late one night 
it was all very mysterious 
just didn t feel right 
it s an ambush  get down 
 happy birthday  
i not only ruined
the biggest night of his life 
i spayed and neutered his in laws 
i broke my samurai oath 
i was shamed 
that s why i left 
i ll make you a deal 
we ll help each other 
not helpful 
today we begin something new 
i learned
i cannot teach a dog to be a cat 
what i must do is teach a dog
to be a better dog 
what s that 
the blindfold is to help you focus 
  ah 
  now listen 
tell me what you hear 
i hear you talking and moving 
  good 
  i hear a bird 
that s it 
i smell flowers actually 
dogs have a keen sense of smell
and excellent hearing 
i hear a dragonfly 
i smell wood burning 
i smell tea brewing 
hey  are you making nachos 
 cause someone just cut the cheese 
lesson over 
well done 
in battle as in life  a samurai
strives to maintain his balance 
and always defeats strength with smart 
i can dig it 
you must control your fear 
or fear will control you 
it is a dance
in which a samurai controls his space
and his body 
what are you learning 
i don t like sticks as much as i used to 
what are you learning in here 
it s not the size of the dog in the fight 
it s the size of the fight in   
no 
it is the size of the dog in the fight 
a big dog has fewer problems 
let me demonstrate 
hold this 
see 
that wouldn t happen to a big dog 
we re still behind schedule 
the shogun will be here in three days 
oops 
i m surrounded by imbeciles 
complete morons 
it must be so hard for you 
the patience and kindness that you show 
ohga  don t take this the wrong way  okay 
but you are a total failure
and a major disappointment 
  no offense 
  none taken 
constructive criticism is always welcome 
shh  i didn t expect much of you 
and you still disappointed me 
listen 
the cats of kakamucho are no closer
to leaving than when we started 
if you can t get the job done 
perhaps it s time for a real professional 
send in the beast 
now get out 
hmm 
om 
  argh 
  do you mind 
you re harshing my mellow 
oh  sorry 
  teach me something 
  how about patience 
come on  teach me anything 
seriously  let s do this 
i m ready for it 
  how about these 
  you re not ready for those 
how hard can it be 
hyah  hwah 
ah  uh   
  ow 
  samurai hank 
sumo is in town 
  what s a sumo 
  he s a giant 
samurai hank  you have to do something 
  right 
  oh  no 
no  no  no  no  no 
no way  you are not ready  not even close 
  okay  then we ll go together 
  no  no  no 
not my job  not my fight 
and you are not prepared 
so is someone going to do something 
yeah  is someone gonna do something 
no  someone s not

not my student 
not my problem 
sword

but this is kind of my job 
i could totally take that guy 
you should know
that i am a highly trained   
mostly trained warrior 
skilled in the ways of karate
and swordplay 
as well as musical theater 
in your own best interest 
you should surrender 
you re under arrest 
wait 
uh  you ve got something on your   
sumo have edamame bean on face 
sumo very allergic 
so  we re all good then 
jimbo 
is your plan to let him hit you
until he gets tired 
  maybe 
  bold plan 
ah  here he comes 
aah 
you wanted to be a samurai  fun  isn t it 
now go get him 
you can do it  hank 
ooh wah

i m a bad dog

it was beautiful 
mm hmm  and i would say  congratulations  
but since you re already
doing that yourself 
let s get him to a doctor 
oh  yeah  absolutely  got to do that 
i might ve really hurt him 
i mean  look at him 
yah 
hi yah 
hmm 
did that hurt 
didn t feel a thing 
what about that 
nope 
hey  listen 
sorry i had to do all this to you 
sometimes i m surprised
by my own strength 
there s a new sheriff in town  all right 
better not let me catch you
breaking the law again  you feel me 
you re free to go 
no one ever beat sumo before 
no one ever nice before 
now have feelings for hank 
sumo want to live in kakamucho with hank 
well  who doesn t  safe town
like this one with great law enforcement 
  ow 
  psst  it s for you 
i wanted to say thank you
for defeating sumo 
  and you are welcome 
  only one thing 
we can never talk on the street
or anything like that 
it just wouldn t look right 
you being a    you know 
yeah  i got you 
here 
thank you  you re chuck  right 
  mmm  no 
  chuck 
  we have to go 
  i have to go 
samurai hank 
we wanted to give you something

so your mom wanted to throw me a bone 
no  my mom said to hand it to you 
why would she do that 
well  if i threw it  it might get
on the ground  all dirty and icky 
no  i meant why would she
want to give me something 
to thank you for saving our town 
you are the best dog samurai
i have ever seen 
i am the only dog samurai
you have ever seen 
but i got to say  you re kind of right 
i am mighty impressive
as far as samurais go 
are you all finished 
 cause it s getting late 
and a samurai needs his sleep 
really looks like things
are turning around for me  eh 
you got lucky  kid 
don t let it go to your head 
luck  please 
i should be registered as a lethal weapon 
pride goeth before a fall 
what do you mean  your ninjas are afraid 
um  since the dog defeated sumo 
none of my cats want   
the shogun will be here in two days 
i don t care if your ninja are afraid 
take them down to that roadblock
of a town and really just   
  you know what i ve done 
  your hair and a catty pedi 
yes  but no 
i ve outsmarted my own self
by employing that dog 
oh  nice 
me likey 
the problem with the good citizens
of kakamucho
is there are too many good citizens
in kakamucho 
it s time to take care of this mutt myself
with the ultimate weapon 
me 
sumo 
like butterfly that was once caterpillar 
fly like dandelion 
it s a hat  and this one s a boat 
that is really good 
oops  that was the hat 
  what did you make 
  a swan 
and some other stuff 
oh  wow  that s amazing 
you can make anything out of folded paper 
all right  make me a sandwich 
it s not a sandwich 
but here  i made you something 
for good luck 
looks like me 
it will always remind you of who you are 
who you are 
let s concentrate on who you are not 
and that would be a samurai 
come on  jimbo 
we re just enjoying a beautiful day 
the sun is shining  birds are singing 
and besides  i deserve a break
for taking care of sumo 
i mean  just look at him 
butterfly  oh   
that s just the point 
you have one little  itsy bitsy 
tiny weeny bite of success   
  i m sorry  tiny what 
   tiny what  what 
  what 
  what 
go ahead 
the point is 
this is no time for celebrating 
it s time to double your efforts
and train even harder 
now get to it 
hank  my brawling  battling hero 
sorry  i hope i m not bothering you  am i 
no  i was just getting a workout in 
sure 
very impressive  you defeating sumo 
oh  wow 
it was nothing

i hope you succeed in having fun
because you have failed
in everything else

the ninjas showed up again last night

  what about you 
  i failed my oath for the last time 
where s my sword 
right 
they ve taken sumo
to the fortress dungeon 
now i m going to get him back 
i ll go with you  we re both samurai and   
you are not samurai 
you were a selfish idiot 
today  you are nothing 
you just don t want to admit
that i beat sumo 
  you never   
  you really believe that 
edamame was responsible
for your greatest victory 
edamame  what does that have to do   
i failed to teach 
and you failed to learn 
i ve learned a lot from you 
like when things get tough 
you can hide in the bottom of a bottle 
i m sorry  jimbo  i    i didn t mean that 
you re on the horse backwards 
goodbye  dog 
see ya  cat 
where were you   great samurai  
hey  thanks for nothing 
 cause guess what  you did nothing 
and i m thanking you sarcastically 
good  i m out of here 
gonna get on the first boat
and get home and   
that s right  go 
  emiko 
  go back home 
maybe my mom was right 
maybe dogs can t be samurai 
  maybe i m not meant to be  
  the hero you ve been looking for  
  i did my best to try to be  
  now i m walking out your front door  
  in a world so big with a dream so tall  
  it s a hard comedown  
  it s a lonely fall to the bottom  
  and i m staring at the walls  
  now the words don t sing
like they used to do  
  and the sun don t shine  
  like it did on you  oh  darlin   
  if you re missing me at all  
  why did you believe in me   
  pass me the ball
and think that i could score  
  in a world so big with a dream so tall  
  it s a hard comedown  
  it s a lonely fall to the bottom  
  if you re missing me at all  
  i ll see you again  
  when i close my eyes  
  i know it didn t have a happy ending  
  even though we said goodbye  
  i couldn t forget you if i tried  
  couldn t forget you if i tried  
  couldn t forget you if i tried  
  couldn t forget you if i tried  
it will always remind you of who you are 
what are you doing here 
i couldn t help myself  i m a dog 
that makes me loyal 
so i m here to make things right 
you really think
you can just come back here 
and that makes everything okay 
as a matter of fact  i do 
i m back  you should be happy 
well  i m not 
you might as well turn around
and go back where you came from 
i m not going anywhere 
sumo is in there 
and i m not leaving until we get him out 
we can resolve our differences later 
what now 
you defeat strength with smart 
somebody taught me that 
um  do you have any ideas 
this is smart 
huh 
watch your back 
  you do care 
  only about saving sumo 
you i could do without 
now what 
we have to figure out a way in 
  pretty good idea  huh 
  stop wagging your tail 
i didn t say it was a good idea 
i just said it doesn t suck 
all right  genius  which way 
to the left 
what do you got 
got a d o g who s d o a 
want to get him out of sight  p d q 
a s a p  huh  okay 
i m not even a full time security guard 
i m just a temp 
let s roll  fido 
okay 
now  this could be difficult
and might take a while  so let s split up 
i ll take the areas to the north and west 
you go south and east 
let s try to be methodical about this 
there could be thousands of cells here 
and this could take hours  maybe days 
he s right over here 
hey  sumo  we re here to save you 
guess we should ve stolen some keys 
stand back 
well  at least you tried 
doggy door 
uh  complication
in the  saving him  department 
hank no need to save sumo 
sumo just prawn in ocean of life 
of course we have to save you 
you re our friend 
friends 
sumo overcome with emotion 
while i appreciate the bro fest 
we should probably get out of here 
wait a second 
i ve got to mark my territory 
we don t have time for that 
but it s a dog thing 
i want them to know i was here 
i even had asparagus last night 
we don t have time 
we have to get back to kakamucho 
when we get there  what s the plan 
at this moment 
it is not so important what we do
as it is important that we do something 
not sure yet what that something is 
remember  fear is only in your mind 
and a little bit in my kimono 
jimbo 
  jimbo  no 
  both of you get out of here 
  what about you 
  don t worry about me 
you have to get back to kakamucho 
but we re a team 
no  i have to do this 
and there is no team in i 
but there is an i in samurai 
no 
you can t die 
our issues aren t resolved yet 
heimlich maneuver 
oh 
you saved my life  but you touched me 
aw 
if that ever happens again 
let me die  okay 
now  what is it 
  the prisoner escaped 
  ah 
you let the big cat out of the bag 
didn t you 
of course you did 
right  okay 
now  someone is going to pay for this 
i m not saying who 
but probably someone very  very stupid 
do you know what a scapegoat is  ohga 
no  but if there s a goat around here 
i will have him arrested immediately 
oh  brainless  absolute   
and that goes for all of you 
anyway  never mind 
um  i already have another plan
progressing nicely 
a much bigger plan
with even more deadly consequences 
my lord  pardon the intrusion 
  what is it 
  it s the super bowl 
it s overflowing 
jiggle the handle  jiggle the handle 
where s everyone going 
emiko  what s going on 
emiko 
  emiko 
  look at this  have you read this 
  no 
  well  would you read it to me 
 help wanted  vicious killers
for the destruction of kakamucho 
prior criminal record a must 
an equal opportunity employer  
can t you see this is
just the last act of a desperate cat 
we don t care
if it s the first act of mamma mia 
we re leaving before that army gets here 
right  how are we doing  let s see 
cutthroats  good 
bounty hunters  desperados 
biker gangs  excellent 
mugs  thugs  nitwits  dimwits 
mobsters  muggers  bushwhackers 
hornswogglers  serial killers   
studio executives 
wow  it looks like everyone s here  great 
what about him 
well  yes  he is scary 
but in the wrong way 
arrest him 
wait  wait  please  hear me out 
you all need to know something 
in an heroic effort to protect your town 
today we lost jimbo 
no  no  not jimbo 
  who s jimbo 
  i don t know 
  didn t he date your sister 
  no  that was gumbo 
why did you even come back 
we re leaving  hank 
we re all gonna start new lives
somewhere else 
sure  go 
after all  you re cats 
you ve got nine lives  right 
but i m a dog  i have one life 
and the best thing that happened to me
in this one life
is this town 
you had faith in me  you trusted me 
and i want to earn that trust back so bad 
i m willing to lay my one life down
for your  uh   
let s see  247 times 9 
um  and then carry the 5   
2 223 
  2 000 
  223 
right  now what do you say 
life is short 
and this movie is only 85 minutes long 
not including end credits 
so we have to hurry 
if we re gonna save this town 
we have to find a way
beyond judging each other strictly on
labels like  dog  and  cat  
together  we can get past all that 
we can all be better
together 
it s a metaphor 
saying we are all the same 
look different on the outside 
but we can choose for ourselves
what our insides look like 
see now 
the big guy makes a lot of sense 
right  so  sumo  what do we do now 
so what do we do 
well  step one 
we need to destroy
their lines of communication 
i ve cut the telephone line 
step two 
someone taught me
that we can make anything
out of folded paper 
hmm 
how s everyone doing  feeling evil  yeah 
don t be stingy
with the poison on those arrows 
everyone get plenty to eat 
you can t crush the innocent
on an empty stomach  can you 
enjoy the entrée
because dessert is death and destruction 
who knew an evil army
could go through so many beans 
right  assemble the troops 
ah  the smell of victory in the air 
go 
go  my terrible army 
go to kakamucho and do your worst 
oh  and don t forget 
save your receipts 
the signal  they re coming 
they re coming 
it s showtime 
all right  everyone knows what to do 
this is the best bit  isn t it 
waiting for the death and destruct   
nah  the best bit
is the death and destruct   
this is the second best bit 
kakamucho is going out of business 
everything must go 
ah  yes 
go  team  go 
they re falling for it 
they re falling for it 
  ichiro 
  i m right here

for elevation and wind  and two   
  got to watch for birds 
  whoops

i was shamed  my lord 
i am so  so sorry

and the stuff with your in laws 
my in laws  oh

so you forgive me 
forgiven  forgotten  no biggie 
hey  life s short  like me  let s move on 
so  what s up with the dog 
that  dog  was defending kakamucho 
a dog defending the town  why 
because lord ika here
was trying to get rid of it 
don t believe him 
i was just trying to get rid of that dog 
you see  nike shoe was only
trying to get rid of the dog 
but  sir  that dog
isn t what you think he is 
he isn t 
i m not following you 
can someone else explain this 
ai low me 
ika chu wanted to get rid of the dog
because he was getting
in the way of his plan
to frighten the cats of kakamucho
so that he could
wipe their town off the map
in order to make his palace
absolutely perfect 
wha    
did i leave anything out 
brains 
well  peek a boo 
what do you got to say for yourself 
you want an explanation

a little more samurai ing to do 
huh 
oh 
ugh

i have something very important
to tell you  hank 
what is it 
i am your father 
  no  you re not 
  no  i m not 
i distracted you 
i m certainly not about
to get outwitted by a stupid dog
who s not even a real samurai 
oh  but you re wrong  i am a real samurai 
i got a cup right here that says so 
grab on

kakamucho 
  what can we do 
  we don t have much time 
we ve got to do something 
one  please 
guys  you got to help me 
the giant toilet is overflowing 
have you tried to jiggle the handle 
too late for that  but i have an idea 
we re listening 
but you better make it snappy 
we ve had our differences 
but the times
we ve actually worked together
we ve accomplished a lot 
so if you trust me 
i think we can save the town 
  that was pretty snappy 
  what do you want us to do 
dig 
but cats don t dig 
okay  so you don t dig  can you swim 
you heard him  dig 
hurry up 
no 
where are they 
help  help 
help 
emiko 
i ve got you 
well  that pretty much wraps things up 
almost 85 minutes exactly 
all that s left is appointing
a new samurai for kakamucho 
well  what do you say  jimbo 
me  my lord 
hey  why not 
i can t think of anyone better  can you 
i can  kakamucho already has a samurai 
the dog 
he can t be a samurai 
he can t be anywhere  it s the law 
you know the rules   no dogs allowed  
it s not personal  it s just business 
and you know what they say 
there s no business   
   like shogun business 
exactally 
but he s not a dog 
he s   
he s my friend 
  and more than that  he s our samurai 
  he is 
that s what i was trying to tell you 
wow  you live nine lives 
you get to see everything 
who knew  a dog samurai 
hank is not a dog samurai 
hank is a great samurai 
a truly great samurai 
woof  woof  woof  woof 
then i dub thee town samurai of kakamucho 
actually 
you already officially appointed him 
i did 
yeah  i had an official samurai cup
and everything 
oh  well  if you had an official cup
and everything   
and i don t know what that means   
but i bet you don t have
an official sword 
wait  please wait 
thank you  but i can t accept this honor 
  why not 
  yeah  why not 
i have a contract with my teacher
that says
i haven t yet finished my training 
but there is someone else
that s most deserving of this honor 
emiko 
you are a true samurai 
  the little one 
  yes  my lord 
she s always defended the town 
i will carry it with honor 
i know you will 
so how does it feel
to be a real samurai 
good  but not as good as it will feel
someday when i m the shogun 
the shogun  you 
you know something 
that ain t such a bad idea  sure  why not 
and i got to tell you 
it s good to be the shogun 
milk s on me 
kind of warms your heart  doesn t it 
  ow  what s that for 
  defend yourself 
wait  wait  stop 
  time out  stop 
  no 
  that hurts 
  got you again 
ha ha    ow 
how does that feel 
this is my favorite part 
the part where you suffer 
  who s the coolest cat in all the land   
  hank s his name  
  who s got the moves
nobody understands   
  hank s got game  
  don t have to mark his territory  
  he s got his own theme
and origin story  
  hank   
  he s the coolest cat  
  who thinks justice is its own reward   
  hank sure does  
  all the ladies love his giant sword  
  and his fuzz  
  he ll sneak up on you just like a fox  
  so smooth he don t need a litter box  
    he s  
    hank   
  he s the coolest cat  
  never fear  oh  
  he s there when duty calls  
  he s a hero  
  who s got the biggest heart  
  and even bigger hairballs  
  h a n k  hank   
there s lots of cats
in this world  but nobody chases tail   
his own  or anybody else s   
as good as hank 
  yeah  we know it  
it s like he s got nine lives 
and he s living them all at the same time
and to the fullest 
  he won t blow it  
  sure  he s kind of scrawny
and should go to the gym  
  but he s got a certain je ne sais quoi  
  say what   
  some bullies were
mercilessly picking on him  
    till a samurai appeared and  
    saved his butt  
  so now he s
on a mission to be a big deal  
  gonna make some evildoers
taste his steel  
  you re much safer
when this cat s nearby  
  me ee ow  
  try to fight this cat
the fur will fly  
  pow  pow  pow   
  if someone dares to break the law  
  they ll face the fury of the paws of  
  hank   
  his coat has got a healthy sheen  
    nobody licks himself as clean as  
    hank   
  he sees the world in black and white  
     a canine samurai  that s right  he s  
  what  a canine 
hank is a dog 
i thought we were singing about a cat 
he s the coolest cat
who happens to be a dog 
no  uh uh  no way  we re out of here 
a slobbery dog can t be no samurai 
please 
hold your head high  hank 
 cause you re gonna show  em all 
  that even with the bones you chew  
  and your breath
that smells like doggy doo  
  there s a lot for them
to like about you
