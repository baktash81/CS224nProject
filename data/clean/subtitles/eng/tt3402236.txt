two perfect eggs this time  no 
maybe 
i blame the chicken 
why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes 
it s not you    mon amie  
these are two perfectly cooked eggs 
mr  poirot   
i have got 3 religions bent on riot 
if you are going to perform one of
your miracles  the time is now 
have the eggs 
poirot 
sorry for the  um   
it is not the   
it is the imbalance of the   
right 
that s better 
excuse me  let s move on
make way  please 
for the accused 
the rabbi   
the priest   
and the imam 
it is like the   
old joke  yes 
the rabbi  the priest and the imam 
forgive me  i m belgian 
so  let us begin 
in the church of the
holy sepulcher above us 
three representatives meet
under the supervision   
of the chief inspector of the police to
discuss a divided timetable for market use 
one hour after this tense meeting   
a priceless relic is found to be stolen 
it is said one of
these three men has stolen it 
the police find no pieces
of evidence at all 
i find one 
on the meticulously well
kept wall of a fresco   
a single crack from an
indelicate client  
with a hard soled
shoe or perhaps a boot 
so  ladies and gentlemen 
we must ask   
who stands to benefit from the crime 
our three holy men live humbly 
they have thin
soled shoes  poor 
sudden riches
and rubies would be   
too conspicuous  yes  to enjoy 
they do not getting it 
at this point  we need  an armed
guard at the south gate 
thank you very much 
now  the only one   
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes   
is a man whose office i
had searched this morning   
as i waited  i have to tell you 
rather disappointed upon my breakfast 
difficulty with the eggs 
you don t need to know this 
a man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in jerusalem 
i mean  of course  the
chief inspector of the police 
a man who does not wish to
lose a well paid post   
when there is discussion among the
local people of self governance   
who does wear boots  and
do i believe now does regret   
inviting me to consult on this case 
how dare you accuse me 
police sergeant   
did you search the
office as i asked 
ah    yes sir 
and did you find what
i said you might 
yes sir  just as you said 
you must deliver that to the  captain 
it ll be the first thing in the morning 
i got it sir 
luggage is on board  sir 
i want the right to
escort you to your boat 
to istanbul  then 
will you be back to london straight off 
i m tired  and i ve
earned myself a little holiday 
i want to look at paintings
and have too much time on my hands 
you re staring  does it stop 
it s just   
how did you know it was him  sir 
from just a tiny crack on the wall 
i have the advantage   
i can only see the
world as it should be 
and when it is not 
the imperfection stands out   
like the nose in the
middle of a face 
it makes most of life unbearable 
but it is useful in the
detection of crime 
but it s just like you see  em through their
hearts  and divine their true natures 
and whatever people say  there
is right there is wrong 
there is nothing in between 
we must part here 
no  sir  i am to escort you on ferry 
we must never meet again 
could you straighten your tie please 
just a little 
  yes
  that is perfect 
final passengers  please 
i am sorry 
we ll be reached soon 
but    will it be fixed in time 
we are working 
i have a connection in istanbul 
leaves tomorrow at seven 
there is a very ill patient
waiting for me in london

 hercule poirot  i do not slay
the lions  mademoiselle  
mary debenham monsieur  i will
forget a name  but never a face 
not yours  any way 
you come from baghdad 
it s true 
no detail escapes his notice 
your ticket 
i might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there   
as a governess 
the chalk on your sleeve
and the geography primar 
a governess or a cartographer 
i made my gamble 
i always begin them with geography   
and monster them until they
have the world down cold 
they may get lost in life   
but i ll be damned if they
don t know where they are 
well our chains are free 
right on time 
i feel so free out here in the water 
i wish i could enjoy it 
  you should be out of this  mary 
  not now 
when it s all over 
when it s done 
then nothing can touch us 
istanbul
my holiday begins here 
i can see the soul of the
city in these humble breads 
the world insists on
destruction  yet here   
masterpieces are baked
to order every day

poirot  whom i knew before the esteem 
hercule poirot  this is   
  a prostitute 
  she is 
i am  bouc  you did not tell me
you had such famous friends 
we are friends because i
am the only person

being a terrible person 
indeed you are 
madame  bouc  please join me
for a drink  yes

i ride on the orient express at seven 
official director business 
uncle pays me absurdly to stay
on board his gorgeous train   
and far away from him   
at the home office   
consigned to wine and
dine in handsome   
there is an art to nepotism 
and you are his michelangelo 
mr  poirot

  welcome sir

number three is unlucky 
apologies  madame 
i meant no disrespect to you 
oh  you could try to mean a little  
one thing about train travel
you re always knocking into somebody 
it is wonderful 
although i am looking
always to getting back 
travel is my
spicy food  mosques  meeting men   
eventually just miss your own bed 
i have been accused of
husband hunting abroad 
and i can t honestly deny it  
i like my time alone  i do 
but a lady has certain needs that deserve
to be met  if she has any money   
and preferably  on a regular basis 
oh my  fire in the kitchen 
see you later  madame 
good evening 
number nine 
good evening 
how you doing 
no  after you 
ah  number three 
who is it  ah  mr  mcqueen 
yeah  i think you might
have the wrong birth 
excuse me  is there a problem  sir 
no problem 
the train is full 
and i think that we are 
how do you say   bunkies  
really 
i am equally disappointed in you 
this is nice 
come along  darlings 
no 
no 
this 
why my    unpacked 
final call for passengers 
shall we brush it 
what the hell is taking them so long 
soon as we re getting out of
here  have them make up the bed 
it s already fixed  mr  ratchett 
no  i want the bed made 
and bring my dictaphone 
dogs on the table  it s
the most disgust able
thing i ve ever seen in a while 
  yes sir 
  i want you to get mcqueen   
and have him bring every
receipt from the milan sale 
  i want you to get it done 
  yes sir 
i want you to get it done now

good evening  mrs  hubbard 
hello  mr  masterman 
well  hello 
eyes linger any longer  i ll
have to charge rent 
i ll pay 
have another drink 
are you insulted 
disappointed 
some men have a good look 
all they have to do is   
keep their mouth shut  and
they can take on any prize they want 
still  the mouth opens 
is everything alright  mrs  hubbard 
you have a strong intuition  i know 
my second husband used to say just so 
hold that  he was my first 
yeah 
brightest man i ve ever met 
face like a turnip  but
i loved that turnip 
it was nice to talk 
excuse me 
goodnight 
mr  poirot breakfast 
when you take supper   
i ll move mr  mcqueen to
monsieur bouc s compartment 
you will travel first class  monsieur 
  bon apetite 
  and the eggs 
good afternoon 
ah  mrs  hubbard 
good afternoon 
there we are 
  complements of the orient express 
  thank you  mr  bouc 
i am here for all of your needs 
no thank you  i do not drink 
i do not agree with you 
sin doesn t agree with me 
vice is where the devil
finds his darlings 
we should no longer speak 
good afternoon 
monsieur  how about an appetizer 
i regret i have an appointment
with the director of the train 
he was gonna leave anyway 
please sir 
all settled in 
as advertised 
and yet  the best things
on the train are not food 
you know  there is something about a   
a tangle of strangers pressed together
for days  with nothing in common   
but they need to go from
one place to another   
and never see each other again 
boredom  plus anonymity  plus   
constant gentle rocking 
with your hobbies  you ll
never amount to anything 
god i hope so 
oh give me the fish 
exchange grouper for soul 
es carole for the potato  and   
the beef sauce for the veloutã copyright  
garcon  that sounds superb 
the same for me 
the princess dragomiroff 
you know  if i had the word to marry for
money i would marry for that much money 
i brushed dalia this morning 
no  you tortured my darling doggy 
i asked you to brush her 
you still enjoying your dickens 
very much  mon amie 
you know  with your books and your capers 
you re missing out on romance 
the romance never goes unpunished 
there was   
there was someone once 
i would prefer into future i
to be sit not with that man 
like should be seated with like 
we are not alike 
not all of us are so concerned with
the separation of races  professor 
it is out of respect for all kinds
that i prefer to keep them separated 
to mix your red wine and the
white  would be to ruin them both 
i like a good rose 
hey  how you doing 
would you mind   
if i join you 
dessert is an indulgence   
and i feel kind of silly
stupid  indulging alone 
i am at my happiest alone 
but   
for a piece of your
fragility  pleased to join you 
oh my  excuse me  another fork 
i have been trying to
make your acquit mr  poirot 
i never ever sat so
close to fame before me 
now i tell a lie 
once i was in a bus with ty cobb 
ball player  detroit 
would you mind if i have the little
curly bit at the top 
you are not a bird though 
a strange peculiar man 
i am of a age where i know what i like
and what i do not like 
what i like  i enjoy enormously 
what i dislike  i can not abide 
for an instance 
the temporary pleasantries before
what is determined to be
a business discussion 
you re fun 
all right 
i would like to offer you a job 
 the avenger of the innocents  
that s what they call you in the papers 
you are an innocent 
i am a businessman 
i am an art dealer 
i mean  i am new to it 
but my beginner s luck
has worked out 
relics  antiquities 
rugs  rare  orientals 
i m new to the game  so  you
know  i got the amateur eye ball 
but i got a little problem with the   
so called praises 
you can t trust a one 
some of my customers   
they buy a piece   
they find out they are
not exactly original   
which is not really my fault   
if a kashan silk scarf is a fake 
right 
but i ve managed to make
a few enemies  it s the thing 
got a few letters 
people making threats 
and most likely it s the italians 
i sold them a set of
oriental carpets in milan 
and the buyers weren t so happy
with the providence 
and they want their money
back with interest  you know 
italians 
a guinea is guinea 
and then comes along
the genius detective 
me 
  yes you  hercules poirot 
  hercule 
here is what i d like to do 
i would like to hire you
to watch my back   
until i get someplace safe 
it s easy money for you 
and it s peace of mind
for me  you know 
  i understand 
  good 
i refuse 
that s bad 
i didn t make
myself clear enough 
you see  someone is out to get me 
and i know i m not the best   
not by a long shot 
and if there is a world after this  where i
will face judgment  just like you 
but   
i ain t in no goddamn rush to do it 
  you are holding a gun at me 
  no 
not you  on the world 
i exist in the world 
do not point the gun at me 
how does ten thousand sound for a week 
it s a generous offer mr rachette 
i must decline 
  fifteen thousand 
  you didn t hear me  i declined 
oh  i get it 
it s not flashing out for the
great hercules poirot  huh 
not new flash books   
you sell fakes to gangsters 
you re suffering the consequences 
i detect criminals 
i do not protect them 
so you are saying no
to my dirty money 
i say no to you  mr  ratchett 
business with the gun  right 
is that what it was 
this is far more personal than that 
i do not like your face 
if you ll excuse me   
you liked my cake  didn t ya 
the cake was excellent 
have a pleasant afternoon  mr  ratchett 
thank you 
how cold 
mossier katherine 
mon amie 
mr  dickens 
mr  ratchett 
mr  ratchett 
yeah  mossier 
goodnight 
mrs  hubbard 
it s always mrs  hubbard 
mrs  hubbard 
did we die 
ladies and gentlemen 
the train has been derailed 
you alright  mr  marquez 
i m fine  thank you 
mr  bouc will speak to you   
all clear 
are we going to die 
my katherine 
my beautiful   
ladies and gentlemen  i m afraid that
our train is still unable to go anywhere 
yeah  except down 
how long are we supposed to just figure 
yes  someone must be doing something 
of course i m doing something 
i am doing nothing 
precisely two hours and ten minutes ago 
when we didn t arrive in
broad as scheduled   
the station master will have
surmised our situation   
and already sent a team
to excavate the engine   
clear our path and send us on our way 
until then  i assure you   
we will all be made warm 
and  fed and comfortable 
we could walk 
we could die of exposure trying 
i have a connection to make 
my boat sails the day after
tomorrow  from france 
without you  i would wedger 
or me in london 
i hold you accountable for
my loss of time  mr  bouc 
madame  you can t hold me
accountable for the weather 
of course  i can 
you are the one here 
and my conference in turin 
and i was to meet a
factory in sochaux 
yes  some things   
they are in god s hands 
it is not for us to say  
if we deserve to arrive
safely to our destination   
or if  like lucifer 
we must fall 
breakfast for you  mr  ratchett 
ah  bonjour  mr  masterman 
there is problem 
i can t say  sir 
mr  ratchett 
that is cold air 
please bring mr  bouc immediately 
and also dr  arbuthnot 
good god 
touch nothing else 
only the body 
by god  this is horrible 
first the snow and now   
i ll have to meet with the police and
make some statement in some grimy station 
and a man has died 
and a man has died 
he was stabbed 
long straight edge knife 
multiple stab wounds  some shallow
some cut clean through muscle 
left hand side or right hand side 
that s the thing 
it appears that the killer maybe
closed his eyes and struck blind 
could you estimate the time of death 
it s hard to say
with the window opened   
but my best guess is
between midnight and 2 00 
but no one went to his compartment 
and i sat on my seat all night 
i would have seen if someone came 
it s impossible 
thank you doctor 
please return to the dining car 
michel  secure this carriage 
poirot 
i need your help  my friend 
you have to find who did this 
please  i employ you on behalf
of the orient express 
when the police arrives we can
present them with a case closed 
you are the only one who can save me 
your faith touches me  mon cher 
but i must held this rest 
well  think of it as a little
beach time puzzle 
that s nothing to your mind 
you look up the antecedents
of the passengers 
you will establish the boniface
and then do what you do 
you sit in a chair
and you eat your cake   
and you think  until the
solution present itself 
what else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow 
without constant stimulation 
your little grey cells will starve and die 
do you think that is what i do 
i sit in the chair   
i have a little piece of cake
and then i come up with a  
  i don t know what are you do 
  i have my dickens 
damn your dickens 
if we leave this to the police 
they will choose a culprit   
right or wrong  and
then they ll hang him 
most probably mr  marquez   
for no other reason  than
his name is marquez 
or dr  arbuthnot  for
the color of his skin 
you are the only one
who can bring justice 
  let me have a map of this coach 
  of course 
  every passport 
  anything 
interviews arranged with
all of the passengers 
evidence  order and method 
until one culprit emerges 
i do not approve of
murder  my friend 
every day we meet people the world
could have better without yet   
we do not kill them 
we must be better than the beasts 
so let us find this killer 
ladies and gentlemen 
allow me to   
it appears that  our
bad luck has worsened 
that is   
a passenger has
died on the train 
monsieur ratchett 
looks like they got him after all 
do you assume he was killed 
no  no 
i just meant he was in
perfectly good health 
he had his enemies  that s all 
indeed he did  he was murdered 
oh god  a murder here 
alas  madame 
god rest his soul 
someone was rummaging around my
cabin in the middle of the night 
nobody would believe me 
what is going on 
as we are snowbound  i have
elected to take the case   
and find for my friend 
monsieur bouc  the criminal 
and why you 
my name is hercule poirot   
and i m probably the greatest
detective in the world 
i will speak to all of you in time 
for the moment   
i must recommend that you remain in
your compartment with the doors locked 
i feel like a prisoner here 
it is for your own safety 
if there was a murder   
then there was a murderer 
the murderer is with us   
on the train  now 
the doors between coaches
were locked at night   hmm 
absolutely  done myself 
the train s been searched 
there is no one hiding on it or under it 
we can therefore limit our investigation
to the occupants of the calais coach 
bouc  you ll assist me 
as the only traveler who
slept in another coach  
you are the only one
who is not a suspect 
mr  mcqueen  is it
really the time for drinking 
my boss is dead 
i am out of the job  and you re
looking at me like i did it 
we make no accusations 
you knew him  so from you we
need the essential facts 
were you his relative 
no  his secretary 
booked his travel 
ordered his steaks 
man ate more steaks than i
have ever seen in my entire life 
he was in antiques 
he had no qualifications for it 
not the eye  quite the languages 
truth is  he had no head for business 
accounting   
none of it 
i took care of everything 
how long were you in his employ 
twenty days short of a year 
prohibition wasn t to my taste   
so i found myself overseas  and in debt 
i m a lawyer by education   
not disposition 
he was incompetent in that 
you were fond of him 
i was fond of his money 
ratchett was crude   
demanding  insulting 
and most likely a felon 
when did you last see him 
it must have been just after 10 00 
he called me in to go over
our sales in italy 
milan  the sale of forgeries 
yeah  yeah 
he wanted to look over the accounts 
i had to translate everything else 
the contracts were in french
and he didn t speak a word 
and when we stopped at vinkovci   
i struck up a chat with
the colored doctor  arbuthnot 
we had a couple of
drinks  stretch our legs 
he had some   
odd opinions about stalin
i had to turn around 
i don t hold the man s race against him 
but i don t often take the britishers 
when did your party end 
yeah    he left just after 2 00 
did you know of any specific
enemies ratchett might have had 
gosh 
pick a number 
you confide that he have been threatened 
he got a couple of nasty letters 
i have them  if you like 
some  at least 
he    threw up the rest 
he threw them into the fire 
merci  mr  mcqueen 
thank you 
if we have any further questions 
we will call for you again 
have you consider the latin man marquez 
hell of a guy man 
and  well  you know  his kind   
they don t have the same distest
for murder  historically speaking 
you said you don t hold a
man s race against him 
i suppose   
depends on the race 
he was doing so well 
  do you think it s mcqueen 
  too early to say 
i admit  i can t see him
stabbing a man 12 times in a frenzy 
not sober  any way 
who did it then 
i do not know yet 
it s time we ask 
  ask  who 
  the victim 
he has 12 stab wounds and as
arbuthnot said they are patternless 
if the doctor is guilty   
he certainly didn t let his
influence his responsibility 
hey  the watch 
stopped at 1 15 
that agrees with the the doctor
on the time of death 
it is possible  yes 
certainly possible 
  i don t quite understand 
  well  i do not understand myself 
i understand nothing at all 
if you look at these two wounds   
they are powerful and deep 
and yet there is little blood 
but this was a frenzy attack 
lashing here and there  no pattern
at all  just extreme violence 
and during all this  our victim 
vigorous  and anxious and full of coffee   
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle   
when he also has here   
the means by which he might
defend himself 
for you 
now  let us see 
barbital  the mickey sleep 
they drugged him so
he could not use this 
and let her around here
a ladies handkerchief 
an object de luxe  handmade  boom 
two hundred francs in paris 
and she even has an initial   h  
  and our little friend  the pipe cleaner 
  another clue 
yes  a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently 
yet only one appears  however 
to be perhaps genuine 
and maybe this ashtray provides
the accidental bread crumb 
the charred fragment of a note 
an attempt  perhaps 
to burn the evidence 
he may borrow your
equipment    yes 
thank you 
now  i quick up to understand   
why a clue is left rather than
of what the object is 
we seek the truth from
within  not with out 
in this case  however  i may
welcome a little scientific assistance 
you will adjust the flame 
not one of those nasty letters 
you re mistaken  mon amie
this one has a secret to tell 
look 
 as a strong blood is
on hand  you will die  
what does this mean 
come with me  bouc 
let us fill in the gaps 
this was never a beach side puzzle 
i know the dead man s real name 
it is not ratchett  but cassetti 
i know that name 
then you will also know the
name armstrong 
the armstrong case 
history shook the world 
two years ago   
the renowned pilot 
colonel john armstrong   
and his wife  sonia  woke to find
their only child  little daisy   
desperate   
the armstrongs paid the ransom 
but soon after  daisy
was found murdered by   
ratchett  who was cassetti 
sonia armstrong was with child
when she received the news 
the shock sent her into
premature labor 
neither she  nor her baby survived 
how do you know this  poirot 
because john armstrong
told me so himself 
he wrote to me to ask me for my help 
by the time i received the letter   
it was too late 
he was found dead of a gunshot wound 
self inflicted 
 daisy armstrong s blood is on
your hands  you will die for it  
indeed you did 
  monsieur poirot 
  yes  michel 
mrs  hubbard wants to talk to you 
i held her as best as i could 
uh  mrs  hubbard  i am
sorry to have kept you 
you have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words 
you goddamn right i do 
what i have been trying to   
to tell you all day 
the murderer with in my
compartment last night 
i thought i would be killed 
turns out i might have been   
only he got rachette instead 
i woke up in the dark and i knew
there was a man in my room 
you were certain it was a man 
i know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom 
i told your conductor  and he
wouldn t believe me 
i said   check the communicating door
between my room and ratchett s  
 he must have left through there  
sure enough  it was unbolted 
i know i locked it after   
what ratchett said 
he made a rather
daring proposal 
have you perhaps    
heard about the
armstrong kidnapping 
you couldn t avoid it 
morbid stuff 
the child s murderer  cassetti   
died last night 
ratchett was that man 
i told you  i knew
he was a rotten one 
you do believe me    
about the man in my room 
i am aware that you
think i m a silly woman 
but i have proof that it s true 
might have fallen off michel
when he was in your room 
i m not missing it 
i found it at the foot of
my bed  on the cover   
right where i slept 
what do you call that 
i call it evidence 
thank you very much  mrs  hubbard 
have you ever been to america 
once 
years ago  briefly 
for what purpose 
  to confirm a suspicion 
  which was 
that i wouldn t like it 
i was offered a post in boston 
from boston went straight back to london 
  is that where rachette was from  boston 
  i don t know 
it wouldn t be proper   
to ask 
carry on 
the last i saw   
mr  ratchett at nine o clock 
i brought his coffee and
hung up his clothes 
you have the tooth ache i think 
i have got an extraction
booked in london this week 
mr  ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer 
he said he was tired of hearing
my suppressed groans 
this sympathetic ratchett 
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night 
not at all 
but he had been very agitated lately 
he said he wanted to stay alert 
especially through the last night 
he found a letter in his compartment 
please tell me you didn t do this 
if i am to leave something
unpleasant on your pillow  sir   
it would not be a letter 
coffee 
surely such a   
profound and precise valet   
would never speak to his master
how you did 
unless he knew his career was
coming to a sudden   
end 
not mere tooth ache i think 
the lungs 
the thyroid 
spread now to stomach 
ends with my father  five years younger 
months have passed 
 inoperable  i am afraid  
said the doctor 
suddenly i wasn t afraid 
i would only do what i wanted 
i speak my mind now 
the coffee 
it appears that his cup was
mixed with the barbital 
you of course  would tell me
that you did not put it in there 
of course i did not 
when and from where did you
procure the coffee and the cups 
in the kitchen  sir 
i ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9  and so it was 
anyone could have
got hold of it before me 
mr  masterman 
i m sorry about the tooth ache 
i love the little cakes 
so  miss pilar estravados 
you are a missionary   
but you ve trained as a nurse
before you change profession  yes 
i owed it to god 
you owed him a debt 
there were   
indulgent times in my life   
when i took more than i gave 
gerhard hardman 
professor of engineering 
it is science that will
win back for germany her pride 
mr  marquez  listen  i want to be clear
of any association with the crime   
so please ask me anything 
anything  i never lie anymore 
did you leave your compartment
at all last night 
only once  to get an aspirin 
mrs  hubbard offered me something earlier 
i declined it first
but when i could not rest   
i went to ask for it 
my conference is in turin 
i am the only austrian
to present  which means without me   
the talks would be sub standard 
then i escaped prison  and i drived myself
into the united states   
where i swore never to
lie or steal again 
you see my friends  because when
people trust you  they buy more 
the italians are cows 
the spaniards  sheep 
the belgians   
nothing  i come to my room  which i share
with the unhappy english butler 
annoying  he    groans a lot 
but i am sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning 
i should say   
in case it is relevant 
there was an embarrassing moment 
when i went to see mrs  hubbard   
first i opened the wrong door 
i am sorry 
what time was this 
that must have been about   
don t be sorry 
twenty minutes to 11 00 
this is interesting 
as far as it is known  you was the
last person to see ratchett alive 
  your business 
  automobiles 
i have three showrooms 
i come to america with nothing 
and now   
if what you say is true  miss
debnham will confirm it 
but it is true 
i would not lie 
i would not lie 
may it be possible that miss debenham left
your compartment without you noticing 
no  i sleep very lightly 
with the slightest sound
i woke up right 
i was surprised once 
never again 
no  i didn t say i was a chauffeur 
the photographs that spilled
out of your luggage  
there was a beautiful one  the
little boy  wearing a chauffeur s hat   
visiting his papa at work 
who did you chauffeur 
ms  estrada  why do your
hands have a calluses of a boxer 
i do my work in dangerous cities   
where i can not be governed by fear 
i trained to fight 
but you do not you trust your god anymore 
since you had surprise 
no  in case he is busy 
god is always busy 
it s masterman 
a man dying he is the man
with nothing to lose 
bravo  bouc 
except for the problem of mr  marquez   
who has now confirmed that his
bunk mate  masterman   
was reading in his bed
at the time of death 
if it were easy  i would not be famous 
next 
miss debenham   
you do not mind to brace the air 
for you  we have the picnic 
oh  you made my room mate
suffer cramped    i see 
use the best location to extract
the truth from each suspect 
put her off balance  me freeze 
clever 
will you write on your full
name and address please 
a pale move by the way 
ms  estravados told me you
asked the the color of her dressing gown 
 mary hermione debenham  
do you ever go by hermione 
a constant marry when i m not employed
as  miss debenham   left handed 
unusual  i know 
you mustn t have your theory fixed
if you are testing my handwriting 
what did you think of the dead man 
i can t say  i didn t
think about him 
don t quite see the point of your question 
forgive me  mademoiselle  they
are my little originalities 
human nature is perverse
in its complexity 
to plumb it  it takes the right tools 
these are toys  not tools  hercule 
and i prefer that you put them away 
the direct method  parfait 
you knew the doctor before traveling 
dr  arbuthnot 
no 
but such an instant attraction 
we are not in america   
miss debenham  there are
no laws against what you may feel 
nor are there laws against
silence  of which   
i m hold my   
i have never been to america 
perhaps i may ask about some   
words i ve overheard 
you and the stranger  arbuthnot 
are closer than strangers might be 
you said 
 not now  when we re done 
then no one can touch us 
what did you mean 
do you think i made a murder 
to a man with a hammer 
every problem is a nail 
you live crime 
  you see evil every day 
  no so 
i see enough crimes to know that
the criminal act is the anomaly 
i think it takes a fracture
off with a soul   
to murder another human being 
i ask again  what did you mean 
as we established   
there are no laws against my silence 
very well 
and afterward  princess dragomiroff 
after dinner  i went to bed 
god blessed me with long life   
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable 
about close to 1 00   
i called for frãoulein schmidt 
she massaged me   
and read me for a while  then i sleep 
were you ever acquainted with   
a family by the name of armstrong 
they endured an unspeakable tragedy 
i was an admirer of sonia
armstrong s mother   
linda arden  the actress 
a once a century talent 
miss arden was to do acting 
she would have become the first
woman titan of broadway   
were it not for the tragedy 
and this  linda arden  she s dead 
she might as well be 
she no longer leaves her home 
daisy was my goddaughter 
she was   
i don s see how this relates
to our trouble  detective 
the man  killed last night 
his true name was cassetti 
the man who murdered
little daisy armstrong 
i see 
i admit  i know this family 
and now that man is dead 
the coincidence   
must seem unbearable 
you may be permitted a coincidence 
i must now ask a few questions
of you froulein schmidt 
no  there is no need 
i can answer to her character 
even still  if you will allow 
froulein please answer in german 
but your excellency does not understand 
that s what it is about 
is this yours 
h of hildegarde 
that is silk 
it s too fine for me 
is this the truth about last night 
as she said 
she sent the inspector to look for me   
then i went back to bed 
did you see someone when he returned 
only the other inspector 
one who was   
 the other conductor  
you mean michel 
no  a different one 
please come 
are you sure you didn t see him 
i m certain  the other conductor was a
small man with a short beard 
froulein  there is no other conductor 
i know what i saw 
i remember because his voice was high
and the uniform was same exactly 
although i suspect missing one button 
sir  i need your pass key immediately 
we need to find a uniform
and a red kimono 
thousands of photographs 
any less pair of socks   
dressing gowns in every colors  but red   
still no contraband conduct his uniform 
have we already checked all the
passenger of luggage 
all except for the count and
the countess andrenyi  monsieur 
it is forbidden to search their suitcases 
they travel under diplomatic visas 
where else could be 
there is one last suitcase
we have not checked 
my own 
the killer is mocking me 
good  his first mistake 
and as the night must follow the day   
no  it s not mine 
i told you of the conductor 
  why would i tell you if it was me 
  you would not   
which makes your compartment
the ideal place to hide it 
voila  the button 
and if the conductor s uniform   
why not a conductor s pass key 
now we know how the killer
magically passed through locked doors 
  bourbon 
  mcqueen 
now what are we looking for 
five hundred pounds 
mcqueen also had a ledger
all his dealings with rachette 
where is it 
poirot 
bouc  keep everyone inside 
please  stop 
mossier  stay where you are 
thank you gentlemen  thank you 
so  it was mcqueen 
you have your man 
how could he 
i didn t kill him  
you tried to burn rachette s accounts   
but there are illegibly places 
the maths do not tally   
because you have been
stealing from him 
it is full of the   
the    the english word 
the chocolate 
  fudge 
  fudge  it is full of the fudge 
you stole from him 
you thought you would be found out 
that is why you killed him 
yeah 
yeah  you are damn right 
i stole from him 
thousands 
i knew his money wasn t honest 
who wondered it would matter
if i skimmed some of the top 
but let me ask you a question 
why would i slaughter my cash cow 
i didn t do it 
  i didn t kill him 
  he didn t 
he didn t 
i expect his alibi revolves around me
drinking till the early hours
well  it s true 
i saw him having whiskey and remarked
in the lesser quality of american liquor 
he offered me a tipple to
change my mind and another 
we got to arguing politics 
he had some   
tom fool opinions on stalin i had to
correct  but the man knows his spirits 
a word  please  monsieur 
you can t confirm you
were with him all night 
we smoked and spoke
till nearly 2  yes 
ah such charms  him with
his cigarettes and you   
ah yes  you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe 
may i see your pipe and
your tobacco  please 
of course 
and you  dr arbuthnot  was traveling
from india  i believe  yes 
you are interviewing me now 
were you ever in rachett s
compartment before he was killed 
certainly not 
but this is one of your pipe
cleaners  n est ce pas 
if you found that in the dead
man s cabin  look elsewhere 
i am a doctor  sir 
i heal people  i do not hurt them 
about this  you must have
worked very hard to become a doctor 
not many of your race are
allowed the opportunity 
middlesex medical college 
permits one per class 
i had the honor in  24 
i was a sniper in my tour 
sharp shooter 
saved more than a few officers 
more grateful recognized
a fair mind with a steady hand  
they supported my education 
i took their generosity as a debt 
did you know of colonel armstrong 
might have know two or three armstrong 
tommy in the sixties   
  selby armstrong   
  no i meant  colonel john armstrong 
he had an american wife and his
child was kidnapped and murdered 
never came across them 
when did you first meet miss debenham 
we met when we shared the railway
convoy cart from kirkuk to nissibin 
she claims otherwise  and she has
made herself problematically suspicious 
mary is a lady 
leave her out of this 
i can vouch for her 
as you have vouched for mcqueen s time 
  you won t listen to reasons 
  never 
you are lucky  the good doctor insisted
he did not let you out of his sight 
see  there  i could
not have done it 
yes  you could 
rachette took a sleeping
draft each evening 
you could add barbital 
easily access that drug 
do the same with one of the
doctor s many drinks  
and the chance to kill him is clear 
why would i do any of that 
we ve established your motive 
perhaps i would suggest a different one 
a different reason 
a more personal reason 
 a lawyer by education 
not by disposition  
why did you pursue the law i wonder 
was it to appease a much loved
but demanding father 
one who himself have made a great
success in the same field   
and then lost his position 
there was a renowned
mcqueen  was that not 
the district attorney for
the state of new jersey   
responsible for the prosecution
of the armstrong case 
they didn t have a suspect 
my dad was pressured to go after
this poor french woman   
a maid with a weak
alibi  susanne 
he hung this whole case on her 
she killed herself 
she was an innocent 
by the time the evidence led
to cassetti  he was long gone 
it tore my old man apart 
i couldn t do anything for him 
and yet you claim that you did not
know ratchett was cassetti 
no  no 
but you found him 
no 
  you found him  you bled him dry 
  no 
in order to settle your father s debts
and then finally  to settle   
no  no  no 
no  it was not   
it wasn t like that 
it was not   
  some one  kicking the door 
  doctor 
covered my face 
alright  this needs to come out now 
  i want my bag 
  of course 
it s in my compartment 
there will be no fingerprints 
the killer was disposing
of the murder weapon 
the killer didn t hit her lung or artery 
she s lucky to be alive 
you all are 
yes  some genius 
why haven t you solved this case 
you must give the man some time here 
yeah  well   
i can t give them much more 
i don t have any blood left 
yeah 
accosting mr  mcqueen and the
real killer is right here 
one of you people 
i don t know who you are 
i said nothing 
please  leave me alone 
say something 
my friends  the tracks will be
cleared by the morning please 
please return to your rooms 
i m sleeping here  
where everyone can see me
and i can see everyone 
you should all do the same 
can t say of it  
remain in the open  safely in view 
until morning 
the killer will never
hesitate to kill again 
i will convey the same
message to the andrenyi   
diplomatic immunity or not 
if you may  i will look
at your passports 
you know that i must talk with her 
by the way there is a grease
spot on your wife s name 
you might want to look at that 
elena is not well 
if you do not permit me  your reluctance
will be noted to the yugoslav police   
and i have no doubt that they
will arrest both of you   
  how dare you 
  honey 
you are funny looking 
monsieur poirot 
all detectives so funny looking 
i am sorry to wake you 
madame la comtesse 
i m always awake at night 
in the day i sleep 
some fear darkness  but i
cannot stand the light 
you are always under
the influence of   
barbital 
barbital  barbital 
i take oceans of it 
oh  there is no use in lie  love 
he can see right through us 
i can not go outside without it 
i can not sleep without it 
i take it against my fears 
what are you afraid of 
everything 
your passport has your maiden
name  as goldenberg 
jewish  yes 
not so jewish 
my middle name isn t maria 
and you are a dancer like your husband 
no  not like my husband 
code ballet 
he is touched by angels 
i rely by passion and
hard work to become adequate 
excuse me 
i must lie down again 
is this your only dressing gown 
no  i have another 
golden colored chiffon 
i like speaking to detectives 
you never know what
they will ask you next 
i am particularly good at capitals 
my governess was in a
strict love with geography 
he is satisfied 
i am always satisfied
when i uncover a liar 
madame  your name is not
elena  it is helena 
despite your clumsy attempt to
change it here and in your luggage 
my husband heard of a
piece of evidence found   
a handkerchief embroider with an
 h   and i didn t want my  h  involved 
so we changed it 
the luggage and the passport 
it s no crime to want
to be distant from trouble 
yet here is trouble 
a curious detail about the armstrong
tragedy at the heart of this case   
how many people
were wounded by it 
the younger sister 
the actress mother   
stage name linda arden 
i suppose she too was
of jewish ancestry   
as who is most likely
to take a stage name 
is is too far to suggest 
her original name was goldenberg 
especially when we find a young
woman of the same age   
as her surviving daughter   
living in a world of fear 
the sister of sonia armstrong 
get out 
i hear noises and i run 
just in time  yes 
you must now believe the count
and the countess are the killers 
the count is protective  the countess is
not someone to kill a bedroom spider 
and you may desist with this
you are never an austrian 
nor a german nor a professor 
but a good imitation 
was it based on someone you know 
i ll look a butcher when
i grew up as a kraut 
a good man  great accent 
what was it 
said  tu ri n    
the emphasis on the wrong syllable
for a proud and proper teuton 
 turin  
you    are a sharp knife 
i give you that 
herr professor gerhard hardman   
it s my cover 
i am sorry about the colored folks cracks 
oh  i m half a hid myself 
cyrus bethman hardman 
you are a pinkerton detective 
thirty years 
i was in istanbul  coming back
from my job when the office cabled 
ratchett asked for a man to tail
him  offering triple time 
like maybe nearby 
he told me to look out for a
small dark man with a high voice 
i watched that hall   
all night through a
crack in my door 
any thug   
had to go by me first 
i will take my oath on it 
and would you also take your oath on
your 30 years as a pikerton detective 
or would you lie to me again   
and deny that you were  in
fact  a police man first 
your gun  the chequered grip 
the blue finish   
produced for the
police positive edition 
1927 issued 
it appears there are no end
to the lies manufactured just for me 
you can leave your gun
as you go professor 
from the position of his cabin 
it would have been impossible to miss 
unless ratchett s
door was open   
as pilar estravados
claims she opened it 
in which case  someone
could have been   
masked from his view 
my dear katherine 
this is an abominable crime 
and i m struck  my katherine 
i can not find the crack in the wall 
why does one of them elude me 
i have always been   
so sure 
too sure 
but now i am very humble 
and i will say  like a little child   
 i do not know  
i m very afraid  my katherine 
my apologies 
ladies and gentlemen 
it is not safe on board while the
engine is put back on the track 
we have to wait in
the tunnel  thank you 
where are they taking the dogs 
they will be happy 
  that s not right 
  just to stretch the legs  it s good 
no  it s not alright 
are we stuck 
you asked for me 
another interrogation 
oh  no  i enjoy your company 
ah    please 
i have a list of ten questions i
am not nearer to answering   
and the train is about to leave 
you have a clear mind   
and i thought you might
produce an insight 
 the handkerchief  
 the scarlet kimono  the uniform  
 the time on the watch  
 was he murdered then 
earlier or later  
 by one person or more  
 which of them  
sorry  i can t help you 
perhaps there s an eleventh
question you don t know to ask yet   
that will give you the answer to the rest 
perhaps 
i could point and easy finger
at the countess andrenyi 
i discovered she was sonia
armstrong s sister 
  are you certain 
  yes
i suspect she may perhaps be innocent 
perhaps 
but so many people have lied to me
on this train  i do not seem to mind 
  you yourself did so effortlessly 
  me 
you told me you ve
never been to america 
you also concealed the fact that at
the time of the tragedy   
you were living in the
armstrong household   
as governess to their daughter 
and you know this 
i have my living to get 
a girl detained in connection
to a murder case   
no decent family would engage me 
miss debenham  you planned
rachette s murder 
and then you sent for the
countess to witness it 
if she saw him dead  the helena
you knew might return 
you waited for your room mate to
sleep  and she did not 
you drugged her 
but the barbital only gave her a headache 
she begged for an aspirin 
when the train stopped 
when the conductor was on the station   
when the coach was clear at last 
when you were allowed to enter
rachette s compartment  unseen 
you loved daisy armstrong 
you killed cassetti 
cassetti was a pig 
he deserved to die 
she didn t kill him 
i did 
mary  go 
i can t let you take the blame   
for what i did alone 
mary  please go 
john armstrong was my best
friend  my commander 
he believed in me 
he sent me to medical
school  gave me a future 
cassetti destroyed it 
in grief  i found mary 
and i found ratchett 
our plan was to avail him to
the police  that s what you heard 
but when i saw his face   
i knew he didn t deserve a trial 
so  you drugged mcqueen 
you changed the time on the watch   
so that you could lie about
the time of death 
i couldn t let mary be accused 
or mcqueen 
my sins are mine to pay for alone 
i am a soldier 
a soldier kills to protect 
and now  mr  poirot  i must
protect myself from you 
why aren t you dead yet 
poirot 
gentlemen  stop 
sir  you need to get all
the passengers back on the train 
you will retire   
away from the train   
until i tell you to return 
you tell your lies 
then you think no one will know 
but there are two people who will know 
yes  two people 
your god   
and the hercule poirot 
it is time to solve this case 
dr  arbuthnot asked me
why i was not yet dead 
he knew of course the answer 
a sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range 
your shot was not a mistake 
it was a surgery 
you couldn t kill me because
you are not a killer 
none of you are killers 
and  yet  someone must be 
there are two possible
solutions to this crime 
one difficult  because it fits
with most  but not all of the facts   
and one more   
complex 
the first solution 
ratchett had enemies 
a rouge mafia gets onto
the train at vinkovci   
as mcqueen and arbuthnot take the air 
equipped with a uniform and an
pass key  he stabs ratchett 
he leaves through ms hubbard s
compartment and makes his escape 
no 
no  no  no  it doesn t work 
why hide the uniform 
who drugged ratchett 
who stabbed mrs  hubbard 
damn it man 
so i ask  who is next to benefit 
this crime is murdering of a murderer 
the benefit is  perhaps   
to the spirit  an
ease of suffering 
to quite a shouting voice in the
head that prevents sleep 
there is a murderer among us 
so   
we have dr  arbuthnot  a dedicated
grateful friend to colonel armstrong 
he meets and finds solace in the company
of the governess  mary debenham   
who is almost like a
mother to the little girl 
and so close to mrs 
armstrong s young sister   
helena goldenberg 
married to a powerful man 
no stranger to rage and violence 
we travel also with
daisy s godmother   
to whom belongs   
the monogrammed handkerchief
found at the scene of the crime 
the letter  h  in the russian alphabet 
of course  pronounced  n  
natalia dragomiroff 
and her devoted maid with the chef s eye 
who was she before her current employ 
might i suggest the armstrong s cook 
but we are not yet done 
the nurse in charge of daisy   
her new found religious ill  born of
guilt of allowing her child   
to be abducted  it was you   
who was in her room the night when
rachette came in through the window 
did you have a glass of wine
too many with your supper that night 
have you blamed
yourself ever since 
for not being alert to stop him 
she knew nothing but kindness   
and love  until   
until i   
no need to divine with me  sir 
i was colonel armstrong s
bat man in the war 
and afterwards  his valet in new york 
as fine a man has god ever made 
would his chauffeur agree 
was it a bank loan secured by armstrong
allows him to build his automobile empire 
he is in debt for life 
who else can we count 
what of the pinkerton
detective  once a police officer 
assigned to the armstrong case 
and he becomes attached to some one for 
there is another uncelebrated victim 
you fell in love with the maid
before she was falsely accused 
you quit the police when
you witnessed the   
the travesty of justice   
when mcqueen s father insisted
on her arrest   
when she took her own life 
no  no  no 
susanne was a so gentle 
and she fell for me 
old and already getting grey 
i told her she could do better   
but there she was   
on time for every date 
why else   
is a train so full
in the dead of winter 
why the inconsistent   
why the abundance of evidence  why    
why the conductor 
pierre michel of avignon   
who lost his sister   
the accused maid   
susanne michele 
only one soul can claim to have
lost more than any of you 
the tragic linda arden   
mother of sonia   
grandmother of daisy 
retired from the stage   
but for one final performance 
you are an awfully clever man 
a murderer should have one victim 
when ratchett kills
daisi armstrong   
a dozen lives are broken 
deformed  ended 
they demand justice 
of all these wounded souls  we
must finally answer   
who among them is a killer 
who takes up the knife 
the answer is   
not single one of you could have done it 
nor any pair 
it can only have been done   
by all of you
together 
together 
even when the avalanche
changes everything   
as does the detective 
plan was changed 
the kimono  the uniform 
a remarkable improvisation  the doctor
knows how to wound without killing 
each had their part to play 
do it 
it was my plan 
i recruited them 
i had hardman track down cassetti 
i sent mcqueen to work for
him  and then masterman 
mcqueen could arrange the travel
on the day that michel was on duty 
mr  ratchett 
goodnight 
and so it is done 
for the death of the innocent 
a life    for a life 
revenge 
no one should hang for this but me 
it was my plan 
tell the police that it
was me alone 
there is no life left in me anymore 
they   
have a chance now 
helena  i prey   
has a chance 
they can   
go  live   
find some joy   
somewhere 
let it end with me 
they are not killers 
they are good people 
they can be good again 
there was right 
there was wrong 
and now there is you 
i can not judge this 
you must decide 
do you wish to go free without
punishment for your crime 
then you must only commit one more 
i ll not stop you 
you can t let them kill you 
you give my body to the lake  and
you will go away innocent at the station 
you must silence me 
bouc can lie 
i can not 
do it  one of you 
no 
i already died with daisy 
no 
you said your role was to find justice 
what is justice here 
sometimes  the law of man is not enough 
where does conscience lie 
buried with daisy 
my dear colonel armstrong 
finally  i can answer your letter   
at least with the thoughts in head
and the feeling in my heart   
that  somewhere 
you can hear me 
i ve now discovered the truth of
the case  and it is   
profoundly disturbing 
i have seen the fracture of the human soul 
so many broken lives  so
much pain and anger   
giving way to the poison
of deep grief   
until one crime became many 
i have always wanted to believe
that man is rational and civilized 
my very existence depends
upon this hope   
upon order  and methods
and the little gray cells 
but now  perhaps  i m asked   
to listen instead   
to my heart 
ladies and gentlemen   
i have understood in this case
that the scales of justice   
cannot always be evenly weighed 
and i must learn  for once   
to live with the imbalance 
there are no killers here 
only the people who deserve
a chance to heal 
the police have accepted my
first solution to the crime   
the lone assassin who made his escape 
i will leave the train
here to conclude formalities 
you are all free to go 
may you find your peace with this 
may we all 
hello
