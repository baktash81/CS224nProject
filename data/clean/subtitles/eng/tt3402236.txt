two perfect eggs this time no
maybe
i blame the chicken
why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes
its not you  monamie
these are two perfectly cooked eggs
mr poirot
i have got 3 religions bent on riot
if you are going to perform one of
your miracles the time is now
have the eggs
poirot
sorry for the um
it is not the
it is the imbalance of the
right
thats better
excuse me lets move on
make way please
for the accused
the rabbi
the priest
and the imam
it is like the
old joke yes
the rabbi the priest and the imam
forgive me im belgian
so let us begin
in the church of the
holy sepulcher above us
three representatives meet
under the supervision
of the chief inspector of the police to
discuss a divided timetable for market use
one hour after this tense meeting
a priceless relic is found to be stolen
it is said one of
these three men has stolen it
the police find no pieces
of evidence at all
i find one
on the meticulously well
kept wall of a fresco
a single crack from an
indelicate client
with a hardsoled
shoe or perhaps a boot
so ladies and gentlemen
we must ask
who stands to benefit from the crime
our three holy men live humbly
they have thin
soled shoes poor
sudden riches
and rubies would be
too conspicuous yes to enjoy
they do not getting it
at this point we need an armed
guard at the south gate
thank you very much
now the only one
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes
is a man whose office i
had searched this morning
as i waited i have to tell you
rather disappointed upon my breakfast
difficulty with the eggs
you dont need to know this
a man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in jerusalem
i mean of course the
chief inspector of the police
a man who does not wish to
lose a wellpaid post
when there is discussion among the
local people of self governance
who does wear boots and
do i believe now does regret
inviting me to consult on this case
how dare you accuse me
police sergeant
did you search the
office as i asked
ah yes sir
and did you find what
i said you might
yes sir just as you said
you must deliver that to the captain
itll be the first thing in the morning
i got it sir
luggage is on board sir
i want the right to
escort you to your boat
to istanbul then
will you be back to london straight off
im tired and ive
earned myself a little holiday
i want to look at paintings
and have too much time on my hands
youre staring does it stop
its just
how did you know it was him sir
from just a tiny crack on the wall
i have the advantage
i can only see the
world as it should be
and when it is not
the imperfection stands out
like the nose in the
middle of a face
it makes most of life unbearable
but it is useful in the
detection of crime
but its just like you see em through their
hearts and divine their true natures
and whatever people say there
is right there is wrong
there is nothing in between
we must part here
no sir i am to escort you on ferry
we must never meet again
could you straighten your tie please
just a little
yes
that is perfect
final passengers please

well be reached soon
but will it be fixed in time

this is my dear old friend
the esteemed
poirot whom i knew before the esteem
hercule poirot this is
a prostitute

number three is unlucky
apologies madame
i meant no disrespect to you
oh you could try to mean a little
one thing about train travel
youre always knocking into somebody
it is wonderful
although i am looking
always to getting back
travel is my
spicy food mosques meeting men
eventually just miss your own bed
i have been accused of
husband hunting abroad
and i cant honestly deny it
i like my time alone i do
but a lady has certain needs that deserve
to be met if she has any money
and preferably on a regular basis
oh my fire in the kitchen
see you later madame
good evening
number nine
good evening
how you doing
no after you
ah number three
who is it ah mr mcqueen
yeah i think you might
have the wrong birth
excuse me is there a problem sir
no problem
the train is full
and i think that we are
how do you say bunkies
really
i am equally disappointed in you
this is nice
come along darlings
no
no
this
why my unpacked
final call for passengers
shall we brush it
what the hell is taking them so long
soon as were getting out of
here have them make up the bed
its already fixed mr ratchett
no i want the bed made
and bring my dictaphone
dogs on the table its
the most disgustable
thing ive ever seen in a while
yes sir
i want you to get mcqueen
and have him bring every
receipt from the milan sale
i want you to get it done
yes sir
i want you to get it done now
did i say get it done now
right away sir

i cant say sir
good evening mrs hubbard
hello mr masterman
well hello
eyes linger any longer ill
have to charge rent
ill pay
have another drink
are you insulted
disappointed
some men have a good look
all they have to do is
keep their mouth shut and
they can take on any prize they want
still the mouth opens
is everything alright mrs hubbard
you have a strong intuition i know
my second husband used to say just so
hold that he was my first
yeah
brightest man ive ever met
face like a turnip but
i loved that turnip
it was nice to talk
excuse me
goodnight
mr poirot breakfast
when you take supper
ill move mr mcqueen to
monsieur boucs compartment
you will travel first class monsieur
bon apetite
and the eggs
good afternoon
ah mrs hubbard
good afternoon
there we are
complements of the orient express
thank you mr bouc
i am here for all of your needs
no thank you i do not drink
i do not agree with you
sin doesnt agree with me
vice is where the devil
finds his darlings
we should no longer speak
good afternoon
monsieur how about an appetizer
i regret i have an appointment
with the director of the train
he was gonna leave anyway
please sir
all settled in
as advertised
and yet the best things
on the train are not food
you know there is something about a
a tangle of strangers pressed together
for days with nothing in common
but they need to go from
one place to another
and never see each other again
boredom plus anonymity plus
constant gentle rocking
with your hobbies youll
never amount to anything
god i hope so
oh give me the fish
exchange grouper for soul
es carole for the potato and
the beef sauce for the veloutãcopyright
garcon that sounds superb
the same for me
the princess dragomiroff
you know if i had the word to marry for
money i would marry for that much money
i brushed dalia this morning
no you tortured my darling doggy
i asked you to brush her
you still enjoying your dickens
very much monamie
you know with your books and your capers
youre missing out on romance
the romance never goes unpunished
there was
there was someone once
i would prefer into future i
to be sit not with that man
like should be seated with like
we are not alike
not all of us are so concerned with
the separation of races professor
it is out of respect for all kinds
that i prefer to keep them separated
to mix your red wine and the
white would be to ruin them both
i like a good rose
hey how you doing
would you mind
if i join you
dessert is an indulgence
and i feel kind of silly
stupid indulging alone
i am at my happiest alone
but
for a piece of your
fragility pleased to join you
oh my excuse me another fork
i have been trying to
make your acquit mr poirot
i never ever sat so
close to fame before me
now i tell a lie
once i was in a bus with ty cobb
ball player detroit
would you mind if i have the little
curly bit at the top
you are not a bird though
a strange peculiar man
i am of a age where i know what i like
and what i do not like
what i like i enjoy enormously
what i dislike i can not abide
for an instance
the temporary pleasantries before
what is determined to be
a business discussion
youre fun
all right
i would like to offer you a job
the avenger of the innocents
thats what they call you in the papers
you are an innocent
i am a businessman
i am an art dealer
i mean i am new to it
but my beginners luck
has worked out
relics antiquities
rugs rare orientals
im new to the game so you
know i got the amateur eye ball
but i got a little problem with the
so called praises
you cant trust a one
some of my customers
they buy a piece
they find out they are
not exactly original
which is not really my fault
if a kashan silk scarf is a fake
right
but ive managed to make
a few enemies its the thing
got a few letters
people making threats
and most likely its the italians
i sold them a set of
oriental carpets in milan
and the buyers werent so happy
with the providence
and they want their money
back with interest you know
italians
a guinea is guinea
and then comes along
the genius detective
me
yes you hercules poirot
hercule
here is what id like to do
i would like to hire you
to watch my back
until i get someplace safe
its easy money for you
and its peace of mind
for me you know
i understand
good
i refuse
thats bad
i didnt make
myself clear enough
you see someone is out to get me
and i know im not the best
not by a long shot
and if there is a world after this where i
will face judgment just like you
but
i aint in no goddamn rush to do it
you are holding a gun at me
no
not you on the world
i exist in the world
do not point the gun at me
how does ten thousand sound for a week
its a generous offer mr rachette
i must decline
fifteen thousand
you didnt hear me i declined
oh i get it
its not flashing out for the
great hercules poirot huh
not new flashbooks
you sell fakes to gangsters
youre suffering the consequences
i detect criminals
i do not protect them
so you are saying no
to my dirty money
i say no to you mr ratchett
business with the gun right
is that what it was
this is far more personal than that
i do not like your face
if youll excuse me
you liked my cake didnt ya
the cake was excellent
have a pleasant afternoon mr ratchett
thank you
how cold
mossier katherine
monamie
mr dickens
mr ratchett
mr ratchett
yeah mossier
goodnight
mrs hubbard
its always mrs hubbard
mrs hubbard
did we die
ladies and gentlemen
the train has been derailed
you alright mr marquez
im fine thank you
mr bouc will speak to you
all clear
are we going to die
my katherine
my beautiful
ladies and gentlemen im afraid that
our train is still unable to go anywhere
yeah except down
how long are we supposed to just figure
yes someone must be doing something
of course im doing something
i am doing nothing
precisely two hours and ten minutes ago
when we didnt arrive in
broad as scheduled
the station master will have
surmised our situation
and already sent a team
to excavate the engine
clear our path and send us on our way
until then i assure you
we will all be made warm
and fed and comfortable
we could walk
we could die of exposure trying
i have a connection to make
my boat sails the day after
tomorrow from france
without you i would wedger
or me in london
i hold you accountable for
my loss of time mr bouc
madame you cant hold me
accountable for the weather
of course i can
you are the one here
and my conference in turin
and i was to meet a
factory in sochaux
yes some things
they are in gods hands
it is not for us to say
if we deserve to arrive
safely to our destination
or if like lucifer
we must fall
breakfast for you mr ratchett
ah bonjour mr masterman
there is problem
i cant say sir
mr ratchett
that is cold air
please bring mr bouc immediately
and also dr arbuthnot
good god
touch nothing else
only the body
by god this is horrible
first the snow and now
ill have to meet with the police and
make some statement in some grimy station
and a man has died
and a man has died
he was stabbed
long straight edge knife
multiple stab wounds some shallow
some cut clean through muscle
left hand side or right hand side
thats the thing
it appears that the killer maybe
closed his eyes and struck blind
could you estimate the time of death
its hard to say
with the window opened
but my best guess is
between midnight and 200
but no one went to his compartment
and i sat on my seat all night
i would have seen if someone came
its impossible
thank you doctor
please return to the dining car
michel secure this carriage
poirot
i need your help my friend
you have to find who did this
please i employ you on behalf
of the orient express
when the police arrives we can
present them with a case closed
you are the only one who can save me
your faith touches me mon cher
but i must held this rest
well think of it as a little
beach time puzzle
thats nothing to your mind
you look up the antecedents
of the passengers
you will establish the boniface
and then do what you do
you sit in a chair
and you eat your cake
and you think until the
solution present itself
what else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow
without constant stimulation
your little grey cells will starve and die
do you think that is what i do
i sit in the chair
i have a little piece of cake
and then i come up with a
i dont know what are you do
i have my dickens
damn your dickens
if we leave this to the police
they will choose a culprit
right or wrong and
then theyll hang him
most probably mr marquez
for no other reason than
his name is marquez
or dr arbuthnot for
the color of his skin
you are the only one
who can bring justice
let me have a map of this coach
of course
every passport
anything
interviews arranged with
all of the passengers
evidence order and method
until one culprit emerges
i do not approve of
murder my friend
every day we meet people the world
could have better without yet
we do not kill them
we must be better than the beasts
so let us find this killer
ladies and gentlemen
allow me to
it appears that our
bad luck has worsened
that is
a passenger has
died on the train
monsieur ratchett
looks like they got him after all
do you assume he was killed
no no
i just meant he was in
perfectly good health
he had his enemies thats all
indeed he did he was murdered
oh god a murder here
alas madame
god rest his soul
someone was rummaging around my
cabin in the middle of the night
nobody would believe me
what is going on
as we are snowbound i have
elected to take the case
and find for my friend
monsieur bouc the criminal
and why you
my name is hercule poirot
and im probably the greatest
detective in the world
i will speak to all of you in time
for the moment
i must recommend that you remain in
your compartment with the doors locked
i feel like a prisoner here
it is for your own safety
if there was a murder
then there was a murderer
the murderer is with us
on the train now
the doors between coaches
were locked at night hmm
absolutely done myself
the trains been searched
there is no one hiding on it or under it
we can therefore limit our investigation
to the occupants of the calais coach
bouc youll assist me
as the only traveler who
slept in another coach
you are the only one
who is not a suspect
mr mcqueen is it
really the time for drinking
my boss is dead
i am out of the job and youre
looking at me like i did it
we make no accusations
you knew him so from you we
need the essential facts
were you his relative
no his secretary
booked his travel
ordered his steaks
man ate more steaks than i
have ever seen in my entire life
he was in antiques
he had no qualifications for it
not the eye quite the languages
truth is he had no head for business
accounting
none of it
i took care of everything
how long were you in his employ
twenty days short of a year
prohibition wasnt to my taste
so i found myself overseas and in debt
im a lawyer by education
not disposition
he was incompetent in that
you were fond of him
i was fond of his money
ratchett was crude
demanding insulting
and most likely a felon
when did you last see him
it must have been just after 1000
he called me in to go over
our sales in italy
milan the sale of forgeries
yeah yeah
he wanted to look over the accounts
i had to translate everything else
the contracts were in french
and he didnt speak a word
and when we stopped at vinkovci
i struck up a chat with
the colored doctor arbuthnot
we had a couple of
drinks stretch our legs
he had some
odd opinions about stalin
i had to turn around
i dont hold the mans race against him
but i dont often take the britishers
when did your party end
yeah he left just after 200
did you know of any specific
enemies ratchett might have had
gosh
pick a number
you confide that he have been threatened
he got a couple of nasty letters
i have them if you like
some at least
he threw up the rest
he threw them into the fire
merci mr mcqueen
thank you
if we have any further questions
we will call for you again
have you consider the latin man marquez
hell of a guy man
and well you know his kind
they dont have the same distest
for murder historically speaking
you said you dont hold a
mans race against him
i suppose
depends on the race
he was doing so well
do you think its mcqueen
too early to say
i admit i cant see him
stabbing a man 12 times in a frenzy
not sober any way
who did it then
i do not know yet
its time we ask
ask who
the victim
he has 12 stab wounds and as
arbuthnot said they are patternless
if the doctor is guilty
he certainly didnt let his
influence his responsibility
hey the watch
stopped at 115
that agrees with the the doctor
on the time of death
it is possible yes
certainly possible
i dont quite understand
well i do not understand myself
i understand nothing at all
if you look at these two wounds
they are powerful and deep
and yet there is little blood
but this was a frenzy attack
lashing here and there no pattern
at all just extreme violence
and during all this our victim
vigorous and anxious and full of coffee
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle
when he also has here
the means by which he might
defend himself
for you
now let us see
barbital the mickey sleep
they drugged him so
he could not use this
and let her around here
a ladies handkerchief
an object de luxe handmade boom
two hundred francs in paris
and she even has an initial h
and our little friend the pipe cleaner
another clue
yes a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently
yet only one appears however
to be perhaps genuine
and maybe this ashtray provides
the accidental bread crumb
the charred fragment of a note
an attempt perhaps
to burn the evidence
he may borrow your
equipment yes
thank you
now i quick up to understand
why a clue is left rather than
of what the object is
we seek the truth from
within not with out
in this case however i may
welcome a little scientific assistance
you will adjust the flame
not one of those nasty letters
youre mistaken monamie
this one has a secret to tell
look
as a strong blood is
on hand you will die
what does this mean
come with me bouc
let us fill in the gaps
this was never a beach side puzzle
i know the dead mans real name
it is not ratchett but cassetti
i know that name
then you will also know the
name armstrong
the armstrong case
history shook the world
two years ago
the renowned pilot
colonel john armstrong
and his wife sonia woke to find
their only child little daisy
desperate
the armstrongs paid the ransom
but soon after daisy
was found murdered by
ratchett who was cassetti
sonia armstrong was with child
when she received the news
the shock sent her into
premature labor
neither she nor her baby survived
how do you know this poirot
because john armstrong
told me so himself
he wrote to me to ask me for my help
by the time i received the letter
it was too late
he was found dead of a gunshot wound
selfinflicted
daisy armstrongs blood is on
your hands you will die for it
indeed you did
monsieur poirot
yes michel
mrs hubbard wants to talk to you
i held her as best as i could
uh mrs hubbard i am
sorry to have kept you
you have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words
you goddamn right i do
what i have been trying to
to tell you all day
the murderer with in my
compartment last night
i thought i would be killed
turns out i might have been
only he got rachette instead
i woke up in the dark and i knew
there was a man in my room
you were certain it was a man
i know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom
i told your conductor and he
wouldnt believe me
i said check the communicating door
between my room and ratchetts
he must have left through there
sure enough it was unbolted
i know i locked it after
what ratchett said
he made a rather
daring proposal
have you perhaps
heard about the
armstrong kidnapping
you couldnt avoid it
morbid stuff
the childs murderer cassetti
died last night
ratchett was that man
i told you i knew
he was a rotten one
you do believe me
about the man in my room
i am aware that you
think im a silly woman
but i have proof that its true
might have fallen off michel
when he was in your room
im not missing it
i found it at the foot of
my bed on the cover
right where i slept
what do you call that
i call it evidence
thank you very much mrs hubbard
have you ever been to america
once
years ago briefly
for what purpose
to confirm a suspicion
which was
that i wouldnt like it
i was offered a post in boston
from boston went straight back to london
is that where rachette was from boston
i dont know
it wouldnt be proper
to ask
carry on
the last i saw
mr ratchett at nine oclock
i brought his coffee and
hung up his clothes
you have the tooth ache i think
i have got an extraction
booked in london this week
mr ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer
he said he was tired of hearing
my suppressed groans
this sympathetic ratchett
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night
not at all
but he had been very agitated lately
he said he wanted to stay alert
especially through the last night
he found a letter in his compartment
please tell me you didnt do this
if i am to leave something
unpleasant on your pillow sir
it would not be a letter
coffee
surely such a
profound and precise valet
would never speak to his master
how you did
unless he knew his career was
coming to a sudden
end
not mere tooth ache i think
the lungs
the thyroid
spread now to stomach
ends with my father five years younger
months have passed
inoperable i am afraid
said the doctor
suddenly i wasnt afraid
i would only do what i wanted
i speak my mind now
the coffee
it appears that his cup was
mixed with the barbital
you of course would tell me
that you did not put it in there
of course i did not
when and from where did you
procure the coffee and the cups
in the kitchen sir
i ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9 and so it was
anyone could have
got hold of it before me
mr masterman
im sorry about the tooth ache
i love the little cakes
so miss pilar estravados
you are a missionary
but youve trained as a nurse
before you change profession yes
i owed it to god
you owed him a debt
there were
indulgent times in my life
when i took more than i gave
gerhard hardman
professor of engineering
it is science that will
win back for germany her pride
mr marquez listen i want to be clear
of any association with the crime
so please ask me anything
anything i never lie anymore
did you leave your compartment
at all last night
only once to get an aspirin
mrs hubbard offered me something earlier
i declined it first
but when i could not rest
i went to ask for it
my conference is in turin
i am the only austrian
to present which means without me
the talks would be sub standard
then i escaped prison and i drived myself
into the united states
where i swore never to
lie or steal again
you see my friends because when
people trust you they buy more
the italians are cows
the spaniards sheep
the belgians
nothing i come to my room which i share
with the unhappy english butler
annoying he groans a lot
but i am sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning
i should say
in case it is relevant
there was an embarrassing moment
when i went to see mrs hubbard
first i opened the wrong door
i am sorry
what time was this
that must have been about
dont be sorry
twenty minutes to 1100
this is interesting
as far as it is known you was the
last person to see ratchett alive
your business
automobiles
i have three showrooms
i come to america with nothing
and now
if what you say is true miss
debnham will confirm it
but it is true
i would not lie
i would not lie
may it be possible that miss debenham left
your compartment without you noticing
no i sleep very lightly
with the slightest sound
i woke up right
i was surprised once
never again
no i didnt say i was a chauffeur
the photographs that spilled
out of your luggage
there was a beautiful one the
little boy wearing a chauffeurs hat
visiting his papa at work
who did you chauffeur
ms estrada why do your
hands have a calluses of a boxer
i do my work in dangerous cities
where i can not be governed by fear
i trained to fight
but you do not you trust your god anymore
since you had surprise
no in case he is busy
god is always busy
its masterman
a man dying he is the man
with nothing to lose
bravo bouc
except for the problem of mr marquez
who has now confirmed that his
bunk mate masterman
was reading in his bed
at the time of death
if it were easy i would not be famous
next
miss debenham
you do not mind to brace the air
for you we have the picnic
oh you made my room mate
suffer cramped i see
use the best location to extract
the truth from each suspect
put her off balance me freeze
clever
will you write on your full
name and address please
a pale move by the way
ms estravados told me you
asked the the color of her dressing gown
mary hermione debenham
do you ever go by hermione
a constant marry when im not employed
as miss debenham lefthanded
unusual i know
you mustnt have your theory fixed
if you are testing my handwriting
what did you think of the dead man
i cant say i didnt
think about him
dont quite see the point of your question
forgive me mademoiselle they
are my little originalities
human nature is perverse
in its complexity
to plumb it it takes the right tools
these are toys not tools hercule
and i prefer that you put them away
the direct method parfait
you knew the doctor before traveling
dr arbuthnot
no
but such an instant attraction
we are not in america
miss debenham there are
no laws against what you may feel
nor are there laws against
silence of which
im hold my
i have never been to america
perhaps i may ask about some
words ive overheard
you and the stranger arbuthnot
are closer than strangers might be
you said
not now when were done
then no one can touch us
what did you mean
do you think i made a murder
to a man with a hammer
every problem is a nail
you live crime
you see evil every day
no so
i see enough crimes to know that
the criminal act is the anomaly
i think it takes a fracture
off with a soul
to murder another human being
i ask again what did you mean
as we established
there are no laws against my silence
very well
and afterward princess dragomiroff
after dinner i went to bed
god blessed me with long life
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable
about close to 100
i called for frãoulein schmidt
she massaged me
and read me for a while then i sleep
were you ever acquainted with
a family by the name of armstrong
they endured an unspeakable tragedy
i was an admirer of sonia
armstrongs mother
linda arden the actress
a once a century talent
miss arden was to do acting
she would have become the first
woman titan of broadway
were it not for the tragedy
and this linda arden shes dead
she might as well be
she no longer leaves her home
daisy was my goddaughter
she was
i dons see how this relates
to our trouble detective
the man killed last night
his true name was cassetti
the man who murdered
little daisy armstrong
i see
i admit i know this family
and now that man is dead
the coincidence
must seem unbearable
you may be permitted a coincidence
i must now ask a few questions
of you froulein schmidt
no there is no need
i can answer to her character
even still if you will allow
froulein please answer in german
but your excellency does not understand
thats what it is about
is this yours
h of hildegarde
that is silk
its too fine for me
is this the truth about last night
as she said
she sent the inspector to look for me
then i went back to bed
did you see someone when he returned
only the other inspector
one who was
the other conductor
you mean michel
no a different one
please come
are you sure you didnt see him
im certain the other conductor was a
small man with a short beard
froulein there is no other conductor
i know what i saw
i remember because his voice was high
and the uniform was same exactly
although i suspect missing one button
sir i need your pass key immediately
we need to find a uniform
and a red kimono
thousands of photographs
any less pair of socks
dressing gowns in every colors but red
still no contraband conduct his uniform
have we already checked all the
passenger of luggage
all except for the count and
the countess andrenyi monsieur
it is forbidden to search their suitcases
they travel under diplomatic visas
where else could be
there is one last suitcase
we have not checked
my own
the killer is mocking me
good his first mistake
and as the night must follow the day
no its not mine
i told you of the conductor
why would i tell you if it was me
you would not
which makes your compartment
the ideal place to hide it
voila the button
and if the conductors uniform
why not a conductors pass key
now we know how the killer
magically passed through locked doors
bourbon
mcqueen
now what are we looking for
five hundred pounds
mcqueen also had a ledger
all his dealings with rachette
where is it
poirot
bouc keep everyone inside
please stop
mossier stay where you are
thank you gentlemen thank you
so it was mcqueen
you have your man
how could he
i didnt kill him
you tried to burn rachettes accounts
but there are illegibly places
the maths do not tally
because you have been
stealing from him
it is full of the
the the english word
the chocolate
fudge
fudge it is full of the fudge
you stole from him
you thought you would be found out
that is why you killed him
yeah
yeah you are damn right
i stole from him
thousands
i knew his money wasnt honest
who wondered it would matter
if i skimmed some of the top
but let me ask you a question
why would i slaughter my cash cow
i didnt do it
i didnt kill him
he didnt
he didnt
i expect his alibi revolves around me
drinking till the early hours
well its true
i saw him having whiskey and remarked
in the lesser quality of american liquor
he offered me a tipple to
change my mind and another
we got to arguing politics
he had some
tomfool opinions on stalin i had to
correct but the man knows his spirits
a word please monsieur
you cant confirm you
were with him all night
we smoked and spoke
till nearly 2 yes
ah such charms him with
his cigarettes and you
ah yes you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe
may i see your pipe and
your tobacco please
of course
and you dr arbuthnot was traveling
from india i believe yes
you are interviewing me now
were you ever in rachetts
compartment before he was killed
certainly not
but this is one of your pipe
cleaners nestce pas
if you found that in the dead
mans cabin look elsewhere
i am a doctor sir
i heal people i do not hurt them
about this you must have
worked very hard to become a doctor
not many of your race are
allowed the opportunity
middlesex medical college
permits one per class
i had the honor in 24
i was a sniper in my tour
sharp shooter
saved more than a few officers
more grateful recognized
a fair mind with a steady hand
they supported my education
i took their generosity as a debt
did you know of colonel armstrong
might have know two or three armstrong
tommy in the sixties
selby armstrong
no i meant colonel john armstrong
he had an american wife and his
child was kidnapped and murdered
never came across them
when did you first meet miss debenham
we met when we shared the railway
convoy cart from kirkuk to nissibin
she claims otherwise and she has
made herself problematically suspicious
mary is a lady
leave her out of this
i can vouch for her
as you have vouched for mcqueens time
you wont listen to reasons
never
you are lucky the good doctor insisted
he did not let you out of his sight
see there i could
not have done it
yes you could
rachette took a sleeping
draft each evening
you could add barbital
easily access that drug
do the same with one of the
doctors many drinks
and the chance to kill him is clear
why would i do any of that
weve established your motive
perhaps i would suggest a different one
a different reason
a more personal reason
a lawyer by education
not by disposition
why did you pursue the law i wonder
was it to appease a much loved
but demanding father
one who himself have made a great
success in the same field
and then lost his position
there was a renowned
mcqueen was that not
the district attorney for
the state of new jersey
responsible for the prosecution
of the armstrong case
they didnt have a suspect
my dad was pressured to go after
this poor french woman
a maid with a weak
alibi susanne
he hung this whole case on her
she killed herself
she was an innocent
by the time the evidence led
to cassetti he was long gone
it tore my old man apart
i couldnt do anything for him
and yet you claim that you did not
know ratchett was cassetti
no no
but you found him
no
you found him you bled him dry
no
in order to settle your fathers debts
and then finally to settle
no no no
no it was not
it wasnt like that
it was not
some one kicking the door
doctor
covered my face
alright this needs to come out now
i want my bag
of course
its in my compartment
there will be no fingerprints
the killer was disposing
of the murder weapon
the killer didnt hit her lung or artery
shes lucky to be alive
you all are
yes some genius
why havent you solved this case
you must give the man some time here
yeah well
i cant give them much more
i dont have any blood left
yeah
accosting mr mcqueen and the
real killer is right here
one of you people
i dont know who you are
i said nothing
please leave me alone
say something
my friends the tracks will be
cleared by the morning please
please return to your rooms
im sleeping here
where everyone can see me
and i can see everyone
you should all do the same
cant say of it
remain in the open safely in view
until morning
the killer will never
hesitate to kill again
i will convey the same
message to the andrenyi
diplomatic immunity or not
if you may i will look
at your passports
you know that i must talk with her
by the way there is a grease
spot on your wifes name
you might want to look at that
elena is not well
if you do not permit me your reluctance
will be noted to the yugoslav police
and i have no doubt that they
will arrest both of you
how dare you
honey
you are funny looking
monsieur poirot
all detectives so funny looking
i am sorry to wake you
madame la comtesse
im always awake at night
in the day i sleep
some fear darkness but i
cannot stand the light
you are always under
the influence of
barbital
barbital barbital
i take oceans of it
oh there is no use in lie love
he can see right through us
i can not go outside without it
i can not sleep without it
i take it against my fears
what are you afraid of
everything
your passport has your maiden
name as goldenberg
jewish yes
not so jewish
my middle name isnt maria
and you are a dancer like your husband
no not like my husband
code ballet
he is touched by angels
i rely by passion and
hard work to become adequate
excuse me
i must lie down again
is this your only dressing gown
no i have another
goldencolored chiffon
i like speaking to detectives
you never know what
they will ask you next
i am particularly good at capitals
my governess was in a
strict love with geography
he is satisfied
i am always satisfied
when i uncover a liar
madame your name is not
elena it is helena
despite your clumsy attempt to
change it here and in your luggage
my husband heard of a
piece of evidence found
a handkerchief embroider with an
h and i didnt want my h involved
so we changed it
the luggage and the passport
its no crime to want
to be distant from trouble
yet here is trouble
a curious detail about the armstrong
tragedy at the heart of this case
how many people
were wounded by it
the younger sister
the actress mother
stage name linda arden
i suppose she too was
of jewish ancestry
as who is most likely
to take a stage name
is is too far to suggest
her original name was goldenberg
especially when we find a young
woman of the same age
as her surviving daughter
living in a world of fear
the sister of sonia armstrong
get out
i hear noises and i run
just in time yes
you must now believe the count
and the countess are the killers
the count is protective the countess is
not someone to kill a bedroom spider
and you may desist with this
you are never an austrian
nor a german nor a professor
but a good imitation
was it based on someone you know
ill look a butcher when
i grew up as a kraut
a good man great accent
what was it
said turin
the emphasis on the wrong syllable
for a proud and proper teuton
turin
you are a sharp knife
i give you that
herr professor gerhard hardman
its my cover
i am sorry about the colored folks cracks
oh im half a hid myself
cyrus bethman hardman
you are a pinkerton detective
thirty years
i was in istanbul coming back
from my job when the office cabled
ratchett asked for a man to tail
him offering triple time
like maybe nearby
he told me to look out for a
small dark man with a high voice
i watched that hall
all night through a
crack in my door
any thug
had to go by me first
i will take my oath on it
and would you also take your oath on
your 30 years as a pikerton detective
or would you lie to me again
and deny that you were in
fact a police man first
your gun the chequered grip
the blue finish
produced for the
police positive edition
1927 issued
it appears there are no end
to the lies manufactured just for me
you can leave your gun
as you go professor
from the position of his cabin
it would have been impossible to miss
unless ratchetts
door was open
as pilar estravados
claims she opened it
in which case someone
could have been
masked from his view
my dear katherine
this is an abominable crime
and im struck my katherine
i can not find the crack in the wall
why does one of them elude me
i have always been
so sure
too sure
but now i am very humble
and i will say like a little child
i do not know
im very afraid my katherine
my apologies
ladies and gentlemen
it is not safe on board while the
engine is put back on the track
we have to wait in
the tunnel thank you
where are they taking the dogs
they will be happy
thats not right
just to stretch the legs its good
no its not alright
are we stuck
you asked for me
another interrogation
oh no i enjoy your company
ah please
i have a list of ten questions i
am not nearer to answering
and the train is about to leave
you have a clear mind
and i thought you might
produce an insight
the handkerchief
the scarlet kimono the uniform
the time on the watch
was he murdered then
earlier or later
by one person or more
which of them
sorry i cant help you
perhaps theres an eleventh
question you dont know to ask yet
that will give you the answer to the rest
perhaps
i could point and easy finger
at the countess andrenyi
i discovered she was sonia
armstrongs sister
are you certain
yes
i suspect she may perhaps be innocent
perhaps
but so many people have lied to me
on this train i do not seem to mind
you yourself did so effortlessly
me
you told me youve
never been to america
you also concealed the fact that at
the time of the tragedy
you were living in the
armstrong household
as governess to their daughter
and you know this
i have my living to get
a girl detained in connection
to a murder case
no decent family would engage me
miss debenham you planned
rachettes murder
and then you sent for the
countess to witness it
if she saw him dead the helena
you knew might return
you waited for your room mate to
sleep and she did not
you drugged her
but the barbital only gave her a headache
she begged for an aspirin
when the train stopped
when the conductor was on the station
when the coach was clear at last
when you were allowed to enter
rachettes compartment unseen
you loved daisy armstrong
you killed cassetti
cassetti was a pig
he deserved to die
she didnt kill him
i did
mary go
i cant let you take the blame
for what i did alone
mary please go
john armstrong was my best
friend my commander
he believed in me
he sent me to medical
school gave me a future
cassetti destroyed it
in grief i found mary
and i found ratchett
our plan was to avail him to
the police thats what you heard
but when i saw his face
i knew he didnt deserve a trial
so you drugged mcqueen
you changed the time on the watch
so that you could lie about
the time of death
i couldnt let mary be accused
or mcqueen
my sins are mine to pay for alone
i am a soldier
a soldier kills to protect
and now mr poirot i must
protect myself from you
why arent you dead yet
poirot
gentlemen stop
sir you need to get all
the passengers back on the train
you will retire
away from the train
until i tell you to return
you tell your lies
then you think no one will know
but there are two people who will know
yes two people
your god
and the hercule poirot
it is time to solve this case
dr arbuthnot asked me
why i was not yet dead
he knew of course the answer
a sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range
your shot was not a mistake
it was a surgery
you couldnt kill me because
you are not a killer
none of you are killers
and yet someone must be
there are two possible
solutions to this crime
one difficult because it fits
with most but not all of the facts
and one more
complex
the first solution
ratchett had enemies
a rouge mafia gets onto
the train at vinkovci
as mcqueen and arbuthnot take the air
equipped with a uniform and an
pass key he stabs ratchett
he leaves through ms hubbards
compartment and makes his escape
no
no no no it doesnt work
why hide the uniform
who drugged ratchett
who stabbed mrs hubbard
damn it man
so i ask who is next to benefit
this crime is murdering of a murderer
the benefit is perhaps
to the spirit an
ease of suffering
to quite a shouting voice in the
head that prevents sleep
there is a murderer among us
so
we have dr arbuthnot a dedicated
grateful friend to colonel armstrong
he meets and finds solace in the company
of the governess mary debenham
who is almost like a
mother to the little girl
and so close to mrs
armstrongs young sister
helena goldenberg
married to a powerful man
no stranger to rage and violence
we travel also with
daisys godmother
to whom belongs
the monogrammed handkerchief
found at the scene of the crime
the letter h in the russian alphabet
of course pronounced n
natalia dragomiroff
and her devoted maid with the chefs eye
who was she before her current employ
might i suggest the armstrongs cook
but we are not yet done
the nurse in charge of daisy
her new found religious ill born of
guilt of allowing her child
to be abducted it was you
who was in her room the night when
rachette came in through the window
did you have a glass of wine
too many with your supper that night
have you blamed
yourself ever since
for not being alert to stop him
she knew nothing but kindness
and love until
until i
no need to divine with me sir
i was colonel armstrongs
bat man in the war
and afterwards his valet in new york
as fine a man has god ever made
would his chauffeur agree
was it a bank loan secured by armstrong
allows him to build his automobile empire
he is in debt for life
who else can we count
what of the pinkerton
detective once a police officer
assigned to the armstrong case
and he becomes attached to some one for
there is another uncelebrated victim
you fell in love with the maid
before she was falsely accused
you quit the police when
you witnessed the
the travesty of justice
when mcqueens father insisted
on her arrest
when she took her own life
no no no
susanne was a so gentle
and she fell for me
old and already getting grey
i told her she could do better
but there she was
on time for every date
why else
is a train so full
in the dead of winter
why the inconsistent
why the abundance of evidence why
why the conductor
pierre michel of avignon
who lost his sister
the accused maid
susanne michele
only one soul can claim to have
lost more than any of you
the tragic linda arden
mother of sonia
grandmother of daisy
retired from the stage
but for one final performance
you are an awfully clever man
a murderer should have one victim
when ratchett kills
daisi armstrong
a dozen lives are broken
deformed ended
they demand justice
of all these wounded souls we
must finally answer
who among them is a killer
who takes up the knife
the answer is
not single one of you could have done it
nor any pair
it can only have been done
by all of you
together
together
even when the avalanche
changes everything
as does the detective
plan was changed
the kimono the uniform
a remarkable improvisation the doctor
knows how to wound without killing
each had their part to play
do it
it was my plan
i recruited them
i had hardman track down cassetti
i sent mcqueen to work for
him and then masterman
mcqueen could arrange the travel
on the day that michel was on duty
mr ratchett
goodnight
and so it is done
for the death of the innocent
a life for a life
revenge
no one should hang for this but me
it was my plan
tell the police that it
was me alone
there is no life left in me anymore
they
have a chance now
helena i prey
has a chance
they can
go live
find some joy
somewhere
let it end with me
they are not killers
they are good people
they can be good again
there was right
there was wrong
and now there is you
i can not judge this
you must decide
do you wish to go free without
punishment for your crime
then you must only commit one more
ill not stop you
you cant let them kill you
you give my body to the lake and
you will go away innocent at the station
you must silence me
bouc can lie
i can not
do it one of you
no
i already died with daisy
no
you said your role was to find justice
what is justice here
sometimes the law of man is not enough
where does conscience lie
buried with daisy
my dear colonel armstrong
finally i can answer your letter
at least with the thoughts in head
and the feeling in my heart
that somewhere
you can hear me
ive now discovered the truth of
the case and it is
profoundly disturbing
i have seen the fracture of the human soul
so many broken lives so
much pain and anger
giving way to the poison
of deep grief
until one crime became many
i have always wanted to believe
that man is rational and civilized
my very existence depends
upon this hope
upon order and methods
and the little gray cells
but now perhaps im asked
to listen instead
to my heart
ladies and gentlemen
i have understood in this case
that the scales of justice
cannot always be evenly weighed
and i must learn for once
to live with the imbalance
there are no killers here
only the people who deserve
a chance to heal
the police have accepted my
first solution to the crime
the lone assassin who made his escape
i will leave the train
here to conclude formalities
you are all free to go
may you find your peace with this
may we all
hello
im looking for a mr poirot
he is needed on a very urgent matter
he is on holiday
the kassner case again
no sir far worse
i have to take you to
egypt straight away
there was a murder sir
right on the bloody nile
are you the detective
yes
i am the detective
