true love is hard to find 
sometimes you think you have true love 
and then you catch the early flight
home from san diego 
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded
like a goddamn magic show 
ready to double  team your girlfriend   
it stops right there
and it continues right here 
because i think what mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind 
let s raise our glasses 
whatever we got in front of us 
salute  health and happiness 
cheers  everybody

  you look great 
  really 
god  i went a little bit   
got crazy last night 
yeah  i still haven t heard from frank 
i m a little worried 
hello 
come on in  jesus 
is this one of your guys here 
  about three fire hazards over here 
  what are you doing  man 
cheese  is that you 
hello  mitch  bernard 
i see you guys haven t changed much 
who is this 
remember cheese 
rodney s kid brother 
actually  my name isn t cheese anymore 
it s gordon pritchard 
oh  yeah 
cheese 
didn t we lock you in a dumpster one time 
i got out 
cool  man 
i m glad you did 
  you had a good time last night 
  yeah 
there might be some whippits
lying around if you want them 
  no  thanks  i m working 
  working what 
campus patrol 
  try again 
  you a jehovah s witness 
  i m the dean 
dean pritchard  yeah 
and as of this morning 
this house has been rezoned 
it is now exclusively
for campus use only 
what are you talking about 
you can t just do that  i ve already paid
the first and last month s rent 
take a look at that 
you have a week to vacate the premises 
and i thank you for your cooperation 
great 
  can i ask you a question 
  absolutely not 
it s been good seeing you guys 
it looks like you re doing great 
frank  this is a safe place 
it s a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings 
think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding 
we can say anything here 
anything 
it s okay  honey 
that s why we came 
well  i guess i   
deep down i m feeling a little confused 
i mean  suddenly you get married
and you re supposed
to be this entirely different guy 
i don t feel different 
take yesterday  for example 
we were out at the olive garden
for dinner  which was lovely 
and   
i happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order 
and i found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be 
her panties 
odds are they re probably
basic white  cotton underpants 
but i started thinking 
 well  maybe they re silk panties  
 maybe it s a thong  
 maybe it s something really cool
that i don t even know about  
you know  and i started feeling   
what 
i thought we were in the trust tree 
in the nest  are we not 
  we are  it s okay 
  okay 
it s okay  please continue 
i don t know
where i was going with that 
i guess what i m trying to say
is that now that i m married 
i m definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact
that i m gonna have sex
with only one person
for the rest of my life 
walsh tells me
your san diego trip was a blast 
yeah 
how was hooters 
i actually didn t go to hooters 
yeah  right 
skittles 
no  thanks 
listen  i got a call from manetti 
he tells me that your sunshine square
proposal is totally fucked 
what s wrong with it 
well  for one thing  it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth
in the national historical
preservation act of 1966 
most notably  clause four 
shall i continue 
  actually  i m familiar with that item   
  honey 
  hi  dad  am i interrupting 
  no  come in 
i don t think you ve met my daughter 
darcie  this is mitch martin 
nice to meet you  mitch 
hi  nice to meet you 
  how was the slumber party 
  great  you know 
movies and popcorn 
she s an angel 
it makes me sound an old man  but i can t
believe how fast she s growing up 
  dad  stop 
  i m sorry honey  but it s true 
to think that in just seven months
you ll be graduating from high school 
you okay 
i thought you said high school 
yeah 
shocking  isn t it 
yes  it is 
give me a break 
hey  mitch 
hey  man  did you have a good day 
not too bad 
what s going on 
i thought maybe i could crash here
tonight  if that s all right 
marissa is going through
some personal stuff 
personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked 
that and some other stuff 
no problem 
make yourself at home 
thanks 
gentlemen  we re discussing
a brand new way to look at a fraternity 
in other words  forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society 
because this is a very big idea 
my friends 
we are talking about a non exclusive 
egalitarian brotherhood
where community status
and more importantly  age 
have no bearing whatsoever 
yeah  from the guy who probably
won t get in 
  i go to school here 
  okay 
i was curious  what association
will you have with the actual university 
  who are these people 
  i don t know 
legally speaking 
there will be a loose affiliation 
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community 
as well as provide no public service
of any kind  this much i promise 
what the hell is going on here 
guys  this is a very special occasion 
the godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence 
  the godfather 
this is his damn house 
he lives here  he sleeps 20 feet away 
we need to talk 
kitchen 
sit good for me  i m gonna talk
to uncle mitch for a second 
there you go  buddy 
  how long have these people been here 
  all day 
that party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred 
what are you talking about 
this is called  rush  
we re officially starting a fraternity 
i like it  it s genius 
you ve got to be kidding me 
you heard pritchard  all right 
we re obligated to do this 
this house  he says  is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing 
fraternity solves both of those 
but this is my house 
i live here  beanie 
i m 30 years old 
none of us are enrolled in the college 
i understand that  you re focused
on all the wrong sort of details 
did you or did you not
have a good time at the party 
i had an awesome time 
i know you had an awesome time 
the entire town knows
you had an awesome time 
i m trying to ask mitch whether
he had an awesome time 
  i had a good time 
  okay  that s good 
wouldn t you want those good times
to keep going 
  more good   
  god  i mean   
i don t understand  i don t know why it s
so hard for you to admit you want this 
we got 40 guys that want this 
there must be a reason for it 
look  i appreciate your enthusiasm 
i know you guys are trying to help 
but the truth of the matter is 
i ve had a hell of a day 
an even worse month 
and the fact is 
i ve got 40 strangers out in my living room
and all i want to do is
get some fuckin  sleep 
so  i m sorry  but we re not
starting a fraternity 
i don t know why you got to do it
in front of the kid  with the  f ing  
all you got to do is
say  earmuffs  to him 
then you can say 
 fuck  shit  bitch   whatever you want 
cock  balls 
i m just proving a point 
you don t have to celebrate it  frank 
  sorry 
  don t say sorry to me 
you let down frank  you let down me 
you let down max  most importantly 
and right about now  i m
having a real hard time trying
to figure out why i take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over   
earmuffs  that whore that you dated 
wanna go out and see the other guys 
uncle mitch is sorry 
say  yes  
yes 
here s the deal 
listen up 
all together  we ve picked
14 pledges 
wait  who s this guy 
that s blue 
he s an old navy vet
who hangs around my store a lot 
but don t worry about it 
he s legit 
he looks like he s 100 years old 
he wants to pledge 
are you kidding me 
the old man river won t shut up about it 
go time 
don t make this any harder
on yourself 
what s going on 
you tell anyone about this 
i ll fuckin  kill you 
i m kidding  we ll have him back tonight 
okay  sweetie 
let s go 
come on  let s go 
there we go  blue 
congratulations  gentlemen 
you should all be
very proud of yourselves 
each and every one of you
has been hand picked
to represent our inaugural
pledge class 
over the next 21 days 
you re all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain 
d ahhh 
frank  just pace yourself 
copy that  just got
a little overexcited  sorry 
at this point
you may be asking yourself 
 why am i holding
this 30 pound cinderblock in my hands  
you might also ask yourself 
 why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string
tied to it  
and finally 
 why s the other end of this string
tied securely
to your penis  
and the answer  ladies  is trust 
this is your first test 
spanish 
do you trust we ve provided you
with enough slack
so your block will land safely
on the lawn 
sir  yes  sir 
  and blue 
  yes  sir 
do you trust that i do not want
to see you die here tonight 
  sir  yes  sir 
  blue  you re my boy 
thank you  sir 
about face 
step to the edge 
pledges  prepare to release 
one

aahh 
oh    
wasn t meant to happen
like that  weensie 
walk it off  big guy

status by the student council 
half these guys don t even
go to the school 
you see the one guy  he s like 90 
technically  that doesn t matter 
they found a loophole 
  a loophole 
  yes 
well  it s interesting  sir 
as stupid as they appear 
they re actually very good at paperwork 
it s quite an anomaly 
i m sorry  is that funny

i was even thinking maybe tonight
we could get together back at home 
and  i don t know 
maybe put on the sisqo cd   
i don t think that s such a good idea 
really  you don t 
i don t know 
maybe we rushed into this 
you know 
i mean  it just doesn t

being married 
what do you mean 
i mean  i think we should

like a real divorce 
yeah

i m sorry

but  if i don t talk to you 
keep on  keep trucking  you know 
okay  good stuff 
well  what do you think 
yeah  it s okay 
  just okay 
  yeah 
i had mitch take a look at the lease 
he thinks it sounds like a good deal 
you had mitch look at the lease 
when 
last week 
i stopped by his office 
  oh  god 
  what 
i don t know 
i m not so sure about that guy 
mitch  why  he s so sweet 
something i saw last week 
at the birthday party 
what did you see 
i didn t want to get into this  but   
i walked in on him  and he was
harassing one of the caterers 
a young girl 
  really 
  yeah 
he was being aggressive
and grabbing her and stuff 
it was disgusting 
i didn t want to say anything
 cause he s your friend 
  hello 
  hey nicole  it s mitch 
hi  mitch 
i was thinking  if you re not too busy 
maybe i d take you up
on that cup of coffee 
  now s not really a good time 
  look 
i m really sorry about the other day 
i want the chance to explain everything 
  i don t think so 
  it s   
it s been kind of a tough day 
and it d really mean a lot 
listen  there are a few things
i wanted to clear up 
because i get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who i am 
really  what would
ever give you that idea 
okay  that s one pecan pie
and two coffees 
and don t worry  for the godfather 
it s always on the house 
  not here 
  i know who you are 
i am avi  i m a big supporter
of what you guys are doing 
thank you 
you are beautiful 
no offense  though  he is the king 
you are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend 
that s very kind 
but i insist  i ll pay 
your money  it s not good here 
  okay 
  i look forward to pledging next semester 
okay  now don t you think
this is going a little far 
i heard one of your pledges died 
is that true 
well  yes 
but he was really old 
and i feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back 
it ll show that it was probably
of natural causes 
look  to be honest  you re really not
the person i thought you were 
but it s okay  it s not a big deal 
i think that i am that person 
and i feel more like myself now
than i have in a really long time 
so  that s why you go around
harassing young women 
  doing what 
  the caterer 
at the birthday party 
mark told me about her 
wait a second 
i didn t want to say anything 
but mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate 
  you are unbelievable 
  it s true 
hey  look who it is 
hey  mitch 
darcie  hey 
hi  i ve been meaning to call you 
i just didn t want you
to worry about my dad 
he doesn t know anything 
so it s totally cool 
her dad 
  yeah 
  yeah 
you know  it s nothing  really 
i mean  they actually work together 
we gotta run   cause we got this prom
committee thing  so i ll see you around 
sorry 
bye 
prom committee thing 
that i actually can explain 
right  i m sure you can 
  i have to go 
  please wait a second

dear mitch  if you re holding this letter 
you already know 
the house has been boarded up 
the windows  the doors  everything

room 112 
i love you  frank 
due to these infractions 
not only will your house be repossessed 
but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university
for your participation in
a non sanctioned fraternity 
please take a moment to
allow this information to sink in 
good  believe me 
the actions taken by the student council
have come as a great shock to me 
but unfortunately  there s nothing
i can do about it 
thank you for your time 
good luck  and god bless america 
he can t do that 
this guy s playing hardball 
i got to say

well  good  carry on 
see  that s why they call him
the godfather 
hey 
just take care of it 
gentlemen  i got some good news
and i got some bad news 
did a little research 
what pritchard did  technically 
is illegal 
we have the right to a formal evaluation
before they can deny
our official application 
however  we re now subject to
a charter certification review
given by the board of trustees 
damn it 
wait  wait  what does
that mean exactly 
according to university bylaws 
it s a thorough inspection of the fraternity 
and our contribution to the community 
focus is on five categories 
academics  athletics  community service 
debate  and school spirit 
good luck to everybody 
it was nice to know you all 
and i ll see you around campus 
actually  all of us are
being tested  yeah 
what are you talking about 
i m not even in school 
it s in the bylaws  every member
of the fraternity is subject to review
in every category 
including academics 
mitch  can you come here a second 
i don t mind popping for breakfast 
i do speakers  i don t do tests 
this is unbelievable 
what happened to   needing brotherhood
now more than ever   they need us 
come on  college is
overrated anyway 
i built speaker city from the ground up 
i can barely read  truth 
this damn thing was your idea 
and you convinced me to do it 
and now people s lives are ruined 
ruined  like  whose life is ruined 
well  let s see 
blue s dead 
frank s divorced 
i ve lost my house 
nicole thinks i m a total jackass 
and now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school 
and you re not even gonna
help  em out 
is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what  i m missing 18 holes of golf here 
one hundred percent 
i got creative with some of their tests 
it should make for
a very entertaining day 
i m going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus 
ditto 
welcome  everyone  to the official
debate section of the charter review 
unfortunately 
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict  yeah 
so  we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event 
ladies and gentlemen  please welcome
the co host of cnn s crossfire 
famed political consultant 
the raging cajun 
mr  james carville 
  thank you 
  don t clap 
thank you  dean pritchard 
it s an honor and pleasure to be here  sir 
topic number one 
what is your position
on the role of government
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology 
well  dean  i m glad you
asked that question   
i d like to jump in and take that one 
jimmy  if you don t mind 
have at it  hoss 
why doesn t he wait for an easy one 
recent research has shown
the empirical evidence
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited 
and as a corollary  the market
for technologies is shrinking 
as a world leader 
it is important for america to provide
systematic research grants
for our scientists 
i believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well articulated innovation policy
with emphasis on
human resource development  thank you 
where d that come from 
what happened  i blacked out 
it was awesome 
that was interesting 
thank you very much 
and your rebuttal 
mr  carville 
we have no response 
that was perfect 
that s the way you do it 
that s the way you debate 
number 12 
which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique
for determining first order
system parameters 
is it  a  harriot s method
of solving cubics 
b  pythagorean triplets 
or c  the migration method of graphing
quadratic functions 
harriot s method of solving cubics 
the answer is a  harriot s method
of solving cubics 
good test 
all right  frank  let s do this 
go harrison 
  yes 
  wow 
go  cougars 
oh  no 
help me  help me 
dean pritchard
