true love is hard to find

and then you catch the early flight
home from san diego
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

about three fire hazards over here
what are you doing man
cheese is that you
hello mitch bernard
i see you guys havent changed much
who is this
remember cheese
rodneys kid brother

there might be some whippits
lying around if you want them
no thanks im working
working what
campus patrol
try again
you a jehovahs witness
im the dean
dean pritchard yeah
and as of this morning
this house has been rezoned
it is now exclusively
for campus use only
what are you talking about
you cant just do that ive already paid
the first and last months rent
take a look at that
you have a week to vacate the premises
and i thank you for your cooperation
great
can i ask you a question
absolutely not
its been good seeing you guys
it looks like youre doing great
frank this is a safe place
its a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings
think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding
we can say anything here
anything
its okay honey
thats why we came
well i guess i
deep down im feeling a little confused
i mean suddenly you get married
and youre supposed
to be this entirely different guy
i dont feel different
take yesterday for example
we were out at the olive garden
for dinner which was lovely
and
i happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order
and i found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be
her panties
odds are theyre probably
basic white cotton underpants
but i started thinking
well maybe theyre silk panties
maybe its a thong
maybe its something really cool
that i dont even know about
you know and i started feeling
what
i thought we were in the trust tree
in the nest are we not
we are its okay
okay
its okay please continue
i dont know
where i was going with that
i guess what im trying to say
is that now that im married
im definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact
that im gonna have sex
with only one person
for the rest of my life
walsh tells me
your san diego trip was a blast
yeah
how was hooters
i actually didnt go to hooters
yeah right
skittles
no thanks
listen i got a call from manetti
he tells me that your sunshine square
proposal is totally fucked
whats wrong with it
well for one thing it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth
in the national historical
preservation act of 1966
most notably clause four
shall i continue
actually im familiar with that item
honey
hi dad am i interrupting
no come in
i dont think youve met my daughter
darcie this is mitch martin
nice to meet you mitch
hi nice to meet you
how was the slumber party
great you know
movies and popcorn
shes an angel
it makes me sound an old man but i cant
believe how fast shes growing up
dad stop
im sorry honey but its true
to think that in just seven months
youll be graduating from high school
you okay
i thought you said high school
yeah
shocking isnt it
yes it is
give me a break
hey mitch
hey man did you have a good day
not too bad
whats going on
i thought maybe i could crash here
tonight if thats all right
marissa is going through
some personal stuff
personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked
that and some other stuff
no problem
make yourself at home
thanks
gentlemen were discussing
a brandnew way to look at a fraternity
in other words forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society
because this is a very big idea
my friends
we are talking about a nonexclusive
egalitarian brotherhood
where community status
and more importantly age
have no bearing whatsoever
yeah from the guy who probably
wont get in
i go to school here
okay
i was curious what association
will you have with the actual university
who are these people
i dont know
legally speaking
there will be a loose affiliation
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community
as well as provide no public service
of any kind this much i promise
what the hell is going on here
guys this is a very special occasion
the godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence
the godfather
this is his damn house
he lives here he sleeps 20 feet away
we need to talk
kitchen
sit good for me im gonna talk
to uncle mitch for a second
there you go buddy
how long have these people been here
all day
that party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred
what are you talking about
this is called rush
were officially starting a fraternity
i like it its genius
youve got to be kidding me
you heard pritchard all right
were obligated to do this
this house he says is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing
fraternity solves both of those
but this is my house
i live here beanie
im 30 years old
none of us are enrolled in the college
i understand that youre focused
on all the wrong sort of details
did you or did you not
have a good time at the party
i had an awesome time
i know you had an awesome time
the entire town knows
you had an awesome time
im trying to ask mitch whether
he had an awesome time
i had a good time
okay thats good
wouldnt you want those good times
to keep going
more good
god i mean
i dont understand i dont know why its
so hard for you to admit you want this
we got 40 guys that want this
there must be a reason for it
look i appreciate your enthusiasm
i know you guys are trying to help
but the truth of the matter is
ive had a hell of a day
an even worse month
and the fact is
ive got 40 strangers out in my living room
and all i want to do is
get some fuckin sleep
so im sorry but were not
starting a fraternity
i dont know why you got to do it
in front of the kid with the fing
all you got to do is
say earmuffs to him
then you can say
fuck shit bitch whatever you want
cock balls
im just proving a point
you dont have to celebrate it frank
sorry
dont say sorry to me
you let down frank you let down me
you let down max most importantly
and right about now im
having a real hard time trying
to figure out why i take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over
earmuffs that whore that you dated
wanna go out and see the other guys
uncle mitch is sorry
say yes
yes
heres the deal
listen up
all together weve picked
14 pledges
wait whos this guy
thats blue
hes an old navy vet
who hangs around my store a lot
but dont worry about it
hes legit
he looks like hes 100 years old
he wants to pledge
are you kidding me
the old man river wont shut up about it
go time
dont make this any harder
on yourself
whats going on
you tell anyone about this
ill fuckin kill you
im kidding well have him back tonight
okay sweetie
lets go
come on lets go
there we go blue
congratulations gentlemen
you should all be
very proud of yourselves
each and every one of you
has been handpicked
to represent our inaugural
pledge class
over the next 21 days
youre all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain
dahhh
frank just pace yourself
copy that just got
a little overexcited sorry
at this point
you may be asking yourself
why am i holding
this 30pound cinderblock in my hands
you might also ask yourself
why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string
tied to it
and finally
whys the other end of this string
tied securely
to your penis
and the answer ladies is trust
this is your first test
spanish
do you trust weve provided you
with enough slack
so your block will land safely
on the lawn
sir yes sir
and blue
yes sir
do you trust that i do not want
to see you die here tonight
sir yes sir
blue youre my boy
thank you sir
about face

pledges prepare to release

you had mitch look at the lease
when
last week
i stopped by his office
oh god
what
i dont know
im not so sure about that guy
mitch why hes so sweet
something i saw last week
at the birthday party
what did you see
i didnt want to get into this but
i walked in on him and he was
harassing one of the caterers
a young girl
really
yeah
he was being aggressive
and grabbing her and stuff
it was disgusting
i didnt want to say anything
cause hes your friend
hello
hey nicole its mitch
hi mitch
i was thinking if youre not too busy
maybe id take you up
on that cup of coffee
nows not really a good time
look
im really sorry about the other day
i want the chance to explain everything
i dont think so
its
its been kind of a tough day
and itd really mean a lot
listen there are a few things
i wanted to clear up
because i get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who i am
really what would
ever give you that idea
okay thats one pecan pie
and two coffees
and dont worry for the godfather
its always on the house
not here
i know who you are
i am avi im a big supporter
of what you guys are doing
thank you
you are beautiful
no offense though he is the king
you are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend
thats very kind
but i insist ill pay
your money its not good here
okay
i look forward to pledging next semester
okay now dont you think
this is going a little far
i heard one of your pledges died
is that true
well yes
but he was really old
and i feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back
itll show that it was probably
of natural causes
look to be honest youre really not
the person i thought you were
but its okay its not a big deal
i think that i am that person
and i feel more like myself now
than i have in a really long time
so thats why you go around
harassing young women
doing what
the caterer
at the birthday party
mark told me about her

but mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate
you are unbelievable

is illegal
we have the right to a formal evaluation
before they can deny
our official application
however were now subject to
a charter certification review
given by the board of trustees
damn it
wait wait what does
that mean exactly
according to university bylaws
its a thorough inspection of the fraternity
and our contribution to the community
focus is on five categories
academics athletics community service
debate and school spirit
good luck to everybody
it was nice to know you all
and ill see you around campus
actually all of us are
being tested yeah
what are you talking about
im not even in school
its in the bylaws every member
of the fraternity is subject to review
in every category
including academics
mitch can you come here a second
i dont mind popping for breakfast
i do speakers i dont do tests
this is unbelievable
what happened to needing brotherhood
now more than ever they need us

overrated anyway

and you convinced me to do it
and now peoples lives are ruined
ruined like whose life is ruined
well lets see

ditto
welcome everyone to the official
debate section of the charter review

ladies and gentlemen please welcome
the cohost of cnns crossfire
famed political consultant
the raging cajun
mr james carville
thank you
dont clap
thank you dean pritchard
its an honor and pleasure to be here sir
topic number one
what is your position
on the role of government
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology
well dean im glad you
asked that question
id like to jump in and take that one
jimmy if you dont mind
have at it hoss
why doesnt he wait for an easy one
recent research has shown
the empirical evidence
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited
and as a corollary the market
for technologies is shrinking
as a world leader
it is important for america to provide
systematic research grants
for our scientists
i believe there will always be a need for us
to have a wellarticulated innovation policy
with emphasis on
human resource development thank you
whered that come from
what happened i blacked out
it was awesome
that was interesting
thank you very much
and your rebuttal
mr carville
we have no response
that was perfect
thats the way you do it
thats the way you debate
number 12

a generally accepted graphical technique
for determining first order
system parameters

or c the migration method of graphing
