shes no good
what can i tell you
when youre right youre right
and youre right
ill pay you the rest next week
we only caught 60 tons of skipjack
they pay less for skipjack
than albacore tuna
i only brought it up to illustrate a point
i dont want your last dime
thank you mr gittes
call me jake careful driving home
mrs mulwray is waiting for you
with mr walsh and mr duffy
mrs mulwray may i present mr gittes
mrs mulwray how do you
mr gittes
what seems to be the problem
my husband i believe
is seeing another woman
no really
i am sorry
mr gittes do you think
we could discuss this alone
im afraid not
these are my operatives
and at some point
theyll have to assist me
i cant do everything myself
of course not
what makes you certain that your
husband is involved with someone
a wife can tell
do you love your husband
yes of course
then go home and forget everything
im sure he loves you too do you know
the expression let sleeping dogs lie
youre better off not knowing
i have to know
very well
what is your husbands first name
hollis hollis mulwray
water and power
hes chief engineer
chief engineer
this type of investigation
can be hard on your pocketbook
it takes time
money doesnt matter to me
okay well see what we can do
today you can hop a streetcar and in
25 minutes you end up in the pacific
you can swim in it and fish in it
but you cant drink it
you cant
irrigate an orange grove with it
we live next door to the ocean
but we also live on the edge of a desert
los angeles is a desert community
beneath this building is a desert
without water the dust will rise up
cover us as though we never existed
the alto vallejo can save us from this
i suggest that 8½ million dollars
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets
and not on top of them
mayor bagby lets hear from
all the departments again
wed better take water and power first
mr mulwray
in case youve forgotten over 500 died
when the van der lip dam gave way
this shale is similar to the permeable
shale in the van der lip disaster
it couldnt withstand
that kind of pressure
now you propose
another dirtbanked dam
with slopes of 2½ to 1 112 feet high
and a 12000acre water surface
well it wont hold
i wont build it its that simple
im not going to make
the same mistake twice
what the hell are you doing
get those goddam things out of here
tell me where to take them
you dont have an answer for that
you steal water from the valley
ruin the grazing starve the livestock
whos paying you to do that mulwray
thats what i want to know
jeez he was there all night
thats right
i had to go back three times
to pick up the watches
yesterday he went to three reservoirs
a mens room and the pig  whistle
the guys got water on the brain
so what have you got
this
they got into a terrific argument
what about
i dont know the traffic was loud
i heard one thing though
apple core
apple core
yeah
is that what you spent the day doing
you said to take pictures so i did
let me explain
something to you walsh
this business requires
a certain amount of finesse
what is it sophie
duffys on the phone
duff where are you
the buzzards got a cute little twist
slow down where are you
theyre in echo park in a rowboat

fools names and fools faces
whats that pal
youve got some way to make a living
what do you do to make ends meet
mortgages first national bank
did you foreclose
on many families this week
we dont publish records in the paper
neither do i
no you have your press agent do it
is this bimbo a regular customer
i make an honest living i help people
when theyre in a desperate situation
i dont kick families out of their houses
like you bums at the bank do
maybe youd like to go outside
and discuss it what do you think
let me tell you about the guy
i dont know how it got in the paper
i make an honest living
of course you do
anyway this guy got tired
of screwing his wife
so his friend says he should do
what the chinese do
duffy hey walsh sophie
go to the little girls room for a minute
but mr gittes
yes mr gittes
i want to tell you a story theres a
guy whos tired of screwing his wife
jake theres a problem
wait a second
his friend says to do it like the chinese
do it how do the chinese do it
well first they screw a little bit
then they read a little confucius
come back screw a little bit more
then they stop again
jake
walsh just listen youll love this
they go back
and they screw a little bit more
and then they contemplate the moon
it makes it more exciting
so now the guy goes home
and starts screwing his own wife
so he screws her a little then goes out
of the room and reads life magazine
he goes back in and screws her a bit
then goes out and smokes a cigarette
his wife is sore so the next time hes
going out to look at the moon she says
hey whats the matter with you

with all this business in the papers
about mr mulwray
right this way
after youve worked with a man
for a certain length of time
you come to know
his habits and values
either hes the kind who chases
after women or he isnt

doing what
theres been threats to the reservoirs
any particular reason
rationing the farmers are desperate
but the city needs drinking water

caught with his pants down
unless its a problem
id like to talk to your husband
may i speak frankly mrs mulwray

that little girlfriend she was pretty
in a cheap sort of way of course
shes disappeared
maybe they disappeared together
if they did how does that affect you
its nothing personal
its very personal
it couldnt be more personal
is this an obsession with you
lets look at it this way
this phoney broad excuse
the language tells me shes you
whoever put her up to it isnt after me
theyre out to get your husband
if i can see him i can help him
did you talk to him this morning

knocked him unconscious
mrs mulwray this alleged affair
your husband was having
the publicity didnt make him
morose or unhappy
it didnt make him happy
he couldnt have taken his own life
no

of the young lady in question
no
or where she might be
you and your husband

he wouldnt tell me her name
we quarrelled over her of course
it came as a complete surprise to me
a complete surprise i thought
you hired a private investigator
a private investigator
mr gittes
yes but i did that to put an end to
a ridiculous rumour that had no basis
when did mr gittes inform you that the
rumours had some foundation in fact
just before the story broke
in the papers
you wouldnt happen to know where
i could find her or her name
no
of course not
will you need me for anything else

no wanna guess
no okay
they lose their noses
next time you lose the whole thing
ill cut it off
and feed it to my goldfish understand
understand
i understand
so a contractor wants to build a dam
and makes a few payoffs so what
you cant nail mulvihill
theyll claim you were trespassing
i dont want mulvihill i want the
big boys that are making the payoffs
then whatll you do
sue the shit out of them
what is it sophie
a miss sessions is calling
who
ida sessions
dont know her take a number
people like that will be having dinner
with the judge whos trying the suit
im sorry miss sessions insists
she says you know her
okay
hello miss sessions
i dont believe weve had the pleasure
oh yes we have are you alone
isnt everyone
what can i do for you
well im a working girl i didnt
come in to see you on my own
when did you come in
i pretended to be mrs mulwray
shut the fuck up
yes i remember
is something wrong
i was just checking with an associate
go on
i never expected all this to happen
if it gets out i want someone to know
that i didnt know what would happen
i understand who was your employer
it would be helpful to both of us
oh no no
whats your address
maybe we could talk this over
just look in the obituary column
of todays la postrecord
youll find one of those people
sure
how do you like them apples
thank you for coming
yes sir
drink
tom collins with lime not lemon
i got your check in the mail
as i said i was very grateful
im afraid thats not good enough
how much would you like
oh stop it the moneys fine
but i think you shortchanged me
on the story
something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you
you were upset but not that upset
dont tell me how i feel
sorry
you sue me your husband dies
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato
all of it quicker than the wind
from a ducks ass excuse me
then you ask me to lie to the police
it wasnt much of a lie
if he was killed it was this could look
like a payoff to withhold evidence
but he wasnt killed
mrs mulwray
i think youre hiding something
i suppose i am
actually i knew about the affair
how did you find out
my husband
he told you and you werent
in the least bit upset
i was grateful
youll have to explain that
why
when a wife tells me shes happy
that her husband is cheating on her
it runs contrary to my experience
unless what
she was cheating on him
were you
i dislike the word cheat
did you have affairs
did he know about it
i wouldnt run home and tell him
whenever id been to bed with another
anything else you want to know
where were you when hollis died
i cant tell you
you dont know
i cant tell you
you were seeing someone too
for very long
i dont see anyone for very long
its difficult for me
now i think you know
all you need know about me
i didnt want publicity i didnt want to
go into all of this then or now
is that all
oh by the way
what does this c stand for
cross
thats your maiden name
yes why
no reason
you must have had a reason to ask
no im just a snoop
no i have my own car the packard
wait a minute sonny
i think you better come with me
theres nothing more to say
get my car please
okay but in case youre interested
your husband was murdered
someones been dumping thousands
of tons of water from the reservoirs
and were supposedly in a drought
he found out about it and he was killed
theres a drowned drunk involuntary
manslaughter if anyone took the time
it seems like half the city is trying
to cover it up which is fine by me
but i goddam near lost my nose
and i like it
i like breathing through it
and i still think
that youre hiding something
mr gittes
jj gittes to see mr yelburton
mr yelburton will be busy
for some time
well its my lunch hour i can wait
hes liable to be tied up indefinitely
i take a long lunch hour
all day sometimes
noah cross worked for the company
yes no
did he or didnt he
he owned it
he owned the water department
yes
you mean he owned
the entire water supply for the city
howd they get it away from him
mulwray felt the public should own it
mr mulwray
i thought you said cross owned it
along with mr mulwray
they were partners
yes they were partners
mr yelburton will see you now
mr gittes sorry to keep you waiting
these staff meetings just go on and on
it must be especially tough to take over
under these circumstances
yes hollis was the best
department chief the city ever had
what happened to your nose
cut myself shaving
that must really smart
only when i breathe
only when you breathe dont tell me
youre still working for mrs mulwray
i never was
i dont understand
neither do i actually
you hired me
or you hired that chippie to hire me
youre not making a bit of sense
lets look at it this way
mulwray didnt want to build a dam
his reputation was hard to get around
you decided to ruin it then he found
out you were dumping water at night
then he was drowned
thats an outrageous accusation
i dont know what youre talking about
well whitey mehrholtz
over at the times will
dumping thousands of gallons of water
in the middle of a drought is news
mr gittes
were not anxious for it to get around
but we have been diverting water
to irrigate orange groves
in the northwest valley
they have no legal right to our water
but weve been trying to help them out
when you divert water
theres a little runoff
yeah a little runoff
where did you say those groves were
in the northwest valley
thats like saying theyre in arizona
my field men are out
i cant give you the exact location
youre a married man arent you
hard working wife kids
yes
i dont want to nail you
i want to find out who put you up to it
ill give you a few days to think on it
call me i can help who knows
maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big shots and you can stay
head of the department for 20 years
drink
no thank you
what is your usual salary
35 a day plus 20 for my associates
plus expenses
plus a bonus if i show results
whoever killed my husband
why have they gone to all this trouble
money how they plan to make it
emptying reservoirs i dont know
ill pay your salary plus 5000
if you find out what happened
to hollis and who is involved
sophie draw up one of our
standard contracts for mrs mulwray
were you married before mulwray and
your father sold the water department
noah cross is your father isnt he
yes of course
it was sometime after i was just out
of grade school when they did that
then you married
your fathers business partner
youve already got one going
does my talking about your father
upset you
no
yes a little
you see hollis and my fa
my father
had a falling out finally
over you or the water department
why should it be over me
then it was over the water department
hollis felt the water should belong to
the public i think my father disagreed
actually it was over the
van der lip dam the dam that broke
hollis never forgave him for it
never forgave him for what
for talking him into building it
they never spoke from that time on
you sure about that
of course im sure
sign here
the copys for you
mr gittes
how do you do
you got a nasty reputation i like that
thanks
youre not a bank president in your
business its good advertising
it doesnt hurt
it helps get a client like my daughter
probably
im surprised you still work for her
unless shes suddenly come up
with another husband
she happens to think
the last one was murdered
how did she get that idea
i think i gave it to her
i hope you dont mind i believe
they should be served with the head
as long as you dont
serve the chicken that way
tell me what do the police say
theyre calling it an accident
whos the investigating officer
lt lou escobar
you know him
