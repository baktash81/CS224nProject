  she s no good 
  what can i tell you 
when you re right  you re right 
and you re right 
i ll pay you the rest next week 
we only caught 60 tons of skipjack 
they pay less for skipjack
than albacore tuna 
i only brought it up to illustrate a point 
i don t want your last dime 
  thank you  mr gittes 
  call me jake  careful driving home 
mrs mulwray is waiting for you 
with mr walsh and mr duffy 
mrs mulwray  may i present mr gittes 
  mrs mulwray  how do you 
  mr gittes 
what seems to be the problem 
my husband    i believe
is seeing another woman 
no    really 
i am sorry 
mr gittes  do you think
we could discuss this alone 
i m afraid not 
these are my operatives   
  and at some point
they ll have to assist me 
  i can t do everything myself 
  of course not 
what makes you certain that your
husband is involved with someone 
a wife can tell 
  do you love your husband 
  yes  of course 
then go home and forget everything 
i m sure he loves you too  do you know
the expression  let sleeping dogs lie 
  you re better off not knowing 
  i have to know 
very well 
  what is your husband s first name 
  hollis  hollis mulwray 
  water and power 
  he s chief engineer 
chief engineer 
this type of investigation
can be hard on your pocketbook 
  it takes time   
  money doesn t matter to me 
okay  we ll see what we can do 
today you can hop a streetcar  and in
25 minutes  you end up in the pacific 
you can swim in it and fish in it 
but you can t drink it 
you can t
irrigate an orange grove with it 
we live next door to the ocean 
but we also live on the edge of a desert 
los angeles is a desert community 
beneath this building is a desert 
without water  the dust will rise up
cover us as though we never existed 
the alto vallejo can save us from this 
i suggest that 8½ million dollars
is a fair price to pay  
  to keep the desert from our streets 
and not on top of them 
mayor bagby    let s hear from
all the departments again 
we d better take water and power first 
mr mulwray 
in case you ve forgotten  over 500 died
when the van der lip dam gave way 
this shale is similar to the permeable
shale in the van der lip disaster 
it couldn t withstand
that kind of pressure 
now you propose
another dirt banked dam   
  with slopes of 2½ to 1  112 feet high 
and a 12 000 acre water surface 
well  it won t hold 
i won t build it  it s that simple 
i m not going to make
the same mistake twice 
what the hell are you doing 
get those goddam things out of here 
tell me where to take them 
you don t have an answer for that 
you steal water from the valley 
ruin the grazing  starve the livestock   
who s paying you to do that  mulwray 
that s what i want to know 
  jeez  he was there all night 
  that s right 
i had to go back three times
to pick up the watches 
yesterday he went to three reservoirs 
a men s room  and the pig   whistle 
the guy s got water on the brain 
so what have you got 
  this 
  they got into a terrific argument 
  what about 
  i don t know  the traffic was loud 
i heard one thing though 
 apple core  
  apple core 
  yeah 
  is that what you spent the day doing 
  you said to take pictures  so i did 
let me explain
something to you  walsh 
this business requires
a certain amount of finesse 
  what is it  sophie 
  duffy s on the phone 
  duff  where are you 
  the buzzard s got a cute little twist 
  slow down  where are you 
  they re in echo park  in a rowboat 
okay   
echo park  water again 
okay  pal 
let s have us a big smile 
you ll love it 
when you get this much publicity 
you re practically a movie star 
  look at that  barn 
  yeah  the heat s murder 
fools  names and fools  faces 
  what s that  pal 
  you ve got some way to make a living 
  what do you do to make ends meet 
  mortgages  first national bank 
did you foreclose
on many families this week 
  we don t publish records in the paper 
  neither do i 
  no  you have your press agent do it 
  is this bimbo a regular customer 
i make an honest living  i help people
when they re in a desperate situation 
i don t kick families out of their houses
like you bums at the bank do 
maybe you d like to go outside
and discuss it  what do you think 
  let me tell you about the guy   
  i don t know how it got in the paper 
  i make an honest living 
  of course you do 
anyway  this guy got tired
of screwing his wife 
so his friend says he should do
what the chinese do   
duffy  hey  walsh  sophie 
go to the little girls  room for a minute 
but mr gittes   
yes  mr gittes 
i want to tell you a story  there s a
guy who s tired of screwing his wife   
  jake  there s a problem 
  wait a second 
his friend says to do it like the chinese
do it   how do the chinese do it  
 well  first they screw a little bit 
then they read a little confucius   
  come back  screw a little bit more 
then they stop again    
  jake 
  walsh  just listen  you ll love this 
 they go back
and they screw a little bit more   
  and then they contemplate the moon 
it makes it more exciting  
so now the guy goes home
and starts screwing his own wife 
so he screws her a little  then goes out
of the room and reads life magazine 
he goes back in and screws her a bit 
then goes out and smokes a cigarette 
his wife is sore  so the next time he s
going out to look at the moon she says 
 hey  what s the matter with you 
you re screwing just like a chinaman  
jesus  that barney   
  mr gittes 
  yes 
do you know me 
well    i think
i would have remembered 
  have we ever met 
  well  no 
  never 
  never 
that s what i thought  i m mrs evelyn
mulwray  mr mulwray s wife 
not that mulwray 
yes  mr gittes  that mulwray 
and since you agree
that we ve never met before   
  you must also agree that i never
hired you to spy on my husband 
i see you like publicity  mr gittes 
well  you re going to get it 
there s been some misunderstanding 
there s no need to get tough with me   
i don t get tough with anyone 
my lawyer does 
here s something for you  mr gittes 
i suppose we ll be hearing
from your attorney 
  mr mulwray 
  he s not in  mr    
  may i ask what it s regarding 
  it s personal  has he been gone long 
  since lunch 
  gee whiz  and i m late 
  he was expecting you 
  15 minutes ago  i ll go in and wait 
sir 
could i help you 
russ yelburton  deputy chief 
j j  gittes 
it s not a departmental matter 
  would you care to wait in my office 
  certainly 
we re a bit nervous 
with all this business in the papers  
  about mr mulwray 
right this way 
after you ve worked with a man
for a certain length of time   
  you come to know
his habits and values 
either he s the kind who chases
after women  or he isn t 
  mulwray never even kids about it 
  maybe he takes it very seriously 
  sit down 
  no  thank you 
  where is he having lunch 
  i m sorry  i don t know 
  well  tell him i ll be back 
  i will 
do you mind if i take one of your cards 
in case i have to get in touch with you 
  mulvihill  what are you doing here 
  they shut my water off  so what 
how d you find out  you don t drink it 
you don t take a bath in it   
they wrote you a letter    but then
you d have to be able to read 
relax  glad to see you 
  do you know claude mulvihill 
  i hope so  he s working for us 
  doing what 
  there s been threats to the reservoirs 
  any particular reason 
  rationing  the farmers are desperate 
  but the city needs drinking water 
  well  you re in luck 
when he was sheriff  the rum runners
landed tons of booze on the beach  
  and never lost a drop  he ought to be
able to hold on to your water for you 
j j  gittes to see mr mulwray 
please 
you wait 
  bad for glass 
  yeah  sure 
bad for the glass 
  mr gittes 
  actually  i came to see your husband 
  something to drink 
  what are you having 
  iced tea 
  that ll be fine  thank you 
my husband s at the office 
actually  he s not  and he s checked
out of his apartment at the el macondo 
that s not his apartment 
anyway  the point is 
i m not in business to be loved   
  but i am in business  whoever
set your husband up  set me up 
l a  is a small town  people talk 
i don t want to become a local joke 
you ve talked me into it 
i ll drop the lawsuit 
  what 
  let s just drop the whole thing 
  sugar  lemon  or both 
  both    i don t want to drop it 
i better talk to your husband 
why  hollis seems to think
you re an innocent man 
i ve been accused of a lot of things 
but never that 
someone s gone to a lot of trouble 
and i intend to find out 
i m not supposed to be the one
caught with his pants down 
unless it s a problem 
i d like to talk to your husband 
  may i speak frankly  mrs mulwray 
  you may if you can  mr gittes 
that little girlfriend  she was pretty 
in a cheap sort of way  of course   
she s disappeared 
maybe they disappeared together 
  if they did  how does that affect you 
  it s nothing personal 
it s very personal 
it couldn t be more personal 
  is this an obsession with you 
  let s look at it this way   
this phoney broad  excuse
the language  tells me she s you 
whoever put her up to it isn t after me 
they re out to get your husband 
if i can see him  i can help him 
  did you talk to him this morning 
  no 
i went riding rather early 
  it looks like you went quite a distance 
  i was riding bareback 
you might try the oak pass
or the stone canyon reservoir 
he often takes walks 
otherwise he ll be home by 6 30 
  i ll stop by 
  please call first 
sorry  closed to public 
that s all right  officer   
russ yelburton 
deputy chief of the department 
sorry  mr yelburton 
go on down 
  gittes  get out before he sees you 
  loach  what s going on 
  hello  jake 
  lou  how are you 
lousy cold i can t seem to shake 
but otherwise i m okay 
  summer colds are the worst 
  yeah  they are 
  there s no smoking here 
  we ll make an exception this time 
i ll see he s careful with the matches
and doesn t burn himself 
how d you get past the guard 
to tell you the truth  i lied a little 
  you look like you ve done well 
  i get by 
sometimes it takes a man a while
to find himself  maybe you have 
yeah  going through
other people s dirty linen 
tell me  you still putting chinamen
in jail for spitting in the laundry 
you re a little behind the times 
they use steam irons now 
and i m out of chinatown

congratulations 
  what are you doing around here 
  i m looking for somebody 
  hollis mulwray  you seen him 
  yeah 
  i d like to talk to him 
  you d like to talk to him   
you re welcome to try 
there he is 
it looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run off channel 
  could he swim 
  of course 
obviously  the fall must have
knocked him unconscious 
mrs mulwray  this alleged affair
your husband was having   
the publicity didn t make him
morose or unhappy 
it didn t make him happy 
  he couldn t have taken his own life 
  no 
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question 
  no 
  or where she might be 
you and your husband
never discussed her 
we did 
he wouldn t tell me her name 
we quarrelled over her  of course 
it came as a complete surprise to me 
a complete surprise  i thought
you hired a private investigator 
a private investigator 
mr gittes 
yes  but i did that to put an end to
a ridiculous rumour that had no basis 
when did mr gittes inform you that the
rumours had some foundation in fact 
just before the story broke
in the papers 
you wouldn t happen to know where
i could find her    or her name 
  no 
  of course not 
  will you need me for anything else 
  no  i don t think so 
if we need any more information
we ll be in touch 
of course you have
my deepest sympathy 
i ll see her to the car  lou 
i ll be right back 
  jake  what s the story

hello  claude

no  wanna guess 
no  okay 
they lose their noses 
next time you lose the whole thing 
i ll cut it off
and feed it to my goldfish  understand

so a contractor wants to build a dam
and makes a few pay offs  so what 
you can t nail mulvihill 
they ll claim you were trespassing 
i don t want mulvihill  i want the
big boys that are making the pay offs 
  then what ll you do 
  sue the shit out of them 
  what is it  sophie 
  a miss sessions is calling

people like that will be having dinner
with the judge who s trying the suit 
i m sorry  miss sessions insists 
  she says you know her 
  okay 
hello  miss sessions 
i don t believe we ve had the pleasure 
  oh yes we have  are you alone 
  isn t everyone 
what can i do for you 
well  i m a working girl  i didn t
come in to see you on my own 
  when did you come in 
  i pretended to be mrs mulwray 
shut the fuck up   
yes  i remember 
  is something wrong 
  i was just checking with an associate 
  go on 
  i never expected all this to happen 
if it gets out  i want someone to know
that i didn t know what would happen 
i understand  who was your employer 
it would be helpful to both of us 
oh  no  no 
what s your address 
maybe we could talk this over 
just look in the obituary column
of today s l a  post record 
you ll find one of those people 
sure   
how do you like them apples 
thank you for coming 
  yes  sir 
  drink 
tom collins with lime  not lemon 
i got your check in the mail 
  as i said  i was very grateful 
  i m afraid that s not good enough 
  how much would you like 
  oh  stop it  the money s fine 
but i think you short changed me
on the story 
something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you 
  you were upset  but not that upset 
  don t tell me how i feel 
sorry 
you sue me  your husband dies 
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato 
all of it quicker than the wind
from a duck s ass  excuse me   
  then you ask me to lie to the police 
  it wasn t much of a lie 
if he was killed  it was  this could look
like a pay off to withhold evidence 
but he wasn t killed 
mrs mulwray 
i think you re hiding something 
i suppose i am 
actually  i knew about the affair 
  how did you find out 
  my husband 
he told you  and you weren t
in the least bit upset 
i was grateful 
  you ll have to explain that 
  why 
when a wife tells me she s happy
that her husband is cheating on her   
  it runs contrary to my experience 
  unless what 
  she was cheating on him 
were you 
i dislike the word  cheat  
did you have affairs 
did he know about it 
i wouldn t run home and tell him
whenever i d been to bed with another 
  anything else you want to know 
  where were you when hollis died 
  i can t tell you 
  you don t know 
  i can t tell you 
  you were seeing someone too 
  for very long 
  i don t see anyone for very long 
it s difficult for me 
now  i think you know
all you need know about me 
i didn t want publicity  i didn t want to
go into all of this then  or now 
is that all 
oh  by the way   
what does this  c  stand for 
cross 
  that s your maiden name 
  yes  why 
no reason 
  you must have had a reason to ask 
  no  i m just a snoop 
no  i have my own car  the packard 
wait a minute  sonny 
i think you better come with me 
there s nothing more to say 
get my car  please 
okay  but in case you re interested 
your husband was murdered 
someone s been dumping thousands
of tons of water from the reservoirs   
  and we re supposedly in a drought 
he found out about it and he was killed 
there s a drowned drunk  involuntary
manslaughter  if anyone took the time 
it seems like half the city is trying
to cover it up  which is fine by me   
  but i goddam near lost my nose 
and i like it 
i like breathing through it 
and i still think
that you re hiding something 
mr gittes   
j j  gittes to see mr yelburton 
mr yelburton will be busy
for some time 
well  it s my lunch hour  i can wait 
he s liable to be tied up indefinitely 
i take a long lunch hour 
all day  sometimes 
  noah cross worked for the company 
  yes    no 
  did he or didn t he 
  he owned it 
  he owned the water department 
  yes 
you mean  he owned
the entire water supply for the city 
  how d they get it away from him 
  mulwray felt the public should own it 
mr mulwray 
i thought you said cross owned it 
along with mr mulwray 
  they were partners 
  yes  they were partners 
mr yelburton will see you now 
mr gittes  sorry to keep you waiting 
these staff meetings just go on and on 
it must be especially tough to take over
under these circumstances 
yes  hollis was the best
department chief the city ever had 
  what happened to your nose 
  cut myself shaving 
  that must really smart 
  only when i breathe 
only when you breathe    don t tell me
you re still working for mrs mulwray 
  i never was 
  i don t understand 
neither do i  actually 
you hired me 
or you hired that chippie to hire me 
  you re not making a bit of sense 
  let s look at it this way 
mulwray didn t want to build a dam 
his reputation was hard to get around 
you decided to ruin it  then he found
out you were dumping water at night 
then he was    drowned 
that s an outrageous accusation 
i don t know what you re talking about 
well  whitey mehrholtz
over at the times will 
dumping thousands of gallons of water
in the middle of a drought is news 
mr gittes   
we re not anxious for it to get around 
but we have been diverting water  
  to irrigate orange groves
in the northwest valley 
they have no legal right to our water 
but we ve been trying to help them out 
when you divert water 
there s a little run off 
yeah  a little run off   
where did you say those groves were 
  in the northwest valley 
  that s like saying they re in arizona 
my field men are out 
i can t give you the exact location 
you re a married man  aren t you 
hard working  wife  kids    
  yes 
  i don t want to nail you 
i want to find out who put you up to it 
i ll give you a few days to think on it 
call me  i can help  who knows 
maybe we can put the whole thing off  
  on a few big shots  and you can stay
head of the department for 20 years 
  drink 
  no  thank you 
what is your usual salary 
 35 a day  plus 20 for my associates 
plus expenses 
plus a bonus if i show results 
whoever killed my husband 
why have they gone to all this trouble 
money  how they plan to make it
emptying reservoirs  i don t know 
i ll pay your salary  plus  5 000   
  if you find out what happened
to hollis  and who is involved 
sophie  draw up one of our
standard contracts for mrs mulwray 
were you married before mulwray and
your father sold the water department 
noah cross is your father  isn t he 
yes  of course 
it was sometime after  i was just out
of grade school when they did that 
then you married
your father s business partner 
you ve already got one going 
does my talking about your father
upset you 
no   
yes  a little 
you see  hollis and my fa   
   my father
had a falling out  finally 
  over you or the water department 
  why should it be over me 
then it was over the water department 
hollis felt the water should belong to
the public  i think my father disagreed 
actually  it was over the
van der lip dam  the dam that broke 
  hollis never forgave him for it 
  never forgave him for what 
for talking him into building it 
they never spoke from that time on 
you sure about that 
of course i m sure 
sign here 
the copy s for you 
mr gittes 
how do you do 
  you got a nasty reputation  i like that 
  thanks 
you re not a bank president  in your
business it s good advertising 
  it doesn t hurt 
  it helps get a client like my daughter 
  probably 
  i m surprised you still work for her 
unless she s suddenly come up
with another husband 
she happens to think
the last one was murdered 
  how did she get that idea 
  i think i gave it to her 
i hope you don t mind  i believe
they should be served with the head 
as long as you don t
serve the chicken that way 
tell me  what do the police say 
they re calling it an accident 
  who s the investigating officer 
  lt  lou escobar 
  you know him
