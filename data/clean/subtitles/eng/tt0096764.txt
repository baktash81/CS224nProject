casting long shadows
through the sausage bushes
illuminating the tops
of the honey trees
and warming the fields
of smoked salmon
i baron munchausen
who am world renowned
for telling the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth
tighter
hold steady
how can you become a great
actress if you get blown to pieces
in my native land
there to attempt the education
of my provincial narrowminded
and incredulous countrymen
we heaved anchor and set sail
we heaved anchor and set sail
waves the waves
oh bugger
we are actors
where the devil are the stagehands
dead
all of them
suicide
nothing to do with your acting
ill luck pursued me i was blown
towards the jaws of a whale
of such prodigious size
and length
that even with my telescope
i could not see the end of him
what will become of the baron
surely this time there is no escape
at a time like this a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious
hells bells and buckets of blood
where were the waves
the waves
you incompetent imbecile
it wasnt me it was her
it wasnt me it was him
we are supposed to be professionals
and were trying to stay alive
sally
stay in here
wheres my brother
you havent got a brother
then you just tell me
why it says henry salt  son
i shouldnt have taught you to read
its traditional thats how it is
no the sultans demands
are still not sufficiently rational
the only lasting peace
is one based on reason
im sorry mr jackson
the first act didnt go so well
one or two technical problems
dont apologise mr salt
these are very trying circumstances
excuse me
the officer who risked his life
by destroying
six enemy cannon and rescuing
ten men held captive by the turk
weve heard so much about you
i suppose so sir
always taking excessive risks
i only did my best sir
have him executed at once
yes sir
such behaviour is demoralizing
for ordinary soldiers
theyre trying to lead
simple unexceptional lives
things are difficult enough without
emotional people rocking the boat
constantinople
the court of the grand turk
what a surprise
that a passing zephyr
should waft me here
perhaps i should teach
the sultan a lesson or two
his highness the sultan
loved a good wine
and could never resist a wager
characteristics that cost him dear
lies lies you scoundrels
i wont put up with this
stop this travesty
its an insult ive never seen
so much rubbish in all my life
you dont know what youre saying
after a sumptuous dinner
is this supposed to happen
please leave the stage
this blackguards an impostor
i am the baron munchausen
we are presenting a performance
youre presenting a mockery
you present me as if i were
a ridiculous fiction a joke
what the devils going on
curtain
get off
youre ruining the show
do something
i must talk with my audience
ladies and gentlemen
i must apologise for this dreadful
occurrence i can assure you
hello
hello
beautiful ladies
hello
beautiful ladies
you have great taste sir
otherwise its all quite wrong
listen weve got a show to do
good lord berthold
whos berthold
how on earth
its marvellous to see you
how are your legs
where are the others albrecht
adolphus gustavus i cant
believe it this is miraculous
im bill
is he still here get rid of him
what is the matter
well start the second act afresh
who is this
some old lunatic
he is baron munchausen
the real baron munchausen
yes indeed
who sir may i ask are you
a public servant i am responsible
for the licensing of this theatre
this is the right ordinary
horatio jackson
he happens to be winning the war
and saving the city
please leave us
hes an ass
only i can end this war
i can end it because i began it
i am the cause
im afraid sir you have
rather a weak grasp of reality
your reality sir
is lies and balderdash
i am delighted to say
i have no grasp of it whatsoever
this man needs a doctor
a doctor
we will continue with the show
thank you your ordinariness
right off
please be reasonable
if we dont get on with it
he will throw us to the turks
my lords ladies and gentlemen
baron munchausen at your service
found any noses recently
give us a song
most of you wont remember me
or my adventures
but i assure you they are true
the truth is
i am the cause of this siege
what about the turks then
this is a border dispute
were fighting for sea routes
that was last time
you poor deluded fools
if youll do me the courtesy of
accepting the word of a gentleman
i will reveal
the true cause of this war
after my oh dear
after my return from egypt
i was most warmly welcomed
by the grand turk
his highness the sultan
he knew of my reputation
and held me in high esteem
he was so delighted
with my company
that he offered me access
to his harem
one day he brought me a bottle
of his favourite tokay
what do you think of that
not bad
my dear munchausen
its impossible to find better
humbug
i can procure for you within the
hour a tokay far superior to this
from the imperial cellar in
vienna a mere 1000 miles away
accept my challenge if i dont
succeed you may cut off my head
what are your stakes
i accept
i wager as much treasure
as the strongest man can carry
agreed give me pen and ink
and ill write to the empress
berthold
coming
blast sorry chaps ive got to go
take this to vienna
to the empress
she will give you a bottle of wine
bring it straight to me
would you care for a little light
entertainment while you wait
i composed a short opera would you
like to hear it youll love it
its a comedy its called
the torturers apprentice
heres the overture
the curtain
the curtain rises
on a typical torture chamber
yosrick the young apprentice
sings of his joy in his job
a torturers apprentice went
his merry way to work one day
i bend and stretch
and ply my trade
making people all afraid
but business is slack
theres no one on the rack but me
act four is set in an abattoir
i see a lot of slapstick
we begin with the eunuchs chorus
cut off in my prime
mçein herz mein herz
cut off in my prime
surrounded by beautiful women
a eunuchs life is hard
excuse me a moment
you wont want to miss this aria
life is rather like a game
its important that you win
dont know
if hes not here in 3½ minutes
the sultan will cut off my head
is that all
sorry i dont find that funny
do you
this isnt a joke its a wager
a wager
hes asleep i can hear him snoring
about 900 miles away
hes under a tree near belgrade
theres a bottle beside him
i hope he hasnt been at it
whats the wind speed gus
three knots
im a modern man
these days i find
you have to be awfully cruel
to be kind
lm a modern man
you will agree
its either you or me
times nearly up i think

and oceans of wine

the soldiers saw him too
theyll tell you

and i didnt precisely fly
i merely held onto a mortar shell
in the first instance
and then a cannon ball
on the way back
you maniac youve done for us

that is what i had in mind
where are we going
to the moon
what thatll take ages
no it wont
of course it will
why are we going there
thats where i last saw berthold
have you ever been to the moon
no
interesting place
the king and queen are charming
you know about
their detachable heads dont you
their heads engage in intellectual
pursuits away from the body
the trouble is heads and bodies
dont always see eye to eye
you do believe me dont you
im doing my best
are you scared
certainly not
are you
certainly not
grab the rope
were here
you look different younger
i always feel rejuvenated
by a touch of adventure
dont you get any younger
or well have to find a wet nurse
youll find that im one of
the kings special favourites
we shall receive a royal welcome
now what
ive got you at last
bienvenuto alla luna
your majesty
what a great pleasure
to see you again
may i introduce my friend sally
sally king of the moon
my full title is king of everything
re di tutto you can call me ray
the moon is an insignificant part
of my domain theres much more
you seem to be in some discomfort
what ails you
nothing ails me can you not see
that i am at one with the cosmos
is that all you can say
what are you blind
let me explain it
since you were last here my head
where the brilliant parts
are located
is now ruling the known universe
and what i dont know i create
i just created spring seriously
without me there would be nothing
cogito ergo es
i think therefore you is
hes a lunatic
so it seems hes certainly fallen
prey to delusions of grandeur
keeping in tune
with the whole universe
requires much concentration
so having you on the loose
does not help
your stories distract me
you are like a mosquito
in the taj mahal
my liege without my adventures
you wouldnt be here
well so i am now
part of your adventures
we shall see about that
now who created who
i hope youll be comfortable ciao
theres my revolting body
with the queen
stop it im tired
go away
damn it he cant hear me
you stinking horrible man
its so embarrassing
dont look maybe hell go away
imagine we were once attached
were totally incompatible
hes dangling from the food chain
and i am in the stars

youre the little guy that tried
to make off with my queen

to concentrate on higher things
crawl back in the slime
missed me
im blind
my kingdom for a handkerchief
no let me go i havent time
for flatulence and orgasms
please no more bodily functions
farewell baron
one of the kings favourites
this cage isnt real
its part of the kings lunacy

and left me to rot in a cage
now you come back and expect me to
follow you to the ends of the earth
yes

well never rescue them now
2 ½ percent
thats not enough
thats all im offering
2 ½ percent
take it or leave it
we want more
we want more
im still in one piece
i think
i cant imagine why
our descent into
the volcano of mt etna
should have been slowed
by a rising cushion of warm air
the damn thing
seems to have gone out
oh no not more giants
can i help you tiny mortals
i sincerely hope so
im baron munchausen
you may have heard of me
were looking for three men
one with exceptional eyesight
one with superb hearing
and one whos
extremely large and strong
oh were all
extremely large and strong here
i am vulcan the god
and these are my giant employees
the cyclops who even now
are going back to work
i supply arms and equipment
to anyone who will pay the price
greeks trojans romans huns
its not my fault theyre crazy
enough to slaughter each other
you manky crew your goslows
dont impress me im god
i have all the time in the universe
hear that all the time me
in the old days the staff got paid
every 1000 years
this lot expects it every century
its outrageous
whats this
this is our prototype
rx intercontinental
radarsneaky
multiwarheaded nuclear missile
what does it do
it kills the enemy
all the enemy
all of them all their wives
children sheep cats and dogs
all of them gone for good
thats horrible
well you see
the advantage is you dont have to
see one single one of them die
you just sit comfortably thousands
of miles from the battlefield
and simply press the button
wheres the fun in that
we cater for all sorts here
youd be surprised
would you care for
a little fodder perhaps
delicious
its not bad tea
as far as nectar of the gods goes
you can stay as long as you like
its nice to have company for tea
im sorry but we have to go soon
were in a hurry

no thanks its okay
did you enjoy that
did i excite you
oh damn i cant swim
whats happening
youve got old again
well ive just been expelled
from bliss and its your fault
where are we

the most probable explanation
is that we dropped through the
worlds centre to the south seas
thats miles away
oh well done
i was happy in my volcano
so was i
an island
is there a volcano on it
shut up about your volcanoes
i think there is a volcano on it
its moving
i spy something starting with m
its a demon of the deep
that starts with d you klutz
mfor monster
will it eat us
with any luck
baron
quick give me a hand
he looks dead to me
he cant be dead
he doesnt look very perky
does he
is there a doctor in the fish
no doctors no doctors
weve got to get him warm and dry
whats that noise
its music
thats not music
look
theres a light come on
this way careful
excuse me
we need some help
we need some help
no doctors

eh
do i hear the baron
no doctors
do i hear the baron
i just said that
use your trumpet
adolphus gustavus
is it really you
baron berthold albrecht
i dont believe it
this is adolphus he could hit a
bullseye halfway round the world
this is gustavus who could
blow over a forest with one breath
those were the days eh
when we were young and alive
how do you mean
its no good fighting it
were not dead
you have to accept it
were all dead here
this is hell
heaven
hell
dont be stupid
sit down relax
have a game
youre dead for a very long time
what are you doing
youre giving up arent you
you cant i wont let you
go away clear off
what about rose and daisy
and my father and all the others
you promised to help them
they are perfectly safe
they can look after themselves
besides
there are more important things
such as
you horrible little brat
cant you let me die in peace
once in a while
bucephalos my bucephalos
you must have heard me shouting
this is a good omen what
oh yeah
prepare a rowing boat
be ready to leave
i have learned that a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious
ill never eat fish again
wheres the baron
baron
baron where are you
its the baron
well come on
i cant keep this up forever
look the town
were here
yes and the flags still flying
i told you not to worry
my god its the sultans army
quick back in the fish
theyre inviting us to defeat them
we must oblige them
on the count of three
gustavus
blow them back to asia minor
adolphus
find the sultan and shoot him
albrecht row us ashore
berthold make yourself useful
you couldnt make that four
were going down
abandon ship
abandon ship
i think the ships abandoning us
i still cant swim
this is absolutely dreadful
ive never been in such a rout
im usually on the winning side
youre too competitive
albrechts useless
we might as well give up
you mustnt say that not you
if we attack from two directions we
confound surprise with confusion
albrecht and gustavus will provide
the major themes while
baron
dont interrupt what is it
this isnt going to work
theyre old and tired now
it isnt like it used to be
dont you see
where are you going
to give myself up
i gave my word i would raise the
siege and gathered you all here
if you want to see baron munchausen
again do something about it
you cant give yourself up
they might kill you
and then we spent all that time
in that smelly fish for nothing
agreed friday 28th you surrender
thats three weeks from tomorrow
we can fix the details later
no you surrender
weve discussed it you surrender
but were winning
we surrendered last time
now its your turn
what about the virgins
forget them were out of virgins
let us concentrate on
reaching a civilised agreement
that can secure a world fit for
science progress
but not baron munchausen
you old lunatic
im afraid so
help murder
who let this man into my tent
if you are still interested
in my head its yours
im tired of it
send for the executioner
so mr jackson
still the rational man
how many people have perished
in your logical little war
there are rules in life we cannot
fly to the moon or defy death
we must face facts not folly
you dont live in the real world
and so you come
to a very sticky end
have you any famous last words
not yet
not yet is that famous
the mans a buffoon
executioner
execute
he did it
general stop that man
i knew we could do it
all together now
well blown gustavus
theyre coming
come on go on hurry
berthold run
make yourself useful
i cant do everything
this way
thats the way
gently this time
gently
we did it we did it
look they dont believe it
weve won weve won
come back
weve won
but of course
put me down
hes in the church tower
there he is shoot him
bring a doctor quickly
dont leave me baron please
get off him give him some air
here is the doctor
take care of sally
no doctors
no doctors
get away leave him alone
sallys having a fit
stop it
hes dead
that was only one of the
many times i met my death
an experience which i dont hesitate
strongly to recommend
and so with the help of my
inestimable servants
i defeated the turks
and saved the day
and from that time forth
everyone who had a talent for it
lived happily ever after
stop this nonsense at once
you are under arrest
for spreading ridiculous tales
at a time of danger
with the enemy at the gate
arrest him
open the gates
i order you
to arrest that man at once
am i not the elected representative
arrest him
open the gates
this way
come on
do not open the gates
the turk is outside
we will not surrender
open the gates
come on dear ladies
forward the players
do not open the gates
keep up steady as you go
come back im warning you
do not open those gates
follow me
the gates will remain closed
open the gates
shoot anyone
who disobeys my orders
hold your ground hold your ground
open the gates dear friends
and lets seize the day
nothing destroys a man as ignorance
and conformity grasp the mantle
no no no quite wrong
open the gates
shoot them
shoot these people at once
so its treason is it
right youre all under arrest
all of you
