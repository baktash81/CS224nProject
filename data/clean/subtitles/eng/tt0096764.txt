  casting long shadows
through the sausage bushes   
  illuminating the tops
of the honey trees  
  and warming the fields
of smoked salmon   
  i baron munchausen 
who am world renowned  
  for telling the truth  the whole
truth and nothing but the truth   
  tighter 
  hold steady 
how can you become a great
actress if you get blown to pieces 
   in my native land   
   there to attempt the education  
  of my provincial  narrow minded 
and incredulous countrymen 
we heaved anchor and set sail 
we heaved anchor and set sail 
waves  the waves 
oh bugger 
we are actors 
where the devil are the stagehands 
  dead 
  all of them 
suicide 
nothing to do with your acting 
ill luck pursued me  i was blown
towards the jaws of a whale  
  of such prodigious size
and length  
  that even with my telescope
i could not see the end of him 
what will become of the baron 
surely this time there is no escape 
at a time like this  a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious 
hell s bells and buckets of blood 
where were the waves 
the waves 
you incompetent imbecile 
  it wasn t me  it was her 
  it wasn t me  it was him 
we are supposed to be professionals
and we re trying to stay alive 
sally 
stay in here 
  where s my brother 
  you haven t got a brother 
then you just tell me
why it says  henry salt   son  
i shouldn t have taught you to read 
it s traditional  that s how it is 
no  the sultan s demands
are still not sufficiently rational 
the only lasting peace
is one based on reason 
i m sorry  mr  jackson 
the first act didn t go so well 
one or two technical problems 
don t apologise  mr  salt 
these are very trying circumstances 
excuse me 
the officer who risked his life
by destroying   
   six enemy cannon and rescuing
ten men held captive by the turk 
  we ve heard so much about you 
  i suppose so  sir 
  always taking excessive risks 
  i only did my best  sir 
  have him executed at once 
  yes  sir 
such behaviour is demoralizing
for ordinary soldiers 
they re trying to lead
simple  unexceptional lives 
things are difficult enough without
emotional people rocking the boat 
constantinople 
the court of the grand turk 
what a surprise  
  that a passing zephyr
should waft me here 
perhaps i should teach
the sultan a lesson or two 
his highness the sultan
loved a good wine  
  and could never resist a wager 
characteristics that cost him dear 
lies  lies  you scoundrels 
i won t put up with this 
stop this travesty 
it s an insult  i ve never seen
so much rubbish in all my life 
you don t know what you re saying 
  after a sumptuous dinner   
  is this supposed to happen 
please leave the stage 
this blackguard s an impostor 
i am the baron munchausen 
  we are presenting a performance 
  you re presenting a mockery 
you present me as if i were
a ridiculous fiction  a joke 
what the devil s going on 
curtain 
get off 
you re ruining the show 
do something 
i must talk with my audience 
ladies and gentlemen   
i must apologise for this dreadful
occurrence  i can assure you   
  hello 
  hello 
beautiful ladies 
  hello 
  beautiful ladies 
  you have great taste  sir 
  otherwise  it s all quite wrong 
  listen  we ve got a show to do   
  good lord  berthold 
who s berthold 
how on earth    
it s marvellous to see you 
how are your legs 
where are the others  albrecht 
adolphus  gustavus  i can t
believe it  this is miraculous 
  i m bill 
  is he still here  get rid of him 
  what is the matter 
  we ll start the second act afresh 
  who is this 
  some old lunatic 
  he is baron munchausen 
  the real baron munchausen 
yes  indeed 
who  sir  may i ask  are you 
a public servant  i am responsible
for the licensing of this theatre 
this is the right ordinary
horatio jackson 
he happens to be winning the war
and saving the city 
please leave us 
he s an ass 
only i can end this war 
i can end it because i began it 
i am the cause 
i m afraid  sir  you have
rather a weak grasp of reality 
your reality  sir 
is lies and balderdash 
i am delighted to say
i have no grasp of it whatsoever 
  this man needs a doctor 
  a doctor 
we will continue with the show 
thank you  your ordinariness 
right  off 
please  be reasonable 
if we don t get on with it 
he will throw us to the turks 
my lords  ladies and gentlemen 
baron munchausen at your service 
found any noses recently 
give us a song 
most of you won t remember me
or my adventures 
but i assure you  they are true 
the truth is 
i am the cause of this siege 
  what about the turks then 
  this is a border dispute 
  we re fighting for sea routes 
  that was last time 
you poor  deluded fools 
if you ll do me the courtesy of
accepting the word of a gentleman   
  i will reveal
the true cause of this war 
after my    oh  dear   
after my return from egypt  
  i was most warmly welcomed
by the grand turk 
his highness the sultan 
he knew of my reputation
and held me in high esteem 
he was so delighted
with my company  
  that he offered me access
to his harem 
one day  he brought me a bottle
of his favourite tokay 
  what do you think of that 
  not bad 
my dear munchausen 
it s impossible to find better 
humbug 
i can procure for you  within the
hour  a tokay far superior to this  
  from the imperial cellar in
vienna  a mere 1 000 miles away 
accept my challenge  if i don t
succeed  you may cut off my head 
  what are your stakes 
  i accept 
i wager as much treasure
as the strongest man can carry 
agreed  give me pen and ink
and i ll write to the empress 
berthold 
coming 
blast  sorry chaps  i ve got to go 
take this to vienna 
to the empress 
she will give you a bottle of wine 
bring it straight to me 
would you care for a little light
entertainment while you wait 
i composed a short opera  would you
like to hear it  you ll love it 
it s a comedy  it s called
 the torturer s apprentice  
here s the overture 
the curtain   
the curtain rises
on a typical torture chamber 
yosrick  the young apprentice 
sings of his joy in his job 
a torturer s apprentice went
his merry way to work one day
i bend and stretch
and ply my trade
making people all afraid
but business is slack
there s no one on the rack but me 
act four is set in an abattoir   
i see a lot of slapstick 
we begin with the eunuch s chorus 
cut off in my prime 
mçein herz  mein herz 
cut off in my prime
surrounded by beautiful women
a eunuch s life is hard   
  excuse me a moment 
  you won t want to miss this aria 
life is rather like a game
it s important that you win   
don t know 
if he s not here in 3½ minutes 
the sultan will cut off my head 
is that all 
sorry  i don t find that funny 
do you 
  this isn t a joke  it s a wager 
  a wager 
he s asleep  i can hear him snoring 
about 900 miles away 
he s under a tree  near belgrade 
  there s a bottle beside him 
  i hope he hasn t been at it 
  what s the wind speed  gus 
  three knots 
i m a modern man
these days i find
you have to be awfully cruel
to be kind
l m a modern man
you will agree   
    it s either you or me 
time s nearly up  i think 
ready   
now 
  not late  am i 
  no  not late  thank you very much 
thanks  i needed a trim 
  much obliged 
  from the empress 
delicious  you win 
treasurer  take from the treasury as
much as the strongest man can carry 
yep  that s it 
thanks  squire 
  what is it 
  they ve taken everything 
  gustavus 
  stop them 
  bring them back 
  gustavus  again 
fire 
take cover  my friends 
regroup 
and so  as you can see 
the sultan is still after my head 
wait  stop  don t go 
come back  there s more 
i haven t finished  don t leave now 
gustavus  adolphus  albrecht 
we re about to make off
with the sultan s treasure 
  berthold 
  the name s desmond 
we re actors  not figments
of your imagination  get a grip 
come back 
come back 
what is the sultan playing at 
it s wednesday  isn t it 
i m terribly sorry
about the show   
this theatre is closed  you and
your company must leave the city 
but look at these endorsements 
 mr  salt s company holds a mirror
up to nature   vienna clarion 
 great value   paris echo 
 a good night out   glasgow herald 
good boy    it s all right 
here boy 
are you all right 
  am i dead 
  no 
  blast 
  who are you really 
baron munchausen isn t real 
he s only in stories 
  go away  i m trying to die 
  why 
because i m tired of the world 
  and the world is tired of me 
  but why  why 
why  why  why 
because it s all logic
and reason now 
science  progress 
laws of hydraulics 
laws of social dynamics 
laws of this  that and the other 
no place for a three legged cyclops
from the south seas 
no place for cucumber trees
and oceans of wine 
no place for me 
what happened in the story 
in the sultan s palace 
did you escape  were you killed 
i don t know 
it was all a long time ago 
  who cares 
  i do 
i m very tired   
  goodbye 
  please tell me 
  go on 
  buzz off 
  please 
  you really want to know 
stop it

then we ll never know
the end of the story

stop it 
wait  come back  take cover 
wretched child 
stop it 
get away  stop it 
head down 
  you ll get us both killed 
  i thought you wanted to die

  it s wednesday 
  wednesday 
the turks

you really are baron munchausen 
this is the end  it s all over 
generations of theatrical expertise
snuffed out 
sally 
get off 
sally  come here 
you cretinous  senile old fart 
thanks to you 
we re to be thrown to the turks 
but he is baron munchausen 
the real one 
  you must believe me 
  hurry 
honestly  he is 
  shut up 
  but he is    and he can save us 
can t you  he jumped onto
a cannon ball  he really did 
he flew miles into the sky above
the elephants and soldiers 
  stop lying 
  i m not lying  am i 
  as a matter of fact  you are 
  but he did 
the soldiers saw him  too 
they ll tell you 
oh  they re dead 
  but he did 
  no  i didn t 
  now you re lying 
  i never lie 
sally  stay here 
what s got into you 
i didn t fly miles 
it was more like a mile and a half 
and i didn t precisely fly 
i merely held onto a mortar shell
in the first instance  
  and then a cannon ball
on the way back 
you maniac  you ve done for us 
it doesn t matter now  the turks
are about to take the town 
i was just coming into my prime 
between romeo and king lear 
my public will kill me
for dying at a time like this 
save us 
don t disappoint me 
  you are a baron  aren t you 
  you re our only hope 
  you are my only hope 
  ladies  please   
as long as i   
  heronomous carl frederick
baron von munchausen   
  live and breathe 
you shall come to no harm 
you so remind me
of catherine the great   
  whose hand in marriage
i once declined 
they all remind you

bits here and bits there 
i have a plan 
i will set forth immediately   
   and find my
extraordinary servants 
with their help  i ll raise
the siege and save the town 
  brilliant  very good  bravo 
  how 
  i shall require your assistance 
  of course 
  just tell us what to do 
  kindly remove your knickers 
look at all that underwear 
isn t it beautiful 
it s like a dream come true 
it s the dawning of the age
of lovely  intimate things 
he ll kill himself 
  yeah  but it d be well worth it 
  enough nattering  keep pumping 
  better report this 
  you re right 
no    we need a very simple plan 
these are far too complicated 
the actors have an air balloon 
they re trying to escape 
arrest them at once 
  throw them out of the town 
  we can t open the gates  sir 
  throw them over the walls then 
  yes  sir 
escaping  really  what would
future generations think of us

blast 
hang on 
  thanks 
  now you ve ruined everything 
i ll have to douse the fires
and let you down 
  i m going with you 
  i absolutely and utterly refuse 
if we go down now 
we ll land on the church 
  we ve got to find your servants 
  that is what i had in mind 
  where are we going 
  to the moon 
what  that ll take ages 
  no  it won t 
  of course it will 
  why are we going there 
  that s where i last saw berthold 
  have you ever been to the moon 
  no 
interesting place 
the king and queen are charming 
you know about
their detachable heads  don t you 
their heads engage in intellectual
pursuits away from the body 
the trouble is  heads and bodies
don t always see eye to eye 
  you do believe me  don t you 
  i m doing my best 
are you scared 
certainly not 
  are you 
  certainly not 
grab the rope 
we re here 
you look different  younger 
i always feel rejuvenated
by a touch of adventure 
don t you get any younger 
or we ll have to find a wet nurse 
you ll find that i m one of
the king s special favourites 
we shall receive a royal welcome 
now what 
i ve got you  at last 
  bienvenuto alla luna 
  your majesty 
what a great pleasure
to see you again 
may i introduce my friend sally 
sally  king of the moon 
my full title is king of everything 
re di tutto  you can call me ray 
the moon is an insignificant part
of my domain  there s much more 
you seem to be in some discomfort 
what ails you 
nothing ails me  can you not see
that i am at one with the cosmos 
is that all you can say 
what are you  blind 
let me explain it 
since you were last here  my head   
  where the brilliant parts
are located   
  is now ruling the known universe 
and what i don t know  i create 
i just created spring  seriously 
without me there would be nothing 
 cogito ergo es  
i think  therefore you is 
he s a lunatic 
so it seems  he s certainly fallen
prey to delusions of grandeur 
keeping in tune
with the whole universe  
  requires much concentration 
so having you on the loose
does not help 
your stories distract me 
you are like a mosquito
in the taj mahal 
my liege  without my adventures 
you wouldn t be here 
well  so i am now
part of your adventures 
we shall see about that 
now  who created who 
i hope you ll be comfortable  ciao 
there s my revolting body
with the queen 
stop it  i m tired 
go away 
damn it  he can t hear me 
you stinking  horrible man 
it s so embarrassing 
don t look  maybe he ll go away 
imagine we were once attached 
we re totally incompatible 
he s dangling from the food chain
and i am in the stars 
no  go away 
i despise you 
i m back 
i got lips again 
and i m gonna use them  baby 
it s me  i m your elephant of joy 
  let me kiss you  baby 
  eat first  darling 
that s right 
first eat then kiss 
i need this stuff 
you can t do that
when you don t got no mouth 
i m back in business 
you don t go nowhere 
  baron 
  your most wondrous majesty 
i know you 
you re the little guy that tried
to make off with my queen 
no more of that  piccolo casanova 
what are you looking at 
here you go  lovebirds 
i m sure you ll be uncomfortable 
free again 
to concentrate on higher things 
crawl back in the slime 
missed me 
i m blind 
my kingdom for a handkerchief 
no  let me go  i haven t time
for flatulence and orgasms 
please  no more bodily functions 
farewell  baron 
   one of the king s favourites  
  this cage isn t real 
  it s part of the king s lunacy 
  it seems solid enough to me 
i see we re in a
not very helpful frame of mind 
the town is perfectly all right 
  the assault is over  they re safe 
  how do you know 
i just know 
what the devil   
all right  i m coming 
come out of there 
  come out of there 
  ow  stop that 
  why did you do that 
  i thought you might be unfriendly 
of course i am  you d be unfriendly 
if i prodded you 
who are you 
  i can t remember 
  that ll be us  if we don t escape 
  why are you here 
  i m a very wicked criminal 
  what have you done 
  i can t remember 
  how do you know you re wicked 
  well  for one thing   
l m in here 
and for another   
l ve got these shackles on 
berthold 
it s berthold 
it s me  the baron 
i knew i d find you  you must come
back to earth and fight the sultan 
you re berthold  my old servant 
the leg irons are to slow you down 
  you re joking 
  you always wore them  remember 
  you re crackers 
  i m baron munchausen 
we re wasting time 
  darling baron 
  ariadne 
i m sorry
we couldn t speak before   
  but roger s so difficult 
where exactly is roger 
in bed with my body  of course 
stop it  stop it 
if he discovers
my head s with you   
quickly  climb into my hair 
why s she making
those funny noises 
her body s with the king 
and he s   
   tickling her feet 
  berthold  you re coming with us 
  no chance 
  why not  are you frightened 
  that s it 
come on  help me 
quickly  climb aboard 
  hold tight 
  i don t want to escape 
i love this 
i ll tickle you till dawn  darling 
i ll wipe everything away 
tickly  tickly   
i know you love this 
but you don t say anything 
you re a pillow biter  that s it 
baron  i must get back to roger
before he notices i m headless 
  i quite understand 
  darling  take me with you 
  back to earth 
  yes  oh yes 
without your body 
  i thought you loved me for myself 
  i did    i mean  i do 
  it s just   
  we have to go 
i think you re right 
it s impossible 
take a lock of my hair 
just a lock  cocky 
not the whole carpet 
  i shall treasure it always 
  the king  i must go   
au revoir  my dear baron 
yes  i m coming  roger 
i m going to drive you to china 
let it out

oh  you play a trick 
darling  come out 
you re not here  where are you 
you re with the baron 
you are with that little man 
you told me size

that s it  i ll find your baron 
and then i ll kill you 
faster 
i ll make a baron brochette 
sybil  andiamo 
faster 
we can t 
berthold can hardly move 
  take his weights off 
  i have 
  he s old  he can t run anymore 
  nonsense  he s out of practice 
come on  berthold 
look for him 
nowhere to hide for you  baron 
what are you looking at 
look down there 
there he is  sybil  down there 
i ve got you now  baron 
there they are 
are you hungry  my darling 
you take the baron 
you the bald one   
  and you take the little girl 
because you re my favourite  dinner 
  you go this way  i ll go that way 
  you re the last of your species 
no  don t split up on me now 
mayday 
we re going down 
sybil  don t desert me now 
i m free  i m free at last 
the body is dead 
the body s dead  long live the head 
it s finished  finito 
i shall prove a head does not need
a body to survive  i am omnipotent 
oh no  i ve got an itch 
well done  sally 
baron munchausen 
how great to see you 
  get off me 
  it s berthold  your old servant 
yes  we ve been through all that 
  where are we 
  on the moon 
  oh yeah  same old baron  eh 
  can we go now 
get weaving 
hang on   
it s all coming back 
i ve been stuck here for 20 years 
ever since you were last here 
you abandoned me here 
you swine 
you went off with the queen of tarts
and left me to rot in a cage 
now you come back and expect me to
follow you to the ends of the earth 
yes 
oh  all right 
berthold  do you know
where the rest of the gang are 
not a clue 
this is the sort of thing
that no one ever believes 
right  berthold   
you go first   
  then sally 
careful 
off you go 
that s it  finito 
there s no more rope 
  i m coming back up 
  wait a moment 
  tie this to the end 
  where did you get this 
  i cut it from the top 
  from the top 
where else do you think i d get it 
yes  yes  yes   
splice it to the end
so we may continue our descent 
very clever  great 
why didn t i think of that 
that s why he s a baron 
and i m a prole 
we ll never rescue them now 
2 ½ percent 
  that s not enough 
  that s all i m offering 
2 ½ percent 
take it or leave it 
we want more 
we want more 
i m still in one piece 
  i think   
  i can t imagine why 
our descent into
the volcano of mt  etna  
  should have been slowed
by a rising cushion of warm air 
the damn thing
seems to have gone out 
oh  no  not more giants 
can i help you tiny mortals 
i sincerely hope so 
i m baron munchausen 
you may have heard of me 
we re looking for three men 
one with exceptional eyesight 
one with superb hearing   
  and one who s
extremely large and strong 
oh  we re all
extremely large and strong here 
i am vulcan  the god 
and these are my giant employees 
the cyclops  who even now
are going back to work 
i supply arms and equipment
to anyone who will pay the price 
greeks  trojans  romans  huns   
it s not my fault they re crazy
enough to slaughter each other 
you manky crew  your go slows
don t impress me  i m god 
i have all the time in the universe 
hear that  all the time  me 
in the old days the staff got paid
every 1 000 years 
this lot expects it every century 
it s outrageous 
  what s this 
  this is our prototype   
rx intercontinental   
  radar sneaky 
multi warheaded  nuclear missile 
what does it do 
  it kills the enemy 
  all the enemy 
all of them  all their wives 
children  sheep  cats and dogs   
  all of them  gone for good 
  that s horrible 
well  you see   
the advantage is  you don t have to
see one single one of them die 
you just sit comfortably  thousands
of miles from the battlefield   
  and simply press the button 
where s the fun in that 
we cater for all sorts here 
you d be surprised   
would you care for
a little fodder  perhaps 
delicious 
it s not bad tea 
as far as nectar of the gods goes 
you can stay as long as you like 
it s nice to have company for tea 
i m sorry  but we have to go soon 
we re in a hurry

ungrateful mortal 
  you ll pay for this 
  i insist the lady is blameless 
please  put the baron down 
he s always like that 
  what have you done to them 
  you small minded petty bourgeois 
  what have you done to the baron 
  you want the baron 
  you can have the baron 
  no thanks  it s okay   
did you enjoy that 
did i excite you 
oh  damn  i can t swim 
what s happening 
you ve got old again 
well  i ve just been expelled
from bliss  and it s your fault 
where are we 
answer me 
the most probable explanation  
  is that we dropped through the
world s centre to the south seas 
  that s miles away 
  oh  well done 
  i was happy in my volcano 
  so was i 
an island 
  is there a volcano on it 
  shut up about your volcanoes 
i think there is a volcano on it 
it s moving 
  i spy something starting with  m  
  it s a demon of the deep 
that starts with  d   you klutz 
 m    for monster 
  will it eat us 
  with any luck 
baron 
quick  give me a hand 
  he looks dead to me 
  he can t be dead 
he doesn t look very perky 
does he 
is there a doctor in the fish 
no doctors    no doctors 
  we ve got to get him warm and dry 
  what s that noise 
it s    music 
that s not music 
look 
there s a light  come on 
this way    careful 
excuse me 
we need some help 
  we need some help 
  no doctors 
do i hear the baron 
eh 
do i hear the baron 
  no doctors 
  do i hear the baron 
i just said that 
use your trumpet 
adolphus  gustavus 
is it really you 
  baron  berthold  albrecht 
  i don t believe it 
this is adolphus  he could hit a
bull s eye halfway round the world 
this is gustavus  who could
blow over a forest with one breath 
those were the days  eh 
when we were young    and alive 
  how do you mean 
  it s no good fighting it 
  we re not dead 
  you have to accept it 
we re all dead here 
this is hell 
  heaven 
  hell 
don t be stupid 
sit down  relax 
have a game 
you re dead for a very long time 
what are you doing 
you re giving up  aren t you 
  you can t  i won t let you 
  go away  clear off 
what about rose and daisy 
and my father and all the others 
  you promised to help them 
  they are perfectly safe 
they can look after themselves 
besides 
there are more important things 
such as 
you horrible little brat 
can t you let me die in peace
once in a while 
bucephalos  my bucephalos 
you must have heard me shouting 
  this is a good omen  what 
  oh  yeah   
prepare a rowing boat 
be ready to leave 
i have learned that a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious 
i ll never eat fish again 
  where s the baron 
  baron 
baron  where are you 
it s the baron 
well  come on 
i can t keep this up forever 
look  the town 
we re here 
yes  and the flag s still flying 
i told you not to worry 
my god  it s the sultan s army 
quick  back in the fish 
they re inviting us to defeat them 
we must oblige them 
on the count of three   
gustavus 
blow them back to asia minor 
adolphus 
find the sultan and shoot him 
albrecht  row us ashore 
berthold    make yourself useful 
you couldn t make that four 
we re going down 
abandon ship 
abandon ship 
i think the ship s abandoning us 
i still can t swim 
this is absolutely dreadful 
i ve never been in such a rout 
i m usually on the winning side 
  you re too competitive 
  albrecht s useless 
  we might as well give up 
  you mustn t say that  not you 
if we attack from two directions  we
confound surprise with confusion 
albrecht and gustavus will provide
the major themes  while   
  baron 
  don t interrupt  what is it 
this isn t going to work 
they re old and tired now 
it isn t like it used to be 
don t you see 
  where are you going 
  to give myself up 
i gave my word i would raise the
siege and gathered you all here 
if you want to see baron munchausen
again  do something about it 
you can t give yourself up 
they might kill you 
and then we spent all that time
in that smelly fish for nothing 
agreed  friday 28th  you surrender 
that s three weeks from tomorrow 
  we can fix the details later 
  no  you surrender 
  we ve discussed it  you surrender 
  but we re winning 
we surrendered last time 
now it s your turn 
  what about the virgins 
  forget them  we re out of virgins 
let us concentrate on
reaching a civilised agreement  
  that can secure a world fit for
science  progress   
but not baron munchausen 
  you old lunatic 
  i m afraid so 
help  murder 
who let this man into my tent 
if you are still interested
in my head    it s yours 
  i m tired of it 
  send for the executioner 
so  mr  jackson 
still the rational man 
how many people have perished
in your logical little war 
there are rules in life  we cannot
fly to the moon or defy death 
we must face facts  not folly 
you don t live in the real world  
  and so  you come
to a very sticky end 
  have you any famous last words 
  not yet 
   not yet   is that famous 
  the man s a buffoon 
executioner 
execute 
he did it 
general  stop that man 
i knew we could do it 
all together now 
well blown  gustavus 
  they re coming 
  come on  go on  hurry 
berthold  run 
make yourself useful 
i can t do everything 
this way 
that s the way 
gently this time 
gently 
we did it  we did it 
look  they don t believe it 
we ve won  we ve won 
  come back 
  we ve won 
but of course 
put me down 
he s in the church tower 
there he is  shoot him 
bring a doctor  quickly 
  don t leave me  baron  please 
  get off him  give him some air 
here is the doctor 
  take care of sally 
  no doctors   
no doctors 
get away  leave him alone 
sally s having a fit 
stop it 
he s dead 
   that was only one of the
many times i met my death 
an experience which i don t hesitate
strongly to recommend 
and so  with the help of my
inestimable servants   
  i defeated the turks
and saved the day 
and from that time forth 
everyone who had a talent for it  
  lived happily ever after 
stop this nonsense at once 
you are under arrest  
  for spreading ridiculous tales
at a time of danger   
  with the enemy at the gate 
arrest him 
open the gates 
i order you
to arrest that man at once 
am i not the elected representative 
  arrest him 
  open the gates 
this way 
  come on 
  do not open the gates 
the turk is outside 
we will not surrender 
open the gates 
come on  dear ladies 
forward the players 
  do not open the gates 
  keep up  steady as you go 
come back  i m warning you 
do not open those gates 
follow me 
  the gates will remain closed 
  open the gates 
shoot anyone
who disobeys my orders 
hold your ground  hold your ground 
open the gates  dear friends 
and let s seize the day 
nothing destroys a man as ignorance
and conformity  grasp the mantle 
no  no  no  quite wrong 
open the gates 
shoot them 
shoot these people at once 
so  it s treason  is it 
right  you re all under arrest 
all of you
