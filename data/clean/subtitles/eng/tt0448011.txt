 whispering continues 
john  caleb  take a look at this 
caleb  there you go 
what is it 
saturn s rings await your approval 
has anyone found life on other planets 
not yet  guess it s just us for now 
caleb  okay 
then how many that might have life 
well  if you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy 
then you factor in the probability that
they have earth like planets orbiting them   
there are 10 million possible worlds
with four million mature enough
for life to evolve 
why do you even ask 
just making sure if you re listening 
  where you going 
  to watch that discovery program 
john  but it s dad s famous sunday night
hot dogs on the run   
   time 
i can t consume that 
i ve decided to become a vegetarian 
well  when were you planning on
telling the guy
who buys the groceries around here 
are you deaf  i just told you now  dad 
man on tv  the cubs are now
six months old and bounding with energy 
but  any parent knows 
this is also a mixed blessing 
  off 
  no  it s almost over 
you re not gonna be able to concentrate
in class tomorrow 
i don t have class tomorrow 
it s the 50th anniversary  remember 
i remember 
caleb 
when i said it was just us out there 
you know i was talking about space  right 
i didn t mean heaven  or anything 
  i m sure wherever mom is   
  dad  you don t even believe in heaven 
i never said that  caleb 
i just said we can t know for sure  that s all 
if you want to believe 
you go ahead and believe  okay 
okay  bedtime 
hey  you and me 
  together forever 
  forever 
i love you 
i love you  too 
 sighs 
 classical music playing 
we re going to pose a topic
to get you thinking along the right lines
for your term paper 
it s the subject of randomness
versus determinism in the universe 
who s jumping in  jessica 
determinism says
that occurrences in nature
are causally decided by preceding events
or natural laws 
that everything leading up to this point
has happened for a reason 
that s right  that s what determinism says 
spencer  tell me something about the sun 
it s hot 
 students laughing 
elaborate 
temperature s about 10 000 degrees
fahrenheit on the surface 
  27 million degrees at the core 
  good 
stacey 
 students laughing 
a word or two about the composition 
mostly hydrogen 
also helium with some carbon
and nitrogen thrown in there 
excellent  now  i want you to think
about the perfect set of circumstances
that put this celestial ball of fire
at just the correct distance
from our little blue planet for life to evolve 
making it possible for you
to be sitting here in this riveting lecture 
 students laughing 
but that s a nice thought  right 
everything has a purpose  an order to it 
is determined 
but then there s the other side
of the argument 
the theory of randomness 
which says it s all simply coincidence 
the very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex
yet inevitable string of chemical accidents
and biological mutations 
there is no grand meaning 
there s no purpose 
stacey  what about you 
professor koestler 
  what 
  well  what do you believe 
i think shit just happens 
but that s me  class dismissed 
now  that s some very heavy shit
for a monday morning  by the sounds of it 
since when does the cosmology
department audit my lectures 
since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte 
john  so what s on
your scientific mind today 
do you remember kim s little sister 
ph double d s  remember her 
is it ethical to say things like that
about your sister in law 
what  it s factual  it s peer reviewed 
i mean  it s like    anyway  whatever 
  she s in town this friday 
  okay 
and she thinks that you re intriguing 
which i thought was code for gay 
but apparently not because she s asked
if you would join us for dinner 
  yeah  i    i don t know  phil 
  come on  john 
come on  you owe me for last time
you skipped out on me 
  caleb was panicking 
  yeah  look  i know 
and the time before that 
he had a sore throat 
  oh  no 
  what 
  damn it  damn it 
  what 
caleb s ceremony  i m sorry  phil 
hey  hey  friday 
i ll think about it 
   singing  this little light of mine
  this little light of mine
  i m gonna let it shine
  i m gonna let it shine
  this little light of mine
  this little light of mine
  i m gonna let it shine
  i m gonna let it shine
  this little light of mine
  this little light of mine
  i m gonna let it shine
  i m gonna let it shine
  let it shine  let it shine  let it shine
  let it shine  let it shine  let it shine
fifty years ago  the students and faculty
of william dawes elementary
imagined what the future might hold 
today  we unveil their legacy 
now  i d like to introduce you
to someone very special 
miss priscilla taylor 
since miss taylor was there
for the original dedication 
it s only fitting that we have her
do the honors today 
children  wow 
caleb  you almost forgot again 
john  i made it in time to hear you sing 
you were the best one up there 
  you could not hear me 
  i could  i swear 
 children clamoring 
caleb  gotta go  they re starting 
teacher 1  all right  easy  easy

boy  miss taylor  miss taylor 
thank you 
teacher 2  everyone s gonna get one 
 feedback screeching 
 voices whispering 
 voice whispering 
  hello again  john 
  hello  how s it going 
 voices whispering 
 whispers growing louder 
hey  what d you get 
 scoffs  boring 
everyone else got a picture 
caleb  could you please watch
where you put this 
i don t want you to lose another one 
it s making funny noises 
try turning the volume down 
 soft squeal 
hey  dad  you know that kid  jason 
from soccer practice 
mmm hmm 
he s having a sleepover this weekend 
and he was wondering if i can come 
sounds like fun 
they have a boat 
jason s dad said he might take us out
on the lake 
i ll think about it 
  that means no 
  it means i ll think about it 
 sighs  what are you doing with this 
you weren t supposed to bring this home 
it belongs to the school 
but maybe it means something 
like a math puzzle or something like that 
yeah  that s good  i don t know 
but it s not ours to keep 
now  you return this as soon
as you get to school tomorrow  got it 
okay  let s go  bedtime 
 door opens 
 john sighs 
allison   singing 
o er thy spirit gently stealing
i my loving vigil keeping
all through the night
goodnight  baby 
goodnight  mom 
 john sighs 
man on tv  our tigress lives
in kanha national park 
in the forests of kipling s jungle book 
where dawn elephant patrols
ensure this is one of the safest places
for tigers to roam 
 drink splashes 
 sighs 
year after year   
 sighs 
damn it 
9l11l01 
 john reading 
two thousand  nine hundred
and ninety six 
come on 
what the hell is this 
man 1 
in the aftermath of hurricane katrina   
man 2  there could be
thousands of bodies here   
oh  my god 
caleb  dad 
dad  we re gonna be late 
 children chattering 
man  do you have your knapsack all set 
thanks for the ride  mr  koestler 
dad  are you sick 
i m fine 
don t you think you re acting
kind of awkward today 
am i awkward 
i just had a lot of work to do last night 
 school bell ringing 
okay 
  bye  dad 
  bye 
john  look at this 
  look at the numbers beside the date 
  phil  yeah  yeah  yeah 
john  two thousand  nine hundred
and ninety six 
phil  right 
that s how many people died
in the attacks that day 
  yeah 
  all right  stay with me 
i know how this sounds  but i ve matched
these numbers to the dates
of every major global disaster
for the last 50 years in perfect sequence 
except for three 
and these events haven t occurred yet 
starting with this one 
so tomorrow  somewhere on the planet 
this number string predicts
that 81 people are gonna die
in some kind of tragedy 
  whoa  i mean  have a listen to yourself 
  i know 
  it sounds pretty crazy 
  i know 
i mean  even for you 
  what s this 
  open it 
phil  oh 
why are you showing me this 
the day allison died in the fire 
it s on the list  too 
from a piece of paper that s been
buried in the ground for five decades 
  yeah 
  can you explain that  phil 
i was up all night going over this 
i went through that list again and again 
and i tried to fault it and i couldn t 
maybe someone s playing
a really shitty joke   
right  right  except i saw them dig it up 
i watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground
and hand that sealed envelope to my kid 
okay  let me ask you this  then 
all these uncircled numbers 
what do they mean 
i don t know yet  maybe nothing 
but the circled   
maybe they all mean nothing 
okay  phil  hey 
can we just start over here 
i m not saying that 81 people
are going to die tomorrow  okay 
i m just trying to understand
why this is saying they will 
okay  it s spooky  all right  i ll grant you 
it s more than spooky 
but just step back  all right 
you have all these uncircled numbers
with no sequence to them 
i mean  numerology 
kabala  pythagorean cults 
there are systems
that find meaning in numbers 
and they are a dime a dozen  why 
because people see
what they want to see in them 
i mean 
that s really what you think i m doing 
yeah  i think that losing allison
has spun you off your axis a little 
and i think it s clouded your judgment 
i m just saying it s clouded your judgment 
don t you think 
  where are you going 
  off campus 
 door opens 
 sighs 
yes 
john  but you do remember her 
miss taylor  oh  yes  i remember lucinda 
she was such a sad little girl 
would you like some iced tea 
oh  no  thank you  thank you 
do you remember the day your students
buried the time capsule 
 chuckling  oh  yes 
the children were so excited 
and what about lucinda 
that was the day we couldn t find her 
she was hiding in a closet  under the gym 
scratching at the door with her fingernails
like some kind of animal 
scratching at the door 
  why was she hiding 
  i m not sure 
she was holding up the class
writing all those silly numbers 
i had to hurry her along 
then we found her 
and i knew something had frightened
the poor dear 
but we never could get her
to tell us what it was 
miss taylor  my son got
lucinda s time capsule message 
do you remember this 
is this what she wrote 
 chuckling  oh  professor  you are testing
an old woman s memory 
  can you believe it s been 50 years 
  it s a long time 
i believe that s it 
how rude of me 
i never offered you a drink 
would you like some iced tea 
no  thank you  i m fine 
i thought maybe i could meet her 
oh  i m sorry 
lucinda passed away several years ago 
i said i m caleb koestler s father 
i m calling to find out
the names of the two janitors
that pulled the time capsule out
of the ground yesterday at the ceremony 
 voices whispering 
 feedback screeching

woman on tv  today we witnessed one of
the worst days in recent us aviation history
when four planes crash landed
across as many states from maine to miami 
one tragically ended in disaster
when flight 74 from pittsburgh came down
2 miles from the runway near
logan international airport and exploded   
can you go upstairs
while i talk to your dad 
no act of terrorism
is expected to be involved 
the national transportation safety board
is looking into possibilities
that a malfunction in the navigational
systems of the planes caused the crashes   
  you didn t tell him anything 
  of course not 
first estimates put
the presumed dead at 81 
  grace  do you need to talk 
  nts is linking
possible navigational malfunctions
  to an unprecedented level   
  i just   
    of electromagnetic radiation
from a series   
i just want to sleep 
government officials are quick to reiterate
that at this time
no act of terrorism is suspected
to be involved 
what happened  dad  what s going on 
truck broke down on the highway 
it s more than that  isn t it 
i m going to bed 
get your homework done 
and you should go to bed  too 
no tv tonight 
  why  i always watch an hour of tv 
  no more questions  caleb 
i can ask questions when you tell me
things to do that don t make sense 
you won t let me play soccer 
you won t let me stay over at jason s 
and now you won t tell me what s going on
and why you re acting so weird all the time 
i m not a kid anymore 
 door slams 
 car approaching 
oh  my god  john  you    you were there 
the date  the number of dead 
the gps coordinates  lat and long 
  why didn t i see that 
  it wasn t coincidence 
i drove past at the exact moment
the prediction came true 
it s not coincidence 
okay  john  i didn t say it was 
so what are we calling this 
synchronicity 
two unrelated events 
digging up a time capsule  plane crash 
combined to create a significance
for the subject  you 
i keep seeing their faces 
burning 
oh  man 
okay  look 
we re way beyond the bounds here  john 
we don t have a frame of reference 
there could be multiple meanings
to consider 
there are two disasters left 
what are you saying 
the numbers are warnings meant for me 
they might just as easily
be a warning to stay away 
you could have been killed today  john 
caleb would have been orphaned 
and you want to go put yourself
back in harm s way 
two disasters left 
right now my scientific mind is telling me
to have nothing more to do with this 
and yours should  too 
 creaking 
 voices whispering 
 whispers growing louder 
caleb  dad 
caleb  what s wrong  what s wrong 
 crying  dad 
it s okay  it s okay 
it s just a bad dream 
it s just a bad dream 
hey 
hey 
you stay away from us  you hear 
want some of this 
caleb  one  two  three   
  got your hat  honey 
  yeah 
 clears throat 
caleb  why don t you check out
the dire wolf 
  i ll catch up with you  okay 
  okay 
do you know that all wolves are born deaf 
really 
but  you know  when they get older 
they can hear another wolf s howl
from 10 miles away 
wow  how did you know that 
i read it in a national geographic 
woman on pa  mammal responses to rising
temperatures and other climate changes   
hi 
hi 
is that your daughter 
  yeah  why 
  why  that s my son 
and they look like
they re already best friends 
yeah  abby s probably telling him
about the animals 
even as a baby 
she was completely fascinated with them 
yeah  he s the same 
he likes extinct animals 
i m john 
hi  diana 
what are they doing now 
john  caleb s showing her something
in sign language 
  i m sorry  i didn t realize   
  he s not 
sounds just get jumbled up sometimes 
he has a hearing aid  which helps 
but he s not deaf 
he is an expert in sign language 
i don t think it s ever been this hot
in october 
air conditioner must be out 
caleb  dad  can we get a drink 
can we get one  too 
hey  would you and abby like to join us

abby  hi 
john  hey  abby 
abby  what s that over there 
diana  it can be tough sometimes 
because  you know  i m by myself 
john  i know how you feel 
  you re a single parent  too 
  yeah 
i kicked him out years ago 
he couldn t keep his hands to himself 
so i decided he couldn t keep me
to himself either 
well  it s    it s his loss 
and you  you re separated  or   
diana 
we didn t meet here by accident 
i need to talk to you about something

  yeah  it s awkward  you don t know me 
i m john koestler 
i teach astrophysics at mit 
my son goes to william dawes elementary 
which is the same school
your mother went to 
fifty years ago  she put this
in a time capsule  it s a list of dates 
events that i think
she believed would happen 
look  i don t know
what any of this is about   
and i thought if i could talk to you
or your father   
my father s dead 
i think it s possible that there are people 
like your mother  lucinda 
who can see things before they occur 
abby  we re leaving 
honey 
i followed one of your mother s predictions
and i watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday 
when she said it would happen 
where she said it would happen 
and there was nothing i could do about it 
she says 170 people will die tomorrow
in new york city 
and in three days  time 
october 19th  33 more

caleb  go inside 
  hey 
  hi 
  want to check out the house 
  sure 
you said october 19th 
my mother used to talk about that day
all the time 
she said it was the day i was going to die 
diana  all my life i ve had this thing
hanging over my head
and abby s 
i just don t believe
anyone can predict my future 
and what does it matter  anyway 
we all die in the end 
i don t want to know what my future holds 
last year  my wife was on
a business trip to phoenix
a few days before my birthday
and a fire started in her hotel
at 4 00 in the morning 
the investigators said
that allison died of smoke inhalation 
died in her sleep 
she wouldn t have known
anything about it 
while she was dying 
i was at home  in the front yard 
i always thought
you were supposed to sense
when the people you love are in danger 
but i didn t feel anything 
nothing 
i was just blowing leaves off the lawn 
i m so sorry  john 
well  but my point is that from then on 
i decided that no one can know
what was coming 
and life was just a string
of random accidents and mistakes 
and then i got that list 
if that had come to me before allison left 
i would have saved her life 
i need to know 
it s still here 
what s this 
have you seen this 
abby used to do this sometimes 
write things backwards 
and that last number  i don t think it s 33 
it s ee 
ee  initials  someone she knew 
i don t know 
diana  i was nine when she overdosed 
the only time i ever came out here
was with my father
when he identified her body 
she willed the property to me 
but i never came back for any of her things 
when i was little  my mother used
to tell me that she could hear voices
whispering to her 
telling her horrible things 
and then one day 
my dad came and took me away from her 
he said she was sick 
she said she moved out here to get ready 
i never knew what she meant by that 
i made this for her one christmas 
i never knew she kept it 
she used to stare at this picture for hours 
diana  that s where they found her 
in there 
have you seen enough 
yeah  okay  we ll go 
 voices whispering 
abby 
abby 
 whispers growing louder 
man   whispering  abby

they said we could go with them 
if we chose to 
  who did  baby  who 
  the whisper people 
 twigs snapping 
hey  lock the doors 
 panting 
what do you want with my son 
answer me 
 panting 
john  i just know they ve been following us
for days 
i think someone s been following me
and abby  too 
that s why she didn t write
any coordinates down after the final date 
there isn t a single location this time 
are you telling me that my mother
could see the end of everything 
that we re all going to die tomorrow 
she was disturbed  john 
she could ve just made it all up 
she s been right so far  diana 
about everything 
abby s    abby s all i ve got  john 
i can t let anything happen to her 
 john sighs 
caleb  you really need to sleep 
i can hear them whispering to me
sometimes like abby can 
could lucinda hear them  too 
 sighs

caleb 
okay  all right 
hey  john  what happened 
hey 
talk to me  what happened 
i ve been calling you off the hook
ever since i heard about the subway 
john 
do you remember that paper
on extra solar activity i published 
yeah  sure  i remember 
i found evidence of a series of super flares
from a star in the outer pleiades region 
phil  right  ratings were off the chart 
 sighs 
we were both wrong 
the numbers are a warning 
but not just to me or any random group 
they re a warning to everyone 
okay  you re officially scaring
the shit out of me right now 
the super flare  in our own solar system 
a 100 microtesla wave of radiation
that would destroy our ozone layer 
killing every living organism on the planet 
we have to let everyone know 
we have to call the noaa 
they already know 
the announcement will come anytime now 
i thought there was some purpose
to all of this 
why did i get this prediction
if there s nothing i can do about it 
how am i supposed
to stop the end of the world 
 diana gasps 
go home  phil  be with kim tonight 
diana 
 crying  i m so stupid 
i ve spent my whole life
knowing she was right
and pretending that she was insane 
if we hide underground 
we ve got a chance  don t we 
it s possible 
i know some caves
off route 40 past groton 
hardly anyone knows about them 
but i used to play there as a child 
we could try there  right

one was the gift of prophecy 
1 corinthians 12  yes  i remember it 
the church should respect the prophet 
i have a prophecy 
it s about to be proven accurate 
i need you to respect it
and receive it as the truth 
this heat we re experiencing
isn t going to get better 
it s going to get worse  much worse 
i need you to get mom and grace
and any supplies you can 
and get below ground tonight

infrastructure than we originally thought 
we re recommending that people
stay indoors until further notice 
bring your pets inside 
stock up on extra water and  if possible 
seek out fortified underground shelter 
  general  what time is it happening 
  general  excuse me   
general  the shelters we have
are currently overwhelmed 
the best advice we can offer the public
is to seek your own 
reporter 1  sir 
reporter 2 
one more question about the warning 
general  we are assessing this information
as it becomes available 
it was only recently confirmed 
reporter 2  where is the president

are currently being transported
to a secure location 
  john  hello
