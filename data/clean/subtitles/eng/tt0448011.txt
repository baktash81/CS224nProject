john caleb take a look at this
caleb there you go
what is it
saturns rings await your approval
has anyone found life on other planets
not yet guess its just us for now
caleb okay
then how many that might have life
well if you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy
then you factor in the probability that
they have earthlike planets orbiting them
there are 10 million possible worlds
with four million mature enough
for life to evolve
why do you even ask
just making sure if youre listening
where you going
to watch that discovery program
john but its dads famous sunday night
hot dogs on the run
time
i cant consume that
ive decided to become a vegetarian
well when were you planning on
telling the guy
who buys the groceries around here
are you deaf i just told you now dad
man on tv the cubs are now
six months old and bounding with energy
but any parent knows
this is also a mixed blessing
off
no its almost over
youre not gonna be able to concentrate
in class tomorrow
i dont have class tomorrow
its the 50th anniversary remember
i remember
caleb
when i said it was just us out there
you know i was talking about space right
i didnt mean heaven or anything
im sure wherever mom is
dad you dont even believe in heaven
i never said that caleb
i just said we cant know for sure thats all
if you want to believe
you go ahead and believe okay
okay bedtime
hey you and me
together forever
forever
i love you
i love you too
sighs
classical music playing
were going to pose a topic
to get you thinking along the right lines
for your term paper
its the subject of randomness
versus determinism in the universe
whos jumping in jessica
determinism says
that occurrences in nature
are causally decided by preceding events
or natural laws
that everything leading up to this point
has happened for a reason
thats right thats what determinism says
spencer tell me something about the sun
its hot
students laughing
elaborate
temperatures about 10000 degrees
fahrenheit on the surface
27 million degrees at the core
good
stacey
students laughing
a word or two about the composition
mostly hydrogen
also helium with some carbon
and nitrogen thrown in there
excellent now i want you to think
about the perfect set of circumstances
that put this celestial ball of fire
at just the correct distance
from our little blue planet for life to evolve
making it possible for you
to be sitting here in this riveting lecture
students laughing
but thats a nice thought right
everything has a purpose an order to it
is determined
but then theres the other side
of the argument
the theory of randomness
which says its all simply coincidence
the very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex
yet inevitable string of chemical accidents
and biological mutations
there is no grand meaning
theres no purpose
stacey what about you
professor koestler
what
well what do you believe
i think shit just happens
but thats me class dismissed
now thats some very heavy shit
for a monday morning by the sounds of it
since when does the cosmology
department audit my lectures
since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte
john so whats on
your scientific mind today
do you remember kims little sister
phdouble ds remember her
is it ethical to say things like that
about your sisterinlaw
what its factual its peerreviewed
i mean its like anyway whatever
shes in town this friday
okay
and she thinks that youre intriguing
which i thought was code for gay
but apparently not because shes asked
if you would join us for dinner
yeah i i dont know phil
come on john
come on you owe me for last time
you skipped out on me
caleb was panicking
yeah look i know
and the time before that
he had a sore throat
oh no
what
damn it damn it
what
calebs ceremony im sorry phil
hey hey friday

im gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
this little light of mine
im gonna let it shine
im gonna let it shine

john reading
two thousand nine hundred
and ninetysix
come on
what the hell is this
man 1
in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
man 2 there could be
thousands of bodies here
oh my god
caleb dad
dad were gonna be late
children chattering
man do you have your knapsack all set
thanks for the ride mr koestler
dad are you sick
im fine
dont you think youre acting
kind of awkward today
am i awkward
i just had a lot of work to do last night
school bell ringing
okay
bye dad
bye
john look at this
look at the numbers beside the date
phil yeah yeah yeah
john two thousand nine hundred
and ninetysix
phil right
thats how many people died
in the attacks that day
yeah
all right stay with me
i know how this sounds but ive matched
these numbers to the dates
of every major global disaster
for the last 50 years in perfect sequence
except for three
and these events havent occurred yet
starting with this one
so tomorrow somewhere on the planet
this number string predicts
that 81 people are gonna die
in some kind of tragedy
whoa i mean have a listen to yourself
i know
it sounds pretty crazy
i know
i mean even for you
whats this
open it
phil oh
why are you showing me this
the day allison died in the fire
its on the list too
from a piece of paper thats been
buried in the ground for five decades
yeah
can you explain that phil
i was up all night going over this
i went through that list again and again
and i tried to fault it and i couldnt
maybe someones playing
a really shitty joke
right right except i saw them dig it up
i watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground
and hand that sealed envelope to my kid
okay let me ask you this then
all these uncircled numbers
what do they mean
i dont know yet maybe nothing
but the circled
maybe they all mean nothing
okay phil hey
can we just start over here
im not saying that 81 people
are going to die tomorrow okay
im just trying to understand
why this is saying they will
okay its spooky all right ill grant you
its more than spooky
but just step back all right
you have all these uncircled numbers
with no sequence to them
i mean numerology
kabala pythagorean cults
there are systems
that find meaning in numbers
and they are a dime a dozen why
because people see
what they want to see in them
i mean
thats really what you think im doing
yeah i think that losing allison
has spun you off your axis a little
and i think its clouded your judgment
im just saying its clouded your judgment
dont you think
where are you going
off campus
door opens
sighs
yes
john but you do remember her
miss taylor oh yes i remember lucinda
she was such a sad little girl
would you like some iced tea
oh no thank you thank you
do you remember the day your students
buried the time capsule
chuckling oh yes
the children were so excited
and what about lucinda
that was the day we couldnt find her
she was hiding in a closet under the gym
scratching at the door with her fingernails
like some kind of animal
scratching at the door
why was she hiding
im not sure
she was holding up the class
writing all those silly numbers
i had to hurry her along
then we found her
and i knew something had frightened
the poor dear
but we never could get her
to tell us what it was
miss taylor my son got
lucindas time capsule message
do you remember this
is this what she wrote
chuckling oh professor you are testing
an old womans memory
can you believe its been 50 years
its a long time
i believe thats it
how rude of me
i never offered you a drink
would you like some iced tea
no thank you im fine
i thought maybe i could meet her
oh im sorry
lucinda passed away several years ago
i said im caleb koestlers father
im calling to find out
the names of the two janitors
that pulled the time capsule out
of the ground yesterday at the ceremony
voices whispering

woman on tv today we witnessed one of
the worst days in recent us aviation history
when four planes crashlanded
across as many states from maine to miami
one tragically ended in disaster
when flight 74 from pittsburgh came down
2 miles from the runway near
logan international airport and exploded
can you go upstairs
while i talk to your dad
no act of terrorism
is expected to be involved
the national transportation safety board
is looking into possibilities
that a malfunction in the navigational
systems of the planes caused the crashes
you didnt tell him anything
of course not
first estimates put
the presumed dead at 81
grace do you need to talk
nts is linking
possible navigational malfunctions
to an unprecedented level
i just
of electromagnetic radiation
from a series
i just want to sleep
government officials are quick to reiterate

no act of terrorism is suspected
to be involved

and why youre acting so weird all the time
im not a kid anymore
door slams
car approaching
oh my god john you you were there
the date the number of dead
the gps coordinates lat and long
why didnt i see that
it wasnt coincidence
i drove past at the exact moment
the prediction came true
its not coincidence
okay john i didnt say it was
so what are we calling this
synchronicity
two unrelated events
digging up a time capsule plane crash
combined to create a significance
for the subject you
i keep seeing their faces
burning
oh man
okay look
were way beyond the bounds here john
we dont have a frame of reference
there could be multiple meanings
to consider
there are two disasters left
what are you saying
the numbers are warnings meant for me
they might just as easily
be a warning to stay away
you could have been killed today john
caleb would have been orphaned
and you want to go put yourself
back in harms way
two disasters left
right now my scientific mind is telling me
to have nothing more to do with this
and yours should too
creaking
voices whispering
whispers growing louder
caleb dad

crying dad
its okay its okay
its just a bad dream
its just a bad dream

hey
hi

you said october 19th
my mother used to talk about that day
all the time
she said it was the day i was going to die
diana all my life ive had this thing
hanging over my head
and abbys
i just dont believe
anyone can predict my future
and what does it matter anyway
we all die in the end
i dont want to know what my future holds
last year my wife was on
a business trip to phoenix
a few days before my birthday
and a fire started in her hotel
at 400 in the morning
the investigators said
that allison died of smoke inhalation
died in her sleep
she wouldnt have known
anything about it
while she was dying
i was at home in the front yard
i always thought
you were supposed to sense
when the people you love are in danger
but i didnt feel anything
nothing
i was just blowing leaves off the lawn
im so sorry john
well but my point is that from then on
i decided that no one can know
what was coming
and life was just a string
of random accidents and mistakes
and then i got that list
if that had come to me before allison left
i would have saved her life
i need to know
its still here
whats this
have you seen this
abby used to do this sometimes
write things backwards
and that last number i dont think its 33
its ee
ee initials someone she knew
i dont know
diana i was nine when she overdosed
the only time i ever came out here
was with my father
when he identified her body
she willed the property to me
but i never came back for any of her things
when i was little my mother used
to tell me that she could hear voices
whispering to her
telling her horrible things
and then one day
my dad came and took me away from her
he said she was sick
she said she moved out here to get ready
i never knew what she meant by that
i made this for her one christmas
i never knew she kept it
she used to stare at this picture for hours
diana thats where they found her
in there
have you seen enough
yeah okay well go
voices whispering

john i just know theyve been following us

thats why she didnt write
any coordinates down after the final date
there isnt a single location this time

could see the end of everything
that were all going to die tomorrow
she was disturbed john
she couldve just made it all up

general today no aa has concluded
turn that up
the solar flares may last longer
and cause more damage to our
infrastructure than we originally thought
were recommending that people
stay indoors until further notice
bring your pets inside
stock up on extra water and if possible
seek out fortified underground shelter
general what time is it happening
general excuse me
general the shelters we have
are currently overwhelmed
the best advice we can offer the public
is to seek your own
reporter 1 sir
reporter 2
one more question about the warning
general we are assessing this information
as it becomes available

are currently being transported
to a secure location
