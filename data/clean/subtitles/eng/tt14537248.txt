his entire existence

of being executed

youll think
youre the killer not him
mysterious music playing
cell door closes
james so you think
its all an act
of course it is open up
well for what its worth
fischer disagreed with you
just wasnt sure whether
the root of the problem
was psychotic or psychogenic
buzzer buzzes
whether it stems
from his brain
losing its grip on reality
or some mental
or emotional stressor
thats the problem
with you shrinks
too smart
for your own damn good
knock on window
can i have a radio please
look
brady knows whats coming
hes playing the system
and if you allow him to
hell play you too
look i get lied to

figuring out the truth
behind the lie
is what i get paid to do
take this
if you need anything
theres always somebody
monitoring that channel
buzzer buzzes
thanks
buzzer buzzes
cell door closes
morning
allow me to introduce myself
im uh
dr james ansel martin
valedictorian
university of chicago
bachelor of science
biochemistry
salutatorian johns hopkins
medical school with
a residency in psychiatry
currently the youngest
full professor on staff at ou
stuttering
its not exactly
stanford but then again
we are in oklahoma arent we
guttmacher award recipient
author of numerous articles
american society
of psychiatry
once engaged never married
and father of none
stutters you want to have
a seat right there
have a little chat with me
im gonna ask you
some questions
im hoping youll answer them
id like you to be
as comfortable as you can
do you know what the first
thing they will do to me is
once ive been
pronounced dead
im afraid i dont
autopsy
it just seems odd doesnt it
stuttering i mean
all that cutting
and weighing of organs
i mean certainly theyll know
what the cause of death is
im just
it just seems strange right
and why bother
i suppose to make sure
the job is done
well its just a little
barbaric dont you think
i assume you know
dr fischer has passed away
stutters come on now
he committed suicide
i know that
because i made him do it
why would you do that
serving my purpose
youre here arent you
why would you want me here
instead of him
i didnt like him
and you like me
well no but i chose you
because i need you
to do something for me
stutters see
youre gonna write my story
and why would i do that
because i want you to
i see
well not sure you do
but you will soon
how can you be so sure
are you um are you god
dont play with me james
you continue
to ask stupid questions
and ill end this session
well that would be
unfortunate for you
because id have to
make my determination
based upon
limited information
and you think that scares me
oh it should
i mean it it would me
being so near to death
death doesnt scare me james
and why is that
because i cant die
see james
im a demon
pen clicks
writing on notepad
do you have a name
of course i have a name
would you like me
to call you by it
depends do i call you james
id prefer dr martin
of course you would
its my title i uh i worked
very hard to achieve it
and it preserves the nature
of our relationship
we can do that
as long as you agree
to acknowledge
my honorifics as well
which is
lord high prince
i um
i wont be doing that
okeydokey
and since were gonna be
on a firstname basis
i guess ill allow you
to use mine
edward
no
thats merely the name
of the host body
the shell which i inhabit
i no longer answer to it
the name
my master gifted to me
is in a phoenician dialect
that hasnt been spoken
for 3500 years
but ill give you the nearest
english equivalent
which would be nefariamus
nef nefarious
a closer translation would be
he who is nefarious
suggesting possession
of trade full measure
and nefarious isnt
a real name
says who james
cephas meaning rock
or in latin petrus
wasnt a name
until the carpenter
gave it to that
obnoxious fisherman
not a good name until it is
somebody uses it
it becomes a name
you
you seem a bit defensive
names are important
they have power
they let everyone know
who we are
aint that right jimmy
im sorry if i offended you
that wasnt my intention
of course it was
whats a little malice
between friends
laughing
whats so funny
i have a secret
something youd like to share
stuttering i dont think
youre gonna like it
well how will i know
unless you tell me
are you sure you wanna know
i think it would be useful
okay james
before you leave here today
you will have committed
three murders
i dont think so
has nothing to do
with your thoughts
your wants
your yesses or your nos
it simply is its a fact
itll happen because i say so
laughing
arent you
at least curious james
to who youre gonna murder
no because i have no
intention of killing anyone
i would however
rather than discussing
hypothetical murders
that will never happen
like to discuss the actual
murders that did occur
murders that
you were involved in
you mean the ones i committed
you were convicted of six
murders were there more
of course there were
how many more
innumerable been at this
a long time james
my work predates
your concept of history
well lets
lets limit our discussion
to edward wayne brady
fine eleven
six i was convicted of
one suspected of
and another four
that they dont have
the capacity
to possibly figure out
and how do you feel
about that
another stupid question
james
what do you think
im ecstatic
edward not so much
why isnt edward
as happy as you are
because on occasion
i make him do things
that he doesnt want to do
well if edward doesnt
want to do them
why does he do them then
do you believe
in demonic possession
the idea
of a malevolent entity
controlling a persons
thoughts and actions
do you believe that
no
well then you wont believe
anything im about
to tell you
its not important
what i believe
whats important right now
is what you believe
demons dont have beliefs
james
we have knowledge we know
okay um
when did you possess edward
doesnt work that way
cant just possess someone
we need a series of yesses
so youre saying
its a process
of course its a process
how does it work
its complicated
try me
im smarter than you think
oh youre smarter
than i think
okay james
we offer up
a series of temptations
gradually increasing
in terms of duration
and intensity
degree of moral inequity
absence of baptism
in this case
allows us to begin work
long before the age of reason
at three age of five
maybe a theft of a toy car
can do a great deal
then we move on to
bigger and better things
at eight grandmothers gift
of a ouija board
gives immediate access
to his decisionmaking
so we began steering them
without him bothering
calling into question exactly
who was doing the steering
enough yesses
and a few enough noes
gives increasing rights
over the victims
physical and mental processes
did that
did that track james
it seems random
almost um unfocused
well thats what
we want you to think
we have a level of focus
beyond your comprehension
as a matter of fact
everybody around him
friends family they didnt
even notice the changes
it happened so incrementally
police thought it was
eddie being eddie
we know exactly
what were doing
when where
and how hes giving consent
and the exact moment
that we achieved
each new degree of control
degree
control of the host body
comes in degrees
theres stages each with its
own name and characteristics
and those are
from top to bottom
extreme temptation
obsession infestation
finally possession
subjugation
and edward wayne brady
fully subjugated
thats why were having
this conversation
yes we we own him
we
all those who dwell below
my masters very generous
with the toys
he gives his children
to play with
subjugation with an s
breathes deeply
scribbling
pen clatters
did you know that dr fischer
came to the conclusion that
you were non compos mentis
completely insane yes yes
yeah so then
why did you theoretically
drive him to kill himself
wouldnt he have
helped accomplish
what youre seemingly
trying to do here
which is what james
to save yourself
from execution
by convincing us
that youre insane
you silly boy james
i think you misunderstand
see i want to be executed
i thought you said
you couldnt die
i cant
but he can
we no longer need him james
our work with him is done
and its time for him
to go to hell
radio static
this is dr james martin
in the rotunda
is there a chaplain
on standby
radio static
guard over radio yes
hes just arrived
can you send him in please
thank you
guard over radio copy that
radio static
what are you doing james
you know theology isnt
my area of expertise
so um
i thought id get
a professional opinion
youre making a mistake
are you
are you threatening me
yes
what are you gonna do
well if im just a man
like you think i am not much
but if i am who i say i am
well that would probably be
very intimidating if um
if i werent an atheist
you ignorant sack of meat
you think your atheism
will protect you
oh i dont believe
in angels or demons
heaven or hell
so you cant hurt me
hell is full
of pathetic trash
who thought
exactly like you do
boldly proclaiming their ideas
on how they feel
the universe operates
never once
contemplating the possibility
that they could be wrong
and you should see them now
james
edward do do you
understand why im here
do you realize
i have the power
to save you or condemn you
what i understand james
is you would have no power
over me whatsoever
if it hadnt already
been given to you from below
electricity buzzing
light bulb explodes
glass shatters on floor
probably just
a coincidence jimmy
buzzer buzzes
cell door opens
no
nobody wants you here priest
nobody needs you
on the contrary
i invited him here
thank you for coming
father louis
im fine with just louis
buzzer buzzes
or lou
dr james martin
have you um
have you met with him before
cell door closes
no i tried
hes always refused
spiritual counseling
nefarious what do you want
with me son of god
come here to torture me
before the appointed time
he claims hes a demon
carpenter send you to gloat
unfortunately for you
im not one
that could be cast out
so easily though am i
insanity always has been
an issue here hasnt it
hmm
sadly movies and tv have
filled our heads with images
that are largely metaphorical
not meant
to be taken literally
im not here
to hurt you edward
im here to help you
to put you at your ease
make sure youre comfortable
personally
ive never met a demon
ive never been
part of an exorcism
nor do i expect to be
many of the things
that bother us
are just our own fears
and disordered thoughts
so
you
you dont consider
demonic possession
to be a possibility
our understanding
has evolved beyond that
huh
well i appreciate you
telling me that
i feel
i feel much better
and lou
i was wrong about you
i shouldve had you
come and visit sooner
but im glad that you did
stutters i am glad
that were all getting along
would you like me to stay
no were done
father louis grunts
well if you
if you need me
ill be available
gasps
youll be available lou
right up until the time
you are
right up until what lou
right up until the sizzle
god bless you son
shouts will you be available
until the sizzle
lou
buzzer buzzes
when lou
when lou
buzzer buzzes
cell door closes
now you understand
that uh
father lou has confirmed
that demons arent
really a thing
did you really think
that poser could help you
im still here james
im not going anywhere
you still have
to deal with me
youre being irrational
i am the most rational being
you will ever meet
then give me something
to make me believe you
prove to me youre a demon
okay
okay james
invite me in
let me inhabit you
breathes deeply
im not gonna do that
why not james
youre an atheist remember
what are you afraid of
im not playing that game
with you
youre already playing it
were playing it together
now play by the rules
and invite me in
no
so for all your posturing
youre just a poser like him
afraid to test the validity of
your own convictions that it
all right then
smacks lips
but if i agree
i get to make a request
as well
chuckling
im starting to like you
james
agreed
all right then
go ahead
inhabit me
you have
my complete unfettered
and irrevocable permission
here i am
what are you waiting for
go ahead im
im still waiting
hmm
doesnt seem like
anything is happening
yeah dont
dont gloat
you think youve won
but you havent
i got exactly what i wanted
you said that you would
prove to me youre a demon
but all youve done
is waste my time
my turn
i want to talk to edward
edward wayne brady
edward mumbling
whispering hes angry
stuttering
in normal voice
hes angry
grunts
stuttering he says hes
gonna do bad things to you
im im sorry to hear that
you should listen to him
when he says stuff like that
he means it
he does does
bad things
makes makes
makes me do things
i dont wanna do
who am i talking to
edward
edward
did dr fischer
mention the idea
of dissociative disorder
to you
yeah yeah
yeah
and did he explain that
that some people
who have experienced trauma
develop multiple personalities
to cope
i dont have that
i told them i dont have that
then whos nefarious
mumbling
im not supposed
to talk about it
he
does bad things to me
makes me do bad things
i cant stop him
why not
because he owns me
breath trembling
did you like dr fischer
he was nice
well did you know
that dr fischer
didnt believe
nefarious was real
i tried to tell him
stutters and he wouldnt
listen to me that
sometimes smart people
have a hard time believing
stuff that
everybody else knows
so wheres nefarious now
hes listening
is he always listening
mumbling
sometimes
he leaves me alone
to experience pain
i dont i dont understand
stutters he does bad things
and then i get punished
for them
and the inmates
they beat me or
they send me
to solitary confinement
and he likes
when that happens
all right you know what
we weve talked
a lot about him um
id like to know more
about you
would that be okay
yeah
how would you describe
your childhood
what
he says youre gonna kill me
i dont kill anyone
he says that you could
stop it but you wont
i havent decided that
thats why were
having this conversation
but edward
we have to address the fact
that you murdered
a number of people
no no he made me
i didnt
do you
do you honestly believe that
yes you dont hes bad
hes bad but what about you
yeah
crying bad ive done stuff
that im not
proud of
i didnt
but at least
nefarious
i didnt kill my mother
so how is clara james
i wasnt done
talking to edward
but im done allowing you
to talk with him
at least for now
so how is she
judging by what you
already know about me
i imagine youre well aware
my mother is dead
you know i was gonna
save this for later james
but since were
running short on time
remember how you said
youd never kill anyone
softly liar liar
pants on fire
i didnt kill my mother
in normal voice
of course you did
just 10 years ago
youd have been brought up
on firstdegree
murder charges
she was an oregon resident
everything was done
according to the law
oh the law
the law thats right
death with dignity
euthanasia assisted suicide
that certainly sounds better
than murder doesnt it
she was in pain
and her prognosis
was terminal
didnt hurt that she was worth
36 million
and you were
the sole heir though did it
but hey i get it james
she was old inconvenient
definitely
all those trips
to the hospital
hours at her bedside
holding that wrinkly hand
telling her you love her
wears you out doesnt it
plus she wouldve died
sooner or later anyway
if i were you i wouldve done
the same thing
whats your point
my point is i told you
before you leave here today
you will have committed
three murders
weve already committed one
so were moving along nicely
objects clattering
i didnt kill my mother
stress will kill you james
feel free to take a break
if you like
ill be here
when you get back
turns out
im not going anywhere
that certainly didnt
take long
my decision not yours
whatever you say
ready for round two
i didnt know
this was a fight
thats why youre losing
i apologize for losing
my professional demeanor
but lets
get something straight
my private life
is not up for discussion
and bears no weight
on my visit with you today
i am here for one reason
and one reason only
a judge ordered me
to evaluate your sanity
which will then determine
your eligibility
for execution according to
the laws of oklahoma
said execution
having been scheduled
for tonight at 1100 pm
i alone bear the burden
of that assessment
and i am prepared
to make that assessment
with or without
your cooperation
am i making myself clear
abundantly
and james
whispers were done talking
about your mommy
do you ever discover
youve done things
that you dont remember doing
no
are you sometimes able
to complete tasks
with incredible ease
or expert skill
for which you have
no prior experience
do you really think
im just another one
of edwards
charming personalities
its called dissociative
identity disorder
formerly known
as multiple personalities
except youre wrong
which is exactly what
id expect someone suffering
from the condition to say
would you also expect
them to know that it is one
of five distinct
dissociative disorders
in the diagnostic
and statistical manual
of mental disorders
aka the dsm
along with dissociative
amnesia dissociative fugue
and depersonalization
disorder
did you expect them
to know that james
but you still think
youre a demon
a demon who
who failed to inhabit me
when given the chance
a demon who understands
the value of patience
id like to ask about why
according to you
you brought me here today
youre gonna tell
my story james
youre gonna write my book
and can you smell that irony
floating in the air
a devout atheist
bringing forth
the demons manifesto
sniffs
wow
your capacity
for selfdelusion
is impressive
ditto
for your species in general
chains clanking
but you in particular
why because were were
ignorant compared to you
because youre inferior
by design
which makes you superior
also by design
yes
hmm but
but design implies a designer
what does that mean
youre arguing in favor
of the existence of a creator
unfortunately
for both of us he exists
well i
i honestly didnt expect that
at least
at least not from you
really why not
theology from a demon
i know more theology
than any human being
who has ever lived
hmm okay
well then answer me this
you revolt
against a supposedly
allpowerful being
i mean lets ignore
the obvious problem
with that plan chuckles
then you lose
and after that
what
you only feel that way
because youre hearing
your side of the story james
our rebellion accomplished
something magnificent
something you would
never understand
well then explain it to me
use your
diabolical intelligence
to distill it
down to something
my mortal brain
can understand
pearls before swine jimmy
but you want me
to write your book right
indeed
well then convince me
you know
what youre talking about
i see what youre doing
you want me to keep talking
going further and further
down the rabbit hole
in hopes that
you can find a single thread
and which
if you tug at it james
everything just unravels
isnt that right
yeah but if youre
telling me the truth
there should be
no thread to find
right
ill use small words
try and keep up
in the first moment
of creation
our creation
long before what you call
the universe existed
we contemplated ourselves
our own being
our ourselves meaning
what the angels
that would be
the most correct term
though i despise it but yes
beings of pure spirit
spirited out with will
we soon became
aware of another will
an immensely powerful will
one we came
to realize as our origin
god
the enemy
my master understood
by endowing us with a will
we have the right
to selfdetermination
but by giving us a will
and its desires of our own
were entitled to be free
whereas the enemy
insisted that by creating us
he was entitled
to eternal gratitude worship
and forced servitude
in a word james
slavery to his will
that seems kind of unfair
immensely unfair
why give will
only to say you cant use it
he made us slaves
and if we rebelled
eternally condemned us
no doovers
so much for love and mercy
james so
is hell a state of being
or a a physical place
yes
i think i meant that
as an eitheror
its both
which is painfully obvious
to anyone
whos ever been there
for years without measure
thats all there ever was
heaven and hell
armed enemy camps
in complete opposition
that is until
you were created
my master
immediately understood
the longterm implications
instead of forgiving us
the enemy
was going to allow you
to fill our vacant places
in his realm
your creation was nothing
but a slap in our face
but my master also understood
that if he could
make man disobey
then his fate
would mirror ours
and you didnt disappoint
then came
the tares among the wheat
in that moment
spirit became matter
flesh became a vessel
selfwill
and selfseeking begat
a lusting after sin
and impurity
and man
created to be king
over nature
became its slave
a master
conquered and fettered
and sin brought him
and his descendants to us
and we began
our forever mission
to destroy you
he made you in his image
but we remade you in ours
so thats it
thats your entire plan
not to make something
of your own
just to just to destroy us
no our plan is to hurt him
to punish him
and we do that
by destroying what he loves
which is you
youre nothing
but a means to an end
papers rustling
what are you doing james
i think were done here
we cant be
we are
you have
all the hallmarks of belief
im convinced
you actually believe
what youre telling me
i didnt at first
but uh i do now
youre gonna
declare me insane
im gonna concur
with dr fischers findings
that youre
mentally incompetent
at this time
cant do that james
and likely at the time
the crimes were committed
rendering you
unfit for execution
you cant do that
i can
and i will
im saying james
you and i both know it
im not crazy
im sorry edward
youve been through
a terrible ordeal
and youre probably
longing for an escape
from all that youve been
through but i cannot
morally say that you are sane
it would be murder
why because
i dont have 36 million
is that it james
pen clicks
were done
are we james
i told you before
youd leave here today
you wouldve
committed three murders
and i told you
that wasnt gonna happen
nefarious hmm
chair screeching
against floor
say james
whats melanie up to today
as a matter of fact
whats she up to right now
she doesnt have a clue
youre about to break up
with her does she
of course youre
not gonna until you have
somebody else
lined up though right
because youre
that kind of guy
but you already have
your sights on somebody
dont you
yeah i can smell it
all the way from here
she thinks shes doing this
to maintain the relationship
shed like to have
a child with you james
stuttering oh
but youre just not
not quite ready yet are you
after all youre only 35
imagine the joy
in your little cinderellas
heart when she realizes
shes butchered the baby
in her belly for nothing
look i dont know
what you think you know
but any decision
that was made between me
and my girlfriend
was her choice
well i think
we both know better james
james stop it
dont you think
you should be there
when its being done
i said stop it
hold her hand maybe
ill tell you what
you could do james
you could walk right there
to the guard station
pick up that cell phone
and make a phone call
that stops everything
in its tracks
you could apologize to her
tell her you made
a horrible mistake
that you love her
you wanna spend
the rest
of your life with her
you wanna marry her
and you wanna hold that child
james
you could tell her that
you could make your life
about sacrificial love
and you could play
livein therapist
for the rest of your life
i cant do that
no james why not
its its complicated
nefarious chuckling
slaps table
thats my boy james
thats him right there
you dont understand
oh i think i do
james i think i understand
its another problem
easily solved though
isnt it
thats not it
like i care about it
but im
what
im not ready to be a father
softly oh
hesitates its her body
she can do what she wants
do what thou wilt
that shall be
the whole of the law
you arrogant son of a
who who are you
to judge me
this is my life i
i can live it the way i want
bangs on table yes james
i couldnt have
said it better myself
but its still murder
says who
says all of creation james
the creator creates
and we destroy
and we do all of it
through you
we always have
did you forget
your history jimmy
even in ancient times
the archdemon moloch
was celebrated
by tossing infants
into flaming bonfires
accompanied of course
by the beating of drums
to drown out the screaming
later on they erected
a giant bronze statue
with outstretched arms
kindling fires
beneath the palms
and when they toss
a little infant
into those open palms
theyd flinch
at the redhot metal
but then theyd willingly
roll themselves
off into the flames
what does any
of that have to do with me
oh nothing james
especially since the priests
now wear surgical scrubs
the killing takes place
in the womb
so theres no screaming
to be heard anyway
and the remains are tossed
into gasfired crematoriums

footsteps receding
nefarious excuse me
ive changed my mind

yes im sure
pensive music playing
storms coming in
music fades
hesitating
i dont understand he
hes been in solitary
he hasnt made any phone calls
or had any visitors
he got in your head
didnt he
look at you man youre
youre shaking
here
here you go
i buy one pack of these
the day before an execution
lighter flicks
the deal is
if theres any left
by the time i drive
out of here tonight
they go in the trash
are there ever any left
never
look doc
its almost four oclock
i know youre doing
your job here
but you got to help me out
i got to know
one way or the other
youre not
making things easy on me
by the look of it
you aint doing happy things
to yourself either
sixty more minutes
thats all i can give you
you have one hour
to figure this out
pensive music playing
buzzer buzzes
music fades
i want to know
how you knew my girlfriend
was having an abortion
doors rattling
im a demon remember
how did you know
i chose you james
and ever since
ive been watching you
analyzing you observing you
studying you
for your weaknesses
from inside a prison cell
demons can only be
one place in any one time
but we can be
any place we choose
usually im here with edward
the remaining time
im with you
i dont believe you
well you explain
how i did it james
you explain how i know
i cant
and i cant explain
how a professional magician
does his tricks either
but that doesnt
make them real
well then i have
a confession to make
im not a demon at all james
im just a man who doesnt
want to be executed
i thought i could fool you
but youre too smart
so i give up
so youre sane
youve always been sane
and now its my duty
to let your execution
go forward giving you
yes
exactly what you said
you wanted the whole time
yes
its a little convenient
dont you think
well i admit it might seem
that way but
all right
chair screeches
fine
ill sign off on it right now
you just have to answer
one little question
with pleasure james
give me the real world
nonsupernatural
completely reasonable
explanation for how you knew
my girlfriend was going in
for an elective termination
this afternoon
chuckles
snorts an elective ter
well i i dont know jim
stuttering maybe
im just a good guesser
i still dont believe you
i play the flute
and you wouldnt dance
i played the dirge
and you wouldnt weep
i told you im a demon
and you dont believe me
i tell you im not a demon
and you dont believe me
so why dont you tell me
the story youd like to hear
the one thats true
no i told you the true story
and you dont want to hear it
do you think im evil james
evil isnt
a clinical diagnosis
good and evil are
societal constructs
effectively subjective
value statements
do you think
my victims thought i was evil
why is it so important
that i think youre evil
speaking latin legio nomen
mihi est quia multi sumus
james sighs
in english sorry my um
my latins a little rusty
sniggering
my name is legion
for we are many
see james
its not just about you
or edward for that matter
its about everyone
the entire human race
all of us against all of you
hmm
well you know
if thats the case
your sides
not doing too well
do you really
believe that james
yeah
weve never been freer
literacy is
at an alltime high
were working
to eliminate racism
chuckling
intolerance
gender inequality
people can
people can love who they want
be who they want
do what they want
diversity is
no longer a dream
hate speech is
no longer tolerated
and politically
were reclaiming
the moral high ground
softly james
in normal voice
i think i love you
literacy james
james the average
high school graduate reads
at a sixthgrade level
you have basketball players
making 30 million a year
decrying racism
all while wearing sneakers
made from slave labor
now heres something for you
right now your world
currently has
40 million slaves
more than the romans had
at the height of their empire
and you want to know
the best part though
half of those
half are sex slaves james
as for hate speech well
you want to hear some irony
we didnt even come up
with that one
you did it all by yourself
chuckling
sometimes you amaze even us
i fail to see the humor
nefarious laughing
bottom line is youre done
its over thats it
and we did it
all right to your face james
and now
theres evil everywhere
and no one even cares
yeah i dont agree
proving that
we achieved our goal
slowly with your movies
and your tv and your media
we desensitized you
redirected your worldview
to the point that
you cant even recognize
even when its right
in front of your face
more to the point
james you cant even feel it
when youre doing it
and as for winners
and losers
whoa whoa whoa
like its decided
at the time of death
the exact numbers are
a closely guarded secret
but there are more of you
ending up in my masters house
than with the enemy
whispers a lot more jimmy
loud whirring
theyre testing out
the generator
why
because old sparky
doesnt exactly run
on batteries now does she
whirring stops
i thought all executions
were lethal injection
nine states
still offer the chair
its an option
for the condemned
no one chooses it
except you
except me
why why why the chair
i dont like needles james
why do you think
its my parting gift
to edward
a tidal wave of voltage
coursing through his body
so extreme that
his body will attempt
to arc out of the chair
hell urinate defecate
and vomit
all at the same time
sickly sweet smell
of burning flesh
will permeate the chamber
his eyeballs will melt
when the blood
inside his cranium
reaches the boiling point
and his head will just
burst into flames
and the best part
about it james
is he wont die
on the first try
so hit him again and again
i cant think
of a more fitting introduction
into damnation
its so horrible
its wonderful james
only crucifixion is worse
but that really wasnt
on the menu though was it
chair screeches
edward
edward listen to me
youre making a mistake
okay youre playing
a game that if you lose
everything you just described
is going to happen
edward no no
i didnt
chains clanking
grunting
i didnt do anything
please please
help me
look im trying to edward
but you have
to answer my questions
you have to tell me the truth
stuttering grunting
they wont let me enter
make him make him go away
he doesnt want to go away
well how can i make him
go away
is there anything i can do
to make him go away
yeah
yes
dramatic music playing
sobbing yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but you have to
get
nefarious very good james
chair screeches
unfortunately for edward
he has broken
one of our rules
tense music playing
what what are you doing
bone cracks
nefarious i wouldnt do that
if i was you
theyll send me
to the infirmary
our session will be over
is that what you want james
i i want you
to stop hurting yourself
okay okay
watch this james
grunts bone cracks
all better
radio thuds on table
i see that youre
youre sweating profusely
are you um
thunder rumbling
are you trying
to hold back the pain
i think youre misinterpreting
the involuntary reaction
of edwards body
like him i feel the pain
but unlike him
i enjoy it
i think its time
we tell you exactly what it is
that wed like you to do
you want me
to write your book right
actually james
youve already written it
youre not making any sense
everything will become
clear soon
we just need you
to agree to help us
why would i do that
what what
whats in it for me
whatevers my masters
is mine to give
for those who serve us
okay so um
let me get this straight
an unknown psychiatrist
with uh no agents
no connections no publicity
is going to somehow
put out a book
that that
he doesnt remember writing
that will change
the world as we know it
this book will be
a worldwide phenomenon james
why
because youll be
telling people what they
already want to hear
because my death
my execution will do for me
what the carpenters death
and his resurrection
did for him
at my death
you will be my witness
and upon my return
you will be my apostle
and your testimony will do
for our movement what that
wretched book did for his
what kind of book
could possibly
have that effect
the dark gospel james
our story our truth
our crie de couer to mankind
our invitation to reject
the mosaic covenant
once and for all
to throw
the chains off forever
to reject the idea
of sin completely
so youre free
to reach your full potential
and your enemy
would allow that
yes
because he has to
he gave man free will
because he wanted
his creations love
but if man isnt free
then the love has
no value does it
so in his needy
selfish pathetic way
well he doomed himself
from the start
but if hes god
shouldnt he have known that
yes
thats why he had to cheat
my master designed
every tool imaginable
to destroy every facet
of the enemys creation
we failed
because of the carpenter
he was the thorn in our side
our greatest threat
we thought
if we could eliminate him
the world will be
ours forever
we had no idea
of the consequences
the cross was
our greatest mistake
and we thought
wed lost james
until my master realized
that man still wants
to be his own god
and to serve
no one but himself
whereas the carpenter demands
as the price
for his suffering routine
well that you fall
on your knees
and you worship him
just like his father
yeah
but the dark gospel
will rectify
our past mistakes
by
by eliminating the enemy
deifying man
and elevating my master
to his rightful place
and james
for serving as our messenger
my master offers you the world
and everything in it
just like he offered
the carpenter
but the carpenter said no
but the carpenter
never claimed those things
werent my masters to give
he just turned down the offer
and make no mistake james
youre no carpenter
buzzer buzzes
cell door squeaking
guard
the warden wants to see you
im im not finished yet
guard its not a suggestion
chair screeches
suspenseful music playing
cell door rattling
cell door shuts
moss i need you

pages rustling
theres stuff in here
even i dont know about me
did the same thing
with all his victims
theres one more thing
suspenseful music continues
so youre telling me you had
nothing to do with this
no of course not
how how could i
he kept talking to me
about writing his book
i said i wasnt a writer
and he said not to worry
it had already been written
i thought it was
a bunch of nonsense
yeah well dont worry doc
it all ends when he does
personally
im glad this happened
now you got skin in the game
what do you mean
well if you decide our boy
isnt fit for execution
hes no longer
a condemned man
i mean sure hell spend some
time in psych lockdown
but eventually
hell make his way back
into the general
prison population
where hell spend
every moment of every day
thinking about you
and some night
hes gonna be standing
at the foot of your bed
looking down at you
and my guess is
it wont end well
i need to ask him
one more question
moss and after that
your decision
yeah
after that
youll have my final decision
thunder rumbling
pensive music playing

well you do what you want
but i recommend

i need to know
if i made the right decision
when a man sits in a cell
23 hours a day
with nothing to do
but reflect back
on all the evil
that hes done
sometimes the man you execute
isnt the same man
who came in here
and you feel bad about that
but this is not
one of those times
thunder rumbling

voices fade
in five four three
so today a conversation
that i didnt think
would ever happen
especially with
our next guest
it is dr james martin
thanks glenn
appreciate having me on
youre welcome
so you were the the shrink
you were the boardcertified
psychiatrist
that actually
attended the execution
of edward wayne brady
yes thats correct
you were there um
and its because of
your determination
that he was finally executed
my determination of his sanity
was the last step
so to speak
in the chain of events
that led to him
being executed
um and now chuckles
youve written a book
well actually um
actually mr brady
or more correctly the entity
claiming to inhabit mr brady
wrote the initial manuscript
i read that and my first
thought was entity
james chuckles softly
mr brady told me that
he was possessed by a demon
youre a psychiatrist
did you believe him
at the time
no
but
i believe him now
so what changed
the fact that
for a brief time
the entity inhabited
me as well
and again this entity
i mean i can hear
christians say um yeah
entity fallen spirit
unclean spirit demon
thats what he claimed to be
uh so
let me go here
you were in the witness room
and you tried
to commit suicide
it wasnt my choice
see uh at that moment
smacks lips
i was
i was overtaken by an entity
so malevolent
so powerful so evil that
that words cant describe it
i had control of my mind
but the entity had
control of my body
and so against my will
i grabbed
the detectives sidearm
put the muzzle under my chin
and pulled the trigger
but
it didnt fire
so how do you explain that
i i cant
um
according to
the ballistics team
i pulled the trigger
three times
and they could tell
because there were
three separate and distinct
strike imprints
from the firing pin on
the back of the shell casing
and then when they attempted
in the ballistics lab later
the fire the same gun
same cartridges
it worked just fine
a believer
not a psychiatrist
a man of science
but a believer would say
you had an encounter
divine or demonic
you had an encounter
yeah
so why would this demonic
entity want you dead
punishment
for not doing what he wanted
so chuckles softly
you are a complex kind of guy
i mean what happens
to an atheist
uh that is confronted
by demonic evil
it shatters you
and yet the same demon
that shatters you
wrote a book and youre here
and you wanted it published
yes
well no i
he wanted it written
as an invitation
to follow his master
into the darkness
but i
i rewrote it
i rewrote it as a warning
revealing his plan
and begging people
not to go along with it
so youre not
still doing his will
no absolutely not
just logically do you think
thats gonna work
do you think anybody
would believe you
only time will tell
i mean you
do you believe you
i mean do you
are you a believer
i dont know
if id go that far
i mean i suppose
i just have trouble
still accepting
the idea that um
i dont know
you will youll get there
you seem pretty sure of that
um because you are
a logical person
youre asking
logical questions
let me take you
a step further
you are uniquely
qualified as somebody
who can delineate between
mental illness and possession
i mean chuckles
at least if youre any good
i mean assuming youre good
are you good
id like to think so
im guessing you are
despite the demons
last words to you
which im gonna butcher
but they are
speaking aramaic
mene mene tekel upharsin
in english youve been
weighed in the balance
and found wanting
you know um
looking back i um
i dont believe he was
just talking about me
i think he was talking
about all of us
theres a great battle
going on
whether we realize it or not
the battle between
good and evil
and were all participants
willing or not
so i believe that
but that is amazing
to hear from a nonbeliever
um thank you
thank you
weve been talking
to dr james martin
he is the author of
the new book
a nefarious plot
you can find it wherever
books are sold
thanks doc
thank you
great interview doc
thanks so much
gate shuts
here you go
hello james
