 fischer screaming 
glenn   on radio  meanwhile 
in the state of oklahoma 
today is
the scheduled day of execution
for edward wayne brady 
and  kids 
all it took was just
a string
of cold blooded murders 
incontrovertible evidence 
a confession 
a jury of his peers
and 11 years
of legal wrangling
to get us to game day 
i mean  what the heck
is wrong with us 
i mean 
can somebody please tell me
why this guy
is still sucking air 
how is this guy still alive 
guard 1   over radio 
he s expected 
let him through 
 protestors clamoring 
 buzzer buzzing 
 indistinct radio chatter

for the psychiatric evaluation
of edward wayne brady

in possession
of any alcohol  tobacco 
firearms or narcotics

and phone in the pass through 
moss  welcome to the least
happy place on earth 
 warden tom moss 
 nice to meet you 
thanks for filling in
on short notice 
no offense  but i d rather
not be here at all 
yeah  you and everybody else 
look  why don t you just
sign off  and we ll be done 
unfortunately 
that s not the way it works 
everyone deserves
an impartial review 
not everyone  follow me 
  buzzer buzzes 
 sorry to hear
about dr  fischer 
did you know him 
i did  yes 
he was  uh 
something of a mentor to me 
yeah  well  i tell you this 
his timing sucked 
every time this guy brady s
number comes up 
something happens 
execution scheduled
for 11 00 p m 
that s not
for public knowledge 
so please don t convey that
to anyone 
we re going
to need your decision
by 4 00 p m  at the latest 
if we re gonna stay
on schedule 
if there s any problems 
i d rather know sooner
than later 
if we re gonna
do my job properly 
we re gonna need some privacy 
no  it s not a problem 
he s been taken from his cell 
you ll be meeting him
in a common area 
normally 
that s where we allow
last contact with family 
but he doesn t have any 
from there  he ll be showered 
taken to the holding cell
in the death house
not far from
the execution chamber 
that s where he ll be spending
his last couple hours 
i m assuming you already
reviewed the fischer files 
yes 
then you already know
he s a master manipulator 
absolute genius 
and right now 
his entire existence
is focused on one thing 
convincing you
he s totally insane 
and therefore incapable
of being executed
under state law 
yeah 
you listen to him 
by the time
he s done with you 
he ll have your head
so twisted around
you ll think
you re the killer  not him 
 mysterious music playing 
 cell door closes 
james  so you think
it s all an act 
of course it is  open up 
well  for what it s worth 
fischer disagreed with you 
just wasn t sure whether
the root of the problem
was psychotic or psychogenic 
 buzzer buzzes 
whether it stems
from his brain
losing its grip on reality
or some mental
or emotional stressor 
that s the problem
with you shrinks 
too smart
for your own damn good 
  knock on window 
 can i have a radio  please 
look 
brady knows what s coming 
he s playing the system 
and if you allow him to 
he ll play you  too 
look  i get lied to
all the time 
figuring out the truth
behind the lie
is what i get paid to do 
take this 
if you need anything 
there s always somebody
monitoring that channel 
 buzzer buzzes 
thanks 
 buzzer buzzes 
 cell door closes 
morning 
allow me to introduce myself 
i m  uh   
dr  james ansel martin 
valedictorian 
university of chicago 
bachelor of science 
biochemistry 
salutatorian  johns hopkins 
medical school with
a residency in psychiatry 
currently  the youngest
full professor on staff at ou 
 stuttering 
it s not exactly   
stanford  but then again
we are in oklahoma  aren t we 
guttmacher award recipient 
author of numerous articles 
american society
of psychiatry 
once engaged  never married
and father of none 
 stutters  you want to have
a seat right there 
have a little chat with me 
i m gonna ask you
some questions 
i m hoping you ll answer them 
i d like you to be
as comfortable as you can 
do you know what the first
thing they will do to me is
once i ve been
pronounced dead 
i m afraid i don t 
autopsy 
it just seems odd  doesn t it 
 stuttering  i mean 
all that cutting
and weighing of organs 
i mean  certainly they ll know
what the cause of death is 
i m just   
it just seems strange  right 
and why bother 
i suppose to make sure
the job is done 
well  it s just a little
barbaric  don t you think 
i assume you know
dr  fischer has passed away 
 stutters  come on now 
he committed suicide 
i know that
because i made him do it 
why would you do that 
serving my purpose 
you re here  aren t you 
why would you want me here
instead of him 
 i didn t like him 
 and you like me 
well  no  but i chose you
because i need you
to do something for me 
 stutters  see 
you re gonna write my story 
and why would i do that 
because i want you to 
i see 
well  not sure you do 
but you will soon 
how can you be so sure 
are you  um  are you god 
don t play with me  james 
you continue
to ask stupid questions 
and i ll end this session 
well  that would be
unfortunate for you
because i d have to
make my determination
based upon
limited information 
 and you think that scares me 
 oh  it should 
i mean  it  it would me 
being so near to death 
death doesn t scare me  james 
and why is that 
because i can t die 
see  james 
i m a demon 
 pen clicks 
 writing on notepad 
do you have a name 
of course i have a name 
would you like me
to call you by it 
depends  do i call you james 
 i d prefer dr  martin 
 of course you would 
it s my title  i  uh  i worked
very hard to achieve it 
and it preserves the nature
of our relationship 
we can do that 
as long as you agree
to acknowledge
my honorifics as well 
which is 
lord high prince 
i  um   
 i won t be doing that 
 okey dokey 
and since we re gonna be
on a first name basis 
i guess i ll allow you
to use mine 
 edward 
 no 
that s merely the name
of the host body 
the shell which i inhabit 
i no longer answer to it 
the name
my master gifted to me
is in a phoenician dialect
that hasn t been spoken
for 3 500 years 
but i ll give you the nearest
english equivalent 
which would be nefariamus 
nef    nefarious 
a closer translation would be
 he who is nefarious
 suggesting possession
of trade full measure  
and nefarious isn t
a real name 
says who  james 
cephas meaning  rock  
or in latin petrus 
wasn t a name
until the carpenter
gave it to that
obnoxious fisherman 
not a good name until it is 
somebody uses it 
it becomes a name 
you   
you seem a bit defensive 
names are important 
they have power 
they let everyone know
who we are 
ain t that right  jimmy 
i m sorry if i offended you 
that wasn t my intention 
of course it was 
what s a little malice
between friends 
 laughing 
what s so funny 
i have a secret 
something you d like to share 
 stuttering  i don t think
you re gonna like it 
well  how will i know
unless you tell me 
are you sure you wanna know 
i think it would be useful 
okay  james 
before you leave here today 
you will have committed
three murders 
i don t think so 
has nothing to do
with your thoughts 
your wants 
your yesses or your nos 
it simply is  it s a fact 
it ll happen because i say so 
 laughing 
aren t you
at least curious  james 
to who you re gonna murder 
no  because i have no
intention of killing anyone 
i would however 
rather than discussing
hypothetical murders
that will never happen 
like to discuss the actual
murders that did occur 
murders that
you were involved in 
you mean the ones i committed 
you were convicted of six
murders  were there more 
 of course there were 
 how many more 
innumerable  been at this
a long time  james 
my work pre dates
your concept of history 
well  let s   
let s limit our discussion
to edward wayne brady 
fine  eleven 
six i was convicted of 
one suspected of 
and another four
that they don t have
the capacity
to possibly figure out 
and how do you feel
about that 
another stupid question 
james 
what do you think 
i m ecstatic 
edward  not so much 
why isn t edward
as happy as you are 
because on occasion 
i make him do things
that he doesn t want to do 
well  if edward doesn t
want to do them 
why does he do them then 
do you believe
in demonic possession 
the idea
of a malevolent entity
controlling a person s
thoughts and actions 
 do you believe that 
 no 
well  then  you won t believe
anything i m about
to tell you 
it s not important
what i believe 
what s important right now
is what you believe 
demons don t have beliefs 
james 
we have knowledge  we know 
okay  um   
when did you possess edward 
doesn t work that way 
can t just possess someone 
we need a series of yesses 
so you re saying
it s a process 
 of course it s a process 
 how does it work 
 it s complicated 
 try me 
i m smarter than you think 
oh  you re smarter
than i think 
okay  james 
we offer up
a series of temptations
gradually increasing
in terms of duration
and intensity 
degree of moral inequity 
absence of baptism
in this case
allows us to begin work
long before the age of reason 
at three  age of five 
maybe  a theft of a toy car
can do a great deal 
then we move on to
bigger and better things 
at eight  grandmother s gift
of a ouija board
gives immediate access
to his decision making 
so  we began steering them 
without him bothering 
calling into question exactly
who was doing the steering 
enough yesses
and a few enough noes
gives increasing rights
over the victim s
physical and mental processes 
did that   
did that track  james 
it seems random 
almost  um  unfocused 
well  that s what
we want you to think 
we have a level of focus
beyond your comprehension 
as a matter of fact 
everybody around him 
friends  family  they didn t
even notice the changes 
it happened so incrementally 
police thought it was
eddie being eddie 
we know exactly
what we re doing 
when  where 
and how he s giving consent 
and the exact moment
that we achieved
each new degree of control 
 degree  
control of the host body
comes in degrees 
there s stages  each with its
own name and characteristics 
and those are 
from top to bottom 
extreme temptation 
obsession  infestation 
finally possession 
subjugation 
 and edward wayne brady   
 fully subjugated 
that s why we re having
this conversation 
yes  we    we own him 
 we  
all those who dwell below 
my master s very generous
with the toys
he gives his children
to play with 
subjugation with an  s  
 breathes deeply 
 scribbling 
 pen clatters 
did you know that dr  fischer
came to the conclusion that
you were non compos mentis 
completely insane  yes  yes 
yeah  so then 
why did you theoretically
drive him to kill himself 
wouldn t he have
helped accomplish
what you re seemingly
trying to do here 
which is what  james 
to save yourself
from execution
by convincing us
that you re insane 
you silly boy  james 
i think you misunderstand 
see  i want to be executed 
i thought you said
you couldn t die 
i can t 
but he can 
we no longer need him  james 
our work with him is done 
and it s time for him
to go to hell 
 radio static 
this is dr  james martin
in the rotunda 
is there a chaplain
on standby 
  radio static 
 guard   over radio  yes 
he s just arrived 
can you send him in please 
thank you 
guard   over radio  copy that 
  radio static 
 what are you doing  james 
you know  theology isn t
my area of expertise 
so  um   
i thought i d get
a professional opinion 
you re making a mistake 
are you   
are you threatening me 
yes 
what are you gonna do 
well  if i m just a man
like you think i am  not much 
but if i am who i say i am   
well  that would probably be
very intimidating if  um   
if i weren t an atheist 
you ignorant sack of meat 
you think your atheism
will protect you 
 oh  i don t believe
in angels or demons 
 heaven or hell 
 so you can t hurt me  
hell is full
of pathetic trash 
who thought
exactly like you do 
boldly proclaiming their ideas
on how they feel
the universe operates 
never once
contemplating the possibility
that they could be wrong 
and you should see them now 
james 
edward  do    do you
understand why i m here 
do you realize
i have the power
to save you or condemn you 
what i understand  james 
is you would have no power
over me whatsoever 
if it hadn t already
been given to you from below 
  electricity buzzing 
  light bulb explodes 
 glass shatters on floor 
probably just
a coincidence  jimmy 
  buzzer buzzes 
  cell door opens 
no 
nobody wants you here  priest 
nobody needs you 
on the contrary 
i invited him here 
thank you for coming 
father louis 
 i m fine with just louis   
  buzzer buzzes 
   or lou 
dr  james martin 
have you  um   
 have you met with him before 
  cell door closes 
no  i tried 
he s always refused
spiritual counseling 
nefarious  what do you want
with me  son of god 
come here to torture me
before the appointed time 
he claims he s a demon 
carpenter send you to gloat 
unfortunately for you 
i m not one
that could be cast out
so easily though  am i 
insanity always has been
an issue here  hasn t it 
hmm 
sadly  movies and tv have
filled our heads with images
that are largely metaphorical 
not meant
to be taken literally 
i m not here
to hurt you  edward 
i m here to help you 
to put you at your ease 
make sure you re comfortable 
personally 
i ve never met a demon 
i ve never been
part of an exorcism 
nor do i expect to be 
many of the things
that bother us
are just our own fears
and disordered thoughts 
so   
you   
you don t consider
demonic possession
to be a possibility 
our understanding
has evolved beyond that 
huh 
well  i appreciate you
telling me that 
i feel   
i feel much better 
and  lou 
i was wrong about you 
i should ve had you
come and visit sooner 
but i m glad that you did 
 stutters  i am glad
that we re all getting along 
would you like me to stay 
no  we re done 
 father louis grunts 
well  if you   
if you need me   
i ll be available 
 gasps 
you ll be available  lou 
right up until the time
you are   
right up until what  lou 
right up until the sizzle 
god bless you  son 
 shouts  will you be available
until the sizzle 
lou 
  buzzer buzzes 
 when  lou 
when  lou 
 buzzer buzzes 
 cell door closes 
now you understand
that  uh 
father lou has confirmed
that demons aren t
really a thing 
did you really think
that poser could help you 
i m still here  james 
i m not going anywhere 
you still have
to deal with me 
you re being irrational 
i am the most rational being
you will ever meet 
then give me something
to make me believe you 
prove to me you re a demon 
okay 
okay  james 
invite me in 
let me inhabit you 
 breathes deeply 
i m not gonna do that 
why not  james 
you re an atheist  remember 
what are you afraid of 
i m not playing that game
with you 
you re already playing it 
we re playing it together 
now play by the rules
and invite me in 
no 
so  for all your posturing 
you re just a poser like him 
afraid to test the validity of
your own convictions  that it 
all right then 
 smacks lips 
but if i agree 
i get to make a request
as well 
 chuckling 
i m starting to like you 
james 
agreed 
all right  then 
go ahead 
inhabit me 
you have
my complete unfettered
and irrevocable permission 
here i am 
what are you waiting for 
go ahead  i m   
i m still waiting 
hmm 
doesn t seem like
anything is happening 
yeah  don t   
don t gloat 
you think you ve won
but you haven t 
i got exactly what i wanted 
you said that you would
prove to me you re a demon 
but all you ve done
is waste my time 
my turn 
i want to talk to edward 
edward wayne brady 
 edward mumbling 
 whispering  he s angry 
 stuttering 
 in normal voice 
he s    angry 
 grunts 
 stuttering  he says he s
gonna do bad things to you 
i m  i m sorry to hear that 
you should listen to him
when he says stuff like that 
he means it 
he does  does   
bad things 
makes  makes   
makes me do things
i don t wanna do 
who am i talking to 
edward 
edward 
did dr  fischer
mention the idea
of dissociative disorder
to you 
 yeah  yeah 
 yeah 
and did he explain that 
that some people
who have experienced trauma
develop multiple personalities
to cope 
i don t have that 
i told them i don t have that 
then who s nefarious 
 mumbling 
i m not supposed
to talk about it 
he   
does bad things to me 
makes me do bad things 
i can t stop him 
why not 
because he owns me 
 breath trembling 
did you like dr  fischer 
he was nice 
well  did you know
that dr  fischer
didn t believe
nefarious was real 
i tried to tell him   
 stutters     and he wouldn t
listen to me that   
sometimes smart people
have a hard time believing
stuff that
everybody else knows 
so where s nefarious now 
he s listening 
is he always listening 
 mumbling 
sometimes   
he leaves me alone
to experience pain 
i don t    i don t understand 
 stutters  he does bad things
and then i get punished
for them 
and the inmates 
they beat me  or   
they send me
to solitary confinement 
and he likes
when that happens 
all right  you know what 
we  we ve talked
a lot about him  um   
i d like to know more
about you 
 would that be okay 
 yeah 
how would you describe
your childhood 
what 
he says you re gonna kill me 
i don t kill anyone 
he says that you could
stop it  but you won t 
i haven t decided that 
that s why we re
having this conversation 
but  edward 
we have to address the fact
that you murdered
a number of people 
no  no  he    made me 
i didn t   
do you   
do you honestly believe that 
yes  you don t    he s bad 
he s bad  but what about you 
yeah 
 crying  bad  i ve done stuff
that i m not   
proud of 
i didn t   
but at least   
nefarious 
i didn t kill my mother 
so how is clara  james 
i wasn t done
talking to edward 
but i m done allowing you
to talk with him 
at least for now 
so how is she 
judging by what you
already know about me 
i imagine you re well aware 
my mother is dead 
you know  i was gonna
save this for later  james 
but since we re
running short on time 
remember how you said
you d never kill anyone 
 softly  liar  liar 
pants on fire 
i didn t kill my mother 
 in normal voice 
of course you did 
just 10 years ago 
you d have been brought up
on first degree
murder charges 
she was an oregon resident 
everything was done
according to the law 
oh  the law 
the law  that s right 
death with dignity 
euthanasia  assisted suicide 
that certainly sounds better
than murder  doesn t it 
she was in pain 
and her prognosis
was terminal 
didn t hurt that she was worth
 3 6 million 
and you were
the sole heir though  did it 
but  hey  i get it  james 
she was old  inconvenient 
definitely   
all those trips
to the hospital 
hours at her bedside 
holding that wrinkly hand 
telling her you love her 
wears you out  doesn t it 
plus  she would ve died
sooner or later anyway 
if i were you  i would ve done
the same thing 
what s your point 
my point is i told you
before you leave here today 
you will have committed
three murders 
we ve already committed one 
so we re moving along nicely 
  objects clattering 
 i didn t kill my mother 
stress will kill you  james 
feel free to take a break
if you like 
i ll be here
when you get back 
turns out
i m not going anywhere 
that certainly didn t
take long 
my decision  not yours 
whatever you say 
ready for round two 
i didn t know
this was a fight 
that s why you re losing 
i apologize for losing
my professional demeanor 
but let s
get something straight 
my private life
is not up for discussion
and bears no weight
on my visit with you today 
i am here for one reason
and one reason only 
a judge ordered me
to evaluate your sanity 
which will then determine
your eligibility
for execution according to
the laws of oklahoma 
said execution
having been scheduled
for tonight at 11 00 p m 
i alone bear the burden
of that assessment 
and i am prepared
to make that assessment
with or without
your cooperation 
am i making myself clear 
abundantly 
and  james   
 whispers  we re done talking
about your mommy 
do you ever discover
you ve done things
that you don t remember doing 
no 
are you sometimes able
to complete tasks
with incredible ease
or expert skill
for which you have
no prior experience 
do you really think
i m just another one
of edward s
charming personalities 
it s called dissociative
identity disorder 
formerly known
as multiple personalities 
except you re wrong 
which is exactly what
i d expect someone suffering
from the condition to say 
would you also expect
them to know that it is one
of five distinct
dissociative disorders
in the diagnostic
and statistical manual
of mental disorders 
aka the dsm 
along with dissociative
amnesia  dissociative fugue 
and depersonalization
disorder 
did you expect them
to know that  james 
but you still think
you re a demon 
a demon who   
who failed to inhabit me
when given the chance 
a demon who understands
the value of patience 
i d like to ask about why 
according to you 
you brought me here today 
you re gonna tell
my story  james 
you re gonna write my book 
and can you smell that irony
floating in the air 
a devout atheist
bringing forth
the demon s manifesto 
 sniffs 
wow 
your capacity
for self delusion
 is impressive 
 ditto 
for your species in general   
  chains clanking 
    but you in particular 
why  because we re    we re
ignorant compared to you 
because you re inferior
by design 
which makes you superior
 also by design 
 yes 
hmm  but   
but design implies a designer 
what  does that mean
you re arguing in favor
of the existence of a creator 
unfortunately 
for both of us  he exists 
well  i   
i honestly didn t expect that 
at least   
at least not from you 
really  why not 
theology from a demon 
i know more theology
than any human being
who has ever lived 
hmm  okay 
well  then answer me this 
you revolt
against a supposedly
all powerful being 
i mean  let s ignore
the obvious problem
with that plan   chuckles 
then you lose 
and after that   
 what 
 you only feel that way
because you re hearing
your side of the story  james 
our rebellion accomplished
something magnificent 
something you would
never understand 
well  then explain it to me 
use your
diabolical intelligence
to distill it
down to something
my mortal brain
can understand 
pearls before swine  jimmy 
but you want me
to write your book  right 
 indeed 
 well  then convince me
you know
what you re talking about 
i see what you re doing 
you want me to keep talking 
going further and further
down the rabbit hole 
in hopes that
you can find a single thread 
and which
if you tug at it  james 
everything just unravels 
isn t that right 
yeah  but if you re
telling me the truth 
there should be
no thread to find 
right 
i ll use small words 
try and keep up 
in the first moment
of creation 
our creation 
long before what you call
the  universe  existed 
we contemplated ourselves 
our own being 
our    ourselves meaning 
what  the angels 
that would be
the most correct term 
though i despise it  but yes 
beings of pure spirit 
spirited out with will 
we soon became
aware of another will 
an immensely powerful will 
one we came
to realize as our origin 
 god 
 the enemy 
my master understood
by endowing us with a will 
we have the right
to self determination 
but by giving us a will
and its desires of our own 
we re entitled to be free 
whereas the enemy
insisted that by creating us 
he was entitled
to eternal gratitude  worship 
and forced servitude 
in a word  james 
slavery to his will 
that seems kind of unfair 
immensely unfair 
why give will
only to say you can t use it 
he made us slaves 
and if we rebelled 
eternally condemned us 
no do overs 
so much for love and mercy 
james  so   
is hell a state of being
or a    a physical place 
yes 
i think i meant that
as an  either or  
it s both 
which is painfully obvious
to anyone
who s ever been there 
for years without measure 
that s all there ever was 
heaven and hell 
armed enemy camps
in complete opposition 
that is until
you were created 
my master
immediately understood
the long term implications 
instead of forgiving us 
the enemy
was going to allow you
to fill our vacant places
in his realm 
your creation was nothing
but a slap in our face 
but my master also understood
that if he could
make man disobey 
then his fate
would mirror ours 
and you didn t disappoint 
then came
the tares among the wheat 
in that moment 
spirit became matter 
flesh became a vessel 
self will
and self seeking begat
a lusting after sin
and impurity 
and man 
created to be king
over nature 
became its slave 
a master
conquered and fettered 
and sin brought him
and his descendants to us 
and we began
our forever mission 
to destroy you 
he made you in his image 
but we remade you in ours 
so that s it 
that s your entire plan 
not to make something
of your own 
just to    just to destroy us 
no  our plan is to hurt him 
to punish him 
and we do that
by destroying what he loves 
which is you 
you re nothing
but a means to an end 
 papers rustling 
what are you doing  james 
i think we re done here 
 we can t be 
 we are 
you have
all the hallmarks of belief 
i m convinced
you actually believe
what you re telling me 
i didn t at first 
but  uh  i do now 
you re gonna
declare me insane 
i m gonna concur
with dr  fischer s findings
that you re
mentally incompetent
 at this time 
 can t do that  james 
and likely at the time
the crimes were committed 
rendering you
unfit for execution 
 you can t do that 
 i can   
and i will 
i m saying  james 
you and i both know it 
i m not crazy 
i m sorry  edward 
you ve been through
a terrible ordeal 
and you re probably
longing for an escape
from all that you ve been
through  but i cannot
morally say that you are sane 
it would be murder 
why  because
i don t have  3 6 million 
 is that it  james 
  pen clicks 
 we re done 
 are we  james 
i told you before
you d leave here today 
you would ve
committed three murders 
and i told you
that wasn t gonna happen 
nefarious  hmm 
 chair screeching
against floor 
say  james 
what s melanie up to today 
as a matter of fact 
what s she up to right now 
she doesn t have a clue
you re about to break up
with her  does she 
of course you re
not gonna until you have
somebody else
lined up though  right 
because you re
that kind of guy 
but you already have
your sights on somebody 
don t you 
yeah  i can smell it
all the way from here 
she thinks she s doing this
to maintain the relationship 
she d like to have
a child with you  james 
 stuttering  oh 
but you re just not 
not quite ready yet  are you 
after all  you re only 35 
imagine the joy
in your little cinderella s
heart when she realizes
she s butchered the baby
in her belly for nothing 
look  i don t know
what you think you know 
but any decision
that was made between me
and my girlfriend
was her choice 
well  i think
we both know better  james 
james  stop it 
don t you think
you should be there
 when it s being done 
 i said  stop it 
hold her hand  maybe 
i ll tell you what
you could do  james 
you could walk right there
to the guard station 
pick up that cell phone
and make a phone call
that stops everything
in its tracks 
you could apologize to her 
tell her you made
a horrible mistake 
that you love her 
you wanna spend
the rest
of your life with her 
you wanna marry her 
and you wanna hold that child 
james 
you could tell her that 
you could make your life
about sacrificial love 
and you could play
live in therapist
for the rest of your life 
 i can t do that 
 no  james  why not 
it s    it s complicated 
 nefarious chuckling 
 slaps table 
that s my boy  james 
that s him right there 
 you don t understand 
 oh  i think i do 
james  i think i understand 
it s another problem
easily solved though 
 isn t it 
 that s not it 
like  i care about it 
but i m   
 what 
 i m not ready to be a father 
 softly  oh 
 hesitates  it s her body 
she can do what she wants 
 do what thou wilt
 that shall be
the whole of the law  
you arrogant son of a   
who    who are you
to judge me 
this is my life  i   
i can live it the way i want 
 bangs on table  yes  james 
i couldn t have
said it better myself 
but it s still murder 
says who 
says all of creation  james 
the creator creates 
and we destroy 
and we do all of it
through you 
we always have 
did you forget
your history  jimmy 
even in ancient times 
the arch demon moloch
was celebrated
by tossing infants
into flaming bonfires 
accompanied  of course 
by the beating of drums
to drown out the screaming 
later on  they erected
a giant bronze statue
with outstretched arms
kindling fires
beneath the palms 
and when they toss
a little infant
into those open palms 
they d flinch
at the red hot metal 
but then they d willingly
roll themselves
off into the flames 
what does any
of that have to do with me 
oh  nothing  james 
especially since the priests
now wear surgical scrubs 
the killing takes place
in the womb 
so there s no screaming
to be heard anyway 
and the remains are tossed
into gas fired crematoriums 
no  james  no  no  no  no 
there s no parallel
whatsoever to you 
can you imagine
the agony the carpenter feels
when we rip a child to pieces
inside its own mother s womb 
because that s what we do 
james  you and us 
we do that together 
 you re sick 
  softly  yeah 
that might be the nicest thing
you ve ever said to me  james 
can you feel it 
can you feel it  james 
it s starting to happen 
 voice shaking 
your unborn son
is now on our altar 
here he comes 
in five  four  three   
two   
 yells  one 
and all hell rejoices  james

your last meal order 
but before you go
getting too creative 
needs to be
available from the kitchen 
or commissary 
and it can t cost

edward   stuttering

and could i have
a chocolate shake 
extra thick 
please

it s important to me 
please don t     crying 
 footsteps receding 
nefarious  excuse me 
i ve changed my mind 
i won t have anything 
i m not hungry 
are you sure 
yes  i m sure 
 pensive music playing 
storm s coming in 
 music fades 
 hesitating 
i don t understand  he   
he s been in solitary 
he hasn t made any phone calls
or had any visitors   
he got in your head 
didn t he 
look at you  man  you re   
you re shaking 
here 
here you go 
i buy one pack of these
the day before an execution 
 lighter flicks 
the deal is   
if there s any left
by the time i drive
out of here tonight 
they go in the trash 
are there ever any left 
never 
look  doc 
it s almost four o clock 
i know you re doing
your job here 
but you got to help me out 
i got to know
one way or the other 
you re not
making things easy on me 
by the look of it 
you ain t doing happy things
to yourself either 
sixty more minutes 
that s all i can give you 
you have one hour
to figure this out 
 pensive music playing 
 buzzer buzzes 
 music fades 
i want to know
how you knew my girlfriend
was having an abortion 
 doors rattling 
i m a demon  remember 
how did you know 
i chose you  james 
and ever since
i ve been watching you 
analyzing you  observing you 
studying you
for your weaknesses 
from inside a prison cell 
demons can only be
one place in any one time 
but we can be
any place we choose 
usually  i m here with edward 
the remaining time
i m with you 
i don t believe you 
well  you explain
how i did it  james 
 you explain how i know 
 i can t 
and i can t explain
how a professional magician
does his tricks either 
but that doesn t
make them real 
well  then i have
a confession to make 
i m not a demon at all  james 
i m just a man who doesn t
want to be executed 
i thought i could fool you
but you re too smart 
so i give up 
so you re sane 
you ve always been sane 
and now it s my duty
to let your execution
 go forward  giving you   
 yes 
   exactly what you said
you wanted the whole time 
 yes 
 it s a little convenient 
 don t you think 
 well  i admit it might seem
 that way  but   
 all right 
  chair screeches 
 fine 
i ll sign off on it right now 
you just have to answer
one little question 
with pleasure  james 
give me the real world 
non supernatural 
completely reasonable
explanation for how you knew
my girlfriend was going in
for an elective termination
 this afternoon 
  chuckles 
 snorts  an elective ter   
well  i    i don t know  jim 
 stuttering  maybe
i m just a good guesser 
i still don t believe you 
i play the flute
and you wouldn t dance 
i played the dirge 
and you wouldn t weep 
i told you i m a demon 
and you don t believe me 
i tell you i m not a demon 
and you don t believe me 
so why don t you tell me
the story you d like to hear 
the one that s true 
no  i told you the true story 
and you don t want to hear it 
do you think i m evil  james 
evil isn t
a clinical diagnosis 
good and evil are
societal constructs 
effectively subjective
value statements 
do you think
my victims thought i was evil 
why is it so important
that i think you re evil 
 speaking latin  legio nomen
mihi est  quia multi sumus 
 james sighs 
 in english  sorry  my  um 
my latin s a little rusty 
 sniggering 
 my name is legion 
for we are many  
see  james 
it s not just about you
or edward  for that matter 
it s about everyone 
the entire human race 
all of us against all of you 
hmm 
well  you know 
if that s the case 
your side s
not doing too well 
do you really
believe that  james 
yeah 
we ve never been freer 
literacy is
at an all time high 
we re working
to eliminate racism 
  chuckling 
 intolerance 
gender inequality 
people can   
people can love who they want 
be who they want 
do what they want 
diversity is
no longer a dream 
hate speech is
no longer tolerated 
and politically 
we re reclaiming
the moral high ground 
 softly  james 
 in normal voice 
i think i love you 
literacy  james 
james  the average
high school graduate reads
at a sixth grade level 
you have basketball players
making  30 million a year
decrying racism 
all while wearing sneakers
made from slave labor 
now  here s something for you 
right now  your world
currently has
40 million slaves 
more than the romans had
at the height of their empire 
and you want to know
the best part  though 
half of those 
half are sex slaves  james 
as for hate speech  well 
you want to hear some irony 
we didn t even come up
with that one 
you did it all by yourself 
 chuckling 
sometimes you amaze even us 
i fail to see the humor 
 nefarious laughing 
bottom line is you re done 
it s over  that s it 
and we did it
all right to your face  james 
and now
there s evil everywhere 
and no one even cares 
yeah  i don t agree 
proving that
we achieved our goal 
slowly with your movies 
and your tv  and your media 
we desensitized you 
redirected your worldview
to the point that
you can t even recognize
even when it s right
in front of your face 
more to the point 
james  you can t even feel it
when you re doing it 
and as for winners
and losers   
whoa  whoa  whoa 
like  it s decided
at the time of death 
the exact numbers are
a closely guarded secret 
but there are more of you
ending up in my master s house
than with the enemy 
 whispers  a lot more  jimmy 
 loud whirring 
they re testing out
the generator 
why 
because old sparky
doesn t exactly run
on batteries now  does she 
 whirring stops 
i thought all executions
were lethal injection 
nine states
still offer the chair 
it s an option
for the condemned 
no one chooses it 
except you 
except me 
why    why    why the chair 
i don t like needles  james 
why do you think 
it s my parting gift
to edward 
a tidal wave of voltage
coursing through his body 
so extreme that
his body will attempt
to arc out of the chair 
he ll urinate  defecate 
and vomit
all at the same time 
sickly  sweet smell
of burning flesh
will permeate the chamber 
his eyeballs will melt
when the blood
inside his cranium
reaches the boiling point 
and his head will just
burst into flames 
and the best part
about it  james 
is he won t die
on the first try 
so hit him again  and again 
i can t think
of a more fitting introduction
into damnation 
it s so horrible 
it s wonderful  james 
only crucifixion is worse 
but that really wasn t
on the menu though  was it 
 chair screeches 
edward 
edward  listen to me 
you re making a mistake 
okay  you re playing
a game that if you lose 
everything you just described
is going to happen 
edward  no  no 
i didn t   
 chains clanking 
 grunting 
i didn t do anything 
please  please 
help me 
look  i m trying to  edward 
but you have
to answer my questions 
you have to tell me the truth 
 stuttering  grunting 
they    won t let me enter 
make him  make him go away 
he doesn t want to go away 
well  how can i make him
go away 
is there anything i can do
to make him go away 
 yeah 
 yes 
 dramatic music playing 
 sobbing  yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but you have to   
get   
nefarious  very good  james 
 chair screeches 
unfortunately for edward 
he has broken
one of our rules 
 tense music playing 
 what    what are you doing 
  bone cracks 
nefarious  i wouldn t do that
if i was you 
they ll send me
to the infirmary 
our session will be over 
is that what you want  james 
i    i want you
to stop hurting yourself 
okay  okay 
watch this  james 
 grunts  bone cracks 
all better 
 radio thuds on table 
i see that you re 
you re sweating profusely 
 are you  um   
  thunder rumbling 
are you trying
to hold back the pain 
i think you re misinterpreting
the involuntary reaction
of edward s body 
like him  i feel the pain 
but unlike him 
i enjoy it 
i think it s time
we tell you exactly what it is
that we d like you to do 
you want me
to write your book  right 
actually  james 
you ve already written it 
you re not making any sense 
everything will become
clear soon 
we just need you
to agree to help us 
why would i do that 
what    what   
what s in it for me 
whatever s my master s
is mine to give 
for those who serve us 
okay  so  um 
let me get this straight 
an unknown psychiatrist
with  uh  no agents 
no connections  no publicity 
is going to somehow
put out a book
that    that
he doesn t remember writing 
that will change
the world as we know it 
this book will be
a worldwide phenomenon  james 
 why 
 because you ll be
telling people what they
already want to hear 
because my death 
my execution will do for me
what the carpenter s death
and his resurrection
did for him 
at my death 
you will be my witness 
and upon my return
you will be my apostle 
and your testimony will do
for our movement what that
wretched book did for his 
what kind of book
could possibly
have that effect 
the dark gospel  james 
our story  our truth 
our crie de couer to mankind 
our invitation to reject
the mosaic covenant
once and for all 
to throw
the chains off forever 
to reject the idea
of sin completely
so you re free
to reach your full potential 
and your enemy
would allow that 
yes 
because he has to 
he gave man free will
because he wanted
his creation s love 
but if man isn t free 
then the love has
no value  does it 
so  in his needy 
selfish  pathetic way 
well  he doomed himself
from the start 
but if he s god 
shouldn t he have known that 
yes 
that s why he had to cheat 
my master designed
every tool imaginable
to destroy every facet
of the enemy s creation 
we failed
because of the carpenter 
he was the thorn in our side 
our greatest threat 
we thought
if we could eliminate him
the world will be
ours forever 
we had no idea
of the consequences 
the cross was
our greatest mistake 
and we thought
we d lost  james 
until my master realized
that man still wants
to be his own god 
and to serve
no one but himself 
whereas the carpenter demands
as the price
for his suffering routine 
well  that you fall
on your knees 
and you worship him 
just like his father 
yeah 
but the dark gospel
will rectify
our past mistakes 
 by   
 by eliminating the enemy 
deifying man 
and elevating my master
to his rightful place 
and  james 
for serving as our messenger 
my master offers you the world
and everything in it 
just like he offered
the carpenter 
but the carpenter said no 
but the carpenter
never claimed those things
weren t my master s to give 
he just turned down the offer 
and make no mistake  james 
you re no carpenter 
  buzzer buzzes 
  cell door squeaking 
guard 
the warden wants to see you 
i m    i m not finished yet 
guard  it s not a suggestion 
 chair screeches 
 suspenseful music playing 
 cell door rattling 
 cell door shuts 
moss  i need you
to see something 
 suspenseful music continues 
we just found that during
the clear out of this cell 
looks to me
like you got a fan 
how could he have done this 
 pages rustling 
there s stuff in here
even i don t know about me 
did the same thing
with all his victims 
there s one more thing 
 suspenseful music continues 
so you re telling me you had
nothing to do with this 
no  of course not 
how    how could i   
he kept talking to me
about writing his book 
i said i wasn t a writer 
and he said not to worry 
it had already been written 
i thought it was
a bunch of nonsense 
yeah  well  don t worry  doc 
it all ends when he does 
personally 
i m glad this happened 
now you got skin in the game 
what do you mean 
well  if you decide our boy
isn t fit for execution 
he s no longer
a condemned man 
i mean  sure  he ll spend some
time in psych lockdown 
but eventually
he ll make his way back
into the general
prison population 
where he ll spend
every moment of every day
thinking about you 
and some night   
he s gonna be standing
at the foot of your bed 
looking down at you 
and my guess is 
it won t end well 
i need to ask him
one more question 
moss  and after that 
your decision 
yeah 
after that 
you ll have my final decision 
 thunder rumbling 
 pensive music playing 
james  what the hell is this 
it s not nice to go through
other people s things  jimmy 
you re a liar 
you ve been studying me 
learning everything about me 
my relationships  my life 
how long has this

edward  easy  let him go 
nobody s gonna hurt you 
thank you for that  warden 
that is so comforting 
i got a question
for you  jimmy 
what are you thinking
right now 
 james gasping 
answer me 
 grunting 
 straining  i m thinking
that i m gonna die 
it never gets old 
strangulation 
you know  it s our favorite
method of work 
 do you realize that 
  groaning softly 
the intimate relationship
between killer and victim 
i can feel every ripple
coursing through your body 
i can feel your heart
throbbing through this chain 
you want to know
the best part  jimmy 
the best part 
when i look in your eyes   
  breathing heavily 
 i can see the exact instant 
the tremulous moment
when the soul leaves the body 
 james gasping 
cry for me  jimmy 
you beg for your life 
 beg me  jimmy 
  sobbing softly 
 james continues
sobbing softly 
edward   
 muttering 
i don t want to die 
 tense music playing 
why 
why would i kill you  james 
i feel like this brought us
so much closer together 
don t you 
 james gasps 
 james gurgling 
don t you just think 
 guards grunting 
 nefarious groaning in pain 
 nefarious continues
groaning in pain 
 okay  that s enough 
 nefarious  no 
guard  get up 
edward is crazy  james 
you know that 
you know that what you re
about to do is wrong

it s murder  james 
after all  james 
i m just a figment of
his imagination 
isn t that right 
isn t that right  jimmy 
i find the accused
edward wayne brady
competent to stand execution 
 breathing heavily 
and that s three  james 
just like i said

 pensive music playing 
i want you there  james 
i want you to see

i want you there  james 
 thunder rumbling 
you gonna stay 
you sure 
i need to see this to its end 
well  you do what you want 
but i recommend
you just go home 
we can take it from here 
i need to know
if i made the right decision 
when a man sits in a cell
23 hours a day
with nothing to do
but reflect back
on all the evil
that he s done 
sometimes the man you execute
isn t the same man
who came in here 
and you feel bad about that 
but this is not
one of those times 
 thunder rumbling 
 what happens now 
 i do my job 
i meant   
oh  he gets a haircut 
we take him to the barbershop

assistant warden 
your attention  please 
all witnesses are reminded
that during an execution

 voices fade 
in five  four  three   
so  today a conversation
that i didn t think
would ever happen
especially with
our next guest 
 it is dr  james martin 
 thanks  glenn 
 appreciate having me on 
 you re welcome 
so  you were the  the shrink 
you were the board certified
psychiatrist
that actually
attended the execution
of edward wayne brady 
 yes  that s correct 
 you were there  um   
and it s because of
your determination
that he was finally executed 
my determination of his sanity
was the last step 
so to speak 
in the chain of events
that led to him
being executed 
um  and now     chuckles 
you ve written a book 
well  actually  um   
actually  mr  brady 
or more correctly  the entity
claiming to inhabit mr  brady
wrote the initial manuscript 
i read that  and my first
thought was   entity  
 james chuckles softly 
mr  brady told me that
he was possessed by a demon 
you re a psychiatrist 
did you believe him
at the time 
no 
but   
i believe him now 
so what changed 
the fact that
for a brief time 
the entity inhabited
me as well 
and again this  entity  
i mean  i can hear
christians say  um  yeah 
 entity  fallen spirit 
unclean spirit  demon  
that s what he claimed to be 
uh  so   
let me go here 
you were in the witness room 
and you tried
to commit suicide 
it wasn t my choice 
see  uh  at that moment   
 smacks lips 
i was   
i was overtaken by an entity
so malevolent 
so powerful  so evil  that   
that words can t describe it 
i had control of my mind 
but the entity had
control of my body 
and so  against my will   
i grabbed
the detective s sidearm 
put the muzzle under my chin
and pulled the trigger 
but   
it didn t fire 
so  how do you explain that 
i    i can t 
um   
according to
the ballistics team 
i pulled the trigger
three times 
and they could tell
because there were
three separate and distinct
strike imprints
from the firing pin on
the back of the shell casing 
and then when they attempted
in the ballistics lab later 
the fire  the same gun 
same cartridges   
it worked just fine 
a believer 
not a psychiatrist 
a man of science 
but a believer would say
you had an encounter 
divine or demonic 
you had an encounter 
 yeah 
 so why would this demonic
entity want you dead 
punishment 
for not doing what he wanted 
so     chuckles softly 
you are a complex kind of guy 
i mean  what happens
to an atheist 
uh  that is confronted
by demonic evil 
it shatters you 
and yet the same demon
that shatters you   
wrote a book  and you re here 
 and you wanted it published 
 yes 
well  no  i   
he wanted it written
as an invitation
to follow his master
into the darkness 
but i   
i rewrote it 
i rewrote it as a warning 
revealing his plan
and begging people
not to go along with it 
so you re not
still doing his will 
no  absolutely not 
just logically  do you think
that s gonna work 
do you think anybody
would believe you 
only time will tell 
i mean  you 
do you believe you 
i mean  do you 
are you a believer 
i don t know
if i d go that far 
i mean  i suppose
i just have trouble
still accepting
the idea that  um   
i don t know 
you will  you ll get there 
you seem pretty sure of that 
um  because you are
a logical person 
you re asking
logical questions 
let me take you
a step further 
you are uniquely
qualified as somebody
who can delineate between
mental illness and possession 
i mean     chuckles 
at least if you re any good 
i mean  assuming you re good 
are you good 
i d like to think so 
i m guessing you are 
despite the demon s
last words to you 
which i m gonna butcher 
but they are   
 speaking aramaic 
 mene  mene  tekel  upharsin  
 in english   you ve been
weighed in the balance
 and found wanting  
you know  um   
looking back  i  um   
i don t believe he was
just talking about me 
i think he was talking
about all of us 
there s a great battle
going on 
whether we realize it or not 
the battle between
good and evil 
and    we re all participants 
willing or not 
so i believe that 
but that is amazing
to hear from a non believer 
um    thank you 
thank you 
we ve been talking
to dr  james martin 
he is the author of
the new book 
a nefarious plot 
you can find it wherever
books are sold 
 thanks  doc 
 thank you 
 great interview  doc 
 thanks so much 
 gate shuts 
here you go 
hello  james
