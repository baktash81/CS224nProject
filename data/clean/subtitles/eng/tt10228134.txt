but no one wants to be ordinary
and what is normal
we all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds
normal party normal family
normal adorable little girl
but theres always
more behind the facade
most of the time
lindy seems quite normal
but buried deep in
her dna she has a gift
some call it a condition
or even worse a disorder
thats just
waiting to be activated
and it makes
her anything but normal
when people do bad things
lindy cannot control herself
maybe if shed had
that normal loving family
she could have
been extraordinary
but just like lindy mommy
and daddy had their own demons
whether it was that mummys
pills made her so sleepy
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much
well never know
but whatever it was lindy
never got the love she needed
instead she got
angrier and angrier
and her disorder
got worse and worse
and then her parents
got her diagnosis
the doctors called it
intermittent explosive disorder
she could not
live safely in the world
and no one would
be safe around her
so to live at all
she would have to live alone
isolated from others
till the cure could be found
the huge amount of cortisol
coursing through lindys body
made her faster than
normal stronger than normal
which made her
incredibly attractive
to certain interested parties
but her condition also
made her extremely volatile
and far far
angrier than normal
lindy had a hair trigger
once provoked she would snap
until she could gain control
she was no use to anyone
her life as
a human lab rat began
the results were mixed
so they thought
maybe the military
would give her the structure
to channel her unique gifts
or maybe not
all right stop
get off
get off him now
stop means stop
they were
so kind and supportive
its a wonder it didnt help
of course all these
cures only made it worse
you would think theyd
learn not to piss her off
it was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up
and throw away the key
lindy would be alone forever
and then a breakthrough
a chance to be normal
the treatment was
brutal barbaric outrageous
and surprisingly effective
youre checking out my story
like you dont care
but every time i look
i see you right there
why you
tryna watch my joyride

uh
how about the pork chop
pistachio crust

no im not
sir you are
youre making it impossible
for me to impress my date
and its embarrassing
how about the chicken
sure
thank you
let me know if
you need anything else
thank you
you know if you were planning
to stab her with that knife
itd be totally cool with me
look i have to pee actually
okay
ill be right back
i know right
a guy just told
his wife he is having an affair
some old womans
dentures got stuck in her steak
but hold up you should see
the first date i just served
i gave the guy some attitude
and he practically
cried into his napkin
yeah and his date just sat
there and watched him squirm
oh my god
it was so embarrassing
i mean screwing with the
customers isnt fun anymore
its like my own
private freak show
the guy had like
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu
it was pathetic
i know
total losers
anyway
shell call you back
fuck
oh aint you
a fine little piece
ow
fuck
its not working
okay fix it
youre probably just
building up a tolerance
no im not
look this is cuttingedge
avantgarde treatment
okay well
im sure youll get
the nobel prize once
youre dead
is that a threat
can you fix it or not
all right
okay
here
your emotions must
be running pretty high
in order for you
to override the system
yeah i have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol
so my emotions are
running high all the time
but you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse
all the time
so im assuming that the date
was a disappointment then
i mean
given that its primary function
was to test if i could partake
in a customary social situation
without beating
the shit out of someone
then yeah i would say yeah
it was a it was
a real disappointment
how badly did you hurt him
i didnt
even get round to him
who did you get around to
a waitress look it doesnt
matter your thing failed
lindy this is not
a cure ive told you that
the only way were
going to make progress
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past
ive told you my story
but theres a difference
between talking about your past
and actually working through it
asphyxiation
jugular bleed
classy
here you go
ive upped the voltage
but theres only so much
that the human body can take
you dont care about
me im just an experiment
why would i risk my
lifes work if i didnt care
and why wont you admit
that you really like this guy
because i didnt
okay
anyway it doesnt matter
i think last night proved that
your exposure therapy
didnt work
what what what
would you like me to do hmm
would you like me to
put leeches on your skin
would you like me to drill
a hole
in your head to release
the demons
would you like me to
make you drink your own urine
actually tried that
thats disgusting
anyway i think
that really you need to admit
that the answer to all of
your problems
is close
human connection
penis is not
gonna fix me dr freud
um i just
and ive tried that as well
you like this guy so
for once have a relationship
oh please fuck off
im talking about love
no i dont want a boyfriend
we both know id end up knocking
his teeth down his throat
maybe you wont but i dont
know why you would walk away
from somebody
who made you feel something

from you

my nerves

you dont mind do you
im just a bit
parched after that
oh i needed that
okay you were gonna
tell me who killed justin
those men back there
they work for me
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me
they do this
because they know
that i am a man of my word
now
business like this
i like to keep private
cause the truth is
all that i have is
because of one thing
and one thing only
and that is
that i have never
been a man of my word
so if youll excuse me
i dont like to
get business on my suit
okay
what is it about gross old men
always underestimating women
interesting ball color
what we calling that oxblood
claret
just like a woman
straight for the nuts
no i only do
that when im in hurry
although evolution hasnt
really been kind to you guys
putting the onoff switch
dangling around in front
for any predator
to come by and flick
now who killed him
i dont know
dont be silly
gareth fizel
gareth fizel
yeah hes my boss
why would
he kill his accountant
maybe he was skimming the books

aint dumb
enough to go after fizel

you know what i think
i am exactly that stupid
you enjoying that
mmm background check came in
your lil girlfriend
shes got a history of violence
assault harassment
interesting job history
too classifiedtype shit
so shes got skills
and an anger issue
not a great combo
i still dont think
shes the type to blow
her boyfriends head off
hope not or else youre next
shes got a short fuse
doesnt make her a murderer
thats what happens
when you dont follow protocol
sometimes common
sense trumps protocol
nah im good being the superior
one in this relationship
wha hey what
am i supposed to eat
ill see what i can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door
always taking such good
care of me thank you partner

bad idea ive got
this condition okay

lindy i dont wanna
see you wind up dead
just let us do our job
so what
does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest fizel
yes thought not
fuck
i was hoping to see you
you like lobster
uh i always thought
it was overrated and overpriced
most people dont realize
that lobsters belong in
the same biological phylum
as cockroaches
they are both anthropods
with segmented bodies
they both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs
even their meat is the same
lobsters must be boiled alive
cockroaches poisoned
wow
ugly and boring
what a winning combination
what the fuck has
this got to do with me
you are an odd specimen
not sure what uh
phylum you belong in
me neither
thats something my therapist
and i are really delving in to
i understand
you are here to kill me
something about an accountant
your boyfriend
we hadnt put a label on
it but he was pretty special
i kill a lot of people
i suppose some of them
may be accountants im
im sorry i killed yours
well apology not accepted
you creepy fuck
rude
you are certainly
a a rare species
im glad i took this
opportunity to get one good
long hard look at you
okay but can you do it
without
whacking me on
the head this time
fuck
fuck
balls
fuck balls indeed
im getting the feeling
theres no cookie
and juice after this
not for you
wait wait wait
justin
did you pull the trigger
no i didnt
though i wish i had
this is going
to take a sec so
sit back relax
fuck
enjoy the ride
what are you doing to me
do you know what
exsanguination means
the drainage of ones blood
aah
aah
aah
i have a few questions
how do i get to fizel
hey where
do you think youre going
get ready to die you sick fuck
justin
bravo well done
you know
i gotta admit lindy uh
right toward the end there i
i didnt think you had it in ya
so my apologies
i decided to take
care of fizel myself
what are you covered in
is it that time of the month
but you
i saw you how
the guy in the casket
no
aah some bum off the street
jesus christ
yeah i just paid
off the coroner you know
why
i had to
get fizel out of the way
but the cia cant
operate on us soil
even the government
wouldnt be dumb
enough to go after him
exactly
yeah i needed someone
from the outside you know
someone to draw
the attention away from myself
someone who couldnt
be traced back to me
so you chose me
why
a glowing
recommendation from dr munchin
i mean who do you think funds
his batshit crazy experiments
but see i
i knew you
were something else yeah
my little kamikaze k9
what the fuck
are you talking about
well in the
second world war uh
they strapped bombs to dogs
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks
right
the puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat
or something but they got
detonated into dogburger
yeah
so i just had
to figure out what treats
i needed to use
to train you to take out fizel
and if you failed or
got killed in the process
well you know cost me nothing
thats why you were perfect
wheres my car by the way
who the fuck are you
who am i
im the only one
keeping this old shitbag
from killing innocent people
fizel was an asset
that became a liability
everybody wanted him dead
but nobody can touch him
and you think this masochistic
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop
not so untouchable
anymore are ya handsome
huh
you lowlife piece of shit
im gonna fucking kill you
you could try or
we just fuck instead

tinkering

a really beautiful story lindy
desperate little
broken princess
