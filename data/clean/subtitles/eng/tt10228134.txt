but no one wants to be ordinary 
and what is normal 
we all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds 
normal party  normal family 
normal adorable little girl 
but  there s always
more behind the facade 
most of the time
lindy seems quite normal 
but buried deep in
her dna she has a gift 
some call it a condition 
or even worse  a disorder 
that s just
waiting to be activated
and it makes
her anything but normal 
when people do bad things 
lindy cannot control herself 
maybe if she d had
that normal loving family 
she could have
been extraordinary 
but  just like lindy  mommy
and daddy had their own demons 
whether it was that mummy s
pills made her so sleepy 
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much 
we ll never know 
but whatever it was  lindy
never got the love she needed 
instead  she got
angrier and angrier 
and her disorder
got worse and worse 
and then her parents
got her diagnosis 
the doctors called it
intermittent explosive disorder 
she could not
live safely in the world 
and no one would
be safe around her 
so to live at all 
she would have to live alone 
isolated from others
till the cure could be found 
the huge amount of cortisol
coursing through lindy s body 
made her faster than
normal  stronger than normal 
which made her
incredibly attractive
to certain interested parties 
but her condition also
made her extremely volatile
and far  far
angrier than normal 
lindy had a hair trigger 
once provoked  she would snap 
until she could gain control 
she was no use to anyone 
her life as
a human lab rat began 
the results were mixed 
so they thought 
maybe the military
would give her the structure
to channel her unique gifts 
or maybe not 
all right  stop 
get off 
get off him  now 
stop means  stop 
they were
so kind and supportive 
it s a wonder it didn t help 
of course  all these
cures only made it worse 
you would think they d
learn not to piss her off 
it was looking more and more
like they would just lock her up
and throw away the key 
lindy would be alone  forever 
and then a breakthrough 
a chance to be normal 
the treatment was
brutal  barbaric  outrageous
and surprisingly effective 
  you re checking out my story
like you don t care  
  but every time i look
i see you right there  
  why you
tryna watch my joyride  
  ride  ride  ride  ride

um  justin 
hi  i m lindy 
hey 
yeah  actually i m
not staying so    um 
i thought a date might be fun 
but i m not in
the right head space 
so i didn t want to bail 
without saying something 
 cause i m not a total bitch 
  okay 
  so   
you know it s funny  uh   
this isn t even
the worst date i ve ever had 
yeah  i feel bad   
i m sorry about that   
herpes 
yeah  herpes 
chlamydia and  um  warts 
uh   
okay 
this girl just kept listing off 
all the sexually transmitted
infections she had  it was   
it was unexpected 
yeah  i mean  warts
generally are  aren t they 
you don t have
a disaster date story 
uh  me  no 
i don t date that much  no 
oh  is that  cause you re always
leaving before they start 
no  you re doing quite well 
i normally don t even come in 
oh  why not 
uh   
i hate people 
like who 
i don t know  people who   
who talk with their mouth full
and    and  uh  people who  who
chew too loudly  people who hum 
um  men who wear
jeans with flip flops   
i can t stand
people who walk too slow 
yeah  exactly 
or tell you to have a nice day 
yeah  like  fuck off
i might not want a nice day 
or  uh  people
that talk in elevators 
yeah  that s bad 
yeah  aside from people
that fart in elevators 
that s    that s worse 
do you fart in elevators 
do you fart 
no  i m from
england  we don t   
are we ready to order 
i m actually not
staying  so i don t know 
sir  i m afraid if
she won t be dining with you 
we will need the table back 
okay 
now 
uh   
okay  um   
okay  i ll just  um   
i ll just have the chicken
really quickly then 
uh   
fish please 
without the pine nuts 
we don t do substitutions 
oh  no  i m    i m   
i m allergic  so   
it s restaurant policy 
uh  okay  the pasta  please 
there is a walnut sauce 
uh 
how about the pork chop 
pistachio crust 
fuck me  perhaps you can suggest
something that might work 
please don t
take that tone with me 
  no  i m not 
  sir  you are 
you re making it impossible
for me to impress my date
and it s embarrassing 
how about the chicken 
sure 
thank you 
let me know if
you need anything else 
thank you 
you know  if you were planning
to stab her with that knife 
it d be totally cool with me 
look  i have to pee actually 
  okay 
  i ll be right back 
i know  right 
a guy just told
his wife he is having an affair 
some old woman s
dentures got stuck in her steak 
but hold up  you should see
the first date i just served 
i gave the guy some attitude
and he practically
cried into his napkin 
yeah  and his date just sat
there and watched him squirm 
oh  my god 
it was so embarrassing 
i mean  screwing with the
customers isn t fun anymore 
it s like my own
private freak show 
the guy had  like 
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu 
it was pathetic 
i know 
total losers 
anyway   
she ll call you back 
fuck 
oh  ain t you
a fine little piece   
ow 
fuck 
it s not working 
okay  fix it 
you re probably just
building up a tolerance 
no  i m not 
look  this is cutting edge 
avant garde treatment 
okay  well 
i m sure you ll get
the nobel prize once
you re dead 
is that a threat 
can you fix it or not 
  all right 
  okay 
here 
your emotions must
be running pretty high 
in order for you
to override the system 
yeah  i have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol 
so my emotions are
running high all the time 
but you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse 
all the time 
so  i m assuming that the date
was a disappointment then 
i mean   
given that its primary function 
was to test if i could partake
in a customary social situation
without beating
the shit out of someone 
then yeah  i would say yeah 
it was a    it was
a real disappointment 
how badly did you hurt him 
i didn t
even get round to him 
who did you get around to 
a waitress  look  it doesn t
matter  your thing failed 
lindy  this is not
a cure  i ve told you that 
the only way we re
going to make progress 
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past 
i ve told you my story 
but there s a difference 
between talking about your past 
and actually working through it 
asphyxiation 
jugular bleed 
classy 
here you go 
i ve upped the voltage 
but there s only so much
that the human body can take 
you don t care about
me  i m just an experiment 
why would i risk my
life s work if i didn t care 
and why won t you admit
that you really like this guy 
because i didn t 
okay 
anyway  it doesn t matter 
i think last night proved that
your exposure therapy
didn t work 
what    what    what
would you like me to do  hmm 
would you like me to
put leeches on your skin 
would you like me to drill
a hole 
in your head to release
the demons 
would you like me to
make you drink your own urine 
actually tried that 
that s disgusting 
anyway  i think
that really you need to admit 
that the answer to all of
your problems
is close 
human connection 
penis is not
gonna fix me  dr  freud 
um  i just   
and i ve tried that as well 
you like this guy  so
for once have a relationship 
oh  please fuck off 
i m talking about love 
no  i don t want a boyfriend 
we both know i d end up knocking
his teeth down his throat 
maybe you won t  but i don t
know why you would walk away 
from somebody
who made you feel something 
ugh 
okay  i m walking away
from you 
 cause you re getting on
my nerves 
thank you 
see you next week 
yeah  i can t wait

thank you so much 
  not bad  huh

to disappoint a pretty face

all right 
oh 
aah 
lucky guess 
that s enough 
fight s over 
everybody out 
if he had a bigger adam s apple 
this d be really working for me 
you don t mind  do you 
i m just a bit
parched after that 
oh  i needed that 
okay  you were gonna
tell me who killed justin 
those men back there 
they work for me 
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me 
they do this 
because they know 
that i am a man of my word 
now   
business like this 
i like to keep private 
 cause the truth is 
all that i have is
because of one thing 
and one thing only 
and that is   
that i have never
been a man of my word 
so  if you ll excuse me 
i don t like to
get business on my suit 
okay 
what is it about gross old men
always underestimating women 
interesting ball color 
what we calling that  ox blood 
claret 
just like a woman 
straight for the nuts 
no  i only do
that when i m in hurry 
although  evolution hasn t
really been kind to you guys 
putting the on off switch 
dangling around in front
for any predator
to come by and flick 
now  who killed him 
i don t know 
don t be silly 
gareth fizel 
gareth fizel 
yeah  he s my boss 
why would
he kill his accountant 
maybe he was skimming the books 
look  even the government 
ain t dumb
enough to go after fizel 
are you really that stupid 
you know what  i think
i am exactly that stupid 
you enjoying that 
mmm  background check came in 
your li l girlfriend 
she s got a history of violence 
assault  harassment 
interesting job history
too  classified type shit 
so she s got skills
and an anger issue 
not a great combo 
i still don t think 
she s the type to blow
her boyfriend s head off 
hope not  or else you re next 
she s got a short fuse 
doesn t make her a murderer 
that s what happens
when you don t follow protocol 
sometimes common
sense trumps protocol 
nah  i m good being the superior
one in this relationship 
wha    hey  what
am i supposed to eat 
i ll see what i can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door 
always taking such good
care of me  thank you  partner

this woman in the elevator 
she was   
just been diagnosed
with something horrible
and couldn t stop
crying  it was really awkward

with his fingers in a bunch
of different illegal pies 
he s pretty much untouchable 
oh  i m gonna touch him 
hard 
and a lot  and not in
a way he s gonna enjoy 
where can i find him 
why you doing this 
is this justin really
worth you risking your life for 
yeah  it was early
days  i didn t know him 
i didn t know half
the shit he was caught up in 
but i do know 
he was a decent guy 
he didn t
deserve to die like that 
nobody does 
well  no  but   
most people make me
want to run away screaming 
or snap their fingers
off  he was   
he was nice

there s lots of
nice guys out there 
yeah 
they re all frightened of me

so  what 
does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest fizel 
yes  thought not 
fuck 
i was hoping to see you 
you like lobster 
uh  i always thought
it was overrated and overpriced 
most people don t realize
that lobster s belong in
the same biological phylum
as cockroaches 
they are both anthropods
with segmented bodies 
they both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs 
even their meat is the same 
lobsters must be boiled alive 
cockroaches poisoned 
wow 
ugly and boring 
what a winning combination 
what the fuck has
this got to do with me 
you are an odd specimen 
not sure what  uh 
phylum you belong in 
me neither 
that s something my therapist
and i are really delving in to 
i understand
you are here to kill me 
something about an accountant 
your    boyfriend 
we hadn t put a label on
it  but he was pretty special 
i kill a lot of people 
i suppose some of them
may be accountants  i m   
i m sorry i killed yours 
well  apology not accepted   
you creepy fuck 
rude   
you are certainly
a    a rare species 
i m glad i took this
opportunity to get one good 
long  hard look at you 
okay  but can you do it   
without 
whacking me on
the head this time 
fuck 
fuck 
balls 
fuck balls indeed 
i m getting the feeling
there s no cookie
and juice after this 
not for you 
wait  wait  wait 
justin   
did you pull the trigger 
no  i didn t 
though i wish i had 
this is going
to take a sec so   
  sit back  relax 
  fuck 
  enjoy the ride 
  what are you doing to me 
do you know what
exsanguination means 
the drainage of one s blood 
aah 
aah 
aah 
i have a few questions 
how do i get to fizel 
hey  where
do you think you re going 
get ready to die  you sick fuck 
justin 
bravo  well done 
you know 
i gotta admit lindy  uh   
right toward the end there i   
i didn t think you had it in ya 
so  my apologies 
i decided to take
care of fizel myself 
what are you covered in 
is it that time of the month 
but you   
i saw you  how 
the guy in the casket 
no 
aah  some bum off the street 
jesus christ 
yeah  i just paid
off the coroner  you know 
why 
i had to
get fizel out of the way 
but the cia can t
operate on us soil 
even the government 
wouldn t be dumb
enough to go after him 
exactly 
yeah  i needed someone
from the outside  you know 
someone to draw
the attention away from myself 
someone who couldn t
be traced back to me 
so you chose me 
why 
a glowing
recommendation from dr  munchin 
i mean  who do you think funds
his batshit crazy experiments 
but see  i   
i knew you
were something else  yeah 
my little kamikaze k 9 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
well  in the
second world war  uh   
they strapped bombs to dogs
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks 
right 
the puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat
or something  but they got
detonated into dog burger 
yeah 
so i just had
to figure out what treats
i needed to use
to train you to take out fizel 
and if you failed or
got killed in the process 
well  you know  cost me nothing 
that s why you were perfect 
where s my car by the way 
who the fuck are you 
who am i 
i m the only one
keeping this old shitbag
from killing innocent people 
fizel was an asset
that became a liability 
everybody wanted him dead 
but nobody can touch him 
and you think this masochistic
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop 
not so untouchable
anymore  are ya handsome 
huh 
you lowlife piece of shit 
i m gonna fucking kill you 
you could try  or
we just    fuck instead 
what  we had fun  right 
i mean

you must really be into me 
what the fuck 
was that too strong for ya 
oh  sorry  i did a bit of
tinkering

a really beautiful story  lindy 
desperate  little
broken princess
avenges the death
of her lover and then   
takes her own life
