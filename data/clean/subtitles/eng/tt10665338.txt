theme ends
hunters moon ghost playing
long time coming
im coming back friend
hide children
im coming back friend
though memories faded
come back haunt
though mind somewhat jaded
time strike
tonight
hunters moon
headstone sister
im dying see friend
like old cemetery
im dying see friend
though memories faded
come back haunt
though mind somewhat jaded
time strike
tonight
hunters moon
indistinct chanting vocal

though memories faded
come back haunt
though mind somewhat jaded
time strike
tonight
hunters moon
hunters moon
song ends
