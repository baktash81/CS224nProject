of the haddonfield boogeyman 
too young to give a shit 
too drunk to remember 
40 years ago  a madman escaped
from a mental hospital 
it was the night
before halloween 
and three teenage girls
were walking home
from haddonfield high 
they had sightings of a   
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town 
a man in a white mask 
or was it more than a man 
he was watching them 
before the night was over 
three people would be murdered 
and in the house next door 
there was a babysitter
and a young boy
and a young girl 
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker
who had a power beyond
any mortal man 
my name is tommy doyle 
and i was that young boy 
so  please  join me

and the survivors
of michael myers

my mother s biggest fear
was that my grandmother

karen

to come and kill my mother 
he found where she lived 
he came to her house 
she put us in his path

graham

your grandmother 
he didn t 
it was his doctor 
michael s doctor 
he is the one that   
he took him there 
he knew where to go 
and he s the one
that brought them together 
it was his obsession 
not michael s 
karen 
but we got him 
shot him in the face 
burned him alive
so he can t hurt anyone
ever again 
 inhales deeply

eyes open 
 engine starts

with the strength of a man
and the mind of an animal 
i know  i ve seen his face 
i looked in his eyes
when i took off his mask 
did you know that
when he was a little boy
he used to stand
in his sister s bedroom and   
stare out the window 
my partner died
the night he stood
on that same spot 
but for an instant 
before his death  he knew 
maybe he wasn t looking out 
maybe he was looking in 
at his reflection 
at himself 
who knows what makes him kill 
what motivates him 
but in his heart 
it always seemed to me
he wants one thing 
he s going home 
  he went from laurie s compound   
  mm hmm 
   the victims
in her neighborhood 
to the park  okay 
if you track those locations 
that s a straight line 
basically an arrow
pointing straight
to lampkin lane

i always thought michael myers
was flesh and blood 
just like you and me 
but a mortal man
could not have survived
what he s lived through 
the more he kills 
the more he transcends
into something else
impossible to defeat 
fear 
people are afraid 
that is the true curse
of michael 
he ll always be here  won t he 
even when we can t see him 
you can t defeat it
with brute force 
if we only knew then
what we know now

   bone cracks

the anchor that divides us 
it is the terror that grows

if they don t stop him tonight 
maybe we ll find him tomorrow 
or next halloween 
when the sun sets
and someone is alone 
 quiet chatter 
 siren wails

and pretend he isn t there 
laurie 
because he is
