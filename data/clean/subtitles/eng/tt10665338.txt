40 years ago a madman escaped
from a mental hospital
it was the night
before halloween
and three teenage girls
were walking home
from haddonfield high
they had sightings of a
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town
a man in a white mask
or was it more than a man
he was watching them
before the night was over
three people would be murdered
and in the house next door
there was a babysitter
and a young boy
and a young girl
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker
who had a power beyond
any mortal man
my name is tommy doyle
and i was that young boy
so please join me
in commemorating the victims
and the survivors
of michael myers

when he was a little boy
he used to stand
in his sisters bedroom and
stare out the window
my partner died
the night he stood
on that same spot
but for an instant
before his death he knew
maybe he wasnt looking out
maybe he was looking in
at his reflection
at himself
who knows what makes him kill
what motivates him
but in his heart
it always seemed to me
he wants one thing
hes going home
he went from lauries compound
mmhmm
the victims
